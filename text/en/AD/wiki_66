<text>Lagâri Hasan Çelebi was an Ottoman scientist, engineer and aviator who, according to the account written by traveller Evliya Çelebi, made a successful crewed rocket flight.

==Account==
Evliya Çelebi reported that in 1633, Lagari Hasan Çelebi blasted off from Sarayburnu, (the promontory below the Topkapı Palace in Istanbul) in a 7-winged rocket propelled by 50 okka (140 lbs) of gunpowder. The flight was said to have been undertaken at the time of the birth of Sultan Murad IV&#x27;s daughter. As Evliya Celebi wrote, Lagari proclaimed before launching his craft &quot;O my sultan! Be blessed, I am going to talk to Jesus!&quot;; after ascending in the rocket, he landed in the sea, swimming ashore and joking &quot;O my sultan! Jesus sends his regards to you!&quot;; he was rewarded by the Sultan with silver and the rank of sipahi in the Ottoman army.

Evliya Çelebi also wrote of Lagari&#x27;s brother, Hezârfen Ahmed Çelebi, making a flight by glider a year earlier.

==Popular culture==
&quot;Istanbul Beneath My Wings&quot; is a 1996 film about the lives of Lagari Hasan Çelebi, his brother and fellow aviator Hezârfen Ahmed Çelebi, and Ottoman society in the early 17th century as witnessed and narrated by Evliya Çelebi.

The legend was addressed in an experiment by the television show &quot;MythBusters&quot;, on November 11, 2009, in the episode &quot;Crash and Burn&quot;; however, the team noted that Evliya Çelebi had not sufficiently specified the alleged design used by Lagâri Hasan and said that it would have been &quot;extremely difficult&quot; for a 17th-century figure, unequipped with modern steel alloys and welding, to land safely or even achieve thrust at all. Although the re-imagined rocket rose, it exploded midflight.

<doc id="17871" wikidata="Q5539855" url="?curid=17871" title="Letterboxing (filming)">
<text>Letter-boxing is the practice of transferring film shot in a widescreen aspect ratio to standard-width video formats while preserving the film&#x27;s original aspect ratio. The resulting video-graphic image has mattes of empty space above and below it; these mattes are part of each frame of the video signal.

==Etymology==
The term refers to the shape of a letter-box, a slot in a wall or door through which mail is delivered, being rectangular and wider than it is high.

==Early home video use==
The first use of letter-boxing in consumer video appeared with the RCA Capacitance Electronic Disc (CED) videodisc format. Initially, letter-boxing was limited to several key sequences of a film such as opening and closing credits, but was later used for entire films. The first fully letter-boxed CED release was &quot;Amarcord&quot;, and several others followed including &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; and &quot;The King of Hearts&quot;. Each disc contains a label noting the use of &quot;RCA&#x27;s innovative wide-screen mastering technique&quot;.

==In cinema and home video==

The term &quot;SmileBox&quot; is a registered trademark used to describe a type of letter-boxing for Cinerama films, such as on the Blu-ray release of &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;. The image is produced by using a map projection-like technique to approximate how the picture might look if projected onto a curved Cinerama screen.

==On television==
Digital broadcasting allows 1.78:1 widescreen format transmissions without losing resolution, and thus widescreen is the television norm. Most television channels in Europe are broadcasting standard-definition programming in 1.78:1, while in the USA, these are down-scaled to letterbox. When using a 1.33:1 screen, it is possible to display such programming in either a letter-boxing format or in a 1.33:1 center-cut format (where the edges of the picture are lost).

A letter-boxed 1.56:1 compromise ratio was often broadcast in analogue transmissions in European countries making the transition from 1.33:1 to 1.78:1. In addition, recent years have seen an increase of &quot;fake&quot; 2.40:1 letterbox mattes on television to give the impression of a cinema film, often seen in adverts, trailers or tv such as &quot;Top Gear&quot;.

Current high-definition television systems use video displays with a wider aspect ratio than older television sets, making it easier to accurately display widescreen films. In addition to films produced for the cinema, some television programming is produced in high definition widescreen.

On a widescreen television set, a 1.78:1 image fills the screen; however, 21:9 aspect ratio films are letter-boxed with narrow mattes. Because the 1.85:1 aspect ratio does not match the 1.78:1 aspect ratio of widescreen video, slight letter-boxing occurs. Usually, such matting of 1.85:1 film is eliminated to match the 1.78:1 aspect ratio in the image transference.

Letterbox mattes are not necessarily black. IBM has used blue mattes for many of their TV ads, yellow mattes in their &quot;I am Superman&quot; Lotus ads, and green mattes in ads about efficiency &amp; environmental sustainability. Others uses of colored mattes appear in ads from Allstate, Aleve, and Kodak among others, and in music videos such as Zebrahead&#x27;s &quot;Playmate of the Year&quot;. In other instances mattes are animated, such as in the music video for Rob Zombie&#x27;s &quot;Never Gonna Stop (The Red Red Kroovy)&quot;, and even parodied such as the final scene of the Crazy Frog Axel F music video in which Crazy Frog peeks over the matte on the lower edge of the screen with part of his hands overlapping the matte. Similar to breaking the border of a comic&#x27;s panel, it is a form of breaking the fourth wall. The 2016 &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; exploited the edges for its 3D effects, with visual effects that &quot;spilled over&quot; into the letter-boxed areas.

The table below shows which TV lines will contain picture information when letterbox pictures are displayed on either 1.33:1 or 1.78:1 screens.
==Pillar-boxing and window-boxing==

Pillar-boxing is the display of an image within a wider image frame by adding lateral mattes (vertical bars at the sides); for example, a 1.33:1 image has lateral mattes when displayed on a 16:9 aspect ratio television screen.

An alternative to pillar-boxing is &quot;tilt-and-scan&quot; (like pan and scan, but vertical), horizontally matting the original 1.33:1 television images to the 1.78:1 aspect ratio. At any given moment this crops part of the top and/or bottom of the frame, hence the need for the &quot;tilt&quot; component. A tilt is a camera move in which the camera tilts up or down, or in this case a selection of the upper and/or lower part of the image to omit.

Window-boxing occurs when an image appears centered in a television screen, with blank space on all four sides of the image, such as when a widescreen image that has been previously letter-boxed to fit 1.33:1 is then pillar-boxed to fit 1.78:1. It is also called &quot;matchbox&quot;, &quot;gutter box&quot;, and &quot;postage stamp&quot; display. This occurs on the DVD editions of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; films on a 1.33:1 tv when the included widescreen documentaries show footage from the original series. It is also seen in &quot;The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course&quot;, which displays widescreen pillar-boxing with 1.85:1 scenes in a 2.40:1 frame that is subsequently letter-boxed. It is common to see window-boxed commercials on tv networks, because many commercials are shot in 1.78:1 but distributed to networks in non-widescreen, letter-boxed to fit 1.33:1.

<doc id="17874" wikidata="Q39888" url="?curid=17874" title="Ligament">
<text>A ligament is the fibrous connective tissue that connects bones to other bones. It also connects flight feathers to bones, in dinosaurs and birds. All 30,000 species of amniotes (land animals with internal bones) have ligaments. 

It is also known as &quot;articular ligament&quot;, &quot;articular larua&quot;, &quot;fibrous ligament&quot;, or &quot;true ligament&quot;.

==Comparative anatomy==
Ligaments are similar to tendons and fasciae as they are all made of connective tissue. The differences among them are in the connections that they make: ligaments connect one bone to another bone, tendons connect muscle to bone, and fasciae connect muscles to other muscles. These are all found in the skeletal system of the human body. Ligaments cannot usually be regenerated naturally; however, there are periodontal ligament stem cells located near the periodontal ligament which are involved in the adult regeneration of periodontist ligament.

The study of ligaments is known as .

==Humans==
Other ligaments in the body include the:
* Peritoneal ligament: a fold of peritoneum or other membranes.
* Fetal remnant ligament: the remnants of a fetal tubular structure.
* Periodontal ligament: a group of fibers that attach the cementum of teeth to the surrounding alveolar bone.
==Articular ligaments ==

&quot;Ligament&quot; most commonly refers to a band of dense regular connective tissue bundles made of collagenous fibers, with bundles protected by dense irregular connective tissue sheaths. Ligaments connect bones to other bones to form joints, while tendons connect bone to muscle. Some ligaments limit the mobility of articulations or prevent certain movements altogether.

Capsular ligaments are part of the articular capsule that surrounds synovial joints. They act as mechanical reinforcements. Extra-capsular ligaments join in harmony with the other ligaments and provide joint stability. Intra-capsular ligaments, which are much less common, also provide stability but permit a far larger range of motion. Cruciate ligaments are paired ligaments in the form of a cross.

Ligaments are viscoelastic. They gradually strain when under tension and return to their original shape when the tension is removed. However, they cannot retain their original shape when extended past a certain point or for a prolonged period of time. This is one reason why dislocated joints must be set as quickly as possible: if the ligaments lengthen too much, then the joint will be weakened, becoming prone to future dislocations. Athletes, gymnasts, dancers, and martial artists perform stretching exercises to lengthen their ligaments, making their joints more supple.

The term &quot;hypermobility&quot; refers to the characteristic of people with more-elastic ligaments, allowing their joints to stretch and contort further; this is sometimes still called &quot;double-jointedness&quot;.
The consequence of a broken ligament can be instability of the joint. Not all broken ligaments need surgery, but, if surgery is needed to stabilise the joint, the broken ligament can be repaired. Scar tissue may prevent this. If it is not possible to fix the broken ligament, other procedures such as the Brunelli procedure can correct the instability. Instability of a joint can over time lead to wear of the cartilage and eventually to osteoarthritis.

=== Artificial ligaments ===
One of the most often torn ligaments in the body is the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The ACL is one of the ligaments crucial to knee stability and persons who tear their ACL often undergo reconstructive surgery, which can be done through a variety of techniques and materials. One of these techniques is the replacement of the ligament with an artificial material. Artificial ligaments are a synthetic material composed of a polymer, such as polyacrylonitrile fiber, polypropylene, PET (polyethylene terephthalate), or polyNaSS poly (sodium styrene sulfonate).

=== Examples ===
There are about 900 ligaments in an average adult human body, of which about 25 are listed here.
==Peritoneal ligaments==
Certain folds of peritoneum are referred to as &quot;ligaments&quot;. Examples include:
* The hepatoduodenal ligament, that surrounds the hepatic portal vein and other vessels as they travel from the duodenum to the liver.
* The broad ligament of the uterus, also a fold of peritoneum.

==Fetal remnant ligaments==
Certain tubular structures from the fetal period are referred to as &quot;ligaments&quot; after they close up and turn into cord-like structures:

==See also== 
* Ligamentous laxity
* Broström procedure

<text>The Loch Ness Monster (), known affectionately as Nessie, is a mythical creature in Scottish folklore that is said to inhabit Loch Ness in the Scottish Highlands. It is often described as large, long-necked, and with one or more humps protruding from the water. Popular interest and belief in the creature has varied since it was brought to worldwide attention in 1933. Evidence of its existence is anecdotal, with a number of disputed photographs and sonar readings.

The scientific community explains alleged sightings of the Loch Ness Monster as hoaxes, wishful thinking, and the misidentification of mundane objects. The pseudoscience and subculture of cryptozoology has placed particular emphasis on the creature.
==Origin of the name==
In August 1933, the &quot;Courier&quot; published the account of George Spicer&#x27;s alleged sighting. Public interest skyrocketed, with countless letters being sent in detailing different sightings describing a &quot;monster fish,&quot; &quot;sea serpent,&quot; or &quot;dragon,&quot; with the final name ultimately settling on &quot;Loch Ness monster.&quot; Since the 1940s, the creature has been affectionately called Nessie ().

==Sightings==

=== Early precursors ===

==== Saint Columba (565) ====
The earliest report of a monster in the vicinity of Loch Ness appears in the &quot;Life of St. Columba&quot; by Adomnán, written in the 7th century AD. According to Adomnán, writing about a century after the events described, Irish monk Saint Columba was staying in the land of the Picts with his companions when he encountered local residents burying a man by the River Ness. They explained that the man was swimming in the river when he was attacked by a &quot;water beast&quot; that mauled him and dragged him underwater despite their attempts to rescue him by boat. Columba sent a follower, Luigne moccu Min, to swim across the river. The beast approached him, but Columba made the sign of the cross and said: &quot;Go no further. Do not touch the man. Go back at once.&quot; The creature stopped as if it had been &quot;pulled back with ropes&quot; and fled, and Columba&#x27;s men and the Picts gave thanks for what they perceived as a miracle.

Believers in the monster point to this story, set in the River Ness rather than the loch itself, as evidence for the creature&#x27;s existence as early as the 6th century. Skeptics question the narrative&#x27;s reliability, noting that water-beast stories were extremely common in medieval hagiographies, and Adomnán&#x27;s tale probably recycles a common motif attached to a local landmark. According to skeptics, Adomnán&#x27;s story may be independent of the modern Loch Ness Monster legend and became attached to it by proximity and by believers seeking to bolster their claims. Ronald Binns considers that this is the most serious of various alleged early sightings of the monster, but all other claimed sightings before 1933 are dubious and do not prove a monster tradition before that date. Christopher Cairney uses a specific historical and cultural analysis of Adomnán to separate Adomnán&#x27;s story about St. Columba from the modern myth of the Loch Ness Monster, but finds an earlier and culturally significant use of Celtic &quot;water beast&quot; folklore along the way. In doing so he also discredits any strong connection between kelpies or water-horses and the modern &quot;media-augmented&quot; creation of the Loch Ness Monster. He also concludes that the story of Saint Columba may have been impacted by earlier Irish myths about the Caoránach and an Oilliphéist.

==== D. Mackenzie (1871 or 1872) ====
In October 1871 (or 1872), D. Mackenzie of Balnain reportedly saw an object resembling a log or an upturned boat &quot;wriggling and churning up the water,&quot; moving slowly at first before disappearing at a faster speed. The account was not published until 1934, when Mackenzie sent his story in a letter to Rupert Gould shortly after popular interest in the monster increased.

==== Alexander Macdonald (1888) ====
In 1888, mason Alexander Macdonald of Abriachan sighted &quot;a large stubby-legged animal&quot; surfacing from the loch and propelling itself within of the shore where Macdonald stood. Macdonald reported his sighting to Loch Ness water bailiff Alex Campbell, and described the creature as looking like a salamander.

=== Aldie Mackay (1933) ===
The best-known article that first attracted a great deal of attention about a creature was published on 2 May 1933 in &quot;The Inverness Courier&quot;, about a large &quot;beast&quot; or &quot;whale-like fish&quot;. The article by Alex Campbell, water bailiff for Loch Ness and a part-time journalist, discussed a sighting by Aldie Mackay of an enormous creature with the body of a whale rolling in the water in the loch while she and her husband John were driving on the A82 on 15 April 1933. The word &quot;monster&quot; was reportedly applied for the first time in Campbell&#x27;s article, although some reports claim that it was coined by editor Evan Barron.

&quot;The Courier&quot; in 2017 published excerpts from the Campbell article, which had been titled &quot;Strange Spectacle in Loch Ness&quot;. &quot;The creature disported itself, rolling and plunging for fully a minute, its body resembling that of a whale, and the water cascading and churning like a simmering cauldron. Soon, however, it disappeared in a boiling mass of foam. Both onlookers confessed that there was something uncanny about the whole thing, for they realised that here was no ordinary denizen of the depths, because, apart from its enormous size, the beast, in taking the final plunge, sent out waves that were big enough to have been caused by a passing steamer.&quot;

According to a 2013 article, Mackay said that she had yelled, &quot;Stop! The Beast!&quot; when viewing the spectacle. In the late 1980s, a naturalist interviewed Aldie Mackay and she admitted to knowing that there had been an oral tradition of a &quot;beast&quot; in the loch well before her claimed sighting. Alex Campbell&#x27;s 1933 article also stated that &quot;Loch Ness has for generations been credited with being the home of a fearsome-looking monster&quot;.

===George Spicer (1933)===
Modern interest in the monster was sparked by a sighting on 22 July 1933, when George Spicer and his wife saw &quot;a most extraordinary form of animal&quot; cross the road in front of their car. They described the creature as having a large body (about high and long) and a long, wavy, narrow neck, slightly thicker than an elephant&#x27;s trunk and as long as the width of the road. They saw no limbs. It lurched across the road toward the loch away, leaving a trail of broken undergrowth in its wake. Spicer described it as &quot;the nearest approach to a dragon or pre-historic animal that I have ever seen in my life,&quot; and as having &quot;a long neck, which moved up and down in the manner of a scenic railway.&quot; It had &quot;an animal&quot; in its mouth and had a body that &quot;was fairly big, with a high back, but if there were any feet they must have been of the web kind, and as for a tail I cannot say, as it moved so rapidly, and when we got to the spot it had probably disappeared into the loch.&quot; Though he was the first to describe the creature as a plesiosaur-like dinosaur, evidence suggested by researchers at Columbia University in 2013 proved his story to be fake. The university and Daniel Loxton suggested that Spicer&#x27;s sighting was fictionalized and inspired by a long-necked dinosaur that rises out of a lake in &quot;King Kong&quot;, a film that was extremely popular in theaters in his home city of London during August 1933, when Spicer reported the sighting. Loxton and Donald Prothero later cited &quot;King Kong&quot; as evidently an influence on the Loch Ness Monster myth.

On 4 August 1933 the &quot;Courier&quot; published a report of Spicer&#x27;s sighting. This sighting triggered a massive amount of public interest and an uptick in alleged sightings, leading to the solidification of the actual name &quot;Loch Ness Monster.&quot;

It has been claimed that sightings of the monster increased after a road was built along the loch in early 1933, bringing workers and tourists to the formerly isolated area. However, Binns has described this as &quot;the myth of the lonely loch&quot;, as it was far from isolated before then, due to the construction of the Caledonian Canal. In the 1930s, the existing road by the side of the loch was given a serious upgrade.

===Hugh Gray (1933)===
Hugh Gray&#x27;s photograph taken near Foyers on 12 November 1933 was the first photograph alleged to depict the monster. It was slightly blurred, and it has been noted that if one looks closely the head of a dog can be seen. Gray had taken his Labrador for a walk that day and it is suspected that the photograph depicts his dog fetching a stick from the loch. Others have suggested that the photograph depicts an otter or a swan. The original negative was lost. However, in 1963, Maurice Burton came into &quot;possession of two lantern slides, contact positives from th[e] original negative&quot; and when projected onto a screen they revealed an &quot;otter rolling at the surface in characteristic fashion.&quot;

===Arthur Grant (1934)===
On 5 January 1934 a motorcyclist, Arthur Grant, claimed to have nearly hit the creature while approaching Abriachan (near the north-eastern end of the loch) at about 1 a.m. on a moonlit night. According to Grant, it had a small head attached to a long neck; the creature saw him, and crossed the road back to the loch. Grant, a veterinary student, described it as a cross between a seal and a plesiosaur. He said he dismounted and followed it to the loch, but saw only ripples.

Grant produced a sketch of the creature that was examined by zoologist Maurice Burton, who stated it was consistent with the appearance and behavior of an otter. Regarding the long size of the creature reported by Grant, it has been suggested that this was a faulty observation due to the poor light conditions. Paleontologist Darren Naish has suggested that Grant may have seen either an otter or a seal and exaggerated his sighting over time.

===&quot;Surgeon&#x27;s photograph&quot; (1934)===

The &quot;surgeon&#x27;s photograph&quot; is perhaps the most famous alleged photo of the creature, and the first to portray its head and neck. It is attributed to Robert Kenneth Wilson, a London gynaecologist. On April 20, 1934, multiple British newspapers reported Wilson&#x27;s claim to have seen the monster while driving near Loch Ness the day before, but the stories do not mention the existence of a photograph. &quot;Dr. Wilson described the monster as having a small head and a swan-like neck protruding three feet above the surface of the water,&quot; the &quot;Western Morning News&quot; reported.

The following day, April 21, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; announced it has purchased exclusive rights to a photo it attributed to &quot;Mr. Robert Kenneth Wilson, M.A., M.B., Ch.B.Camb., F.R.C.S., of Queen Anne-street, W., who has been touring the Loch Ness countryside.&quot; Along with the photo, it ran an interview with Wilson about &quot;his remarkable luck in being able to secure such a photograph.&quot; Wilson said he was looking at the loch when he saw the monster, grabbed his camera, and snapped four photos. Only two exposures came out clearly; the first reportedly shows a small head and back, and the second shows a similar head in a diving position. The first photo became well known, and the second attracted little publicity because of its blurriness.

For 60 years, the photo was considered evidence of the monster&#x27;s existence, although skeptics dismissed it as driftwood, an elephant, an otter or a bird. The photo&#x27;s scale was controversial; it is often shown cropped (making the creature seem large and the ripples like waves), while the uncropped shot shows the other end of the loch and the monster in the centre. The ripples in the photo were found to fit the size and pattern of small ripples, rather than large waves photographed up close. Analysis of the original image fostered further doubt. In 1993, the makers of the Discovery Communications documentary &quot;Loch Ness Discovered&quot; analyzed the uncropped image and found a white object visible in every version of the photo (implying that it was on the negative). It was believed to be the cause of the ripples, as if the object was being towed, although the possibility of a blemish on the negative could not be ruled out. An analysis of the full photograph indicated that the object was small, about long.

Since 1994, most agree that the photo was an elaborate hoax. It had been described as fake in a 7 December 1975 &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; article that fell into obscurity. Details of how the photo was taken were published in the 1999 book, &quot;Nessie – the Surgeon&#x27;s Photograph Exposed&quot;, which contains a facsimile of the 1975 &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; article. The creature was reportedly a toy submarine built by Christian Spurling, the son-in-law of actor, screenwriter, director, producer, and -- perhaps most saliently -- big-game hunter M. A. Wetherell. Spurling admitted the photograph was a hoax in January 1991. Wetherell had been publicly ridiculed by his employer, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, after he found &quot;Nessie footprints&quot; that turned out to be a hoax. To get revenge on the &quot;Mail&quot;, Wetherell perpetrated his hoax with co-conspirators Spurling (sculpture specialist), Ian Colin Marmaduke Wetherell (his son, himself a future actor, who bought the material for the fake), and Maurice Chambers (an insurance agent). 

The toy submarine was bought from F. W. Woolworth, and its head and neck were made from wood putty. After testing it in a local pond the group went to Loch Ness, where Ian Marmaduke Wetherell took the photos near the Altsaigh Tea House. When they heard a water bailiff approaching, Wetherell sank the model with his foot and it is &quot;presumably still somewhere in Loch Ness&quot;. Chambers gave the photographic plates to Wilson, a friend of his who enjoyed &quot;a good practical joke&quot;. Wilson brought the plates to Ogston&#x27;s, an Inverness chemist, and gave them to George Morrison for development. He sold the first photo to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, who then announced that the monster had been photographed.

Little is known of the second photo; it is often ignored by researchers, who believe its quality too poor and its differences from the first photo too great to warrant analysis. It shows a head similar to the first photo, with a more turbulent wave pattern, and possibly taken at a different time and location in the loch. Some believe it to be an earlier, cruder attempt at a hoax, and others (including Roy Mackal and Maurice Burton) consider it a picture of a diving bird or otter that Wilson mistook for the monster. According to Morrison, when the plates were developed, Wilson was uninterested in the second photo; he allowed Morrison to keep the negative, and the photo was rediscovered years later. When asked about the second photo by the &quot;Ness Information Service Newsletter&quot;, Spurling &quot;... was vague, thought it might have been a piece of wood they were trying out as a monster, but [was] not sure.&quot;

===Taylor film (1938)===
On 29 May 1938, South African tourist G. E. Taylor filmed something in the loch for three minutes on 16 mm colour film. The film was obtained by popular science writer Maurice Burton, who did not show it to other researchers. A single frame was published in his 1961 book, &quot;The Elusive Monster&quot;. His analysis concluded it was a floating object, not an animal.

===William Fraser (1938)===
On 15 August 1938, William Fraser, chief constable of Inverness-shire, wrote a letter that the monster existed beyond doubt and expressed concern about a hunting party that had arrived (with a custom-made harpoon gun) determined to catch the monster &quot;dead or alive&quot;. He believed his power to protect the monster from the hunters was &quot;very doubtful&quot;. The letter was released by the National Archives of Scotland on 27 April 2010.

===Sonar readings (1954)===
In December 1954, sonar readings were taken by the fishing boat &quot;Rival III&quot;. Its crew noted a large object keeping pace with the vessel at a depth of . It was detected for before contact was lost and regained. Previous sonar attempts were inconclusive or negative.

===Peter MacNab (1955)===

Peter MacNab at Urquhart Castle on 29 July 1955 took a photograph that depicted two long black humps in the water. The photograph was not made public until it appeared in Constance Whyte&#x27;s 1957 book on the subject. On 23 October 1958 it was published by the &quot;Weekly Scotsman&quot;. Author Ronald Binns wrote that the &quot;phenomenon which MacNab photographed could easily be a wave effect resulting from three trawlers travelling closely together up the loch.&quot;

Other researchers consider the photograph a hoax. Roy Mackal requested to use the photograph in his 1976 book. He received the original negative from MacNab, but discovered it differed from the photograph that appeared in Whyte&#x27;s book. The tree at the bottom left in Whyte&#x27;s was missing from the negative. It is suspected that the photograph was doctored by re-photographing a print.

===Dinsdale film (1960)===
Aeronautical engineer Tim Dinsdale filmed what he believed to be a dark hump that left a wake crossing Loch Ness on 23 April 1960. Dinsdale, who reportedly had the sighting on his final day of search, described it as mahogany red with a blotch on its side when viewed through binoculars. He said that when he mounted his camera the object began to move, and he shot of film. According to the Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre (JARIC) who published a 1966 report analyzing the film, the object was &quot;probably animate&quot;. After the film, Dinsdale continued to pursue finding the Loch Ness Monster but while he claimed to have had additional sightings he was unable to produce more photographic evidence.

In 1993, Discovery Communications produced a documentary, &quot;Loch Ness Discovered&quot;, with a digital enhancement of the Dinsdale film. A person who enhanced the film noticed a shadow in the negative that was not obvious in the developed film. By enhancing and overlaying frames, he found what appeared to be the rear body of a creature underwater: &quot;Before I saw the film, I thought the Loch Ness Monster was a load of rubbish. Having done the enhancement, I&#x27;m not so sure.&quot;

However, additional analyses of the Dinsdale film have indicated that his sighting was a case of mistaken identity and that he likely filmed a boat under poor lighting conditions. Although Dinsdale attempted to rule this out by organizing for a fishing boat to sail a similar route later that morning, this comparison was filmed under different lighting conditions, with a white boat. JARIC&#x27;s estimates of the size and speed of the object are now believed to be overestimates, due to miscalculations of the angle of the camera and cuts in the film, and overlaying multiple frames seems to show a pale blob towards the rear end of the object, which appears in multiple frames and matches with the position of the helmsman of a boat as demonstrated in Dinsdale&#x27;s boat comparison. It has also been noted that the object in his film does not actually submerge as often perceived but blends into the greyer reflections on the water. Additionally, Dick Raynor has noted that Dinsdale&#x27;s binoculars were actually a wider field of view than his telephoto camera. Additionally, critics consider the dark shape noticed by the Discovery documentary analysis unlikely to be the shadow or a body underwater due to the low angle of view, and it is more likely to be reflections of the shore behind the object.

Although most researchers do not believe Dinsdale to be a hoaxer, his susceptibility to confirmation bias and trusting dubious sources as evidence has been criticized.

===&quot;Loch Ness Muppet&quot; (1977)===

On 21 May 1977, Anthony &quot;Doc&quot; Shiels, camping next to Urquhart Castle, took what were alleged to be the clearest picture of the monster then available. Shiels, a magician, claimed to have summoned the animal out of the water. He later described it as an &quot;elephant squid&quot;, claiming the long neck shown in the photograph is the squid&#x27;s &quot;trunk&quot; and that a white spot at the base of the neck is its eye. Due to the lack of ripples, it has been declared a hoax by many people and received its name because of its staged look.

===Holmes video (2007)===
On 26 May 2007, 55-year-old laboratory technician Gordon Holmes videotaped what he said was &quot;this jet black thing, about long, moving fairly fast in the water.&quot;, Loch Ness monster watchers described it as among &quot;the best footage ever seen.&quot; BBC Scotland broadcast the video on 29 May 2007. &quot;STV News North Tonight&quot; aired it on 28 May 2007 and interviewed Holmes. Adrian Shine, a marine biologist at the Loch Ness 2000 Centre in Drumnadrochit, suggested that the footage was an otter, seal or water bird.

===Sonar image (2011)===
On 24 August 2011, Loch Ness boat captain Marcus Atkinson photographed a sonar image of a , unidentified object that seemed to follow his boat for two minutes at a depth of and ruled out the possibility of a small fish or seal. In April 2012, a scientist from the National Oceanography Centre said that the image is a bloom of algae and zooplankton.

===George Edwards photograph (2011)===
On 3 August 2012, skipper George Edwards claimed that a photo he took on 2 November 2011 shows &quot;Nessie&quot;. Edwards claims to have searched for the monster for 26 years, and reportedly spent 60 hours per week on the loch aboard his boat, &quot;Nessie Hunter IV&quot;, taking tourists for rides. Edwards said, &quot;In my opinion, it probably looks kind of like a manatee, but not a mammal. When people see three humps, they&#x27;re probably just seeing three separate monsters.&quot;

Other researchers have questioned the photograph&#x27;s authenticity, and Loch Ness researcher Steve Feltham suggested that the object in the water is a fibreglass hump used in a National Geographic Channel documentary in which Edwards had participated. Researcher Dick Raynor has questioned Edwards&#x27; claim of discovering a deeper bottom of Loch Ness, which Raynor calls &quot;Edwards Deep&quot;. He found inconsistencies between Edwards&#x27; claims for the location and conditions of the photograph and the actual location and weather conditions that day. According to Raynor, Edwards told him he had faked a photograph in 1986 that he claimed was genuine in the National Geographic documentary. Although Edwards admitted in October 2013 that his 2011 photograph was a hoax, he insisted that the 1986 photograph was genuine.

A survey of the literature about other supposed sightings, including photographs, published in &quot;The Scientific American&quot; blog network on 10 July 2013, indicates none of them are actual sightings.

===David Elder video (2013)===
On 27 August 2013, tourist David Elder presented a five-minute video of a &quot;mysterious wave&quot; in the loch. According to Elder, the wave was produced by a &quot;solid black object&quot; just under the surface of the water. Elder, 50, from East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, was taking a picture of a swan at the Fort Augustus pier on the south-western end of the loch, when he captured the movement. He said, &quot;The water was very still at the time and there were no ripples coming off the wave and no other activity on the water.&quot; Sceptics suggested that the wave may have been caused by a wind gust.

===Apple Maps photograph (2014)===
On 19 April 2014, it was reported that a satellite image on Apple Maps showed what appeared to be a large creature (thought by some to be the Loch Ness Monster) just below the surface of Loch Ness. At the loch&#x27;s far north, the image appeared about long. Possible explanations were the wake of a boat (with the boat itself lost in image stitching or low contrast), seal-caused ripples, or floating wood.

===Drone footage (2021)===
In September 2021, it was reported that a creature was captured on a live-stream near the loch.

==Searches==

===Edward Mountain expedition (1934)===

After reading Rupert Gould&#x27;s &quot;The Loch Ness Monster and Others&quot;, Edward Mountain financed a search. Twenty men with binoculars and cameras positioned themselves around the loch from 9 am to 6 pm for five weeks, beginning on 13 July 1934. Although 21 photographs were taken, none was considered conclusive. Supervisor James Fraser remained by the loch, filming, on 15 September 1934; the film is now lost. Zoologists and professors of natural history concluded that the film showed a seal, possibly a grey seal.

===Loch Ness Phenomena Investigation Bureau (1962–1972)===
The &quot;Loch Ness Phenomena Investigation Bureau&quot; (LNPIB) was a UK-based society formed in 1962 by Norman Collins, R. S. R. Fitter, politician David James, Peter Scott and Constance Whyte &quot;to study Loch Ness to identify the creature known as the Loch Ness Monster or determine the causes of reports of it&quot;. In 1967 it received a grant of $20,000 from World Book Encyclopedia to fund a 2-year programme of daylight watches from May to October. The principal equipment was 35 mm movie cameras on mobile units with 20-inch lenses, and one with a 36-inch lens at Achnahannet, near the midpoint of the loch. With the mobile units in laybys about 80% of the loch surface was covered. The society&#x27;s name was later shortened to the Loch Ness Investigation Bureau (LNIB), and it disbanded in 1972. The LNIB had an annual subscription charge, which covered administration. Its main activity was encouraging groups of self-funded volunteers to watch the loch from vantage points with film cameras with telescopic lenses. From 1965 to 1972 it had a caravan camp and viewing platform at Achnahannet, and sent observers to other locations up and down the loch. According to the bureau&#x27;s 1969 annual report it had 1,030 members, of whom 588 were from the UK.

===Sonar study (1967–1968)===
D. Gordon Tucker, chair of the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering at the University of Birmingham, volunteered his services as a sonar developer and expert at Loch Ness in 1968. His gesture, part of a larger effort led by the LNPIB from 1967 to 1968, involved collaboration between volunteers and professionals in a number of fields. Tucker had chosen Loch Ness as the test site for a prototype sonar transducer with a maximum range of . The device was fixed underwater at Temple Pier in Urquhart Bay and directed at the opposite shore, drawing an acoustic &quot;net&quot; across the loch through which no moving object could pass undetected. During the two-week trial in August, multiple targets were identified. One was probably a shoal of fish, but others moved in a way not typical of shoals at speeds up to 10 knots.

===Robert Rines studies (1972, 1975, 2001, 2008)===
In 1972, a group of researchers from the Academy of Applied Science led by Robert H. Rines conducted a search for the monster involving sonar examination of the loch depths for unusual activity. Rines took precautions to avoid murky water with floating wood and peat. A submersible camera with a floodlight was deployed to record images below the surface. If Rines detected anything on the sonar, he turned the light on and took pictures.

On 8 August, Rines&#x27; Raytheon DE-725C sonar unit, operating at a frequency of 200 kHz and anchored at a depth of , identified a moving target (or targets) estimated by echo strength at in length. Specialists from Raytheon, Simrad (now Kongsberg Maritime), Hydroacoustics, Marty Klein of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Klein Associates (a side-scan sonar producer) and Ira Dyer of MIT&#x27;s Department of Ocean Engineering were on hand to examine the data. P. Skitzki of Raytheon suggested that the data indicated a protuberance projecting from one of the echoes. According to author Roy Mackal, the shape was a &quot;highly flexible laterally flattened tail&quot; or the misinterpreted return from two animals swimming together.

Concurrent with the sonar readings, the floodlit camera obtained a pair of underwater photographs. Both depicted what appeared to be a rhomboid flipper, although sceptics have dismissed the images as depicting the bottom of the loch, air bubbles, a rock, or a fish fin. The apparent flipper was photographed in different positions, indicating movement. The first flipper photo is better-known than the second, and both were enhanced and retouched from the original negatives. According to team member Charles Wyckoff, the photos were retouched to superimpose the flipper; the original enhancement showed a considerably less-distinct object. No one is sure how the originals were altered. During a meeting with Tony Harmsworth and Adrian Shine at the Loch Ness Centre &amp; Exhibition, Rines admitted that the flipper photo may have been retouched by a magazine editor.

British naturalist Peter Scott announced in 1975, on the basis of the photographs, that the creature&#x27;s scientific name would be &quot;Nessiteras rhombopteryx&quot; (Greek for &quot;Ness inhabitant with diamond-shaped fin&quot;). Scott intended that the name would enable the creature to be added to the British register of protected wildlife. Scottish politician Nicholas Fairbairn called the name an anagram for &quot;Monster hoax by Sir Peter S&quot;. However, Rines countered that when rearranged, the letters could also spell &quot;Yes, both pix are monsters – R.&quot;

Another sonar contact was made, this time with two objects estimated to be about . The strobe camera photographed two large objects surrounded by a flurry of bubbles. Some interpreted the objects as two plesiosaur-like animals, suggesting several large animals living in Loch Ness. This photograph has rarely been published.

A second search was conducted by Rines in 1975. Some of the photographs, despite their obviously murky quality and lack of concurrent sonar readings, did indeed seem to show unknown animals in various positions and lightings. One photograph appeared to show the head, neck, and upper torso of a plesiosaur-like animal, but sceptics argue the object is a log due to the lump on its &quot;chest&quot; area, the mass of sediment in the full photo, and the object&#x27;s log-like &quot;skin&quot; texture. Another photograph seemed to depict a horned &quot;gargoyle head&quot;, consistent with that of some sightings of the monster; however, sceptics point out that a tree stump was later filmed during Operation Deepscan in 1987, which bore a striking resemblance to the gargoyle head.

In 2001, Rines&#x27; Academy of Applied Science videotaped a V-shaped wake traversing still water on a calm day. The academy also videotaped an object on the floor of the loch resembling a carcass and found marine clamshells and a fungus-like organism not normally found in freshwater lochs, a suggested connection to the sea and a possible entry for the creature.

In 2008, Rines theorised that the creature may have become extinct, citing the lack of significant sonar readings and a decline in eyewitness accounts. He undertook a final expedition, using sonar and an underwater camera in an attempt to find a carcass. Rines believed that the animals may have failed to adapt to temperature changes resulting from global warming.

===Operation Deepscan (1987)===
Operation Deepscan was conducted in 1987. Twenty-four boats equipped with echo sounding equipment were deployed across the width of the loch, and simultaneously sent acoustic waves. According to BBC News the scientists had made sonar contact with an unidentified object of unusual size and strength. The researchers returned, re-scanning the area. Analysis of the echosounder images seemed to indicate debris at the bottom of the loch, although there was motion in three of the pictures. Adrian Shine speculated, based on size, that they might be seals that had entered the loch.

Sonar expert Darrell Lowrance, founder of Lowrance Electronics, donated a number of echosounder units used in the operation. After examining a sonar return indicating a large, moving object at a depth of near Urquhart Bay, Lowrance said: &quot;There&#x27;s something here that we don&#x27;t understand, and there&#x27;s something here that&#x27;s larger than a fish, maybe some species that hasn&#x27;t been detected before. I don&#x27;t know.&quot;

===&quot;Searching for the Loch Ness Monster&quot; (2003)===
In 2003, the BBC sponsored a search of the loch using 600 sonar beams and satellite tracking. The search had sufficient resolution to identify a small buoy. No animal of substantial size was found and, despite their reported hopes, the scientists involved admitted that this proved the Loch Ness Monster was a myth. &quot;Searching for the Loch Ness Monster&quot; aired on BBC One.

=== Adrian Shine and Kongsberg Maritime (2016) ===
Adrian Shine of The Loch Ness Project and VisitScotland supported a survey of the Loch using an underwater robot operated by Kongsberg Maritime. While investigating the depths of the loch, they found the resting place of a Nessie prop created for Billy Wilder&#x27;s 1970 film &quot;The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. Wally Veevers had designed the prop initially with a neck and two humps but Wilder disliked the humps and ordered them removed. This change altered the buoyancy and the prop promptly sank into the loch during a filming test.

===DNA survey (2018)===
An international team consisting of researchers from the universities of Otago, Copenhagen, Hull and the Highlands and Islands, did a DNA survey of the lake in June 2018, looking for unusual species. The results were published in 2019; no DNA of large fish such as sharks, sturgeons and catfish could be found. No otter or seal DNA were obtained either, though there was a lot of eel DNA. The leader of the study, Prof Neil Gemmell of the University of Otago, said he could not rule out the possibility of eels of extreme size, though none were found, nor were any ever caught. The other possibility is that the large amount of eel DNA simply comes from many small eels. No evidence of any reptilian sequences were found, he added, &quot;so I think we can be fairly sure that there is probably not a giant scaly reptile swimming around in Loch Ness&quot;.

===High-Tech 2023 90th Anniversary Search===
In August 2023, a weekend of high-tech searching was done in observance of the 90th anniversary of the 1933 Aldie Mackay sighting. The event was coordinated by Loch Ness Exploration volunteers in collaboration with the Loch Ness visitor’s centre. The technology used included &quot;sonar for mapping the loch bed; thermal imaging drones to scan the surface; and hydrophones (underwater microphones)&quot; which did record some sounds, but were &quot;probably ducks&quot;. Despite a large turnout of searchers onsite and hundreds more viewing Internet livestream cameras pointed at the loch, there were no conclusive sightings.

==Explanations==
A number of explanations have been suggested to account for sightings of the creature. According to Ronald Binns, a former member of the Loch Ness Phenomena Investigation Bureau, there is probably no single explanation of the monster. Binns wrote two sceptical books, the 1983 &quot;The Loch Ness Mystery Solved&quot;, and his 2017 &quot;The Loch Ness Mystery Reloaded&quot;. In these he contends that an aspect of human psychology is the ability of the eye to see what it wants, and expects, to see. They may be categorised as misidentifications of known animals, misidentifications of inanimate objects or effects, reinterpretations of Scottish folklore, hoaxes, and exotic species of large animals. A reviewer wrote that Binns had &quot;evolved into the author of ... the definitive, skeptical book on the subject&quot;. Binns does not call the sightings a hoax, but &quot;a myth in the true sense of the term&quot; and states that the &quot;&#x27;monster is a sociological ... phenomenon. ...After 1983 the search ... (for the) possibility that there just &quot;might&quot; be continues to enthrall a small number for whom eye-witness evidence outweighs all other considerations&quot;.

===Misidentification of known animals===

====Eels====
A large European eel was an early suggestion for what the &quot;monster&quot; was. Eels are found in Loch Ness, and an unusually large one would explain many sightings. Dinsdale dismissed the hypothesis because eels undulate side to side like snakes. Sightings in 1856 of a &quot;sea-serpent&quot; (or kelpie) in a freshwater lake near Leurbost in the Outer Hebrides were explained as those of an oversized eel, also believed common in &quot;Highland lakes&quot;.

From 2018 to 2019, scientists from New Zealand undertook a massive project to document every organism in Loch Ness based on DNA samples. Their reports confirmed that European eels are still found in the Loch. No DNA samples were found for large animals such as catfish, Greenland sharks, or plesiosaurs. Many scientists now believe that giant eels account for many, if not most of the sightings.

====Elephant====
In a 1979 article, California biologist Dennis Power and geographer Donald Johnson claimed that the &quot;surgeon&#x27;s photograph&quot; was the top of the head, extended trunk and flared nostrils of a swimming elephant photographed elsewhere and claimed to be from Loch Ness. In 2006, palaeontologist and artist Neil Clark suggested that travelling circuses might have allowed elephants to bathe in the loch; the trunk could be the perceived head and neck, with the head and back the perceived humps. In support of this, Clark provided an example painting.

====Greenland shark====
Zoologist, angler and television presenter Jeremy Wade investigated the creature in 2013 as part of the series &quot;River Monsters&quot;, and concluded that it is a Greenland shark. The Greenland shark, which can reach up to 20 feet in length, inhabits the North Atlantic Ocean around Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, and possibly Scotland. It is dark in colour, with a small dorsal fin. According to biologist Bruce Wright, the Greenland shark could survive in fresh water (possibly using rivers and lakes to find food) and Loch Ness has an abundance of salmon and other fish.

====Wels catfish====
In July 2015 three news outlets reported that Steve Feltham, after a vigil at the loch that was recognized by the Guinness Book of Records, theorised that the monster is an unusually large specimen of Wels catfish (&quot;Silurus glanis&quot;), which may have been released during the late 19th century.

====Other resident animals====
It is difficult to judge the size of an object in water through a telescope or binoculars with no external reference. Loch Ness has resident otters, and photos of them and deer swimming in the loch, which were cited by author Ronald Binns, may have been misinterpreted. According to Binns, birds may be mistaken for a &quot;head and neck&quot; sighting.

===Misidentifications of inanimate objects or effects===

====Boat wakes====
Wakes have been reported when the loch is calm, with no boats nearby. Bartender David Munro reported a wake he believed was a creature zigzagging, diving, and reappearing; there were reportedly 26 other witnesses from a nearby car park. Although some sightings describe a V-shaped wake similar to a boat&#x27;s, others report something not conforming to the shape of a boat.

====Trees====
In 1933, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; published a picture with the caption: &quot;This queerly-shaped tree-trunk, washed ashore at Foyers [on Loch Ness] may, it is thought, be responsible for the reported appearance of a &#x27;Monster. 

In a 1982 series of articles for &quot;New Scientist&quot;, Maurice Burton proposed that sightings of Nessie and similar creatures may be fermenting Scots pine logs rising to the surface of the loch. A decomposing log could not initially release gases caused by decay because of its high resin level. Gas pressure would eventually rupture a resin seal at one end of the log, propelling it through the water (sometimes to the surface). According to Burton, the shape of tree logs (with their branch stumps) closely resembles descriptions of the monster.

====Seiches and wakes====
Loch Ness, because of its long, straight shape, is subject to unusual ripples affecting its surface. A seiche is a large oscillation of a lake, caused by water reverting to its natural level after being blown to one end of the lake (resulting in a standing wave); the Loch Ness oscillation period is 31.5 minutes. Earthquakes in Scotland are too weak to cause observable seiches, but extremely massive earthquakes far away could cause large waves. The seiche created in Loch Ness by the catastrophic 1755 Lisbon earthquake was reportedly &quot;so violent as to threaten destruction to some houses built on the sides of it&quot;, while the 1761 aftershock caused two-foot (60 cm) waves. However, no sightings of the monster were reported in 1755.

====Optical effects====
Wind conditions can give a choppy, matt appearance to the water with calm patches appearing dark from the shore (reflecting the mountains and clouds). In 1979, W. H. Lehn showed that atmospheric refraction could distort the shape and size of objects and animals, and later published a photograph of a mirage of a rock on Lake Winnipeg that resembled a head and neck.

====Seismic gas====
Italian geologist Luigi Piccardi has proposed geological explanations for ancient legends and myths. Piccardi noted that in the earliest recorded sighting of a creature (the &quot;Life of Saint Columba&quot;), the creature&#x27;s emergence was accompanied &quot;cum ingenti fremitu&quot; (&quot;with loud roaring&quot;). The Loch Ness is along the Great Glen Fault, and this could be a description of an earthquake. Many reports consist only of a large disturbance on the surface of the water; this could be a release of gas through the fault, although it may be mistaken for something swimming below the surface.

===Folklore===
In 1980 Swedish naturalist and author Bengt Sjögren wrote that present beliefs in lake monsters such as the Loch Ness Monster are associated with kelpie legends. According to Sjögren, accounts of loch monsters have changed over time; originally describing horse-like creatures, they were intended to keep children away from the loch. Sjögren wrote that the kelpie legends have developed into descriptions reflecting a modern awareness of plesiosaurs.

The kelpie as a water horse in Loch Ness was mentioned in an 1879 Scottish newspaper, and inspired Tim Dinsdale&#x27;s &quot;Project Water Horse&quot;. A study of pre-1933 Highland folklore references to kelpies, water horses and water bulls indicated that Ness was the loch most frequently cited.

===Hoaxes===
A number of hoax attempts have been made, some of which were successful. Other hoaxes were revealed rather quickly by the perpetrators or exposed after diligent research. A few examples follow.

In August 1933, Italian journalist Francesco Gasparini submitted what he said was the first news article on the Loch Ness Monster. In 1959, he reported sighting a &quot;strange fish&quot; and fabricated eyewitness accounts: &quot;I had the inspiration to get hold of the item about the strange fish. The idea of the monster had never dawned on me, but then I noted that the strange fish would not yield a long article, and I decided to promote the imaginary being to the rank of monster without further ado.&quot;

In the 1930s, big-game hunter Marmaduke Wetherell went to Loch Ness to look for the monster. Wetherell claimed to have found footprints, but when casts of the footprints were sent to scientists for analysis they turned out to be from a hippopotamus; a prankster had used a hippopotamus-foot umbrella stand.

In 1972, a team of zoologists from Yorkshire&#x27;s Flamingo Park Zoo, searching for the monster, discovered a large body floating in the water. The corpse, long and weighing as much as 1.5 tonnes, was described by the Press Association as having &quot;a bear&#x27;s head and a brown scaly body with clawlike fins.&quot; The creature was placed in a van to be carried away for testing, but police seized the cadaver under an act of parliament prohibiting the removal of &quot;unidentified creatures&quot; from Loch Ness. It was later revealed that Flamingo Park education officer John Shields shaved the whiskers and otherwise disfigured a bull elephant seal that had died the week before and dumped it in Loch Ness to dupe his colleagues.

On 2 July 2003, Gerald McSorely discovered a fossil, supposedly from the creature, when he tripped and fell into the loch. After examination, it was clear that the fossil had been planted.
In 2004, a Five TV documentary team, using cinematic special-effects experts, tried to convince people that there was something in the loch. They constructed an animatronic model of a plesiosaur, calling it &quot;Lucy&quot;. Despite setbacks (including Lucy falling to the bottom of the loch), about 600 sightings were reported where she was placed.

In 2005, two students claimed to have found a large tooth embedded in the body of a deer on the loch shore. They publicised the find, setting up a website, but expert analysis soon revealed that the &quot;tooth&quot; was the antler of a muntjac. The tooth was a publicity stunt to promote a horror novel by Steve Alten, &quot;The Loch.&quot;

===Exotic large-animal species===
====Plesiosaur====

In 1933, it was suggested that the creature &quot;bears a striking resemblance to the supposedly extinct plesiosaur&quot;, a long-necked aquatic reptile that became extinct during the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. A popular explanation at the time, the following arguments have been made against it:
* In an October 2006 &quot;New Scientist&quot; article, &quot;Why the Loch Ness Monster is no plesiosaur&quot;, Leslie Noè of the Sedgwick Museum in Cambridge said: &quot;The osteology of the neck makes it absolutely certain that the plesiosaur could not lift its head up swan-like out of the water&quot;.
* The loch is only about 10,000 years old, dating to the end of the last ice age. Before then, it was frozen for about 20,000 years.
* If creatures similar to plesiosaurs lived in Loch Ness they would be seen frequently, since they would have to surface several times a day to breathe.
* Due to the lack of plankton, there is not enough food in Loch Ness to sustain a family of Plesiosaurs.

In response to these criticisms, Tim Dinsdale, Peter Scott and Roy Mackal postulate a trapped marine creature that evolved from a plesiosaur directly or by convergent evolution. Robert Rines explained that the &quot;horns&quot; in some sightings function as breathing tubes (or nostrils), allowing it to breathe without breaking the surface. Newer discoveries of plesiosaurs such as Leptocleididae could handle fresh water, along with Morturneria which thrived in Antarctic waters. While this supports the idea that a Plesiosaur could handle the environment of Loch Ness, it doesn&#x27;t support the idea that Nessie is one.

====Long-necked giant amphibian====
R. T. Gould suggested a long-necked newt; Roy Mackal examined the possibility, giving it the highest score (88 percent) on his list of possible candidates.

====Invertebrate====
In 1968 F. W. Holiday proposed that Nessie and other lake monsters, such as Morag, may be a large invertebrate such as a bristleworm; he cited the extinct &quot;Tullimonstrum&quot; as an example of the shape. According to Holiday, this explains the land sightings and the variable back shape; he likened it to the medieval description of dragons as &quot;worms&quot;. Although this theory was considered by Mackal, he found it less convincing than eels, amphibians or plesiosaurs.

<text>Laser science or laser physics is a branch of optics that describes the theory and practice of lasers.

Laser science is principally concerned with quantum electronics, laser construction, optical cavity design, the physics of producing a population inversion in laser media, and the temporal evolution of the light field in the laser. It is also concerned with the physics of laser beam propagation, particularly the physics of Gaussian beams, with laser applications, and with associated fields such as nonlinear optics and quantum optics.

==History==

Laser science predates the invention of the laser itself. Albert Einstein created the foundations for the laser and maser in 1917, via a paper in which he re-derived Max Planck’s law of radiation using a formalism based on probability coefficients (Einstein coefficients) for the absorption, spontaneous emission, and stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation. The existence of stimulated emission was confirmed in 1928 by Rudolf W. Ladenburg. In 1939, Valentin A. Fabrikant made the earliest laser proposal. He specified the conditions required for light amplification using stimulated emission. In 1947, Willis E. Lamb and R. C. Retherford found apparent stimulated emission in hydrogen spectra and effected the first demonstration of stimulated emission; in 1950, Alfred Kastler (Nobel Prize for Physics 1966) proposed the method of optical pumping, experimentally confirmed, two years later, by Brossel, Kastler, and Winter.

The theoretical principles describing the operation of a microwave laser (a maser) were first described by Nikolay Basov and Alexander Prokhorov at the &quot;All-Union Conference on Radio Spectroscopy&quot; in May 1952. The first maser was built by Charles H. Townes, James P. Gordon, and Herbert J. Zeiger in 1953. Townes, Basov and Prokhorov were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1964 for their research in the field of stimulated emission. Arthur Ashkin, Gérard Mourou, and Donna Strickland were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2018 for groundbreaking inventions in the field of laser physics.

The first working laser (a pulsed ruby laser) was demonstrated on May 16, 1960, by Theodore Maiman at the Hughes Research Laboratories.

<text>Lincoln () is a cathedral city and district in Lincolnshire, England, of which it is the county town. In the 2021 Census, the city&#x27;s district had a population of 103,813. The 2021 census gave the urban area of Lincoln, including Bracebridge Heath, North Hykeham, South Hykeham and Waddington, a recorded population of 127,540.

Roman &quot;Lindum Colonia&quot; developed from an Iron Age settlement of Britons on the River Witham, near the Fosse Way road. Over time its name was shortened to Lincoln, after successive settlements, including by Anglo-Saxons and Danes. Landmarks include Lincoln Cathedral (English Gothic architecture; for over 200 years the world&#x27;s tallest building) and the 11th-century Norman Lincoln Castle. The city hosts the University of Lincoln, Bishop Grosseteste University, Lincoln City F.C. and Lincoln United F.C. Lincoln is the largest settlement in Lincolnshire, with the towns of Grimsby second largest and Scunthorpe third.

==History==
===Earliest history===
The earliest origins of Lincoln can be traced to remains of an Iron Age settlement of round wooden dwellings, discovered by archaeologists in 1972, which have been dated to the 1st century BCE. It was built by Brayford Pool on the River Witham at the foot of a large hill, on which the Normans later built Lincoln Cathedral and Lincoln Castle.

The name Lincoln may come from this period, when the settlement is thought to have been named in the Brittonic language of Iron Age Britain&#x27;s Celtic inhabitants as &quot;Lindon&quot;, &quot;The Pool&quot;, presumably referring to Brayford Pool (compare the etymology of Dublin, from the Gaelic &quot;dubh linn&quot; &quot;black pool&quot;). The extent of the original settlement is unknown, as its remains are buried beneath the later Roman and medieval ruins and modern Lincoln.

===Lindum Colonia===
The Romans conquered this part of Britain in 48 CE and soon built a legionary fortress high on a hill overlooking the natural lake, Brayford Pool, formed by the widening of the River Witham, and the northern end of the Fosse Way Roman road (A46). Celtic &quot;Lindon&quot; was later Latinised to &quot;Lindum&quot; and the title &quot;Colonia&quot; added when it became settled by army veterans.

The conversion to a &quot;colonia&quot; occurred when the legion moved on to York (&quot;Eboracum&quot;) in 71 CE. Lindum colonia or more fully, Colonia Domitiana Lindensium, after the then Emperor Domitian, was set up within the walls of the hilltop fortress by extending it with about an equal area, down the hillside to the waterside.

It became a flourishing settlement accessible from the sea through the River Trent and through the River Witham. On the basis of a patently corrupt list of British bishops said to have attended the 314 Council of Arles, the city is often seen as having been the capital of the province of Flavia Caesariensis, formed during the late 3rd-century Diocletian Reforms. Subsequently, the town and its waterways declined. By the close of the 5th century, it was largely deserted, although some occupation continued under a &quot;Praefectus Civitatis&quot; – Saint Paulinus visited a man holding this office in Lincoln in 629 CE.

===Lincylene===

Germanic tribes from the North Sea area settled Lincolnshire in the 5th to 6th centuries. The Latin &quot;Lindum Colonia&quot; shrank in Old English to Lindocolina, then to Lincylene.

After the first Viking raids, the city again rose to some importance with overseas trading ties. In Viking times Lincoln had its own mint, by far the most important in Lincolnshire and by the end of the 10th century, comparable in output to that of York. After establishment of the Danelaw in 886, Lincoln became one of the Five East Midland Boroughs. Excavations at Flaxengate reveal that an area deserted since Roman times received timber-framed buildings fronting a new street system in about 900. Lincoln underwent an economic explosion with the settlement of the Danes. Like York, the Upper City seems to have had purely administrative functions up to 850 or so, while the Lower City, down the hill towards the River Witham, may have been largely deserted. By 950, however, the Witham banks were developed, the Lower City resettled and the suburb of Wigford emerging as a trading centre. In 1068, two years after the Norman conquest of England, William I ordered Lincoln Castle to be built on the site of the old Roman settlement, for the same strategic reasons and controlling the same road, the Fosse Way.

===Green cloth===

During the Anarchy, in 1141 Lincoln was the site of a battle between King Stephen and the forces of Empress Matilda, led by her illegitimate half-brother Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester. After fierce fighting in the city streets, Stephen&#x27;s forces were defeated and Stephen himself captured and taken to Bristol.

By 1150, Lincoln was among the wealthiest towns in England, based economically on cloth and wool exported to Flanders; Lincoln weavers had set up a guild in 1130 to produce Lincoln Cloth, especially the fine dyed &quot;scarlet&quot; and &quot;green&quot;, whose reputation was later enhanced by the legendary Robin Hood wearing woollens of Lincoln green. In the Guildhall, surmounting the city gate called the Stonebow, the ancient Council Chamber contains Lincoln&#x27;s civic insignia, a fine collection of civic regalia.

Outside the precincts of cathedral and castle, the old quarter clustered round the Bailgate and down Steep Hill to the High Street and High Bridge, whose half-timbered housing juts out over the river. There are three ancient churches: St Mary le Wigford and St Peter at Gowts, both 11th century in origin, and St Mary Magdalene, from the late 13th century. The last is an unusual English dedication to a saint whose cult was coming into vogue on the European continent at the time.

Lincoln was home to one of five main Jewish communities in England, well established before it was officially noted in 1154. In 1190, anti-Semitic riots that started in King&#x27;s Lynn, Norfolk, spread to Lincoln; the Jewish community took refuge with royal officials, but their homes were plundered. The so-called House of Aaron has a two-storey street frontage that is essentially 12th century and the nearby Jew&#x27;s House likewise bears witness to the Jewish population. In 1255, the affair called &quot;The Libel of Lincoln&quot; in which prominent Lincoln Jews, accused of ritual murder of a Christian boy (Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln in medieval folklore) were sent to the Tower of London and 18 executed. The Jews were all expelled in 1290.
Thirteenth-century Lincoln was England&#x27;s third largest city and a favourite of more than one king. In the First Barons&#x27; War, it was caught in the strife between the king and rebel barons allied with the French. Here and at Dover the French and Rebel army was defeated. Thereafter the town was pillaged for having sided with Prince Louis. In the Second Barons&#x27; War, of 1266, the disinherited rebels attacked the Jews of Lincoln, ransacked the synagogue and burned the records that registered debts.

===Decline, dissolution and damage===
Some historians have the city&#x27;s fortunes declining from the 14th century, but others argue that it remained buoyant in trade and communications well into the 15th. In 1409, the city became a county corporate: the County of the City of Lincoln, formerly part of the West Riding of Lindsey since at least the time of the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;. Additional rights were then conferred by successive monarchs, including those of an assay town (controlling metal manufacturing, for example). The oldest surviving secular drama in English, &quot;The Interlude of the Student and the Girl&quot; (), may have originated from Lincoln.

Lincoln&#x27;s coat of arms, not officially endorsed by the College of Arms, is believed to date from the 14th century. It is &quot;Argent on a cross gules a fleur-de-lis or&quot;. The cross is believed to derive from the Diocese. The fleur-de-lis symbolises the cathedral dedication to the Virgin Mary. The motto is CIVITAS LINCOLNIA (&quot;City of Lincoln&quot;).
The dissolution of the monasteries cut Lincoln&#x27;s main source of diocesan income and dried up the network of patronage controlled by the bishop. Seven monasteries closed in the city alone, as did several nearby abbeys, which further diminished the region&#x27;s political power. A symbol of Lincoln&#x27;s economic and political decline came in 1549, when the cathedral&#x27;s great spire rotted and collapsed and was not replaced. However, the comparative poverty of post-medieval Lincoln preserved pre-medieval structures that would probably have been lost under more prosperous conditions.

Between 1642 and 1651 in the English Civil War, Lincoln was on a frontier between the Royalist and Parliamentary forces and changed hands several times. Many buildings were badly damaged. Lincoln now had no major industry and no easy access to the sea. It suffered as the rest of the country was beginning to prosper in the early 18th century, travellers often commenting on what had essentially become a one-street town.

===Revolutions===
By the Georgian era, Lincoln&#x27;s fortunes began to pick up, thanks in part to the Agricultural Revolution. Reopening of the Foss Dyke canal eased imports of coal and other raw materials vital to industry. Along with the economic growth of Lincoln in this period, the city boundaries were spread to include the West Common. To this day, an annual Beat the Boundaries walk takes place along its perimeter.

Coupled with the arrival of railway links, Lincoln boomed again during the Industrial Revolution, and several famous companies arose, such as Ruston&#x27;s, Clayton&#x27;s, Proctor&#x27;s and William Foster&#x27;s. Lincoln began to excel in heavy engineering, by building locomotives, steam shovels and all manner of heavy machinery.

It was also around this time that the town&#x27;s name became overshadowed in the world&#x27;s consciousness by a different meaning of the word “Lincoln”: namely, U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, who led his country through their brutal Civil War and succeeded in abolishing nearly all slavery within its borders. Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s surname does trace back to the English town of Lincoln, but his family had migrated to America long before his birth. Many locations in the U.S. now bear the name Lincoln, such as Lincoln, Nebraska. But the shared name with England&#x27;s Lincoln is only coincidental, as the U.S. place names were named in honor of Abraham Lincoln.

A permanent military presence came with the 1857 completion of the &quot;Old Barracks&quot; (now held by the Museum of Lincolnshire Life). They were replaced by the &quot;New Barracks&quot; (now Sobraon Barracks) in 1890, when Lincoln Drill Hall in Broadgate also opened.

===20th and 21st centuries===

Lincoln was hit by typhoid in November 1904 – August 1905 caused by polluted drinking water from Hartsholme Lake and the River Witham. Over 1,000 people contracted the disease and fatalities totalled 113, including the man responsible for the city&#x27;s water supply, Liam Kirk of Baker Crescent. Near the beginning of the epidemic, Dr Alexander Cruickshank Houston installed a chlorine disinfection system just ahead of the poorly operating, slow sand filter, to kill the fatal bacteria. Chlorination of the water continued until 1911, when a new supply was implemented. Lincoln&#x27;s chlorination episode was an early use of chlorine to disinfect a water supply. Westgate Water Tower was built to provide new supplies.

In the two world wars, Lincoln switched to war production. The first ever tanks were invented, designed and built in Lincoln by William Foster &amp; Co. in the First World War and population growth provided more workers for greater expansion. The tanks were tested on land now covered by Tritton Road in the south-west suburbs. In the Second World War, Lincoln produced an array of war goods: tanks, aircraft, munitions and military vehicles.

In World War II 26 high explosive bombs were dropped on the city, with around 500 incendiary bombs, over five occasions, with eight people killed. 50 houses were destroyed, with the worst night being 9 May 1941. Also much damage occurred in the Dixon Street area on Friday 15 January 1943. Two parachute mines landed in fields on South Common on the night of 19 November 1940, which exploded and broke many windows in the town, but with no more damage. On 8 May 1941, nine high explosive bombs were dropped on around Westwick Gardens in Boultham Park, east of the former Ancaster High School, killing three people.

A Spitfire and Hurricane, from RAF Digby, collided over Lincoln. One pilot landed on allotments near Kingsway, and another landed near Branston Road. The Spitfire crashed on a house in Drake Street, and the Hurricane did a full circuit of the north of Lincoln, with no pilot aboard, and descended over the top of St Mary le Wigford church, to crash into a row of houses and shops, killing three people, and injuring nine.

Ruston &amp; Hornsby produced diesel engines for ships and locomotives, then by teaming up with former colleagues of Frank Whittle and Power Jets Ltd, in the early 1950s, R &amp; H (which became RGT) opened the first production line for gas turbine engines for land-based and sea-based energy production. Its success made it the city&#x27;s largest single employer, providing over 5,000 jobs in its factory and research facilities, making it a rich takeover target for industrial conglomerates. It was subsumed by English Electric in November 1966, which was then bought by GEC in 1968, with diesel engine production being transferred to the Ruston Diesels Division in Newton-le-Willows, Lancashire, at the former Vulcan Foundry.

Pelham Works merged with Alstom of France in the late 1980s and was then bought in 2003 by Siemens of Germany as Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery. This includes what is left of Napier Turbochargers. Plans came early in 2008 for a new plant outside the city at Teal Park, North Hykeham. Still, Siemens made large redundancies and moved jobs to Sweden and the Netherlands. The factory now employs 1300. R &amp; H&#x27;s former Beevor Foundry is now owned by Hoval Group, making industrial boilers (wood chip). The Aerospace Manufacturing Facility (AMF) in Firth Road passed from Alstom Aerospace Ltd to ITP Engines UK in January 2009.

Lincoln&#x27;s second largest private employer is James Dawson and Son, a belting and hose maker founded in the late 19th century. Its two sites are in Tritton Road. The main one, next to the University of Lincoln, used Lincoln&#x27;s last coal-fired boiler until it was replaced by gas in July 2018.

New suburbs appeared after 1945, but heavy industry declined towards the end of the 20th century. Much development, notably around the Brayford area, has followed the construction of the University of Lincoln&#x27;s Brayford Campus, which opened in 1996. In 2012, Bishop Grosseteste teaching college was also awarded university status.

==Economy==
34 per cent of Lincoln&#x27;s workforce are in public administration, education and health; distribution, restaurants and hotels account for 25 per cent.

Industrial relics like Ruston (now Siemens) remain, with empty industrial warehouse buildings becoming multi-use units, with the likes of the University of Lincoln, local Lincs FM radio station (in the &quot;Titanic Works&quot;) and gyms using some of the space. The old Corn Exchange, completed in 1848, is now used as a shopping arcade, and the newer Corn Exchange, completed in 1879, is now used as a restaurant and shops.

Like many other cities, Lincoln has a growing IT economy, with many e-commerce mail order companies. Two electronics firms are e2V and Dynex Semiconductor. Bifrangi, an Italian maker of crankshafts for off-road vehicles using a screw press, is based at the former &quot;Tower Works&quot; owned by Smith-Clayton Forge Ltd.

Lincoln is the hub for settlements such as Welton, Saxilby, Skellingthorpe and Washingborough, which look to it for most services and employment needs. Added they raise the population to 165,000. Lincoln is the main centre for jobs and facilities in Central Lincolnshire and performs a regional role over much of Lincolnshire and parts of Nottinghamshire. According to a document entitled &quot;Central Lincolnshire Local Plan Core Strategy&quot;, Lincoln has a &quot;travel-to-work&quot; area with a population of about 300,000. In 2021, Lincoln City Council joined the UK&#x27;s Key Cities network to help the city&#x27;s public sector.

The University of Lincoln and Lincoln&#x27;s colleges contribute to the city&#x27;s growth in the small firms, services, restaurants and entertainment venues. A small business unit next door to a student accommodation facility, the Think Tank, opened in June 2009. Some entertainment venues linked to the university include The Engine Shed and The Venue Cinema. Its presence has also built-up the area around the Brayford Pool.

===Tourism===
The city is a tourist centre for visitors to historic buildings that include the cathedral, the castle and the medieval Bishop&#x27;s Palace.

The Collection, of which the Usher Gallery is now part, is an important attraction, partly in a purpose-built venue. It currently contains over 2,000,000 objects, and was one of the four finalists for the 2006 Gulbenkian Prize. Any material from official archaeological excavations in Lincolnshire is eventually deposited there. Other attractions include the Museum of Lincolnshire Life and the International Bomber Command Centre.

Tranquil destinations close by are Whisby Nature Reserve and Hartsholme Country Park (including the Swanholme Lakes SSSI), while noisier entertainment can be found at Scampton airfield, Waddington airfield (base of the RAF&#x27;s Red Arrows jet aerobatic team), the County Showground or the Cadwell Park motor racing circuit near Louth.

Early each December the Bailgate area holds a Christmas Market in and around the Castle grounds, shaped by the traditional German-style Christmas markets, including that of Lincoln&#x27;s twin town Neustadt an der Weinstrasse. In 2010, for the first time, the event was cancelled due to &quot;atrocious&quot; snowfalls across most of the United Kingdom. It succumbed again in December 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Demographics==
Ethnicity
In the 2021 census, the population of Lincoln district was 103,813. The largest ethnic group was White British at 82.7%, with all ‘other white’ groups constituting 9.5%, followed by South Asian at 3.2%, Mixed race at 2%, Black British at 1.4%, other ethnic minorities made up 0.9% and Arab were 0.2%. This makes the ethnic makeup of the city 92% White and 8% ethnic minorities.

15.1% of the people living in Lincoln were born outside of the UK, of which 9.6% are from ‘other European countries’. The most common countries of birth aside from the UK are Poland at 2.6%, Romania at 1.4%, and Lithuania at 1.1%.

==Religious sites==

Lincoln is home to many active and former churches. These serve the city centre, outer suburbs of the city and urban area. Lincoln Central Mosque and Cultural Centre is on Dixon Street. The city has no Sikh or Hindu temples, with the nearest ones being in Scunthorpe, Grimsby, Nottingham and Doncaster. The Jewish Lincoln Synagogue is on Steep Hill, in the ancient building, Jews&#x27; Court, which is believed to be the site of the original medieval synagogue. There is also an international temple on James Street.

Churches in the city include: St Mary le Wigford, St Giles, St Benedicts, St Swithin&#x27;s, Lincoln Cathedral, St Hugh&#x27;s, St Katherine&#x27;s, Alive Church, Saint Peter at Gowts, Central Methodist Church, St Nicholas Lincoln Unitarian Chapel and Greek Orthodox Church of St Basil the Great and St Paisios and others in the city and outer suburbs.

===Cathedral===

Construction of the first Lincoln Cathedral within a &quot;close&quot; or walled precinct facing the castle began when the see was removed from the quiet backwater of Dorchester-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. It was completed in 1092 and rebuilt after a fire, but succumbed to the 1185 East Midlands earthquake. The rebuilt minster, enlarged eastwards several times, was on a grand scale, its crossing tower crowned by a spire reputedly Europe&#x27;s highest at . When complete, the central spire is widely accepted to have succeeded the Great Pyramids of Egypt as the world&#x27;s tallest man-made structure.

The Lincoln bishops were among the magnates of medieval England. The Diocese of Lincoln, the largest in England, had more monasteries than the rest of England put together, and the diocese was supported by large estates. When Magna Carta was drawn up in 1215, one of the witnesses was Hugh of Wells, Bishop of Lincoln. One of only four surviving originals of the document is preserved in Lincoln Castle.
Among the famous bishops of Lincoln were Robert Bloet, the magnificent justiciar to Henry I, Hugh of Avalon, the cathedral builder canonised as St Hugh of Lincoln, Robert Grosseteste, the 13th-century intellectual, Henry Beaufort, chancellor of Henry V and Henry VI, Thomas Rotherham, a politician deeply involved in the Wars of the Roses, Philip Repyngdon, chaplain to Henry IV and defender of Wycliffe, and Thomas Wolsey, the lord chancellor of Henry VIII. Theologian William de Montibus headed the cathedral school and was its chancellor until he died in 1213.

The administrative centre was the Bishop&#x27;s Palace, the third element in the central complex. When built in the late 12th century by Hugh of Lincoln, the Bishop&#x27;s Palace was one of the most important buildings in England. Its East Hall over a vaulted undercroft is the earliest surviving example of a roofed domestic hall. The chapel range and entrance tower were built by Bishop William of Alnwick, who modernised the palace in the 1430s. Both Henry VIII and James I were guests there. The palace was sacked in 1648 by royalist troops during the civil war.

==Geography and environment==
Lincoln lies at an altitude of by the River Witham up to on Castle Hill. It fills a gap in the Lincoln Cliff escarpment, which runs north and south through Central Lincolnshire, with altitudes up to . The city lies on the River Witham, which flows through this gap. The city is southwest of Hull, north-east of Nottingham, north of Peterborough, southeast of Leeds and east south-east of Sheffield.

===Uphill and Downhill===
Due to the variation in altitude, which presents something of an obstacle, Lincoln is divided informally into two zones: uphill and downhill.

The uphill area comprises the northern part of the city, on top of the Lincoln Cliff (to the north of the gap). This includes the historical quarter, including Lincoln Cathedral, Lincoln Castle and the Medieval Bishop&#x27;s Palace, known locally as The Bail (though described in tourist literature as the Cathedral Quarter). It also has residential suburbs to the north and north-east. The downhill area comprises the city centre and suburbs to the south and south-west. Steep Hill is a narrow, pedestrian street directly connecting the two. It passes through an archway known as the Stonebow.

This divide, peculiar to Lincoln, was once an important class distinction, with uphill more affluent and downhill less so. The distinction dates from the time of the Norman conquest, when the religious and military elite occupied the hilltop. The expansion of suburbs in both parts of the city since the mid-19th century has diluted the distinction.

===Ecology===
The mute swan is an iconic species for Lincoln. Many pairs nest each year beside the Brayford, and they feature on the university&#x27;s heraldic emblem. Other bird life within the city includes peregrine falcon, tawny owl and common kingfisher.

Mammals on the city edges include red fox, roe deer and least weasel. European perch, northern pike and bream are among fishes seen in the Witham and Brayford. Nature reserves around the city include Greetwell Hollow SSSI, Swanholme SSSI, Whisby Nature Park, Boultham Mere and Hartsholme Country Park.

Since 2016, little egrets have nested in the Birchwood area and otters appeared in the River Witham. Both are native to Britain and repopulating the area after near extermination.

Several invasive species of plants and animals have reached Lincoln. Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam are Asian plant species around the River Witham. Galinsoga and Amsinckia are American species found among city weeds, also American mink which are occasionally seen on the Witham.

===Built-up area===
The Lincoln built-up area extends outside of the city boundaries and includes the town of North Hykeham and the villages of Bracebridge Heath, Canwick, South Hykeham and Waddington. It had a population of 115,000 according to the 2011 census.

===Districts and suburban areas===
Despite its relatively limited district boundaries, Lincoln has had many older suburbs which date as far back as its Roman origins. Notable historic districts, that still survive in name or other uses include:

*Monks Road - Historically known as the &quot;East End&quot; of Lincoln. The area is home to many older and newer buildings which include but are not limited to: All Saints&#x27; Church, Lincoln College, St Hugh&#x27;s Church, Lincoln Arboretum, Monks Abbey and partly Lincoln County Hospital. The area is the most culturally diverse area of the city in terms of residents from ethnic backgrounds and religions. 

*Newland - Historically home to the port of Lincoln on the River Witham, now Brayford Pool is one of the oldest areas of the city. It dates back to as far as 1100 and remains one of the most busy and historic areas of the city itself. It is home to a range of old and new buildings including: Alive Church, Brayford Pool, Lincoln University, Lincoln City Hall and Chimes Water Clock.

*Newport - Historically home to part of the historic castra of the settlement of Lindum Colonia (now Lincoln) and dating back to 1269. It is most notable for its landmarks such as the Newport Arch, Bailgate Methodist Church, Westgate Water Tower, St Nicholas Church and the Bishop Grosseteste University. 

*West End - Historically part of the Roman City of Lucy Tower. It is mostly a residential area made up of old and new properties. It is home to notable landmarks including Lincoln Grand Stand, West Common, St Faith&#x27;s Church and the Foss Dyke. 

*Wigford - Historically separate from the city, it is now the main High Street between Lincoln City Centre and St Catherine&#x27;s. Wigford is home to many landmarks of Lincoln including St Mary le Wigford Church, Guildhall and Stonebow, St Peter at Gowts Church, St Botolph&#x27;s Church, Central Methodist Church, the Thomas Cooper Memorial Baptist Church, Sincil Dyke, St Benedict&#x27;s Church and the Cornhill Quarter.

Other areas of the city include historical hamlets and villages such as Boultham Moor, Bracebridge and Swallowbeck. As well as small parts of the nearby town of North Hykeham and parts of villages of Canwick and Waddington. As well as the former RAF Skellingthorpe site now occupied by Birchwood. Lincoln is also undergoing major expansion with a brand new Western Growth Corridor between Skellingthorpe, Birchwood and Hartsholme.

===Climate===
Lincoln has a typical East Midland maritime climate of cool summers and mild winters. The nearest Met Office weather station is at RAF Waddington, to the south. Temperature extremes since 1948 have ranged between on 19 July 2022, and in February 1956. A former weather station holds the record for the lowest daytime maximum temperature recorded in England in the month of December: on 17 December 1981. The lowest recent temperature was in December 2010, although another weather station at Scampton, a similar distance north of the city centre, fell to , so equalling Waddington&#x27;s record low set in 1956.


==Transport==
===Rail===
Lincoln railway station is at the meeting point of four railway lines, which run to Newark, Gainsborough, Grimsby and Sleaford. It is served by direct trains to London King&#x27;s Cross, Leicester, Nottingham, Sheffield, Doncaster, Grimsby Town and Peterborough. Hykeham railway station is located in the southwestern suburbs and is served by local trains on the line to Newark.

The city was previously served by three other railway lines: the Lincolnshire loop line, the Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway and the Grantham and Lincoln railway line Trains on the Newark line formerly stopped at Lincoln St Marks, a separate station to the south, until they were diverted to the current station in 1985. Its site is now part of a shopping park.

===Road===
The city lies on the A57, A46, A15 and A158 roads. These bring high levels of through traffic and bypasses have been built. To the north west is the £19-million A46 bypass opened in December 1985. On 19 December 2020 the £122-million A15 Eastern bypass was completed. A southern bypass, the North Hykeham relief road, is due to start construction in 2025 and will be the final section of a complete ring road around the city.

Until the 1980s, two trunk roads passed through Lincoln: the A46 and A15, both feeding traffic along the High Street. At the intersection of Guildhall Street and the High Street, the roads met at the termination of the A57. North of the city centre, the former A15 (Riseholme Road) is now the B1226, and the old A46 (Nettleham Road) is now the B1182. The early northern inner ring-road, formed of Yarborough Road and Yarborough Crescent, is numbered B1273.

===Air===
East Midlands Airport, 43 miles from Lincoln, is the main international airport serving the county. It mainly handles European flights with low-cost airlines. Humberside Airport, 29 miles north of Lincoln, is the only airport located in the county. It has a small number of flights mainly to hub airports such as Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. From 2005 until 2022, Doncaster Sheffield Airport also served Lincoln.

==Education==
===Higher education===
The older of Lincoln&#x27;s two higher education institutions, Bishop Grosseteste University, was started as a teacher training college linked to the Anglican Church in 1862. During the 1990s it branched out into other subject areas with a focus on the arts and drama. It became a university college in 2006 with degree powers taken over from the University of Leicester. It gained university status in 2012. An annual graduation celebration takes place in Lincoln Cathedral.}

The larger University of Lincoln started as the University of Lincolnshire and Humberside in 1996, when the University of Humberside opened a Lincoln campus next to Brayford Pool. Lincoln School of Art and Design (which was Lincolnshire&#x27;s main outlet for higher education) and Riseholme Agricultural College, previously part of De Montfort University in Leicester, were absorbed into the University of Lincoln in 2001, and subsequently the Lincoln campus took priority over the Hull campus.

The name changed to the University of Lincoln in September 2002. In the 2021–2022 academic year, a total of 18,705 university students studied in the city.

===Further education===
Further education in Lincoln is provided by Lincoln College, Lincolnshire&#x27;s largest education institution with 18,500 students, 2,300 of them full-time. There is a specialist creative college, Access Creative, offering courses in music, media and games design to some 180 students, all full-time.

===Schools===

The school system in Lincoln is anomalous within Lincolnshire despite being part of the same local education authority (LEA), as most of the county retained the grammar-school system.

In 1952, William Farr School was founded in Welton, a nearby village. Lincoln itself had four single-sex grammar schools until September 1974.

The Priory Academy LSST converted to academy status in 2008, in turn establishing The Priory Federation of Academies. The Priory Witham Academy was formed when the federation absorbed Moorlands Infant School, Usher Junior School and Ancaster High School. The Priory City of Lincoln Academy was formed when the City of Lincoln Community College merged into the federation. Both schools were rebuilt after substantial investment by the federation. Cherry Willingham School joined the federation in 2017, becoming The Priory Pembroke Academy.

The Lincolnshire LEA was ranked 32nd in the country based on its proportion of pupils attaining at least 5 A–C grades at GCSE including maths and English (62.2% compared with a national average of 58.2%).

There are four special-needs schools in Lincoln: Fortuna Primary School (5–11 year olds), Sincil Sports College (11–16), St Christopher&#x27;s School (3–16) and St Francis Community Special School (2–18).

==Media==
The local newspaper, the &quot;Lincolnshire Echo&quot;, was founded in 1894. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Lincolnshire on 94.9 FM, its commercial rival Greatest Hits Radio Lincolnshire on 102.2FM, Hits Radio Lincolnshire on DAB and Lincoln City Radio on 103.6 FM a community radio station catering mainly for listeners over 50. &quot;The Lincolnite&quot; was an online mobile publication covering the greater-Lincoln area since 2010 but ceased trading in August 2024. There used to be another station named Siren FM, operated by the University of Lincoln, but it ceased broadcasting at the end of June 2024 and the licences have been handed back to Ofcom.

The student publication &quot;The Linc&quot; is available online and in print and targets the University of Lincoln&#x27;s student population.

Local TV coverage is provided by BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and ITV Yorkshire which is received from the Belmont TV transmitter. The Waltham TV transmitter can also be received in the city that broadcast BBC East Midlands and ITV Central.

==Sport==

Lincoln&#x27;s professional football team is Lincoln City FC, nicknamed &quot;The Imps&quot;, which plays at the Sincil Bank stadium on the southern edge of the city. The collapse of ITV Digital, which owed Lincoln City FC more than £100,000, in 2002 saw the team faced with bankruptcy, but it was saved by a fund-raising venture among fans, which returned ownership of the club to them, where it has remained since. The club was the first to be relegated from the English Football League, when automatic relegation to the Football Conference was introduced from the 1986–87 season. Lincoln City regained its league place at the first attempt and held onto it until the 2010–11 season, when it was again relegated to the Football Conference.

Lincoln City was the first club managed by Graham Taylor, who went on to manage the England national football team from 1990 to 1993. He was at Lincoln City from 1972 to 1977, during which time the club won promotion from the Fourth Division as champions in 1976. The club also won the Football League Division Three North title on three separate occasions, a joint record. Its most successful era was in the early 1980s, winning promotion from the Fourth Division in 1981 and narrowly missing promotion to the Second Division in the two years that followed. It reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in 2017, beating several teams in the top two tiers of English football before being defeated by Arsenal. More recently Lincoln City won Football League Two in the 2018–2019 season and the EFL Trophy in 2018. It is currently managed by Michael Skubala.

Lincoln is also home to Lincoln United FC, Lincoln Moorlands Railway FC and Lincoln Griffins Ladies FC.

Lincoln hosts other sports facilities such American football&#x27;s Lincolnshire Bombers, which plays in the BAFA National Leagues, the Lincolnshire Bombers Roller Girls, the Imposters Rollergirls, and hosts Lincoln Rowing centre on the River Witham. Lindum Hockey Club plays in the north of the city. Since 1956 the city has played host to the Lincoln Grand Prix one-day cycle race, which for some 30 years has used a city-centre finishing circuit incorporating the challenging 1-in-6 cobbled ascent of Michaelgate. Since 2013 the city has had a professional wrestling promotion and training academy, Lincoln Fight Factory Wrestling. The Lincoln Lions rugby union team has been playing since 1902.

Two short-lived greyhound racing tracks were opened by Lincolnshire Greyhound Racing Association. One was the Highfield track in Hykeham Road, which opened on 13 September 1931, and the second the Lincoln Speedway on the Rope Walk, which opened on 4 June 1932. Racing at both was independent, as they were &quot;flapping&quot; tracks unaffiliated to the sport&#x27;s governing body, the National Greyhound Racing Club.

<text>The Luftwaffe () was the aerial-warfare branch of the before and during World War II. Germany&#x27;s military air arms during World War I, the of the Imperial Army and the of the Imperial Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 in accordance with the terms of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, which banned Germany from having any air force.

During the interwar period, German pilots were trained secretly in violation of the treaty at Lipetsk Air Base in the Soviet Union. With the rise of the Nazi Party and the repudiation of the Versailles Treaty, the Luftwaffe&#x27;s existence was publicly acknowledged and officially established on 26 February 1935, just over two weeks before open defiance of the Versailles Treaty through German rearmament and conscription would be announced on 16 March. The Condor Legion, a Luftwaffe detachment sent to aid Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War, provided the force with a valuable testing ground for new tactics and aircraft. Partially as a result of this combat experience, the Luftwaffe had become one of the most sophisticated, technologically advanced, and battle-experienced air forces in the world when World War II broke out in September 1939. By the summer of 1939, the Luftwaffe had twenty-eight &quot;Geschwader&quot; (wings). The Luftwaffe also operated a paratrooper force known as the .

The Luftwaffe proved instrumental in the German victories across Poland and Western Europe in 1939 and 1940. Although the Luftwaffe inflicted severe damage to the RAF&#x27;s infrastructure during the Battle of Britain and devastated many British cities during the subsequent Blitz, it failed to force the British into submission. From 1942, Allied bombing campaigns gradually destroyed the Luftwaffe&#x27;s fighter arm. From late 1942, the Luftwaffe used its surplus ground support and other personnel to raise Luftwaffe Field Divisions. In addition to its service on the Western front, the Luftwaffe operated over the Soviet Union, North Africa, and Southern Europe. Despite its belated use of advanced turbojet and rocket-propelled aircraft for the destruction of Allied bombers, the Luftwaffe was overwhelmed by the Allies&#x27; superior numbers and improved tactics, and a lack of trained pilots and aviation fuel. In January 1945, during the closing stages of the Battle of the Bulge, the Luftwaffe made a last-ditch effort to win air superiority, and met with failure. With rapidly dwindling supplies of petroleum, oil, and lubricants after this campaign, and as part of the entire combined military forces as a whole, the Luftwaffe ceased to be an effective fighting force.

After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Luftwaffe was disbanded in 1946. During World War II, German pilots claimed roughly 70,000 aerial victories, while over 75,000 Luftwaffe aircraft were destroyed or significantly damaged. Of these, nearly 40,000 were lost entirely. The Luftwaffe had only two commanders-in-chief throughout its history: Hermann Göring and later Robert Ritter von Greim for the last two weeks of the war.

The Luftwaffe was deeply involved in Nazi war crimes. By the end of the war, a significant percentage of aircraft production originated in concentration camps, an industry employing tens of thousands of forced laborers. The Luftwaffe&#x27;s demand for labor was one of the factors that led to the deportation and murder of hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews in 1944. The Luftwaffe frequently bombed non-military targets, the organised Nazi human experimentation, and Luftwaffe ground troops committed massacres in Italy, Greece, and Poland.

==History==
===Origins===
The Imperial German Army Air Service was founded in 1910 with the name , most often shortened to . It was renamed the on 8 October 1916. The air war on the Western Front received the most attention in the annals of the earliest accounts of military aviation, since it produced aces such as Manfred von Richthofen, Ernst Udet, Oswald Boelcke, and Max Immelmann. After the defeat of Germany, the service was dissolved on 8 May 1920 under the conditions of the Treaty of Versailles, which also mandated the destruction of all German military aircraft.

Since the Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany to have an air force, German pilots trained in secret. Initially, civil aviation schools within Germany were used, yet only light trainers could be used in order to maintain the façade that the trainees were going to fly with civil airlines such as . To train its pilots on the latest combat aircraft, Germany solicited the help of the Soviet Union, which was also isolated in Europe. A secret training airfield was established at Lipetsk in 1924 and operated for approximately nine years using mostly Dutch and Soviet, but also some German, training aircraft before being closed in 1933. This base was officially known as the 4th squadron of the 40th wing of the Red Army. Hundreds of Luftwaffe pilots and technical personnel visited, studied, and were trained at Soviet Air Force schools in several locations in Central Russia. Roessing, Blume, Fosse, Teetsemann, Heini, Makratzki, Blumendaat, and many other future Luftwaffe aces were trained in the USSR in joint Soviet-German schools that were set up under the patronage of Ernst August Köstring.

The first steps towards the Luftwaffe&#x27;s formation were undertaken just months after Adolf Hitler came to power. Hermann Göring, a World War I ace, became National for aviation with former &quot;Luft Hansa&quot; director Erhard Milch as his deputy. In April 1933 the Reich Aviation Ministry ( or RLM) was established. The RLM was in charge of the development and production of aircraft. Göring&#x27;s control over all aspects of aviation became absolute. On 25 March 1933 the German Air Sports Association absorbed all private and national organisations, while retaining its &#x27;sports&#x27; title. On 15 May 1933, all military aviation organisations in the RLM were merged, forming the Luftwaffe; its official &#x27;birthday&#x27;. The National Socialist Flyers Corps ( or NSFK) was formed in 1937 to give pre-military flying training to male youths, and to engage adult sport aviators in the Nazi movement. Military-age members of the NSFK were drafted into the Luftwaffe. As all such prior NSFK members were also Nazi Party members, this gave the new Luftwaffe a strong Nazi ideological base in contrast to the other branches of the (the &quot;Heer&quot; (army) and the (navy)). Göring played a leading role in the buildup of the Luftwaffe in 1933–36, but had little further involvement in the development of the force after 1936, and Milch became the &quot;de facto&quot; minister until 1937.

The absence of Göring in planning and production matters was fortunate. Göring had little knowledge of current aviation, had last flown in 1922, and had not kept himself informed of the latest events. Göring also displayed a lack of understanding of doctrine and technical issues in aerial warfare which he left to others more competent. The Commander-in-Chief left the organisation and building of the Luftwaffe, after 1936, to Erhard Milch. However Göring, as a part of Hitler&#x27;s inner circle, provided access to financial resources and materiel for rearming and equipping the Luftwaffe.

Another prominent figure in German air power construction this time was Helmuth Wilberg. Wilberg later played a large role in the development of German air doctrine. Having headed the air staff for eight years in the 1920s, Wilberg had considerable experience and was ideal for a senior staff position. Göring considered making Wilberg Chief of Staff (CS). However, it was revealed Wilberg had a Jewish mother. For that reason, Göring could not have him as CS. Not wishing his talent to go to waste, Göring ensured the racial policy of Nazi Germany did not apply to him. Wilberg remained in the air staff, and under Walther Wever helped draw up the Luftwaffe&#x27;s principle doctrinal texts, &quot;The Conduct of the Aerial War&quot; and &quot;Regulation 16&quot;.

===Preparing for war: 1933–1939===
====Wever years, 1933–1936====

The German officer corps was keen to develop strategic bombing capabilities against its enemies. However, economic and geopolitical considerations had to take priority. The German air power theorists continued to develop strategic theories, but emphasis was given to army support, as Germany was a continental power and expected to face ground operations following any declaration of hostilities.

For these reasons, between 1933 and 1934, the Luftwaffe&#x27;s leadership was primarily concerned with tactical and operational methods. In aerial terms, the army concept of was an operational concept, as well as a tactical doctrine. In World War I, the initial, 1914–15 era observation/reconnaissance air units, each with six two-seater aircraft apiece, had been attached to specific army formations and acted as support. Dive bomber units were considered essential to , attacking enemy headquarters and lines of communications. Luftwaffe &quot;Regulation 10: The Bomber&quot; (), published in 1934, advocated air superiority and approaches to ground attack tactics without dealing with operational matters. Until 1935, the 1926 manual &quot;Directives for the Conduct of the Operational Air War&quot; continued to act as the main guide for German air operations. The manual directed OKL to focus on limited operations (not strategic operations): the protection of specific areas and support of the army in combat.

With an effective tactical-operational concept, the German air power theorists needed a strategic doctrine and organisation. , a serviceman (not a pilot) in the during World War I, and later an experienced pilot with &quot;Lufthansa&quot;, was a prominent theorist of air power. Knauss promoted the Giulio Douhet theory that air power could win wars alone by destroying enemy industry and breaking enemy morale by &quot;terrorising the population&quot; of major cities. This advocated attacks on civilians. The General Staff blocked the entry of Douhet&#x27;s theory into doctrine, fearing revenge strikes against German civilians and cities.

In December 1934, Chief of the Luftwaffe General Staff Walther Wever sought to mold the Luftwaffe&#x27;s battle doctrine into a strategic plan. At this time, Wever conducted war games (simulated against France) in a bid to establish his theory of a strategic bombing force that would, he thought, prove decisive by winning the war through the destruction of enemy industry, even though these exercises also included tactical strikes against enemy ground forces and communications. In 1935, &quot;Luftwaffe Regulation 16: The Conduct of the Air War&quot; was drawn up. In the proposal, it concluded, &quot;The mission of the Luftwaffe is to serve these goals.&quot;

Historian James Corum states that under this doctrine, the Luftwaffe leadership rejected the practice of &quot;terror bombing&quot; (see Luftwaffe strategic bombing doctrine). According to Corum, terror bombing was deemed to be &quot;counter-productive&quot;, increasing rather than destroying the enemy&#x27;s will to resist. Such bombing campaigns were regarded as diversion from the Luftwaffe&#x27;s main operations; destruction of the enemy armed forces.

Nevertheless, Wever recognised the importance of strategic bombing. In newly introduced doctrine, &quot;The Conduct of the Aerial Air War&quot; in 1935, Wever rejected the theory of Douhet and outlined five key points to air strategy:

#To destroy the enemy air force by bombing its bases and aircraft factories, and defeating enemy air forces attacking German targets
#To prevent the movement of large enemy ground forces to the decisive areas by destroying railways and roads, particularly bridges and tunnels, which are indispensable for the movement and supply of forces
#To support the operations of the army formations, independent of railways, i.e, armoured forces and motorised forces, by impeding the enemy advance and participating directly in ground operations
#To support naval operations by attacking naval bases, protecting Germany&#x27;s naval bases and participating directly in naval battles
#To paralyze the enemy armed forces by stopping production in the armaments factories
Wever began planning for a strategic bomber force and sought to incorporate strategic bombing into a war strategy. He believed that tactical aircraft should only be used as a step to developing a strategic air force. In May 1934, Wever initiated a seven-year project to develop the so-called &quot;Ural bomber&quot;, which could strike as far as into the heart of the Soviet Union. In 1935, this design competition led to the Dornier Do 19 and Junkers Ju 89 prototypes, although both were underpowered. In April 1936, Wever issued requirements for the &#x27;Bomber A&#x27; design competition: a range of with a bomb load. However Wever&#x27;s vision of a &quot;Ural&quot; bomber was never realised, and his emphasis on strategic aerial operations was lost. The only design submittal for Wever&#x27;s &#x27;Bomber A&#x27; that reached production was Heinkel&#x27;s &quot;Projekt 1041&quot;, which culminated in the production and frontline service as Germany&#x27;s only operational heavy bomber, the Heinkel He 177, on 5 November 1937, the date on which it received its RLM airframe number.

In 1935, the military functions of the RLM were grouped into the (OKL; &quot;Air Force High Command&quot;).

Following the untimely death of Wever in early June 1936 in an aviation-related accident, by the late 1930s the Luftwaffe had no clear purpose. The air force was not subordinated to the army support role, and it was not given any particular strategic mission. German doctrine fell between the two concepts. The Luftwaffe was to be an organisation capable of carrying out broad and general support tasks rather than any specific mission. Mainly, this path was chosen to encourage more flexible use of air power and offer the ground forces the right conditions for a decisive victory. In fact, on the outbreak of war, only 15% of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s aircraft were devoted to ground support operations, counter to the long-held myth that the Luftwaffe was designed for only tactical and operational missions.

====Change of direction, 1936–37====

Wever&#x27;s participation in the construction of the Luftwaffe came to an abrupt end on 3 June 1936 when he was killed along with his engineer in a Heinkel He 70 Blitz, ironically on the very day that his &quot;Bomber A&quot; heavy bomber design competition was announced. After Wever&#x27;s death, Göring began taking more of an interest in the appointment of Luftwaffe staff officers. Göring appointed his successor Albert Kesselring as Chief of Staff and Ernst Udet to head the Reich&#x27;s Air Ministry Technical Office (), although he was not a technical expert. Despite this Udet helped change the Luftwaffe&#x27;s tactical direction towards fast medium bombers to destroy enemy air power in the battle zone rather than through industrial bombing of its aviation production.

Kesselring and Udet did not get on. During Kesselring&#x27;s time as CS, 1936–1937, a power struggle developed between the two as Udet attempted to extend his own power within the Luftwaffe. Kesselring also had to contend with Göring appointing &quot;yes men&quot; to positions of importance. Udet realised his limitations, and his failures in the production and development of German aircraft would have serious long term consequences.

The failure of the Luftwaffe to progress further towards attaining a strategic bombing force was attributable to several reasons. Many in the Luftwaffe command believed medium bombers to be sufficient power to launch strategic bombing operations against Germany&#x27;s most likely enemies; France, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. The United Kingdom presented greater problems. Hellmuth Felmy, commander of in 1939, was charged with devising a plan for an air war over the British Isles. Felmy was convinced that Britain could be defeated through morale bombing. Felmy noted the alleged panic that had broken out in London during the Munich crisis, evidence he believed of British weakness. A second reason was technical. German designers had never solved the issues of the Heinkel He 177A&#x27;s design difficulties, brought on by the requirement from its inception on 5 November 1937 to have moderate dive-bombing capabilities in a 30-meter wingspan aircraft. Moreover, Germany did not possess the economic resources to match the later British and American effort of 1943–1944, particularly in large-scale mass production of high power output aircraft engines (with output of over least 1,500 kW (2,000 hp). In addition, the OKL had not foreseen the industrial and military effort strategic bombing would require. By 1939 the Luftwaffe was not much better prepared than its enemies to conduct a strategic bombing campaign, with fatal results during the Battle of Britain.

The German rearmament programme faced difficulties acquiring raw materials. Germany imported most of its essential materials for rebuilding the Luftwaffe, in particular rubber and aluminum. Petroleum imports were particularly vulnerable to blockade. Germany pushed for synthetic fuel plants but still failed to meet demands. In 1937 Germany imported more fuel than it had at the start of the decade. By summer 1938, only 25% of the requirements could be covered. In steel materials, industry was operating at barely 83% of capacity, and by November 1938 Göring reported the economic situation was serious. The (OKW), the overall command for all German military forces, ordered reductions in raw materials and steel used for armament production. The figures for reduction were substantial: 30% steel, 20% copper, 47% aluminum, and 14% rubber. Under such circumstances, it was not possible for Milch, Udet, or Kesselring to produce a formidable strategic bombing force even had they wanted to do so.

The development of aircraft was now confined to the production of twin-engined medium bombers that required much less material, manpower, and aviation production capacity than Wever&#x27;s &quot;Ural Bomber&quot;. German industry could build two medium bombers for one heavy bomber and the RLM would not gamble on developing a heavy bomber which would also take time. Göring remarked, &quot;the &quot;Führer&quot; will not ask how big the bombers there are, but only how many there are.&quot; The premature death of Wever, one of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s finest officers, left the Luftwaffe without a strategic air force during World War II, which eventually proved fatal to the German war effort.

The lack of strategic capability should have been apparent much earlier. The Sudeten Crisis highlighted German unpreparedness to conduct a strategic air war (although the British and French were in a much weaker position), and Hitler ordered the Luftwaffe be expanded to five times its earlier size. The OKL badly neglected the need for transport aircraft; even in 1943, transport units were described as (Bomber Units on Special Duties, KGzbV). and only grouping them together into dedicated cargo and personnel transport wings () during that year. In March 1938, as the &quot;Anschluss&quot; was taking place, Göring ordered Felmy to investigate the prospect of air raids against Britain. Felmy concluded it was not possible until bases in Belgium and the Netherlands were obtained and the Luftwaffe had heavy bombers. It mattered little, as war was avoided by the Munich Agreement, and the need for long-range aircraft did not arise.

These failures were not exposed until wartime. In the meantime, German designs of mid-1930s origin such as the Messerschmitt Bf 109, the Heinkel He 111, the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka, and the Dornier Do 17, performed very well. All first saw active service in the Condor Legion against Soviet-supplied aircraft. The Luftwaffe also quickly realised the days of the biplane fighter were finished, the Heinkel He 51 being switched to service as a trainer. Particularly impressive were the Heinkel and Dornier, which fulfilled the Luftwaffe&#x27;s requirements for bombers that were faster than 1930s-era fighters, many of which were biplanes or strut-braced monoplanes.

Despite the participation of these aircraft (mainly from 1938 onward), it was the venerable Junkers Ju 52 (which soon became the backbone of the ) that made the main contribution. During the Spanish Civil War Hitler remarked, &quot;Franco ought to erect a monument to the glory of the Junkers Ju 52. It is the aircraft which the Spanish revolution has to thank for its victory.&quot;

====Dive-bombing====

Poor accuracy from level bombers in 1937 led the Luftwaffe to grasp the benefits of dive-bombing. The latter could achieve far better accuracy against tactical ground targets than heavier conventional bombers. Range was not a key criterion for this mission. It was not always feasible for the army to move heavy artillery over recently captured territory to bombard fortifications or support ground forces, and dive bombers could do the job faster. Dive bombers, often single-engine two-man machines, could achieve better results than larger six or seven-man aircraft, at a tenth of the cost and four times the accuracy. This led to Udet championing the dive bomber, particularly the Junkers Ju 87.

Udet&#x27;s &quot;love affair&quot; with dive-bombing seriously affected the long-term development of the Luftwaffe, especially after Wever&#x27;s death. The tactical strike aircraft programmes were meant to serve as interim solutions until the next generation of aircraft arrived. In 1936 the Junkers Ju 52 was the backbone of the German bomber fleet. This led to a rush on the part of the RLM to produce the Junkers Ju 86, the Heinkel He 111, and the Dornier Do 17 before a proper evaluation was made. The Ju 86 was poor while the He 111 showed the most promise. The Spanish Civil War convinced Udet (along with limited output from the German munitions industry) that wastage was not acceptable in munition terms. Udet sought to build dive-bombing into the Junkers Ju 88 and conveyed the same idea, initiated specifically by the OKL for the Heinkel He 177, approved in early November 1937. In the case of the Ju 88, 50,000 modifications had to be made. The weight was increased from seven to twelve tons. This resulted in a speed loss of 200 km/h. Udet merely conveyed the OKL&#x27;s own dive-bombing capability request to Ernst Heinkel concerning the He 177, who vehemently opposed such an idea, which ruined its development as a heavy bomber. Göring was not able to rescind the dive-bombing requirement for the He 177A until September 1942.

====Mobilisation, 1938–1941====
By the summer of 1939, the Luftwaffe had ready for combat nine (fighter wings) mostly equipped with the Messerschmitt Bf 109E, four &quot;Zerstörergeschwader&quot; (destroyer wings) equipped with the Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighters, 11 (bomber wings) equipped mainly with the Heinkel He 111 and the Dornier Do 17Z, and four (dive bomber wings) primarily armed with the iconic Junkers Ju 87B &quot;Stuka&quot;. The Luftwaffe was just starting to accept the Junkers Ju 88A for service, as it had encountered design difficulties, with only a dozen aircraft of the type considered combat-ready. The Luftwaffe&#x27;s strength at this time stood at 373,000 personnel (208,000 flying troops, 107,000 in the Flak Corps, and 58,000 in the Signals Corps). Aircraft strength was 4,201 operational aircraft: 1,191 bombers, 361 dive bombers, 788 fighters, 431 heavy fighters, and 488 transports. Despite deficiencies, it was an impressive force.

However, even by the spring of 1940, the Luftwaffe still had not mobilised fully. Despite the shortage of raw materials, Udet had increased production through introducing a 10-hour working day for aviation industries and rationalising production. During this period 30 and 16 were raised and equipped. A further five (&quot;Destroyer groups&quot;) were created (JGr 101, 102, 126, 152 and 176), all equipped with the Bf 110.

The Luftwaffe also greatly expanded its aircrew training programmes by 42%, to 63 flying schools. These facilities were moved to eastern Germany, away from possible Allied threats. The number of aircrew reached 4,727, an increase of 31%. However, the rush to complete this rapid expansion scheme resulted in the deaths of 997 personnel and another 700 wounded. 946 aircraft were also destroyed in these accidents. The number of aircrew completing their training was up to 3,941, The Luftwaffe&#x27;s entire strength was now 2.2 million personnel.

In April and May 1941, Udet headed the Luftwaffe delegation inspecting the Soviet aviation industry in compliance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Udet informed Göring &quot;that Soviet air forces are very strong and technically advanced.&quot; Göring decided not to report the facts to Hitler, hoping that a surprise attack would quickly destroy the USSR. Udet realised that the upcoming war with the USSR might cripple Germany. Udet, torn between truth and loyalty, suffered a psychological breakdown and even tried to tell Hitler the truth, but Göring told Hitler that Udet was lying, then took Udet under control by giving him drugs at drinking parties and hunting trips. Udet&#x27;s drinking and psychological condition became a problem, but Göring used Udet&#x27;s dependency to manipulate him.

===Luftwaffe organisation===
====Luftwaffe commanders====

Throughout the history of Nazi Germany, the Luftwaffe had only two commanders-in-chief. The first was Göring, with the second and last being Robert Ritter von Greim. His appointment as commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe was concomitant with his promotion to , the last German officer in World War II to be promoted to the highest rank. Other officers promoted to the second highest military rank in Germany were Kesselring, Hugo Sperrle, Milch, and Wolfram von Richthofen.

At the end of the war, with Berlin surrounded by the Red Army, Göring suggested to Hitler that he take over leadership of the Reich. Hitler ordered his arrest and execution, but Göring&#x27;s SS guards did not carry out the order, and Göring survived to be tried at Nuremberg.

Sperrle was prosecuted at the OKW trial, one of the last twelve of the Nuremberg trials after the war. He was acquitted on all four counts. He died in Munich in 1953.

===Organisation and chain of command===

At the start of the war the Luftwaffe had four (air fleets), each responsible for roughly a quarter of Germany. As the war progressed more air fleets were created as the areas under German rule expanded. As one example, was created in 1940 to direct operations in Norway and Denmark, and other were created as necessary. Each would contain several (Air Corps), (Air Division), (Fighter Corps), (Air Division), or (Fighter Air Command). Each formations would have attached to it a number of units, usually several , but also independent and . were also responsible for the training aircraft and schools in their operational areas.

A was commanded by a , with the rank of either major, (lieutenant colonel) or (colonel). Other &quot;staff&quot; officers within the unit with administrative duties included the adjutant, technical officer, and operations officer, who were usually (though not always) experienced aircrew or pilots still flying on operations. Other specialist staff were navigation, signals, and intelligence personnel. A (headquarters flight) was attached to each .

A (hunting wing) (JG) was a single-seat day fighter , typically equipped with Bf 109 or Fw 190 aircraft flying in the fighter or fighter-bomber roles. Late in the war, by 1944–45, JG 7 and JG 400 (and the jet specialist JV 44) flew much more advanced aircraft, with JG 1 working up with the Heinkel He 162 &quot;emergency fighter&quot; at war&#x27;s end. A consisted of groups (), which in turn consisted of (fighter squadrons). Hence, Fighter Wing 1 was JG 1, its first (group) was I./JG 1, using a Roman numeral for the number only, and its first (squadron) was 1./JG 1. strength was usually 120–125 aircraft.

Each was commanded by a , and a by a . However, these were &quot;appointments&quot;, not ranks, within the Luftwaffe. Usually, the would hold the rank of or, exceptionally, an . Even a (second lieutenant) could find himself commanding a .

Similarly, a bomber wing was a (KG), a night fighter wing was a (NJG), a dive bomber wing was a (StG), and units equivalent to those in RAF Coastal Command, with specific responsibilities for coastal patrols and search and rescue duties, were (Kü.Fl. Gr.). Specialist bomber groups were known as (KGr). The strength of a bomber was about 80–90 aircraft.

===Personnel===
The peacetime strength of the Luftwaffe in the spring of 1939 was 370,000 men. After mobilisation in 1939 almost 900,000 men served, and just before Operation Barbarossa in 1941 personnel strength had reached 1.5 million men. The Luftwaffe reached its largest personnel strength during the period November 1943 to June 1944, with almost three million men and women in uniform; 1.7 million of these were male soldiers, 1 million male and civilian employees, and almost 300,000 female and male auxiliaries (). In October 1944, the anti-aircraft units had 600,000 soldiers and 530,000 auxiliaries, including 60,000 male members of the , 50,000 (males age 15–17), 80,000 (males above military age) and (males unfit for military service), and 160,000 female and , as well as 160,000 foreign personnel (Hiwis).

===Spanish Civil War===
The Luftwaffe&#x27;s Condor Legion experimented with new doctrine and aircraft during the Spanish Civil War. It helped the &quot;Falange&quot; under Francisco Franco to defeat the Republican forces. Over 20,000 German airmen gained combat experience that would give the Luftwaffe an important advantage going into the Second World War. One infamous operation was the bombing of Guernica in the Basque country. It is commonly assumed this attack was the result of a &quot;terror doctrine&quot; in Luftwaffe doctrine. The raids on Guernica and Madrid caused many civilian casualties and a wave of protests from abroad. It has been suggested that the bombing of Guernica was carried out for military tactical reasons, in support of ground operations, but the town was not directly involved in any fighting at that point in time. It was not until 1942 that the Germans started to develop a bombing policy in which civilians were the primary targets, although the Blitz on London and many other British cities involved indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas, &#x27;nuisance raids&#x27; which could even involve the machine-gunning of civilians and livestock.

===World War II===

When World War II began in 1939, the Luftwaffe was one of the most technologically advanced air forces in the world. During the Polish Campaign that triggered the war, it quickly established air superiority, and then air supremacy. It supported the German Army operations which ended the campaign in five weeks. The Luftwaffe&#x27;s performance was as the OKL had hoped. The Luftwaffe rendered invaluable support to the army, mopping up pockets of resistance. Göring was delighted with the performance. Command and control problems occurred, but flexibility and improvisation in both the army and the Luftwaffe solved these problems. The Luftwaffe was to have in place a ground-to-air communication system, which played a vital role in the success of 1940&#x27;s .

In the spring of 1940 the Luftwaffe assisted the and in the invasion of Norway. Flying in reinforcements and winning air superiority, the Luftwaffe contributed decisively to the German conquest.

In May and June 1940, the Luftwaffe contributed to the unexpected German success in the Battle of France. It destroyed three Allied Air Forces and helped secure the defeat of France in just over six weeks. However, it could not destroy the British Expeditionary Force at Dunkirk despite intense bombing. The BEF escaped to continue the war.

During the Battle of Britain in summer 1940, the Luftwaffe inflicted severe damage on Britain&#x27;s Royal Air Force, but did not achieve the air superiority that Hitler had demanded for the proposed invasion of Britain, which was postponed and then canceled in December 1940. The Luftwaffe ravaged British cities during the Blitz of 1940–1941, but failed to break British morale, and the RAF shot down German planes by over a two to one ratio. Hitler had already ordered preparations for Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union.

In spring 1941 the Luftwaffe helped its Axis partner, Italy, secure victory in the Balkans Campaign and continued to support Italy or the Italian Social Republic in the Mediterranean, Middle East and African theaters until May 1945.

In June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union. Despite destroying thousands of Soviet aircraft, the Luftwaffe failed to destroy the Red Air Force altogether. Lacking strategic bombers (the very &quot;Ural bombers&quot; that Wever had asked for six years before) the Luftwaffe could not strike at Soviet production-centres regularly or with the needed force. The Axis and Soviet air operations during Operation Barbarossa consumed vast numbers of men and planes. As the war dragged on, the Luftwaffe was eroded in strength. German defeats at the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942 and in the Battle of Kursk in 1943 ensured the gradual decline of the on the Eastern Front.

British historian Frederick Taylor asserts that &quot;all sides bombed each other&#x27;s cities during the war. Half a million Soviet citizens, for example, died from German bombing during the invasion and occupation of Russia. That&#x27;s roughly equivalent to the number of German citizens who died from Allied raids.&quot;

The Luftwaffe defended German-occupied Europe against the growing offensive power of RAF Bomber Command and, starting in the summer of 1942, the steadily building strength of the United States Army Air Forces. The mounting demands of the Defence of the Reich campaign gradually destroyed the Luftwaffe&#x27;s fighter arm. Despite its belated use of advanced turbojet and rocket-propelled aircraft for bomber-destroyer duties, it was overwhelmed by Allied numbers and a lack of trained pilots and fuel. A last-ditch attempt, known as Operation Bodenplatte, to win air superiority on 1 January 1945 failed. After the &quot;Bodenplatte&quot; effort, the Luftwaffe ceased to be an effective fighting force.

German day- and night-fighter pilots claimed more than 70,000 aerial victories during World War II. Of these, an estimated 745 victories were attributed to Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighters. Flak shot down 25,000–30,000 Allied planes. Broken down according to the different Allied forces, about 25,000 were American planes, about 20,000 British, 46,100 Soviet, 1,274 French, 375 Polish, and 81 Dutch as well as aircraft from other Allied nationalities.

The highest-scoring day-fighter pilot was Erich Hartmann with 352 confirmed kills, of which all but 7 were on the Eastern front against the Soviets. The leading aces in the west were Hans-Joachim Marseille with 158 kills (most of which were against British Commonwealth forces in the Desert campaign), and Georg-Peter Eder with 56 kills of aircraft from the USAAF (of a total of 78). The most successful night-fighter pilot, Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer, is credited with 121 kills. 103 German fighter pilots shot down more than 100 enemy aircraft for a total of roughly 15,400 aerial victories. Roughly a further 360 pilots claimed between 40 and 100 aerial victories for round about 21,000 victories. Another 500 fighter pilots claimed between 20 and 40 victories for a total of 15,000 victories. Part of the reason German pilots scored such high victory totals was that they were in combat for the duration of the war-unlike the Allies, who rotated their flyers out of combat after a certain amount of time to recuperate or to impart their skills in training other pilots - German pilots flew until they were killed, captured, or too badly wounded to keep flying. It is relatively certain that 2,500 German fighter pilots attained ace status, having achieved at least five aerial victories. These achievements were honored with 453 German single and twin-engine (Messerschmitt Bf 110) day-fighter pilots receiving the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross. Intense personal rivalry may have played an important role in motivating high-performing aces (who scored the vast majority of aerial victories). Public recognition in the form of medals and mentions in the army bulletin spurred efforts of peers who had previously flown with award-winners
. 85 night-fighter pilots, including 14 crew members, were awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross. Some bomber pilots were also highly successful. &quot;Stuka&quot; and pilot Hans-Ulrich Rudel flew 2,530 ground-attack missions and claimed the destruction of more than 519 tanks and a battleship, among others. He became the most highly decorated German serviceman of the Second World War. Bomber pilot Hansgeorg Bätcher flew more than 658 combat missions, destroying numerous ships and other targets.

Luftwaffe losses, on the other hand, were high as well. The estimated total number of destroyed and damaged for the war totalled 76,875 aircraft. Of these, about 43,000 were lost in combat, the rest in operational accidents and during training. By type, losses totalled 21,452 fighters, 12,037 bombers, 15,428 trainers, 10,221 twin-engine fighters, 5,548 ground attack craft, 6,733 reconnaissance planes, and 6,141 transports.

According to the General Staff of the the losses of the flight personnel until February 1945 amounted to:

According to official statistics, total Luftwaffe casualties, including ground personnel, amounted to 138,596 killed and 156,132 missing through 31 January 1945.

==Omissions and failures==
===Lack of aerial defence===
The failure of the Luftwaffe in the Defence of the Reich campaign was a result of a number of factors. The Luftwaffe lacked an effective air defence system early in the war. Hitler&#x27;s foreign policy had pushed Germany into war before these defences could be fully developed. The Luftwaffe was forced to improvise and construct its defences during the war.

The daylight actions over German-controlled territory were sparse in 1939–1940. The responsibility of the defence of German air space fell to the (air district commands). The defence systems relied mostly on the &quot;flak&quot; arm. The defences were not coordinated and communication was poor. This lack of understanding between the flak and flying branches of the defence would plague the Luftwaffe throughout the war. Hitler, in particular, wanted the defence to rest on anti-aircraft artillery as it gave the civilian population a &quot;psychological crutch&quot; no matter how ineffective the weapons.

Most of the battles fought by the Luftwaffe on the Western Front were against the RAF&#x27;s &quot;Circus&quot; raids and the occasional daylight raid into German air space. This was a fortunate position since the Luftwaffe&#x27;s strategy of focusing its striking power on one front started to unravel with the failure of the invasion of the Soviet Union. The &quot;peripheral&quot; strategy of the Luftwaffe between 1939 and 1940 had been to deploy its fighter defences at the edges of Axis occupied territory, with little protecting the inner depths. Moreover, the front line units in the West were complaining about the poor numbers and performance of aircraft. Units complained of lack of aircraft with all-weather capabilities and the &quot;lack of climbing power of the Bf 109&quot;. The Luftwaffe&#x27;s technical edge was slipping as the only formidable new aircraft in the German arsenal was the Focke-Wulf Fw 190. Milch was to assist Udet with aircraft production increases and the introduction of more modern types of fighter aircraft. However, they explained at a meeting of the Reich Industrial Council on 18 September 1941 that the new next-generation aircraft had failed to materialise, and production of obsolete types had to continue to meet the growing need for replacements.

The buildup of the (&quot;Fighter Force&quot;) was too rapid and its quality suffered. It was not put under a unified command until 1943, which also affected the performance of the nine fighter wings in existence in 1939. No further units were formed until 1942, and the years of 1940–1941 were wasted. The OKL failed to construct a strategy; instead, its command style was reactionary, and its measures not as effective without thorough planning. This was particularly apparent with the &quot;Sturmböck&quot; squadrons, formed to replace the increasingly ineffective twin-engined heavy fighter wings as the primary defence against USAAF daylight raids. The flew Fw 190A fighters armed with heavy 20mm and 30mm cannon to destroy heavy bombers, but this increased the weight and affected the performance of the Fw 190 at a time when the aircraft were meeting large numbers of equal if not superior Allied types.

Daytime aerial defence against the USAAF&#x27;s strongly defended heavy bomber forces, particularly the Eighth Air Force and the Fifteenth Air Force, had its successes through the calendar year of 1943. But at the start of 1944, Eighth AF commander Jimmy Doolittle made a major change in offensive fighter tactics, which defeated the Luftwaffe&#x27;s day fighter force from that time onwards. Steadily increasing numbers of the superlative North American P-51 Mustang single-engine fighter, leading the USAAF&#x27;s bombers into German airspace defeated first the wings, then the Fw 190A Sturmböcke.

===Development and equipment===

In terms of technological development, the failure to develop a long-range bomber and capable long-range fighters during this period left the Luftwaffe unable to conduct a meaningful strategic bombing campaign throughout the war. However, Germany at that time suffered from limitations in raw materials such as oil and aluminum, which meant that there were insufficient resources for much beyond a tactical air force: given these circumstances, the Luftwaffe&#x27;s reliance on tactical mid-range, twin-engined medium bombers and short-range dive-bombers was a pragmatic choice of strategy. It might also be argued that the Luftwaffe&#x27;s medium and heavy bomber wings were perfectly capable of attacking strategic targets, but the lack of capable long-range escort fighters left the bombers unable to carry out their missions effectively against determined and well-organised fighter opposition.

The greatest failure for the , however, was being saddled with an aircraft intended as a capable four-engined heavy bomber: the perpetually troubled Heinkel He 177, whose engines were prone to catch fire in flight. Of the three parallel proposals from the Heinkel engineering departments for a four-engined version of the A-series He 177 by February 1943, one of these being the Heinkel firm&#x27;s &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; candidate, only one, the He 177B, emerged in the concluding months of 1943. Only three airworthy prototypes of the B-series He 177 design were produced by early 1944, by which point the Avro Lancaster, the most successful RAF heavy bomber, was already in widespread service.

Another failure of procurement and equipment was the lack of a dedicated naval air arm. Felmy had already expressed a desire to build a naval air arm to support operations in the Atlantic and British waters. Britain was dependent on food and raw materials from its Empire and North America. Felmy pressed this case firmly throughout 1938 and 1939, and, on 31 October 1939, Erich Raeder sent a strongly worded letter to Göring in support of such proposals. The early-war twin-engined Heinkel He 115 floatplane and Dornier Do 18 flying boat were too slow and short-ranged. The then-contemporary Blohm &amp; Voss BV 138 (&quot;seadragon&quot;) flying boat became the Luftwaffe&#x27;s primary seaborne maritime patrol platform, with nearly 300 examples built; it had a 4,300 km (2,670 mi) maximum range. Another Blohm und Voss design of 1940, the enormous, 46-meter wingspan Blohm &amp; Voss BV 222 maritime patrol flying boat was capable of a 6,800 km (4,200-mile) range at maximum endurance. The Dornier Do 217 would have been ideal as a land-based choice but suffered production problems. Raeder also complained about the poor standard of aerial torpedoes, although their design was the responsibility of the , even considering production of the Japanese Type 91 torpedo used in the Attack on Pearl Harbor as the LT 850 by August 1942.

Without specialised naval or land-based, purpose-designed maritime patrol aircraft, the Luftwaffe was forced to improvise. The Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor – developed as a civilian airliner – lacked the structural strength for combat maneuvering at lower altitudes, making it unsuitable for use as a bomber in maritime patrol duties. The Condor lacked speed, armor and bomb load capacity. Sometimes the fuselage literally &quot;broke its back&quot; or a wing panel dropped loose from the wing root after a hard landing. Nevertheless, it was adapted for the long-range reconnaissance and anti-shipping roles and, between August 1940 and February 1941, Fw 200s sank 85 vessels for a claimed total of 363,000 GRT. Had the Luftwaffe focused on naval aviation – particularly maritime patrol aircraft with long range, Germany might well have been in a position to win the Battle of the Atlantic. However, Raeder and the failed to press for naval air power until the war began, mitigating the Luftwaffe&#x27;s responsibility. At the same time Göring regarded any other branch of the German military developing its own aviation as an encroachment on his authority and continually frustrated the navy&#x27;s attempts to build its own airpower.

The absence of a strategic bomber force for the Luftwaffe, following Wever&#x27;s death in 1936 and the end of the Ural bomber programme was not addressed until the authorisation of the &quot;Bomber B&quot; design competition in July 1939, which sought to replace the medium bomber force with which the Luftwaffe would begin the war, and the partly achieved high-speed medium bomber concept with more advanced, twin-engined high-speed bomber aircraft fitted with pairs of relatively &quot;high-power&quot; engines of 1,500 kW (2,000 hp) and upwards as a follow-on to the earlier project, that would also be able to function as shorter-range heavy bombers.

The spring 1942 programme sought to produce strategic bomber designs for the Luftwaffe to directly attack the United States from Europe or the Azores. Inevitably, both the &quot;Bomber B&quot; and programmes were victims of the continued emphasis of the combined military&#x27;s insistence for its Luftwaffe air arm to support the as its primary mission, and the damage to the German aviation industry from Allied bomber attacks.

====Challenges in directly addressing combat pilots&#x27; issues====
The RLM&#x27;s apparent lack of a dedicated &quot;technical-tactical&quot; department, that would have directly been in contact with combat pilots to assess their needs for weaponry upgrades and tactical advice, had never been seriously envisioned as a critically ongoing necessity in the planning of the original German air arm. The RLM did have its own &quot;Technisches Amt&quot; (T-Amt) department to handle aviation technology issues, but this was tasked with handling all aviation technology issues in Nazi Germany, both military and civilian in nature, and also not known to have ever had any clear and actively administrative and consultative links with the front-line forces established for such purposes. On the front-line combat side of the issue, and for direct contact with the German aviation firms making the Luftwaffe&#x27;s warplanes, the Luftwaffe did have its own reasonably effective system of four military aviation test facilities, or located at three coastal sites – Peenemünde-West (also incorporating a separate facility in nearby Karlshagen), Tarnewitz and Travemünde – and the central inland site of Rechlin, itself first established as a military airfield in late August 1918 by the German Empire, with the four-facility system commanded later in World War II by Edgar Petersen. However, due to lack of co-ordination between the RLM and the OKL, all fighter and bomber development was oriented toward short-range aircraft, as they could be produced in greater numbers, rather than quality long-range aircraft, something that put the Luftwaffe at a disadvantage as early as the Battle of Britain. The &quot;ramp-up&quot; to production levels required to fulfill the Luftwaffe&#x27;s front-line needs was also slow, not reaching maximum output until 1944. 

Production of fighters was not given priority until the Emergency Fighter Program was begun in 1944; Adolf Galland commented that this should have occurred at least a year earlier. Galland also pointed to the mistakes and challenges made in the development of the Messerschmitt Me 262 including the protracted development time required for its Junkers Jumo 004 jet engines to achieve reliability. German combat aircraft types that were first designed and flown in the mid-1930s had become obsolete, yet were kept in production, in particular the Ju 87 Stuka, and the Bf 109, because there were no well-developed replacement designs.

===Production failures===
The failure of German production was evident from the start of the Battle of Britain. By the end of 1940, the Luftwaffe had suffered heavy losses and needed to regroup. Deliveries of new aircraft were insufficient to meet the drain on resources; the Luftwaffe, unlike the RAF, was failing to expand its pilot and aircraft numbers. This was partly owing to production planning failures before the war and the demands of the army. Nevertheless, the German aircraft industry was being outproduced in 1940. In terms of fighter aircraft production, the British exceeded their production plans by 43%, while the Germans remained 40% &quot;behind&quot; target by summer 1940. In fact, German production in fighters fell from 227 to 177 per month between July and September 1940. One of the many reasons for the failure of the Luftwaffe in 1940 was that it did not have the operational and material means to destroy the British aircraft industry, something that the much-anticipated &quot;Bomber B&quot; design competition was intended to address.

The so-called &quot;Göring programme&quot;, had largely been predicated on the defeat of the Soviet Union in 1941. After the &#x27;s failure in front of Moscow, industrial priorities for a possibility in increasing aircraft production were largely abandoned in favor to support the army&#x27;s increased attrition rates and heavy equipment losses. Milch&#x27;s reforms expanded production rates. In 1941 an average of 981 aircraft (including 311 fighters) were produced each month. In 1942 this rose to 1,296 aircraft of which 434 were fighters. Milch&#x27;s planned production increases were initially opposed. But in June, he was granted materials for 900 fighters per month as the average output. By the summer of 1942, the operational fighter force had recovered from a low of 39% (44% for fighters and 31% for bombers) in the winter of 1941–1942, to 69% by late June (75% for fighters and 66% for bombers) in 1942. However, after increased commitments in the east, overall operational ready rates fluctuated between 59% and 65% for the remaining year. Throughout 1942 the Luftwaffe was out produced in fighter aircraft by 250% and in twin-engine aircraft by 196%.

The appointment of Albert Speer as Minister of Armaments increased production of existing designs and the few new designs that had originated from earlier in the war. However, the intensification of Allied bombing caused the dispersion of production and prevented an efficient acceleration of expansion. German aviation production reached about 36,000 combat aircraft for 1944. However, by the time this was achieved the Luftwaffe lacked the fuel and trained pilots to make this achievement worthwhile.

The failure to maximise production immediately after the failures in the Soviet Union and North Africa ensured the Luftwaffe&#x27;s effective defeat in the period of September 1943 – February 1944. Despite the tactical victories won, they failed to achieve a decisive victory. By the time production reached acceptable levels, as so many other factors had for the Luftwaffe – and for the entire &#x27;s weapons and ordnance technology as a whole – late in the war, it was &quot;too little, too late&quot;.

===Engine development===

By the late 1930s, airframe construction methods had progressed to the point where airframes could be built to any required size, especially in Germany with aircraft like the Dornier Do X flying boat and the Junkers G 38 airliner. However, powering such designs was a major challenge. Mid-1930s aero engines were limited to about 600 hp and the first 1000 hp engines were just entering the prototype stagefor Nazi Germany&#x27;s then-new Luftwaffe air arm, this meant liquid-cooled inverted V12 designs like the Daimler-Benz DB 601.

Nazi Germany&#x27;s initial need for substantially more powerful aviation engines originated with the private venture Heinkel He 119 high-speed reconnaissance design, and the Messerschmitt Me 261 for maritime reconnaissance duties. To give enough power in each engine installation, Daimler-Benz coupled two DB 601 engines as single &quot;power system&quot; with the propeller gear reduction housing across the front ends of the two engines. The combined powerplant, known as the DB 606, gave maximum output in February 1937, for a total weight of around 1.5 tonnes.

Daimler-Benz&#x27;s was at the same time developing a 1,500 kW class X-configuration engine design resulting in the twenty-four cylinder Daimler-Benz DB 604 (four banks of six cylinders each). Possessing essentially the same displacement of as the initial version of the liquid-cooled Junkers Jumo 222 multibank engine, six banks of four inline cylinders apiece instead; coincidentally, both the original Jumo 222 design and the DB 604 each weighed about a third less (at some of dry weight) than the DB 606. The DB 604&#x27;s protracted development was diverting valuable German aviation powerplant research resources, and with more development of the &quot;twinned-DB 605&quot; based DB 610 coupled engine (itself initiated in June 1940 with a top output level of , and brought together in the same way – with the same all-up weight of 1.5 tonnes – as the DB 606 had been) giving improved results at the time, the Reich Air Ministry stopped all work on the DB 604 in September 1942. Such &quot;coupled powerplants&quot; were the exclusive choice of power for the Heinkel He 177A &quot;Greif&quot; heavy bomber, mistasked from its beginnings in being intended to do moderate-angle &quot;dive bombing&quot; for a 30-meter wingspan class, heavy bomber design – the twin nacelles for a pair of DB 606s or 610s did reduce drag for such a combat &quot;requirement&quot;, but the poor design of the He 177A&#x27;s engine accommodations for these twin-crankcase &quot;power systems&quot; caused repeated outbreaks of engine fires, causing the &quot;dive bombing&quot; requirement for the He 177A to be cancelled by mid-September 1942.

BMW worked on what was essentially an enlarged version of its highly successful BMW 801 design from the Focke-Wulf Fw 190A. This led to the 53.7-litre displacement BMW 802 in 1943, an eighteen-cylinder air-cooled radial, weighing matching that of the 24-cylinder liquid-cooled inline DB 606; and the even larger, 83.5-litre displacement BMW 803 28-cylinder liquid-cooled radial, which from post-war statements from BMW development personnel were each considered to be &quot;secondary priority&quot; development programmes at best. This situation with the 802 and 803 designs led to the company&#x27;s engineering personnel being redirected to place all efforts on improving the 801 to develop it to its full potential. The BMW 801F radial development, through its use of features coming from the 801E subtype, was able to substantially exceed the over-1,500 kW output level. 

The twinned-up Daimler-Benz DB 601-based, 1,750 kW output DB 606, and its more powerful descendant, the 2,130 kW output DB 605-based DB 610, weighing some 1.5 tonnes apiece, were the only 1,500 kW-plus output level aircraft powerplants to ever be produced by Germany for Luftwaffe combat aircraft, mostly for the Heinkel He 177A heavy bomber. Even the largest-displacement inverted V12 aircraft powerplant built in Germany, the 44.52-litre (2,717 cu. in.) Daimler-Benz DB 603, which saw widespread use in twin-engined designs, could not exceed 1,500 kW output without more development. By March 1940, even the DB 603 was being &quot;twinned-up&quot; as the 601/606 and 605/610 had been, to become their replacement &quot;power system&quot;: this was the strictly experimental, approximately 1.8-tonne weight apiece, twin-crankcase DB 613; capable of over 2,570 kW (3,495 PS) output, but which never left its test phase.

The proposed over-1,500 kW output subtypes of German aviation industry&#x27;s existing piston aviation engine designs—which adhered to using just a single crankcase that &quot;were&quot; able to substantially exceed the aforementioned over-1,500 kW output level—were the DB 603 LM (1,800 kW at take-off, in production), the DB 603 N (2,205 kW at take-off, planned for 1946) and the BMW 801F (1,765 kW (2,400 PS) engines. The pioneering nature of jet engine technology in the 1940s resulted in numerous development problems for both of Germany&#x27;s major jet engine designs to see mass production, the Jumo 004 and BMW 003 (both axial flow designs), with the more powerful Heinkel HeS 011 never leaving the test phase.

===Personnel and leadership===
The bomber arm was given preference and received the &quot;better&quot; pilots. Later, fighter pilot leaders were few in numbers as a result of this. As with the late shift to fighter production, the Luftwaffe pilot schools did not give the fighter pilot schools preference soon enough. The Luftwaffe, the OKW argued, was still an offensive weapon, and its primary focus was on producing bomber pilots. This attitude prevailed until the second half of 1943. During the Defence of the Reich campaign in 1943 and 1944, there were not enough commissioned fighter pilots and leaders to meet attrition rates; as the need arose to replace aircrew (as attrition rates increased), the quality of pilot training deteriorated rapidly. Later this was made worse by fuel shortages for pilot training caused by the Allied strategic bombing campaign against German oil production. Overall this meant reduced training on operational types, formation flying, gunnery training, and combat training, and a total lack of instrument training.

At the beginning of the war, commanders were replaced with younger commanders too quickly. These younger commanders had to learn &quot;in the field&quot; rather than entering a front-line post fully qualified. Training of formation leaders was not systematic until 1943, which was far too late, with the Luftwaffe already stretched. The Luftwaffe thus lacked a cadre of staff officers to set up new combat units with carefully selected and skilled combat personnel, and pass on experience.

Moreover, Luftwaffe leadership from the start poached the training command, which undermined its ability to replace losses, while also planning for &quot;short sharp campaigns&quot;, which did not pertain. Moreover, no plans were laid for night fighters. In fact, when protests were raised, Hans Jeschonnek, Chief of the General Staff of the Luftwaffe, said, &quot;First we&#x27;ve got to beat Russia, then we can start training!&quot;

==Luftwaffe ground forces==
The Luftwaffe was unusual among contemporary independent air forces in possessing an organic paratrooper force called . Established in 1938, they were deployed in parachute operations in 1940 and 1941 and participated in the Battle of Fort Eben-Emael and the Battle for The Hague (alongside the German Army&#x27;s 22nd Air Landing Division) in May 1940, and en masse during the Battle of Crete in May 1941. However, more than 4,000 were killed during the Crete operation. The associated losses of aircraft and the belief that paratroops no longer enjoyed the advantage of surprise led to reduction in airborne operations. Afterwards, although continuing to be trained in parachute delivery, paratroopers were only used in a parachute role for smaller-scale operations, such as the rescue of Benito Mussolini in 1943. formations were mainly used as light infantry in all theatres of the war. Their losses up to February 1945 were 22,041 killed, 57,594 wounded and 44,785 missing.

During 1942 surplus Luftwaffe personnel was used to form Luftwaffe Field Divisions, standard infantry divisions that were used chiefly as rear echelon units to free up front line troops. From 1943, the Luftwaffe also had an armoured division called &quot;Fallschirm-Panzer&quot; Division 1 Hermann Göring, which was expanded to a in 1944.

Ground support and combat units from the (RAD), the (LSP), the National Socialist Flyers Corps (NSFK), and the National Socialist Motor Corps (NSKK) were also put at the Luftwaffe&#x27;s disposal during the war. In 1942 56 RAD companies served with the Luftwaffe in the West as airfield construction troops. In 1943 420 RAD companies were trained as crews of anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) and posted to existing Luftwaffe AAA battalions in the homeland. At the end of the war, these units were also fighting Allied tanks. Beginning in 1939 with a transport regiment, the NSKK had in 1942 a complete division-sized transportation unit serving the Luftwaffe, the serving in France and at the Eastern front. The overwhelming number of its 12,000 members were Belgian, Dutch, and French collaborators.

==War crimes==
===Forced labour===

In 1943 and 1944, aircraft production was moved to concentration camps in order to alleviate labour shortages and to protect production from Allied air raids. The two largest aircraft factories in Germany were located at Mauthausen-Gusen and Mittelbau-Dora concentration camps. Aircraft parts were also manufactured at Flossenbürg, Buchenwald, Dachau, Ravensbrück, Gross-Rosen, Natzweiler, Herzogenbusch, and Neuengamme. In 1944 and 1945, as many as 90,000 concentration prisoners worked in the aviation industry, and were about one tenth of the concentration camp population over the winter of 1944–45. Partly in response to the Luftwaffe&#x27;s demand for more forced labourers to increase fighter production, the concentration camp more than doubled between mid-1943 (224,000) and mid-1944 (524,000). Part of this increase was due to the deportation of Hungarian Jews; the programme was used to justify the deportations to the Hungarian government. Of the 437,000 Hungarian Jews deported between May and July 1944, about 320,000 were gassed on arrival at Auschwitz and the remainder forced to work. Only 50,000 survived.

Almost 1,000 fuselages of the jet fighter Messerschmitt Me 262 were produced at Gusen, a subcamp of Mauthausen and a brutal labour camp, where the average life expectancy was six months. By 1944, one-third of production at the crucial Regensburg plant that produced the Bf 109, the backbone of the Luftwaffe fighter arm, originated in Gusen and Flossenbürg alone. Synthetic oil was produced from shale oil deposits by prisoners of Mittlebau-Dora as part of Operation Desert directed by Edmund Geilenberg in order to make up for the decrease in oil production due to Allied bombing. For oil production, three subcamps were constructed and 15,000 prisoners forced to work in the plant. More than 3,500 people died. Vaivara concentration camp in Estonia was also established for shale oil extraction; about 20,000 prisoners worked there and more than 1,500 died at Vaivara.

Luftwaffe airfields were frequently maintained using forced labour. Thousands of inmates from five subcamps of Stutthof worked on the airfields. Airfields and bases near several other concentration camps and ghettos were constructed or maintained by prisoners. On the orders of the Luftwaffe, prisoners from Buchenwald and Herzogenbusch were forced to defuse bombs that had fallen around Düsseldorf and Leeuwarden respectively.

Thousands of Luftwaffe personnel worked as concentration camp guards. Auschwitz included a munitions factory guarded by Luftwaffe soldiers; 2,700 Luftwaffe personnel worked as guards at Buchenwald. Dozens of camps and subcamps were staffed primarily by Luftwaffe soldiers. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos&quot;, it was typical for camps devoted to armaments production to be run by the branch of the that used the products. In 1944, many Luftwaffe soldiers were transferred to concentration camps to alleviate personnel shortages.

===Massacres===
Luftwaffe paratroopers committed many war crimes in Crete following the Battle of Crete, including the Alikianos executions, the Massacre of Kondomari, and the Razing of Kandanos. Several Luftwaffe divisions, including the 1st Parachute Division, 2nd Parachute Division, 4th Parachute Division, 19th Luftwaffe Field Division, 20th Luftwaffe Field Division and the 1st Division, committed war crimes in Italy, murdering hundreds of civilians.

Luftwaffe troops participated in the murder of Jews imprisoned in ghettos in Eastern Europe. For example, they assisted in the murder of 2,680 Jews at the Nemirov ghetto, participated in a series of massacres at the Opoczno ghetto, and helped to liquidate the Dęblin–Irena Ghetto by deporting thousands of Jews to Treblinka extermination camp. Between 1942 and 1944, two Luftwaffe security battalions were stationed in the Białowieża Forest for operations. Encouraged by Göring, they murdered thousands of Jews and other civilians. Luftwaffe soldiers frequently executed Polish civilians at random with baseless accusations of being &quot;Bolshevik agents&quot;, in order to keep the population in line, or as reprisal for partisan activities. The performance of the troops was measured by the body count of people murdered. 10,000 Luftwaffe troops were stationed on the Eastern Front for such &quot;anti-partisan&quot; operations.

===Human experimentation===

Throughout the war, concentration camp prisoners were forced to serve as human subjects in testing Luftwaffe equipment. Some of these experiments were carried out by Luftwaffe personnel and others were performed by the SS on the orders of the OKL.

In 1941, experiments with the intent of discovering how to prevent and treat hypothermia were carried out for the Luftwaffe, which had lost aircrew to immersion hypothermia after ditchings. The experiments were conducted at Dachau and Auschwitz. Sigmund Rascher, a Luftwaffe doctor based at Dachau, published the results at the 1942 medical conference entitled &quot;Medical Problems Arising from Sea and Winter&quot;. Of about 400 prisoners forced to participate in cold-water experiments, 80 to 90 were killed.

In early 1942, prisoners at Dachau were used by Rascher in experiments to perfect ejection seats at high altitudes. A low-pressure chamber containing these prisoners was used to simulate conditions at altitudes of up to . It was rumored that Rascher performed vivisections on the brains of victims who survived the initial experiment. Of the 200 subjects, 80 died from the experimentation, and the others were executed. Eugen Hagen, head doctor of the Luftwaffe, infected inmates of Natzweiler concentration camp with typhus in order to test the efficacy of proposed vaccines.

===Aerial bombing of non-military targets===
No positive or specific customary international humanitarian law with respect to aerial warfare existed prior to or during World War II. This is also why no Luftwaffe officers were prosecuted at the post-World War II Allied war crime trials for the aerial raids.

The bombing of Wieluń was an air raid on the Polish town of Wieluń by the Luftwaffe on 1 September 1939. The Luftwaffe started bombing Wieluń at 04:40, five minutes before the shelling of Westerplatte, which has traditionally been considered the beginning of World War II in Europe. The air raid on the town was one of the first aerial bombings of the war. About 1,300 civilians were killed, hundreds were injured, and 90 percent of the town centre was destroyed. The casualty rate was more than twice as high as Guernica. A 1989 Sender Freies Berlin documentary stated that there were no military or industrial targets in the area, except for a small sugar factory in the outskirts of the town. Furthermore, Trenkner stated that German bombers first destroyed the town&#x27;s hospital. Two attempts, in 1978 and 1983, to prosecute individuals for the bombing of the Wieluń hospital were dismissed by West German judges when prosecutors stated that the pilots had been unable to make out the nature of the structure due to fog.

Operation Retribution was the April 1941 German bombing of Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia. The bombing deliberately targeted the killing of civilians as punishment and resulted in 17,000 civilian deaths. It occurred in the first days of the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. The operation commenced on 6 April and concluded on 7 or 8 April, resulting in the paralysis of Yugoslav civilian and military command and control, widespread destruction in the centre of the city and many civilian casualties. Following the Yugoslav capitulation, Luftwaffe engineers conducted a bomb damage assessment in Belgrade. The report stated that of bombs were dropped, with 10 to 14 percent being incendiaries. It listed all the targets of the bombing, which included: the royal palace, the war ministry, military headquarters, the central post office, the telegraph office, passenger and goods railway stations, power stations, and barracks. It also mentioned that seven aerial mines were dropped and that areas in the centre and northwest of the city had been destroyed, comprising 20 to 25 percent of its total area. Some aspects of the bombing remain unexplained, particularly the use of aerial mines. In contrast, Pavlowitch states that almost 50 percent of housing in Belgrade was destroyed. After the invasion, the Germans forced between 3,500 and 4,000 Jews to collect rubble that was caused by the bombing.

The biggest attacks at civilian targets occurred in the Battle of Britain when the Luftwaffe attacked the British Isles and primarily hit non military targets. This resulted in over 22,000 civilians being killed and over 30,000 being wounded.

===Trials===

Several prominent Luftwaffe commanders were convicted of war crimes, including General Alexander Löhr and Field Marshal Albert Kesselring.

<text>Lafora disease is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorder which results in myoclonus epilepsy and usually results in death several years after the onset of symptoms. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of inclusion bodies, known as Lafora bodies, within the cytoplasm of the cells. The Lafora bodies are in the heart, liver, muscle, and skin. Lafora disease is also a neurodegenerative disease that causes impairment in the development of brain (cerebral) cortical neurons and is a glycogen metabolism disorder.

Lafora disease (LD) was described by the Spanish neuropathologist Gonzalo Rodríguez Lafora (1886–1971) in 1911, while directing the Neuropathology Section at the Government Hospital for Mental Insane (current NIH, US).

Lafora disease is rare, meaning it is very rare in children, adolescents and adults worldwide. However, it has a higher incidence among children and adolescents with ancestry from regions where consanguineous relationships are common, namely the Mediterranean (North Africa, Southern Europe), the Middle East, India, and Pakistan. Dogs can also have the condition. In dogs, Lafora disease can spontaneously occur in any breed, but the miniature wire-haired dachshund, bassett hound, and beagle are predisposed.

Most patients with this disease do not live past the age of twenty-five, and it often leads to death within ten years of symptoms appearing. Late onset symptoms of this disease can begin at any age depending on the genes affected. At present, there is no cure for this disease, but there are ways to deal with symptoms through treatments and medications. There are five patient organizations worldwide that share resources and support the Lafora patient community.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms of Lafora disease begin to develop during the early adolescent years, and symptoms progress as time passes. Prior to this, there is generally no indication of the presence of the disease, though in a few cases, the disease presents as a learning disorder around five years of age. In extremely rare cases, symptoms may not show at all until as late as the third decade of life, though these cases have slower progression than typical LD. The most common feature of Lafora disease is seizures that have been reported mainly as occipital seizures and myoclonic seizures with some cases of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, atypical absence seizures, and atonic and complex partial seizures. Other symptoms common with the seizures are drop attacks, ataxia, temporary blindness, visual hallucinations, and a quickly-developing and dramatic dementia.

Other common signs and symptoms associated with Lafora disease are behavioral changes due to the frequency of seizures. Over time those affected with Lafora disease have brain changes that cause confusion, speech difficulties, depression, decline in intellectual function, impaired judgement and impaired memory. If areas of the cerebellum are affected by seizures, it is common to see problems with speech, coordination, and balance in Lafora patients.

For dogs that are affected with Lafora disease, common symptoms are rapid shuddering, shaking, or jerking of the canine&#x27;s head backwards, high pitched vocalizations that could indicate the dog is panicking, seizures, and – as the disease progresses – dementia, blindness, and loss of balance.

Within ten years of developing symptoms, life expectancy declines. People who advance to adulthood tend to lose their ability to do daily tasks by themselves, which can require comprehensive care. If their symptoms progress extremely quickly or at an early age, patients receive comprehensive care, which – besides medication – means support during daily activities both physically and mentally. 

== Genetics ==
Lafora disease is an autosomal recessive disorder, caused by loss of function mutations in either the laforin glycogen phosphatase gene (&quot;EPM2A&quot;) or malin E3 ubiquitin ligase gene (&quot;NHLRC1&quot;). These mutations in either of these two genes lead to polyglucosan formation or lafora body formation in the cytoplasm of heart, liver, muscle, and skin.

&#x27;Graph 1&#x27; shows the data for 250 families that have been affected by Lafora disease and the distribution of cases around the world. The graph shows that there is a very large number of cases in Italy because of a higher occurrence of EPM2A gene mutation compared to any other country in the world.
&#x27;Graph 2&#x27; shows the percentage distribution of the cases from either an EPM2A gene mutation or an EPM2B (NHLRC1) gene mutation. 42% of the cases are caused by EPM2A and 58% are caused by EPM2B (NHLRC1). The most common mutation on the EPM2A gene is the R241X mutation. This genetic mutation is the cause for 17% of the EPM2A-caused Lafora disease cases.

&quot;EPM2A&quot; codes for the protein laforin, a dual-specificity phosphatase that acts on carbohydrates by taking phosphates off.

&quot;NHLRC1&quot; encodes the protein malin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, that regulates the amount of laforin.

Laforin is essential for making the normal structure of a glycogen molecule. When the mutation occurs on the &quot;EPM2A&quot; gene, laforin protein is down-regulated and less of this protein is present or none is made at all. If there is also a mutation in the &quot;NHLRC1&quot; gene that makes the protein malin, then laforin cannot be regulated and thus less of it is made.

Less laforin means more phosphorylation of glycogen, causing conformational changes, rendering it insoluble, leading to an accumulation of misformed glycogen, which has neurotoxic effects. 
In a laforin mutation, glycogen would be hyperphosphorylated; this has been confirmed in laforin knock-out mice.

Research literature also suggests that over-activity of glycogen synthase, the key enzyme in synthesizing glycogen, can lead to the formation of polyglucosans and it can be inactivated by phosphorylation at various amino acid residues by many molecules, including GSK-3beta, Protein phosphatase 1, and malin.

As defective enzyme molecules participate in the production of these molecules (GSK-3beta, PP1, and malin), excessive glycogen synthase activity occurs in combination with mutations in laforin that phosphorylates the excess glycogen being made, rendering it insoluble. The key player missing is ubiquitin. It is not able to degrade the excess amount of the insoluble lafora bodies. Since mutations arise in malin, an e3 ubiquitin ligase, this directly interferes with the degradation of laforin, causing the laforin not to be degraded. In this case laforin is then hyperphosphorylated.

== Lafora bodies ==
Lafora disease is distinguished by the presence of inclusions called Lafora bodies within the cytoplasm of cells. Lafora bodies are aggregates of polyglucosans or abnormally shaped glycogen molecules. Glycogen in Lafora disease patients has abnormal chain lengths, which causes them to be insoluble, accumulate, and have a neurotoxic effect.

For glycogen to be soluble, there must be short chains and a high frequency of branching points, but this is not found in the glycogen in Lafora patients. LD patients have longer chains that have clustered arrangement of branch points that form crystalline areas of double helices making it harder for them to clear the blood-brain barrier. The glycogen in LD patients also has higher phosphate levels and is present in greater quantities.

== Diagnosis ==
Lafora disease is diagnosed by conducting a series of tests by a neurologist, epileptologist (person who specializes in epilepsy), or geneticist. To confirm the diagnosis, an EEG, MRI, and genetic testing are needed. A biopsy may be necessary as well to detect and confirm the presence of Lafora bodies in the skin.

== Treatment ==
There is no cure for Lafora disease with treatment being limited to controlling seizures through anti-epileptic and anti-convulsant medications. The treatment is usually based on the individual&#x27;s specific symptoms and the severity of those symptoms. Some examples of medications include valproate, levetiracetam, topiramate, benzodiazepines, or perampanel. Although the symptoms and seizures can be controlled for a long period by using anti-epileptic drugs, the symptoms will progress and patients lose their ability to perform daily activities leading to the survival rate of approximately 10 years after symptoms begin. Quality of life worsens as the years go on, with some patients requiring a feeding tube so that they can get the nutrition and medication they need in order to keep living, but not necessarily functioning. Recently Metformin is approved for the treatment.
== Epidemiology ==
All the reports that have been published on Lafora disease have shown that the overall prevalence of the disease is about 4 cases per million individuals around the world. Lafora disease is much more prevalent in countries that have higher cases of inbreeding. Usually, these locations are geographically or culturally more isolated from the world at large.

== Research ==
The disease is named after Gonzalo Rodríguez Lafora (1886–1971), a Spanish neuropathologist who first recognized small inclusion bodies in Lafora patients in the early to mid 1900s.

Recent research has investigated whether inhibition of glycogen synthesis through restriction of glucose intake could potentially stop the formation of the Lafora Bodies in neurons in laforin-deficient mice models while also reducing the chances of seizures.

Researchers in the U.S., Canada, and Europe formed the Lafora Epilepsy Cure Initiative with funding from the National Institutes of Health. The group aims to interrupt the process of how the mutations in laforin and malin interfere with normal carbohydrate metabolism in mice models. 

==Society and culture==
=== Patient organizations ===
There are patient organizations in the United States (Chelsea&#x27;s Hope), Italy (Tempo Zero and A.I.L.A.), France (France Lafora), and Spain (AEVEL).

Chelsea&#x27;s Hope began as a website in the fall of 2007 as a means to share Chelsea Gerber&#x27;s story with her family and friends. As the Gerber family connected with others affected by Lafora, they formed a patient advocacy organization in September 2009. Chelsea&#x27;s Hope Lafora Children Research Fund is an IRS 501(c)3 non-profit organization, EIN: 27-1008382. The mission of Chelsea&#x27;s Hope is to improve the lives of those affected by Lafora Disease and help accelerate the development of treatments.

In 2016, shortly before Chelsea&#x27;s death, her mother Linda recorded a video sharing a day in their life. From myoclonus to a feeding tube replacement, viewers can learn what it means to live with Lafora Disease.

<text>Lassa fever, also known as Lassa hemorrhagic fever, is a type of viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus. Many of those infected by the virus do not develop symptoms. When symptoms occur they typically include fever, weakness, headaches, vomiting, and muscle pains. Less commonly there may be bleeding from the mouth or gastrointestinal tract. The risk of death once infected is about one percent and frequently occurs within two weeks of the onset of symptoms. Of those who survive, about a quarter have hearing loss, which improves within three months in about half of these cases.

The disease is usually initially spread to people via contact with the urine or feces of an infected multimammate mouse. Spread can then occur via direct contact between people. Diagnosis based on symptoms is difficult. Confirmation is by laboratory testing to detect the virus&#x27;s RNA, antibodies for the virus, or the virus itself in cell culture. Other conditions that may present similarly include Ebola, malaria, typhoid fever, and yellow fever. The Lassa virus is a member of the &quot;Arenaviridae&quot; family of viruses.

There is no vaccine. Prevention requires isolating those who are infected and decreasing contact with the mice. Other efforts to control the spread of disease include having a cat to hunt vermin, and storing food in sealed containers. Treatment is directed at addressing dehydration and improving symptoms. The antiviral medication ribavirin has been recommended, but evidence to support its use is weak.

Descriptions of the disease date from the 1950s. The virus was first described in 1969 from a case in the town of Lassa, in Borno State, Nigeria. Lassa fever is relatively common in West Africa including the countries of Nigeria, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Ghana. There are about 300,000 to 500,000 cases which result in 5,000 deaths a year.
==Signs and symptoms==
Onset of symptoms is typically 7 to 21 days after exposure. These mild symptoms may include fever, tiredness, weakness, and headache. In 20% of people more severe symptoms such as bleeding gums, breathing problems, vomiting, chest pain, or dangerously low blood pressure may occur. Long term complications may include hearing loss. In those who are pregnant, miscarriage may occur in 95% of child-bearing females . Lassa fever can be difficult to distinguish clinically from other viral hemorrhagic fevers, such as Ebola virus disease. A combination of pharyngitis, pain behind the sternum, presence of excess protein in the urine and fever can indicate Lassa fever with higher specificity.

In cases in which death occurs, this typically occurs within 14 days of onset. About 1% of all Lassa virus infections result in death. Approximately 15%-20% of those who have required hospitalization for Lassa fever die. The risk of death is greater in those who are pregnant. A &quot;Swollen baby syndrome&quot; may occur in newborns, infants and toddlers with pitting edema, abdominal distension and bleeding.

==Cause==
===Virology===

Lassa virus is a member of the Arenaviridae, a family of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. Specifically it is an old world arenavirus, which is enveloped, single-stranded, and bi-segmented RNA. Lassa virus contains both a large and a small genome section, with seven lineages identified to date: Lineages I, II, and III from Nigeria; Lineage IV from Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia; Lineage V from Cote D’Ivoire and Mali Lineage VI from Togo; and Lineage VII from Benin.

===Spread===

Lassa virus commonly spreads to humans from other animals, specifically the &quot;Natal multimammate mouse&quot; or African rat, also called the Natal multimammate rat (&quot;Mastomys natalensis&quot;). This is probably the most common mouse in equatorial Africa, common in human households and eaten as a delicacy in some areas.

The multimammate mouse can quickly produce a large number of offspring, tends to colonize human settlements, increasing the risk of rodent-human contact, and is found throughout the west, central and eastern parts of the African continent.

Once the mouse has become a carrier, it will excrete the virus throughout the rest of its lifetime through feces and urine creating ample opportunity for exposure. The virus is probably transmitted by contact with the feces or urine of animals accessing grain stores in residences. No study has proven presence in breast milk, but the high level of viremia suggests it may be possible.

Individuals who are at a higher risk of contracting the infection are those who live in rural areas where Mastomys are discovered, and where sanitation is not prevalent. Infection typically occurs by direct or indirect exposure to animal excrement through the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts. Inhalation of tiny particles of infectious material (aerosol) is believed to be the most significant means of exposure. It is possible to acquire the infection through broken skin or mucous membranes that are directly exposed to infectious material. Transmission from person to person has been established, presenting a disease risk for healthcare workers. The virus is present in urine for between three and nine weeks after infection, and it can be transmitted in semen for up to three months after becoming infected.

==Diagnosis==

A range of laboratory investigations are performed, where possible, to diagnose the disease and assess its course and complications. The confidence of a diagnosis can be compromised if laboratory tests are not available. One comprising factor is the number of febrile illnesses present in Africa, such as malaria or typhoid fever that could potentially exhibit similar symptoms, particularly for non-specific manifestations of Lassa fever. In cases with abdominal pain, in countries where Lassa is common, Lassa fever is often misdiagnosed as appendicitis and intussusception which delays treatment with the antiviral ribavirin. In West Africa, where Lassa is most common, it is difficult to diagnose due to the absence of proper equipment to perform testing.

The United States FDA has yet to approve a widely validated laboratory test for Lassa, but there are tests that have been able to provide definitive proof of the presence of the LASV virus. These tests include cell cultures, PCR, ELISA antigen assays, plaque neutralization assays, and immunofluorescence essays. However, immunofluorescence essays provide less definitive proof of Lassa infection. An ELISA test for antigen and Immunoglobulin M antibodies give 88% sensitivity and 90% specificity for the presence of the infection. Other laboratory findings in Lassa fever include lymphocytopenia (low lymphocyte white blood cell count), thrombocytopenia (low platelets), and elevated aspartate transaminase levels in the blood. Lassa fever virus can also be found in cerebrospinal fluid.

==Prevention==
Control of the &quot;Mastomys&quot; rodent population is impractical, so measures focus on keeping rodents out of homes and food supplies, encouraging effective personal hygiene, storing grain and other foodstuffs in rodent-proof containers, and disposing of garbage far from the home to help sustain clean households. Gloves, masks, laboratory coats, and goggles are advised while in contact with an infected person, to avoid contact with blood and body fluids. These issues in many countries are monitored by a department of public health. In less developed countries, these types of organizations may not have the necessary means to effectively control outbreaks.

===Vaccine===
There is no vaccine for humans as of 2023. Researchers at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases facility had a promising vaccine candidate in 2002. They have developed a replication-competent vaccine against Lassa virus based on recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vectors expressing the Lassa virus glycoprotein. After a single intramuscular injection, test primates have survived lethal challenge, while showing no clinical symptoms.

==Treatment==
Treatment is directed at addressing dehydration and improving symptoms.

===Medications===
The antiviral medication ribavirin has been recommended, but evidence to support its use is weak. Some evidence has found that it may worsen outcomes in certain cases. Fluid replacement, blood transfusions, and medication for low blood pressure may be required. Intravenous interferon therapy has also been used.

=== Indirect antivirals ===
A potential novel treatment, the NMT inhibitor, has been shown to completely inhibit lassa infection in cells based assays by targeting Z protein and SSP for degradation. Favipiravir, a nucleoside analogue, has been shown to be effective at treating Lassa fever in immunocompetent mouse, guinea pigs and macaques. A case report showed combination favipiravir with ribavirin is effective for lassa fever, with two patients survived. In vivo, the EC50 of favipiravir is 2.89 μg.mL−1and doses larger than 1200 mg twice a day should have the capability to strongly reduce the production infectious virus.

===Pregnancy===
When Lassa fever infects pregnant women late in their third trimester, inducing delivery is necessary for the mother to have a good chance of survival. This is because the virus has an affinity for the placenta and other highly vascular tissues. The fetus has only a one in ten chance of survival no matter what course of action is taken; hence, the focus is always on saving the life of the mother.

==Prognosis==
About 15–20% of hospitalized people with Lassa fever will die from the illness. The overall case fatality rate is estimated to be 1%, but during epidemics, mortality can climb as high as 50%. The mortality rate is greater than 80% when it occurs in pregnant women during their third trimester; fetal death also occurs in nearly all those cases. Abortion decreases the risk of death to the mother. Some survivors experience lasting effects of the disease, and can include partial or complete deafness.

Because of treatment with ribavirin, fatality rates have declined.

==Epidemiology==
There are about 300,000 to 500,000 cases which result in 5,000 deaths a year. One estimate places the number as high as 3 million cases per year.

Estimates of Lassa fever are complicated by the lack of easy-available diagnosis, limited public health surveillance infrastructure, and high clustering of incidence near high intensity sampling.

The infection affects females 1.2 times more than males. The age group predominantly infected is 21–30 years.

===Geography===
Lassa high risk areas are near the western and eastern extremes of West Africa. As of 2018, the Lassa belt includes Guinea, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Liberia. As of 2003, 10-16% of people in Sierra Leone and Liberia admitted to hospital had the virus. The case fatality rate for those who are hospitalized for the disease is about 15-20%. Research showed a twofold increase risk of infection for those living in close proximity to someone with infection symptoms within the last year.

The high risk areas cannot be well defined by any known biogeographical or environmental breaks except for the multimammate rat, particularly Guinea (Kindia, Faranah and Nzérékoré regions), Liberia (mostly in Lofa, Bong, and Nimba counties), Nigeria (in about 10 of 36 states) and Sierra Leone (typically from Kenema and Kailahun districts). It is less common in the Central African Republic, Mali, Senegal and other nearby countries, and less common yet in Ghana and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Benin had its first confirmed cases in 2014, and Togo had its first confirmed cases in 2016.

As of 2013, the spread of Lassa outside of West Africa had been very limited. Twenty to thirty cases had been described in Europe, as being caused by importation through infected individuals. These cases found outside of West Africa were found to have a high fatality risk because of the delay of diagnosis and treatment due to being unaware of the risk associated with the symptoms. Imported cases have not manifested in larger epidemics outside of Africa due to a lack of human to human transmission in hospital settings. An exception had occurred in 2003 when a healthcare worker became infected before the person showed clear symptoms.

In October 2024, a resident of Iowa, United States has passed away due to Lassa fever following a trip to West Africa, as reported by the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services. Health officials indicate the person likely contracted Lassa fever—transmissible through contact with infected body fluids or, potentially, with rodents while abroad, according to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

=== Nigeria ===

====2018 outbreak====
An outbreak of Lassa fever occurred in Nigeria during 2018 and spread to 18 of the country&#x27;s states; it was the largest outbreak of Lassa recorded. On 25 February 2018, there were 1081 suspected cases and 90 reported deaths; 317 of the cases and 72 deaths were confirmed as Lassa which increased to a total of 431 reported cases in 2018.

==== 2019 outbreak ====
The total cases in Nigeria in 2019 was 810 with 167 deaths, the largest case fatality rate (23.3%) until then.

==== 2020 outbreak ====
The epidemic started from the second week of the January. By the tenth week the total number of cases has risen to 855 and deaths to 144, the case fatality rate of 16.8%.

====2021 outbreak====
On the 8th of December 2021, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) was notified of the death of two persons from Lassa fever.

====2022 outbreak====
The epidemic took a new form, from 3 to 30 January 2022, 211 laboratory confirmed Lassa fever cases including 40 deaths (case fatality ratio: 19%) have been cumulatively reported in 14 of the 36 Nigerian states and the Federal Capital Territory across the country. In total from January until March, 132 deaths have been reported with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 19.1% which is lower than the CFR for the same period in 2021 (21.0%).

====2024 outbreak====
In October 2024, a resident of Iowa, United States, died from Lassa fever after traveling to West Africa. This case, confirmed by the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services, underscores the risk of international spread. The individual likely contracted the virus abroad, as Lassa fever spreads through infected rodent excreta or bodily fluids. Health authorities are monitoring close contacts to prevent further transmission.

====2025 outbreak====
Nigeria Centre for Disease Control reports 214 Lassa fever cases, 39 deaths in 2025, which increased compared to that reported for the same period in 2024.

== Liberia ==
Lassa fever is endemic in Liberia. From 1 January 2017 through 23 January 2018, 91 suspected cases were reported from six counties: Bong, Grand Bassa, Grand Kru, Lofa, Margibi, and Nimba. Thirty-three of these cases were laboratory confirmed, including 15 deaths (case fatality rate for confirmed cases = 45.4%).

In February 2020, a total of 24 confirmed cases with nine associated deaths has been reported from nine health districts in six counties. Grand Bossa and Bong counties account for 20 of the confirmed cases.

==History==
The disease was identified in Nigeria in 1969. It is named after the town of Lassa, where it was discovered.

A prominent expert in the disease, Aniru Conteh, died from the disease.

==Research==
The Lassa virus is one of several viruses identified by WHO as a likely cause of a future epidemic. They therefore list it for urgent research and development to develop new diagnostic tests, vaccines, and medicines.

In 2007, SIGA Technologies, studied a medication in guinea pig with Lassa fever. Work on a vaccine is continuing, with multiple approaches showing positive results in animal trials.

<doc id="17888" wikidata="Q33391" url="?curid=17888" title="Leon Trotsky">
<text>Lev Davidovich Bronstein ( – 21 August 1940), better known as Leon Trotsky, was a Russian revolutionary, Soviet politician, and political theorist. He was a central figure in the 1905 Revolution, October Revolution of 1917, Russian Civil War, and establishment of the Soviet Union, from which he was exiled in 1929 before his assassination in 1940. Trotsky and Vladimir Lenin were widely considered the two most prominent Soviet figures from 1917 until Lenin&#x27;s death in 1924. Ideologically a Marxist and a Leninist, Trotsky&#x27;s ideas inspired a school of Marxism known as Trotskyism.

Born into a wealthy Jewish family in Ukraine, then part of the Russian Empire, Trotsky joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1898. He was arrested for revolutionary activities and exiled to Siberia, but in 1902 escaped to London, where he met Lenin and wrote for the party paper &quot;Iskra&quot;. Trotsky initially sided with the Mensheviks against Lenin&#x27;s Bolsheviks in the party&#x27;s 1903 schism, but declared himself non-factional in 1904. During the 1905 Revolution, Trotsky returned to Russia and was elected chairman of the Saint Petersburg Soviet. He was again exiled to Siberia, but escaped in 1907 and lived in Europe and the U.S. After the February Revolution of 1917, Trotsky returned to Russia and joined the Bolsheviks. As the chairman of the Petrograd Soviet, he helped lead the October Revolution, and in Lenin&#x27;s first government he was appointed the People&#x27;s Commissar for Foreign Affairs and led negotiations for the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, by which Russia withdrew from World War I. He served as the People&#x27;s Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs from 1918 to 1925, during which he built the Red Army and led it to victory in the civil war. In 1922, Lenin formed a bloc with Trotsky against the Soviet bureaucracy and several times proposed that he become one of his deputy premiers, but Trotsky declined the post. Beginning in 1923, Trotsky led the party&#x27;s Left Opposition faction, which opposed the market concessions of Lenin&#x27;s New Economic Policy.

After Lenin&#x27;s death in 1924, Trotsky emerged as the most prominent critic of Joseph Stalin, but was quickly outmaneuvered by him politically. Trotsky was expelled from the Politburo in 1926 and from the party in 1927, internally exiled to Alma Ata in 1928, and deported in 1929. He lived in Turkey, France, and Norway before settling in Mexico in 1937. In exile, Trotsky wrote polemics against Stalinism, advocating proletarian internationalism against Stalin&#x27;s theory of socialism in one country. Trotsky&#x27;s theory of permanent revolution held that the socialist revolution could only survive if spread to the advanced capitalist countries. In &quot;The Revolution Betrayed&quot; (1936), he argued that the Soviet Union had become a &quot;degenerated workers&#x27; state&quot; as a consequence of its isolation, and in 1938 founded the Fourth International as an alternative to the Soviet-led Comintern. After being sentenced to death in absentia at the first Moscow show trial in 1936, Trotsky was assassinated in 1940 at his house in Mexico City by the Stalinist agent Ramón Mercader.

Written out of official Soviet history under Stalin, Trotsky was one of the few of his rivals who was never politically rehabilitated by later leaders. In the West, Trotsky emerged as a hero of the anti-Stalinist left for his defense of a more democratic, internationalist form of socialism against Stalinist totalitarianism, and for his intellectual contributions to Marxism. While some of his wartime actions are controversial, such as his ideological defence of the Red Terror and violent suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion, scholarship ranks Trotsky&#x27;s leadership of the Red Army highly among historical figures, and he is credited for his major involvement with the military, economic, cultural and political development of the Soviet Union.

== Childhood and family (1879–1895) ==
Lev Davidovich Bronstein was born on 7 November 1879 into a wealthy Jewish family in Yanovka, Kherson Governorate, Russian Empire (now Bereslavka, Ukraine). He was the fifth child of David Leontyevich Bronstein (1847–1922) and Anna Lvovna (, 1850–1910). His father had lived in Poltava and later moved to Yanovka, as it had a large Jewish community. Trotsky&#x27;s younger sister, Olga, who also grew up to be a Bolshevik and Soviet politician, married fellow Bolshevik Lev Kamenev.

Some authors, notably Robert Service, have claimed that Trotsky&#x27;s childhood first name was Yiddish &quot;Leiba&quot;. The American Trotskyist David North said that this was an assumption based on Trotsky&#x27;s Jewish birth, but, contrary to Service&#x27;s claims, there is no documentary evidence to support his using a Yiddish name, when that language was not spoken by his family. Both North and political historian Walter Laqueur wrote that Trotsky&#x27;s childhood name was &quot;Lyova&quot;, a standard Russian diminutive of the name &quot;Lev&quot;. North has compared the speculation on Trotsky&#x27;s given name to the undue emphasis given to his having a Jewish surname. The language spoken at home was not Yiddish but a mixture of Russian and Ukrainian, known as Surzhyk. Although Trotsky spoke French, English, and German to a good standard, he said in his autobiography &quot;My Life&quot; that he was never fluent in any language but Russian. Raymond Molinier wrote that Trotsky spoke French fluently.

When Trotsky was eight years old, his father sent him to Odessa to be educated. He was enrolled in a Lutheran German-language school (School of the Lutheran St. Pauls Cathedral, of Black Sea Germans, which admitted students of other faiths and backgrounds,) which became Russified during his years in Odessa as a result of the Imperial government&#x27;s policy of Russification. Trotsky and his wife Natalia later registered their children as Lutheran, since Austrian law at the time required children to be given religious education &quot;in the faith of their parents&quot;. Odessa was then a bustling cosmopolitan port city, very unlike the typical Russian city of the time. This environment contributed to the development of the young man&#x27;s international outlook. While attending school, Trotsky excelled academically and showed exceptional aptitude for science and mathematics. Along with his scholastic abilities, he was noted to be a voracious reader and was often disciplined by school officials for reading non-curriculum books during classroom instructions.

== Early political activities and life (1896–1917) ==
=== Revolutionary activity and imprisonment (1896–1898) ===
Trotsky became involved in revolutionary activities in 1896 after moving to the harbor town of Nikolayev on the Black Sea. At first a &quot;narodnik&quot; (revolutionary agrarian socialist populist), he initially opposed Marxism but was won over by his future first wife, Aleksandra Sokolovskaya. That same year, he graduated from his high school with first class honours. According to his relative, Valery Bronstein, his father had intended for Trotsky to become a mechanical engineer after leaving modern school.

Trotsky briefly attended Odessa University where he studied engineering and mathematics. Trotsky&#x27;s university colleague and a prominent engineer who served as the Technical Director of the Baltic Shipyard had noted that he displayed an exceptional gift for mathematics. Despite his capabilities in the engineering department, he quickly grew bored of his studies and began to spend more time reading books on political philosophy and participating in underground revolutionary activities. He dropped out of university in early 1897 to help organize the South Russian Workers&#x27; Union in Nikolayev. Using the name &quot;Lvov&quot;, he wrote and printed leaflets and proclamations, distributed revolutionary pamphlets, and popularized socialist ideas among industrial workers and revolutionary students.

In January 1898, more than 200 members of the union, including Trotsky, were arrested. He was held for the next two years in prison awaiting trial, first in Nikolayev, then Kherson, then Odessa, and finally in Moscow. In the Moscow prison, he came into contact with other revolutionaries, heard about Lenin and read Lenin&#x27;s book, &quot;The Development of Capitalism in Russia&quot;. Two months into his imprisonment, on 1–3 March 1898, the first Congress of the newly formed Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) was held. From then on Trotsky identified as a member of the party.

=== First marriage and Siberian exile (1899–1902) ===
While imprisoned in Moscow, in the summer of 1899, Trotsky married Aleksandra Sokolovskaya (1872–1938), a fellow Marxist. The ceremony was performed by a Jewish chaplain. In 1900, he was sentenced to four years exile in Siberia. Because of their marriage, Trotsky and his wife were allowed to be exiled to the same location in Siberia: Ust-Kut and the Verkholensk in the Baikal Lake region. They had two daughters, Zinaida (1901–1933) and Nina (1902–1928), born in Siberia.

In Siberia, Trotsky read numerous books on history, philosophy, economics, sociology, and the works of Karl Marx with an intent on solidifying his own political stance. He became aware of the differences within the party, which had been decimated by arrests in 1898 and 1899. Some social democrats known in Leninist phraseology as &quot;economists&quot; argued the party should focus on helping industrial workers improve their lot and were less concerned with changing the government. They believed that societal reforms would grow out of the worker&#x27;s struggle for higher pay and better working conditions. Others argued that overthrowing the monarchy was more important and that a well-organized and disciplined revolutionary party was essential. The latter position was expressed by the London-based newspaper &quot;Iskra&quot; (&quot;The Spark&quot;), founded in 1900. Trotsky quickly sided with the &quot;Iskra&quot; position and began writing for the paper.

In the summer of 1902, at the urging of his wife, Aleksandra, Trotsky escaped from Siberia hidden in hay. Aleksandra later escaped with their daughters. Both daughters married, and Zinaida had children, but the daughters died before their parents. Nina Nevelson died from tuberculosis in 1928, cared for in her last months by her older sister. Zinaida Volkova followed her father into exile in Berlin, taking her son by her second marriage but leaving behind a daughter in Russia. Suffering also from tuberculosis and depression, Zinaida committed suicide in 1933. Aleksandra disappeared in 1935 during the Great Purges under Stalin and was murdered by Soviet forces three years later.

=== First emigration and second marriage (1902–1903) ===
Until this point, Trotsky had used his birth name: Lev (Leon) Bronstein. He changed his surname to &quot;Trotsky&quot;, the name he would use for the rest of his life. It is said he adopted the name of a jailer of the Odessa prison in which he had earlier been held. This became his primary revolutionary pseudonym. After escape from Siberia, Trotsky moved to London, joining Georgi Plekhanov, Vladimir Lenin, Julius Martov, and other editors of &quot;Iskra&quot;. Under the pen name &quot;Pero&quot; (&quot;quill&quot; or &quot;pen&quot;), Trotsky soon became one of the paper&#x27;s leading writers.
Unknown to Trotsky, the six editors of &quot;Iskra&quot; were evenly split between the &quot;old guard&quot; led by Plekhanov and the &quot;new guard&quot; led by Lenin and Martov. Plekhanov&#x27;s supporters were older, and had spent the previous 20 years together in exile in Europe. Members of the new guard were in their early 30s and only recently emigrated from Russia. Lenin, who was trying to establish a permanent majority against Plekhanov within &quot;Iskra,&quot; expected Trotsky, then 23, to side with the new guard. In March 1903 Lenin wrote:
 Because of Plekhanov&#x27;s opposition, Trotsky did not become a full member of the board. But participated in its meetings in an advisory capacity, which earned him Plekhanov&#x27;s enmity.

In late 1902, Trotsky met Natalia Sedova (1882–1962), who soon became his companion. They married in 1903, and she was with him until his death. They had two children together, Lev Sedov (1906–1938) and Sergei Sedov (1908–1937), both of whom would predecease their parents. Regarding his sons&#x27; surnames, Trotsky later explained that after the 1917 revolution:
Trotsky never used the name &quot;Sedov&quot; either privately or publicly. Natalia Sedova sometimes signed her name &quot;Sedova-Trotskaya&quot;.

=== Split with Lenin (1903–1904) ===
In the meantime, after a period of secret police repression and internal confusion that followed the First Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1898, &quot;Iskra&quot; succeeded in convening the party&#x27;s Second Congress in London in August 1903. Trotsky and other &quot;Iskra&quot; editors attended. The first congress went as planned, with &quot;Iskra&quot; supporters handily defeating the few &quot;economist&quot; delegates. Then the congress discussed the position of the Jewish Bund, which had co-founded the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) in 1898 but wanted to remain autonomous within the party.

Shortly afterwards, the pro-Iskra delegates unexpectedly split into two factions. The split was initially over an organisational issue. Lenin and his supporters, the Bolsheviks, argued for a smaller but highly organized party where only party members would be seen as members, while Martov and his supporters, the Mensheviks, argued for a bigger and less disciplined party where people who assisted would also be seen as members. In a surprise development, Trotsky and most of the Iskra editors supported Martov and the Mensheviks, while Plekhanov supported Lenin and the Bolsheviks. During 1903 and 1904, many members changed sides in the factions. Trotsky left the Mensheviks in September 1904 over their insistence on an alliance with Russian liberals and their opposition to a reconciliation with Lenin and the Bolsheviks.

From 1904 until 1917, Trotsky described himself as a &quot;non-factional social democrat&quot;. He tried to reconcile different groups within the party, which resulted in many clashes with Lenin and other prominent party members. Trotsky later maintained that he had been wrong in opposing Lenin on the issue of the party. Trotsky began developing his theory of permanent revolution and developed a close working relationship with Alexander Parvus in 1904–07. During their split, Lenin referred to Trotsky as &quot;Little Judas&quot; (&quot;Iudushka&quot;, based on the character from Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin&#x27;s novel &quot;The Golovlyov Family&quot;), a &quot;scoundrel&quot; and a &quot;swine&quot;.

=== 1905 revolution and trial (1905–1906) ===
The unrest and agitation against the Russian government came to a head in Saint Petersburg on 3 January 1905 (Julian Calendar), when a strike broke out at the Putilov Works in the city. This single strike grew into a general strike, and by 7 January 1905, there were 140,000 strikers in Saint Petersburg.

On Sunday, 9 January 1905, Father Georgi Gapon knowingly led a procession of radicals mixed within larger groups of ordinary working citizens through the streets to the Winter Palace to supposedly beseech the Tsar for food and relief from the government. According to Gapon himself, he led the people into a Palace Guard already on the defensive due to the crowd instigating violence against them. They eventually fired on the demonstration, resulting in the deaths of an unknown number of violent radicals, peaceful demonstrators and police caught within the melee. Although Sunday, 9 January 1905, became known as Bloody Sunday, Gapon&#x27;s own biography points to a conspiracy. This was later confirmed by Russian police records listing the number of known militant radicals found among the dead.

Following the events of Bloody Sunday, Trotsky secretly returned to Russia in February 1905, by way of Kiev. At first he wrote leaflets for an underground printing press in Kiev, but soon moved to the capital, Saint Petersburg. There he worked with both Bolsheviks, such as Central Committee member Leonid Krasin, and the local Menshevik committee, which he pushed in a more radical direction. The latter, however, were betrayed by a secret police agent in May, and Trotsky had to flee to rural Finland. There he worked on fleshing out his theory of permanent revolution.

On 19 September 1905, the typesetters at the Ivan Sytin&#x27;s printing house in Moscow went out on strike for shorter hours and higher pay. By the evening of 24 September, the workers at 50 other printing shops in Moscow were also on strike. On 2 October 1905, the typesetters in printing shops in Saint Petersburg decided to strike in support of the Moscow strikers. On 7 October 1905, the railway workers of the Moscow–Kazan Railway went out on strike. Amid the resulting confusion, Trotsky returned from Finland to Saint Petersburg on 15 October 1905. On that day, Trotsky spoke before the Saint Petersburg Soviet Council of Workers Deputies, which was meeting at the Technological Institute in the city. Also attending were some 200,000 people crowded outside to hear the speeches—about half of all workers in Saint Petersburg.
After his return, Trotsky and Parvus took over the newspaper &quot;Russian Gazette,&quot; increasing its circulation to 500,000. Trotsky also co-founded, together with Parvus and Julius Martov and other Mensheviks, &quot;Nachalo&quot; (&quot;The Beginning&quot;), which also proved to be a very successful newspaper in the revolutionary atmosphere of Saint Petersburg in 1905.

Just before Trotsky&#x27;s return, the Mensheviks had independently come up with the same idea that Trotsky had: an elected non-party revolutionary organization representing the capital&#x27;s workers, the first Soviet (&quot;Council&quot;) of Workers. By the time of Trotsky&#x27;s arrival, the Saint Petersburg Soviet was already functioning, headed by Khrustalyev-Nosar (Georgy Nosar, alias Pyotr Khrustalyov). Khrustalyev-Nosar had been a compromise figure when elected as the head of the Saint Petersburg Soviet. He was a lawyer that stood above the political factions contained in the Soviet.

However, since his election, he proved to be very popular with the workers in spite of the Bolsheviks&#x27; original opposition to him. Khrustalev-Nosar became famous in his position as spokesman for the Saint Petersburg Soviet. Indeed, to the outside world, Khrustalev-Nosar was the embodiment of the Saint Petersburg Soviet. Trotsky joined the Soviet under the name &quot;Yanovsky&quot; (after the village he was born in, Yanovka) and was elected vice-chairman. He did much of the actual work at the Soviet and, after Khrustalev-Nosar&#x27;s arrest on 26 November 1905, was elected its chairman. On 2 December, the Soviet issued a proclamation which included the following statement about the Tsarist government and its foreign debts: 

The following day, on 3 December 1905, the Soviet was surrounded by troops loyal to the government and the deputies were arrested. Trotsky and other Soviet leaders were tried in 1906 on charges of supporting an armed rebellion. On 4 October 1906 he was convicted and sentenced to internal exile to Siberia.

=== Second emigration (1907–1914) ===
While en route to exile in Obdorsk, Siberia, in January 1907, Trotsky escaped at Berezov and once again made his way to London. He attended the 5th Congress of the RSDLP. In October, he moved to Vienna, Austria-Hungary. For the next seven years, he often took part in the activities of the Austrian Social Democratic Party and, occasionally, of the German Social Democratic Party.

In Vienna, Trotsky became close to Adolph Joffe, his friend for the next 20 years, who introduced him to psychoanalysis.
In October 1908 he was asked to join the editorial staff of &quot;Pravda&quot; (&quot;Truth&quot;), a bi-weekly, Russian-language social democratic paper for Russian workers, which he co-edited with Adolph Joffe and Matvey Skobelev. It was smuggled into Russia. The paper appeared very irregularly; only five issues were published in its first year.

Avoiding factional politics, the paper proved popular with Russian industrial workers. Both the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks split multiple times after the failure of the 1905–1907 revolution. Money was very scarce for the publication of &quot;Pravda&quot;. Trotsky approached the Russian Central Committee to seek financial backing for the newspaper throughout 1909.

A majority of Bolsheviks controlled the Central Committee in 1910. Lenin agreed to the financing of &quot;Pravda&quot;, but required a Bolshevik to be appointed as co-editor of the paper. When various Bolshevik and Menshevik factions tried to re-unite at the January 1910 RSDLP Central Committee meeting in Paris over Lenin&#x27;s objections, Trotsky&#x27;s &quot;Pravda&quot; was made a party-financed &#x27;central organ&#x27;. Lev Kamenev, Trotsky&#x27;s brother-in-law, was added to the editorial board from the Bolsheviks, but the unification attempts failed in August 1910. Kamenev resigned from the board amid mutual recriminations. Trotsky continued publishing &quot;Pravda&quot; for another two years until it finally folded in April 1912.

The Bolsheviks started a new workers-oriented newspaper in Saint Petersburg on 22 April 1912 and also called it &quot;Pravda&quot;. Trotsky was so upset by what he saw as a usurpation of his newspaper&#x27;s name that in April 1913, he wrote a letter to Nikolay Chkheidze, a Menshevik leader, bitterly denouncing Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Though he quickly got over the disagreement, the message was intercepted by the Russian secret police, and a copy was put into their archives. Shortly after Lenin&#x27;s death in 1924, the letter was found and publicized by Trotsky&#x27;s opponents within the Communist Party to portray him as Lenin&#x27;s enemy.

The 1910s were a period of heightened tension within the RSDLP, leading to numerous frictions between Trotsky, the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. The most serious disagreement that Trotsky and the Mensheviks had with Lenin at the time was over the issue of &quot;expropriations&quot;, i.e., armed robbery of banks and other companies by Bolshevik groups to procure money for the Party. These actions had been banned by the 5th Congress, but were continued by the Bolsheviks.
In January 1912, the majority of the Bolshevik faction, led by Lenin, as well as a few defecting Mensheviks, held a conference in Prague and decided to break away from the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, and formed a new party, the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks). In response, Trotsky organized a &quot;unification&quot; conference of social democratic factions in Vienna in August 1912 (a.k.a. &quot;The August Bloc&quot;) and tried to re-unite the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks into one party. The attempt was generally unsuccessful.

In Vienna, Trotsky continuously published articles in radical Russian and Ukrainian newspapers, such as &quot;Kievskaya Mysl,&quot; under a variety of pseudonyms, often using &quot;Antid Oto&quot;, a name chosen at random from an Italian dictionary, with Trotsky joking that &quot;wanted to inject the Marxist antidote into the legitimate newspapers&quot;. In September 1912, &quot;Kievskaya Mysl&quot; sent him to the Balkans as its war correspondent, where he covered the two Balkan Wars for the next year. While there, Trotsky chronicled the ethnic cleansing carried out by the Serbian army against the Albanian civilian population. He became a close friend of Christian Rakovsky, later a leading Soviet politician and Trotsky&#x27;s ally in the Soviet Communist Party. On 3 August 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, in which Austria-Hungary fought against the Russian Empire, Trotsky was forced to flee Vienna for neutral Switzerland to avoid arrest as a Russian émigré.

=== World War I (1914–1917) ===
The outbreak of World War I caused a sudden realignment within the RSDLP and other European social democratic parties over the issues of war, revolution, pacifism and internationalism, redividing the party into defeatists and defencists. Within the RSDLP, Lenin, Trotsky and Martov advocated various internationalist anti-war positions that saw defeat for your own country&#x27;s ruling class imperialists as the &quot;lesser evil&quot; in the war, while they opposed all imperialists in the imperialist war. These anti-war believers were known as &quot;defeatists&quot;. Those who supported one side over the other in the war were known as &quot;defencists&quot;. Plekhanov and many other defencist social democrats (both Bolsheviks and Mensheviks) supported the Russian government to some extent and wanted them to win the war, while Trotsky&#x27;s ex-colleague Parvus, now a defencist, sided against Russia so strongly that he wanted Germany to win the war. In Switzerland, Trotsky briefly worked within the Swiss Socialist Party, prompting it to adopt an internationalist resolution. He wrote a book opposing the war, &quot;The War and the International,&quot; and the pro-war position taken by the European social democratic parties, primarily the German party.

As a war correspondent for the &quot;Kievskaya Mysl&quot;, Trotsky moved to France on 19 November 1914. In January 1915 in Paris, he began editing (at first with Martov, who soon resigned as the paper moved to the left) &quot;Nashe Slovo&quot; (&quot;Our Word&quot;), an internationalist socialist newspaper. He adopted the slogan of &quot;peace without indemnities or annexations, peace without conquerors or conquered.&quot; Lenin advocated Russia&#x27;s defeat in the war and demanded a complete break with the Second International.

Trotsky attended the Zimmerwald Conference of anti-war socialists in September 1915 and advocated a middle course between those who, like Martov, would stay within the Second International at any cost and those who, like Lenin, would break with the Second International and form a Third International. The conference adopted the middle line proposed by Trotsky. At first opposed, in the end Lenin voted for Trotsky&#x27;s resolution to avoid a split among anti-war socialists.

In September 1916, Trotsky was deported from France to Spain for his anti-war activities. Spanish authorities did not want him and deported him to the United States on 25 December 1916. He arrived in New York City on 13 January 1917. He stayed for over two months at 1522 Vyse Avenue in The Bronx. In New York he wrote articles for the local Russian language socialist newspaper, &quot;Novy Mir,&quot; and the Yiddish-language daily, &quot;Der Forverts&quot; (&quot;Forward&quot;), in translation. He also made speeches to Russian émigrés.

Trotsky was living in New York City when the February Revolution of 1917 led to the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II. He left New York onboard SS &quot;Kristianiafjord&quot; on 27 March 1917, but his ship was stopped by the Royal Navy at Halifax, Nova Scotia. Trotsky was arrested and detained for a month at the Amherst Internment Camp in Nova Scotia. While imprisoned in the camp, Trotsky established an increasing friendship with the workers and sailors amongst his fellow inmates, describing his month at the camp as &quot;one continual mass meeting&quot;.

Trotsky&#x27;s speeches and agitation incurred the wrath of German inmates at the camp, who complained to its commander, a Colonel Morris, about Trotsky&#x27;s &quot;anti-patriotic&quot; attitude. Morris subsequently forbade Trotsky from making any more public speeches, leading to 530 prisoners protesting and signing a petition against Morris&#x27; decision. Back in Russia, after initial hesitation and facing pressure from the workers&#x27; and peasants&#x27; Soviets, the Russian foreign minister Pavel Milyukov was compelled to demand the release of Trotsky as a Russian citizen, and the British government freed him on 29 April 1917.

He reached Russia on 17 May 1917. After his return, Trotsky substantially agreed with the Bolshevik position, but did not join them right away. Russian social democrats were split into at least six groups, and the Bolsheviks were waiting for the next party Congress to determine which factions to merge with. Trotsky temporarily joined the Mezhraiontsy, a regional social democratic organization in Petrograd, and became one of its leaders. At the First Congress of Soviets in June, he was elected a member of the first All-Russian Central Executive Committee (&quot;VTsIK&quot;) from the Mezhraiontsy faction.

After an unsuccessful pro-Bolshevik uprising in Petrograd, Trotsky was arrested on 7 August 1917. He was released 40 days later in the aftermath of the failed counter-revolutionary uprising by Lavr Kornilov. After the Bolsheviks gained a majority in the Petrograd Soviet, Trotsky was elected chairman on .

Trotsky sided with Lenin against Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev when the Bolshevik Central Committee discussed staging an armed uprising, and he led the efforts to overthrow the Russian Provisional Government headed by socialist Aleksandr Kerensky.

The following summary of Trotsky&#x27;s role in 1917 was written by Joseph Stalin in &quot;Pravda&quot;, 6 November 1918. Although this passage was quoted in Stalin&#x27;s book &quot;The October Revolution&quot; (1934), it was expunged from Stalin&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot; (1949).
After the success of the October Revolution on 7–8 November 1917, Trotsky led the efforts to repel a counter-attack by Cossacks under General Pyotr Krasnov and other troops still loyal to the overthrown Provisional Government at Gatchina. Allied with Lenin, he defeated attempts by other Bolshevik Central Committee members (Zinoviev, Kamenev, Rykov, etc.) to share power with other moderate, socialist parties. 
Trotsky was an outspoken advocate for a predominantly Bolshevik government and was reluctant to recall Mensheviks as partners after their voluntary withdrawal from the Congress of the Soviets. However, he released several socialist ministers from prison, and neither Trotsky nor his colleagues in 1917 wished to suppress these parties. The Bolsheviks also reserved a number of vacant seats in the Soviets and Central Executive for the parties in proportion to their vote share at the Congress.

At the same time, a number of prominent members of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries had assumed positions in Lenin&#x27;s government and lead commissariats in several areas. This included agriculture (Kolegaev), property (Karelin), justice (Steinberg), post offices and telegraphs (Proshian) and local government (Trutovsky).

According to Deutscher, the Mensheviks and Social Revolutionaries presented a number of demands for a coalition government. These demands proposed disarming the Bolshevik detachments and excluding Lenin and Trotsky from the coalition. This was seen as unacceptable to even the most moderate, Bolshevik negotiators such as Kamenev and Sokolnikov.

By the end of 1917, Trotsky was unquestionably the second man in the Bolshevik Party after Lenin. He overshadowed Zinoviev, who had been Lenin&#x27;s top lieutenant over the previous decade.

== Russian Revolution and aftermath ==
=== Commissar for Foreign Affairs and Brest-Litovsk (1917–1918) ===
After the Bolsheviks came to power, Trotsky became the People&#x27;s Commissar for Foreign Affairs and published the secret treaties previously signed by the Triple Entente that detailed plans for post-war reallocation of colonies and redrawing state borders. On 23 November 1917, Trotsky revealed the secret treaty arrangements which had been made between the Tsarist government, Britain and France, causing them considerable embarrassment.

==== Brest-Litovsk ====
In preparation for peace talks with the representatives of the Imperial German government and the representatives of the other Central Powers leading up to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Leon Trotsky appointed his old friend Joffe to represent the Bolsheviks. When the Soviet delegation learned that Germans and Austro-Hungarians planned to annex slices of Polish territory and to set up a rump Polish state with what remained, while the Baltic provinces were to become client states ruled by German princes, the talks were recessed for 12 days.

The Soviets&#x27; only hopes were that, given time, their allies would agree to join the negotiations or that the western European proletariat would revolt, so their best strategy was to prolong the negotiations. As Foreign Minister Leon Trotsky wrote, &quot;To delay negotiations, there must be someone to do the delaying&quot;. Therefore, Trotsky replaced Joffe as the leader of the Soviet delegation during the peace negotiations in Brest-Litovsk from 22 December 1917 to 10 February 1918. At that time the Soviet government was split on the issue. Left Communists, led by Nikolai Bukharin, continued to believe that there could be no peace between a Soviet republic and a capitalist empire, and that only a revolutionary war leading to a pan-European Soviet republic would bring a durable peace.

They cited the successes of the newly formed (15 January 1918) voluntary Red Army against Polish forces of Gen. Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki in Belarus, White forces in the Don region, and newly independent Ukrainian forces as proof that the Red Army could repel German forces, especially if propaganda and asymmetrical warfare were used.

They were willing to hold talks with the Germans as a means of exposing German imperial ambitions (territorial gains, reparations, etc.) in the hope of accelerating the hoped−for Soviet revolution in the West. Still, they were dead set against signing any peace treaty. In the case of a German ultimatum, they advocated proclaiming a revolutionary war against Germany to inspire Russian and European workers to fight for socialism. This opinion was shared by Left Socialist Revolutionaries, who were then the Bolsheviks&#x27; junior partners in a coalition government.

Lenin, who had earlier hoped for a speedy Soviet revolution in Germany and other parts of Europe, quickly decided that the Imperial government of Germany was still firmly in control and that, without a strong Russian military, an armed conflict with Germany would lead to a collapse of the Soviet government in Russia. He agreed with the Left Communists that ultimately a pan-European Soviet revolution would solve all problems, but until then the Bolsheviks had to stay in power. Lenin did not mind prolonging the negotiating process for maximum propaganda effect, but, from January 1918 on, advocated signing a separate peace treaty if faced with a German ultimatum. Trotsky&#x27;s position was between these two Bolshevik factions. Like Lenin, he admitted that the old Russian military, inherited from the monarchy and the Provisional Government and in advanced stages of decomposition, was unable to fight:

But he agreed with the Left Communists that a separate peace treaty with an imperialist power would be a terrible morale and material blow to the Soviet government, negate all its military and political successes of 1917 and 1918, resurrect the notion that the Bolsheviks secretly allied with the German government, and cause an upsurge of internal resistance. He argued that any German ultimatum should be refused, and that this might well lead to an uprising in Germany, or at least inspire German soldiers to disobey their officers since any German offensive would be a naked land grab for territories. Trotsky wrote in 1925:

Trotsky, in a letter he wrote to Lenin during the negotiations, which must have been written before 18 January 1918, described its policy, summarily, as follows:

However, even though Lenin was in favor of a peace, due to party opposition, he responded with these messages from 18 January 1918: &quot;Stalin has just arrived; we will look into the matter with him and let you have a joint answer right away,&quot; and &quot;please adjourn proceedings and leave for Petrograd. Send a reply; I will wait. Lenin, Stalin.&quot; As it was remarked by Trotsky that, &quot;[... p]ossibly this answer already showed that he did not agree with my proposition (...)&quot;, Trotsky returned to Petrograd to debate with Lenin. During his debate with Trotsky, Lenin concluded: &quot;(...) In any case, I stand for the immediate signing of peace; it is safer.&quot;

However, after debates with the German delegation, Trotsky and the Russian delegation withdrew from peace talks on 10 February 1918, by declaring ending the war on the side of Soviet Russia, and not signing a peace treaty. Privately, in correspondence with Count Otto von Czernin, Trotsky had expressed his willigness to relent to peace terms upon the resumption of a German offensive although with moral dissent. Contrary to Russia&#x27;s declaration, Germany resumed military operations on 18 February. Within a day, it became clear that the German army was capable of conducting offensive operations and that Red Army detachments, which were relatively small, poorly organized, and poorly led, were no match for it. On the evening of 18 February 1918, Trotsky and his supporters in the committee abstained, and Lenin&#x27;s proposal was accepted 7–4. The Soviet government sent a radiogram to the German side, taking the final Brest-Litovsk peace terms.

Germany did not respond for three days and continued its offensive, encountering little resistance. The response arrived on 21 February, but the proposed terms were so harsh that even Lenin briefly thought that the Soviet government had no choice but to fight. But in the end, the committee again voted 7–4 on 23 February 1918; the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed on 3 March and ratified on 15 March 1918. Since Trotsky was so closely associated with the policy previously followed by the Soviet delegation at Brest-Litovsk, he resigned from his position as Commissar for Foreign Affairs to remove a potential obstacle to the new policy.

=== Head of the Red Army (spring 1918) ===
On 13 March 1918, Trotsky&#x27;s resignation as Commissar for Foreign Affairs was officially accepted, and he was appointed People&#x27;s Commissar of Army and Navy Affairs—in place of Podvoisky—and chairman of the Supreme Military Council. The post of commander-in-chief was abolished, and Trotsky gained full control of the Red Army, responsible only to the Communist Party leadership, whose Left Socialist Revolutionary allies had left the government over the controversial treaty of Brest-Litovsk.

The entire Bolshevik leadership of the Red Army, including People&#x27;s Commissar (defence minister) Nikolai Podvoisky and commander-in-chief Nikolai Krylenko, protested vigorously against Trotsky&#x27;s appointment and eventually resigned. They believed that the Red Army should consist only of dedicated revolutionaries, rely on propaganda and force, and have elected officers. They viewed former imperial officers and generals as potential traitors who should be kept out of the new military, much less put in charge of it. Their views continued to be popular with many Bolsheviks throughout most of the Russian Civil War, and their supporters, including Podvoisky, who became one of Trotsky&#x27;s deputies, were a constant thorn in Trotsky&#x27;s side. The discontent with Trotsky&#x27;s policies of strict discipline, forced conscription and reliance on carefully supervised non-Communist military experts eventually led to the Military Opposition, which was active within the Communist Party in late 1918–1919.

=== Civil War (1918–1920) ===
==== 1918 ====
The military situation soon tested Trotsky&#x27;s managerial and organization-building skills. In May–June 1918, the Czechoslovak Legions &quot;en route&quot; from European Russia to Vladivostok rose against the Soviet government. This left the Bolsheviks with the loss of most of the country&#x27;s territory, an increasingly well-organized resistance by Russian anti-Communist forces (usually referred to as the White Army after their best-known component) and widespread defection by the military experts whom Trotsky relied on.

Trotsky and the government responded with a full-fledged mobilization, which increased the size of the Red Army from fewer than 300,000 in May 1918 to one million in October, and an introduction of political commissars into the army. The latter had the task of ensuring the loyalty of military experts (mostly former officers in the Imperial Army) and co-signing their orders. Trotsky regarded the organisation of the Red Army as built on the ideas of the October Revolution. As he later wrote in his autobiography:
Another controversial feature of his military decisions was to inaugurate hostage-taking of relatives of ex-Tsarist officials working in the Red Army to avert the risk of defection or betrayal. Service pointed out that this practice was exercised by both Red and White armies during the Civil War.

Trotsky would later defend his decision and argue that none of the families of ex-officials who did betray the army and contribute to additional human casualties were themselves ever executed. He would also insist that had these draconian measures been adopted rather than excess &quot;magnanimity&quot; to opponents at the start of the October Revolution then Russia would have experienced far less casualties. Deutscher draws attention to the fact that Trotsky preferred to exchange hostages and prisoners rather than execute them. He recounts that Trotsky had released General Krasnov on parole in 1918 after the Kerensky–Krasnov uprising during the initial stage of the civil war but the general would take up arms against the Soviets shortly again afterwards.

===== Red Terror =====
Arising after assassination attempts on Lenin and Trotsky along with the successful assassinations of Petrograd Cheka leader Moisei Uritsky and party editor V. Volodarsky, the Red Terror was enacted. The French Reign of Terror has been viewed as an influence and a model for the civil war repressions. The decision to enact the Red Terror was also driven by initial White Army massacres of &quot;Red&quot; prisoners in 1917, allied intervention in the Russian Civil War and the large-scale massacres of Reds during the Finnish Civil War in which 10,000-20,000 workers had been liquidated by the Finnish Whites. In his book, &quot;Terrorism and Communism,&quot; Trotsky argued that the reign of terror in Russia began with the White Terror under the White Guard forces and the Bolsheviks responded with the Red Terror.

Felix Dzerzhinsky was tasked with rooting out counter-revolutionary threats and appointed director of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission (aka Cheka), a predecessor of the KGB that served as the secret police. From early 1918, the Bolsheviks started physical elimination of opposition and other socialist and revolutionary fractions, anarchists among the first. On 11 August 1918, prior to the events that would officially catalyze the Terror, Lenin sent telegrams &quot;to introduce mass terror&quot; in Nizhny Novgorod in response to a suspected civilian uprising, and to &quot;crush&quot; landowners who resisted, sometimes violently, the requisitioning of their grain by military detachments.

On 30 August, Socialist Revolutionary Fanny Kaplan unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate Vladimir Lenin. In September, Trotsky rushed back from the far-eastern front of the civil war to Moscow after the second day of the shooting and Stalin remained in Tsaritsyn. Kaplan referenced the Bolsheviks&#x27; growing authoritarianism. These events persuaded the government to heed Dzerzhinsky&#x27;s lobbying for greater terror against opposition. The campaign of mass repressions would officially begin thereafter. The Red Terror is began between 17 and 30 August 1918. Regarding the Red Terror Trotsky wrote:

===== Desertions =====
In dealing with deserters, Trotsky appealed to them politically, arousing them with the ideas of the Revolution.
The first use of the punitive barrier troops by the Red Army occurred in the summer and fall of 1918 in the Eastern front during the Russian Civil War, when People&#x27;s Commissar of Military and Naval Affairs (War Commissar) Trotsky authorized Mikhail Tukhachevsky, commander of the 1st Army, to station blocking detachments behind unreliable infantry regiments, with orders to shoot if front-line troops either deserted or retreated without permission. The barrier troops comprised personnel drawn from Cheka punitive detachments or regular infantry regiments.

In December 1918, Trotsky ordered detachments of additional barrier troops be raised for attachment to each infantry formation. On 18 December he cabled: &quot;How do things stand with the blocking units? As far as I am aware they have not been included in our establishment and it appears they have no personnel. It is absolutely essential that we have at least an embryonic network of blocking units and that we work out a procedure for bringing them up to strength and deploying them.&quot; The barrier troops were also used to enforce Bolshevik control over food supplies in areas controlled by the army, a role which earned them the hatred of the civilian population.
Given the lack of manpower and the 16 opposing foreign armies, Trotsky insisted on the use of former Tsarist officers as military specialists within the army, in combination with Bolshevik political commissars to ensure the revolutionary nature of the Red Army. Lenin commented on this:

In September 1918, the Bolshevik government, facing military difficulties, declared what amounted to martial law and reorganized the Red Army. The Supreme Military Council was abolished, and the position of commander-in-chief was restored, filled by the commander of the Latvian Riflemen, Jukums Vācietis, who had formerly led the Eastern Front against the Czechoslovak Legions. Vatsetis took charge of the day-to-day operations. Trotsky became chairman of the newly formed Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic and retained overall control of the military. Trotsky and Vatsetis had clashed earlier in 1918, while Vatsetis and Trotsky&#x27;s adviser Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich were also on unfriendly terms. Nevertheless, Trotsky eventually established a working relationship with the often prickly Vatsetis.

The reorganization caused yet another conflict, this time between Trotsky and Stalin, in late September. Trotsky appointed former imperial general Pavel Pavlovich Sytin to command the Southern Front, but in early October 1918 Stalin refused to accept him and so he was recalled from the front. Lenin and Yakov Sverdlov tried to make Trotsky and Stalin reconcile, but their meeting proved unsuccessful.

In 1919, 612 &quot;hardcore&quot; deserters of the total 837,000 draft dodgers and deserters were executed following Trotsky&#x27;s dracionan measures. According to Orlando Figes, most &quot;deserters...were handed back to the military authorities, and formed into units for transfer to one of the rear armies or directly to the front&quot;. Even those registered as &quot;malicious&quot; deserters were returned to the ranks when the demand for reinforcements became desperate&quot;. Forges noted that the Red Army instituted amnesty weeks to prohibit punitive measures against desertion which encouraged the voluntary return of 98,000-132,000 deserters.

==== 1919 ====
Throughout late 1918 and early 1919, there were a number of attacks on Trotsky&#x27;s leadership of the Red Army, including veiled accusations in newspaper articles inspired by Stalin and a direct attack by the Military Opposition at the VIIIth Party Congress in March 1919. On the surface, he weathered them successfully and was elected one of only five full members of the first Politburo after the Congress. But he later wrote:

In mid-1919, the dissatisfied had an opportunity to mount a serious challenge to Trotsky&#x27;s leadership: the Red Army grew from 800,000 to 3,000,000 and fought simultaneously on sixteen fronts.

At the 3–4 July Central Committee meeting, after a heated exchange, the majority supported Kamenev and Smilga against Vācietis and Trotsky. Trotsky&#x27;s plan was rejected, and he was much criticized for various alleged shortcomings in his leadership style, much of it of a personal nature. Stalin used this opportunity to pressure Lenin to dismiss Trotsky from his post.

However, some significant changes to the leadership of the Red Army were made. Trotsky was temporarily sent to the Southern Front, while Smilga informally coordinated the work in Moscow. Most members of the Revolutionary Military Council who were not involved in its day-to-day operations were relieved of their duties on 8 July, and new members, including Smilga, were added. The same day, while Trotsky was in the south, Vācietis was suddenly arrested by the Cheka on suspicion of involvement in an anti-Soviet plot, and replaced by Sergey Kamenev. After a few weeks in the south, Trotsky returned to Moscow and resumed control of the Red Army. A year later, Smilga and Tukhachevsky were defeated during the Battle of Warsaw, but Trotsky refused this opportunity to pay Smilga back, which earned him Smilga&#x27;s friendship and later his support during the intra-Party battles of the 1920s.

By October 1919, the government was in the worst crisis of the Civil War: Denikin&#x27;s troops approached Tula and Moscow from the south, and General Nikolay Yudenich&#x27;s troops approached Petrograd from the west. Lenin decided that since it was more important to defend Moscow, Petrograd would have to be abandoned. Trotsky argued that Petrograd needed to be defended, at least in part to prevent Estonia and Finland from intervening. In a rare reversal, Trotsky was supported by Stalin and Zinoviev, and prevailed against Lenin in the Central Committee.

==== 1920 ====
With the defeat of Denikin and Yudenich in late 1919, the Soviet government&#x27;s emphasis shifted to the economy. Trotsky spent the winter of 1919–20 in the Urals region trying to restart its economy. A false rumor of his assassination circulated in Germany and the international press on New Year&#x27;s Day 1920. Based on his experiences, he proposed abandoning the policies of War Communism, which included confiscating grain from peasants, and partially restoring the grain market. Still committed to War Communism, Lenin rejected his proposal.

In early 1920, Soviet–Polish tensions eventually led to the Polish–Soviet War. In the run-up and during the war, Trotsky argued that the Red Army was exhausted and the Soviet government should sign a peace treaty with Poland as soon as possible. He did not believe that the Red Army would find much support in Poland proper. Lenin later wrote that he and other Bolshevik leaders believed the Red Army&#x27;s successes in the Russian Civil War and against the Poles meant &quot;The defensive period of the war with worldwide imperialism was over, and we could, and had the obligation to, exploit the military situation to launch an offensive war.&quot;

Poland defeated the Red Army, and the offensive was turned back during the Battle of Warsaw in August 1920. Back in Moscow, Trotsky again argued for a peace treaty, and this time prevailed.

=== Trade union debate (1920–1921) ===

During the trade union debate of 1920–1921, Trotsky argued that trade unions should be integrated directly into the state apparatus, advocating for a &quot;militarization of labor&quot; to rebuild the Soviet economy after the Civil War. He believed that in a workers&#x27; state, the state should control the unions, with workers being treated as &quot;soldiers of labor&quot; under strict discipline.

This position was sharply criticized by Vladimir Lenin, who argued that trade unions should retain some independence from the state and act as &quot;schools of communism&quot; rather than instruments of state control. Lenin&#x27;s view won out at the 10th Congress in 1921, and several of Trotsky&#x27;s supporters, including Nikolay Krestinsky, lost their leadership positions.

=== Kronstadt rebellion ===
In March 1921, during the Kronstadt Rebellion, sailors and soldiers in the naval base of Kronstadt rose up against the Bolshevik government, demanding greater freedom for workers and peasants, an end to one-party rule, and the restoration of civil rights. The rebellion occurred simultaneously with the 10th Party Congress, further destabilizing the fragile political situation.

Trotsky, as Commissar of War, was instrumental in ordering the suppression of the rebellion. On 18 March 1921, after several failed negotiations, the Red Army stormed the island, resulting in the deaths of thousands of Kronstadt sailors. Trotsky justified the action by presenting evidence that the rebellion had foreign backing, though this claim has been contested by several historians. Trotsky&#x27;s role has been the subject of criticism, with anarchists such as Emma Goldman accusing him of betraying the revolution&#x27;s democratic ideals.

=== Trotsky&#x27;s contribution to the Russian Revolution ===
Vladimir Cherniaev, a leading Russian historian, sums up Trotsky&#x27;s main contributions to the Russian Revolution:
Historian Geoffrey Swain argues that:
Lenin said in 1921 that Trotsky was &quot;in love with organisation,&quot; but in working politics, &quot;he has not got a clue.&quot; Swain explains the paradox by arguing that Trotsky was not good at teamwork; he was a loner who had mostly worked as a journalist, not as a professional revolutionary like the others.

=== Lenin&#x27;s illness (1922–1923) ===

In late 1921, Lenin&#x27;s health deteriorated and he was absent from Moscow for longer periods of time. He had three strokes between 25 May 1922 and 9 March 1923, which caused paralysis, loss of speech and finally death on 21 January 1924. With Lenin increasingly sidelined throughout 1922, Stalin was elevated to the newly created position of the Central Committee general secretary. Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev became part of the triumvirate (&quot;troika&quot;) formed by Stalin to ensure that Trotsky, publicly the number-two man in the country and Lenin&#x27;s heir presumptive, would not succeed Lenin.

The rest of the recently expanded Politburo (Rykov, Mikhail Tomsky, Bukharin) was at first uncommitted, but eventually joined the &quot;troika.&quot; Stalin&#x27;s power of patronage in his capacity as general secretary clearly played a role, but Trotsky and his supporters later concluded that a more fundamental reason was the process of slow bureaucratisation of the Soviet regime once the extreme conditions of the Civil War were over. Much of the Bolshevik elite wanted &#x27;normality,&#x27; while Trotsky was personally and politically personified as representing a turbulent revolutionary period that they would much rather leave behind.

Although the exact sequence of events is unclear, evidence suggests that at first the &quot;troika&quot; nominated Trotsky to head second-rate government departments (e.g., Gokhran, the State Depository for Valuables). In mid-July 1922, Kamenev wrote a letter to the recovering Lenin to the effect that &quot;(the Central Committee) is throwing or is ready to throw a good cannon overboard&quot;. Lenin was shocked and responded:

From then until his final stroke, Lenin spent much of his time trying to devise a way to prevent a split within the Communist Party leadership, which was reflected in &quot;Lenin&#x27;s Testament.&quot; As part of this effort, on 11 September 1922 Lenin proposed that Trotsky become his deputy at the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars (Sovnarkom). The Politburo approved the proposal, but Trotsky &quot;categorically refused&quot;. Lenin&#x27;s proposal has been interpreted by various scholars as evidence that he designated Trotsky as a successor as head of government.
In late 1922, Trotsky secured an alliance with Lenin against Stalin and the emerging Soviet bureaucracy. Stalin had recently engineered the creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), further centralising state control. The alliance proved effective on the issue of foreign trade but was hindered by Lenin&#x27;s progressing illness.

In January 1923, Lenin amended his Testament to suggest that Stalin should be removed as the party&#x27;s general secretary, while also mildly criticising Trotsky and other Bolshevik leaders. The relationship between Stalin and Lenin had broken down completely by this time, as was demonstrated during an event where Stalin crudely insulted Lenin&#x27;s wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya. In March 1923, days before his third stroke, Lenin asked Trotsky to denounce Stalin and his so-called &quot;Great-Russian nationalistic campaign&quot; at the XIIth Party Congress.

At the XIIth Party Congress in April 1923, however, just after Lenin&#x27;s final stroke, Trotsky did not raise the issue. Instead, he made a speech about intra-party democracy while avoiding any direct confrontation of the &quot;troika.&quot; Stalin had prepared for the congress by replacing many local party delegates with those loyal to him, mostly at the expense of Zinoviev and Kamenev&#x27;s backers.

The delegates, most of whom were unaware of the divisions within the Politburo, gave Trotsky a standing ovation. This upset the &quot;troika&quot;, already infuriated by Karl Radek&#x27;s article, &quot;Leon Trotsky – Organiser of Victory&quot; published in &quot;Pravda&quot; on 14 March 1923. Stalin delivered the key reports on organisational structure and questions of nationality; while Zinoviev delivered the Central Committee political report, traditionally Lenin&#x27;s prerogative. Among the resolutions adopted by the XIIth Congress were those calling for greater democracy within the Party, but these were vague and remained unimplemented.

The power struggle in the Soviet Union which emerged during Lenin&#x27;s illness and eventual death would also determine the prospect of world revolution. In particular, the leadership of the German Communist party had requested that Moscow send Trotsky to Germany to direct the 1923 insurrection. However, this proposal was rejected by the Politburo which was controlled by Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev who decided to send a commission of lower-ranking Russian Communist party members.

=== Left opposition (1923–1924) ===

Starting in mid-1923, the Soviet economy ran into significant difficulties, which led to numerous strikes countrywide. Two secret groups within the Communist Party, &quot;Workers&#x27; Truth&quot; and &quot;Workers&#x27; Group&quot;, were uncovered and suppressed by the Soviet secret police. On 8 October 1923 Trotsky sent a letter to the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission, attributing these difficulties to lack of intra-Party democracy. Trotsky wrote:

Other senior communists who had similar concerns sent &quot;The Declaration of 46&quot; to the Central Committee on 15 October, in which they wrote:

Although the text of these letters remained secret at the time, they had a significant effect on the Party leadership and prompted a partial retreat by the &quot;troika&quot; and its supporters on the issue of intra-Party democracy, notably in Zinoviev&#x27;s &quot;Pravda&quot; article published on 7 November. Throughout November, the &quot;troika&quot; tried to come up with a compromise to placate, or at least temporarily neutralise, Trotsky and his supporters. (Their task was made easier by the fact that Trotsky was sick in November and December.) The first draft of the resolution was rejected by Trotsky, which led to the formation of a special group consisting of Stalin, Trotsky and Kamenev, which was charged with drafting a mutually acceptable compromise. On 5 December, the Politburo and the Central Control Commission unanimously adopted the group&#x27;s final draft as its resolution. On 8 December, Trotsky published an open letter, in which he expounded on the recently adopted resolution&#x27;s ideas. The &quot;troika&quot; used his letter as an excuse to launch a campaign against Trotsky, accusing him of factionalism, setting &quot;the youth against the fundamental generation of old revolutionary Bolsheviks&quot; and other sins.

Trotsky defended his position in a series of seven letters which were collected as &quot;The New Course&quot; in January 1924. The illusion of a &quot;monolithic Bolshevik leadership&quot; was thus shattered and a lively intra-Party discussion ensued, both in local Party organizations and in the pages of &quot;Pravda&quot;. The discussion lasted most of December and January until the XIIIth Party Conference of 16–18 January 1924. Those who opposed the Central Committee&#x27;s position in the debate were thereafter referred to as members of the Left Opposition. In 1924, in a series of conferences at Sverdlov University; Stalin cited several times, in a critical way &#x27;the Permanentists&#x27;, as the followers of Trotsky &#x27;Permanent revolution&#x27;.

Since the &quot;troika&quot; controlled the Party apparatus through Stalin&#x27;s Secretariat and &quot;Pravda&quot; through its editor Bukharin, it was able to direct the discussion and the process of delegate selection. Although Trotsky&#x27;s position prevailed within the Red Army and Moscow universities and received about half the votes in the Moscow Party organisation, it was defeated elsewhere, and the Conference was packed with pro-&quot;troika&quot; delegates. In the end, only three delegates voted for Trotsky&#x27;s position, and the Conference denounced &quot;Trotskyism&quot; as a &quot;petty bourgeois deviation&quot;.

Members of the Left Opposition represented most of the international elements of the party and held offices at the highest responsibility with Christian Rakovsky, Adolph Joffe and Nikolay Krestinsky holding ambassadorial posts in London, Paris, Tokyo and Berlin.

Internationally, Trotsky&#x27;s opposition and criticism of the ruling troika received support from several, Central Committee members of foreign communist parties. This included Christian Rakovsky, Chairman of the Ukraine Sovnarkom, Boris Souvarine of the French Communist Party and the Central Committee of the Polish Communist Party which was led by prominent theoreticians such as Maksymilian Horwitz, Maria Koszutska and Adolf Warski.

=== After Lenin&#x27;s death (1924) ===

There was little overt political disagreement within the Soviet leadership throughout most of 1924. On the surface, Trotsky remained the most prominent and popular Bolshevik leader, although his &quot;mistakes&quot; were often alluded to by &quot;troika&quot; partisans. Behind the scenes, he was completely cut off from the decision-making process. Politburo meetings were pure formalities since all key decisions were made ahead of time by the &quot;troika&quot; and its supporters. Trotsky&#x27;s control over the military was undermined by reassigning his deputy, Ephraim Sklyansky, and appointing Mikhail Frunze, who was being groomed to take Trotsky&#x27;s place.

At the thirteenth Party Congress in May, Trotsky delivered a conciliatory speech:

In the meantime, the Left Opposition, which had coagulated somewhat unexpectedly in late 1923 and lacked a definite platform aside from general dissatisfaction with the intra-Party &quot;regime&quot;, began to crystallise. It lost some less dedicated members to the harassment by the &quot;troika&quot;, but it also began formulating a program.

Economically, the Left Opposition opposed the development of capitalist elements in the Soviet economy and advocated for accelerated industrialization through state-led policies.&quot; That put them at odds with Bukharin and Rykov, the &quot;Right&quot; within the Party, who supported the &quot;troika&quot;. On the question of world revolution, Trotsky and Karl Radek saw a period of stability in Europe, while Stalin and Zinoviev confidently predicted an &quot;acceleration&quot; of revolution in Western Europe in 1924. On the theoretical plane, Trotsky remained committed to the Bolshevik idea that the Soviet Union could not create a true socialist society in the absence of the world revolution, while Stalin gradually came up with a policy of building &quot;socialism in one country&quot;. These ideological divisions provided much of the intellectual basis for the political divide between Trotsky and the Left Opposition on the one hand, and Stalin and his allies on the other.

At the thirteenth Congress Kamenev and Zinoviev helped Stalin defuse Lenin&#x27;s Testament, which belatedly came to the surface. But just after the congress, the &quot;troika&quot;, always an alliance of convenience, showed signs of weakness. Stalin began making poorly veiled accusations about Zinoviev and Kamenev. Yet in October 1924, Trotsky published &quot;Lessons of October,&quot; a summary of the events of the 1917 revolution. He described Zinoviev and Kamenev&#x27;s opposition to the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917, something they would have preferred left unmentioned. This started a new round of intra-party struggle, which became known as the &quot;Literary Discussion&quot;, with Zinoviev and Kamenev again allied with Stalin against Trotsky. Their criticism of Trotsky was concentrated in three areas:
* Trotsky&#x27;s disagreements and conflicts with Lenin and the Bolsheviks prior to 1917.
* Trotsky&#x27;s alleged distortion of the events of 1917 to emphasise his role and diminish the roles played by other Bolsheviks.
* Trotsky&#x27;s harsh treatment of his subordinates and other alleged mistakes during the Civil War.

Trotsky was again sick and unable to respond while his opponents mobilised all their resources to denounce him. They succeeded in damaging his military reputation so much that he was forced to resign as People&#x27;s Commissar of Army and Fleet Affairs and Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council on 6 January 1925. Zinoviev demanded Trotsky&#x27;s expulsion from the Communist Party, but Stalin refused to go along and played the role of a moderate. Trotsky kept his Politburo seat, but was effectively put on probation.

=== A year in the wilderness (1925) ===
For Trotsky, 1925 was a difficult year. After the bruising &quot;Literary Discussion&quot; and losing his Red Army posts, he was effectively unemployed throughout the winter and spring. In May 1925, he was given three posts: chairman of the Concessions Committee, head of the electro-technical board, and chairman of the scientific-technical board of industry. Trotsky wrote in &quot;My Life&quot; that he &quot;was taking a rest from politics&quot; and &quot;naturally plunged into the new line of work up to my ears&quot;. Trotsky would also deliver a tribute to Lenin in his 1925 short book, &quot;Lenin&quot;.

Some contemporary accounts paint a picture of a remote and distracted man. Later in the year, Trotsky resigned his two technical positions (maintaining Stalin-instigated interference and sabotage) and concentrated on his work in the Concessions Committee.

In one of the few political developments that affected Trotsky in 1925, the circumstances of the controversy over Lenin&#x27;s Testament were described by American Marxist Max Eastman in his book &quot;Since Lenin Died&quot; (1925). Trotsky denied these statements made by Eastman in an article he wrote.

In the meantime, the &quot;troika&quot; finally broke up. Bukharin and Rykov sided with Stalin while Krupskaya and Soviet Commissar of Finance Grigory Sokolnikov aligned with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The struggle became open at the September 1925 meeting of the Central Committee and came to a head at the XIV Party Congress in December 1925. With only the Leningrad Party organization behind them, Zinoviev and Kamenev, dubbed &quot;The New Opposition&quot;, were thoroughly defeated, while Trotsky refused to get involved in the fight and did not speak at the Congress.
=== United Opposition (1926–1927) ===
In early 1926, Zinoviev, Kamenev and their supporters in the &quot;New Opposition&quot; gravitated closer to Trotsky&#x27;s supporters, and the two groups soon formed an alliance, which also incorporated some smaller opposition groups within the Communist Party. The alliance became known as the United Opposition.

The United Opposition was repeatedly threatened with sanctions by the Stalinist leadership of the Communist Party, and Trotsky had to agree to tactical retreats, mostly to preserve his alliance with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The opposition remained united against Stalin throughout 1926 and 1927, especially on the issue of the Chinese Revolution. The methods used by the Stalinists against the Opposition became more and more extreme. At the XV Party Conference in October 1926, Trotsky could barely speak because of interruptions and catcalls, and at the end of the Conference he lost his Politburo seat. In 1927, Stalin started using the GPU (Soviet secret police) to infiltrate and discredit the opposition. Rank-and-file oppositionists were increasingly harassed, sometimes expelled from the Party and even arrested.

Soviet policy toward the Chinese Revolution became the ideological line of demarcation between Stalin and the United Opposition. The Chinese Revolution began on 10 October 1911, resulting in the abdication of the Chinese Emperor, Puyi, on 12 February 1912. Sun Yat-sen established the Republic of China. In reality, however, the Republic controlled very little of the country. Much of China was divided between various regional warlords. The Republican government established a new &quot;nationalist people&#x27;s army and a national people&#x27;s party&quot;—the Kuomintang. In 1920, the Kuomintang opened relations with Soviet Russia. With Soviet help, the Republic of China built up the nationalist people&#x27;s army. With the development of the nationalist army, a Northern Expedition was planned to smash the power of the warlords of the northern part of the country. This Northern Expedition became a point of contention over foreign policy by Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin tried to persuade the small Chinese Communist Party to merge with the Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalists to bring about a bourgeois revolution before attempting to bring about a Soviet-style working class revolution.

Trotsky wanted the Communist Party to complete an orthodox proletarian revolution and have clear class independence from the KMT. Stalin funded the KMT during the expedition. Stalin countered Trotskyist criticism by making a secret speech in which he said that Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s right-wing Kuomintang were the only ones capable of defeating the imperialists, that Chiang had funding from the rich merchants, and that his forces were to be utilized until squeezed for all usefulness like a lemon before being discarded. However, Chiang quickly reversed the tables in the Shanghai massacre of 12 April 1927 by massacring the Communist Party in Shanghai midway through the Northern Expedition.

=== Defeat and exile (1927–1928) ===

On the tenth anniversary of the October Revolution, the Opposition held a street demonstration in Moscow against Stalin&#x27;s Government, that was dispersed by the sovietic authorities and Trotsky was expelled from the Communist Party shortly after. Trotsky gave the eulogy at the funeral of his friend, the Soviet diplomat Adolph Joffe, in November 1927. It would be the last speech that Trotsky would give in the Soviet Union. When the XV Party Congress made United Opposition views incompatible with membership in the Communist Party, Zinoviev, Kamenev, and their supporters capitulated and renounced their alliance with the Left Opposition. Trotsky and most of his followers, on the other hand, refused to surrender and stayed the course. Trotsky was exiled to Alma Ata, Kazakhstan on 31 January 1928. He was expelled from the Soviet Union to Turkey in February 1929, accompanied by his wife Natalia Sedova and their eldest son, Lev.

=== Fate of Left Oppositionists after Trotsky&#x27;s exile (1929–1941) ===
After Trotsky&#x27;s expulsion from the Soviet Union, Trotskyists within the Soviet Union began to waver. Between 1929 and 1932, most leading members of the Left Opposition surrendered to Stalin, &quot;admitted their mistakes&quot; and were reinstated in the Communist Party. One initial exception to this was Christian Rakovsky, who inspired Trotsky between 1929 and 1934 with his refusal to capitulate as state suppression of any remaining opposition to Stalin increased by the year. In late 1932, Rakovsky had failed with an attempt to flee the Soviet Union and was exiled to Yakutia in March 1933. Answering Trotsky&#x27;s request, the French mathematician and Trotskyist Jean Van Heijenoort, together with his fellow activist Pierre Frank, unsuccessfully called on the influential Soviet author Maxim Gorky to intervene in favor of Christian Rakovsky, and boarded the ship he was traveling on near Constantinople. According to Heijenoort, they only managed to meet Gorky&#x27;s son, Maxim Peshkov, who reportedly told them that his father was indisposed, but promised to pass on their request. Rakovsky was the last prominent Trotskyist to capitulate to Stalin in April 1934, when Rakovsky formally &quot;admitted his mistakes&quot; (his letter to &quot;Pravda&quot;, titled &quot;There Should Be No Mercy&quot;, depicted Trotsky and his supporters as &quot;agents of the German Gestapo&quot;). Rakovsky was appointed to high office in the Commissariat for Health and allowed to return to Moscow, also serving as Soviet ambassador to Japan in 1935. However, Rakovsky was cited in allegations involving the killing of Sergey Kirov, and was arrested and imprisoned in late 1937, during the Great Purge.

Almost all Trotskyists who were still within the Soviet Union&#x27;s borders were executed in the Great Purges of 1936–1938, although Rakovsky survived until the Medvedev Forest massacre of September 1941, where he was shot dead along with 156 other prisoners on Stalin&#x27;s orders, less than three months into the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union. Also among the Medvedev Forest victims was Trotsky&#x27;s sister/Kamenev&#x27;s first wife, Olga Kameneva.

== Exile (1929–1940) ==

===Turkey===
After being deported from the Soviet Union, in February 1929, Trotsky arrived in Turkey. During his first two months in Turkey, Trotsky lived with his wife and eldest son at the Soviet Union Consulate in Istanbul and then at a nearby hotel in the city. In April 1929, Trotsky, his wife and son were moved to the island of Büyükada (also known by its Greek name of Prinkipo) by the Turkish authorities. On Büyükada, they were moved into a house called the Yanaros mansion. During his exile in Turkey, Trotsky was under the surveillance of the Turkish police forces of Mustafa Kemal Pasha. Trotsky was also at risk from the many former White Army officers who lived on Prinkipo, officers who had opposed the October Revolution and who had been defeated by Trotsky and the Red Army in the Russian Civil War. However, Trotsky&#x27;s European supporters volunteered to serve as bodyguards and assured his safety. At this time, he made requests to enter Belgium, France, Norway, Germany, and the United Kingdom, but all refused access.

Soon after arriving in Turkey Trotsky established the publication &quot;Bulletin of the Opposition&quot;. A Russian language journal, it was first published in July 1929 in Paris. In 1931, Trotsky wrote a letter to a friend entitled &quot;What is Fascism&quot; in which he attempted to define fascism and asserted that the Communist International was wrong to describe the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera as &quot;fascist&quot; because it was not a mass movement arising from a base in the lower classes.

On 20 February 1932, Trotsky and all of his family lost their Soviet citizenship and were forbidden to enter the Soviet Union. In 1932, Trotsky entered via a port into the fascist Kingdom of Italy on his way to a socialist conference in Denmark. By the end of 1932, Trotsky had made contact with the anti-Stalin opposition inside the USSR and discussed the possibility of forming a bloc. There was no evidence of any alliance with Nazi Germany or Japan, as the Soviet Union government claimed. The alleged members of the anti-Stalin bloc were Zinovievites, rightists and Trotskyists who &quot;capitulated&quot; to Stalin. Kamenev and Zinoviev were also alleged members of the bloc. Trotsky wanted by no means that the alliance became a fusion, and he was afraid of the right gaining much power inside the bloc. Historian Pierre Broué concluded that the bloc dissolved in early 1933, since some of its members like Zinoviev and Kamenev joined Stalin again, and because there were no letters in the Trotsky Harvard archive mentioning the bloc after 1932.

===France===

In July 1933, Trotsky was offered asylum in France by Prime Minister Édouard Daladier. Trotsky accepted the offer, but he was forbidden to live in Paris and soon found himself under the surveillance of the French police. From July 1933 to February 1934, Trotsky and his wife lived in Royan. The philosopher and activist Simone Weil also arranged for Trotsky and his bodyguards to stay for a few days at her parents&#x27; house. Following the 6 February 1934 crisis in France, the French minister of internal affairs, Albert Sarraut, signed a decree to deport Trotsky from France. However, no foreign government was found willing to accept Trotsky within its borders. Accordingly, the French authorities instructed Trotsky to move to a residence in the tiny village of Barbizon under the strict surveillance of the French police, where Trotsky found his contact with the outside world to be even worse than during his exile in Turkey.

In May 1935, soon after the French government had agreed to the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance with the Soviet Union government, Trotsky was officially told that he was no longer welcome in France. After weighing his options, Trotsky applied to move to Norway.

===Norway===

After obtaining permission from Justice Minister Trygve Lie to enter the country, Trotsky and his wife became a guest of Konrad Knudsen at Norderhov, near Hønefoss, and spent over a year living at Knudsen&#x27;s house, from 18 June 1935 to 2 September 1936. Trotsky was hospitalized for a few weeks at the nearby Oslo Community Hospital, from 19 September 1935.

Following French media complaints about Trotsky&#x27;s role in encouraging the mass strikes in France in May and June 1936 with his articles, the Johan Nygaardsvold-led Norwegian government began to exhibit disquiet about Trotsky&#x27;s actions. In the summer of 1936, Trotsky&#x27;s asylum was increasingly made a political issue by the fascist Nasjonal Samling, led by Vidkun Quisling, along with an increase in pressure from the Soviet government on the Norwegian authorities. On 5 August 1936, Knudsen&#x27;s house was burgled by fascists from the Nasjonal Samling while Trotsky and his wife were out on a seashore trip with Knudsen and his wife. The burglars targeted Trotsky&#x27;s works and archives for vandalism. The raid was largely thwarted by Knudsen&#x27;s daughter, Hjørdis, although the burglars did take a few papers from the nearest table as they left. Although the perpetrators were caught and put on trial, the &quot;evidence&quot; obtained in the burglary was used by the government to make claims against Trotsky. 

On 14 August 1936, the Soviet Press Agency TASS announced the discovery of a &quot;Trotskyist–Zinovievist&quot; plot and the imminent start of the Moscow trials of the accused. Trotsky demanded a complete and open enquiry into Moscow&#x27;s accusations. The accused were sentenced to death, including Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev, and executed on 25 August 1936. On 26 August 1936, eight policemen arrived at Knudsen&#x27;s house demanding that Trotsky sign new conditions for residing in Norway. These conditions included agreeing to write no more about current political matters, to give no interviews, and to have all his correspondence (incoming and outgoing) inspected by the police. Trotsky categorically refused the conditions, and Trotsky was then told that he and his wife would soon be moved to another residence. The following day Trotsky was interrogated by the police about his political activities, with the police officially citing Trotsky as a &quot;witness&quot; to the fascist raid of 5 August 1936.

On 2 September 1936, four weeks after the break-in at Knudsen&#x27;s house, Trygve Lie ordered that Trotsky and his wife be transferred to a farm in Hurum, where they were under house arrest. The treatment of Trotsky and his wife at Hurum was harsh, as they were forced to stay indoors for 22 hours per day under the constant guard of thirteen policemen, with only one hour permitted twice a day for a walk on the farm. Trotsky was prevented from posting any letters and prevented from arguing back against his critics in Norway and beyond. Only Trotsky&#x27;s lawyers and the Norwegian Labour Party Parliamentary leader, Olav Scheflo, were permitted to visit. From October 1936, even the outdoor walks were prohibited for Trotsky and his wife. Trotsky did eventually manage to smuggle out one letter on 18 December 1936, titled &quot;The Moscow &quot;Confessions&quot;&quot;. On 19 December 1936, Trotsky and his wife were deported from Norway after being put on the Norwegian oil tanker &quot;Ruth&quot;, under guard by Jonas Lie. When later living in Mexico, Trotsky was utterly scathing about the treatment he received during his 108 days at Hurum, and accused the Norwegian government of trying to prevent him from publicly voicing his strong opposition to the Moscow Trials and other show trials, saying:

===Mexico===


The &quot;Ruth&quot; arrived in Mexico on 9 January 1937. On Trotsky&#x27;s arrival, the Mexican president, Lázaro Cárdenas, welcomed Trotsky to Mexico and arranged for his special train &quot;The Hidalgo&quot; to bring Trotsky to Mexico City from the port of Tampico.

From January 1937 to April 1939, Trotsky and his wife lived in the Coyoacán area of Mexico City at La Casa Azul (The Blue House), the home of the painter Frida Kahlo, with whom Trotsky had an affair, and Kahlo&#x27;s husband and fellow painter, Diego Rivera. She later presented him with &quot;Self-Portrait Dedicated to Leon Trotsky&quot; on his birthday, the 20th anniversary of the October Revolution. His final move was a few blocks away to a residence on Avenida Viena in April 1939, following a break with Rivera.
Trotsky wrote prolifically while in exile, penning several key works, including his &quot;History of the Russian Revolution&quot; (1930) and &quot;The Revolution Betrayed&quot; (1936), a critique of the Soviet Union under Stalinism. He argued that the Soviet state had become a &quot;degenerated workers&#x27; state&quot; controlled by an undemocratic bureaucracy, which would eventually either be overthrown via a political revolution establishing a workers&#x27; democracy, or degenerate into a capitalist class.

While in Mexico, Trotsky also worked closely with James Cannon, Joseph Hansen, and Farrell Dobbs of the Socialist Workers Party of the United States, and other supporters. Cannon, a long-time leading member of the American communist movement, had supported Trotsky in the struggle against Stalinism since he had first read Trotsky&#x27;s criticisms of the Soviet Union in 1928. Trotsky&#x27;s critique of the Stalinist regime, though banned, was distributed to leaders of the Comintern. Among his other supporters was Chen Duxiu, founder of the Chinese Communist Party.

While in Mexico, Trotsky worked with André Breton and Diego Rivera to write the Manifesto for an Independent Revolutionary Art, published in 1938, which emphasized the need for artistic freedom outside the constraints of capitalist and Stalinist regimes. This collaboration inspired the creation of the International Federation of Independent Revolutionary Art (FIARI) in 1938. However, this organization was short-lived and ended before 1940.

=== Moscow show trials ===
In August 1936, the first Moscow show trial of the so-called &quot;Trotskyite–Zinovievite Terrorist Center&quot; was staged in front of an international audience. During the trial, Zinoviev, Kamenev and 14 other accused, most of them prominent Old Bolsheviks, confessed to having plotted with Trotsky to kill Stalin and other members of the Soviet leadership. The court found every defendant guilty,
in absentia, including Trotsky, sentencing them to death. The second show trial of Karl Radek, Grigori Sokolnikov, Yuri Pyatakov, and 14 others, took place in January 1937, during which more alleged conspiracies and crimes were linked to Trotsky. The findings were published in the book &quot;Not Guilty&quot;.

=== Fourth International ===
For fear of splitting the communist movement, Trotsky initially opposed the idea of establishing parallel communist parties or a parallel international communist organization that would compete with the Third International. In mid-1933, after the Nazi takeover in Germany and the Comintern&#x27;s response to it, he changed his mind. He said:

In 1938, Trotsky and his supporters founded the Fourth International, which was intended to be a revolutionary and internationalist alternative to the Stalinist Comintern.

=== The Dies Committee ===

Towards the end of 1939, Trotsky agreed to go to the United States to appear as a witness before the Dies Committee of the House of Representatives, a forerunner of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Representative Martin Dies Jr., chairman of the committee, demanded the suppression of the American Communist Party. Trotsky intended to use the forum to expose the NKVD&#x27;s activities against him and his followers.

He made it clear that he also intended to argue against the suppression of the American Communist Party and to use the committee as a platform for a call to transform World War II into a world revolution. Many of his supporters argued against his appearance. When the committee learned the nature of the testimony Trotsky intended to present, it refused to hear him, and he was denied a visa to enter the United States. On hearing about it, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union immediately accused Trotsky of being in the pay of the oil magnates and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

=== Final months ===
After quarreling with Diego Rivera, Trotsky moved to his final residence on Avenida Viena in April 1939. On 27 February 1940, Trotsky wrote a document known as &quot;Trotsky&#x27;s Testament&quot;, in which he expressed his final thoughts and feelings for posterity. He was suffering from high blood pressure, and feared that he would suffer a cerebral haemorrhage. He would also reiterate his &quot;unshaken faith in a communist future&quot;. After forcefully denying Stalin&#x27;s accusations that he had betrayed the working class, he thanked his friends and above all his wife, Natalia Sedova, for their loyal support:

== Assassination ==
After a failed attempt to have Trotsky murdered in March 1939, Stalin assigned the overall organization of implementing the task to the NKVD officer Pavel Sudoplatov, who, in turn, co-opted Nahum Eitingon. According to Sudoplatov&#x27;s &quot;Special Tasks&quot;, the NKVD proceeded to set up three NKVD agent networks to carry out the murder; these three networks were designed to operate entirely autonomously from the NKVD&#x27;s hitherto-established spy networks in the U.S. and Mexico.

On 24 May 1940, Trotsky survived a raid on his villa by armed assassins led by the NKVD agent Iosif Grigulevich and Mexican painter David Alfaro Siqueiros. Trotsky&#x27;s 14-year-old grandson, Vsevolod Platonovich &quot;Esteban&quot; Volkov (7 March 1926 – 16 June 2023), was shot in the foot. A young assistant and bodyguard of Trotsky, Robert Sheldon Harte, disappeared with the attackers and was later found murdered; it is probable that he was an accomplice who granted them access to the villa. Trotsky&#x27;s other guards fended off the attackers. Following the failed assassination attempt, Trotsky wrote an article titled &quot;Stalin Seeks My Death&quot; on 8 June 1940, in which he stated that another assassination attempt was certain.

On 20 August 1940, Trotsky was attacked in his study by Spanish-born NKVD agent Ramón Mercader, who used an ice axe as a weapon. The operation was known within the NKVD as &quot;Operation Utka&quot; (Operation Duck).

A mountaineering ice axe has a narrow end, called the pick, and a flat wide end called the adze. The adze of the axe wounded Trotsky, fracturing his parietal bone and penetrating into his brain. The blow to his head was bungled and failed to kill Trotsky instantly. Witnesses stated that Trotsky spat on Mercader and began struggling fiercely with him, which resulted in Mercader&#x27;s hand being broken. Hearing the commotion, Trotsky&#x27;s bodyguards burst into the room and nearly beat Mercader to death, but Trotsky stopped them, laboriously stating that the assassin should be made to answer questions. Trotsky was then taken to a hospital and operated on, surviving for more than a day, yet ultimately dying at the age of 60 on 21 August 1940 from blood loss and shock. Mercader later testified at his trial:

According to James Cannon, the Trotskyist secretary of the American Socialist Workers Party, Trotsky&#x27;s last words were &quot;I will not survive this attack. Stalin has finally accomplished the task he attempted unsuccessfully before.&quot; Mercader was tried and convicted of the murder and spent the next 20 years in a Mexican prison. Stalin wrote that the assassin of Trotsky was a dangerous Trotskyist. This is why Mercader had no awards initially, though his mother was presented with the Order of Lenin for her own part of the operation. Ramón Mercader could not be either assassinated or freed from prison by the Soviets. When he was released from jail in 1960 and arrived in the USSR in 1961, Leonid Brezhnev signed a sentence to award Mercader the Order of Lenin, the Gold Star, and the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union &quot;for the special deed&quot;. The KGB boss Alexander Shelepin presented all these awards to Ramón Mercader in person.

In the aftermath of Trotsky&#x27;s assassination, an estimated 300,000 people had passed by his funeral casket in Mexico City over several days by 27 August 1940.

== Personality and characteristics==
Trotsky was regarded as an outstanding orator, preeminent 
theoretician, and organiser that, in the view of historian Michael Kort, &quot;forged and directed the Red Army&quot;. He served as one of the original Politburo members in Lenin&#x27;s government. Biographer Isaac Deutscher considered him to be the &quot;prompter of [the] planned economy and industrialization&quot; during the early years of the Soviet Union.

Old Bolshevik Anatoly Lunacharsky viewed Trotsky as the best prepared among the Social Democratic leaders during the 1905–1907 revolution and stated that he &quot;emerged from the revolution having acquired an enormous degree of popularity, whereas neither Lenin nor Martov had effectively gained any at all&quot;. His personal secretary and later a historian of mathematical logic, Jean van Heijenoort, considered him to be amicable, inquisitive and occasionally charming with new acquaintances during his final years in Mexico.

Historian Dmitri Volkogonov characterised him as a &quot;vivid, complex, multi-faceted personality in the gallery of world figures&quot; who was remembered &quot;with hatred and respect, anger and admiration&quot; decades after his assassination in Mexico. Volkogonov considered Trotsky &quot;far superior&quot; to figures such as Molotov, Kaganovich, Khrushchev, Zhdanov and &quot;also superior to Stalin and Stalin knew it&quot;.

Biographer Robert Service commented that he was a &quot;volatile and untrustworthy&quot;, &quot;arrogant individual&quot; that impressed supporters even during the periods of &quot;personal adversity in the 1920s and 1930s&quot; but failed to &quot;coax and encourage them to the full&quot;. Service stated that Trotsky gave the &quot;minimum time to the Jewish question&quot; and believed that &quot;he ceased to be a Jew in any important sense because Marxism had burned out the fortuitous residues of his origins&quot;.

Political scientist August Nimtz regarded Trotsky to have had better foresight than both Marxist and some non-Marxist intellectual observers with his work &quot;The Revolution Betrayed: What Is the Soviet Union and Where Is It Going?&quot; (1936). Trotsky argued that the Stalinist regime was an &quot;ephemeral phenomenon&quot; and Nimtz believed this had later been proven with the Soviet collapse after 1989. Other scholars have similarly described Trotsky as having a prescient judgement of events such as the Stalinist alliance with the Kuomintang, the rise of Nazi Germany and The Spanish Civil War through his political writings and levels of military accuracy. Deutscher also referenced his &quot;uncanny clear sightedness&quot; in predicting the emergence of a single dictator who would &quot;substitute himself&quot; for the Central Committee, the party and the working class.

Trotsky was a Marxist intellectual. Russian historian Vladimir Buldakov considered Trotsky, in some respect, a &quot;typical representative&quot; of &quot;Russia&#x27;s radical intelligentsia&quot; who had &quot;elements of bourgeois origin&quot;. He had a diverse and profound range of interests which exceeded that of other Bolshevik theoreticians such as Nikolai Bukharin.

Aside from his interest in political activism, Trotsky also worked as a statistician and a journalist. 
He also had a notable interest in literature and wrote on &quot;everyday life and cultural progress as well as on the more customary Marxism of the day&quot;. Trotsky and his second wife, Natalia Sedova enjoyed Viennese galleries and made frequent visits to museums such as the Louvre and the Tate Gallery across Europe to view specific art collections. He also retained a personal interest in science which stemmed from his youth when he considered studying mathematics and physics at the New Russian University in Odessa.

His arch enemy, Stalin, even read and sometimes appreciated a great deal of his writings. According to Rubenstein, Stalin had even acknowledged that &quot;after Lenin, Trotsky was the most popular figure in the country&quot; at the end of the Civil War. He also recognized the prominent role of Trotsky during the October revolution in the 1917 Pravda editorial. Stalin himself wrote: &quot;All practical work in connection with the organization of the uprising was done under the immediate direction of Comrade Trotsky, the president of the Petrograd Soviet&quot;.

Upon his exile in 1929, eighteen of his close relatives remained in the Soviet Union and all were subjected to repressive measures with seven of his family members including his son Sergei Sedov, sister Olga Kameneva and brother Aleksandr Bronstein having been shot. He spoke several European languages &quot;with a markedly Russian accent&quot; and identified as a cosmopolitan and internationalist. In the course of his life, Trotsky wrote about 30,000 documents, most of which are contained in various archives. Deutscher stated that Trotsky wrote most of the Soviet&#x27;s manifestos and resolutions, edited its Izvestia newspaper and also composed the oath of loyalty for the Red Army.

== Political stature and conflicts with Stalin==


Trotsky lacked the political acumen to succeed against Stalin&#x27;s machinations. Lenin had encouraged Trotsky, in his absence, to challenge Stalin at the Twelfth Party Congress over the Georgian Affair but the latter relented. Historian Martin McCauley commented that Trotsky &quot;displayed a lamentable lack of political judgement&quot; on multiple occasions such as declining Lenin&#x27;s proposal to become deputy chairman of Sovnarkom, failing to build a power base before forming a bloc with Lenin against the Orgburo and not immediately recognising that a triumvirate had been established to prevent his succession. Biographer Joshua Rubenstein differed in his interpretation and attributed Trotsky&#x27;s decision to decline Lenin&#x27;s proposal because he believed the position had &quot;little authority of its own&quot; and overlapped with other government and party officials. Deutscher believed he had underestimated Stalin&#x27;s cunning, ruthlessness, and tenacity on several occasions.

His enmity with Stalin developed during the Civil War with the latter&#x27;s disregard of military specialists whom Trotsky considered indispensable for the success of the Red Army. In Tsaritsyn, Stalin ordered the imprisonment of several specialists on a barge in the Volga river and oversaw the sinking of the floating prison in which the officers perished. Another instance was when Stalin disobeyed Trotsky&#x27;s order to march on Warsaw which contributed to the defeat of the Red Army at the Battle of Warsaw in 1920. Bazhanov also claimed that Stalin&#x27;s antagonism towards Trotsky stemmed from the fact that he was Jewish and that the former would refuse to obey military orders during the Russian Civil War. According to Rogovin, Trotsky received hundreds of letters reporting the use of anti-semitic methods during the inter-party struggle between Stalin and the United Opposition.

Rubenstein regarded Trotsky&#x27;s position among the Soviet elites as largely dependent on Lenin. Rubenstein also added that he had an image of an outsider within party circles as he had previously been an &quot;outspoken critic of Lenin&quot;. Conversely, Volkongov stated that Trotsky had the support of many party intellectuals but this was overshadowed by the huge apparatus which included the GPU and the party cadres who were at the disposal of Stalin.

Trotsky himself ascribed his political defeat to external, objective conditions rather than the individual qualities of Stalin. He specifically argued that the failed series of international insurrections as seen in Bulgaria in 1923 and China in 1927 had diminished the prospect of world socialism and demoralised the Russian working class which in turn strengthened the growth of an internal, Soviet bureaucracy. Russian historian Vadim Rogovin also remarked that Trotsky, in the 1930s, did not abandon hope for the spread of the revolution. Rogovin argued that Trotsky&#x27;s prognosis of world events was plausible as a majority of European countries such as Germany, France, and especially Spain, &quot;went through a period of revolutionary crisis&quot;. Although, Daniels contended that Trotsky would have in reality been no more prepared than other Bolshevik figures to risk war or the loss of trade opportunities despite his support for world revolution.

== Relations with Lenin ==

His relations with Lenin have been a source of intense historical debate. Historian Paul Le Blanc and philosopher Michael Lowy described Lenin and Trotsky as the &quot;widely leading figures in the Russia&#x27;s Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 as well as in the final years of the rising world communist movement&quot;.

However, Swain viewed the notion that Trotsky was Lenin&#x27;s natural heir a myth and cited several scholars such as Erik Van Rees, James White and Richard B.Day who Swain claimed had challenged the traditional characterization of their relationship.

Le Blanc has disputed Swain&#x27;s representation of Trotsky and referenced various historians which included E.H. Carr, Isaac Deutscher, Moshe Lewin, Ronald Suny and W. Bruce Lincoln across different generations. According to Le Blanc, these historians on balance had tilted &quot;toward the view that Lenin&#x27;s desired &quot;heir&quot; was collective responsibility in which Trotsky placed an important role and within which Stalin would be dramatically demoted (if not removed)&quot;.

Historian Roy Medvedev noted the close association of Trotsky and Lenin in the Soviet republic throughout the period of 1921–24. Medvedev mentioned a number of public commendations such as &quot;greetings in honour of comrades Lenin and Trotsky were announced at many rallies and meetings, and portraits of Lenin and Trotsky hung on the walls of many Soviet and party institutions&quot;.

===Lenin&#x27;s succession===

Trotsky was generally viewed as Lenin&#x27;s choice as a successor in 1923. He had been nominated to be Lenin&#x27;s deputy in 1922 and 1923 as well as expected to assume responsibility over the Council of National Economy or Gosplan. Lenin and Trotsky were also the only Soviet leaders elected honorary presidents of the Communist International. Prior to the introduction of the factional ban in 1921, due to intra-party controversies and the wider conflict of the Civil War, Trotsky had a considerable following among the party activists and members of the Central Committee against the narrow majority supporting Lenin. His supporters also controlled the newly established Orgburo and the Party Secretariat before the appointment of Stalin as General Secretary. According to Mccauley, Lenin had revealed that he planned to retire to the Central Committee and made an arrangement for Trotsky to speak on his behalf as his natural successor which in turn triggered the formation of the troika. Historian Orlando Figes has drawn focus to the increasing alignment between Lenin and Trotsky in 1923. He cited Lenin&#x27;s testament which was critical of Stalin and the bureaucracy along with their shared position on foreign trade, party reform and the Georgian affair.

Similarly, Soviet historian Victor Danilov believed that Lenin&#x27;s proposed appointment of Trotsky as deputy &quot;would have made him in effect Lenin&#x27;s successor&quot;. Danilov also cited Politburo Secretary Bazhanov&#x27;s notes of a concluding speech delivered by Trotsky in 1923 to the wider party membership. Trotsky explained his decision to decline the proposed position of Lenin&#x27;s chief deputy due to concerns about his &quot;Jewish origins&quot; which could accentuate anti-semitic attitudes towards the Soviet Union. Mccauley stated that Trotsky would &quot;almost certainly&quot; have become the successor had Lenin succumbed to his first stroke in 1922. Deutscher noted that Zinoviev had been Lenin&#x27;s closest discipline rather than Trotsky between 1907 and 1917. However, Zinoviev&#x27;s opposition to the October revolution had strained his relations with Lenin.

Opponents such as Winston Churchill even argued that &quot;Lenin [had] indeed regarded Trotsky as his political heir&quot; and sought to protect him before his passing in 1924. In his autobiography, &quot;My Life&quot;, Trotsky maintained that Lenin had intended for him to be his successor as Chairman of the Soviet Union with his proposed appointment as deputy. He explained that this process would have begun after their alliance in 1923 with the formation of a commission to mitigate the growth of the state bureaucracy which in turn would have facilitated the conditions for his succession in the party.

== Legacy==

In 1923, the historic town of Gatchina in Petrograd Governorate (now Leningrad Oblast) was renamed Trotsk () by the Soviet authorities after Lev Trotsky. After Joseph Stalin became General Secretary of the Russian Communist Party (b), Trotsky was gradually exiled, and the town was renamed Krasnogvardeysk (, &quot;Red Guard City&quot;) in 1929. In 1944, to increase the morale of Russian troops, the town&#x27;s historic name was restored.

Trotsky&#x27;s house in Coyoacán has been preserved in much the same condition as it was on the day he was assassinated there, and is now the Leon Trotsky House Museum in Mexico City, run by a board which included his grandson Esteban Volkov (1926–2023). Trotsky&#x27;s grave is located on its grounds. The foundation &quot;International Friends of the Leon Trotsky Museum&quot; has been organized to raise funds to improve the museum further.

Shortly before his assassination, Trotsky agreed to sell the bulk of the papers he still had to Harvard University. After his assassination, his widow, Natalya Sedova collected his remaining papers and shipped them to Harvard, and in the years following, Harvard managed to collect additional papers that had been hidden from both Soviet and Nazi agents in Europe. These papers now occupy of shelf space in Harvard&#x27;s Houghton Library.

Trotsky was never rehabilitated during the rule of the Soviet government, despite the de-Stalinization-era rehabilitation of most other Old Bolsheviks killed during the Great Purges. His son, Sergei Sedov, who died in 1937, was rehabilitated in 1988, as was Nikolai Bukharin. Beginning in 1989, Trotsky&#x27;s books, forbidden until 1987, were published in the Soviet Union.

Trotsky was rehabilitated on 16 June 2001 by the General Prosecutor&#x27;s Office of the Russian Federation (Certificates of Rehabilitation No. 13/2182-90, No. 13-2200-99 in Archives Research Center &quot;Memorial&quot;).

Historian Harold Shukman assessed the conflicting perspectives on Trotsky&#x27;s legacy in the Soviet Union and the Western world. He also commented on the lack of a balanced view. Specifically, he stated:

Trotsky&#x27;s legacy, unlike those of Stalin and Lenin, had long been submerged and obliterated as a topic of debate, and his place in Soviet history books had correspondingly diminished to one of no importance. For Western readers, however, Trotsky has always been one of the most enigmatic and powerful personalities of the Russian revolution, a Mephistophelian figure whose life ended in an appropriately dramatic way.

Political theorist David North attributed his diminished influence and historical role to the &quot;virtually unlimited resources of the Soviet regime, and of Stalinist-run parties throughout the world, [which] were devoted to blackguarding Trotsky as an anti-Soviet saboteur, terrorist and fascist agent. Within the Soviet Union, his political co-thinkers, past and present, were ruthlessly exterminated&quot;. North was also critical of the biographical literature on Trotsky&#x27;s legacy written by some historians such as Ian Thatcher, Geoffrey Swain and Robert Service. He viewed these recent trends in historiography as &quot;manifestations of the confluence of neo-Stalinist falsification and traditional Anglo-American anti-Communism&quot;.

In 2018, John Kelly wrote that &quot;almost 80 years after Leon Trotsky founded the Fourth International, there are now Trotskyite organisations in 57 countries, including most of Western Europe and Latin America&quot;. However, he also argued that no Trotskyite group had ever led a revolution or built an enduring mass political party.

On the other hand, British historian and socialist Christian Høgsbjerg believed that academic literature on Trotskyism had minimised its historical role in building wider social movements. Høgsbjerg stressed the key role of British Trotskyists in various movements such as the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign (1966–71), the Anti-Nazi League (1977–81), the Anti Poll Tax Federation (1989–91) and the Stop the War Coalition (2001).

Outside of the Fourth International, Trotsky has also been admired by a range of figures across intellectual, military, political and cultural fields including philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, military general Mikhail Tukhachevsky, Marxist theorist Rosa Luxemburg, economist Paul Sweezy, philosopher John Dewey, historian A.J.P Taylor, psychoanalyst Erich Fromm, philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre, literary critic Edmund Wilson, painter Diego Rivera, political leader Martin Tranmæl and literary writer Lu Xun.

== Historical reputation==
In modern historiography, Trotsky&#x27;s legacy has evoked a range of conflicting and diverse interpretations. Prior to the October Revolution, Trotsky had been part of an old radical democracy which included both Left Mensheviks and Left Bolsheviks. By 1917, Bolshevik figures such as Anatoly Lunacharsky, Moisei Uritsky and Dmitry Manuilsky held him in comparable stature with Lenin; with the October insurrection having been carried through in accordance with Trotsky&#x27;s plan of action. He was viewed by contemporaries in the initial Soviet period and later historians as the hero of the revolution.

In the Soviet Union, his reputation gradually deteriorated over the course of the succession struggle as his views were presented as sectarian and anti-Leninist. Throughout the Stalin era, his name and image would be erased from history books, museums and films. At the same time, Trotsky became a convenient bogeyman for Soviet affairs and was associated with ideological heresy. The works of Trotsky also remained banned until the Gorbachev era. Following the de-Stalinization period, later generations of Soviet and Russian historians would reevaluate his role in the history of the revolution with varying interpretations.

Scholarly consensus holds Trotsky to have demonstrated remarkable leadership of the Red Army during the Civil War. He had been awarded the Order of the Red Banner for his role in the Red Army such as organising the defence of Petrograd when other members of the Bolshevik leadership were prepared to abandon the former capital. Swain asserted that the Bolsheviks would certainly have lost the Civil War within a single year without Trotsky as leader of the Red Army.

A number of scholars and Western socialists have argued that Trotsky represented a more democratic alternative to Stalin with particular emphasis drawn to his activities in the pre-Civil War period and as leader of the Left Opposition. Deutscher described Trotsky as the &quot;Soviet&#x27;s moving spirit&quot; in 1905 and highlighted his representation of Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and the rest of the Soviets on major occasions. Trotsky had also proposed the election of a new Soviet presidium with other socialist parties on the basis of proportional representation in September 1917. Rogovin argued that the Left Opposition, led by Trotsky, represented a &quot;real alternative to Stalinism&quot; and this served as the primary motive of Stalin&#x27;s Great Terror campaign. Daniels stated that the most distinctive features of Stalin&#x27;s rule such as his campaigns against &quot;bourgeois experts&quot; as seen with &quot;the Shakhty trials, his contemptuous anti-intellectualism and the dogmatization of Marxism, the purges—run totally counter to Trotsky&#x27;s thought&quot;.

Conversely, figures such as Volkogonov have strongly criticised his defence of the Red Terror and dictatorship of the proletariat. Service argued that his &quot;ideas and practices laid several foundation stones for the erection of the Stalinist political, economic, social and even cultural edifice&quot;. Cherniaev considered Trotsky to be partly responsible for the establishment of a one-party, authoritarian state and initiating several military practices such as summary executions which later became standard practice during the Stalinist era. Thatcher cited his defence of terror in his work, &quot;Terrorism and Communism: A Reply to Karl Kautsky,&quot; but also acknowledged that Trotsky was capable of leniency and had personally urged that White army deserters be treated with understanding.

Other writers believe that Trotsky has been maligned and caricatured as a historical figure which necessitated a historical reappraisal. French socialist Pierre Broue has criticised Western representations of Trotsky&#x27;s role in the Kronstadt rebellion which he argued had falsely presented Trotsky as the principal figure that led and was responsible for the repression. He also added that military tribunals and executions for desertions were a common feature of every war and not exclusive to the actions of the Red Army under Trotsky. Historian Betrand Patenaude regarded Service&#x27;s characterisation of Trotsky as a &quot;mass murderer and a terrorist&quot; to be reflective of a wider attempt to discredit Trotsky as a historical figure and noted his work featured several inaccuracies and distortions of the historical record.

Various historians have credited Trotsky and the Left Opposition with shifting the Soviet economic orientation from the NEP policy towards a planned economy through their proposals for mass industrialization. Trotsky had delivered a joint report to the April Plenum of the Central Committee in 1926 which proposed a program for national industrialization and the replacement of annual plans with five-year plans. His proposals were rejected by the Central Committee majority which was controlled by the troika and derided by Stalin at the time. The eventual adoption of the five year plans in 1928 would serve as the basis for Soviet modernization.

Several scholars have regarded his historical writings on the Soviet bureaucracy as having a considerable influence in shaping the receptive attitudes of later Marxists and many non-Marxists. Trotsky associated bureaucratism with authoritarianism, excessive centralism and conservatism. Political scientist Baruch Knei-Paz argued that Trotsky had done more than any other political figure to &quot;show the historical and social roots of Stalinism&quot; as a bureaucratic system. British cybernetician Stafford Beer who worked on a decentralized form of economic planning, Project Cybersyn from 1970 to 1973, was reported to have read and been influenced by Trotsky&#x27;s critique of the Soviet bureaucracy. Professional historians have noted the literary value of his social analysis with works such as &quot;1905&quot; and &quot;The History of the Russian Revolution&quot; for wider historiography.

==Political ideology and contributions to Marxism==

Trotsky considered himself to be a &quot;Bolshevik-Leninist&quot;, arguing for the establishment of a vanguard party. He viewed himself as an advocate of orthodox Marxism. Trotsky also adhered to scientific socialism and viewed this as a conscious expression of historical processes.

His politics differed in some aspects from those of Stalin or Mao Zedong, most importantly in his rejection of the theory of &quot;socialism in one country&quot; and his declaring of the need for an international &quot;permanent revolution&quot;.

In the post-Leninist struggle, Trotsky and the Left-United Opposition had advocated for a programme of rapid industrialization, voluntary collectivisation of agriculture, and the expansion of a worker&#x27;s democracy.

In 1936, Trotsky called for the restoration of the right of criticism in areas such as economic matters, the revitalization of trade unions and free elections of the Soviet parties. In the &quot;Transitional Program&quot;, which was drafted in 1938 during the founding congress of the Fourth International, Trotsky reiterated the need for political pluralism and worker&#x27;s control of production.

Supporters of the Fourth International echo Trotsky&#x27;s opposition to Stalinist totalitarianism, advocating political revolution and arguing that socialism cannot sustain itself without democracy.

=== Economic programme ===

Trotsky was an early proponent of economic planning since 1923 and favored an accelerated pace of industrialization. In 1921, he had also been a prominent supporter of Gosplan as a newly established body and called for the strengthening of its formal responsibilities to support a balanced level of economic reconstruction after the Civil War. Trotsky also urged economic decentralisation between the state, oblast regions and factories to counter structural inefficiency and the problem of bureaucracy.

Originally, he had proposed the principles underlying the N.E.P. in 1920 to the Politburo to mitigate urgent economic matters arising from war communism. He would later reproach Lenin privately about the delayed government response in 1921-1922. However, his position differed from the majority of Soviet leaders at the time who fully supported the New Economic policy.

Comparatively, Trotsky believed that planning and N.E.P should develop within a mixed framework until the socialist sector gradually superseded the private industry. He found allies among a circle of economic theorists and administrators which included Yevgeni Preobrazhensky and Georgy Pyatakov, deputy chairman of the Council of the National Economy. More broadly, intellectuals would constitute the core of the Left Opposition during the succession period.

Trotsky had specified the need for the &quot;overall guidance in planning i.e. the systematic co-ordination of the fundamental sectors of the state economy in the process of adapting to the present market&quot; and urged for a national plan alongside currency stabilization. He also rejected the Stalinist conception of industrialisation which favoured heavy industry. Rather, he proposed the use of foreign trade as an accelerator and to direct investments by means of a system of comparative coefficients.

Trotsky and the Left Opposition developed a number of economic proposals in response to the scissor crisis which had undermined relations between the workers and peasants in 1923–1924. This included a progressive tax on the wealthier sections of populations such as the kulaks and NEPmen alongside an equilibrium of the import-export balance to access accumulated reserves to purchase machinery from abroad to increase the pace of industrialization.

In 1932–33, Trotsky maintained the need for mass participation in the operationalisation of the planned economy. He elaborated on the need of Soviet democracy for the industrialization period when questioned by the Dewey Commission in 1937:

The successes are very important, and I affirmed it every time. They are due to the abolition of private property and to the possibilities inherent in planned economy. But, they – I cannot say exactly – but I will say two or three times less than they could be under a regime of Soviet democracy

According to Fitzpatrick, the scholarly consensus was that Stalin appropriated the position of the Left Opposition on such matters as industrialisation and collectivisation. Other scholars have argued that the economic programme of Trotsky differed from the forced policy of collectivisation implemented by Stalin after 1928 due to the levels of brutality associated with its enforcement.

=== Permanent Revolution ===

The Permanent Revolution concept is the theory that the bourgeois democratic tasks in countries with delayed bourgeois democratic development can only be accomplished through the establishment of a workers&#x27; state, and that the creation of a workers&#x27; state would inevitably involve inroads against capitalist property. Thus, the accomplishment of bourgeois democratic tasks passes over into proletarian tasks. Although most closely associated with Leon Trotsky, the call for a &quot;Permanent Revolution&quot; is first found in the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in March 1850, in the aftermath of the 1848 Revolution, in their Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League:

Trotsky&#x27;s conception of the Permanent Revolution is based on his understanding, drawing on the work of the founder of Russian Marxism Georgy Plekhanov, that in &quot;backward&quot; countries the tasks of the Bourgeois Democratic Revolution could not be achieved by the bourgeoisie itself. Trotsky first developed this conception in collaboration with Alexander Parvus in late 1904–1905. The relevant articles were later collected in Trotsky&#x27;s books &quot;1905&quot; and in &quot;Permanent Revolution&quot;, which also contains his essay &quot;Results and Prospects&quot;. Some Trotskyists have argued that the state of the Third World shows that capitalism offers no way forward for underdeveloped countries, thus again proving the central tenet of the theory.

According to his biographer, Isaac Deutscher, Trotsky explicitly supported revolution through proletarian internationalism but was opposed to achieving this via military conquest with documented references made to his 
personal opposition to the war with Poland in 1920, proposed armistice with the Entente and temperance with staging anti-British revolts in the Middle East.

=== United front and theory of fascism===
Trotsky was a central figure in the Comintern during its first four congresses. During this time, he helped to generalize the strategy and tactics of the Bolsheviks to newly formed Communist parties across Europe and further afield. From 1921 onwards, the united front, a method of uniting revolutionaries and reformists in the common struggle while winning some of the workers to revolution, was the central tactic put forward by the Comintern after the defeat of the German revolution.

Trotsky was a strong critic of the shifting Comintern policy position under Stalin which directed German Communists to treat social democrats as &quot;social fascists&quot;. Historian Bertrand Patenaude believed that the Comintern policy following the &quot;Great Break&quot; facilitated the rise of Hitler&#x27;s party. Marxist theorist and economist Hillel Ticktin argued that Trotsky&#x27;s political strategy and approach to fascism such as the emphasis on an organisational bloc between the German Communist Party and Social-Democratic party during the interwar period would very likely have prevented Hitler from ascending to political power.

Trotsky also formulated a theory of fascism based on a dialectical interpretation of events to analyze the manifestation of Italian fascism and the early emergence of Nazi Germany from 1930 to 1933.

After he was exiled and politically marginalized by Stalinism, Trotsky continued to argue for a united front against fascism in Germany and Spain. According to Joseph Choonara of the British Socialist Workers Party in &quot;International Socialism&quot;, his articles on the united front represent an essential part of his political legacy.

=== Uneven and combined development ===
The concept of uneven and combined development derived from the political theories of Trotsky. This concept was developed in combination with the related theory of permanent revolution to explain the historical context of Russia. He would later elaborate on this theory to explain the specific laws of uneven development in 1930 and the conditions for a possible revolutionary scenario. According to biographer Ian Thatcher, this theory would be later generalised to &quot;the entire history of mankind&quot;.

Political scientists Emanuele Saccarelli and Latha Varadarajan valued his theory as a &quot;signal contribution&quot; to the discipline of international relations. They argued his theory presented &quot;a specific understanding of capitalist development as &#x27;uneven&#x27;, insofar as it systematically featured geographically divergent &#x27;advanced&#x27; and &#x27;backward&#x27; regions&quot; across the world economy.

=== Literary criticism and socialist culture ===

In &quot;Literature and Revolution&quot;, Trotsky examined aesthetic issues in relation to class and the Russian revolution. Soviet scholar Robert Bird considered his work as the &quot;first systematic treatment of art by a Communist leader&quot; and a catalyst for later, Marxist cultural and critical theories. Trotsky also defended intellectual autonomy in regards to literary movements as well scientific theories such as Freudian psychoanalytic theory and Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity during the succession period. However, these theories were increasingly marginalised during the Stalin era.

He would later co-author the 1938 &quot;Manifesto for an Independent Revolutionary Art&quot; with the signed endorsement of Andre Breton and Rivera. Trotsky&#x27;s writings on literature such as his 1923 survey which advocated tolerance, limited censorship and respect for literary tradition had strong appeal to the New York Intellectuals.

Trotsky presented a critique of contemporary literary movements such as Futurism and emphasised a need of cultural autonomy for the development of a socialist culture. According to literary critic Terry Eagleton, Trotsky recognised &quot;like Lenin on the need for a socialist culture to absorb the finest products of bourgeois art&quot;. Trotsky himself viewed the proletarian culture as &quot;temporary and transitional&quot; which would provide the foundations for a culture above classes. He also argued that the pre-conditions for artistic creativity were economic well-being and emancipation from material constraints.

Political scientist Baruch Knei-Paz characterised his view on the role of the party as transmitters of culture to the masses and raising the standards of education, as well as entry into the cultural sphere, but that the process of artistic creation in terms of language and presentation should be the domain of the practitioner. Knei-Paz also noted key distinctions between Trotsky&#x27;s approach on cultural matters and Stalin&#x27;s policy in the 1930s.

<text>The reference desk or information desk of a library is a public service counter where professional librarians provide library users with direction to library materials, advice on library collections and services, and expertise on multiple kinds of information from multiple sources.

==Purpose and usage==
Library users can consult the staff at the reference desk for help in finding information. Using a structured reference interview, the librarian works with the library user to clarify their needs and determine what information sources will fill them. To borrow a medical analogy, reference librarians diagnose and treat information deficiencies.

The ultimate help provided may consist of reading material in the form of a book or journal article, instruction in the use of specific searchable information resources such as the library&#x27;s online catalog or subscription bibliographic/full text databases, or simply factual information drawn from the library&#x27;s print or online reference collection. Information is also provided to patrons through electronic resources. Typically, a reference desk can be consulted either in person, by telephone, through email or online chat, although a library user may be asked to come to the library in person for help with more involved research questions. A staffed and knowledgeable reference desk is an essential part of a library.

The services that are provided at a reference desk may vary depending on the type of library, its purpose, its resources, and its staff. The services of circulation and reference desks are also sometimes combined.

==History==
Reference services did not become commonplace in libraries until the late 1800s. These services initially began in public libraries. At first librarians were hesitant to offer reference services because many libraries did not have a large enough staff to provide the services without other duties being neglected. Beginning in 1883 with the Boston Public Library, libraries began to hire librarians whose primary duty was to provide reference services.

One of the earliest proponents of references services was Samuel Swett Green. He wrote an article titled &quot;Personal Relations Between Librarians and Readers&quot; which had a large impact on the future of reference services.
Utor (2008) defined reference services as a direct personal assistance to readers seeking information through direct contact between the reference librarian and the user.

Reference desks changed dramatically with the emergence of information technology. During the 2020 pandemic, there was a surge of virtual information desks. It has been found that chat, email, and web conferencing formats have become adequate substitutions for in-person conversations. AI chatbots are also being used in academic libraries to address typical information inquiries, although their use is still being tested

==Resources==
Resources that are often kept at a library reference desk may include:
* A computer with internet access. Librarians use both the public web and subscription databases to find and evaluate information and research sources. 
* A small collection of reference books (called &quot;ready reference&quot;) that are most often used, so that the librarians can reach them quickly, especially when they are on the phone, and so that the books will be returned in time for someone else to use later the same day. The library&#x27;s full reference collection is usually nearby as well.
* Newspaper clipping files and other rare or restricted items that must be returned to the reference desk.
* Index cards with the answers to frequently asked questions, and/or drawers with folders of pamphlets and photocopies of pages that, from previous experience, were difficult to find. These enable librarians to find such information quickly without leaving the desk—even faster than they could look it up in a reference book or using the Internet.
* Books and other items that are being held for library users who asked the librarian by phone to set them aside for them to pick up later the same day, or within the next few days.
* Books from the circulating collection that have been set aside for students working on a special assignment, and are temporarily designated to be used only within the library until the project is due.
* Printed lists of items in the library that are not in the catalogue, such as newspapers, school yearbooks, old telephone directories, college course catalogues, and local history sources.

==Services==
Services that are often available at a library reference desk include:
* A sign-up sheet for reserving computers with Internet access, or word processing software.
* The ability to place the book &#x27;on hold&#x27;, which prevents the person who has borrowed it from renewing it. The person who placed the &#x27;hold&#x27; is notified when the book has been returned. (Some libraries provide this service at the circulation desk.)
* The ability to request interlibrary loan of books and other material from other branch libraries in the same library system, or from a cooperating library anywhere in the world. (Some libraries provide this service at the circulation desk.)
* The opportunity to recommend that the library purchase something for its collection that it does not have, which may be needed or of interest to other library users.

The librarian who staffs the reference desk can usually do the following by virtue of their professional training and experience:
* The librarian can look up a brief, factual answer to a specific question.
* The librarian can use the catalogue to find out whether the library owns an item with a particular title or author, or that contains a short story, chapter, song, or poem with a particular title, or to compile a list of books by a particular author or on a particular subject.
* The librarian can briefly teach the user how to use the catalogue and how to use its advanced features, or recommend the proper subject words or terms that are used in the catalogue for the topic the user has in mind.
* The librarian can often take the library user directly to the shelves with books on a certain topic without using the catalogue.
* The librarian is familiar with the contents of hundreds of reference books, and can recommend books that might contain the answer to a particular question.
* The librarian can teach the library user to use online databases such as for magazine and newspaper articles, and recommend words and search strategies for the topic the user has in mind.
* The librarian can recommend reliable web sites, give advice on searching the Internet for information, and evaluate the reliability of the information on web sites.
* If the library does not have information on a given topic, or if the library user wants more information, the librarian can refer the library user to another library or to an organization that can be contacted by phone or mail.
*Offer aid with devices such as tablets and e-readers. This can range from general assistance with questions on how to navigate e-reader and tablet devices to instructing classes. Questions can vary from what devices are compatible with the library&#x27;s e-book platform, how to check out books, and how to read electronic books.

==Staff qualifications==
In the United States, those who staff library reference desks are usually required to have a master&#x27;s degree in library science from a program accredited by the American Library Association. However, if there is a lack of qualified applicants, particularly in rural areas, a person with an associate degree, a certificate in library technology, or a bachelor&#x27;s degree in library science may perform these duties. In many academic libraries, student assistants are used as the primary contact, sometimes at an &quot;information desk&quot;.

In Sri Lanka, librarians at reference desks typically have master&#x27;s degrees from the Sri Lankan Library Association&#x27;s accredited programs.

==Electronic reference services==
With the development of the Web, digital reference services are beginning to take over some of the roles of the traditional reference desk in a library. There is disagreement over whether or not this development is desirable or inevitable.

<doc id="17895" wikidata="Q19828" url="?curid=17895" title="Leap year">
<text>A leap year (also known as an intercalary year or bissextile year) is a calendar year that contains an additional day (or, in the case of a lunisolar calendar, a month) compared to a common year. The 366th day (or 13th month) is added to keep the calendar year synchronised with the astronomical year or seasonal year. Since astronomical events and seasons do not repeat in a whole number of days, calendars having a constant number of days each year will unavoidably drift over time with respect to the event that the year is supposed to track, such as seasons. By inserting (&quot;intercalating&quot;) an additional day—a leap day—or month—a [[leap month]]—into some years, the drift between a civilization&#x27;s dating system and the physical properties of the Solar System can be corrected. 

An astronomical year lasts slightly less than 365 days. The historic Julian calendar has three common years of 365 days followed by a leap year of 366 days, by extending February to 29 days rather than the common 28. The Gregorian calendar, the world&#x27;s most widely used civil calendar, makes a further adjustment for the small error in the Julian algorithm. Each leap year has 366 days instead of 365. This extra leap day occurs in each year that is a multiple of 4, except for years evenly divisible by 100 but not by 400.

In the lunisolar Hebrew calendar, Adar Aleph, a 13th lunar month, is added seven times every 19 years to the twelve lunar months in its common years to keep its calendar year from drifting through the seasons. In the Solar Hijri and Bahá&#x27;í calendars, a leap day is added when needed to ensure that the following year begins on the March equinox.

The term &quot;leap year&quot; probably comes from the fact that a fixed date in the Gregorian calendar normally advances one day of the week from one year to the next, but the day of the week in the 12 months following the leap day (from 1March through 28February of the following year) will advance two days due to the extra day, thus leaping over one day in the week. For example, since 1March was a Friday in 2024, is a Saturday in 2025, will be a Sunday in 2026, and a Monday in 2027, but will then &quot;leap&quot; over Tuesday to fall on a Wednesday in 2028.

The length of a day is also occasionally corrected by inserting a leap second into Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) because of variations in Earth&#x27;s rotation period. Unlike leap days, leap seconds are not introduced on a regular schedule because variations in the length of the day are not entirely predictable.

Leap years can present a problem in computing, known as the leap year bug, when a year is not correctly identified as a leap year or when 29February is not handled correctly in logic that accepts or manipulates dates.

==Julian calendar==

On , by edict, Julius Caesar reformed the historic Roman calendar to make it a consistent solar calendar (rather than one which was neither strictly lunar nor strictly solar), thus removing the need for frequent intercalary months. His rule for leap years was a simple one: add a leap day every 4 years. This algorithm is close to reality: a Julian year lasts 365.25days, a mean tropical year about 365.2422 days, a difference of only . Consequently, even this Julian calendar drifts out of &#x27;true&#x27; by about 3 days every 400 years. The Julian calendar continued in use unaltered for about 1600 years until the Catholic Church became concerned about the widening divergence between the March Equinox and 21 March, as explained at Gregorian calendar, below.

Prior to Caesar&#x27;s creation of what would be the Julian calendar, February was already the shortest month of the year for Romans. In the Roman calendar (after the reform of Numa Pompilius that added January and February), all months except February had an odd number of days29 or 31. This was because of a Roman superstition that even numbers were unlucky. When Caesar changed the calendar to follow the solar year closely, he made all months have 30 or 31 days, leaving February unchanged except in leap years.

==Gregorian calendar ==
In the Gregorian calendar, the standard calendar in most of the world, almost every fourth year is a leap year. Each leap year, the month of February has 29 days instead of 28. Adding one extra day in the calendar every four years compensates for the fact that a period of 365 days is shorter than a tropical year by almost six hours. However, this correction is excessive and the Gregorian reform modified the Julian calendar&#x27;s scheme of leap years as follows:
Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 are.
Whereas the Julian calendar year incorrectly summarised Earth&#x27;s tropical year as 365.25 days, the Gregorian calendar makes these exceptions to follow a calendar year of 365.2425 days. This more closely resembles a mean tropical year of 365.2422 days. Over a period of four centuries, the accumulated error of adding a leap day &quot;every&quot; four years amounts to about three extra days. The Gregorian calendar therefore omits three leap days every 400 years, which is the length of its &quot;leap cycle&quot;. This is done by omitting 29 February in the three century years (multiples of 100) that are not multiples of 400. The years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, but not 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, and 2300. By this rule, an entire leap cycle is 400 years, which totals 146,097 days, and the average number of days per year is 365 +  −  +  = 365 +  = 365.2425. This rule could be applied to years before the Gregorian reform to create a proleptic Gregorian calendar, though the result would not match any historical records.
The Gregorian calendar was designed to keep the vernal equinox on or close to 21 March, so that the date of Easter (celebrated on the Sunday after the ecclesiastical full moon that falls on or after 21 March) remains close to the vernal equinox. The &quot;Accuracy&quot; section of the &quot;Gregorian calendar&quot; article discusses how well the Gregorian calendar achieves this objective, and how well it approximates the tropical year.

== Leap day in the Julian and Gregorian calendars ==

The intercalary day that usually occurs every four years is called leap day and is created by adding an extra day to February. This day is added to the calendar in leap years as a corrective measure because the Earth does not orbit the Sun in precisely 365 days. Since about the 15th century, this extra day has been 29 February, but when the Julian calendar was introduced, the leap day was handled differently in two respects. First, leap day fell February and not at the end: 24 February was doubled to create, strangely to modern eyes, two days both dated 24 February. Second, the leap day was simply not counted so that a leap year still had 365 days.

===Early Roman practice===

The early Roman calendar was a lunisolar one that consisted of 12 months, for a total of 355 days. In addition, a 27- or 28-day intercalary month, the , was sometimes inserted into February, at the first or second day after the (23 February), to resynchronise the lunar and solar cycles. The remaining days of Februarius were discarded. This intercalary month, named or , contained 27 days. The religious festivals that were normally celebrated in the last five days of February were moved to the last five days of Intercalaris. The lunisolar calendar was abandoned about 450 BC by the , who implemented the Roman Republican calendar, used until 46 BC. The days of these calendars were counted down (inclusively) to the next named day, so 24 February was [&quot;the sixth day before the calends of March&quot;] often abbreviated The Romans counted days inclusively in their calendars, so this was the fifth day before 1 March when counted in the modern exclusive manner (i.e., not including both the starting and ending day). Because only 22 or 23 days were effectively added, not a full lunation, the calends and ides of the Roman Republican calendar were no longer associated with the new moon and full moon.

===Julian reform===
In Caesar&#x27;s revised calendar, there was just one intercalary daynowadays called the leap dayto be inserted every fourth year, and this too was done after 23 February. To create the intercalary day, the existing (sixth day (inclusive: i.e., what we would call the fifth day before) before the (first day) of March, i.e., what we would call 24 February) was doubled, producing [a second sixth day before the &quot;Kalends&quot;. This (&quot;twice sixth&quot;) was rendered in later languages as &quot;bissextile&quot;: the &quot;bissextile day&quot; is the leap day, and a &quot;bissextile year&quot; is a year which includes a leap day. This second instance of the sixth day before the Kalends of March was inserted in calendars between the &quot;normal&quot; fifth and sixth days. By legal fiction, the Romans treated both the first &quot;sixth day&quot; and the additional &quot;sixth day&quot; before the Kalends of March as one day. Thus a child born on either of those days in a leap year would have its first birthday on the following sixth day before the Kalends of March. In a leap year in the original Julian calendar, there were indeed two days both numbered 24 February. This practice continued for another fifteen to seventeen centuries, even after most countries had adopted the Gregorian calendar.

For legal purposes, the two days of the were considered to be a single day, with the second sixth being intercalated; but in common practice by the year 238, when Censorinus wrote, the intercalary day was followed by the last five days of February, &quot;a.&quot; &quot;d.&quot; &quot;VI&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;IV&quot;, &quot;III&quot;, and (the days numbered 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28 from the beginning of February in a common year), so that the intercalated day was the &quot;first&quot; of the doubled pair. Thus the intercalated day was effectively inserted between the 23rd and 24th days of February. All later writers, including Macrobius about 430, Bede in 725, and other medieval computists (calculators of Easter), continued to state that the bissextum (bissextile day) occurred before the last five days of February.

In England, the Church and civil society continued the Roman practice whereby the leap day was simply not counted, so that a leap year was only reckoned as 365 days. Henry III&#x27;s 1236 instructed magistrates to treat the leap day and the day before as one day. The practical application of the rule is obscure. It was regarded as in force in the time of the famous lawyer Sir Edward Coke (1552–1634) because he cites it in his &quot;Institutes of the Lawes of England&quot;. However, Coke merely quotes the Act with a short translation and does not give practical examples.
===29 February===
Replacement (by 29 February) of the awkward practice of having two days with the same date appears to have evolved by custom and practice; the etymological origin of the term &quot;bissextile&quot; seems to have been lost. In England in the fifteenth century, &quot;29 February&quot; appears increasingly often in legal documentsalthough the records of the proceedings of the House of Commons of England continued to use the old system until the middle of the sixteenth century. It was not until the passage of the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750 that 29 February was formally recognised in British law.

===Liturgical practices===

In the liturgical calendar of the Christian churches, the placement of the leap day is significant because of the date of the feast of Saint Matthias, which is defined as the sixth day before 1 March (counting inclusively). The Church of England&#x27;s &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; was still using the &quot;two days with the same date&quot; system in its 1542 edition; it first included a calendar which used entirely consecutive day counting from 1662 and showed leap day as falling on 29 February. In the 1680s, the Church of England declared 25 February to be the feast of St Matthias.
Until 1970, the Roman Catholic Church always celebrated the feast of Saint Matthias on , so if the days were numbered from the beginning of the month, it was named 24 February in common years, but the presence of the in a bissextile year immediately before shifted the latter day to 25 February in leap years, with the Vigil of St. Matthias shifting from 23 February to the leap day of 24 February. This shift did not take place in pre-Reformation Norway and Iceland; Pope Alexander III ruled that either practice was lawful. Other feasts normally falling on 25–28 February in common years are also shifted to the following day in a leap year (although they would be on the same day according to the Roman notation). The practice is still observed by those who use the older calendars.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the feast of St. John Cassian is celebrated on 29 February, but he is instead commemorated at Compline on 28 February in non-leap years. The feast of St. Matthias is celebrated in August, so leap years do not affect his commemoration, and, while the feast of the First and Second Findings of the Head of John the Baptist is celebrated on 24 February, the Orthodox church calculates days from the beginning of the current month, rather than counting down days to the Kalends of the following month, this is not affected. Thus, only the feast of St. John Cassian and any movable feasts associated with the Lenten or Pre-Lenten cycles are affected.

===Folk traditions===

In Ireland and Britain, it is a tradition that women may propose marriage only in leap years. While it has been claimed that the tradition was initiated by Saint Patrick or Brigid of Kildare in 5th century Ireland, this is dubious, as the tradition has not been attested before the 19th century. Supposedly, a 1288 law by Queen Margaret of Scotland (then age five and living in Norway), required that fines be levied if a marriage proposal was refused by the man; compensation was deemed to be a pair of leather gloves, a single rose, £1, and a kiss. In some places the tradition was tightened to restricting female proposals to the modern leap day, 29 February, or to the medieval (bissextile) leap day, 24 February.

According to Felten: &quot;A play from the turn of the 17th century, &#x27;The Maydes Metamorphosis,&#x27; has it that &#x27;this is leape year/women wear breeches.&#x27; A few hundred years later, breeches wouldn&#x27;t do at all: Women looking to take advantage of their opportunity to pitch woo were expected to wear a scarlet petticoatfair warning, if you will.&quot;

In Finland, the tradition is that if a man refuses a woman&#x27;s proposal on leap day, he should buy her the fabrics for a skirt.

In France, since 1980, a satirical newspaper titled &quot;La Bougie du Sapeur&quot; is published only on leap year, on 29 February.

In Greece, marriage in a leap year is considered unlucky. One in five engaged couples in Greece will plan to avoid getting married in a leap year.

In February 1988 the town of Anthony, Texas, declared itself the &quot;leap year capital of the world&quot;, and an international leapling birthday club was started.

===Birthdays===
A person born on February 29 may be called a &quot;leapling&quot; or a &quot;leaper&quot;. In common years, they celebrate their birthdays on 28 February or 1 March. 

Technically, a leapling will have fewer &quot;birthday anniversaries&quot; than their age in years. This phenomenon may be exploited for dramatic effect when a person is declared to be only a quarter of their actual age, by counting their leap-year birthday anniversaries only. For example, in Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s 1879 comic opera &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, Frederic (the pirate apprentice) discovers that he is bound to serve the pirates until his 21st &quot;birthday&quot; (that is, when he turns 88 years old, since 1900 was not a leap year) rather than until his 21st &quot;year&quot;.

For legal purposes, legal birthdays depend on how local laws count time intervals.

==== Taiwan ====

The Civil Code of Taiwan since 10 October 1929, implies that the legal birthday of a leapling is 28 February in common years:

==== Hong Kong ====
Since 1990 non-retroactively, Hong Kong considers the legal birthday of a leapling 1 March in common years:
====UK====
In the UK 1 March is considered to be a leapling&#x27;s legal birthday.

===Revised Julian calendar===
The Revised Julian calendar adds an extra day to February in years that are multiples of four, except for years that are multiples of 100 that do not leave a remainder of 200 or 600 when divided by 900. This rule agrees with the rule for the Gregorian calendar until 2799. The first year that dates in the Revised Julian calendar will not agree with those in the Gregorian calendar will be 2800, because it will be a leap year in the Gregorian calendar but not in the Revised Julian calendar.

This rule gives an average year length of 365.242222 days. This is a very good approximation to the &quot;mean&quot; tropical year, but because the &quot;vernal equinox&quot; year is slightly longer, the Revised Julian calendar, for the time being, does not do as good a job as the Gregorian calendar at keeping the vernal equinox on or close to 21 March.

==Baháʼí calendar==

The Baháʼí calendar is a solar calendar composed of 19 months of 19 days each (361 days). Years begin at Naw-Rúz, on the vernal equinox, on or about 21 March. A period of intercalary days, called Ayyam-i-Ha, is inserted before the 19th month. This period normally has four days, but an extra day is added when needed to ensure that the following year starts on the vernal equinox. This is calculated and known years in advance.

== Bengali, Indian and Thai calendars ==
The Revised Bengali Calendar of Bangladesh and the Indian National Calendar organise their leap years so that every leap day is close to 29 February in the Gregorian calendar and vice versa. This makes it easy to convert dates to or from Gregorian.

The Thai solar calendar uses the Buddhist Era (BE) but has been synchronised with the Gregorian since AD 1941.

==Chinese calendar==
The Chinese calendar is lunisolar, so a leap year has an extra month, often called an &quot;embolismic&quot; month after the Greek word for it. In the Chinese calendar, the leap month is added according to a rule which ensures that month 11 is always the month that contains the northern winter solstice. The intercalary month takes the same number as the preceding month; for example, if it follows the second month (二月) then it is simply called &quot;leap second month&quot; i.e., .

==Hebrew calendar==
The Hebrew calendar is lunisolar with an embolismic month. This extra month is called &quot;Adar Rishon&quot; (first Adar) and is added before &quot;Adar&quot;, which then becomes &quot;Adar Sheini&quot; (second Adar). According to the Metonic cycle, this is done seven times every nineteen years (specifically, in years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19). This is to ensure that Passover () is always in the spring as required by the Torah (Pentateuch) in many verses relating to Passover.

In addition, the Hebrew calendar has postponement rules that postpone the start of the year by one or two days. These postponement rules reduce the number of different combinations of year length and starting days of the week from 28 to 14, and regulate the location of certain religious holidays in relation to the Sabbath. In particular, the first day of the Hebrew year can never be Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday. This rule is known in Hebrew as &quot;&quot; (), i.e., &quot;Rosh [ha-Shanah, first day of the year] is not Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday&quot; (as the Hebrew word is written by three Hebrew letters signifying Sunday, Wednesday, and Friday). Accordingly, the first day of Passover is never Monday, Wednesday, or Friday. This rule is known in Hebrew as &quot;&quot; (), which has a double meaning — &quot;Passover is not a legend&quot;, but also &quot;Passover is not Monday, Wednesday, or Friday&quot; (as the Hebrew word is written by three Hebrew letters signifying Monday, Wednesday, and Friday).

One reason for this rule is that Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Hebrew calendar and the tenth day of the Hebrew year, now must never be adjacent to the weekly Sabbath (which is Saturday), i.e., it must never fall on Friday or Sunday, in order not to have two adjacent Sabbath days. However, Yom Kippur can still be on Saturday. A second reason is that Hoshana Rabbah, the 21st day of the Hebrew year, will never be on Saturday. These rules for the Feasts do not apply to the years from the Creation to the deliverance of the Hebrews from Egypt under Moses. It was at that time (cf. Exodus 13) that the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob gave the Hebrews their &quot;Law&quot; including the days to be kept holy and the feast days and Sabbaths.

Years consisting of 12 months have between 353 and 355 days. In a (&quot;in order&quot;) 354-day year, months have alternating 30 and 29 day lengths. In a (&quot;lacking&quot;) year, the month of Kislev is reduced to 29 days. In a (&quot;filled&quot;) year, the month of Marcheshvan is increased to 30 days. 13-month years follow the same pattern, with the addition of the 30-day Adar Alef, giving them between 383 and 385 days.

==Islamic calendars==
The observed and calculated versions of the lunar Islamic calendar do not have regular leap days, even though both have lunar months containing 29 or 30 days, generally in alternating order. However, the tabular Islamic calendar used by Islamic astronomers during the Middle Ages and still used by some Muslims does have a regular leap day added to the last month of the lunar year in 11 years of a 30-year cycle. This additional day is found at the end of the last month, Dhu al-Hijjah, which is also the month of the Hajj.

The Solar Hijri calendar is the modern Iranian calendar. It is an observational calendar that starts on the spring equinox (Northern Hemisphere) and adds a single intercalated day to the last month (Esfand) once every four or five years; the first leap year occurs as the fifth year of the typical 33-year cycle and the remaining leap years occur every four years through the remainder of the 33-year cycle. This system has less periodic deviation or jitter from its mean year than the Gregorian calendar and operates on the simple rule that New Year&#x27;s Day must fall in the 24 hours of the vernal equinox. The 33-year period is not completely regular; every so often the 33-year cycle will be broken by a cycle of 29 years.

The Hijri-Shamsi calendar, also adopted by the Ahmadiyya Community, is based on solar calculations and is similar to the Gregorian calendar in its structure with the exception that its epoch is the Hijra.

==Coptic and Ethiopian calendars==
The Coptic calendar has 13 months, 12 of 30 days each, and one at the end of the year of 5 days, or 6 days in leap years. The Coptic Leap Year follows the same rules as the Julian Calendar so that the extra month always has 6 days in the year before a Julian Leap Year. The Ethiopian calendar has 12 months of 30 days plus 5 or 6 epagomenal days, which comprise a 13th month.

<doc id="17897" wikidata="Q41508" url="?curid=17897" title="Ludwig Mies van der Rohe">
<text>Ludwig Mies van der Rohe ( ; ; born Maria Ludwig Michael Mies; March 27, 1886August 17, 1969) was a German-American architect, academic, and interior designer. He was commonly referred to as Mies, his surname. He is regarded as one of the pioneers of modern architecture.

In the 1930s, Mies was the last director of the Bauhaus, a ground-breaking school of modernist art, design and architecture. After Nazism&#x27;s rise to power, with its strong opposition to modernism, Mies emigrated to the United States. He accepted the position to head the architecture school at what is today the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT).

Mies sought to establish his own particular architectural style that could represent modern times. His buildings made use of modern materials such as industrial steel and plate glass to define interior spaces. He is often associated with his fondness for the aphorisms &quot;less is more&quot; and &quot;God is in the details&quot;.

==Early career==
Mies was born March 27, 1886, in Aachen, Germany. He worked in his father&#x27;s stone carving shop and at several local design firms before he moved to Berlin, where he joined the office of interior designer Bruno Paul. He began his architectural career as an apprentice at the studio of Peter Behrens from 1908 to 1912, where he was exposed to the current design theories and to progressive German culture. He worked alongside Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, who was later also involved in the development of the Bauhaus. Mies served as construction manager of the Embassy of the German Empire in Saint Petersburg under Behrens.

Ludwig Mies renamed himself as part of his transformation from a tradesman&#x27;s son to an architect working with Berlin&#x27;s cultural elite, adding &quot;van der&quot; and his mother&#x27;s maiden name &quot;Rohe&quot; and using the Dutch &quot;van der&quot;, because the German form &quot;von&quot; was a nobiliary particle legally restricted to those of German nobility lineage. He began his independent professional career designing upper-class homes.

==Personal life==
In 1913 Mies married Adele Auguste (Ada) Bruhn (1885–1951), the daughter of a wealthy industrialist. The couple separated in 1918, after having three daughters: Dorothea (1914–2008), an actress and dancer who was known as Georgia, Marianne (1915–2003), and Waltraut (1917–1959), who was a research scholar and curator at the Art Institute of Chicago. During his military service in 1917, Mies fathered a son out of wedlock.

In 1925, Mies began a relationship with designer Lilly Reich that ended when he moved to the United States; from 1940 until his death, artist Lora Marx (1900–1989) was his primary companion. Mies carried on a romantic relationship with sculptor and art collector Mary Callery for whom he designed an artist&#x27;s studio in Huntington, Long Island, New York. He had a brief romantic relationship with Nelly van Doesburg. After having met in Europe many years prior, they met again in New York in 1947 during a dinner with Josep Lluís Sert where he promised her he would help organize an exhibition in Chicago featuring the work of her late husband Theo van Doesburg. This exhibition took place from October 15 until November 8, 1947, with their romance officially ending not much later. Nevertheless they remained on good terms, spending Easter together in 1948 at a modern farmhouse renovated by Mies on Long Island, as well as meeting several more times that year.

==Transition from traditionalism to Modernism==

After World War I, while still designing traditional neoclassical homes, Mies began a parallel experimental effort. He joined his avant-garde peers in the long-running search for a new style that would be suitable for the modern industrial age. The weak points of traditional styles had been under attack by progressive theorists since the mid-nineteenth century, primarily for the contradictions of hiding modern construction technology with a facade of ornamented traditional styles.

The mounting criticism of the historical styles gained substantial cultural credibility after World War I, a disaster widely seen as a failure of the old world order of imperial leadership of Europe. The aristocratic classical revival styles were particularly reviled by many as the architectural symbol of a now-discredited and outmoded social system. Progressive thinkers called for a completely new architectural design process guided by rational problem-solving and an exterior expression of modern materials and structure rather than what they considered the superficial application of classical facades.

While continuing his traditional neoclassical design practice, Mies began to develop visionary projects that, though mostly unbuilt, rocketed him to fame as an architect capable of giving form that was in harmony with the spirit of the emerging modern society. Boldly abandoning ornament altogether, Mies made a dramatic modernist debut in 1921 with his stunning competition proposal for the faceted all-glass Friedrichstraße skyscraper, followed by a taller curved version in 1922 named the Glass Skyscraper.

He constructed his first modernist house with the Villa Wolf in 1926 in Guben (today Gubin, Poland) for Erich and Elisabeth Wolf. This was shortly followed by Haus Lange and Haus Esters in 1928.

He continued with a series of pioneering projects, culminating in his two European masterworks: the temporary German Pavilion for the Barcelona exposition (often called the Barcelona Pavilion) in 1929 (a 1986 reconstruction is now built on the original site) and the elegant Villa Tugendhat in Brno, Czechoslovakia, completed in 1930.

He joined the German avant-garde, working with the progressive design magazine &quot;G&quot;, which started in July 1923. He developed prominence as architectural director of the Werkbund, organizing the influential Weissenhof Estate prototype modernist housing exhibition. He was also one of the founders of the architectural association Der Ring. He joined the avant-garde Bauhaus design school as their director of architecture, adopting and developing their functionalist application of simple geometric forms in the design of useful objects. He served as its last director.

Like many other avant-garde architects of the day, Mies based his architectural mission and principles on his understanding and interpretation of ideas developed by theorists and critics who pondered the declining relevance of the traditional design styles. He selectively adopted theoretical ideas such as the aesthetic credos of Russian Constructivism with their ideology of &quot;efficient&quot; sculptural assembly of modern industrial materials. Mies found appeal in the use of simple rectilinear and planar forms, clean lines, pure use of color, and the extension of space around and beyond interior walls expounded by the Dutch De Stijl group. In particular, the layering of functional sub-spaces within an overall space and the distinct articulation of parts as expressed by Gerrit Rietveld appealed to Mies.

As households in the middle class and upper class could increasingly afford household appliances, modern architects like Mies, Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius and Adolf Loos rejected decorative architecture and became drivers of a modern Arts and Crafts movement in Europe.

Mies and Le Corbusier later acknowledged the lasting impact Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s &quot;Wasmuth Portfolio&quot; had after it was exhibited in Berlin.

==Emigration to the United States==
Mies&#x27;s first US commission was the interior of Philip Johnson&#x27;s New York apartment, in 1930.

Starting in 1930, Mies served as the last director of the faltering Bauhaus, at the request of his colleague and competitor Gropius. In 1932, the Nazis forced the state-sponsored school to leave its campus in Dessau, and Mies moved it to an abandoned telephone factory in Berlin. In April 1933, the school was raided by the Gestapo, and in July of that year, because the Nazis had made the continued operation of the school untenable, Mies and the faculty &quot;voted&quot; to close the Bauhaus.

Some of Mies&#x27;s designs found favour with Adolf Hitler, such as his designs for autobahn service stations. Mies and Gropius both joined the visual arts section of the Reich Culture Chamber and entered early Nazi architectural competitions, with designs showing structures decorated with swastikas. Mies&#x27;s design for a Reich Bank building in Berlin was one of six to receive a prize, although it was rejected by Hitler. Mies and Gropius wanted to be accepted by the Nazis, and both signed an artists&#x27; manifesto supporting Hitler&#x27;s succession to Hindenburg. Mies&#x27;s Modernist designs of glass and steel were not considered suitable for state buildings by the Nazis, and in 1937 or 1938 he reluctantly followed Gropius to the United States.

He accepted a residential commission in Wyoming and then an offer to head the department of architecture of the newly established Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in Chicago. Mies was allowed to combine ideological conviction with commerce. Already in 1919 he had drawn up plans for an office glass tower. In New York he found investors for the Seagram Building, which was completed in 1958.

==Career in the United States==

Mies settled in Chicago, Illinois, where he was appointed head of the architecture school at Chicago&#x27;s Armour Institute of Technology (later renamed Illinois Institute of Technology). One of the benefits of taking this position was that he would be commissioned to design the new buildings and master plan for the campus. All his buildings still stand there, including Alumni Hall, the chapel, and his masterpiece the S.R. Crown Hall, built as the home of IIT&#x27;s School of Architecture.

In 1944, he became an American citizen, completing his severance from his native Germany. His thirty years as an American architect reflect a more structural, pure approach toward achieving his goal of a new architecture for the twentieth century. He focused his efforts on enclosing open and adaptable &quot;universal&quot; spaces with clearly arranged structural frameworks, featuring prefabricated steel shapes filled in with large sheets of glass.

His early projects at the IIT campus, and for developer Herbert Greenwald, presented to Americans a style that seemed a natural progression of the almost forgotten nineteenth century Chicago School style. His architecture, with origins in the German Bauhaus and western European International Style, became an accepted mode of building for American cultural and educational institutions, developers, public agencies, and large corporations.

==Notable buildings==
===Chicago Federal Complex===

Chicago Federal Center Plaza, also known as Chicago Federal Plaza, unified three buildings of varying scales: the mid-rise Everett McKinley Dirksen United States Courthouse, the high-rise John C. Kluczynski Building, and the single-story Post Office building. The complex&#x27;s plot area extends over two blocks; a one-block site, bounded by Jackson, Clark, Adams, and Dearborn streets, contains the Kluczynski Federal Building and U.S. Post Office Loop Station, while a parcel on an adjacent block to the east contains the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse. The structural framing of the buildings is formed of high-tensile bolted steel and concrete. The exterior curtain walls are defined by projecting steel I-beam mullions covered with flat black graphite paint, characteristic of Mies&#x27;s designs. The balance of the curtain walls are of bronze-tinted glass panes, framed in shiny aluminum, and separated by steel spandrels, also covered with flat black graphite paint. The entire complex is organized on a 28-foot grid pattern subdivided into six 4-foot, 8-inch modules. This pattern extends from the granite-paved plaza into the ground-floor lobbies of the two tower buildings with the grid lines continuing vertically up the buildings and integrating each component of the complex. Associated architects that have played a role in the complex&#x27;s long history from 1959 to 1974 include Schmidt, Garden &amp; Erickson; C.F. Murphy Associates; and A. Epstein &amp; Sons.

===Edith Farnsworth House ===

Between 1946 and 1951, Mies van der Rohe designed and built the Edith Farnsworth House, a weekend retreat outside Chicago for an independent professional woman, Dr. Edith Farnsworth. Here, Mies explored the relationship between people, shelter, and nature. The glass pavilion is raised six feet above a floodplain next to the Fox River, surrounded by forest and rural prairies.

The house took a while to be built due to the underlying issues between Mies and Edith Farnsworth. There was a complex relationship between the two for a variety of reasons, some related to personal feelings and others to design considerations. Back and forth legal disputes led to these ongoging issues despite the beautiful outcome of the design.

The highly crafted pristine white structural frame and all-glass walls define a simple rectilinear interior space, allowing nature and light to envelop the interior space. A wood-paneled fireplace (also housing mechanical equipment, kitchen, and toilets) is positioned within the open space to suggest living, dining and sleeping spaces without using walls. No partitions touch the surrounding all-glass enclosure. Without solid exterior walls, full-height draperies on a perimeter track allow freedom to provide full or partial privacy when and where desired. The house has been described as sublime, a temple hovering between heaven and earth, a poem, a work of art.

The Edith Farnsworth House and its wooded site was purchased at auction for US$7.5 million by preservation groups in 2004 and is now owned and operated by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as a public museum. The building influenced the creation of hundreds of modernist glass houses, most notably the Glass House by Philip Johnson, located near New York City and also now owned by the National Trust.

===860–880 Lake Shore Drive===
The 860–880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments were built between 1948 and 1951 and came to define postwar US Modernism. These towers, with façades of steel and glass, were radical departures from the typical residential brick apartment buildings.

Mies designed a series of four middle-income high-rise apartment buildings for developer Herbert Greenwald. The towers were simple rectangular boxes with a non-hierarchical wall enclosure, raised on stilts above a glass-enclosed lobby. The lobby is set back from the perimeter columns, which were exposed around the perimeter of the building above, creating a modern colonnade. This configuration created a feeling of light, openness, and freedom of movement at the ground level that became the prototype for countless new high rises designed both by Mies&#x27;s office and his followers.

===Seagram Building===
Although now acclaimed and widely influential as an urban design feature, Mies had to convince Bronfman&#x27;s bankers that a taller tower with significant &quot;unused&quot; open space at ground level would enhance the presence and prestige of the building. Mies&#x27;s design included a bronze curtain wall with external H-shaped mullions that were exaggerated in depth beyond what was structurally necessary. Detractors criticized it as having committed Adolf Loos&#x27;s &quot;crime of ornamentation&quot;. Philip Johnson had a role in interior materials selections, and he designed the sumptuous Four Seasons Restaurant. The Seagram Building is said to be an early example of the innovative &quot;fast-track&quot; construction process, where design documentation and construction are done concurrently.

===McCormick House===
During 1951–1952, Mies designed the steel, glass, and brick McCormick House, located in Elmhurst, Illinois (18 miles west of the Chicago Loop), for real-estate developer Robert Hall McCormick, Jr. A one-story adaptation of the exterior curtain wall of his famous 860–880 Lake Shore Drive towers, it served as a prototype for an unbuilt series of speculative houses to be constructed in Melrose Park, Illinois. The house has since been relocated and reconfigured as a part of the Elmhurst Art Museum.

===Museum of Fine Arts, Houston===

Mies designed two buildings for the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (MFAH) as additions to the Caroline Wiess Law Building. In 1953, the MFAH commissioned Mies van der Rohe to create a master plan for the institution. He designed two additions to the building—Cullinan Hall, completed in 1958, and the Brown Pavilion, completed in 1974. A renowned example of the International Style, these portions of the Caroline Wiess Law Building comprise one of only two Mies-designed museums in the world.

=== Two buildings in Baltimore, MD ===
The One Charles Center, built in 1962, is a 23-story aluminum and glass building that heralded the beginning of Baltimore&#x27;s downtown modern buildings. The Highfield House, just to the northeast of the Johns Hopkins Homewood campus, was built in 1964 as a rental apartment building. The 15-story concrete tower became a residential condominium building in 1979. Both buildings are now on the National Register of Historic Places.

===National Gallery, Berlin===
Mies&#x27;s last work was the Neue Nationalgalerie art museum, the New National Gallery for the Berlin National Gallery. Considered one of the most perfect statements of his architectural approach, the upper pavilion is a precise composition of monumental steel columns and a cantilevered (overhanging) roof plane with a glass enclosure. The simple square glass pavilion is a powerful expression of his ideas about flexible interior space, defined by transparent walls and supported by an external structural frame.

===Mies Building at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana===
In 1952, a fraternity commissioned Mies to design a building on the Indiana University campus in Bloomington, Indiana. The plan was not realized during his lifetime, but the design was rediscovered in 2013, and in 2019 the university&#x27;s Eskenazi School of Art, Architecture + Design announced they would be constructing it with blessing of his grandchildren. As of June 2022, the building is completed and open.

===Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library===
Mies designed Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library in Washington, DC. The building was completed in 1972 at a cost of $18 million and three years after Mies death. It is the central facility of the District of Columbia Public Library (DCPL), and is his only realized library and his only building in Washington D.C.

==Furniture==

Mies, often in collaboration with Lilly Reich, designed modern furniture pieces using new industrial technologies that have become popular classics, such as the Barcelona chair and table, the Brno chair, and the Tugendhat chair. These pieces are manufactured under licence by the Knoll furniture company.

His furniture is known for fine craftsmanship, a mixture of traditional luxurious fabrics like leather combined with modern chrome frames, and a distinct separation of the supporting structure and the supported surfaces, often employing cantilevers to enhance the feeling of lightness created by delicate structural frames.

==Educator==

In 1953 the &quot;House Beautiful&quot; editor Elizabeth Gordon published an editorial under the title &quot;The Threat to the Next America&quot;. In it, she criticized Mies&#x27;s Villa Tugendhat as cold, barren design and dismissed Mies as European Architect.

Mies served as the last director of Bauhaus, and then headed the department of architecture, Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, where he developed the Second Chicago School. He played a significant role as an educator, believing his architectural language could be learned, then applied to design any type of modern building. He set up a new education at the department of architecture of the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, replacing the traditional Ecole des Beaux-Art curriculum with a three-step-education beginning with crafts of drawing and construction leading to planning skills and finishing with theory of architecture. He worked personally and intensively on prototype solutions, and then allowed his students, both in school and his office, to develop derivative solutions for specific projects under his guidance.

Mies placed great importance on education of architects who could carry on his design principles. He devoted a great deal of time and effort leading the architecture program at Illinois Institute of Technology. 

Mies served on the initial Advisory Board of the Graham Foundation in Chicago. His own work as architect focused on intensive personal involvement in design efforts to create prototype solutions for building types.

==Death and legacy==

In 1961, a program at Columbia University&#x27;s School of Architecture celebrated the four great founders of contemporary architecture: Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Frank Lloyd Wright. It included addresses by Le Corbusier and Gropius as well as an interview with Mies van der Rohe. Discussion focused upon philosophies of design, aspects of their various architectural projects, and the juncture of architecture and city planning.

In 1963, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 1966 Robert Venturi coined the postmodern motto &quot;less is a bore&quot; as countervision to Mies&#x27;s motto &quot;less is more&quot;.

Technological advances in the manufacturing of architectural glass generated renewed interest in Mies&#x27;s 1922 designs for a high-rise block on Friedrichstrasse in Berlin. Mies&#x27;s Farnsworth House in Plano Illinois became a recurrent theme in 20th century architecture because it resembled a glass house. Technological limits meant that Mies&#x27;s vision for a &quot;skin and bones&quot; architecture, where the steel frame was exposed internally and externally could never be fully realized. Mies also inspired the minimalism movement which fused Japanese architecture with Zen gardens.

Mies van der Rohe died on August 17, 1969, from esophageal cancer caused by his smoking habit. After cremation, his ashes were buried near Chicago&#x27;s other famous architects in Chicago&#x27;s Graceland Cemetery. His grave is marked by an intentionally unadorned, clean-line black slab of polished granite.

While Mies van der Rohe&#x27;s work had enormous influence and critical recognition, his approach failed to sustain a creative force as a style after his death. By the 1980s, Mies&#x27; style was eclipsed by a new wave of modernism and post-modernism. This new style of architecture is evident in the buildings designed by Kevin Roche, one of Mies&#x27; students at IIT in Chicago.

==Archives==
The Ludwig Mies van der Rohe Archive, an administratively independent section of the Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s department of architecture and design, was established in 1968 by the museum&#x27;s trustees. It was founded in response to the architect&#x27;s desire to bequeath his entire work to the museum. The archive consists of about nineteen thousand drawings and prints, one thousand of which are by the designer and architect Lilly Reich (1885–1947), Mies van der Rohe&#x27;s close collaborator from 1927 to 1937; of written documents (primarily, the business correspondence) covering nearly the entire career of the architect; of photographs of buildings, models, and furniture; and of audiotapes, books, and periodicals.

Archival materials are also held by the Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago. The Ludwig Mies van der Rohe Collection, 1929–1969 (bulk 1948–1960) includes correspondence, articles, and materials related to his association with the Illinois Institute of Technology. The Ludwig Mies van der Rohe Metropolitan Structures Collection, 1961–1969, includes scrapbooks and photographs documenting Chicago projects.

Other archives are held at the University of Illinois at Chicago (personal book collection), the Canadian Centre for Architecture (drawings and photos) in Montreal, the Newberry Library in Chicago (personal correspondence), and at the Library of Congress in Washington D.C. (professional correspondence).

==Tributes==

There is a street named after him in his birth town of Aachen known as Mies-van-der Rohe-Straße. 

Mies van der Rohe was a partial inspiration for the character of László Tóth in Brady Corbet&#x27;s film The Brutalist.

<doc id="17900" wikidata="Q4724" url="?curid=17900" title="Le Corbusier">
<text>Charles-Édouard Jeanneret (6 October 188727 August 1965), known as Le Corbusier ( , , ), was a Swiss-French architect, designer, painter, urban planner and writer, who was one of the pioneers of what is now regarded as modern architecture. He was born in Switzerland to French speaking Swiss parents, and acquired French nationality by naturalization on 19 September 1930. His career spanned five decades, in which he designed buildings in Europe, Japan, India, as well as North and South America. He considered that &quot;the roots of modern architecture are to be found in Viollet-le-Duc&quot;.

Dedicated to providing better living conditions for the residents of crowded cities, Le Corbusier was influential in urban planning, and was a founding member of the (CIAM). Le Corbusier prepared the master plan for the city of Chandigarh in India, and contributed specific designs for several buildings there, especially the government buildings.

On 17 July 2016, seventeen projects by Le Corbusier in seven countries were inscribed in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites as The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement.

Le Corbusier remains a controversial figure. Some of his urban planning ideas have been criticized for their indifference to pre-existing cultural sites, societal expression and equality, and his alleged ties with fascism, antisemitism, eugenics, and the dictator Benito Mussolini have resulted in some continuing contention.

Le Corbusier also designed well-known furniture such as the LC4 Chaise Lounge chair and the LC1 chair, both made of leather with metal framing.

==Early life (1887–1904)==
Charles-Édouard Jeanneret was born on 6 October 1887 in La Chaux-de-Fonds, a city in the Neuchâtel canton in the Romandie region of Switzerland. His ancestors included Belgians with the surname &quot;Lecorbésier&quot;, which inspired the pseudonym &quot;Le Corbusier&quot; which he would adopt as an adult. His father was an artisan who enameled boxes and watches, and his mother taught piano. His elder brother Albert was an amateur violinist. He attended a kindergarten that used Fröbelian methods.

Located in the Jura Mountains across the border from France, La Chaux-de-Fonds was a burgeoning city at the heart of the Watch Valley. Its culture was influenced by the Loge L&#x27;Amitié, a Masonic lodge upholding moral, social, and philosophical ideas symbolized by the right angle (rectitude) and the compass (exactitude). Le Corbusier would later describe these as &quot;my guide, my choice&quot; and as &quot;time-honored ideas, ingrained and deep-rooted in the intellect, like entries from a catechism.&quot;

Like his contemporaries Frank Lloyd Wright and Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier lacked formal training as an architect. He was attracted to the visual arts; at the age of fifteen, he entered the municipal art school in La-Chaux-de-Fonds which taught the applied arts connected with watchmaking. Three years later he attended the higher course of decoration, founded by the painter Charles L&#x27;Eplattenier, who had studied in Budapest and Paris. Le Corbusier wrote later that L&#x27;Eplattenier had made him &quot;a man of the woods&quot; and taught him about painting from nature. His father frequently took him into the mountains around the town. He wrote later, &quot;we were constantly on mountaintops; we grew accustomed to a vast horizon.&quot; His architecture teacher in the Art School was architect René Chapallaz, who had a large influence on Le Corbusier&#x27;s earliest house designs. He reported later that it was the art teacher L&#x27;Eplattenier who made him choose architecture. &quot;I had a horror of architecture and architects,&quot; he wrote. &quot;...I was sixteen, I accepted the verdict and I obeyed. I moved into architecture.&quot;

==Travel and first houses (1905–1914)==
Le Corbusier began teaching himself by going to the library to read about architecture and philosophy, visiting museums, sketching buildings, and constructing them. In 1905, he and two other students, under the supervision of their teacher, René Chapallaz, designed and built his first house, the Villa Fallet, for the engraver Louis Fallet, a friend of his teacher Charles L&#x27;Eplattenier. Located on the forested hillside near Chaux-de-fonds, it was a large chalet with a steep roof in the local alpine style and carefully crafted coloured geometric patterns on the façade. The success of this house led to his construction of two similar houses, the Villas Jacquemet and Stotzer, in the same area.

In September 1907, he made his first trip outside of Switzerland, going to Italy; then that winter travelling through Budapest to Vienna, where he stayed for four months and met Gustav Klimt and tried, without success, to meet Josef Hoffmann. In Florence, he visited the Florence Charterhouse in Galluzzo, which made a lifelong impression on him. &quot;I would have liked to live in one of what they called their cells,&quot; he wrote later. &quot;It was the solution for a unique kind of worker&#x27;s housing, or rather for a terrestrial paradise.&quot; He travelled to Paris, and for fourteen months between 1908 and 1910 he worked as a draftsman in the office of the architect Auguste Perret, the pioneer of the use of reinforced concrete in residential construction and the architect of the Art Deco landmark Théâtre des Champs-Élysées. Two years later, between October 1910 and March 1911, he travelled to Germany and worked for four months in the office Peter Behrens, where Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius were also working and learning.

In 1911, he travelled again with his friend August Klipstein for five months; this time he journeyed to the Balkans and visited Serbia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Greece, as well as Pompeii and Rome, filling nearly 80 sketchbooks with renderings of what he saw—including many sketches of the Parthenon, whose forms he would later praise in his work &quot;Vers une architecture&quot; (1923). He spoke of what he saw during this trip in many of his books, and it was the subject of his last book, &quot;Le Voyage d&#x27;Orient&quot;.

In 1912, he began his most ambitious project: a new house for his parents, also located on the forested hillside near La-Chaux-de-Fonds. The Jeanneret-Perret house was larger than the others, and in a more innovative style; the horizontal planes contrasted dramatically with the steep alpine slopes, and the white walls and lack of decoration were in sharp contrast with the other buildings on the hillside. The interior spaces were organized around the four pillars of the salon in the centre, foretelling the open interiors he would create in his later buildings. The project was more expensive to build than he imagined; his parents were forced to move from the house within ten years and relocate to a more modest house. However, it led to a commission to build an even more imposing villa in the nearby village of Le Locle for a wealthy watch manufacturer, Georges Favre-Jacot. Le Corbusier designed the new house in less than a month. The building was carefully designed to fit its hillside site, and the interior plan was spacious and designed around a courtyard for maximum light, a significant departure from the traditional house.

==Dom-ino House and Schwob House (1914–1918)==
During World War I, Le Corbusier taught at his old school in La-Chaux-de-Fonds. He concentrated on theoretical architectural studies using modern techniques. In December 1914, along with the engineer Max Dubois, he began a serious study of the use of reinforced concrete as a building material. He had first discovered concrete working in the office of Auguste Perret, the pioneer of reinforced concrete architecture in Paris, but now wanted to use it in new ways.

&quot;Reinforced concrete provided me with incredible resources,&quot; he wrote later, &quot;and variety, and a passionate plasticity in which by themselves my structures will be the rhythm of a palace, and a Pompieen tranquillity.&quot; This led him to his plan for the Dom-Ino House (1914–15). This model proposed an open floor plan consisting of three concrete slabs supported by six thin reinforced concrete columns, with a stairway providing access to each level on one side of the floor plan. The system was originally designed to provide large numbers of temporary residences after World War I, producing only slabs, columns and stairways, and residents could build exterior walls with the materials around the site. He described it in his patent application as &quot;a juxtiposable system of construction according to an infinite number of combinations of plans. This would permit, he wrote, &quot;the construction of the dividing walls at any point on the façade or the interior.&quot;

Under this system, the structure of the house did not have to appear on the outside but could be hidden behind a glass wall, and the interior could be arranged in any way the architect liked. After it was patented, Le Corbusier designed several houses according to the system, which was all white concrete boxes. Although some of these were never built, they illustrated his basic architectural ideas which would dominate his works throughout the 1920s. He refined the idea in his 1927 book on the &quot;Five Points of a New Architecture&quot;. This design, which called for the disassociation of the structure from the walls, and the freedom of plans and façades, became the foundation for most of his architecture over the next ten years.

In August 1916, Le Corbusier received his largest commission ever, to construct a villa for the Swiss watchmaker Anatole Schwob, for whom he had already completed several small remodelling projects. He was given a large budget and the freedom to design not only the house but also to create the interior decoration and choose the furniture. Following the precepts of Auguste Perret, he built the structure out of reinforced concrete and filled the gaps with brick. The centre of the house is a large concrete box with two semicolumn structures on both sides, which reflects his ideas of pure geometrical forms. A large open hall with a chandelier occupied the centre of the building. &quot;You can see,&quot; he wrote to Auguste Perret in July 1916, &quot;that Auguste Perret left more in me than Peter Behrens.&quot;

Le Corbusier&#x27;s grand ambitions collided with the ideas and budget of his client and led to bitter conflicts. Schwob went to court and denied Le Corbusier access to the site, or the right to claim to be the architect. Le Corbusier responded, &quot;Whether you like it or not, my presence is inscribed in every corner of your house.&quot; Le Corbusier took great pride in the house and reproduced pictures in several of his books.

==Painting, Cubism, Purism and &quot;L&#x27;Esprit Nouveau&quot; (1918–1922)==


Le Corbusier moved to Paris definitively in 1917 and began his architectural practise with his cousin, Pierre Jeanneret (1896–1967), a partnership that would last until the 1950s, with an interruption in the World War II years.

In 1918, Le Corbusier met the Cubist painter Amédée Ozenfant, in whom he recognised a kindred spirit. Ozenfant encouraged him to paint, and the two began a period of collaboration. Rejecting Cubism as irrational and &quot;romantic&quot;, the pair jointly published their manifesto, &quot;Après le Cubisme&quot; and established a new artistic movement, Purism. Ozenfant and Le Corbusier began writing for a new journal, &quot;L&#x27;Esprit Nouveau&quot;, and promoted with energy and imagination his ideas of architecture.

In the first issue of the journal, in 1920, Charles-Edouard Jeanneret adopted Le Corbusier (an altered form of his maternal grandfather&#x27;s name, Lecorbésier) as a pseudonym, reflecting his belief that anyone could reinvent themselves. Adopting a single name to identify oneself was in vogue by artists in many fields during that era, especially in Paris.

Between 1918 and 1922, Le Corbusier did not build anything, concentrating his efforts on Purist theory and painting. In 1922, he and his cousin Pierre Jeanneret opened a studio in Paris at 35 rue de Sèvres.
They set up an architectural practice together. From 1927 to 1937 they worked together with Charlotte Perriand at the Le Corbusier-Pierre Jeanneret studio. In 1929 the trio prepared the &quot;House fittings&quot; section for the Decorative Artists Exhibition and asked for a group stand, renewing and widening the 1928 avant-garde group idea. This was refused by the Decorative Artists Committee. They resigned and founded the Union of Modern Artists (&quot;Union des artistes modernes&quot;: UAM).

His theoretical studies soon advanced into several different single-family house models. Among these, was the Maison &quot;Citrohan.&quot; The project&#x27;s name was a reference to the French Citroën automaker, for the modern industrial methods and materials, Le Corbusier advocated using in the house&#x27;s construction as well as how he intended the homes would be consumed, similar to other commercial products, like the automobile.

As part of the Maison Citrohan model, Le Corbusier proposed a three-floor structure, with a double-height living room, bedrooms on the second floor, and a kitchen on the third floor. The roof would be occupied by a sun terrace. On the exterior, Le Corbusier installed a stairway to provide second-floor access from the ground level. Here, as in other projects from this period, he also designed the façades to include large uninterrupted banks of windows. The house used a rectangular plan, with exterior walls that were not filled by windows but left as white, stuccoed spaces. Le Corbusier and Jeanneret left the interior aesthetically spare, with any movable furniture made of tubular metal frames. Light fixtures usually comprised single, bare bulbs. Interior walls also were left white.

==&quot;Toward an Architecture&quot; (1920–1923)==
In 1922 and 1923, Le Corbusier devoted himself to advocating his new concepts of architecture and urban planning in a series of polemical articles published in &quot;L&#x27;Esprit Nouveau&quot;. At the Paris Salon d&#x27;Automne in 1922, he presented his plan for the Ville Contemporaine, a model city for three million people, whose residents would live and work in a group of identical sixty-story tall apartment buildings surrounded by lower zig-zag apartment blocks and a large park. In 1923, he collected his essays from &quot;L&#x27;Esprit Nouveau&quot; published his first and most influential book, &quot;Towards an Architecture&quot;. He presented his ideas for the future of architecture in a series of maxims, declarations, and exhortations, pronouncing that &quot;a grand epoch has just begun. There exists a new spirit. There already exist a crowd of works in the new spirit, they are found especially in industrial production. Architecture is suffocating in its current uses. &quot;Styles&quot; are a lie. Style is a unity of principles which animates all the work of a period and which result in a characteristic spirit...Our epoch determines each day its style..-Our eyes, unfortunately, don&#x27;t know how to see it yet,&quot; and his most famous maxim, &quot;A house is a machine to live in.&quot; Most of the many photographs and drawings in the book came from outside the world of traditional architecture; the cover showed the promenade deck of an ocean liner, while others showed racing cars, aeroplanes, factories, and the huge concrete and steel arches of zeppelin hangars.

==L&#x27;Esprit Nouveau Pavilion (1925)==

An important early work of Le Corbusier was the Esprit Nouveau Pavilion, built for the 1925 Paris International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts, the event which later gave Art Deco its name. Le Corbusier built the pavilion in collaboration with Amédée Ozenfant and with his cousin Pierre Jeanneret. Le Corbusier and Ozenfant had broken with Cubism and formed the Purism movement in 1918 and in 1920 founded their journal &quot;L&#x27;Esprit Nouveau&quot;. In his new journal, Le Corbusier vividly denounced the decorative arts: &quot;Decorative Art, as opposed to the machine phenomenon, is the final twitch of the old manual modes, a dying thing.&quot; To illustrate his ideas, he and Ozenfant decided to create a small pavilion at the Exposition, representing his idea of the future urban housing unit. A house, he wrote, &quot;is a cell within the body of a city. The cell is made up of the vital elements which are the mechanics of a house...Decorative art is antistandardizational. Our pavilion will contain only standard things created by industry in factories and mass-produced, objects truly of the style of today...my pavilion will therefore be a cell extracted from a huge apartment building.&quot;

Le Corbusier and his collaborators were given a plot of land located behind the Grand Palais in the centre of the Exposition. The plot was forested, and exhibitors could not cut down trees, so Le Corbusier built his pavilion with a tree in the centre, emerging through a hole in the roof. The building was a stark white box with an interior terrace and square glass windows. The interior was decorated with a few cubist paintings and a few pieces of mass-produced commercially available furniture, entirely different from the expensive one-of-a-kind pieces in the other pavilions. The chief organizers of the Exposition were furious and built a fence to partially hide the pavilion. Le Corbusier had to appeal to the Ministry of Fine Arts, which ordered that fence be taken down.

Besides the furniture, the pavilion exhibited a model of his &#x27;Plan Voisin&#x27;, his provocative plan for rebuilding a large part of the centre of Paris. He proposed to bulldoze a large area north of the Seine and replace the narrow streets, monuments and houses with giant sixty-story cruciform towers placed within an orthogonal street grid and park-like green space. His scheme was met with criticism and scorn from French politicians and industrialists, although they were favourable to the ideas of Taylorism and Fordism underlying his designs. The plan was never seriously considered, but it provoked discussion concerning how to deal with the overcrowded poor working-class neighbourhoods of Paris, and it later saw the partial realization in the housing developments built in the Paris suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s.

The Pavilion was ridiculed by many critics, but Le Corbusier, undaunted, wrote: &quot;Right now one thing is sure. 1925 marks the decisive turning point in the quarrel between the old and new. After 1925, the antique-lovers will have virtually ended their lives . . . Progress is achieved through experimentation; the decision will be awarded on the field of battle of the &#x27;new&#x27;.&quot;

==&quot;The Decorative Art of Today&quot; (1925)==
In 1925, Le Corbusier combined a series of articles about decorative art from &quot;L&#x27;Esprit Nouveau&quot; into a book, &quot;L&#x27;art décoratif d&#x27;aujourd&#x27;hui&quot; (&quot;The Decorative Art of Today&quot;). The book was a spirited attack on the very idea of decorative art. His basic premise, repeated throughout the book, was: &quot;Modern decorative art has no decoration.&quot; He attacked with enthusiasm the styles presented at the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts: &quot;The desire to decorate everything about one is a false spirit and an abominable small perversion...The religion of beautiful materials is in its final death agony...The almost hysterical onrush in recent years toward this quasi-orgy of decor is only the last spasm of a death already predictable.&quot; He cited the 1912 book of the Austrian architect Adolf Loos &quot;Ornament and crime&quot;, and quoted Loos&#x27;s dictum, &quot;The more a people are cultivated, the more decor disappears.&quot; He attacked the deco revival of classical styles, what he called &quot;Louis Philippe and Louis XVI moderne&quot;; he condemned the &quot;symphony of color&quot; at the Exposition, and called it &quot;the triumph of assemblers of colors and materials. They were swaggering in colors... They were making stews out of fine cuisine.&quot; He condemned the exotic styles presented at the Exposition based on the art of China, Japan, India and Persia. &quot;It takes energy today to affirm our western styles.&quot; He criticized the &quot;precious and useless objects that accumulated on the shelves&quot; in the new style. He attacked the &quot;rustling silks, the marbles which twist and turn, the vermilion whiplashes, the silver blades of Byzantium and the Orient...Let&#x27;s be done with it!&quot;

&quot;Why call bottles, chairs, baskets and objects decorative?&quot; Le Corbusier asked. &quot;They are useful tools...The decor is not necessary. Art is necessary.&quot; He declared that in the future the decorative arts industry would produce only &quot;objects which are perfectly useful, convenient, and have a true luxury which pleases our spirit by their elegance and the purity of their execution and the efficiency of their services. This rational perfection and precise determinate creates the link sufficient to recognize a style.&quot; He described the future of decoration in these terms: &quot;The idea is to go work in the superb office of a modern factory, rectangular and well-lit, painted in white Ripolin (a major French paint manufacturer); where healthy activity and laborious optimism reign.&quot; He concluded by repeating &quot;Modern decoration has no decoration&quot;.

The book became a manifesto for those who opposed the more traditional styles of the decorative arts; In the 1930s, as Le Corbusier predicted, the modernized versions of Louis Philippe and Louis XVI furniture and the brightly coloured wallpapers of stylized roses were replaced by a more sober, more streamlined style. Gradually the modernism and functionality proposed by Le Corbusier overtook the more ornamental style. The shorthand titles that Le Corbusier used in the book, &quot;1925 Expo: Arts Deco&quot; were adapted in 1966 by the art historian Bevis Hillier for a catalogue of an exhibition on the style, and in 1968 in the title of a book, &quot;Art Deco of the 20s and 30s&quot;. And thereafter the term &quot;Art Deco&quot; was commonly used as the name of the style.

==Five Points of Architecture to Villa Savoye (1923–1931)==

The notoriety that Le Corbusier achieved from his writings and the Pavilion at the 1925 Exposition led to commissions to build a dozen residences in Paris and the Paris region in his &quot;purist style.&quot; These included the Maison La Roche/Albert Jeanneret (1923–1925), which now houses the Fondation Le Corbusier; the Maison Guiette in Antwerp, Belgium (1926); a residence for Jacques Lipchitz; the Maison Cook, and the Maison Planeix. In 1927, he was invited by the German Werkbund to build three houses in the model city of Weissenhof near Stuttgart, based on the Citroen House and other theoretical models he had published. He described this project in detail in one of his best-known essays, the &quot;Five Points of Architecture&quot;.

The following year he began the Villa Savoye (1928–1931), which became one of the most famous of Le Corbusier&#x27;s works, and an icon of modernist architecture. Located in Poissy, in a landscape surrounded by trees and a large lawn, the house is an elegant white box poised on rows of slender pylons, surrounded by a horizontal band of windows which fill the structure with light. The service areas (parking, rooms for servants and laundry room) are located under the house. Visitors enter a vestibule from which a gentle ramp leads to the house itself. The bedrooms and salons of the house are distributed around a suspended garden; the rooms look both out at the landscape and into the garden, which provides additional light and air. Another ramp leads up to the roof, and a stairway leads down to the cellar under the pillars.

Villa Savoye succinctly summed up the five points of architecture that he had elucidated in &quot;L&#x27;Esprit Nouveau&quot; and the book &quot;Vers une architecture&quot;, which he had been developing throughout the 1920s. First, Le Corbusier lifted the bulk of the structure off the ground, supporting it by &quot;pilotis&quot;, reinforced concrete stilts. These &quot;pilotis&quot;, in providing the structural support for the house, allowed him to elucidate his next two points: a free façade, meaning non-supporting walls that could be designed as the architect wished, and an open floor plan, meaning that the floor space was free to be configured into rooms without concern for supporting walls. The second floor of the Villa Savoye includes long strips of ribbon windows that allow unencumbered views of the large surrounding garden, which constitute the fourth point of his system. The fifth point was the roof garden to compensate for the green area consumed by the building and replace it on the roof. A ramp rising from ground level to the third-floor roof terrace allows for a promenade architecturale through the structure. The white tubular railing recalls the industrial &quot;ocean-liner&quot; aesthetic that Le Corbusier much admired.

Le Corbusier was quite rhapsodic when describing the house in &quot;Précisions&quot; in 1930: &quot;the plan is pure, exactly made for the needs of the house. It has its correct place in the rustic landscape of Poissy. It is Poetry and lyricism, supported by technique.&quot; The house had its problems; the roof persistently leaked, due to construction faults; but it became a landmark of modern architecture and one of the best-known works of Le Corbusier.

==Le Corbusier’s Palette==
His color theory, published in 1931. In it, he introduced his concept and a carefully selected palette of 43 colors intended for specific architectural contexts, and in 1959, he expanded it with 20 new shades, bringing the total number of colors to 63.

== League of Nations Competition and Pessac Housing Project (1926–1930) ==

Thanks to his passionate articles in L&#x27;Esprit Nouveau, his participation in the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition and the conferences he gave on the new spirit of architecture, Le Corbusier had become well known in the architectural world, though he had only built residences for wealthy clients. In 1926, he entered the competition for the construction of a headquarters for the League of Nations in Geneva with a plan for an innovative lakeside complex of modernist white concrete office buildings and meeting halls. There were 337 projects in competition. It appeared that the Corbusier&#x27;s project was the first choice of the architectural jury, but after much behind-the-scenes manoeuvring, the jury declared it was unable to pick a single winner, and the project was given instead to the top five architects, who were all neoclassicists. Le Corbusier was not discouraged; he presented his plans to the public in articles and lectures to show the opportunity that the League of Nations had missed.

=== The &quot;Cité Frugès&quot; ===
In 1926, Le Corbusier received the opportunity he had been looking for; he was commissioned by a Bordeaux industrialist, Henry Frugès, a fervent admirer of his ideas on urban planning, to build a complex of worker housing, the Cité Frugès, at Pessac, a suburb of Bordeaux. Le Corbusier described Pessac as &quot;A little like a Balzac novel&quot;, a chance to create a whole community for living and working. The Fruges quarter became his first laboratory for residential housing; a series of rectangular blocks composed of modular housing units located in a garden setting. Like the unit displayed at the 1925 Exposition, each housing unit had its own small terrace. The earlier villas he constructed all had white exterior walls, but for Pessac, at the request of his clients, he added colour; panels of brown, yellow and jade green, coordinated by Le Corbusier. Originally planned to have some two hundred units, it finally contained about fifty to seventy housing units, in eight buildings. Pessac became the model on a small scale for his later and much larger Cité Radieuse projects.

==Founding of CIAM (1928) and Athens Charter==
In 1928, Le Corbusier took a major step toward establishing modernist architecture as the dominant European style. Le Corbusier had met with many of the leading German and Austrian modernists during the competition for the League of Nations in 1927. In the same year, the German Werkbund organized an architectural exposition at the Weissenhof Estate Stuttgart. Seventeen leading modernist architects in Europe were invited to design twenty-one houses; Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe played a major part. In 1927 Le Corbusier, Pierre Chareau and others proposed the foundation of an international conference to establish the basis for a common style. The first meeting of the &quot;Congrès Internationaux d&#x27;Architecture Moderne&quot; or International Congresses of Modern Architects (CIAM), was held in a château on Lake Leman in Switzerland 26–28 June 1928. Those attending included Le Corbusier, Robert Mallet-Stevens, Auguste Perret, Pierre Chareau and Tony Garnier from France; Victor Bourgeois from Belgium; Walter Gropius, Erich Mendelsohn, Ernst May and Mies van der Rohe from Germany; Josef Frank from Austria; Mart Stam and Gerrit Rietveld from the Netherlands, and Adolf Loos from Czechoslovakia. A delegation of Soviet architects was invited to attend, but they were unable to obtain visas. Later members included Josep Lluís Sert of Spain and Alvar Aalto of Finland. No one attended from the United States. A second meeting was organized in 1930 in Brussels by Victor Bourgeois on the topic &quot;Rational methods for groups of habitations&quot;. A third meeting, on &quot;The functional city&quot;, was scheduled for Moscow in 1932, but was cancelled at the last minute. Instead, the delegates held their meeting on a cruise ship travelling between Marseille and Athens. On board, they together drafted a text on how modern cities should be organized. The text, called The Athens Charter, after considerable editing by Le Corbusier and others, was finally published in 1943 and became an influential text for city planners in the 1950s and 1960s. The group met once more in Paris in 1937 to discuss public housing and was scheduled to meet in the United States in 1939, but the meeting was cancelled because of the war. The legacy of the CIAM was a roughly common style and doctrine which helped define modern architecture in Europe and the United States after World War II.

==Projects (1928–1963)==
===Moscow projects (1928–1934)===

Le Corbusier saw the new society founded in the Soviet Union after the Russian Revolution as a promising laboratory for his architectural ideas. He met the Russian architect Konstantin Melnikov during the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition in Paris, and admired the construction of Melnikov&#x27;s constructivist USSR pavilion, the only truly modernist building in the Exposition other than his own Esprit Nouveau pavilion. At Melnikov&#x27;s invitation, he travelled to Moscow, where he found that his writings had been published in Russian; he gave lectures and interviews and between 1928 and 1932 he constructed an office building for the Tsentrosoyuz, the headquarters of Soviet trade unions.

In 1932, he was invited to take part in an international competition for the new Palace of the Soviets in Moscow, which was to be built on the site of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, demolished on Stalin&#x27;s orders. Le Corbusier contributed a highly original plan, a low-level complex of circular and rectangular buildings and a rainbow-like arch from which the roof of the main meeting hall was suspended. To Le Corbusier&#x27;s distress, his plan was rejected by Stalin in favour of a plan for a massive neoclassical tower, the highest in Europe, crowned with a statue of Vladimir Lenin. The Palace was never built; construction was stopped by World War II, a swimming pool took its place, and after the collapse of the USSR the cathedral was rebuilt on its original site.

===Cité Universitaire, Immeuble Clarté and Cité de Refuge (1928–1933)===

Between 1928 and 1934, as Le Corbusier&#x27;s reputation grew, he received commissions to construct a wide variety of buildings. In 1928 he received a commission from the Soviet government to construct the headquarters of the Tsentrosoyuz, or central office of trade unions, a large office building whose glass walls alternated with plaques of stone. He built the Villa de Madrot in Le Pradet (1929–1931); and an apartment in Paris for Charles de Bestigui at the top of an existing building on the Champs-Élysées 1929–1932, (later demolished). In 1929–1930 he constructed a floating homeless shelter for the Salvation Army on the left bank of the Seine at the Pont d&#x27;Austerlitz. Between 1929 and 1933, he built a larger and more ambitious project for the Salvation Army, the Cité de Refuge, on rue Cantagrel in the 13th arrondissement of Paris. He also constructed the Swiss Pavilion in the Cité Universitaire in Paris with 46 units of student housing, (1929–33). He designed furniture to go with the building; the main salon was decorated with a montage of black-and-white photographs of nature. In 1948, he replaced this with a colourful mural he painted himself. In Geneva, he built a glass-walled apartment building with 45 units, the Immeuble Clarté. Between 1931 and 1945 he built an apartment building with fifteen units, including an apartment and studio for himself on the 6th and 7th floors, at 24 rue Nungesser-et-Coli in the 16th arrondissement in Paris. overlooking the Bois de Boulogne. His apartment and studio are owned today by the Fondation Le Corbusier and can be visited.

===Ville Contemporaine, Plan Voisin and Cité Radieuse (1922–1939)===

As the global Great Depression enveloped Europe, Le Corbusier devoted more and more time to his ideas for urban design and planned cities. He believed that his new, modern architectural forms would provide an organizational solution that would raise the quality of life for the working classes. In 1922 he had presented his model of the Ville Contemporaine, a city of three million inhabitants, at the Salon d&#x27;Automne in Paris. His plan featured tall office towers surrounded by lower residential blocks in a park setting. He reported that &quot;analysis leads to such dimensions, to such a new scale, and to such the creation of an urban organism so different from those that exist, that it that the mind can hardly imagine it.&quot; The Ville Contemporaine, presenting an imaginary city in an imaginary location, did not attract the attention that Le Corbusier wanted. For his next proposal, the Plan Voisin (1925), he took a much more provocative approach; he proposed to demolish a large part of central Paris and replace it with a group of sixty-story cruciform office towers surrounded by parkland. This idea shocked most viewers, as it was certainly intended to do. The plan included a multi-level transportation hub that included depots for buses and trains, as well as highway intersections, and an airport. Le Corbusier had the fanciful notion that commercial airliners would land between the huge skyscrapers. He segregated pedestrian circulation paths from the roadways and created an elaborate road network. Groups of lower-rise zigzag apartment blocks, set back from the street, were interspersed among the office towers. Le Corbusier wrote: &quot;The centre of Paris, currently threatened with death, threatened by exodus, is, in reality, a diamond mine...To abandon the centre of Paris to its fate is to desert in face of the enemy.&quot;

As no doubt Le Corbusier expected, no one hurried to implement the Plan Voisin, but he continued working on variations of the idea and recruiting followers. In 1929, he travelled to Brazil where he gave conferences on his architectural ideas. He returned with drawings of his vision for Rio de Janeiro; he sketched serpentine multi-story apartment buildings on pylons, like inhabited highways, winding through Rio de Janeiro.

In 1931, he developed a visionary plan for another city Algiers, then part of France. This plan, like his Rio Janeiro plan, called for the construction of an elevated viaduct of concrete, carrying residential units, which would run from one end of the city to the other. This plan, unlike his early Plan Voisin, was more conservative, because it did not call for the destruction of the old city of Algiers; the residential housing would be over the top of the old city. This plan, like his Paris plans, provoked discussion but never came close to realization.

In 1935, Le Corbusier made his first visit to the United States. He was asked by American journalists what he thought about New York City skyscrapers; he responded, characteristically, that he found them &quot;much too small&quot;. He wrote a book describing his experiences in the States, &quot;Quand Les cathédrales étaient blanches, Voyage au pays des timides&quot; (When Cathedrals were White; voyage to the land of the timid) whose title expressed his view of the lack of boldness in American architecture.

He wrote a great deal but built very little in the late 1930s. The titles of his books expressed the combined urgency and optimism of his messages: &quot;Cannons? Munitions? No thank you, Lodging please!&quot; (1938) and &quot;The lyricism of modern times and urbanism&quot; (1939).

In 1928, the French Minister of Labour, Louis Loucheur, won the passage of French law on public housing, calling for the construction of 260,000 new housing units within five years. Le Corbusier immediately began to design a new type of modular housing unit, which he called the Maison Loucheur, which would be suitable for the project. These units were in size, made with metal frames, and were designed to be mass-produced and then transported to the site, where they would be inserted into frameworks of steel and stone; The government insisted on stone walls to win the support of local building contractors. The standardisation of apartment buildings was the essence of what Le Corbusier termed the &quot;Ville Radieuse&quot; or &quot;radiant city&quot;, in a new book published in 1935. The Radiant City was similar to his earlier Contemporary City and Plan Voisin, with the difference that residences would be assigned by family size, rather than by income and social position. In his 1935 book, he developed his ideas for a new kind of city, where the principal functions; heavy industry, manufacturing, habitation and commerce, would be separated into their neighbourhoods, carefully planned and designed. However, before any units could be built, World War II intervened.

===World War II and Reconstruction; &quot;Unité d&#x27;Habitation&quot; in Marseille (1939–1952)===

During the War and the German occupation of France, Le Corbusier did his best to promote his architectural projects. He moved to Vichy for a time, where the collaborationist government of Marshal Philippe Petain was located, offering his services for architectural projects, including his plan for the reconstruction of Algiers, but they were rejected. He continued writing, completing &quot;Sur les Quatres routes&quot; (On the Four Routes) in 1941. After 1942 Le Corbusier left Vichy for Paris. He became for a time a technical adviser at Alexis Carrel&#x27;s eugenics foundation but resigned on 20 April 1944. In 1943 he founded a new association of modern architects and builders, the Ascoral, the Assembly of Constructors for a renewal of architecture, but there were no projects to build.

When the war ended Le Corbusier was nearly sixty years old and he had not had a single project realized for ten years. He tried, without success, to obtain commissions for several of the first large reconstruction projects, but his proposals for the reconstruction of the town of Saint-Dié and for La Rochelle were rejected. Still, he persisted and finally found a willing partner in Raoul Dautry, the new Minister of Reconstruction and Town Planning. Dautry agreed to fund one of his projects, a &quot;Unité habitation de grandeur conforme&quot;, or housing units of standard size, with the first one to be built in Marseille, which had been heavily damaged during the war.

This was his first public commission and was a breakthrough for Le Corbusier. He gave the building the name of his pre-war theoretical project, the &quot;Cité Radieuse&quot;, and followed the principles that he had studied before the war, proposing a giant reinforced-concrete framework into which modular apartments would fit like bottles into a bottle rack. Like the Villa Savoye, the structure was poised on concrete pylons though, because of the shortage of steel to reinforce the concrete, the pylons were more massive than usual. The building contained 337 duplex apartment modules to house a total of 1,600 people. Each module was three storeys high and contained two apartments, combined so each had two levels (see diagram above). The modules ran from one side of the building to the other and each apartment had a small terrace at each end. They were ingeniously fitted together like pieces of a Chinese puzzle, with a corridor slotted through the space between the two apartments in each module. Residents had a choice of twenty-three different configurations for the units. Le Corbusier designed furniture, carpets and lamps to go with the building, all purely functional; the only decoration was a choice of interior colours. The only mildly decorative features of the building were the ventilator shafts on the roof, which Le Corbusier made to look like the smokestacks of an ocean liner, a functional form that he admired.

The building was designed not just to be a residence but to offer all the services needed for living. On every third floor, between the modules, there was a wide corridor, like an interior street, which ran the length of the building. This served as a sort of commercial street, with shops, eating places, a nursery school and recreational facilities. A running track and small stage for theatre performances were located on the roof. The building itself was surrounded by trees and a small park.

Le Corbusier wrote later that the &quot;Unité d&#x27;Habitation&quot; concept was inspired by the visit he had made to the Florence Charterhouse at Galluzzo in Italy, in 1907 and 1910 during his early travels. He wanted to recreate, he wrote, an ideal place &quot;for meditation and contemplation&quot;. He also learned from the monastery, he wrote, that &quot;standardization led to perfection&quot;, and that &quot;all of his life a man labours under this impulse: to make the home the temple of the family&quot;.

The &quot;Unité d&#x27;Habitation&quot; marked a turning point in the career of Le Corbusier; in 1952, he was made a Commander of the Légion d&#x27;Honneur in a ceremony held on the roof of his new building. He had progressed from being an outsider and critic of the architectural establishment to its centre, as the most prominent French architect.

===Postwar projects, United Nations headquarters (1947–1952)===

Le Corbusier made another almost identical Unité d&#x27;Habitation in Rezé-les-Nantes in the Loire-Atlantique Department between 1948 and 1952, and three more over the following years, in Berlin, Briey-en-Forêt and Firminy; and he designed a factory for the company of Claude and Duval, in Saint-Dié in the Vosges. In the post-Second World War decades, Le Corbusier&#x27;s fame moved beyond architectural and planning circles as he became one of the leading intellectual figures of the time.

In early 1947 Le Corbusier submitted a design for the headquarters of the United Nations, which was to be built beside the East River in New York. Instead of competition, the design was to be selected by a Board of Design Consultants composed of leading international architects nominated by member governments, including Le Corbusier, Oscar Niemeyer of Brazil, Howard Robertson from Britain, Nikolai Bassov of the Soviet Union, and five others from around the world. The committee was under the direction of the American architect Wallace K. Harrison, who was also the architect for the Rockefeller family, which had donated the site for the building.

Le Corbusier had submitted his plan for the Secretariat, called Plan 23 of the 58 submitted. In Le Corbusier&#x27;s plan offices, council chambers and General Assembly Hall were in a single block in the centre of the site. He lobbied hard for his project, and asked the younger Brazilian architect, Niemeyer, to support and assist him with his plan. Niemeyer, to help Le Corbusier, refused to submit his design and did not attend the meetings until the Director, Harrison, insisted. Niemeyer then submitted his plan, Plan 32, with the office building and councils and General Assembly in separate buildings. After much discussion, the Committee chose Niemeyer&#x27;s plan but suggested that he collaborate with Le Corbusier on the final project. Le Corbusier urged Niemeyer to put the General Assembly Hall in the centre of the site, though this would eliminate Niemeyer&#x27;s plan to have a large plaza in the centre. Niemeyer agreed with Le Corbusier&#x27;s suggestion, and the headquarters was built, with minor modifications, according to their joint plan.

===Religious architecture (1950–63)===

Le Corbusier was an avowed atheist, but he also had a strong belief in the ability of architecture to create a sacred and spiritual environment. In the postwar years, he designed two important religious buildings; the chapel of Notre-Dame-du-Haut at Ronchamp (1950–1955); and the Convent of Sainte Marie de La Tourette (1953–1960). Le Corbusier wrote later that he was greatly aided in his religious architecture by a Dominican father, Marie-Alain Couturier, who had founded a movement and review of modern religious art.

Le Corbusier first visited the remote mountain site of Ronchamp in May 1950, saw the ruins of the old chapel, and drew sketches of possible forms. He wrote afterwards: &quot;In building this chapel, I wanted to create a place of silence, of peace, of prayer, of interior joy. The feeling of the sacred animated our effort. Some things are sacred, others aren&#x27;t, whether they&#x27;re religious or not.&quot;

The second major religious project undertaken by Le Corbusier was the Convent of Sainte Marie de La Tourette in L&#x27;Arbresle in the Rhone Department (1953–1960). Once again it was Father Couturier who engaged Le Corbusier in the project. He invited Le Corbusier to visit the starkly simple and imposing 12th–13th century Le Thoronet Abbey in Provence, and also used his memories of his youthful visit to the Erna Charterhouse in Florence. This project involved not only a chapel, but a library, refectory, rooms for meetings and reflection, and dormitories for the nuns. For the living space he used the same Modulor concept for measuring the ideal living space that he had used in the Unité d&#x27;Habitation in Marseille; height under the ceiling of ; and width .

Le Corbusier used raw concrete to construct the convent, which is placed on the side of a hill. The three blocks of dormitories are U, closed by the chapel, with a courtyard in the centre. The Convent has a flat roof and is placed on sculpted concrete pillars. Each of the residential cells has a small loggia with a concrete sunscreen looking out at the countryside. The centrepiece of the convent is the chapel, a plain box of concrete, which he called his &quot;Box of miracles.&quot; Unlike the highly finished façade of the Unité d&#x27;Habitation, the façade of the chapel is raw, unfinished concrete. He described the building in a letter to Albert Camus in 1957: &quot;I&#x27;m taken with the idea of a &quot;box of miracles&quot;...as the name indicates, it is a rectangular box made of concrete. It doesn&#x27;t have any of the traditional theatrical tricks, but the possibility, as its name suggests, to make miracles.&quot; The interior of the chapel is extremely simple, only benches in a plain, unfinished concrete box, with light coming through a single square in the roof and six small bands on the sides. The Crypt beneath has intense blue, red and yellow walls, and illumination by sunlight channelled from above. The monastery has other unusual features, including floor to ceiling panels of glass in the meeting rooms, window panels that fragmented the view into pieces, and a system of concrete and metal tubes like gun barrels which aimed sunlight through coloured prisms and projected it onto the walls of the sacristy and to the secondary altars of the crypt on the level below. These were whimsically termed the &quot;&quot;machine guns&quot; of the sacristy and the &quot;light cannons&quot; of the crypt.

In 1960, Le Corbusier began a third religious building, the Church of Saint Pierre in the new town of Firminy-Vert, where he had built a Unité d&#x27;Habitation and a cultural and sports centre. While he made the original design, construction did not begin until five years after his death, and work continued under different architects until it was completed in 2006. The most spectacular feature of the church is the sloping concrete tower that covers the entire interior, similar to that in the Assembly Building in his complex at Chandigarh. Windows high in the tower illuminates the interior. Le Corbusier originally proposed that tiny windows also project the form of a constellation on the walls. Later architects designed the church to project the constellation Orion.

===Chandigarh (1951–1956)===

Le Corbusier&#x27;s largest and most ambitious project was the design of Chandigarh, the capital city of the Punjab and Haryana States of India, created after India received independence in 1947. Le Corbusier was contacted in 1950 by Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, and invited to propose a project. An American architect, Albert Mayer, had made a plan in 1947 for a city of 150,000 inhabitants, but the Indian government wanted a grander and more monumental city. Corbusier worked on the plan with two British specialists in urban design and tropical climate architecture, Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew, and with his cousin, Pierre Jeanneret, who moved to India and supervised the construction until his death.

Le Corbusier, as always, was rhapsodic about his project; &quot;It will be a city of trees,&quot; he wrote, &quot;of flowers and water, of houses as simple as those at the time of Homer, and of a few splendid edifices of the highest level of modernism, where the rules of mathematics will reign.&quot; His plan called for residential, commercial and industrial areas, along with parks and transportation infrastructure. In the middle was the capitol, a complex of four major government buildings; the Palace of the National Assembly, the High Court of Justice; the Palace of Secretariat of Ministers, and the Palace of the Governor. For financial and political reasons, the Palace of the Governor was dropped well into the construction of the city, throwing the final project somewhat off-balance. From the beginning, Le Corbusier worked, as he reported, &quot;Like a forced labourer.&quot; He dismissed the earlier American plan as &quot;Faux-Moderne&quot; and overly filled with parking spaces and roads. He intended to present what he had learned in forty years of urban study, and also to show the French government the opportunities they had missed in not choosing him to rebuild French cities after the War. His design made use of many of his favourite ideas: an architectural promenade, incorporating the local landscape and the sunlight and shadows into the design; the use of the Modulor to give a correct human scale to each element somewhat based on the proportions of the human body; and his favourite symbol, the open hand (&quot;The hand is open to give and to receive&quot;). He placed a monumental open hand statue in a prominent place in the design.

Le Corbusier&#x27;s design called for the use of raw concrete, whose surface was not smoothed or polished and which showed the marks of the forms in which it dried. Pierre Jeanneret wrote to his cousin that he was in a continual battle with the construction workers, who could not resist the urge to smooth and finish the raw concrete, particularly when important visitors were coming to the site. At one point one thousand workers were employed on the site of the High Court of Justice. Le Corbusier wrote to his mother, &quot;It is an architectural symphony which surpasses all my hopes, which flashes and develops under the light in a way which is unimaginable and unforgettable. From far, from up close, it provokes astonishment; all made with raw concrete and a cement cannon. Adorable, and grandiose. In all the centuries no one has seen that.&quot;

The High Court of Justice, begun in 1951, was finished in 1956. The building was radical in its design; a parallelogram topped with an inverted parasol. Along the walls were high concrete grills thick which served as sunshades. The entry featured a monumental ramp and columns that allowed the air to circulate. The pillars were originally white limestone, but in the 1960s they were repainted in bright colours, which better resisted the weather.

The Secretariat, the largest building that housed the government offices, was constructed between 1952 and 1958. It is an enormous block long and eight levels high, served by a ramp which extends from the ground to the top level. The ramp was designed to be partly sculptural and partly practical. Since there were no modern building cranes at the time of construction, the ramp was the only way to get materials to the top of the construction site. The Secretariat had two features which were borrowed from his design for the Unité d&#x27;Habitation in Marseille: concrete grill sunscreens over the windows and a roof terrace.

The most important building of the capitol complex was the Palace of Assembly (1952–61), which faced the High Court at the other end of a esplanade with a large reflecting pool in the front. This building features a central courtyard, over which is the main meeting hall for the Assembly. On the roof on the rear of the building is a signature feature of Le Corbusier, a large tower, similar in form to the smokestack of a ship or the ventilation tower of a heating plant. Le Corbusier added touches of colour and texture with an immense tapestry in the meeting hall and a large gateway decorated with enamel. He wrote of this building, &quot;A Palace magnificent in its effect, from the new art of raw concrete. It is magnificent and terrible; terrible meaning that there is nothing cold about it to the eyes.&quot;

==Later life and work (1955–1965)==

The 1950s and 1960s were a difficult period for Le Corbusier&#x27;s personal life: his wife Yvonne died in 1957 and his mother, to whom he was closely attached, died in 1960. He remained active in a wide variety of fields: in 1955 he published &quot;Poéme de l&#x27;angle droit&quot;, a portfolio of lithographs, published in the same collection as the book &quot;Jazz&quot; by Henri Matisse. In 1958 he collaborated with the composer Edgar Varèse on a work called &quot;Le Poème électronique&quot;, a show of sound and light, for the Philips Pavilion at the International Exposition in Brussels. In 1960 he published a new book, &quot;L&#x27;Atelier de la recherché patiente&quot; &quot;The workshop of patient research&quot;), simultaneously published in four languages. He received growing recognition for his pioneering work in modernist architecture: in 1959 a successful international campaign was launched to have his Villa Savoye, threatened with demolition, declared a historic monument; it was the first time that a work by a living architect had received this distinction. In 1962, in the same year as the dedication of the Palace of the Assembly in Chandigarh, the first retrospective exhibit on his work was held at the National Museum of Modern Art in Paris. In 1964, in a ceremony held in his atelier on rue de Sèvres, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Légion d&#x27;honneur by Culture Minister André Malraux.

His later architectural work was extremely varied and often based on designs of earlier projects. In 1952–1958 he designed a series of tiny holiday cabins, in size, for a site next to the Mediterranean at Roquebrune-Cap-Martin. He built a similar cabin for himself but the rest of the project was not realized until after his death. From 1953–to 1957 he designed the Maison du Brésil, a residential building for Brazilian students for the Cité Universitaire in Paris. Between 1954 and 1959 he built the National Museum of Western Art in Tokyo. His other projects included a cultural centre and stadium for the town of Firminy, where he had built his first housing project (1955–1958), and a stadium in Baghdad, Iraq (much altered since its construction). He also constructed three new &quot;Unités d&#x27;Habitation&quot; apartment blocks on the model of the original in Marseille, the first in Berlin (1956–1958), the second in Briey-en-Forêt in the Meurthe-et-Moselle Department and the third (1959–1967) in Firminy. From 1960–to 1963 he built his only building in the United States, the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Jørn Utzon, the architect of the Sydney Opera House, commissioned Le Corbusier to create furnishings for the nascent opera house. Le Corbusier designed a tapestry, &quot;Les Dés Sont Jetés&quot;, which was completed in 1960.

Le Corbusier died of a heart attack at age 77 in 1965 after swimming on the French Riviera. At the time of his death several projects were on the drawing board: the church of Saint-Pierre in Firminy, finally completed in modified form in 2006, a Palace of Congresses for Strasbourg (1962–65) and a hospital in Venice (1961–1965), which were never built. Le Corbusier designed an art gallery beside the lake in Zürich for gallery owner Heidi Weber in 1962–1967. Now called the Centre Le Corbusier, it is one of his last finished works.

==Ideas==
===&quot;The Five Points of a Modern Architecture&quot;===
Le Corbusier defined the principles of his new architecture in &quot;Les cinq points de l&#x27;architecture moderne&quot;, published in 1927, and co-authored by his cousin, Pierre Jeanneret. They summarized the lessons he had learned in the previous years, which he put literally into concrete form in his villas constructed in the late 1920s, most dramatically in the Villa Savoye (1928–1931).

The five points are:
* The Pilotis, or pylon. The building is raised on reinforced concrete pylons, which allows for free circulation on the ground level, and eliminates dark and damp parts of the house.
* The Roof Terrace. The sloping roof is replaced by a flat roof; the roof can be used as a garden, for promenades, for sports or a swimming pool.
* The Free Plan. Load-bearing walls are replaced by steel or reinforced concrete columns, so the interior can be freely designed, and interior walls can be put anywhere, or left out entirely. The structure of the building is not visible from the outside.
* The Ribbon Window. Since the walls do not support the house, the windows can run the entire length of the house, so all rooms can get equal light.
* The Free Façade. Since the building is supported by columns in the interior, the façade can be much lighter and more open or made entirely of glass. There is no need for lintels or other structures around the windows.

===&quot;Architectural Promenade&quot;===
The &quot;Architectural Promenade&quot; was another idea dear to Le Corbusier, which he particularly put into play in his design of the Villa Savoye. In 1928, in &quot;Une Maison, un Palais&quot;, he described it: &quot;Arab architecture gives us a precious lesson: it is best appreciated in walking, on foot. It is in walking, in going from one place to another, that you see develop the features of the architecture. In this house (Villa Savoye) you find a veritable architectural promenade, offering constantly varying aspects, unexpected, sometimes astonishing.&quot; The promenade at Villa Savoye, Le Corbusier wrote, both in the interior of the house and on the roof terrace, often erased the traditional difference between the inside and outside.

===&quot;Ville Radieuse&quot; and Urbanism===
In the 1930s, Le Corbusier expanded and reformulated his ideas on urbanism, eventually publishing them in &quot;La Ville radieuse&quot; (The Radiant City) in 1935. Perhaps the most significant difference between the Contemporary City and the Radiant City is that the latter abandoned the class-based stratification of the former; housing was now assigned according to family size, not economic position. Some have read dark overtones into &quot;The Radiant City&quot;: from the &quot;astonishingly beautiful assemblage of buildings&quot; that was Stockholm, for example, Le Corbusier saw only &quot;frightening chaos and saddening monotony.&quot; He dreamed of &quot;cleaning and purging&quot; the city, bringing &quot;a calm and powerful architecture&quot;—referring to steel, plate glass, and reinforced concrete. Although Le Corbusier&#x27;s designs for Stockholm did not succeed, later architects took his ideas and partly &quot;destroyed&quot; the city with them.

Le Corbusier hoped that politically minded industrialists in France would lead the way with their efficient Taylorist and Fordist strategies adopted from American industrial models to reorganize society. As Norma Evenson has put it, &quot;the proposed city appeared to some an audacious and compelling vision of a brave new world, and to others, a frigid megalomaniacally scaled negation of the familiar urban ambient.&quot;

Le Corbusier &quot;His ideas—his urban planning and his architecture—are viewed separately,&quot; Perelman noted, &quot;whereas they are the same thing.&quot;

In &quot;La Ville radieuse&quot;, he conceived an essentially apolitical society, in which the bureaucracy of economic administration effectively replaces the state.

Le Corbusier was heavily indebted to the thought of the 19th-century French utopians Saint-Simon and Charles Fourier. There is a noteworthy resemblance between the concept of the unité and Fourier&#x27;s phalanstery. From Fourier, Le Corbusier adopted at least in part his notion of administrative, rather than political, government.

===Modulor===
The Modulor was a standard model of the human form which Le Corbusier devised to determine the correct amount of living space needed for residents in his buildings. It was also his rather original way of dealing with differences between the metric system and the British or American system since the Modulor was not attached to either one.

Le Corbusier explicitly used the golden ratio in his Modulor system for the scale of architectural proportion. He saw this system as a continuation of the long tradition of Vitruvius, Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot;, the work of Leon Battista Alberti, and others who used the proportions of the human body to improve the appearance and function of architecture. In addition to the golden ratio, Le Corbusier based the system on human measurements, Fibonacci numbers, and the double unit. Many scholars see the Modulor as a humanistic expression but it is also argued that: &quot;It&#x27;s exactly the opposite (...) It&#x27;s the mathematization of the body, the standardization of the body, the rationalization of the body.&quot;

He took Leonardo&#x27;s suggestion of the golden ratio in human proportions to an extreme: he sectioned his model human body&#x27;s height at the navel with the two sections in golden ratio, then subdivided those sections in golden ratio at the knees and throat; he used these golden ratio proportions in the Modulor system.

Le Corbusier&#x27;s 1927 Villa Stein in Garches exemplified the Modulor system&#x27;s application. The villa&#x27;s rectangular ground plan, elevation, and inner structure closely approximate golden rectangles.

Le Corbusier placed systems of harmony and proportion at the centre of his design philosophy, and his faith in the mathematical order of the universe was closely bound to the golden section and the Fibonacci series, which he described as &quot;rhythms apparent to the eye and clear in their relations with one another. And these rhythms are at the very root of human activities. They resound in Man by an organic inevitability, the same fine inevitability which causes the tracing out of the Golden Section by children, old men, savages, and the learned.&quot;

===Open Hand===
The Open Hand (La Main Ouverte) is a recurring motif in Le Corbusier&#x27;s architecture, a sign for him of &quot;peace and reconciliation. It is open to give and open to receive.&quot; The largest of the many Open Hand sculptures that Le Corbusier created is a version in Chandigarh, India, known as &quot;Open Hand Monument&quot;.

==Furniture==
Le Corbusier was an eloquent critic of the finely crafted, hand-made furniture, made with rare and exotic woods, inlays and coverings, presented at the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts. Following his usual method, Le Corbusier first wrote a book with his theories of furniture, complete with memorable slogans. In his 1925 book &quot;L&#x27;Art Décoratif d&#x27;aujourd&#x27;hui&quot;, he called for furniture that used inexpensive materials and could be mass-produced. Le Corbusier described three different furniture types: &quot;type-needs&quot;, &quot;type-furniture&quot;, and &quot;human-limb objects&quot;. He defined human-limb objects as: &quot;Extensions of our limbs and adapted to human functions that are type-needs and type-functions, therefore type-objects and type-furniture. The human-limb object is a docile servant. A good servant is discreet and self-effacing to leave his master free. Certainly, works of art are tools, beautiful tools. And long live the good taste manifested by choice, subtlety, proportion, and harmony&quot;. He further declared: &quot;Chairs are architecture, sofas are bourgeois&quot;.

Le Corbusier first relied on ready-made furniture from Thonet to furnish his projects, such as his pavilion at the 1925 Exposition. In 1928, following the publication of his theories, he began experimenting with furniture design. In 1928, he invited the architect Charlotte Perriand to join his studio as a furniture designer. His cousin, Pierre Jeanneret, also collaborated on many of the designs. For the manufacture of his furniture, he turned to the German firm Gebrüder Thonet, which had begun making chairs with tubular steel, a material originally used for bicycles, in the early 1920s. Le Corbusier admired the design of Marcel Breuer and the Bauhaus, who in 1925 had begun making sleek modern tubular club chairs. Mies van der Rohe had begun making his version in a sculptural curved form with a cane seat in 1927.

The first results of the collaboration between Le Corbusier and Perriand were three types of chairs made with chrome-plated tubular steel frames: The LC4, Chaise Longue, (1927–28), with a covering of cowhide, which gave it a touch of exoticism; the &quot;Fauteuil Grand Confort&quot; (LC3) (1928–29), a club chair with a tubular frame which resembled the comfortable Art Deco club chairs that became popular in the 1920s; and the &quot;Fauteuil à dossier vascular&quot; (LC4) (1928–29), a low seat suspended in a tubular steel frame, also with cowhide upholstery. These chairs were designed specifically for two of his projects, the &quot;Maison la Roche&quot; in Paris and a pavilion for Barbara and Henry Church. All three clearly showed the influence of Mies van der Rohe and Marcel Breuer. The line of furniture was expanded with additional designs for Le Corbusier&#x27;s 1929 installation, &#x27;Equipment for the Home&#x27;. Despite the intention of Le Corbusier that his furniture should be inexpensive and mass-produced, his pieces were originally costly to make and were not mass-produced until many years later, when he was famous.

== Controversies ==
There is debate over the apparently variable or contradictory nature of Le Corbusier&#x27;s political views. In the 1920s, he co-founded and contributed articles about urbanism to the fascist journals &quot;Plans&quot;, &quot;Prélude&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Homme Réel&quot;. He also penned pieces in favour of Nazi antisemitism for those journals, as well as &quot;hateful editorials&quot;. Between 1925 and 1928, Le Corbusier had connections to Le Faisceau, a short-lived French fascist party led by Georges Valois. (Valois later became an anti-fascist.) Le Corbusier knew another former member of Faisceau, Hubert Lagardelle, a former labor leader and syndicalist who had become disaffected with the political left. In 1934, after Lagardelle had obtained a position at the French embassy in Rome, he arranged for Le Corbusier to lecture on architecture in Italy. Lagardelle later served as minister of labor in the pro-Axis Vichy regime. While Le Corbusier sought commissions from the Vichy regime, particularly the redesign of Marseille after its Jewish population had been forcefully removed, he was unsuccessful, and the only appointment he received from it was membership of a committee studying urbanism. Alexis Carrel, a eugenicist surgeon, appointed Le Corbusier to the Department of Bio-Sociology of the &quot;Foundation for the Study of Human Problems&quot;, an institute promoting eugenics policies under the Vichy regime.

Le Corbusier has been accused of antisemitism. He wrote to his mother in October 1940, as the Vichy government enacted anti-Jewish laws: &quot;The Jews are having a bad time. I occasionally feel sorry. But it appears their blind lust for money has rotted the country.&quot; He was also accused of belittling the Muslim population of Algeria, then part of France. When Le Corbusier proposed a plan for the rebuilding of Algiers, he condemned the existing housing for European Algerians, complaining that it was inferior to that inhabited by indigenous Algerians: &quot;the civilized live like rats in holes&quot; while &quot;the barbarians live in solitude, in well-being.&quot; His plan for rebuilding Algiers was rejected, and thereafter Le Corbusier mostly avoided politics.

==Criticism==
In his eulogy to Le Corbusier at the memorial ceremony for the architect in the courtyard of the Louvre on 1 September 1965, French Culture Minister André Malraux declared, &quot;Le Corbusier had some great rivals, but none of them had the same significance in the revolution of architecture, because none bore insults so patiently and for so long.&quot;

Later criticism of Le Corbusier was directed at his ideas on urban planning. In 1998, the architectural historian Witold Rybczynski wrote in &quot;Time&quot; magazine: &quot;He called it the Ville Radieuse, the Radiant City. Despite the poetic title, his urban vision was authoritarian, inflexible and simplistic. Wherever it was tried—in Chandigarh by Le Corbusier himself or in Brasilia by his followers—it failed. Standardization proved inhuman and disorienting. The open spaces were inhospitable; the bureaucratically imposed plan was socially destructive. In the US, the Radiant City took the form of vast urban-renewal schemes and regimented public housing projects that damaged the urban fabric beyond repair. Today, these megaprojects are being dismantled, as superblocks give way to rows of houses fronting streets and sidewalks. Downtowns have discovered that combining, not separating, different activities is the key to success. So is the presence of lively residential neighbourhoods, old as well as new. Cities have learned that preserving history makes more sense than starting from zero. It has been an expensive lesson, and not one that Le Corbusier intended, but it too is part of his legacy.&quot;

Technological historian and architecture critic Lewis Mumford wrote in &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s City of Tomorrow&quot; that the extravagant heights of Le Corbusier&#x27;s skyscrapers had no reason for existence apart from the fact that they had become technological possibilities. The open spaces in his central areas had no reason for existence either, Mumford wrote, since on the scale he imagined, there was no motive during the business day for pedestrian circulation in the office quarter. By &quot;mating utilitarian and financial image of the skyscraper city to the romantic image of the organic environment, Le Corbusier had produced a sterile hybrid.&quot;

The public housing projects influenced by his ideas have been criticized for isolating poor communities in monolithic high-rises and breaking the social ties integral to a community&#x27;s development. One of his most influential detractors has been Jane Jacobs, who delivered a scathing critique of Le Corbusier&#x27;s urban design theories in her seminal work &quot;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&quot;.

For some critics, the urbanism of Le Corbusier was the model for a fascist state. These critics cited Le Corbusier himself when he wrote that &quot;not all citizens could become leaders. The technocratic elite, the industrialists, financiers, engineers, and artists would be located in the city centre, while the workers would be removed to the fringes of the city&quot;.

Alessandro Hseuh-Bruni wrote in &quot;Le Corbusier&#x27;s Fatal Flaws – A Critique of Modernism&quot; that &quot;In addition to setting the stage for infrastructural developments to come, Le Corbusier&#x27;s blueprints and models, while not so well-regarded by urban planners and street dwellers alike, also examined the sociological side of cities in great detail. World War II left millions dead and transformed the urban landscape throughout much of Europe, from England to the Soviet Union, and housing on a mass scale was necessary. Le Corbusier personally took this as a challenge to accommodate the masses on an unprecedented scale. This mission statement manifested itself in the form of &quot;Cité Radieuse&quot; (The Radiant City), located in Marseille, France. The construction of this utopian sanctuary was dependent on the destruction of traditional neighbourhoods – he showed no regard for French cultural heritage and tradition. Entire neighbourhoods were ravaged to make way for these dense, uniform concrete blocks. If he had his way, Paris&#x27; elite Marais community would have been destroyed. In addition, the theme of segregation that plagued earlier models of Le Corbusier&#x27;s continued in this supposed utopian vision, with the wealthy elite being the only ones to access the luxuries of modernism.&quot;

==Influence==
Le Corbusier was concerned about problems he saw in industrial cities at the turn of the 20th century. He thought industrial housing techniques led to crowding, dirtiness, and a lack of a moral landscape. He was a leader of the modernist movement to create better-living conditions and a better society through housing. Ebenezer Howard&#x27;s &quot;Garden Cities of Tomorrow&quot; heavily influenced Le Corbusier and his contemporaries.

Le Corbusier revolutionized urban planning, and was a founding member of the Congrès International d&#x27;Architecture Moderne (CIAM). One of the first to realize how the automobile would change human society, Le Corbusier conceived the city of the future with large apartment buildings isolated in a park-like setting on pilotis. Le Corbusier&#x27;s plans were adopted by builders of public housing in Europe and the United States. In Great Britain, urban planners turned to Le Corbusier&#x27;s &quot;Cities in the Sky&quot; as a cheaper method of building public housing from the late 1950s. Le Corbusier criticized any effort at ornamentation of the buildings.



Many skyscrapers in Hong Kong and Frankfurt have been inspired by Le Corbusier, and his style is still used as influence for buildings worldwide.

==Fondation Le Corbusier==

The Fondation Le Corbusier is a private foundation and archive honoring the work of Le Corbusier. It operates Maison La Roche, a museum located in the 16th arrondissement at 8–10, square du Dr Blanche, Paris, France, which is open daily except for Sunday.

The foundation was established in 1968. It now owns Maison La Roche and Maison Jeanneret (which form the foundation&#x27;s headquarters), as well as the apartment occupied by Le Corbusier from 1933 to 1965 at rue Nungesser et Coli in Paris 16e, and the &quot;Small House&quot; he built for his parents in Corseaux on the shores of Lac Leman (1924).

Maison La Roche and Maison Jeanneret (1923–24), also known as the La Roche-Jeanneret house, is a pair of semi-detached houses that was Le Corbusier&#x27;s third commission in Paris. They are laid out at right angles to each other, with iron, concrete, and blank, white façades setting off a curved two-story gallery space. Maison La Roche is now a museum containing about 8,000 original drawings, studies and plans by Le Corbusier (in collaboration with Pierre Jeanneret from 1922 to 1940), as well as about 450 of his paintings, about 30 enamels, about 200 other works on paper, and a sizable collection of written and photographic archives. It describes itself as the world&#x27;s largest collection of Le Corbusier drawings, studies, and plans.

<text>Ludovico Ariosto (, ; ; 8 September 1474 – 6 July 1533) was an Italian poet. He is best known as the author of the romance epic &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; (1516). The poem, a continuation of Matteo Maria Boiardo&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Innamorato&quot;, describes the adventures of Charlemagne, Orlando, and the Franks as they battle against the Saracens with diversions into many sideplots. The poem is transformed into a satire of the chivalric tradition. Ariosto composed the poem in the ottava rima rhyme scheme and introduced narrative commentary throughout the work.

Ariosto also coined the term &quot;humanism&quot; (in Italian, &quot;umanesimo&quot;) for choosing to focus upon the strengths and potential of humanity, rather than only upon its role as subordinate to God. This led to Renaissance humanism.

==Birth and early life==

Ariosto was born in Reggio nell&#x27;Emilia, where his father Niccolò Ariosto was commander of the citadel. He was the oldest of 10 children and was seen as the successor to the patriarchal position of his family. From his earliest years, Ludovico was very interested in poetry, but he was obliged by his father to study law.

After five years of law, Ariosto was allowed to read classics under Gregorio da Spoleto. Ariosto&#x27;s studies of Greek and Latin literature were cut short by Spoleto&#x27;s move to France to tutor Francesco Sforza. Shortly after this, Ariosto&#x27;s father died.

==Education and patronage==

After the death of his father, Ludovico Ariosto was compelled to forgo his literary occupations and take care of his family, whose affairs were in disarray. Despite his family obligations, Ariosto managed to write some comedies in prose as well as lyrical pieces. Some of these attracted the notice of Cardinal Ippolito d&#x27;Este, who took the young poet under his patronage and appointed him one of the gentlemen of his household. Este compensated Ariosto poorly for his efforts; the only reward he gave the poet for &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;, dedicated to him, was the question, &quot;Where did you find so many stories, Master Ludovico?&quot; Ariosto later said that the cardinal was ungrateful, that he deplored the time which he spent under his yoke, and that if he received some small pension, it was not to reward him for his poetry – which the prelate despised – but for acting as a messenger.

Ludovico Ariosto and Leonardo da Vinci shared a patron in Cardinal Ippolito d&#x27;Este&#x27;s older sister the Marchioness Isabella d&#x27;Este, the &quot;First Lady of the Renaissance.&quot; Isabella d&#x27;Este appears in Ludovico&#x27;s masterpiece, &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;. She also appears in Leonardo&#x27;s &quot;Sketch for a Portrait of Isabella d&#x27;Este&quot; at the Louvre.


The cardinal went to Hungary in 1518, and wished Ariosto to accompany him. The poet excused himself, pleading ill health, his love of study, and the need to care for his elderly mother. His excuses were not well-received, and he was denied even an interview. Ariosto and d&#x27;Este got into a heated argument, and Ariosto was promptly dismissed from service.

==New patronage and diplomatic career==

The cardinal&#x27;s brother, Alfonso, duke of Ferrara, now took Ariosto under his patronage. By then, Ariosto had already distinguished himself as a diplomat, chiefly on the occasion of two visits to Rome as ambassador to Pope Julius II. The fatigue of one of these journeys brought on an illness from which he never recovered, and on his second mission he was nearly killed by order of the Pope, who happened at the time to be in conflict with Alfonso.

On account of the war, his salary of 84 crowns a year was suspended, and it was withdrawn altogether after the peace. Because of this, Ariosto asked the duke either to provide for him, or to allow him to seek employment elsewhere. He was appointed to the province of Garfagnana, then without a governor, situated on the Apennines, an appointment he held for three years. The province was distracted by factions and bandits, the governor lacked the requisite means to enforce his authority and the duke did little to support his minister. Ariosto&#x27;s government satisfied both the sovereign and the people given over to his care, however; indeed, there is a story about a time when he was walking alone and fell into the company of a group of bandits, the chief of which, on discovering that his captive was the author of &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;, apologized for not having immediately shown him the respect due his rank.

In 1508 Ariosto&#x27;s play &quot;Cassaria&quot; appeared, and the next year &quot;&quot; was first acted in Ferrara and ten years later in the Vatican. A prose edition was published in Rome in 1524, and the first verse edition was published at Venice in 1551. The play, which was translated by George Gascoigne and acted at Gray&#x27;s Inn in London in 1566 and published in 1573, was later used by Shakespeare as a source for &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;.

In 1516 the first version of the &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; in 40 cantos, was published at Ferrara. The third and final version of the &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;, in 46 cantos, appeared on 8 September 1532. The work is according to Goethe “a graceful smiling fantastic creation”. The third edition of the book is quite distinct in terms of diction and structure. However, it seems that today, the reader tends to consider this version as the primary text. Therefore, it might be beneficial to read the three texts in comparison to gain a more comprehensive understanding. Additionally, imitation was a matter of grace at that time, which is why Ariosto took on the task of completing Boiardo’s unfinished &quot;Orlondo Innamorato&quot;.

==Poetic style==
Throughout Ariosto&#x27;s writing are narratorial comments dubbed by Daniel Javitch as &quot;Cantus Interruptus&quot;. Javitch&#x27;s term refers to Ariosto&#x27;s narrative technique to break off one plot line in the middle of a canto, only to pick it up again in another, often much later, canto. Javitch argues that while many critics have assumed Ariosto does this so as to build narrative tension and keep the reader turning pages, the poet in reality defuses narrative tension because so much time separates the interruption and the resumption. By the time the reader gets to the continuation of the story, he or she has often forgotten or ceased to care about the plot and is usually wrapped up in another plot. Ariosto does this, Javitch argues, to undermine &quot;man&#x27;s foolish but persistent desire for continuity and completion&quot;. Ariosto uses it throughout his works.

For example, in Canto II, stanza 30, of &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;, the narrator says:
Some have attributed this piece of metafiction as one component of the &quot;Sorriso ariostesco&quot; or Ariosto&#x27;s smile, the wry sense of humor that Ariosto adds to the text.

In explaining this humor, Thomas Greene, in &quot;Descent from Heaven&quot;, says:
==In literature and popular culture==
Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poem (1836) is supposed to be his address to some unknown beauty on presenting her with his completed &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;.

In his poem &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;, Canto the Fourth (1818), Lord Byron described poet and novelist Walter Scott as &quot;The Ariosto of the North&quot;, and Ariosto as &quot;The southern Scott&quot;. In doing so, Byron connected Ariosto and the Italian Renaissance with early-nineteenth century Scottish and British Romantic writing, emphasising an enduring European literary tradition. Scott, in turn, was influenced by Ariosto and expressed his admiration for the &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;.

The paperback edition of &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; can be briefly glimpsed on table in the dinner scene of the episode &quot;A Ghost&quot; in Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s film &quot;Mystery Train&quot; (1989).

Lodovico Ariosto is mentioned in the novelization of the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Revelations&quot; (2011) as a member of the fictional Italian Brotherhood of Assassins. When the protagonist Ezio Auditore retires from the Brotherhood following the events of the game in 1512, he appoints Lodovico to succeed him as Mentor.

<doc id="17902" wikidata="Q7604" url="?curid=17902" title="Leonhard Euler">
<text>Leonhard Euler ( ; , ; 15 April 170718 September 1783) was a Swiss polymath who was active as a mathematician, physicist, astronomer, logician, geographer, and engineer. He founded the studies of graph theory and topology and made influential discoveries in many other branches of mathematics, such as analytic number theory, complex analysis, and infinitesimal calculus. He also introduced much of modern mathematical terminology and notation, including the notion of a mathematical function. He is known for his work in mechanics, fluid dynamics, optics, astronomy, and music theory. Euler has been called a &quot;universal genius&quot; who &quot;was fully equipped with almost unlimited powers of imagination, intellectual gifts and extraordinary memory&quot;. He spent most of his adult life in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and in Berlin, then the capital of Prussia.

Euler is credited for popularizing the Greek letter formula_1 (lowercase pi) to denote the ratio of a circle&#x27;s circumference to its diameter, as well as first using the notation formula_2 for the value of a function, the letter formula_3 to express the imaginary unit formula_4, the Greek letter formula_5 (capital sigma) to express summations, the Greek letter formula_6 (capital delta) for finite differences, and lowercase letters to represent the sides of a triangle while representing the angles as capital letters. He gave the current definition of the constant formula_7, the base of the natural logarithm, now known as Euler&#x27;s number. Euler made contributions to applied mathematics and engineering, such as his study of ships which helped navigation, his three volumes on optics contributed to the design of microscopes and telescopes, and he studied the bending of beams and the critical load of columns.

Euler is credited with being the first to develop graph theory (partly as a solution for the problem of the Seven Bridges of Königsberg, which is also considered the first practical application of topology). He also became famous for, among many other accomplishments, solving several unsolved problems in number theory and analysis, including the famous Basel problem. Euler has also been credited for discovering that the sum of the numbers of vertices and faces minus the number of edges of a polyhedron equals 2, a number now commonly known as the Euler characteristic. In physics, Euler reformulated Isaac Newton&#x27;s laws of motion into new laws in his two-volume work &quot;Mechanica&quot; to better explain the motion of rigid bodies. He contributed to the study of elastic deformations of solid objects. Euler formulated the partial differential equations for the motion of inviscid fluid, and laid the mathematical foundations of potential theory.

Euler is regarded as arguably the most prolific contributor in the history of mathematics and science, and the greatest mathematician of the 18th century. His 866 publications and his correspondence are being collected in the &quot;Opera Omnia Leonhard Euler&quot; which, when completed, will consist of 81 &quot;quartos&quot;. Several great mathematicians who worked after Euler&#x27;s death have recognised his importance in the field: Pierre-Simon Laplace said, &quot;Read Euler, read Euler, he is the master of us all&quot;; Carl Friedrich Gauss wrote: &quot;The study of Euler&#x27;s works will remain the best school for the different fields of mathematics, and nothing else can replace it.&quot;

==Early life==
Leonhard Euler was born in Basel on 15 April 1707 to Paul III Euler, a pastor of the Reformed Church, and Marguerite (née Brucker), whose ancestors include a number of well-known scholars in the classics. He was the oldest of four children, with two younger sisters, Anna Maria and Maria Magdalena, and a younger brother, Johann Heinrich. Soon after Leonhard&#x27;s birth, the Eulers moved from Basel to Riehen, Switzerland, where his father became pastor in the local church and Leonhard spent most of his childhood.

From a young age, Euler received schooling in mathematics from his father, who had taken courses from Jacob Bernoulli some years earlier at the University of Basel. Around the age of eight, Euler was sent to live at his maternal grandmother&#x27;s house and enrolled in the Latin school in Basel. In addition, he received private tutoring from Johannes Burckhardt, a young theologian with a keen interest in mathematics.

In 1720, at age 13, Euler enrolled at the University of Basel. Attending university at such a young age was not unusual at the time. The course on elementary mathematics was given by Johann Bernoulli, the younger brother of the deceased Jacob Bernoulli, who had taught Euler&#x27;s father. Johann Bernoulli and Euler soon got to know each other better. Euler described Bernoulli in his autobiography:

the famous professor Johann Bernoulli [...] made it a special pleasure for himself to help me along in the mathematical sciences. Private lessons, however, he refused because of his busy schedule. However, he gave me a far more salutary advice, which consisted in myself getting a hold of some of the more difficult mathematical books and working through them with great diligence, and should I encounter some objections or difficulties, he offered me free access to him every Saturday afternoon, and he was gracious enough to comment on the collected difficulties, which was done with such a desired advantage that, when he resolved one of my objections, ten others at once disappeared, which certainly is the best method of making happy progress in the mathematical sciences.

During this time, Euler, backed by Bernoulli, obtained his father&#x27;s consent to become a mathematician instead of a pastor.

In 1723, Euler received a Master of Philosophy with a dissertation that compared the philosophies of René Descartes and Isaac Newton. Afterwards, he enrolled in the theological faculty of the University of Basel.

In 1726, Euler completed a dissertation on the propagation of sound titled &quot;De Sono&quot;, with which he unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a position at the University of Basel. In 1727, he entered the Paris Academy prize competition (offered annually and later biennially by the academy beginning in 1720) for the first time. The problem posed that year was to find the best way to place the masts on a ship. Pierre Bouguer, who became known as &quot;the father of naval architecture&quot;, won and Euler took second place. Over the years, Euler entered this competition 15 times, winning 12 of them.

==Career==
===Saint Petersburg===

Johann Bernoulli&#x27;s two sons, Daniel and Nicolaus, entered into service at the Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg in 1725, leaving Euler with the assurance they would recommend him to a post when one was available. On 31 July 1726, Nicolaus died of appendicitis after spending less than a year in Russia. When Daniel assumed his brother&#x27;s position in the mathematics/physics division, he recommended that the post in physiology that he had vacated be filled by his friend Euler. In November 1726, Euler eagerly accepted the offer, but delayed making the trip to Saint Petersburg while he unsuccessfully applied for a physics professorship at the University of Basel.

Euler arrived in Saint Petersburg in May 1727. He was promoted from his junior post in the medical department of the academy to a position in the mathematics department. He lodged with Daniel Bernoulli with whom he worked in close collaboration. Euler mastered Russian, settled into life in Saint Petersburg and took on an additional job as a medic in the Russian Navy.

The academy at Saint Petersburg, established by Peter the Great, was intended to improve education in Russia and to close the scientific gap with Western Europe. As a result, it was made especially attractive to foreign scholars like Euler. The academy&#x27;s benefactress, Catherine I, who had continued the progressive policies of her late husband, died before Euler&#x27;s arrival to Saint Petersburg. The Russian conservative nobility then gained power upon the ascension of the twelve-year-old Peter II. The nobility, suspicious of the academy&#x27;s foreign scientists, cut funding for Euler and his colleagues and prevented the entrance of foreign and non-aristocratic students into the Gymnasium and universities.

Conditions improved slightly after the death of Peter II in 1730 and the German-influenced Anna of Russia assumed power. Euler swiftly rose through the ranks in the academy and was made a professor of physics in 1731. He also left the Russian Navy, refusing a promotion to lieutenant. Two years later, Daniel Bernoulli, fed up with the censorship and hostility he faced at Saint Petersburg, left for Basel. Euler succeeded him as the head of the mathematics department. In January 1734, he married Katharina Gsell (1707–1773), a daughter of Georg Gsell. Frederick II had made an attempt to recruit the services of Euler for his newly established Berlin Academy in 1740, but Euler initially preferred to stay in St Petersburg. But after Empress Anna died and Frederick II agreed to pay 1600 ecus (the same as Euler earned in Russia) he agreed to move to Berlin. In 1741, he requested permission to leave to Berlin, arguing he was in need of a milder climate for his eyesight. The Russian academy gave its consent and would pay him 200 rubles per year as one of its active members.

=== Berlin ===
Concerned about the continuing turmoil in Russia, Euler left St. Petersburg in June 1741 to take up a post at the Berlin Academy, which he had been offered by Frederick the Great of Prussia. He lived for 25 years in Berlin, where he wrote several hundred articles. In 1748 his text on functions called the &quot;Introductio in analysin infinitorum&quot; was published and in 1755 a text on differential calculus called the &quot;Institutiones calculi differentialis&quot; was published. In 1755, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and of the French Academy of Sciences. Notable students of Euler in Berlin included Stepan Rumovsky, later considered as the first Russian astronomer. In 1748 he declined an offer from the University of Basel to succeed the recently deceased Johann Bernoulli. In 1753 he bought a house in Charlottenburg, in which he lived with his family and widowed mother.

Euler became the tutor for Friederike Charlotte of Brandenburg-Schwedt, the Princess of Anhalt-Dessau and Frederick&#x27;s niece. He wrote over 200 letters to her in the early 1760s, which were later compiled into a volume entitled &quot;Letters of Euler on different Subjects in Natural Philosophy Addressed to a German Princess&quot;. This work contained Euler&#x27;s exposition on various subjects pertaining to physics and mathematics and offered valuable insights into Euler&#x27;s personality and religious beliefs. It was translated into multiple languages, published across Europe and in the United States, and became more widely read than any of his mathematical works. The popularity of the &quot;Letters&quot; testifies to Euler&#x27;s ability to communicate scientific matters effectively to a lay audience, a rare ability for a dedicated research scientist.

Despite Euler&#x27;s immense contribution to the academy&#x27;s prestige and having been put forward as a candidate for its presidency by Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert, Frederick II named himself as its president. The Prussian king had a large circle of intellectuals in his court, and he found the mathematician unsophisticated and ill-informed on matters beyond numbers and figures. Euler was a simple, devoutly religious man who never questioned the existing social order or conventional beliefs. He was, in many ways, the polar opposite of Voltaire, who enjoyed a high place of prestige at Frederick&#x27;s court. Euler was not a skilled debater and often made it a point to argue subjects that he knew little about, making him the frequent target of Voltaire&#x27;s wit. Frederick also expressed disappointment with Euler&#x27;s practical engineering abilities, stating:

However, the disappointment was almost surely unwarranted from a technical perspective. Euler&#x27;s calculations look likely to be correct, even if Euler&#x27;s interactions with Frederick and those constructing his fountain may have been dysfunctional.

Throughout his stay in Berlin, Euler maintained a strong connection to the academy in St. Petersburg and also published 109 papers in Russia. He also assisted students from the St. Petersburg academy and at times accommodated Russian students in his house in Berlin. In 1760, with the Seven Years&#x27; War raging, Euler&#x27;s farm in Charlottenburg was sacked by advancing Russian troops. Upon learning of this event, General Ivan Petrovich Saltykov paid compensation for the damage caused to Euler&#x27;s estate, with Empress Elizabeth of Russia later adding a further payment of 4000 rubles—an exorbitant amount at the time. Euler decided to leave Berlin in 1766 and return to Russia.

During his Berlin years (1741–1766), Euler was at the peak of his productivity. He wrote 380 works, 275 of which were published. This included 125 memoirs in the Berlin Academy and over 100 memoirs sent to the St. Petersburg Academy, which had retained him as a member and paid him an annual stipend. Euler&#x27;s &quot;Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum&quot; was published in two parts in 1748. In addition to his own research, Euler supervised the library, the observatory, the botanical garden, and the publication of calendars and maps from which the academy derived income. He was even involved in the design of the water fountains at Sanssouci, the King&#x27;s summer palace.

===Return to Russia===
The political situation in Russia stabilized after Catherine the Great&#x27;s accession to the throne, so in 1766 Euler accepted an invitation to return to the St. Petersburg Academy. His conditions were quite exorbitant—a 3000 ruble annual salary, a pension for his wife, and the promise of high-ranking appointments for his sons. At the university he was assisted by his student Anders Johan Lexell. While living in St. Petersburg, a fire in 1771 destroyed his home.

==Personal life==
On 7 January 1734, Euler married Katharina Gsell, daughter of Georg Gsell, a painter at the Academy Gymnasium in Saint Petersburg. The couple bought a house by the Neva River.

Of their 13 children, five survived childhood, three sons and two daughters. Their first son was Johann Albrecht Euler, whose godfather was Christian Goldbach.

Three years after his wife&#x27;s death in 1773, Euler married her half-sister, Salome Abigail Gsell. This marriage lasted until his death in 1783.

His brother Johann Heinrich settled in St. Petersburg in 1735 and was employed as a painter at the academy.

Early in his life, Euler memorized Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, and by old age, he could recite the poem and give the first and last sentence on each page of the edition from which he had learnt it. Euler knew the first hundred prime numbers and could give each of their powers up to the sixth degree. 

Euler was known as a generous and kind person, not neurotic as seen in some geniuses, keeping his good-natured disposition even after becoming entirely blind.

===Eyesight deterioration===
Euler&#x27;s eyesight worsened throughout his mathematical career. In 1738, three years after nearly dying of fever, he became almost blind in his right eye. Euler blamed the cartography he performed for the St. Petersburg Academy for his condition, but the cause of his blindness remains the subject of speculation. Euler&#x27;s vision in that eye worsened throughout his stay in Germany, to the extent that Frederick called him &quot;Cyclops&quot;. Euler said of his loss of vision, &quot;Now I will have fewer distractions.&quot; In 1766 a cataract in his left eye was discovered. Though couching of the cataract temporarily improved his vision, complications rendered him almost totally blind in the left eye as well. His condition appeared to have little effect on his productivity. With the aid of his scribes, Euler&#x27;s productivity in many areas of study increased; in 1775, he produced, on average, one mathematical paper per week.

=== Death ===
In St. Petersburg on 18 September 1783, after a lunch with his family, Euler was discussing the newly discovered planet Uranus and its orbit with Anders Johan Lexell when he collapsed and died of a brain hemorrhage. wrote a short obituary for the Russian Academy of Sciences and Russian mathematician Nicolas Fuss, one of Euler&#x27;s disciples, wrote a more detailed eulogy, which he delivered at a memorial meeting. In his eulogy for the French Academy, French mathematician and philosopher Marquis de Condorcet wrote:


Euler was buried next to Katharina at the Smolensk Lutheran Cemetery on Vasilievsky Island. In 1837, the Russian Academy of Sciences installed a new monument, replacing his overgrown grave plaque. To commemorate the 250th anniversary of Euler&#x27;s birth in 1957, his tomb was moved to the Lazarevskoe Cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery.

==Contributions to mathematics and physics==
Euler worked in almost all areas of mathematics, including geometry, infinitesimal calculus, trigonometry, algebra, and number theory, as well as continuum physics, lunar theory, and other areas of physics. He is a seminal figure in the history of mathematics; if printed, his works, many of which are of fundamental interest, would occupy between 60 and 80 quarto volumes. Euler&#x27;s name is associated with a large number of topics. Euler&#x27;s work averages 800 pages a year from 1725 to 1783. He also wrote over 4500 letters and hundreds of manuscripts. It has been estimated that Leonhard Euler was the author of a quarter of the combined output in mathematics, physics, mechanics, astronomy, and navigation in the 18th century, while other researchers credit Euler for a third of the output in mathematics in that century.

===Mathematical notation===
Euler introduced and popularized several notational conventions through his numerous and widely circulated textbooks. Most notably, he introduced the concept of a function and was the first to write &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) to denote the function &quot;f&quot; applied to the argument &quot;x&quot;. He also introduced the modern notation for the trigonometric functions, the letter for the base of the natural logarithm (now also known as Euler&#x27;s number), the Greek letter Σ for summations and the letter to denote the imaginary unit. The use of the Greek letter &quot;π&quot; to denote the ratio of a circle&#x27;s circumference to its diameter was also popularized by Euler, although it originated with Welsh mathematician William Jones.

===Analysis===
The development of infinitesimal calculus was at the forefront of 18th-century mathematical research, and the Bernoullis—family friends of Euler—were responsible for much of the early progress in the field. Thanks to their influence, studying calculus became the major focus of Euler&#x27;s work. While some of Euler&#x27;s proofs are not acceptable by modern standards of mathematical rigour (in particular his reliance on the principle of the generality of algebra), his ideas led to many great advances.
Euler is well known in analysis for his frequent use and development of power series, the expression of functions as sums of infinitely many terms, such as
formula_8

Euler&#x27;s use of power series enabled him to solve the Basel problem, finding the sum of the reciprocals of squares of every natural number, in 1735 (he provided a more elaborate argument in 1741). The Basel problem was originally posed by Pietro Mengoli in 1644, and by the 1730s was a famous open problem, popularized by Jacob Bernoulli and unsuccessfully attacked by many of the leading mathematicians of the time. Euler found that:

formula_9

Euler introduced the constant
formula_10
now known as Euler&#x27;s constant or the Euler–Mascheroni constant, and studied its relationship with the harmonic series, the gamma function, and values of the Riemann zeta function.

Euler introduced the use of the exponential function and logarithms in analytic proofs. He discovered ways to express various logarithmic functions using power series, and he successfully defined logarithms for negative and complex numbers, thus greatly expanding the scope of mathematical applications of logarithms. He also defined the exponential function for complex numbers and discovered its relation to the trigonometric functions. For any real number (taken to be radians), Euler&#x27;s formula states that the complex exponential function satisfies
formula_11

which was called &quot;the most remarkable formula in mathematics&quot; by Richard Feynman.

A special case of the above formula is known as Euler&#x27;s identity,
formula_12

Euler elaborated the theory of higher transcendental functions by introducing the gamma function and introduced a new method for solving quartic equations. He found a way to calculate integrals with complex limits, foreshadowing the development of modern complex analysis. He invented the calculus of variations and formulated the Euler–Lagrange equation for reducing optimization problems in this area to the solution of differential equations.

Euler pioneered the use of analytic methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, analytic number theory. In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of hypergeometric series, q-series, hyperbolic trigonometric functions, and the analytic theory of continued fractions. For example, he proved the infinitude of primes using the divergence of the harmonic series, and he used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way prime numbers are distributed. Euler&#x27;s work in this area led to the development of the prime number theorem.

===Number theory===
Euler&#x27;s interest in number theory can be traced to the influence of Christian Goldbach, his friend in the St. Petersburg Academy. Much of Euler&#x27;s early work on number theory was based on the work of Pierre de Fermat. Euler developed some of Fermat&#x27;s ideas and disproved some of his conjectures, such as his conjecture that all numbers of the form formula_13 (Fermat numbers) are prime.

Euler linked the nature of prime distribution with ideas in analysis. He proved that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges. In doing so, he discovered the connection between the Riemann zeta function and prime numbers; this is known as the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function.

Euler invented the totient function φ(&quot;n&quot;), the number of positive integers less than or equal to the integer &quot;n&quot; that are coprime to &quot;n&quot;. Using properties of this function, he generalized Fermat&#x27;s little theorem to what is now known as Euler&#x27;s theorem. He contributed significantly to the theory of perfect numbers, which had fascinated mathematicians since Euclid. He proved that the relationship shown between even perfect numbers and Mersenne primes (which he had earlier proved) was one-to-one, a result otherwise known as the Euclid–Euler theorem. Euler also conjectured the law of quadratic reciprocity. The concept is regarded as a fundamental theorem within number theory, and his ideas paved the way for the work of Carl Friedrich Gauss, particularly &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot;. By 1772 Euler had proved that 231 − 1 = 2,147,483,647 is a Mersenne prime. It may have remained the largest known prime until 1867.

Euler also contributed major developments to the theory of partitions of an integer.

===Graph theory===

In 1735, Euler presented a solution to the problem known as the Seven Bridges of Königsberg. The city of Königsberg, Prussia was set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands that were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once. Euler showed that it is not possible: there is no Eulerian path. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory.

Euler also discovered the formula formula_14 relating the number of vertices, edges, and faces of a convex polyhedron, and hence of a planar graph. The constant in this formula is now known as the Euler characteristic for the graph (or other mathematical object), and is related to the genus of the object. The study and generalization of this formula, specifically by Cauchy and L&#x27;Huilier, is at the origin of topology.

===Physics, astronomy, and engineering===

Some of Euler&#x27;s greatest successes were in solving real-world problems analytically, and in describing numerous applications of the Bernoulli numbers, Fourier series, Euler numbers, the constants and , continued fractions, and integrals. He integrated Leibniz&#x27;s differential calculus with Newton&#x27;s Method of Fluxions, and developed tools that made it easier to apply calculus to physical problems. He made great strides in improving the numerical approximation of integrals, inventing what are now known as the Euler approximations. The most notable of these approximations are Euler&#x27;s method and the Euler–Maclaurin formula.

Euler helped develop the Euler–Bernoulli beam equation, which became a cornerstone of engineering. Besides successfully applying his analytic tools to problems in classical mechanics, Euler applied these techniques to celestial problems. His work in astronomy was recognized by multiple Paris Academy Prizes over the course of his career. His accomplishments include determining with great accuracy the orbits of comets and other celestial bodies, understanding the nature of comets, and calculating the parallax of the Sun. His calculations contributed to the development of accurate longitude tables.

Euler made important contributions in optics. He disagreed with Newton&#x27;s corpuscular theory of light, which was the prevailing theory of the time. His 1740s papers on optics helped ensure that the wave theory of light proposed by Christiaan Huygens would become the dominant mode of thought, at least until the development of the quantum theory of light.

In fluid dynamics, Euler was the first to predict the phenomenon of cavitation, in 1754, long before its first observation in the late 19th century, and the Euler number used in fluid flow calculations comes from his related work on the efficiency of turbines. In 1757 he published an important set of equations for inviscid flow in fluid dynamics, that are now known as the Euler equations.

Euler is well known in structural engineering for his formula giving Euler&#x27;s critical load, the critical buckling load of an ideal strut, which depends only on its length and flexural stiffness.

===Logic===
Euler is credited with using closed curves to illustrate syllogistic reasoning (1768). These diagrams have become known as Euler diagrams.
An Euler diagram is a diagrammatic means of representing sets and their relationships. Euler diagrams consist of simple closed curves (usually circles) in the plane that depict sets. Each Euler curve divides the plane into two regions or &quot;zones&quot;: the interior, which symbolically represents the elements of the set, and the exterior, which represents all elements that are not members of the set. The sizes or shapes of the curves are not important; the significance of the diagram is in how they overlap. The spatial relationships between the regions bounded by each curve (overlap, containment or neither) corresponds to set-theoretic relationships (intersection, subset, and disjointness). Curves whose interior zones do not intersect represent disjoint sets. Two curves whose interior zones intersect represent sets that have common elements; the zone inside both curves represents the set of elements common to both sets (the intersection of the sets). A curve that is contained completely within the interior zone of another represents a subset of it.

Euler diagrams (and their refinement to Venn diagrams) were incorporated as part of instruction in set theory as part of the new math movement in the 1960s. Since then, they have come into wide use as a way of visualizing combinations of characteristics.

===Music===
One of Euler&#x27;s more unusual interests was the application of mathematical ideas in music. In 1739 he wrote the &quot;Tentamen novae theoriae musicae&quot; (&quot;Attempt at a New Theory of Music&quot;), hoping to eventually incorporate musical theory as part of mathematics. This part of his work, however, did not receive wide attention and was once described as too mathematical for musicians and too musical for mathematicians. Even when dealing with music, Euler&#x27;s approach is mainly mathematical, for instance, his introduction of binary logarithms as a way of numerically describing the subdivision of octaves into fractional parts. His writings on music are not particularly numerous (a few hundred pages, in his total production of about thirty thousand pages), but they reflect an early preoccupation and one that remained with him throughout his life.

A first point of Euler&#x27;s musical theory is the definition of &quot;genres&quot;, i.e. of possible divisions of the octave using the prime numbers 3 and 5. Euler describes 18 such genres, with the general definition 2mA, where A is the &quot;exponent&quot; of the genre (i.e. the sum of the exponents of 3 and 5) and 2m (where &quot;m is an indefinite number, small or large, so long as the sounds are perceptible&quot;), expresses that the relation holds independently of the number of octaves concerned. The first genre, with A = 1, is the octave itself (or its duplicates); the second genre, 2m.3, is the octave divided by the fifth (fifth + fourth, C–G–C); the third genre is 2m.5, major third + minor sixth (C–E–C); the fourth is 2m.32, two-fourths and a tone (C–F–B–C); the fifth is 2m.3.5 (C–E–G–B–C); etc. Genres 12 (2m.33.5), 13 (2m.32.52) and 14 (2m.3.53) are corrected versions of the diatonic, chromatic and enharmonic, respectively, of the Ancients. Genre 18 (2m.33.52) is the &quot;diatonico-chromatic&quot;, &quot;used generally in all compositions&quot;, and which turns out to be identical with the system described by Johann Mattheson. Euler later envisaged the possibility of describing genres including the prime number 7.

Euler devised a specific graph, the &quot;Speculum musicum&quot;, to illustrate the diatonico-chromatic genre, and discussed paths in this graph for specific intervals, recalling his interest in the Seven Bridges of Königsberg (see above). The device drew renewed interest as the Tonnetz in Neo-Riemannian theory (see also Lattice (music)).

Euler further used the principle of the &quot;exponent&quot; to propose a derivation of the &quot;gradus suavitatis&quot; (degree of suavity, of agreeableness) of intervals and chords from their prime factors – one must keep in mind that he considered just intonation, i.e. 1 and the prime numbers 3 and 5 only. Formulas have been proposed extending this system to any number of prime numbers, e.g. in the form
formula_15
where &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; are prime numbers and &quot;k&quot;&quot;i&quot; their exponents.

==Personal philosophy and religious beliefs==
Euler was religious throughout his life. Much of what is known of his religious beliefs can be deduced from his &quot;Letters to a German Princess&quot; and an earlier work, &quot;Rettung der Göttlichen Offenbahrung gegen die Einwürfe der Freygeister&quot; (&quot;Defense of the Divine Revelation against the Objections of the Freethinkers&quot;). These show that Euler was a devout Christian who believed the Bible to be inspired; the &quot;Rettung&quot; was primarily an argument for the divine inspiration of scripture.

Euler opposed the concepts of Leibniz&#x27;s monadism and the philosophy of Christian Wolff. He insisted that knowledge is founded in part on the basis of precise quantitative laws, something that monadism and Wolffian science were unable to provide. Euler called Wolff&#x27;s ideas &quot;heathen and atheistic&quot;.

There is a legend inspired by Euler&#x27;s arguments with secular philosophers over religion, which is set during Euler&#x27;s second stint at the St. Petersburg Academy. The French philosopher Denis Diderot was visiting Russia on Catherine the Great&#x27;s invitation. The Empress was alarmed that Diderot&#x27;s arguments for atheism were influencing members of her court, and so Euler was asked to confront him. Diderot was informed that a learned mathematician had produced a proof of the existence of God: he agreed to view the proof as it was presented in court. Euler appeared, advanced toward Diderot, and in a tone of perfect conviction announced this non sequitur:

&quot;Sir, formula_16, hence God exists –reply!&quot;

Diderot, to whom (says the story) all mathematics was gibberish, stood dumbstruck as peals of laughter erupted from the court. Embarrassed, he asked to leave Russia, a request Catherine granted. However amusing the anecdote may be, it is , given that Diderot himself did research in mathematics.
The legend was apparently first told by Dieudonné Thiébault with embellishment by Augustus De Morgan.

==Legacy==

===Recognition===
Euler is widely recognized as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, and more likely than not the most prolific contributor to mathematics and science. Mathematician and physicist John von Neumann called Euler &quot;the greatest virtuoso of the period&quot;. Mathematician François Arago said, &quot;Euler calculated without any apparent effort, just as men breathe and as eagles sustain themselves in air&quot;. He is generally ranked right below Carl Friedrich Gauss, Isaac Newton, and Archimedes among the greatest mathematicians of all time, while some rank him as equal with them. Physicist and mathematician Henri Poincaré called Euler the &quot;god of mathematics&quot;. 

French mathematician André Weil noted that Euler stood above his contemporaries and more than anyone else was able to cement himself as the leading force of his era&#x27;s mathematics:Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fuss noted Euler&#x27;s extraordinary memory and breadth of knowledge, saying:

===Commemorations===


Euler was featured on both the sixth and seventh series of the Swiss 10-franc banknote and on numerous Swiss, German, and Russian postage stamps. In 1782 he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The asteroid 2002 Euler was named in his honour.

==Selected bibliography==
Euler has an extensive bibliography. His books include:
* &quot;Mechanica&quot; (1736)
* &quot;Methodus inveniendi lineas curvas maximi minimive proprietate gaudentes, sive solutio problematis isoperimetrici latissimo sensu accepti&quot; (1744) (&quot;A method for finding curved lines enjoying properties of maximum or minimum, or solution of isoperimetric problems in the broadest accepted sense&quot;)
* &quot;Introductio in analysin infinitorum&quot; (1748) (&quot;Introduction to Analysis of the Infinite&quot;)
* &quot;Institutiones calculi differentialis&quot; (1755) (&quot;Foundations of differential calculus&quot;)
* &quot;Vollständige Anleitung zur Algebra&quot; (1765) (&quot;Elements of Algebra&quot;)
* &quot;Institutiones calculi integralis&quot; (1768–1770) (&quot;Foundations of integral calculus&quot;)
* &quot;Letters to a German Princess&quot; (1768–1772)
* &quot;Dioptrica&quot;, published in three volumes beginning in 1769

It took until 1830 for the bulk of Euler&#x27;s posthumous works to be individually published, with an additional batch of 61 unpublished works discovered by Paul Heinrich von Fuss (Euler&#x27;s great-grandson and Nicolas Fuss&#x27;s son) and published as a collection in 1862. A chronological catalog of Euler&#x27;s works was compiled by Swedish mathematician Gustaf Eneström and published from 1910 to 1913. The catalog, known as the Eneström index, numbers Euler&#x27;s works from E1 to E866. The Euler Archive was started at Dartmouth College before moving to the Mathematical Association of America and, most recently, to University of the Pacific in 2017.

In 1907, the Swiss Academy of Sciences created the Euler Commission and charged it with the publication of Euler&#x27;s complete works. After several delays in the 19th century, the first volume of the &quot;Opera Omnia&quot;, was published in 1911. However, the discovery of new manuscripts continued to increase the magnitude of this project. Fortunately, the publication of Euler&#x27;s Opera Omnia has made steady progress, with over 70 volumes (averaging 426 pages each) published by 2006 and 80 volumes published by 2022. These volumes are organized into four series. The first series compiles the works on analysis, algebra, and number theory; it consists of 29 volumes and numbers over 14,000 pages. The 31 volumes of Series II, amounting to 10,660 pages, contain the works on mechanics, astronomy, and engineering. Series III contains 12 volumes on physics. Series IV, which contains the massive amount of Euler&#x27;s correspondence, unpublished manuscripts, and notes only began compilation in 1967. After publishing 8 print volumes in Series IV, the project decided in 2022 to publish its remaining projected volumes in Series IV in online format only.

<doc id="17904" wikidata="Q3339222" url="?curid=17904" title="Linear model">
<text>In statistics, the term linear model refers to any model which assumes linearity in the system. The most common occurrence is in connection with regression models and the term is often taken as synonymous with linear regression model. However, the term is also used in time series analysis with a different meaning. In each case, the designation &quot;linear&quot; is used to identify a subclass of models for which substantial reduction in the complexity of the related statistical theory is possible.

==Linear regression models==
For the regression case, the statistical model is as follows. Given a (random) sample formula_1 the relation between the observations formula_2 and the independent variables formula_3 is formulated as

:formula_4

where formula_5 may be nonlinear functions. In the above, the quantities formula_6 are random variables representing errors in the relationship. The &quot;linear&quot; part of the designation relates to the appearance of the regression coefficients, formula_7 in a linear way in the above relationship. Alternatively, one may say that the predicted values corresponding to the above model, namely
:formula_8
are linear functions of the formula_7.

Given that estimation is undertaken on the basis of a least squares analysis, estimates of the unknown parameters formula_7 are determined by minimising a sum of squares function
:formula_11
From this, it can readily be seen that the &quot;linear&quot; aspect of the model means the following:
:*the function to be minimised is a quadratic function of the formula_7 for which minimisation is a relatively simple problem;
:*the derivatives of the function are linear functions of the formula_7 making it easy to find the minimising values;
:*the minimising values formula_7 are linear functions of the observations formula_2;
:*the minimising values formula_7 are linear functions of the random errors formula_6 which makes it relatively easy to determine the statistical properties of the estimated values of formula_7.

==Time series models==

An example of a linear time series model is an autoregressive moving average model. Here the model for values {formula_19} in a time series can be written in the form

:formula_20

where again the quantities formula_6 are random variables representing innovations which are new random effects that appear at a certain time but also affect values of formula_22 at later times. In this instance the use of the term &quot;linear model&quot; refers to the structure of the above relationship in representing formula_19 as a linear function of past values of the same time series and of current and past values of the innovations. This particular aspect of the structure means that it is relatively simple to derive relations for the mean and covariance properties of the time series. Note that here the &quot;linear&quot; part of the term &quot;linear model&quot; is not referring to the coefficients formula_24 and formula_25, as it would be in the case of a regression model, which looks structurally similar.

==Other uses in statistics==

There are some other instances where &quot;nonlinear model&quot; is used to contrast with a linearly structured model, although the term &quot;linear model&quot; is not usually applied. One example of this is nonlinear dimensionality reduction.

<doc id="17905" wikidata="Q13200161" url="?curid=17905" title="Likelihood principle">
<text>In statistics, the likelihood principle is the proposition that, given a statistical model, all the evidence in a sample relevant to model parameters is contained in the likelihood function.

A likelihood function arises from a probability density function considered as a function of its distributional parameterization argument. For example, consider a model which gives the probability density function formula_1 of observable random variable formula_2 as a function of a parameter formula_3. Then for a specific value formula_4 of formula_5, the function formula_6 is a likelihood function of formula_3: it gives a measure of how &quot;likely&quot; any particular value of formula_8 is, if we know that formula_9 has the value formula_10. The density function may be a density with respect to counting measure, i.e. a probability mass function.

Two likelihood functions are &quot;equivalent&quot; if one is a scalar multiple of the other.
The likelihood principle is this: All information from the data that is relevant to inferences about the value of the model parameters is in the equivalence class to which the likelihood function belongs. The strong likelihood principle applies this same criterion to cases such as sequential experiments where the sample of data that is available results from applying a stopping rule to the observations earlier in the experiment.

==Example==

Suppose

* formula_11 is the number of successes in twelve independent Bernoulli trials with each attempt having probability formula_12 of success on each trial, and
* formula_13 is the number of independent Bernoulli trials needed to get a total of three successes, again each attempt with probability formula_12 of success on each trial (if it was a fair coin each toss would have formula_15 of either outcome, heads or tails).

Then the observation that formula_16 induces the likelihood function

:formula_17

while the observation that formula_18 induces the likelihood function

:formula_19

The likelihood principle says that, as the data are the same in both cases, the inferences drawn about the value of formula_12 should also be the same. In addition, all the inferential content in the data about the value of formula_12 is contained in the two likelihoods, and is the same if they are proportional to one another. This is the case in the above example, reflecting the fact that the difference between observing formula_16 and observing formula_18 lies not in the actual data collected, nor in the conduct of the experimenter, but in the two different designs of the experiment.

Specifically, in one case, the decision in advance was to try twelve times, regardless of the outcome; in the other case, the advance decision was to keep trying until three successes were observed. &quot;If you support the likelihood principle&quot; then inference about formula_12 should be the same for both cases because the two likelihoods are proportional to each other: Except for a constant leading factor of vs. , the two likelihood functions are the same – constant multiples of each other.

This equivalence is not always the case, however. The use of frequentist methods involving leads to different inferences for the two cases above,
showing that the outcome of frequentist methods depends on the experimental procedure, and thus violates the likelihood principle.

==The law of likelihood==
A related concept is the law of likelihood, the notion that the extent to which the evidence supports one parameter value or hypothesis against another is indicated by the ratio of their likelihoods, their likelihood ratio. That is,
:formula_25
is the degree to which the observation supports parameter value or hypothesis against . If this ratio is 1, the evidence is indifferent; if greater than 1, the evidence supports the value against ; or if less, then vice versa.

In Bayesian statistics, this ratio is known as the Bayes factor, and Bayes&#x27; rule can be seen as the application of the law of likelihood to inference.

In frequentist inference, the likelihood ratio is used in the likelihood-ratio test, but other non-likelihood tests are used as well. The Neyman–Pearson lemma states the likelihood-ratio test is equally statistically powerful as the most powerful test for comparing two simple hypotheses at a given significance level, which gives a frequentist justification for the law of likelihood.

Combining the likelihood principle with the law of likelihood yields the consequence that the parameter value which maximizes the likelihood function is the value which is most strongly supported by the evidence. This is the basis for the widely used method of maximum likelihood.

== History ==

The likelihood principle was first identified by that name in print in 1962 (Barnard &quot;et al&quot;., Birnbaum, and Savage &quot;et al&quot;.), but arguments for the same principle, unnamed, and the use of the principle in applications goes back to the works of R.A. Fisher in the 1920s. The law of likelihood was identified by that name by I. Hacking (1965). More recently the likelihood principle as a general principle of inference has been championed by A.W.F. Edwards. The likelihood principle has been applied to the philosophy of science by R. Royall.

Birnbaum (1962) initially argued that the likelihood principle follows from two more primitive and seemingly reasonable principles, the &quot;conditionality principle&quot; and the &quot;sufficiency principle&quot;:
* The conditionality principle says that if an experiment is chosen by a random process independent of the states of nature formula_26 then only the experiment actually performed is relevant to inferences about formula_27
* The sufficiency principle says that if formula_28 is a sufficient statistic for formula_26 and if in two experiments with data formula_30 and formula_31 we have formula_32 then the evidence about formula_12 given by the two experiments is the same.

However, upon further consideration Birnbaum rejected both his conditionality principle and the likelihood principle. The adequacy of Birnbaum&#x27;s original argument has also been contested by others (&quot;see below for details&quot;).

== Arguments for and against ==
Some widely used methods of conventional statistics, for example many significance tests, are not consistent with the likelihood principle.

Let us briefly consider some of the arguments for and against the likelihood principle.

===The original Birnbaum argument===

According to Giere (1977), Birnbaum rejected both his own conditionality principle and the likelihood principle because they were both incompatible with what he called the “confidence concept of statistical evidence”, which Birnbaum (1970) describes as taking “from the Neyman-Pearson approach techniques for systematically appraising and bounding the probabilities (under respective hypotheses) of seriously misleading interpretations of data” ( p. 1033). The confidence concept incorporates only limited aspects of the likelihood concept and only some applications of the conditionality concept. Birnbaum later notes that it was the unqualified equivalence formulation of his 1962 version of the conditionality principle that led “to the monster of the likelihood axiom” ( p. 263).

Birnbaum&#x27;s original argument for the likelihood principle has also been disputed by other statisticians including Akaike, Evans and philosophers of science, including Deborah Mayo. Dawid points out fundamental differences between Mayo&#x27;s and Birnbaum&#x27;s definitions of the conditionality principle, arguing Birnbaum&#x27;s argument cannot be so readily dismissed. A new proof of the likelihood principle has been provided by Gandenberger that addresses some of the counterarguments to the original proof.

===Experimental design arguments on the likelihood principle===
Unrealized events play a role in some common statistical methods. For example, the result of a significance test depends on the -value, the probability of a result as extreme or more extreme than the observation, and that probability may depend on the design of the experiment. To the extent that the likelihood principle is accepted, such methods are therefore denied.

Some classical significance tests are not based on the likelihood. The following are a simple and more complicated example of those, using a commonly cited example called &quot;the optional stopping problem&quot;.

;Example 1 – simple version:
Suppose I tell you that I tossed a coin 12 times and in the process observed 3 heads. You might make some inference about the probability of heads and whether the coin was fair.

Suppose now I tell that I tossed the coin &quot;until&quot; I observed 3 heads, and I tossed it 12 times. Will you now make some different inference?

The likelihood function is the same in both cases: It is proportional to
:formula_34.

So according to the &quot;likelihood principle&quot;, in either case the inference should be the same.

;Example 2 – a more elaborated version of the same statistics:
Suppose a number of scientists are assessing the probability of a certain outcome (which we shall call &#x27;success&#x27;) in experimental trials. Conventional wisdom suggests that if there is no bias towards success or failure then the success probability would be one half. Adam, a scientist, conducted 12 trials and obtains 3 successes and 9 failures. One of those successes was the 12th and last observation. Then Adam left the lab.

Bill, a colleague in the same lab, continued Adam&#x27;s work and published Adam&#x27;s results, along with a significance test. He tested the null hypothesis that , the success probability, is equal to a half, versus  . If we ignore the information that the third success was the 12th and last observation, the probability of the observed result that out of 12 trials 3 or something fewer (i.e. more extreme) were successes, if is true, is

:formula_35,

which is  . Thus the null hypothesis is not rejected at the 5% significance level if we ignore the knowledge that the third success was the 12th result.

However observe that this first calculation also includes 12 token long sequences that end in tails contrary to the problem statement!

If we redo this calculation we realize the likelihood according to the null hypothesis must be the probability of a fair coin landing 2 or fewer heads on 11 trials multiplied with the probability of the fair coin landing a head for the 12th trial:

:formula_36,

which is  . Now the result &quot;is&quot; statistically significant at the level.

Charlotte, another scientist, reads Bill&#x27;s paper and writes a letter, saying that it is possible that Adam kept trying until he obtained 3 successes, in which case the probability of needing to conduct 12 or more experiments is given by

:formula_36,

which is  . Now the result &quot;is&quot; statistically significant at the level. Note that there is no contradiction between the latter two correct analyses; both computations are correct, and result in the same p-value.

To these scientists, whether a result is significant or not does not depend on the design of the experiment, but does on the likelihood (in the sense of the likelihood function) of the parameter value being  .

;Summary of the illustrated issues:
Results of this kind are considered by some as arguments against the likelihood principle. For others it exemplifies the value of the likelihood principle and is an argument against significance tests.

Similar themes appear when comparing Fisher&#x27;s exact test with Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test.

===The voltmeter story===
An argument in favor of the likelihood principle is given by Edwards in his book &quot;Likelihood&quot;. He cites the following story from J.W. Pratt, slightly condensed here. Note that the likelihood function depends only on what actually happened, and not on what &quot;could&quot; have happened.

: An engineer draws a random sample of electron tubes and measures their voltages. The measurements range from 75 to 99 Volts. A statistician computes the sample mean and a confidence interval for the true mean. Later the statistician discovers that the voltmeter reads only as far as 100 Volts, so technically, the population appears to be “&quot;censored&quot;”. If the statistician is orthodox this necessitates a new analysis.

: However, the engineer says he has another meter reading to 1000 Volts, which he would have used if any voltage had been over 100. This is a relief to the statistician, because it means the population was effectively uncensored after all. But later, the statistician discovers that the second meter had not been working when the measurements were taken. The engineer informs the statistician that he would not have held up the original measurements until the second meter was fixed, and the statistician informs him that new measurements are required. The engineer is astounded. “&quot;Next you&#x27;ll be asking about my oscilloscope!&quot;”

;Throwback to &quot;Example 2&quot; in the prior section:
This story can be translated to Adam&#x27;s stopping rule above, as follows: Adam stopped immediately after 3 successes, because his boss Bill had instructed him to do so. After the publication of the statistical analysis by Bill, Adam realizes that he has missed a later instruction from Bill to instead conduct 12 trials, and that Bill&#x27;s paper is based on this second instruction. Adam is very glad that he got his 3 successes after exactly 12 trials, and explains to his friend Charlotte that by coincidence he executed the second instruction. Later, Adam is astonished to hear about Charlotte&#x27;s letter, explaining that &quot;now&quot; the result is significant.

<doc id="17909" wikidata="Q2331" url="?curid=17909" title="Led Zeppelin">
<text>Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The band comprised Robert Plant (vocals), Jimmy Page (guitar), John Paul Jones (bass and keyboards) and John Bonham (drums). With a heavy, guitar-driven sound and drawing from influences including blues and folk music, Led Zeppelin are cited as a progenitor of hard rock and heavy metal. They significantly influenced the music industry, particularly in the development of album-oriented rock and stadium rock.

Led Zeppelin evolved from a previous band, the Yardbirds and were originally named &quot;the New Yardbirds&quot;. They signed a deal with Atlantic Records that gave them considerable artistic freedom. Initially unpopular with critics, they achieved significant commercial success with eight studio albums over ten years. Their 1969 debut, &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot;, was a top-ten album in several countries and features such tracks as &quot;Good Times Bad Times&quot;, &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; and &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot;. &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; (1969), their first number-one album, includes &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; and &quot;Ramble On&quot;. In 1970, they released &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; which opens with &quot;Immigrant Song&quot;. Their untitled fourth album, commonly known as &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; (1971), is one of the best-selling albums in history, with 37 million copies sold. It includes &quot;Black Dog&quot;, &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; and &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, with the latter being among the most popular and influential works in rock. &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; (1973) includes &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; and &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot;. &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; (1975), a double album, features &quot;Trampled Under Foot&quot; and &quot;Kashmir&quot;.

Page composed most of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s music, while Plant wrote most of the lyrics. Jones occasionally contributed keyboard-focused parts, particularly on the band&#x27;s final album. The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their touring and output, which included &quot;Presence&quot; (1976) and &quot;In Through the Out Door&quot; (1979), declined in the late 1970s. After Bonham&#x27;s death in 1980, the group disbanded. The former members have sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off concerts, including the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in London, with Bonham&#x27;s son Jason Bonham on drums.

Led Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated record sales of between 200 and 300 million units worldwide. They achieved eight consecutive UK number-one albums and six number-one albums on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with five of their albums certified Diamond in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described them as &quot;the heaviest band of all time&quot;, &quot;the biggest band of the seventies&quot;, and &quot;unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history&quot;. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995; the museum&#x27;s biography states that they were &quot;as influential&quot; in the 1970s as the Beatles were in the 1960s.

== History ==
=== Formation: 1966–1968 ===
In 1966, London-based session guitarist Jimmy Page joined the blues-influenced rock band the Yardbirds to replace bassist Paul Samwell-Smith. Page soon switched from bass to lead guitar, creating a dual lead guitar line-up with Jeff Beck. Following Beck&#x27;s departure in October 1966, the Yardbirds became a four-piece with Page as the sole guitarist. This new line-up recorded an album, &quot;Little Games&quot;, in 1967, before embarking on a tour of the United States, during which they performed several songs which would later be part of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s early repertoire, including covers of Johnny Burnette&#x27;s &quot;Train Kept A-Rollin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, a song originally written and recorded by Jake Holmes. In early April 1968, the Yardbirds held a recording session at Columbia Studios in New York City, recording a number of tracks including a Page-Relf composition initially titled &quot;Knowing That I&#x27;m Losing You&quot;, which was eventually re-recorded by Led Zeppelin as &quot;Tangerine&quot;.

The Yardbirds&#x27; 1968 tour proved to be exhausting for the band. Drummer Jim McCarty and vocalist Keith Relf aimed to embark in a more acoustic direction, forming a folk rock duo called Together, whereas Page wanted to continue the heavier blues-based sound of the Yardbirds. Page, with the support of the Yardbirds&#x27; new manager Peter Grant, planned to form a supergroup with Beck and himself on guitars, and the Who&#x27;s Keith Moon and John Entwistle on drums and bass, respectively. Vocalists Steve Winwood and Steve Marriott were also considered for the project. The group never formed, although Page, Beck, and Moon did record a song together in 1966, &quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot;, in a session that also included bassist-keyboardist John Paul Jones.

The Yardbirds played their final gig on 7 July 1968 at Luton College of Technology in Bedfordshire. They were still committed to several concerts in Scandinavia, so McCarty and Relf authorised Page and bassist Chris Dreja to use the Yardbirds&#x27; name to fulfill the band&#x27;s obligations. Page and Dreja began putting a new line-up together. Page&#x27;s first choice for the lead singer was Terry Reid, but Reid declined the offer and suggested Robert Plant, a singer for the Band of Joy and Hobbstweedle. Plant eventually accepted the position, recommending former Band of Joy drummer John Bonham. John Paul Jones enquired about the vacant position of bass guitarist, at the suggestion of his wife, after Dreja dropped out of the project to become a photographer. Page had known Jones since they were both session musicians, and agreed to let him join as the final member.

In August 1968, the four played together for the first time in a room below a record store on Gerrard Street in London. Page suggested that they attempt &quot;Train Kept A-Rollin&#x27;&quot;, originally a jump blues song popularised in a rockabilly version by Johnny Burnette, which had been covered by the Yardbirds. &quot;As soon as I heard John Bonham play&quot;, Jones recalled, &quot;I knew this was going to be great ... We locked together as a team immediately&quot;. Before leaving for Scandinavia, the group took part in a recording session for the P. J. Proby album &quot;Three Week Hero&quot;. The album&#x27;s track &quot;Jim&#x27;s Blues&quot;, with Plant on harmonica, was the first studio track to feature all four future members of Led Zeppelin.

The band completed the Scandinavian tour as the New Yardbirds, playing together for the first time in front of a live audience at Gladsaxe Teen Club at the Egegård School (today Gladsaxe School) festive hall, Gladsaxe, Denmark, on 7 September 1968. Later that month, they began recording their first album, which was based on their live set. The album was recorded and mixed in nine days, and Page covered the costs. After the album&#x27;s completion, the band were forced to change their name after Dreja issued a cease and desist letter, stating that Page was allowed to use the New Yardbirds moniker for the Scandinavian dates only. One account of how the new band&#x27;s name was chosen held that Moon and Entwistle had suggested that a supergroup with Page and Beck would go down like a &quot;lead balloon&quot;, an idiom for being very unsuccessful or unpopular. The group dropped the &#x27;a&#x27; in &quot;lead&quot; at the suggestion of Peter Grant, so that those unfamiliar with the term would not pronounce it &quot;leed&quot;. The word &quot;balloon&quot; was replaced by &quot;zeppelin&quot;, a word which, according to music journalist Keith Shadwick, brought &quot;the perfect combination of heavy and light, combustibility and grace&quot; to Page&#x27;s mind.

Grant secured a $143,000 advance contract ($ today) from Atlantic Records in November 1968—at the time, the biggest deal of its kind for a new band. Atlantic was a label with a catalogue of mainly blues, soul, and jazz artists, but in the late 1960s, it began to take an interest in British progressive rock acts. At the recommendation of British singer Dusty Springfield, a friend of Jones who at the time was completing her first Atlantic album, &quot;Dusty in Memphis&quot;, record executives signed Led Zeppelin without having ever seen them. Under the terms of their contract, the band had autonomy in deciding when they would release albums and tour and had the final say over the contents and design of each album. They would also decide how to promote each release and which tracks to release as singles. They formed their own company, Superhype, to handle all publishing rights.

=== Early years: 1968–1970 ===
Still billed as the New Yardbirds, the band began their first tour of the UK on 4 October 1968, when they played at the Mayfair Ballroom in Newcastle upon Tyne. Their first show as Led Zeppelin was at the University of Surrey in Battersea on 25 October. Tour manager Richard Cole, who would become a major figure in the touring life of the group, organised their first North American tour at the end of the year. Their debut album, &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot;, was released in the US during the tour on 13 January 1969, and peaked at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart; it was released in the UK, where it peaked at number 6, on 31 March. According to Steve Erlewine, the album&#x27;s memorable guitar riffs, lumbering rhythms, psychedelic blues, groovy, bluesy shuffles and hints of English folk music made it &quot;a significant turning point in the evolution of hard rock and heavy metal&quot;.

In their first year, Led Zeppelin completed four US and four UK concert tours, and also released their second album, &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot;. Recorded mostly on the road at various North American studios, it was an even greater commercial success than their first album and reached the number one chart position in the US and the UK. The album further developed the mostly blues-rock musical style established on their debut release, creating a sound that was &quot;heavy and hard, brutal and direct&quot;, and which would be highly influential and frequently imitated. Steve Waksman has suggested that &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; was &quot;the musical starting point for heavy metal&quot;.

The band saw their albums as indivisible, complete listening experiences, disliking the re-editing of existing tracks for release as singles. Grant maintained an aggressive pro-album stance, particularly in the UK, where there were few radio and TV outlets for rock music. Without the band&#x27;s consent, however, some songs were released as singles, particularly in the US. In 1969, an edited version of &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot;, a track from their second album, was released as a single in the US. It reached number four in the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart in January 1970, selling over one million copies and helping to cement the band&#x27;s popularity. The group also increasingly shunned television appearances, citing their preference that their fans hear and see them in live concerts.

Following the release of their second album, Led Zeppelin completed several more US tours. They played initially in clubs and ballrooms, and then in larger auditoriums as their popularity grew. Some early Led Zeppelin concerts lasted more than four hours, with expanded and improvised live versions of their repertoire. Many of these shows have been preserved as bootleg recordings. It was during this period of intensive concert touring that the band developed a reputation for off-stage excess.

In 1970, Page and Plant retired to Bron-Yr-Aur, a remote cottage in Wales, to commence work on their third album, &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot;. The result was a more acoustic style that was strongly influenced by folk and Celtic music, and showcased the band&#x27;s versatility. The album&#x27;s rich acoustic sound initially received mixed reactions, with critics and fans surprised at the turn from the primarily electric arrangements of the first two albums, further fuelling the band&#x27;s hostility to the musical press. It reached number one in the UK and US charts, but its stay would be the shortest of their first five albums. The album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;Immigrant Song&quot;, was released as a US single in November 1970 against the band&#x27;s wishes, reaching the top twenty on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart.

Page played his 1959 Dragon Telecaster until a friend stripped Page&#x27;s custom modifications and repainted the guitar. From 1969 on the mahogany &quot;Number 1&quot; Les Paul has been Page&#x27;s main guitar.

=== &quot;The Biggest Band in the World&quot;: 1970–1975 ===
During the 1970s, Led Zeppelin reached new heights of commercial and critical success that made them one of the most influential groups of the era, eclipsing their earlier achievements. The band&#x27;s image also changed as the members began to wear elaborate, flamboyant clothing, with Page taking the lead on the flamboyant appearance by wearing a glittering moon-and-stars outfit. Led Zeppelin changed their show by using things such as lasers, professional light shows and mirror balls. They began travelling in a private jet airliner, a Boeing 720 (nicknamed &quot;the Starship&quot;), rented out entire sections of hotels (including the Continental Hyatt House in Los Angeles, known colloquially as the &quot;Riot House&quot;), and became the subject of frequently repeated stories of debauchery. One involved John Bonham riding a motorcycle through a rented floor of the Riot House, while another involved the destruction of a room in the Tokyo Hilton, leading to the group being banned from that establishment for life. Although Led Zeppelin developed a reputation for trashing their hotel suites and throwing television sets out of the windows, some suggest that these tales have been exaggerated. According to music journalist Chris Welch, &quot;[Led Zeppelin&#x27;s] travels spawned many stories, but it was a myth that [they] were constantly engaged in acts of wanton destruction and lewd behaviour&quot;.
Led Zeppelin released their fourth album on 8 November 1971. It is variously referred to as &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;, &quot;Untitled&quot;, &quot;IV&quot;, or, due to the four symbols appearing on the record label, as &quot;Four Symbols&quot;, &quot;Zoso&quot; or &quot;Runes&quot;. The band had wanted to release the fourth album with no title or information, in response to the music press &quot;going on about Zeppelin being a hype&quot;, but the record company wanted something on the cover, so in discussions, it was agreed to have four symbols to represent both the four members of the band and that it was the fourth album. With 37 million copies sold, &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; is one of the best-selling albums in history, and its massive popularity cemented Led Zeppelin&#x27;s status as superstars in the 1970s. By 2021, it had sold 24 million copies in the United States alone. The track &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, never released as a single, was the most requested and most played song on American rock radio in the 1970s. The group followed up the album&#x27;s release with tours of the UK, Australasia, North America, Japan, and the UK again from late 1971 through early 1973.
Led Zeppelin&#x27;s next album, &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot;, was released in March 1973. It featured further experimentation by the band, who expanded their use of synthesisers and mellotron orchestration. The predominantly orange album cover, designed by the London-based design group Hipgnosis, depicts images of nude children climbing the Giant&#x27;s Causeway in Northern Ireland. Although the children are not shown from the front, the cover was controversial at the time of the album&#x27;s release. As with the band&#x27;s fourth album, neither their name nor the album title was printed on the sleeve.

&quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; topped charts worldwide, and the band&#x27;s subsequent concert tour of North America in 1973 broke records for attendance, as they consistently filled large auditoriums and stadiums. At Tampa Stadium in Florida, they played to 56,800 fans, breaking the record set by the Beatles&#x27; 1965 Shea Stadium concert and grossing $309,000. Three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City were filmed for a motion picture, but the theatrical release of this project (&quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;) was delayed until 1976. Before the final night&#x27;s performance, $180,000 ($ today) of the band&#x27;s money from gate receipts was stolen from a safe deposit box at the Drake Hotel.
In 1974, Led Zeppelin took a break from touring and launched their own record label, Swan Song, named after an unreleased song. The record label&#x27;s logo is based on a drawing called &quot;Evening: Fall of Day&quot; (1869) by William Rimmer. The drawing features a figure of a winged human-like being interpreted as either Apollo or Icarus. The logo can be found on Led Zeppelin memorabilia, especially T-shirts. In addition to using Swan Song as a vehicle to promote their own albums, the band expanded the label&#x27;s roster, signing artists such as Bad Company, the Pretty Things and Maggie Bell. The label was successful while Led Zeppelin existed, but folded less than three years after they disbanded.

In 1975, Led Zeppelin&#x27;s double album &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; was their first release on the Swan Song label. It consisted of fifteen songs, of which eight had been recorded at Headley Grange in 1974 and seven had been recorded earlier. A review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine referred to &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; as Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;bid for artistic respectability&quot;, adding that the only bands Led Zeppelin had to compete with for the title &quot;The World&#x27;s Best Rock Band&quot; were the Rolling Stones and the Who. The album was a massive commercial and critical success. Shortly after the release of &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot;, all previous Led Zeppelin albums simultaneously re-entered the top-200 album chart, and the band embarked on another North American tour, now employing sophisticated sound and lighting systems. In May 1975, Led Zeppelin played five sold-out nights at the Earls Court Arena in London, at the time the largest arena in Britain.

=== Hiatus from touring and return: 1975–1977 ===
Following their triumphant Earls Court appearances, Led Zeppelin took a holiday and planned an autumn tour in America, scheduled to open with two outdoor dates in San Francisco. In August 1975, however, Plant and his wife Maureen were involved in a serious car crash while on holiday in Rhodes, Greece. Plant suffered a broken ankle and Maureen was badly injured; a blood transfusion saved her life. Unable to tour, he headed to the Channel Island of Jersey to spend August and September recuperating, with Bonham and Page in tow. The band then reconvened in Malibu, California. During this forced hiatus, much of the material for their next album, &quot;Presence&quot;, was written.

By this time, Led Zeppelin were the world&#x27;s number one rock attraction, having outsold most bands of the time, including the Rolling Stones. &quot;Presence&quot;, released in March 1976, marked a change in the Led Zeppelin sound towards more straightforward, guitar-based jams, departing from the acoustic ballads and intricate arrangements featured on their previous albums. Though it was a platinum seller, &quot;Presence&quot; received a mixed reaction among fans and the music press, with some critics suggesting that the band&#x27;s excesses may have caught up with them. Page had begun using heroin during recording sessions for the album, a habit which may have affected the band&#x27;s later live shows and studio recordings, although he has since denied this.

Because of Plant&#x27;s injuries, Led Zeppelin did not tour in 1976. Instead, the band completed the concert film &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; and the accompanying soundtrack album. The film premiered in New York City on 20 October 1976, but was given a lukewarm reception by critics and fans. The film was particularly unsuccessful in the UK, where, unwilling to tour since 1975 because of their tax exile status, Led Zeppelin faced an uphill battle to recapture the public&#x27;s affection.

In 1977, Led Zeppelin embarked on another major concert tour of North America. The band set another attendance record, with an audience of 76,229 at their Silverdome concert on 30 April. It was, according to the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;, the largest attendance to that date for a single act show. Although the tour was financially profitable, it was beset by off-stage problems. On 19 April, over 70 people were arrested as about 1,000 fans tried to gatecrash Cincinnati Riverfront Coliseum for two sold-out concerts, while others tried to gain entry by throwing rocks and bottles through glass doors. On 3 June, a concert at Tampa Stadium was cut short because of a severe thunderstorm, despite tickets indicating &quot;Rain or Shine&quot;. A riot broke out, resulting in arrests and injuries.

After 23 July show at the Day on the Green festival at the Oakland Coliseum in Oakland, California, Bonham and members of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s support staff were arrested after a member of promoter Bill Graham&#x27;s staff was badly beaten during the band&#x27;s performance. The following day&#x27;s second Oakland concert was the group&#x27;s final live appearance in the United States. Two days later, as they checked in at a French Quarter hotel for their 30 July performance at the Louisiana Superdome, Plant received news that his five-year-old son, Karac, had died from a stomach virus. The rest of the tour was immediately cancelled, prompting widespread speculation about Led Zeppelin&#x27;s future.
=== Bonham&#x27;s death and break-up: 1978–1980 ===
In November 1978, the group recorded at Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. The resulting album, &quot;In Through the Out Door&quot;, featured sonic experimentation that again drew mixed reactions from critics. Nevertheless, the album reached number one in the UK and the US in just its second week of release. With this album&#x27;s release, Led Zeppelin&#x27;s entire catalogue returned to the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 in the weeks of 27 October and 3 November 1979.

In August 1979, after two warm-up shows in Copenhagen, Led Zeppelin headlined two concerts at the Knebworth Music Festival, playing to a crowd of approximately 104,000 on the first night. A brief, low-key European tour was undertaken in June and July 1980, featuring a stripped-down set without the usual lengthy jams and solos. On 27 June, at a show in Nuremberg, West Germany, the concert came to an abrupt halt in the middle of the third song, when Bonham collapsed onstage and was rushed to hospital. Speculation in the press suggested that his collapse had been the result of excessive alcohol and drug use, but the band claimed that he had simply overeaten.

A North American tour, the band&#x27;s first since 1977, was scheduled to commence on 17 October 1980. On 24 September, Bonham was picked up by Led Zeppelin assistant Rex King to attend rehearsals at Bray Studios. During the journey, Bonham asked to stop for breakfast, where he downed four quadruple vodkas (from ), with a ham roll. After taking a bite of the ham roll he said to his assistant, &quot;breakfast&quot;. He continued to drink heavily after arriving at the studio. The rehearsals were halted late that evening and the band retired to Page&#x27;s house—the Old Mill House in Clewer, Windsor.

After midnight, Bonham, who had fallen asleep, was taken to bed and placed on his side. At 1:45 pm the next day, Benji LeFevre (Led Zeppelin&#x27;s new tour manager) and John Paul Jones found Bonham dead. The cause of death was asphyxiation from vomit; the finding was accidental death. An autopsy found no other recreational drugs in Bonham&#x27;s body. Although he had recently begun to take Motival (a cocktail of the antipsychotic fluphenazine and the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline) to combat his anxiety, it is unclear if these substances interacted with the alcohol in his system. Bonham&#x27;s remains were cremated and his ashes interred on 12 October 1980, at Rushock parish church, Worcestershire.

The planned North American tour was cancelled, and despite rumours that Cozy Powell, Carmine Appice, Barriemore Barlow, Simon Kirke, Ric Lee or Bev Bevan would join the group as his replacement, the remaining members decided to disband. A 4 December 1980 press statement stated that, &quot;We wish it to be known that the loss of our dear friend, and the deep sense of undivided harmony felt by ourselves and our manager, have led us to decide that we could not continue as we were.&quot; The statement was signed simply &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot;.

=== Post-breakup ===
==== 1980s ====
Following Led Zeppelin&#x27;s dissolution, the first significant musical project by one of its members was the Honeydrippers, which Plant initially formed in 1981. The group, featuring Page on lead guitar, along with studio musicians and friends of the pair, including Jeff Beck, Paul Shaffer, and Nile Rodgers, released its only album in 1984. Plant focused on a different direction from Zeppelin, playing standards and in a more R&amp;B style, highlighted by a cover of &quot;Sea of Love&quot; that peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart in early 1985.

The studio album &quot;Coda&quot; – a collection of Zeppelin outtakes and unused tracks – was issued in November 1982. It included two tracks from the Royal Albert Hall in 1970, one each from the &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; and &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; sessions, and three from the &quot;In Through the Out Door&quot; sessions. It also featured a 1976 Bonham drum instrumental with electronic effects added by Page, called &quot;Bonzo&#x27;s Montreux&quot;.

On 13 July 1985, Page, Plant, and Jones reunited for the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia, playing a short set featuring drummers Tony Thompson and Phil Collins, and bassist Paul Martinez. Collins had contributed to Plant&#x27;s first two solo albums while Martinez was a member of Plant&#x27;s solo band. The performance was marred by a lack of rehearsal with the two drummers, Page&#x27;s struggles with an out-of-tune guitar, poorly functioning monitors, and Plant&#x27;s hoarse voice. Page described the performance as &quot;pretty shambolic&quot;, while Plant characterised it as an &quot;atrocity&quot;.

The three members reunited again on 14 May 1988, for the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert, with Bonham&#x27;s son Jason on drums. The result was again disjointed: Plant and Page had argued immediately prior to taking the stage about whether to play &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, and Jones&#x27; keyboards were absent from the live television feed. Page described the performance as &quot;one big disappointment&quot; and Plant said &quot;the gig was foul&quot;.

==== 1990s ====
The first Led Zeppelin box set, featuring tracks remastered under Page&#x27;s supervision, was released in 1990 and bolstered the band&#x27;s reputation, leading to abortive discussions among members about a reunion. This set included four previously unreleased tracks, including a version of Robert Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Travelling Riverside Blues&quot;. The song peaked at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Led Zeppelin Boxed Set 2&quot; was released in 1993; the two box sets together contained all known studio recordings, as well as some rare live tracks.

In 1994, Page and Plant reunited for a 90-minute &quot;UnLedded&quot; MTV project. They later released an album called &quot;No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded&quot;, which featured some reworked Led Zeppelin songs, and embarked on a world tour the following year. This is said to be the beginning of a rift between the band members, as Jones was not even told of the reunion.

In 1995, Led Zeppelin were inducted into the United States Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Steven Tyler and Joe Perry of Aerosmith. Jason and Zoë Bonham also attended, representing their late father. At the induction ceremony, the band&#x27;s inner rift became apparent when Jones joked upon accepting his award, &quot;Thank you, my friends, for finally remembering my phone number&quot;, causing consternation and awkward looks from Page and Plant. Afterwards, they played one brief set with Tyler and Perry, with Jason Bonham on drums, and then a second with Neil Young, this time with Michael Lee playing the drums.

In 1997, Atlantic released a single edit of &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; in the US and the UK, the only single the band released in their homeland, where it peaked at number 21. November 1997 saw the release of &quot;Led Zeppelin BBC Sessions&quot;, a two-disc set largely recorded in 1969 and 1971. Page and Plant released another album called &quot;Walking into Clarksdale&quot; in 1998, featuring all new material, but after disappointing sales, the partnership dissolved before a planned Australian tour.

==== 2000s ====
The year 2003 saw the release of the triple live album &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;, and &quot;Led Zeppelin DVD&quot;, a six-hour chronological set of live footage that became the best-selling music DVD in history. In July 2007, Atlantic/Rhino and Warner Home Video announced three Zeppelin titles to be released that November: &quot;Mothership&quot;, a 24-track best-of spanning the band&#x27;s career; a reissue of the soundtrack &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;, including previously unreleased material; and a new DVD. Zeppelin also made their catalogue legally available for download, becoming one of the last major rock bands to do so.

On 10 December 2007, Zeppelin reunited for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at the O2 Arena in London, with Jason Bonham again taking his father&#x27;s place on drums. According to &quot;Guinness World Records 2009&quot;, the show set a record for the &quot;Highest Demand for Tickets for One Music Concert&quot; as 20 million requests were submitted online. Critics praised the performance and there was widespread speculation about a full reunion. Page, Jones and Jason Bonham were reported to be willing to tour and to be working on material for a new Zeppelin project. Plant continued his touring commitments with Alison Krauss, stating in September 2008 that he would not record or tour with the band. &quot;I told them I was busy and they&#x27;d simply have to wait,&quot; he recalled in 2014. &quot;I would come around eventually, which they were fine with – at least to my knowledge. But it turns out they weren&#x27;t. And what&#x27;s even more disheartening, Jimmy used it against me.&quot;

Jones and Page reportedly looked for a replacement for Plant; candidates including Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, and Myles Kennedy of Alter Bridge. However, in January 2009, it was confirmed that the project had been abandoned. &quot;Getting the opportunity to play with Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and Jason Bonham was pretty special,&quot; Kennedy recalled. &quot;That is pretty much the zenith right there. That was a crazy, good experience. It&#x27;s something I still think of often ... It&#x27;s so precious to me.&quot;

==== 2010s ====
A film of the O2 performance, &quot;Celebration Day&quot;, premiered on 17 October 2012 and was released on DVD on 19 November. The film grossed $2 million in one night, and the live album peaked at number 4 and 9 in the UK and US, respectively. Following the film&#x27;s premiere, Page revealed that he had been remastering the band&#x27;s discography. The first wave of albums, &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot;, &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot;, and &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot;, were released on 2 June 2014. The second wave of albums, &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; and &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot;, were released on 27 October 2014. &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; was released on 23 February 2015, almost exactly forty years to the day after the original release. The fourth and final wave of studio album reissues, &quot;Presence&quot;, &quot;In Through the Out Door&quot;, and &quot;Coda&quot;, were released on 31 July 2015.

Through this remastering project, each studio album was reissued on CD and vinyl and was also available in a Deluxe Edition, which contained a bonus disc of previously unheard material (&quot;Coda&quot;″s Deluxe Edition would include two bonus discs). Each album was also available in a Super Deluxe Edition Box Set, which included the remastered album and bonus disc on both CD and 180-gram vinyl, a high-definition audio download card of all content at 96 kHz/24 bit, a hardbound book filled with rare and previously unseen photos and memorabilia, and a high-quality print of the original album cover.

On 6 November 2015, the &quot;Mothership&quot; compilation was reissued using the band&#x27;s newly remastered audio tracks. The reissuing campaign continued the next year with the re-release of &quot;BBC Sessions&quot; on 16 September 2016. The reissue contained a bonus disc with nine unreleased BBC recordings, including the heavily bootlegged but never officially released &quot;Sunshine Woman&quot;.

To commemorate the band&#x27;s 50th anniversary, Page, Plant and Jones announced an official illustrated book celebrating 50 years since the formation of the band. Also released for the celebration was a reissue of &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; on 23 March 2018, which includes the album&#x27;s first pressing on vinyl. For Record Store Day on 21 April 2018, Led Zeppelin released a 7&quot; single &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; (Sunset Sound Mix)/&quot;Friends&quot; (Olympic Studio Mix), their first single in 21 years.

==== 2020s ====
In October 2020, Page released a photo collection called &quot;Jimmy Page: The Anthology&quot;, confirming a band documentary for the band&#x27;s 50th anniversary. A work-in-progress version of the documentary film &quot;Becoming Led Zeppelin&quot; was screened at the Venice Film Festival in 2021. It is the first time band members have agreed to participate in a biographical documentary. It was announced the film would premiere in IMAX in the United States on 7 February 2025.

== Musical style ==

Led Zeppelin&#x27;s music was rooted in the blues. The influence of American blues artists such as Muddy Waters and Skip James was particularly apparent on their first two albums, as was the distinct country blues style of Howlin&#x27; Wolf. There were tracks structured around the twelve-bar blues on every studio album except for one, and the blues directly and indirectly influenced other songs both musically and lyrically. The band were also strongly influenced by the music of the British, Celtic, and American folk revivals. Scottish folk guitarist Bert Jansch helped inspire Page, and from him he adapted open tunings and aggressive strokes into his playing. The band also drew on a wide variety of genres, including world music, and elements of early rock and roll, jazz, country, funk, soul, and reggae, particularly on &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; and the albums that followed.

The material on the first two albums was largely constructed out of extended jams of blues standards and folk songs. This method led to the mixing of musical and lyrical elements of different songs and versions, as well as improvised passages, to create new material, but would lead to later accusations of plagiarism and legal disputes over copyright. Usually the music was developed first, sometimes with improvised lyrics that might then be rewritten for the final version of the song. From the visit to Bron-Yr-Aur in 1970, the songwriting partnership between Page and Plant became predominant, with Page supplying the music, largely via his acoustic guitar, and Plant emerging as the band&#x27;s chief lyricist. Jones and Bonham then added to the material, in rehearsal or in the studio, as a song was developed. In the later stages of the band&#x27;s career, Page took a back seat in composition and Jones became increasingly important in producing music, often composed on the keyboard. Plant would then add lyrics before Page and Bonham developed their parts.
Early lyrics drew on the band&#x27;s blues and folk roots, often mixing lyrical fragments from different songs. Many of the band&#x27;s songs dealt with themes of romance, unrequited love and sexual conquest, which were common in rock, pop and blues music. Some of their lyrics, especially those derived from the blues, have been interpreted as misogynistic. Particularly on &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot;, they incorporated elements of mythology and mysticism into their music, which largely grew out of Plant&#x27;s interest in legends and history. These elements were often taken to reflect Page&#x27;s interest in the occult, which resulted in accusations that the recordings contained subliminal satanic messages, some of which were said to be contained in backmasking; these claims were generally dismissed by the band and music critics. The pastoral fantasies in Plant&#x27;s songwriting were inspired by the landscape of the Black Country region and J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s high fantasy novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Susan Fast argues that as Plant emerged as the band&#x27;s main lyricist, the songs more obviously reflected his alignment with the West Coast counterculture of the 1960s. In the later part of the band&#x27;s career Plant&#x27;s lyrics became more autobiographical, and less optimistic, drawing on his own experiences and circumstances.

According to musicologist Robert Walser, &quot;Led Zeppelin&#x27;s sound was marked by speed and power, unusual rhythmic patterns, contrasting terraced dynamics, singer Robert Plant&#x27;s wailing vocals, and guitarist Jimmy Page&#x27;s heavily distorted crunch&quot;. These elements mean that they are often cited as one of the originators of hard rock and heavy metal and they have been described as the &quot;definitive heavy metal band&quot;, although the band members have often eschewed the label.Led Zeppelin, together with Deep Purple and Black Sabbath, have been referred to as the &quot;unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid- seventies&quot;. Part of this reputation depends on the band&#x27;s use of distorted guitar riffs on songs like &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; and &quot;The Wanton Song&quot;. Often riffs were not doubled by guitar, bass and drums exactly, but instead there were melodic or rhythmic variations. Page&#x27;s guitar playing incorporated elements of the blues scale with those of eastern music. Plant&#x27;s use of high-pitched shrieks has been compared to Janis Joplin&#x27;s vocal technique. Robert Christgau found him integral to the group&#x27;s heavy &quot;power blues&quot; aesthetic, functioning as a &quot;mechanical effect&quot; similarly to Page&#x27;s guitar parts. While noting Plant &quot;hints at real feeling&quot; on some of their acoustic songs, Christgau believed he abandoned traditional blues singing&#x27;s emphasis on emotional projection in favour of vocal precision and dynamics: &quot;Whether he is mouthing sexist blues cliches or running through one of the band&#x27;s half-audible, half-comprehensible ... lyrics about chivalry or the counter-culture, his voice is devoid of feeling. Like the tenors and baritones of yore, he wants his voice to be an instrument—specifically, an electric guitar.&quot; Bonham&#x27;s drumming was noted for its power, his rapid rolls and his fast beats on a single bass drum; while Jones&#x27; basslines have been described as melodic and his keyboard playing added a classical touch to the band&#x27;s sound.

Led Zeppelin have been widely viewed as a hard rock band, although Christgau regarded them as art rock as well. According to popular music scholar Reebee Garofalo, &quot;because hip critics could not find a constructive way of positioning themselves in relation to Led Zeppelin&#x27;s ultra-macho presentation, they were excluded from the art rock category despite their broad range of influences.&quot; Christgau wrote in 1972, the band could be considered art rock because they &quot;relate to rock and roll not organically but intellectually&quot;, idealising the &quot;amplified beat&quot; as &quot;a kind of formal challenge&quot;. Unlike their contemporaries in Jethro Tull and Yes, who use &quot;the physical compulsion of beat and volume to involve the mind&quot;, Led Zeppelin &quot;make body music of an oddly cerebral cast, arousing aggression rather than sexuality.&quot; As such, along with other second-generation English hard rock bands like Black Sabbath and Mott the Hoople, they can attract both intellectuals and working-class youths in &quot;a strange potential double audience.&quot; Years later, &quot;In Through the Out Door&quot;″s &quot;tuneful synthesizer pomp&quot; further confirmed for Christgau they were an art rock band.

Page stated that he wanted Led Zeppelin to produce music that had &quot;light and shade&quot;. This began to be more clearly realised beginning with &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot;, which made greater use of acoustic instruments. This approach has been seen as exemplified in the fourth album, particularly on &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, which begins with acoustic guitar and recorder and ends with drums and heavy electric sounds. Towards the end of their recording career, they moved to a more mellow and progressive sound, dominated by Jones&#x27; keyboard motifs. They also increasingly made use of various layering and production techniques, including multi-tracking and overdubbed guitar parts. Their emphasis on the sense of dynamics and ensemble arrangement has been seen as producing an individualistic style that transcends any single music genre. Ian Peddie argues that they were &quot;... loud, powerful and often heavy, but their music was also humorous, self-reflective and extremely subtle&quot;.

== Legacy ==

Led Zeppelin is widely regarded as one of the most successful, innovative, and influential bands in the history of rock music. Rock critic Mikal Gilmore said, &quot;Led Zeppelin—talented, complex, grasping, beautiful and dangerous—made one of the most enduring bodies of composition and performance in twentieth-century music, despite everything they had to overpower, including themselves&quot;.

Led Zeppelin have influenced hard rock and heavy metal bands such as Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Rush, Queen, Scorpions, Aerosmith, the Black Crowes, and Megadeth as well as progressive metal bands like Tool and Dream Theater. Jeff Mezydlo of Yardbarker wrote, &quot;While Black Sabbath and Deep Purple also influenced a hard, guitar-driven sound that opened the door for the heavy metal movement, Zeppelin did it better than anybody.&quot; The band also influenced some early punk and post-punk bands, among them the Ramones, Joy Division and the Cult. They were also an important influence on the development of alternative rock, as bands adapted elements from the &quot;Zeppelin sound&quot; of the mid-1970s, including the Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. Bands and artists from diverse genres have acknowledged the influence of Led Zeppelin, such as Madonna, Shakira, Lady Gaga, Kesha, and Katie Melua.
Led Zeppelin have been credited with a major impact on the nature of the music business, particularly in the development of album-oriented rock (AOR) and stadium rock. In 1988 John Kalodner, then-A&amp;R executive of Geffen Records, remarked: &quot;Next to the Beatles they&#x27;re the most influential band in history. They influence the way music is on records, AOR radio, concerts. They set the standards for the AOR-radio format with &#x27;Stairway to Heaven,&#x27; having AOR hits without necessarily having Top 40 hits. They&#x27;re the ones who did the first real big arena concert shows, consistently selling out and playing stadiums without support. People can do as well as them, but nobody surpasses them.&quot;
Andrew Loog Oldham, the former producer and manager of the Rolling Stones, commented on how Led Zeppelin had a major influence on the record business, and the way rock concerts were managed and presented to huge audiences. In 2007, they were a featured artist in the stadium rock episode of the BBC/VH1 series &quot;Seven Ages of Rock&quot;.

The band have sold over 200 million albums worldwide according to some sources, while others state that they have sold in excess of 300 million records, including 111.5 million certified units in the United States. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, Led Zeppelin are the third-highest-selling band, the fifth highest selling music act in the US, and one of only four acts to earn five or more Diamond albums. They achieved eight consecutive number-ones on the UK Albums Chart, a record for most consecutive UK number-one albums shared with ABBA. Led Zeppelin remain one of the most bootlegged artists in the history of rock music.

Led Zeppelin also made a significant cultural impact. Jim Miller, editor of &quot;Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, argues that &quot;on one level, Led Zeppelin represents the final flowering of the sixties&#x27; psychedelic ethic, which casts rock as passive sensory involvement&quot;. Led Zeppelin have also been described as &quot;the quintessential purveyors&quot; of masculine and aggressive &quot;cock rock&quot;, although this assertion has been challenged. The band&#x27;s fashion-sense has been seminal; Simeon Lipman, head of pop culture at Christie&#x27;s auction house, has commented that &quot;Led Zeppelin have had a big influence on fashion because the whole aura surrounding them is so cool, and people want a piece of that&quot;. Led Zeppelin laid the foundation for the big hair of the 1980s glam metal bands such as Mötley Crüe and Skid Row. Other musicians have also adapted elements from Led Zeppelin&#x27;s attitude to clothes, jewellery and hair, such as the hipster flares and tight band T-shirts of Kings of Leon, shaggy hair, clingy T-shirts and bluesman hair of Jack White of the White Stripes, and Kasabian guitarist Sergio Pizzorno&#x27;s silk scarves, trilbies and side-laced tight jeans.

== Achievements ==
Led Zeppelin have collected many honours and awards throughout the course of their career. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006. Among the band&#x27;s awards are an American Music Award in 2005, and the Polar Music Prize in 2006. Led Zeppelin were the recipient of a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005, and four of their recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. They have been awarded five Diamond albums, as well as fourteen Multi-Platinum, four Platinum and one Gold album in the United States, while in the UK they have five Multi-Platinum, six Platinum, one Gold and four Silver albums. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named Led Zeppelin the 14th-greatest artist of all time in 2004.

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list included &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot; at number 29, &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; at number 66, &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; at number 70, &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; at number 75, and &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; at number 149. And in 2004, on their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; at number 31, &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; at number 75, &quot;Kashmir&quot; at number 140, &quot;Black Dog&quot; at number 294, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; at number 320, and &quot;Ramble On&quot; at number 433.

In 2005, Page was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in recognition of his charity work, and in 2009 Plant was honoured as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to popular music. The band are ranked number one on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot; and &quot;Classic Rock&quot;″s &quot;50 best live acts of all time&quot;. They were named as the best Rock band in a poll by BBC Radio 2. They were awarded an Ivor Novello Award for &quot;Outstanding Contribution to British Music&quot; in 1977, as well as a &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; at the 42nd Annual Ivor Novello awards ceremony in 1997. The band were honoured at the 2008 MOJO Awards with the &quot;Best Live Act&quot; prize for their one-off reunion, and were described as the &quot;greatest rock and roll band of all time&quot;. In 2010, &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; was one of ten classic album covers from British artists commemorated on a UK postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail; they were unveiled by Jimmy Page. Led Zeppelin were named as 2012 recipients of the Kennedy Center Honors.
