<text>Jürgen Habermas ( , ; ; born 18 June 1929) is a German philosopher and social theorist in the tradition of critical theory and pragmatism. His work addresses communicative rationality and the public sphere.

Associated with the Frankfurt School, Habermas&#x27;s work focuses on the foundations of epistemology and social theory, the analysis of advanced capitalism and democracy, the rule of law in a critical social-evolutionary context, albeit within the confines of the natural law tradition, and contemporary politics, particularly German politics. Habermas&#x27;s theoretical system is devoted to revealing the possibility of reason, emancipation, and rational-critical communication latent in modern institutions and in the human capacity to deliberate and pursue rational interests. Habermas is known for his work on the phenomenon of modernity, particularly with respect to the discussions of rationalization originally set forth by Max Weber. He has been influenced by American pragmatism, action theory, and poststructuralism.

==Biography==
Habermas was born in Düsseldorf, Rhine Province, in 1929. He was born with a cleft palate and had corrective surgery twice during childhood. Habermas argues that his speech disability made him think differently about the importance of deep dependence and of communication. He grew up in Gummersbach.

As a young teenager, he was profoundly affected by World War II. Until his graduation from grammar school, Habermas lived in Gummersbach, near Cologne. His father, Ernst Habermas, was executive director of the Cologne Chamber of Industry and Commerce, and was described by Habermas as a Nazi sympathizer and, from 1933, a member of the Nazi Party NSDAP. Habermas himself was a &quot;Jungvolkführer&quot;, a leader of the German Jungvolk, which was a section of the Hitler Youth. He was brought up in a staunchly Protestant milieu, his grandfather being the director of the seminary in Gummersbach. He studied at the universities of Göttingen (1949/50), Zurich (1950/51), and Bonn (1951–54) and earned a doctorate in philosophy from Bonn in 1954 with a dissertation written on the conflict between &quot;the Absolute&quot; and history in Schelling&#x27;s thought, entitled, &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Absolute and History: On the Schism in Schelling&#x27;s Thought&quot;). His dissertation committee included Erich Rothacker and Oskar Becker.

From 1956 on, he studied philosophy and sociology under the critical theorists Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno at the Goethe University Frankfurt&#x27;s Institute for Social Research, but because of a rift between the two over his dissertation—Horkheimer had made unacceptable demands for revision—as well as his own belief that the Frankfurt School had become paralyzed with political skepticism and disdain for modern culture, he finished his habilitation in political science at the University of Marburg under the Marxist Wolfgang Abendroth. His habilitation work was entitled &quot;&quot; (published in English translation in 1989 as &quot;The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society&quot;). It is a detailed social history of the development of the bourgeois public sphere from its origins in the 18th century salons up to its transformation through the influence of capital-driven mass media. In 1961 he became a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; in Marburg, and—in a move that was highly unusual for the German academic scene of that time—he was offered the position of &quot;extraordinary professor&quot; (professor without chair) of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg (at the instigation of Hans-Georg Gadamer and Karl Löwith) in 1962, which he accepted. In this same year he gained his first serious public attention, in Germany, with the publication of his habilitation. In 1964, strongly supported by Adorno, Habermas returned to Frankfurt to take over Horkheimer&#x27;s chair in philosophy and sociology. The philosopher Albrecht Wellmer was his assistant in Frankfurt from 1966 to 1970.

He accepted the position of Director of the Max Planck Institute for the Study of the Scientific-Technical World in Starnberg (near Munich) in 1971, and worked there until 1983, two years after the publication of his magnum opus, &quot;The Theory of Communicative Action&quot;. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1984.

Habermas then returned to his chair at Frankfurt and the directorship of the Institute for Social Research. Since retiring from Frankfurt in 1993, Habermas has continued to publish extensively. In 1986, he received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the , which is the highest honour awarded in German research. He also holds the position of &quot;permanent visiting&quot; professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and &quot;Theodor Heuss Professor&quot; at The New School, New York.

Habermas was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award in Social Sciences of 2003. Habermas was also the 2004 Kyoto Laureate in the Arts and Philosophy section. He traveled to San Diego and on 5 March 2005, as part of the University of San Diego&#x27;s Kyoto Symposium, gave a speech entitled &quot;The Public Role of Religion in Secular Context&quot;, regarding the evolution of separation of church and state from neutrality to intense secularism. He received the 2005 Holberg International Memorial Prize (about €520,000). In 2007, Habermas was listed as the seventh most-cited author in the humanities (including the social sciences) by &quot;The Times Higher Education Guide&quot;, ahead of Max Weber and behind Erving Goffman. Bibliometric studies demonstrate his continuing influence and increasing relevance.

Jürgen Habermas was the father of Rebekka Habermas (1959–2023), historian of German social and cultural history and professor of modern history at the University of Göttingen.

===Teacher and mentor===
Habermas was a famed teacher and mentor. Among his most prominent students were the pragmatic philosopher Herbert Schnädelbach (theorist of discourse distinction and rationality), the political sociologist Claus Offe (professor at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin), the social philosopher Johann Arnason (professor at La Trobe University and chief editor of the journal &quot;Thesis Eleven&quot;), the social philosopher Hans-Herbert Kögler (Chair of Philosophy at the University of North Florida), the sociological theorist Hans Joas (professor at the University of Erfurt and at the University of Chicago), the theorist of societal evolution Klaus Eder, the social philosopher Axel Honneth, the political theorist David Rasmussen (professor at Boston College and chief editor of the journal &quot;Philosophy &amp; Social Criticism&quot;), the environmental ethicist Konrad Ott, the anarcho-capitalist philosopher Hans-Hermann Hoppe (who came to reject much of Habermas&#x27;s thought), the American philosopher Thomas McCarthy, the co-creator of mindful inquiry in social research Jeremy J. Shapiro, the political philosopher Cristina Lafont (Harold H. and Virginia Anderson Professor of Philosophy at Northwestern University), and the assassinated Serbian prime minister Zoran Đinđić.

==Philosophy and social theory==
Habermas has constructed a comprehensive framework of philosophy and social theory drawing on a number of intellectual traditions:
* the German philosophical thought of Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Schelling, G. W. F. Hegel, Wilhelm Dilthey, Edmund Husserl and Hans-Georg Gadamer
* the Marxian tradition—both the theory of Karl Marx himself as well as the critical neo-Marxian theory of the Frankfurt School, i.e. Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno and Herbert Marcuse.
* the sociological theories of Max Weber, Émile Durkheim and George Herbert Mead
* the linguistic philosophy and speech act theories of Ludwig Wittgenstein, J. L. Austin, P. F. Strawson, Stephen Toulmin and John Searle
* the developmental psychology of Jean Piaget and Lawrence Kohlberg
* the American pragmatist tradition of Charles Sanders Peirce and John Dewey
* the sociological social systems theory of Talcott Parsons and Niklas Luhmann
* Neo-Kantian thought

Jürgen Habermas considers his major contribution to be the development of the concept and theory of communicative reason or communicative rationality, which distinguishes itself from the rationalist tradition, by locating rationality in structures of interpersonal linguistic communication rather than in the structure of the cosmos. This social theory advances the goals of human emancipation, while maintaining an inclusive universalist moral framework. This framework rests on the argument called universal pragmatics—that all speech acts have an inherent telos (the Greek word for &quot;purpose&quot;)—the goal of mutual understanding, and that human beings possess the communicative competence to bring about such understanding. Habermas built the framework out of the speech-act philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein, J. L. Austin and John Searle, the sociological theory of the interactional constitution of mind and self of George Herbert Mead, the theories of moral development of Jean Piaget and Lawrence Kohlberg, and the discourse ethics of his Frankfurt colleague and fellow student Karl-Otto Apel.

Habermas&#x27;s works resonate within the traditions of Kant and the Enlightenment and of democratic socialism through his emphasis on the potential for transforming the world and arriving at a more humane, just, and egalitarian society through the realization of the human potential for reason, in part through discourse ethics. While Habermas has stated that the Enlightenment is an &quot;unfinished project,&quot; he argues it should be corrected and complemented, not discarded. In this he distances himself from the Frankfurt School, criticizing it, as well as much of postmodernist thought, for excessive pessimism, radicalism, and exaggerations.

Within sociology, Habermas&#x27;s major contribution was the development of a comprehensive theory of societal evolution and modernization focusing on the difference between communicative rationality and rationalization on one hand and strategic/instrumental rationality and rationalization on the other. This includes a critique from a communicative standpoint of the differentiation-based theory of social systems developed by Niklas Luhmann, a student of Talcott Parsons.

His defence of modernity and civil society has been a source of inspiration to others, and is considered a major philosophical alternative to the varieties of poststructuralism. He has also offered an influential analysis of late capitalism.

Habermas perceives the rationalization, humanization and democratization of society in terms of the institutionalization of the potential for rationality that is inherent in the communicative competence that is unique to the human species. Habermas contends that communicative competence has developed through the course of evolution, but in contemporary society it is often suppressed or weakened by the way in which major domains of social life, such as the market, the state, and organizations, have been given over to or taken over by strategic/instrumental rationality, so that the logic of the system supplants that of the lifeworld.

===Reconstructive science===
Habermas introduces the concept of &quot;reconstructive science&quot; with a double purpose: to place the &quot;general theory of society&quot; between philosophy and social science and re-establish the rift between the &quot;great theorization&quot; and the &quot;empirical research&quot;.
The model of &quot;rational reconstructions&quot; represents the main thread of the surveys about the &quot;structures&quot; of the world of life (&quot;culture&quot;, &quot;society&quot; and &quot;personality&quot;) and their respective &quot;functions&quot; (cultural reproductions, social integrations and socialization). For this purpose, the dialectics between &quot;symbolic representation&quot; of &quot;the structures subordinated to all worlds of
life&quot; (&quot;internal relationships&quot;) and the &quot;material reproduction&quot; of the social systems in their complex (&quot;external relationships&quot; between social systems and environment) has to be considered.

This model finds an application, above all, in the &quot;theory of the social evolution&quot;, starting from the reconstruction of the necessary conditions for a phylogeny of the socio-cultural life forms (the &quot;hominization&quot;) until an analysis of the development of &quot;social formations&quot;, which Habermas subdivides into primitive, traditional, modern and contemporary formations.
&quot;This paper is an attempt, primarily, to formalize the model of &quot;reconstruction of the logic of development&quot; of &quot;social formations&quot; summed up by Habermas through the differentiation between vital world and social systems (and, within them, through the &quot;rationalization of the world of life&quot; and the &quot;growth in complexity of the social systems&quot;). Secondly, it tries to offer some methodological clarifications about the &quot;explanation of the dynamics&quot; of &quot;historical processes&quot; and, in particular, about the &quot;theoretical meaning&quot; of the evolutional theory&#x27;s propositions. Even if the German sociologist considers that the &quot;ex-post rational reconstructions&quot; and &quot;the models system/environment&quot; cannot have a complete &quot;historiographical application&quot;, these certainly act as a general premise in the argumentative structure of the &quot;historical explanation&quot;.

===The public sphere===

In &quot;The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere,&quot; Habermas argues that prior to the 18th century, European culture had been dominated by a &quot;representational&quot; culture, where one party sought to &quot;represent&quot; itself on its audience by overwhelming its subjects. As an example of &quot;representational&quot; culture, Habermas argued that Louis XIV&#x27;s Palace of Versailles was meant to show the greatness of the French state and its King by overpowering the senses of visitors to the Palace. Habermas identifies &quot;representational&quot; culture as corresponding to the feudal stage of development according to Marxist theory, arguing that the coming of the capitalist stage of development marked the appearance of (the public sphere). In the culture characterized by , there occurred a public space outside of the control by the state, where individuals exchanged views and knowledge.

In Habermas&#x27;s view, the growth in newspapers, journals, reading clubs, Masonic lodges, and coffeehouses in 18th-century Europe, all in different ways, marked the gradual replacement of &quot;representational&quot; culture with culture. Habermas argued that the essential characteristic of the culture was its &quot;critical&quot; nature. Unlike &quot;representational&quot; culture where only one party was active and the other passive, the culture was characterized by a dialogue as individuals either met in conversation, or exchanged views via the print media. Habermas maintains that as Britain was the most liberal country in Europe, the culture of the public sphere emerged there first around 1700, and the growth of culture took place over most of the 18th century in Continental Europe. In his view, the French Revolution was in large part caused by the collapse of &quot;representational&quot; culture, and its replacement by culture. Though Habermas&#x27;s main concern in &quot;The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere&quot; was to expose what he regarded as the deceptive nature of free institutions in the West, his book had a major effect on the historiography of the French Revolution.

According to Habermas, a variety of factors resulted in the eventual decay of the public sphere, including the growth of a commercial mass media, which turned the critical public into a passive consumer public; and the welfare state, which merged the state with society so thoroughly that the public sphere was squeezed out. It also turned the &quot;public sphere&quot; into a site of self-interested contestation for the resources of the state rather than a space for the development of a public-minded rational consensus.

His most known work to date, the &quot;Theory of Communicative Action&quot; (1981), is based on an adaptation of Talcott Parsons&#x27; AGIL Paradigm. In this work, Habermas voiced criticism of the process of modernization, which he saw as inflexible direction forced through by economic and administrative rationalization. Habermas outlined how our everyday lives are penetrated by formal systems as parallel to development of the welfare state, corporate capitalism and mass consumption. These reinforcing trends rationalize public life. Disfranchisement of citizens occurs as political parties and interest groups become rationalized and representative democracy replaces participatory one. In consequence, boundaries between public and private, the individual and society, the system and the lifeworld are deteriorating. Democratic public life cannot develop where matters of public importance are not discussed by citizens. An &quot;ideal speech situation&quot; requires participants to have the same capacities of discourse, social equality and their words are not confused by ideology or other errors. In this version of the consensus theory of truth Habermas maintains that truth is what would be agreed upon in an ideal speech situation.

Habermas has expressed optimism about the possibility of the revival of the public sphere. He discerns a hope for the future where the representative democracy-reliant nation-state is replaced by a deliberative democracy-reliant political organism based on the equal rights and obligations of citizens. In such a direct democracy-driven system, the activist public sphere is needed for debates on matters of public importance as well as the mechanism for that discussion to affect the decision-making process.

==Habermas versus the postmodernists==
Habermas offered some early criticisms in an essay, &quot;Modernity versus Postmodernity&quot; (1981), which has achieved wide recognition. In that essay, Habermas raises the issue of whether, in light of the failures of the twentieth century, we &quot;should try to hold on to the &quot;intentions of the Enlightenment&quot;, feeble as they may be, or should we declare the entire project of modernity a lost cause?&quot; Habermas refuses to give up on the possibility of a rational, &quot;scientific&quot; understanding of the life-world.

Habermas has several main criticisms of postmodernism:

# Postmodernists are equivocal about whether they are producing serious theory or literature;
# Postmodernists are animated by normative sentiments, but the nature of those sentiments remains concealed from the reader;
# Postmodernism has a totalizing perspective that fails &quot;to differentiate phenomena and practices that occur within modern society&quot;;
# Postmodernists ignore everyday life and its practices, which Habermas finds absolutely central.

==Key dialogues and engagement with politics==
=== Positivism dispute ===

The positivism dispute was a political-philosophical dispute between the critical rationalists (Karl Popper, Hans Albert) and the Frankfurt School (Theodor Adorno, Jürgen Habermas) in 1961, about the methodology of the social sciences. It grew into a broad discussion within German sociology from 1961 to 1969.

=== Habermas and Gadamer ===
There is a controversy between Habermas and Hans-Georg Gadamer about limits of hermeneutics. Gadamer completed his magnum opus, &quot;Truth and Method&quot;, in 1960, and engaged in his debate with Habermas over the possibility of transcending history and culture in order to find a truly objective position from which to critique society.

During the 1960s, Gadamer supported Habermas and advocated for him to be offered a job at Heidelberg before he had completed his Habilitation, despite Max Horkheimer&#x27;s objections. While they both criticized positivism, a philosophical disagreement arose between them in the 1970s. This disagreement expanded the scope of Gadamer&#x27;s philosophical influence. Despite fundamental agreements between them, such as starting from the hermeneutic tradition and returning to Greek practical philosophy, Habermas argued that Gadamer&#x27;s emphasis on tradition and prejudice blinded him to the ideological operation of power. Habermas believed that Gadamer&#x27;s approach failed to enable critical reflection on the sources of ideology in society. He accused Gadamer of endorsing a dogmatic stance toward tradition, which made it difficult to identify distortions in understanding. Gadamer countered that refusing the universal nature of hermeneutics was the more dogmatic stance because it affirmed the deception that the subject can free itself from the past.

=== Habermas and Foucault ===

There is a dispute concerning whether Michel Foucault&#x27;s ideas of &quot;power analytics&quot; and &quot;genealogy&quot; or Jürgen Habermas&#x27;s ideas of &quot;communicative rationality&quot; and &quot;discourse ethics&quot; provide a better critique of the nature of power in society. The debate compares and evaluates the central ideas of Habermas and Foucault as they pertain to questions of power, reason, ethics, modernity, democracy, civil society, and social action.

=== Habermas and Apel ===
Habermas and Karl-Otto Apel both support a postmetaphysical, universal moral theory, but they disagree on the nature and justification of this principle. Habermas disagrees with Apel&#x27;s view that the principle is a transcendental condition of human activity, while Apel asserts that it is. They each criticize the other&#x27;s position. Habermas argues that Apel is too concerned with transcendental conditions, while Apel argues that Habermas doesn&#x27;t value critical discourse enough.

=== Habermas and Rawls ===

There is a debate between Habermas and John Rawls. The debate centers around the question of how to do political philosophy under conditions of cultural pluralism, if the aim of political philosophy is to uncover the normative foundation of a modern liberal democracy. Habermas believes that Rawls&#x27;s view is inconsistent with the idea of popular sovereignty, while Rawls argues that political legitimacy is solely a matter of sound moral reasoning or that democratic will formation has been unduly downgraded in his theory.

===&quot;Historikerstreit&quot; (historians&#x27; dispute)===

Habermas is famous as a public intellectual as well as a scholar; most notably, in the 1980s he used the popular press to attack the German historians Ernst Nolte, Michael Stürmer, Klaus Hildebrand and Andreas Hillgruber. Habermas first expressed his views on the above-mentioned historians in the &quot;Die Zeit&quot; on 11 July 1986 in a &quot;feuilleton&quot; (a type of culture and arts opinion essay in German newspapers) entitled &quot;A Kind of Settlement of Damages&quot;. Habermas criticized Nolte, Hildebrand, Stürmer and Hillgruber for &quot;apologistic&quot; history writing in regard to the Nazi era, and for seeking to &quot;close Germany&#x27;s opening to the West&quot; that in Habermas&#x27;s view had existed since 1945.

Habermas argued that Nolte, Stürmer, Hildebrand and Hillgruber had tried to detach Nazi rule and the Holocaust from the mainstream of German history, explain away Nazism as a reaction to Bolshevism, and partially rehabilitate the reputation of the Wehrmacht (German Army) during World War II. Habermas wrote that Stürmer was trying to create a &quot;vicarious religion&quot; in German history which, together with the work of Hillgruber, glorifying the last days of the German Army on the Eastern Front, was intended to serve as a &quot;kind of NATO philosophy colored with German nationalism&quot;. About Hillgruber&#x27;s statement that Adolf Hitler wanted to exterminate the Jews &quot;because only such a &#x27;racial revolution&#x27; could lend permanence to the world-power status of his &quot;Reich&quot;&quot;, Habermas wrote: &quot;Since Hillgruber does not use the verb in the subjunctive, one does not know whether the historian has adopted the perspective of the particulars this time too&quot;.

Habermas wrote: &quot;The unconditional opening of the Federal Republic to the political culture of the West is the greatest intellectual achievement of our postwar period; my generation should be especially proud of this. This event cannot and should not be stabilized by a kind of NATO philosophy colored with German nationalism. The opening of the Federal Republic has been achieved precisely by overcoming the ideology of Central Europe that our revisionists are trying to warm up for us with their geopolitical drumbeat about &quot;the old geographically central position of the Germans in Europe&quot; (Stürmer) and &quot;the reconstruction of the destroyed European Center&quot; (Hillgruber). The only patriotism that will not estrange us from the West is a constitutional patriotism.&quot;

The debate known as the &quot;Historikerstreit&quot; (&quot;Historians&#x27; Dispute&quot;) was not at all one-sided, because Habermas was himself attacked by scholars like Joachim Fest, Hagen Schulze, Horst Möller, Imanuel Geiss and Klaus Hildebrand. In turn, Habermas was supported by historians such as Martin Broszat, Eberhard Jäckel, Hans Mommsen, and Hans-Ulrich Wehler.

===Habermas and Derrida===
Habermas and Jacques Derrida engaged in a series of disputes beginning in the 1980s and culminating in a mutual understanding and friendship in the late 1990s that lasted until Derrida&#x27;s death in 2004. They originally came in contact when Habermas invited Derrida to speak at The University of Frankfurt in 1984. The next year Habermas published &quot;Beyond a Temporalized Philosophy of Origins: Derrida&quot; in &quot;The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity&quot; in which he described Derrida&#x27;s method as being unable to provide a foundation for social critique. Derrida, citing Habermas as an example, remarked that, &quot;those who have accused me of reducing philosophy to literature or logic to rhetoric ... have visibly and carefully avoided reading me&quot;. After Derrida&#x27;s final rebuttal in 1989 the two philosophers did not continue, but, as Derrida described it, groups in the academy &quot;conducted a kind of &#x27;war&#x27;, in which we ourselves never took part, either personally or directly&quot;.

At the end of the 1990s, Habermas approached Derrida at a party held at an American university where both were lecturing. They then met at Paris over dinner, and participated afterwards in many joint projects. In 2000 they held a joint seminar on problems of philosophy, right, ethics, and politics at the University of Frankfurt. In December 2000, in Paris, Habermas gave a lecture entitled &quot;How to answer the ethical question?&quot; at the &quot;Judeities. Questions for Jacques Derrida&quot; conference organized by Joseph Cohen and Raphael Zagury-Orly. Following the lecture by Habermas, both thinkers engaged in a very heated debate on Heidegger and the possibility of Ethics. The conference volume was published at the Editions Galilée (Paris) in 2002, and subsequently in English at Fordham University Press (2007).

In the aftermath of the 11 September attacks, Derrida and Habermas laid out their individual opinions on 9/11 and the War on Terror in Giovanna Borradori&#x27;s &quot;Philosophy in a Time of Terror: Dialogues with Jürgen Habermas and Jacques Derrida&quot;. In early 2003, both Habermas and Derrida were very active in opposing the coming Iraq War; in a manifesto that later became the book &quot;Old Europe, New Europe, Core Europe&quot;, the two called for a tighter unification of the states of the European Union in order to create a power capable of opposing American foreign policy. Derrida wrote a foreword expressing his unqualified subscription to Habermas&#x27;s declaration of February 2003 (&quot;February 15, or, What Binds Europeans Together: Plea for a Common Foreign Policy, Beginning in Core Europe&quot;) in the book, which was a reaction to the Bush administration&#x27;s demands upon European nations for support in the coming Iraq War.

=== Religious dialogue ===
Habermas&#x27;s attitudes toward religion have changed throughout the years. Analyst Phillippe Portier identifies three phases in Habermas&#x27;s attitude towards this social sphere: the first, in the decade of 1980, when the younger Jürgen, in the spirit of Marx, argued against religion seeing it as an &quot;alienating reality&quot; and &quot;control tool&quot;; the second phase, from the mid-1980s to the beginning of the 21st century, when he stopped discussing it and, as a secular commentator, relegated it to matters of private life; and the third, from then until now, when Habermas saw a positive social role of religion.

In an interview in 1999 Habermas had stated:

The original German (from the Habermas Forum website) of the disputed quotation is:

This statement has been misquoted in a number of articles and books, where Habermas instead is quoted for saying:

In his book &quot;Zwischen Naturalismus und Religion&quot; (Between Naturalism and Religion, 2005), Habermas stated that the forces of religious strength, as a result of multiculturalism and immigration, are stronger than in previous decades, and, therefore, there is a need of tolerance which must be understood as a two-way street: secular people need to tolerate the role of religious people in the public square and vice versa.

In early 2007, Ignatius Press published a dialogue between Habermas and the then Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith of the Holy Office Joseph Ratzinger (elected as Pope Benedict XVI in 2005), entitled &quot;The Dialectics of Secularization&quot;. The dialogue took place on 14 January 2004 after an invitation to both thinkers by the Catholic Academy of Bavaria in Munich. It addressed contemporary questions such as:
* Is a public culture of reason and ordered liberty possible in our post-metaphysical age?
* Is philosophy permanently cut adrift from its grounding in being and anthropology?
* Does this decline of rationality signal an opportunity or a deep crisis for religion itself?

In this debate a shift of Habermas became evident—in particular, his rethinking of the public role of religion. Habermas stated that he wrote as a &quot;methodological atheist,&quot; which means that when doing philosophy or social science, he presumed nothing about particular religious beliefs. Yet while writing from this perspective his evolving position towards the role of religion in society led him to some challenging questions, and as a result conceding some ground in his dialogue with the future Pope, that would seem to have consequences which further complicated the positions he holds about a communicative rational solution to the problems of modernity. Habermas believes that even for self-identified liberal thinkers, &quot;to exclude religious voices from the public square is highly illiberal.&quot;

In addition, Habermas has popularized the concept of &quot;post-secular&quot; society, to refer to current times in which the idea of modernity is perceived as unsuccessful and at times, morally failed, so that, rather than a stratification or separation, a new peaceful dialogue and coexistence between faith and reason must be sought in order to learn mutually.

===Socialist dialogue===
Habermas has sided with other 20th-century commentators on Marx such as Hannah Arendt who have indicated concerns with the limits of totalitarian perspectives often associated with Marx&#x27;s over-estimation of the emancipatory potential of the forces of production. Arendt had presented this in her book &quot;The Origins of Totalitarianism&quot; and Habermas extends this critique in his writings on functional reductionism in the life-world in his &quot;Lifeworld and System: A Critique of Functionalist Reason&quot;. As Habermas states:

Habermas reiterated the positions that what refuted Marx and his theory of class struggle was the &quot;pacification of class conflict&quot; by the welfare state, which had developed in the West &quot;since 1945&quot;, thanks to &quot;a reformist relying on the instruments of Keynesian economics&quot;. Italian philosopher and historian Domenico Losurdo criticised the main point of these claims as &quot;marked by the absence of a question that should be obvious:— Was the advent of the welfare state the inevitable result of a tendency inherent in capitalism? Or was it the result of political and social mobilization by the subaltern classes—in the final analysis, of a class struggle? Had the German philosopher posed this question, perhaps he would have avoided assuming the permanence of the welfare state, whose precariousness and progressive dismantlement are now obvious to everyone&quot;.

=== Controversy about wars ===
In 1999, Habermas addressed the Kosovo War. Habermas defended NATO&#x27;s intervention in an article for &quot;Die Zeit&quot;, which stirred controversy.

In 2002, Habermas argued that the United States should not go to war in Iraq.

On 13 November 2023, Habermas issued a statement supporting Israel&#x27;s military response to the Hamas-led attack on Israel, rejecting the term genocide in reference to its actions in the Gaza Strip.

=== European Union ===
During the European debt crisis, Habermas criticized Angela Merkel&#x27;s leadership in Europe. In 2013, Habermas clashed with Wolfgang Streeck, who argued the kind of European federalism espoused by Habermas was the root of the continent&#x27;s crisis.

<text>James Dewey Watson (born April 6, 1928) is an American molecular biologist, geneticist, and zoologist. In 1953, he co-authored with Francis Crick the academic paper in &quot;Nature&quot; proposing the double helix structure of the DNA molecule. Watson, Crick and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine &quot;for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material&quot;. 

Watson earned degrees at the University of Chicago (BS, 1947) and Indiana University (PhD, 1950). Following a post-doctoral year at the University of Copenhagen with Herman Kalckar and Ole Maaløe, Watson worked at the University of Cambridge&#x27;s Cavendish Laboratory in England, where he first met his future collaborator Francis Crick. From 1956 to 1976, Watson was on the faculty of the Harvard University Biology Department, promoting research in molecular biology.

From 1968, Watson served as director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL), greatly expanding its level of funding and research. At CSHL, he shifted his research emphasis to the study of cancer, along with making it a world-leading research center in molecular biology. In 1994, he started as president and served for 10 years. He was then appointed chancellor, serving until he resigned in 2007 after making comments claiming that there is a genetic link between intelligence and race. In 2019, following the broadcast of a documentary in which Watson reiterated these views on race and genetics, CSHL revoked his honorary titles and severed all ties with him.

Watson has written many science books, including the textbook &quot;Molecular Biology of the Gene&quot; (1965) and his bestselling book &quot;The Double Helix&quot; (1968). Between 1988 and 1992, Watson was associated with the National Institutes of Health, helping to establish the Human Genome Project, which completed the task of mapping the human genome in 2003.
== Early life and education ==
Watson was born in Chicago on April 6, 1928, as the only son of Jean ( Mitchell) and James D. Watson, a businessman descended mostly from colonial English immigrants to America. His mother&#x27;s father, Lauchlin Mitchell, a tailor, was from Glasgow, Scotland, and her mother, Lizzie Gleason, was the child of parents from County Tipperary, Ireland. His mother was a modestly religious Catholic and his father an Episcopalian who had lost his belief in God. Watson was raised Catholic, but he later described himself as &quot;an escapee from the Catholic religion&quot;. Watson said, &quot;The luckiest thing that ever happened to me was that my father didn&#x27;t believe in God.&quot; By age 11, Watson stopped attending mass and embraced the &quot;pursuit of scientific and humanistic knowledge.&quot;

Watson grew up on the South Side of Chicago and attended public schools, including Horace Mann Elementary School and South Shore High School. He was fascinated with bird watching, a hobby shared with his father, so he considered majoring in ornithology. Watson appeared on &quot;Quiz Kids,&quot; a popular radio show that challenged bright youngsters to answer questions. Thanks to the liberal policy of university president Robert Hutchins, he enrolled at the University of Chicago, where he was awarded a tuition scholarship at the age of 15. Among his professors was Louis Leon Thurstone from whom Watson learned about factor analysis, which he would later reference on his controversial views on race.

After reading Erwin Schrödinger&#x27;s book, &quot;What Is Life?&quot; in 1946, Watson changed his professional ambitions from the study of ornithology to genetics. Watson earned his BS degree in zoology from the University of Chicago in 1947. In his autobiography, &quot;Avoid Boring People&quot;, Watson described the University of Chicago as an &quot;idyllic academic institution where he was instilled with the capacity for critical thought and an ethical compulsion not to suffer fools who impeded his search for truth&quot;, in contrast to his description of later experiences. In 1947, Watson left the University of Chicago to become a graduate student at Indiana University, attracted by the presence at Bloomington of the 1946 Nobel Prize winner Hermann Joseph Muller, who in crucial papers published in 1922, 1929, and in the 1930s had laid out all the basic properties of the heredity molecule that Schrödinger presented in his 1944 book. He received his PhD degree from Indiana University in 1950; Salvador Luria was his doctoral advisor.

==Career and research==

===Luria, Delbrück, and the Phage Group===
Originally, Watson was drawn into molecular biology by the work of Salvador Luria. Luria eventually shared the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on the Luria–Delbrück experiment, which concerned the nature of genetic mutations. He was part of a distributed group of researchers who were making use of the viruses that infect bacteria, called bacteriophages. He and Max Delbrück were among the leaders of this new &quot;Phage Group&quot;, an important movement of geneticists from experimental systems such as &quot;Drosophila&quot; towards microbial genetics. Early in 1948, Watson began his PhD research in Luria&#x27;s laboratory at Indiana University. That spring, he met Delbrück first in Luria&#x27;s apartment and again that summer during Watson&#x27;s first trip to the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL).

The Phage Group was the intellectual medium where Watson became a working scientist. Importantly, the members of the Phage Group sensed that they were on the path to discovering the physical nature of the gene. In 1949, Watson took a course with Felix Haurowitz that included the conventional view of that time: that genes were proteins and able to replicate themselves. The other major molecular component of chromosomes, DNA, was widely considered to be a &quot;stupid tetranucleotide&quot;, serving only a structural role to support the proteins. Even at this early time, Watson, under the influence of the Phage Group, was aware of the Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment, which suggested that DNA was the genetic molecule. Watson&#x27;s research project involved using X-rays to inactivate bacterial viruses.

Watson then went to Copenhagen University in September 1950 for a year of postdoctoral research, first heading to the laboratory of biochemist Herman Kalckar. Kalckar was interested in the enzymatic synthesis of nucleic acids, and he wanted to use phages as an experimental system. Watson wanted to explore the structure of DNA, and his interests did not coincide with Kalckar&#x27;s. After working part of the year with Kalckar, Watson spent the remainder of his time in Copenhagen conducting experiments with microbial physiologist Ole Maaløe, then a member of the Phage Group.

The experiments, which Watson had learned of during the previous summer&#x27;s Cold Spring Harbor phage conference, included the use of radioactive phosphate as a tracer to determine which molecular components of phage particles actually infect the target bacteria during viral infection. The intention was to determine whether protein or DNA was the genetic material, but upon consultation with Max Delbrück, they determined that their results were inconclusive and could not specifically identify the newly labeled molecules as DNA. Watson never developed a constructive interaction with Kalckar, but he did accompany Kalckar to a meeting in Italy, where Watson saw Maurice Wilkins talk about X-ray diffraction data for DNA. Watson was now certain that DNA had a definite molecular structure that could be elucidated.

In 1951, the chemist Linus Pauling in California published his model of the amino acid alpha helix, a result that grew out of Pauling&#x27;s efforts in X-ray crystallography and molecular model building. After obtaining some results from his phage and other experimental research conducted at Indiana University, Statens Serum Institut (Denmark), CSHL, and the California Institute of Technology, Watson now had the desire to learn to perform X-ray diffraction experiments so he could work to determine the structure of DNA. That summer, Luria met John Kendrew, and he arranged for a new postdoctoral research project for Watson in England. In 1951 Watson visited the Stazione Zoologica &#x27;Anton Dohrn&#x27; in Naples.

===Identifying the double helix===
In mid-March 1953, Watson and Crick deduced the double helix structure of DNA. Crucial to their discovery were the experimental data collected at King&#x27;s College London—mainly by Rosalind Franklin for which they did not provide proper attribution. Sir Lawrence Bragg, the director of the Cavendish Laboratory (where Watson and Crick worked), made the original announcement of the discovery at a Solvay conference on proteins in Belgium on April 8, 1953; it went unreported by the press. Watson and Crick submitted a paper entitled &quot;Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid&quot; to the scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot;, which was published on April 25, 1953. Bragg gave a talk at the Guy&#x27;s Hospital Medical School in London on Thursday, May 14, 1953, which resulted in a May 15, 1953, article by Ritchie Calder in the London newspaper &quot;News Chronicle&quot;, entitled &quot;Why You Are You. Nearer Secret of Life&quot;.

Sydney Brenner, Jack Dunitz, Dorothy Hodgkin, Leslie Orgel, and Beryl M. Oughton were some of the first people in April 1953 to see the model of the structure of DNA, constructed by Crick and Watson; at the time, they were working at Oxford University&#x27;s chemistry department. All were impressed by the new DNA model, especially Brenner, who subsequently worked with Crick at Cambridge in the Cavendish Laboratory and the new Laboratory of Molecular Biology. According to the late Beryl Oughton, later Rimmer, they all travelled together in two cars once Dorothy Hodgkin announced to them that they were off to Cambridge to see the model of the structure of DNA.
The Cambridge University student newspaper &quot;Varsity&quot; ran its own short article on the discovery on Saturday, May 30, 1953. Watson subsequently presented a paper on the double-helical structure of DNA at the 18th Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Viruses in early June 1953, six weeks after the publication of the Watson and Crick paper in &quot;Nature&quot;. Many at the meeting had not yet heard of the discovery. The 1953 Cold Spring Harbor Symposium was the first opportunity for many to see the model of the DNA double helix. Watson, Crick, and Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 for their research on the structure of nucleic acids. Rosalind Franklin had died in 1958 and was therefore ineligible for nomination. The publication of the double helix structure of DNA has been described as a turning point in science; understanding of life was fundamentally changed and the modern era of biology began.

====Interactions with Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling====
Watson and Crick&#x27;s use of DNA X-ray diffraction data collected by Rosalind Franklin and her student Raymond Gosling has attracted scrutiny. It has been argued that Watson and his colleagues did not properly acknowledge colleague Rosalind Franklin for her contributions to the discovery of the double helix structure. Robert P. Crease notes that &quot;Such stingy behaviour may not be unknown, or even uncommon, among scientists&quot;. Franklin&#x27;s high-quality X-ray diffraction patterns of DNA were unpublished results, which Watson and Crick used without her knowledge or consent in their construction of the double helix model of DNA. Franklin&#x27;s results provided estimates of the water content of DNA crystals and these results were consistent with the two sugar-phosphate backbones being on the outside of the molecule. Franklin told Crick and Watson that the backbones had to be on the outside; before then, Linus Pauling and Watson and Crick had erroneous models with the chains inside and the bases pointing outwards. Her identification of the space group for DNA crystals revealed to Crick that the two DNA strands were antiparallel.

The X-ray diffraction images collected by Gosling and Franklin provided the best evidence for the helical nature of DNA. Watson and Crick had three sources for Franklin&#x27;s unpublished data: 
#Her 1951 seminar, attended by Watson;
#Discussions with Wilkins, who worked in the same laboratory with Franklin;
#A research progress report that was intended to promote coordination of Medical Research Council-supported laboratories. Watson, Crick, Wilkins and Franklin all worked in MRC laboratories.

In a 1954 article, Watson and Crick acknowledged that, without Franklin&#x27;s data, &quot;the formulation of our structure would have been most unlikely, if not impossible&quot;. In &quot;The Double Helix&quot;, Watson later admitted that &quot;Rosy, of course, did not directly give us her data. For that matter, no one at King&#x27;s realized they were in our hands&quot;. In recent years, Watson has garnered controversy in the popular and scientific press for his &quot;misogynist treatment&quot; of Franklin and his failure to properly attribute her work on DNA. According to one critic, Watson&#x27;s portrayal of Franklin in &quot;The Double Helix&quot; was negative, giving the impression that she was Wilkins&#x27; assistant and was unable to interpret her own DNA data. Watson&#x27;s accusation was indefensible since Franklin told Crick and Watson that the helix backbones had to be on the outside. From a 2003 piece by Brenda Maddox in &quot;Nature&quot;:

Robert P. Crease remarks that &quot;[Franklin] was close to figuring out the structure of DNA, but did not do it. The title of &#x27;discoverer&#x27; goes to those who first fit the pieces together&quot;. Jeremy Bernstein rejects that Franklin was a &quot;victim&quot; and states that &quot;[Watson and Crick] made the double-helix scheme work. It is as simple as that&quot;. Matthew Cobb and Nathaniel C. Comfort write that &quot;Franklin was no victim in how the DNA double helix was solved&quot; but that she was &quot;an equal contributor to the solution of the structure&quot;.

A review of the correspondence from Franklin to Watson, in the archives at CSHL, revealed that the two scientists later exchanged constructive scientific correspondence. Franklin consulted with Watson on her tobacco mosaic virus RNA research. Franklin&#x27;s letters were framed with the normal and unremarkable forms of address, beginning with &quot;Dear Jim&quot;, and concluding with &quot;Best Wishes, Yours, Rosalind&quot;. Each of the scientists published their own unique contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA in separate articles, and all of the contributors published their findings in the same volume of &quot;Nature&quot;. These classic molecular biology papers are identified as: Watson J. D. and Crick F. H. C. &quot;A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid&quot;. &quot;Nature&quot; 171, 737–738 (1953); Wilkins M. H. F., Stokes A. R. &amp; Wilson H. R. &quot;Molecular Structure of Deoxypentose Nucleic Acids&quot;. &quot;Nature&quot; 171, 738–740 (1953); Franklin R. and Gosling R. G. &quot;Molecular Configuration in Sodium Thymonucleate&quot;. &quot;Nature&quot; 171, 740–741 (1953).

===Harvard University===
In 1956, Watson accepted a position in the biology department at Harvard University. His work at Harvard focused on RNA and its role in the transfer of genetic information.

Watson championed a switch in focus for the school from classical biology to molecular biology, stating that disciplines such as ecology, developmental biology, taxonomy, physiology, etc. had stagnated and could progress only once the underlying disciplines of molecular biology and biochemistry had elucidated their underpinnings, going so far as to discourage their study by students.

Watson continued to be a member of the Harvard faculty until 1976, even though he took over the directorship of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1968.

During his tenure at Harvard, Watson participated in a protest against the Vietnam War, leading a group of 12 biologists and biochemists calling for &quot;the immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam&quot;. In 1975, on the thirtieth anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima, Watson was one of over 2000 scientists and engineers who spoke out against nuclear proliferation to President Gerald Ford, arguing that there was no proven method for the safe disposal of radioactive waste, and that nuclear plants were a security threat due to the possibility of terrorist theft of plutonium.

Watson&#x27;s first textbook, &quot;The Molecular Biology of the Gene&quot;, used the concept of heads—brief declarative subheadings. His next textbook was &quot;Molecular Biology of the Cell&quot;, in which he coordinated the work of a group of scientist-writers. His third was &quot;Recombinant DNA&quot;, which described the ways in which genetic engineering has brought new information about how organisms function.

===Publishing &quot;The Double Helix&quot;===

In 1968, Watson wrote &quot;The Double Helix&quot;, listed by the board of the Modern Library as number seven in their list of &quot;100 Best Nonfiction&quot; books. The book details the story of the discovery of the structure of DNA, as well as the personalities, conflicts and controversy surrounding their work, and includes many of his private emotional impressions at the time. Watson&#x27;s original title was to have been &quot;Honest Jim&quot;. Controversy surrounded the publication of the book. Watson&#x27;s book was originally to be published by the Harvard University Press, but Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins, among others, objected. Watson&#x27;s home university dropped the project and the book was commercially published. In an interview with Anne Sayre for her book, &quot;Rosalind Franklin and DNA&quot; (published in 1975 and reissued in 2000), Francis Crick said that he regarded Watson&#x27;s book as a &quot;contemptible pack of damned nonsense&quot;.

===Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory===
In 1968, Watson became the director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). Between 1970 and 1972, the Watsons&#x27; two sons were born, and by 1974, the young family made Cold Spring Harbor their permanent residence. Watson served as the laboratory&#x27;s director and president for about 35 years, and later he assumed the role of chancellor and then chancellor emeritus.

In his roles as director, president, and chancellor, Watson led CSHL to articulate its present-day mission, &quot;dedication to exploring molecular biology and genetics in order to advance the understanding and ability to diagnose and treat cancers, neurological diseases, and other causes of human suffering.&quot; CSHL substantially expanded both its research and its science educational programs under Watson&#x27;s direction. He is credited with &quot;transforming a small facility into one of the world&#x27;s great education and research institutions. Initiating a program to study the cause of human cancer, scientists under his direction have made major contributions to understanding the genetic basis of cancer.&quot; In a retrospective summary of Watson&#x27;s accomplishments there, Bruce Stillman, the laboratory&#x27;s president, said, &quot;Jim Watson created a research environment that is unparalleled in the world of science.&quot;

In 2007, Watson said, &quot;I turned against the left wing because they don&#x27;t like genetics, because genetics implies that sometimes in life we fail because we have bad genes. They want all failure in life to be due to the evil system.&quot;

===Human Genome Project===

In 1990, Watson was appointed as the head of the Human Genome Project at the National Institutes of Health, a position he held until April 10, 1992. Watson left the Genome Project after conflicts with the new NIH Director, Bernadine Healy. Watson was opposed to Healy&#x27;s attempts to acquire patents on gene sequences, and any ownership of the &quot;laws of nature&quot;. Two years before stepping down from the Genome Project, he had stated his own opinion on this long and ongoing controversy which he saw as an illogical barrier to research; he said, &quot;The nations of the world must see that the human genome belongs to the world&#x27;s people, as opposed to its nations.&quot; He left within weeks of the 1992 announcement that the NIH would be applying for patents on brain-specific cDNAs. (The issue of the patentability of genes has since been resolved in the US by the US Supreme Court; see &quot;Association for Molecular Pathology v. U.S. Patent and Trademark Office&quot;.)

In 1994, Watson became president of CSHL. Francis Collins took over the role as director of the Human Genome Project.

Watson was quoted in &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; in 1997 as stating: &quot;If you could find the gene which determines sexuality and a woman decides she doesn&#x27;t want a homosexual child, well, let her.&quot; The biologist Richard Dawkins wrote a letter to &quot;The Independent&quot; claiming that Watson&#x27;s position was misrepresented by &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; article, and that Watson would equally consider the possibility of having a heterosexual child to be just as valid as any other reason for abortion, to emphasise that Watson is in favor of allowing choice.

On the issue of obesity, Watson was quoted in 2000, saying: &quot;Whenever you interview fat people, you feel bad, because you know you&#x27;re not going to hire them.&quot;

Watson has repeatedly supported genetic screening and genetic engineering in public lectures and interviews, arguing that stupidity is a disease and the &quot;really stupid&quot; bottom 10% of people should be cured. He has also suggested that beauty could be genetically engineered, saying in 2003, &quot;People say it would be terrible if we made all girls pretty. I think it would be great.&quot;

In 2007, Watson became the second person to publish his fully sequenced genome online, after it was presented to him on May 31, 2007, by 454 Life Sciences Corporation in collaboration with scientists at the Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine. Watson was quoted as saying, &quot;I am putting my genome sequence on line to encourage the development of an era of personalized medicine, in which information contained in our genomes can be used to identify and prevent disease and to create individualized medical therapies&quot;.

===Later life===
In 2014, Watson published a paper in &quot;The Lancet&quot; suggesting that biological oxidants may have a different role than is thought in diseases including diabetes, dementia, heart disease and cancer. For example, type 2 diabetes is usually thought to be caused by oxidation in the body that causes inflammation and kills off pancreatic cells. Watson thinks the root of that inflammation is different: &quot;a lack of biological oxidants, not an excess&quot;, and discusses this in detail. One critical response was that the idea was neither new nor worthy of merit, and that &quot;The Lancet&quot; published Watson&#x27;s paper only because of his name. Other scientists have expressed their support for his hypothesis and have proposed that it can also be expanded to why a lack of oxidants can result in cancer and its progression.

In 2014, Watson sold his Nobel Prize medal to raise money after complaining of being made an &quot;unperson&quot; following controversial statements he had made. Part of the funds raised by the sale went to support scientific research. The medal sold at auction at Christie&#x27;s in December 2014 for . Watson intended to contribute the proceeds to conservation work in Long Island and to funding research at Trinity College, Dublin. He was the first living Nobel recipient to auction a medal. The medal was later returned to Watson by the purchaser, Alisher Usmanov.

===Notable former students===
Several of Watson&#x27;s former doctoral students subsequently became notable in their own right including, Mario Capecchi, Bob Horvitz, Peter B. Moore and Joan Steitz. Besides numerous PhD students, Watson also supervised postdoctoral researchers and other interns including Ewan Birney, Ronald W. Davis, Phillip Allen Sharp (postdoc), John Tooze (postdoc) and Richard J. Roberts (postdoc).

===Other affiliations===

Watson is a former member of the Board of Directors of United Biomedical, Inc., founded by Chang Yi Wang. He held the position for six years and retired from the board in 1999.

In January 2007, Watson accepted the invitation of Leonor Beleza, president of the Champalimaud Foundation, to become the head of the foundation&#x27;s scientific council, an advisory organ.

In March 2017, Watson was named head consultant of the Cheerland Investment Group, a Chinese investment company which sponsored his trip.

Watson has been an institute adviser for the Allen Institute for Brain Science.

===&quot;Avoid Boring People&quot;===

Watson has had disagreements with Craig Venter regarding his use of EST fragments while Venter worked at NIH. Venter went on to found Celera genomics and continued his feud with Watson. Watson was quoted as calling Venter &quot;Hitler&quot;.

In his 2007 memoir, &quot;Avoid Boring People: Lessons from a Life in Science&quot;, Watson describes his academic colleagues as &quot;dinosaurs&quot;, &quot;deadbeats&quot;, &quot;fossils&quot;, &quot;has-beens&quot;, &quot;mediocre&quot;, and &quot;vapid&quot;. Steve Shapin in &quot;Harvard Magazine&quot; noted that Watson had written an unlikely &quot;Book of Manners&quot;, telling about the skills needed at different times in a scientist&#x27;s career; he wrote Watson was known for aggressively pursuing his own goals at the university. E. O. Wilson once described Watson as &quot;the most unpleasant human being I had ever met&quot;, but in a later TV interview said that he considered them friends and their rivalry at Harvard &quot;old history&quot; (when they had competed for funding in their respective fields).

In the epilogue to the memoir &quot;Avoid Boring People&quot;, Watson alternately attacks and defends former Harvard University president Lawrence Summers, who stepped down in 2006 due in part to his remarks about women and science. Watson also states in the epilogue, &quot;Anyone sincerely interested in understanding the imbalance in the representation of men and women in science must reasonably be prepared at least to consider the extent to which nature may figure, even with the clear evidence that nurture is strongly implicated.&quot;

===Comments on race ===
At a conference in 2000, Watson suggested a link between skin color and sex drive, hypothesizing that dark-skinned people have stronger libidos. His lecture argued that extracts of melanin—which gives skin its color—had been found to boost subjects&#x27; sex drive. &quot;That&#x27;s why you have Latin lovers&quot;, he said, according to people who attended the lecture. &quot;You&#x27;ve never heard of an English lover. Only an English Patient.&quot; He has also said that stereotypes associated with racial and ethnic groups have a genetic basis: Jews being intelligent, Chinese being intelligent but not creative because of selection for conformity, and Indians being servile because of selection under caste endogamy. Regarding intelligence differences between blacks and whites, Watson has asserted that &quot;all our social policies are based on the fact that their (blacks) intelligence is the same as ours (whites) – whereas all the testing says not really ... people who have to deal with black employees find this not true.&quot;

Watson has repeatedly asserted that differences in average measured IQ between blacks and whites are due to genetics. In early October 2007, he was interviewed by Charlotte Hunt-Grubbe at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). He discussed his view that Africans are less intelligent than Westerners. Watson said his intention was to promote science, not racism, but some UK venues canceled his appearances, and he canceled the rest of his tour. An editorial in &quot;Nature&quot; said that his remarks were &quot;beyond the pale&quot; but expressed a wish that the tour had not been canceled so that Watson would have had to face his critics in person, encouraging scientific discussion on the matter. Because of the controversy, the board of trustees at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory suspended Watson&#x27;s administrative responsibilities. Watson issued an apology, then retired at the age of 79 from CSHL from what the lab called &quot;nearly 40 years of distinguished service&quot;. Watson attributed his retirement to his age and to circumstances that he could never have anticipated or desired.

In 2008, Watson was appointed chancellor emeritus of CSHL but continued to advise and guide project work at the laboratory. In a BBC documentary that year, Watson said he did not see himself as a racist.

In January 2019, following the broadcast of a television documentary made the previous year in which he repeated his views about race and genetics, CSHL revoked honorary titles that it had awarded to Watson and cut all remaining ties with him. Watson did not respond to the developments.

==Personal life==
Watson is an atheist. In 2003, he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto. Watson wrote in &quot;Time&quot; that he contributed $1,000 to Bernie Sanders&#x27; 2016 presidential campaign.

===Marriage and family===
Watson married Elizabeth Lewis in 1968. They have two sons, Rufus Robert Watson (b. 1970) and Duncan James Watson (b. 1972). Watson sometimes talks about his son Rufus, who has schizophrenia, seeking to encourage progress in the understanding and treatment of mental illness by determining how genetics contributes to it.

<text>Jerk (also known as Jolt) is the rate of change of an object&#x27;s acceleration over time. It is a vector quantity (having both magnitude and direction). Jerk is most commonly denoted by the symbol and expressed in m/s3 (SI units) or standard gravities per second (&quot;g&quot;0/s).

==Expressions==
As a vector, jerk can be expressed as the first time derivative of acceleration, second time derivative of velocity, and third time derivative of position:

formula_1

Where:
* is acceleration
* is velocity
* is position
* is time

Third-order differential equations of the form
formula_2
are sometimes called &quot;jerk equations&quot;. When converted to an equivalent system of three ordinary first-order non-linear differential equations, jerk equations are the minimal setting for solutions showing chaotic behaviour. This condition generates mathematical interest in &quot;jerk systems&quot;. Systems involving fourth-order derivatives or higher are accordingly called &quot;hyperjerk systems&quot;.

==Physiological effects and human perception==
Human body position is controlled by balancing the forces of antagonistic muscles. In balancing a given force, such as holding up a weight, the postcentral gyrus establishes a control loop to achieve the desired equilibrium. If the force changes too quickly, the muscles cannot relax or tense fast enough and overshoot in either direction, causing a temporary loss of control. The reaction time for responding to changes in force depends on physiological limitations and the attention level of the brain: an &quot;expected&quot; change will be stabilized faster than a &quot;sudden&quot; decrease or increase of load.

To avoid vehicle passengers losing control over body motion and getting injured, it is necessary to limit the exposure to both the maximum force (acceleration) &quot;and&quot; maximum jerk, since time is needed to adjust muscle tension and adapt to even limited stress changes. Sudden changes in acceleration can cause injuries such as whiplash. Excessive jerk may also result in an uncomfortable ride, even at levels that do not cause injury. Engineers expend considerable design effort minimizing &quot;jerky motion&quot; on elevators, trams, and other conveyances.

For example, consider the effects of acceleration and jerk when riding in a car:

* Skilled and experienced drivers can accelerate smoothly, but beginners often provide a &quot;jerky&quot; ride. When changing gears in a car with a foot-operated clutch, the accelerating force is limited by engine power, but an inexperienced driver can cause severe jerk because of intermittent force closure over the clutch.
* The feeling of being pressed into the seats in a high-powered sports car is due to the acceleration. As the car launches from rest, there is a large positive jerk as its acceleration rapidly increases. After the launch, there is a small, sustained negative jerk as the force of air resistance increases with the car&#x27;s velocity, gradually decreasing acceleration and reducing the force pressing the passenger into the seat. When the car reaches its top speed, the acceleration has reached 0 and remains constant, after which there is no jerk until the driver decelerates or changes direction.
* When braking suddenly or during collisions, passengers whip forward with an initial acceleration that is larger than during the rest of the braking process because muscle tension regains control of the body quickly after the onset of braking or impact. These effects are not modeled in vehicle testing because cadavers and crash test dummies do not have active muscle control.
* To minimize the jerk, curves along roads are designed to be clothoids as are railroad curves and roller coaster loops.

== Force, acceleration, and jerk ==
For a constant mass , acceleration is directly proportional to force according to Newton&#x27;s second law of motion:
formula_3

In classical mechanics of rigid bodies, there are no &quot;forces&quot; associated with the derivatives of acceleration; however, physical systems experience oscillations and deformations as a result of jerk. In designing the Hubble Space Telescope, NASA set limits on both jerk and jounce.

The Abraham–Lorentz force is the recoil force on an accelerating charged particle emitting radiation. This force is proportional to the particle&#x27;s jerk and to the square of its charge. The Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory is a more advanced theory, applicable in a relativistic and quantum environment, and accounting for self-energy.

==In an idealized setting==
Discontinuities in acceleration do not occur in real-world environments because of deformation, quantum mechanics effects, and other causes. However, a jump-discontinuity in acceleration and, accordingly, unbounded jerk are feasible in an idealized setting, such as an idealized point mass moving along a piecewise smooth, whole continuous path. The jump-discontinuity occurs at points where the path is not smooth. Extrapolating from these idealized settings, one can qualitatively describe, explain and predict the effects of jerk in real situations.

Jump-discontinuity in acceleration can be modeled using a Dirac delta function in jerk, scaled to the height of the jump. Integrating jerk over time across the Dirac delta yields the jump-discontinuity.

For example, consider a path along an arc of radius , which tangentially connects to a straight line. The whole path is continuous, and its pieces are smooth. Now assume a point particle moves with constant speed along this path, so its tangential acceleration is zero. The centripetal acceleration given by is normal to the arc and inward. When the particle passes the connection of pieces, it experiences a jump-discontinuity in acceleration given by , and it undergoes a jerk that can be modeled by a Dirac delta, scaled to the jump-discontinuity.

For a more tangible example of discontinuous acceleration, consider an ideal spring–mass system with the mass oscillating on an idealized surface with friction. The force on the mass is equal to the vector sum of the spring force and the kinetic frictional force. When the velocity changes sign (at the maximum and minimum displacements), the magnitude of the force on the mass changes by twice the magnitude of the frictional force, because the spring force is continuous and the frictional force reverses direction with velocity. The jump in acceleration equals the force on the mass divided by the mass. That is, each time the mass passes through a minimum or maximum displacement, the mass experiences a discontinuous acceleration, and the jerk contains a Dirac delta until the mass stops. The static friction force adapts to the residual spring force, establishing equilibrium with zero net force and zero velocity.

Consider the example of a braking and decelerating car. The brake pads generate kinetic frictional forces and constant braking torques on the disks (or drums) of the wheels. Rotational velocity decreases linearly to zero with constant angular deceleration. The frictional force, torque, and car deceleration suddenly reach zero, which indicates a Dirac delta in physical jerk. The Dirac delta is smoothed down by the real environment, the cumulative effects of which are analogous to damping of the physiologically perceived jerk. This example neglects the effects of tire sliding, suspension dipping, real deflection of all ideally rigid mechanisms, etc.

Another example of significant jerk, analogous to the first example, is the cutting of a rope with a particle on its end. Assume the particle is oscillating in a circular path with non-zero centripetal acceleration. When the rope is cut, the particle&#x27;s path changes abruptly to a straight path, and the force in the inward direction changes suddenly to zero. Imagine a monomolecular fiber cut by a laser; the particle would experience very high rates of jerk because of the extremely short cutting time.

== In rotation ==
Consider a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis in an inertial reference frame. If its angular position as a function of time is , the angular velocity, acceleration, and jerk can be expressed as follows:

* Angular velocity, formula_4, is the time derivative of .
* Angular acceleration, formula_5, is the time derivative of .
* Angular jerk, formula_6, is the time derivative of .

Angular acceleration equals the torque acting on the body, divided by the body&#x27;s moment of inertia with respect to the momentary axis of rotation. A change in torque results in angular jerk.

The general case of a rotating rigid body can be modeled using kinematic screw theory, which includes one axial vector, angular velocity , and one polar vector, linear velocity . From this, the angular acceleration is defined as

formula_7

and the angular jerk is given by
formula_8

taking the angular acceleration from Angular acceleration#Particle in three dimensions as
formula_9, we obtain

formula_10

replacing formula_11 we can have the last item as
formula_12, and we finally get

formula_13

or vice versa, replacing formula_14 with formula_15:
formula_16

For example, consider a Geneva drive, a device used for creating intermittent rotation of a driven wheel (the blue wheel in the animation) by continuous rotation of a driving wheel (the red wheel in the animation). During one cycle of the driving wheel, the driven wheel&#x27;s angular position changes by 90 degrees and then remains constant. Because of the finite thickness of the driving wheel&#x27;s fork (the slot for the driving pin), this device generates a discontinuity in the angular acceleration , and an unbounded angular jerk in the driven wheel.

Jerk does not preclude the Geneva drive from being used in applications such as movie projectors and cams. In movie projectors, the film advances frame-by-frame, but the projector operation has low noise and is highly reliable because of the low film load (only a small section of film weighing a few grams is driven), the moderate speed (2.4 m/s), and the low friction.
With cam drive systems, use of a dual cam can avoid the jerk of a single cam; however, the dual cam is bulkier and more expensive. The dual-cam system has two cams on one axle that shifts a second axle by a fraction of a revolution. The graphic shows step drives of one-sixth and one-third rotation per one revolution of the driving axle. There is no radial clearance because two arms of the stepped wheel are always in contact with the double cam. Generally, combined contacts may be used to avoid the jerk (and wear and noise) associated with a single follower (such as a single follower gliding along a slot and changing its contact point from one side of the slot to the other can be avoided by using two followers sliding along the same slot, one side each).

== In elastically deformable matter ==

An elastically deformable mass deforms under an applied force (or acceleration); the deformation is a function of its stiffness and the magnitude of the force. If the change in force is slow, the jerk is small, and the propagation of deformation is considered instantaneous as compared to the change in acceleration. The distorted body acts as if it were in a quasistatic regime, and only a changing force (nonzero jerk) can cause propagation of mechanical waves (or electromagnetic waves for a charged particle); therefore, for nonzero to high jerk, a shock wave and its propagation through the body should be considered.

The propagation of deformation is shown in the graphic &quot;Compression wave patterns&quot; as a compressional plane wave through an elastically deformable material. Also shown, for angular jerk, are the deformation waves propagating in a circular pattern, which causes shear stress and possibly other modes of vibration. The reflection of waves along the boundaries cause constructive interference patterns (not pictured), producing stresses that may exceed the material&#x27;s limits. The deformation waves may cause vibrations, which can lead to noise, wear, and failure, especially in cases of resonance.

The graphic captioned &quot;Pole with massive top&quot; shows a block connected to an elastic pole and a massive top. The pole bends when the block accelerates, and when the acceleration stops, the top will oscillate (damped) under the regime of pole stiffness. One could argue that a greater (periodic) jerk might excite a larger amplitude of oscillation because small oscillations are damped before reinforcement by a shock wave. One can also argue that a larger jerk might increase the probability of exciting a resonant mode because the larger wave components of the shock wave have higher frequencies and Fourier coefficients.


To reduce the amplitude of excited stress waves and vibrations, one can limit jerk by shaping motion and making the acceleration continuous with slopes as flat as possible. Due to limitations of abstract models, algorithms for reducing vibrations include higher derivatives, such as jounce, or suggest continuous regimes for both acceleration and jerk. One concept for limiting jerk is to shape acceleration and deceleration sinusoidally with zero acceleration in between (see graphic captioned &quot;Sinusoidal acceleration profile&quot;), making the speed appear sinusoidal with constant maximum speed. The jerk, however, will remain discontinuous at the points where acceleration enters and leaves the zero phases.

== In the geometric design of roads and tracks ==
Roads and tracks are designed to limit the jerk caused by changes in their curvature. Design standards for high-speed rail vary from 0.2 m/s3 to 0.6 m/s3. Track transition curves limit the jerk when transitioning from a straight line to a curve, or vice versa. Recall that in constant-speed motion along an arc, acceleration is zero in the tangential direction and nonzero in the inward normal direction. Transition curves gradually increase the curvature and, consequently, the centripetal acceleration.

An Euler spiral, the theoretically optimum transition curve, linearly increases centripetal acceleration and results in constant jerk (see graphic). In real-world applications, the plane of the track is inclined (cant) along the curved sections. The incline causes vertical acceleration, which is a design consideration for wear on the track and embankment. The Wiener Kurve (Viennese Curve) is a patented curve designed to minimize this wear.

Rollercoasters are also designed with track transitions to limit jerk. When entering a loop, acceleration values can reach around 4&quot;g&quot; (40 m/s2), and riding in this high acceleration environment is only possible with track transitions. S-shaped curves, such as figure eights, also use track transitions for smooth rides.

== In motion control ==
In motion control, the design focus is on straight, linear motion, with the need to move a system from one steady position to another (point-to-point motion). The design concern from a jerk perspective is vertical jerk; the jerk from tangential acceleration is effectively zero since linear motion is non-rotational.

Motion control applications include passenger elevators and machining tools. Limiting vertical jerk is considered essential for elevator riding convenience. ISO 8100-34 specifies measurement methods for elevator ride quality with respect to jerk, acceleration, vibration, and noise; however, the standard does not specify levels for acceptable or unacceptable ride quality. It is reported that most passengers rate a vertical jerk of 2 m/s3 as acceptable and 6 m/s3 as intolerable. For hospitals, 0.7 m/s3 is the recommended limit.

A primary design goal for motion control is to minimize the transition time without exceeding speed, acceleration, or jerk limits. Consider a third-order motion-control profile with quadratic ramping and deramping phases in velocity (see figure).

This motion profile consists of the following seven segments:

# Acceleration build up — positive jerk limit; linear increase in acceleration to the positive acceleration limit; quadratic increase in velocity
# Upper acceleration limit — zero jerk; linear increase in velocity
# Acceleration ramp down — negative jerk limit; linear decrease in acceleration; (negative) quadratic increase in velocity, approaching the desired velocity limit
# Velocity limit — zero jerk; zero acceleration
# Deceleration build up — negative jerk limit; linear decrease in acceleration to the negative acceleration limit; (negative) quadratic decrease in velocity
# Lower deceleration limit — zero jerk; linear decrease in velocity
# Deceleration ramp down — positive jerk limit; linear increase in acceleration to zero; quadratic decrease in velocity; approaching the desired position at zero speed and zero acceleration

Segment four&#x27;s time period (constant velocity) varies with distance between the two positions. If this distance is so small that omitting segment four would not suffice, then segments two and six (constant acceleration) could be equally reduced, and the constant velocity limit would not be reached. If this modification does not sufficiently reduce the crossed distance, then segments one, three, five, and seven could be shortened by an equal amount, and the constant acceleration limits would not be reached.

Other motion profile strategies are used, such as minimizing the square of jerk for a given transition time and, as discussed above, sinusoidal-shaped acceleration profiles. Motion profiles are tailored for specific applications including machines, people movers, chain hoists, automobiles, and robotics.

=== In manufacturing ===
Jerk is an important consideration in manufacturing processes. Rapid changes in acceleration of a cutting tool can lead to premature tool wear and result in uneven cuts; consequently, modern motion controllers include jerk limitation features. In mechanical engineering, jerk, in addition to velocity and acceleration, is considered in the development of cam profiles because of tribological implications and the ability of the actuated body to follow the cam profile without chatter.
Jerk is often considered when vibration is a concern. A device that measures jerk is called a &quot;jerkmeter&quot;.

==Further derivatives==

Further time derivatives have also been named, as snap or jounce (fourth derivative), crackle (fifth derivative), and pop (sixth derivative). The seventh derivative is known as &quot;Bang,&quot; as it is a logical continuation to the cycle. The eighth derivative has been referred to as &quot;Boom,&quot; and the 9th is known as &quot;Crash.&quot; However, time derivatives of position of higher order than four appear rarely.

The terms &quot;snap&quot;, &quot;crackle&quot;, and &quot;pop&quot;for the fourth, fifth, and sixth derivatives of positionwere inspired by the advertising mascots Snap, Crackle, and Pop.

<text>Sir John Ambrose Fleming (29 November 1849 – 18 April 1945) was an English electrical engineer and physicist who invented the vacuum tube, designed the radio transmitter with which the first transatlantic radio transmission was made, and also established the right-hand rule used in physics.

He was the eldest of seven children of James Fleming DD (died 1879), a Congregational minister, and his wife Mary Ann, at Lancaster, Lancashire, and baptised on 11 February 1850. A devout Christian, he once preached at St Martin-in-the-Fields in London on evidence for the resurrection.

In 1932, he and Douglas Dewar and Bernard Acworth helped establish the Evolution Protest Movement. Fleming bequeathed much of his estate to Christian charities, especially those for the poor. He was a noted photographer, painted watercolours, and enjoyed climbing the Alps.

==Early years==
Ambrose Fleming was born in Lancaster and educated at Lancaster Royal Grammar School, University College School, London, and then University College London, where he obtained a BSc in 1870. He entered St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1877, gaining a DSc from the University of London in 1879 and a BA from Cambridge in 1881, before becoming a fellow of St John&#x27;s in 1883. He went on to lecture at several universities including the University of Cambridge, University College Nottingham, and University College London, where he was the first professor of electrical engineering. He was also a consultant to the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company, Swan Company, Ferranti, Edison Telephone, and later the Edison Electric Light Company. In 1892, Fleming presented an important paper on electrical transformer theory to the Institution of Electrical Engineers in London.

==Education and marriages==

Fleming started school at about the age of ten, attending a private school where he particularly enjoyed geometry. Prior to that his mother tutored him and he had learned, virtually by heart, a book called the &quot;Child&#x27;s Guide to Knowledge&quot;, a popular book of the day – even as an adult he would quote from it. His schooling continued at the University College School where, although accomplished at maths, he habitually came bottom of the class at Latin.

Even as a boy he wanted to become an engineer. At 11 he had his own workshop where he built model boats and engines. He even built his own camera, the start of a lifelong interest in photography. Training to become an engineer was beyond the family&#x27;s financial resources, but he reached his goal via a path that alternated education with paid employment.

Fleming enrolled for a BSc degree at University College London, graduated in 1870, and studied under the mathematician Augustus De Morgan and the physicist George Carey Foster. He became a student of chemistry at the Royal College of Science in South Kensington in London (now Imperial College). There he first studied Alessandro Volta&#x27;s battery, which became the subject of his first scientific paper. This was the first paper to be read to the new Physical Society of London (now the Institute of Physics) and appears on page one of volume one of their Proceedings.

Financial problems again forced him to work for a living and in the summer of 1874 he became science master at Cheltenham College, a public school, earning £400 per year. (He later also taught at Rossall School.) His own scientific research continued and he corresponded with James Clerk Maxwell at Cambridge University. After saving £400, and securing a grant of £50 a year, in October 1877 at the age of 27, he once again enrolled as a student, this time at Cambridge.

He was among the &quot;two or perhaps three University students who attended Maxwell&#x27;s last Course&quot;. Maxwell&#x27;s lectures, he admitted, were difficult to follow. Maxwell, he said, often appeared obscure and had &quot;a paradoxical and allusive way of speaking&quot;. On occasions Fleming was the only student at those lectures. Fleming again graduated, this time with a First Class Honours degree in chemistry and physics. He then obtained a DSc from London and served one year at Cambridge University as a demonstrator of mechanical engineering before being appointed as the first Professor of Physics and Mathematics at University College Nottingham, but he left after less than a year.

On 11 June 1887, he married Clara Ripley (1856/7–1917), daughter of Walter Freake Pratt, a solicitor from Bath. On 27 July 1928 he married the popular young singer Olive May Franks (b. 1898/9), of Bristol, daughter of George Franks, a Cardiff businessman.

==Activities and achievements==

After leaving the University of Nottingham in 1882, Fleming took up the post of &quot;electrician&quot; to the Edison Electrical Light Company, advising on lighting systems and the new Ferranti alternating current systems. In 1884 Fleming joined University College London taking up the Chair of Electrical Technology, the first of its kind in England. Although this offered great opportunities, he recalls in his autobiography that the only equipment provided to him was a blackboard and piece of chalk. In 1897 the Pender Laboratory was founding at University College London and Fleming took up the Pender Chair after the £5000 was endowed as a memorial to John Pender, the founder of Cable and Wireless.

In 1899 Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of radiotelegraphy, decided to attempt transatlantic radio communication. This would require a scale-up in power from the small 200–400 watt transmitters Marconi had used up to then. He contracted Fleming, an expert in power engineering, to design the radio transmitter. Fleming designed the world&#x27;s first large radio transmitter, a complicated spark transmitter powered by a 25 kW alternator driven by a combustion engine, built at Poldhu in Cornwall, UK, which transmitted the first radio transmission across the Atlantic on 12 December 1901.

Although Fleming was responsible for the design, the director of the Marconi Co. had made Fleming agree that: &quot;If we get across the Atlantic, the main credit will be and must forever be Mr. Marconi&#x27;s&quot;. Accordingly, the worldwide acclaim that greeted this landmark accomplishment went to Marconi, who only credited Fleming along with several other Marconi employees, saying he did some work on the &quot;power plant&quot;. Marconi also forgot a promise to give Fleming 500 shares of Marconi stock if the project was successful. Fleming was bitter about his treatment. He honoured his agreement and did not speak about it throughout Marconi&#x27;s life, but after his death in 1937 said Marconi had been &quot;very ungenerous&quot;.

In 1904, working for the Marconi company to improve transatlantic radio reception, Fleming invented the first thermionic vacuum tube, the two-electrode diode, which he called the oscillation valve, for which he received a patent on 16 November. It became known as the Fleming valve. The Supreme Court of the United States later invalidated the patent because of an improper disclaimer and, additionally, maintained the technology in the patent was known art when filed.

This invention of the vacuum tube is often considered to have been the beginning of electronics. Fleming&#x27;s diode was used in radio receivers and radars for many decades afterwards, until it was superseded by solid state electronic technology more than 50 years later.

In 1906, Lee De Forest of the US added a control &quot;grid&quot; to the valve to create an amplifying vacuum tube RF detector called the &quot;Audion&quot;, leading Fleming to accuse him of infringing his patents. De Forest&#x27;s tube developed into the triode the first electronic amplifier. The triode was vital in the creation of long-distance telephone and radio communications, radars, and early electronic digital computers (mechanical and electro-mechanical digital computers already existed using different technology). The court battle over these patents lasted for many years with victories at different stages for both sides. Fleming also contributed in the fields of photometry, electronics, wireless telegraphy (radio), and electrical measurements. He coined the term &quot;power factor&quot; to describe the true power flowing in an AC power system.

Fleming retired from University College London in 1927 at the age of 77. He remained active, becoming a committed advocate of the new technology of Television which included serving as the second president of the Television Society. He was knighted in 1929, and died at his home in Sidmouth, Devon in 1945. His contributions to electronic communications and radar were of vital importance in winning World War II. Fleming was awarded the IRE Medal of Honor in 1933 for &quot;the conspicuous part he played in introducing physical and engineering principles into the radio art&quot;.

In 1941 the London Power Company commemorated Fleming by naming a new 1,555 GRT coastal collier SS &quot;Ambrose Fleming&quot;.

On 27 November 2004 a Blue Plaque presented by the Institute of Physics was unveiled at the Norman Lockyer Observatory, Sidmouth, to mark 100 years since the invention of the thermionic radio valve.

==Creationism==

Fleming was a Christian creationist who argued against evolution. He was President of the Victoria Institute from 1927 to 1942.

== Collections ==
In 1945 Fleming&#x27;s widow donated Fleming&#x27;s library and papers to University College London. Fleming&#x27;s library, which totals around 950 items, includes first editions of works by prominent scientists and engineers such as James Clerk Maxwell, Oliver Lodge, James Dewar and Shelford Bidwell. Fleming&#x27;s archive spans 521 volumes and 12 boxes; it contains his laboratory notebooks, lecture notes, patent specifications, and correspondence.

<text>John George of Brandenburg (; 11 September 1525 – 8 January 1598) was a prince-elector of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (1571–1598).

== Early life ==
Born as a member of the House of Hohenzollern, he was the son of Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg, and his first wife Princess Magdalena of Saxony.

== Biography ==
Faced with large debts of 2.5 million guilder accumulated during the reign of his father, John George instituted a grain tax which drove part of the peasantry into dependence on a nobility that was exempt from taxation. He had Jews expelled from Brandenburg in 1573, stripped of their assets and prohibited from returning. Though a staunch Lutheran opposed to the rise of Calvinism, he permitted the admission of Calvinist refugees from the wars in the Spanish Netherlands and France. On 13 July 1574, he founded the Berlinisches Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster, the first humanistic educational institution in Berlin. He was succeeded by his son Joachim Frederick.

Upon the death of his kinsman Albert I, Duke of Prussia in 1568, the Duchy of Prussia was inherited by the latter&#x27;s underage son Albert Frederick. John George&#x27;s father was a co-inheritor of the Duchy of Prussia. In 1577 the Brandenburg electors became co-regent with Duke Albert Frederick of Prussia.

<doc id="16294" wikidata="Q83653" url="?curid=16294" title="Jahangir">
<text>Nur-ud-din Muhammad Salim (31 August 1569 – 28 October 1627), known by his imperial name Jahangir (; ), was Emperor of Hindustan from 1605 until his death in 1627, and the fourth Mughal Emperor.

Born as Prince Salim, he was the third and only surviving son of Emperor Akbar and his chief empress, Mariam-uz-Zamani. Akbar&#x27;s quest for a successor took him to visit the Hazrat Ishaan and Salim Chishti, Sufi saints who prophesied the birth of three sons. Jahangir&#x27;s birth in Fatehpur Sikri was seen as a fulfillment of Chishti&#x27;s blessings, and he was named after him. His early life was marked by personal tragedy, including the death of his twin brothers in infancy, which led to a sense of grief in his family. His early education was comprehensive, covering various subjects including Persian, Hindustani, and military tactics. Jahangir&#x27;s upbringing was heavily influenced by the cultural and spiritual heritage of his family, setting the stage for his later rule as emperor.

His reign was marked by a combination of artistic achievement and political intrigue, set against the backdrop of the Mughal Empire&#x27;s considerable expansion and consolidation. Jahangir&#x27;s rule is distinguished by his commitment to justice and his interest in the arts, particularly painting and architecture, which flourished during his reign. Jahangir&#x27;s reign was characterized by a complex relationship with his nobility and family, notably reflected in his marriage to Mehar-un-Nisa (later known as Empress Nur Jahan), who wielded significant political influence behind the throne. This period saw the empire&#x27;s further entrenchment into the Indian subcontinent, including efforts to subdue the Rajput Kingdoms and extend Mughal authority into the Deccan. Jahangir&#x27;s foreign policy included interactions with the Safavids of Persia and the Ottoman Empire, as well as with the English East India Company, marking the beginning of European influence in Indian politics and commerce.

Despite his achievements, Jahangir&#x27;s reign had challenges, including revolts led by his sons, which threatened the stability of his rule. His poor health, caused by a lifetime of opium and alcohol use, led to his death in 1627, precipitating a brief succession crisis before the throne passed to his son, Shah Jahan. Jahangir&#x27;s legacy lives on through his contributions to Mughal art and architecture, his memoirs, and the policies he implemented, which continued to influence the empire after his demise.

== Early life ==
Prince Salim was the third son born to Akbar and Mariam-uz-Zamani in the capital city of Fatehpur Sikri on 31 August 1569. He had two elder twin brothers, Hassan and Hussain Mirza, born in 1564, both of whom died in infancy. Grief-struck, Akbar took Mariam-uz-Zamani along with him after their sons&#x27; demise as he set out for a war campaign, and, during his return to Agra, he sought the blessings of Salim Chishti, a reputed khawaja (religious leader) who lived at Fatehpur Sikri. Akbar confided in Salim Chisti, who assured him that he would be soon delivered of three sons who would live up to a ripe old age. A few years before the birth of Prince Salim, Akbar and Mariam-uz-Zamani went on a pilgrimage to Ajmer Sharif Dargah to pray for a son.

When Akbar was informed of the news that his chief Hindu wife was expecting a child, an order was passed for the establishment of a royal palace in Fatehpur Sikri near the lodgings of Salim Chishti, where the Empress could enjoy the repose in the vicinity of the saint. Mariam was shifted to the palace established there and during her pregnancy, Akbar himself used to travel to Sikri and used to spend half of his time in Sikri and another half in Agra.

One day, while Mariam-uz-Zamani was pregnant with Salim, the baby stopped kicking in the womb abruptly. Akbar was at that time hunting cheetahs when this matter was reported to him. Thinking if he could have done anything more for the safety of his unborn child, he vowed that from that day he would never hunt cheetahs on Fridays and Salim notes in his autobiography that Akbar kept his vow throughout his life. Salim, too, in reverence for his father&#x27;s vow, never hunted cheetahs on Friday. When Mariam-uz-Zamani was near her confinement, she was shifted to the humble dwelling of Salim by Akbar where she gave birth to Salim. He was named after Salim, given the faith of Akbar in the efficacy of the prayers of the holy man. Jahangir&#x27;s foster mother was the daughter of Salim Chishti, and his foster brother was Qutubuddin Koka, the grandson of Chishti.

Jahangir began his education at the age of five. On this occasion, a big feast was thrown by the Emperor to ceremonially initiate his son into education. His first tutor was Qutubuddin Koka. Many other tutors were appointed to teach Persian, Arabic, Turkish, Hindi, Arithmetic, History, Geography, and Sciences. Abdur Rahim Khan-i-Khanan, one of the versatile geniuses, was an important tutor of him. His maternal uncle, Bhagwant Das the Kachhwaha ruler of Amer, was supposedly one of his tutors on the subject of warfare tactics. During this time, Jahangir grew up fluent in Persian and premodern Urdu, with a &quot;respectable&quot; knowledge of Persianified courtly Chaghatai (&quot;Turki&quot;), the Mughal ancestral language.

On 24 February 1585, Jahangir married the Kachwaha Rajput princess of Amer, Kunwari Manbhawat Deiji, in her native town Amer. A lavish ceremony took place in Amber Fort and the bride&#x27;s palanquin was carried by Akbar and Salim for some distance in her honor. The gifts given by Mariam-uz-Zamani to the bride and bride-groom were valued at twelve lakh rupees. She became his favorite wife and soon rose to the level of a consort rather than being a mere wife. Jahangir notes that he was extremely fond of her and designated her as his chief consort in the royal harem in his princely days. Jahangir also records his attachment and affection for her and makes notes of her unwavering devotion towards him. Jahangir honored her with the title &quot;Shah Begum&quot; after she gave birth to Prince Khusrau Mirza, the eldest son of Jahangir.

On 11 January 1586, Jahangir married one of his early favorite wives, a Rathore Rajput princess Kunwari Manawati Deiji, daughter of Mota Raja Udai Singh of the Kingdom of Marwar, at the bride&#x27;s residence, i.e., Jodhpur After her death, Jahangir honored her with the title of &quot;Bilqis Makani&quot; (). She gave birth to two daughters of Salim, both of whom died during childhood and Prince Khurram, the future emperor Shah Jahan, who was Jahangir&#x27;s successor to the throne. On 26 June, Jahangir married a second Rathore Rajput princess, Kunwari Sujas Deiji, daughter of Raja Rai Singh of Bikaner, an offshoot of Jodhpur. In July, he married Malika Shikar Begum daughter of Abu Sa&#x27;id Khan Chagatai. Also in 1586, he married Sahib-i-Jamal Begum daughter of Khwaja Hasan of Herat in Afghanistan a cousin of Zain Khan Koka.

In 1587, he married a Bhati Rajput princess (name not known) entitled Malika Jahan Begum daughter of Rawal Bhim Singh of the Kingdom of Jaisalmer. He also married the daughter of Raja Darya Malbhas.

In October 1590, Jahangir married Zohra Begum daughter of Mirza Sanjar Hazara. He married a third Rathore Rajput princess, Kunwari Karamsi Deiji, daughter of Rao Keshav Das of Merta linked with the house of Marwar. On 11 January 1592, he married Kanwal Rani daughter of Ali Sher Khan by his wife Gul Khatun. In October 1592, he married a daughter of Sultan Husain Chak of the Kashmir Sultanate. In January/March 1593, he married Nur un-Nisa Begum daughter of a Safavid Persian prince Ibrahim Husain Mirza by his wife Gulrukh Begum a daughter of Kamran Mirza brother of Mughal Emperor Humayun. In September 1593, he married a daughter of Sultan Ali Khan Faruqi of the Khandesh Sultanate. He also married a daughter of Abdullah Khan Baluch of Sind.
In 1594, Jahangir was dispatched by his father, Akbar, alongside Asaf Khan also known as Mirza Jafar Beg and Abu&#x27;l-Fazl ibn Mubarak to defeat the renegade Raja Vir Singh Deo Bundela and to capture the city of Orchha which was considered the centre of the revolt. Jahangir arrived with a force of 12,000 after many ferocious encounters and finally subdued the Bundela and ordered Vir Singh Deo to surrender. After tremendous casualties and the start of negotiations between the two, Vir Singh Deo handed over 5000 Bundela infantry and 1000 cavalry and submitted to the command of Jahangir along with taking up imperial services at the court later. The victorious Jahangir, at 26 years of age, ordered the completion of the Jahangir Mahal a famous Mughal citadel in Orchha to commemorate and honour his victory.

From the very beginning of Jahangir reign as emperor, he witnessed the internal rivalry of the bundela chiefs for control. Jahangir appointed his favourite Vir Singh, as the ruler of Orchha by removing his elder brother Raja Ram Shah. This greatly hampered the interest of Ram Shah&#x27;s house. Thus, Ram Shah along with his family members Bharat Shah, Indrajit, Rao Bhupal, Angad, Prema, and Devi (the wife of the deposed king) raised their arms in rebellion. However, Ram Shah was defeated by his brother Vir Singh with the help of imperial army under Abdullah Khan. Then the deposed Bundela chief escaped and continued to fight the Mughals for two years until he was finally arrested in 1607 and put in prison at Gwalior only later to be given the territory of Chanderi as his patrimony.

On 28 June 1596, he married Khas Mahal Begum daughter of Zain Khan Koka the imperial Subahdar of Kabul and Lahore. This marriage was initially opposed by Akbar as he did not approve of the marriage of cousins to the same man however seeing the melancholy of Salim being refused to marry her, Akbar approved of this union. She became one of his chief consorts after her marriage.

In 1608, he married Saliha Banu Begum, daughter of Qasim Khan a senior member of the Imperial Household. She became one of his chief consorts and was designated the honorary title of &quot;Padshah Begum&quot; and for most of the reign of Jahangir retained this title. After her death, this title was passed to Nur Jahan.

On 17 June 1608, he married a second Kachwaha Rajput princess, Kunwari Koka Kumari, eldest daughter of Jagat Singh, the deceased heir apparent or &quot;Yuvraj&quot; of Amber and granddaughter of Mirza Raja Man Singh I. This marriage was held at the palace of Jahangir&#x27;s mother, Mariam-uz-Zamani, in Agra. On 11 January 1610, he accepted the hand of the daughter of Raja Ram Shah Bundela of Orchha in marriage to mark a formal end to the hostilities between them.

At some point, he had also married Kabuli Begum daughter of Mirza Muhammad Hakim son of Emperor Humayun. She was also one of the later chief consorts of Jahangir.

Jahangir married Mehr-un-Nisa (better known by her subsequent title of Nur Jahan) on 25 May 1611. She was the widow of a high-ranking Persian nobleman Sher Afgan. Mehr-un-Nisa became his utmost favorite wife after their marriage and was the last of his chief consorts. She was witty, intelligent, and beautiful, which attracted Jahangir to her. Before being awarded the title of Nur Jahan (&#x27;Light of the World&#x27;), she was called Nur Mahal (&#x27;Light of the Palace&#x27;). After the death of Saliha Bano Begum in the year 1620, she was designated the title of &quot;Padshah Begum&quot; and held it until the death of Jahangir in 1627. Her abilities are said to range from fashion and jewellery designing, perfumery, hunting to building architectural monuments and more.

== Reign ==

He succeeded the throne on Thursday, 3 November 1605, eight days after his father&#x27;s death. Salim ascended the throne with the imperial grand title of Nuruddin Muhammad Jahangir Badshah Ghazi and thus began his 22-year reign at the age of 36.

Soon after, Jahangir had to fend off his son Khusrau Mirza when he attempted to claim the throne based on Akbar&#x27;s will. Khusrau Mirza was defeated in the year 1606 with the support of the Barha and Bukhari sāda and confined in the fort of Agra. Jahangir was found to be more militarily capable, and he crushed the rebellion in a week. Jahangir had all the young aristocrat supporters of Khusrau tortured, impaled and made him watch them in agony as a warning. After a rebellion the second time, as punishment, Khusrau Mirza was handed over to his younger brother and was partially blinded. 

From the time of his marriage with Mehr-un-Nissa, later known as Empress Nur Jahan, Jahangir left the reins of government in her hands and appointed her family and relatives to high positions. Nur Jahan had complete freedom of speech near Jahangir without any reprimand. On the contrary, she could nag and fight with him on the smallest issue. Thus, her unprecedented freedom of action to control the state caused the displeasure of both his courtiers and foreigners.

In 1608, Jahangir posted Islam Khan I to subdue the rebel Musa Khan, the Masnad-e-Ala of the Baro-Bhuyan confederacy in Bengal, who was able to imprison him. 
In 1613, Jahangir issued a sanguinary order for the extirpation of the race of the Kolis who were notorious robbers and plunders living in the most inaccessible parts of the province of Gujarat. A large number of the Koli chiefs were slaughtered and the rest hunted to their mountains and deserts. 169 heads of such Koli chiefs killed in battle by Nur-ul-llah Ibrahim, commander of &#x27;Bollodo&#x27;. In the same year later, the Portuguese seized the Mughal ship &quot;Rahimi&quot;, which had set out from Surat on its way with a large cargo of 100,000 rupees and Pilgrims, who were on their way to Mecca and Medina to attend the annual Hajj. The &quot;Rahimi&quot; was owned by Mariam-uz-Zamani, mother of Jahangir and Akbar&#x27;s favourite consort. She was bestowed the title of &#x27;Mallika-e-Hindustan&#x27; (Queen of Hindustan) by Akbar and was subsequently referred to as same during Jahangir&#x27;s reign. The &quot;Rahimi&quot; was the largest Indian ship sailing in the Red Sea and was known to the Europeans as the &quot;great pilgrimage ship&quot;. When the Portuguese officially refused to return the ship and the passengers, the outcry at the Mughal court was unusually severe. The outrage was compounded by the fact that the owner and the patron of the ship was none other than the revered mother of the current emperor. Jahangir himself was outraged and ordered the seizure of the Portuguese town Daman. He ordered the apprehension of all Portuguese within the Mughal Empire; he further confiscated churches that belonged to the Jesuits. This episode is considered to be an example of the struggle for wealth that would later ensue and lead to colonisation of the Indian sub-continent. Jahangir then gathered his forces under the command of Ali Kuli Khan and fought Raja Lakshmi Narayan Bhup of the Kingdom of Koch Bihar in the far eastern province of Bengal. Raja Lakshmi Narayan then accepted the Mughals as his suzerains and was given the title &quot;Nazir&quot;, later establishing a garrison at Atharokotha. Jahangir was responsible for ending a century-long struggle with the Sisodia Rajput house of Mewar. The campaign against them was pushed so extensively that they were made to submit with great loss of life and property.

In 1614, The East India Company persuaded King James I to send a British ambassador to the Mughal court, Thomas Roe. Thomas Roe describes how petitioners could use the chain of justice to attract the emperor&#x27;s attention if his decision was not to their satisfaction during Darshana. The Darshana tradition was adopted by the Mughal Emperors from Hindu religio-political rituals. As a royal envoy to the Agra court of Jahangir. Roe resided at Agra for three years, until 1619. At the Mughal court, Roe allegedly became a favourite of Jahangir and may have been his drinking partner; he arrived with gifts of &quot;many crates of red wine&quot; and explained to him what beer was and how it was made. The immediate result of the mission was to obtain permission and protection for an East India Company factory at Surat. While no major trading privileges were conceded by Jahangir, &quot;Roe&#x27;s mission was the beginning of a Mughal-Company relationship that would develop into something approaching a partnership and see the &quot;EIC&quot; gradually drawn into the Mughal nexus&quot;. While Roe&#x27;s detailed journals are a valuable source of information on Jahangir&#x27;s reign, the Emperor did not return the favour, with no mention of Roe in his voluminous diaries.

In 1615, Jahangir captured Kangra Fort, whose Katoch rulers came under Mughal vassalship during the reign of Akbar. Consequently, a siege was laid and the fort was taken in 1620, which &quot;resulted in the submission of the Raja of Chamba who was the greatest of all the rajas in the region.&quot; The district of Kishtwar, in the vast province of Kashmir, was also conquered the same year.

In October 1616, Jahangir sent Prince Khurram to fight against the combined forces of three rebel kingdoms of Ahmednagar, Bijapur and Golconda. Jahangir considered his third son, Khurram (regnal name Shah Jahan) as his favourite son. 

In 1621 of February, However, when Nur Jahan married her daughter, Mihr-un-nissa Begum, to Jahangir&#x27;s youngest son, Shahryar Mirza, Khurram suspected that his stepmother was trying to maneuver Shahryar as the successor to Jahangir. Using the rugged terrain of Deccan to his advantage, Khurram launched a rebellion against Jahangir in 1622. This precipitated a political crisis in Jahangir&#x27;s court. Khurram murdered his blind older brother, Khusrau Mirza, to smooth his path to the throne. Simultaneously, the Safavid emperor Abbas the Great attacked Kandahar in the winter of 1622. Since it was both a commercial center at the border of the Mughal Empire and the burial place of Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, Jahangir dispatched Prince Shahryar to repel the Safavids. However, due to Shahryar&#x27;s inexperience and harsh Afghan winter, Kandahar fell to the Safavids.

In 1623, Emperor Jahangir sent his &quot;tehsildar&quot;, Khan Alam, to Safavid Persia, accompanied by 800 sepoys, scribes and scholars, along with ten howdahs well decorated in gold and silver, to negotiate peace with Emperor Abbas after a brief conflict in the region around Kandahar. Khan Alam soon returned with valuable gifts and groups of masters of the hunt () from both Safavid Iran and the Khanates of Central Asia. On March, Jahangir ordered Mahabat Khan, one of Jahangir&#x27;s most loyal high generals, to crush Khurram&#x27;s rebellion in the Deccan. After a series of victories by Mahabat Khan over Khurram, the civil war finally ended in October 1625.

In 1626, Jahangir began to contemplate an alliance between the Ottoman Empire, the Mughals, and the Khanate of Bukhara of the Uzbeks against the Safavids, who had defeated the Mughals at Kandahar. He even wrote a letter to the Ottoman Sultan, Murad IV. Jahangir&#x27;s ambition did not materialise due to his death in 1627.

== Death ==
A lifelong user of opium and wine, Jahangir was frequently ill in the 1620s. Jahangir was trying to restore his health by visiting Kashmir and Kabul. He went from Kabul to Kashmir but decided to return to Lahore because of a severe cold.

In 1627 on 29 October, during the journey from Kashmir to Lahore, Jahangir died near Bhimber. To embalm and preserve his body, the entrails were removed; these were buried inside Baghsar Fort near Bhimber in Kashmir. The body was then conveyed by palanquin to Lahore and was buried in Shahdara Bagh, a suburb of that city. His son, Shah Jahan, commissioned his tomb and is today a popular tourist attraction site.

Jahangir&#x27;s death launched a minor succession crisis. While Nur Jahan desired her son-in-law, Shahryar Mirza, to take the throne, her brother Abu&#x27;l-Hassan Asaf Khan was corresponding with his son-in-law, Prince Khurram to take over the throne. To counter Nur Jahan, Abu&#x27;l Hassan put Dawar Bakhsh as the puppet ruler and confined Nur Jahan in the Shahdara. Upon his arrival in Agra in February 1628, Prince Khurram executed both Shahryar and Dawar and took the regnal name Shah Jahan (Shihab-ud-Din Muhammad Khurram).

== Personal life ==
Jahangir was famous for his &quot;Chain of Justice&quot;. In contemporary paintings, it has been shown as a golden chain with golden bells. In his memoir &quot;Tuzk-e-Jahangiri&quot;, he wrote that he ordered the creation of this chain for his subjects to appeal to the emperor if they were denied justice at any level.

Jahangir also took interest in public health and medicine. After his accession, he passed twelve orders, of which at least two were related to this area. The fifth order forbade the manufacturing and sale of rice spirit and any kind of intoxicating drugs, and the tenth order was instrumental in laying the foundation of free hospitals and appointment of physicians in all the cities of his empire.

=== Religious view ===

According to M. Athar Ali, Jahangir generally continued the religious policy of Akbar and had a major interest in pantheism.

At the start of his regime, many staunch Sunnis were hopeful, because he seemed less tolerant of other faiths than his father had been. At the time of his accession and the elimination of Abu&#x27;l Fazl, his father&#x27;s chief minister and the architect of his eclectic religious stance, a powerful group of orthodox noblemen had gained increased power in the Mughal court. This included nobles especially like Shaykh Farid, Jahangir&#x27;s trusted Mir Bakhshi, who held firmly the citadel of orthodoxy in Muslim India. Another influence for Jahangir changed his religious policies was due to the action of Ahmad Sirhindi, who routinely attend the court debates to counteract some religious beliefs and doctrines which prevalent in the court. In the process, it is recorded from these correspondence which compiled in 1617, that Farid Murtaza Khan took Ahmad Sirhindi advices regarding this matter. His efforts influenced Abul Fazl, protegee of emperor Akbar, to support Ahmad Sirhindi in effort to convince Jahangir to reverse the policies of Akbar of tolerating Hindus in Mughal court. Yohanan Friedmann has noted that according to many modern historians and thinkers, the puritanical though of Ahmad Sirhindi has inspired the religious orthodoxy of emperor Aurangzeb. This was noted by how Ahmad Sirhindi manage to influence the successor of emperor Akbar, starting from Jahangir, into reversing Akbar policies such as lifting marriage age limits, mosque abolishments, and &quot;Hijra&quot; methodology revival which abandoned by his father. It is noted by historians that this influence has been significantly recorded during the conquest of Kangra under Jahangir, that at the presence of Ahmad Sirhindi who observed the campaign, the Mughal forces had the Idols broken, a cow slaughtered, Khutbah sermon read, and other Islamic rituals performed. Further mark of Jahangir departure from Akbar secular policy were recorded Terry, a traveller, who came and observed India region between 1616 and 1619, where he found the mosques full of worshippers, the exaltation of Quran and Hadith practical teaching, and the complete observance of Fasting during Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr celebrations.

Jahangir issued bans on cowslaugher and animal slaughter on certain days of the week in continuance of his father&#x27;s policy. According to the &quot;Dabistan-i Mazahib&quot; he appointed Srikant of Kashmir to be qazi of the Hindus so that they would have their own judicial representative. He also continued his father&#x27;s policy of patronizing Brahmins and temples. Notably he issued several grants to the Chaitanya sect for their temples in Vrindavan, but also made negative comments about their temples. He, like his father, dissaproved of reincarnation and idol worship and ordered the boar image to be removed from Rana Shankar&#x27;s temple at Pushkar.

Most notorious was the execution of the Sikh Guru Arjan Dev on Jahangir&#x27;s orders. His lands were confiscated and his sons imprisoned as Jahangir suspected him of helping Khusrau&#x27;s rebellion. It is unclear whether Jahangir even understood what a Sikh was, referring to Guru Arjan as a Hindu, who had &quot;captured many of the simple-hearted of the Hindus and even of the ignorant and foolish followers of Islam, by his ways and manners... for three or four generations (of spiritual successors) they had kept this shop warm.&quot; The trigger for Guru Arjan&#x27;s execution was his support for Jahangir&#x27;s rebel son Khusrau Mirza, yet it is clear from Jahangir&#x27;s own memoirs that he disliked Guru Arjan before then: &quot;many times it occurred to me to put a stop to this vain affair or bring him into the assembly of the people of Islam.&quot; Guru Arjan&#x27;s successor Guru Hargobind was imprisoned for sometime but released soon. He developed friendly relations with Jahangir and accompanied him on his journey to Kashmir just before the latter&#x27;s death.

According to Jahangir&#x27;s memoirs, he issued a farman banning Jain seorahs (monks) due to alleged scandalous behavior. However, the ban was quickly rescinded but Jahangir neglected to mention that in his memoirs. There is a wide variety of evidence that Jahangir had good relations with Jains and Jain sources themselves extol him. According to Ali, Jahangir wrote his memoirs with his intended audience of Persian-speaking Muslims in mind and sought to portray himself as an anti-idolatry sultan and thus &quot;modified&quot; facts. Jahangir&#x27;s memoirs also omit the fact that three of his nephews at one point converted to Christianity with his permission, although they would later reverse their decision.

He issued &#x27;Jahangiri coins&#x27; which had his own portrait. He even issued the zodiac series of gold and silver coins which had images of zodiac symbols alongside the radiating sun in the background, due to his faith in astrology. The sign of the zodiac was substituted for the month in which the coin was minted. All of this was considered haram by the ulema due to which his successor Shahjahan ordered all those coins melted, accounting for their extreme rarity now.

According to Richard M Eaton, Emperor Jahangir issued many edicts admonishing his nobles not to convert the religion of anybody by force, but the issuance of such orders also suggests that such conversions must have occurred during his rule in some measure. He continued the Mughals tradition of being scrupulously secular in outlook. Stability, loyalty, and revenue were the main focus, not the religious change among their subjects.

=== Art ===

Jahangir was fascinated with art and architecture. In his autobiography, the Jahangirnama, Jahangir recorded events that occurred during his reign, descriptions of flora and fauna that he encountered, and other aspects of daily life, and commissioned court painters such as Ustad Mansur to paint detailed pieces that would accompany his vivid prose. For example, in 1619, he put pen to paper in awe of a royal falcon delivered to his court from the ruler of Iran: &quot;What can I write of the beauty of this bird&#x27;s colour? It had black markings, and every feather on its wings, back, and sides was extremely beautiful,&quot; and then recorded his command that Ustad Mansur paint a portrait of it after it perished. &quot;Nadiri&quot; was a type of exclusive clothing designed by Jahangir, reserved for his personal use and esteemed courtiers. Jahangir bound and displayed much of the art that he commissioned in elaborate albums of hundreds of images, sometimes organized around a theme such as zoology.

Jahangir himself was far from modest in his autobiography when he stated his prowess at being able to determine the artist of any portrait by simply looking at a painting. As he said: 

Jahangir took his connoisseurship of art very seriously. He also preserved paintings from Emperor Akbar&#x27;s period. An excellent example of this is the painting done by Ustad Mansur of Musician Naubat Khan, son-in-law of legendary Tansen. In addition to their aesthetic qualities, paintings created under his reign were closely catalogued, dated and even signed, providing scholars with fairly accurate ideas as to when and in what context many of the pieces were created.

In the foreword to W. M. Thackston&#x27;s translation of the Jahangirnama, Milo Cleveland Beach explains that Jahangir ruled during a time of considerably stable political control, and had the opportunity to order artists to create art to accompany his memoirs that were &quot;in response to the emperor&#x27;s current enthusiasms&quot;. He used his wealth and his luxury of free time to chronicle, in detail, the lush natural world that the Mughal Empire encompassed. At times, he would have artists travel with him for this purpose; when Jahangir was in Rahimabad, he had his painters on hand to capture the appearance of a specific tiger that he shot and killed because he found it to be particularly beautiful. 

He had his artist Govardhan travel to Prayagraj(Allahabad) to paint sadhus. This resulted in the earliest set of images depicting sadhus in all yogic positions. 

The Jesuits had brought with them various books, engravings, and paintings and, when they saw the delight Akbar held for them, sent for more and more of the same to be given to the Mughals. They felt the Mughals were on the &quot;verge of conversion&quot;, a notion which proved to be very false. Instead, both Akbar and Jahangir studied this artwork very closely and replicated and adapted it, adopting much of the early iconographic features and later the pictorial realism for which Renaissance art was known. Jahangir was notable for his pride in the ability of his court painters. A classic example of this is described in Sir Thomas Roe&#x27;s diaries, in which the Emperor had his painters copy a European miniature several times creating a total of five miniatures. Jahangir then challenged Roe to pick out the original from the copies, a feat Sir Thomas Roe could not do, to the delight of Jahangir.

Jahangir was also revolutionary in his adaptation of European styles. A collection at the British Museum in London contains seventy-four drawings of Indian portraits dating from the time of Jahangir, including a portrait of the emperor himself. These portraits are a unique example of art during Jahangir&#x27;s reign because faces were not drawn in full, including the shoulders as well as the head as these drawings are.&quot;
=== Politics ===
Jahangir is widely considered to have been a weak and incapable ruler. Orientalist Henry Beveridge (editor of the &quot;Tuzk-e-Jahangiri&quot;) compares Jahangir to the Roman emperor Claudius, for both were &quot;weak men... in their wrong places as rulers... [and had] Jahangir been head of a Natural History Museum... [he] would have been [a] better and happier man.&quot; Further he notes, &quot;He made no addition to the imperial territories, but on the contrary, diminished them by losing Qandahar to the Persians. But possibly his peaceful temper, or his laziness, was an advantage, for it saved much bloodshed. His greatest fault as a king was his subservience to his wife, Nur-Jahan, and the consequent quarrel with his son, Shah Jahan, who was the ablest and best of his male children&quot;. Sir William Hawkins, who visited Jahangir&#x27;s court in 1609, said: &quot;In such short that what this man&#x27;s father, called Ecber Padasha [Badshah Akbar], got of the Deccans, this king, Selim Sha [Jahangir] beginneth to lose.&quot; Italian writer and traveller, Niccolao Manucci, who worked under Jahangir&#x27;s grandson, Dara Shikoh, began his discussion of Jahangir by saying: &quot;It is a truth tested by experience that sons dissipate what their fathers gained in the sweat of their brow.&quot;

According to John F. Richards, Jahangir&#x27;s frequent withdrawal to a private sphere of life was partly reflective of his indolence, brought on by his addiction to a considerable daily dosage of wine and opium.

<doc id="16295" wikidata="Q319331" url="?curid=16295" title="Josiah Wedgwood">
<text>Josiah Wedgwood (12 July 1730 – 3 January 1795) was an English potter, entrepreneur and abolitionist. Founding the Wedgwood company in 1759, he developed improved pottery bodies by systematic experimentation, and was the leader in the industrialisation of the manufacture of European pottery.

The renewed classical enthusiasms of the late 1760s and early 1770s were of major importance to his sales promotion. His expensive goods were in much demand from the upper classes, while he used emulation effects to market cheaper sets to the rest of society. Every new invention that Wedgwood produced – green glaze, creamware, black basalt, and jasperware – was quickly copied. Having once achieved efficiency in production, he obtained efficiencies in sales and distribution. His showrooms in London gave the public the chance to see his complete range of tableware.

Wedgwood&#x27;s company never made porcelain during his lifetime, but specialised in fine earthenwares and stonewares that had many of the same qualities, but were considerably cheaper. He made great efforts to keep the designs of his wares in tune with current fashion. He was an early adopter of transfer printing which gave similar effects to hand-painting for a far lower cost. Meeting the demands of the consumer revolution that helped drive the Industrial Revolution in Britain, Wedgwood is credited as a pioneer of modern marketing. He pioneered direct mail, money-back guarantees, self-service, free delivery, buy one get one free, and illustrated catalogues.

A prominent abolitionist fighting slavery, Wedgwood is remembered too for his &quot;Am I Not a Man And a Brother?&quot; anti-slavery medallion, which had been commissioned by Joseph Hooper, a founder of the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade. The medallion used the design from that society.

Wedgwood was a member of the Darwin–Wedgwood family, and he was the grandfather of Charles and Emma Darwin.

== Early life ==
There were several related Wedgwood families in the village of Burslem, which around 1650 was the main centre of Staffordshire Potteries. Each pot-works had one bottle kiln. Thomas Wedgwood set up the Churchyard Works, near St John&#x27;s parish church. In 1679 the business went to his son of the same name, master potter and churchwarden who bought a family pew, whose son Thomas, born in 1685, married Mary Stringer around 1710. She was the daughter of Josiah Stringer, a dissenting minister whose church had been outlawed by the Corporation Act, but preached occasionally. The young Thomas and Mary moved to a small pot-works producing moulded ware, then after his father died in 1716 they moved back to the Churchyard Works. Their first son, Thomas, was born in 1716, Catherine was born in 1726, and Josiah was their thirteenth and last child.

The children were baptised in the parish church; Josiah was baptised on 12 July 1730, probably his date of birth. Though her husband continued to occupy the pew, Mary brought them up with the values taught by her father, who held that &quot;knowledge based on reason, experience, and experiment was preferable to dogma.&quot; Josiah went with the others to dame school then, around 1737 when able to walk to and from Newcastle-under-Lyme about distant, he went with them to the school there of Mr and Mrs Blunt, who were reputably Puritans.

After his father died in June 1739, Josiah finished school then, at about the usual age, began an informal apprenticeship and learnt to &quot;throw&quot; pots on the potter&#x27;s wheel. When nearly twelve, he suffered a severe bout of smallpox which affected his right knee, but recovered sufficiently to get a formal indenture on 11 November 1744, serving as an apprentice potter under his eldest brother Thomas, who had taken over the Churchyard Works. Josiah resumed potter&#x27;s wheel work for a year or two until his knee pains returned, causing him to turn to moulded ware and small ornaments. His brother thought his ideas of improvements unnecessary, and turned down his proposed partnership, so in 1751 or 1752 Josiah worked as a partner and manager in a pot-works near Stoke.

Several potters locally used practical chemistry to innovate, and Wedgwood very soon went into partnership with Thomas Whieldon, who made high value small items such as snuff boxes. After six months of research and preparation, Wedgwood developed an exceptionally brilliant green glaze, and there was immediate demand for products with this glaze. Like his partner, Wedgwood occasionally took samples to Birmingham wholesalers to get orders, making business contacts. Unfortunately a knee injury spread to general inflammation, forcing him to convalesce in his room for several months. He took this as an opportunity to extend his education, reading literature and science books. His studies were helped by repeated visits from Wiliam Willet, minister of Newcastle-under-Lyme Meeting House, who had married Wedgwood&#x27;s sister Catherine in 1754; &quot;a man of extensive learning and general acquirements&quot;. Josiah attended this English Presbyterian chapel, later known as Unitarian, and was a friend of Willet.

Around 1759, Wedgwood expanded his Burslem business, renting Ivy House Works and cottage from his distant cousins John and Thomas. They were often visited by their brother Richard Wedgwood, a wealthy Congleton cheesemonger, along with his daughter Sarah. She had been well educated, as was Unitarian practice, soon &quot;Jos&quot; wrote to his &quot;loving Sally&quot;.

On a business trip in 1762, Wedgwood had another knee accident. After attention from a surgeon, he was accommodated by Thomas Bentley, who would become his close business associate. While recuperating, he met the chemist Joseph Priestley, who became a close friend, and discussed his dissenting theological ideas. In May Wedgwood began a long correspondence with Bentley, writing from Burslem, and moved into larger premises, the Brick House Works and dwelling.

=== Marriage and children ===
Wedgwood had wooed his distant cousin Sarah (1734–1815) since first meeting her, but her father Richard wanted to ensure his prospective son-in-law had sufficient means, and insisted on long negotiation by attorneys over the marriage settlement. Then, &quot;Jos&quot; and &quot;Sally&quot; were married on 25 January 1764 at Astbury parish church, near Congleton. They had eight children:

* Susannah Wedgwood (3 January 1765 – 1817), known to the family as &quot;Sukey&quot;, married Robert Darwin and became the mother of the English naturalist Charles Darwin. Charles married Emma Wedgwood, his cousin.
* John Wedgwood (1766–1844), joined the business rather reluctantly, being mainly interested in horticulture
* Richard Wedgwood (1767–1768) (died as a child)
During negotiations for the proposed Trent and Mersey Canal, Wedgwood met and befriended Erasmus Darwin (Robert&#x27;s father), whose family long remembered as saying that Unitarianism was &quot;a feather-bed to catch a falling Christian&quot;.&lt;br&gt;After more problems with his knee, Wedgwood had his leg amputated on 28 May 1768. 
* Josiah Wedgwood II (1769–1843) (father of Emma Darwin, cousin and wife of Charles Darwin)
The Etruria Works built at the canal opened in June 1769, in July the family moved there. For several months they stayed in Little Etruria, a house built for Bentley&#x27;s use, then they moved into the just competed Etruria Hall.
* Thomas Wedgwood (1771–1805) (no children), best known as a pioneer photographer
* Catherine Wedgwood (1774–1823) (no children)
* Sarah Wedgwood (1776–1856) (no children, very active in the abolition movement and founding member of Birmingham Ladies Society for the Relief of Negro Slaves, the first anti-slavery society for women)
* Mary Anne Wedgwood (1778–86) (died as a child)
As a Unitarian, aware of legal constraints on nonconformists getting education, Wedgwood supported dissenting academies such as Warrington Academy, where he gave lectures on chemistry, and was made a professor of metallurgy. The older children first went to school in 1772; the boys to Hindley, while Sukey went to a dame school in Lancashire along with his niece, the daughter of Mrs. Willet. In 1774 he sent his son John to the Bolton boarding school trun by the Unitarian minister Philip Holland, followed by young Josiah the next year, and Tom in 1779.

== Career and work ==
=== Pottery ===

Wedgwood was keenly interested in the scientific advances of his day and it was this interest that underpinned his adoption of its approach and methods to revolutionise the quality of his pottery. His unique glazes began to distinguish his wares from anything else on the market.

By 1763, he was receiving orders from the highest-ranking people, including Queen Charlotte. Wedgwood convinced her to let him name the line of pottery she had purchased &quot;Queen&#x27;s Ware&quot;, and trumpeted the royal association in his paperwork and stationery. Anything Wedgwood made for the Queen was automatically exhibited before it was delivered. In 1764, he received his first order from abroad. Wedgwood marketed his Queen&#x27;s Ware at affordable prices, everywhere in the world British trading ships sailed. In 1767 he wrote, &quot;The demand for this sd. Creamcolour, Alias, Queen Ware, Alias, Ivory, still increases – It is amazing how rapidly the use of it has spread over the whole Globe.&quot; 

He first opened a warehouse at Charles Street, Mayfair in London as early as 1765 and it soon became an integral part of his sales organization. In two years, his trade had outgrown his rooms in Grosvenor Square. In 1767, Wedgwood and Bentley drew up an agreement to divide decorative wares between them, the domestic wares being sold on Wedgwood&#x27;s behalf. A special display room was built to beguile the fashionable company. Wedgwood&#x27;s in fact had become one of the most fashionable meeting places in London. His workers had to work day and night to satisfy the demand, and the crowds of visitors showed no sign of abating. The proliferating decoration, the exuberant colours, and the universal gilding of rococo were banished, the splendours of baroque became distasteful; the intricacies of &quot;chinoiserie&quot; lost their favour. The demand was for purity, simplicity and antiquity. To encourage this outward spread of fashion and to speed it on its way Wedgwood set up warehouses and showrooms at Bath, Liverpool and Dublin in addition to his showrooms at Etruria and in Westminster. Great care was taken in timing the openings, and new goods were held back to increase their effect.
The most important of Wedgwood&#x27;s early achievements in vase production was the perfection of the black stoneware body, which he called &quot;basalt&quot;. This body could imitate the colour and shapes of Etruscan or Greek vases which were being excavated in Italy. In 1769, &quot;vases was all the cry&quot; in London; he opened a new factory called Etruria, north of Stoke. Wedgwood became what he wished to be: &quot;Vase Maker General to the Universe&quot;. Around 1771, he started to experiment with Jasperware, but he did not advertise this new product for a couple of years.

Sir George Strickland, 6th Baronet, was asked for advice on getting models from Rome. Gilding was to prove unpopular, and around 1772, Wedgwood reduced the amount of &quot;offensive gilding&quot; in response to suggestions from Sir William Hamilton. When English society found the uncompromisingly naked figure of the classics &quot;too warm&quot; for their taste, and the ardor of the Greek gods too readily apparent, Wedgwood was quick to cloak their pagan immodesty – gowns for the girls and fig leaves for the gods were usually sufficient. Just as he felt that his flowerpots would sell more if they were called &quot;Duchess of Devonshire flowerpots&quot;, his creamware more if called Queensware, so he longed for Brown, James Wyatt, and the brothers Adam to lead the architect in the use of his chimneypieces and for George Stubbs to lead the way in the use of Wedgwood plaques.

Wedgwood hoped to monopolise the aristocratic market and thus win for his wares a special social &quot;cachet&quot; that would filter to all classes of society. Wedgwood fully realised the value of such a lead and made the most of it by giving his pottery the name of its patron: Queensware, Royal Pattern, Russian pattern, Bedford, Oxford and Chetwynd vases for instance. Whether they owned the original or merely possessed a Wedgwood copy mattered little to Wedgwood&#x27;s customers. In 1773 they published the first &quot;Ornamental Catalogue&quot;, an illustrated catalogue of shapes. A plaque, in Wedgwood&#x27;s blue pottery style, marking the site of his London showrooms between 1774 and 1795 in Wedgwood Mews, is located at 12, Greek Street, London, W1.

In 1773, Empress Catherine the Great ordered the (Green) Frog Service from Wedgwood, consisting of 952 pieces and over a thousand original paintings, for the Kekerekeksinen Palace (&quot;palace on a frog swamp&quot; ), later known as Chesme Palace. Most of the painting was carried out in Wedgwood&#x27;s decorating studio at Chelsea. Its display, Wedgwood thought, &#x27;would bring an number of People of Fashion into our Rooms. For over a month the fashionable world thronged the rooms and blocked the streets with their carriages. (Catharine paid £2,700. It can still be seen in the Hermitage Museum.) Strictly uneconomical in themselves, these productions offered huge advertising value. 

== Later years ==

As a leading industrialist, Wedgwood was a major backer of the Trent and Mersey Canal dug between the River Trent and River Mersey, during which time he became friends with Erasmus Darwin. Later that decade, his burgeoning business caused him to move from the smaller Ivy Works to the newly built Etruria Works, which would run for 180 years. The factory was named after the Etruria district of Italy, where black porcelain dating to Etruscan times was being excavated. Wedgwood found this porcelain inspiring, and his first major commercial success was its duplication with what he called &quot;Black Basalt&quot;. He combined experiments in his art and in the technique of mass production with an interest in improved roads, canals, schools, and living conditions. At Etruria, he even built a village for his workers. The motto, &quot;Sic fortis Etruria crevit&quot; (&quot;Thus Etruria grew strong&quot;), was inscribed over the main entrance to the works.

Not long after the new works opened, continuing trouble with his smallpox-afflicted knee made necessary the amputation of his right leg. In 1780, his long-time business partner Thomas Bentley died, and Wedgwood turned to Darwin for help in running the business. As a result of the close association that grew up between the Wedgwood and Darwin families, Josiah&#x27;s eldest daughter would later marry Erasmus&#x27; son.

To clinch his position as leader of the new fashion, he sought out the famous Barberini vase as the final test of his technical skill. Wedgwood&#x27;s obsession was to duplicate the Portland Vase, a blue-and-white glass vase dating to the first century BC. He worked on the project for three years, eventually producing what he considered a satisfactory copy in 1789.

In 1784, Wedgwood was exporting nearly 80% of his total produce. By 1790, he had sold his wares in every city in Europe. To give his customers a greater feeling of the rarity of his goods, he strictly limited the number of jaspers on display in his rooms at any given time, a sales technique detailed by Cambridge professor Neil McKendrick in &quot;Josiah Wedgwood: An Eighteenth-Century Entrepreneur in Salesmanship and Marketing Techniques&quot;.
He was elected to the Royal Society in 1783 for the development of the pyrometric device (a type of pyrometer) working on the principle of clay contraction (see Wedgwood scale for details) to measure the high temperatures which are reached in kilns during the firing of ceramics.

He was an active member of the Lunar Society of Birmingham, often held at Erasmus Darwin House, and is remembered on the Moonstones in Birmingham.

=== Death ===
Leaving his company and his fortune to his children, Wedgwood died at home, probably of cancer of the jaw, in 1795. He was buried three days later in the parish church of Stoke-upon-Trent. Seven years later a marble memorial tablet commissioned by his sons was installed there.

==Legacy and influence==
One of the wealthiest entrepreneurs of the 18th century, Wedgwood created goods to meet the demands of the consumer revolution and growth in prosperity that helped drive the Industrial Revolution in Britain. He is credited as a pioneer of modern marketing, specifically direct mail, money-back guarantees, travelling salesmen, carrying pattern boxes for display, self-service, free delivery, buy one get one free, and illustrated catalogues. He is the subject of Brian Dolan&#x27;s 2004 book, &quot;Wedgwood: The First Tycoon&quot;, in which Dolan explains how he revolutionised the business model with innovations that have continued into the present.
For devising a number of sales methods, historian Judith Flanders in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called him &quot;among the greatest and most innovative retailers the world has ever seen&quot;. He is also noted as an early adopter/founder of managerial accounting principles by Anthony Hopwood, professor of accounting and financial management at the London School of Economics, in &quot;The Archaeology of Accounting Systems&quot;. The V&amp;A historian Tristram Hunt called Wedgwood a &quot;difficult, brilliant, creative entrepreneur whose personal drive and extraordinary gifts changed the way we work and live.&quot; The Adam Smith Institute states, &quot;Steve Jobs and Elon Musk are the spiritual heirs of Josiah Wedgwood, developing and promoting the new products and processes that will enrich our world with new opportunities&quot;.

He was a friend, and commercial rival, of the potter John Turner the elder; their works have sometimes been misattributed. For the further comfort of his foreign buyers he employed French-, German-, Italian- and Dutch-speaking clerks and answered their letters in their native tongue.

Wedgwood belonged to the fifth generation of a family of potters whose traditional occupation continued through another five generations. Wedgwood&#x27;s company is still a famous name in pottery (as part of the Fiskars group), and &quot;Wedgwood China&quot; is sometimes used as a term for his Jasperware, the coloured pottery with applied relief decoration (usually white). As early as 1774, Wedgwood began preserving samples of all the company&#x27;s works for posterity, with the collection later put into the Wedgwood Museum. In 2009, the museum won a UK Art Fund Prize for Museums and Art Galleries (Museum of the Year) for its displays of Wedgwood pottery, skills, designs and artefacts. In 2011, the archive of the museum was inscribed in UNESCO&#x27;s UK Memory of the World Register.

==Abolitionism==
Wedgwood was a prominent slavery abolitionist. His friendship with Thomas Clarkson – abolitionist campaigner and the first historian of the British abolition movement – aroused his interest in slavery 

[The above seems to be a closed argument and unlikely to be true. Joseph Hooper and Erasmus Darwin knew each other well, via the Medical Society of London, before Clarkson and Wedgwood became involved in the abolition movement. John Fothergill was their mentor as young Doctors. Darwin must have introduced Wedgwood to Hooper, and through Hooper, Wedgwood and Clarkson would have become known to one another]. 

Wedgwood mass-produced cameos depicting the seal for the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade and had them widely distributed, which thereby became a popular and celebrated image. The Wedgwood anti-slavery medallion was, according to the BBC, &quot;the most famous image of a black person in all of 18th-century art&quot;. The actual design of the cameo was probably done by either William Hackwood or Henry Webber who were modellers at his factory.

From 1787 until his death in 1795, Wedgwood actively participated in the abolition-of-slavery cause. His anti-slavery medallion, which had been commissioned by Joseph Hooper, a founder of the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade, brought public attention to abolitionism. Wedgwood reproduced the design in a cameo with the black figure against a white background and donated hundreds to the society for distribution. Thomas Clarkson wrote: &quot;ladies wore them in bracelets, and others had them fitted up in an ornamental manner as pins for their hair. At length the taste for wearing them became general, and thus fashion, which usually confines itself to worthless things, was seen for once in the honourable office of promoting the cause of justice, humanity and freedom&quot;.

The design on the medallion became popular and was used elsewhere: large-scale copies were painted to hang on walls and it was used on clay tobacco pipes.

* Commemorating the landing of the First Fleet at Sydney Cove in January 1788, Wedgwood made the Sydney Cove Medallion, using a sample of clay from the cove from Sir Joseph Banks, who had himself received it from Governor Arthur Phillip. Wedgwood made the commemorative medallion showing an allegorical group described as, &quot;Hope encouraging Art and Labour, under the influence of Peace, to pursue the employments necessary to give security and happiness to an infant settlement&quot;.

<doc id="16296" wikidata="Q7644929" url="?curid=16296" title="Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873">
<text>The Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (36 &amp; 37 Vict. c. 66) (sometimes known as the Judicature Act 1873) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1873. It reorganised the English court system to establish the High Court and the Court of Appeal, and also originally provided for the abolition of the judicial functions of the House of Lords with respect to England. It would have retained those functions in relation to Scotland and Ireland for the time being. However, the Gladstone Liberal government fell in 1874 before the act entered into force, and the succeeding Disraeli Conservative government suspended the entry into force of the act by means of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Commencement) Act 1874 (37 &amp; 38 Vict. c. 83) and the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1875 (38 &amp; 39 Vict. c. 77).

==History==
The legislation for the Judicature Act 1873 was drafted by the Judicature Commission which was chaired by Lord Chancellor Hatherley. Other members of the commission included judge George Bramwell, lawyers Sir John Hollams, Sir Robert Collier, and John Burgess Karslake, and parliament member George Ward Hunt.

==Liberal view==
One of the reasons that the Liberal government under Gladstone wanted to abolish the judicial aspect of the House of Lords was that it was concerned for the poor quality of judges at this court. Judges at the House of Lords secured their position by mere virtue of the fact that their fathers were hereditary peers and so individuals would automatically inherit seats in the upper house rather than securing their position through merit. Therefore, some of the best lawyers in the land were prohibited from sitting as judges in the upper house simply because of their parentage.

==Conservative view==
However, under the Conservative government, the 1874 and 1875 acts retained the judicial aspect of the House of Lords and ensured the quality of judicial appointments to the House of Lords by legislating under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876, for the mechanism of law lords. The reigning monarch could appoint any individual to be a peer and thus a judge in the House of Lords. These judicial life peers would hold seats only for the duration of their life; their seat would not pass through their inheritance to their son. Thus, Queen Victoria and subsequent monarchs were able to appoint leading lawyers to adjudicate in the House of Lords by making them life peers.

==Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876==
Lord Cairns, Disraeli&#x27;s Lord Chancellor, sought to remove the House of Lords jurisdiction for Scottish and Irish appeals as well, which would have completely removed its judicial jurisdiction. However, the Lord Chancellor could not muster the necessary support in Parliament for the bill as originally proposed in 1874 or when it was reintroduced in 1875. Finally, when it became clear that the English legal profession was firmly opposed to the reform proposals, the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 removed the provisions for the abolition of the judicial functions of the House of Lords, although it retained the provisions that established the High Court and the Court of Appeal.

<doc id="16300" wikidata="Q33941" url="?curid=16300" title="Julian (emperor)">
<text>Julian (; ; 331 – 26 June 363) was the Caesar of the West from 355 to 360 and Roman emperor from 361 to 363, as well as a notable philosopher and author in Greek. His rejection of Christianity, and his promotion of Neoplatonic Hellenism in its place, caused him to be remembered as Julian the Apostate in Christian tradition. He is sometimes referred to as Julian the Philosopher.

A nephew of Constantine the Great, Julian was one of few in the imperial family to survive the purges and civil wars during the reign of Constantius II, his cousin. Julian became an orphan as a child after his father was executed in 337, and spent much of his life under Constantius&#x27;s close supervision. However, the emperor allowed Julian to pursue freely an education in the Greek-speaking east, with the result that Julian became unusually cultured for an emperor of his time. In 355, Constantius II summoned Julian to court and appointed him to rule Gaul. Despite his inexperience, Julian showed unexpected success in his new capacity, defeating and counterattacking Germanic raids across the Rhine and encouraging the ravaged provinces&#x27; return to prosperity. In 360, he was proclaimed emperor by his soldiers at Lutetia (Paris), sparking a civil war with Constantius. However, Constantius died before the two could face each other in battle, having allegedly named Julian as his successor.

In 363, Julian embarked on an ambitious campaign against the Sasanian Empire. The campaign was initially successful, securing a victory outside Ctesiphon in Mesopotamia. However, he did not attempt to besiege the capital. Julian instead moved into Persia&#x27;s heartland, but he soon faced supply problems and was forced to retreat northwards while being ceaselessly harassed by Persian skirmishers. During the Battle of Samarra, Julian was mortally wounded. He was succeeded by Jovian, a senior officer in the imperial guard, who was obliged to cede territory, including Nisibis, in order to save the trapped Roman forces. Julian and Jovian were the last sole emperors to rule the whole Empire for their entire reign, after which it was permanently divided between a Western and Eastern court.

Julian was the last non-Christian ruler of the Roman Empire, and he believed that it was necessary to restore the Empire&#x27;s ancient Roman values and traditions in order to save it from dissolution. He purged the top-heavy state bureaucracy, and attempted to revive traditional Roman religious practices at the expense of Christianity. His efforts to build a Third Temple in Jerusalem were probably intended to harm Christianity rather than please Jews. Julian also forbade Christians from teaching and learning classical texts.

== Early life ==
Julian, whose full name was Flavius Claudius Julianus, was born at Constantinople, probably in 331, into the family of the reigning emperor, Constantine I, and was the first attested individual to be born in that city after its refounding. His father was Julius Constantius, Constantine&#x27;s younger half-brother, and his mother was a Bithynian noble named Basilina, daughter of a high-ranking bureaucrat, Julianus, who had served as praetorian prefect and head of government under the late emperor Licinius. Julian&#x27;s mother died shortly after he was born, and he spent his childhood in Constantinople, forming a lasting attachment to the city. Julian was probably raised with Greek as his first language, and, being the nephew of Rome&#x27;s first Christian emperor, he was brought up under the Christian faith.

In the turmoil after the death of Constantine in 337, in order to establish himself and his brothers, Julian&#x27;s cousin Constantius II appears to have led a massacre of most of Julian&#x27;s close relatives. Constantius II allegedly ordered the murders of many descendants from the second marriage of Constantius Chlorus and Theodora, leaving only Constantius and his brothers Constantine II and Constans I, and their cousins, Julian and Constantius Gallus (Julian&#x27;s half-brother), as the surviving males related to Emperor Constantine. Constantius II, Constans I, and Constantine II were proclaimed joint emperors, each ruling a portion of Roman territory. Julian and Gallus were excluded from public life, were strictly guarded in their youth, and given a Christian education. They were likely saved by their youth. If Julian&#x27;s later writings are to be believed, Constantius would later be tormented with guilt at the massacre of 337.

Initially growing up in Bithynia, raised by his maternal grandmother, at the age of seven Julian was under the guardianship of Eusebius, the semi-Arian Christian Bishop of Nicomedia, and taught by Mardonius, a Gothic eunuch, about whom he later wrote warmly. After Eusebius died in 342, both Julian and Gallus were transferred to the imperial estate of Macellum in Cappadocia. Here Julian met the Christian bishop George of Cappadocia, who lent him books from the classical tradition. At the age of 18, the exile was lifted and he dwelt briefly in Constantinople and Nicomedia. He became a lector, a minor office in the Christian church, and his later writings show a detailed knowledge of the Bible, likely acquired in his early life.

Julian&#x27;s conversion from Christianity to paganism happened at around the age of 20. Looking back on his life in 362, Julian wrote that he had spent twenty years in the way of Christianity and twelve in the true way, i.e., the way of Helios. Julian began his study of Neoplatonism in Asia Minor in 351, at first under Aedesius, the philosopher, and then Aedesius&#x27; student Eusebius of Myndus. It was from Eusebius that Julian learned of the teachings of Maximus of Ephesus, whom Eusebius criticized for his more mystical form of Neoplatonic theurgy. Eusebius related his meeting with Maximus, in which the theurgist invited him into the temple of Hecate and, chanting a hymn, caused a statue of the goddess to smile and laugh, and her torches to ignite. Eusebius reportedly told Julian that he &quot;must not marvel at any of these things, even as I marvel not, but rather believe that the thing of the highest importance is that purification of the soul which is attained by reason.&quot; In spite of Eusebius&#x27; warnings regarding the &quot;impostures of witchcraft and magic that cheat the senses&quot; and &quot;the works of conjurers who are insane men led astray into the exercise of earthly and material powers&quot;, Julian was intrigued, and sought out Maximus as his new mentor. According to the historian Eunapius, when Julian left Eusebius, he told his former teacher &quot;farewell, and devote yourself to your books. You have shown me the man I was in search of.&quot;

Constantine II died in 340 when he attacked his brother Constans. Constans in turn fell in 350 in the war against the usurper Magnentius. This left Constantius II as the sole remaining emperor. In need of support, in 351 he made Julian&#x27;s half-brother, Gallus, caesar of the East, while Constantius II himself turned his attention westward to Magnentius, whom he defeated decisively that year. In 354 Gallus, who had imposed a rule of terror over the territories under his command, was executed. Julian was summoned to Constantius&#x27; court in Mediolanum (Milan) in 354, and held for a year, under suspicion of treasonable intrigue, first with his brother and then with Claudius Silvanus; he was cleared, in part because Empress Eusebia intervened on his behalf, and he was permitted to study in Athens (Julian expresses his gratitude to the empress in his third oration). While there, Julian became acquainted with two men who later became both bishops and saints: Gregory of Nazianzus and Basil the Great. In the same period, Julian was also initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries, which he would later try to restore.

==Caesar in Gaul==
After dealing with the rebellions of Magnentius and Silvanus, Constantius felt he needed a permanent representative in Gaul. In 355, Julian was summoned to appear before the emperor in Mediolanum and on 6 November was made &quot;Caesar&quot; of the West, marrying Constantius&#x27; sister, Helena. Constantius, after his experience with Gallus, intended his representative to be more a figurehead than an active participant in events, so he packed Julian off to Gaul with a small retinue, assuming his prefects in Gaul would keep Julian in check. At first reluctant to trade his scholarly life for war and politics, Julian eventually took every opportunity to involve himself in the affairs of Gaul. In the following years he learned how to lead and then run an army, through a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes that had settled on both sides of the Rhine.

===Campaigns against Germanic kingdoms===
During his first campaign in 356, Julian led an army to the Rhine, where he engaged the inhabitants and recovered several towns that had fallen into Frankish hands, including Colonia Agrippina (Cologne). With success under his belt he withdrew for the winter to Gaul, distributing his forces to protect various towns, and choosing the small town of Senon near Verdun to await the spring. This turned out to be a tactical error, for he was left with insufficient forces to defend himself when a large contingent of Franks besieged the town and Julian was virtually held captive there for several months, until his general Marcellus deigned to lift the siege. Relations between Julian and Marcellus seem to have been poor. Constantius accepted Julian&#x27;s report of events and Marcellus was replaced as &quot;magister equitum&quot; by Severus.

The following year saw a combined operation planned by Constantius to regain control of the Rhine from the Germanic peoples who had spilt across the river onto the west bank. From the south his &quot;magister peditum&quot; Barbatio was to come from Milan and amass forces at Augst (near the Rhine bend), then set off north with 25,000 soldiers; Julian with 13,000 troops would move east from Durocortorum (Rheims). However, while Julian was in transit, a group of Laeti attacked Lugdunum (Lyon) and Julian was delayed in order to deal with them. This left Barbatio unsupported and deep in Alamanni territory, so he felt obliged to withdraw, retracing his steps. Thus ended the coordinated operation against the Germanic peoples.

With Barbatio safely out of the picture, King Chnodomarius led a confederation of Alamanni forces against Julian and Severus at the Battle of Argentoratum. The Romans were heavily outnumbered and during the heat of battle a group of 600 horsemen on the right wing deserted, yet, taking full advantage of the limitations of the terrain, the Romans were overwhelmingly victorious. The enemy was routed and driven into the river. King Chnodomarius was captured and later sent to Constantius in Mediolanum. Ammianus, who was a participant in the battle, portrays Julian in charge of events on the battlefield and describes how the soldiers, because of this success, acclaimed Julian attempting to make him Augustus, an acclamation he rejected, rebuking them. He later rewarded them for their valor.

Rather than chase the routed enemy across the Rhine, Julian now proceeded to follow the Rhine north, the route he followed the previous year on his way back to Gaul. At Moguntiacum (Mainz), however, he crossed the Rhine in an expedition that penetrated deep into what is today Germany, and forced three local kingdoms to submit. This action showed the Alamanni that Rome was once again present and active in the area. On his way back to winter quarters in Paris he dealt with a band of Franks who had taken control of some abandoned forts along the river Meuse.

In 358, Julian gained victories over the Salian Franks on the Lower Rhine, settling them in Toxandria in the Roman Empire, north of today&#x27;s city of Tongeren, and over the Chamavi, who were expelled back to Hamaland.

===Taxation and administration===
At the end of 357 Julian, with the prestige of his victory over the Alamanni to give him confidence, prevented a tax increase by the Gallic praetorian prefect Florentius and personally took charge of the province of &quot;Belgica Secunda&quot;. This was Julian&#x27;s first experience with civil administration, where his views were influenced by his liberal education in Greece. Properly it was a role that belonged to the praetorian prefect. However, Florentius and Julian often clashed over the administration of Gaul. Julian&#x27;s first priority, as &quot;Caesar&quot; and nominal ranking commander in Gaul, was to drive out the barbarians who had breached the Rhine frontier. He sought to win over the support of the civil population, which was necessary for his operations in Gaul, and also to show his largely Germanic army the benefits of Imperial rule. Julian therefore felt it was necessary to rebuild stable and peaceful conditions in the devastated cities and countryside. For this reason, Julian clashed with Florentius over the latter&#x27;s support of tax increases, as mentioned above, and Florentius&#x27;s own corruption in the bureaucracy.

Constantius attempted to maintain some modicum of control over his &quot;Caesar&quot;, which explains his removal of Julian&#x27;s close adviser Saturninius Secundus Salutius from Gaul. His departure stimulated the writing of Julian&#x27;s oration, &quot;Consolation Upon the Departure of Salutius&quot;.

===Rebellion in Paris===

In the fourth year of Julian&#x27;s stay in Gaul, the Sassanid emperor, Shapur II, invaded Mesopotamia and took the city of Amida after a 73-day siege. In February 360, Constantius II ordered more than half of Julian&#x27;s Gallic troops to join his eastern army, the order by-passing Julian and going directly to the military commanders. Although Julian at first attempted to expedite the order, it provoked an insurrection by troops of the &quot;Petulantes&quot;, who had no desire to leave Gaul. According to the historian Zosimus, the army officers were those responsible for distributing an anonymous tract expressing complaints against Constantius as well as fearing for Julian&#x27;s ultimate fate. Notably absent at the time was the prefect Florentius, who was seldom far from Julian&#x27;s side, though now he was kept busy organizing supplies in Vienne and away from any strife that the order could cause. Julian would later blame him for the arrival of the order from Constantius. Ammianus Marcellinus even suggested that the fear of Julian gaining more popularity than himself caused Constantius to send the order on the urging of Florentius.

The troops proclaimed Julian &quot;Augustus&quot; in Paris, and this in turn led to a very swift military effort to secure or win the allegiance of others. Although the full details are unclear, there is evidence to suggest that Julian may have at least partially stimulated the insurrection. If so, he went back to business as usual in Gaul, for, from June to August of that year, Julian led a successful campaign against the Attuarian Franks. In November, Julian began openly using the title &quot;Augustus,&quot; even issuing coins with the title, sometimes with Constantius, sometimes without. He celebrated his fifth year in Gaul with a big show of games.
In the spring of 361, Julian led his army into the territory of the Alamanni, where he captured their king, Vadomarius. Julian claimed that Vadomarius had been in league with Constantius, encouraging him to raid the borders of Raetia. Julian then divided his forces, sending one column to Raetia, one to northern Italy and the third he led down the Danube on boats. His forces claimed control of Illyricum and his general, Nevitta, secured the pass of Succi into Thrace. He was now well out of his comfort zone and on the road to civil war. (Julian would state in late November that he set off down this road &quot;because, having been declared a public enemy, I meant to frighten him [Constantius] merely, and that our quarrel should result in intercourse on more friendly terms...&quot;)

However, in June, forces loyal to Constantius captured the city of Aquileia on the north Adriatic coast, an event that threatened to cut Julian off from the rest of his forces, while Constantius&#x27;s troops marched towards him from the east. Aquileia was subsequently besieged by 23,000 men loyal to Julian. All Julian could do was sit it out in Naissus, the city of Constantine&#x27;s birth, waiting for news and writing letters to various cities in Greece justifying his actions (of which only the letter to the Athenians has survived in its entirety). Civil war was avoided only by the death on 3 November of Constantius, who, in his last will, is alleged by some sources to have recognized Julian as his rightful successor.

==Reign==

On 11 December 361, Julian entered Constantinople as sole emperor and, despite his rejection of Christianity, his first political act was to preside over Constantius&#x27; Christian burial, escorting the body to the Church of the Apostles, where it was placed alongside that of Constantine. This act was a demonstration of his lawful right to the throne. He is also now thought to have been responsible for the building of Santa Costanza on a Christian site just outside Rome as a mausoleum for his wife Helena and sister-in-law Constantina.

The new Emperor rejected the style of administration of his immediate predecessors. He blamed Constantine for the state of the administration and for having abandoned the traditions of the past. He made no attempt to restore the tetrarchal system begun under Diocletian, nor did he seek to rule as an absolute autocrat. His own philosophic notions led him to idealize the reigns of Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius. In his first panegyric to Constantius, Julian described the ideal ruler as being essentially &quot;primus inter pares&quot; (&quot;first among equals&quot;), operating under the same laws as his subjects. While in Constantinople, therefore, it was not strange to see Julian frequently active in the Senate, participating in debates and making speeches, placing himself at the level of the other members of the Senate.

He viewed the royal court of his predecessors as inefficient, corrupt and expensive. Thousands of servants, eunuchs and superfluous officials were therefore summarily dismissed. He set up the Chalcedon tribunal to deal with the corruption of the previous administration under the supervision of &quot;magister militum&quot; Arbitio. Several high-ranking officials under Constantius, including the chamberlain Eusebius, were found guilty and executed. (Julian was conspicuously absent from the proceedings, perhaps signalling his displeasure at their necessity.) He continually sought to reduce what he saw as a burdensome and corrupt bureaucracy within the Imperial administration whether it involved civic officials, secret agents or the imperial postal service.

Another effect of Julian&#x27;s political philosophy was that the authority of the cities was expanded at the expense of the imperial bureaucracy as Julian sought to reduce direct imperial involvement in urban affairs. For example, city land owned by the imperial government was returned to the cities, city council members were compelled to resume civic authority, often against their will, and the tribute in gold by the cities called the &quot;aurum coronarium&quot; was made voluntary rather than a compulsory tax. Additionally, arrears of land taxes were cancelled. This was a key reform reducing the power of corrupt imperial officials, as the unpaid taxes on land were often hard to calculate or higher than the value of the land itself. Forgiving back taxes both made Julian more popular and allowed him to increase collections of current taxes.

While he ceded much of the authority of the imperial government to the cities, Julian also took more direct control himself. For example, new taxes and corvées had to be approved by him directly rather than left to the judgement of the bureaucratic apparatus. Julian certainly had a clear idea of what he wanted Roman society to be, both in political as well as religious terms. The terrible and violent dislocation of the 3rd century meant that the Eastern Mediterranean had become the economic locus of the Empire. If the cities were treated as relatively autonomous local administrative areas, it would simplify the problems of imperial administration, which as far as Julian was concerned, should be focused on the administration of the law and defense of the empire&#x27;s vast frontiers.

In replacing Constantius&#x27;s political and civil appointees, Julian drew heavily from the intellectual and professional classes, or kept reliable holdovers, such as the rhetorician Themistius. His choice of consuls for the year 362 was more controversial. One was the very acceptable Claudius Mamertinus, previously the Praetorian prefect of Illyricum. The other, more surprising choice was Nevitta, Julian&#x27;s trusted Frankish general. This latter appointment made overt the fact that an emperor&#x27;s authority depended on the power of the army. Julian&#x27;s choice of Nevitta appears to have been aimed at maintaining the support of the Western army which had acclaimed him.

===Clash with the Antiochenes===
After five months of dealings at the capital, Julian left Constantinople in May and moved to Antioch, arriving in mid-July and staying there for nine months before launching his fateful campaign against Persia in March 363. Antioch was a city favored by splendid temples along with a famous oracle of Apollo in nearby Daphne, which may have been one reason for his choosing to reside there. It had also been used in the past as a staging place for amassing troops, a purpose which Julian intended to follow.

His arrival on 18 July was well received by the Antiochenes, though it coincided with the celebration of the Adonia, a festival which marked the death of Adonis, so there was wailing and moaning in the streets—not a good omen for an arrival.

Julian soon discovered that wealthy merchants were causing food problems, apparently by hoarding food and selling it at high prices. He hoped that the curia would deal with the issue for the situation was headed for a famine. When the curia did nothing, he spoke to the city&#x27;s leading citizens, trying to persuade them to take action. Thinking that they would do the job, he turned his attention to religious matters.

He tried to resurrect the ancient oracular spring of Castalia at the temple of Apollo at Delphi. After being advised that the bones of 3rd-century bishop Babylas were suppressing the god, he made a public-relations mistake in ordering the removal of the bones from the vicinity of the temple. The result was a massive Christian procession. Shortly after that, when the temple was destroyed by fire, Julian suspected the Christians and ordered stricter investigations than usual. He also shut up the chief Christian church of the city, before the investigations proved that the fire was the result of an accident.

When the curia still took no substantial action in regards to the food shortage, Julian intervened, fixing the prices for grain and importing more from Egypt. Then landholders refused to sell theirs, claiming that the harvest was so bad that they had to be compensated with fair prices. Julian accused them of price gouging and forced them to sell. Various parts of Libanius&#x27; orations may suggest that both sides were justified to some extent; while Ammianus blames Julian for &quot;a mere thirst for popularity&quot;.

Julian&#x27;s ascetic lifestyle was not popular either, since his subjects were accustomed to the idea of an all-powerful Emperor who placed himself well above them. Nor did he improve his dignity with his own participation in the ceremonial of bloody sacrifices.
David Stone Potter said after nearly two millennia:
He then tried to address public criticism and mocking of him by issuing a satire ostensibly on himself, called Misopogon or &quot;Beard Hater&quot;. There he blames the people of Antioch for preferring that their ruler have his virtues in the face rather than in the soul.

Julian&#x27;s fellow pagans were of a divided mind about this habit of talking to his subjects on an equal footing: Ammianus Marcellinus saw in that only the foolish vanity of someone &quot;excessively anxious for empty distinction&quot;, whose &quot;desire for popularity often led him to converse with unworthy persons&quot;.

On leaving Antioch he appointed Alexander of Heliopolis as governor, a violent and cruel man whom the Antiochene Libanius, a friend of the emperor, admits on first thought was a &quot;dishonourable&quot; appointment. Julian himself described the man as &quot;undeserving&quot; of the position, but appropriate &quot;for the avaricious and rebellious people of Antioch&quot;.

===Persian campaign===

Julian&#x27;s rise to &quot;Augustus&quot; was the result of military insurrection eased by Constantius&#x27;s sudden death. This meant that, while he could count on the wholehearted support of the Western army which had aided his rise, the Eastern army was an unknown quantity originally loyal to the Emperor he had risen against; and though he had tried to woo it through the Chalcedon tribunal, to solidify his position in the eyes of the eastern army, he needed to lead its soldiers to victory. A campaign against the Sassanid Persians offered such an opportunity.

An audacious plan was formulated, the goal of which was to lay siege to the Sassanid capital city of Ctesiphon and definitively secure the eastern border. Yet the full motivation for this ambitious operation is, at best, unclear; there was no direct necessity for an invasion, as the Sassanids sent envoys in the hope of settling matters peacefully. Julian rejected this offer. Ammianus states that Julian longed for revenge on the Persians and that a certain desire for combat and glory also played a role in his decision to go to war.

====Into enemy territory====
On 5 March 363, despite a series of omens against the campaign, Julian departed from Antioch with about 65,000–83,000, or 80,000–90,000 men (the traditional number accepted by Gibbon is 95,000 effectives total), and headed north toward the Euphrates. En route he was met by embassies from various small powers offering assistance, none of which he accepted, though he did order the Armenian King Arsaces to muster an army and await instructions. He crossed the Euphrates near Hierapolis and moved eastward to Carrhae, giving the impression that his chosen route into Persian territory was down the Tigris. For this reason it seems he sent a force of 30,000 soldiers under Procopius and Sebastianus further eastward to devastate Media in conjunction with Armenian forces. This was where two earlier Roman campaigns had concentrated and where the main Persian forces were soon directed. Julian&#x27;s strategy lay elsewhere, however. He had had a fleet built of over 1,000 ships at Samosata in order to supply his army for a march down the Euphrates and of 50 pontoon ships to facilitate river crossings. Procopius and the Armenians would march down the Tigris to meet Julian near Ctesiphon. Julian&#x27;s ultimate aim seems to have been &quot;regime change&quot; by replacing king Shapur II with his brother Hormisdas.

After feigning a march further eastward, Julian&#x27;s army turned south to Circesium at the confluence of the Abora (Khabur) and the Euphrates arriving at the beginning of April. Passing Dura on 6 April, the army made good progress, bypassing towns after negotiations or besieging those which chose to oppose him. At the end of April the Romans captured the fortress of Pirisabora, which guarded the canal approach from the Euphrates to Ctesiphon on the Tigris. As the army marched toward the Persian capital, the Sassanids broke the dikes which crossed the land, turning it into marshland, slowing the progress of the Roman army.

====Ctesiphon====

By mid-May, the army had reached the vicinity of the heavily fortified Persian capital, Ctesiphon, where Julian partially unloaded some of the fleet and had his troops ferried across the Tigris by night. 
The Romans gained a tactical victory over the Persians before the gates of the city, driving them back into the city. However, the Persian capital was not taken. Concerned with the risk of becoming encircled and trapped within the city&#x27;s walls, master-general Victor ordered his soldiers not to enter the open gates of the city in pursuit of the defeated Persians. Resultantly, the main Persian army was still at large and approaching, while the Romans lacked a clear strategic objective. In the council of war which followed, Julian&#x27;s generals persuaded him not to mount a siege against the city, given the impregnability of its defenses and the fact that Shapur would soon arrive with a large force. Julian, not wanting to give up what he had gained and probably still hoping for the arrival of the column under Procopius and Sebastianus, set off east into the Persian interior, ordering the destruction of the fleet. This proved to be a hasty decision, for they were on the wrong side of the Tigris with no clear means of retreat and the Persians had begun to harass them from a distance, burning any food in the Romans&#x27; path. Julian had not brought adequate siege equipment, so there was nothing he could do when he found that the Persians had flooded the area behind him, forcing him to withdraw. A second council of war on 16 June 363 decided that the best course of action was to lead the army back to the safety of Roman borders, not through Mesopotamia, but northward to Corduene.

=== Death ===
During the withdrawal, Julian&#x27;s forces suffered several attacks from Sassanid forces. In one such engagement on 26 June 363, the indecisive Battle of Samarra near Maranga in Mesopotamia, Julian was wounded when the Sassanid army raided his column. In the haste of pursuing the retreating enemy, Julian chose speed rather than caution, taking only his sword and leaving his coat of mail. He received a wound from a spear that reportedly pierced the lower lobe of his liver and intestines. The wound was not immediately deadly. Julian was treated by his personal physician, Oribasius of Pergamum, who seems to have made every attempt to treat the wound; this probably included the irrigation of the wound with a dark wine, and a procedure known as &quot;gastrorrhaphy&quot;—&quot;i.e.,&quot; suturing of the damaged intestine. Despite these efforts, on the third day a major hemorrhage occurred and the emperor died during the night. Some Christian writers reported that his final words were &quot;Thou hast conquered, Galilean.” As Julian wished, his body was buried outside Tarsus, though it was later moved to Constantinople.

In 364, Libanius stated that Julian was assassinated by a Christian who was one of his own soldiers; this charge is not corroborated by Ammianus Marcellinus or other contemporary historians. John Malalas reports that the supposed assassination was commanded by Basil of Caesarea. Fourteen years later, Libanius said that Julian was killed by a Saracen (Lakhmid) and this may have been confirmed by Julian&#x27;s doctor Oribasius who, having examined the wound, said that it was from a spear used by a group of Lakhmid auxiliaries in Persian service. Later Christian historians propagated the tradition that Julian was killed by Saint Mercurius.

==== Legacy ====

Julian was succeeded by the short-lived Emperor Jovian, who reestablished Christianity&#x27;s privileged position throughout the Empire.

Libanius says in his epitaph of the deceased emperor (18.304) that &quot;I have mentioned representations (of Julian); many cities have set him beside the images of the gods and honour him as they do the gods. Already a blessing has been besought of him in prayer, and it was not in vain. To such an extent has he literally ascended to the gods and received a share of their power from him themselves.&quot; However, no similar action was taken by the Roman central government, which would be more and more dominated by Christians in the ensuing decades.

Considered apocryphal is the report that his dying words were , or (&quot;You have won, Galilean&quot;), supposedly expressing his recognition that, with his death, Christianity would become the Empire&#x27;s state religion. The phrase introduces the 1866 poem &quot;Hymn to Proserpine&quot;, which was Algernon Charles Swinburne&#x27;s elaboration of what a philosophic pagan might have felt at the triumph of Christianity. It also ends the Polish Romantic play &quot;The Undivine Comedy&quot; written in 1833 by Zygmunt Krasiński.

====Tomb====

As he had requested, Julian&#x27;s body was buried in Tarsus. It lay in a tomb outside the city, across a road from that of Maximinus Daia.

However, chronicler Zonaras says that at some &quot;later&quot; date his body was exhumed and reburied in or near the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople, where Constantine and the rest of his family lay. His sarcophagus is listed as standing in a &quot;stoa&quot; there by Constantine VII. The church was demolished by the Ottomans after the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Today a sarcophagus of porphyry, believed by Jean Ebersolt to be Julian&#x27;s, stands in the grounds of the Istanbul Archaeology Museum.
==Religious issues==

===Beliefs===
Julian&#x27;s personal religion was both pagan and philosophical; he viewed the traditional myths as allegories, in which the ancient gods were aspects of a philosophical divinity. The chief surviving sources are his works &quot;To King Helios&quot; and &quot;To the Mother of the Gods&quot;, which were written as panegyrics, not theological treatises.

As the last pagan ruler of the Roman Empire, Julian&#x27;s beliefs are of great interest for historians, but they are not in complete agreement. He learned theurgy from Maximus of Ephesus, a student of Iamblichus; his system bears some resemblance to the Neoplatonism of Plotinus; Polymnia Athanassiadi has brought new attention to his relations with Mithraism, although whether he was initiated into it remains debatable; and certain aspects of his thought (such as his reorganization of paganism under High Priests, and his fundamental monotheism) may show Christian influence. Some of these potential sources have not come down to us, and all of them influenced each other, which adds to the difficulties.

According to one theory (that of Glen Bowersock in particular), Julian&#x27;s paganism was highly eccentric and atypical because it was heavily influenced by an esoteric approach to Platonic philosophy sometimes identified as &quot;theurgy&quot; and also &quot;Neoplatonism&quot;. Others (Rowland Smith, in particular) have argued that Julian&#x27;s philosophical perspective was nothing unusual for a &quot;cultured&quot; pagan of his time, and, at any rate, that Julian&#x27;s paganism was not limited to philosophy alone, and that he was deeply devoted to the same gods and goddesses as other pagans of his day.

Because of his Neoplatonist background, Julian accepted the creation of humanity as described in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot;. Julian writes, &quot;when Zeus was setting all things in order there fell from him drops of sacred blood, and from them, as they say, arose the race of men.&quot; Further he writes, &quot;they who had the power to create one man and one woman only, were able to create many men and women at once...&quot; His view contrasts with the Christian belief that humanity is derived from the one pair, Adam and Eve. Elsewhere he argues against the single pair origin, indicating his disbelief, noting for example, &quot;how very different in their bodies are the Germans and Scythians from the Libyans and Ethiopians.&quot;

The Christian historian Socrates Scholasticus was of the opinion that Julian believed himself to be Alexander the Great &quot;in another body&quot; via transmigration of souls, &quot;in accordance with the teachings of Pythagoras and Plato&quot;.

The diet of Julian is said to have been predominantly vegetable-based.

=== Restoration of state paganism ===
After gaining the purple, Julian started a religious reformation of the empire, which was intended to restore the lost strength of the Roman state. He supported the restoration of Hellenistic polytheism as the state religion. His laws tended to target wealthy and educated Christians, and his aim was not to destroy Christianity but to drive the religion out of &quot;the governing classes of the empire—much as Chinese Buddhism was driven back into the lower classes by a revived Confucian mandarinate in 13th century China.&quot;

He restored pagan temples which had been confiscated since Constantine&#x27;s time, or simply appropriated by wealthy citizens; he repealed the stipends that Constantine had awarded to Christian bishops, and removed their other privileges, including a right to be consulted on appointments and to act as private courts. He also reversed some favors that had previously been given to Christians. For example, he reversed Constantine&#x27;s declaration that Majuma, the port of Gaza, was a separate city. Majuma had a large Christian congregation while Gaza was still predominantly pagan.

On 4 February 362, Julian promulgated an edict to guarantee freedom of religion. This edict proclaimed that all the religions were equal before the law, and that the Roman Empire had to return to its original religious eclecticism, according to which the Roman state did not impose any religion on its provinces. The edict was seen as an act of favor toward the Jews, in order to upset the Christians.

Since the persecution of Christians by past Roman Emperors had seemingly only strengthened Christianity, many of Julian&#x27;s actions may have been designed to harass Christians and undermine their ability to organize resistance to the re-establishment of paganism in the empire. Julian&#x27;s preference for a non-Christian and non-philosophical view of Iamblichus&#x27; theurgy seems to have convinced him that it was right to outlaw the Christian liturgy and demand the suppression of the Christian Holy Mysteries (Sacraments).

In his &quot;School Edict&quot;, Julian required that all public teachers be approved by the Emperor; the state paid or supplemented much of their salaries. Ammianus Marcellinus explains this as intending to prevent Christian teachers from using pagan texts (such as the &quot;Iliad&quot;, which was widely regarded as divinely inspired) that formed the core of classical education: &quot;If they want to learn literature, they have Luke and Mark: Let them go back to their churches and expound on them&quot;, the edict says. This was an attempt to remove some of the influence of the Christian schools which at that time and later used ancient Greek literature in their teachings in their effort to present the Christian religion as being superior to paganism. The edict also dealt a severe financial blow to many Christian scholars, tutors, and teachers, as it deprived them of students.

In his &quot;Tolerance Edict&quot; of 362, Julian decreed the reopening of pagan temples, the restitution of confiscated temple properties, and the return from exile of &quot;heretical&quot; Christian bishops who had been censured or excommunicated by the Church. The latter was an instance of tolerance of different religious views, but it may also have been an attempt by Julian to foster schisms and divisions between his Christian rivals, since disputes over what constituted orthodox Catholic teaching could become quite fierce.

====Paganism&#x27;s shift under Julian====

Julian&#x27;s popularity among the people and the army during his brief reign suggest that he might have brought paganism back to the fore of Roman public and private life. In fact, during his lifetime, neither pagan nor Christian ideology reigned supreme, and the greatest thinkers of the day argued about the merits and rationality of each religion. Most importantly for the pagan cause, though, Rome was still a predominantly pagan empire that had not wholly accepted Christianity.
Even so, Julian&#x27;s short reign did not stem the tide of Christianity. The emperor&#x27;s ultimate failure can arguably be attributed to the many religious traditions and deities that paganism promulgated. Most pagans sought religious affiliations that were unique to their culture and people, and they had internal divisions that prevented them from creating any one &#x27;pagan religion&#x27;. Indeed, the term pagan was simply a convenient appellation for Christians to lump together the believers of a system they opposed. In truth, there was no Roman religion, as modern observers would recognize it. Instead, paganism came from a system of observances that one historian has characterized as &quot;no more than a spongy mass of tolerance and tradition.&quot;

This system of tradition had already shifted dramatically by the time Julian came to power; gone were the days of massive sacrifices honoring the gods. The communal festivals that involved sacrifice and feasting, which once united communities, now tore them apart—Christian against pagan. Civic leaders did not even have the funds, much less the support, to hold religious festivals. Julian found the financial base that had supported these ventures (sacred temple funds) had been seized by his uncle Constantine to support the Christian Church. In all, Julian&#x27;s short reign simply could not shift the feeling of inertia that had swept across the Empire. Christians had denounced sacrifice, stripped temples of their funds, and cut priests and magistrates off from the social prestige and financial benefits accompanying leading pagan positions in the past. Leading politicians and civic leaders had little motivation to rock the boat by reviving pagan festivals. Instead, they chose to adopt the middle ground by having ceremonies and mass entertainment that were religiously neutral.

After witnessing the reign of two emperors bent on supporting the Church and stamping out paganism, it is understandable that pagans simply did not embrace Julian&#x27;s idea of proclaiming their devotion to polytheism and their rejection of Christianity. Many chose to adopt a practical approach and not support Julian&#x27;s public reforms actively for fear of a Christian revival. However, this apathetic attitude forced the emperor to shift central aspects of pagan worship. Julian&#x27;s attempts to reinvigorate the people shifted the focus of paganism from a system of tradition to a religion with some of the same characteristics that he opposed in Christianity. For example, Julian attempted to introduce a tighter organization for the priesthood, with greater qualifications of character and service. Classical paganism simply did not accept this idea of priests as model citizens. Priests were elites with social prestige and financial power who organized festivals and helped pay for them. Yet Julian&#x27;s attempt to impose moral strictness on the civic position of priesthood only made paganism more in tune with Christian morality, drawing it further from paganism&#x27;s system of tradition.

Indeed, this development of a pagan order created the foundations of a bridge of reconciliation over which paganism and Christianity could meet. Likewise, Julian&#x27;s persecution of Christians, who by pagan standards were simply part of a different cult, was quite an un-pagan attitude that transformed paganism into a religion that accepted only one form of religious experience while excluding all others—such as Christianity. In trying to compete with Christianity in this manner, Julian fundamentally changed the nature of pagan worship. That is, he made paganism a religion, whereas it once had been only a system of tradition.

====Juventinus and Maximus====
Many of the Church fathers viewed the emperor with hostility, and told stories of his supposed wickedness after his death. A sermon by Saint John Chrysostom, entitled &quot;On Saints Juventinus and Maximinus,&quot; tells the story of two of Julian&#x27;s soldiers at Antioch, who were overheard at a drinking party, criticizing the emperor&#x27;s religious policies, and taken into custody. According to Chrysostom, the emperor had made a deliberate effort to avoid creating martyrs of those who disagreed with his reforms; but Juventinus and Maximinus admitted to being Christians, and refused to moderate their stance. Chrysostom asserts that the emperor forbade anyone from having contact with the men, but that nobody obeyed his orders; so he had the two men executed in the middle of the night. Chrysostom urges his audience to visit the tomb of these martyrs.

====Charity====
The fact that Christian charities were open to all, including pagans, put this aspect of Roman citizens&#x27; lives out of the control of Imperial authority and under that of the Church. Thus Julian envisioned the institution of a Roman philanthropic system, and cared for the behaviour and the morality of the pagan priests, in the hope that it would mitigate the reliance of pagans on Christian charity, saying: &quot;These impious Galileans not only feed their own poor, but ours also; welcoming them into their agapae, they attract them, as children are attracted, with cakes.&quot;

===Attempt to rebuild the Jewish Temple===

In 363, not long before Julian left Antioch to launch his campaign against Persia, in keeping with his effort to oppose Christianity, he allowed Jews to rebuild their temple. The point was that the rebuilding of the temple would invalidate Jesus&#x27; prophecy about its destruction in 70, which Christians had cited as proof of Jesus&#x27; truth. But fires broke out and stopped the project. A personal friend of his, Ammianus Marcellinus, wrote this about the effort:

The failure to rebuild the Temple may be ascribed to the Galilee earthquake of 363. In the contemporary Orations of St. Gregory Nazianzen, the builders were described as &quot;being driven against one another, as though by a furious blast of wind, and sudden heaving of the earth&quot; driving some to seek refuge in a church where &quot;a flame issued forth... and stopped them.&quot; This, according to Gregory, is &quot;what all people nowadays report and believe.&quot; The 18th century writer Edward Gibbon considered this to be unreliable, positing instead sabotage or accident. Divine intervention is a common view among Christian historians, and it was seen as proof of Jesus&#x27; divinity.

Julian&#x27;s support of Jews caused Jews to call him &quot;Julian the Hellene&quot;. However, it is believed by most historians that Julian&#x27;s favor towards the Jews was more of an attempt to impede the growth of Christianity as opposed to any genuine affection towards Judaism.

== Works ==
Julian wrote several works in Greek, some of which have survived to the modern day.
* Budé indicates the numbers used by Athanassiadi given in the Budé edition (1963 &amp; 1964) of Julian&#x27;s &quot;Opera&quot;.
* Wright indicates the oration numbers provided in W. C. Wright&#x27;s edition of Julian&#x27;s works.

The religious works contain involved philosophical speculations, and the panegyrics to Constantius are formulaic and elaborate in style.

The &quot;Misopogon&quot; (or &quot;Beard Hater&quot;) is a light-hearted account of Julian&#x27;s clash with the inhabitants of Antioch after he was mocked for his beard and generally scruffy appearance for an emperor. &quot;The Caesars&quot; is a humorous tale of a contest between notable Roman emperors: Julius Caesar, Augustus, Trajan, Marcus Aurelius and Constantine, with the competition also including Alexander the Great. This was a satiric attack upon the recent Constantine, whose worth, both as a Christian and as the leader of the Roman Empire, Julian severely questions.

One of the most important of his lost works is his &quot;Against the Galileans&quot;, intended to refute the Christian religion. The only parts of this work which survive are those excerpted by Cyril of Alexandria, who gives extracts from the three first books in his refutation of Julian, &quot;Contra Julianum&quot;. These extracts do not give an adequate idea of the work: Cyril confesses that he had not ventured to copy several of the weightiest arguments.

=== Problems regarding authenticity ===
Julian&#x27;s works have been edited and translated several times since the Renaissance, most often separately; but many are translated in the Loeb Classical Library edition of 1913, edited by Wilmer Cave Wright. Wright mentions, however, that there are many problems surrounding Julian&#x27;s vast collection of works, mainly the letters ascribed to Julian. The collections of letters existing today are the result of many smaller collections, which contained varying numbers of Julian&#x27;s works in various combinations. For example, in Laurentianus 58.16, the largest collection of letters ascribed to Julian was found, containing 43 manuscripts. The origins of many letters in these collections are unclear.

Joseph Bidez and François Cumont compiled the different collections in 1922 and arrived at a total of 284 items. 157 of these were considered genuine, and 127 were regarded as spurious. This contrasts starkly with Wright&#x27;s earlier mentioned collection, which contains only 73 items which are considered genuine, along with 10 apocryphal letters. Michael Trapp notes, however, that when comparing Bidez and Cumont&#x27;s work with Wright&#x27;s, Bidez and Cumont regard as many as sixteen of Wright&#x27;s genuine letters as spurious. Which works can be ascribed to Julian is thus very much up to debate.

The problems surrounding a collection of Julian&#x27;s works are exacerbated by the fact that Julian was a motivated writer, which means it is possible that many more letters could have circulated despite his short reign. Julian himself attests to the large number of letters he had to write in a letter that is itself likely to be genuine. Julian&#x27;s religious agenda gave him even more work than the average emperor as he sought to instruct his newly styled pagan priests and dealt with discontented Christian leaders and communities. An example of him instructing his pagan priests is found in a fragment in the Vossianus MS., inserted in the Letter to Themistius.

Additionally, Julian&#x27;s hostility towards the Christian faith inspired vicious counteractions by Christian authors, as in Gregory of Nazianzus&#x27; invectives against Julian. Christians no doubt suppressed some of Julian&#x27;s works as well. This Christian influence is still visible in Wright&#x27;s much smaller collection of Julian&#x27;s letters. She comments that some letters are suddenly cut off when the contents become hostile towards Christians and believes this to be the result of Christian censorship. Notable examples appear in the &quot;Fragment of a letter to a Priest&quot; and the &quot;letter to High-Priest Theodorus.&quot;

This work made use of the Roman Emperor&#x27;s life in order to address contemporary English political and theological debates – specifically, to reply to the conservative arguments of Dr Hickes&#x27;s sermons, and defend the lawfulness of resistance in extreme cases.
* In 1847, the controversial German theologian David Friedrich Strauss published in Mannheim the pamphlet &quot;Der Romantiker auf dem Thron der Cäsaren&quot; (&quot;A Romantic on the Throne of the Caesars&quot;), in which Julian was satirised as &quot;an unworldly dreamer, a man who turned nostalgia for the ancients into a way of life and whose eyes were closed to the pressing needs of the present&quot;. In fact, this was a veiled criticism of the contemporary King Frederick William IV of Prussia, known for his romantic dreams of restoring the supposed glories of feudal Medieval society.
* Julian&#x27;s life inspired the play &quot;Emperor and Galilean&quot; published in 1873 by Henrik Ibsen.
* The late nineteenth century English novelist George Gissing read an English translation of Julian&#x27;s work in 1891
* Julian&#x27;s life and reign were the subject of the novel &quot;The Death of the Gods (Julian the Apostate)&quot; (1895) in the trilogy of historical novels entitled &quot;Christ and Antichrist&quot; (1895–1904) by the Russian Symbolist poet, novelist and literary theoretician Dmitrii S. Merezhkovskii.
* The opera &quot;Der Apostat&quot; (1924) by the composer and conductor Felix Weingartner is about Julian.
* In 1945, Nikos Kazantzakis authored the tragedy &quot;Julian the Apostate&quot; in which the emperor is depicted as an existentialist hero committed to a struggle which he knows will be in vain. It was first staged in Paris in 1948.
* The novel &quot;Imperial Renegade&quot; (1950), by Christian author Louis de Wohl.
* Julian was the subject of a novel, &quot;Julian&quot; (1964), by Gore Vidal, describing his life and times. It is notable for, among other things, its scathing critique of Christianity.
* Julian appeared in &quot;Gods and Legions&quot;, by Michael Curtis Ford (2002). Julian&#x27;s tale was told by his closest companion, the Christian saint Caesarius, and accounts for the transition from a Christian philosophy student in Athens to a pagan Roman Augustus of the old nature.
* Julian&#x27;s letters are an important part of the symbolism of Michel Butor&#x27;s novel &quot;La Modification&quot;.
* The fantasy alternate history &quot;The Dragon Waiting&quot; by John M. Ford, while set in the time of the Wars of the Roses, uses the reign of Julian as its point of divergence. His reign not being cut short, he was successful in disestablishing Christianity and restoring a religiously eclectic societal order which survived the fall of Rome and into the Renaissance. Characters in the novel refer to him as &quot;Julian the Wise&quot;.
*The dystopian speculative fiction novel by Robert Charles Wilson, &quot;Julian Comstock: A Story of 22nd-Century America,&quot; parallels the life of Julian with the titular character as the hereditary president of an oligarchic future United States of America who tries to restore science and combat the fundamentalist Christianity that has taken over the country.
*A student paper by the narrator fills out the center of the 2022 novel &quot;Elizabeth Finch&quot; by Julian Barnes.
*C.P. Cavafy wrote 6 poems about Julian in 1923–1935.

===Film===

* An Italian movie treatment of his life, &quot;Giuliano l&#x27;Apostata&quot;, was released in 1919.

===Street named===
During the British Mandate period in Jerusalem, ‘Julian Way,’ initially named after the Emperor, was later renamed King David Street after the establishment of the State of Israel.

<doc id="16302" wikidata="Q702209" url="?curid=16302" title="John Cicero, Elector of Brandenburg">
<text>John II (2 August 1455 – 9 January 1499) was Elector of Brandenburg from 1486 until his death, the fourth of the House of Hohenzollern. After his death he received the cognomen Cicero, after the Roman orator of the same name, but the elector&#x27;s eloquence and interest in the arts is debatable.

John Cicero was the eldest son of Elector Albert III Achilles of Brandenburg with his first wife Margaret of Baden. As his father then ruled as Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach (from 1457 also as Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach), he was born at the Hohenzollern residence of Ansbach in Franconia, where he spent his childhood years until in 1466 he received the call to Brandenburg as presumed heir by his uncle Elector Frederick II. He joined him in the War of the Succession of Stettin with the Pomeranian dukes, until Frederick resigned in 1470 and was succeeded by John&#x27;s father, who in 1473 appointed him regent of the Brandenburg lands. After the Pomeranian struggle he also had to deal with the inheritance conflict upon the 1476 death of the Piast duke Henry XI of Głogów, husband of his half-sister Barbara.

On 25 August 1476 in Berlin John married Margaret of Wettin, a daughter of Landgrave William III of Thuringia with Anne, Duchess of Luxembourg. Their children were:
# Wolfgang, born and died 1482.
# Joachim I Nestor, Elector of Brandenburg (21 February 1484 – 11 July 1535), Elector of Brandenburg.
# Elisabeth, born and died 1486.
# Anna of Brandenburg (27 August 1487, Berlin – 3 May 1514, Kiel), married 10 April 1502 to King Frederick I of Denmark.
# Ursula of Brandenburg (17 October 1488 – 18 September 1510, Güstrow), married 16 February 1507 to Duke Henry V, Duke of Mecklenburg.
# Albert of Mainz (1490, Berlin – 24 September 1545, Mainz), Cardinal since 1518, Archbishop of Magdeburg in 1513–45, Archbishop of Mainz in 1514–45.

John succeeded his father as elector in 1486, while the Franconian possessions of the Hohenzollern dynasty passed to his younger brothers Frederick I and Siegmund. He decreed that the &quot;Stadtschloss&quot; in Berlin, erected at the behest of his uncle Frederick II, should serve as the permanent residence of the Brandenburg electors, the beginning of the city&#x27;s history as a state capital. He also implemented an excise tax on beer in 1488, which sparked several disturbances, mainly in the towns of the Altmark region. 

In 1490 John was able to purchase the former Lusatian territory around Zossen, acknowledged by the Bohemian king Vladislaus II, and maintained the succession claims of the Hohenzollern dynasty to the Pomeranian lands held by the House of Griffins. He died in 1499 from pleural effusion at Arneburg Castle and was succeeded by his eldest son Joachim I. John was the first of the Hohenzollern electors to be buried in Brandenburg, first at Lehnin Abbey, later transferred to Berlin Cathedral by order of his grandson Joachim II.

<text>John Sigismund (; 8 November 1572 – 23 December 1619) was a Prince-elector of the Margraviate of Brandenburg from the House of Hohenzollern. He became the Duke of Prussia through his marriage to Duchess Anna, the eldest daughter of Duke Albert Frederick of Prussia who died without sons. Their marriage resulted in the potential creation of Brandenburg-Prussia, which became a reality after Poland&#x27;s leader appointed John Sigismund in charge of Prussia in regency and, shortly thereafter, Albert Frederick died without an able, direct male heir.

==Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia==
John Sigismund was born in Halle an der Saale to Joachim III Frederick, Elector of Brandenburg, and his first wife Catherine of Brandenburg-Küstrin. He succeeded his father as Margrave of Brandenburg in 1608. In 1611, John Sigismund traveled from Königsberg to Warsaw, where on 16 November 1611 he gave feudal homage to Sigismund III Vasa, King of Poland (the Duchy of Prussia was a Polish fief at the time). He officially became Duke of Prussia in 1618, although he had served as regent on behalf of the mentally-disturbed Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia, for several years prior. He suffered a stroke in 1616 from which he didn&#x27;t recover and died in 1619.

John Sigismund gave the Reichshof Castrop to his teacher and educator Carl Friedrich von Bordelius. Through his wife, he became a major claimant in the War of the Julich Succession. He received the territories of Cleves, Mark, and Ravensberg in the Treaty of Xanten in 1614.

==Religious policy==
John Sigismund&#x27;s most significant action was his conversion from Lutheranism to Calvinism, after he had earlier equalized the rights of Catholics and Protestants in the Duchy of Prussia under pressure from the King of Poland. He probably became Calvinist during a visit to Heidelberg in 1606, but it was not until 25 December 1613 that he publicly took communion according to the Calvinist rite. The vast majority of his subjects in Brandenburg, including his wife Anna of Prussia, remained deeply Lutheran, however. After the Elector and his Calvinist court officials drew up plans for mass conversion of the population to the new faith in February 1614, as provided for by the rule of &quot;Cuius regio, eius religio&quot; within the Holy Roman Empire, there were serious protests, with his wife backing the Lutherans. Resistance was so strong that in 1615, John Sigismund backed down and relinquished all attempts at forcible conversion. Instead, he allowed his subjects to be either Lutheran or Calvinist according to the dictates of their own consciences. Henceforward, Brandenburg-Prussia would be a bi-confessional state.

==Family and children==
On 30 October 1594, John Sigismund married Anna of Prussia, daughter of Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia (1553–1618). She was the elder sister of his stepmother. They were parents to eight children:

* George William of Brandenburg (13 November 1595 – 1 December 1640). His successor.
* Anna Sophia of Brandenburg (18 March 1598 – 19 December 1659). Married Frederick Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg.
* Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg (11 November 1599 – 28 March 1655). Married Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. They were parents of Christina of Sweden.
* Catherine of Brandenburg (28 May 1602 – 27 August 1649). Married first Gabriel Bethlen, Prince of Transylvania and secondly Franz Karl of Saxe-Lauenburg.
* Joachim Sigismund of Brandenburg (25 July 1603 – 22 February 1625) died aged 25 unmarried and without issue.
* Agnes of Brandenburg (31 August 1606 – 12 March 1607) died in infancy.
* John Frederick of Brandenburg (18 August 1607 – 1 March 1608) died in infancy.
* Albrecht Christian of Brandenburg (7–14 March 1609) died in infancy.

<text>Paul Jackson Pollock (; January 28, 1912August 11, 1956) was an American painter. A major figure in the abstract expressionist movement, Pollock was widely noticed for his &quot;drip technique&quot; of pouring or splashing liquid household paint onto a horizontal surface, enabling him to view and paint his canvases from all angles. It was called all-over painting and action painting, since he covered the entire canvas and used the force of his whole body to paint, often in a frenetic dancing style. This extreme form of abstraction divided critics: some praised the immediacy of the creation, while others derided the random effects.

A reclusive and volatile personality, Pollock struggled with alcoholism for most of his life. In 1945, he married the artist Lee Krasner, who became an important influence on his career and on his legacy. Pollock died at age 44 in an alcohol-related single-car collision when he was driving. In December 1956, four months after his death, Pollock was given a memorial retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City. A larger, more comprehensive exhibition of his work was held there in 1967. In 1998 and 1999, his work was honored with large-scale retrospective exhibitions at MoMA and the Tate Gallery in London.

==Early life (1912–1936)==
Paul Jackson Pollock was born in Cody, Wyoming, on January 28, 1912, the youngest of five brothers. His parents, Stella May (née McClure) and LeRoy Pollock, were born and grew up in Tingley, Iowa, and were educated at Tingley High School. Pollock&#x27;s mother is interred at Tingley Cemetery, Ringgold County, Iowa. His father had been born with the surname McCoy, but took the surname of his adoptive parents. Stella and LeRoy Pollock were Presbyterian; they were of Irish and Scots-Irish descent, respectively. LeRoy Pollock was a farmer and later a land surveyor for the government, moving for different jobs. Stella, proud of her family&#x27;s heritage as weavers, made and sold dresses as a teenager. In November 1912, Stella took her sons to San Diego; Jackson was just 10 months old and would never return to Cody. He subsequently grew up in Arizona and Chico, California.

While living in the Vermont Square neighborhood of Los Angeles, he enrolled at Manual Arts High School, from which he was expelled. He had already been expelled in 1928 from another high school. During his early life, Pollock explored Native American culture while on surveying trips with his father. He was also heavily influenced by Mexican muralists, particularly José Clemente Orozco, whose fresco &quot;Prometheus&quot; he would later call &quot;the greatest painting in North America&quot;.

In 1930, following his older brother Charles Pollock, he moved to New York City, where they both studied under Thomas Hart Benton at the Art Students League. Benton&#x27;s rural American subject matter had little influence on Pollock&#x27;s work, but his rhythmic use of paint and his fierce independence were more lasting. In the early 1930s, Pollock spent a summer touring the Western United States together with Glen Rounds, a fellow art student, and Benton, their teacher.

==Career (1936–1954)==
Pollock was introduced to the use of liquid paint in 1936 at an experimental workshop in New York City by the Mexican muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros. In the summer, he went to Dartmouth College to study José Clemente Orozco&#x27;s 3,200 square foot mural, &quot;The Epic of American Civilization.&quot; He later used paint pouring as one of several techniques on canvases of the early 1940s, such as &quot;Male and Female&quot; and &quot;Composition with Pouring I&quot;. After his move to Springs, New York, he began painting with his canvases laid out on the studio floor and he developed what was later called his &quot;drip&quot; technique.
From 1938 to 1942 Pollock worked for the WPA Federal Art Project. During this time Pollock was trying to deal with his established alcoholism; from 1938 through 1941 he underwent Jungian psychotherapy with Dr. Joseph L. Henderson and later with Dr. Violet Staub de Laszlo in 1941–42. Henderson engaged him through his art, encouraging Pollock to make drawings. Jungian concepts and archetypes were expressed in his paintings. Some psychiatrists have hypothesized that Pollock might have had bipolar disorder.
Pollock signed a gallery contract with Peggy Guggenheim in July 1943. He received the commission to create the &quot;Mural&quot; (1943) for the entry to her new townhouse. At the suggestion of her friend and advisor Marcel Duchamp, Pollock painted the work on canvas, rather than the wall, so that it would be portable. After seeing the big mural, the art critic Clement Greenberg wrote: &quot;I took one look at it and I thought, &#x27;Now that&#x27;s great art,&#x27; and I knew Jackson was the greatest painter this country had produced.&quot; The catalog introducing his first exhibition described Pollock&#x27;s talent as &quot;volcanic. It has fire. It is unpredictable. It is undisciplined. It spills out of itself in a mineral prodigality, not yet crystallized.&quot;

===Drip period===

Pollock&#x27;s most famous paintings were made during the &quot;drip period&quot; between 1947 and 1950. However, when investigating the impact that other artists have had on Pollock and his &quot;drip paintings&quot;, the time that Pollock spent working and studying in the Experimental Workshop with David Alfaro Siqueiros in 1936 is rarely investigated or acknowledged. According to Robert Storr, &quot;there is no other experience in his professional life that is equal to the decade that he spent learning from and observing the modern Mexican muralists…,&quot; especially when comparing this period of informal training to his formal education with Thomas Hart Benton, which, although critical to his beginnings, was short lived. Additionally, when specifically asked about how the &quot;drip&quot; came to be, Pollock disavowed his association with Siquieros on multiple occasions and made contradictory statements. For example, in 1947, Pollock suggests that he painted his canvases on the floor because he witnessed the Navajo sand artist at the Natural History Museum in New York do it in 1941 (five years after he witnessed Siqueiros do it in 1936), and soon after, he suggested that he painted his canvases on the floor because &quot;the Oriental’s did it&quot;. Eventually, Pollock became famous from his &quot;drip&quot; paintings, and on August 8, 1949, in a four-page spread in &quot;Life&quot; magazine, he was asked, &quot;Is he the greatest living painter in the United States?&quot; Thanks to the mediation of Alfonso Ossorio, a close friend of Pollock, and the art historian Michel Tapié, the young gallery owner Paul Facchetti, from March 7, 1952, managed to realize the first exhibition of Pollock&#x27;s works from 1948 to 1951 in his Studio Paul Facchetti in Paris and in Europe. At the peak of his fame, Pollock abruptly abandoned the drip style. Pollock&#x27;s drip paintings were influenced by the artist Janet Sobel; the art critic Clement Greenberg would later report that Pollock &quot;admitted&quot; to him that Sobel&#x27;s work &quot;had made an impression on him.&quot;

Pollock&#x27;s work after 1951 was darker in color, including a collection painted in black on unprimed canvases. These paintings have been referred to as his &quot;Black pourings&quot; and when he exhibited them at the Betty Parsons Gallery in New York, none of them sold. Parsons later sold one to a friend at half the price. These works show Pollock attempting to find a balance between abstraction and depictions of the figure.

He later returned to using color and continued with figurative elements. During this period, Pollock had moved to the Sidney Janis Gallery, a more commercial gallery; the demand for his work from collectors was great. In response to this pressure, along with personal frustration, his alcoholism deepened.

===Relationship with Lee Krasner===
Pollock and Lee Krasner met while they both exhibited at the McMillen Gallery in 1942. Krasner was unfamiliar yet intrigued with Pollock&#x27;s work and went to his apartment, unannounced, to meet him following the gallery exhibition. In October 1945, Pollock and Krasner were married in a church with two witnesses present for the event. In November, they moved out of the city to the Springs area of East Hampton on the south shore of Long Island. With the help of a down-payment loan from Peggy Guggenheim, they bought a wood-frame house and barn at 830 Springs Fireplace Road. Pollock converted the barn into a studio. In that space, he perfected his &quot;drip&quot; technique of working with paint, with which he would become permanently identified. When the couple found themselves free from work they enjoyed spending their time together cooking and baking, working on the house and garden, and entertaining friends.
Krasner&#x27;s influence on her husband&#x27;s art was something critics began to reassess by the latter half of the 1960s due to the rise of feminism at the time. Krasner&#x27;s extensive knowledge and training in modern art and techniques helped her bring Pollock up to date with what contemporary art should be. Krasner is often considered to have tutored her husband in the tenets of modernistic painting. Pollock was then able to change his style to fit a more organized and cosmopolitan genre of modern art, and Krasner became the one judge he could trust. At the beginning of the two artists&#x27; marriage, Pollock would trust his peers&#x27; opinions on what did or did not work in his pieces. Krasner was also responsible for introducing him to many collectors, critics, and artists, including Herbert Matter, who would help further his career as an emerging artist. Art dealer John Bernard Myers once said &quot;there would never have been a Jackson Pollock without a Lee Pollock&quot;, whereas fellow painter Fritz Bultman referred to Pollock as Krasner&#x27;s &quot;creation, her Frankenstein&quot;, both men recognizing the immense influence Krasner had on Pollock&#x27;s career.

Jackson Pollock&#x27;s influence on his wife&#x27;s artwork is often discussed by art historians. Many people thought that Krasner began to reproduce and reinterpret her husband&#x27;s chaotic paint splatters in her own work. There are several accounts where Krasner intended to use her own intuition as a way to move towards Pollock&#x27;s &quot;I am nature&quot; technique in order to reproduce nature in her art.

==Later years and death (1955–1956)==

In 1955, Pollock painted &quot;Scent&quot; and &quot;Search&quot;, his last two paintings. He did not paint at all in 1956, but was making sculptures at Tony Smith&#x27;s home: constructions of wire, gauze, and plaster. Shaped by sand-casting, they have heavily textured surfaces similar to what Pollock often created in his paintings.

Pollock and Krasner&#x27;s relationship began to crumble by 1956, owing to Pollock&#x27;s continuing alcoholism and infidelity involving another artist, Ruth Kligman. On August 11, 1956, at 10:15 p.m., Pollock died in a single-car crash in his Oldsmobile convertible while driving under the influence of alcohol. At the time, Krasner was visiting friends in Europe; she abruptly returned on hearing the news from a friend. One of the passengers, Edith Metzger, was also killed in the accident, which occurred less than a mile from Pollock&#x27;s home. The other passenger, Ruth Kligman, survived. In December 1956, four months after his death, Pollock was given a memorial retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City. A larger, more comprehensive exhibition of his work was held there in 1967. In 1998 and 1999, his work was honored with large-scale retrospective exhibitions at MoMA and at The Tate in London.

For the rest of her life, his widow Lee Krasner managed his estate and ensured that Pollock&#x27;s reputation remained strong despite changing art world trends. The couple are buried in Green River Cemetery in Springs with a large boulder marking his grave and a smaller one marking hers.

==Artistry==
===Influence and technique===
The work of Thomas Hart Benton, Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró influenced Pollock.
Pollock started using synthetic resin-based paints called alkyd enamels, which at that time was a novel medium. Pollock described this use of household paints, instead of artist&#x27;s paints, as &quot;a natural growth out of a need&quot;. He used hardened brushes, sticks, and even basting syringes as paint applicators. Pollock&#x27;s technique of pouring and dripping paint is thought to be one of the origins of the term action painting. With this technique, Pollock was able to achieve his own signature style palimpsest paintings, with paints flowing from his chosen tool onto the canvas. By defying the convention of painting on an upright surface, he added a new dimension by being able to view and apply paint to his canvases from all directions.

In 1936, Pollock participated in an experimental workshop run by the Mexican muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros. It was there that he first used liquid enamel paints, which he continued to incorporate in his paintings in the early to mid 1940s, long before he encountered the work of 
the Ukrainian American artist Janet Sobel (1894–1968) (born Jennie Lechovsky). Peggy Guggenheim included Sobel&#x27;s work in her &quot;The Art of This Century Gallery&quot; in 1945. Jackson Pollock and art critic Clement Greenberg saw Sobel&#x27;s work there in 1946 and later Greenberg noted that Sobel was &quot;a direct influence on Jackson Pollock&#x27;s drip painting technique&quot;. In his essay &quot;American-Type Painting&quot;, Greenberg noted those works were the first of all-over painting he had seen, and said, &quot;Pollock admitted that these pictures had made an impression on him&quot;.

While painting this way, Pollock moved away from figurative representation, and challenged the Western tradition of using easel and brush. He used the force of his whole body to paint, which was expressed on the large canvases. In 1956, &quot;Time&quot; magazine dubbed Pollock &quot;Jack the Dripper&quot; due to his painting style.

Pollock observed Native American sandpainting demonstrations in the 1940s. Referring to his style of painting on the floor, Pollock stated, &quot;I feel nearer, more a part of the painting, since this way I can walk round it, work from the four sides and literally be in the painting. This is akin to the methods of the Indian sand painters of the West.&quot; Other influences on his drip technique include the Mexican muralists and Surrealist automatism. Pollock denied reliance on &quot;the accident&quot;; he usually had an idea of how he wanted a particular work to appear. His technique combined the movement of his body, over which he had control, the viscous flow of paint, the force of gravity, and the absorption of paint into the canvas. It was a mixture of controllable and uncontrollable factors. Flinging, dripping, pouring, and spattering, he would move energetically around the canvas, almost as if in a dance, and would not stop until he saw what he wanted to see.

Austrian artist Wolfgang Paalen&#x27;s article on totem art of the indigenous people of British Columbia, in which the concept of space in totemist art is considered from an artist&#x27;s point of view, influenced Pollock as well; Pollock owned a signed and dedicated copy of the Amerindian Number of Paalen&#x27;s magazine (DYN 4–5, 1943). He had also seen Paalen&#x27;s surrealist paintings in an exhibition in 1940. Another strong influence must have been Paalen&#x27;s surrealist &quot;fumage&quot; technique, which appealed to painters looking for new ways to depict what was called the &quot;unseen&quot; or the &quot;possible&quot;. The technique was once demonstrated in Matta&#x27;s workshop, about which Steven Naifeh reports, &quot;Once, when Matta was demonstrating the Surrealist technique [Paalen&#x27;s] Fumage, Jackson [Pollock] turned to (Peter) Busa and said in a stage whisper: &#x27;I can do that without the smoke. Pollock&#x27;s painter friend Fritz Bultman even stated, &quot;It was Wolfgang Paalen who started it all.&quot;

In 1950, Hans Namuth, a young photographer, wanted to take pictures—both stills and moving—of Pollock at work. Pollock promised to start a new painting especially for the photographic session, but when Namuth arrived, Pollock apologized and told him the painting was finished.
Namuth said that when he entered the studio:

===From naming to numbering===
Continuing to evade the viewer&#x27;s search for figurative elements in his paintings, Pollock abandoned titles and started numbering his works. He said about this, &quot;[L]ook passively and try to receive what the painting has to offer and not bring a subject matter or preconceived idea of what they are to be looking for.&quot; His wife said, &quot;He used to give his pictures conventional titles ... but now he simply numbers them. Numbers are neutral. They make people look at a picture for what it is—pure painting.&quot;

===Critical debate===
Pollock&#x27;s work has been the subject of important critical debates. Critic Robert Coates once derided a number of Pollock&#x27;s works as &quot;mere unorganized explosions of random energy, and therefore meaningless&quot;. &quot;Reynold&#x27;s News&quot;, in a 1959 headline, said, &quot;This is not art—it&#x27;s a joke in bad taste.&quot; French abstract painter Jean Hélion, on the other hand, remarked on first seeing a Pollock, &quot;It filled out space going on and on because it did not have a start or end to it.&quot; Clement Greenberg supported Pollock&#x27;s work on formalistic grounds. It fit well with Greenberg&#x27;s view of art history as a progressive purification in form and elimination of historical content. He considered Pollock&#x27;s work to be the best painting of its day and the culmination of the Western tradition via Cubism and Cézanne to Manet.

In a 1952 article in &quot;ARTnews&quot;, Harold Rosenberg coined the term &quot;action painting&quot; and wrote that &quot;what was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event. The big moment came when it was decided to paint &#x27;just to paint&#x27;. The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation from value—political, aesthetic, moral.&quot; Many people assumed that he had modeled his &quot;action painter&quot; paradigm on Pollock.
The Congress for Cultural Freedom, an organization to promote American culture and values, backed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), sponsored exhibitions of Pollock&#x27;s work. Some left-wing scholars, including Eva Cockcroft, have argued that the United States government and wealthy elite embraced Pollock and abstract expressionism to place the United States in the forefront of global art and devalue socialist realism. Cockcroft wrote that Pollock became a &quot;weapon of the Cold War&quot;.

Pollock described his art as &quot;motion made visible memories, arrested in space&quot;.

==Legacy==
===Influence===
Pollock&#x27;s staining into raw canvas was adapted by the Color Field painters Helen Frankenthaler and Morris Louis. Frank Stella made &quot;all-over composition&quot; a hallmark of his works of the 1960s. Joseph Glasco was introduced to Pollock by Alfonso Ossorio in 1949. Throughout his life, Glasco continued to reflect on Pollock’s artistic influence, particularly in the early to mid-1970s when his style changed to all-over collage paintings with their emphasis on rhythm and process. The Happenings artist Allan Kaprow, sculptors Richard Serra and Eva Hesse, and many contemporary artists have retained Pollock&#x27;s emphasis on the process of creation; they were influenced by his approach to the process, rather than the look of his work.

In 2004, &quot;One: Number 31, 1950&quot; was ranked the eighth-most influential piece of modern art in a poll of 500 artists, curators, critics, and dealers.

===In pop culture and media===
In the early 1990s, three groups of movie makers were developing Pollock biographical projects, each based on a different source. The project that at first seemed most advanced was a joint venture between Barbra Streisand&#x27;s Barwood Films and Robert De Niro&#x27;s TriBeCa Productions (De Niro&#x27;s parents were friends of Krasner and Pollock). The script, by Christopher Cleveland, was to be based on Jeffrey Potter&#x27;s 1985 oral biography, &quot;To a Violent Grave&quot;, a collection of reminiscences by Pollock&#x27;s friends. Streisand was to play the role of Lee Krasner, and De Niro was to portray Pollock. A second was to be based on &quot;Love Affair&quot; (1974), a memoir by Ruth Kligman, who was Pollock&#x27;s lover in the six months before his death. This was to be directed by Harold Becker, with Al Pacino playing Pollock.

In 2000, the biographical film &quot;Pollock&quot;, based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, &quot;Jackson Pollock: An American Saga&quot;, directed by and starring Ed Harris, was released. Marcia Gay Harden won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Lee Krasner. The movie was the project of Harris, who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Harris himself painted the works seen in the film. The Pollock-Krasner Foundation did not authorize or collaborate with any production.

In September 2009, the art historian Henry Adams claimed in &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine that Pollock had written his name in his famous painting &quot;Mural&quot; (1943). The painting is now insured for US$140 million. In 2011, the Republican Iowa State Representative Scott Raecker introduced a bill to force the sale of the artwork, held by the University of Iowa, to fund scholarships, but his bill created such controversy that it was quickly withdrawn.

One of Jackson Pollock&#x27;s works is featured heavily in the film Ex Machina. A pivotal scene in the film contains a monologue where antagonist Nathan Bateman describes the central challenge of artificial intelligence as engineering a cognitive state that is &quot;not deliberate, not random, but somewhere in between,&quot; which he likens to the cognitive state Pollock achieves while painting.

===Art market===
In 1973, &quot;Number 11, 1952&quot; (also known as &quot;Blue Poles&quot;) was purchased by the Australian Gough Whitlam government for the National Gallery of Australia for US$2 million (A$1.3 million at the time of payment). This was the highest price ever paid for a modern painting and the painting is now one of the most popular exhibits. The artwork contains only a fleeting reference to the &quot;real world&quot; and &quot;Blue Poles&quot; has become the flagship of autonomous art. &quot;Blue Poles&quot; was a centerpiece of the Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s 1998 retrospective in New York, the first time the painting had been shown in America since its purchase.

In November 2006, Pollock&#x27;s &quot;No. 5, 1948&quot; became the world&#x27;s most expensive painting, when it was sold privately to an undisclosed buyer for the sum of US$140 million. Another artist record was established in 2004, when &quot;No. 12&quot; (1949), a medium-sized drip painting that had been shown in the United States Pavilion at the 1950 Venice Biennale, fetched US$11.7 million at Christie&#x27;s, New York. In 2012, &quot;Number 28, 1951&quot;, one of the artist&#x27;s combinations of drip and brushwork in shades of silvery gray with red, yellow, and shots of blue and white, also sold at Christie&#x27;s, New York, for US$20.5 million—US$23 million with fees—within its estimated range of US$20 million to US$30 million.

In 2013, Pollock&#x27;s &quot;Number 19&quot; (1948) was sold by Christie&#x27;s for a reported US$58,363,750 during an auction that ultimately reached US$495 million total sales in one night, which Christie&#x27;s reports as a record to date as the most expensive auction of contemporary art.

In February 2016, Bloomberg News reported that Kenneth C. Griffin had purchased Jackson Pollock&#x27;s 1948 painting &quot;Number 17A&quot; for US$200 million, from David Geffen.

In 2023, an unknown Pollock painting was reportedly discovered in Bulgaria after international police agencies were able to track down a group of international art smugglers. The painting is reportedly worth up to 50 million euros.

In 2024, Kasmin announced exclusive global representation of Jackson Pollock. Kasmin has been representing Lee Krasner since 2016.

==Authenticity issues==
The Pollock-Krasner Authentication Board was created by the Pollock-Krasner Foundation in 1990 to evaluate newly found works for an upcoming supplement to the 1978 catalogue. In the past, however, the Pollock-Krasner Foundation has declined to be involved in authentication cases.

In 2006, a documentary, &quot;Who the *$&amp;% Is Jackson Pollock?&quot;, was made concerning Teri Horton, a truck driver who bought an abstract painting for five dollars at a thrift store in California in 1992. This work may be a lost Pollock painting, but its authenticity is debated. Thomas Hoving is shown in the documentary and states that the painting is on a primed canvas, which Pollock never used.

&quot;Untitled 1950&quot;, which the New York-based Knoedler Gallery had sold in 2007 for $17 million to Pierre Lagrange, a London hedge-fund multimillionaire, was subject to an authenticity suit before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Done in the painter&#x27;s classic drip-and-splash style and signed &quot;J. Pollock&quot;, the modest-sized painting (15 by 28 1/2 in) was found to contain yellow paint pigments not commercially available until about 1970. The suit was settled in a confidential agreement in 2012.

===Fractal computer analysis===
In 1999, the physicist and artist Richard Taylor used computer analysis to show similarities between Pollock&#x27;s painted patterns and fractals (patterns that recur on multiple size scales) found in natural scenery, reflecting Pollock&#x27;s own words: &quot;I am nature&quot;. His research team labelled Pollock&#x27;s style fractal expressionism.

In 2003, 24 Pollockesque paintings and drawings were found in a locker in Wainscott, New York. In 2005, The Pollock-Krasner Foundation requested a fractal analysis to be used for the first time in an authenticity dispute. Researchers at the University of Oregon used the technique to identify differences between the patterns in the six disputed paintings analyzed and those in 14 established Pollocks. Pigment analysis of the paintings by researchers at Harvard University showed the presence in one painting of a synthetic pigment that was not patented until the 1980s, and materials in two others that were not available in Pollock&#x27;s lifetime.

In 2007, a traveling museum exhibition of the paintings was mounted and was accompanied by a comprehensive book, &quot;Pollock Matters&quot;, written by Ellen G. Landau, one of the four sitting scholars from the former Pollock Krasner Foundation authentication panel from the 1990s, and Claude Cernuschi, a scholar in Abstract Expressionism. In the book, Landau demonstrates the many connections between the family who owns the paintings and Jackson Pollock during his lifetime to place the paintings in what she believes to be their proper historic context. Landau also presents the forensic findings of Harvard University and presents possible explanations for the forensic inconsistencies that were found in three of the 24 paintings. However, the scientist who invented one of the modern pigments dismissed the possibility that Pollock used this paint as being &quot;unlikely to the point of fantasy&quot;.

Subsequently, over 10 scientific groups have performed fractal analysis on over 50 of Pollock&#x27;s works. A 2015 study that used fractal analysis as one of its techniques achieved a 93% success rate distinguishing real from fake Pollocks. Current research of Fractal Expressionism focuses on human response to viewing fractals. Cognitive neuroscientists have shown that Pollock&#x27;s fractals induce the same stress-reduction in observers as computer-generated fractals and naturally occurring fractals.

==Archives==
Lee Krasner donated Pollock&#x27;s papers to the Archives of American Art in 1983. They were later archived with her own papers. The Archives of American Art also houses the Charles Pollock papers, which include correspondence, photographs, and other files relating to his brother Jackson.

A separate organization, the Pollock-Krasner Foundation, was established in 1985. The foundation functions as the official estate for both Pollock and his widow, but also under the terms of Krasner&#x27;s will, serves &quot;to assist individual working artists of merit with financial need&quot;. The U.S. copyright representative for the Pollock-Krasner Foundation is the Artists Rights Society.

The Pollock-Krasner House and Studio is owned and administered by the Stony Brook Foundation, a nonprofit affiliate of Stony Brook University. Regular tours of the house and studio occur from May through October.

Li Lianjie (courtesy name Yangzhong; born 26 April 1963), better known by his stage name Jet Li, is a Chinese-born Singaporean martial artist, actor, and philanthropist. After three years of training with acclaimed wushu teacher Wu Bin, Li won his first national championship for the Beijing Wushu Team in 1974, winning the first of five men&#x27;s national championships. After his retirement from the sport in 1979, he went on to win great acclaim as an actor, making his debut with the Chinese-Hong Kong martial arts film &quot;Shaolin Temple&quot; (1982), which instantly catapulted him to stardom in East Asia.

Though continued success followed after two sequels in 1984 and 1986, Li had a major breakthrough across Asia with the &quot;Once Upon a Time in China&quot; film series (1991–1993), in which he portrayed Chinese folk hero Wong Fei-hung. He starred in his directorial debut film &quot;Born to Defence&quot; (1986), which saw Li, for the first time, playing a character in a period setting. Many of his 1990s martial arts films are regarded as classics of the genre, particularly &quot;Swordsman II&quot; (1992), &quot;Fong Sai-yuk&quot; (1993), and &quot;Fist of Legend&quot; (1994). Before transitioning to Hollywood in the late 1990s, he appeared in several contemporary Hong Kong action films which fused guns and kung fu, most notably &quot;High Risk&quot; (1995), &quot;Black Mask&quot; (1996), and &quot;Hitman&quot; (1998). His movie career in China is credited with reviving wushu in Hong Kong martial arts films during the 1990s, and revitalising the Shaolin Temple. Li is also noted for his contribution to making new wuxia films popular internationally during his career.

Li made his Hollywood debut as a villain in the 1998 buddy cop action film &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot;. His first leading role in a Hollywood film was as Han Sing in &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot; (2000). He went on to star in many international action films, including in French cinema with the Luc Besson-produced films &quot;Kiss of the Dragon&quot; (2001) and &quot;Unleashed&quot; (2005). He continued to be active in Hong Kong cinema, appearing in the critically acclaimed film &quot;Hero&quot; (2002), &quot;Fearless&quot; (2006), which marked his final wushu martial arts film, and &quot;The Warlords&quot; (2007). For the latter, he became the highest paid actor in a Chinese-language movie, previously holding the record for his part in &quot;Hero&quot;. In 2008, he portrayed the title character villain in &quot;The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor&quot; and starred in the US-China co-production &quot;The Forbidden Kingdom&quot;, which marked his first collaboration with fellow martial arts star Jackie Chan. From 2010 to 2014, he appeared in the first three films in the ensemble action film series &quot;The Expendables&quot;. 

With a film career spanning more than forty years, Li is regarded as one of the most iconic Chinese film stars, one of the most renowned martial arts stars of his generation, and one of the greatest martial arts stars in the history of cinema. In 2004, he topped &quot;Forbes&quot; list of China&#x27;s richest stars. As a philanthropist, he founded One Foundation in 2007, which was registered in 2011 as the first private charitable fundraising organization in China. He also co-founded &quot;Taiji Zen&quot;, an online health and wellness program providing instruction in meditation and tai chi. Li was named by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the 100 Most Influential People in 2010.

== Early life and martial arts career ==
Li was born in Beijing, China, and was the youngest of two boys and two girls. His ancestral home is in Shenyang, China. When he was two years old, his father died and his family then lived in poverty.

Li was eight when his talent for Wushu was noticed as he practiced at a school summer course. He then attended a non-sparring wushu event, followed by joining the Beijing Wushu Team which did a martial art display at the All China Games. Renowned coaches Li Junfeng and Wu Bin made extra efforts to help the talented boy develop. Wu Bin even bought food for Li&#x27;s family in order to boost Li&#x27;s protein intake.

A very young Li competed against adults and was the national all-around champion from 1975 to 1979.

In 1974, Li was part of a delegation of forty-three martial arts practitioners who traveled to the United States as part of China&#x27;s people&#x27;s diplomacy. The group performed for American audiences in Hawaii, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C.

According to Li, once, as a child, when the Chinese National Wushu Team went to perform for President Richard Nixon in the United States, he was asked by Nixon to be his personal bodyguard. Li replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to protect any individual. When I grow up, I want to defend my one billion Chinese countrymen!&quot;

Li is a master of several styles of wushu, especially &quot;changquan&quot; and &quot;fanziquan&quot;. He has also studied other arts including &quot;baguazhang&quot;, tai chi, &quot;xingyiquan&quot;, drunken boxing, Eagle Claw, and Praying Mantis. He did not learn &quot;Nanquan&quot; (&quot;Southern Boxing&quot;), because his training focused only in the Northern Shaolin Styles. He has also mastered wushu&#x27;s main weapons, such as &quot;Sanjiegun&quot; (Three Section Staff), &quot;Gun&quot;, &quot;Dao&quot; (Broadsword), &quot;Jian&quot; (Straight Sword).

Li retired from competitive wushu when he was only 18 due to a knee injury, but became an assistant coach of the Beijing Wushu team for a few years. Li&#x27;s martial arts prowess would eventually contribute to his domestic and international fame.

== Acting career ==

=== Chinese and Hong Kong films ===
The fame gained by his sports winnings led to a career as a martial arts film star, beginning in mainland China and then continuing into Hong Kong. Li acquired his screen name in 1982 in the Philippines when a publicity company thought his real name was too hard to pronounce. They likened his career to an aircraft, which likewise &quot;takes-off&quot; as quickly, so they placed the name Jet Li on the movie posters. Soon everybody was calling him by this new name, which was also based on the nickname, &quot;Jet&quot;, given to him as a young student, due to his speed and grace when training with the Beijing Wushu team.

He made his film debut with the 1982 film &quot;Shaolin Temple&quot;. The film broke box office records in China, grossing () at the Chinese box office, from an estimated ticket sales. The sequel &quot;Kids From Shaolin&quot; sold an estimated tickets, making it 1984&#x27;s highest-grossing film in China.

Some of his more famous Chinese films include:
* The &quot;Shaolin Temple&quot; series (1, 2 and 3), which are considered to be the films which sparked the rebirth of the real Shaolin Temple in Dengfeng, China;
* The &quot;Once Upon a Time in China&quot; series (Chinese title: &quot;Wong Fei Hung&quot;), about the legendary Chinese folk hero Master Wong Fei Hung.
* &quot;Fist of Legend&quot; (Chinese title: &quot;Jing Wu Ying Xiong&quot;), a remake of Bruce Lee&#x27;s &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; (1972).
* The &quot;Fong Sai Yuk&quot; films about another Chinese folk hero.

Li starred in the 1995 film &quot;High Risk&quot;, where Li plays a Captain who becomes disillusioned after his wife is murdered by crime lords. Along the way, he pairs up with a wacky sell-out actor, Frankie (played by Jacky Cheung), and proceeds to engage in a series of violent battles in a high-rise building. The setting is similar to that of &quot;Die Hard&quot; and both their Chinese film titles. This movie is notable in that director Wong Jing had such a terrible experience working with Jackie Chan in Jing&#x27;s previous film &quot;City Hunter&quot; that he chose to make Cheung&#x27;s character a biting satire of Chan. Li would later publicly apologise to Chan for taking part in it.

Li had two wuxia feature films released in 2011, &quot;The Sorcerer and the White Snake&quot; and &quot;Flying Swords of Dragon Gate&quot;; the latter was helmed by Tsui Hark.

To promote tai chi, in 2012, Li starred in a film titled &quot;Tai Chi&quot; and co-produced the movie with Chen Kuo-Fu. Li portrayed tai chi master Yang Luchan.

=== American/Western films ===

In 1998, he made his international film debut in &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot; which also marked the first time he had ever played a villain in a film. He agreed to do &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot; after the producer Joel Silver promised to give him the leading role in his next film, &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot; (2000), alongside singer Aaliyah. The film became a box office hit. Though Li spoke very little English at the time of production, his performance as Chinese mafia hitman Wah Sing Ku was praised.

Li turned down Chow Yun-fat&#x27;s role in &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; (2000) because he promised his wife that he would not make any films during her pregnancy. He also turned down the role of Seraph in &quot;The Matrix&quot; trilogy, based on his belief that the role was not one which required his skills and that the films were iconic and stunning enough without adding his name to the cast list. Li was also cast as Kato in &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; when the film was still in development in 2000. In 2001, it was moved to another studio. When the film was moved on again and released in 2011, the role of Kato was portrayed by Jay Chou.

In 2001, he appeared in two more films: &quot;The One&quot;, which was the first of his films with Jason Statham, and &quot;Kiss of the Dragon&quot; opposite Bridget Fonda which did moderately well at the box office. In July 2001, Li agreed to produce and star in an action film with Jackie Chan which was to be released in 2002 or 2003, but no further news of their collaboration surfaced until 2006. In 2002, the period martial arts epic film &quot;Hero&quot; was released in the Chinese market. This film was both a commercial and critical success and became the highest-grossing motion picture in Chinese film history at the time. In 2003 he reunited with producer Joel Silver for the action thriller film &quot;Cradle 2 the Grave&quot; where he starred alongside rapper DMX and fellow martial artist Mark Dacascos. In 2004, Li lent his likeness, voice and provided motion capture work for the video game &quot;Jet Li: Rise to Honor&quot;.

Li was presented the Visionary Award by East West Players, the oldest Asian American theatre in the United States, in 2002 by contemporary John Woo. The award recognizes &quot;artists who have raised the visibility of the Asian Pacific American community through theater, film and television.&quot; He delivered his acceptance speech in his native language of Mandarin.

Li took on a more serious role in the 2005 film, &quot;Unleashed&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Danny the Dog&quot;), where he portrayed an adult with the mentality of a child who has been raised like an animal. Although his martial arts skills were used extensively, it was a somber film with more depth than had been previously seen in Li&#x27;s films, and co-starred dramatic actors Bob Hoskins and Morgan Freeman.

In 2006, the martial arts film epic &quot;Fearless&quot;, was released worldwide. Although he will continue to make martial arts films, &quot;Fearless&quot; is his last wushu martial arts film. In &quot;Fearless&quot;, he played Huo Yuanjia, the real-life founder of Chin Woo Athletic Association, who reportedly defeated foreign boxers and Japanese martial artists in publicised events at a time when China&#x27;s power was seen as eroding. Together with the film &quot;Fist of Legend&quot;, Li has portrayed both Chen Jun, the student and avenger of Huo Yuanjia (a.k.a. Fok Yun Gap), as well as Huo Yuanjia himself. &quot;Fearless&quot; was released on 26 January 2006 in Hong Kong, followed by a 22 September 2006 release in the United States where it reached second place in its first weekend.

Li has stated in an interview with the &quot;Shenzhen Daily&quot; newspaper that this will be his last martial arts epic, which is also stated in the film&#x27;s television promotions. However, he plans to continue his film career in other genres. Specifically, he plans to continue acting in epic action and martial arts films dealing more with religious and philosophical issues.

Li&#x27;s 2007 Hollywood film, &quot;War&quot;, was released in August of that year, and re-teamed him with actor Jason Statham, who previously starred with him in &quot;The One&quot;, and action choreographer Corey Yuen. &quot;War&quot; raked in a disappointing at the box office, becoming one of Li&#x27;s lowest grossers in America; however, it was a hit on video, accumulating nearly in rental revenue, more than doubling its box office take. With the exception of &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot; and the worldwide release of &quot;Hero&quot;, most of Li&#x27;s American/Western films have been only modest hits like &quot;Kiss of the Dragon&quot;, &quot;The One&quot;, &quot;Unleashed&quot;, &quot;Cradle 2 the Grave&quot;, and the worldwide release of &quot;Fearless&quot;.

Li was appointed by the Chinese Wushu Association as the &quot;Image Ambassador of Wushu&quot; (or IWUF ambassador) at the 2007 World Wushu Championships in Beijing. In late 2007, Li returned again to China to participate in the China/Hong Kong co-production of the period war film &quot;The Warlords&quot; with Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro. This film, with its focus on dramatics rather than martial arts, netted Li the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor.

Li and fellow martial arts veteran Jackie Chan finally appeared together onscreen for the first time in &quot;The Forbidden Kingdom&quot;, which began filming in May 2007 and was released to critical and commercial success on 18 April 2008. The film was based on the legend of the Monkey King from the Chinese folk novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. Li also starred as the lead villain Emperor Han in the fantasy action film &quot;The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor&quot; with actors Brendan Fraser, Isabella Leong and Michelle Yeoh.

In 2009, he launched his own fitness program, Wuji—which consists of elements of martial arts, yoga and pilates—and Adidas launched a special clothing line for it that bears the initials of &quot;JL&quot;. After a one-year hiatus from filmmaking, Li returned to acting in 2010, portraying a mercenary in the film &quot;The Expendables&quot;, teaming up with action stars Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Mickey Rourke, Eric Roberts, Steve Austin, Terry Crews, and Randy Couture. It was the third time he had teamed up with Statham. In 2012, he reprised his role briefly in the sequel &quot;The Expendables 2&quot; and returned for the third film &quot;The Expendables 3&quot; in 2014. Li was initially stated to be appearing with Vin Diesel in &quot;&quot;, but according to a Facebook post by Diesel, Li was replaced by Donnie Yen.

Li plays the Emperor of China for the 2020 live action movie, &quot;Mulan&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 1987, Li married Huang Qiuyan, his Beijing Wushu Team fellow member and &quot;Kids From Shaolin&quot; co-star. They have two daughters, Si and Taimi. He met actress Nina Li Chi during the filming of &quot;Dragon Fight&quot; (1989) and divorced Huang in 1990. In 1999, Li married Nina at his villa in Arcadia, California, which he owned from 1998 to 2004. The couple have two daughters, Jane (born 2000) and Jada (born 2002).

In 1997, Li obtained US citizenship, which he renounced in April 2009. In July 2009, Amy Zhou Weiyan, then executive chairperson of the One Foundation, confirmed that Li had become a Singaporean citizen. In 2011, Li confirmed his Singaporean citizenship. 

In 1998, Li converted to Tibetan Buddhism when he was promoting &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot; in Taiwan. His master is Lho Kunsang.

In 2013, Li revealed that he suffers from hyperthyroidism and had been dealing with the issue for the past three years. In 2016, Li stated that he was accepting fewer film offers due to his charity work rather than his illness, from which he had recovered.

Li likes to play badminton and table tennis, ride his bicycle, read and meditate in his free time. He collects rare Tibetan beads.

== Views on life and martial arts ==

Li, as a Buddhist, believes that the difficulties of everyday life can be overcome with the help of religious philosophies. He thinks that fame is not something he can control; therefore, he does not care about it.

According to Li, everything he has ever wanted to tell the world can be found in three of his films: the message of &quot;Hero&quot; is that the suffering of one person can never be as significant as the suffering of a nation; &quot;Unleashed&quot; shows that violence is never a solution; and &quot;Fearless&quot; tells that the biggest enemy of a person is himself. Li thinks that the greatest weapon is a smile and the largest power is love.

About Wushu, he said that he believes the essence of martial arts is not power or speed but inner harmony, and considers it a sad development that today&#x27;s Wushu championships place greater emphasis on form than on the essence of being a martial artist. He believes Wushu now lacks individuality and competitors move like machines, whereas according to his views Wushu should not be considered a race where the fastest athlete wins. He would like to see Wushu as a form of art, where artists have a distinctive style. Li blames the new competition rules that, according to him, place limitations on martial artists.

Li believes that Wushu is not primarily for self-defense and instead of trying to play the hero people should think about peaceful resolutions of conflicts and call the police if necessary: &quot;A gun outdoes years of martial arts training in a split second. Like I&#x27;ve said many times before, it is important to differentiate between movies and reality. The hero in movies may be able to knock the gun off his opponent and save the day, but in real life – probably that is not the case.&quot; He has also stated that he has never had to use his martial arts skills in a real-life fight and he does not wish to, either.

=== Taiji Zen ===
In 2011, Li founded Taiji Zen, along with co-founder Executive chairman Jack Ma. Taiji Zen combined the martial art of tai chi (&quot;taijiquan&quot; in Chinese) with practices such as meditation. It packaged these into several different classes and online programs.

=== Philanthropy ===

Li has been a &quot;philanthropic ambassador&quot; of the Red Cross Society of China since January 2006. He contributed 500,000 yuan () of box office revenues from his film &quot;Fearless&quot; to the Red Cross&#x27; psychological sunshine project, which promotes mental health.

In April 2007, touched by his life-shaking experience in the Maldives when he was close to dying during the 2004 tsunami, Li formed his own non-profit foundation called One Foundation. The One Foundation supports international disaster relief efforts in conjunction with the Red Cross as well as other efforts, including mental health awareness and suicide prevention. Since the starting of the foundation, Li has been involved with recovery efforts in seven disasters, including the 2008 Sichuan earthquake and Typhoon Morakot in Taiwan. In the 2013 Lushan earthquake in Ya&#x27;an, Sichuan, Li and other members of the entertainment sector were the first to appeal for donations of money, goods and materials to help the victims of the disaster. Wu Jing was a One Foundation volunteer and helped in the effort.

Li discussed his commitment to philanthropy in an interview with the December 2009 issue of &quot;Alliance&quot; magazine, stating that &quot;grassroots non-government organizations can help the government in its blind spots. Government relief is not always detail-oriented. Grassroots NGOs can&#x27;t be as big as a government effort, but they need to be flexible and independent.&quot;

In September 2010, he was appointed by the International Red Cross as the first Good Will Ambassador. He posted online, saying: &quot;Today I signed a deal with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies – IFRC – to become the FIRST goodwill ambassador in the history of this humanitarian organization. I am very honored! At the same time, I will not pause to celebrate, but instead keep pushing forward and do my best to help the world! Thank you all once again for your support and belief in me!&quot;

It was also announced in September 2010, when Li was attending his wax unveiling ceremony in Hong Kong Madame Tussauds, that Li would be meeting Bill Gates and Warren Buffett to talk about charity work. &quot;Three days ago, I received an email from Gates, hoping I could make time because he and Buffett hoped I could go for a 30-minute chat before the dinner about the future we face as human beings, so I will go,&quot; Li said.

== Filmography ==

<text>Jianghu () is a Chinese term that generally refers to the social environment in which many Chinese &quot;wuxia&quot;, &quot;xianxia&quot;, and &quot;gong&#x27;an&quot; stories are set. The term is used flexibly, and can be used to describe a fictionalized version of rural historical China (usually using loose influences from across the ~1000 BC–280 AD period); a setting of feuding martial arts clans and the people of that community; a secret and possibly criminal underworld; a general sense of the &quot;mythic world&quot; where fantastical stories happen; or some combination thereof. A closely related term, &quot;wulin&quot; (武林; wǔlín; &#x27;martial forest&#x27;), refers exclusively to the community of martial artists that inhabit a &quot;jianghu&quot; setting. The term &quot;wulin&quot; has been borrowed into Korean as &quot;murim&quot; (무림) to refer to fiction set in Chinese-inspired martial arts worlds.

== Etymology ==
The original meaning of &quot;jianghu&quot; comes from &quot;river&quot; () and &quot;lake&quot; (), which might have originally referred to the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake (or Lake Tai), and in a wider sense refers to the wilderness and rural areas in general. These regions are usually overseen by local gentries (if there are any) at best, and are outside the direct administrative capacity of local magistrates and law enforcement, and thus are seen by many (particularly outlaws) as a &quot;free world&quot; where anyone can hide and anything can be done.

== Background ==
In modern Chinese culture, &quot;jianghu&quot; is commonly accepted as an alternative universe coexisting with the actual historical one in which the context of the wuxia genre was set. Unlike the normal world, in the &quot;jianghu&quot;, the &quot;youxia&quot; (wanderers or knights-errant) are free to act on their own initiative, including with violence, to punish evil and foes, and to reward goodness and allies. While the term literally means &quot;rivers and lakes&quot;, it is broader than that: roads, inns, bandit lairs, deserted temples, and the wilderness are all classic places associated with the &quot;jianghu&quot;, places far from government interference. Vigilantism is normal and accepted in a way that would be impermissible in a more realistic setting. Different wuxia novels have their own versions of the &quot;jianghu&quot; and its implications. Authors vary on whether they have one consistent setting or reinvent the &quot;jianghu&quot; in each work; Jin Yong&#x27;s &quot;Condor Trilogy&quot; has one continuity, whereas Gu Long&#x27;s &quot;jianghu&quot; would be distinct in every novel, for two examples.

One of the most notable sources for helping define what would be thought of as the &quot;jianghu&quot; was the 14th-century novel &quot;Water Margin&quot;. In the novel, a band of noble outlaws, who mounted regular sorties in an attempt to right the wrongs of corrupt officials, have retreated to their hideout. These outlaws were called the &quot;Chivalrous men of the Green Forests&quot; () and they then proceed to have various adventures, mixing heroism with more roguish activities.

One of the earliest coinage of &quot;jianghu&quot; was by a dejected Song dynasty poet Fan Zhongyan (989—1052) in his poem &quot;Yueyang Lou Ji&quot;, in which the context of &quot;jianghu&quot; was set out as distant to the courts and temples, meaning a world in its own right.

== Evolving interpretations of the term &quot;jianghu&quot; ==
The meaning of the term &quot;jianghu&quot; has evolved over the course of Chinese history, but usually refers to the martial arts world of ancient China. First coined by Zhuangzi in the late 4th century BC, it referred to a way of life different from that of being actively involved in politics. At the time, it referred to the way of life of underachieving or maligned scholar-officials who distanced themselves from the circles of political power. In this sense, &quot;jianghu&quot; could be loosely interpreted as the way of life of a hermit.

Over the centuries, &quot;jianghu&quot; gained greater acceptance among the common people and gradually became a term for a sub-society parallel to, and sometimes orthogonal to, mainstream society. This sub-society initially included merchants, craftsmen, beggars and vagabonds, but over time it assimilated bandits, outlaws and gangs who lived &quot;outside the existing law&quot;. During the Song and Yuan dynasties, bards and novelists began using the term &quot;jianghu&quot; in the process of creating literature covering a fictional society of adventurers and rebels who lived not by existing societal laws, but by their own moral principles or extralegal code of conduct. The core of these moral principles encompassed &quot;xia&quot; (), &quot;yi&quot; (), &quot;li&quot; (), &quot;zhong&quot; () and &quot;chou&quot; (). Stories in this genre bloomed and enriched various interpretations of &quot;jianghu&quot;. At the same time, the term &quot;jianghu&quot; also developed intricate interconnections with gang culture because of outlaws&#x27; mutually shared distaste towards governments.

The inclusion of martial arts as a feature of &quot;jianghu&quot; was a recent development in the early 20th century. Novelists started creating a fantasy world of &quot;jianghu&quot; in which characters are martial artists and in which the characters&#x27; enforcement of righteousness is symbolised by conflicts between different martial artists or martial arts schools and the ultimate triumph of good over evil. Martial arts became a tool used by characters in a &quot;jianghu&quot; story to enforce their moral beliefs. On the other hand, there are characters who become corrupted by power derived from their formidable prowess in martial arts and end up abandoning their morality in their pursuit of power. Around this time, the term &quot;jianghu&quot; became closely related to a similar term, &quot;wulin&quot; (), which referred exclusively to a community of martial artists. This fantasy world of &quot;jianghu&quot; remains as the mainstream definition of &quot;jianghu&quot; in modern Chinese popular culture, particularly wuxia culture.

=== Current interpretations of the term &quot;jianghu&quot; ===
In more martial arts-centered stories, a common aspect of &quot;jianghu&quot; is that the courts of law are dysfunctional and that all disputes and differences (within the community) can only be resolved by members of the community, through the use of mediation, negotiation, or force, predicating the need for the code of &quot;xia&quot; and acts of chivalry. Law and order within the &quot;jianghu&quot; are maintained by the various orthodox and righteous schools and heroes. Sometimes these schools may gather to form an alliance against a common foe or organization.

A leader, called the &quot;wulin mengzhu&quot; (), is elected from among the schools in order to lead them and ensure law and order within the &quot;jianghu&quot;. The leader is usually someone with a high level of mastery in martial arts and a great reputation for righteousness who is often involved in some conspiracy and/or killed. In some stories, the leader may not be the greatest martial artist in the &quot;jianghu&quot;; in other stories, the position of the leader is hereditary. The leader is an arbiter who presides and adjudicates over all inequities and disputes. The leader is a &quot;de jure&quot; chief justice of the affairs of the &quot;jianghu&quot;.

== Relationship with the government ==
Members of the &quot;jianghu&quot; are also expected to keep their distance from any government offices or officials, without necessarily being antagonistic. It was acceptable for &quot;jianghu&quot; members who were respectable members of society (usually gentries owning properties or big businesses) to maintain respectful but formal and passive relationships with the officials, such as paying due taxes and attending local community events. Even then, they are expected to shield any fugitives from the law, or at the least not to turn over fugitives to the officials. Local officials who are savvier would know better than to expect co-operation from &quot;jianghu&quot; members and would refrain from seeking help except to apprehend the worst and most notorious criminals. If the crimes also violated some of the moral tenets of &quot;jianghu&quot;, &quot;jianghu&quot; members may assist the government officials.

An interesting aspect is that while senior officials are kept at a distance, &quot;jianghu&quot; members may freely associate with low-ranking staff such as runners, jailers, or clerks of the magistrates. The &quot;jianghu&quot; members maintained order among their own in the community and prevented any major disturbance, thus saving a lot of work for their associates in the &quot;yamen&quot;. In return, the runners turn a blind eye to certain &quot;jianghu&quot; activities that are officially disapproved, the jailers ensure incarcerated &quot;jianghu&quot; members are not mistreated, and the clerks pass on useful tips to the &quot;jianghu&quot; community. This reciprocal arrangement allowed their superiors to maintain order in their jurisdiction with the limited resources available and &quot;jianghu&quot; members greater freedom.

== Norms of the &quot;jianghu&quot; ==
Although many &quot;jianghu&quot; members were Confucian-educated, their attitudes towards the way of life in the &quot;jianghu&quot; are largely overshadowed by pragmatism. In other words, they feel that Confucian values are to be respected and upheld if they are useful, and to be discarded if they are a hindrance.

The basic (spoken and unspoken) norms of the &quot;jianghu&quot; are:
# No using of dirty tricks such as eye-gouging during fights unless one has a personal feud with the opponent.
# Personal feuds do not extend to family members.
# Always show respect for seniors and elders according to their status or age.
# Complete obedience to one&#x27;s &quot;shifu&quot; (martial arts master).
# No learning of martial arts from another person without prior permission from one&#x27;s &quot;shifu&quot;.
# No using of martial arts against those who are not trained in martial arts.
# No violating of women.
# No sexual relationships with the wives of friends.
# One&#x27;s word is one&#x27;s bond.

== Usage in modern times ==
The term &quot;jianghu&quot; is linked to cultures other than those pertaining to martial arts in wuxia stories. It is also applied to anarchic societies. For instance, the triads and other Chinese secret societies use the term &quot;jianghu&quot; to describe their world of organised crime. Sometimes, the term &quot;jianghu&quot; may be replaced by the term &quot;underworld&quot; &quot;à la&quot; &quot;criminal underworld&quot;.

In modern terminology, &quot;jianghu&quot; may mean any circle of interest, ranging from the entertainment industry to sports to even politics and the business circle. Colloquially, retirement is also referred to as &quot;leaving the &quot;jianghu&quot;&quot; (). In &quot;wuxia&quot; stories, when reputable figures decide to retire from the &quot;jianghu&quot;, they will do so in a ceremony known as &quot;washing hands in the golden basin&quot; (): they wash their hands in a golden basin filled with water, signifying that they will no longer be involved in the affairs of the &quot;jianghu&quot;. When reclusive figures retired from the &quot;jianghu&quot; reappear, their return is described as &quot;re-entering the &quot;jianghu&quot;&quot; (). Another common expression to describe the disappointment, frustration and involuntariness one might have experienced during everyday work goes as &quot;[when] one is in the &quot;jianghu&quot;, his body (i.e. action) is not up to himself (人在江湖，身不由己)&quot;.

<text>Jacopo Amigoni (c. 1685 – September 1752), also named Giacomo Amiconi, was an Italian painter of the late-Baroque or Rococo period, who began his career in Venice, but traveled and was prolific throughout Europe, where his sumptuous portraits were much in demand.

==Biography==
He was born in Naples. Amigoni initially painted both mythological and religious scenes; but as the panoply of his patrons expanded northward, he began producing many parlour works depicting gods in sensuous languor or games. His style influenced Giuseppe Nogari. Among his pupils were Charles Joseph Flipart, Michelangelo Morlaiter, Pietro Antonio Novelli, Joseph Wagner, and Antonio Zucchi.

Starting in 1717, he is documented as working in Bavaria in the Castle of Nymphenburg (1719); in the castle of Schleissheim (1725–1729); and in the Benedictine abbey of Ottobeuren. He returned to Venice in 1726. His &quot;Arraignment of Paris&quot; hangs in the Villa Pisani at Stra. From 1730 to 1739 he worked in England, in Pown House, Moor Park Wolterton Hall and in the theatre of Covent Garden. From there, he helped convince Canaletto to travel to England by telling him of the ample patronage available.

In London or during a trip to Paris in 1736, he met the celebrated castrato Farinelli, whose portrait he painted twice in 1735 and again in 1752. Amigoni also encountered the painting of François Lemoyne and François Boucher.

In 1739 he returned to Italy, perhaps to Naples and surely to Montecassino, in whose Abbey existed two canvases (destroyed during World War II). He travelled to Venice to paint for Sigismund Streit, for the Casa Savoia and other buildings of the city.

In 1747 he left Italy for Madrid, encouraged by Farinelli, who held a court appointment there. He became court painter to Ferdinand VI of Spain and director of the Royal Academy of Saint Fernando. He painted a group portrait that included himself, Farinelli, Metastasio, Teresa Castellini, and an unidentified young man. The young man may have been the Austrian Archduke Joseph, the Habsburg heir to the throne. Amigoni died in Madrid.

Amigoni was the father of the pastellist Caterina Amigoni Castellini, and the brother of the artist Carlotta Amigoni.

<doc id="16312" wikidata="Q148458" url="?curid=16312" title="Jean-François Millet">
<text>Jean-François Millet (; 4 October 1814 – 20 January 1875) was a French artist and one of the founders of the Barbizon school in rural France. Millet is noted for his paintings of peasant farmers and can be categorized as part of the Realism art movement. Toward the end of his career, he became increasingly interested in painting pure landscapes. He is known best for his oil paintings but is also noted for his pastels, Conté crayon drawings, and etchings.

==Life and work==

===Youth===

Millet was the first child of Jean-Louis-Nicolas and Aimée-Henriette-Adélaïde Henry Millet, members of the farming community in the village of Gruchy, in Gréville-Hague, Normandy, close to the coast. Under the guidance of two village priests—one of them was vicar Jean Lebrisseux—Millet acquired a knowledge of Latin and modern authors. But soon he had to help his father with the farm work, because Millet was the eldest of the sons. So all the farmer&#x27;s work was familiar to him: to mow, make hay, bind the sheaves, thresh, winnow, spread manure, plow, sow, etc. All these motifs returned in his later art.

In 1833, his father sent him to Cherbourg to study with a portrait painter named Bon Du Mouchel. By 1835 he was studying with Théophile Langlois de Chèvreville, a pupil of Baron Gros, in Cherbourg. A stipend provided by Langlois and others enabled Millet to move to Paris in 1837, where he studied at the with Paul Delaroche. In 1839, his scholarship was terminated, and his first submission to the Salon, &quot;Saint Anne Instructing the Virgin&quot;, was rejected by the jury.

===Paris===
After his first painting, a portrait, was accepted at the Salon of 1840, Millet returned to Cherbourg to begin a career as a portrait painter. The following year he married Pauline-Virginie Ono, and they moved to Paris. After rejections at the Salon of 1843 and Pauline&#x27;s death by consumption in April 1844, Millet returned again to Cherbourg. In 1845, Millet moved to Le Havre with Catherine Lemaire, whom he married in a civil ceremony in 1853; they had nine children and remained together for the rest of Millet&#x27;s life. In Le Havre he painted portraits and small genre pieces for several months, before moving back to Paris.

It was in Paris in the middle 1840s that Millet befriended Constant Troyon, Narcisse Diaz, Charles Jacque, and Théodore Rousseau, artists who, like Millet, became associated with the Barbizon school; Honoré Daumier, whose figure draftsmanship influenced Millet&#x27;s subsequent rendering of peasant subjects; and :fr:Alfred Sensier, a government bureaucrat who became a lifelong supporter and eventually the artist&#x27;s biographer. In 1847, his first Salon success came with the exhibition of a painting &quot;Oedipus Taken down from the Tree&quot;, and in 1848, his &quot;Winnower&quot; was bought by the government.

&quot;The Captivity of the Jews in Babylon&quot;, Millet&#x27;s most ambitious work at the time, was unveiled at the Salon of 1848, but was scorned by art critics and the public alike. The painting eventually disappeared shortly thereafter, leading historians to believe that Millet destroyed it. In 1984, scientists at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston x-rayed Millet&#x27;s 1870 painting &quot;The Young Shepherdess&quot; looking for minor changes, and discovered that it was painted over &quot;Captivity&quot;. It is now believed that Millet reused the canvas when materials were in short supply during the Franco-Prussian War.

===Barbizon===
In 1849, Millet painted &quot;Harvesters&quot;, a commission for the state. In the Salon of that year, he exhibited &quot;Shepherdess Sitting at the Edge of the Forest&quot;, a very small oil painting which marked a turning away from previous idealized pastoral subjects, in favor of a more realistic and personal approach. In June of that year, he settled in Barbizon with Catherine and their children.
In 1850, Millet entered into an arrangement with Sensier, who provided the artist with materials and money in return for drawings and paintings, while Millet simultaneously was free to continue selling work to other buyers as well. At that year&#x27;s Salon, he exhibited &quot;Haymakers&quot; and &quot;The Sower&quot;, his first major masterpiece and the earliest of the iconic trio of paintings that included &quot;The Gleaners&quot; and &quot;The Angelus&quot;.

From 1850 to 1853, Millet worked on &quot;Harvesters Resting (Ruth and Boaz)&quot;, a painting he considered his most important, and on which he worked the longest. Conceived to rival his heroes Michelangelo and Poussin, it was also the painting that marked his transition from the depiction of symbolic imagery of peasant life to that of contemporary social conditions. It was the only painting he ever dated, and was the first work to garner him official recognition, a second-class medal at the 1853 salon.

In the mid-1850s, Millet produced a small number of etchings of peasant subjects, such as &quot;Man with a Wheelbarrow&quot; (1855) and &quot;Woman Carding Wool&quot; (1855–1857).

====&quot;The Gleaners&quot;====
This is one of the most well known of Millet&#x27;s paintings, &quot;The Gleaners&quot; (1857). While Millet was walking the fields around Barbizon, one theme returned to his pencil and brush for seven years—gleaning—the centuries-old right of poor women and children to remove the bits of grain left in the fields following the harvest. He found the theme an eternal one, linked to stories from the Old Testament. In 1857, he submitted the painting &quot;The Gleaners&quot; to the Salon to an unenthusiastic, even hostile, public.

(Earlier versions include a vertical composition painted in 1854, an etching of 1855–56 which directly presaged the horizontal format of the painting now in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay.)

A warm golden light suggests something sacred and eternal in this daily scene where the struggle to survive takes place. During his years of preparatory studies, Millet contemplated how best to convey the sense of repetition and fatigue in the peasants&#x27; daily lives. Lines traced over each woman&#x27;s back lead to the ground and then back up in a repetitive motion identical to their unending, backbreaking labor. Along the horizon, the setting sun silhouettes the farm with its abundant stacks of grain, in contrast to the large shadowy figures in the foreground. The dark homespun dresses of the gleaners cut robust forms against the golden field, giving each woman a noble, monumental strength.

====&quot;The Angelus&quot;====

The painting was commissioned by Thomas Gold Appleton, an American art collector based in Boston, Massachusetts. Appleton previously studied with Millet&#x27;s friend, the Barbizon painter Constant Troyon. It was completed during the summer of 1857. Millet added a steeple and changed the initial title of the work, &quot;Prayer for the Potato Crop&quot; to &quot;The Angelus&quot; when the purchaser failed to take possession of it in 1859. Displayed to the public for the first time in 1865, the painting changed hands several times, increasing only modestly in value, since some considered the artist&#x27;s political sympathies suspect. Upon Millet&#x27;s death a decade later, a bidding war between the US and France ensued, ending some years later with a price tag of 800,000 gold francs.

The disparity between the apparent value of the painting and the poor estate of Millet&#x27;s surviving family was a major impetus in the invention of the , intended to compensate artists or their heirs when works are resold.

===Later years===


Despite mixed reviews of the paintings he exhibited at the Salon, Millet&#x27;s reputation and success grew throughout the 1860s. At the beginning of the decade, he contracted to paint 25 works in return for a monthly stipend for the next three years and in 1865, another patron, Emile Gavet, began commissioning pastels for a collection that eventually included 90 works. In 1867, the Exposition Universelle hosted a major showing of his work, with the &quot;Gleaners&quot;, &quot;Angelus&quot;, and &quot;Potato Planters&quot; among the paintings exhibited. The following year, Frédéric Hartmann commissioned &quot;Four Seasons&quot; for 25,000 francs, and Millet was named Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur.

In 1870, Millet was elected to the Salon jury. Later that year, he and his family fled the Franco-Prussian War, moving to Cherbourg and Gréville, and did not return to Barbizon until late in 1871. His last years were marked by financial success and increased official recognition, but he was unable to fulfill government commissions due to failing health. On 3 January 1875, he married Catherine in a religious ceremony. Millet died on 20 January 1875.

==Legacy==

Millet was an important source of inspiration for Vincent van Gogh, particularly during his early period. Millet and his work are mentioned many times in Vincent&#x27;s letters to his brother Theo. Millet&#x27;s late landscapes served as influential points of reference to Claude Monet&#x27;s paintings of the coast of Normandy; his structural and symbolic content influenced Georges Seurat as well.

Millet is the main protagonist of Mark Twain&#x27;s play &quot;Is He Dead?&quot; (1898), in which he is depicted as a struggling young artist who fakes his death to score fame and fortune. Most of the details about Millet in the play are fictional.

Millet&#x27;s painting &quot;L&#x27;homme à la houe&quot; inspired the famous poem &quot;The Man With the Hoe&quot; (1898) by Edwin Markham. His paintings also served as the inspiration for American poet David Middleton&#x27;s collection &quot;The Habitual Peacefulness of Gruchy: Poems After Pictures by Jean-François Millet&quot; (2005).

The &quot;Angelus&quot; was reproduced frequently in the 19th and 20th centuries. Salvador Dalí was fascinated by this work, and wrote an analysis of it, &quot;The Tragic Myth of The Angelus of Millet&quot;. Rather than seeing it as a work of spiritual peace, Dalí believed it held messages of repressed sexual aggression. Dalí was also of the opinion that the two figures were praying over their buried child, rather than to the Angelus. Dalí was so insistent on this fact that eventually an X-ray was done of the canvas, confirming his suspicions: the painting contains a painted-over geometric shape strikingly similar to a coffin. However, it is unclear whether Millet changed his mind on the meaning of the painting, or even if the shape actually is a coffin.

<doc id="16313" wikidata="Q460124" url="?curid=16313" title="Jacques Callot">
<text>Jacques Callot (; – 1635) was a baroque printmaker and draftsman from the Duchy of Lorraine (an independent state on the north-eastern border of France, southwestern border of Germany and overlapping the southern Netherlands). He is an important person in the development of the old master print. He made more than 1,400 etchings that chronicled the life of his period, featuring soldiers, clowns, drunkards, Romani, beggars, as well as court life. He also etched many religious and military images, and many prints featured extensive landscapes in their background.

==Life and training==

Callot was born and died in Nancy, the capital of Lorraine, now in France. He came from an important family (his father was master of ceremonies at the court of the Duke), and he often describes himself as having noble status in the inscriptions to his prints. At the age of fifteen he was apprenticed to a goldsmith, but soon afterward travelled to Rome where he learned engraving from an expatriate Frenchman, Philippe Thomassin. He probably then studied etching with Antonio Tempesta in Florence, where he lived from 1612 to 1621. More than 2,000 preparatory drawings and studies for prints survive, but no paintings by him are known, and he probably never trained as a painter.

During his period in Florence he became an independent master, and worked often for the Medici court. After the death of Cosimo II de&#x27; Medici during 1621, he returned to Nancy where he lived for the rest of his life, visiting Paris and the Netherlands later during the decade. He was commissioned by the courts of Lorraine, France and Spain, and by publishers, mostly in Paris. Although he remained in Nancy, his prints were distributed widely through Europe; Rembrandt was a keen collector of them.

==Technical innovations: échoppe, new hard ground, stopping-out==

His technique was exceptional, and was helped by important technical advances he made. He developed the échoppe, a type of etching-needle with a slanting oval section at the end, which enabled etchers to create a swelling line, as engravers were able to do.

He also seems to have been responsible for an improved recipe for the etching ground that coated the plate and was removed to form the image, using lute-makers varnish rather than a wax-based formula. This enabled lines to be etched more deeply, prolonging the life of the plate in printing, and also greatly reducing the risk of &quot;foul-biting&quot;, such that acid gets through the ground to the plate where it is not intended to, producing spots or blotches on the image. Previously the risk of foul-biting had always been present, preventing an engraver from investing too much time on a single plate that risked being ruined by foul-biting. Now etchers could do the very detailed work that was previously the monopoly of engravers, and Callot made good use of the new possibilities.

He also made more extensive and sophisticated use of multiple &quot;stoppings-out&quot; than previous etchers had done. This is the technique of letting the acid dissolve lightly over the whole plate, then stopping-out those parts of the work which the artist wishes to keep shallow by covering them with ground before bathing the plate in acid again. He achieved unprecedented subtlety in effects of distance and light and shade by careful control of this process. Most of his prints were relatively small – as much as about six inches or 15 cm on their longest dimension.

One of his devotees, the Parisian Abraham Bosse spread Callot&#x27;s innovations all over Europe with the first published manual of etching, which was translated into Italian, Dutch, German and English.

==&quot;Miseries of War&quot;==
His most famous prints are his two series of prints each on &quot;the Miseries and Misfortunes of War&quot;. These are 18 prints published during 1633, and the earlier and incomplete &quot;Les Petites Misères&quot; – referring to their sizes, large and small (though even the large set are only about 8 x 13 cm). These images show soldiers pillaging and burning their way through towns, country and convents, before being variously arrested and executed by their superiors, lynched by peasants, or surviving to live as crippled beggars. At the end the generals are rewarded by their monarch. During 1633, the year the larger set was published, Lorraine had been invaded by the French during the Thirty Years&#x27; War and Callot&#x27;s artwork is still noted with Francisco Goya&#x27;s &quot;Los Desastres de la Guerra&quot; (&quot;The Disasters of War&quot;), which was influenced by Callot – (Goya owned a series of the prints), as among the most powerful artistic statements of the inhumanity of war.

==Grotesque Dwarves==
Callot&#x27;s series of &quot;Grotesque Dwarves&quot; were to inspire Derby porcelain and other companies to create pottery figures known as &quot;Mansion House Dwarves&quot; or &quot;Grotesque Dwarves&quot;. The former title comes from a father and son who were paid to wander around the Mansion House in London wearing oversized hats that contained advertisements.

<text>Joseph John Campbell (March 26, 1904 – October 30, 1987) was an American writer. He was a professor of literature at Sarah Lawrence College who worked in comparative mythology and comparative religion. His work covers many aspects of the human condition. Campbell&#x27;s best-known work is his book &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; (1949), in which he discusses his theory of the journey of the archetypal hero shared by world mythologies, termed the monomyth.

Since the publication of &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot;, Campbell&#x27;s theories have been applied by a wide variety of modern writers and artists. His philosophy has been summarized by his own often repeated phrase: &quot;Follow your bliss.&quot; He gained recognition in Hollywood when George Lucas credited Campbell&#x27;s work as influencing his &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga.

Campbell&#x27;s approach to folklore topics such as myth and his influence on popular culture has been the subject of criticism, especially from academic folklorists.

==Life==

===Background===
Joseph Campbell was born in White Plains, New York, on March 26, 1904, the elder son of hosiery importer and wholesaler Charles William Campbell, from Waltham, Massachusetts, and Josephine (née Lynch), from New York. Campbell was raised in an upper-middle-class Irish Catholic family; he related that his paternal grandfather Charles had been &quot;a peasant&quot; who came to Boston from County Mayo in Ireland, and became the gardener and caretaker at the Lyman Estate at Waltham, where his son Charles William Campbell grew up and became a successful salesman at a department store prior to establishing his hosiery business. During his childhood, he moved with his family to New Rochelle, New York. In 1919, a fire destroyed the family home in New Rochelle, killing his maternal grandmother and injuring his father, who tried to save her.

In 1921, Campbell graduated from the Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut. While at Dartmouth College he studied biology and mathematics, but decided that he preferred the humanities. He transferred to Columbia University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature in 1925 and a Master of Arts degree in medieval literature in 1927. At Dartmouth he had joined Delta Tau Delta. An accomplished athlete, he received awards in track and field events, and, for a time, was among the fastest half-mile runners in the world.

In 1924, Campbell traveled to Europe with his family. On the ship during his return trip he encountered the messiah elect of the Theosophical Society, Jiddu Krishnamurti; they discussed Indian philosophy, sparking in Campbell an interest in Hindu and Indian thought. In 1927, he received a fellowship from Columbia University to study in Europe. Campbell studied Old French, Provençal, and Sanskrit at the University of Paris and the University of Munich. He learned to read and speak French and German.

On his return to Columbia University in 1929, Campbell expressed a desire to pursue the study of Sanskrit and modern art in addition to medieval literature. Lacking faculty approval, Campbell withdrew from graduate studies. Later in life he jested that it is a sign of incompetence to have a PhD in the liberal arts, the discipline covering his work.

===The Great Depression===
With the arrival of the Great Depression, Campbell spent the next five years (1929–1934) living in a rented shack in Woodstock, New York. There, he contemplated the next course of his life while engaged in intensive and rigorous independent study. He later said that he &quot;would divide the day into four three-hour periods, of which I would be reading in three of the three-hour periods, and free one of them ... I would get nine hours of sheer reading done a day. And this went on for five years straight.&quot;

Campbell traveled to California for a year (1931–1932), continuing his independent studies and becoming a close friend of the budding writer John Steinbeck and his wife Carol. Campbell had met Carol&#x27;s sister, Idell, on a Honolulu cruise and she introduced him to the Steinbecks. Campbell had an affair with Carol. On the Monterey Peninsula, Campbell, like John Steinbeck, fell under the spell of the marine biologist Ed Ricketts (the model for &quot;Doc&quot; in Steinbeck&#x27;s novel &quot;Cannery Row&quot; as well as central characters in several other novels). Campbell lived for a while next door to Ricketts, participated in professional and social activities at his neighbor&#x27;s, and accompanied him, along with Xenia and Sasha Kashevaroff, on a 1932 journey to Juneau, Alaska on the &quot;Grampus&quot;. Campbell began writing a novel centered on Ricketts as a hero but, unlike Steinbeck, did not complete his book.

Bruce Robison writes that

Campbell continued his independent reading while teaching for a year in 1933 at the Canterbury School in Connecticut, during which time he also attempted to publish works of fiction. While teaching at the Canterbury School, Campbell sold his first short story &quot;Strictly Platonic&quot; to &quot;Liberty&quot; magazine.

===Sarah Lawrence College===
In 1934, Campbell accepted a position as Professor of Literature at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, New York. In 1938, he married one of his former students, the dancer-choreographer Jean Erdman. For most of their 49 years of marriage they shared a two-room apartment in Greenwich Village in New York City. In the 1980s they also purchased an apartment in Honolulu and divided their time between the two cities. They did not have any children.

Early in World War II, Campbell attended a lecture by the Indologist Heinrich Zimmer; the two men became good friends. After Zimmer&#x27;s death, Campbell was given the task of editing and posthumously publishing Zimmer&#x27;s papers, which he would do over the following decade.

In 1955–1956, as the last volume of Zimmer&#x27;s posthumous treatise, &quot;The Art of Indian Asia, Its Mythology and Transformations,&quot; was finally about to be published, Campbell took a sabbatical from Sarah Lawrence College and traveled, for the first time, to Asia. He spent six months in southern Asia (mostly India) and another six in East Asia (mostly Japan). This year had a profound influence on his thinking about Asian religion and myth, and also on the necessity for teaching comparative mythology to a larger, non-academic audience.

In 1972, Campbell retired from Sarah Lawrence College, after having taught there for 38 years.

===Later life and death===

Campbell attended a Grateful Dead concert in 1986, and marveled that &quot;Everyone has just lost themselves in everybody else here!&quot; With Grateful Dead, Campbell put on a conference called &quot;Ritual and Rapture from Dionysus to the Grateful Dead&quot;.

Campbell died at his home in Honolulu, Hawaii, on October 30, 1987, from complications of esophageal cancer. Before his death he had completed filming the series of interviews with Bill Moyers that aired the following spring as &quot;The Power of Myth&quot;. He is buried in O&#x27;ahu Cemetery, Honolulu.

==Influences==

===Art, literature, philosophy===

Campbell often referred to the work of modern writers James Joyce and Thomas Mann in his lectures and writings, as well as to the art of Pablo Picasso. He was introduced to their work during his stay as a graduate student in Paris. Campbell eventually corresponded with Mann.

The works of Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche had a profound effect on Campbell&#x27;s thinking; he quoted their writing frequently.

The &quot;follow your bliss&quot; philosophy attributed to Campbell following the original broadcast of &quot;The Power of Myth&quot; (see below) derives from the Hindu Upanishads; however, Campbell was possibly also influenced by the 1922 Sinclair Lewis novel &quot;Babbitt&quot;. In &quot;The Power of Myth,&quot; Campbell quotes from the novel:

===Psychology and anthropology===

The anthropologist Leo Frobenius and his disciple Adolf Ellegard Jensen were important to Campbell&#x27;s view of cultural history. Campbell was also influenced by the psychological work of Abraham Maslow and Stanislav Grof.

Campbell&#x27;s ideas regarding myth and its relation to the human psyche are dependent in part on the pioneering work of Sigmund Freud, but in particular on the work of Jung, whose studies of human psychology greatly influenced Campbell. Campbell&#x27;s conception of myth is closely related to the Jungian method of dream interpretation, which is heavily reliant on symbolic interpretation. Jung&#x27;s insights into archetypes were heavily influenced by the &quot;Bardo Thodol&quot; (also known as &quot;The Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot;). In his book &quot;The Mythic Image&quot;, Campbell quotes Jung&#x27;s statement about the &quot;Bardo Thodol&quot;, that it

==Comparative mythology and theories==
===Monomyth===

Campbell&#x27;s concept of &quot;monomyth&quot; (one myth) refers to the theory that sees all mythic narratives as variations of a single great story. The theory is based on the observation that a common pattern exists beneath the narrative elements of most great myths, regardless of their origin or time of creation. Campbell often referred to the ideas of Adolf Bastian and his distinction between what he called &quot;folk&quot; and &quot;elementary&quot; ideas, the latter referring to the prime matter of monomyth while the former to the multitude of local forms the myth takes in order to remain an up-to-date carrier of sacred meanings. The central pattern most studied by Campbell is often referred to as &quot;the hero&#x27;s journey&quot; and was first described in &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; (1949). An enthusiast of novelist James Joyce, Campbell borrowed the term &quot;monomyth&quot; from Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. Campbell also made heavy use of Carl Jung&#x27;s theories on the structure of the human psyche, and he often used terms such as anima, animus and ego consciousness.

As a strong believer in the psychic unity of mankind and its poetic expression through mythology, Campbell made use of the concept to express the idea that the whole of the human race can be seen as engaged in the effort of making the world &quot;transparent to transcendence&quot; by showing that underneath the world of phenomena lies an eternal source which is constantly pouring its energies into this world of time, suffering, and ultimately death. To achieve this task one needs to speak about things that existed before and beyond words, a seemingly impossible task, the solution to which lies in the metaphors found in myths. These metaphors are statements that point beyond themselves into the transcendent. The Hero&#x27;s Journey was the story of the man or woman who, through great suffering, reached an experience of the eternal source and returned with gifts powerful enough to set their society free.

As this story spread through space and evolved through time, it was broken down into various local forms (masks), depending on the social structures and environmental pressures that existed for the culture that interpreted it. The basic structure, however, has remained relatively unchanged and can be classified using the various stages of a hero&#x27;s adventure through the story, stages such as &quot;the Call to Adventure, Receiving Supernatural Aid, Meeting with the Goddess/Atonement with the Father&quot; and &quot;Return&quot;. These stages, as well as the symbols one encounters throughout the story, provide the necessary metaphors to express the spiritual truths the story is trying to convey. Metaphors for Campbell, in contrast with &quot;similes&quot; which make use of the word &quot;like&quot;, pretend to a literal interpretation of what they are referring to, as in the sentence &quot;Jesus is the Son of God&quot; rather than &quot;the relationship of man to God is &quot;like&quot; that of a son to a father&quot;.

In the 1987 documentary &quot;Joseph Campbell: A Hero&#x27;s Journey&quot;, he explains God in terms of a metaphor:

God is a metaphor for a mystery that absolutely transcends all human categories of thought, even the categories of being and non-being. Those are categories of thought. I mean it&#x27;s as simple as that. So it depends on how much you want to think about it. Whether it&#x27;s doing you any good. Whether it is putting you in touch with the mystery that&#x27;s the ground of your own being. If it isn&#x27;t, well, it&#x27;s a lie. So half the people in the world are religious people who think that their metaphors are facts. Those are what we call theists. The other half are people who know that the metaphors are not facts. And so, they&#x27;re lies. Those are the atheists.

===Functions of myth===
Campbell often described mythology as having a fourfold function within human society. These appear at the end of his work &quot;The Masks of God: Creative Mythology&quot;, as well as various lectures.

; The Mystical/Metaphysical Function: &quot;Awakening and maintaining in the individual a sense of awe and gratitude before the &#x27;mystery of being&#x27; and his or her participation in it&quot;
: According to Campbell, the absolute mystery of life, what he called transcendent reality, cannot be captured directly in words or images. Symbols and mythic metaphors on the other hand point outside themselves and into that reality. They are what Campbell called &quot;being statements&quot; and their enactment through ritual can give to the participant a sense of that ultimate mystery as an experience. &quot;Mythological symbols touch and exhilarate centers of life beyond the reach of reason and coercion... The first function of mythology is to reconcile waking consciousness to the &quot;mysterium tremendum et fascinans&quot; of this universe &quot;as it is&quot;.&quot;

; The Cosmological Function: &quot;Explaining the shape of the universe&quot;
: For pre-modern societies, myth also functioned as a &quot;proto-science&quot;, offering explanations for the physical phenomena that surrounded and affected their lives, such as the change of seasons and the life cycles of animals and plants.

; The Sociological Function: &quot;Validate and support the existing social order&quot;
: Ancient societies had to conform to an existing social order if they were to survive at all. This is because they evolved under &quot;pressure&quot; from necessities much more intense than the ones encountered in our modern world. Mythology confirmed that order and enforced it by reflecting it into the stories themselves, often describing how the order arrived from divine intervention. Campbell often referred to these &quot;conformity&quot; myths as the &quot;Right Hand Path&quot; to reflect the brain&#x27;s left hemisphere&#x27;s abilities for logic, order and linearity. Together with these myths however, he observed the existence of the &quot;Left Hand Path&quot;, mythic patterns like the &quot;Hero&#x27;s Journey&quot; which are revolutionary in character in that they demand from the individual a surpassing of social norms and sometimes even of morality.

; The Pedagogical/Psychological Function: &quot;Guide the individual through the stages of life&quot;
: As a person goes through life, many psychological challenges will be encountered. Myth may serve as a guide for successful passage through the stages of one&#x27;s life.

===Evolution of myth===
Campbell&#x27;s view of mythology was by no means static and his books describe in detail how mythologies evolved through time, reflecting the realities in which each society had to adjust. Various stages of cultural development have different yet identifiable mythological systems. In brief these are:

; The Way of the Animal Powers: &quot;Hunting and gathering societies&quot;
: At this stage of evolution, religion was animistic, as all of nature was seen as being infused with a spirit or divine presence. At center stage was the main hunting animal of that culture, whether the buffalo for Native Americans or the eland for South African tribes, and a large part of religion focused on dealing with the psychological tension that came from the reality of the necessity to kill versus the divinity of the animal. This was done by presenting the animals as springing from an eternal archetypal source and coming to this world as &quot;willing victims&quot;, with the understanding that their lives would be returned to the soil or to the Mother through a ritual of restoration. The act of slaughter then becomes a ritual where both parties, animal and mankind, are equal participants. In &quot;Mythos&quot; and &quot;The Power of Myth&quot;, Campbell recounts the story he calls &quot;The Buffalo&#x27;s Wife&quot; as told by the Blackfoot tribe of North America. The story tells of a time when the buffalos stopped coming to the hunting plains, leaving the tribe to starve. The chief&#x27;s daughter promises to marry the buffalo chief in return for their reappearance, but is eventually spared and taught the buffalo dance by the animals themselves, through which the spirits of their dead will return to their eternal life source. Indeed, Campbell taught that throughout history mankind has held a belief that all life comes from and returns to another dimension which transcends temporality, but which can be reached through ritual.

; The Way of the Seeded Earth: &quot;Early agrarian societies&quot;
: Beginning in the fertile grasslands of the Levant and the Fertile Crescent of Mesopotamia in the Bronze Age and moving to Europe, the practice of agriculture spread along with a new way of understanding mankind&#x27;s relationship to the world. At this time the earth was seen as the Mother, and the myths focused around Her life-giving powers. The plant and cultivation cycle was mirrored in religious rituals which often included human sacrifice, symbolic or literal. The main figures of this system were a female Great Goddess, Mother Earth, and her ever-dying and ever-resurrected son/consort, a male God. At this time the focus was to participate in the repetitive rhythm the world moved in expressed as the four seasons, the birth and death of crops and the phases of the moon. At the center of this motion was the Mother Goddess from whom all life springs and to whom all life returns. This often gave Her a dual aspect as both mother and destroyer.

; The Way of the Celestial Lights: &quot;The first high civilizations&quot;
: As the first agricultural societies evolved into the high civilisations of Mesopotamia and Babylonia, the observation of the stars inspired them with the idea that life on earth must also follow a similar mathematically predetermined pattern in which individual beings are but mere participants in an eternal cosmic play. The king was symbolised by the Sun with the golden crown as its main metaphor, while his court were the orbiting planets. The Mother Goddess remained, but her powers were now fixed within the rigid framework of a clockwork universe.
: However, two barbarian incursions changed that. As the Indo-European (Aryan) people descended from the north and the Semites swept up from the Arabian desert, they carried with them a male dominated mythology with a warrior god whose symbol was the thunder. As they conquered, mainly due to the superior technology of iron smithing, their mythology blended with and subjugated the previous system of the Earth Goddess. Many mythologies of the ancient world, such as those of Greece, India, and Persia, are a result of that fusion with gods retaining some of their original traits and character but now belonging to a single system. Figures such as Zeus and Indra are thunder gods who now interact with Demeter and Dionysus, whose ritual sacrifice and rebirth, bearing testament to his pre-Indo-European roots, were still enacted in classical Greece. But for the most part, the focus heavily shifted toward the masculine, with Zeus ascending the throne of the gods and Dionysus demoted to a mere demi-god.
: This demotion was very profound in the case of the biblical imagery where the female elements were marginalized to an extreme. Campbell believed that Eve and the snake that tempted her were once fertility gods worshipped in their own right, with the tree of knowledge being the Tree of Life. He also found significance in the biblical story of Cain and Abel, with Cain being a farmer whose agrarian offering is not accepted by God, while herder Abel&#x27;s animal sacrifice is. In the lecture series of Mythos, Campbell speaks of the Mysteries of Eleusis in Ancient Greece, where Demeter&#x27;s journey in the underworld was enacted for young men and women of the time. There he observed that wheat was presented as the ultimate mystery with wine being a symbol of Dionysus, much like in the Christian mysteries where bread and wine are considered to incarnate the body and blood of Jesus. Both religions carry the same &quot;seeded earth&quot; cosmology in different forms while retaining an image of the ever-dying, ever-resurrected God.

; The Way of Man: &quot;Medieval mythology, romantic love, and the birth of the modern spirit&quot;
: Campbell recognized that the poetic form of courtly love, carried through medieval Europe by the traveling troubadours, contained a complete mythology in its own right. In&quot; The Power of Myth&quot; as well as the &quot;Occidental Mythology&quot; volume of &quot;The Masks of God&quot;, Campbell describes the emergence of a new kind of erotic experience as a &quot;person to person&quot; affair, in contrast with the purely physical definition given to Eros in the ancient world and the communal agape found in the Christian religion. An archetypal story of this kind is the legend of Tristan and Isolde which, apart from its mystical function, shows the transition from an arranged-marriage society as practiced in the Middle Ages and sanctified by the church, into the form of marriage by &quot;falling in love&quot; with another person that we recognize today. So what essentially started from a mythological theme has since become a social reality, mainly due to a change in perception brought about by a new mythologyand represents a central foundational manifestation of Campbell&#x27;s overriding interpretive message, &quot;Follow your bliss.&quot;
: Campbell believed that in the modern world the function served by formal, traditional mythological systems has been taken on by individual creators such as artists and philosophers. In the works of some of his favorites, such as Thomas Mann, Pablo Picasso and James Joyce, he saw mythological themes that could serve the same life-giving purpose that mythology had once played. Accordingly, Campbell believed the religions of the world to be the various culturally influenced &quot;masks&quot; of the same fundamental, transcendent truths. All religions can bring one to an elevated awareness above and beyond a dualistic conception of reality, or idea of &quot;pairs of opposites&quot; such as being and non-being, or right and wrong. Indeed, he quotes from the Rigveda in the preface to &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot;: &quot;Truth is one, the sages speak of it by many names.&quot;

==Influence==
===Joseph Campbell Foundation===

In 1991, Campbell&#x27;s widow, choreographer Jean Erdman, worked with Campbell&#x27;s longtime friend and editor, Robert Walter, to create the Joseph Campbell Foundation.

Initiatives undertaken by the JCF include: &quot;The Collected Works of Joseph Campbell&quot;, a series of books and recordings that aims to pull together Campbell&#x27;s myriad-minded work; the Erdman Campbell Award; the Mythological RoundTables, a network of local groups around the globe that explore the subjects of comparative mythology, psychology, religion and culture; and the collection of Campbell&#x27;s library and papers housed at the OPUS Archives and Research Center.

===Film and television===
George Lucas was the first filmmaker to credit Campbell&#x27;s influence. Lucas stated, following the release of the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film in 1977, that its story was shaped, in part, by ideas described in &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; and other works of Campbell&#x27;s. The linkage between &quot;Star Wars&quot; and Campbell was further reinforced when later reprints of Campbell&#x27;s book used the image of Luke Skywalker on the cover. Lucas discusses this influence at great length in the authorized biography of Joseph Campbell, &quot;A Fire in the Mind&quot;:

It was not until after the completion of the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy in 1983, however, that Lucas met Campbell or heard any of his lectures. In 1984, Campbell gave a lecture at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, with Lucas in the audience, who was introduced through their mutual friend Barbara McClintock. A few years later, Lucas invited Campbell to watch the entire &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy at Skywalker Ranch, which Campbell called &quot;real art&quot;. This meeting led to the filming of the 1988 documentary &quot;The Power of Myth&quot; at Skywalker Ranch. In his interviews with Bill Moyers, Campbell discusses the way in which Lucas used &quot;The Hero&#x27;s Journey&quot; in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films (IV, V, and VI) to re-invent the mythology for the contemporary viewer. Moyers and Lucas filmed an interview 12 years later in 1999 called the &quot;Mythology of Star Wars with George Lucas &amp; Bill Moyers&quot; to further discuss the impact of Campbell&#x27;s work on Lucas&#x27; films. In addition, the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution sponsored an exhibit during the late 1990s called &quot;Star Wars: The Magic of Myth&quot;, which discussed the ways in which Campbell&#x27;s work shaped the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films.

Many filmmakers of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries have acknowledged the influence of Campbell&#x27;s work on their own craft. Christopher Vogler, a Hollywood screenwriter, created a seven-page company memo based on Campbell&#x27;s work, &quot;A Practical Guide to The Hero With a Thousand Faces&quot;, which led to the development of Disney&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;The Lion King&quot;. Among films that many viewers have recognized as closely following the pattern of the monomyth are &quot;The Matrix&quot; series, the Batman series and the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; series. Dan Harmon, the creator of the TV show &quot;Community&quot; and co-creator of the TV show &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;, often references Campbell as a major influence. According to him, he uses a &quot;story circle&quot; to formulate every story he writes, in a formulation of Campbell&#x27;s work. A fictionalized version of Campbell himself appears in the seventh episode of the sixth season of &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;, &quot;Full Meta Jackrick&quot;.

===Popular literature===
After the explosion of popularity brought on by the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films and &quot;The Power of Myth&quot;, creative artists in many media recognized the potential to use Campbell&#x27;s theories to try to unlock human responses to narrative patterns. Novelists, songwriters, video game designers have studied Campbell&#x27;s work in order to better understand mythology – in particular, the monomyth – and its impact.

The novelist Richard Adams acknowledges a debt to Campbell&#x27;s work and specifically to the concept of the monomyth. In his best known work, &quot;Watership Down&quot;, Adams uses extracts from &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; as chapter epigrams.

Dan Brown mentioned in a &quot;New York Times&quot; interview that Joseph Campbell&#x27;s works, particularly &quot;The Power of Myth&quot; and &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot;, inspired him to create the character of Robert Langdon.

===&quot;Follow your bliss&quot;===
One of Campbell&#x27;s most identifiable, most quoted and arguably most misunderstood sayings was his maxim to &quot;follow your bliss&quot;. He derived this idea from the Upanishads:
He saw this not merely as a mantra, but as a helpful guide to the individual along the hero journey that each of us walks through life:
Campbell began sharing this idea with students during his lectures in the 1970s. By the time that &quot;The Power of Myth&quot; was aired in 1988, six months following Campbell&#x27;s death, &quot;Follow your bliss&quot; was a philosophy that resonated deeply with the American publicboth religious and secular.

During his later years, when some students took him to be encouraging hedonism, Campbell is reported to have grumbled, &quot;I should have said, &#x27;Follow your &quot;blisters&quot;.

==Academic reception and criticism==
Campbell&#x27;s approach to myth, a genre of folklore, has been the subject of criticism from folklorists, academics who specialize in folklore studies. American folklorist Barre Toelken says that few psychologists have taken the time to become familiar with the complexities of folklore, and that, historically, Jung-influenced psychologists and authors have tended to build complex theories around single versions of a tale that support a theory or a proposal. To illustrate his point, Toelken employs Clarissa Pinkola Estés&#x27;s (1992) &quot;Women Who Run with the Wolves&quot;, citing its inaccurate representation of the folklore record, and Campbell&#x27;s &quot;monomyth&quot; approach as another. Regarding Campbell, Toelken writes, &quot;Campbell could construct a monomyth of the hero only by citing those stories that fit his preconceived mold, and leaving out equally valid stories… which did not fit the pattern&quot;. Toelken traces the influence of Campbell&#x27;s monomyth theory into other then-contemporary popular works, such as Robert Bly&#x27;s &quot;Iron John: A Book About Men&quot; (1990), which he says suffers from similar source selection bias.

Similarly, American folklorist Alan Dundes was highly critical of both Campbell&#x27;s approach to folklore, designating him as a &quot;non-expert&quot; and gives various examples of what he considers source bias in Campbell&#x27;s theories, as well as media representation of Campbell as an expert on the subject of myth in popular culture. Dundes writes, &quot;Folklorists have had some success in publicising the results of our efforts in the past two centuries such that members of other disciplines have, after a minimum of reading, believe they are qualified to speak authoritatively of folkloristic matters. It seems that the world is full of self-proclaimed experts in folklore, and a few, such as Campbell, have been accepted as such by the general public (and public television, in the case of Campbell)&quot;. According to Dundes, &quot;there is no single idea promulgated by amateurs that has done more harm to serious folklore study than the notion of archetype&quot;.

According to anthropologist Raymond Scupin, &quot;Joseph Campbell&#x27;s theories have not been well received in anthropology because of his overgeneralizations, as well as other problems.&quot;

Campbell&#x27;s Sanskrit scholarship has been questioned. Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, a former Sanskrit professor at the University of Toronto, said that he once met Campbell, and that the two &quot;hated each other at sight&quot;, commenting that, &quot;When I met Campbell at a public gathering he was quoting Sanskrit verses. He had no clue as to what he was talking about; he had the most superficial knowledge of India but he could use it for his own aggrandizement. I remember thinking: this man is corrupt. I know that he was simply &quot;lying&quot; about his understanding&quot;. According to Richard Buchen, librarian of the Joseph Campbell Collection at the Pacifica Graduate Institute, Campbell could not translate Sanskrit well, but worked closely with three scholars who did.

Ellwood observes that &quot;The Masks of God&quot; series &quot;impressed literate laity more than specialists&quot;; he quotes Stephen P. Dunn as remarking that in &quot;Occidental Mythology&quot; Campbell &quot;writes in a curiously archaic style – full of rhetorical questions, exclamations of wonder and delight, and expostulations directed at the reader, or perhaps at the author&#x27;s other self – which is charming about a third of the time and rather annoying the rest.&quot; Ellwood says that &quot;Campbell was not really a social scientist, and those in the latter camp could tell&quot; and records a concern about Campbell&#x27;s &quot;oversimplification of historical matters and tendency to make myth mean whatever he wanted it to mean&quot;. The critic Camille Paglia, writing in &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; (1990), expressed disagreement with Campbell&#x27;s &quot;negative critique of fifth-century Athens&quot; in &quot;Occidental Mythology&quot;, arguing that Campbell missed the &quot;visionary and exalted&quot; androgyny in Greek statues of nude boys. Paglia has written that while Campbell is &quot;a seminal figure for many American feminists&quot;, she loathes him for his &quot;mawkishness and bad research.&quot; Paglia has called Campbell &quot;mushy&quot; and a &quot;false teacher&quot;, and described his work as a &quot;fanciful, showy mishmash&quot;.

Campbell has also been accused of antisemitism by some authors. In &quot;Tikkun&quot; magazine, Tamar Frankiel noted that Campbell called Judaism the &quot;Yahweh Cult&quot; and that he spoke of Judaism in almost exclusively negative terms. In a 1989 &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; article, Brendan Gill accused Campbell of both antisemitism and prejudice against blacks. Gill&#x27;s article resulted in a series of letters to the editor, some supporting the charge of antisemitism and others defending him. However, according to Robert S. Ellwood, Gill relied on &quot;scraps of evidence, largely anecdotal&quot; to support his charges. In 1991, Masson also accused Campbell of &quot;hidden anti-Semitism&quot; and &quot;fascination with conservative, semifascistic views&quot;. Robert A. Segal&#x27;s &quot;Joseph Campbell on Jews and Judaism&quot; offers 70 references.

===Early collaborations===

The first published work that bore Campbell&#x27;s name was &quot;Where the Two Came to Their Father&quot; (1943), an account of a Navajo ceremony that was performed by singer (medicine man) Jeff King and recorded by artist and ethnologist Maud Oakes, recounting the story of two young heroes who go to the hogan of their father, the Sun, and return with the power to destroy the monsters that are plaguing their people. Campbell provided a commentary. He would use this tale through the rest of his career to illustrate both the universal symbols and structures of human myths and the particulars (&quot;folk ideas&quot;) of Native American stories.

As noted above, James Joyce was an important influence on Campbell. Campbell&#x27;s first important book (with Henry Morton Robinson), &quot;A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake&quot; (1944), is a critical analysis of Joyce&#x27;s final text &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. In addition, Campbell&#x27;s seminal work, &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; (1949), discusses what Campbell called the &quot;monomyth&quot; – the cycle of the journey of the hero – a term that he borrowed directly from Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;.

===&quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot;===

From his days in college through the 1940s, Joseph Campbell turned his hand to writing fiction. In many of his later stories (published in the posthumous collection &quot;Mythic Imagination&quot;) he began to explore the mythological themes that he was discussing in his Sarah Lawrence classes. These ideas turned him eventually from fiction to non-fiction.

Originally titled &quot;How to Read a Myth&quot;, and based on the introductory class on mythology that he had been teaching at Sarah Lawrence College, &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; was published in 1949 as Campbell&#x27;s first foray as a solo author; it established his name outside of scholarly circles and remains, arguably, his most influential work to this day. The book argues that hero stories such as Krishna, Buddha, Apollonius of Tyana, and Jesus all share a similar mythological basis. Not only did it introduce the concept of the hero&#x27;s journey to popular thinking, but it also began to popularize the very idea of comparative mythology itselfthe study of the human impulse to create stories and images that, though they are clothed in the motifs of a particular time and place, draw nonetheless on universal, eternal themes. Campbell asserted:

Wherever the poetry of myth is interpreted as biography, history, or science, it is killed. The living images become only remote facts of a distant time or sky. Furthermore, it is never difficult to demonstrate that as science and history, mythology is absurd. When a civilization begins to reinterpret its mythology in this way, the life goes out of it, temples become museums, and the link between the two perspectives becomes dissolved.

===&quot;The Masks of God&quot;===
Published between 1959 and 1968, Campbell&#x27;s four-volume work &quot;The Masks of God&quot; covers mythology from around the world, from ancient to modern. Where &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; focused on the commonality of mythology (the &quot;elementary ideas&quot;), the &quot; Masks of God&quot; books focus upon historical and cultural variations the monomyth takes on (the &quot;folk ideas&quot;). In other words, where &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; draws perhaps more from psychology, the &quot; Masks of God&quot; books draw more from anthropology and history. The four volumes of &quot;Masks of God&quot; are as follows: &quot;Primitive Mythology&quot;, &quot;Oriental Mythology&quot;, &quot;Occidental Mythology&quot;, and &quot;Creative Mythology&quot;.

===&quot;Historical Atlas of World Mythology&quot;===

At the time of his death, Campbell was in the midst of working on a large-format, lavishly illustrated series titled &quot;Historical Atlas of World Mythology&quot;. This series was to build on Campbell&#x27;s idea, first presented in &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot;, that myth evolves over time through four stages:

* &quot;The Way of the Animal Powers&quot;the myths of Paleolithic hunter-gatherers which focus on shamanism and animal totems.
* &quot;The Way of the Seeded Earth&quot;the myths of Neolithic, agrarian cultures which focus upon a mother goddess and associated fertility rites.
* &quot;The Way of the Celestial Lights&quot;the myths of Bronze Age city-states with pantheons of gods ruling from the heavens, led by a masculine god-king.
* &quot;The Way of Man&quot;religion and philosophy as it developed after the Axial Age (c. 6th century BCE), in which the mythic imagery of previous eras was made consciously metaphorical, reinterpreted as referring to psycho-spiritual, not literal-historical, matters. This transition is evident in the East in Buddhism, Vedanta, and philosophical Taoism; and in the West in the Mystery cults, Platonism, Christianity and Gnosticism.

Only the first volume was completed at the time of Campbell&#x27;s death. Campbell&#x27;s editor Robert Walter completed the publication of the first three of five parts of the second volume after Campbell&#x27;s death. The works are now out of print. , Joseph Campbell Foundation is currently undertaking to create a new, ebook edition.

===&quot;The Power of Myth&quot;===

Campbell&#x27;s widest popular recognition followed his collaboration with Bill Moyers on the PBS series &quot;The Power of Myth&quot;, which was first broadcast in 1988, the year following Campbell&#x27;s death. The series discusses mythological, religious, and psychological archetypes. A book, &quot;The Power of Myth&quot;, containing expanded transcripts of their conversations, was released shortly after the original broadcast.

===&quot;Collected Works&quot;===
The &quot;Collected Works of Joseph Campbell&quot; series is a project initiated by the Joseph Campbell Foundation to release new, authoritative editions of Campbell&#x27;s published and unpublished writing, as well as audio and video recordings of his lectures. Working with New World Library and Acorn Media UK, as well as publishing audio recordings and ebooks under its own banner, the project has produced over seventy-five titles. The series&#x27;s executive editor is Robert Walter, and the managing editor is David Kudler.

<text>John Dowland ( – buried 20 February 1626) was an English Renaissance composer, lutenist, and singer. He is best known today for his melancholy songs such as &quot;Come, heavy sleep&quot;, &quot;Come again&quot;, &quot;Flow my tears&quot;, &quot;I saw my Lady weepe&quot;, &quot;Now o now I needs must part&quot;, and &quot;In darkness let me dwell&quot;. His instrumental music has undergone a major revival, and with the 20th century&#x27;s early music revival, has been a continuing source of repertoire for lutenists and classical guitarists.

==Career and compositions==
Very little is known of Dowland&#x27;s early life, but it is generally thought he was born in London; some sources even put his birth year as 1563. Irish historian W. H. Grattan Flood claimed that he was born in Dalkey, near Dublin, but no corroborating evidence has been found either for that or for Thomas Fuller&#x27;s claim that he was born in Westminster. One piece of evidence points to Dublin as his place of origin: he dedicated the song &quot;From Silent Night&quot; to &#x27;my loving countryman Mr. John Forster the younger, merchant of Dublin in Ireland&#x27;. The Forsters were a prominent Dublin family at the time, providing several Lord Mayors to the city.

In 1580 Dowland went to Paris, where he was in service to Sir Henry Cobham, the ambassador to the French court, and his successor Sir Edward Stafford. He became a Roman Catholic at this time. Around 1584, Dowland moved back to England and married. In 1588 he was admitted Mus. Bac. from Christ Church, Oxford. In 1594 a vacancy for a lutenist came up at the English court, but Dowland&#x27;s application was unsuccessful. He claimed his religion led to his not being offered a post at Elizabeth I&#x27;s Protestant court, but his conversion was not publicised, and being Catholic did not prevent some other important musicians (such as William Byrd) from a court career.

From 1598 Dowland worked at the court of Christian IV of Denmark, though he continued to publish in London. King Christian was very interested in music and paid Dowland astronomical sums; his salary was 500 daler a year, making him one of the highest-paid servants of the Danish court. Though Dowland was highly regarded by King Christian, he was not the ideal servant, often overstaying his leave when he went to England on publishing business or for other reasons. Dowland was dismissed in 1606 and returned to England; in early 1612 he secured a post as one of James I&#x27;s lutenists. There are few compositions dating from the moment of his royal appointment until his death in London in 1626. While the date of his death is not known, &quot;Dowland&#x27;s last payment from the court was on 20 January 1626, and he was buried at St Ann&#x27;s, Blackfriars, London, on 20 February 1626.&quot;

Two major influences on Dowland&#x27;s music were popular consort songs and the dance music of the day. Most of Dowland&#x27;s music is for his own instrument, the lute. It includes several books of solo lute works, lute songs (for one voice and lute), part-songs with lute accompaniment, and several pieces for viol consort with lute. The poet Richard Barnfield wrote that Dowland&#x27;s &quot;heavenly touch upon the lute doth ravish human sense.&quot;

One of his better known works is the lute song &quot;Flow my tears&quot;, the first verse of which runs:

He later wrote what is probably his best known instrumental work, &quot;Lachrimae, or Seaven Teares, Figured in Seaven Passionate Pavans&quot;, a set of seven pavanes for five viols and lute, each based on the theme derived from the lute song &quot;Flow my tears&quot;. It became one of the best known collections of consort music in his time. His pavane &quot;Lachrymae antiquae&quot; was also popular in the 17th century, and was arranged and used as a theme for variations by many composers. He wrote a lute version of the popular ballad &quot;My Lord Willoughby&#x27;s Welcome Home&quot;.

Dowland&#x27;s music often displays a melancholia rare in music at that time, and he pioneered it together with Johann Froberger. He wrote a consort piece with the punning title &quot;Semper Dowland, semper dolens&quot; (always Dowland, always doleful), which may be said to sum up much of his work.

Richard Barnfield, Dowland&#x27;s contemporary, refers to him in poem VIII of &quot;The Passionate Pilgrim&quot; (1598), a Shakespearean sonnet:

==Published works==
Until 2024, only one comprehensive monograph of Dowland&#x27;s life and works, by Diana Poulton, was available in print. A more updated biography by K. Dawn Grapes was published in July 2024. The fullest catalog list of Dowland&#x27;s works is that compiled by K. Dawn Grapes in &quot;John Dowland: A Research and Information Guide&quot; (Routledge, 2019). The numbering for the lute pieces follow the same system as Diana Poulton created in her &quot;The Collected Lute Music of John Dowland&quot;. &quot;P&quot; numbers are therefore sometimes used to designate individual pieces. 

Many of Dowland&#x27;s works survive only in manuscript form.

=== &quot;Whole Book of Psalms&quot; (1592) ===
Published by Thomas Est in 1592, &quot;The Whole Booke of Psalmes&quot; contained works by 10 composers, including 6 pieces by Dowland.
# Put me not to rebuke, O Lord (Psalm 38)
# All people that on earth do dwell (Psalm 100)
# My soul praise the Lord (Psalm 104)
# Lord to thee I make my moan (Psalm 130)
# Behold and have regard (Psalm 134)
# A Prayer for the Queens most excellent Maiestie

=== &quot;New Book of Tablature&quot; (1596) ===
The &quot;New Booke of Tabliture&quot; was published by William Barley in 1596. It contains seven solo lute pieces by Dowland.

=== &quot;Lamentatio Henrici Noel&quot; (1596) ===
Perhaps written for the professional choir of Westminster Abbey.
# The Lamentation of a sinner
# Domine ne in furore (Psalm 6)
# Miserere mei Deus (Psalm 51)
# The humble sute of a sinner
# The humble complaint of a sinner
# De profundis (Psalm 130)
# Domine exaudi (Psalm 143)

Of uncertain attribution are:
# Ye righteous in the Lord
# An heart that&#x27;s broken
# I shame at my unworthiness

=== &quot;First Book of Songs&quot; (1597) ===

Dowland in London in 1597 published his &quot;First Booke of Songes or Ayres&quot;, a set of 21 lute-songs and one of the most influential collections in the history of the lute. Brian Robins wrote that &quot;many of the songs were composed long before the publication date, [...] However, far from being immature, the songs of Book I reveal Dowland as a fully fledged master.&quot; It is set out in a way that allows performance by a soloist with lute accompaniment or by various other combinations of singers and instrumentalists. The lute-songs are listed below. After them, at the end of the collection, comes &quot;My Lord Chamberlaine, His Galliard&quot;, a piece for two people to play on one lute.

=== &quot;Second Book of Songs&quot; (1600) ===
Dowland published his &quot;Second Booke of Songs or Ayres&quot; in 1600. It has 22 lute songs. There is also an instrumental work, Dowland’s adew for Master Oliver Cromwell. The songs are as follows:

=== &quot;Lachrimae&quot; (1604) ===
The &quot;Lachrimae, or Seaven Teares&quot; was published in 1604. It contains the seven pavans of Lachrimae itself and 14 others, including the famous &quot;Semper Dowland semper Dolens&quot;.
# Lachrimae Antiquae
# Lachrimae Antiquae Nouae
# Lachrimae Gementes
# Lachrimae Tristes
# Lachrimae Coactae
# Lachrimae Amantis
# Lachrimae Verae
# Semper Dowland semper Dolens (P.9)
# Sir Henry Vmptons Funeral
# M. Iohn Langtons Pauan
# The King of Denmarks Galiard (P.40)
# The Earle of Essex Galiard
# Sir Iohn Souch his Galiard
# M. Henry Noell his Galiard
# M. Giles Hoby his Galiard
# M. Nicho. Gryffith his Galiard
# M. Thomas Collier his Galiard with two trebles
# Captaine Piper his Galiard (P.19)
# M. Bucton his Galiard
# Mrs Nichols Almand
# M. George Whitehead his Almand

=== &quot;Micrologus&quot; (1609) ===
Dowland published a translation of the &quot;Micrologus&quot; of Andreas Ornithoparcus in 1609, originally printed in Latin in Leipzig in 1517.

=== &quot;Varietie of Lute-Lessons&quot; (1610)===
This was published by Dowland&#x27;s son Robert in 1610 and contains solo lute works by his father and others.

===&quot;A Musicall Banquet&quot; (1610)===
This was likewise published by Dowland&#x27;s son that year. It contains three songs by his father: 
# Farre from Triumphing Court
# Lady If You So Spight Me
# In Darknesse Let Me Dwell

=== &quot;A Pilgrimes Solace&quot; (1612) ===
Dowland&#x27;s last work &quot;A Pilgrimes Solace&quot;, was published in 1612, and seems to have been conceived more as a collection of contrapuntal music than as solo works. Edmund Fellowes praised it as the last masterpiece in the English school of lutenist song before John Attey&#x27;s &quot;First Booke of Ayres of Foure Parts, with Tableture for the Lute&quot; (1622). John Palmer also wrote, &quot;Although this book produced no hits, it is arguably Dowland&#x27;s best set, evincing his absorption of the style of the Italian monodists.&quot;

==Suspicions of treason==
Dowland performed a number of espionage assignments for Sir Robert Cecil in France and Denmark; despite his high rate of pay, Dowland seems to have been only a court musician. However, we have in his own words the fact that he was for a time embroiled in treasonous Catholic intrigue in Italy, whither he had travelled in the hopes of meeting and studying with Luca Marenzio, a famed madrigal composer. Whatever his religion, however, he was still intensely loyal to the Queen, though he seems to have had something of a grudge against her for her remark that he, Dowland, &quot;was a man to serve any prince in the world, but [he] was an obstinate Papist.&quot; But in spite of this, and though the plotters offered him a large sum of money from the Pope, as well as safe passage for his wife and children to come to him from England, in the end he declined to have anything further to do with their plans and begged pardon from Sir Robert Cecil and from the Queen.

==Private life==
John Dowland was married and had children, as referenced in his letter to Sir Robert Cecil. However, he had long periods of separation from his family, as his wife stayed in England while he worked on the Continent.

His son Robert Dowland (c. 1591 – 1641) was also a musician, working for some time in the service of the first Earl of Devonshire, and taking over his father&#x27;s position of lutenist at court when John died.

Dowland&#x27;s melancholic lyrics () and music have often been described as his attempts to develop an &quot;artistic persona&quot; in spite of actually being a cheerful person, but many of his own personal complaints, and the tone of bitterness in many of his comments, suggest that much of his music and his melancholy truly did come from his own personality and frustration.

==Modern interpretations==
One of the first 20th-century musicians who successfully helped reclaim Dowland from the history books was the singer-songwriter Frederick Keel. Keel included fifteen Dowland pieces in his two sets of &quot;Elizabethan love songs&quot; published in 1909 and 1913, which achieved popularity in their day. These free arrangements for piano and low or high voice were intended to fit the tastes and musical practices associated with art songs of the time.

In 1935, Australian-born composer Percy Grainger, who also had a deep interest in music made before Bach, arranged Dowland&#x27;s &quot;Now, O now I needs must part&quot; for piano. Some years later, in 1953, Grainger wrote a work titled &quot;Bell Piece (Ramble on John Dowland&#x27;s &#x27;Now, O now I needs must part&#x27;)&quot;, which was a version scored for voice and wind band, based on his previously mentioned transcription.

In 1951 the counter-tenor Alfred Deller recorded songs by Dowland, Thomas Campion, and Philip Rosseter with the label HMV (His Master&#x27;s Voice) HMV C.4178 and another HMV C.4236 of Dowland&#x27;s &quot;Flow my Tears&quot;. In 1977, Harmonia Mundi also published two records of Deller singing Dowland&#x27;s Lute songs (HM 244&amp;245-H244/246).

Dowland&#x27;s song &quot;Come Heavy Sleepe, the Image of True Death&quot; was the inspiration for Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;Nocturnal after John Dowland&quot;, written in 1963 for the guitarist Julian Bream. It consists of eight variations, all based on musical themes drawn from the song or its lute accompaniment, finally resolving into a guitar setting of the song itself.

Dowland&#x27;s music became part of the repertoire of the early music revival with Bream and tenor Peter Pears, and later with Christopher Hogwood and David Munrow and the Early Music Consort in the late 1960s and later with the Academy of Ancient Music from the early 1970s.

Jan Akkerman, guitarist of the Dutch progressive rock band Focus, recorded &quot;Tabernakel&quot; in 1973 (though released in 1974), an album of John Dowland songs and some original material, performed on lute.

The complete works of John Dowland were recorded by the Consort of Musicke, and released on the L&#x27;Oiseau Lyre label, though they recorded some of the songs as vocal consort music; the &quot;Third Book of Songs&quot; and &quot;A Pilgrim&#x27;s Solace&quot; have yet to be recorded in their entirety as collections of solo songs.

The 1999 ECM New Series recording &quot;In Darkness Let Me Dwell&quot; features new interpretations of Dowland songs performed by tenor John Potter, lutenist Stephen Stubbs, and baroque violinist Maya Homburger in collaboration with English jazz musicians John Surman and Barry Guy.

Nigel North recorded Dowland&#x27;s complete works for solo lute on four CDs between 2004 and 2007, on Naxos records.

Paul O&#x27;Dette recorded the complete lute works for Harmonia Mundi on five CDs issued from 1995 to 1997.

Jordi Savall and his Hespèrion XX issued recordings of the &quot;Lachrimae or Seven Teares&quot; in 2000 and 2013.

Elvis Costello included a recording (with Fretwork and the Composers Ensemble) of Dowland&#x27;s &quot;Can she excuse my wrongs&quot; as a bonus track on the 2006 re-release of his &quot;The Juliet Letters&quot;.

In October 2006, Sting, who says he has been fascinated by the music of John Dowland for 25 years, released an album featuring Dowland&#x27;s songs titled &quot;Songs from the Labyrinth&quot;, on Deutsche Grammophon, in collaboration with Edin Karamazov on lute and archlute. They described their treatment of Dowland&#x27;s work in a &quot;Great Performances&quot; appearance. To give some idea of the tone and intrigues of life in late Elizabethan England, Sting also recites throughout the album portions of a 1593 letter written by Dowland to Sir Robert Cecil. The letter describes Dowland&#x27;s travels to various points of Western Europe, then breaks into a detailed account of his activities in Italy, along with a heartfelt denial of the charges of treason whispered against him by unknown persons. Dowland most likely was suspected of this for travelling to the courts of various Catholic monarchs and accepting payment from them greater than what a musician of the time would normally have received for performing.

Science fiction writer Philip K. Dick referred to Dowland in many of his works, including the novel &quot;Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said&quot; (1974), even using the pseudonym &quot;Jack Dowland&quot; once.

&quot;The Collected Lute Music of John Dowland&quot;, with lute tablature and keyboard notation, was transcribed and edited by Diana Poulton and Basil Lam, Faber Music Limited, London 1974.

<text>John James Audubon (born Jean-Jacques Rabin, April 26, 1785 – January 27, 1851) was a French-American self-trained artist, naturalist, and ornithologist. His combined interests in art and ornithology turned into a plan to make a complete pictorial record of all the bird species of North America. He was notable for his extensive studies documenting all types of American birds and for his detailed illustrations, which depicted the birds in their natural habitats. His major work, a color-plate book titled &quot;The Birds of America&quot; (1827–1839), is considered one of the finest ornithological works ever completed. Audubon is also known for identifying 25 new species. He is the eponym of the National Audubon Society, and his name adorns a large number of towns, neighborhoods, and streets across the United States. Dozens of scientific names first published by Audubon are still in use by the scientific community. In recent years, his legacy has become controversial for his involvement in slavery and his racist writings, as well as allegations of dishonesty.

==Early life==

Audubon was born in Les Cayes in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) on his father&#x27;s sugarcane plantation. He was the son of Lieutenant Jean Audubon, a French naval officer (and privateer) from the south of Brittany, and his mistress, Jeanne Rabine, a 27-year-old chambermaid from Les Touches, Brittany (now in the modern region Pays de la Loire). They named him Jean Rabin. Another 1887 biographer has stated that his mother was a lady from a Louisiana plantation. His mother died when he was a few months old, as she had suffered from tropical disease since arriving on the island. His father already had an unknown number of mixed-race children (among them a daughter named Marie-Madeleine), some by his mixed-race housekeeper, Catherine &quot;Sanitte&quot; Bouffard (described as a quadroon, meaning she was three-quarters European in ancestry). Following Jeanne Rabin&#x27;s death, Audubon renewed his relationship with Sanitte Bouffard and had a daughter by her, named Muguet. Bouffard also took care of the infant boy Jean.

The senior Audubon had commanded ships. During the American Revolution, he was imprisoned by Britain. After his release, he helped the American cause. He had long worked to save money and secure his family&#x27;s future with real estate. Due to repeated uprisings of slaves in the Caribbean, he sold part of his plantation in Saint-Domingue in 1789 and purchased a 284-acre farm called Mill Grove, 20 miles from Philadelphia, to diversify his investments. Increasing tension in Saint-Domingue between the colonists and slaves, who greatly outnumbered them, convinced the senior Audubon to return to France, where he became a member of the Republican Guard. In 1788 he arranged for Jean and in 1791 for Muguet to be transported to France.

The children were raised in Couëron, near Nantes, France, by Audubon and his French wife, Anne Moynet Audubon, whom he had married years before his time in Saint-Domingue. In 1794 they formally adopted both the children to regularize their legal status in France. They renamed the boy Jean-Jacques Fougère Audubon and the girl Rose.

From his earliest days, the younger Audubon had an affinity for birds. &quot;I felt an intimacy with them...bordering on frenzy [that] must accompany my steps through life.&quot; His father encouraged his interest in nature:
He would point out the elegant movement of the birds, and the beauty and softness of their plumage. He called my attention to their show of pleasure or sense of danger, their perfect forms and splendid attire. He would speak of their departure and return with the seasons.

In France during the years of the French Revolution and its aftermath, Audubon grew up to be a handsome and gregarious man. He played flute and violin, and learned to ride, fence, and dance. Audubon enjoyed roaming in the woods, often returning with natural curiosities, including birds&#x27; eggs and nests, of which he made crude drawings. His father planned to make a seaman of his son. At twelve, Audubon went to military school and became a cabin boy. He quickly found out that he was susceptible to seasickness and not fond of mathematics or navigation. After failing the officer&#x27;s qualification test, Audubon ended his incipient naval career. He returned to exploring fields again, focusing on birds.

==Immigration to the United States==

In 1803, his father obtained a false passport so that Jean-Jacques could go to the United States to avoid conscription in the Napoleonic Wars. 18-year-old Jean-Jacques boarded ship, anglicizing his name to John James Audubon. Jean Audubon and Claude Rozier arranged a business partnership for their sons John James Audubon and Jean Ferdinand Rozier to pursue lead mining in Pennsylvania at Audubon&#x27;s Pennsylvania property of Mill Grove. The Audubon-Rozier partnership was based on Rozier&#x27;s buying half of Jean Audubon&#x27;s share of a plantation in Haiti, and lending money to the partnership as secured by half interest in the lead mining.

Audubon caught yellow fever upon arrival in New York City. The ship&#x27;s captain placed him in a boarding house run by Quaker women who nursed Audubon to recovery and taught him English. He traveled with the family&#x27;s Quaker lawyer to the Audubon family farm at Mill Grove. The homestead is located on the Perkiomen Creek a few miles from Valley Forge.

Audubon lived with the tenants in the two-story stone house, in an area that he considered a paradise. &quot;Hunting, fishing, drawing, and music occupied my every moment; cares I knew not, and cared naught about them.&quot; Studying his surroundings, Audubon quickly learned the ornithologist&#x27;s rule, which he wrote down as, &quot;The nature of the place—whether high or low, moist or dry, whether sloping north or south, or bearing tall trees or low shrubs—generally gives hint as to its inhabitants.&quot;

His father hoped that the lead mines on the property could be commercially developed, as lead was an essential component of bullets. This could provide his son with a profitable occupation. At Mill Grove, Audubon met the owner of the nearby Fatland Ford estate, William Bakewell, and his daughter Lucy Bakewell.

Audubon set about to study American birds, determined to illustrate his findings in a more realistic manner than most artists did then. He began drawing and painting birds, and recording their behavior. After an accidental fall into a creek, Audubon contracted a severe fever. He was nursed and recovered at Fatland Ford, with Lucy at his side.

Risking conscription in France, Audubon returned in 1805 to see his father and ask permission to marry. He also needed to discuss family business plans. While there, he met the naturalist and physician Charles-Marie D&#x27;Orbigny, who improved Audubon&#x27;s taxidermy skills and taught him scientific methods of research. Although his return ship was overtaken by an English privateer, Audubon and his hidden gold coins survived the encounter.

Audubon resumed his bird studies and created his own nature museum, perhaps inspired by the great museum of natural history created by Charles Willson Peale in Philadelphia. Peale&#x27;s bird exhibits were considered scientifically advanced. Audubon&#x27;s room was brimming with birds&#x27; eggs, stuffed raccoons and opossums, fish, snakes, and other creatures. He had become proficient at specimen preparation and taxidermy.

Deeming the mining venture too risky, with his father&#x27;s approval Audubon sold part of the Mill Grove farm, including the house and mine, and retaining some land for investment.

== Banding experiment with eastern phoebes ==
In volume 2 of &quot;Ornithological Biography&quot; (1834), Audubon told a story from his childhood, 30 years after the events reportedly took place, that has since garnered him the label of &quot;first bird bander in America&quot;. The story has since been exposed as likely apocryphal. In the spring of 1804, according to the story, Audubon discovered a nest of the &quot;Pewee Flycatcher&quot;, now known as the eastern phoebe (&quot;Sayornis phoebe&quot;), in a small grotto on the property of Mill Grove. To determine whether the other phoebes on the property were &quot;descended from the same stock&quot;, Audubon (1834:126) said that he tied silver threads to the legs of five nestlings:I took the whole family out, and blew off the exuviae of the feathers from the nest. I attached light threads to their legs: these they invariably removed, either with their bills, or with the assistance of their parents. I renewed them, however, until I found the little fellows habituated to them; and at last, when they were about to leave the nest, I fixed a light silver thread to the leg of each, loose enough not to hurt the part, but so fastened that no exertions of theirs could remove it.He also said that he had &quot;ample proof afterwards that the brood of young Pewees, raised in the cave, returned the following spring, and established themselves farther up on the creek, and among the outhouses in the neighbourhood … having caught several of these birds on the nest, [he] had the pleasure of finding that two of them had the little ring on the leg.&quot; However, multiple independent primary sources (including original, dated drawings of European species) demonstrate that Audubon was in France during the spring of 1805, not in Pennsylvania as he later claimed. Furthermore, Audubon&#x27;s claim to have re-sighted 2 out of 5 of the banded phoebes as adults (i.e., a 40% rate of natal philopatry) has not been replicated by modern studies with much larger sample sizes (e.g., 1.6% rate among 549 nestlings banded; and 1.3% rate among 217 nestlings banded). These facts cast doubt on the truth of Audubon&#x27;s story.

==Marriage and family==

In 1808, Audubon moved to Kentucky, which was rapidly being settled. Six months later, he married Lucy Bakewell at her family estate, Fatland Ford, Pennsylvania, and took her the next day to Kentucky. The two shared many common interests, and began to explore the natural world around them. Though their finances were tenuous, the Audubons started a family. They had two sons, Victor Gifford (1809–1860) and John Woodhouse Audubon (1812–1862), and two daughters who died while still young, Lucy at two years (1815–1817) and Rose at nine months (1819–1820). Both sons eventually helped publish their father&#x27;s works. John W. Audubon became a naturalist, writer, and painter in his own right.

==Starting out in business==

Audubon and Jean Ferdinand Rozier moved their merchant business partnership west at various stages, ending ultimately in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, a former French colonial settlement west of the Mississippi River and south of St. Louis. Shipping goods ahead, Audubon and Rozier started a general store in Louisville, Kentucky on the Ohio River; the city had an increasingly important slave market and was the most important port between Pittsburgh and New Orleans. Soon he was drawing bird specimens again. He regularly burned his earlier efforts to force continuous improvement. He also took detailed field notes to document his drawings.

Due to rising tensions with the British, President Jefferson ordered an embargo on British trade in 1808, hurting Audubon&#x27;s trading business. In 1810, Audubon moved his business further west to the less competitive Henderson, Kentucky, area. He and his small family took over an abandoned log cabin. In the fields and forests, Audubon wore typical frontier clothes and moccasins, having &quot;a ball pouch, a buffalo horn filled with gunpowder, a butcher knife, and a tomahawk on his belt&quot;.

He frequently turned to hunting and fishing to feed his family, as business was slow. On a prospecting trip down the Ohio River with a load of goods, Audubon joined up with Shawnee and Osage hunting parties, learning their methods, drawing specimens by the bonfire, and finally parting &quot;like brethren&quot;. Audubon had great respect for Native Americans: &quot;Whenever I meet Indians, I feel the greatness of our Creator in all its splendor, for there I see the man naked from His hand and yet free from acquired sorrow.&quot; Audubon also admired the skill of Kentucky riflemen and the &quot;regulators&quot;, citizen lawmen who created a kind of justice on the Kentucky frontier. In his travel notes, he claims to have encountered Daniel Boone.
The Audubon family owned several slaves while he was in Henderson, until they needed money at which point they were sold. Audubon was condemned contemporaneously by abolitionists. Audubon was dismissive of abolitionists in both the US and the United Kingdom.

Audubon and Rozier mutually agreed to end their partnership at Ste. Genevieve on April 6, 1811. Audubon had decided to work at ornithology and art and wanted to return to Lucy and their son in Kentucky. Rozier agreed to pay Audubon US$3,000 (), with $1,000 in cash and the balance to be paid over time.

The terms of the dissolution of the partnership include those by Audubon:


Audubon was working in Missouri and out riding when the 1811 New Madrid earthquake struck. When Audubon reached his house, he was relieved to find no major damage, but the area was shaken by aftershocks for months. The quake is estimated to have ranked from 8.4 to 8.8 on today&#x27;s moment magnitude scale of severity, stronger than the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 which is estimated at 7.8. Audubon writes that while on horseback, he first believed the distant rumbling to be the sound of a tornado,

but the animal knew better than I what was forthcoming, and instead of going faster, so nearly stopped that I remarked he placed one foot after another on the ground with as much precaution as if walking on a smooth piece of ice. I thought he had suddenly foundered, and, speaking to him, was on point of dismounting and leading him, when he all of a sudden fell a-groaning piteously, hung his head, spread out his forelegs, as if to save himself from falling, and stood stock still, continuing to groan. I thought my horse was about to die, and would have sprung from his back had a minute more elapsed; but as that instant all the shrubs and trees began to move from their very roots, the ground rose and fell in successive furrows, like the ruffled water of a lake, and I became bewildered in my ideas, as I too plainly discovered, that all this awful commotion was the result of an earthquake. I had never witnessed anything of the kind before, although like every person, I knew earthquakes by description. But what is description compared to reality! Who can tell the sensations which I experienced when I found myself rocking, as it were, upon my horse, and with him moving to and fro like a child in a cradle, with the most imminent danger around me.

He noted that as the earthquake retreated, &quot;the air was filled with an extremely disagreeable sulphurous odor.&quot;

==Citizenship and debt==

During a visit to Philadelphia in 1812 following Congress&#x27; declaration of war against Great Britain, Audubon became an American citizen and had to give up his French citizenship. After his return to Kentucky, he found that rats had eaten his entire collection of more than 200 drawings. After weeks of depression, he took to the field again, determined to re-do his drawings to an even higher standard.

The War of 1812 upset Audubon&#x27;s plans to move his business to New Orleans. He formed a partnership with Lucy&#x27;s brother and built up their trade in Henderson. Between 1812 and the Panic of 1819, times were good. Audubon bought land and slaves, founded a flour mill, and enjoyed his growing family. After 1819, Audubon went bankrupt and was thrown into jail for debt. The little money he earned was from drawing portraits, particularly death-bed sketches, greatly esteemed by country folk before photography. He wrote, &quot;[M]y heart was sorely heavy, for scarcely had I enough to keep my dear ones alive; and yet through these dark days I was being led to the development of the talents I loved.&quot;

==Early ornithological career==
Audubon worked for a brief time as the first paid employee of the Western History Society, now known as The Museum of Natural History at The Cincinnati Museum Center. He then traveled south on the Mississippi with his gun, paintbox, and assistant Joseph Mason, who stayed with him from October 1820 to August 1822 and painted the plant life backgrounds of many of Audubon&#x27;s bird studies. He was committed to find and paint all the birds of North America for eventual publication. His goal was to surpass the earlier ornithological work of poet-naturalist Alexander Wilson. Though he could not afford to buy Wilson&#x27;s work, Audubon used it to guide him when he had access to a copy.

In 1818, Rafinesque visited Kentucky and the Ohio River valley to study fishes and was a guest of Audubon. In the middle of the night, Rafinesque noticed a bat in his room and thought it was a new species. He happened to grab Audubon&#x27;s favourite violin in an effort to knock the bat down, resulting in the destruction of the violin. Audubon reportedly took revenge by showing drawings and describing some fictitious fishes and rodents to Rafinesque; Rafinesque gave scientific names to some of these fishes in his &quot;Ichthyologia Ohiensis&quot;.

On October 12, 1820, Audubon traveled into Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida in search of ornithological specimens. He traveled with George Lehman, a professional Swiss landscape artist. The following summer, he moved upriver to the Oakley Plantation in Feliciana Parish, Louisiana, where he taught drawing to Eliza Pirrie, the young daughter of the owners. Though low-paying, the job was ideal, as it afforded him much time to roam and paint in the woods. (The plantation has been preserved as the Audubon State Historic Site, and is located at 11788 Highway 965, between Jackson and St. Francisville.)

Audubon called his future work &quot;The Birds of America&quot;. He attempted to paint one page each day. Painting with newly discovered technique, he decided his earlier works were inferior and re-did them. He hired hunters to gather specimens for him. Audubon realized the ambitious project would take him away from his family for months at a time.

Audubon sometimes used his drawing talent to trade for goods or sell small works to raise cash. He made charcoal portraits on demand at $5 each and gave drawing lessons. In 1823, Audubon took lessons in oil painting technique from John Steen, a teacher of American landscape, and history painter Thomas Cole. Though he did not use oils much for his bird work, Audubon earned good money painting oil portraits for patrons along the Mississippi. (Audubon&#x27;s account reveals that he learned oil painting in December 1822 from Jacob Stein, an itinerant portrait artist. After they had enjoyed all the portrait patronage to be expected in Natchez, Mississippi, during January–March 1823, they resolved to travel together as perambulating portrait-artists.) During this period (1822–1823), Audubon also worked as an instructor at Jefferson College in Washington, Mississippi.

Lucy became the steady breadwinner for the couple and their two young sons. Trained as a teacher, she conducted classes for children in their home. Later she was hired as a local teacher in Louisiana. She boarded with their children at the home of a wealthy plantation owner, as was often the custom of the time.

In 1824, Audubon returned to Philadelphia to seek a publisher for his bird drawings. He took oil painting lessons from Thomas Sully and met Charles Bonaparte, who admired his work and recommended he go to Europe to have his bird drawings engraved. Audubon was nominated for membership at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia by Charles Alexandre Lesueur, Reuben Haines, and Isaiah Lukens, on July 27, 1824. However, he failed to gather enough support, and his nomination was rejected by vote on August 31, 1824; around the same time accusations of scientific misconduct were levied by Alexander Lawson and others.

==&quot;The Birds of America&quot;==
With his wife&#x27;s support, in 1826 at age 41, Audubon took his growing collection of work to England. He sailed from New Orleans to Liverpool on the cotton-hauling ship &quot;Delos&quot;, reaching England in the autumn of 1826 with his portfolio of over 300 drawings. With letters of introduction to prominent Englishmen, and paintings of imaginary species including the &quot;Bird of Washington&quot;, Audubon gained their quick attention. &quot;I have been received here in a manner not to be expected during my highest enthusiastic hopes.&quot;
The British could not get enough of Audubon&#x27;s images of backwoods America and its natural attractions. He met with great acceptance as he toured around England and Scotland, and was lionized as &quot;the American woodsman&quot;. He raised enough money to begin publishing his &quot;The Birds of America&quot;. This monumental work consists of 435 hand-colored, life-size prints of 497 bird species, made from engraved copper plates of various sizes depending on the size of the image. They were printed on sheets measuring about . The work illustrates slightly more than 700 North American bird species, of which some were based on specimens collected by fellow ornithologist John Kirk Townsend on his journey across America with Thomas Nuttall in 1834 as part of Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth&#x27;s second expedition across the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean.

The pages were organized for artistic effect and contrasting interest, as if the reader were taking a visual tour. (Some critics thought he should have organized the plates in Linnaean order as befitting a &quot;serious&quot; ornithological treatise.) The first and perhaps most famous plate was the wild turkey. Among the earliest plates printed was the &quot;Bird of Washington&quot;, which generated favorable publicity for Audubon as his first discovery of a new species. However, no specimen of the species has ever been found, and research published in 2020 suggests that this plate was a mixture of plagiarism and ornithological fraud.

The cost of printing the entire work was $115,640 (over $2,000,000 today), paid for from advance subscriptions, exhibitions, oil painting commissions, and animal skins, which Audubon hunted and sold. Audubon&#x27;s great work was a remarkable accomplishment. It took more than 14 years of field observations and drawings, plus his single-handed management and promotion of the project to make it a success. A reviewer wrote,

All anxieties and fears which overshadowed his work in its beginning had passed away. The prophecies of kind but overprudent friends, who did not understand his self-sustaining energy, had proved untrue; the malicious hope of his enemies, for even the gentle lover of nature has enemies, had been disappointed; he had secured a commanding place in the respect and gratitude of men.

Colorists applied each color in assembly-line fashion (over fifty were hired for the work). The original edition was engraved in aquatint by Robert Havell Jr., who took over the task after the first ten plates engraved by W. H. Lizars were deemed inadequate. Known as the Double Elephant folio for its double elephant paper size, it is often regarded as the greatest picture book ever produced and the finest aquatint work. By the 1830s the aquatint process had been largely superseded by lithography. A contemporary French critic wrote, &quot;A magic power transported us into the forests which for so many years this man of genius has trod. Learned and ignorant alike were astonished at the spectacle ... It is a real and palpable vision of the New World.&quot;

Audubon sold oil-painted copies of the drawings to make extra money and publicize the book. A potential publisher had Audubon&#x27;s portrait painted by John Syme, who clothed the naturalist in frontier clothes; the portrait was hung at the entrance of his exhibitions, promoting his rustic image. The painting is now held in the White House art collection, and is not frequently displayed. The New-York Historical Society holds all 435 of the preparatory watercolors for &quot;The Birds of America&quot;. Lucy Audubon sold them to the society after her husband&#x27;s death. All but 80 of the original copper plates were melted down when Lucy Audubon, desperate for money, sold them for scrap to the Phelps Dodge Corporation.

King George IV was among the avid fans of Audubon and subscribed to support publication of the book. Britain&#x27;s Royal Society recognized Audubon&#x27;s achievement by electing him as a fellow. He was the second American to be elected after statesman Benjamin Franklin. While in Edinburgh to seek subscribers for the book, Audubon gave a demonstration of his method of supporting birds with wire at professor Robert Jameson&#x27;s Wernerian Natural History Association. Student Charles Darwin was in the audience. Audubon also visited the dissecting theatre of the anatomist Robert Knox. Audubon was also successful in France, gaining the King and several of the nobility as subscribers.

&quot;The Birds of America&quot; became very popular during Europe&#x27;s Romantic era. Audubon&#x27;s dramatic portraits of birds appealed to people in this period&#x27;s fascination with natural history.

==Later career==

Audubon returned to America in 1829 to complete more drawings for his magnum opus. He also hunted animals and shipped the valued skins to British friends. He was reunited with his family. After settling business affairs, Lucy accompanied him back to England. Audubon found that during his absence, he had lost some subscribers due to the uneven quality of coloring of the plates. Others were in arrears in their payments. His engraver fixed the plates and Audubon reassured subscribers, but a few begged off. He responded, &quot;&quot;The Birds of America&quot; will then raise in value as much as they are now depreciated by certain fools and envious persons.&quot; He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1830 and to the American Philosophical Society in 1831.

He followed &quot;The Birds of America&quot; with a sequel &quot;Ornithological Biographies&quot;. This was a collection of life histories of each species written with Scottish ornithologist William MacGillivray. The two books were printed separately to avoid a British law requiring copies of all publications with text to be deposited in copyright libraries, a huge financial burden for the self-published Audubon. Both books were published between 1827 and 1839.

During the 1830s, Audubon continued making expeditions in North America. During a trip to Key West, a companion wrote in a newspaper article, &quot;Mr. Audubon is the most enthusiastic and indefatigable man I ever knew ... Mr. Audubon was neither dispirited by heat, fatigue, or bad luck ... he rose every morning at 3 o&#x27;clock and went out ... until 1 o&#x27;clock.&quot; Then he would draw the rest of the day before returning to the field in the evening, a routine he kept up for weeks and months. In the posthumously published book &quot;The Life of John James Audubon The Naturalist&quot;, edited by his widow and derived primarily from his notes, Audubon related visiting the northeastern Florida coastal sugar plantation of John Joachim Bulow for Christmas 1831/early January 1832. It was started by his father and at 4,675 acres, was the largest in East Florida. Bulow had a sugar mill built there under direction of a Scottish engineer, who accompanied Audubon on an excursion in the region. The mill was destroyed in 1836 in the Seminole Wars. The plantation site is preserved today as the Bulow Plantation Ruins Historic State Park.

In March 1832, Audubon booked passage at St. Augustine, Florida, aboard the schooner &quot;Agnes&quot;, bound for Charleston, South Carolina. A gale forced the vessel to berth at the mouth of the Savannah River, where an officer of the United States Army Corps of Engineers on Cockspur Island where Fort Pulaski was under construction, transported Audubon upstream to Savannah, Georgia, on their barge. Just as he was about to board a Charleston-bound stage coach, he remembered William Gaston, a Savannah resident who had once befriended him. Audubon stayed at City Hotel, and the next day sought out and found the acquaintance, &quot;who showed but little enthusiasm for his &quot;Birds of America&quot;&quot; and who doubted that the book would sell a single copy in the city. A dejected Audubon continued to talk to the merchant and a mutual friend who, by chance, had appeared. The merchant, having further considered his position, said, &quot;I subscribe to your work&quot;, gave him $200 for the first volume, and promised to act as his agent in finding additional subscriptions.

In 1833, Audubon sailed north from Maine, accompanied by his son John, and five other young colleagues, to explore the ornithology of Labrador. On the return voyage, their ship &quot;Ripley&quot; made a stop at St. George&#x27;s, Newfoundland. There Audubon and his assistants documented 36 species of birds.

Audubon painted some of his works while staying at the Key West house and gardens of Capt. John H. Geiger. This site was preserved as the Audubon House and Tropical Gardens.

In 1841, having finished the &quot;Ornithological Biographies&quot;, Audubon returned to the United States with his family. He bought an estate on the Hudson River in northern Manhattan. (The roughly 20-acre estate came to be known as Audubon Park in the 1860s when Audubon&#x27;s widow began selling off parcels of the estate for the development of free-standing single family homes.) Between 1840 and 1844, he published an octavo edition of &quot;The Birds of America&quot;, with 65 additional plates. Printed in standard format to be more affordable than the oversize British edition, it earned $36,000 and was purchased by 1100 subscribers. Audubon spent much time on &quot;subscription-gathering trips&quot;, drumming up sales of the octavo edition, as he hoped to leave his family a sizeable income.

==Death==
Audubon made some excursions out West where he hoped to record Western species he had missed, but his health began to fail. In 1848, he manifested signs of senility or possibly dementia from what is now called Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, his &quot;noble mind in ruins&quot;. He died at his family home in northern Manhattan on January 27, 1851. Audubon is buried in the graveyard at the Church of the Intercession in the Trinity Church Cemetery and Mausoleum at 155th Street and Broadway in Manhattan, near his home. An imposing monument in his honor was erected at the cemetery, which is now recognized as part of the Heritage Rose District of NYC.

Audubon&#x27;s final work dealt with mammals; he prepared &quot;The Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America&quot; (1845–1849) in collaboration with his good friend Rev. John Bachman of Charleston, South Carolina, who supplied much of the scientific text. His son, John Woodhouse Audubon, drew most of the plates. The work was completed by Audubon&#x27;s sons, and the second volume was published posthumously in 1851.

==Art and methods==

Audubon developed his own methods for drawing birds. First, he killed them using fine shot. He then used wires to prop them into a natural position, unlike the common method of many ornithologists, who prepared and stuffed the specimens into a rigid pose. When working on a major specimen like an eagle, he would spend up to four 15-hour days, preparing, studying, and drawing it. His paintings of birds are set true-to-life in their natural habitat. He often portrayed them as if caught in motion, especially feeding or hunting. This was in stark contrast to the stiff representations of birds by his contemporaries, such as Alexander Wilson. Audubon based his paintings on his extensive field observations. He worked primarily with watercolor early on. He added colored chalk or pastel to add softness to feathers, especially those of owls and herons. He employed multiple layers of watercoloring, and sometimes used gouache. All species were drawn life size which accounts for the contorted poses of the larger birds as Audubon strove to fit them within the page size. Smaller species were usually placed on branches with berries, fruit, and flowers. He used several birds in a drawing to present all views of anatomy and wings. Larger birds were often placed in their ground habitat or perching on stumps. At times, as with woodpeckers, he combined several species on one page to offer contrasting features. He frequently depicted the birds&#x27; nests and eggs, and occasionally natural predators, such as snakes. He usually illustrated male and female variations, and sometimes juveniles. In later drawings, Audubon used assistants to render the habitat for him. In addition to faithful renderings of anatomy, Audubon also employed carefully constructed composition, drama, and slightly exaggerated poses to achieve artistic as well as scientific effects.

==Dispute over accuracy==
The success of &quot;Birds of America&quot; has been marred by numerous accusations of plagiarism, scientific fraud, and deliberate manipulation of the primary record. Research has uncovered that Audubon falsified (and fabricated) scientific data, published fraudulent data and images in scientific journals and commercial books, invented new species to impress potential subscribers, and to &quot;prank&quot; rivals, and most likely stole the holotype specimen of Harris&#x27;s hawk (&quot;Parabuteo unicinctus harrisi&quot;) before pretending not to know its collector, who was one of his subscribers. He failed to credit work by Joseph Mason, prompting a series of articles in 1835 by critic John Neal questioning Audubon&#x27;s honesty and trustworthiness. Audubon also repeatedly lied about the details of his autobiography, including the place and circumstances of his birth. His diaries, which might have cleared up some of these issues, were destroyed by his granddaughter, who published a doctored version that realigned the &quot;primary&quot; record with some of his false narratives.

The litany of misconduct in Audubon&#x27;s scientific career has drawn comparisons to others such as Richard Meinertzhagen. Similar to early biographies of Meinertzhagen, Audubon&#x27;s scientific misconduct has been repeatedly ignored and/or played down by biographers, who defend &quot;Ornithological Biography&quot; as a &quot;valuable resource and a very good read&quot;.

==Legacy==

Audubon&#x27;s influence on ornithology and natural history was far reaching. Nearly all later ornithological works were inspired by his artistry and high standards. Charles Darwin cited Audubon three times in &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; and also in later works. Despite some errors in field observations, he made a significant contribution to the understanding of bird anatomy and behavior through his field notes. &quot;The Birds of America&quot; is still considered one of the greatest examples of book art. Audubon discovered 25 new species and 12 new subspecies.
* He was elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Linnean Society, and the Royal Society in recognition of his contributions.
* The homestead Mill Grove in Audubon, Pennsylvania, is open to the public and contains a museum presenting all his major works, including &quot;The Birds of America&quot;.
* The Audubon Museum at John James Audubon State Park in Henderson, Kentucky, houses many of Audubon&#x27;s original watercolors, oils, engravings and personal memorabilia.
* In 1905, the National Audubon Society was incorporated and named in his honor. Its mission &quot;is to conserve and restore natural ecosystems, focusing on birds ...&quot;
* He was honored in 1940 by the US Post Office with a 1 cent Famous Americans Series postage stamp; the stamp is green.
* He was honored by the United States Postal Service with a 22¢ Great Americans series postage stamp.
* On December 6, 2010, a copy of &quot;The Birds of America&quot; was sold at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction for $11.5 million, the second highest price for a single printed book.
* On April 26, 2011, Google celebrated his 226th birthday by displaying a special Google Doodle on its global homepage.
* Audubon&#x27;s life and contributions to science and art was the subject of the 2017 film &quot;Audubon&quot;.
* Since 2022, the National Audubon Society has been undergoing discussion about changing their name to distance themselves from Audubon&#x27;s legacy of enslavement. Several local chapters, including Seattle, Chicago, Portland and New York City, have changed their names, while the board of the national body voted against doing so in 2023.

===Audubon in popular culture===

Audubon is the subject of the 1969 book-length poem, &quot;Audubon: A Vision&quot; by Robert Penn Warren. Stephen Vincent Benét, with his wife Rosemary Benét, included a poem about Audubon in the children&#x27;s poetry book &quot;A Book of Americans&quot;.

Audubon&#x27;s 1833 trip to Labrador is the subject of the novel &quot;Creation&quot; by Katherine Govier. Audubon and his wife, Lucy, are the chief characters in the &quot;June&quot; section of the Maureen Howard novel &quot;Big as Life: Three Tales for Spring&quot;. In the novel &quot;Audubon&#x27;s Watch&quot;, John Gregory Brown explores a mysterious death that took place on a Louisiana plantation when Audubon worked there as a young man.

George Voskovec plays Audubon in the 1952 American film &quot;The Iron Mistress&quot;, which stars Alan Ladd as James Bowie. The film imagines a friendship between the two men.

In 1985, The National Gallery of Art 20C History Project produced a documentary, &quot;John James Audubon: The Birds of America&quot;, now widely available online.

In July 2007, PBS&#x27;s &quot;American Masters&quot; series aired an episode titled &quot;John James Audubon: Drawn from Nature&quot;, Supplemental material is available on the PBS website.

Audubon appears in the short story &quot;Audubon In Atlantis&quot; by Harry Turtledove, published in the 2010 collection &quot;Atlantis and Other Places&quot;. Audubon&#x27;s drawings are also the important part of the plot of Gary D. Schmidt&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel &quot;Okay for Now&quot;.

The choral oratorio &quot;Audubon&quot; by James Kallembach was premiered on November 9, 2018, in Boston, Massachusetts by Chorus pro Musica. The work depicts scenes of Audubon&#x27;s life and descriptions of the birds he drew with text drawn from the 2004 biography by Richard Rhodes.

<text>John Edward Masefield (; 1 June 1878 – 12 May 1967) was an English poet and writer, and Poet Laureate from 1930 until his death in 1967. Among his best known works are the children&#x27;s novels &quot;The Midnight Folk&quot; and &quot;The Box of Delights&quot;, and the poems &quot;The Everlasting Mercy&quot; and &quot;Sea-Fever&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Masefield was born in Ledbury in Herefordshire to George Masefield, a solicitor, and his wife Caroline (née Parker). He was baptised in the Church at Preston Cross, just outside Ledbury. His mother died giving birth to his sister when Masefield was six, and he went to live with his aunt. His father died soon afterwards, following a mental breakdown. 

After an unhappy education at the King&#x27;s School in Warwick (now known as Warwick School), where he was a boarder between 1888 and 1891, he left to board , both to train for a life at sea and to break his addiction to reading, of which his aunt thought little. He spent several years aboard this ship, and found that he could spend much of his time reading and writing. It was aboard the &quot;Conway&quot; that Masefield&#x27;s love of story-telling grew. While he was on the ship, he listened to the stories told about sea lore, continued to read, and decided that he was to become a writer and story-teller himself. Masefield gives an account of life aboard the &quot;Conway&quot; in his book &quot;New Chum&quot;.

In 1894 Masefield boarded the &quot;Gilcruix&quot;, destined for Chile. This first voyage brought him the experience of sea sickness, but his record of his experiences while sailing through extreme weather shows his delight in seeing flying fish, porpoises and birds. He was awed by the beauty of nature, including a rare sighting of a nocturnal rainbow, on this voyage. On reaching Chile, he suffered from sunstroke and was hospitalised. He eventually returned home to England as a passenger aboard a steamship. His experiences on the voyage were used as material for his narrative poem &quot;Dauber&quot; (1913).

In 1895 Masefield returned to sea on a windjammer destined for New York City. However, the urge to become a writer and the hopelessness of life as a sailor overtook him, and in New York he jumped ship and travelled throughout the countryside. For several months he lived as a vagrant, drifting between odd jobs, before he returned to New York City and found work as a barkeeper&#x27;s assistant. Some time around Christmas 1895, he read the December edition of &quot;Truth&quot;, a New York periodical, which contained the poem &quot;The Piper of Arll&quot; by Duncan Campbell Scott. Ten years later, Masefield wrote to Scott to tell him what reading that poem had meant to him:

From 1895 to 1897, Masefield was employed at the huge Alexander Smith carpet factory in Yonkers, New York, where long hours were expected and conditions were far from ideal. He purchased up to 20 books a week, and devoured both modern and classical literature. His interests at this time were diverse, and his reading included works by George du Maurier, Alexandre Dumas (père), Thomas Browne, William Hazlitt, Charles Dickens, Rudyard Kipling, and Robert Louis Stevenson. Chaucer also became very important to him during this time, as well as Keats and Shelley. In 1897, Masefield returned home to England as a passenger aboard a steamship.

In 1901, when Masefield was 23, he met his future wife, Constance de la Cherois Crommelin (6 February 186718 February 1960, from Cushendun in County Antrim, Northern Ireland; she was a sister to Andrew Claude de la Cherois Crommelin), aged 35, and of Huguenot descent. They married on 23 June 1903 at St. Mary, Bryanston Square. Educated in classics and English Literature, and a mathematics teacher, Constance was a good match for him, despite the difference in their ages. The couple had two children: Judith, born Isabel Judith, 28 April 1904, in London, died in Sussex, 1 March 1988; and Lewis Crommelin, born in 1910, in London, killed in action in Africa, 29 May 1942.

In 1902 Masefield was put in charge of the fine arts section of the Arts and Industrial Exhibition in Wolverhampton. By then his poems were being published in periodicals and his first collection of verse, &quot;Salt-Water Ballads&quot;, was published that year. It included the poem &quot;Sea-Fever&quot;. Masefield then wrote two novels, &quot;Captain Margaret&quot; (1908) and &quot;Multitude and Solitude&quot; (1909). In 1911, after a long period of writing no poems, he composed &quot;The Everlasting Mercy&quot;, the first of his narrative poems, and within the next year had produced two more, &quot;The Widow in the Bye Street&quot; and &quot;Dauber&quot;. As a result, he became widely known to the public and was praised by the critics. In 1912 he was awarded the annual Edmond de Polignac Prize.

===From the First World War to appointment as Poet Laureate===
When the First World War began in 1914 Masefield was old enough to be exempted from military service, but he joined the staff of a British hospital for French soldiers, the Hôpital Temporaire d&#x27;Arc-en-Barrois in Haute-Marne, serving a six-week term during the spring of 1915. He later published an account of his experiences. At about this time Masefield moved his country retreat from Buckinghamshire to Lollingdon Farm in Cholsey, the setting that inspired a number of poems and sonnets under the title &quot;Lollingdon Downs&quot;, and which his family used until 1917.

After returning home, Masefield was invited to the United States on a three-month lecture tour. Although his primary purpose was to lecture on English literature, he also intended to collect information on the mood and views of Americans regarding the war in Europe. When he returned to England, he submitted a report to the British Foreign Office and suggested that he should be allowed to write a book about the failure of the Allied effort in the Dardanelles that might be used in the United States to counter German propaganda there. The resulting work, &quot;Gallipoli&quot;, was a success. Masefield then met the head of British Military Intelligence in France and was asked to write an account of the Battle of the Somme. Although Masefield had grand ideas for his book, he was denied access to official records and what was intended to be the preface was published as &quot;The Old Front Line&quot;, a description of the geography of the Somme area.

In 1918 Masefield returned to America on his second lecture tour, spending much of his time speaking and lecturing to American soldiers waiting to be sent to Europe. These speaking engagements were very successful. On one occasion a battalion of black soldiers danced and sang for him after his lecture. During this tour he matured as a public speaker and realised his ability to touch the emotions of his audience with his style of speaking, learning to speak publicly from his own heart rather than from dry scripted speeches. Towards the end of his visit both Yale and Harvard Universities conferred honorary doctorates of letters on him.
Masefield entered the 1920s as an accomplished and respected writer. His family was able to settle on Boar&#x27;s Hill, a somewhat rural setting not far from Oxford, where Masefield took up beekeeping, goat-herding and poultry-keeping. He continued to meet with success: the first edition of his &quot;Collected Poems&quot; (1923) sold about 80,000 copies. A narrative poem, &quot;Reynard The Fox&quot; (1920), has been critically compared with works by Geoffrey Chaucer, not necessarily to Masefield&#x27;s credit. This was followed by &quot;Right Royal&quot; and &quot;King Cole&quot;, poems in which the relationship between humanity and nature is emphasised.

After &quot;King Cole&quot;, Masefield turned away from long poems and back to novels. Between 1924 and 1939 he published 12 novels, which vary from stories of the sea (&quot;The Bird of Dawning&quot;, &quot;Victorious Troy&quot;) to social novels about modern England (&quot;The Hawbucks&quot;, &quot;The Square Peg&quot;), and from tales of an imaginary land in Central America (&quot;Sard Harker&quot;, &quot;Odtaa&quot;) to fantasies for children (&quot;The Midnight Folk&quot;, &quot;The Box of Delights&quot;). In this same period he wrote a large number of dramatic pieces. Most of these were based on Christian themes, and Masefield, to his amazement, encountered a ban on the performance of plays on biblical subjects that went back to the Reformation and had been revived a generation earlier to prevent production of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot;. However, a compromise was reached and in 1928 his &quot;The Coming of Christ&quot; was the first play to be performed in an English cathedral since the Middle Ages.

===Encouraging the speaking of verse===

In 1921 Masefield gave the British Academy&#x27;s Shakespeare Lecture and received an honorary doctorate of literature from the University of Oxford. In 1923 he organised Oxford Recitations, an annual contest whose purpose was &quot;to discover good speakers of verse and to encourage &#x27;the beautiful speaking of poetry&#x27;&quot;. Given the numbers of contest applicants, the event&#x27;s promotion of natural speech in poetical recitations, and the number of people learning how to listen to poetry, Oxford Recitations was generally deemed a success. 

Masefield was similarly a founding member of the Scottish Association for the Speaking of Verse in 1924. He later came to question whether the Oxford events should continue as a contest, considering that they might better be run as a festival. However, in 1929, after he broke with the competitive element, Oxford Recitations came to an end. The Scottish Association for the Speaking of Verse, on the other hand, continued to develop through the influence of associated figures such as Marion Angus and Hugh MacDiarmid and exists today as the Poetry Association of Scotland.

===Later years===
In 1930, on the death of Robert Bridges, a new poet laureate was needed. On the recommendation of the Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald, King George V appointed Masefield, who remained in the post until his death in 1967. The only person to hold the office for a longer period was Alfred, Lord Tennyson. On Masefield&#x27;s appointment, &quot;The Times&quot; wrote of him that &quot;his poetry could touch to beauty the plain speech of everyday life&quot;. Masefield took his appointment seriously and produced a large quantity of poems for royal occasions, which were sent to &quot;The Times&quot; for publication. Masefield&#x27;s modesty was shown by his inclusion of a stamped and self-addressed envelope with each submission so that the poem could be returned if it was found unacceptable. Later he was commissioned to write a poem to be set to music by the Master of the King&#x27;s Musick, Sir Edward Elgar, and performed at the unveiling of the Queen Alexandra Memorial by the King on 8 June 1932. This was the ode &quot;So Many True Princesses Who Have Gone&quot;.

After his appointment, Masefield was awarded the Order of Merit by King George V and many honorary degrees from British universities. In 1937 he was elected President of the Society of Authors. In 1938 he was awarded the Shakespeare Prize, one of the only two such awards made by the Hamburg-based Alfred Toepfer Foundation before the Second World War. Masefield encouraged the continued development of English literature and poetry, and began the annual awarding of the Royal Medals for Poetry for a first or second published edition of poems by a poet under the age of 35. Additionally, his speaking engagements called him further away, often on much longer tours, yet he still produced significant amounts of work in a wide variety of genres. To those he had already used he now added autobiography, producing &quot;New Chum&quot;, &quot;In the Mill&quot;, and &quot;So Long to Learn&quot;.

It was not until he was about 70 that Masefield slowed his pace, mainly due to illness. In 1960 Constance died aged 93, after a long illness. Although her death was heartrending, he had spent a tiring year watching the woman he loved die. He continued his duties as poet laureate. &quot;In Glad Thanksgiving&quot;, his last book, was published when he was 88 years old.

In late 1966 Masefield developed gangrene in his ankle. This spread to his leg and he died of the infection on 12 May 1967. In accordance with his stated wishes, he was cremated and his ashes were placed in Poets&#x27; Corner in Westminster Abbey. However, the following verse by Masefield was discovered later, addressed to his &quot;Heirs, Administrators, and Assigns&quot;:

==Legacy==

The Masefield Centre at Warwick School, which Masefield attended, and John Masefield High School in Ledbury, Herefordshire, have been named in his honour. 

Interest groups such as the John Masefield Society ensure the longevity of Masefield&#x27;s opus. In 1977 Folkways Records released an album of readings of some of his poems, including some read by Masefield himself. Recordings preserved include Masefield&#x27;s 1914 Good Friday.

===Song settings===
In addition to the commission for Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Memorial Ode with music by Elgar, many of Masefield&#x27;s short poems were set as art songs by British composers of the time. Best known by far is John Ireland&#x27;s &quot;Sea-Fever&quot;. Frederick Keel composed several songs drawn from the &quot;Salt-Water Ballads&quot; and elsewhere. Of these, &quot;Trade Winds&quot; was particularly popular in its day, despite the tongue-twisting challenges the text presents to the singer. Keel&#x27;s defiant setting of &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, written while interned at Ruhleben during World War I, was frequently programmed at the BBC Proms after the war. Another memorable wartime composition is Ivor Gurney&#x27;s climactic declamation of &quot;By a bierside&quot;, a setting quickly set down in 1916 during a brief spell behind the lines.

<text>Joseph Raymond McCarthy (November 14, 1908 – May 2, 1957) was an American politician who served as a Republican U.S. Senator from the state of Wisconsin from 1947 until his death at age 48 in 1957. Beginning in 1950, McCarthy became the most visible public face of a period in the United States in which Cold War tensions fueled fears of widespread communist subversion. He alleged that numerous communists and Soviet spies and sympathizers had infiltrated the United States federal government, universities, film industry, and elsewhere. Ultimately he was censured by the Senate in 1954 for refusing to cooperate with and abusing members of the committee established to investigate whether or not he should be censured. The term &quot;McCarthyism&quot;, coined in 1950 in reference to McCarthy&#x27;s practices, was soon applied to similar anti-communist activities. Today the term is used more broadly to mean demagogic, reckless, and unsubstantiated accusations, as well as public attacks on the character or patriotism of political opponents.

Born in Grand Chute, Wisconsin, McCarthy commissioned into the Marine Corps in 1942, where he served as an intelligence briefing officer for a dive bomber squadron. Following the end of World War II he attained the rank of major. He volunteered to fly twelve combat missions as a gunner-observer. These missions were generally safe, and after one where he was allowed to shoot as much ammunition as he wanted, mainly at coconut trees, he acquired the nickname &quot;Tail-Gunner Joe&quot;. Some of his claims of heroism were later shown to be exaggerated or falsified, leading many of his critics to use &quot;Tail-Gunner Joe&quot; as a term of mockery.

A Democrat until 1944, McCarthy successfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 1946 as a Republican, narrowly defeating incumbent Robert M. La Follette Jr. in the Wisconsin Republican primary, then Democratic challenger Howard McMurray by a 61% – 37% margin. After three largely undistinguished years in the Senate McCarthy rose suddenly to national fame in February 1950 when he asserted in a speech that he had a list of &quot;members of the Communist Party and members of a spy ring&quot; who were employed in the State Department. In succeeding years after his 1950 speech, McCarthy made additional accusations of Communist infiltration into the State Department, the administration of President Harry S. Truman, the Voice of America, and the U.S. Army. He also used various charges of communism, communist sympathies, disloyalty, or sex crimes to attack a number of politicians and other individuals inside and outside of government. This included a concurrent &quot;Lavender Scare&quot; against suspected homosexuals, whose illicit sexual activity was presumed to make them vulnerable to blackmail by communists and others.

With the highly publicized Army–McCarthy hearings of 1954, and following the suicide of Wyoming Senator Lester C. Hunt that same year, McCarthy&#x27;s support and popularity faded. On December 2, 1954, the Senate voted to censure McCarthy by a vote of 67–22, making him one of the few senators ever to be disciplined in this fashion. He continued to rail against communism and socialism until his death at the age of 48 at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, on May 2, 1957, though doctors had not previously reported him to be seriously ill. His death certificate listed the cause of death as &quot;Hepatitis, acute, cause unknown&quot;, which some biographers say was caused or exacerbated by alcoholism.

==Early life and education==
McCarthy was born in 1908 on a farm in Grand Chute, Wisconsin, the fifth of nine children. His mother, Bridget McCarthy (nee Tierney), was from County Tipperary, Ireland. His father, Timothy McCarthy, was born in the United States, the son of an Irish father and a German mother. McCarthy dropped out of junior high school at age 14 to help his parents manage their farm. He entered Little Wolf High School, in Manawa, Wisconsin, when he was 20 and graduated in one year.

He attended Marquette University from 1930 to 1935. McCarthy worked odd jobs while at college, including as a dishwasher, parking-lot attendant, and boxing coach. He first studied electrical engineering for two years, then law, and received a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1935 from Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee.

== Career ==
McCarthy was admitted to the bar in 1935. While working at a law firm in Shawano, Wisconsin, he launched an unsuccessful campaign for district attorney as a Democrat in 1936. During his years as an attorney, McCarthy made money on the side by gambling.

In 1939, McCarthy had better success when he ran for the nonpartisan elected post of 10th District circuit judge. McCarthy became the youngest circuit judge in the state&#x27;s history by defeating incumbent Edgar V. Werner, who had been a judge for 24 years. In the campaign, McCarthy lied about Werner&#x27;s age of 66, claiming that he was 73, and so allegedly too old and infirm to handle the duties of his office. Writing of Werner in &quot;Reds: McCarthyism In Twentieth-Century America,&quot; Ted Morgan wrote: &quot;Pompous and condescending, he (Werner) was disliked by lawyers. His judgements had often been reversed by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and he was so inefficient that he had piled up a huge backlog of cases.&quot;

McCarthy&#x27;s judicial career attracted some controversy because of the speed with which he dispatched many of his cases as he worked to clear the heavily backlogged docket he had inherited from Werner. Wisconsin had strict divorce laws, but when McCarthy heard divorce cases, he expedited them whenever possible, and he made the needs of children involved in contested divorces a priority. When it came to other cases argued before him, McCarthy compensated for his lack of experience as a jurist by demanding and relying heavily upon precise briefs from the contesting attorneys. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed a low percentage of the cases he heard, but he was also censured in 1941 for having lost evidence in a price fixing case.

===Military service===

In 1942, shortly after the U.S. entered World War II, McCarthy joined the United States Marine Corps, despite the fact that his judicial office exempted him from military service. His college education qualified him for a direct commission, and he entered the Marines as a first lieutenant.

According to Morgan, writing in &quot;Reds,&quot; McCarthy&#x27;s friend and campaign manager, attorney and judge Urban P. Van Susteren, had applied for active duty in the U.S. Army Air Forces in early 1942, and advised McCarthy: &quot;Be a hero—join the Marines.&quot; When McCarthy seemed hesitant, Van Susteren asked, &quot;You got shit in your blood?&quot;

He served as an intelligence briefing officer for a dive bomber squadron VMSB-235 in the Solomon Islands and Bougainville for 30 months (August 1942 – February 1945), and held the rank of captain at the time he resigned his commission in April 1945. He volunteered to fly twelve combat missions as a gunner-observer. These missions were generally safe, and after one where he was allowed to shoot as much ammunition as he wanted, mainly at coconut trees, he acquired the nickname &quot;Tail-Gunner Joe&quot;. McCarthy remained in the Marine Corps Reserve after the war, attaining the rank of lieutenant colonel.

He later falsely claimed participation in 32 aerial missions so as to qualify for a Distinguished Flying Cross and multiple awards of the Air Medal, which the Marine Corps decided to approve in 1952 under his political influence. McCarthy also publicly claimed a letter of commendation from his commanding officer and Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Chief of Naval Operations. However, his commander revealed that McCarthy had written this letter himself, probably while preparing award citations and commendation letters for his men, and that he had signed his commander&#x27;s name, after which Nimitz signed it routinely. A &quot;war wound&quot;—a badly broken leg—that McCarthy attributed to varying adventures involving airplane crashes or anti-aircraft fire, had in fact happened aboard ship during a raucous celebration for sailors crossing the equator for the first time. Because of McCarthy&#x27;s various lies about his military heroism, his &quot;Tail-Gunner Joe&quot; nickname was used in mockery by his critics.

McCarthy campaigned for the Republican Senate nomination in Wisconsin while still on active duty in 1944 but was defeated by Alexander Wiley, the incumbent. After he left the Marines in April 1945, five months before the end of the Pacific war in September 1945, McCarthy was reelected unopposed to his circuit court position. He then began a much more systematic campaign for the 1946 Republican Senate primary nomination, with support from Thomas Coleman, the Republican Party&#x27;s political boss in Wisconsin. In this race, he was challenging three-term senator Robert M. La Follette Jr., founder of the Wisconsin Progressive Party and son of the celebrated Wisconsin governor and senator Robert M. La Follette Sr.

===Senate campaign===
In his campaign, McCarthy attacked La Follette for not enlisting during the war, although La Follette had been 46 when Pearl Harbor was bombed. He also claimed La Follette had made huge profits from his investments while he, McCarthy, had been away fighting for his country. In fact, McCarthy had invested in the stock market himself during the war, netting a profit of $42,000 in 1943 (equal to $ today). Where McCarthy got the money to invest in the first place remains a mystery. La Follette&#x27;s investments consisted of partial interest in a radio station, which earned him a profit of $47,000 over two years.

According to Jack Anderson and Ronald W. May, McCarthy&#x27;s campaign funds, much of them from out of state, were ten times more than La Follette&#x27;s and McCarthy&#x27;s vote benefited from a Communist Party vendetta against La Follette. The suggestion that La Follette had been guilty of war profiteering was deeply damaging, and McCarthy won the primary nomination 207,935 votes to 202,557. It was during this campaign that McCarthy started publicizing his war-time nickname &quot;Tail-Gunner Joe,&quot; using the slogan, &quot;Congress needs a tail-gunner.&quot; Journalist Arnold Beichman later stated that McCarthy &quot;was elected to his first term in the Senate with support from the Communist-controlled United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers, CIO&quot;, which preferred McCarthy to the anti-communist Robert M. La Follette.
In the general election against Democratic opponent Howard J. McMurray, McCarthy won 61.2% to McMurray&#x27;s 37.3%, and thus joined Alexander Wiley, whom he had challenged unsuccessfully two years earlier, in the Senate.


==Personal life==
In 1950, McCarthy assaulted journalist Drew Pearson in the cloakroom at the Sulgrave Club, reportedly kneeing him in the groin. McCarthy, who admitted the assault, claimed he merely &quot;slapped&quot; Pearson. In 1952, using rumors collected by Pearson as well as other sources, Nevada publisher Hank Greenspun wrote that McCarthy was a frequent patron at the White Horse Inn, a Milwaukee gay bar, and cited his involvement with young men. Greenspun named some of McCarthy&#x27;s alleged lovers, including Charles E. Davis, an ex-Communist and &quot;confessed homosexual&quot; who claimed that he had been hired by McCarthy to spy on U.S. diplomats in Switzerland.

McCarthy&#x27;s FBI file also contains numerous allegations, including a 1952 letter from an Army lieutenant who said, &quot;When I was in Washington some time ago, [McCarthy] picked me up at the bar in the Wardman [Hotel] and took me home, and while I was half-drunk he committed sodomy on me.&quot; J. Edgar Hoover conducted a perfunctory investigation of the Senator&#x27;s alleged sexual assault; Hoover&#x27;s take was that &quot;homosexuals are very bitter against Senator McCarthy for his attack upon those who are supposed to be in the Government.&quot;

Although some notable McCarthy biographers have rejected these rumors, others have suggested that he may have been blackmailed. During the early 1950s, McCarthy launched a series of attacks on the CIA, claiming it had been infiltrated by communist agents. Allen Dulles, who suspected McCarthy was using information supplied by Hoover, refused to cooperate. According to the historian David Talbot, Dulles also compiled a &quot;scandalous&quot; intimate dossier on the Senator&#x27;s personal life and used the homosexual stories to take him down.

In any event, McCarthy did not sue Greenspun for libel. (He was told that if the case went ahead he would be compelled to take the witness stand and to refute the charges made in the affidavit of the young man, which was the basis for Greenspun&#x27;s story.)
In 1953, he married Jean Fraser Kerr, a researcher in his office. In January 1957, McCarthy and his wife adopted an infant with the help of Roy Cohn&#x27;s close friend Cardinal Francis Spellman. They named the baby girl Tierney Elizabeth McCarthy.

==United States Senate==
Senator McCarthy&#x27;s first three years in the Senate were unremarkable. McCarthy was a popular speaker, invited by many different organizations, covering a wide range of topics. His aides and many in the Washington social circle described him as charming and friendly, and he was a popular guest at cocktail parties. He was far less well liked among fellow senators, however, who found him quick-tempered and prone to impatience and even rage. Outside of a small circle of colleagues, he was soon an isolated figure in the Senate, who was often widely criticized.

McCarthy was active in labor-management issues, with a reputation as a moderate Republican. He fought against continuation of wartime price controls, especially on sugar. His advocacy in this area was associated by critics with a $20,000 personal loan McCarthy received from a Pepsi bottling executive, earning the Senator the derisive nickname &quot;The Pepsi-Cola Kid&quot;.
McCarthy supported the Taft–Hartley Act over Truman&#x27;s veto, angering labor unions in Wisconsin but solidifying his business base.

===Malmedy massacre trial===

In an incident for which he would be widely criticized, McCarthy lobbied for the commutation of death sentences given to a group of Waffen-SS soldiers convicted of war crimes for carrying out the 1944 Malmedy massacre of American prisoners of war. McCarthy was critical of the convictions because the German soldiers&#x27; confessions were allegedly obtained through torture during the interrogations. He argued that the U.S. Army was engaged in a coverup of judicial misconduct, but never presented any evidence to support the accusation.
Shortly after this, a 1950 poll of the Senate press corps voted McCarthy &quot;the worst U.S. senator&quot; currently in office.
McCarthy biographer Larry Tye has written that antisemitism factored into McCarthy&#x27;s outspoken views on Malmedy, and noted that McCarthy frequently used anti-Jewish slurs. In this and McCarthy&#x27;s other characteristics, such as the enthusiastic support he received from antisemitic politicians like Ku Klux Klansman Wesley Swift and his tendency, according to friends, to refer to his copy of &quot;Mein Kampf,&quot; stating, &quot;That&#x27;s the way to do it,&quot; McCarthy&#x27;s critics characterize him as driven by antisemitism. It is important, however, to note that Tye notes that it was not, in his opinion, antisemitism &quot;alone&quot; that led to McCarthy&#x27;s actions regarding the Malmedy massacre.

It was later found that McCarthy had received &quot;evidence&quot; of the false torture claims from Rudolf Aschenauer, a prominent Neo-Nazi agitator who often served as a defense attorney for Nazi war criminals, such as Einsatzgruppen commander Otto Ohlendorf.

===&quot;Enemies within&quot;===
McCarthy experienced a meteoric rise in national profile beginning on February 9, 1950, when he gave a Lincoln Day speech to the Republican Women&#x27;s Club of Wheeling, West Virginia. His words in the speech are a matter of some debate, as no audio recording was saved. However, it is generally agreed that he produced a piece of paper that he claimed contained a list of known Communists working for the State Department. McCarthy is usually quoted to have said: &quot;The State Department is infested with communists. I have here in my hand a list of 205—a list of names that were made known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the State Department.&quot;

There is some dispute with whether or not McCarthy actually gave the number of people on the list as being &quot;205&quot; or &quot;57&quot;. In a later telegram to President Truman, and when entering the speech into the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;, he used the number 57.
The origin of the number 205 can be traced: in later debates on the Senate floor, McCarthy referred to a 1946 letter that then–Secretary of State James Byrnes sent to Congressman Adolph J. Sabath. In that letter, Byrnes said State Department security investigations had resulted in &quot;recommendation against permanent employment&quot; for 284 persons, and that 79 of these had been removed from their jobs; this left 205 still on the State Department&#x27;s payroll. In fact, by the time of McCarthy&#x27;s speech only about 65 of the employees mentioned in the Byrnes letter were still with the State Department, and all of these had undergone further security checks.

At the time of McCarthy&#x27;s speech, communism was a significant concern in the United States. This concern was exacerbated by the actions of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe, the victory of the communists in the Chinese Civil War, the Soviets&#x27; development of a nuclear weapon the year before, and by the contemporary controversy surrounding Alger Hiss and the confession of Soviet spy Klaus Fuchs. With this background and due to the sensational nature of McCarthy&#x27;s charge against the State Department, the Wheeling speech soon attracted a flood of press interest in McCarthy&#x27;s claim.

===Tydings Committee===

McCarthy himself was taken aback by the massive media response to the Wheeling speech, and he was accused of continually revising both his charges and figures. In Salt Lake City, Utah, a few days later, he cited a figure of 57, and in the Senate on February 20, 1950, he claimed 81. During a five-hour speech, McCarthy presented a case-by-case analysis of his 81 &quot;loyalty risks&quot; employed at the State Department. It is widely accepted that most of McCarthy&#x27;s cases were selected from the so-called &quot;Lee list&quot;, a report that had been compiled three years earlier for the House Appropriations Committee. Led by a former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent named Robert E. Lee, the House investigators had reviewed security clearance documents on State Department employees, and had determined that there were &quot;incidents of inefficiencies&quot;
in the security reviews of 108 employees. McCarthy hid the source of his list, stating that he had penetrated the &quot;iron curtain&quot; of State Department secrecy with the aid of &quot;some good, loyal Americans in the State Department&quot;. In reciting the information from the Lee list cases, McCarthy consistently exaggerated, representing the hearsay of witnesses as facts and converting phrases such as &quot;inclined towards Communism&quot; to &quot;a Communist&quot;.
In response to McCarthy&#x27;s charges, the Senate voted unanimously to investigate, and the Tydings Committee hearings were called. This was a subcommittee of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations set up in February 1950 to conduct &quot;a full and complete study and investigation as to whether persons who are disloyal to the United States are, or have been, employed by the Department of State&quot;.
Many Democrats were incensed at McCarthy&#x27;s attack on the State Department of a Democratic administration, and had hoped to use the hearings to discredit him. The Democratic chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Millard Tydings, was reported to have said, &quot;Let me have him [McCarthy] for three days in public hearings, and he&#x27;ll never show his face in the Senate again.&quot;

During the hearings, McCarthy made charges against nine specific people: Dorothy Kenyon, Esther Brunauer, Haldore Hanson, Gustavo Durán, Owen Lattimore, Harlow Shapley, Frederick Schuman, John S. Service, and Philip Jessup. They all had previously been the subject of charges of varying worth and validity. Owen Lattimore became a particular focus of McCarthy&#x27;s, who at one point described him as a &quot;top Russian spy&quot;.

From its beginning, the Tydings Committee was marked by intense partisan infighting. Its final report, written by the Democratic majority, concluded that the individuals on McCarthy&#x27;s list were neither Communists nor pro-communist, and said the State Department had an effective security program. The Tydings Report labeled McCarthy&#x27;s charges a &quot;fraud and a hoax,&quot; and described them as using incensing rhetoric—saying that the result of McCarthy&#x27;s actions was to &quot;confuse and divide the American people ... to a degree far beyond the hopes of the Communists themselves&quot;. Republicans were outraged by the Democratic response. They responded to the report&#x27;s rhetoric in kind, with William E. Jenner stating that Tydings was guilty of &quot;the most brazen whitewash of treasonable conspiracy in our history&quot;.
The full Senate voted three times on whether to accept the report, and each time the voting was precisely divided along party lines.

===Fame and notoriety===
From 1950 onward, McCarthy continued to exploit the fear of Communism and to press his accusations that the government was failing to deal with Communism within its ranks. McCarthy also began investigations into homosexuals working in the foreign policy bureaucracy, who were considered prime candidates for blackmail by the Soviets. These accusations received wide publicity, increased his approval rating, and gained him a powerful national following.

In Congress, there was little doubt that homosexuals did not belong in sensitive government positions. Since the late 1940s, the government had been dismissing about five homosexuals a month from civilian posts; by 1954, the number had grown twelve-fold. As historian David M. Barrett would write, &quot;Mixed in with the hysterics were some logic, though: homosexuals faced condemnation and discrimination, and most of them—wishing to conceal their orientation—were vulnerable to blackmail.&quot; Director of Central Intelligence Roscoe Hillenkoetter was called to Congress to testify on homosexuals being employed at the CIA. He said, &quot;The use of homosexuals as a control mechanism over individuals recruited for espionage is a generally accepted technique which has been used at least on a limited basis for many years.&quot; As soon as the DCI said these words, his aide signaled to take the remainder of the DCI&#x27;s testimony off the record. Political historian David Barrett uncovered Hillenkoetter&#x27;s notes, which reveal the remainder of the statement: &quot;While this agency will never employ homosexuals on its rolls, it might conceivably be necessary, and in the past has actually been valuable, to use known homosexuals as agents in the field. I am certain that if Joseph Stalin or a member of the Politburo or a high satellite official were known to be a homosexual, no member of this committee or of the Congress would balk against our use of any technique to penetrate their operations ... after all, intelligence and espionage is, at best, an extremely dirty business.&quot; The senators reluctantly agreed the CIA had to be flexible.

McCarthy&#x27;s methods also brought on the disapproval and opposition of many. Barely a month after McCarthy&#x27;s Wheeling speech, the term &quot;McCarthyism&quot; was coined by &quot;Washington Post&quot; cartoonist Herbert Block. Block and others used the word as a synonym for demagoguery, baseless defamation, and mudslinging. Later, it would be embraced by McCarthy and some of his supporters. &quot;McCarthyism is Americanism with its sleeves rolled,&quot; McCarthy said in a 1952 speech, and later that year, he published a book titled &quot;McCarthyism: The Fight For America&quot;.

McCarthy sought to discredit his critics and political opponents by accusing them of being Communists or communist sympathizers. In the 1950 Maryland Senate election, McCarthy campaigned for John Marshall Butler in his race against four-term incumbent Millard Tydings, with whom McCarthy had been in conflict during the Tydings Committee hearings. In speeches supporting Butler, McCarthy accused Tydings of &quot;protecting Communists&quot; and &quot;shielding traitors&quot;. McCarthy&#x27;s staff was heavily involved in the campaign and collaborated in the production of a campaign tabloid that contained a composite photograph doctored to make it appear that Tydings was in intimate conversation with Communist leader Earl Russell Browder. A Senate subcommittee later investigated this election and referred to it as &quot;a despicable, back-street type of campaign&quot;, as well as recommending that the use of defamatory literature in a campaign be made grounds for expulsion from the Senate. The pamphlet was clearly labeled a composite. McCarthy said it was &quot;wrong&quot; to distribute it; though staffer Jean Kerr thought it was fine. After he lost the election by almost 40,000 votes, Tydings claimed foul play.

In addition to the Tydings–Butler race, McCarthy campaigned for several other Republicans in the 1950 elections, including Everett Dirksen against Democratic incumbent and Senate Majority Leader Scott W. Lucas. Dirksen, and indeed all the candidates McCarthy supported, won their elections, and those he opposed lost. The elections, including many that McCarthy was not involved in, were an overall Republican sweep. Although his impact on the elections was unclear, McCarthy was credited as a key Republican campaigner. He was now regarded as one of the most powerful men in the Senate and was treated with new-found deference by his colleagues. In the 1952 Senate elections McCarthy was returned to his Senate seat with 54.2% of the vote, compared to Democrat Thomas Fairchild&#x27;s 45.6%. As of 2020, McCarthy is the last Republican to win Wisconsin&#x27;s Class 1 Senate seat.


===McCarthy and the Truman administration===
McCarthy and President Truman clashed often during the years both held office. McCarthy characterized Truman and the Democratic Party as soft on, or even in league with, Communists, and spoke of the Democrats&#x27; &quot;twenty years of treason&quot;. Truman, in turn, once referred to McCarthy as &quot;the best asset the Kremlin has&quot;, calling McCarthy&#x27;s actions an attempt to &quot;sabotage the foreign policy of the United States&quot; in a cold war and comparing it to shooting American soldiers in the back in a hot war.
It was the Truman Administration&#x27;s State Department that McCarthy accused of harboring 205 (or 57 or 81) &quot;known Communists&quot;. Truman&#x27;s Secretary of Defense, George Marshall, was the target of some of McCarthy&#x27;s most vitriolic rhetoric. Marshall had been Army Chief of Staff during World War II and was also Truman&#x27;s former Secretary of State. Marshall was a highly respected general and statesman, remembered today as the architect of victory and peace, the latter based on the Marshall Plan for post-war reconstruction of Europe, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953. McCarthy made a lengthy speech on Marshall, later published in 1951 as a book titled &quot;America&#x27;s Retreat From Victory: The Story of George Catlett Marshall&quot;. Marshall had been involved in American foreign policy with China, and McCarthy charged that Marshall was directly responsible for the loss of China to Communism. In the speech McCarthy also implied that Marshall was guilty of treason;
declared that &quot;if Marshall were merely stupid, the laws of probability would dictate that part of his decisions would serve this country&#x27;s interest&quot;; and most famously, accused him of being part of &quot;a conspiracy so immense and an infamy so black as to dwarf any previous venture in the history of man&quot;.

In December 1950, McCarthy teamed with right-wing radio star Fulton Lewis Jr. to smear Truman&#x27;s nominee for Assistant Secretary of Defense, Anna M. Rosenberg. Their smear campaign attracted allies in anti-Semites and extremists like Gerald L. K. Smith, who falsely claimed Rosenberg, who was Jewish, was a communist. Unlike other women targets of McCarthyism, Rosenberg emerged with her career and integrity intact. When the smear campaign fizzled out, journalist Edward R. Murrow said &quot;the character assassin has missed.&quot;

During the Korean War, when Truman dismissed General Douglas MacArthur, McCarthy charged that Truman and his advisors must have planned the dismissal during late-night sessions when &quot;they&#x27;ve had time to get the President cheerful&quot; on bourbon and Bénédictine. McCarthy declared, &quot;The son of a bitch should be impeached.&quot;

===Support from Catholics and the Kennedy family===

One of the strongest bases of anti-Communist sentiment in the United States was the Catholic community, which constituted over 20% of the national vote. McCarthy identified himself as Catholic, and although the great majority of Catholics were Democrats, as his fame as a leading anti-Communist grew, he became popular in Catholic communities across the country, with strong support from many leading Catholics, diocesan newspapers, and Catholic journals. At the same time, some Catholics opposed McCarthy, notably the anti-Communist author Father John Francis Cronin and the influential journal &quot;Commonweal&quot;.

McCarthy established a bond with the powerful Kennedy family, which had high visibility among Catholics. McCarthy became a close friend of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., himself a fervent anti-Communist, and he was also a frequent guest at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. He dated two of Kennedy&#x27;s daughters, Patricia and Eunice. It has been stated that McCarthy was godfather to Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s first child, Kathleen Kennedy. This claim has been acknowledged by Robert&#x27;s wife and Kathleen&#x27;s mother Ethel, though Kathleen later claimed that she looked at her baptismal certificate and that her actual godfather was Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart professor Daniel Walsh.

Robert Kennedy was unusual among his Harvard friends for defending McCarthy when they discussed politics after graduation. He was chosen by McCarthy to be a counsel for his investigatory committee, but resigned after six months due to disagreements with McCarthy and Committee Counsel Roy Cohn. Joseph Kennedy had a national network of contacts and became a vocal supporter, building McCarthy&#x27;s popularity among Catholics and making sizable contributions to McCarthy&#x27;s campaigns. The Kennedy patriarch hoped that one of his sons would be president. Mindful of the anti-Catholic prejudice which Al Smith faced during his 1928 campaign for that office, Joseph Kennedy supported McCarthy as a national Catholic politician who might pave the way for a younger Kennedy&#x27;s presidential candidacy.

Unlike many Democrats, John F. Kennedy, who served in the Senate with McCarthy from 1953 until the latter&#x27;s death in 1957, never attacked McCarthy. McCarthy did not campaign for Kennedy&#x27;s 1952 opponent, Republican incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., due to his friendship with the Kennedys and, reportedly, a $50,000 donation from Joseph Kennedy. Lodge lost despite Eisenhower winning the state in the presidential election. When a speaker at a February 1952 final club dinner stated that he was glad that McCarthy had not attended Harvard College, an angry Kennedy jumped up, denounced the speaker, and left the event. When Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. asked John Kennedy why he avoided criticizing McCarthy, Kennedy responded by saying, &quot;Hell, half my voters in Massachusetts look on McCarthy as a hero&quot;.

===McCarthy and Eisenhower===

During the 1952 presidential election, the Eisenhower campaign toured Wisconsin with McCarthy. In a speech delivered in Green Bay, Eisenhower declared that while he agreed with McCarthy&#x27;s goals, he disagreed with his methods. In draft versions of his speech, Eisenhower had also included a strong defense of his mentor, George Marshall, which was a direct rebuke of McCarthy&#x27;s frequent attacks. However, under the advice of conservative colleagues who were afraid that Eisenhower could lose Wisconsin if he alienated McCarthy supporters, he deleted this defense from later versions of his speech. The deletion was discovered by William H. Laurence, a reporter for &quot;The New York Times,&quot; and featured on its front page the next day. Eisenhower was widely criticized for giving up his personal convictions, and the incident became the low point of his campaign.

With his victory in the 1952 presidential race, Eisenhower became the first Republican president in 20 years. The Republican Party also held a majority in the House of Representatives and the Senate. After being elected president, Eisenhower made it clear to those close to him that he did not approve of McCarthy and he worked actively to diminish his power and influence. Still, he never directly confronted McCarthy or criticized him by name in any speech, thus perhaps prolonging McCarthy&#x27;s power by giving the impression that even the President was afraid to criticize him directly. Oshinsky disputes this, stating that &quot;Eisenhower was known as a harmonizer, a man who could get diverse factions to work toward a common goal. ... Leadership, he explained, meant patience and conciliation, not &#x27;hitting people over the head.&#x27;&quot;

McCarthy won reelection in 1952 with 54% of the popular vote, defeating former Wisconsin State Attorney General Thomas E. Fairchild but, as stated above, badly trailing a Republican ticket which otherwise swept the state of Wisconsin; all the other Republican winners, including Eisenhower himself, received at least 60% of the Wisconsin vote.
Those who expected that party loyalty would cause McCarthy to tone down his accusations of Communists being harbored within the government were soon disappointed. Eisenhower had never been an admirer of McCarthy, and their relationship became more hostile once Eisenhower was in office. In a November 1953 speech that was carried on national television, McCarthy began by praising the Eisenhower Administration for removing &quot;1,456 Truman holdovers who were ... gotten rid of because of Communist connections and activities or perversion.&quot; He then went on to complain that John Paton Davies Jr. was still &quot;on the payroll after eleven months of the Eisenhower administration,&quot; even though Davies had actually been dismissed three weeks earlier, and repeated an unsubstantiated accusation that Davies had tried to &quot;put Communists and espionage agents in key spots in the Central Intelligence Agency.&quot; In the same speech, he criticized Eisenhower for not doing enough to secure the release of missing American pilots shot down over China during the Korean War. By the end of 1953, McCarthy had altered the &quot;twenty years of treason&quot; catchphrase he had coined for the preceding Democratic administrations and began referring to &quot;twenty-&quot;one&quot; years of treason&quot; to include Eisenhower&#x27;s first year in office.

As McCarthy became increasingly combative towards the Eisenhower Administration, Eisenhower faced repeated calls that he confront McCarthy directly. Eisenhower refused, saying privately &quot;nothing would please him [McCarthy] more than to get the publicity that would be generated by a public repudiation by the President.&quot; On several occasions Eisenhower is reported to have said of McCarthy that he did not want to &quot;get down in the gutter with that guy.&quot;

===Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations===
With the beginning of his second term as senator in January 1953, McCarthy was made chairman of the Senate Committee on Government Operations. According to some reports, Republican leaders were growing wary of McCarthy&#x27;s methods and gave him this relatively mundane panel rather than the Internal Security Subcommittee—the committee normally involved with investigating Communists—thus putting McCarthy &quot;where he can&#x27;t do any harm&quot;, in the words of Senate Majority Leader Robert A. Taft. However, the Committee on Government Operations included the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and the mandate of this subcommittee was sufficiently flexible to allow McCarthy to use it for his own investigations of Communists in the government. McCarthy appointed Roy Cohn as chief counsel and 27-year-old Robert F. Kennedy as an assistant counsel to the subcommittee. Later, McCarthy also hired Gerard David Schine, heir to a hotel-chain fortune, on the recommendation of George Sokolsky.

This subcommittee would be the scene of some of McCarthy&#x27;s most publicized exploits. When the records of the closed executive sessions of the subcommittee under McCarthy&#x27;s chairmanship were made public in 2003–04, Senators Susan Collins and Carl Levin wrote the following in their preface to the documents:

Senator McCarthy&#x27;s zeal to uncover subversion and espionage led to disturbing excesses. His browbeating tactics destroyed careers of people who were not involved in the infiltration of our government. His freewheeling style caused both the Senate and the Subcommittee to revise the rules governing future investigations, and prompted the courts to act to protect the Constitutional rights of witnesses at Congressional hearings. ... These hearings are a part of our national past that we can neither afford to forget nor permit to re-occur.

The subcommittee first investigated allegations of Communist influence in the Voice of America, at that time administered by the State Department&#x27;s United States Information Agency. Many VOA personnel were questioned in front of television cameras and a packed press gallery, with McCarthy lacing his questions with hostile innuendo and false accusations. A few VOA employees alleged Communist influence on the content of broadcasts, but none of the charges were substantiated. Morale at VOA was badly damaged, and one of its engineers committed suicide during McCarthy&#x27;s investigation. Ed Kretzman, a policy advisor for the service, would later comment that it was VOA&#x27;s &quot;darkest hour when Senator McCarthy and his chief hatchet man, Roy Cohn, almost succeeded in muffling it.&quot;

The subcommittee then turned to the overseas library program of the International Information Agency. Cohn toured Europe examining the card catalogs of the State Department libraries looking for works by authors he deemed inappropriate. McCarthy then recited the list of supposedly pro-communist authors before his subcommittee and the press. The State Department bowed to McCarthy and ordered its overseas librarians to remove from their shelves &quot;material by any controversial persons, Communists, fellow travelers, etc.&quot; Some libraries went as far as burning the newly-forbidden books. Shortly after this, in one of his public criticisms of McCarthy, President Eisenhower urged Americans: &quot;Don&#x27;t join the book burners. ... Don&#x27;t be afraid to go in your library and read every book.&quot;

Soon after receiving the chair to the Subcommittee on Investigations, McCarthy appointed J. B. Matthews as staff director of the subcommittee. One of the nation&#x27;s foremost anti-communists, Matthews had formerly been staff director for the House Un-American Activities Committee. The appointment became controversial when it was learned that Matthews had recently written an article titled &quot;Reds and Our Churches&quot;, which opened with the sentence, &quot;The largest single group supporting the Communist apparatus in the United States is composed of Protestant Clergymen.&quot; A group of senators denounced this &quot;shocking and unwarranted attack against the American clergy&quot; and demanded that McCarthy dismiss Matthews. McCarthy initially refused to do this. As the controversy mounted, however, and the majority of his own subcommittee joined the call for Matthews&#x27;s ouster, McCarthy finally yielded and accepted his resignation. For some McCarthy opponents, this was a signal defeat of the senator, showing he was not as invincible as he had formerly seemed.

===Investigating the Army===
In autumn 1953, McCarthy&#x27;s committee began its ill-fated inquiry into the United States Army. This began with McCarthy opening an investigation into the Army Signal Corps laboratory at Fort Monmouth. McCarthy, newly married to Jean Kerr, cut short his honeymoon to open the investigation. He garnered some headlines with stories of a dangerous spy ring among the army researchers, but after weeks of hearings, nothing came of his investigations. Unable to expose any signs of subversion, McCarthy focused instead on the case of Irving Peress, a New York dentist who had been drafted into the army in 1952 and promoted to major in November 1953. Shortly thereafter it came to the attention of the military bureaucracy that Peress, who was a member of the left-wing American Labor Party, had declined to answer questions about his political affiliations on a loyalty-review form. Peress&#x27;s superiors were therefore ordered to discharge him from the army within 90 days. McCarthy subpoenaed Peress to appear before his subcommittee on January 30, 1954. Peress refused to answer McCarthy&#x27;s questions, citing his rights under the Fifth Amendment. McCarthy responded by sending a message to Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens, demanding that Peress be court-martialed. On that same day, Peress asked for his pending discharge from the army to be effected immediately, and the next day Brigadier General Ralph W. Zwicker, his commanding officer at Camp Kilmer in New Jersey, gave him an honorable separation from the army. At McCarthy&#x27;s encouragement, &quot;Who promoted Peress?&quot; became a rallying cry among many anti-communists and McCarthy supporters. In fact, and as McCarthy knew, Peress had been promoted automatically through the provisions of the Doctor Draft Law, for which McCarthy had voted.

===Army–McCarthy hearings===

Early in 1954, the U.S. Army accused McCarthy and his chief counsel, Roy Cohn, of improperly pressuring the army to give favorable treatment to G. David Schine, a former aide to McCarthy and a friend of Cohn&#x27;s, who was then serving in the army as a private. McCarthy claimed that the accusation was made in bad faith, in retaliation for his questioning of Zwicker the previous year. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, usually chaired by McCarthy himself, was given the task of adjudicating these conflicting charges. Republican senator Karl Mundt was appointed to chair the committee, and the Army–McCarthy hearings convened on April 22, 1954.
The army consulted with an attorney familiar with McCarthy to determine the best approach to attacking him. Based on his recommendation, it decided not to pursue McCarthy on the question of communists in government: &quot;The attorney feels it is almost impossible to counter McCarthy effectively on the issue of kicking Communists out of Government, because he generally has some basis, no matter how slight, for his claim of Communist connection.&quot;

The hearings lasted for 36 days and were broadcast on live television by ABC and DuMont, with an estimated 20 million viewers. After hearing 32 witnesses and two million words of testimony, the committee concluded that McCarthy himself had not exercised any improper influence on Schine&#x27;s behalf, but that Cohn had engaged in &quot;unduly persistent or aggressive efforts&quot;. The committee also concluded that Army Secretary Robert Stevens and Army Counsel John Adams &quot;made efforts to terminate or influence the investigation and hearings at Fort Monmouth&quot;, and that Adams &quot;made vigorous and diligent efforts&quot; to block subpoenas for members of the Army Loyalty and Screening Board &quot;by means of personal appeal to certain members of the [McCarthy] committee&quot;.

Of far greater importance to McCarthy than the committee&#x27;s inconclusive final report was the adverse effect that the extensive exposure had on his popularity. Many in the audience saw him as bullying, reckless, and dishonest, and the daily newspaper summaries of the hearings were also frequently unfavorable.
Late in the hearings, Senator Stuart Symington made an angry and prophetic remark to McCarthy. Upon being told by McCarthy that &quot;You&#x27;re not fooling anyone&quot;, Symington replied: &quot;Senator, the American people have had a look at you now for six weeks; you&#x27;re not fooling anyone, either.&quot;
In Gallup polls of January 1954, 50% of those polled had a favorable opinion of McCarthy. In June, that number had fallen to 34%. In the same polls, those with a unfavorable opinion of McCarthy increased from 29% to 45%.

An increasing number of Republicans and conservatives were coming to see McCarthy as a liability to the party and to anti-communism. Representative George H. Bender noted, &quot;There is a growing impatience with the Republican Party. McCarthyism has become a synonym for witch-hunting, Star Chamber methods, and the denial of ... civil liberties.&quot; Frederick Woltman, a reporter with a long-standing reputation as a staunch anti-communist, wrote a five-part series of articles criticizing McCarthy in the &quot;New York World-Telegram.&quot; He stated that McCarthy &quot;has become a major liability to the cause of anti-communism&quot;, and accused him of &quot;wild twisting of facts and near-facts [that] repels authorities in the field&quot;.
The most famous incident in the hearings was an exchange between McCarthy and the army&#x27;s chief legal representative, Joseph Nye Welch. On June 9, 1954, the 30th day of the hearings, Welch challenged Roy Cohn to provide U.S. Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr. with McCarthy&#x27;s list of 130 Communists or subversives in defense plants &quot;before the sun goes down&quot;. McCarthy stepped in and said that if Welch was so concerned about persons aiding the Communist Party, he should check on a man in his Boston law office named Fred Fisher, who had once belonged to the National Lawyers Guild, a progressive lawyers&#x27; association.
In an impassioned defense of Fisher, Welch responded, &quot;Until this moment, Senator, I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness ...&quot; When McCarthy resumed his attack, Welch interrupted him: &quot;Let us not assassinate this lad further, Senator. You&#x27;ve done enough. Have you no sense of decency, Sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?&quot; When McCarthy once again persisted, Welch cut him off and demanded the chairman &quot;call the next witness&quot;. At that point, the gallery erupted in applause and a recess was called.
===Edward R. Murrow, &quot;See It Now&quot;===
Even before McCarthy&#x27;s clash with Welch in the hearings, one of the most prominent attacks on McCarthy&#x27;s methods was an episode of the television documentary series &quot;See It Now&quot;, hosted by journalist Edward R. Murrow, which was broadcast on March 9, 1954. Titled &quot;A Report on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy&quot;, the episode consisted largely of clips of McCarthy speaking. In these clips, McCarthy accuses the Democratic party of &quot;twenty years of treason&quot;, describes the American Civil Liberties Union as &quot;listed as &#x27;a front for, and doing the work of&#x27;, the Communist Party&quot;, and berates and harangues various witnesses, including General Zwicker.

In his conclusion, Murrow said of McCarthy:

The following week, &quot;See It Now&quot; ran another episode critical of McCarthy, this one focusing on the case of Annie Lee Moss, an African-American army clerk who was the target of one of McCarthy&#x27;s investigations. The Murrow shows, together with the televised Army–McCarthy hearings of the same year, were the major causes of a nationwide popular opinion backlash against McCarthy, in part because for the first time his statements were being publicly challenged by noteworthy figures. To counter the negative publicity, McCarthy appeared on &quot;See It Now&quot; on April 6, 1954, and made a number of charges against the popular Murrow, including the accusation that he colluded with VOKS, the &quot;Russian espionage and propaganda organization&quot;. This response did not go over well with viewers, and the result was a further decline in McCarthy&#x27;s popularity.

===&quot;Joe Must Go&quot; recall attempt===
On March 18, 1954, &quot;Sauk-Prairie Star&quot; editor Leroy Gore of Sauk City, Wisconsin urged the recall of McCarthy in a front-page editorial that ran alongside a sample petition that readers could fill out and mail to the newspaper. A Republican and former McCarthy supporter, Gore cited the senator with subverting President Eisenhower&#x27;s authority, disrespecting Wisconsin&#x27;s own Gen. Ralph Wise Zwicker and ignoring the plight of Wisconsin dairy farmers faced with price-slashing surpluses.

Despite critics&#x27; claims that a recall attempt was foolhardy, the &quot;Joe Must Go&quot; movement caught fire and was backed by a diverse coalition including other Republican leaders, Democrats, businessmen, farmers and students. Wisconsin&#x27;s constitution stipulates the number of signatures needed to force a recall election must exceed one-quarter the number of voters in the most recent gubernatorial election, requiring the anti-McCarthy movement to gather some 404,000 signatures in sixty days. With little support from organized labor or the state Democratic Party, the roughly organized recall effort attracted national attention, particularly during the concurrent Army-McCarthy hearings.

Following the deadline of June 5, the final number of signatures was never determined because the petitions were sent out of state to avoid a subpoena from Sauk County district attorney Harlan Kelley, an ardent McCarthy supporter who was investigating the leaders of the recall campaign on the grounds that they had violated Wisconsin&#x27;s Corrupt Practices Act. Chicago newspapermen later tallied 335,000 names while another 50,000 were said to be hidden in Minneapolis, with other lists buried on Sauk County farms.

===Public opinion===
===Censure and the Watkins Committee===

Several members of the U.S. Senate had opposed McCarthy well before 1953. Senator Margaret Chase Smith, a Maine Republican, was the first. She delivered her &quot;Declaration of Conscience&quot; speech on June 1, 1950, calling for an end to the use of smear tactics, without mentioning McCarthy or anyone else by name. Only six other Republican senators—Wayne Morse, Irving Ives, Charles W. Tobey, Edward John Thye, George Aiken, and Robert C. Hendrickson—agreed to join her in condemning McCarthy&#x27;s tactics. McCarthy referred to Smith and her fellow senators as &quot;Snow White and the six dwarfs&quot;.

On March 9, 1954, Vermont Republican senator Ralph E. Flanders gave a humor-laced speech on the Senate floor, questioning McCarthy&#x27;s tactics in fighting communism, likening McCarthyism to &quot;house-cleaning&quot; with &quot;much clatter and hullabaloo&quot;. He recommended that McCarthy turn his attention to the worldwide encroachment of Communism outside North America.
In a June 1 speech, Flanders compared McCarthy to Adolf Hitler, accusing him of spreading &quot;division and confusion&quot; and saying, &quot;Were the Junior Senator from Wisconsin in the pay of the Communists he could not have done a better job for them.&quot;
On June 11, Flanders introduced a resolution to have McCarthy removed as chair of his committees. Although there were many in the Senate who believed that some sort of disciplinary action against McCarthy was warranted, there was no clear majority supporting this resolution. Some of the resistance was due to concern about usurping the Senate&#x27;s rules regarding committee chairs and seniority. Flanders next introduced a resolution to censure McCarthy. The resolution was initially written without any reference to particular actions or misdeeds on McCarthy&#x27;s part. As Flanders put it, &quot;It was not his breaches of etiquette, or of rules or sometimes even of laws which is so disturbing,&quot; but rather his overall pattern of behavior. Ultimately a &quot;bill of particulars&quot; listing 46 charges was added to the censure resolution. A special committee, chaired by Senator Arthur Vivian Watkins, was appointed to study and evaluate the resolution. This committee opened hearings on August 31.

After two months of hearings and deliberations, the Watkins Committee recommended that McCarthy be censured on two of the 46 counts: his contempt of the Subcommittee on Rules and Administration, which had called him to testify in 1951 and 1952, and his abuse of General Zwicker in 1954. The Zwicker count was dropped by the full Senate on the grounds that McCarthy&#x27;s conduct was arguably &quot;induced&quot; by Zwicker&#x27;s own behavior. In place of this count, a new one was drafted regarding McCarthy&#x27;s statements about the Watkins Committee itself.

The two counts on which the Senate ultimately voted were:
* That McCarthy had &quot;failed to co-operate with the Sub-committee on Rules and Administration&quot;, and &quot;repeatedly abused the members who were trying to carry out assigned duties ...&quot;
* That McCarthy had charged &quot;three members of the [Watkins] Select Committee with &#x27;deliberate deception&#x27; and &#x27;fraud&#x27; ... that the special Senate session ... was a &#x27;lynch party, and had characterized the committee &quot;as the &#x27;unwitting handmaiden&#x27;, &#x27;involuntary agent&#x27; and &#x27;attorneys in fact&#x27; of the Communist Party&quot;, and had &quot;acted contrary to senatorial ethics and tended to bring the Senate into dishonor and disrepute, to obstruct the constitutional processes of the Senate, and to impair its dignity&quot;.

On December 2, 1954, the Senate voted to &quot;condemn&quot; McCarthy on both counts by a vote of 67 to 22. The Democrats present unanimously favored condemnation and the Republicans were split evenly. The only senator not on record was John F. Kennedy, who was hospitalized for back surgery; Kennedy never indicated how he would have voted. Immediately after the vote, Senator H. Styles Bridges, a McCarthy supporter, argued that the resolution was &quot;not a censure resolution&quot; because the word &quot;condemn&quot; rather than &quot;censure&quot; was used in the final draft. The word &quot;censure&quot; was then removed from the title of the resolution, though it is generally regarded and referred to as a censure of McCarthy, both by historians
and in Senate documents. McCarthy himself said, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it a vote of confidence.&quot; He added, &quot;I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;ve been lynched.&quot;
Indiana Senator William E. Jenner, one of McCarthy&#x27;s friends and fellow Republicans likened McCarthy&#x27;s conduct, however, to that of &quot;the kid who came to the party and peed in the lemonade.&quot;

==Final years==

After his condemnation and censure, McCarthy continued to perform his senatorial duties for another two and a half years. His career as a major public figure, however, had been ruined. His colleagues in the Senate avoided him; his speeches on the Senate floor were delivered to a near-empty chamber or received with intentional and conspicuous displays of inattention.
The press that had once recorded his every public statement now ignored him, and outside speaking engagements dwindled almost to nothing. Eisenhower, finally freed of McCarthy&#x27;s political intimidation, quipped to his Cabinet that McCarthyism was now &quot;McCarthywasm&quot;.

Still, McCarthy continued to rail against Communism and Socialism. He warned against attendance at summit conferences with &quot;the Reds&quot;, saying that &quot;you cannot offer friendship to tyrants and murderers ... without advancing the cause of tyranny and murder.&quot;
He declared that &quot;co-existence with Communists is neither possible nor honorable nor desirable. Our long-term objective must be the eradication of Communism from the face of the earth.&quot; In one of his final acts in the Senate, McCarthy opposed President Eisenhower&#x27;s nomination to the Supreme Court of William J. Brennan, after reading a speech Brennan had given shortly beforehand in which he characterized McCarthy&#x27;s anti-Communist investigations as &quot;witch hunts&quot;. McCarthy&#x27;s opposition failed to gain any traction, however, and he was the only senator to vote against Brennan&#x27;s confirmation.

McCarthy&#x27;s biographers agree that he was a changed man, for the worse, after the censure; declining both physically and emotionally, he became a &quot;pale ghost of his former self&quot;, in the words of Fred J. Cook.
It was reported that McCarthy suffered from cirrhosis of the liver and was frequently hospitalized for alcohol abuse.
Numerous eyewitnesses, including Senate aide George Reedy and journalist Tom Wicker, reported finding him drunk in the Senate.
Journalist Richard Rovere (1959) wrote:

He had always been a heavy drinker, and there were times in those seasons of discontent when he drank more than ever. But he was not always drunk. He went on the wagon (for him this meant beer instead of whiskey) for days and weeks at a time. The difficulty toward the end was that he couldn&#x27;t hold the stuff. He went to pieces on his second or third drink, and he did not snap back quickly.

McCarthy had also become addicted to morphine. Harry J. Anslinger, head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, became aware of McCarthy&#x27;s addiction in the 1950s, and demanded he stop using the drug. McCarthy refused. In Anslinger&#x27;s memoir, &quot;The Murderers&quot;, McCarthy is anonymously quoted as saying:

I wouldn&#x27;t try to do anything about it, Commissioner ... It will be the worse for you ... and if it winds up in a public scandal and that should hurt this country, I wouldn&#x27;t care […] The choice is yours.

Anslinger decided to give McCarthy access to morphine in secret from a pharmacy in Washington, DC. The morphine was paid for by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, right up to McCarthy&#x27;s death. Anslinger never publicly named McCarthy, and he threatened with prison a journalist who had uncovered the story. However, McCarthy&#x27;s identity was known to Anslinger&#x27;s agents, and journalist Maxine Cheshire confirmed his identity with Will Oursler, co-author of &quot;The Murderers,&quot; in 1978.

==Death==

McCarthy died in the Bethesda Naval Hospital on May 2, 1957, at the age of 48. His death certificate listed the cause of death as &quot;Hepatitis, acute, cause unknown&quot;; previously doctors had not reported him to be in critical condition. It was hinted in the press that he died of alcoholism (cirrhosis of the liver), an estimation that is now accepted by modern biographers. Thomas C. Reeves argues that he effectively died by suicide. He was given a state funeral that was attended by 70 senators, and a Solemn Pontifical Requiem Mass was celebrated before more than 100 priests and 2,000 others at Washington&#x27;s St. Matthew&#x27;s Cathedral. Thousands of people viewed his body in Washington. He was buried in St. Mary&#x27;s Parish Cemetery, Appleton, Wisconsin, where more than 17,000 people filed through St. Mary&#x27;s Church in order to pay him their last respects. Three senators—George W. Malone, William E. Jenner, and Herman Welker—had flown from Washington to Appleton on the plane that carried McCarthy&#x27;s casket. Robert F. Kennedy attended the funeral in Wisconsin. McCarthy was survived by his wife, Jean, and their daughter, Tierney.

In the summer of 1957, a special election was held in order to fill McCarthy&#x27;s seat. In the primaries, voters in both parties turned away from McCarthy&#x27;s legacy. The Republican primary was won by Governor Walter J. Kohler Jr., who called for a clean break from McCarthy&#x27;s approach; he defeated former Representative Glenn Robert Davis, who charged that President Eisenhower was soft on Communism.

Kohler was defeated in the special general election by Democrat William Proxmire. After assuming his seat, Proxmire did not pay the customary tribute to his predecessor and stated instead that McCarthy was a &quot;disgrace to Wisconsin, to the Senate, and to America.&quot; As of 2024, McCarthy is the last Republican to have held, or won election to, Wisconsin&#x27;s Class 1 Senate seat.

==Legacy==
William Bennett, former Reagan Administration Secretary of Education, summed up his perspective in his 2007 book &quot;America: The Last Best Hope&quot;:

===House Un-American Activities Committee===
McCarthy&#x27;s hearings are often incorrectly conflated with the hearings of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). HUAC is best known for its investigations of Alger Hiss and the Hollywood film industry, which led to the blacklisting of hundreds of actors, writers, and directors. HUAC was a House committee, and as such it had no formal connection to McCarthy, who served in the Senate, although the existence of the House Un-American Activities Committee thrived in part as a result of McCarthy&#x27;s activities. HUAC was active for 37 years (1938–1975).

===In popular culture===
From the start of his notoriety, McCarthy served as a favorite subject for political cartoonists. He was traditionally depicted in a negative light, normally pertaining to McCarthyism and his accusations. Herblock&#x27;s cartoon that coined the term &quot;McCarthyism&quot; appeared less than two months after the senator&#x27;s now famous February 1950 speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.

In 1951, Ray Bradbury published &quot;The Fireman&quot;, an allegory on suppression of ideas. This served as the basis for &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; published in 1953. Bradbury said that he wrote &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; because of his concerns at the time (during the McCarthy era) about the threat of book burning in the United States. Bob Hope was one of the first comedians to make jokes about McCarthy. During his 1952 Christmas show, Hope made a joke about Santa Claus writing to let Joe McCarthy know he was going to wear his red suit despite the Red Scare. Hope continued to offer McCarthy jokes as they were well received by most people, although he did receive some hate mail.

In 1953, the popular daily comic strip &quot;Pogo&quot; introduced the character Simple J. Malarkey, a pugnacious and conniving wildcat with an unmistakable physical resemblance to McCarthy. After a worried Rhode Island newspaper editor protested to the syndicate that provided the strip, creator Walt Kelly began depicting the Malarkey character with a bag over his head, concealing his features. The explanation was that Malarkey was hiding from a Rhode Island Red hen, a clear reference to the controversy over the Malarkey character. In 1953, playwright Arthur Miller published &quot;The Crucible&quot;, suggesting the Salem witch trials were analogous to McCarthyism.

As his fame grew, McCarthy increasingly became the target of ridicule and parody. He was impersonated by nightclub and radio impressionists and was satirized in &quot;Mad&quot; magazine, on &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;, and elsewhere. Several comedy songs lampooning the senator were released in 1954, including &quot;Point of Order&quot; by Stan Freberg and Daws Butler, &quot;Senator McCarthy Blues&quot; by Hal Block, and unionist folk singer Joe Glazer&#x27;s &quot;Joe McCarthy&#x27;s Band&quot;, sung to the tune of &quot;McNamara&#x27;s Band&quot;. Also in 1954, the radio comedy team Bob and Ray parodied McCarthy with the character &quot;Commissioner Carstairs&quot; in their soap opera spoof &quot;Mary Backstayge, Noble Wife&quot;. That same year, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio network broadcast a satire, &quot;The Investigator&quot;, whose title character was a clear imitation of McCarthy. A recording of the show became popular in the United States, and was reportedly played by President Eisenhower at cabinet meetings. The 1953 short story &quot;Mr. Costello, Hero&quot; by Theodore Sturgeon was described by journalist Paul Williams as &quot;the all-time great story about Senator Joseph McCarthy, who he was and how he did what he did.&quot;

====Post-censure reaction====
&quot;Mr. Costello, Hero&quot; was adapted in 1958 by X Minus One into a radio teleplay and broadcast on July 3, 1956. While the radio adaptation retains much of the story, it completely remakes the narrator and in fact gives him a line spoken in the original by Mr. Costello himself, thus changing the tone of the story considerably. In a 1977 interview Sturgeon commented that it was his concerns about the ongoing McCarthy Hearings that prompted him to write the story.

A more serious fictional portrayal of McCarthy played a central role in the 1959 novel &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; by Richard Condon. The character of Senator John Iselin, a demagogic anti-communist, is closely modeled on McCarthy, even to the varying numbers of Communists he asserts are employed by the federal government. He remains a major character in the 1962 film version.

The 1962 novel &quot;Advise and Consent&quot; by Allen Drury features an overzealous demagogue, Senator Fred Van Ackerman, based on McCarthy. Although the fictional senator is an ultra liberal who proposes surrender to the Soviet Union, his portrayal strongly resembles the popular perception of McCarthy&#x27;s character and methods.

McCarthy was portrayed by Peter Boyle in the 1977 Emmy-winning television movie &quot;Tail Gunner Joe&quot;, a dramatization of McCarthy&#x27;s life. He was portrayed by Joe Don Baker in the 1992 HBO film &quot;Citizen Cohn&quot;. Archival footage of McCarthy himself was used in the 2005 film &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot; about Edward R. Murrow and the &quot;See It Now&quot; episode that challenged McCarthy. In the German-French docu-drama &quot;The Real American – Joe McCarthy&quot; (2012), directed by Lutz Hachmeister, McCarthy is portrayed by the British actor and comedian John Sessions. In Lee Daniels&#x27; 2020 film, &quot;The United States vs. Billie Holiday&quot;, McCarthy is portrayed by actor Randy Davison.
R.E.M.&#x27;s song &quot;Exhuming McCarthy&quot;, from their 1987 album &quot;Document&quot;, deals largely with McCarthy and contains sound clips from the Army-McCarthy Hearings.

&#x27;Joe&#x27; McCarthy is also mentioned in Billy Joel&#x27;s 1989 song &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Start the Fire&quot;.

McCarthyism is one of the subjects of Barbara Kingsolver&#x27;s novel &quot;The Lacuna&quot;.

McCarthy is a secondary character in the Showtime television drama &quot;Fellow Travelers.&quot;

=== Reconsideration ===
McCarthy remains a controversial figure. Arthur Herman, popular historian and senior fellow of the Hudson Institute, says that new evidence—in the form of Venona-decrypted Soviet messages, Soviet espionage data now opened to the West, and newly released transcripts of closed hearings before McCarthy&#x27;s subcommittee—has partially vindicated McCarthy by showing that some of his identifications of Communists were correct and the scale of Soviet espionage activities in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s was larger than many scholars had suspected.
In &quot;Blacklisted by History: The Untold Story of Senator Joe McCarthy and His Fight Against America&#x27;s Enemies&quot;, journalist M. Stanton Evans similarly argued that evidence from the Venona documents shows significant penetration by Soviet agents.

Historian John Earl Haynes, who studied the Venona decryptions extensively, challenged Herman&#x27;s efforts to rehabilitate McCarthy, arguing that McCarthy&#x27;s attempts to &quot;make anti-communism a partisan weapon&quot; actually &quot;threatened [the post-War] anti-Communist consensus&quot;, thereby ultimately harming anti-Communist efforts more than helping them. Haynes concluded that, of the 159 people who were identified on lists used or referenced by McCarthy, evidence only substantially proved that nine of them had aided Soviet espionage efforts—while several hundred Soviet spies were actually known based on Venona and other evidence, most were never named by McCarthy. Haynes&#x27; own view was that a number of those accused on McCarthy&#x27;s lists above, perhaps a majority, likely posed some form of possible security risk, but a significant minority of others likely did not, and several were indisputably no risk at all.

<doc id="16324" wikidata="Q272774" url="?curid=16324" title="John Hancock">
<text>John Hancock ( – October 8, 1793) was an American Founding Father, merchant, statesman, and prominent Patriot of the American Revolution. He was the longest-serving president of the Continental Congress, having served as the second president of the Second Continental Congress and the seventh president of the Congress of the Confederation. He was the first and third governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He is remembered for his large and stylish signature on the United States Declaration of Independence, so much so that in the United States, or has become a colloquialism for a person&#x27;s signature. He also signed the Articles of Confederation, and used his influence to ensure that Massachusetts ratified the United States Constitution in 1788.

Before the American Revolution, Hancock was one of the wealthiest men in the Thirteen Colonies, having inherited a profitable mercantile business from his uncle. He began his political career in Boston as a protégé of Samuel Adams, an influential local politician, though the two men later became estranged. Hancock used his wealth to support the colonial cause as tensions increased between colonists and Great Britain in the 1760s. He became very popular in Massachusetts, especially after British officials seized his sloop &quot;Liberty&quot; in 1768 and charged him with smuggling. Those charges were eventually dropped; he has often been described as a smuggler in historical accounts, but the accuracy of this characterization has been questioned.

==Early life==

Hancock was born on January 23, 1737, in Braintree, Massachusetts, in a part of town that eventually became the separate city of Quincy. He was the son of Colonel John Hancock Jr. of Braintree and Mary Hawke Thaxter (widow of Samuel Thaxter Junior), who was from nearby Hingham. As a child, Hancock became a casual acquaintance of young John Adams, whom the Reverend Hancock had baptized in 1735. The Hancocks lived a comfortable life and owned one slave to help with household work.

After Hancock&#x27;s father died in 1744, he was sent to live with his uncle and aunt, Thomas Hancock and Lydia (Henchman) Hancock. Thomas Hancock was the proprietor of a firm known as the House of Hancock, which imported manufactured goods from Britain and exported rum, whale oil, and fish. Thomas Hancock&#x27;s highly successful business made him one of Boston&#x27;s richest and best-known residents. He and Lydia, along with several servants and slaves, lived in Hancock Manor on Beacon Hill. The couple, who did not have any children of their own, became the dominant influence on John&#x27;s life.

After graduating from the Boston Latin School in 1750, Hancock enrolled in Harvard College and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1754. Upon graduation, he began to work for his uncle, just as the French and Indian War had begun. Thomas Hancock had close relations with the royal governors of Massachusetts and secured profitable government contracts during the war. John Hancock learned much about his uncle&#x27;s business during these years and was trained for eventual partnership in the firm. Hancock worked hard, but he also enjoyed playing the role of a wealthy aristocrat and developed a fondness for expensive clothes.

From 1760 to 1761, Hancock lived in England while building relationships with customers and suppliers. Upon returning to Boston, Hancock gradually took over the House of Hancock as his uncle&#x27;s health failed, becoming a full partner in January 1763. He became a member of the Masonic Lodge of St. Andrew in October 1762, which connected him with many of Boston&#x27;s most influential citizens. When Thomas Hancock died in August 1764, John inherited the business, Hancock Manor, two or three household slaves, and thousands of acres of land, becoming one of the wealthiest men in the colonies. The household slaves continued to work for John and his aunt, but were eventually freed through the terms of Thomas Hancock&#x27;s will; there is no evidence that John Hancock ever bought or sold slaves.

==Growing imperial tensions==
After its victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War, the British Empire was deeply in debt. Looking for new sources of revenue, the British Parliament sought, for the first time, to directly tax the colonies, beginning with the Sugar Act 1764. The earlier Molasses Act 1733, a tax on shipments from the West Indies, had produced hardly any revenue because it was widely bypassed by smuggling, which was seen as a victimless crime. Not only was there little social stigma attached to smuggling in the colonies, but in port cities where trade was the primary generator of wealth, smuggling enjoyed considerable community support, and it was even possible to obtain insurance against being caught. Colonial merchants developed an impressive repertoire of evasive maneuvers to conceal the origin, nationality, routes, and content of their illicit cargoes. This included the frequent use of fraudulent paperwork to make the cargo appear legal and authorized. And much to the frustration of the British authorities, when seizures did happen local merchants were often able to use sympathetic provincial courts to reclaim confiscated goods and have their cases dismissed. For instance, Edward Randolph, the appointed head of customs in New England, brought 36 seizures to trial from 1680 to the end of 1682—and all but two of these were acquitted. Alternatively, merchants sometimes took matters into their own hands and stole illicit goods back while impounded.

The Sugar Act 1764 provoked outrage in Boston, where it was widely viewed as a violation of colonial rights. Men such as James Otis and Samuel Adams argued that because the colonists were not represented in Parliament, they could not be taxed by that body; only the colonial assemblies, where the colonists were represented, could levy taxes upon the colonies. Hancock was not yet a political activist; however, he criticized the tax for economic, rather than constitutional, reasons.

Hancock emerged as a leading political figure in Boston just as tensions with Great Britain were increasing. In March 1765, he was elected as one of Boston&#x27;s five selectmen, an office previously held by his uncle for many years. Soon after, Parliament passed the Stamp Act 1765, a tax on legal documents such as wills that had been levied in Britain for many years but which was wildly unpopular in the colonies, producing riots and organized resistance. Hancock initially took a moderate position: as a loyal British subject, he thought that the colonists should submit to the act even though he believed that Parliament was misguided. Within a few months Hancock had changed his mind, although he continued to disapprove of violence and the intimidation of royal officials by mobs. Hancock joined the resistance to the Stamp Act 1765 by participating in a boycott of British goods, which made him popular in Boston. After Bostonians learned of the impending repeal of the Stamp Act, Hancock was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in May 1766.

Hancock&#x27;s political success benefited from the support of Samuel Adams, the clerk of the House of Representatives and a leader of Boston&#x27;s &quot;popular party&quot;, also known as &quot;Whigs&quot; and later as &quot;Patriots&quot;. The two men made an unlikely pair. Fifteen years older than Hancock, Adams had a somber, Puritan outlook that stood in marked contrast to Hancock&#x27;s taste for luxury and extravagance. Apocryphal stories later portrayed Adams as masterminding Hancock&#x27;s political rise so that the merchant&#x27;s wealth could be used to further the Whig agenda. Historian James Truslow Adams portrays Hancock as shallow and vain, easily manipulated by Adams. Historian William M. Fowler, who wrote biographies of both men, argues that this characterization was an exaggeration and that the relationship between the two was symbiotic, with Adams as the mentor and Hancock the protégé.

==Townshend Acts crisis==

After the repeal of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a different approach to raising revenue, passing the 1767 Townshend Acts, which established new duties on various imports and strengthened the customs agency by creating the American Customs Board. The British government believed that a more efficient customs system was necessary because many colonial American merchants had been smuggling. Smugglers violated the Navigation Acts by trading with ports outside of the British Empire and avoiding import taxes. Parliament hoped that the new system would reduce smuggling and generate revenue for the government.

Colonial merchants, even those not involved in smuggling, found the new regulations oppressive. Other colonists protested that new duties were another attempt by Parliament to tax the colonies without their consent. Hancock joined other Bostonians in calling for a boycott of British imports until the Townshend duties were repealed. In their enforcement of the customs regulations, the Customs Board targeted Hancock, Boston&#x27;s wealthiest Whig. They may have suspected that he was a smuggler or they may have wanted to harass him because of his politics, especially after Hancock snubbed Governor Francis Bernard by refusing to attend public functions when the customs officials were present.

On April 9, 1768, two customs employees (called tidesmen) boarded Hancock&#x27;s brig &quot;Lydia&quot; in Boston Harbor. Hancock was summoned, and finding that the agents lacked a writ of assistance (a general search warrant), he did not allow them to go below deck. When one of them later managed to get into the hold, Hancock&#x27;s men forced the tidesman back on deck. Customs officials wanted to file charges, but the case was dropped when Massachusetts Attorney General Jonathan Sewall ruled that Hancock had broken no laws. Later, some of Hancock&#x27;s most ardent admirers called this incident the first act of physical resistance to British authority in the colonies and credit Hancock with initiating the American Revolution.

===&quot;Liberty&quot; affair===

The next incident proved to be a major event in the coming of the American Revolution. On the evening of May 9, 1768, Hancock&#x27;s sloop &quot;Liberty&quot; arrived in Boston Harbor, carrying a shipment of Madeira wine. When custom officers inspected the ship the next morning, they found that it contained 25 pipes of wine, just one fourth of the ship&#x27;s carrying capacity. Hancock paid the duties on the 25 pipes of wine, but officials suspected that he had arranged to have more wine unloaded during the night to avoid paying the duties for the entire cargo. They did not have any evidence to prove this, however, since the two tidesmen who had stayed on the ship overnight gave a sworn statement that nothing had been unloaded.

One month later, while the British warship HMS &quot;Romney&quot; was in port, one of the tidesmen changed his story: he claimed that he had been forcibly held on the &quot;Liberty&quot; while it had been illegally unloaded. On June 10, customs officials seized the &quot;Liberty&quot;. Bostonians were already angry because the captain of the &quot;Romney&quot; had been impressing colonists and not just deserters from the Royal Navy, an arguably illegal activity. A riot broke out when officials began to tow the &quot;Liberty&quot; out to the &quot;Romney&quot;, which was also arguably illegal. The confrontation escalated when sailors and marines coming ashore to seize the &quot;Liberty&quot; were mistaken for a press gang. After the riot, customs officials relocated to the &quot;Romney&quot; and then to Castle William (an island fort in the harbor), claiming that they were unsafe in town. Whigs insisted that the customs officials were exaggerating the danger so that London would send troops to Boston.

British officials filed two lawsuits stemming from the &quot;Liberty&quot; incident: an &quot;in rem&quot; suit against the ship and an &quot;in personam&quot; suit against Hancock. Royal officials as well as Hancock&#x27;s accuser stood to gain financially since, as was the custom, any penalties assessed by the court would be awarded to the governor, the informer, and the Crown, each getting a third. The first suit, filed on June 22, 1768, resulted in the confiscation of the &quot;Liberty&quot; in August. Customs officials then used the ship to enforce trade regulations until it was burned by angry colonists in Rhode Island the following year.

The second trial began in October 1768, when charges were filed against Hancock and five others for allegedly unloading 100 pipes of wine from the &quot;Liberty&quot; without paying the duties. If convicted, the defendants would have had to pay a penalty of triple the value of the wine, which came to £9,000. With John Adams serving as his lawyer, Hancock was prosecuted in a highly publicized trial by a vice admiralty court, which had no jury and was not required to allow the defense to cross-examine the witnesses. After dragging out for nearly five months, the proceedings against Hancock were dropped without explanation.

Although the charges against Hancock were dropped, many writers later described him as a smuggler. The accuracy of this characterization has been questioned. &quot;Hancock&#x27;s guilt or innocence and the exact charges against him&quot;, wrote historian John W. Tyler in 1986, &quot;are still fiercely debated.&quot; Historian Oliver Dickerson argues that Hancock was the victim of an essentially criminal racketeering scheme perpetrated by Governor Bernard and the customs officials. Dickerson believes that there is no reliable evidence that Hancock was guilty in the &quot;Liberty&quot; case and that the purpose of the trials was to punish Hancock for political reasons and to plunder his property. Opposed to Dickerson&#x27;s interpretation were Kinvin Wroth and Hiller Zobel, the editors of John Adams&#x27;s legal papers, who argue that &quot;Hancock&#x27;s innocence is open to question&quot; and that the British officials acted legally, if unwisely. Lawyer and historian Bernard Knollenberg concludes that the customs officials had the right to seize Hancock&#x27;s ship, but towing it out to the &quot;Romney&quot; had been illegal. Legal historian John Phillip Reid argues that the testimony of both sides was so politically partial that it is not possible to objectively reconstruct the incident.

Aside from the &quot;Liberty&quot; affair, the degree to which Hancock was engaged in smuggling, which may have been widespread in the colonies, has been questioned. Given the clandestine nature of smuggling, records are scarce. If Hancock was a smuggler, no documentation of this has been found. John W. Tyler identified 23 smugglers in his study of more than 400 merchants in revolutionary Boston but found no written evidence that Hancock was one of them. Biographer William Fowler concludes that while Hancock was probably engaged in some smuggling, most of his business was legitimate, and his later reputation as the &quot;king of the colonial smugglers&quot; is a myth without foundation.

==Massacre to Tea Party==
The &quot;Liberty&quot; affair reinforced a previously made British decision to suppress unrest in Boston with a show of military might. The decision had been prompted by Samuel Adams&#x27;s 1768 Circular Letter, which was sent to other British American colonies in hopes of coordinating resistance to the Townshend Acts. Lord Hillsborough, secretary of state for the colonies, sent four regiments of the British Army to Boston to support embattled royal officials and instructed Governor Bernard to order the Massachusetts legislature to revoke the Circular Letter. Hancock and the Massachusetts House voted against rescinding the letter and instead drew up a petition demanding Governor Bernard&#x27;s recall. When Bernard returned to England in 1769, Bostonians celebrated.

The British troops remained, however, and tensions between soldiers and civilians eventually resulted in the killing of five civilians in the Boston Massacre of March 1770. Hancock was not involved in the incident, but afterwards he led a committee to demand the removal of the troops. Meeting with Bernard&#x27;s successor, Governor Thomas Hutchinson, and the British officer in command, Colonel William Dalrymple, Hancock claimed that there were 10,000 armed colonists ready to march into Boston if the troops did not leave. Hutchinson knew that Hancock was bluffing, but the soldiers were in a precarious position when garrisoned within the town, and so Dalrymple agreed to remove both regiments to Castle William. Hancock was celebrated as a hero for his role in getting the troops withdrawn. His re-election to the Massachusetts House in May was nearly unanimous.

After Parliament partially repealed the Townshend duties in 1770, Boston&#x27;s boycott of British goods ended. Politics became quieter in Massachusetts, although tensions remained. Hancock tried to improve his relationship with Governor Hutchinson, who in turn sought to woo Hancock away from Adams&#x27;s influence. In April 1772, Hutchinson approved Hancock&#x27;s election as colonel of the Boston Cadets, a militia unit whose primary function was to provide a ceremonial escort for the governor and the General Court. In May, Hutchinson even approved Hancock&#x27;s election to the Council, the upper chamber of the General Court, whose members were elected by the House but subject to veto by the governor. Hancock&#x27;s previous elections to the council had been vetoed, but now Hutchinson allowed the election to stand. Hancock declined the office, however, not wanting to appear to have been co-opted by the governor. Nevertheless, Hancock used the improved relationship to resolve an ongoing dispute. To avoid hostile crowds in Boston, Hutchinson had been convening the legislature outside of town; now he agreed to allow the General Court to sit in Boston once again, to the relief of the legislators.

Hutchinson had dared to hope that he could win over Hancock and discredit Adams. To some, it seemed that Adams and Hancock were indeed at odds: when Adams formed the Boston Committee of Correspondence in November 1772 to advocate colonial rights, Hancock declined to join, creating the impression that there was a split in the Whig ranks. But whatever their differences, Hancock and Adams came together again in 1773 with the renewal of major political turmoil. They cooperated in the revelation of private letters of Thomas Hutchinson, in which the governor seemed to recommend &quot;an abridgement of what are called &quot;English liberties&quot; to bring order to the colony. The Massachusetts House, blaming Hutchinson for the military occupation of Boston, called for his removal as governor.

Even more trouble followed Parliament&#x27;s passage of the 1773 Tea Act. On November 5, Hancock was elected as moderator at a Boston town meeting that resolved that anyone who supported the Tea Act was an &quot;Enemy to America&quot;. Hancock and others tried to force the resignation of the agents who had been appointed to receive the tea shipments. Unsuccessful in this, they attempted to prevent the tea from being unloaded after three tea ships had arrived in Boston Harbor. Hancock was at the fateful meeting on December 16 where he reportedly told the crowd, &quot;Let every man do what is right in his own eyes.&quot; Hancock did not take part in the Boston Tea Party that night, but he approved of the action, although he was careful not to publicly praise the destruction of private property.

Over the next few months, Hancock was disabled by gout, which troubled him with increasing frequency in the coming years. By March 5, 1774, he had recovered enough to deliver the fourth annual Massacre Day oration, a commemoration of the Boston Massacre. Hancock&#x27;s speech denounced the presence of British troops in Boston, who he said had been sent there &quot;to enforce obedience to acts of Parliament, which neither God nor man ever empowered them to make&quot;. The speech, probably written by Hancock in collaboration with Adams, Joseph Warren, and others, was published and widely reprinted, enhancing Hancock&#x27;s stature as a leading Patriot.

==Revolution begins==

Parliament responded to the Tea Party with the Boston Port Act, one of the so-called Coercive Acts intended to strengthen British control of the colonies. Hutchinson was replaced as governor by General Thomas Gage, who arrived in May 1774. On June 17, the Massachusetts House elected five delegates to send to the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia, which was being organized to coordinate colonial response to the Coercive Acts. Hancock did not serve in the first Congress, possibly for health reasons or possibly to remain in charge while the other Patriot leaders were away.

Gage dismissed Hancock from his post as colonel of the Boston Cadets. In October 1774, Gage canceled the scheduled meeting of the General Court. In response, the House resolved itself into the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, a body independent of British control. Hancock was elected as president of the Provincial Congress and was a key member of the Committee of safety. The Provincial Congress created the first minutemen companies, consisting of militiamen who were to be ready for action on a moment&#x27;s notice.

On December 1, 1774, the Provincial Congress elected Hancock as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress to replace James Bowdoin, who had been unable to attend the first Congress because of illness. Before Hancock reported to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, the Provincial Congress unanimously re-elected him as their president in February 1775. Hancock&#x27;s multiple roles gave him enormous influence in Massachusetts, and as early as January 1774 British officials had considered arresting him. After attending the Provincial Congress in Concord in April 1775, Hancock and Samuel Adams decided that it was not safe to return to Boston before leaving for Philadelphia. They stayed instead at Hancock&#x27;s childhood home in Lexington.

Gage received a letter from Lord Dartmouth on April 14, 1775, advising him &quot;to arrest the principal actors and abettors in the Provincial Congress whose proceedings appear in every light to be acts of treason and rebellion&quot;. On the night of April 18, Gage sent out a detachment of soldiers on the fateful mission that sparked the American Revolutionary War. The purpose of the British expedition was to seize and destroy military supplies that the colonists had stored in Concord. According to many historical accounts, Gage also instructed his men to arrest Hancock and Adams; if so, the written orders issued by Gage made no mention of arresting the Patriot leaders. Gage apparently decided that he had nothing to gain by arresting Hancock and Adams, since other leaders would simply take their place, and the British would be portrayed as the aggressors.

Although Gage had evidently decided against seizing Hancock and Adams, Patriots initially believed otherwise. From Boston, Joseph Warren dispatched messenger Paul Revere to warn Hancock and Adams that British troops were on the move and might attempt to arrest them. Revere reached Lexington around midnight and gave the warning. Hancock, still considering himself a militia colonel, wanted to take the field with the Patriot militia at Lexington, but Adams and others convinced him to avoid battle, arguing that he was more valuable as a political leader than as a soldier. As Hancock and Adams made their escape, the first shots of the war were fired at Lexington and Concord. Soon after the battle, Gage issued a proclamation granting a general pardon to all who would &quot;lay down their arms, and return to the duties of peaceable subjects&quot;—with the exceptions of Hancock and Samuel Adams. Singling out Hancock and Adams in this manner only added to their renown among Patriots.

==President of Congress==

With the war underway, Hancock made his way to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia with the other Massachusetts delegates. On May 24, 1775, he was unanimously elected President of the Continental Congress, succeeding Peyton Randolph after Henry Middleton declined the nomination. Hancock was a good choice for president for several reasons. He was experienced, having often presided over legislative bodies and town meetings in Massachusetts. His wealth and social standing inspired the confidence of moderate delegates, while his association with Boston radicals made him acceptable to other radicals. His position was somewhat ambiguous because the role of the president was not fully defined, and it was not clear if Randolph had resigned or was on a leave of absence. Like other presidents of Congress, Hancock&#x27;s authority was mostly limited to that of a presiding officer. He also had to handle a great deal of official correspondence, and he found it necessary to hire clerks at his own expense to help with the paperwork.

In Congress on June 15, 1775, Massachusetts delegate John Adams nominated George Washington as commander-in-chief of the army then gathered around Boston. Years later, Adams wrote that Hancock had shown great disappointment at not getting the command for himself. This brief comment from 1801 is the only source for the oft-cited claim that Hancock sought to become commander-in-chief. In the early 20th century, historian James Truslow Adams wrote that the incident initiated a lifelong estrangement between Hancock and Washington, but some subsequent historians have expressed doubt that the incident, or the estrangement, ever occurred. According to historian Donald Proctor, &quot;There is no contemporary evidence that Hancock harbored ambitions to be named commander-in-chief. Quite the contrary.&quot; Hancock and Washington maintained a good relationship after the alleged incident, and in 1778 Hancock named his only son &quot;John George Washington Hancock&quot;. Hancock admired and supported General Washington, even though Washington politely declined Hancock&#x27;s request for a military appointment.

When Congress recessed on August 1, 1775, Hancock took the opportunity to wed his fiancée, Dorothy &quot;Dolly&quot; Quincy. The couple was married on August 28 in Fairfield, Connecticut. They had two children, neither of whom survived to adulthood. Their daughter Lydia Henchman Hancock was born in 1776 and died ten months later. Their son John was born in 1778 and died in 1787 after suffering a head injury while ice skating.

While president of Congress, Hancock became involved in a long-running controversy with Harvard. As treasurer of the college since 1773, he had been entrusted with the school&#x27;s financial records and about £15,000 in cash and securities. In the rush of events at the onset of the Revolutionary War, Hancock had been unable to return the money and accounts to Harvard before leaving for Congress. In 1777, a Harvard committee headed by James Bowdoin, Hancock&#x27;s chief political and social rival in Boston, sent a messenger to Philadelphia to retrieve the money and records. Hancock was offended, but he turned over more than £16,000, though not all of the records, to the college. When Harvard replaced Hancock as treasurer, his ego was bruised and for years he declined to settle the account or pay the interest on the money he had held, despite pressure put on him by Bowdoin and other political opponents. The issue dragged on until after Hancock&#x27;s death, when his estate finally paid the college more than £1,000 to resolve the matter.

Hancock served in Congress through some of the darkest days of the Revolutionary War. The British drove Washington from New York and New Jersey in 1776, which prompted Congress to flee to Baltimore. Hancock and Congress returned to Philadelphia in March 1777 but were compelled to flee six months later when the British occupied Philadelphia. Hancock wrote innumerable letters to colonial officials, raising money, supplies, and troops for Washington&#x27;s army. He chaired the Marine Committee and took pride in helping to create a small fleet of American frigates, including the USS &quot;Hancock&quot;, which was named in his honor.

===Signing the Declaration===

Hancock was president of Congress when the Declaration of Independence was adopted and signed. He is primarily remembered by Americans for his large, flamboyant signature on the Declaration, so much so that &quot;John Hancock&quot; became, in the United States, an informal synonym for &quot;signature&quot;. According to legend, Hancock signed his name largely and clearly so that King George could read it without his spectacles, but the story is apocryphal and originated years later.

Contrary to popular mythology, there was no ceremonial signing of the Declaration on July 4, 1776. After Congress approved the wording of the text on July 4, the &quot;fair copy&quot; was sent to be printed. As president, Hancock may have signed the document that was sent to the printer John Dunlap, but this is uncertain because that document is lost, perhaps destroyed in the printing process. Dunlap produced the first published version of the Declaration, the widely distributed Dunlap broadside. Hancock, as President of Congress, was the only delegate whose name appeared on the broadside, although the name of Charles Thomson, secretary of the Continental Congress but not a delegate, was also on it as &quot;Attested by&quot; implying that Hancock had signed the fair copy. This meant that until a second broadside was issued six months later with all of the signers listed, Hancock was the only delegate whose name was publicly attached to the treasonous document. Hancock sent a copy of the Dunlap broadside to George Washington, instructing him to have it read to the troops &quot;in the way you shall think most proper&quot;.

Hancock&#x27;s name was printed, not signed, on the Dunlap broadside; his iconic signature appears on a different document—a sheet of parchment that was carefully handwritten sometime after July 19 and signed on August 2 by Hancock and those delegates present. Known as the engrossed copy, this is the famous document on display at the National Archives in Washington, D.C.

==Return to Massachusetts==

In October 1777, after more than two years in Congress, Hancock requested a leave of absence. He asked Washington to arrange a military escort for his return to Boston. Although Washington was short on manpower, he nevertheless sent fifteen horsemen to accompany Hancock on his journey home. By this time Hancock had become estranged from Samuel Adams, who disapproved of what he viewed as Hancock&#x27;s vanity and extravagance, which Adams believed were inappropriate in a republican leader. When Congress voted to thank Hancock for his service, Adams and the other Massachusetts delegates voted against the resolution, as did a few delegates from other states.

Back in Boston, Hancock was re-elected to the House of Representatives. As in previous years, his philanthropy made him popular. Although his finances had suffered greatly because of the war, he gave to the poor, helped support widows and orphans, and loaned money to friends. According to biographer William Fowler, &quot;John Hancock was a generous man and the people loved him for it. He was their idol.&quot; In December 1777, he was re-elected as a delegate to the Continental Congress and as moderator of the Boston town meeting.
Hancock rejoined the Continental Congress in Pennsylvania in June 1778, but his brief time there was unhappy. In his absence, Congress had elected Henry Laurens as its new president, which was a disappointment to Hancock, who had hoped to reclaim his chair. Hancock got along poorly with Samuel Adams and missed his wife and newborn son. On July 9, 1778, Hancock and the other Massachusetts delegates joined the representatives from seven other states in signing the Articles of Confederation; the remaining states were not yet prepared to sign, and the Articles were not ratified until 1781.

Hancock returned to Boston in July 1778, motivated by the opportunity to finally lead men in combat. Back in 1776, he had been appointed as the senior major general of the Massachusetts militia. Now that the French fleet had come to the aid of the Americans, General Washington instructed General John Sullivan to lead an attack on the British garrison at Newport, Rhode Island, in August 1778. Hancock nominally commanded 6,000 militiamen in the campaign, although he let the professional soldiers do the planning and issue the orders. It was a fiasco: French Admiral d&#x27;Estaing abandoned the operation, after which Hancock&#x27;s militia mostly deserted Sullivan&#x27;s Continentals. Hancock suffered some criticism for the debacle but emerged from his brief military career with his popularity intact.

After much delay, the Massachusetts Constitution finally went into effect in October 1780. To no one&#x27;s surprise, Hancock was elected Governor of Massachusetts in a landslide, garnering over 90% of the vote. In the absence of formal party politics, the contest was one of personality, popularity, and patriotism. Hancock was immensely popular and unquestionably patriotic given his personal sacrifices and his leadership of the Second Continental Congress. Bowdoin, his principal opponent, was cast by Hancock&#x27;s supporters as unpatriotic, citing among other things his refusal (which was due to poor health) to serve in the First Continental Congress. Bowdoin&#x27;s supporters, who were principally well-off commercial interests from Massachusetts coastal communities, cast Hancock as a foppish demagogue who pandered to the populace.

Hancock governed Massachusetts through the end of the Revolutionary War and into an economically troubled postwar period, repeatedly winning re-election by wide margins. Hancock took a hands-off approach to governing, avoiding controversial issues as much as possible. According to William Fowler, Hancock &quot;never really led&quot; and &quot;never used his strength to deal with the critical issues confronting the commonwealth.&quot; Hancock governed until his surprise resignation on January 29, 1785. Hancock cited his failing health as the reason, but he may have become aware of growing unrest in the countryside and wanted to get out of office before the trouble came.

Hancock&#x27;s critics sometimes believed that he used claims of illness to avoid difficult political situations. Historian James Truslow Adams writes that Hancock&#x27;s &quot;two chief resources were his money and his gout, the first always used to gain popularity, and the second to prevent his losing it&quot;. The turmoil that Hancock avoided ultimately blossomed as Shays&#x27; Rebellion, which Hancock&#x27;s successor Bowdoin had to deal with. After the uprising, Hancock was re-elected in 1787, and he promptly pardoned all the rebels. The next year, a controversy arose when three free blacks were kidnapped from Boston and sent to work as slaves in the French colony of Martinique in the West Indies. Governor Hancock wrote to the governors of the islands on their behalf. As a result, the three men were released and returned to Massachusetts. Hancock was re-elected to annual terms as governor for the remainder of his life.

==Final years==

When he had resigned as governor in 1785, Hancock was again elected as a delegate to Congress, known as the Confederation Congress after the ratification of the Articles of Confederation in 1781. Congress had declined in importance after the Revolutionary War and was frequently ignored by the states. Hancock was elected to serve as its president on November 23, 1785, but he never attended because of his poor health and because he was disinterested. He sent Congress a letter of resignation in June 1786.

In an effort to remedy the perceived defects of the Articles of Confederation, delegates were first sent to the Annapolis Convention in 1786 and then to the Philadelphia Convention in 1787, where they drafted the United States Constitution, which was then sent to the states for ratification or rejection. Hancock, who was not present at the Philadelphia Convention, had misgivings about the Constitution&#x27;s lack of a bill of rights and its shift of power to a central government. In January 1788, Hancock was elected president of the Massachusetts ratifying convention, although he was ill and not present when the convention began. Hancock mostly remained silent during the contentious debates, but as the convention was drawing to close, he gave a speech in favor of ratification. For the first time in years, Samuel Adams supported Hancock&#x27;s position. Even with the support of Hancock and Adams, the Massachusetts convention narrowly ratified the Constitution by a vote of 187 to 168. Hancock&#x27;s support was probably a deciding factor in the ratification.

Hancock was put forth as a candidate in the 1789 U.S. presidential election. As was the custom in an era where political ambition was viewed with suspicion, Hancock did not campaign or even publicly express interest in the office; he instead made his wishes known indirectly. Like everyone else, Hancock knew that Washington was going to be elected as the first president, but Hancock may have been interested in being vice president, despite his poor health. Hancock received only four electoral votes in the election, however, none of them from his home state; the Massachusetts electors all voted for John Adams, who received the second-highest number of electoral votes and thus became vice president. Although Hancock was disappointed with his performance in the election, he continued to be popular in Massachusetts.

His health failing, Hancock spent his final few years as essentially a figurehead governor. With his wife at his side, he died in bed on October 8, 1793, at age 56. By order of acting governor Samuel Adams, the day of Hancock&#x27;s burial was a state holiday; the lavish funeral was perhaps the grandest given to an American up to that time.

==Legacy==
Despite his grand funeral, Hancock faded from popular memory after his death. According to historian Alfred F. Young, &quot;Boston celebrated only one hero in the half-century after the Revolution: George Washington.&quot; As early as 1809, John Adams lamented that Hancock and Samuel Adams were &quot;almost buried in oblivion&quot;. In Boston, little effort was made to preserve Hancock&#x27;s historical legacy. His house on Beacon Hill was torn down in 1863 after both the city of Boston and the Massachusetts legislature decided against maintaining it. According to Young, the conservative &quot;new elite&quot; of Massachusetts &quot;was not comfortable with a rich man who pledged his fortune to the cause of revolution&quot;. In 1876, with the centennial of American independence renewing popular interest in the Revolution, plaques honoring Hancock were put up in Boston. In 1896, a memorial column was erected over Hancock&#x27;s essentially unmarked grave in the Granary Burying Ground.

No full-length biography of Hancock appeared until the 20th century. A challenge facing Hancock biographers is that, compared to prominent Founding Fathers like Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, Hancock left relatively few personal writings for historians to use in interpreting his life. As a result, most depictions of Hancock have relied on the voluminous writings of his political opponents, who were often scathingly critical of him. According to historian Charles Akers, &quot;The chief victim of Massachusetts historiography has been John Hancock, the most gifted and popular politician in the Bay State&#x27;s long history. He suffered the misfortune of being known to later generations almost entirely through the judgments of his detractors, Tory and Whig.&quot;

Hancock&#x27;s most influential 20th-century detractor was historian James Truslow Adams, who wrote negative portraits of Hancock in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and the &quot;Dictionary of American Biography&quot; in the 1930s. Adams argued that Hancock was a &quot;fair presiding officer&quot; but had &quot;no great ability&quot;, and was prominent only because of his inherited wealth. Decades later, historian Donald Proctor argued that Adams had uncritically repeated the negative views of Hancock&#x27;s political opponents without doing any serious research. Adams &quot;presented a series of disparaging incidents and anecdotes, sometimes partially documented, sometimes not documented at all, which in sum leave one with a distinctly unfavorable impression of Hancock&quot;. According to Proctor, Adams evidently projected his own disapproval of 1920s businessmen onto Hancock and ended up misrepresenting several key events in Hancock&#x27;s career. Writing in the 1970s, Proctor and Akers called for scholars to evaluate Hancock based on his merits rather than on the views of his critics. Since that time, historians have usually presented a more favorable portrait of Hancock while acknowledging that he was not an important writer, political theorist, or military leader.

Many places and things in the United States have been named in honor of Hancock. The U.S. Navy has named vessels USS &quot;Hancock&quot; and USS &quot;John Hancock&quot;; a World War II Liberty ship was also named in his honor. Ten states have a Hancock County named for him; other places named after him include Hancock, Massachusetts; Hancock, Michigan; Hancock, New Hampshire; Hancock, New York; and Mount Hancock in New Hampshire. The defunct John Hancock University was named for him, as was the John Hancock Financial company, founded in Boston in 1862; it had no connection to Hancock&#x27;s own business ventures. The financial company passed on the name to the John Hancock Tower in Boston, the John Hancock Center in Chicago, as well as the John Hancock Student Village at Boston University. Hancock was a charter member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780.

<text>John Wood Campbell Jr. (June 8, 1910 – July 11, 1971) was an American science fiction writer and editor. He was editor of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; (later called &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot;) from late 1937 until his death and was part of the Golden Age of Science Fiction. Campbell wrote super-science space opera under his own name and stories under his primary pseudonym, Don A. Stuart. Campbell also used the pen names Karl Van Kampen and Arthur McCann. His novella &quot;Who Goes There?&quot; (1938) was adapted as the films &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; (1951), &quot;The Thing&quot; (1982), and &quot;The Thing&quot; (2011).

Campbell began writing science fiction at age 18 while attending MIT. He published six short stories, one novel, and eight letters in the science fiction magazine &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; from 1930 to 1931. This work established Campbell&#x27;s reputation as a writer of space adventure. When in 1934 he began to write stories with a different tone, he wrote as Don A. Stuart. From 1930 until 1937, Campbell was prolific and successful under both names; he stopped writing fiction shortly after he became editor of &quot;Astounding&quot; in 1937. In his capacity as an editor, Campbell published some of the very earliest work, and helped shape the careers of virtually every important science-fiction author to debut between 1938 and 1946, including Isaac Asimov, Robert A. Heinlein, Theodore Sturgeon, and Arthur C. Clarke.

Shortly after his death in 1971, the University of Kansas science fiction program established the annual John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel and also renamed its annual Campbell Conference after him. The World Science Fiction Society established the annual John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer, since renamed the Astounding Award for Best New Writer. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Campbell in 1996, in its inaugural class of two deceased and two living persons.

== Biography ==
John Campbell was born in Newark, New Jersey, in 1910. His father, John Wood Campbell Sr., was an electrical engineer. His mother, Dorothy (née Strahern) had an identical twin who visited them often. John was unable to tell them apart and said he was frequently rebuffed by the person he took to be his mother. Campbell attended the Blair Academy, a boarding school in rural Warren County, New Jersey, but did not graduate because of lack of credits for French and trigonometry.
He also attended, without graduating, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he was befriended by the mathematician Norbert Wiener (who coined the term &quot;cybernetics&quot;) – but he failed German. MIT dismissed him in his junior year in 1931. After two years at Duke University, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in physics in 1934.

Campbell began writing science fiction at age 18 while attending MIT and sold his first stories quickly. From January 1930 to June 1931, &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; published six of his short stories, one novel, and six letters. Campbell was editor of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; (later called &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot;) from late 1937 until his death. Between December 11, 1957, and June 13, 1958, he hosted a weekly science fiction radio program called &quot;Exploring Tomorrow&quot;. The scripts were written by authors such as Gordon R. Dickson and Robert Silverberg.

Campbell and Doña Stewart married in 1931. They divorced in 1949, and he married Margaret (Peg) Winter in 1950. He spent most of his life in New Jersey and died of heart failure at his home in Mountainside, New Jersey. He was an atheist.

=== Writing career ===
Editor T. O&#x27;Conor Sloane lost Campbell&#x27;s first manuscript that he accepted for &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, entitled &quot;Invaders of the Infinite&quot;. &quot;When the Atoms Failed&quot; appeared in January 1930, followed by five more during 1930. Three were part of a space opera series featuring the characters Arcot, Morey, and Wade. A complete novel in the series, &quot;Islands of Space&quot;, was the cover story in the Spring 1931 &quot;Quarterly&quot;. During 1934–35 a serial novel, &quot;The Mightiest Machine&quot;, ran in &quot;Astounding Stories&quot;, edited by F. Orlin Tremaine, and several stories featuring lead characters Penton and Blake appeared from late 1936 in &quot;Thrilling Wonder Stories&quot;, edited by Mort Weisinger.

The early work for &quot;Amazing&quot; established Campbell&#x27;s reputation as a writer of space adventure. In 1934, he began to publish stories with a different tone using the pseudonym Don A. Stuart, which was derived from his wife&#x27;s maiden name. He published several stories under this pseudonym, including &quot;Twilight&quot; (&quot;Astounding&quot;, November 1934), &quot;Night&quot; (&quot;Astounding&quot;, October 1935), and &quot;Who Goes There?&quot; (&quot;Astounding&quot;, August 1938). &quot;Who Goes There?&quot;, about a group of Antarctic researchers who discover a crashed alien vessel, formerly inhabited by a malevolent shape-changing occupant, was published in &quot;Astounding&quot; almost a year after Campbell became its editor and it was his last significant piece of fiction, at age 28. It was filmed as &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; (1951), &quot;The Thing&quot; (1982), and again as &quot;The Thing&quot; (2011).

=== Editing career ===
Tremaine hired Campbell to succeed him as the editor of &quot;Astounding&quot; from its October 1937 issue. Campbell was not given full authority for &quot;Astounding&quot; until May 1938, but had been responsible for buying stories earlier. He began to make changes almost immediately, instigating a &quot;mutant&quot; label for unusual stories, and in March 1938, changing the title from &quot;Astounding Stories&quot; to &quot;Astounding Science-Fiction&quot;.

Lester del Rey&#x27;s first story in March 1938 was an early find for Campbell. In 1939, he published a group of new writers for the in the July 1939 issue of &quot;Astounding&quot;. The July issue contained A. E. van Vogt&#x27;s first story, &quot;Black Destroyer&quot;, and Asimov&#x27;s early story, &quot;Trends&quot;; August brought Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s first story, &quot;Life-Line&quot;, and the next month Theodore Sturgeon&#x27;s first story appeared.

Also in 1939, Campbell started the fantasy magazine &quot;Unknown&quot; (later &quot;Unknown Worlds&quot;). &quot;Unknown&quot; was canceled after four years due to wartime paper shortages.

Campbell died in 1971 at the age of 61 in Mountainside, New Jersey. At the time of his sudden death after 34 years at the helm of &quot;Analog,&quot; Campbell&#x27;s personality and editorial demands had alienated some of his writers to the point that they no longer submitted works to him. One of his writers, Theodore Sturgeon, opted to publish most of his works after 1950 and only submitted one story with &quot;Astounding&quot; during that same timeframe.

== Influence ==
&quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; wrote: &quot;More than any other individual, he helped to shape modern sf&quot;, and Darrell Schweitzer credits him with having &quot;decreed that SF writers should pull themselves up out of the pulp mire and start writing intelligently, for adults&quot;. After 1950, new magazines such as &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; and &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; moved in different directions and developed talented new writers who were not directly influenced by him. Campbell often suggested story ideas to writers (including &quot;Write me a creature that thinks &quot;as well as&quot; a man, or &quot;better than&quot; a man, but not &quot;like&quot; a man&quot;) and sometimes asked for stories to match cover paintings he had already bought.

Campbell had a strong formative influence on Asimov and eventually became a friend. Asimov credited Campbell with encouraging developments within the field of science fiction field by forgoing conventional plot points and requiring its writers to &quot;understand science and understand people.&quot; He also called Campbell &quot;the most powerful force in science fiction ever&quot; and said the &quot;first ten years of his editorship he dominated the field completely.&quot; 

Campbell encouraged Cleve Cartmill to write &quot;Deadline&quot;, a short story by that appeared during the wartime year of 1944, a year before the detonation of the first atomic bomb. As Ben Bova, Campbell&#x27;s successor as editor at &quot;Analog&quot;, wrote, it &quot;described the basic facts of how to build an atomic bomb. Cartmill and Campbell worked together on the story, drawing their scientific information from papers published in the technical journals before the war. To them, the mechanics of constructing a uranium-fission bomb seemed perfectly obvious.&quot; The FBI descended on Campbell&#x27;s office after the story appeared in print and demanded that the issue be removed from the newsstands. Campbell convinced them that by removing the magazine &quot;the FBI would be advertising to everyone that such a project existed and was aimed at developing nuclear weapons&quot; and the demand was dropped.

Campbell was also responsible for the grim and controversial ending of Tom Godwin&#x27;s short story &quot;The Cold Equations&quot;. Writer Joe Green recounted that Campbell had rejected Godwin&#x27;s &#x27;Cold Equations&#x27; on three different occasions due to disagreements over the fate of the female protagonist.

Between December 11, 1957, and June 13, 1958, Campbell hosted a weekly science fiction radio program called &quot;Exploring Tomorrow&quot;.

==Views==
===Slavery, race, and segregation===
Green wrote that Campbell &quot;enjoyed taking the &#x27;devil&#x27;s advocate&#x27; position in almost any area, willing to defend even viewpoints with which he disagreed if that led to a livelier debate&quot;. As an example, he wrote:

[Campbell] pointed out that the much-maligned &#x27;peculiar institution&#x27; of slavery in the American South had in fact provided the blacks brought there with a higher standard of living than they had in Africa ... I suspected, from comments by Asimov, among others – and some &quot;Analog&quot; editorials I had read – that John held some racist views, at least in regard to blacks.

Finally, however, Green agreed with Campbell that &quot;rapidly increasing mechanization after 1850 would have soon rendered slavery obsolete anyhow. It would have been better for the USA to endure it a few more years than suffer the truly horrendous costs of the Civil War.&quot;

In a June 1961 editorial called &quot;Civil War Centennial&quot;, Campbell argued that slavery had been a dominant form of human relationships for most of history and that the present was unusual in that anti-slavery cultures dominated the planet. He wrote

It&#x27;s my bet that the South would have been integrated by 1910. The job would have been done – and done right – half a century sooner, with vastly less human misery, and with almost no bloodshed ... The only way slavery has ever been ended, anywhere, is by introducing industry ... If a man is a skilled and competent machinist – if the lathes work well under his hands – the industrial management will be forced, to remain in business, to accept that fact, whether the man be black, white, purple, or polka-dotted.

According to Michael Moorcock, Campbell suggested that some people preferred slavery.

He also, when faced with the Watts riots of the mid-sixties, seriously proposed and went on to proposing that there were &#x27;natural&#x27; slaves who were unhappy if freed. I sat on a panel with him in 1965, as he pointed out that the worker bee when unable to work dies of misery, that the moujiks when freed went to their masters and begged to be enslaved again, that the ideals of the anti-slavers who fought in the Civil War were merely expressions of self-interest and that the blacks were &#x27;against&#x27; emancipation, which was fundamentally why they were indulging in &#x27;leaderless&#x27; riots in the suburbs of Los Angeles.

By the 1960s, Campbell began to publish controversial essays supporting segregation and other remarks and writings surrounding slavery and race, which distance him from many in the science fiction community. In 1963, Campbell published an essay supporting segregated schools and arguing that &quot;the Negro race&quot; had failed to &quot;produce super-high-geniuses&quot;. In 1965, he continued his defense of segregation and related practices, critiquing &quot;the arrogant defiance of law by many of the Negro &#x27;Civil Rights&#x27; groups&quot;. On February 10, 1967, Campbell rejected Samuel R. Delany&#x27;s &quot;Nova&quot; a month before it was ultimately published, with a note and phone call to his agent explaining that he did not feel his readership &quot;would be able to relate to a black main character&quot;.

All these views were reflected in the depiction of aliens in &quot;Astounding&quot;/&quot;Analog&quot;. Throughout his editorship, Campbell demanded that depiction of contact between aliens and humans must favor humans. For example, Campbell accepted Isaac Asimov&#x27;s proposal for what would become &quot;Homo Sol&quot; (where humans rejected an invitation to join a galactic federation) in January 1940, which was published later that year in the September edition of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;. Similarly, Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Rescue Party&quot; and Fredric Brown&#x27;s &quot;Arena&quot; (basis of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode of the same name) and &quot;Letter to a Phoenix&quot; (all first appeared in &quot;Astounding&quot;) also depict humans favorably above aliens.

=== Medicine and health ===
Campbell was a critic of government regulation of health and safety, excoriating numerous public health initiatives and regulations.

Campbell was a heavy smoker throughout his life and was seldom seen without his customary cigarette holder. In the &quot;Analog&quot; of September 1964, nine months after the Surgeon General&#x27;s first major warning about the dangers of cigarette smoking had been issued (January 11, 1964) Campbell ran an editorial, &quot;A Counterblaste to Tobacco&quot; that took its title from the anti-smoking book of the same name by King James I of England. In it, he stated that the connection to lung cancer was &quot;esoteric&quot; and referred to &quot;a barely determinable possible correlation between cigarette smoking and cancer&quot;. He said that tobacco&#x27;s calming effects led to more effective thinking. In a one-page piece about automobile safety in &quot;Analog&quot; dated May 1967, Campbell wrote of &quot;people suddenly becoming conscious of the fact that cars kill more people than cigarettes do, even if the antitobacco alarmists were completely right...&quot;

In 1963, Campbell published an angry editorial about Frances Oldham Kelsey who, while at the FDA, refused to permit thalidomide to be sold in the United States.

In other essays, Campbell supported crank medicine, arguing that government regulation was more harmful than beneficial and that regulating quackery prevented the use of many possible beneficial medicines (&quot;e.g.&quot;, krebiozen).

=== Pseudoscience, parapsychology, and politics ===
In the 1930s, Campbell became interested in Joseph Rhine&#x27;s theories about ESP (Rhine had already founded the Parapsychology Laboratory at Duke University when Campbell was a student there), and over the following years his growing interest in parapsychology would be reflected in the stories he published when he encouraged the writers to include these topics in their tales, leading to the publication of numerous works about telepathy and other &quot;psionic&quot; abilities. This post-war &quot;psi-boom&quot; has been dated by science fiction scholars to roughly the mid-1950s to the early 1960s, and continues to influence many popular culture tropes and motifs. Campbell rejected the Shaver Mystery in which the author claimed to have had a personal experience with a sinister ancient civilization that harbored fantastic technology in caverns under the earth.

His increasing beliefs in pseudoscience would eventually start to isolate and alienate him from some of his writers, including Asimov. He wrote favorably about such things as the &quot;Dean drive&quot;, a device that supposedly produced thrust in violation of Newton&#x27;s third law, and the &quot;Hieronymus machine&quot;, which could supposedly amplify psi powers.

In 1949, Campbell worked closely with L. Ron Hubbard on the techniques that Hubbard later turned into Dianetics. When Hubbard&#x27;s therapy failed to find support from the medical community, Campbell published the earliest forms of Dianetics in &quot;Astounding&quot;. He wrote of L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s initial article in &quot;Astounding&quot; that &quot;[i]t is, I assure you in full and absolute sincerity, one of the most important articles ever published.&quot;

Campbell continued to promote Hubbard&#x27;s theories until 1952, when the pair split acrimoniously over the direction of the movement.

Asimov wrote: &quot;A number of writers wrote pseudoscientific stuff to ensure sales to Campbell, but the best writers retreated, I among them. ...&quot; Elsewhere Asimov went on to further explain

Campbell championed far-out ideas ... He pained very many of the men he had trained (including me) in doing so, but felt it was his duty to stir up the minds of his readers and force curiosity right out to the border lines. He began a series of editorials ... in which he championed a social point of view that could sometimes be described as far right (he expressed sympathy for George Wallace in the 1968 national election, for instance). There was bitter opposition to this from many (including me – I could hardly ever read a Campbell editorial and keep my temper).

== Assessment by peers ==
Damon Knight described Campbell as a &quot;portly, bristled-haired blond man with a challenging stare&quot;. &quot;Six-foot-one, with hawklike features, he presented a formidable appearance,&quot; said Sam Moskowitz. &quot;He was a tall, large man with light hair, a beaky nose, a wide face with thin lips, and with a cigarette in a holder forever clamped between his teeth&quot;, wrote Asimov.

Algis Budrys wrote that &quot;John W. Campbell was the greatest editor SF has seen or is likely to see, and is in fact one of the major editors in all English-language literature in the middle years of the twentieth century. All about you is the heritage of what he built&quot;.

Asimov said that Campbell was &quot;talkative, opinionated, quicksilver-minded, overbearing. Talking to him meant listening to a monologue...&quot; Knight agreed: &quot;Campbell&#x27;s lecture-room manner was so unpleasant to me that I was unwilling to face it. Campbell talked a good deal more than he listened, and he liked to say outrageous things.&quot;

British novelist and critic Kingsley Amis dismissed Campbell brusquely: &quot;I might just add as a sociological note that the editor of &quot;Astounding,&quot; himself a deviant figure of marked ferocity, seems to think he has invented a psi machine.&quot;

Several science-fiction novelists have criticized Campbell as prejudiced – Samuel R. Delany for Campbell&#x27;s rejection of a novel due to the black main character, and Joe Haldeman in the dedication of &quot;Forever Peace&quot;, for rejecting a novel due to a female soldier protagonist.

British science-fiction novelist Michael Moorcock, as part of his &quot;Starship Stormtroopers&quot; editorial, said Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Astounding&quot; and its writers were &quot;wild-eyed paternalists to a man, fierce anti-socialists&quot; with &quot;[stories] full of crew-cut wisecracking, cigar-chewing, competent guys (like Campbell&#x27;s image of himself)&quot;; they sold magazines because their &quot;work reflected the deep-seated conservatism of the majority of their readers, who saw a Bolshevik menace in every union meeting&quot;. He viewed Campbell as turning the magazine into a vessel for right-wing politics, &quot;by the early 1950s ... a crypto-fascist deeply philistine magazine pretending to intellectualism and offering idealistic kids an &#x27;alternative&#x27; that was, of course, no alternative at all&quot;.

SF writer Alfred Bester, an editor of &quot;Holiday Magazine&quot; and a sophisticated Manhattanite, recounted at some length his &quot;one demented meeting&quot; with Campbell, a man he imagined from afar to be &quot;a combination of Bertrand Russell and Ernest Rutherford&quot;. The first thing Campbell said to him was that Freud was dead, destroyed by the new discovery of Dianetics, which, he predicted, would win L. Ron Hubbard the Nobel Peace Prize. Campbell ordered the bemused Bester to &quot;think back. Clear yourself. Remember! You can remember when your mother tried to abort you with a button hook. You&#x27;ve never stopped hating her for it.&quot; Bester commented: &quot;It reinforced my private opinion that a majority of the science-fiction crowd, despite their brilliance, were missing their marbles.&quot;

Asimov remained grateful for Campbell&#x27;s early friendship and support. He dedicated &quot;The Early Asimov&quot; (1972) to him, and concluded it by stating that &quot;There is no way at all to express how much he meant to me and how much he did for me except, perhaps, to write this book evoking, once more, those days of a quarter century ago&quot;. His final word on Campbell was that &quot;in the last twenty years of his life, he was only a diminishing shadow of what he had once been.&quot; Even Heinlein, perhaps Campbell&#x27;s most important discovery and a &quot;fast friend&quot;, tired of him.

Poul Anderson wrote that Campbell &quot;had saved and regenerated science fiction&quot;, which had become &quot;the product of hack pulpsters&quot; when he took over &quot;Astounding&quot;. &quot;By his editorial policies and the help and encouragement he gave his writers (always behind the scenes), he raised both the literary and the intellectual standard anew. Whatever progress has been made stems from that renaissance&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
Campbell and &quot;Astounding&quot; shared one of the inaugural Hugo Awards with H. L. Gold and &quot;Galaxy&quot; at the 1953 World Science Fiction Convention. Subsequently, Campbell and &quot;Astounding&quot; won the Hugo Award for Best Professional Editor seven additional times as well as winning the Hugo Award for Best Professional Magazine four times. Campbell and &quot;Analog&quot; won the Hugo Award for Best Professional Magazine yet another four times and Campbell&#x27;s novella &quot;Who Goes There?&quot; also won a Hugo Award for Best Novella, bringing his total award count to seventeen.

Shortly after Campbell&#x27;s death, the University of Kansas science fiction program—now the Center for the Study of Science Fiction—established the annual John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel and also renamed after him its annual Campbell Conference. The World Science Fiction Society established the annual John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer. All three memorials became effective in 1973. However, following Jeannette Ng&#x27;s August 2019 acceptance speech of the award for Best New Writer at Worldcon 77, in which she criticized Campbell&#x27;s politics and called him a fascist, the publishers of &quot;Analog&quot; magazine announced that the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer would immediately be renamed to &quot;The &quot;Astounding&quot; Award for Best New Writer&quot;.

The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Campbell in 1996, in its inaugural class of two deceased and two living persons.

Campbell and &quot;Astounding&quot; shared one of the inaugural Hugo Awards with H. L. Gold and &quot;Galaxy&quot; at the 1953 World Science Fiction Convention. Subsequently, he won the Hugo Award for Best Professional Magazine seven times to 1965. In 2018, he won a retrospective Hugo Award for Best Editor, Short Form (1943).

The Martian impact crater Campbell was named after him.

<doc id="16327" wikidata="Q25269" url="?curid=16327" title="Joule">
<text>The joule ( , or ; symbol: J) is the unit of energy in the International System of Units (SI). In terms of SI base units, one joule corresponds to one kilogram-square metre per square second One joule is equal to the amount of work done when a force of one newton displaces a body through a distance of one metre in the direction of that force. It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second. It is named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule (1818–1889).

== Definition ==
In terms of SI base units and in terms of SI derived units with special names, the joule is defined as

One joule is also equivalent to any of the following:
* The work required to move an electric charge of one coulomb through an electrical potential difference of one volt, or one coulomb-volt (C⋅V). This relationship can be used to define the volt.
* The work required to produce one watt of power for one second, or one watt-second (W⋅s) (compare kilowatt-hour, which is 3.6 megajoules). This relationship can be used to define the watt.

== History ==
The CGS system had been declared official in 1881, at the first International Electrical Congress.
The erg was adopted as its unit of energy in 1882. Wilhelm Siemens, in his inauguration speech as chairman of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (23 August 1882) first proposed the &quot;joule&quot; as unit of heat, to be derived from the electromagnetic units ampere and ohm, in cgs units equivalent to .
The naming of the unit in honour of James Prescott Joule (1818–1889), at the time retired and aged 63, followed the recommendation of Siemens:

At the second International Electrical Congress, on 31 August 1889, the joule was officially adopted alongside the watt and the &quot;quadrant&quot; (later renamed to henry).
Joule died in the same year, on 11 October 1889.
At the fourth congress (1893), the &quot;international ampere&quot; and &quot;international ohm&quot; were defined, with slight changes in the specifications for their measurement, with the &quot;international joule&quot; being the unit derived from them.

In 1935, the International Electrotechnical Commission (as the successor organisation of the International Electrical Congress) adopted the &quot;Giorgi system&quot;, which by virtue of assuming a defined value for the magnetic constant also implied a redefinition of the joule. The Giorgi system was approved by the International Committee for Weights and Measures in 1946. The joule was now no longer defined based on electromagnetic unit, but instead as the unit of work performed by one unit of force (at the time not yet named newton) over the distance of 1 metre. The joule was explicitly intended as the unit of energy to be used in both electromagnetic and mechanical contexts. The ratification of the definition at the ninth General Conference on Weights and Measures, in 1948, added the specification that the joule was also to be preferred as the unit of heat in the context of calorimetry, thereby officially deprecating the use of the calorie. This is the definition declared in the modern International System of Units in 1960.

The definition of the joule as J = kg⋅m2⋅s−2 has remained unchanged since 1946, but the joule as a derived unit has inherited changes in the definitions of the second (in 1960 and 1967), the metre (in 1983) and the kilogram (in 2019).

== Practical examples ==
One joule represents (approximately):
* The typical energy released as heat by a person at rest every 1/60 s (~, basal metabolic rate); about / day.
* The amount of electricity required to run a device for .
* The energy required to accelerate a mass at through a distance of .
* The kinetic energy of a mass travelling at , or a mass travelling at .
* The energy required to lift an apple up 1 m, assuming the apple has a mass of 101.97 g.
* The heat required to raise the temperature of 0.239 g of water from 0 °C to 1 °C.
* The kinetic energy of a human moving very slowly ().
* The kinetic energy of a tennis ball moving at .
* The food energy (kcal) in slightly more than half of an ordinary-sized sugar crystal (/crystal).

== Newton-metre and torque ==
In mechanics, the concept of force (in some direction) has a close analogue in the concept of torque (about some angle):

A result of this similarity is that the SI unit for torque is the newton-metre, which works out algebraically to have the same dimensions as the joule, but they are not interchangeable. The General Conference on Weights and Measures has given the unit of energy the name &quot;joule&quot;, but has not given the unit of torque any special name, hence it is simply the newton-metre (N⋅m) – a compound name derived from its constituent parts. The use of newton-metres for torque but joules for energy is helpful to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunication.

The distinction may be seen also in the fact that energy is a scalar quantity – the dot product of a force vector and a displacement vector. By contrast, torque is a vector – the cross product of a force vector and a distance vector. Torque and energy are related to one another by the equation
formula_1

where &quot;E&quot; is energy, &quot;τ&quot; is (the vector magnitude of) torque, and &quot;θ&quot; is the angle swept (in radians). Since plane angles are dimensionless, it follows that torque and energy have the same dimensions.

== Watt-second ==
A watt-second (symbol W s or W⋅s) is a derived unit of energy equivalent to the joule. The watt-second is the energy equivalent to the power of one watt sustained for one second. While the watt-second is equivalent to the joule in both units and meaning, there are some contexts in which the term &quot;watt-second&quot; is used instead of &quot;joule&quot;, such as in the rating of photographic electronic flash units.
