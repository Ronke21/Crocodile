<text>Josef Antonius Heinrich Terboven (23 May 1898 – 8 May 1945) was a German Nazi Party official and politician who was the long-serving &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Gau Essen and the &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; for Norway during the German occupation.

Terboven was born in Essen, Germany, and attended &quot;Volksschule&quot; and &quot;Realschule&quot; before he volunteered for military service during the First World War. After the war, he studied law and political science at the University of Munich and the University of Freiburg, where he first got involved in politics. Terboven joined the Nazi Party in 1923, participated in the Beer Hall Putsch and eventually rose through the ranks to become the &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Essen and the editor of various Nazi newspapers. After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Terboven was promoted to &quot;SA-Gruppenführer&quot; and was made a member of the Prussian State Council.

In 1940, he was appointed &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; for Norway, a position that granted him significant power and control. Terboven established multiple concentration camps in Norway, ruthlessly persecuted the Jewish population and focused on crushing the Norwegian resistance movement. His actions led to numerous atrocities, such as the Beisfjord massacre in which hundreds of Yugoslavian political prisoners and prisoners-of-war were murdered.

As the tide of the war turned against Germany, Terboven implemented a scorched earth policy in northern Norway that resulted in the forced evacuation of 50,000 Norwegians and widespread destruction. He hoped to turn Norway into a fortress for the Nazi regime&#x27;s last stand. However, after Adolf Hitler&#x27;s suicide, his successor, &quot;Großadmiral&quot; Karl Dönitz, dismissed Terboven from his post as &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; on 7 May 1945.

On 8 May 1945, the day of Germany&#x27;s surrender, Terboven died of suicide by detonating 50 kg of dynamite in a bunker on the Skaugum compound in Norway. His family survived in West Germany, and his wife, Ilse (Stahl) Terboven died in 1972.

==Early life==
Terboven was born in Essen, the son of minor landed gentry of Dutch descent. The family name comes from the Low German &quot;daar boven&quot; (&quot;up there&quot;), referring to a farmstead on a hill. Josef Terboven attended &quot;Volksschule&quot; and &quot;Realschule&quot; in Essen until 1915 and then volunteered for military service in the First World War. He served with &quot;Feldartillerie Regiment&quot; 9 and then with the nascent air force. He was awarded the Iron Cross, 1st and 2nd class, and attained the rank of &quot;Leutnant&quot; before being discharged on 22 December 1918. He studied law and political science at the University of Munich and the University of Freiburg, where he first got involved in politics. He dropped out of the university in 1922 without earning a degree and trained as a bank official in Essen, working as a bank clerk through June 1925.

==Nazi Party career==
Terboven joined the Nazi Party in November 1923 with membership number 25,247 and participated in the abortive Beer Hall Putsch in Munich. As an early Party member, he later would be awarded the Golden Party Badge. When the Party subsequently was outlawed, he continued to work at the bank until after the ban was lifted in February 1925. In August 1925 Terboven went to work full-time for the Party, becoming the head of a small Nazi newspaper and book distributorship in Essen. At this time he also founded the &quot;Ortsgruppe&quot; (Local Group) in Essen, becoming its first &quot;Ortsgruppenleiter&quot;. He also joined the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) becoming the SA-&quot;Führer&quot; in Essen. He formally re-enrolled in the Party on 15 December 1925. By 1927, he had advanced to &quot;Bezirksleiter&quot; (District Leader) of the Essen district in the &quot;Großgau&quot; Ruhr. From 1927 to December 1930, Terboven was the editor of the weekly Nazi newspaper &quot;The New Front: The Weekly Sheet of the Working People.&quot; In 1929, he was sentenced to three months imprisonment for continuing to publish the proscribed paper. In the 20 May 1928 election, Terboven failed in his attempt to be elected to the Prussian Landtag.
On 1 October 1928 upon the dissolution of the &quot;Großgau&quot; Ruhr, the Essen district became an independent unit subordinated to the central Party headquarters in Munich. However, on 1 August 1930 the Essen district officially was raised to Gau status and Terboven was named &quot;Gauleiter&quot;. He would retain this post throughout the Nazi regime.

In 1930, Terboven also became a City Councilor in Essen and a member of the Provincial &quot;Landtag&quot; of the Rhine Province until it was dissolved in 1933. On 14 September 1930, Terboven was elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; from electoral constituency 23, Dusseldorf-West; he would serve as a &quot;Reichstag&quot; deputy until the end of the Nazi regime. From 15 December 1930, Terboven was also the editor of the &quot;National-Zeiting in Essen&quot;.

After the Nazi seizure of power, Terboven was promoted to SA-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; on 1 March 1933 and made a member of the Prussian State Council on 10 July 1933. On 28 June 1934, Terboven married Ilse Stahl, Joseph Goebbels&#x27;s former secretary and mistress. Adolf Hitler was a witness at the wedding, and while in Essen put into play preparations for the Night of the Long Knives. On 5 February 1935, Terboven was appointed &quot;Oberpräsident&quot; (High President) of Prussia&#x27;s Rhine Province which included Gau Essen and three other Gaue. He thus united under his control the highest party and governmental offices within his jurisdiction. On 27 April 1935 Terboven received the Golden Party Badge. He was promoted to the rank of SA-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; on 9 November 1936. On the outbreak of war on 1 September 1939, he was named Reich Defense Commissioner for &quot;Wehrkreis&quot; (Military District) VI, which included his Gau together with Gau Dusseldorf, Gau Cologne-Aachen, most of Gau Westphalia-North and Gau Westphalia-South and part of Gau Weser-Ems. On 16 November 1942, the jurisdiction of the Reich Defense Commissioners was changed from the &quot;Wehrkreis&quot; to the Gau level and Terboven remained Commissioner for only his Gau of Essen.

==Reichskommissar of Norway==
Terboven was named &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; for Norway on 24 April 1940 even before the military invasion&#x27;s completion on 10 June. He moved into Skaugum, the official residence of Crown Prince Olav, in September 1940 and made his headquarters in the Norwegian Parliament building. Nothing in Terboven&#x27;s background and training particularly qualified him for that post, but he had Hitler&#x27;s full confidence. He was responsible to no one but Hitler, and within the Nazi governmental hierarchy, his office stood on the same level as the Reich Ministries. Terboven regarded himself as virtually an autonomous viceroy with what he termed &quot;limitless power of command&quot;. His conception of his role resulted in his attempting to ignore any directives not issued by Hitler himself.

&quot;Reichskommissar&quot; Terboven had supervisory authority over only the German civilian administration, which was very small and did not rule Norway directly. Day-to-day governmental affairs were managed by the existing seven-member Norwegian Administrative Council, which had been set up by the Norwegian Supreme Court after the king and cabinet fled into exile. On 25 September 1940, Terboven dismissed the Administrative Council and appointed a thirteen-member Provisional State Council to administer affairs. All the members were Terboven&#x27;s hand-picked appointees and worked under his control and supervision. A proclamation was issued deposing King Haakon VII, outlawing the government-in-exile, disbanding the Storting and banning all political parties except Vidkun Quisling’s Nasjonal Samling. Terboven therefore remained in ultimate charge of Norway until the end of the war in 1945, even after he had permitted the formation of a Norwegian puppet regime on 1 February 1942 under Quisling as minister-president, the so-called Quisling government.

Terboven also did not have authority over the 400,000 regular German Army forces that were stationed in Norway which were under the command of &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Nikolaus von Falkenhorst, but he commanded a personal force of around 6,000 men of whom 800 were part of the secret police. In contrast to the military forces commanded by Falkenhorst, which aimed to reach an understanding with the Norwegian people and were under orders by Falkenhorst to treat Norwegians with courtesy, Terboven behaved in a petty and ruthless way and was widely disliked not only by the Norwegians but also by many Germans. Goebbels, the Reich Minister of Propaganda, expressed annoyance in his diaries about what he called Terboven&#x27;s &quot;bullying tactics&quot; against the Norwegians, as they alienated the population against the Germans. Terboven&#x27;s relations with the army commander were strained, but his relations with the Higher SS and Police Leader, Wilhelm Rediess, were very good, and he co-operated in providing Rediess&#x27;s staff a free hand with their policies of repression.

===Repression and crimes against humanity===
Terboven established multiple concentration camps in Norway, including Falstad concentration camp near Levanger and Bredtvet concentration camp in Oslo in late 1941. At one of those camps on 18 July 1942 the Beisfjord massacre took place, the murder of hundreds of Yugoslavian political prisoners and prisoners-of-war by German and Norwegian concentration camp guards. Some 288 prisoners were shot to death, and many others were burned to death when the barracks were set on fire. Terboven had ordered the massacre a few days earlier. In July 1942, at least one German guard assigned to the Korgen prison camp was killed. The commandant ordered retribution: execution by gunfire for &quot;39 prisoners at Korgen and 20 at Osen&quot;;. In the days that followed, Terboven also ordered retribution, and around 400 prisoners shot and killed in various camps.

From 1941, Terboven increasingly focused on crushing the Norwegian resistance movement, which engaged in acts of sabotage and assassination against the Germans. On 17 September, Terboven decreed that special SS and Police Tribunals would have jurisdiction over Norwegian citizens who violated his decrees. They were summary proceedings with the accused provided no adequate defense. The trials were not open to the public, and the proceedings were not published. Sentences were carried out shortly after they were pronounced with no right of appeal. It is estimated that some 150 individuals were sentenced to death by these tribunals. Many more were sentenced to long terms of hard labour.

On 26 April 1942, the Nazis learned that two members of the resistance were being sheltered by the inhabitants of Telavåg, a small fishing village. When the Gestapo arrived, shots were exchanged, and two Gestapo agents were killed. Terboven was outraged and personally led a reprisal raid on 30 April that was quick and brutal. All buildings were burned to the ground, all boats were sunk or confiscated and all livestock taken away. All men in the village were either executed or sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, in Germany. Of the 72 who were deported from Telavåg, 31 were murdered in captivity. The women and the children were imprisoned for two years. Another 18 Norwegian prisoners unrelated to Telavåg, who were held at the Trandum internment camp, were also executed as reprisals. In another incident, the shooting of two German police officials on 6 September 1942 led to Terboven personally declaring martial law in Trondheim from 5 to 12 October 1942. He imposed a curfew from 8:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. and suppressed all newspapers, public assemblies and railroad transportation. On Terboven&#x27;s orders, ten prominent citizens were executed in reprisal, and their assets were confiscated. In addition, Terboven set up an ad hoc extrajudicial tribunal to try Norwegians considered “hostile to the state”. An additional 24 men were tried and summarily executed over the next three days.

Despite the small number of Jews in Norway&#x27;s population (around 1,800), Terboven persecuted them relentlessly. Some 930 managed to escape to neighboring Sweden, but some 770 were rounded up and deported to Germany. The main deportation occurred on 26 November 1942, when 532 Jews were shipped to Stettin aboard the &quot;SS Donau&quot;. From there, they were transported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, and only 9 survived the war. On 25 February 1943, another 158 were similarly deported aboard the M&quot;S Gotenland&quot;, and only six survived.

==Last months of the war and death==
On 25 September 1944, Terboven, in his capacity as &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Essen, was named commander of the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; units in the Gau. In reality, it was his Deputy &quot;Gauleiter&quot;, Fritz Schlessmann, who executed those duties as he had been Acting &quot;Gauleiter&quot; in Essen during Terboven&#x27;s absence in Norway since 1940. In October 1944, in response to the Red Army advance in to the Finnmark region of northern Norway, Terboven instituted a scorched earth policy that resulted in the forced evacuation of 50,000 Norwegians and widespread destruction, including the burning of 10,000 homes; 4700 farms; and hundreds of schools, churches, shops and industrial buildings.

As the tide of the war turned against Germany, Terboven&#x27;s personal aspiration was to organise Festung Norwegen (Fortress Norway) for the Nazi regime&#x27;s last stand. However, after Hitler&#x27;s suicide, his successor, &quot;Großadmiral&quot; Karl Dönitz, summoned Terboven to his headquarters in Flensburg on 3 May 1945 and ordered him to cooperate with winding down hostilities. Terboven expressed his desire to continue fighting. Consequently, Dönitz dismissed Terboven from his post as &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; on 7 May and transferred his powers to &quot;General der Gebirgstruppe&quot; Franz Böhme.

With the announcement of Germany&#x27;s surrender, Terboven committed suicide on 8 May 1945 by detonating of dynamite in a bunker on the Skaugum compound. He died alongside the body of SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Rediess, who had shot himself earlier. Terboven&#x27;s family survived in West Germany, although his daughter, Inga, in an event in 1964 unrelated to her father&#x27;s history, killed her two-year-old daughter by strangulation. Terboven&#x27;s wife, Ilse, died in 1972.

<text>James Joseph Brown (May 3, 1933 – December 25, 2006) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and musician. The central progenitor of funk music and a major figure of 20th-century music, he is referred to by various nicknames, among them &quot;Mr. Dynamite&quot;, &quot;the Hardest-Working Man in Show Business&quot;, &quot;Minister of New Super Heavy Funk&quot;, &quot;Godfather of Soul&quot;, &quot;King of Soul&quot;, and &quot;Soul Brother No. 1&quot;. In a career that lasted more than 50 years, he influenced the development of several music genres. Brown was one of the first ten inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on January 23, 1986. His music has been heavily sampled by hip-hop musicians and other artists.

Brown began his career as a gospel singer in Toccoa, Georgia. He rose to prominence in the mid-1950s as the lead singer of the Famous Flames, a rhythm and blues vocal group founded by Bobby Byrd. With the hit ballads &quot;Please, Please, Please&quot; and &quot;Try Me&quot;, Brown built a reputation as a dynamic live performer with the Famous Flames and his backing band, sometimes known as the James Brown Band or the James Brown Orchestra. His success peaked in the 1960s with the live album &quot;Live at the Apollo&quot; and hit singles such as &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Bag&quot;, &quot;I Got You (I Feel Good)&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s Man&#x27;s Man&#x27;s World&quot;.

During the late 1960s, Brown moved from a continuum of blues and gospel-based forms and styles to a new approach to music-making, emphasizing stripped-down interlocking rhythms that influenced the development of funk music. By the early 1970s, Brown had fully established the funk sound after the formation of the J.B.s with records such as &quot;Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine&quot; and &quot;The Payback&quot;. He also became noted for songs of social commentary, including the 1968 hit &quot;Say It Loud – I&#x27;m Black and I&#x27;m Proud&quot;. Brown continued to perform and record until his death from pneumonia in 2006.

Brown recorded and released 17 singles that reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B charts. He also holds the record for the most singles listed on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart that did not reach No. 1. Brown was posthumously inducted into the first class of the Rhythm &amp; Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2013 as an artist and then in 2017 as a songwriter. He received honors from several other institutions, including inductions into the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In Joel Whitburn&#x27;s analysis of the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B charts from 1942 to 2010, Brown is ranked No. 1 in the Top 500 Artists. He is ranked seventh on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, and at No. 44 on their list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time. 
==Early life==
James Joseph Brown was born on May 3, 1933, in Barnwell, South Carolina, to 16-year-old Susie (&quot;née&quot; Behling; 1917–2004) and 21-year-old Joseph Gardner Brown (1912–1993) in a small wooden shack. Brown&#x27;s name was supposed to have been Joseph James Brown, but his first and middle names were mistakenly reversed on his birth certificate.

The Brown family lived in poverty in Elko, South Carolina, which was an impoverished town in 1933. They moved to Augusta, Georgia, when James was four or five. His family first settled at one of his aunts&#x27; brothels. They later moved into a house shared with another aunt. Brown&#x27;s mother eventually left the family after a contentious and abusive marriage and moved to New York.

He began singing in talent shows as a young child, first appearing at Augusta&#x27;s Lenox Theater in 1944, winning the show after singing the ballad &quot;So Long&quot;. While in Augusta, Brown performed buck dances for change to entertain troops from Camp Gordon at the start of World War II as their convoys traveled over a canal bridge near his aunt&#x27;s home. This is where he first heard the legendary blues musician Howlin&#x27; Wolf play guitar. He learned to play the piano, guitar, and harmonica during this period. He became inspired to become an entertainer after hearing &quot;Caldonia&quot; by Louis Jordan and his Tympany Five. In his teen years, Brown briefly had a career as a boxer.

At the age of 16, he was convicted of robbery and sent to a juvenile detention center in Toccoa. There, he formed a gospel quartet with four cellmates, including Johnny Terry. Brown met singer Bobby Byrd when the two played against each other in a baseball game outside the detention center. Byrd discovered that Brown could sing after hearing of &quot;a guy called Music Box&quot;, which was Brown&#x27;s nickname at the prison. Byrd has since said he and his family helped to secure an early release, which led to Brown promising the court he would &quot;sing for the Lord&quot;.

Brown was released on a work sponsorship with Toccoa business owner S. C. Lawson. Lawson was impressed with Brown&#x27;s work ethic and secured his release with a promise to keep him employed for two years. Brown was paroled on June 14, 1952. Brown went on to work with both of Lawson&#x27;s sons, and came back to visit the family from time to time throughout his career. Shortly after being paroled he joined the gospel group the Ever-Ready Gospel Singers, featuring Byrd&#x27;s sister Sarah.

==Music career==
===1954–1961: The Famous Flames ===

Brown joined Bobby Byrd&#x27;s group in 1954. The group had evolved from the Gospel Starlighters, an a cappella gospel group, to an R&amp;B group with the name the Avons. He reputedly joined the band after one of its members, Troy Collins, died in a car crash. Along with Brown and Byrd, the group consisted of Sylvester Keels, Doyle Oglesby, Fred Pulliam, Nash Knox and Nafloyd Scott. Influenced by R&amp;B groups such as Hank Ballard and the Midnighters, the Orioles and Billy Ward and his Dominoes, the group changed its name, first to the Toccoa Band and then to the Flames. Nafloyd&#x27;s brother Baroy later joined the group on bass guitar. Brown, Byrd and Keels switched lead positions and instruments, often playing drums and piano. Johnny Terry later joined, by which time Pulliam and Oglesby had long left.

Berry Trimier became the group&#x27;s first manager, booking them at parties near college campuses in Georgia and South Carolina. The group had already gained a reputation as a good live act when they renamed themselves the Famous Flames. In 1955, the group contacted Little Richard while performing in Macon. Richard convinced the group to get in contact with his manager at the time, Clint Brantley, at his nightclub. Brantley agreed to manage them after seeing the group audition. He then sent them to a local radio station to record a demo session, where they performed their own composition &quot;Please, Please, Please&quot;, which was inspired when Little Richard wrote the words of the title on a napkin and Brown was determined to make a song out of it. 

The Famous Flames eventually signed with King Records&#x27; Federal subsidiary in Cincinnati, Ohio, and issued a re-recorded version of &quot;Please, Please, Please&quot; in March 1956. The song became the group&#x27;s first R&amp;B hit, selling over a million copies. None of their follow-ups gained similar success. In 1957, Brown replaced Clint Brantley as manager and hired Ben Bart, chief of Universal Attractions Agency. In 1957 the original Flames broke up, after Bart changed the name of the group to &quot;James Brown and His Famous Flames&quot;.

In October 1958, Brown released the ballad &quot;Try Me&quot;, which hit number one on the R&amp;B chart in the beginning of 1959, becoming the first of seventeen chart-topping R&amp;B hits. Shortly afterwards, he recruited his first band, led by J. C. Davis, and reunited with Bobby Byrd who joined a revived Famous Flames lineup that included Eugene &quot;Baby&quot; Lloyd Stallworth and Bobby Bennett, with Johnny Terry sometimes coming in as the &quot;fifth Flame&quot;. Brown, the Flames, and his entire band debuted at the Apollo Theater on April 24, 1959, opening for Brown&#x27;s idol, Little Willie John. 

Federal Records issued two albums credited to Brown and the Famous Flames. Both contained previously released singles. In 1960, Brown began multi-tasking in the recording studio involving himself, his singing group, the Famous Flames, and his band, a separate entity from the Flames, sometimes named the James Brown Orchestra or the James Brown Band. In 1960, the band released the top ten R&amp;B hit &quot;(Do the) Mashed Potatoes&quot; on Dade Records, owned by Henry Stone, billed under the pseudonym &quot;Nat Kendrick &amp; the Swans&quot; due to label issues. As a result of its success, King president Syd Nathan shifted Brown&#x27;s contract from Federal to the parent label, King, which according to Brown in his autobiography meant &quot;you got more support from the company&quot;. While with King, Brown, under the Famous Flames lineup, released the hit-filled album &quot;Think!&quot; and in 1961 released two albums with the James Brown Band earning second billing. With the Famous Flames, Brown sang lead on several more hits, including &quot;Bewildered&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Go Crazy&quot; and &quot;Think&quot;, songs that hinted at his emerging style.

===1962–1966: Mr. Dynamite===
In 1962, Brown and his band scored a hit with their cover of the instrumental &quot;Night Train&quot;, becoming a top five R&amp;B single. That same year, the ballads &quot;Lost Someone&quot; and &quot;Baby You&#x27;re Right&quot;, the latter a Joe Tex composition, added to his repertoire and increased his reputation with R&amp;B audiences. On October 24, 1962, Brown financed a live recording of a performance at the Apollo and convinced Syd Nathan to release the album, despite Nathan&#x27;s belief that no one would buy a live album due to the fact that Brown&#x27;s singles had already been bought and that live albums were usually bad sellers.
&quot;Live at the Apollo&quot; was released in June 1963 and became an immediate hit, eventually reaching number two on the Top LPs chart and selling over a million copies, staying on the charts for 14 months. In 1963, Brown scored his first top 20 pop hit with his rendition of the standard &quot;Prisoner of Love&quot;. He launched his first label, Try Me Records, which included recordings by Tammy Montgomery, later to be famous as Tammi Terrell, Johnny &amp; Bill (Famous Flames associates Johnny Terry and Bill Hollings) and the Poets, which was another name used for Brown&#x27;s backing band. During this time, Brown began an ill-fated two-year relationship with 17-year-old Tammi Terrell when she sang in his revue. Terrell ended their personal and professional relationship because of Brown&#x27;s abusive behavior.

In 1964, seeking bigger commercial success, Brown and Bobby Byrd formed the production company, Fair Deal, linking the operation to the Mercury imprint, Smash Records. King Records fought against this and was granted an injunction preventing Brown from releasing any recordings for the label. Prior to the injunction, Brown had released three vocal singles, including the blues-oriented hit &quot;Out of Sight&quot;, which further indicated the direction his music was going to take. Touring throughout the year, Brown and the Famous Flames grabbed more national attention after delivering an explosive show-stopping performance on the live concert film &quot;The T.A.M.I. Show&quot;. The Flames&#x27; dynamic gospel-tinged vocals, polished choreography and timing as well as Brown&#x27;s energetic dance moves and high-octane singing upstaged the proposed closing act, the Rolling Stones.

Having signed a new deal with King, Brown released his song &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Bag&quot; in 1965, which became his first top ten pop hit and won him his first Grammy Award. Brown signed a production deal with Loma Records. Later in 1965, he issued &quot;I Got You&quot;, which became his second single in a row to reach number-one on the R&amp;B chart and top ten on the pop chart. Brown followed that up with the ballad &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s Man&#x27;s Man&#x27;s World&quot;, a third Top 10 Pop hit (No. 1 R&amp;B) which confirmed his stance as a top-ranking performer, especially with R&amp;B audiences from that point on.

===1967–1970: Soul Brother No. 1===

By 1967, Brown&#x27;s emerging sound began to be defined as funk music. That year he released what some critics cited as the first true funk song, &quot;Cold Sweat&quot;, which hit number-one on the R&amp;B chart (Top 10 Pop) and became one of his first recordings to contain a drum break and also the first that featured a harmony that was reduced to a single chord. The instrumental arrangements on tracks such as &quot;Give It Up or Turnit a Loose&quot; and &quot;Licking Stick-Licking Stick&quot;, both recorded in 1968, and &quot;Funky Drummer&quot;, recorded in 1969, featured a more developed version of Brown&#x27;s mid-1960s style, with the horn section, guitars, bass and drums meshed together in intricate rhythmic patterns based on multiple interlocking riffs.
(Note: It is very important to mention &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Money&quot; which features the first &#x27;rhythmic&#x27; shift as one of the foundations of the Funk, played by Clayton Fillyau in recorded in 1961, released in 1962!)

Changes in Brown&#x27;s style that started with &quot;Cold Sweat&quot; established the musical foundation for Brown&#x27;s later hits, such as &quot;I Got the Feelin&#x27;&quot; (1968) and &quot;Mother Popcorn&quot; (1969). By this time Brown&#x27;s vocals frequently took the form of a kind of rhythmic declamation, not quite sung but not quite spoken, that only intermittently featured traces of pitch or melody. This became a major influence on the techniques of rapping, which would come to maturity along with hip hop music in the coming decades. Brown&#x27;s style of funk in the late 1960s was based on interlocking syncopated parts: strutting bass lines, syncopated drum patterns, and iconic percussive guitar riffs. 

The main guitar ostinatos for 1969&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Funky&quot; and &quot;Give It Up or Turnit a Loose&quot;, are examples of Brown&#x27;s refinement of New Orleans funk; irresistibly danceable riffs, stripped down to their rhythmic essence. On both recordings, the tonal structure is bare bones. The pattern of attack points is the emphasis, not the pattern of pitches as if the guitar were an African drum or idiophone. Alexander Stewart states that this popular feel was passed along from &quot;New Orleans—through James Brown&#x27;s music, to the popular music of the 1970s&quot;. Those same tracks were later resurrected by countless hip-hop musicians from the 1970s onward. As a result, James Brown remains to this day the world&#x27;s most sampled recording artist. Two tracks that he wrote, are synonymous with modern dance, especially with house music, jungle music, and drum and bass music, which were sped up exponentially, in the latter two genres.

&quot;Bring it Up&quot; has an Afro-Cuban guajeo-like structure. All three of these guitar riffs are based on an onbeat/offbeat structure. Stewart says that it &quot;is different from a time line (such as clave and tresillo) in that it is not an exact pattern, but more of a loose organizing principle.&quot;

It was around this time as the musician&#x27;s popularity increased that he acquired the nickname &quot;Soul Brother No. 1&quot;, after failing to win the title &quot;King of Soul&quot; from Solomon Burke during a Chicago gig two years prior. Brown&#x27;s recordings during this period influenced musicians across the industry, most notably groups such as Sly and the Family Stone, Funkadelic, Charles Wright &amp; the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band, Booker T. &amp; the M.G.s as well as vocalists such as Edwin Starr, David Ruffin and Dennis Edwards from the Temptations, and Michael Jackson, who, throughout his career, cited Brown as his ultimate idol.

Brown&#x27;s band during this period employed musicians and arrangers who had come up through the jazz tradition. He was noted for his ability as a bandleader and songwriter to blend the simplicity and drive of R&amp;B with the rhythmic complexity and precision of jazz. Trumpeter Lewis Hamlin and saxophonist/keyboardist Alfred &quot;Pee Wee&quot; Ellis, the successor to previous bandleader Nat Jones, led the band. Guitarist Jimmy Nolen provided percussive, deceptively simple riffs for each song, and Maceo Parker&#x27;s prominent saxophone solos provided a focal point for many performances. Other members of Brown&#x27;s band included stalwart Famous Flames singer and sideman Bobby Byrd, trombonist Fred Wesley, drummers John &quot;Jabo&quot; Starks, Clyde Stubblefield and Melvin Parker, saxophonist St. Clair Pinckney, guitarist Alphonso &quot;Country&quot; Kellum and bassist Bernard Odum.

In addition to a torrent of singles and studio albums, Brown&#x27;s output during this period included two more successful live albums, &quot;Live at the Garden&quot; (1967) and &quot;Live at the Apollo, Volume II&quot; (1968), and a 1968 television special, &quot;James Brown: Man to Man&quot;. His music empire expanded along with his influence on the music scene. As Brown&#x27;s music empire grew, his desire for financial and artistic independence grew as well. Brown bought radio stations during the late 1960s, including WRDW in his native Augusta, where he shined shoes as a boy. In November 1967, James Brown purchased radio station WGYW in Knoxville, Tennessee, for a reported $75,000, according to the January 20, 1968 &quot;Record World&quot; magazine. The call letters were changed to WJBE reflecting his initials. WJBE began on January 15, 1968, and broadcast a Rhythm &amp; Blues format. The station slogan was &quot;WJBE 1430 Raw Soul&quot;. Brown bought WEBB in Baltimore in 1970.

Brown branched out to make several recordings with musicians outside his own band. In an attempt to appeal to the older, more affluent, and predominantly white adult contemporary audience, Brown recorded &quot;Gettin&#x27; Down To It&quot; (1969) and &quot;Soul on Top&quot; (1970)—two albums consisting mostly of romantic ballads, jazz standards, and homologous reinterpretations of his earlier hits—with the Dee Felice Trio and the Louie Bellson Orchestra. In 1968, he recorded a number of funk-oriented tracks with the Dapps, a white Cincinnati band, including the hit &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand Myself&quot;. He also released three albums of Christmas music with his own band.

===1970–2006: Godfather of Soul===

In March 1970, most of Brown&#x27;s mid-to-late 1960s road band walked out on him due to financial disputes, a development augured by the prior disbandment of the Famous Flames singing group for the same reason in 1968. Brown and erstwhile Famous Flames singer Bobby Byrd, who chose to remain in the band during this tumultuous period as co-frontman, effectively serving as a proto-hype man in live performances, recruited several members of the Pacemakers, a Cincinnati-based ensemble that included bassist Bootsy Collins and his brother, guitarist Phelps &quot;Catfish&quot; Collins; augmented by the remaining members of the 1960s road band, including Fred Wesley, who rejoined Brown&#x27;s outfit in December 1970, and other newer musicians, they formed the nucleus of the J.B.&#x27;s, Brown&#x27;s new backing ensemble.

Shortly following their first performance together, the band entered the studio to record the Brown-Byrd composition, &quot;Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine&quot;. The song —with its off the beat play Brown called &quot;The One&quot;— and other contemporaneous singles further cemented Brown&#x27;s influence in the nascent genre of funk music. This iteration of the J.B.&#x27;s dissolved after a March 1971 European tour (documented on the 1991 archival release &quot;Love Power Peace&quot;) due to additional money disputes and Bootsy Collins&#x27;s use of LSD; a new lineup of the J.B.&#x27;s coalesced around Wesley, St. Clair Pinckney and drummer John Starks.

In 1971, Brown began recording for Polydor Records. Many of his sidemen and supporting players, including Fred Wesley &amp; the J.B.&#x27;s, Bobby Byrd, Lyn Collins, Vicki Anderson and former rival Hank Ballard, released records on the People label.

During the 1972 presidential election, James Brown openly proclaimed his support of Richard Nixon for reelection to the presidency over Democratic candidate George McGovern. The decision led to a boycott of his performances and, according to Brown, cost him a big portion of his black audience. As a result, Brown&#x27;s record sales and concerts in the United States were in a lull in 1973, as he failed to land a number-one R&amp;B single that year. In 1973 he also faced problems with the IRS for failure to pay back taxes, charging he hadn&#x27;t paid upwards of $4.5 million; five years earlier, the IRS had claimed he owed nearly $2 million.
In 1973, Brown provided the score for the blaxploitation film &quot;Black Caesar&quot;. In 1974 he returned to the No. 1 spot on the R&amp;B charts with &quot;The Payback&quot;, with the parent album reaching the same spot on the album charts. He reached No. 1 two more times in 1974, with &quot;My Thang&quot; and &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Take No Mess&quot;.

&quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Take No Mess&quot; was his final single to reach the No. 1 spot on the R&amp;B charts. His other Top Ten R&amp;B hits during this latter period included &quot;Funky President&quot; (R&amp;B No. 4) and &quot;Get Up Offa That Thing&quot; (R&amp;B No. 4).
Although his records were mainstays of the vanguard New York underground disco scene, exemplified by DJs such as David Mancuso and Francis Grasso, from 1969 onwards, Brown did not consciously yield to the trend until 1975&#x27;s &quot;Sex Machine Today&quot;. By 1977, he was no longer a dominant force in R&amp;B. After &quot;Get Up Offa That Thing&quot;, thirteen of Brown&#x27;s late 1970s recordings for Polydor failed to reach the Top 10 of the R&amp;B chart, with only &quot;Bodyheat&quot; in 1976 and the disco-oriented &quot;It&#x27;s Too Funky in Here&quot; in 1979 reaching the R&amp;B Top 15 and the ballad &quot;Kiss in &#x27;77&quot; reaching the Top 20. 

After 1976&#x27;s &quot;Bodyheat&quot;, he failed to appear on the Billboard Hot 100. As a result, Brown&#x27;s concert attendance began dropping and his reported disputes with the IRS caused his business empire to collapse. In addition, several longtime bandmates, including Wesley and Maceo Parker, had gradually pivoted to Parliament-Funkadelic, which reached its critical and commercial apogee in the mid-to-late 1970s. The emergence of disco forestalled Brown&#x27;s success on the R&amp;B charts, because its slicker, more commercial style had superseded his rawer, one-chord funk productions.

By the release of 1979&#x27;s &quot;The Original Disco Man&quot;, Brown seldom contributed to the songwriting and production processes, leaving most of it to producer Brad Shapiro. This resulted in the song &quot;It&#x27;s Too Funky in Here&quot; becoming Brown&#x27;s most successful single in this period. After two more albums failed to chart, Brown left Polydor in 1981. It was around this time that Brown changed the name of his band from the J.B.&#x27;s to the Soul Generals, or Soul G&#x27;s. The band retained that name until his death.

Despite Brown&#x27;s declining record sales, promoters Gary LoConti and Jim Rissmiller helped Brown sell out a string of residency shows at the Reseda Country Club in Los Angeles in early 1982. Brown&#x27;s compromised commercial standing prevented him from charging a large fee. However, the great success of these shows marked a turning point for Brown&#x27;s career, and soon he was back on top in Hollywood. Movies followed, including appearances in &quot;Doctor Detroit&quot; (1983) and &quot;Rocky IV&quot; (1985). He guest-starred in the &quot;Miami Vice&quot; episode &quot;Missing Hours&quot; (1987). Previously, Brown appeared alongside a litany of other Black musical luminaries in &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (1980).

In 1984, he teamed with rap musician Afrika Bambaataa on the song &quot;Unity&quot;. A year later he signed with Scotti Brothers Records and issued the moderately successful album &quot;Gravity&quot; in 1986 with a popular song &quot;How Do You Stop&quot;. It included Brown&#x27;s final Top Ten pop hit, &quot;Living in America&quot;, marking his first Top 40 entry since 1974 and his first Top Ten pop entry since 1968. Produced and written by Dan Hartman, it featured prominently on the &quot;Rocky IV&quot; film and soundtrack. Brown performed the song in the film at Apollo Creed&#x27;s final fight, shot in the Ziegfeld Room at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, and was credited in the film as the Godfather of Soul. 1986 also saw the publication of his autobiography, &quot;James Brown: The Godfather of Soul&quot;, co-written with Bruce Tucker. In 1987, Brown won the Grammy for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance for &quot;Living in America&quot;.

In 1988, Brown worked with the production team Full Force on the new jack swing-influenced &quot;I&#x27;m Real&quot;. It spawned his final two Top 10 R&amp;B hits, &quot;I&#x27;m Real&quot; and &quot;Static&quot;, which peaked at No. 2 and No. 5, respectively. Meanwhile, the drum break from the second version of the original 1969 hit &quot;Give It Up Or Turnit A Loose&quot;, the recording included on the compilation album &quot;In the Jungle Groove&quot;, became so popular at hip hop dance parties, especially for breakdance, during the early 1980s that hip hop pioneer Kurtis Blow called the song &quot;the national anthem of hip hop&quot;.
After his stint in prison during the late 1980s, Brown met Larry Fridie and Thomas Hart who produced the first James Brown biopic, entitled &quot;James Brown: The Man, the Message, the Music&quot;, released in 1992. He returned to music with the album &quot;Love Over-Due&quot; in 1991. It included the single &quot;(So Tired of Standing Still We Got to) Move On&quot;, which peaked at No. 48 on the R&amp;B chart. His former record label Polydor released the four-CD box set &quot;Star Time&quot;, spanning Brown&#x27;s career to date. Brown&#x27;s release from prison prompted his former record labels to reissue his albums on CD, featuring additional tracks and commentary by music critics and historians. 

In 1991, Brown appeared on rapper MC Hammer&#x27;s video for &quot;Too Legit to Quit&quot;. Hammer had been noted, alongside Big Daddy Kane, for bringing Brown&#x27;s unique stage shows and their own energetic dance moves to the hip-hop generation. Both listed Brown as their idol. Both musicians sampled his work, with Hammer having sampled the rhythms from &quot;Super Bad&quot; for his song &quot;Here Comes the Hammer&quot;, from his best-selling album &quot;Please Hammer, Don&#x27;t Hurt &#x27;Em&quot;. Big Daddy Kane sampled many times. Before the year was over, Brown–who had immediately returned to work with his band following his release–organized a pay-per-view concert following a show at Los Angeles&#x27; Wiltern Theatre, that was well received.

On June 10, 1991, James Brown and a star-filled line up performed before a crowd at the Wiltern Theatre for a live pay-per-view at-home audience. &quot;James Brown: Living in America – Live!&quot; was the brainchild of Indiana producer Danny Hubbard. It featured
M.C. Hammer as well as Bell Biv Devoe, Heavy D &amp; the Boys, En Vogue, C+C Music Factory, Quincy Jones, Sherman Hemsley and Keenen Ivory Wayans. Ice-T, Tone Loc and Kool Moe Dee performed paying homage to Brown. This was Brown&#x27;s first public performance since his parole from the South Carolina prison system in February. He had served two-and-a-half years of two concurrent six-year sentences for aggravated assault and other felonies.

Brown continued making recordings. In 1993 his album &quot;Universal James&quot; was released. It included his final &quot;Billboard&quot; charting single, &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Any Harder&quot;, which peaked at No. 76 on the US R&amp;B chart and reached No. 59 on the UK chart. Its brief charting in the UK was probably due to the success of a remixed version of &quot;I Feel Good&quot; featuring Dakeyne. Brown released the singles &quot;How Long&quot; and &quot;Georgia-Lina&quot;, which failed to chart. In 1995, Brown returned to the Apollo and recorded &quot;Live at the Apollo 1995&quot;. It included a studio track titled &quot;Respect Me&quot;, which was released as a single. Again, it failed to chart. 
Brown&#x27;s final studio albums, &quot;I&#x27;m Back&quot; and &quot;The Next Step&quot;, were released in 1998 and 2002 respectively. &quot;I&#x27;m Back&quot; featured the song &quot;Funk on Ah Roll&quot;, which peaked at No. 40 in the UK but did not chart in his native US. &quot;The Next Step&quot; included Brown&#x27;s final single, &quot;Killing Is Out, School Is In&quot;. Both albums were produced by Derrick Monk. Brown&#x27;s concert success remained unabated and he kept up with a grueling schedule throughout the remainder of his life, living up to his previous nickname, &quot;The Hardest Working Man in Show Business&quot;, in spite of his advanced age. In 2003, Brown participated in the PBS &quot;American Masters&quot; television documentary &quot;James Brown: Soul Survivor&quot;, which was directed by Jeremy Marre.

Brown performed in the Super Bowl XXXI halftime show in 1997.

Brown celebrated his status as an icon by appearing in a variety of entertainment and sports events, including an appearance on the WCW pay-per-view event, SuperBrawl X, where he danced alongside wrestler Ernest &quot;the Cat&quot; Miller, who based his character on Brown, during his in-ring skit with the Maestro. Brown appeared in Tony Scott&#x27;s short film &quot;Beat the Devil&quot; in 2001. He was featured alongside Clive Owen, Gary Oldman, Danny Trejo and Marilyn Manson. Brown made a cameo appearance in the 2002 Jackie Chan film &quot;The Tuxedo&quot;, in which Chan was required to finish Brown&#x27;s act after having accidentally knocked out the singer. In 2002, Brown appeared in &quot;Undercover Brother&quot;, playing himself.
In 2004, Brown opened for the Red Hot Chili Peppers at several Hyde Park concerts in London. The beginning of 2005 saw the publication of his second book, &quot;I Feel Good: A Memoir of a Life of Soul&quot;, written with Marc Eliot. In February and March 2005, he participated in recording sessions for an intended studio album with Fred Wesley, Pee Wee Ellis, and other longtime collaborators. Though he lost interest in the album, which remains unreleased, a track from the sessions, &quot;Gut Bucket&quot;, appeared on a compilation CD included with the August 2006 issue of &quot;MOJO&quot;. 

He appeared at Edinburgh 50,000 – The Final Push, the final Live 8 concert on July 6, 2005, where he performed a duet with British pop star Will Young on &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got A Brand New Bag&quot;. In the Black Eyed Peas album &quot;Monkey Business&quot;, Brown was featured on a track called &quot;They Don&#x27;t Want Music&quot;. The previous week he had performed a duet with another British pop star, Joss Stone, on the United Kingdom chat show &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot;. In 2006, Brown continued his Seven Decades of Funk World Tour. 

His final major U.S. performance was in San Francisco on August 20, 2006, as headliner at the Festival of the Golden Gate (Foggfest) on the Great Meadow at Fort Mason. The next day, he performed at an 800-seat campus theatre at Humboldt State University in Arcata, California. His last shows were greeted with positive reviews, and one of his final concert appearances at the Irish Oxegen festival in Punchestown in 2006 included a record crowd of 80,000 people. He played a full concert as part of the BBC&#x27;s Electric Proms on October 27, 2006, at The Roundhouse, supported by the Zutons, with special appearances from Max Beasley and the Sugababes.

Brown&#x27;s last televised appearance was at his induction into the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2006, before his death in December. Before his death, Brown had been scheduled to perform a duet with singer Annie Lennox on the song &quot;Vengeance&quot; for her new album &quot;Venus&quot;, which was released in 2007.

==Artistry==

As a vocalist, Brown performed in a forceful shout style derived from gospel music. Meanwhile, &quot;his rhythmic grunts and expressive shrieks harked back farther still to ring shouts, work songs, and field cries&quot;, according to the &quot;Encyclopedia of African-American Culture and History&quot; (1996): &quot;He reimported the rhythmic complexity from which rhythm and blues, under the dual pressure of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and pop, had progressively fallen away since its birth from jazz and blues.&quot;

For many years, Brown&#x27;s touring show was one of the most extravagant productions in American popular music. At the time of Brown&#x27;s death, his band included three guitarists, two bass guitar players, two drummers, three horns and a percussionist. The bands that he maintained during the late 1960s and 1970s were of comparable size, and the bands also included a three-piece amplified string section that played during the ballads. Brown employed between 40 and 50 people for the James Brown Revue, and members of the revue traveled with him in a bus to cities and towns all over the country, performing upwards of 330 shows a year with almost all of the shows as one-nighters.

===Concert style===
Before James Brown appeared on stage, his personal MC gave him an elaborate introduction accompanied by drumrolls, as the MC worked in Brown&#x27;s various sobriquets along with the names of many of his hit songs. The introduction by Fats Gonder, captured on Brown&#x27;s 1963 album &quot;Live at the Apollo&quot; is a representative example:

James Brown&#x27;s performances were famous for their intensity and length. His own stated goal was to &quot;give people more than what they came for — make them tired, &#x27;cause &quot;that&#x27;s&quot; what they came for.&#x27;&quot; Brown&#x27;s concert repertoire consisted mostly of his own hits and recent songs, with a few R&amp;B covers mixed in. Brown danced vigorously as he sang, working popular dance steps such as the Mashed Potato into his routine along with dramatic leaps, splits and slides. His horn players and singing group, The Famous Flames, typically performed choreographed dance routines, and later incarnations of the Revue included backup dancers. Male performers in the Revue were required to wear tuxedoes and cummerbunds long after more casual concert wear became the norm among the younger musical acts. Brown&#x27;s own extravagant outfits and his elaborate processed hairdo completed the visual impression. A James Brown concert typically included a performance by a featured vocalist, such as Vicki Anderson or Marva Whitney, and an instrumental feature for the band, which sometimes served as the opening act for the show.

A trademark feature of Brown&#x27;s stage shows, usually during the song &quot;Please, Please, Please&quot;, involved Brown dropping to his knees while clutching the microphone stand in his hands, prompting the show&#x27;s longtime MC, Danny Ray, to come out, drape a cape over Brown&#x27;s shoulders and escort him off the stage after he had worked himself to exhaustion during his performance. As Brown was escorted off the stage by the MC, Brown&#x27;s vocal group, the Famous Flames, Bobby Byrd, Lloyd Stallworth, and Bobby Bennett, continued singing the background vocals &quot;Please, please don&#x27;t go-oh&quot;. Brown would then shake off the cape and stagger back to the microphone to perform an encore. Brown&#x27;s routine was inspired by a similar one used by the professional wrestler Gorgeous George, as well as Little Richard. 

In his 2005 autobiography &quot;I Feel Good: A Memoir in a Life of Soul&quot;, Brown, who was a fan of Gorgeous George, credited the wrestler as the inspiration for both his cape routine and concert attire, stating, &quot;Seeing him on TV helped create the James Brown you see on stage&quot;. Brown performs a version of the cape routine in the film of the &quot;T.A.M.I. Show&quot; (1964) in which he and the Famous Flames upstaged the Rolling Stones, and over the closing credits of the film &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot;. The Police refer to &quot;James Brown on the &quot;T.A.M.I. Show&quot;&quot; in their 1980 song &quot;When the World Is Running Down, You Make the Best of What&#x27;s Still Around&quot;.

===Band leadership===
Brown demanded extreme discipline, perfection and precision from his musicians and dancers – performers in his Revue showed up for rehearsals and members wore the right &quot;uniform&quot; or &quot;costume&quot; for concert performances. During an interview conducted by Terry Gross during the NPR segment &quot;Fresh Air&quot; with Maceo Parker, a former saxophonist in Brown&#x27;s band for most of the 1960s and part of the 1970s and 1980s, Parker offered his experience with the discipline that Brown demanded of the band:

Brown also had a practice of directing, correcting and assessing fines on members of his band who broke his rules, such as wearing unshined shoes, dancing out of sync or showing up late on stage. During some of his concert performances, Brown danced in front of his band with his back to the audience as he slid across the floor, flashing hand signals and splaying his pulsating fingers to the beat of the music. Although audiences thought Brown&#x27;s dance routine was part of his act, this practice was actually his way of pointing to the offending member of his troupe who played or sang the wrong note or committed some other infraction. Brown used his splayed fingers and hand signals to alert the offending person of the fine that person must pay to him for breaking his rules.

Brown&#x27;s demands on his support acts could be harsh. As Fred Wesley recalled of his time as musical director of the JBs, if Brown felt intimidated by a support act he would try to &quot;undermine their performances by shortening their sets without notice, demanding that they not do certain showstopping songs, and even insisting on doing the unthinkable, playing drums on some of their songs. A sure set killer.&quot;

==Social activism==
===Education advocacy and humanitarianism===
Brown&#x27;s main social activism was in preserving the need for education among youths, influenced by his own troubled childhood and his being forced to drop out of the seventh grade for wearing &quot;insufficient clothes&quot;. Due to heavy dropout rates in the 1960s, Brown released the pro-education song, &quot;Don&#x27;t Be a Drop-Out&quot;. Royalties of the song were donated to dropout-prevention charity programs. The success of this led to Brown meeting with President Lyndon B. Johnson at the White House. Johnson cited Brown for being a positive role model to the youth. In 1968 James Brown endorsed Hubert Humphrey. Later, Brown gained the confidence of President Richard Nixon, to whom he found he had to explain the plight of Black Americans.

Throughout the remainder of his life, Brown made public speeches in schools and continued to advocate the importance of education in school. Upon filing his will in 2002, Brown advised that most of the money in his estate go into creating the &quot;I Feel Good, Inc. Trust&quot; to benefit disadvantaged children and provide scholarships for his grandchildren. His final single, &quot;Killing Is Out, School Is In&quot;, advocated against murders of young children in the streets. Brown often gave out money and other items to children while traveling to his childhood hometown of Augusta. A week before his death, while looking gravely ill, Brown gave out toys and turkeys to kids at an Atlanta orphanage, something he had done several times over the years.

===Civil rights and self-reliance===
Though Brown performed at benefit rallies for civil rights organizations in the mid-1960s, Brown often shied away from discussing civil rights in his songs in fear of alienating his crossover audience. In 1968, in response to a growing urge of anti-war advocacy during the Vietnam War, Brown recorded the song, &quot;America Is My Home&quot;. In the song, Brown performed a rap, advocating patriotism and exhorting listeners to &quot;stop pitying yoursel[ves] and get up and fight&quot;. At the time of the song&#x27;s release, Brown had been performing for troops stationed in Vietnam.

====The Boston Garden concert====
On April 5, 1968, a day after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in Memphis, Tennessee, Brown provided a free citywide televised concert at the Boston Garden to maintain public order and calm concerned Boston residents, over the objections of the police chief, who wanted to call off the concert, which he thought would incite violence. The show was later released on DVD as &quot;Live at the Boston Garden: April 5, 1968&quot;. According to the documentary &quot;The Night James Brown Saved Boston&quot;, then-mayor Kevin White had strongly restrained the Boston police from cracking down on minor violence and protests after the assassination, while religious and community leaders worked to keep tempers from flaring. 

White arranged to have Brown&#x27;s performance broadcast multiple times on Boston&#x27;s public television station, WGBH, thus keeping potential rioters off the streets, watching the concert for free. Angered by not being told of this, Brown demanded $60,000 for &quot;gate&quot; fees, money he thought would be lost from ticket sales on account of the concert being broadcast for free, and then threatened to go public about the secret arrangement when the city balked at paying up afterwards, news of which would have been a political death blow to White and spark riots of its own. White eventually lobbied a behind-the-scenes power-brokering group known as &quot;The Vault&quot; to come up with money for Brown&#x27;s gate fee and other social programs, contributing $100,000. Brown received $15,000 from them via the city. White also persuaded management at the Garden to give up their share of receipts to make up the differences. Following this successful performance, Brown was counseled by President Johnson to urge cities ravaged from riots following King&#x27;s assassination to not resort to violence, telling them to &quot;cool it, there&#x27;s another way&quot;.

Responding to pressure from black activists, including H. Rap Brown, to take a bigger stance on their issues and from footage of black on black crime committed in inner cities, Brown wrote the lyrics to the song &quot;Say It Loud – I&#x27;m Black and I&#x27;m Proud&quot;, which his bandleader Alfred &quot;Pee Wee&quot; Ellis accompanied with a musical composition. Released late that summer, the song&#x27;s lyrics helped to make it an anthem for the civil rights movement. Brown only performed the song sporadically following its initial release, and later stated he had regrets about recording it, saying in 1984, &quot;Now &#x27;Say It Loud – I&#x27;m Black and I&#x27;m Proud&#x27; has done more for the black race than any other record, but if I had my choice, I wouldn&#x27;t have done it, because I don&#x27;t like defining anyone by race. To teach race is to teach separatism.&quot; In his autobiography he stated:

The song is obsolete now ... But it was necessary to teach pride then, and I think the song did a lot of good for a lot of people ... People called &quot;Black and Proud&quot; militant and angry – maybe because of the line about dying on your feet instead of living on your knees. But really, if you listen to it, it sounds like a children&#x27;s song. That&#x27;s why I had children in it, so children who heard it could grow up feeling pride ... The song cost me a lot of my crossover audience. The racial makeup at my concerts was mostly black after that. I don&#x27;t regret it, though, even if it was misunderstood.

In 1969, Brown recorded two more songs of social commentary, &quot;World&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want Nobody to Give Me Nothing&quot;, the latter song pleading for equal opportunity and self-reliance rather than entitlement. In 1970, in response to some black leaders for not being outspoken enough, he recorded &quot;Get Up, Get into It, Get Involved&quot; and &quot;Talkin&#x27; Loud and Sayin&#x27; Nothing&quot;. In 1971, he began touring Africa, including Zambia and Nigeria. He was made &quot;freeman of the city&quot; in Lagos, Nigeria, by Oba Adeyinka Oyekan, for his &quot;influence on black people all over the world&quot;. With his company, James Brown Enterprises, Brown helped to provide jobs for blacks in business in the communities. As the 1970s continued, Brown continued to record songs of social commentary, most prominently 1972&#x27;s &quot;King Heroin&quot; and the two-part ballad &quot;Public Enemy&quot;, which dealt with drug addiction.

===Political views===
During the 1968 presidential campaign, Brown endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Hubert Humphrey and appeared with Humphrey at political rallies. Brown was labeled an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; for supporting Humphrey and also for releasing the pro-American funk song, &quot;America Is My Home&quot;, in which Brown had lambasted protesters of the Vietnam War as well as the politics of pro-black activists. Brown began supporting Republican president Richard Nixon after being invited to perform at Nixon&#x27;s inaugural ball in January 1969. 

Brown&#x27;s endorsement of Nixon&#x27;s campaign during the 1972 presidential election negatively impacted his career during that period with several national Black organizations boycotting his records and protesting at his concert shows; a November 1972 show in Cincinnati was picketed with signs saying, &quot;James Brown: Nixon&#x27;s Clown&quot;. Brown initially was invited to perform at a Youth Concert following Nixon&#x27;s inauguration in January 1973 but bailed out due to the backlash he suffered from supporting Nixon. Brown joined fellow black entertainer Sammy Davis Jr., who faced similar backlash, to back out of the concert. Brown blamed it on &quot;fatigue&quot;.

Brown later reversed his support of Nixon and composed the song, &quot;You Can Have Watergate (Just Gimme Some Bucks And I&#x27;ll Be Straight)&quot; as a result. After Nixon resigned from office, Brown composed the 1974 hit, &quot;Funky President (People It&#x27;s Bad)&quot;, right after Gerald Ford took Nixon&#x27;s place. Brown later supported Democratic President Jimmy Carter, attending one of Carter&#x27;s inaugural balls in 1977. Brown openly supported President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s reelection in 1984.

Brown stated he was neither Democratic nor Republican despite his support of Republican presidents such as Nixon and Reagan as well as Democratic presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Jimmy Carter. In 1999, when being interviewed by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the magazine asked him to name a hero in the 20th century. Brown mentioned John F. Kennedy and then-96-year-old U.S. Senator, and former Dixiecrat, Strom Thurmond, stating &quot;when the young whippersnappers get out of line, whether Democratic or Republican, an old man can walk up and say &#x27;Wait a minute, son, it goes this way.&#x27; And that&#x27;s great for our country. He&#x27;s like a grandfather to me.&quot; 

In 2003, Brown was the featured attraction of a Washington, D.C., fundraiser for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Following the deaths of Ronald Reagan and his friend Ray Charles, Brown said to CNN, &quot;I&#x27;m kind of in an uproar. I love the country and I got – you know I&#x27;ve been around a long time, through many presidents and everything. So after losing Mr. Reagan, who I knew very well, then Mr. Ray Charles, who I worked with and lived with like, all our life, we had a show together in Oakland many, many years ago and it&#x27;s like you found the placard.&quot; Despite his contrarian political views, Brown mentored black activist Rev. Al Sharpton during the 1970s.

==Personal life==
In 1962, Tammi Terrell joined the James Brown Revue. Brown became sexually involved with Terrell—even though she was only 17—in a relationship that continued until she escaped his physical abuse. Bobby Bennett, former member of the Famous Flames, told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; about the abuse he witnessed: &quot;He beat Tammi Terrell terrible&quot;, said Bennett. &quot;She was bleeding, shedding blood.&quot; Terrell, who died in 1970, was Brown&#x27;s girlfriend before she became famous as Marvin Gaye&#x27;s singing partner in the mid-1960s. &quot;Tammi left him because she didn&#x27;t want her butt whipped&quot;, said Bennett, who also claimed he saw Brown kick one pregnant girlfriend down a flight of stairs.

===Marriages and children===
Brown was married three times. His first marriage was to Velma Warren in 1953. They had one son together. Over a decade later, the couple had separated. They divorced in 1969. They maintained a close friendship that lasted until Brown&#x27;s death. Brown&#x27;s second marriage was to Deidre &quot;Deedee&quot; Jenkins, on October 22, 1970. They had two daughters together. In 1974, they separated after what his daughter describes as years of domestic abuse. They divorced on January 10, 1981. 

His third marriage was to Adrienne Lois Rodriguez (March 9, 1950 – January 6, 1996) in 1984. It was a contentious marriage that made headlines due to domestic abuse complaints. Rodriguez filed for divorce in 1988, &quot;citing years of cruelty treatment&quot;, but they reconciled. Rodriguez died in 1996. Less than a year later, Brown hired Tomi Rae Hynie to be a background singer for his band. She later claimed that she was his fourth wife.

On December 23, 2002, Brown, 69, and Hynie, 33, held a wedding ceremony that was officiated by the Rev. Larry Flyer. Following Brown&#x27;s death, controversy surrounded the circumstances of the marriage. Brown&#x27;s attorney, Albert &quot;Buddy&quot; Dallas, reported that the marriage was not valid. Hynie was still married to Javed Ahmed, a man from Bangladesh. Hynie claimed Ahmed married her to obtain residency through a Green Card, and that the marriage was annulled, but the annulment did not occur until April 2004. In an attempt to prove her marriage to Brown was valid, she provided a marriage certificate as proof of her marriage to Brown during an interview on CNN with Larry King, but she did not provide King with court records pointing to an annulment of her marriage to Brown or to Ahmed. 

According to Dallas, Brown was angry and hurt that Hynie had concealed her prior marriage from him, and Brown moved to file for annulment from Hynie. Dallas added that though Hynie&#x27;s marriage to Ahmed was annulled after she married Brown, the Brown–Hynie marriage was not valid under South Carolina law because Brown and Hynie did not remarry after the annulment. In August 2003, Brown took out a full-page public notice in &quot;Variety&quot; featuring Hynie, James II and himself on vacation at Disney World to announce that he and Hynie were going their separate ways. 

On January 27, 2015, a judge ruled Hynie as Brown&#x27;s legal widow and that she was now Brown&#x27;s widow for the purpose of determining the distribution of Brown&#x27;s estate. The decision was based on the grounds that Hynie&#x27;s previous marriage was invalid, and that James Brown had abandoned his efforts to annul his own marriage to Hynie. On June 17, 2020, a South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that Hynie was not legally married to Brown due to her failure to annul her previous marriage. The court ruled that she had no right to any part of his estate.

Brown had numerous children. He acknowledged 11 of them, including 5 sons—Teddy (1954–1973), Terry, Larry, Micheal Brown and James Joseph Brown Jr.—and 6 daughters: LaRhonda Petitt, Dr. Yamma Noyola Brown Lumar, Deanna Brown Thomas, Cinnamon Brown, Jeanette Bellinger and Venisha Brown (1964–2018). Brown had eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Brown&#x27;s eldest son, Teddy, died in a car crash on June 14, 1973. 

According to an August 2007, article in the British newspaper &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, DNA tests indicate that Brown also fathered at least three extramarital children. The first one of them to be identified is LaRhonda Pettit (born 1962), a retired flight attendant and teacher who lives in Houston. Another alleged son, Michael Deon Brown, was born in September 1968 to Mary Florence Brown. Despite pleading no contest to a paternity suit brought against him in 1983, Brown never officially acknowledged Michael as his son. During contesting of Brown&#x27;s will, another of the Brown family attorneys, Debra Opri, revealed to Larry King that James Brown wanted a DNA test performed after his death to confirm the paternity of James Brown Jr. (born 2001)—not for Brown Jr.&#x27;s sake but for the sake of the other family members. In April 2007, Hynie selected a guardian ad litem whom she wanted the court to appoint to represent her son, James Brown Jr., in the paternity proceedings. James Brown Jr. was confirmed to be his biological son.

===Drug abuse===
For most of his career, Brown had a strict drug- and alcohol-free policy for any member in his entourage, including band members. He would fire people who disobeyed orders, particularly those who used or abused drugs. Although early members of the Famous Flames were fired for using alcohol, Brown often served a highball consisting of Delaware Punch and moonshine at his St. Albans, Queens, house in the mid-1960s. Some of the original members of Brown&#x27;s 1970s band, the J.B.&#x27;s, including Catfish and Bootsy Collins, intentionally took LSD during a performance in 1971, causing Brown to fire them after the show because he had suspected them of being on drugs all along.

Aide Bob Patton has asserted that he accidentally shared a PCP-laced cannabis joint with Brown in the mid-1970s and &quot;hallucinated for hours&quot;, although Brown &quot;talked about it as if it was only marijuana he was smoking&quot;. By the mid-1980s, it was widely alleged that Brown was using drugs, with Vicki Anderson confirming to journalist Barney Hoskyns that Brown&#x27;s regular use of PCP, colloquially known as &quot;angel dust&quot;, &quot;began before 1982&quot;. After he met and later married Adrienne Rodriguez in 1984, she and Brown began using PCP together. 

This drug usage often resulted in violent outbursts from him, and he was arrested several times for domestic violence against Rodriguez while high on the drug. By January 1988, Brown faced four criminal charges within a 12-month span relating to driving, PCP, and gun possession. After an April 1988 arrest for domestic abuse, Brown went on the CNN program &quot;Sonia Live in L.A.&quot; with host Sonia Friedman. The interview became notorious for Brown&#x27;s irreverent demeanor, with some asserting that Brown was high.

One of Brown&#x27;s former mistresses recalled in a &quot;GQ&quot; magazine article about Brown, some years after his death, that Brown would smoke PCP, &quot;until that got hard to find&quot;, and cocaine, mixed with tobacco in Kool cigarettes. He engaged in the off-label use of sildenafil, maintaining that it gave him &quot;extra energy&quot;. Once, while traveling in a car under the influence of PCP, which he continued to procure dependent on its availability, Brown alleged that passing trees contained psychotronic surveillance technology.

In January 1998, he spent a week in rehab to deal with an addiction to unspecified prescription drugs. A week after his release, he was arrested for an unlawful use of a handgun and possession of cannabis. Prior to his death in December 2006, traces of cocaine were found in the singer&#x27;s urine, when Brown entered Emory University Hospital. His widow suggested Brown would &quot;do crack&quot; with a female acquaintance.

== Legal issues ==

===Theft and assault convictions===
Brown&#x27;s personal life was marred by numerous brushes with the law. At the age of 16, he was convicted of theft, and served three years in juvenile prison. In 1963, during a concert held at Club 15 in Macon, Georgia, while Otis Redding was performing alongside his former band Johnny Jenkins and the Pinetoppers, Brown, reportedly wielding two shotguns, tried to shoot his musical rival Joe Tex. 
The incident led to multiple people being shot and stabbed. Since Brown was still on parole at the time, he relied on his agent Clint Brantley &quot;and a few thousand dollars to make the situation disappear&quot;. According to Jenkins, &quot;seven people got shot&quot;, and after the shootout ended, a man appeared and gave &quot;each one of the injured a hundred dollars apiece not to carry it no further and not to talk to the press&quot;. Brown was never charged for the incident.

On July 16, 1978, after performing at the Apollo, Brown was arrested for reportedly failing to turn in records from one of his radio stations after the station was forced to file for bankruptcy.

Brown was arrested on April 3, 1988, for assault, and again in May 1988 on drug and weapons charges, and again on September 24, 1988, following a high-speed car chase on Interstate 20 near the Georgia–South Carolina state border. He was convicted of carrying an unlicensed pistol and assaulting a police officer, along with various drug-related and driving offenses. He was sentenced to six years in prison. He was released on parole on February 27, 1991, after serving two years of his sentence. Brown&#x27;s FBI file, released to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2007 under the Freedom of Information Act, related Brown&#x27;s claim that the high-speed chase did not occur as claimed by the police, and that local police shot at his car several times during an incident of police harassment, and assaulted him after his arrest. Local authorities found no merit to Brown&#x27;s accusations.

In 1998, a woman named Mary Simons accused Brown in a civil suit of holding her captive for three days, demanding oral sex and firing a gun in his office. Simons&#x27; charge was eventually dismissed. Another civil suit, filed by former background singer Lisa Rushton, alleged that between 1994 and 1999, Brown allegedly demanded sexual favors, and when refused, would cut off her pay and kept her offstage. She claimed that Brown would &quot;place a hand on her buttocks and loudly told her in a crowded restaurant to not look or speak to any other man besides himself&quot;. Rushton eventually withdrew her lawsuit. In another civil suit, a woman named Lisa Agbalaya, who worked for Brown, said the singer would tell her he had &quot;bull testicles&quot;, handed her a pair of zebra-print underwear, told her to wear them while he massaged her with oil, and fired her after she refused. A Los Angeles jury cleared the singer of sexual harassment, but found him liable for wrongful termination.

The police were summoned to Brown&#x27;s residence on July 3, 2000, after he was accused of charging at an electric company repairman with a steak knife, when the repairman visited Brown&#x27;s house to investigate a complaint about having no lights at the residence. In 2003, Brown was pardoned by the South Carolina Department of Probation, Parole, and Pardon Services for past crimes that he was convicted of committing in South Carolina.

===Domestic violence arrests===
Brown was repeatedly arrested for domestic violence. On four occasions between 1987 and 1995, Brown was arrested on charges of assault against his third wife, Adrienne Rodriguez. In one incident, Rodriguez reported to authorities that Brown beat her with an iron pipe and shot at her car. Rodriguez was hospitalized after the last assault in October 1995. Charges were dropped after she died in January 1996.

In January 2004, Brown was arrested in South Carolina on a domestic violence charge, after Tomi Rae Hynie accused him of pushing her to the floor during an argument at their home, where she suffered scratches and bruises to her right arm and hip. In June, Brown pleaded no contest to the domestic violence incident, but served no jail time. Instead, Brown was required to forfeit a US$1,087 bond as punishment.

===Rape accusation===
In January 2005, a woman named Jacque Hollander filed a lawsuit against James Brown, which stemmed from an alleged 1988 rape. When the case was initially heard before a judge in 2002, Hollander&#x27;s claims against Brown were dismissed by the court as the limitations period for filing the suit had expired. Hollander claimed that stress from the alleged assault later caused her to develop Graves&#x27; disease, a chronic thyroid condition. Hollander claimed that the incident took place in South Carolina while she was employed by Brown as a publicist. Hollander alleged that, during her ride in a van with Brown, Brown pulled over to the side of the road and sexually assaulted her while he threatened her with a shotgun.

In her case against Brown, Hollander entered as evidence a DNA sample and a polygraph result. The evidence was not considered due to the limitations defense. Hollander later attempted to bring her case before the Supreme Court, but nothing came of her complaint.

==Later life ==
At the end of his life, James Brown lived in Beech Island, South Carolina, directly across the Savannah River from Augusta, Georgia. According to his longtime manager Charles Bobbit, Brown had been living with Type 2 diabetes, which went undiagnosed for years. In 2004, Brown was successfully treated for prostate cancer. Regardless of his health, Brown maintained his reputation as the &quot;hardest working man in show business&quot; by keeping up with his grueling performance schedule.

===Illness===

On December 23, 2006, Brown became very ill and arrived at his dentist&#x27;s office in Atlanta, Georgia, several hours late. His appointment was for dental implant work. During that visit, Brown&#x27;s dentist observed that he looked &quot;very bad ... weak and dazed&quot;. Instead of performing the work, the dentist advised Brown to see a physician right away about his medical condition.

The following day, Brown went to the Emory Crawford Long Memorial Hospital for medical evaluation and was admitted for observation and treatment. According to Charles Bobbit, his longtime personal manager and friend, Brown had been struggling with a noisy cough since returning from a November trip to Europe. Yet, Bobbit said, the singer had a history of never complaining about being sick and often performed while ill. 

Although Brown had to cancel upcoming concerts in Waterbury, Connecticut, and Englewood, New Jersey, he was confident that the doctor would discharge him from the hospital in time for his scheduled New Year&#x27;s Eve shows at the Count Basie Theatre in New Jersey and the B. B. King Blues Club in New York, in addition to performing a song live on CNN for the Anderson Cooper New Year&#x27;s Eve special. Brown remained hospitalized and his condition worsened throughout the day.

===Death===
Brown died at approximately 1:45 a.m. EST (06:45 UTC) on Christmas Day 2006, at age 73, from congestive heart failure, resulting from complications of pneumonia. Bobbit was at his bedside and later reported that Brown stuttered, &quot;I&#x27;m going away tonight&quot;, then took three long, quiet breaths and fell asleep before dying.

Then-President George W. Bush released a statement calling the musician &quot;an American original.&quot;

In February 2019, an investigation by CNN and other journalists led to suggestions that Brown had been murdered.

===Memorial services===

After Brown&#x27;s death, his relatives, a host of celebrities and thousands of fans gathered, on December 28, 2006, for a public memorial service at the Apollo Theater in New York City and, on December 30, 2006, at the James Brown Arena in Augusta, Georgia. A separate, private ceremony was held in North Augusta, South Carolina, on December 29, 2006, with Brown&#x27;s family in attendance. Celebrities at these various memorial events included Michael Jackson, Jimmy Cliff, Joe Frazier, Buddy Guy, Ice Cube, Ludacris, Dr. Dre, Little Richard, Dick Gregory, MC Hammer, Prince, Jesse Jackson, Ice-T, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bootsy Collins, LL Cool J, Lil Wayne, Lenny Kravitz, 50 Cent, Stevie Wonder and Don King. Rev. Al Sharpton officiated at all of Brown&#x27;s public and private memorial services.
Brown&#x27;s memorial ceremonies were all elaborate, complete with costume changes for the deceased and videos featuring him in concert. His body, placed in a Promethean casket—bronze polished to a golden shine—was driven through the streets of New York to the Apollo Theater in a white, glass-encased horse-drawn carriage. In Augusta, Georgia, his memorial procession stopped to pay respects at his statue, en route to the James Brown Arena. During the public memorial there, a video showed Brown&#x27;s last performance in Augusta, Georgia, with the Ray Charles version of &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; playing soulfully in the background. 

His last backup band, the Soul Generals, played some of his hits during the tribute at the arena. The group was joined by Bootsy Collins on bass, with MC Hammer performing a dance in James Brown style. Former Temptations lead singer Ali-Ollie Woodson performed &quot;Walk Around Heaven All Day&quot; at the memorial services. Brown was buried in a crypt at his daughter&#x27;s home in Beech Island, South Carolina.

===Last will and testament===
Brown signed his last will and testament on August 1, 2000, before J. Strom Thurmond Jr., an attorney for the estate. The irrevocable trust, separate and apart from Brown&#x27;s will, was created on his behalf, that same year, by his attorney, Albert &quot;Buddy&quot; Dallas, one of three personal representatives of Brown&#x27;s estate. His will covered the disposition of his personal assets, such as clothing, cars, and jewelry, while the irrevocable trust covered the disposition of the music rights, business assets of James Brown Enterprises, and his Beech Island, South Carolina estate.

During the reading of the will on January 11, 2007, Thurmond revealed that Brown&#x27;s six adult living children, Terry Brown, Larry Brown, Daryl Brown, Yamma Brown Lumar, Deanna Brown Thomas and Venisha Brown, were named in the document. Hynie and James II were not mentioned as heirs. Brown&#x27;s will was signed 10 months before James II was born and more than a year before Brown&#x27;s marriage to Tomi Rae Hynie. Like Brown&#x27;s will, his irrevocable trust omitted Hynie and James II as recipients of Brown&#x27;s property. The irrevocable trust had been established before, and not amended since, the birth of James II.

On January 24, 2007, Brown&#x27;s children filed a lawsuit, petitioning the court to remove the personal representatives from the estate, including Brown&#x27;s attorney, as well as trustee Albert &quot;Buddy&quot; Dallas, and appoint a special administrator because of perceived impropriety and alleged mismanagement of Brown&#x27;s assets. On January 31, 2007, Hynie filed a lawsuit against Brown&#x27;s estate, challenging the validity of the will and the irrevocable trust. Hynie&#x27;s suit asked the court both to recognize her as Brown&#x27;s widow and to appoint a special administrator for the estate.

On January 27, 2015, Judge Doyet Early III ruled that Tomi Rae Hynie Brown was officially the widow of James Brown. The decision was based on the grounds that Hynie&#x27;s previous marriage was invalid and that James Brown had abandoned his efforts to annul his own marriage to Hynie.

On February 19, 2015, the South Carolina Supreme Court intervened, halting all lower court actions in the estate and undertaking to review previous actions itself. The South Carolina Court of Appeals in July 2018 ruled that Hynie was, in fact, Mr. Brown&#x27;s wife. In 2020, the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that Hynie had not been legally married to Brown and did not have a right to his estate. It was reported in July 2021 that Brown&#x27;s family had reached a settlement ending the 15-year battle over the estate.

==Legacy==
Brown received awards and honors throughout his lifetime and after his death. In 1993, the City Council of Steamboat Springs, Colorado, conducted a poll of residents to choose a new name for the bridge that crossed the Yampa River on Shield Drive. The winning name, with 7,717 votes, was &quot;James Brown Soul Center of the Universe Bridge&quot;. The bridge was officially dedicated in September 1993, and Brown appeared at the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the event. A petition was started by local ranchers to return the name to &quot;Stockbridge&quot; for historical reasons, but they backed off after citizens defeated their efforts because of the popularity of Brown&#x27;s name. Brown returned to Steamboat Springs, Colorado, on July 4, 2002, for an outdoor festival, performing with bands such as the String Cheese Incident.

During his long career, Brown received many prestigious music industry awards and honors. In 1983 he was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. Brown was one of the first inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at its inaugural induction dinner in New York on January 23, 1986. At that time, the members of his original vocal group, the Famous Flames, Bobby Byrd, Johnny Terry, Bobby Bennett, and Lloyd Stallworth, were not inducted. On April 14, 2012, the Famous Flames were automatically and retroactively inducted into the Hall of Fame alongside Brown, without the need for nomination and voting, on the basis that they should have been inducted with him in 1986. 

On February 25, 1992, Brown was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 34th annual Grammy Awards. Exactly a year later, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 4th annual Rhythm &amp; Blues Foundation Pioneer Awards. A ceremony was held for Brown on January 10, 1997, to honor him with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

On June 15, 2000, Brown was honored as an inductee to the New York Songwriters Hall of Fame. On August 6, 2002, he was honored as the first BMI Urban Icon at the BMI Urban Awards. His BMI accolades include an impressive ten R&amp;B Awards and six Pop Awards. On November 14, 2006, Brown was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame, and he was one of several inductees to perform at the ceremony. In recognition of his accomplishments as an entertainer, Brown was a recipient of Kennedy Center Honors on December 7, 2003. In 2004 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked James Brown as No. 7 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Rick Rubin wrote in appreciation: In one sense, James Brown is like Johnny Cash. Johnny is considered one of the kings of country music, but there are a lot of people who like Johnny but don&#x27;t like country music. It&#x27;s the same with James Brown and R&amp;B. His music is singular — the feel and tone of it. James Brown is his own genre. He was a great editor — as a songwriter, producer and bandleader. He kept things sparse. He knew that was important. And he had the best players, the funkiest of all bands. If Clyde Stubblefield had been drumming on a Motown session, they would not have let him play what he did with James on &quot;Funky Drummer.&quot; James&#x27; vision allowed that music to get out. And the music always came from the groove, whereas for so many R&amp;B and Motown artists at the time it was more about conventional songs. James Brown&#x27;s songs are not conventional. &quot;I Got You,&quot; &quot;Out of Sight&quot; — they are ultimately vehicles for unique, even bizarre grooves... I first saw James Brown around 1980, between my junior and senior years in high school. It was in Boston. It was in a catering hall, with folding chairs. And it was one of the greatest musical experiences of my life. His dancing and singing were incredible, and he played a Hammond B3 organ tufted with red leather, with &quot;Godfather&quot; in studs written across the front.

In a 2010 article for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Robert Christgau called Brown &quot;the greatest musician of the rock era&quot;. He appeared on the BET Awards June 24, 2003, and received the Lifetime Achievement Award presented by Michael Jackson, and performed with him. In 2004, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Aretha Franklin.
Brown was honored in his hometown of Augusta, Georgia, for his philanthropy and civic activities. In November 1993, Mayor Charles DeVaney of Augusta held a ceremony to dedicate a section of 9th Street between Broad and Twiggs Streets, renamed &quot;James Brown Boulevard&quot;, in the entertainer&#x27;s honor. In May 2005, as a 72nd birthday present for Brown, the city of Augusta unveiled a life-sized bronze James Brown statue on Broad Street. The statue was to have been dedicated a year earlier, but the ceremony was put on hold because of a domestic abuse charge that Brown faced at the time. 

In 2005, Charles &quot;Champ&quot; Walker and the We Feel Good Committee went before the County commission and received approval to change Augusta&#x27;s slogan to &quot;We Feel Good&quot;. Afterward, officials renamed the city&#x27;s civic center the James Brown Arena. James Brown attended a ceremony for the unveiling of the namesake center on October 15, 2006.

On December 30, 2006, during the public memorial service at the James Brown Arena, Shirley A. R. Lewis, president of Paine College, a historically black college in Augusta, Georgia, posthumously bestowed an honorary doctorate upon Brown, in recognition and honor of his many contributions to the school in its times of need. Brown had originally been scheduled to receive the honorary doctorate from Paine College during its May 2007 commencement.

During the 49th Annual Grammy Awards presentation on February 11, 2007, James Brown&#x27;s famous cape was draped over a microphone by Danny Ray at the end of a montage in honor of notable people in the music industry who died during the previous year. Earlier that evening, Christina Aguilera delivered an impassioned performance of Brown&#x27;s hit &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s Man&#x27;s Man&#x27;s World&quot; followed by a standing ovation, while Chris Brown performed a dance routine in honor of James Brown.

In August 2013, the R&amp;B Music Hall of Fame honored and inducted James Brown at a ceremony held at the Waetjen Auditorium at Cleveland State University.

ART THE BOX began in early 2015 as a collaboration between three organizations: the City of Augusta, the Downtown Development Authority and the Greater Augusta Arts Council. 19 local artists were selected by a committee to create art on 23 local traffic signal control cabinets (TSCCs). A competition was held to create the James Brown Tribute Box on the corner of James Brown Blvd. (9th Ave.) and Broad St. This box was designed and painted by local artist, Ms. Robbie Pitts Bellamy and has become a favorite photo opportunity to visitors and locals in Augusta, Georgia.

&quot;I have a lot of musical heroes but I think James Brown is at the top of the list&quot;, remarked Public Enemy&#x27;s Chuck D. &quot;Absolutely the funkiest man on Earth ... In a black household, James Brown is part of the fabric – Motown, Stax, Atlantic and James Brown.&quot; Tom Waits recalls &quot;I first saw James Brown in 1962 at an outdoor theatre in San Diego and it was indescribable... it was like putting a finger in a light socket... It was really like seeing mass at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral on Christmas.&quot; In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Brown at No. 44 on their list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time. 

On April 24, 2023, James Brown was inducted into the newly established Atlantic City Walk Of Fame presented by The National R&amp;B Music Society Inc. Brown&#x27;s daughter Deanna Brown Thomas accepted the honor on his behalf. The unveiling and induction ceremony took place at Brighton Park in Atlantic City, NJ. Brown was inducted by Bowlegged Lou of the production team Full Force. Other inductees included, Little Anthony &amp; The Imperials, The Delfonics and Grover Washington Jr.

==Tributes==
As a tribute to James Brown, the Rolling Stones covered the song, &quot;I&#x27;ll Go Crazy&quot; from Brown&#x27;s &quot;Live at the Apollo&quot; album, during their 2007 European tour. Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page has remarked, &quot;He [James Brown] was almost a musical genre in his own right and he changed and moved forward the whole time so people were able to learn from him.&quot;

On December 22, 2007, the first annual &quot;Tribute Fit For the King of King Records&quot; in honor of James Brown was held at the Madison Theater in Covington, Kentucky. The tribute, organized by Bootsy Collins, featured Tony Wilson as Young James Brown with appearances by Afrika Bambaataa, Chuck D of Public Enemy, the Soul Generals, Buckethead, Freekbass, Triage and many of Brown&#x27;s surviving family members. Comedian Michael Coyer was the MC for the event. During the show, the mayor of Cincinnati proclaimed December 22 as James Brown Day.

<text>Jonathan Bruce Postel (; August 6, 1943 – October 16, 1998) was an American computer scientist who made many significant contributions to the development of the Internet, particularly with respect to standards. He is known principally for being the Editor of the Request for Comment (RFC) document series, for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and for administering the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) until his death.

During his lifetime he was referred to as the &quot;god of the Internet&quot; for his comprehensive influence; Postel himself noted that this &quot;compliment&quot; came with a barb, the suggestion that he should be replaced by a &quot;professional,&quot; and responded with typical self-effacing matter-of-factness: &quot;Of course, there isn’t any &#x27;God of the Internet.&#x27; The Internet works because a lot of people cooperate to do things together.&quot;

==Career==
Postel attended Van Nuys High School, and then UCLA where he earned his B.S. (1966) as well as his M.S. (1968) in Engineering. There he completed his Ph.D. in computer science in 1974, with Dave Farber as his thesis advisor.
Postel started work at UCLA on 23 December 1969 as a Postgraduate Research Engineer (I) where he was involved in early work on the ARPANET. He was involved in the development of the Internet domain system and, at his instigation, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn developed a second set of protocols for handling data between networks, which is now known as Internet protocol suite. Together with Cerf and Steve Crocker, Postel worked on implementing most of the ARPANET protocols. Cerf would later become one of the principal designers of the TCP/IP standard, which works because of the sentence known as Postel&#x27;s Law.

Postel worked with ARPANET until 24 August 1973 when he left to join MITRE Corporation. He assisted with Network Information Center, which was being set up at SRI by Elizabeth Feinler. In March 1977, he joined the Information Sciences Institute at the University of Southern California as a research scientist.

Postel was the RFC Editor from 1969 until his death, and wrote and edited many important RFCs, including RFC 791, RFC 792 and RFC 793, which define the basic protocols of the Internet protocol suite, and RFC 2223, &quot;Instructions to RFC Authors&quot;. Between 1982 and 1984 Postel co-authored the RFCs which became the foundation of today&#x27;s DNS (RFC 819, RFC 881, RFC 882 and RFC 920) which were joined in 1995 by RFC 1591 which he also co-wrote. In total, he wrote or co-authored more than 20 RFCs.

Postel served on the Internet Architecture Board and its predecessors for many years. He was the Director of the names and number assignment clearinghouse, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), from its inception. He was the first member of the Internet Society, and was on its Board of Trustees. He was the original and long-time .us Top-Level Domain administrator. He also managed the Los Nettos Network.

All of the above were part-time activities he assumed in conjunction with his primary position as Director of the Computer Networks Division, Division 7, of the Information Sciences Institute at the University of Southern California.

===DNS Root Authority test, U.S. response===

On January 28, 1998, Postel, as a test, emailed eight of the twelve operators of Internet&#x27;s regional root nameservers on his own authority and instructed them to reconfigure their servers, changing the root zone server from then SAIC subsidiary Network Solutions&#x27; A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET (198.41.0.4) to IANA&#x27;s DNSROOT.IANA.ORG (198.32.1.98). The operators complied with Postel&#x27;s instructions, thus dividing control of Internet naming between the non-government operators with IANA and the 4 remaining U.S. Government roots at NASA, DoD, and BRL with NSI. Though usage of the Internet was not interrupted, Postel was threatened by US Presidential science advisor Ira Magaziner with the statement &quot;You&#x27;ll never work on the Internet again&quot; and was ordered to end the test, which he did. Within a week, the US NTIA issued &quot;A proposal to improve technical management of Internet names and addresses&quot;, including changes to authority over the Internet DNS root zone, which ultimately, and controversially, increased U.S. control.

==Death==
On October 16, 1998, Postel died of complications from heart surgery in Los Angeles. He was recovering from a surgery to replace a leaking heart valve.

== Legacy ==

The significance of Jon Postel&#x27;s contributions to building the Internet, both technical and personal, were such that a memorial recollection of his life and his work forms part of the core technical literature sequence of the Internet in the form of RFC2468 &quot;I Remember IANA&quot;, written by Vint Cerf.

The Postel Center at Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California, is named in his honor, as is the annual Postel Award. In 2012, Postel was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame. The Channel Islands&#x27; Domain Registry building was named after him in early 2016.

Another tribute, &quot;Working with Jon: Tribute delivered at UCLA, October 30, 1998&quot;
(RFC2441), was written by Danny Cohen.

Perhaps his most famous legacy is from RFC760, which includes a robustness principle often called Postel&#x27;s law: &quot;an implementation should be conservative in its sending behavior, and liberal in its receiving behavior&quot; (reworded in RFC 1122 as &quot;Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send&quot;).

The Jonathan B. Postel Service Award is an award named after Postel. The award has been presented most years since 1999 by the Internet Society to &quot;honor a person who has made outstanding contributions in service to the data communications community.&quot; The first recipient of the award was Postel himself, posthumously. The award was created by Vint Cerf as chairman of the Internet Society and announced in &quot;I remember IANA&quot; published as RFC 2468.

<text>Joyce Kathleen Reynolds (March 8, 1952 – December 28, 2015) was an American computer scientist who played a significant role in developing protocols underlying the Internet. She authored or co-authored many RFCs, most notably those introducing and specifying the Telnet, FTP, and POP protocols.

== Career ==
Reynolds held bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in social sciences from the University of Southern California.

From 1983 until 1998, she worked with Jon Postel to develop early functions of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, such as the global allocation of IP addresses, Autonomous System (AS) number allocation, and management of the root zone of the Domain Name System (DNS). After Postel&#x27;s death in 1998, Reynolds helped supervise the transition of the IANA functions to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. She worked with ICANN in this role until 2001, while remaining an employee of ISI.

From 1987 to 2006, she served on the editorial team of the Request for Comments series, co-leading the RFC Editor function at the ISI from 1998 until 2006.

As Area Director of the User Services area, she was a member of the Internet Engineering Steering Group of the IETF from 1990 to March 1998.

== Death ==
Reynolds died due to complications from cancer on December 28, 2015, at the age of 63.

== Recognition ==
With Bob Braden, she received the 2006 Postel Award in recognition of her services to the Internet. She is mentioned, along with a brief biography, in RFC 1336, &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in the Internet&quot; (1992). Upon her death, former IETF Chairman Brian Carpenter suggested that &quot;What would Joyce have said?&quot; should be a guiding question for the organization.

<doc id="15769" wikidata="Q251113" url="?curid=15769" title="Julmust">
<text>Julmust ( &quot;Christmas&quot; and &#x27; English: &#x27;[[must]]&#x27; &quot;not-yet-fermented fruit juice&quot;) is a [[soft drink]] that is mainly consumed in [[Sweden]] around [[Christmas]]. During [[Easter]], the name is (from&#x27;, &quot;Easter&quot;). During the rest of the year, it is sometimes sold under the name &quot;must&quot;. The content is the same regardless of the marketing name, and the drink is most closely associated with Christmas. 45 million litres of &quot;julmust&quot; are consumed during December, which is around 50% of the total soft drink volume in December and 75% of the total yearly must sales. Must was created by Harry Roberts and his father Robert Roberts in 1910 as a non-alcoholic alternative to beer.

== Ingredients == 

The syrup is still made exclusively by Roberts in Örebro. The syrup is sold to different soft drink manufacturers who then make the final product in their own way. This means that the must from different companies does not taste the same, although they are made of the same syrup. 

Must is made of carbonated water, sugar, hop extract, malt extract, spices, caramel colouring, citric acid, and preservatives. The hops and malt extracts give the must a somewhat root beer-like taste without the sassafras – or British/Caribbean malt drinks such as Supermalt. It can be aged provided it is stored in a glass bottle. Some people buy &quot;julmust&quot; in December only to store it a year before drinking it. In 2013, a rumour occurred that the EU would ban julmust due to a directive banning the selling of malt beverages containing caramel colouring. The rumour however turned out to be false since julmust is not a fermented beverage and hence not affected by the directive.

== &quot;Julmust&quot; and Coca-Cola ==

In Sweden, &quot;julmust&quot; outsells Coca-Cola during the Christmas season; in fact, the consumption of Coca-Cola and other soft drinks drops by as much as 50% over the holiday. This was quoted as one of the main reasons that The Coca-Cola Company broke away from their contract with the local brewer Pripps and started Coca-Cola Drycker Sverige AB instead. Coca-Cola Drycker Sverige AB produced its own &quot;julmust&quot;, with The Coca-Cola Company&#x27;s name occupying only a small space on the label. Their &quot;julmust&quot; was never advertised until 2004, when Coca-Cola started marketing their &quot;julmust&quot; under the brand &quot;Bjäre julmust&quot;, but they bought the syrup from Roberts AB. By 2007, the &quot;Bjäre julmust&quot; was only sold at McDonald&#x27;s restaurants and it had completely disappeared from Coca-Colas range of products by Christmas 2008, only to return for Christmas 2011.

<doc id="15770" wikidata="Q33977" url="?curid=15770" title="Jules Verne">
<text>Jules Gabriel Verne (; ; 8 February 1828 – 24 March 1905) was a French novelist, poet and playwright. 

His collaboration with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel led to the creation of the &quot;Voyages extraordinaires&quot;, a series of bestselling adventure novels including &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; (1864), &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; (1870), and &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot; (1872). His novels, always well-researched according to the scientific knowledge then available, are generally set in the second half of the 19th century, taking into account the technological advances of the time.

In addition to his novels, he wrote numerous plays, short stories, autobiographical accounts, poetry, songs, and scientific, artistic and literary studies. His work has been adapted for film and television since the beginning of cinema, as well as for comic books, theater, opera, music and video games.

Verne is considered to be an important author in France and most of Europe, where he has had a wide influence on the literary avant-garde and on surrealism. His reputation was markedly different in the Anglosphere where he had often been labeled a writer of genre fiction or children&#x27;s books, largely because of the highly abridged and altered translations in which his novels have often been printed. Since the 1980s, his literary reputation has improved.

Jules Verne has been the second most-translated author in the world since 1979, ranking below Agatha Christie and above William Shakespeare. He has sometimes been called the &quot;father of science fiction&quot;, a title that has also been given to H. G. Wells and Hugo Gernsback. In the 2010s, he was the most translated French author in the world. In France, 2005 was declared &quot;Jules Verne Year&quot; on the occasion of the centenary of the writer&#x27;s death.

==Life==

===Early life===
Verne was born on 8 February 1828, on Île Feydeau, a then small artificial island on the river Loire within the town of Nantes (later filled in and incorporated into the surrounding land area), in No. 4 Rue Olivier-de-Clisson, the house of his maternal grandmother Dame Sophie Marie Adélaïde Julienne Allotte de La Fuÿe (born Guillochet de La Perrière). His parents were Pierre Verne, an &quot;avoué&quot; originally from Provins, and Sophie Allotte de La Fuÿe, a Nantes woman from a local family of navigators and shipowners, of distant Scottish descent. In 1829, the Verne family moved some hundred metres away to No. 2 Quai Jean-Bart, where Verne&#x27;s brother Paul was born the same year. Three sisters, Anne &quot;Anna&quot; (1836), Mathilde (1839), and Marie (1842), followed.

In 1834, at the age of six, Verne was sent to boarding school at 5 Place du Bouffay in Nantes. The teacher, Madame Sambin, was the widow of a naval captain who had disappeared some 30 years before. Madame Sambin often told the students that her husband was a shipwrecked castaway and that he would eventually return like Robinson Crusoe from his desert island paradise. The theme of the robinsonade would stay with Verne throughout his life and appear in many of his novels, some of which include &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot; (1874), &quot;Second Fatherland&quot; (1900), and &quot;The School for Robinsons&quot; (1882).

In 1836, Verne went on to École Saint‑Stanislas, a Catholic school suiting the pious religious tastes of his father. Verne quickly distinguished himself in &quot;mémoire&quot; (recitation from memory), geography, Greek, Latin, and singing. In the same year, 1836, Pierre Verne bought a vacation house at 29 Rue des Réformés in the village of Chantenay (now part of Nantes) on the Loire. In his brief memoir &quot;Souvenirs d&#x27;enfance et de jeunesse&quot; (&quot;Memories of Childhood and Youth&quot;, 1890), Verne recalled a deep fascination with the river and with the many merchant vessels navigating it. He also took vacations at Brains, in the house of his uncle Prudent Allotte, a retired shipowner, who had gone around the world and served as mayor of Brains from 1828 to 1837. Verne took joy in playing interminable rounds of the Game of the Goose with his uncle, and both the game and his uncle&#x27;s name would be memorialized in two late novels (&quot;The Will of an Eccentric&quot; (1900) and &quot;Robur the Conqueror&quot; (1886), respectively).

Legend has it that in 1839, at the age of 11, Verne secretly procured a spot as cabin boy on the three-mast ship &quot;Coralie&quot; with the intention of traveling to the Indies and bringing back a coral necklace for his cousin Caroline. The evening the ship set out for the Indies, it stopped first at Paimboeuf where Pierre Verne arrived just in time to catch his son and make him promise to travel &quot;only in his imagination&quot;. It is now known that the legend is an exaggerated tale invented by Verne&#x27;s first biographer, his niece Marguerite Allotte de la Füye, though it may have been inspired by a real incident.

In 1840, the Vernes moved again to a large apartment at No. 6 Rue Jean-Jacques-Rousseau, where the family&#x27;s youngest child, Marie, was born in 1842. In the same year Verne entered another religious school, the Petit Séminaire de Saint-Donatien, as a lay student. His unfinished novel &quot;Un prêtre en 1839&quot; (&quot;A Priest in 1839&quot;), written in his teens and the earliest of his prose works to survive, describes the seminary in disparaging terms. From 1844 to 1846, Verne and his brother were enrolled in the Lycée Royal (now the Lycée Georges-Clemenceau) in Nantes. After finishing classes in rhetoric and philosophy, he took the baccalauréat at Rennes and received the grade &quot;Good Enough&quot; on 29 July 1846.

By 1847, when Verne was 19, he had taken seriously to writing long works in the style of Victor Hugo, beginning &quot;Un prêtre en 1839&quot; and seeing two verse tragedies, &quot;Alexandre VI&quot; and &quot;La Conspiration des poudres&quot; (&quot;The Gunpowder Plot&quot;), to completion. However, his father took it for granted that Verne, being the firstborn son of the family, would not attempt to make money in literature but would instead inherit the family law practice.

In 1847, Verne&#x27;s father sent him to Paris, primarily to begin his studies in law school, and secondarily (according to family legend) to distance him temporarily from Nantes. His cousin Caroline, with whom he was in love, was married on 27 April 1847, to Émile Dezaunay, a man of 40, with whom she would have five children.

After a short stay in Paris, where he passed first-year law exams, Verne returned to Nantes for his father&#x27;s help in preparing for the second year. (Provincial law students were in that era required to go to Paris to take exams.) While in Nantes, he met Rose Herminie Arnaud Grossetière, a young woman one year his senior, and fell intensely in love with her. He wrote and dedicated some thirty poems to her, including &quot;La Fille de l&#x27;air&quot; (&quot;The Daughter of Air&quot;), which describes her as &quot;blonde and enchanting / winged and transparent&quot;. His passion seems to have been reciprocated, at least for a short time, but Grossetière&#x27;s parents frowned upon the idea of their daughter marrying a young student of uncertain future. They married her instead to Armand Terrien de la Haye, a rich landowner ten years her senior, on 19 July 1848.

The sudden marriage sent Verne into deep frustration. He wrote a hallucinatory letter to his mother, apparently composed in a state of half-drunkenness, in which under pretext of a dream he described his misery. This requited but aborted love affair seems to have permanently marked the author and his work, and his novels include a significant number of young women married against their will (Gérande in &quot;Master Zacharius&quot; (1854), Sava in &quot;Mathias Sandorf&quot; (1885), Ellen in &quot;A Floating City&quot; (1871), etc.), to such an extent that the scholar Christian Chelebourg attributed the recurring theme to a &quot;Herminie complex&quot;. The incident also led Verne to bear a grudge against his birthplace and Nantes society, which he criticized in his poem &quot;La sixième ville de France&quot; (&quot;The Sixth City of France&quot;).

===Studies in Paris===
In July 1848, Verne left Nantes again for Paris, where his father intended him to finish law studies and take up law as a profession. He obtained permission from his father to rent a furnished apartment at 24 Rue de l&#x27;Ancienne-Comédie, which he shared with Édouard Bonamy, another student of Nantes origin. (On his 1847 Paris visit, Verne had stayed at 2 Rue Thérèse, the house of his aunt Charuel, on the Butte Saint-Roch.)

Verne arrived in Paris during a time of political upheaval: the French Revolution of 1848. In February, Louis Philippe I had been overthrown and had fled; on 24 February, a provisional government of the French Second Republic took power, but political demonstrations continued, and social tension remained. In June, barricades went up in Paris, and the government sent Louis-Eugène Cavaignac to crush the insurrection. Verne entered the city shortly before the election of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte as the first president of the Republic, a state of affairs that would last until the French coup of 1851. In a letter to his family, Verne described the bombarded state of the city after the recent June Days uprising but assured them that the anniversary of Bastille Day had gone by without any significant conflict.
Verne used his family connections to make an entrance into Paris society. His uncle Francisque de Chatêaubourg introduced him into literary salons, and Verne particularly frequented those of Mme de Barrère, a friend of his mother&#x27;s. While continuing his law studies, he fed his passion for the theater, writing numerous plays. Verne later recalled: &quot;I was greatly under the influence of Victor Hugo, indeed, very excited by reading and re-reading his works. At that time I could have recited by heart whole pages of &quot;Notre Dame de Paris&quot;, but it was his dramatic work that most influenced me.&quot; Another source of creative stimulation came from a neighbor: living on the same floor in the Rue de l&#x27;Ancienne-Comédie apartment house was a young composer, Aristide Hignard, with whom Verne soon became good friends, and Verne wrote several texts for Hignard to set as chansons.

During this period, Verne&#x27;s letters to his parents primarily focused on expenses and on a suddenly appearing series of violent stomach cramps, the first of many he would suffer from during his life. (Modern scholars have hypothesized that he suffered from colitis; Verne believed the illness to have been inherited from his mother&#x27;s side.) Rumors of an outbreak of cholera in March 1849 exacerbated these medical concerns. Yet another health problem would strike in 1851 when Verne suffered the first of four attacks of facial paralysis. These attacks, rather than being psychosomatic, were due to an inflammation in the middle ear, though this cause remained unknown to Verne during his life.

In the same year, Verne was required to enlist in the French army, but the sortition process spared him, to his great relief. He wrote to his father: &quot;You should already know, dear papa, what I think of the military life, and of these domestic servants in livery. ... You have to abandon all dignity to perform such functions.&quot; Verne&#x27;s strong antiwar sentiments, to the dismay of his father, would remain steadfast throughout his life.

Though writing profusely and frequenting the salons, Verne diligently pursued his law studies and graduated with a &quot;licence en droit&quot; in January 1851.

===Literary debut===
Thanks to his visits to salons, Verne came into contact in 1849 with Alexandre Dumas through the mutual acquaintance of a celebrated chirologist of the time, the Chevalier d&#x27;Arpentigny. Verne became close friends with Dumas&#x27; son, Alexandre Dumas fils, and showed him a manuscript for a stage comedy, &quot;Les Pailles rompues&quot; (&quot;The Broken Straws&quot;). The two young men revised the play together, and Dumas, through arrangements with his father, had it produced by the Opéra-National at the Théâtre Historique in Paris, opening on 12 June 1850.
In 1851, Verne met with a fellow writer from Nantes, Pierre-Michel-François Chevalier (known as &quot;Pitre-Chevalier&quot;), the editor-in-chief of the magazine &quot;Musée des familles&quot; (&quot;The Family Museum&quot;). Pitre-Chevalier was looking for articles about geography, history, science, and technology, and was keen to make sure that the educational component would be made accessible to large popular audiences using a straightforward prose style or an engaging fictional story. Verne, with his delight in diligent research, especially in geography, was a natural for the job. Verne first offered him a short historical adventure story, &quot;The First Ships of the Mexican Navy&quot;, written in the style of James Fenimore Cooper, whose novels had deeply influenced him. Pitre-Chevalier published it in July 1851, and in the same year published a second short story by Verne, &quot;A Voyage in a Balloon&quot; (August 1851). The latter story, with its combination of adventurous narrative, travel themes, and detailed historical research, would later be described by Verne as &quot;the first indication of the line of novel that I was destined to follow&quot;.

Dumas fils put Verne in contact with Jules Seveste, a stage director who had taken over the directorship of the Théâtre Historique and renamed it the Théâtre Lyrique. Seveste offered Verne the job of secretary of the theater, with little or no salary attached. Verne accepted, using the opportunity to write and produce several comic operas written in collaboration with Hignard and the prolific librettist Michel Carré. To celebrate his employment at the Théâtre Lyrique, Verne joined with ten friends to found a bachelors&#x27; dining club, the &quot;Onze-sans-femme&quot; (&quot;Eleven Bachelors&quot;).

For some time, Verne&#x27;s father pressed him to abandon his writing and begin a business as a lawyer. However, Verne argued in his letters that he could only find success in literature. The pressure to plan for a secure future in law reached its climax in January 1852, when his father offered Verne his own Nantes law practice. Faced with this ultimatum, Verne decided conclusively to continue his literary life and refuse the job, writing: &quot;Am I not right to follow my own instincts? It&#x27;s because I know who I am that I realize what I can be one day.&quot;
Meanwhile, Verne was spending much time at the , conducting research for his stories and feeding his passion for science and recent discoveries, especially in geography. It was in this period that Verne met the illustrious geographer and explorer Jacques Arago, who continued to travel extensively despite his blindness (he had lost his sight completely in 1837). The two men became good friends, and Arago&#x27;s innovative and witty accounts of his travels led Verne toward a newly developing genre of literature: that of travel writing.

In 1852, two new pieces from Verne appeared in the &quot;Musée des familles&quot;: &quot;Martin Paz&quot;, a novella set in Lima, which Verne wrote in 1851 and published 10 July through 11 August 1852, and &quot;Les Châteaux en Californie, ou, Pierre qui roule n&#x27;amasse pas mousse&quot; (&quot;The Castles in California, or, A Rolling Stone Gathers No Moss&quot;), a one-act comedy full of racy double entendres. In April and May 1854, the magazine published Verne&#x27;s short story &quot;Master Zacharius&quot;, an E. T. A. Hoffmann-like fantasy featuring a sharp condemnation of scientific hubris and ambition, followed soon afterward by &quot;A Winter Amid the Ice&quot;, a polar adventure story whose themes closely anticipated many of Verne&#x27;s novels. The &quot;Musée&quot; also published some nonfiction popular science articles which, though unsigned, are generally attributed to Verne. Verne&#x27;s work for the magazine was cut short in 1856 when he had a serious quarrel with Pitre-Chevalier and refused to continue contributing (a refusal he would maintain until 1863, when Pitre-Chevalier died, and the magazine went to new editorship).

While writing stories and articles for Pitre-Chevalier, Verne began to form the idea of inventing a new kind of novel, a &quot;Roman de la Science&quot; (&quot;novel of science&quot;), which would allow him to incorporate large amounts of the factual information he so enjoyed researching in the Bibliothèque. He is said to have discussed the project with the elder Alexandre Dumas, who had tried something similar with an unfinished novel, &quot;Isaac Laquedem&quot;, and who enthusiastically encouraged Verne&#x27;s project.

At the end of 1854, another outbreak of cholera led to the death of Jules Seveste, Verne&#x27;s employer at the Théâtre Lyrique and by then a good friend. Though his contract only held him to a further year of service, Verne remained connected to the theater for several years after Seveste&#x27;s death, seeing additional productions to fruition. He also continued to write plays and musical comedies, most of which were not performed.

===Family===
In May 1856, Verne traveled to Amiens to be the best man at the wedding of a Nantes friend, Auguste Lelarge, to an Amiens woman named Aimée du Fraysne de Viane. Verne, invited to stay with the bride&#x27;s family, took to them warmly, befriending the entire household and finding himself increasingly attracted to the bride&#x27;s sister, Honorine Anne Hébée Morel (née du Fraysne de Viane), a widow aged 26 with two young children. Hoping to find a secure source of income, as well as a chance to court Morel in earnest, he jumped at her brother&#x27;s offer to go into business with a broker. Verne&#x27;s father was initially dubious but gave in to his son&#x27;s requests for approval in November 1856. With his financial situation finally looking promising, Verne won the favor of Morel and her family, and the couple were married on 10 January 1857.

Verne plunged into his new business obligations, leaving his work at the Théâtre Lyrique and taking up a full-time job as an &quot;agent de change&quot; on the Paris Bourse, where he became the associate of the broker Fernand Eggly. Verne woke up early each morning so that he would have time to write, before going to the Bourse for the day&#x27;s work; in the rest of his spare time, he continued to consort with the &quot;Onze-Sans-Femme&quot; club (all eleven of its &quot;bachelors&quot; had by this time married). He also continued to frequent the Bibliothèque to do scientific and historical research, much of which he copied onto notecards for future use—a system he would continue for the rest of his life. According to the recollections of a colleague, Verne &quot;did better in repartee than in business&quot;.

In July 1858, Verne and Aristide Hignard seized an opportunity offered by Hignard&#x27;s brother: a sea voyage, at no charge, from Bordeaux to Liverpool and Scotland. The journey, Verne&#x27;s first trip outside France, deeply impressed him, and upon his return to Paris he fictionalized his recollections to form the backbone of a semi-autobiographical novel, &quot;Backwards to Britain&quot; (written in the autumn and winter of 1859–1860 and not published until 1989). A second complimentary voyage in 1861 took Hignard and Verne to Stockholm, from where they traveled to Christiania and through Telemark. Verne left Hignard in Denmark to return in haste to Paris, but missed the birth on 3 August 1861 of his only biological son, Michel.

Meanwhile, Verne continued work on the idea of a &quot;Roman de la Science&quot;, which he developed in a rough draft, inspired, according to his recollections, by his &quot;love for maps and the great explorers of the world&quot;. It took shape as a story of travel across Africa and would eventually become his first published novel, &quot;Five Weeks in a Balloon&quot;.

===Hetzel===

In 1862, through their mutual acquaintance Alfred de Bréhat, Verne came into contact with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel, and submitted to him the manuscript of his developing novel, then called &quot;Voyage en Ballon&quot;. Hetzel, already the publisher of Honoré de Balzac, George Sand, Victor Hugo, and other well-known authors, had long been planning to launch a high-quality family magazine in which entertaining fiction would combine with scientific education. He saw Verne, with his demonstrated inclination toward scrupulously researched adventure stories, as an ideal contributor for such a magazine, and accepted the novel, giving Verne suggestions for improvement. Verne made the proposed revisions within two weeks and returned to Hetzel with the final draft, now titled &quot;Five Weeks in a Balloon&quot;. It was published by Hetzel on 31 January 1863.

To secure his services for the planned magazine, to be called the &quot;Magasin d&#x27;Éducation et de Récréation&quot; (&quot;Magazine of Education and Recreation&quot;), Hetzel also drew up a long-term contract in which Verne would give him three volumes of text per year, each of which Hetzel would buy outright for a flat fee. Verne, finding both a steady salary and a sure outlet for writing at last, accepted immediately. For the rest of his lifetime, most of his novels would be serialized in Hetzel&#x27;s &quot;Magasin&quot; before their appearance in book form, beginning with his second novel for Hetzel, &quot;The Adventures of Captain Hatteras&quot; (1864–65).
When &quot;The Adventures of Captain Hatteras&quot; was published in book form in 1866, Hetzel publicly announced his literary and educational ambitions for Verne&#x27;s novels by saying in a preface that Verne&#x27;s works would form a novel sequence called the &quot;Voyages extraordinaires&quot; (&quot;Extraordinary Voyages&quot; or &quot;Extraordinary Journeys&quot;), and that Verne&#x27;s aim was &quot;to outline all the geographical, geological, physical, and astronomical knowledge amassed by modern science and to recount, in an entertaining and picturesque format that is his own, the history of the universe&quot;. Late in life, Verne confirmed that this commission had become the running theme of his novels: &quot;My object has been to depict the earth, and not the earth alone, but the universe... And I have tried at the same time to realize a very high ideal of beauty of style. It is said that there can&#x27;t be any style in a novel of adventure, but it isn&#x27;t true.&quot; However, he also noted that the project was extremely ambitious: &quot;Yes! But the Earth is very large, and life is very short! In order to leave a completed work behind, one would need to live to be at least 100 years old!&quot;

Hetzel influenced many of Verne&#x27;s novels directly, especially in the first few years of their collaboration, for Verne was initially so happy to find a publisher that he agreed to almost all of the changes Hetzel suggested. For example, when Hetzel disapproved of the original climax of &quot;Captain Hatteras&quot;, including the death of the title character, Verne wrote an entirely new conclusion in which Hatteras survived. Hetzel also rejected Verne&#x27;s next submission, &quot;Paris in the Twentieth Century&quot;, believing its pessimistic view of the future and its condemnation of technological progress were too subversive for a family magazine. (The manuscript, believed lost for some time after Verne&#x27;s death, was finally published in 1994.)

The relationship between publisher and writer changed significantly around 1869 when Verne and Hetzel were brought into conflict over the manuscript for &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;. Verne had initially conceived of the submariner Captain Nemo as a Polish scientist whose acts of vengeance were directed against the Russians who had killed his family during the January Uprising. Hetzel, not wanting to alienate the lucrative Russian market for Verne&#x27;s books, demanded that Nemo be made an enemy of the slave trade, a situation that would make him an unambiguous hero. Verne, after fighting vehemently against the change, finally invented a compromise in which Nemo&#x27;s past is left mysterious. After this disagreement, Verne became notably cooler in his dealings with Hetzel, taking suggestions into consideration but often rejecting them outright.
From that point, Verne published two or more volumes a year. The most successful of these are: (&quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;, 1864); (&quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, 1865); &quot;Vingt mille lieues sous les mers&quot; (&quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;, 1869); and &quot;Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours&quot; (&quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;), which first appeared in &quot;Le Temps&quot; in 1872. Verne could now live on his writings, but most of his wealth came from the stage adaptations of &quot;Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours&quot; (1874) and &quot;Michel Strogoff&quot; (1876), which he wrote with Adolphe d&#x27;Ennery.
In 1867, Verne bought a small boat, the &quot;Saint-Michel&quot;, which he successively replaced with the &quot;Saint-Michel II&quot; and the &quot;Saint-Michel III&quot; as his financial situation improved. On board the &quot;Saint-Michel III&quot;, he sailed around Europe. After his first novel, most of his stories were first serialised in the &quot;Magazine d&#x27;Éducation et de Récréation&quot;, a Hetzel biweekly publication, before being published in book form. His brother Paul contributed to &quot;40th French climbing of the Mont-Blanc&quot; and a collection of short stories – &quot;Doctor Ox&quot; – in 1874. Verne became wealthy and famous.

Meanwhile, Michel Verne married an actress against his father&#x27;s wishes, had two children by an underage mistress and buried himself in debts. The relationship between father and son improved as Michel grew older.

===Later years===

Though raised as a Roman Catholic, Verne gravitated towards deism.
Some scholars believe his novels reflect a deist philosophy, as they often involve the notion of God or divine providence but rarely mention the concept of Christ.

On 9 March 1886, as Verne returned home, his twenty-six-year-old nephew, Gaston, shot at him twice with a pistol. The first bullet missed, but the second one entered Verne&#x27;s left leg, giving him a permanent limp that could not be overcome. This incident was not publicised in the media, but Gaston spent the rest of his life in a mental asylum.

After the deaths of both his mother and Hetzel (who died in 1886), Jules Verne began publishing darker works. In 1888 he entered politics and was elected town councillor of Amiens, where he championed several improvements and served for fifteen years.

Verne was made a knight of France&#x27;s Legion of Honour on 9 April 1870, and subsequently promoted in Legion of Honour rank to Officer on 19 July 1892.

===Death and posthumous publications===

On 24 March 1905, while ill with chronic diabetes and complications from a stroke which paralyzed his right side, Verne died at his home in Amiens, 44 Boulevard Longueville (now Boulevard Jules-Verne). His son, Michel Verne, oversaw the publication of the novels &quot;Invasion of the Sea&quot; and &quot;The Lighthouse at the End of the World&quot; after Jules&#x27;s death. The &quot;Voyages extraordinaires&quot; series continued for several years afterwards at the same rate of two volumes a year. It was later discovered that Michel Verne had made extensive changes in these stories, and the original versions were eventually published at the end of the 20th century by the Jules Verne Society (Société Jules Verne). In 1919, Michel Verne published &quot;The Barsac Mission&quot; (), whose original drafts contained references to Esperanto, a language that his father had been very interested in. In 1989, Verne&#x27;s great-grandson discovered his ancestor&#x27;s as-yet-unpublished novel &quot;Paris in the Twentieth Century&quot;, which was subsequently published in 1994.

==Works==

Verne&#x27;s largest body of work is the &quot;Voyages extraordinaires&quot; series, which includes all of his novels except for the two rejected manuscripts &quot;Paris in the Twentieth Century&quot; and &quot;Backwards to Britain&quot; (published posthumously in 1994 and 1989, respectively) and for projects left unfinished at his death (many of which would be posthumously adapted or rewritten for publication by his son Michel). Verne also wrote many plays, poems, song texts, operetta libretti, and short stories, as well as a variety of essays and miscellaneous non-fiction.
===Literary reception===
After his debut under Hetzel, Verne was enthusiastically received in France by writers and scientists alike, with George Sand and Théophile Gautier among his earliest admirers. Several notable contemporary figures, from the geographer Vivien de Saint-Martin to the critic Jules Claretie, spoke highly of Verne and his works in critical and biographical notes.

However, Verne&#x27;s growing popularity among readers and playgoers (due especially to the highly successful stage version of &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;) led to a gradual change in his literary reputation. As the novels and stage productions continued to sell, many contemporary critics felt that Verne&#x27;s status as a commercially popular author meant he could only be seen as a mere genre-based storyteller, rather than a serious author worthy of academic study.

This denial of formal literary status took various forms, including dismissive criticism by such writers as Émile Zola and the lack of Verne&#x27;s nomination for membership in the Académie Française, and was recognized by Verne himself, who said in a late interview: &quot;The great regret of my life is that I have never taken any place in French literature.&quot; To Verne, who considered himself &quot;a man of letters and an artist, living in the pursuit of the ideal&quot;, this critical dismissal on the basis of literary ideology could only be seen as the ultimate snub.

This bifurcation of Verne as a popular genre writer but a critical &quot;persona non grata&quot; continued after his death, with early biographies (including one by Verne&#x27;s own niece, Marguerite Allotte de la Fuÿe) focusing on error-filled and embroidered hagiography of Verne as a popular figure rather than on Verne&#x27;s actual working methods or his output. Meanwhile, sales of Verne&#x27;s novels in their original unabridged versions dropped markedly even in Verne&#x27;s home country, with abridged versions aimed directly at children taking their place.

However, the decades after Verne&#x27;s death also saw the rise in France of the &quot;Jules Verne cult&quot;, a steadily growing group of scholars and young writers who took Verne&#x27;s works seriously as literature and willingly noted his influence on their own pioneering works. Some of the cult founded the Société Jules Verne, the first academic society for Verne scholars; many others became highly respected &quot;avant garde&quot; and surrealist literary figures in their own right. Their praise and analyses, emphasizing Verne&#x27;s stylistic innovations and enduring literary themes, proved highly influential for literary studies to come.

In the 1960s and 1970s, thanks in large part to a sustained wave of serious literary study from well-known French scholars and writers, Verne&#x27;s reputation skyrocketed in France. Roland Barthes&#x27; seminal essay &quot;Nautilus et Bateau Ivre&quot; (&quot;The Nautilus and the Drunken Boat&quot;) was influential in its exegesis of the &quot;Voyages extraordinares&quot; as a purely literary text, while book-length studies by such figures as Marcel Moré and Jean Chesneaux considered Verne from a multitude of thematic vantage points.

French literary journals devoted entire issues to Verne and his work, with essays by such imposing literary figures as Michel Butor, Georges Borgeaud, Marcel Brion, Pierre Versins, Michel Foucault, René Barjavel, Marcel Lecomte, Francis Lacassin, and Michel Serres; meanwhile, Verne&#x27;s entire published opus returned to print, with unabridged and illustrated editions of his works printed by Livre de Poche and Éditions Rencontre. The wave reached its climax in Verne&#x27;s sesquicentennial year 1978, when he was made the subject of an academic colloquium at the Centre culturel international de Cerisy-la-Salle, and &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; was accepted for the French university system&#x27;s &quot;agrégation&quot; reading list. Since these events, Verne has been consistently recognized in Europe as a legitimate member of the French literary canon, with academic studies and new publications steadily continuing.

Verne&#x27;s reputation in English-speaking countries has been considerably slower in changing. Throughout the 20th century, most anglophone scholars dismissed Verne as a genre writer for children and a naïve proponent of science and technology (despite strong evidence to the contrary on both counts), thus finding him more interesting as a technological &quot;prophet&quot; or as a subject of comparison to English-language writers such as Edgar Allan Poe and H. G. Wells than as a topic of literary study in his own right. This narrow view of Verne has undoubtedly been influenced by the poor-quality English translations and very loosely adapted Hollywood film versions through which most American and British readers have discovered Verne. However, since the mid-1980s a considerable number of serious English-language studies and translations have appeared, suggesting that a rehabilitation of Verne&#x27;s anglophone reputation may currently be underway.

===English translations===

Translation of Verne into English began in 1852, when Verne&#x27;s short story &quot;A Voyage in a Balloon&quot; (1851) was published in the American journal &quot;Sartain&#x27;s Union Magazine of Literature and Art&quot; in a translation by Anne T. Wilbur. Translation of his novels began in 1869 with William Lackland&#x27;s translation of &quot;Five Weeks in a Balloon&quot; (originally published in 1863), and continued steadily throughout Verne&#x27;s lifetime, with publishers and hired translators often working in great haste to rush his most lucrative titles into English-language print. Unlike Hetzel, who targeted all ages with his publishing strategies for the &quot;Voyages extraordinaires&quot;, the British and American publishers of Verne chose to market his books almost exclusively to young audiences; this business move had a long-lasting effect on Verne&#x27;s reputation in English-speaking countries, implying that Verne could be treated purely as a children&#x27;s author.

These early English-language translations have been widely criticized for their extensive textual omissions, errors, and alterations, and are not considered adequate representations of Verne&#x27;s actual novels. In an essay for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, British writer Adam Roberts commented: I&#x27;d always liked reading Jules Verne and I&#x27;ve read most of his novels; but it wasn&#x27;t until recently that I really understood I hadn&#x27;t been reading Jules Verne at all ... It&#x27;s a bizarre situation for a world-famous writer to be in. Indeed, I can&#x27;t think of a major writer who has been so poorly served by translation.

Similarly, the American novelist Michael Crichton observed:

Since 1965, a considerable number of more accurate English translations of Verne have appeared. However, the older, deficient translations continue to be republished due to their public domain status, and in many cases their easy availability in online sources.

===Relationship with science fiction===

The relationship between Verne&#x27;s &quot;Voyages extraordinaires&quot; and the literary genre science fiction is a complex one. Verne, like H. G. Wells, is frequently cited as one of the founders of the genre, and his profound influence on its development is indisputable; however, many earlier writers, such as Lucian of Samosata, Voltaire, and Mary Shelley, have also been cited as creators of science fiction, an unavoidable ambiguity arising from the vague definition and history of the genre.

A primary issue at the heart of the dispute is the question of whether Verne&#x27;s works count as science fiction to begin with. Maurice Renard claimed that Verne &quot;never wrote a single sentence of scientific-marvelous&quot;. Verne himself argued repeatedly in interviews that his novels were not meant to be read as scientific, saying &quot;I have invented nothing&quot;. His own goal was rather to &quot;depict the earth [and] at the same time to realize a very high ideal of beauty of style&quot;, as he pointed out in an example:

Closely related to Verne&#x27;s science-fiction reputation is the often-repeated claim that he is a &quot;prophet&quot; of scientific progress, and that many of his novels involve elements of technology that were fantastic for his day but later became commonplace. These claims have a long history, especially in America, but the modern scholarly consensus is that such claims of prophecy are heavily exaggerated. In a 1961 article critical of &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;″ scientific accuracy, Theodore L. Thomas speculated that Verne&#x27;s storytelling skill and readers&#x27; faulty memories of a book they read as children caused people to &quot;remember things from it that are not there. The impression that the novel contains valid scientific prediction seems to grow as the years roll by&quot;. As with science fiction, Verne himself flatly denied that he was a futuristic prophet, saying that any connection between scientific developments and his work was &quot;mere coincidence&quot; and attributing his indisputable scientific accuracy to his extensive research: &quot;even before I began writing stories, I always took numerous notes out of every book, newspaper, magazine, or scientific report that I came across.&quot;

==Legacy==
Verne&#x27;s novels have had a wide influence on both literary and scientific works; writers known to have been influenced by Verne include Marcel Aymé, Roland Barthes, René Barjavel, Michel Butor, Blaise Cendrars, Paul Claudel, Jean Cocteau, Julio Cortázar, François Mauriac, Rick Riordan, Raymond Roussel, Claude Roy, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, and Jean-Paul Sartre, while scientists and explorers who acknowledged Verne&#x27;s inspiration have included Richard E. Byrd, Yuri Gagarin, Simon Lake, Hubert Lyautey, Guglielmo Marconi, Fridtjof Nansen, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Wernher von Braun, and Jack Parsons. Verne is credited with helping inspire the steampunk genre, a literary and social movement that glamorizes science fiction based on 19th-century technology.

Ray Bradbury summarized Verne&#x27;s influence on literature and science the world: &quot;We are all, in one way or another, the children of Jules Verne.&quot;

<doc id="15771" wikidata="Q2551" url="?curid=15771" title="Johannes Rau">
<text>Johannes Rau (; 16 January 193127 January 2006) was a German politician who served as President of Germany from 1999 to 2004. A member of the Social Democratic Party, he previously served as the Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia from 1978 to 1998. In the latter role, he also served as President of the Bundesrat in 1982/83 and in 1994/95.

==Education and work==

Rau was born in the Barmen part of Wuppertal, Rhine Province, as the third of five children. His family was strongly Protestant. As a schoolboy, Rau was active in the Confessing Church, which resisted Nazism.

Rau left school in 1949 and worked as a publisher, especially with the Protestant Youth Publishing House.

==Political career==
Rau was a member of the All-German People&#x27;s Party (GVP), which was founded by Gustav Heinemann. The party was known for proposing German reunification from 1952 until it was disbanded in 1957.

In 1958, the pacifist Rau and his political mentor, Gustav Heinemann, joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), where he was active in the Wuppertal chapter. He served as deputy chairman of the SPD party of Wuppertal and was elected later on to the City Council (1964–1978), where he served as chairman of the SPD Group (1964–1967) and later as Mayor (1969–1970).

In July 1958, Rau was elected for the first time as member of the Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia. In 1967, he became chairman of the SPD fraction in the Landtag, and from 1970 to 1975, he was Minister of Science and Education in the second cabinet of Minister President Heinz Kühn. He soon gained a reputation as a reformer. As part of the mass education campaign of the 1970s, he founded five universities, each at different sites, in North Rhine-Westphalia and initiated Germany&#x27;s first distance learning university at Hagen (modelled on the British &quot;Open University&quot;).

In 1977, Rau became Chairman of the SPD North Rhine-Westphalia and, in 1978, Minister President of the state, which he remained until 1998, with four successful elections for the SPD, which became strongest party in the Landtag each time and gained an absolute majority three times, in 1980, 1985, 1990 and finally 1995. 
From 1995 onwards, Rau led an SPD-Greens coalition in North Rhine-Westphalia. Rau twice served as President of the Bundesrat in 1982/83 and 1994/95.

In 1987, Rau was his party&#x27;s candidate to become chancellor of Germany for the SPD, but he lost the 1987 West German federal election against Helmut Kohl’s Christian Democrats (CDU). In 1994, Rau was a candidate to become President of Germany but lost the 1994 German presidential election to Roman Herzog.

In June 1998, Rau stepped down from his positions as SPD chairman and Minister President, and in the 1999 German presidential election on 23 May 1999, he was elected President of Germany by the Federal Assembly of Germany to succeed Roman Herzog (CDU). 
On 1 July 2004, he was succeeded by Horst Köhler. In common with all other Federal presidents Rau was honored by a Großer Zapfenstreich. At his request the hymn &quot;Jesus bleibet meine Freude&quot; (literally &quot;that Jesus remain my Joy&quot;, but commonly Jesu, Joy of Man&#x27;s Desiring) was included.

In February 2000, Rau became the first German head of state to address the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, in German. 
The controversial step prompted some Israeli delegates to walk out. However, Israeli President Moshe Katsav supported and praised him for bridging the gap between the two states. Rau had a deep and lifelong commitment to bringing reconciliation between Germany and its past.

==Death==

Rau had a long history of heart disease and died 11 days after his 75th birthday on 27 January 2006. The funeral took place on 7 February following a funeral act of state on the Dorotheenstadt cemetery in Berlin in the closest of family and friends.

==Motto and maxim==
The maxim of Rau was &quot;to reconcile, not divide&quot;.

As his personal motto, Rau adopted the Confessing Church dictum &quot;teneo, quia teneor&quot; (I hold because I am held).

In his acceptance speech after his election, Rau claimed &quot;I never want to be a nationalist but rather a patriot. A patriot is someone who loves his fatherland. A nationalist is someone who condemns the fatherland of others.&quot; The quote can be attributed to the French writer Romain Gary.

==Prizes and medals==
Rau was awarded 15 honorary doctorates. 
In 2001, he received the Leo Baeck Medal for his humanitarian work promoting tolerance and social justice.

==Private life==
Rau was known as a practising Christian (sometimes known as , &quot;Brother John&quot;, in ridicule of his intense Christian position. He held lay positions in and was a member of the Synod of the Evangelical Church in the Rhineland, a member church of the Protestant Church in Germany.

On 9 August 1982, Rau married the political scientist Christina Delius (born 1956). Christina Rau is a granddaughter of her husband&#x27;s mentor, Gustav Heinemann, former President of Germany. The couple had three children: Anna Christina, born 1983, Philip Immanuel, born 1985 and Laura Helene, born 1986.

On 18 August 2004, Rau had to undergo serious heart surgery, in which an artificial heart valve was inserted. Only two months later (19 October 2004), a hematoma in the abdominal cavity was surgically removed.

After leaving office, Rau lived with his family in the federal capital, Berlin. However, they also kept a house in Wuppertal.

<text>Jabal Ram is a mountain in Jordan. Most authorities give its elevation as above sea level. It was once thought to be the highest point in Jordan, but SRTM data shows that Jabal Umm al Dami is above sea level and therefore higher.

Traditional climbing routes over its eastern face make it one of the main attractions for climbers.

There are about ten scrambling routes across the mountain.

Tony Howard wrote a valuable book about Jordan, including Wadi Rum and Jabal Rum: Treks and Climbs in Wadi Rum, Jordan.

The most popular scrambling routes are the Thamudic and Sheikh Hamdans.

<text>Paul Joseph Goebbels (; 29 October 1897 – 1 May 1945) was a German Nazi politician and philologist who was the &quot;Gauleiter&quot; (district leader) of Berlin, chief propagandist for the Nazi Party, and then Reich Minister of Propaganda from 1933 to 1945. He was one of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s closest and most devoted followers, known for his skills in public speaking and his deeply virulent antisemitism which was evident in his publicly voiced views. He advocated progressively harsher discrimination, including the extermination of the Jews in the Holocaust.

Goebbels, who aspired to be an author, obtained a doctorate in philology from the University of Heidelberg in 1921. He joined the Nazi Party in 1924, and worked with Gregor Strasser in its northern branch. He was appointed &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Berlin in 1926, where he began to take an interest in the use of propaganda to promote the party and its programme. After the Nazis came to power in 1933, Goebbels&#x27;s Propaganda Ministry quickly gained control over the news media, arts and information in Nazi Germany. He was particularly adept at using the relatively new media of radio and film for propaganda purposes. Topics for party propaganda included antisemitism, attacks on Christian churches, and (after the start of the Second World War) attempts to shape morale.

In 1943, Goebbels began to pressure Hitler to introduce measures that would produce &quot;total war&quot;, including closing businesses not essential to the war effort, conscripting women into the labour force, and enlisting men in previously exempt occupations into the Wehrmacht. Hitler finally appointed him as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War on 23 July 1944, whereby Goebbels undertook largely unsuccessful measures to increase the number of people available for armaments manufacture and the Wehrmacht.

As the war drew to a close and Nazi Germany faced defeat, Magda Goebbels and the Goebbels children joined Hitler in Berlin. They moved into the underground &quot;Vorbunker&quot;, part of Hitler&#x27;s underground bunker complex, on 22 April 1945. Hitler committed suicide on 30 April. In accordance with Hitler&#x27;s will, Goebbels succeeded him as Chancellor of Germany; he served one day in this post. The following day, Goebbels and his wife Magda committed suicide, after having poisoned their six children with a cyanide compound.

==Early life, education, and relationships==
Paul Joseph Goebbels was born on 29 October 1897 in Rheydt, an industrial town south of Mönchengladbach near Düsseldorf, Germany. Both of his parents were Roman Catholics with modest family backgrounds. His father, Fritz, was a German factory clerk; his mother, Katharina Maria (&quot;née&quot; Odenhausen), was born to Dutch and German parents in a Dutch village close to the border with Germany. Goebbels had five siblings: Konrad (1893–1949), Hans (1895–1947), Maria (1896–1896), Elisabeth (1901–1915) and Maria (1910–1949), who married the German filmmaker Max W. Kimmich in 1938. In 1932 Goebbels commissioned the publication of a pamphlet of his family tree to refute the rumours that his maternal grandmother was of Jewish ancestry.

During childhood Goebbels experienced ill health, which included a long bout of inflammation of the lungs. He had a deformed right foot, which turned inwards and was due to a congenital disorder. It was thicker and shorter than his left foot. Just prior to starting grammar school he underwent an operation, which failed to correct the problem. Goebbels wore a metal brace and a special shoe because of his shortened leg and walked with a limp. He was rejected for military service in World War I because of this deformity.
Goebbels was educated at a &quot;Gymnasium&quot;, where he completed his &quot;Abitur&quot; (university entrance examination) in 1917. He was the top student of his class and was given the traditional honour of speaking at the awards ceremony. His parents initially hoped that he would become a Catholic priest, which Goebbels seriously considered. He studied literature and history at the universities of Bonn, Würzburg, Freiburg and Munich, aided by a scholarship from the Albertus Magnus Society. By this time Goebbels had begun to distance himself from the church.

Historians, including Richard J. Evans and Roger Manvell, speculate that Goebbels&#x27; lifelong pursuit of women may have been in compensation for his physical disability. At Freiburg he met and fell in love with Anka Stalherm, who was three years his senior. She went on to Würzburg to continue studying, as did Goebbels. By 1920 the relationship with Anka was over; the break-up filled Goebbels with thoughts of suicide. In 1921 he wrote a semi-autobiographical novel, &quot;Michael&quot;, a three-part work of which only Parts I and III have survived. Goebbels felt he was writing his &quot;own story&quot;. Antisemitic content and material about a charismatic leader may have been added by Goebbels shortly before the book was published in 1929 by Eher-Verlag, the publishing house of the Nazi Party (National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party; NSDAP).

At the University of Heidelberg Goebbels wrote his doctoral thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz, a minor 19th-century romantic dramatist. He had hoped to write his thesis under the supervision of Friedrich Gundolf, a literary historian. It did not seem to bother Goebbels that Gundolf was Jewish. As he was no longer teaching, Gundolf directed Goebbels to associate professor Max Freiherr von Waldberg. Waldberg, who was also Jewish, recommended Goebbels write his thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz. After submitting the thesis and passing his oral examination, Goebbels received his PhD on 21 April 1922. By 1940 he had written 14 books.

Goebbels returned home and worked as a private tutor. He also found work as a journalist and was published in the local newspaper. His writing during that time reflected his growing antisemitism and dislike for modern culture. In the summer of 1922 he met and began a love affair with Else Janke, a schoolteacher. After she revealed to him that she was half-Jewish, Goebbels stated the &quot;enchantment [was] ruined.&quot; Nevertheless he continued to see her on and off until 1927.

He continued for several years to try to become a published author. His diaries, which he began in 1923 and continued for the rest of his life, provided an outlet for his desire to write. The lack of income from his literary works – he wrote two plays in 1923, neither of which sold – forced him to take employment as a caller on the stock exchange and as a bank clerk in Cologne, a job he detested. He was dismissed from the bank in August 1923 and returned to Rheydt. During this period he read avidly and was influenced by the works of Oswald Spengler, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, the British-born German writer whose book &quot;The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century&quot; (1899) was one of the standard works of the extreme right in Germany. He also began to study the social question and read the works of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Rosa Luxemburg, August Bebel and Gustav Noske. According to German historian Peter Longerich, Goebbels&#x27;s diary entries from late 1923 to early 1924 reflected the writings of a man who was isolated, preoccupied with &quot;religious-philosophical&quot; issues and lacked a sense of direction. Diary entries from mid-December 1923 onwards show Goebbels was moving towards the &quot;Völkisch&quot; nationalist movement.

==Nazi activist==
Goebbels first took an interest in Adolf Hitler and Nazism in 1924. In February 1924, Hitler&#x27;s trial for treason began in the wake of his failed attempt to seize power in the Beer Hall Putsch of 8–9 November 1923. The trial attracted widespread press coverage and gave Hitler a platform for propaganda. Hitler was sentenced to five years in prison, but was released on 20 December 1924, after serving just over a year, including pre-trial detention. Goebbels was drawn to the Nazi Party mostly because of Hitler&#x27;s charisma and commitment to his beliefs. He joined the Nazi Party around this time, becoming member number 8762. In late 1924, Goebbels offered his services to Karl Kaufmann, who was &quot;Gauleiter&quot; (Nazi Party district leader) for the Rhine-Ruhr District. Kaufmann put him in touch with Gregor Strasser, a leading Nazi organiser in northern Germany, who hired him to work on their weekly newspaper and undertake secretarial work for the regional party offices. He was also put to work as party speaker and representative for Rhineland-Westphalia. Strasser founded the National Socialist Working Association on 10 September 1925, a short-lived group of about a dozen northern and western German &quot;Gauleiter&quot;; Goebbels became its business manager and the editor of its biweekly journal, &quot;NS-Briefe&quot;. Members of Strasser&#x27;s northern branch of the Nazi Party, including Goebbels, had a more socialist outlook than the rival Hitler group in Munich. Strasser disagreed with Hitler on many parts of the party platform, and in November 1926 began working on a revision.

Hitler viewed Strasser&#x27;s actions as a threat to his authority, and summoned 60 &quot;Gauleiters&quot; and party leaders, including Goebbels, to a special conference in Bamberg, in Streicher&#x27;s &quot;Gau&quot; of Franconia, where he gave a two-hour speech repudiating Strasser&#x27;s new political programme. Hitler was opposed to the socialist leanings of the northern wing, stating it would mean &quot;political bolshevization of Germany.&quot; Further, there would be &quot;no princes, only Germans,&quot; and a legal system with no &quot;Jewish system of exploitation ... for plundering of our people.&quot; The future would be secured by acquiring land, not through expropriation of the estates of the former nobility, but through colonising territories to the east. Goebbels was horrified by Hitler&#x27;s characterisation of socialism as &quot;a Jewish creation&quot; and his assertion that a Nazi government would not expropriate private property. He wrote in his diary: &quot;I no longer fully believe in Hitler. That&#x27;s the terrible thing: my inner support has been taken away.&quot;

After reading Hitler&#x27;s book &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, Goebbels found himself agreeing with Hitler&#x27;s assertion of a &quot;Jewish doctrine of Marxism&quot;. In February 1926, Goebbels gave a speech titled &quot;Bolshevism or National-socialism? Lenin or Hitler?&quot; in which he asserted that communism or Marxism could not save the German people, but he believed it would cause a &quot;socialist nationalist state&quot; to arise in Russia. In 1926, Goebbels published a pamphlet titled &quot;Nazi-Sozi&quot; which attempted to explain how National Socialism differed from Marxism.

In hopes of winning over the opposition, Hitler arranged meetings in Munich with the three Greater Ruhr &quot;Gau&quot; leaders, including Goebbels. Goebbels was impressed when Hitler sent his own car to meet them at the railway station. That evening, Hitler and Goebbels both gave speeches at a beer hall rally. The following day, Hitler offered his hand in reconciliation to the three men, encouraging them to put their differences behind them. Goebbels capitulated completely, offering Hitler his total loyalty. He wrote in his diary: &quot;I love him ... He has thought through everything,&quot; &quot;Such a sparkling mind can be my leader. I bow to the greater one, the political genius.&quot; He later wrote: &quot;Adolf Hitler, I love you because you are both great and simple at the same time. What one calls a genius.&quot; As a result of the Bamberg and Munich meetings, the National Socialist Working Association was disbanded. Strasser&#x27;s new draft of the party programme was discarded, the original National Socialist Program of 1920 was retained unchanged, and Hitler&#x27;s position as party leader was greatly strengthened.

==Propagandist in Berlin==
At Hitler&#x27;s invitation, Goebbels spoke at party meetings in Munich and at the annual Party Congress, held in Weimar in 1926. For the following year&#x27;s event, Goebbels was involved in the planning for the first time. He and Hitler arranged for the rally to be filmed. Receiving praise for doing well at these events led Goebbels to shape his political ideas to match Hitler&#x27;s, and to admire and idolise him even more.

===Gauleiter===
Goebbels was first offered the position of party &quot;Gauleiter&quot; for the Berlin section in August 1926. He travelled to Berlin in mid-September and by the middle of October accepted the position. Thus Hitler&#x27;s plan to divide and dissolve the northwestern &quot;Gauleiters&quot; group that Goebbels had served in under Strasser was successful. Hitler gave Goebbels great authority over the area, allowing him to determine the course for organisation and leadership for the &quot;Gau&quot;. Goebbels was given control over the local &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) and &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) and answered only to Hitler. The party membership numbered about 1,000 when Goebbels arrived, and he reduced it to a core of 600 of the most active and promising members. To raise money, he instituted membership fees and began charging admission to party meetings. Aware of the value of publicity (both positive and negative), he deliberately provoked beer-hall battles and street brawls, including violent attacks on the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). Goebbels adapted recent developments in commercial advertising to the political sphere, including the use of catchy slogans and subliminal cues. His new ideas for poster design included using large type, red ink, and cryptic headers that encouraged the reader to examine the fine print to determine the meaning.

Like Hitler, Goebbels practised his public speaking skills in front of a mirror. Meetings were preceded by ceremonial marches and singing, and the venues were decorated with party banners. His entrance (almost always late) was timed for maximum emotional impact. Goebbels usually meticulously planned his speeches ahead of time, using pre-planned and choreographed inflection and gestures, but he was also able to improvise and adapt his presentation to make a good connection with his audience. He used loudspeakers, decorative flames, uniforms, and marches to attract attention to speeches.

Goebbels&#x27; tactic of using provocation to bring attention to the Nazi Party, along with violence at the public party meetings and demonstrations, led the Berlin police to ban the Nazi Party from the city on 5 May 1927. Violent incidents continued, including young Nazis randomly attacking Jews in the streets. Goebbels was subjected to a public speaking ban until the end of October. During this period, he founded the newspaper &quot;Der Angriff&quot; (&quot;The Attack&quot;) as a propaganda vehicle for the Berlin area, where few supported the party. It was a modern-style newspaper with an aggressive tone; 126 libel suits were pending against Goebbels at one point. To his disappointment, circulation was initially only 2,000. Material in the paper was highly anti-communist and antisemitic. Among the paper&#x27;s favourite targets was the Jewish Deputy Chief of the Berlin Police Bernhard Weiß. Goebbels gave him the derogatory nickname &quot;Isidore&quot; and subjected him to a relentless campaign of Jew-baiting in the hope of provoking a crackdown he could then exploit. Goebbels continued to try to break into the literary world, with a revised version of his book &quot;Michael&quot; finally being published, and the unsuccessful production of two of his plays (&quot;Der Wanderer&quot; and &quot;Die Saat&quot; (&quot;The Seed&quot;)). The latter was his final attempt at playwriting. During this period in Berlin he had relationships with many women, including his old flame Anka Stalherm, who was now married and had a small child. He was quick to fall in love, but easily tired of a relationship and moved on to someone new. He worried too about how a committed personal relationship might interfere with his career.

===1928 election===
The ban on the Nazi Party was lifted before the &quot;Reichstag&quot; elections on 20 May 1928. The Nazi Party lost nearly 100,000 voters and earned only 2.6 per cent of the vote nationwide. Results in Berlin were even worse, where they attained only 1.4 per cent of the vote. Goebbels was one of the first 12 Nazi Party members to gain election to the &quot;Reichstag&quot;. This gave him immunity from prosecution for a long list of outstanding charges, including a three-week jail sentence he received in April for insulting the deputy police chief Weiß. The Reichstag changed the immunity regulations in February 1931, and Goebbels was forced to pay fines for libellous material he had placed in &quot;Der Angriff&quot; over the course of the previous year. Goebbels continued to be elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; at every subsequent election during the Weimar and Nazi regimes.

In his newspaper &quot;Berliner Arbeiterzeitung&quot; (&quot;Berlin Workers Newspaper&quot;), Gregor Strasser was highly critical of Goebbels&#x27; failure to attract the urban vote. However, the party as a whole did much better in rural areas, attracting as much as 18 per cent of the vote in some regions. This was partly because Hitler had publicly stated just prior to the election that Point 17 of the party programme, which mandated the expropriation of land without compensation, would apply only to Jewish speculators and not private landholders. After the election, the party refocused their efforts to try to attract still more votes in the agricultural sector. In May, shortly after the election, Hitler considered appointing Goebbels as party propaganda chief. But he hesitated, as he worried that the removal of Gregor Strasser from the post would lead to a split in the party. Goebbels considered himself well suited to the position, and began to formulate ideas about how propaganda could be used in schools and the media.

By 1930 Berlin was the party&#x27;s second-strongest base of support after Munich. That year the violence between the Nazis and communists led to local SA troop leader Horst Wessel being shot by two members of the KPD. He later died in hospital. Exploiting Wessel&#x27;s death, Goebbels turned him into a martyr for the Nazi movement. He officially declared Wessel&#x27;s march &quot;Die Fahne hoch&quot; (&quot;Raise the flag&quot;), renamed as the &quot;Horst-Wessel-Lied&quot;, to be the Nazi Party anthem.

===Great Depression===
The Great Depression greatly impacted Germany and by 1930 there was a dramatic increase in unemployment. During this time, the Strasser brothers started publishing a new daily newspaper in Berlin, the &quot;Nationaler Sozialist&quot;. Like their other publications, it conveyed the brothers&#x27; own brand of Nazism, including nationalism, anti-capitalism, social reform, and anti-Westernism. Goebbels complained vehemently about the rival Strasser newspapers to Hitler and admitted that their success was causing his own Berlin newspapers to be &quot;pushed to the wall&quot;. In late April 1930, Hitler publicly and firmly announced his opposition to Gregor Strasser and appointed Goebbels to replace him as Reich leader of Nazi Party propaganda. One of Goebbels&#x27; first acts was to ban the evening edition of the &quot;Nationaler Sozialist&quot;. Goebbels was also given control of other Nazi papers across the country, including the party&#x27;s national newspaper, the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Observer&quot;). He still had to wait until 3 July for Otto Strasser and his supporters to announce they were leaving the Nazi Party. Upon receiving the news, Goebbels was relieved the &quot;crisis&quot; with the Strassers was finally over and glad that Otto Strasser had lost all power.

The rapid deterioration of the economy led to the resignation on 27 March 1930 of the coalition government that had been elected in 1928. Paul von Hindenburg appointed Heinrich Brüning as chancellor. A new cabinet was formed, and Hindenburg used his power as president to govern via emergency decrees. Goebbels took charge of the Nazi Party&#x27;s national campaign for Reichstag elections called for 14 September 1930. Campaigning was undertaken on a huge scale, with thousands of meetings and speeches held all over the country. Hitler&#x27;s speeches focused on blaming the country&#x27;s economic woes on the Weimar Republic, particularly its adherence to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which required war reparations that had proven devastating to the German economy. He proposed a new German society based on race and national unity. The resulting success took even Hitler and Goebbels by surprise: the party received 6.5 million votes nationwide and took 107 seats in the Reichstag, making it the second-largest party in the country. 

In late 1930 Goebbels met Magda Quandt, a divorcée who had joined the party a few months earlier. She worked as a volunteer in the party offices in Berlin, helping Goebbels organise his private papers. Her flat on &quot;Reichskanzlerplatz&quot; soon became a favourite meeting place for Hitler and other Nazi Party officials. Goebbels and Quandt married on 19 December 1931 at a Protestant church. Hitler was his best man.

For two further elections held in 1932, Goebbels organised massive campaigns that included rallies, parades, speeches, and Hitler travelling around the country by aeroplane with the slogan &quot;the Führer over Germany&quot;. Goebbels wrote in his diary that the Nazis must gain power and exterminate Marxism. He undertook numerous speaking tours during these election campaigns and had some of their speeches published on gramophone records and as pamphlets. Goebbels was also involved in the production of a small collection of silent films that could be shown at party meetings, though they did not yet have enough equipment to widely use this medium. Many of Goebbels&#x27; campaign posters used violent imagery such as a giant half-clad male destroying political opponents or other perceived enemies such as &quot;International High Finance&quot;. His propaganda characterised the opposition as &quot;November criminals&quot;, &quot;Jewish wire-pullers&quot;, or a communist threat.

==Role in Hitler&#x27;s government==
Support for the party continued to grow, but neither of these elections led to a majority government. In an effort to stabilise the country and improve economic conditions, Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Reich chancellor on 30 January 1933.

To celebrate Hitler&#x27;s appointment as chancellor, Goebbels organised a torchlight parade in Berlin on the night of 30 January of an estimated 60,000 men, many in the uniforms of the SA and SS. The spectacle was covered by a live state radio broadcast, with commentary by longtime party member and future Minister of Aviation Hermann Göring. Goebbels was disappointed not to be given a post in Hitler&#x27;s new cabinet. Bernhard Rust was appointed as Minister of Culture, the post that Goebbels was expecting to receive. Like other Nazi Party officials, Goebbels had to deal with Hitler&#x27;s leadership style of giving contradictory orders to his subordinates, while placing them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped. In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. The Nazi Party took advantage of the Reichstag fire of 27 February 1933, with Hindenburg passing the Reichstag Fire Decree the following day at Hitler&#x27;s urging. This was the first of several pieces of legislation that dismantled democracy in Germany and put a totalitarian dictatorship—headed by Hitler—in its place. On 5 March, yet another Reichstag election took place, the last to be held before the defeat of the Nazis at the end of the Second World War. While the Nazi Party increased their number of seats and percentage of the vote, it was not the landslide expected by the party leadership. Goebbels finally received Hitler&#x27;s appointment to the cabinet, officially becoming head of the newly created Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda on 14 March.

The role of the new ministry, which set up its offices in the 18th-century Ordenspalais across from the Reich Chancellery, was to centralise Nazi control of all aspects of German cultural and intellectual life. Goebbels hoped to increase popular support of the party from the 37 per cent achieved at the last free election held in Germany on 25 March 1933 to 100 per cent support. An unstated goal was to present to other nations the impression that the Nazi Party had the full and enthusiastic backing of the entire population. One of Goebbels&#x27; first productions was staging the Day of Potsdam, a ceremonial passing of power from Hindenburg to Hitler, held in Potsdam on 21 March. He composed the text of Hitler&#x27;s decree authorising the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses, held on 1 April. Later that month, Goebbels travelled back to Rheydt, where he was given a triumphal reception. The townsfolk lined the main street, which had been renamed in his honour. On the following day, Goebbels was declared a local hero.

Goebbels converted the 1 May holiday from a celebration of workers&#x27; rights (observed as such especially by the communists) into a day celebrating the Nazi Party. In place of the usual ad hoc labour celebrations, he organised a huge party rally held at Tempelhof Field in Berlin. The following day, all trade union offices in the country were forcibly disbanded by the SA and SS, and the Nazi-run German Labour Front was created to take their place. &quot;We are the masters of Germany,&quot; he commented in his diary entry of 3 May. Less than two weeks later, he gave a speech at the Nazi book burning in Berlin on 10 May, a ceremony he suggested.

Meanwhile, the Nazi Party began passing laws to marginalise Jews and remove them from German society. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, passed on 7 April 1933, forced all non-Aryans to retire from the legal profession and civil service. Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions of their right to practise. The first Nazi concentration camps (initially created to house political dissenters) were founded shortly after Hitler seized power. In a process termed &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; (coordination), the Nazi Party proceeded to rapidly bring all aspects of life under control of the party. All civilian organisations, including agricultural groups, volunteer organisations, and sports clubs, had their leadership replaced with Nazi sympathisers or party members. By June 1933, virtually the only organisations not in the control of the Nazi Party were the army and the churches. On 2 June 1933, Hitler appointed Goebbels a &quot;Reichsleiter&quot;, the second highest political rank in the Nazi Party. On 3 October 1933, on the formation of the Academy for German Law, Goebbels was made a member and given a seat on its executive committee. 

In a move to manipulate Germany&#x27;s middle class and shape popular opinion, the regime passed on 4 October 1933 the &quot;Schriftleitergesetz&quot; (Editor&#x27;s Law), which became the cornerstone of the Nazi Party&#x27;s control of the popular press. Modelled to some extent on the system in Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist Italy, the law defined a &quot;Schriftleiter&quot; as anyone who wrote, edited, or selected texts and/or illustrated material for serial publication. Individuals selected for this position were chosen based on experiential, educational, and racial criteria. The law required journalists to &quot;regulate their work in accordance with National Socialism as a philosophy of life and as a conception of government.&quot;

In 1934, Goebbels published &quot;Vom Kaiserhof zur Reichskanzlei&quot; (&quot;From the Kaiserhof to the Reich Chancellery&quot;), his account of Hitler&#x27;s seizure of power, which he based on his diary from 1 January 1932 to 1 May 1933. The book sought to glorify both Hitler and the author. It sold around 660,000 copies, making it Goebbels&#x27;s best-selling publication during his lifetime.

At the end of June 1934, top officials of the SA and opponents of the regime, including Gregor Strasser, were arrested and killed in a purge later called the Night of Long Knives. Goebbels was present at the arrest of SA leader Ernst Röhm in Munich. On 2 August 1934, President von Hindenburg died. In a radio broadcast, Goebbels announced that the offices of president and chancellor had been combined, and Hitler had been formally named as &quot;Führer und Reichskanzler&quot; (leader and chancellor).

===Workings of the Ministry===
The propaganda ministry was organised into seven departments: administration and legal; mass rallies, public health, youth, and race; radio; national and foreign press; films and film censorship; art, music, and theatre; and protection against counter-propaganda, both foreign and domestic. Goebbels&#x27;s style of leadership was tempestuous and unpredictable. He would suddenly change direction and shift his support between senior associates; he was a difficult boss and liked to berate his staff in public. Goebbels was successful at his job, however; &quot;Life&quot; wrote in 1938 that &quot;[p]ersonally he likes nobody, is liked by nobody, and runs the most efficient Nazi department.&quot; John Gunther wrote in 1940 that Goebbels &quot;is the cleverest of all the Nazis&quot;, but could not succeed Hitler because &quot;everybody hates him&quot;.

The Reich Film Chamber, which all members of the film industry were required to join, was created in June 1933. Goebbels promoted the development of films with a Nazi slant, and ones that contained subliminal or overt propaganda messages. Under the auspices of the &quot;Reichskulturkammer&quot; (Reich Chamber of Culture), created in September, Goebbels added additional sub-chambers for the fields of broadcasting, fine arts, literature, music, the press, and the theatre. As in the film industry, anyone wishing to pursue a career in these fields had to be a member of the corresponding chamber. In this way anyone whose views were contrary to the regime could be excluded from working in their chosen field and thus silenced. In addition, journalists (now considered employees of the state) were required to prove Aryan descent back to the year 1800, and if married, the same requirement applied to the spouse. Members of any chamber were not allowed to leave the country for their work without prior permission of their chamber. A committee was established to censor books, and works could not be re-published unless they were on the list of approved works. Similar regulations applied to other fine arts and entertainment; even cabaret performances were censored. Many German artists and intellectuals left Germany in the pre-war years rather than work under these restrictions.
Goebbels was particularly interested in controlling the radio, which was then still a fairly new mass medium. Sometimes under protest from individual states (particularly Prussia, headed by Göring), Goebbels gained control of radio stations nationwide, and placed them under the &quot;Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft&quot; (German National Broadcasting Corporation) in July 1934. Manufacturers were urged by Goebbels to produce inexpensive home receivers, called &quot;Volksempfänger&quot; (people&#x27;s receiver), and by 1938 nearly ten million sets had been sold. Loudspeakers were placed in public areas, factories, and schools, so that important party broadcasts would be heard live by nearly all Germans. On 2 September 1939 (the day after the start of the war), Goebbels and the Council of Ministers proclaimed it illegal to listen to foreign radio stations. Disseminating news from foreign broadcasts could result in the death penalty. Albert Speer, Hitler&#x27;s architect and later Minister for Armaments and War Production, later said the regime &quot;made the complete use of all technical means for domination of its own country. Through technical devices like the radio and loudspeaker, 80 million people were deprived of independent thought.&quot;
A major focus of Nazi propaganda was Hitler himself, who was glorified as a heroic and infallible leader and became the focus of a cult of personality. Much of this was spontaneous, but some was stage-managed as part of Goebbels&#x27; propaganda work. Adulation of Hitler was the focus of the 1934 Nuremberg Rally, where his moves were carefully choreographed. The rally was the subject of the film &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;, one of several Nazi propaganda films directed by Leni Riefenstahl. It won the gold medal at the 1935 Venice Film Festival. At the 1935 Nazi party congress rally at Nuremberg, Goebbels declared that &quot;Bolshevism is the declaration of war by Jewish-led international subhumans against culture itself.&quot;

Goebbels was involved in planning the staging of the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Berlin. It was around this time that he met and started having an affair with the actress Lída Baarová, whom he continued to see until 1938. A major project in 1937 was the Degenerate Art Exhibition, organised by Goebbels, which ran in Munich from July to November. The exhibition proved wildly popular, attracting over two million visitors. A degenerate music exhibition took place the following year. Meanwhile, Goebbels was disappointed by the lack of quality in the National Socialist artwork, films, and literature.

===Church struggle===

In 1933, Hitler signed the &quot;Reichskonkordat&quot; (Reich Concordat), a treaty with the Vatican that required the regime to honour the independence of Catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics. However, the regime continued to target the Christian churches to weaken their influence. Throughout 1935 and 1936, hundreds of clergy and nuns were arrested, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or sexual offences. Goebbels widely publicised the trials in his propaganda campaigns, showing the cases in the worst possible light. Restrictions were placed on public meetings, and Catholic publications faced censorship. Catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings. Hitler often vacillated on whether or not the &quot;Kirchenkampf&quot; (church struggle) should be a priority, but his frequent inflammatory comments on the issue were enough to convince Goebbels to intensify his work on the issue; in February 1937 he stated he wanted to eliminate the Protestant church.

In response to the persecution, Pope Pius XI had the &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot; (&quot;With Burning Concern&quot;) Encyclical smuggled into Germany for Passion Sunday 1937 and read from every pulpit. It denounced the systematic hostility of the regime toward the church. In response, Goebbels renewed the regime&#x27;s crackdown and propaganda against Catholics. His speech of 28 May in Berlin in front of 20,000 party members, which was also broadcast on the radio, attacked the Catholic church as morally corrupt. As a result of the propaganda campaign, enrolment in denominational schools dropped sharply, and by 1939 all such schools were disbanded or converted to public facilities. Harassment and threats of imprisonment led the clergy to be much more cautious in their criticism of the regime. Partly out of foreign policy concerns, Hitler ordered a scaling back of the church struggle by the end of July 1937.

===Antisemitism and the Holocaust===

Goebbels was antisemitic from a young age. After joining the Nazi Party and meeting Hitler, his antisemitism grew and became more radical. He began to see the Jews as a destructive force with a negative impact on German society. In 1930, he criticised Italian Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini for his relative lack of hostility towards Jews, stating that &quot;Mussolini appears to have not recognized the Jewish question.&quot; After the Nazis seized control, he repeatedly urged Hitler to take action against the Jews. Despite his extreme antisemitism, Goebbels spoke of the &quot;rubbish of race-materialism&quot; and of the unnecessity of biological racism for the Nazi ideology. He also described Himmler&#x27;s ideology as &quot;in many regards, mad&quot; and thought Alfred Rosenberg&#x27;s racial theories were ridiculous.

The Nazi Party&#x27;s goal was to remove Jews from German cultural and economic life, and eventually to remove them from the country altogether. In addition to his propaganda efforts, Goebbels actively promoted the persecution of the Jews through pogroms, legislation, and other actions. Discriminatory measures he instituted in Berlin in the early years of the regime included bans against their using public transport and requiring that Jewish shops be marked as such.

In November 1938, the German diplomat Ernst vom Rath was killed in Paris by the young Jewish man Herschel Grynszpan. In response, Goebbels arranged for inflammatory antisemitic material to be released by the press, and the result was the start of a pogrom. Jews were attacked and synagogues destroyed all over Germany. The situation was further inflamed by a speech Goebbels gave at a party meeting on the night of 8 November, where he obliquely called for party members to incite further violence against Jews while making it appear to be a spontaneous series of acts by the German people. At least a hundred Jews were killed, several hundred synagogues were damaged or destroyed, and thousands of Jewish shops were vandalised in an event called &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; (Night of Broken Glass). Around 30,000 Jewish men were sent to concentration camps. The destruction stopped after a conference held on 12 November, where Göring pointed out that the destruction of Jewish property was in effect the destruction of German property since the intention was that it would all eventually be confiscated.

Goebbels continued his intensive antisemitic propaganda campaign that culminated in Hitler&#x27;s 30 January 1939 Reichstag speech, which Goebbels helped to write:


While Goebbels had been pressing for expulsion of the Berlin Jews since 1935, there were still 62,000 living in the city in 1940. Part of the delay in their deportation was that they were needed as workers in the armaments industry. Deportations of German Jews began in October 1941, with the first transport from Berlin leaving on 18 October. Some Jews were shot immediately on arrival in destinations such as Riga and Kaunas. In preparation for the deportations, Goebbels ordered that all German Jews wear an identifying yellow badge as of 5 September 1941. On 6 March 1942, Goebbels received a copy of the minutes of the Wannsee Conference, which indicated indirectly that the Jewish population of Europe was to be sent to extermination camps in occupied areas of Poland and killed. His diary entries of the period show that he was well aware of the fate of the Jews. &quot;In general, it can probably be established that 60 per cent of them will have to be liquidated, while only 40 per cent can be put to work. ... A judgment is being carried out on the Jews which is barbaric but thoroughly deserved,&quot; he wrote on 27 March 1942.

Goebbels had frequent discussions with Hitler about the fate of the Jews, a subject they discussed almost every time they met. He was aware throughout that the Jews were being exterminated, and completely supported this decision. He was one of the few top Nazi officials to do so publicly.

==World War II==
As early as February 1933, Hitler announced that rearmament must be undertaken, albeit clandestinely at first, as to do so was in violation of the Versailles Treaty. A year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was the target date for going to war in the east. Goebbels was one of the most enthusiastic supporters of Hitler aggressively pursuing Germany&#x27;s expansionist policies sooner rather than later. At the time of the Reoccupation of the Rhineland in 1936, Goebbels summed up his general attitude in his diary: &quot;[N]ow is the time for action. Fortune favors the brave! He who dares nothing wins nothing.&quot; In the lead-up to the Sudetenland crisis in 1938, Goebbels took the initiative time and again to use propaganda to whip up sympathy for the Sudeten Germans while campaigning against the Czech government. Still, Goebbels was well aware there was a growing &quot;war panic&quot; in Germany and so by July had the press conduct propaganda efforts at a lower level of intensity. After the Western powers acceded to Hitler&#x27;s demands concerning Czechoslovakia in 1938, Goebbels soon redirected his propaganda machine against Poland. From May onwards, he orchestrated a campaign against Poland, fabricating stories about atrocities against ethnic Germans in Danzig and other cities. Even so, he was unable to persuade the majority of Germans to welcome the prospect of war. He privately held doubts about the wisdom of risking a protracted war against Britain and France by attacking Poland.

After the Invasion of Poland in September 1939, Goebbels used his propaganda ministry and the Reich chambers to control access to information domestically. To his chagrin, his rival Joachim von Ribbentrop, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, continually challenged Goebbels&#x27; jurisdiction over the dissemination of international propaganda. Hitler declined to make a firm ruling on the subject, so the two men remained rivals for the remainder of the Nazi era. Goebbels did not participate in the military decision-making process, nor was he made privy to diplomatic negotiations until after the fact.

The Propaganda Ministry took over the broadcasting facilities of conquered countries immediately after surrender, and began broadcasting prepared material using the existing announcers as a way to gain the trust of the citizens. Most aspects of the media, both domestically and in the conquered countries, were controlled by Goebbels and his department. The German Home Service, the Armed Forces Programme, and the German European Service were all rigorously controlled in everything from the information they were permitted to disseminate to the music they were allowed to play. Party rallies, speeches, and demonstrations continued; speeches were broadcast on the radio and short propaganda films were exhibited using 1,500 mobile film vans. Hitler made fewer public appearances and broadcasts as the war progressed, so Goebbels increasingly became the voice of the Nazi regime for the German people. From May 1940 he wrote frequent editorials that were published in &quot;Das Reich&quot; which were later read aloud over the radio. He found films to be his most effective propaganda medium, after radio. At his insistence, initially half the films made in wartime Germany were propaganda films (particularly on antisemitism) and war propaganda films (recounting both historical wars and current exploits of the Wehrmacht).

Goebbels became preoccupied with morale and the efforts of the people on the home front. He believed that the more the people at home were involved in the war effort, the better their morale would be. For example, he initiated a programme for the collection of winter clothing and ski equipment for troops on the eastern front. At the same time, Goebbels implemented changes to have more &quot;entertaining material&quot; in radio and film produced for the public, decreeing in late 1942 that 20 per cent of the films should be propaganda and 80 per cent light entertainment. As &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Berlin, Goebbels dealt with increasingly serious shortages of necessities such as food and clothing, as well as the need to ration beer and tobacco, which were important for morale. Hitler suggested watering the beer and degrading the quality of the cigarettes so that more could be produced, but Goebbels refused, saying the cigarettes were already of such low quality that it was impossible to make them any worse. Through his propaganda campaigns, he worked hard to maintain an appropriate level of morale among the public about the military situation, neither too optimistic nor too grim. The series of military setbacks the Germans suffered in this period – the thousand-bomber raid on Cologne (May 1942), the Allied victory at the Second Battle of El Alamein (November 1942), and especially the catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad (February 1943) – were difficult matters to present to the German public, who were increasingly weary of the war and sceptical that it could be won. On 16 November 1942 Goebbels, like all &quot;Gauleiters&quot;, was appointed the Reich Defense Commissioner for his &quot;Gau&quot;. This enabled him to issue direct instructions to authorities within his jurisdiction in matters concerning the civilian war effort. On 15 January 1943, Hitler appointed Goebbels as head of the newly created Air Raid Damage committee, which meant Goebbels was nominally in charge of nationwide civil air defences and shelters as well as the assessment and repair of damaged buildings. In actuality, the defence of areas other than Berlin remained in the hands of the local &quot;Gauleiters&quot;, and his main tasks were limited to providing immediate aid to the affected civilians and using propaganda to improve their morale.

By early 1943, the war produced a labour crisis for the regime. Hitler created a three-man committee with representatives of the State, the army, and the party in an attempt to centralise control of the war economy. The committee members were Hans Lammers (head of the Reich Chancellery), Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, chief of the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; (Armed Forces High Command; OKW), and Martin Bormann, who controlled the party. The committee was intended to independently propose measures regardless of the wishes of various ministries, with Hitler reserving most final decisions to himself. The committee, soon known as the &quot;Dreierausschuß&quot; (Committee of Three), met eleven times between January and August 1943. However, they ran up against resistance from Hitler&#x27;s cabinet ministers, who headed deeply entrenched spheres of influence and were excluded from the committee. Seeing it as a threat to their power, Goebbels, Göring, and Speer worked together to bring it down. The result was that nothing changed, and the Committee of Three declined into irrelevance by September 1943.

Partly in response to being excluded from the Committee of Three, Goebbels pressured Hitler to introduce measures that would produce &quot;total war&quot;, including closing businesses not essential to the war effort, conscripting women into the labour force, and enlisting men in previously exempt occupations into the Wehrmacht. Some of these measures were implemented in an edict of 13 January, but to Goebbels&#x27; dismay, Göring demanded that his favourite restaurants in Berlin should remain open, and Lammers successfully lobbied Hitler to have women with children exempted from conscription, even if they had child care available. After receiving an enthusiastic response to his speech of 30 January 1943 on the topic, Goebbels believed he had the support of the German people in his call for total war. His next speech, the Sportpalast speech of 18 February 1943, was a passionate demand for his audience to commit to total war, which he presented as the only way to stop the Bolshevik onslaught and save the German people from destruction. The speech also had a strong antisemitic element and hinted at the extermination of the Jewish people that was already underway. The speech was presented live on radio and was filmed as well. During the live version of the speech, Goebbels accidentally begins to mention the &quot;extermination&quot; of the Jews; this is omitted in the published text of the speech.

Goebbels&#x27; efforts had little impact for the time being, because Hitler, who in principle was in favour of total war, was not prepared to implement changes over the objections of his ministers. The discovery around this time of a mass grave of Polish officers that had been killed by the Red Army in the 1940 Katyn massacre was made use of by Goebbels in his propaganda in an attempt to drive a wedge between the Soviets and the other Western Allies.

===Plenipotentiary for total war===


After the Allied invasion of Sicily (July 1943) and the strategic Soviet victory in the Battle of Kursk (July–August 1943), Goebbels began to recognise that the war could no longer be won. Following the Allied invasion of Italy and the fall of Mussolini in September, he raised with Hitler the possibility of a separate peace, either with the Soviets or with Britain. Hitler rejected both of these proposals.

As Germany&#x27;s military and economic situation grew steadily worse, on 25 August 1943 &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler took over the post of interior minister, replacing Wilhelm Frick. Intensive air raids on Berlin and other cities took the lives of thousands of people. In December 1943, Hitler asked Goebbels to take on the job of &quot;Stadtpräsident&quot; (City President) of Berlin, and Goebbels agreed to this as a means of obtaining more direct control over the municipal authorities, though Hitler delayed the formal appointment for several months. Goebbels took over direct administrative control of the city when he was formally named &quot;Stadtpräsident&quot; on 7 April 1944, thus uniting under his control the city&#x27;s most powerful party and governmental offices. As air raids on Berlin continued, Göring&#x27;s Luftwaffe attempted to retaliate with air raids on London in early 1944, but they no longer had sufficient aircraft to make much of an impact. While Goebbels&#x27; propaganda in this period indicated that a huge retaliation was in the offing, the V-1 flying bombs, launched on British targets beginning in mid-June 1944, had little effect, with only around 20 per cent reaching their intended targets. To boost morale, Goebbels continued to publish propaganda to the effect that further improvements to these weapons would have a decisive impact on the outcome of the war. Meanwhile, in the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944, the Allies successfully gained a foothold in France.

Throughout July 1944, Goebbels and Speer continued to press Hitler to bring the economy to a total war footing. The 20 July plot, where Hitler was almost killed by a bomb at his field headquarters in East Prussia, played into the hands of those who had been pushing for change: Bormann, Goebbels, Himmler, and Speer. Over the objections of Göring, Goebbels was appointed on 23 July as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War, charged with maximising the manpower for the Wehrmacht and the armaments industry at the expense of sectors of the economy not critical to the war effort. Through these efforts, he was able to free up an additional half a million men for military service. However, as many of these new recruits came from the armaments industry, the move put him in conflict with armaments minister Speer. Untrained workers from elsewhere were not readily absorbed into the armaments industry, and likewise, the new Wehrmacht recruits waited in barracks for their turn to be trained.

Hitler ordered a nationwide militia of men previously considered unsuitable for military service — the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; (People&#x27;s Storm) — to be formed on 25 September 1944; it was launched on 18 October. In his capacity as &quot;Gauleiter&quot; and Reich Defense Commissioner, Goebbels was named &quot;Führer des Deutschen Volkssturms im Gau Groß-Berlin&quot; on 25 September 1944, and he administered the oath of allegiance to the assembled Berlin &quot;Volkssturm&quot; troops on 12 November. Goebbels recorded in his diary that 100,000 recruits were sworn in from his &quot;Gau&quot; alone. However, the men, mostly age 45 to 60, received only rudimentary training and many were not properly armed. Goebbels&#x27; notion that these men could effectively serve on the front lines against Soviet tanks and artillery was unrealistic at best. The programme was deeply unpopular.

Goebbels realised that his influence would diminish in wartime. He suffered a series of setbacks as propaganda became less important compared to warfare, the war economy, and the Allied bombing of German cities. Historian Michael Balfour states that from 1942 onward, Goebbels, &quot;lost control over Nazi policy toward the press and over the handling of news in general.&quot; Rival agencies expanded. The foreign ministry took charge of propaganda outside Germany. The military set up its own propaganda division, providing daily reports on the progress of the war and the conditions of the armed forces. The Nazi Party also generated and distributed its own propaganda during the war. Goebbels was still influential when he had the opportunity to meet with Hitler, who became less available as he moved his headquarters closer to the military front lines. They were together perhaps one day a month. Furthermore, Hitler rarely gave speeches or rallies of the sort that had dominated propaganda in the 1930s. After Hitler returned to Berlin in 1945, Goebbels&#x27; ministry was destroyed by an Allied air raid on 13 March, and Goebbels had great difficulty disseminating propaganda. In April 1945, he finally bested the rival agencies and took full charge of propaganda, but by then the Soviet Red Army had already entered Berlin. Goebbels was an astute observer of the war, and historians have exhaustively mined his diary for insights on how the Nazi leadership tried to maintain public morale.

===Defeat and death===
In the last months of the war, Goebbels&#x27; speeches and articles took on an increasingly apocalyptic tone. By the beginning of 1945, with the Soviets on the Oder River and the Western Allies preparing to cross the Rhine River, he could no longer disguise the inevitability of German defeat. Berlin had little in the way of fortifications or artillery, and even &quot;Volkssturm&quot; units were in short supply, as almost everything and everyone had been sent to the front. Goebbels noted in his diary on 21 January that millions of Germans were fleeing westward. He tentatively discussed with Hitler the issue of making peace overtures to the Western Allies, but Hitler again refused. Privately, Goebbels was conflicted at pushing the case with Hitler since he did not want to lose Hitler&#x27;s confidence.

When other Nazi leaders urged Hitler to leave Berlin and establish a new centre of resistance in the National Redoubt in Bavaria, Goebbels opposed this, arguing for a heroic last stand in Berlin. His family (except for Magda&#x27;s son Harald, who had served in the Luftwaffe and been captured by the Allies) moved into their house in Berlin to await the end. He and Magda may have discussed suicide and the fate of their young children in a long meeting on the night of 27 January. He knew how the outside world would view the criminal acts committed by the regime and had no desire to subject himself to the &quot;debacle&quot; of a trial. He burned his private papers on the night of 18 April.

Goebbels knew how to play on Hitler&#x27;s fantasies, encouraging him to see the hand of providence in the death of United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 12 April. Whether Hitler really saw this event as a turning point as Goebbels proclaimed is not known. By this time, Goebbels had gained the position he had wanted so long—at Hitler&#x27;s side. Göring was utterly discredited, although he was not stripped of his offices until 23 April. Himmler, whose appointment as commander of Army Group Vistula had led to disaster on the Oder, was also in disgrace with Hitler. Most of Hitler&#x27;s inner circle, including Göring, Himmler, Ribbentrop, and Speer, prepared to leave Berlin immediately after Hitler&#x27;s birthday celebration on 20 April. Even Bormann was &quot;not anxious&quot; to meet his end at Hitler&#x27;s side. On 22 April, Hitler announced that he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself. Goebbels moved with his family into the &quot;Vorbunker&quot;, connected to the lower &quot;Führerbunker&quot; under the Reich Chancellery garden in central Berlin, that same day. He told Vice-Admiral Hans-Erich Voss that he would not entertain the idea of either surrender or escape. On 23 April, Goebbels made the following proclamation to the people of Berlin:

After midnight on 29 April, with the Soviets advancing ever closer to the bunker complex, Hitler married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony in the &quot;Führerbunker&quot;. Afterward, he hosted a modest wedding breakfast. Hitler then took secretary Traudl Junge to another room and dictated his last will and testament. Goebbels and Bormann were two of the witnesses.

In his last will and testament, Hitler named no successor as Führer or leader of the Nazi Party. Instead, he appointed Goebbels as Reich Chancellor; Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, who was at Flensburg near the Danish border, as Reich President; and Bormann as Party Minister. Goebbels wrote a postscript to the will stating that he would &quot;categorically refuse&quot; to obey Hitler&#x27;s order to leave Berlin—as he put it, &quot;the first time in my life&quot; that he had not complied with Hitler&#x27;s orders. He felt compelled to remain with Hitler &quot;for reasons of humanity and personal loyalty&quot;. His wife and children would stay as well. They would end their lives &quot;side by side with the Führer&quot;.

In the mid-afternoon of 30 April, Hitler shot himself. Goebbels was depressed, and said he would walk around the Chancellery garden until he was killed by the Russian shelling. Voss later recounted Goebbels as saying: &quot;It is a great pity that such a man [Hitler] is not with us any longer. But there is nothing to be done. For us, everything is lost now and the only way out left for us is the one Hitler chose. I shall follow his example.&quot;

On 1 May, Goebbels carried out his sole official act as Chancellor: he dictated a letter to General Vasily Chuikov and ordered German General Hans Krebs to deliver it under a white flag. Chuikov, as commander of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, commanded the Soviet forces in central Berlin. Goebbels&#x27; letter informed Chuikov of Hitler&#x27;s death and requested a ceasefire. After this was rejected, Goebbels decided that further efforts were futile.

Later on 1 May, Voss saw Goebbels for the last time: &quot;While saying goodbye I asked Goebbels to join us. But he replied: &#x27;The captain must not leave his sinking ship. I have thought about it all and decided to stay here. I have nowhere to go because with little children I will not be able to make it, especially with a leg like mine&#x27;.&quot; On the evening of 1 May, Goebbels arranged for an SS dentist, Helmut Kunz, to inject his six children with morphine so that when they were unconscious, an ampule of a cyanide compound could be then crushed in each of their mouths. According to Kunz&#x27;s later testimony, he gave the children morphine injections but Magda Goebbels and SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Ludwig Stumpfegger, Hitler&#x27;s personal doctor, administered the cyanide.

At around 20:30, Goebbels and Magda left the bunker and walked up to the garden of the Chancellery, where they killed themselves. There are several different accounts of this event. One is that they each bit on a cyanide ampule near where Hitler had been buried and were given a coup de grâce immediately afterward. Goebbels&#x27; SS adjutant Günther Schwägermann testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up the stairs and out into the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard shots. Schwägermann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels&#x27; prior order, Schwägermann had an SS soldier fire several shots into Goebbels&#x27; body, which did not move. In a contradictory account, Rochus Misch claimed that mechanic Johannes Hentschel told him that early on 2 May, Goebbels killed himself in his room in the &quot;Führerbunker&quot;, while Magda did so in the &quot;Vorbunker&quot;.

The corpses were then doused with petrol, but they were only partially burned and not buried. A few days later, the Soviets brought Voss back to the bunker to identify the Goebbels&#x27; partly burned bodies. The remains of the Goebbels family, Krebs, and Hitler&#x27;s dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed. The last burial was at the SMERSH facility in Magdeburg on 21 February 1946. In 1970, KGB director Yuri Andropov authorised an operation to destroy the remains. On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the Magdeburg SMERSH facility. They were burned, crushed, and scattered into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the nearby Elbe.

==Family life==

Hitler was very fond of Magda and the children. He enjoyed staying at the Goebbels&#x27; Berlin apartment, where he could relax. Magda had a close relationship with Hitler, and became a member of his small coterie of female friends. She also became an unofficial representative of the regime, receiving letters from all over Germany from women with questions about domestic matters or child custody issues.

In 1936, Goebbels met the Czech actress Lída Baarová and by the winter of 1937 began an intense affair with her. Magda had a long conversation with Hitler about it on 15 August 1938. Unwilling to put up with a scandal involving one of his top ministers, Hitler demanded that Goebbels break off the relationship. Thereafter, Joseph and Magda seemed to reach a truce until the end of September. The couple had another falling out at that point, and again Hitler became involved, insisting the couple stay together. He arranged for publicity photos to be taken of himself with the reconciled couple in October. Goebbels also had short-term affairs and relationships with numerous other women. Magda too had affairs, including a relationship with Kurt Lüdecke in 1933 and Karl Hanke in 1938.

The Goebbels family included Harald Quandt (Magda&#x27;s son from her first marriage; b. 1921), plus Helga (b. 1932), Hilde (b. 1934), Helmut (b. 1935), Holde (b. 1937), Hedda (b. 1938), and Heide (b. 1940). Harald was the only member of the family to survive the war. He died in an aeroplane crash in 1967.

<text>Joel Daniel Coen (born November 29, 1954) and Ethan Jesse Coen (born September 21, 1957), together known as the Coen brothers (), are an American filmmaking duo. Their films span many genres and styles, which they frequently subvert or parody. Among their most acclaimed works are &quot;Blood Simple&quot; (1984), &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; (1987), &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot; (1990), &quot;Barton Fink&quot; (1991), &quot;Fargo&quot; (1996), &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; (1998), &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; (2000), &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; (2007), &quot;A Serious Man&quot; (2009), &quot;True Grit&quot; (2010) and &quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot; (2013).

The brothers generally write, direct and produce their films jointly, although due to DGA regulations, Joel received sole directing credit while Ethan received sole production credit until &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; (2004), from which point on they would be credited together as directors and producers; they also shared editing credits under the alias Roderick Jaynes. The duo started directing separately in the 2020s, resulting in Joel&#x27;s &quot;The Tragedy of Macbeth&quot; (2021) and Ethan&#x27;s &quot;Jerry Lee Lewis: Trouble in Mind&quot; (2022) and &quot;Drive-Away Dolls&quot; (2024). They have been nominated for 13 Academy Awards together, plus one individual nomination for each, sharing Best Original Screenplay for &quot;Fargo&quot;, and Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay for &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;. They won the for &quot;Barton Fink&quot; at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival.

The Coens have written films for other directors, including Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Crimewave&quot; (1985), Angelina Jolie&#x27;s World War II biopic &quot;Unbroken&quot; (2014) and Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Cold War drama &quot;Bridge of Spies&quot; (2015). They produced Terry Zwigoff&#x27;s &quot;Bad Santa&quot; (2003) and John Turturro&#x27;s &quot;Romance and Cigarettes&quot; (2005). Ethan is also a writer of short stories, theater and poetry.

They are known for their distinctive stylistic trademarks including genre hybridity. &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;, &quot;A Serious Man&quot; and &quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot; were included on the BBC&#x27;s 2016 poll of the greatest motion pictures since 2000. In 1998, the American Film Institute (AFI) ranked &quot;Fargo&quot; among the 100 greatest American movies. Richard Corliss wrote of the Coens: &quot;Dexterously flipping and reheating old movie genres like so many pancakes, they serve them up fresh, not with syrup but with a coating of comic arsenic.&quot;

== Background ==

=== Early life ===
Joel Daniel Coen (born November 29, 1954) and Ethan Jesse Coen (born September 21, 1957) were born and raised in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis. Their mother, Rena (née Neumann; 1925–2001), was an art historian at St. Cloud State University, and their father, Edward Coen (1919–2012), was a professor of economics at the University of Minnesota. The brothers have an older sister, Deborah, who is a psychiatrist in Israel.
Both sides of the Coen family were Eastern European Ashkenazi Jews. Their paternal grandfather, Victor Coen, was a barrister in the Inns of Court in London before retiring to Hove with their grandmother. Edward Coen was an American citizen born in the United States, but grew up in Croydon, London and studied at the London School of Economics. Afterwards he moved to the United States, where he met the Coens&#x27; mother, and served in the United States Army during World War II.

The Coens developed an early interest in cinema through television. They grew up watching Italian films (ranging from the works of Federico Fellini to the &quot;Sons of Hercules&quot; films) aired on a Minneapolis station, the Tarzan films, and comedies (Jerry Lewis, Bob Hope and Doris Day).

In the mid-1960s, Joel saved money from mowing lawns to buy a Vivitar Super 8 camera. Together, the brothers remade movies they saw on television, with their neighborhood friend Mark Zimering (&quot;Zeimers&quot;) as the star. Cornel Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Naked Prey&quot; (1965) became their &quot;Zeimers in Zambezi&quot;, which featured Ethan as a native with a spear. &quot;Lassie Come Home&quot; (1943) was reinterpreted as their &quot;Ed... A Dog&quot;, with Ethan playing the mother role in his sister&#x27;s tutu. They also made original films like &quot;Henry Kissinger, Man on the Go&quot;, &quot;Lumberjacks of the North&quot; and &quot;The Banana Film&quot;.

=== Education ===
Joel and Ethan graduated from St. Louis Park High School in 1973 and 1976, respectively, and from Bard College at Simon&#x27;s Rock in Great Barrington, Massachusetts.

After Simon&#x27;s Rock, Joel spent four years in the undergraduate film program at New York University, where he made a 30-minute thesis film, &quot;Soundings&quot;. In 1979, he briefly enrolled in the graduate film program at the University of Texas at Austin, following a woman he had married who was in the graduate linguistics program. The marriage soon ended in divorce and Joel left UT Austin after nine months.

Ethan went on to Princeton University and earned an undergraduate degree in philosophy in 1979. His senior thesis was a 41-page essay, &quot;Two Views of Wittgenstein&#x27;s Later Philosophy&quot;, which was supervised by Raymond Geuss.

== Career ==
=== 1980s ===
After graduating from New York University, Joel worked as a production assistant on a variety of industrial films and music videos. He developed a talent for film editing and met Sam Raimi while assisting Edna Ruth Paul in editing Raimi&#x27;s first feature film, &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; (1981).

The duo made their debut with &quot;Blood Simple&quot; (1984). Set in Texas, it tells the tale of a bar owner (Dan Hedaya) who hires a detective (M. Emmet Walsh) to kill his wife and her lover (Frances McDormand and John Getz, respectively). It contains elements that point to their future direction: distinctive homages to genre movies (in this case noir and horror), plot twists layered over a simple story, snappy dialogue and dark humor. Janet Maslin wrote: &quot;The camera work by Barry Sonnenfeld is especially dazzling. So is the fact that Mr. Coen, unlike many people who have directed great-looking film noir efforts, knows better than to let handsomeness become the film&#x27;s entire raison d&#x27;être. In addition to its stylishness, &quot;Blood Simple&quot; has the kind of purposefulness and coherence that show Mr. Coen to be headed for bigger, even better, things.&quot; Joel&#x27;s direction was recognized at the Sundance and Independent Spirit awards. It was the first film shot by Sonnenfeld, who collaborated with the Coens on their two subsequent films and went on to be a director. It marked the first of many collaborations between the Coens and composer Carter Burwell. It was also the screen debut of McDormand, who went on to feature in many of the Coens&#x27; films (and marry Joel). 

Their next project was &quot;Crimewave&quot; (Raimi, 1985), written by the Coens and Raimi. Joel and Raimi also made cameos in &quot;Spies Like Us&quot; (1985).

The brothers wanted to follow their debut with something fast-paced and funny. &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; (1987) follows an unlikely married couple: ex-convict H.I. (Nicolas Cage) and police officer Ed (Holly Hunter), who long for a baby but are unable to conceive. When furniture tycoon Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson) appears on television with his newly born quintuplets and jokes that they &quot;are more than we can handle&quot;, H.I. steals one of the quintuplets to bring up as their own. Pauline Kael noted its &quot;cornpone-surreal quality&quot; and wrote that the Coens &quot;are going with their strengths. They&#x27;re making a contraption, and they&#x27;re good at it because they know how to make the camera behave mechanically, which is just right here—it mirrors the mechanics of farce ... The Sunsets look marvellously ultra-vivid; the paint doesn&#x27;t seem to be dry—it&#x27;s like opening day at a miniature-golf course.&quot; Geoff Andrew wrote: &quot;the lives and times of Hi, Ed and friends are painted in splendidly seedy colours, turning Arizona into a mythical haven for a memorable gaggle of no-hopers, halfwits and has-beens. Starting from a point of delirious excess, the film leaps into dark and virtually uncharted territory to soar like a comet.&quot; The film featured McDormand, William Forsythe, Sam McMurray, Randall &quot;Tex&quot; Cobb and marked the first of many collaborations between the Coens and John Goodman.

=== 1990s ===
&quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot; (1990) is a gangster film inspired by Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s &quot;Red Harvest&quot; (1929) and &quot;The Glass Key&quot; (1931). It stars Gabriel Byrne as Irish mobster Tom Reagan and features Albert Finney, Marcia Gay Harden, Steve Buscemi, Jon Polito and John Turturro. The film was released almost simultaneously with &quot;Goodfellas&quot; and was not a commercial success, but received positive reviews. Christopher Orr calls it &quot;a distillation of all the tropes and themes and moods of the classic gangster film.&quot; It was the Coens&#x27; first collaboration with production designer Dennis Gassner.

They followed it with &quot;Barton Fink&quot; (1991); set in 1941, it follows a New York playwright, the eponymous Fink (Turturro), who moves to Los Angeles to write a B-picture for a venal movie mogul (Michael Lerner). Fink is modeled on playwright Clifford Odets, and the character W.P. Mayhew (John Mahoney) is based on William Faulkner. &quot;Barton Fink&quot; was a critical success, earning Oscar nominations and winning Best Director, Best Actor and at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival. It was their first film with cinematographer Roger Deakins, a key collaborator for the next 25 years.

&quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot; (1994) is an homage to the screwball comedies of Frank Capra and Howard Hawks. Co-written with Raimi, the film follows a mailroom clerk (Tim Robbins) who is promoted to president of the Hudsucker corporation by a cynical director (Paul Newman) in a scheme to devalue the company&#x27;s stock; a fast-talking newspaperwoman (Jennifer Jason Leigh) tries to scoop the story. Critics praised the production design but criticized the tone. It was a box office bomb ($30 million budget, $3 million gross in the US).

The brothers bounced back with the &quot;homespun murder story&quot; &quot;Fargo&quot; (1996), set in their home state of Minnesota. In it, car salesman Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), who has serious financial problems, has his wife kidnapped so that his wealthy father-in-law (Harve Presnell) will pay the ransom, which he plans to split with the kidnappers (Buscemi and Peter Stormare). Complications ensue, and local cop Marge Gunderson (McDormand) starts to investigate. Produced on a small budget of $7 million, &quot;Fargo&quot; was a critical and commercial success, with particular praise for its dialogue and McDormand&#x27;s performance. The film received several awards, including a BAFTA award and Cannes award for direction, and two Oscars: a Best Original Screenplay and a Best Actress Oscar for McDormand. Roger Ebert wrote that &quot;it rotates its story through satire, comedy, suspense, and violence, until it emerges as one of the best films I&#x27;ve ever seen. To watch it is to experience steadily mounting delight, as you realize the filmmakers have taken enormous risks, gotten away with them, and have made a movie that is completely original, and as familiar as an old shoe – or a rubber-soled hunting boot from Land&#x27;s End, more likely.&quot;

&quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; (1998) is a crime comedy about Jeff &quot;The Dude&quot; Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), a Los Angeles slacker who is involved in a kidnapping case after being mistaken for a millionaire of the same name (David Huddleston.) It features Philip Seymour Hoffman as Lebowski&#x27;s flunky, Goodman and Buscemi as The Dude&#x27;s bowling buddies and Julianne Moore as his &quot;special lady friend&quot;. It was influenced by Raymond Chandler&#x27;s &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1939) and Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot;. It has become a cult classic. An annual festival, Lebowski Fest, began in 2002, and many adhere to the philosophy of &quot;Dudeism&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked it 8th on their Funniest Movies of the Past 25 Years list in 2008. It was the first collaboration between the Coens and T Bone Burnett, credited as &quot;Music Archivist&quot;.

=== 2000s ===

The Coen brothers&#x27; next film, &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; (2000), was another critical and commercial success. The title was borrowed from the Preston Sturges film &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1941), whose lead character, movie director John Sullivan, had planned to make a film with that title. Based loosely on Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; (complete with a Cyclops, sirens, &quot;et al.&quot;), the story is set in Mississippi in the 1930s and follows a trio of escaped convicts who, after absconding from a chain gang, journey home to recover bank-heist loot the leader has buried—but they have no clear perception of where they are going. The film highlighted the comic abilities of George Clooney as the oddball lead character Ulysses Everett McGill, and of Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro, his sidekicks. The film&#x27;s bluegrass and old-time soundtrack, offbeat humor and digitally desaturated cinematography made it a critical and commercial hit. It was the first feature film to use all-digital color grading. The film&#x27;s soundtrack CD was also successful, spawning a concert and concert/documentary DVD, &quot;Down from the Mountain.&quot;

The Coens next produced another noirish thriller, &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot; (2001).

The Coens directed the 2003 film &quot;Intolerable Cruelty&quot;, starring George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones, a throwback to the romantic comedies of the 1940s. It focuses on hotshot divorce lawyer Miles Massey and a beautiful divorcée whom Massey managed to prevent from receiving any money in her divorce. She vows to get even with him while, at the same time, he becomes smitten with her. &quot;Intolerable Cruelty&quot; received generally positive reviews, although it is considered one of the duo&#x27;s weaker films. Also that year, they executive produced and did an uncredited rewrite of the Christmas black comedy &quot;Bad Santa&quot;, which garnered positive reviews.

In 2004, the Coens made &quot;The Ladykillers&quot;, a remake of the British classic by Ealing Studios. A professor, played by Tom Hanks, assembles a team to rob a casino. They rent a room in an elderly woman&#x27;s home to plan the heist. When the woman discovers the plot, the gang decides to murder her to ensure her silence. The Coens received some of the most lukewarm reviews of their careers in response to this film.

They directed two short films for two separate anthology films—&quot;Paris, je t&#x27;aime&quot; (&quot;Tuileries&quot;, 2006) starring Steve Buscemi, and &quot;To Each His Own Cinema&quot; (&quot;World Cinema&quot;, 2007) starring Josh Brolin. Both films received highly positive reviews.

&quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;, released in November 2007, closely follows the 2005 novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy. Vietnam veteran Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), living near the Texas/Mexico border, stumbles upon, and decides to take, two million dollars in drug money. He must then go on the run to avoid those trying to recover the money, including sociopathic killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), who confounds both Llewelyn and local sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones). The plotline is a return to noir themes, but in some respects it was a departure for the Coens; with the exception of Stephen Root, none of the stable of regular actors appears in the film. &quot;No Country&quot; received nearly universal critical praise, garnering a 94% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating at Rotten Tomatoes. It won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, all of which were received by the Coens, as well as Best Supporting Actor received by Bardem. The Coens, as &quot;Roderick Jaynes&quot;, were also nominated for Best Editing, but lost. It was the first time since 1961 (when Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise won for &quot;West Side Story&quot;) that two directors received the Academy Award for Best Director at the same time.

In January 2008, Ethan Coen&#x27;s play &quot;Almost an Evening&quot; premiered off-broadway at the Atlantic Theater Company Stage 2, opening to mostly enthusiastic reviews. The initial run closed on February 10, 2008, but the same production was moved to a new theatre for a commercial off-Broadway run at the Bleecker Street Theater in New York City. Produced by The Atlantic Theater Company, it ran there from March 2008 through June 1, 2008. and Art Meets Commerce. In May 2009, the Atlantic Theater Company produced Coen&#x27;s &quot;Offices&quot;, as part of their mainstage season at the Linda Gross Theater.

&quot;Burn After Reading&quot;, a comedy starring Brad Pitt and George Clooney, was released September 12, 2008, and portrays a collision course between two gym instructors, spies and Internet dating. Released to positive reviews, it debuted at No. 1 in North America.

In 2009, the Coens directed a television commercial titled &quot;Air Freshener&quot; for the Reality Coalition.

They next directed &quot;A Serious Man&quot;, released October 2, 2009, a &quot;gentle but dark&quot; period comedy (set in 1967) with a low budget. The film is based loosely on the Coens&#x27; childhoods in an academic family in the largely Jewish suburb of Saint Louis Park, Minnesota; it also drew comparisons to the &quot;Book of Job&quot;. Filming took place late in the summer of 2008, in the neighborhoods of Roseville and Bloomington, Minnesota, at Normandale Community College, and at St. Olaf College. The film was nominated for the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay.

=== 2010s ===
&quot;True Grit&quot; (2010) is based on the 1968 novel of the same name by Charles Portis. Filming was done in Texas and New Mexico. Hailee Steinfeld stars as Mattie Ross along with Jeff Bridges as Marshal Rooster Cogburn. Matt Damon and Josh Brolin also appear in the movie. &quot;True Grit&quot; was nominated for ten Academy Awards including Best Picture.

Ethan Coen wrote the one-act comedy &quot;Talking Cure&quot;, which was produced on Broadway in 2011 as part of &quot;Relatively Speaking&quot;, an anthology of three one-act plays by Coen, Elaine May, and Woody Allen.

In 2011, the Coen brothers won the $1 million Dan David Prize for their contribution to cinema and society.

&quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot; (2013) is a treatise on the 1960s folk music scene in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village, and very loosely based on the life of Dave Van Ronk. The film stars Oscar Isaac, Justin Timberlake, and Carey Mulligan. It won the Grand Prix at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, where it was highly praised by critics. They received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Original Song for &quot;Please Mr. Kennedy&quot;, which is heard in the film.

&quot;Fargo&quot;, a television series inspired by their film of the same name, premiered in April 2014 on the FX network. It is created by Noah Hawley and executive produced by the brothers.

The Coens also contributed to the screenplay for &quot;Unbroken&quot;, along with Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson. The film is directed by Angelina Jolie and based on Laura Hillenbrand&#x27;s non-fiction book, &quot;&quot; (2010) which itself was based on the life of Louis Zamperini. It was released on December 25, 2014, to average reviews.

The Coens co-wrote, with playwright Matt Charman, the screenplay for the dramatic historical thriller &quot;Bridge of Spies&quot;, about the 1960 U-2 Incident. The film was directed by Steven Spielberg, and released on October 4, 2015, to critical acclaim. They were nominated for the Best Original Screenplay at the 88th Academy Awards.

The Coens directed the film &quot;Hail, Caesar!&quot;, about a &quot;fixer&quot; in 1950s Hollywood trying to discover what happened to a cast member who vanishes during filming. It stars Coen regulars George Clooney, Josh Brolin, Frances McDormand, Scarlett Johansson and Tilda Swinton, as well as Channing Tatum, Ralph Fiennes, Jonah Hill, and Alden Ehrenreich. The film was released on February 5, 2016.

In 2016, the Coens gave to their longtime friend and collaborator John Turturro the right to use his character of Jesus Quintana from &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; in his own spin-off, &quot;The Jesus Rolls&quot;, which he would also write and direct. The Coens have no involvement in the production. In August 2016, the film began principal photography.

The Coens first wrote the script for &quot;Suburbicon&quot; in 1986. The film was eventually directed by George Clooney and began filming in October 2016. It was released by Paramount Pictures in the fall of 2017.

The Coens directed &quot;The Ballad of Buster Scruggs&quot;, a Western anthology starring Tim Blake Nelson, Liam Neeson, and James Franco. It began streaming on Netflix on November 16, 2018, after a brief theatrical run.

===2020s===
It was announced in March 2019 that Joel Coen would be directing an adaptation of &quot;Macbeth&quot; starring Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand. The film, titled &quot;The Tragedy of Macbeth&quot;, was Joel&#x27;s first directorial effort without his brother, who was taking a break from films to focus on theater. The film premiered at the 2021 New York Film Festival. The 2022 Cannes Film Festival had a special screening of &quot;Jerry Lee Lewis: Trouble in Mind&quot;, an archival documentary film directed solely by Ethan Coen and edited by his wife Tricia Cooke. In 2022, it was announced that Ethan Coen would be directing &quot;Drive-Away Dolls&quot; for Focus Features and Working Title from a script he co-wrote with Cooke. It would be Ethan&#x27;s first narrative film without his brother. The film was released in February 2024.

=== Planned and uncompleted projects ===
=== Production company ===
The Coen brothers&#x27; own film production company, Mike Zoss Productions located in New York City, has been credited on their films from &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; onwards. It was named after Mike Zoss Drug, an independent pharmacy in St. Louis Park since 1950 that was the brothers&#x27; beloved hangout when they were growing up in the Twin Cities. The name was also used for the pharmacy in &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;. The Mike Zoss logo consists of a crayon drawing of a horse, standing in a field of grass with its head turned around as it looks back over its hindquarters.

== Directing distinctions ==
Up to 2003, Joel received sole credit for directing and Ethan for producing, due to guild rules that disallowed multiple director credits to prevent dilution of the position&#x27;s significance. The only exception to this rule is if the co-directors are an &quot;established duo&quot;. Since 2004 they have been able to share the director credit and the Coen brothers have become only the third duo to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director.

With four Academy Award nominations for &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; for the duo (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing as Roderick Jaynes), the Coen brothers have tied the record for the most nominations by a single nominee (counting an &quot;established duo&quot; as one nominee) for the same film. Orson Welles set the record in 1941 with &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; being nominated for Best Picture (though at the time, individual producers were not named as nominees), Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Original Screenplay. Warren Beatty received the same nominations, first for &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; in 1978 and again in 1981 with &quot;Reds&quot;. Alan Menken also then achieved the same feat when he was nominated for Best Score and triple-nominated for Best Song for &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; in 1991. Most recently Chloé Zhao matched this record in 2021 when she was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing for &quot;Nomadland&quot; (which also starred McDormand in her third Oscar-winning role).

== Personal lives ==
Joel has been married to actress Frances McDormand since 1984. In 1995, they adopted a son, Pedro McDormand Coen, from Paraguay when he was six months old. McDormand has acted in a number of Coen Brothers films: &quot;Blood Simple&quot;, &quot;Raising Arizona&quot;, &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot;, &quot;Barton Fink&quot;, &quot;Fargo&quot;, &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot;, &quot;Burn After Reading&quot;, and &quot;Hail, Caesar!&quot; For her performance in &quot;Fargo&quot;, she won the Academy Award for Best Actress.

Ethan married film editor Tricia Cooke in 1993. They have two children: daughter Dusty and son Buster Jacob. The two describe their relationship as &quot;nontraditional&quot;; Cooke identifies as both queer and lesbian and Ethan as straight, and the two have separate partners. They co-wrote the film &quot;Drive-Away Dolls&quot;, which Ethan directed and Tricia edited. Ethan published &quot;Gates of Eden&quot;, a collection of short stories, in 1998. The same year, he co-wrote the comedy &quot;The Naked Man&quot;, directed by their storyboard artist J. Todd Anderson.

Ethan Coen and family live in New York, while Joel Coen and Frances McDormand live in Marin County, California.

<doc id="15781" wikidata="Q909" url="?curid=15781" title="Jorge Luis Borges">
<text>Jorge Francisco Isidoro Luis Borges Acevedo ( ; ; 24 August 1899 – 14 June 1986) was an Argentine short-story writer, essayist, poet and translator regarded as a key figure in Spanish-language and international literature. His best-known works, () and (), published in the 1940s, are collections of short stories exploring motifs such as dreams, labyrinths, chance, infinity, archives, mirrors, fictional writers and mythology. Borges&#x27;s works have contributed to philosophical literature and the fantasy genre, and have had a major influence on the magic realist movement in 20th century Latin American literature.

Born in Buenos Aires, Borges later moved with his family to Switzerland in 1914, where he studied at the Collège de Genève. The family travelled widely in Europe, including Spain. On his return to Argentina in 1921, Borges began publishing his poems and essays in surrealist literary journals. He also worked as a librarian and public lecturer. In 1955, he was appointed director of the National Public Library and professor of English Literature at the University of Buenos Aires. He became completely blind by the age of 55. Scholars have suggested that his progressive blindness helped him to create innovative literary symbols through imagination. By the 1960s, his work was translated and published widely in the United States and Europe. Borges himself was fluent in several languages.

In 1961, Borges came to international attention when he received the first Formentor Prize, which he shared with Samuel Beckett. In 1971, he won the Jerusalem Prize. His international reputation was consolidated in the 1960s, aided by the growing number of English translations, the Latin American Boom, and by the success of García Márquez&#x27;s &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;. He dedicated his final work, &quot;The Conspirators&quot;, to the city of Geneva, Switzerland. Writer and essayist J. M. Coetzee said of him: &quot;He, more than anyone, renovated the language of fiction and thus opened the way to a remarkable generation of Spanish-American novelists.&quot; David Foster Wallace wrote: &quot;The truth, briefly stated, is that Borges is arguably the great bridge between modernism and post-modernism in world literature. He is modernist in that his fiction shows a first-rate human mind stripped of all foundations of religious or ideological certainty – a mind turned wholly inward on itself. His stories are inbent and hermetic, with the oblique terror of a game whose rules are unknown and its stakes everything.&quot;

==Life and career==
===Early life and education===
Jorge Francisco Isidoro Luis Borges Acevedo was born into an educated middle-class family on 24 August 1899. They were in comfortable circumstances but not wealthy enough to live in downtown Buenos Aires, so the family resided in Palermo, then a poorer neighborhood. Borges&#x27;s mother, Leonor Acevedo Suárez, worked as a translator and came from a family of criollo (Spanish) origin. Her family had been much involved in the European settling of South America and the Argentine War of Independence, and she spoke often of their heroic actions.

His 1929 book &quot;Cuaderno San Martín&quot; includes the poem &quot;Isidoro Acevedo&quot;, commemorating his grandfather, Isidoro de Acevedo Laprida, a soldier of the Buenos Aires Army. A descendant of the Argentine lawyer and politician Francisco Narciso de Laprida, Acevedo Laprida fought in the battles of Cepeda in 1859, Pavón in 1861, and Los Corrales in 1880. Acevedo Laprida died of pulmonary congestion in the house where his grandson Jorge Luis Borges was born. According to a study by Antonio Andrade, Jorge Luis Borges had Portuguese ancestry: Borges&#x27;s great-grandfather, Francisco, was born in Portugal in 1770, and lived in Torre de Moncorvo, in the north of the country, before he emigrated to Argentina, where he married Carmen Lafinur.

Borges&#x27;s own father, Jorge Guillermo Borges Haslam, was a lawyer and wrote the novel &quot;El caudillo&quot; in 1921. Borges Haslam was born in Entre Ríos of Spanish, Portuguese, and English descent, the son of Francisco Borges Lafinur, a colonel, and Frances Ann Haslam, an Englishwoman. Borges Haslam grew up speaking English at home. The family frequently traveled to Europe. Borges Haslam wedded Leonor Acevedo Suárez in 1898 and their children also included the painter Norah Borges, sister of Jorge Luis Borges.

At age ten, Jorge Luis Borges translated Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Happy Prince&quot; into Spanish. It was published in a local journal, but Borges&#x27;s friends thought the real author was his father. Borges Haslam was a lawyer and psychology teacher who harboured literary aspirations. Borges said his father &quot;tried to become a writer and failed in the attempt&quot;, despite the 1921 opus &quot;El caudillo&quot;. Jorge Luis Borges wrote, &quot;As most of my people had been soldiers and I knew I would never be, I felt ashamed, quite early, to be a bookish kind of person and not a man of action.&quot;

Jorge Luis Borges was taught at home until the age of 11 and was bilingual in Spanish and English, reading Shakespeare in the latter at the age of twelve. The family lived in a large house with an English library of over one thousand volumes; Borges would later remark that &quot;if I were asked to name the chief event in my life, I should say my father&#x27;s library.&quot;

His father gave up practicing law due to the failing eyesight that would eventually affect his son. In 1914, the family moved to Geneva, Switzerland, and spent the next decade in Europe. In Geneva, Borges Haslam was treated by an eye specialist, while his son and daughter attended school. Jorge Luis learned French, read Thomas Carlyle in English, and began to read philosophy in German. In 1917, when he was eighteen, he met writer Maurice Abramowicz and began a literary friendship that lasted for the remainder of his life. He received his baccalauréat from the Collège de Genève in 1918. The Borges family decided that, due to political unrest in Argentina, they would remain in Switzerland during the war. After World War I, the family spent three years living in various cities: Lugano, Barcelona, Majorca, Seville, and Madrid. They remained in Europe until 1921.

At that time, Borges discovered the writings of Arthur Schopenhauer and Gustav Meyrink&#x27;s &quot;The Golem&quot; (1915), which became influential to his work. In Spain, Borges became a member of the avant-garde, anti-Modernismo Ultraist literary movement, inspired by Guillaume Apollinaire and Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, close to the Imagists. His first poem, &quot;Hymn to the Sea&quot;, written in the style of Walt Whitman, was published in the magazine &quot;Grecia&quot;. While in Spain, he met such noted Spanish writers as Rafael Cansinos Assens and Ramón Gómez de la Serna.
===Early writing career===
In 1921, Borges returned with his family to Buenos Aires. He had little formal education, no qualifications and few friends. He wrote to a friend that Buenos Aires was now &quot;overrun by arrivistes, by correct youths lacking any mental equipment, and decorative young ladies&quot;. He brought with him the doctrine of Ultraism and launched his career, publishing surreal poems and essays in literary journals. In 1923, Borges first published his poetry, a collection called &quot;Fervor de Buenos Aires&quot;, and contributed to the avant-garde review &quot;Martín Fierro&quot;. Borges co-founded the journals &quot;Prisma&quot;, a broadsheet distributed largely by pasting copies to walls in Buenos Aires, and &quot;Proa&quot;. Later in life, Borges regretted some of these early publications, attempting to purchase all known copies to ensure their destruction.

By the mid-1930s, he began to explore existential questions and fiction. He worked in a style that Argentine critic Ana María Barrenechea has called &quot;irreality.&quot; Many other Latin American writers, such as Juan Rulfo, Juan José Arreola, and Alejo Carpentier, were investigating these themes, influenced by the phenomenology of Husserl and Heidegger. In this vein, Borges biographer Edwin Williamson underlines the danger of inferring an autobiographically inspired basis for the content or tone of certain of his works: books, philosophy, and imagination were as much a source of real inspiration to him as his own lived experience, if not more so. 

From the first issue, Borges was a regular contributor to &quot;Sur&quot;, founded in 1931 by Victoria Ocampo. It was then Argentina&#x27;s most important literary journal and helped Borges find his fame. Ocampo introduced Borges to Adolfo Bioy Casares, another well-known figure of Argentine literature who was to become a frequent collaborator and close friend. They wrote a number of works together, some under the &quot;nom de plume&quot; H. Bustos Domecq, including a parody detective series and fantasy stories. During these years, a family friend, Macedonio Fernández, became a major influence on Borges. The two would preside over discussions in cafés, at country retreats, or in Fernandez&#x27;s tiny apartment in the Balvanera district. He appears by name in Borges&#x27;s &quot;Dialogue about a Dialogue&quot;, in which the two discuss the immortality of the soul.

In 1933, Borges gained an editorial appointment at &quot;Revista Multicolor de los Sábados&quot; (the literary supplement of the Buenos Aires newspaper &quot;Crítica&quot;), where he first published the pieces collected as &quot;Historia universal de la infamia&quot; (&quot;A Universal History of Infamy&quot;) in 1935. The book includes two types of writing: the first lies somewhere between non-fiction essays and short stories, using fictional techniques to tell essentially true stories. The second consists of literary forgeries, which Borges initially passed off as translations of passages from famous but seldom-read works.

In the following years, he served as a literary adviser for the publishing house Emecé Editores, and from 1936 to 1939 wrote weekly columns for &quot;El Hogar&quot;. In 1938, Borges found work as the first assistant at the Miguel Cané Municipal Library. It was in a working-class area and there were so few books that cataloging more than one hundred books per day, he was told, would leave little to do for the other staff and would make them look bad. The task took him about an hour each day and the rest of his time he spent in the basement of the library, writing and translating.

===Later career===

Borges&#x27;s father died in 1938, shortly before his 64th birthday. On Christmas Eve that year, Borges had a severe head injury; during treatment, he nearly died of sepsis. While recovering from the accident, Borges began exploring a new style of writing for which he would become famous. His first story written after his accident, &quot;Pierre Menard, Author of the &quot;Quixote&quot;,&quot; came out in May 1939. One of his most famous works, &quot;Menard&quot; examines the nature of authorship, as well as the relationship between an author and his historical context. His first collection of short stories, &quot;El jardín de senderos que se bifurcan&quot; (&quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot;), appeared in 1941, composed mostly of works previously published in &quot;Sur&quot;.

The title story concerns a Chinese professor in England, Dr. Yu Tsun, who spies for Germany during World War I, in an attempt to prove to the authorities that an Asian person is able to obtain the information that they seek. A combination of book and maze, it can be read in many ways. Through it, Borges arguably invented the hypertext novel and went on to describe a theory of the universe based upon the structure of such a novel.

Composed of stories taking up over sixty pages, the book was generally well received, but &quot;El jardín de senderos que se bifurcan&quot; failed to garner for him the literary prizes many in his circle expected. Victoria Ocampo dedicated a large portion of the July 1942 issue of &quot;Sur&quot; to a &quot;Reparation for Borges.&quot; Numerous leading writers and critics from Argentina and throughout the Spanish-speaking world contributed writings to the &quot;reparation&quot; project.

With his vision beginning to fade in his early thirties and unable to support himself as a writer, Borges began a new career as a public lecturer. He became an increasingly public figure, obtaining appointments as president of the Argentine Society of Writers and as professor of English and American Literature at the Argentine Association of English Culture. His short story &quot;Emma Zunz&quot; was made into a film (under the name of &quot;Días de odio&quot;, &quot;Days of Hate&quot;, directed in 1954 by Leopoldo Torre Nilsson). Around this time, Borges also began writing screenplays.

The American novelist William Faulkner was already a well-known writer in the Spanish-speaking world when Borges translated his novel &quot;The Wild Palms&quot; in 1940. Borges was a great admirer of Faulkner, but it&#x27;s likely his choice to translate a lesser novel was born out of opportunity and need. The novel had been published in the US in 1939, and Borges may have needed the money such work would bring. Nevertheless, his translation formed an indelible bridge between contemporary Latin American literature and the writer of the southern United States. Borges intuitive understanding of and his ability to render Faulkner&#x27;s style was an important influence on a later generation of writers such as Juan Rulfo, Mario Vargas Llosa, and Gabriel García Marquez.

In 1955, Borges became director of the Argentine National Library. By the late 1950s he had become completely blind. Neither the coincidence nor the irony of his blindness as a writer escaped Borges:

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Nadie rebaje a lágrima o reproche&quot;
&quot;esta declaración de la maestría&quot;
&quot;de Dios, que con magnífica ironía&quot;
&quot;me dio a la vez los libros y la noche.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
No one should read self-pity or reproach
Into this statement of the majesty
Of God; who with such splendid irony,
Granted me books and night at one touch.
&lt;/poem&gt;
His later collection of poetry, &quot;Elogio de la Sombra&quot; (&quot;In Praise of Darkness&quot;), develops this theme. In 1956 the University of Cuyo awarded Borges the first of many honorary doctorates and the following year he received the National Prize for Literature. From 1956 to 1970, Borges also held a position as a professor of literature at the University of Buenos Aires and other temporary appointments at other universities. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1964. In the fall of 1967 and spring of 1968, he delivered the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures at Harvard University.

As his eyesight deteriorated, Borges relied increasingly on his mother&#x27;s help. When he was not able to read and write anymore (he never learned to read Braille), his mother, to whom he had always been close, became his personal secretary. When Perón returned from exile and was re-elected president in 1973, Borges immediately resigned as director of the National Library.

===International renown===

Eight of Borges&#x27;s poems appear in the 1943 anthology of Spanish American Poets by H. R. Hays. &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot;, one of the first Borges stories to be translated into English, appeared in the August 1948 issue of &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;, translated by Anthony Boucher. Though several other Borges translations appeared in literary magazines and anthologies during the 1950s (and one story appeared in the fantasy and science fiction magazine &quot;Fantastic Universe&quot; in 1960), his international fame dates from the early 1960s.

In 1961, Borges received the first &quot;Prix International&quot;, which he shared with Samuel Beckett. While Beckett had garnered a distinguished reputation in Europe and America, Borges had been largely unknown and untranslated in the English-speaking world and the prize stirred great interest in his work. The Italian government named Borges &quot;Commendatore&quot; and the University of Texas at Austin appointed him for one year to the Tinker Chair. This led to his first lecture tour in the United States. In 1962, two major anthologies of Borges&#x27;s writings were published in English by New York presses: &quot;Ficciones&quot; and &quot;Labyrinths&quot;. In that year, Borges began lecture tours of Europe. Numerous honors were to accumulate over the years such as a Special Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Mystery Writers of America &quot;for distinguished contribution to the mystery genre&quot; (1976), the Balzan Prize (for Philology, Linguistics and literary Criticism) and the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca, the Miguel de Cervantes Prize (all 1980), as well as the French Legion of Honour (1983) and the Diamond Konex Award for Literature Arts as the most important writer in the last decade in his country.

In 1967, Borges began a five-year period of collaboration with the American translator Norman Thomas di Giovanni, through whom he became better known in the English-speaking world. Di Giovanni contended that Borges&#x27;s popularity was due to his writing with multiple languages in mind and deliberately using Latin words as a bridge from Spanish to English.

Borges continued to publish books, among them &quot;El libro de los seres imaginarios&quot; (&quot;Book of Imaginary Beings&quot;, 1967, co-written with Margarita Guerrero), &quot;El informe de Brodie&quot; (&quot;Dr. Brodie&#x27;s Report&quot;, 1970), and &quot;El libro de arena&quot; (&quot;The Book of Sand&quot;, 1975). He lectured prolifically. Many of these lectures were anthologized in volumes such as &quot;Siete noches&quot; (&quot;Seven Nights&quot;) and &quot;Nueve ensayos dantescos&quot; (&quot;Nine Dantesque Essays&quot;).

His presence in 1967 on campus at the University of Virginia (UVA) in the U.S. mirrored William Faulkner&#x27;s tenure there ten years earlier as UVa&#x27;s first writer-in-residence and influenced a group of students among whom was Jared Loewenstein, who would later become founder and curator of the Jorge Luis Borges Collection at UVA, one of the largest repositories of documents and manuscripts pertaining to Borges&#x27;s early works. In 1984, he travelled to Athens, Greece, and later to Rethymnon, Crete, where he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the School of Philosophy at the University of Crete.

===Later personal life===
In the mid-1960s, Borges became acquainted with Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the future Pope Francis, who was at the time a young Jesuit priest. In 1979, Borges spoke appreciatively and at some length about Bergoglio to the Argentine poet and essayist Roberto Alifano.

In 1967, Borges married the recently widowed Elsa Astete Millán. Friends believed that his mother, who was 90 and anticipating her own death, wanted to find someone to care for her blind son. The marriage lasted less than three years. After a legal separation, Borges moved back in with his mother, with whom he lived until her death at age 99. Thereafter, he lived alone in the small flat he had shared with her, cared for by Fanny, their housekeeper of many decades.

From 1975 until the time of his death, Borges traveled internationally. He was often accompanied in these travels by his personal assistant María Kodama, an Argentine woman of Japanese and German ancestry. In April 1986, a few months before his death, he married her via an attorney in Paraguay, in what was then a common practice among Argentines wishing to circumvent the Argentine laws of the time regarding divorce. According to Kodama, Borges drank as a young man, but eventually gave up alcohol as he aged and &quot;felt more secure.&quot; On his religious views, Borges declared himself an agnostic, clarifying: &quot;Being an agnostic means all things are possible, even God, even the Holy Trinity. This world is so strange that anything may happen, or may not happen.&quot; Borges was taught to read the Bible by his English Protestant grandmother and he prayed the Our Father each night because of a promise he made to his mother. He also died in the presence of a priest.

==Death==

During his final days in Geneva, Borges began brooding about the possibility of an afterlife. Although calm and collected about his own death, Borges began probing Kodama as to whether she inclined more towards the Shinto beliefs of her father or the Catholicism of her mother. Kodama &quot;had always regarded Borges as an Agnostic, as she was herself&quot;, but given the insistence of his questioning, she offered to call someone more &quot;qualified&quot;. Borges responded, &quot;You are asking me if I want a priest.&quot; He then instructed her to call two clergymen, a Catholic priest, in memory of his mother, and a Protestant minister, in memory of his English grandmother. He was visited first by Father Pierre Jacquet and by Pastor Edouard de Montmollin.

Borges died of liver cancer on 14 June 1986, aged 86, in Geneva. His burial was preceded by an ecumenical service at the Protestant Cathédrale de Saint Pierre on 18 June. With many Swiss and Argentine dignitaries present, Pastor de Montmollin read the First Chapter of St John&#x27;s Gospel. He then preached that &quot;Borges was a man who had unceasingly searched for the right word, the term that could sum up the whole, the final meaning of things.&quot; He said, however, that no man can reach that word through his own efforts and in trying becomes lost in a labyrinth. Pastor de Montmollin concluded, &quot;It is not man who discovers the word, it is the Word that comes to him.&quot;

Father Jacquet also preached, saying that, when visiting Borges before his death, he had found &quot;a man full of love, who received from the Church the forgiveness of his sins&quot;. After the funeral, Borges was laid to rest in Geneva&#x27;s Cimetière de Plainpalais. His grave, marked by a rough-hewn headstone, is adorned with carvings derived from Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse art and literature.

==Legacy==
Maria Kodama, his widow and heir on the basis of the marriage and two wills, gained control over his works. Her assertive administration of his estate resulted in a bitter dispute with the French publisher Gallimard regarding the republication of the complete works of Borges in French, with Pierre Assouline in &quot;Le Nouvel Observateur&quot; (August 2006) calling her &quot;an obstacle to the dissemination of the works of Borges&quot;. Kodama took legal action against Assouline, considering the remark unjustified and defamatory, asking for a symbolic compensation of one euro. Kodama also rescinded all publishing rights for existing collections of his work in English, including the translations by Norman Thomas di Giovanni, in which Borges himself collaborated, and from which di Giovanni would have received an unusually high fifty percent of the royalties. Kodama commissioned new translations by Andrew Hurley, which have become the official translations in English. At the time of her death, Kodama left no will and the status of the Borges estate is in limbo.

==Political opinions==
During the 1920s and 1930s, Borges was a vocal supporter of Hipólito Yrigoyen and the social democratic Radical Civic Union. In 1945, Borges signed a manifesto calling for an end to military rule and the establishment of political liberty and democratic elections. By the 1960s, he had grown more skeptical of democracy. During a 1971 conference at Columbia University, a creative writing student asked Borges what he regarded as &quot;a writer&#x27;s duty to his time&quot;. Borges replied, &quot;I think a writer&#x27;s duty is to be a writer, and if he can be a good writer, he is doing his duty. Besides, I think of my own opinions as being superficial. For example, I am a Conservative, I hate the Communists, I hate the Nazis, I hate the anti-Semites, and so on; but I don&#x27;t allow these opinions to find their way into my writings—except, of course, when I was greatly elated about the Six-Day War. Generally speaking, I think of keeping them in watertight compartments. Everybody knows my opinions, but as for my dreams and my stories, they should be allowed their full freedom, I think. I don&#x27;t want to intrude into them, I&#x27;m writing fiction, not fables.&quot; In the 1980s, towards the end of his life, Borges regained his earlier faith in democracy and held it out as the only hope for Argentina. In 1983, Borges applauded the election of the Radical Civic Union&#x27;s Raúl Alfonsín and welcomed the end of military rule with the following words: &quot;I once wrote that democracy is the abuse of statistics ... On October 30, 1983, Argentine democracy refuted me splendidly. Splendidly and resoundingly.&quot;

===Anti-communism===
Borges recurrently declared himself a &quot;Spencerian anarchist who believes in the individual and not in the State&quot; due to his father&#x27;s influence. In an interview with Richard Burgin during the late 1960s, Borges described himself as a &quot;mild&quot; adherent of classical liberalism. He further recalled that his opposition to communism and to Marxism was absorbed in his childhood, stating: &quot;Well, I have been brought up to think that the individual should be strong and the State should be weak. I couldn&#x27;t be enthusiastic about theories where the State is more important than the individual.&quot; After the overthrow via coup d&#x27;état of President Juan Domingo Perón in 1955, Borges supported efforts to purge Argentina&#x27;s Government of Peronists and dismantle the former President&#x27;s welfare state. He was enraged that the Communist Party of Argentina opposed these measures and sharply criticized them in lectures and in print. Borges&#x27;s opposition to the Party in this matter ultimately led to a permanent rift with his longtime lover, Argentine Communist Estela Canto.

In a 1956 interview given to &quot;El Hogar&quot;, Borges stated that &quot;[Communists] are in favor of totalitarian regimes and systematically combat freedom of thought, oblivious of the fact that the principal victims of dictatorships are, precisely, intelligence and culture.&quot; He elaborated: &quot;Many people are in favor of dictatorships because they allow them to avoid thinking for themselves. Everything is presented to them ready-made. There are even agencies of the State that supply them with opinions, passwords, slogans, and even idols to exalt or cast down according to the prevailing wind or in keeping with the directives of the thinking heads of the single party.&quot;

In later years, Borges frequently expressed contempt for Marxist and communist authors, poets, and intellectuals. In an interview with Burgin, Borges referred to Chilean poet Pablo Neruda as &quot;a very fine poet&quot; but a &quot;very mean man&quot; for unconditionally supporting the Soviet Union and demonizing the United States. Borges commented about Neruda, &quot;Now he knows that&#x27;s rubbish.&quot; In the same interview, Borges also criticized famed poet and playwright Federico García Lorca, who was abducted by Nationalist soldiers and executed without trial during the Spanish Civil War. In Borges&#x27;s opinion, Lorca&#x27;s poetry and plays, when examined against his tragic death, appeared better than they actually were.

===Anti-fascism===
In 1934, Argentine ultra-nationalists, sympathetic to Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party, asserted Borges was secretly Jewish and by implication not truly Argentinian. Borges responded with the essay &quot;Yo, Judío&quot; (&quot;I, a Jew&quot;), a reference to the old phrase &quot;Yo, Argentino&quot; (&quot;I, an Argentine&quot;) uttered by potential victims during pogroms against Argentine Jews to signify one was not Jewish. In the essay, Borges declares he would be proud to be a Jew, and remarks that any pure Castilian is likely to come from ancient Jewish descent, from a millennium ago. Both before and during the Second World War, Borges regularly published essays attacking the Nazi police state and its racist ideology. His outrage was fueled by his deep love for German literature. In an essay published in 1937, Borges attacked the Nazi Party&#x27;s use of children&#x27;s books to inflame antisemitism. He wrote, &quot;I don&#x27;t know if the world can do without German civilization, but I do know that its corruption by the teachings of hatred is a crime.&quot;

In a 1938 essay, Borges reviewed an anthology which rewrote German authors of the past to fit the Nazi party line. He was disgusted by what he described as Germany&#x27;s &quot;chaotic descent into darkness&quot; and the attendant rewriting of history. He argued that such books sacrificed the German people&#x27;s culture, history and integrity in the name of restoring their national honour. Such use of children&#x27;s books for propaganda he writes, &quot;perfect the criminal arts of barbarians.&quot; In a 1944 essay, Borges postulated,

In 1946, Borges published the short story &quot;Deutsches Requiem&quot;, which masquerades as the last testament of a condemned Nazi war criminal named Otto Dietrich zur Linde. In a 1971 conference at Columbia University, Borges was asked about the story by a student from the creative writing program. He recalled, &quot;When the Germans were defeated I felt great joy and relief, but at the same time I thought of the German defeat as being somehow tragic, because here we have perhaps the most educated people in Europe, who have a fine literature, a fine tradition of philosophy and poetry. Yet these people were bamboozled by a madman named Adolf Hitler, and I think there is tragedy there.&quot;

In a 1967 interview with Burgin, Borges recalled how his interactions with Argentina&#x27;s Nazi sympathisers led him to create the story. He recalled, &quot;And then I realized that those people that were on the side of Germany, that they never thought of German victories or the German glory. What they really liked was the idea of the Blitzkrieg, of London being on fire, of the country being destroyed. As to the German fighters, they took no stock in them. Then I thought, well now Germany has lost, now America has saved us from this nightmare, but since nobody can doubt on which side I stood, I&#x27;ll see what can be done from a literary point of view in favor of the Nazis. And then I created the ideal Nazi.&quot;

At Columbia University in 1971, Borges further elaborated on the story&#x27;s creation, &quot;I tried to imagine what a real Nazi might be like. I mean someone who thought of violence as being praiseworthy for its own sake. Then I thought that this archetype of the Nazis wouldn&#x27;t mind being defeated; after all, defeats and victories are mere matters of chance. He would still be glad of the fact, even if the Americans and British won the war. Naturally, when I am with Nazis, I find they are not my idea of what a Nazi is, but this wasn&#x27;t meant to be a political tract. It was meant to stand for the fact that there was something tragic in the fate of a real Nazi. Except that I wonder if a real Nazi ever existed. At least, when I went to Germany, I never met one. They were all feeling sorry for themselves and wanted me to feel sorry for them as well.&quot;

===Anti-Peronism===
In 1946, Argentine President Juan Perón began transforming Argentina into a one-party state with the assistance of his wife, Evita. Almost immediately, the spoils system was the rule of the day, as ideological critics of the ruling &quot;Partido Justicialista&quot; were fired from government jobs. During this period, Borges was informed that he was being &quot;promoted&quot; from his position at the Miguel Cané Library to a post as inspector of poultry and rabbits at the Buenos Aires municipal market. Upon demanding to know the reason, Borges was told, &quot;Well, you were on the side of the Allies, what do you expect?&quot; Borges resigned the following day. Perón&#x27;s treatment of Borges became a for the Argentine intelligentsia. The Argentine Society of Writers (SADE) held a formal dinner in his honour. At the dinner, a speech was read which Borges had written for the occasion. It said:

In the aftermath, Borges found himself much in demand as a lecturer and one of the intellectual leaders of the Argentine opposition. In 1951 he was asked by anti-Peronist friends to run for president of SADE. Borges, then having depression caused by a failed romance, reluctantly accepted. He later recalled that he would awake every morning and remember that Perón was president and feel deeply depressed and ashamed. Perón&#x27;s government had seized control of the Argentine mass media and regarded SADE with indifference. Borges later recalled, however, &quot;Many distinguished men of letters did not dare set foot inside its doors.&quot; Meanwhile, SADE became an increasing refuge for critics of the Perón government. SADE official Luisa Mercedes Levinson noted, &quot;We would gather every week to tell the latest jokes about the ruling couple and even dared to sing the songs of the French Resistance, as well as &#x27;La Marseillaise&#x27;&quot;.

After Evita Perón&#x27;s death on 26 July 1952, Borges received a visit from two policemen, who ordered him to put up two portraits of the ruling couple on the premises of SADE. Borges indignantly refused, calling it a ridiculous demand. The policemen replied that he would soon face the consequences. The Justicialist Party placed Borges under 24-hour surveillance and sent policemen to sit in on his lectures; in September they ordered SADE to be permanently closed down. Like much of the Argentine opposition to Perón, SADE had become marginalized due to persecution by the State, and very few active members remained. According to Edwin Williamson,

On 16 September 1955, General Pedro Eugenio Aramburu&#x27;s &quot;Revolución Libertadora&quot; toppled the ruling party and forced Perón into exile. Borges was overjoyed and joined demonstrators marching through the streets of Buenos Aires. According to Williamson, Borges shouted, &quot;Viva la Patria&quot;, until his voice grew hoarse. Due to the influence of Borges&#x27;s mother and his own role on the opposition to Peron, the provisional government appointed Borges as the Director of the National Library.

In his essay &quot;L&#x27;Illusion Comique&quot;, Borges wrote there were two histories of Peronism in Argentina. The first he described as &quot;the criminal one&quot;, composed of the police state tactics used against both real and imagined anti-Peronists. The second history was, according to Borges, &quot;the theatrical one&quot; composed of &quot;tales and fables made for consumption by dolts.&quot; He argued that, despite their claims to detest capitalism, Juan and Eva Perón &quot;copied its methods, dictating names and slogans to the people&quot; in the same way that multi-national corporations &quot;impose their razor blades, cigarettes, and washing machines.&quot; Borges then listed the numerous conspiracy theories the ruling couple dictated to their followers and how those theories were accepted without question. Borges concluded:

In a 1967 interview, Borges said, &quot;Perón was a humbug, and he knew it, and everybody knew it. But Perón could be very cruel. I mean, he had people tortured, killed. And his wife was a common prostitute.&quot; When Perón returned from exile in 1973 and regained the Presidency, Borges was enraged. In a 1975 interview for &quot;National Geographic&quot;, he said &quot;Damn, the snobs are back in the saddle. If their posters and slogans again defile the city, I&#x27;ll be glad I&#x27;ve lost my sight. Well, they can&#x27;t humiliate me as they did before my books sold well.&quot;

After being accused of being unforgiving, Borges quipped, &quot;I resented Perón&#x27;s making Argentina look ridiculous to the world ... as in 1951, when he announced control over thermonuclear fusion, which still hasn&#x27;t happened anywhere but in the sun and the stars. For a time, Argentines hesitated to wear band aids for fear friends would ask, &#x27;Did the atomic bomb go off in your hand?&#x27; A shame, because Argentina really has world-class scientists.&quot; After Borges&#x27;s death in 1986, the Peronist &quot;Partido Justicialista&quot; declined to send a delegate to the writer&#x27;s memorial service in Buenos Aires. A spokesman for the Party said that this was in reaction to &quot;certain declarations he had made about the country.&quot; Later, at the City Council of Buenos Aires, Peronist politicians refused to honor Borges as an Argentine, commenting that he &quot;chose to die abroad.&quot; When infuriated politicians from the other parties demanded to know the real reason, the Peronists finally explained that Borges had made statements about Evita Perón which they called &quot;unacceptable&quot;.

===Military junta===
During the 1970s, Borges at first expressed support for Argentina&#x27;s military junta, but was scandalized by the junta&#x27;s actions during the Dirty War. In protest against their support of the regime, Borges ceased publishing in the newspaper &quot;La Nación&quot;. In 1985, he wrote a short poem about the Falklands War called &quot;Juan López y John Ward&quot;, about two fictional soldiers (one from each side), who died in the Falklands, in which he refers to &quot;islands that were too famous&quot;. He also said about the war: &quot;The Falklands thing was a fight between two bald men over a comb.&quot;

Borges was an observer at the trials of the military junta in 1985 and wrote that &quot;not to judge and condemn the crimes would be to encourage impunity and to become, somehow, its accomplice.&quot; Borges added that &quot;the news of the missing people, the crimes and atrocities [the military] committed&quot; had inspired him to return to his earlier Emersonian faith in democracy.

===Indigenous cultures===

Borges believed that indigenous peoples in what is now called Argentina had no traditions: &quot;There&#x27;s no native tradition of any kind since the Indians here were mere barbarians. We have to fall back on the European tradition, why not? It&#x27;s a very fine tradition.&quot;

==Works==

Wardrip-Fruin and Montfort argue that Borges &quot;may have been the most important figure in Spanish-language literature since Cervantes. He was clearly of tremendous influence, writing intricate poems, short stories, and essays that instantiated concepts of dizzying power.&quot; Borges&#x27;s work has been compared to that of Homer and Milton. Indeed, the critic Harold Bloom numbers Borges among the key figures of the Western literary canon.

In addition to short stories for which he is most noted, Borges also wrote poetry, essays, screenplays, and literary criticism, and edited numerous anthologies. His longest work of fiction is a fourteen-page story, &quot;The Congress&quot;, first published in 1971. His late-onset blindness strongly influenced his later writing. Borges wrote: &quot;When I think of what I&#x27;ve lost, I ask, &#x27;Who know themselves better than the blind?&#x27; – for every thought becomes a tool.&quot; Paramount among his intellectual interests are elements of mythology, mathematics, theology, integrating these through literature, sometimes playfully, sometimes with great seriousness.

Borges composed poetry throughout his life. As his eyesight waned (it came and went, with a struggle between advancing age and advances in eye surgery), he increasingly focused on writing poetry, since he could memorize an entire work in progress. His poems embrace the same wide range of interests as his fiction, along with issues that emerge in his critical works and translations, and from more personal musings. For example, his interest in idealism runs through his work, reflected in the fictional world of Tlön in &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot; and in his essay &quot;A New Refutation of Time&quot;.

===Translations by Borges===
Borges was a notable translator. He translated works of literature in English, French, German, Old English, and Old Norse into Spanish. His first publication, for a Buenos Aires newspaper, was a translation of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s story &quot;The Happy Prince&quot; into Spanish when he was nine. At the end of his life he produced a Spanish-language version of a part of Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot;. He also translated (while simultaneously subtly transforming) the works of, among others, Ambrose Bierce, William Faulkner, André Gide, Hermann Hesse, Franz Kafka, Rudyard Kipling, Edgar Allan Poe, Walt Whitman, and Virginia Woolf. Borges wrote and lectured extensively on the art of translation, holding that a translation may improve upon the original, may even be unfaithful to it, and that alternative and potentially contradictory renderings of the same work can be equally valid. Borges employed the devices of literary forgery and the review of an imaginary work, both forms of modern pseudo-epigrapha.

===Hoaxes and forgeries===
Borges&#x27;s best-known set of literary forgeries date from his early work as a translator and literary critic with a regular column in the Argentine magazine &quot;El Hogar&quot;. Along with publishing numerous legitimate translations, he also published original works, for example, in the style of Emanuel Swedenborg or &quot; One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, originally claiming them to be translations of works he had chanced upon. In another case, he added three short, falsely attributed pieces into his otherwise legitimate and carefully researched anthology &quot;El matrero&quot;. Several of these are gathered in &quot;A Universal History of Infamy&quot;. While Borges was the great popularizer of the review of an imaginary work, he had developed the idea from Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot;, a book-length review of a non-existent German transcendentalist work, and the biography of its equally non-existent author. In &quot;This Craft of Verse&quot;, Borges says that in 1916 in Geneva &quot;[I] discovered, and was overwhelmed by, Thomas Carlyle. I read &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot;, and I can recall many of its pages; I know them by heart.&quot;

In the introduction to his first published volume of fiction, &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot;, Borges remarks, &quot;It is a laborious madness and an impoverishing one, the madness of composing vast books, setting out in five hundred pages an idea that can be perfectly related orally in five minutes. The better way to go about it is to pretend that those books already exist, and offer a summary, a commentary on them.&quot; He then cites both &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot; and Samuel Butler&#x27;s &quot;The Fair Haven&quot;, remarking, however, that &quot;those works suffer under the imperfection that they themselves are books, and not a whit less tautological than the others. A more reasonable, more inept, and more lazy man, I have chosen to write &quot;notes&quot; on imaginary books.&quot; On the other hand, some works were wrongly attributed to Borges, like the poem &quot;Instantes&quot;.

===Criticism of Borges&#x27;s work===

Borges&#x27;s change in style from regionalist &quot;criollismo&quot; to a more cosmopolitan style brought him much criticism from journals such as &quot;Contorno&quot;, a leftist, Sartre-influenced Argentine publication founded by David Viñas and his brother, along with other intellectuals such as Noé Jitrik and Adolfo Prieto. In the post-Peronist Argentina of the early 1960s, &quot;Contorno&quot; met with wide approval from the youth who challenged the authenticity of older writers such as Borges and questioned their legacy of experimentation. Magic realism and exploration of universal truths, they argued, had come at the cost of responsibility and seriousness in the face of society&#x27;s problems. The &quot;Contorno&quot; writers acknowledged Borges and Eduardo Mallea for being &quot;doctors of technique&quot; but argued that their work lacked substance due to their lack of interaction with the reality that they inhabited, an existentialist critique of their refusal to embrace existence and reality in their artwork.

===Sexuality and perception of women===
The story &quot;The Sect of the Phoenix&quot; is famously interpreted to allude to the ubiquity of sexual intercourse among humans – a concept whose essential qualities the narrator of the story is not able to relate to. With a few notable exceptions, women are almost entirely absent from Borges&#x27;s fiction. However, there are some instances in Borges&#x27;s later writings of romantic love, for example the story &quot;Ulrikke&quot; from &quot;The Book of Sand&quot;. The protagonist of the story &quot;El muerto&quot; also lusts after the &quot;splendid, contemptuous, red-haired woman&quot; of Azevedo Bandeira and later &quot;sleeps with the woman with shining hair&quot;. Although they do not appear in the stories, women are significantly discussed as objects of unrequited love in his short stories &quot;The Zahir&quot; and &quot;The Aleph&quot;. The plot of &quot;La Intrusa&quot; was based on a true story of two friends. Borges turned their fictional counterparts into brothers, excluding the possibility of a homosexual relationship.

&quot;Emma Zunz&quot; is a story with an eminent female protagonist. Originally published in 1948, this work tells the tale of a young Jewish woman who kills a man in order to avenge the disgrace and suicide of her father. She carefully plans the crime, submitting to an unpleasant sexual encounter with a stranger in order to create the appearance of sexual impropriety in her intended victim. Despite the fact that she premeditates and executes a murder, the eponymous heroine of this story is surprisingly likable, both because of intrinsic qualities in the character (interestingly enough, she believes in nonviolence) and because the story is narrated from a &quot;remote but sympathetic&quot; point of view that highlights the poignancy of her situation.

===Nobel Prize omission===
Borges was never awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, something which continually distressed the writer. He was one of several distinguished authors who never received the honour. Borges commented, &quot;Not granting me the Nobel Prize has become a Scandinavian tradition; since I was born they have not been granting it to me.&quot; Some observers speculated that Borges did not receive the award in his later life because of his conservative political views, or more specifically because he had accepted an honour from Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.

Borges was among the short-listed candidates several times. In 1965 he was considered along with Vladimir Nabokov, Pablo Neruda, and Mikhail Sholokhov, and in 1966 a shared prize to Borges and Miguel Ángel Asturias was proposed. Borges was nominated again in 1967, and was among the final three choices considered by the committee according to Nobel records unsealed on the 50th anniversary in 2017. The committee considered Borges, Graham Greene and Miguel Ángel Asturias, choosing Asturias as the winner.

==Fact, fantasy and non-linearity==

Many of Borges&#x27;s best-known stories deal with themes of time (&quot;The Secret Miracle&quot;), infinity (&quot;The Aleph&quot;), mirrors (&quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot;) and labyrinths (&quot;The Two Kings and the Two Labyrinths&quot;, &quot;The House of Asterion&quot;, &quot;The Immortal&quot;, and &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot;). Williamson writes, &quot;His basic contention was that fiction did not depend on the illusion of reality; what mattered ultimately was an author&#x27;s ability to generate &#x27;poetic faith&#x27; in his reader.&quot;

His stories often have fantastical themes, such as a library containing every possible 410-page text (&quot;The Library of Babel&quot;), a man who forgets nothing he experiences (&quot;Funes, the Memorious&quot;), an artifact through which the user can see everything in the universe (&quot;The Aleph&quot;), and a year of still time given to a man standing before a firing squad (&quot;The Secret Miracle&quot;). Borges told realistic stories of South American life, of folk heroes, street fighters, soldiers, gauchos, detectives, and historical figures. He mixed the real and the fantastic, fact with fiction. His interest in compounding fantasy, philosophy, and the art of translation are evident in articles such as &quot;The Translators of &quot;The Book of One Thousand and One Nights&quot;&quot;. In the &quot;Book of Imaginary Beings&quot;, a thoroughly researched bestiary of mythical creatures, Borges wrote, &quot;There is a kind of lazy pleasure in useless and out-of-the-way erudition.&quot; Borges&#x27;s interest in fantasy was shared by Bioy Casares, with whom he coauthored several collections of tales between 1942 and 1967.

Often, especially early in his career, the mixture of fact and fantasy crossed the line into the realm of hoax or literary forgery. &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot; (1941) presents the idea of forking paths through networks of time, none of which is the same, all of which are equal. Borges uses the recurring image of &quot;a labyrinth that folds back upon itself in infinite regression&quot; so we &quot;become aware of all the possible choices we might make.&quot; The forking paths have branches to represent these choices that ultimately lead to different endings. Borges saw man&#x27;s search for meaning in a seemingly infinite universe as fruitless and instead uses the maze as a riddle for time, not space. He examined the themes of universal randomness (&quot;The Lottery in Babylon&quot;) and madness (&quot;The Zahir&quot;). Due to the success of the &quot;Forking Paths&quot; story, the term &quot;Borgesian&quot; came to reflect a quality of narrative non-linearity.

=== Borges and science fiction ===
John Clute writes: &quot;as was earlier the case with Franz Kafka, a collection of whose work he translated as &quot;La Metamorfosis&quot; (coll. 1938), Borges&#x27;s influence on twentieth century literature worldwide has been so deep and pervasive that any sf written in English since about 1960 may consciously or subliminally reflect his work. Any sf story whose structure or arguments question or play with the nature of reality – or which makes fantastic use of images of the Labyrinth, the Mirror, the Library, the Map, and/or the Book and/or the Dream to inform the world – will necessarily navigate seas of imagination he has already plumbed, apodictically, in ten or twenty short stories.&quot; Clute notes that Borges &quot;revealed a first-hand (if at points inaccurate) knowledge of sf and its authors, including H. P. Lovecraft, Robert A Heinlein, A. E. van Vogt and Ray Bradbury&quot; and cites Philip K. Dick, Thomas Pynchon, Kurt Vonnegut and Gene Wolfe as being directly influenced by Borges. 

William Gibson recalls &quot;the sensation, both complex and eerily simple&quot;, of reading &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot; in &quot;Labyrinths&quot; as a young man, seated at a writing desk said to have belonged to Francis Marion: Had the concept of software been available to me, I imagine I would have felt as though I were installing something that exponentially increased what one day would be called bandwidth, though bandwidth of &quot;what&quot;, exactly, I remain unable to say. This sublime and cosmically comic fable of utterly pure information (i.e. the utterly fictive) gradually and relentlessly infiltrating and eventually consuming the quotidian, opened something within me which has never yet closed... Works we all our lives recall reading for the first time are among the truest milestones, but &quot;Labyrinths&quot; was a profoundly singular one, for me, and I believe I knew that, then, in my early adolescence. It was demonstrated to me, that afternoon. Proven. For, by the time I had finished with &quot;Tlön&quot; (though one never finishes with Tlön, nor indeed any story by Borges) and had traversed &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot; and had wondered, literally bug-eyed, at &quot;Pierre Menaud, Author of the &quot;Quixote&quot;&quot;, I discovered that I had ceased to be afraid of any influence that might dwell within Francis Marion&#x27;s towering desk.&quot;

===Borgesian conundrum===
The philosophical term &quot;Borgesian conundrum&quot; is named after him and has been defined as the ontological question of &quot;whether the writer writes the story, or it writes him.&quot; The original concept was put forward by Borges in his essay &quot;Kafka and His Precursors&quot;. After reviewing works that were written before those of Kafka, Borges wrote:

==Culture and Argentine literature==
===&quot;Martín Fierro&quot; and Argentine tradition===

Along with other young Argentine writers of his generation, Borges initially rallied around the fictional character of Martín Fierro. &quot;Martín Fierro&quot;, a poem by José Hernández, was a dominant work of 19th-century Argentine literature. Its eponymous hero became a symbol of Argentine sensibility, untied from European values – a gaucho, free, poor, &quot;pampas&quot;-dwelling. The character Fierro is illegally drafted to serve at a border fort to defend it against the indigenous population but ultimately deserts to become a &quot;gaucho matrero&quot;, the Argentine equivalent of a North American western outlaw. Borges contributed keenly to the avant garde &quot;Martín Fierro&quot; magazine in the early 1920s.

As Borges matured, he came to a more nuanced attitude toward the Hernández poem. In his book of essays on the poem, Borges separates his admiration for the aesthetic virtues of the work from his mixed opinion of the moral virtues of its protagonist. In his essay &quot;The Argentine Writer and Tradition&quot; (1951), Borges celebrates how Hernández expresses the Argentine character. In a key scene in the poem, Martín Fierro and El Moreno compete by improvising songs on universal themes such as time, night, and the sea, reflecting the real-world gaucho tradition of &quot;payadas&quot;, improvised musical dialogues on philosophical themes. Borges points out that Hernández evidently knew the difference between actual gaucho tradition of composing poetry versus the &quot;gauchesque&quot; fashion among Buenos Aires literati.

In his works he refutes the arch-nationalist interpreters of the poem and disdains others, such as critic Eleuterio Tiscornia, for their Europeanising approach. Borges denies that Argentine literature should distinguish itself by limiting itself to &quot;local colour&quot;, which he equates with cultural nationalism. Racine and Shakespeare&#x27;s work, he says, looked beyond their countries&#x27; borders. Neither, he argues, need the literature be bound to the heritage of old-world Spanish or European tradition. Nor should it define itself by the conscious rejection of its colonial past. He asserts that Argentine writers need to be free to define Argentine literature anew, writing about Argentina and the world from the point of view of those who have inherited the whole of world literature. Williamson says &quot;Borges&#x27;s main argument is that the very fact of writing from the margins provides Argentine writers with a special opportunity to innovate without being bound to the canons of the centre, ... at once a part of and apart from the centre, which gives them much potential freedom&quot;.

===Argentine culture===
Borges focused on universal themes, but also composed a substantial body of literature on themes from Argentine folklore and history. His first book, the poetry collection &quot;Fervor de Buenos Aires&quot; (&quot;Passion for Buenos Aires&quot;), appeared in 1923. Borges&#x27;s writings on things Argentine include Argentine culture (&quot;History of the Tango&quot;; &quot;Inscriptions on Horse Wagons&quot;), folklore (&quot;Juan Muraña&quot;, &quot;Night of the Gifts&quot;), literature (&quot;The Argentine Writer and Tradition&quot;, &quot;Almafuerte&quot;; &quot;Evaristo Carriego&quot;), and national concerns (&quot;Celebration of the Monster&quot;, &quot;Hurry, Hurry&quot;, &quot;The Mountebank&quot;, &quot;Pedro Salvadores&quot;). Ultranationalists, however, continued to question his Argentine identity. Borges&#x27;s interest in Argentine themes reflects in part the inspiration of his family tree. Borges had an English paternal grandmother who, around 1870, married the &quot;criollo&quot; Francisco Borges, a man with a military command and a historic role in the Argentine Civil Wars in what are now Argentina and Uruguay.

Spurred by pride in his family&#x27;s heritage, Borges often used those civil wars as settings in fiction and quasi-fiction (for example, &quot;The Life of Tadeo Isidoro Cruz&quot;, &quot;The Dead Man&quot;, &quot;Avelino Arredondo&quot;) as well as poetry (&quot;General Quiroga Rides to His Death in a Carriage&quot;). Borges&#x27;s maternal great-grandfather, Manuel Isidoro Suárez, was another military hero, whom Borges immortalized in the poem &quot;A Page to Commemorate Colonel Suárez, Victor at Junín&quot;.

His nonfiction explores many of the themes found in his fiction. Essays such as &quot;The History of the Tango&quot; or his writings on the epic poem &quot;Martín Fierro&quot; explore Argentine themes, such as the identity of the Argentine people and of various Argentine subcultures. The varying genealogies of characters, settings, and themes in his stories, such as &quot;La muerte y la brújula&quot;, used Argentine models without pandering to his readers or framing Argentine culture as &quot;exotic&quot;.

In fact, contrary to what is usually supposed, the geographies found in his fictions often do not correspond to those of real-world Argentina. In his essay &quot;El escritor argentino y la tradición&quot;, Borges notes that the very absence of camels in the Qur&#x27;an was proof enough that it was an Arabian work, despite the fact that camels are mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an. He suggested that only someone trying to write an &quot;Arab&quot; work would purposefully include a camel. He uses this example to illustrate how his dialogue with universal existential concerns was just as Argentine as writing about gauchos and tangos. Borges detested football.

===Multicultural influences===
At the time of the Argentine Declaration of Independence in 1816, the population was predominantly &quot;criollo&quot; (of Spanish ancestry). From the mid-1850s on, waves of immigration from Europe, especially Italy and Spain, arrived in the country, and in the following decades the Argentine national identity diversified. Borges was writing in a strongly European literary context, immersed in Spanish, English, French, German, Italian, Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse literature. He also read translations of Near Eastern and Far Eastern works. Borges&#x27;s writing is also informed by scholarship of Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, and Judaism, including prominent religious figures, heretics, and mystics. Religion and heresy are explored in such stories as &quot;Averroes&#x27;s Search&quot;, &quot;The Writing of the God&quot;, &quot;The Theologians&quot;, and &quot;Three Versions of Judas&quot;. The curious inversion of mainstream Christian concepts of redemption in the last story is characteristic of Borges&#x27;s approach to theology in his literature. In describing himself, Borges said, &quot;I am not sure that I exist, actually. I am all the writers that I have read, all the people that I have met, all the women that I have loved; all the cities that I have visited, all my ancestors.&quot; As a young man, he visited the frontier &quot;pampas&quot; which extend beyond Argentina into Uruguay and Brazil. Borges said that his father wished him &quot;to become a citizen of the world, a great cosmopolitan,&quot; in the way of Henry and William James.

Borges lived and studied in Switzerland and Spain as a young student. As Borges matured, he traveled through Argentina as a lecturer and, internationally, as a visiting professor; he continued to tour the world as he grew older, finally settling in Geneva, where he had spent some of his youth. Drawing on the influence of many times and places, Borges&#x27;s work belittled nationalism and racism. However, Borges also scorned his own Basque ancestry and criticised the abolition of slavery in America because he believed black people were happier remaining uneducated and without freedom. Portraits of diverse coexisting cultures characteristic of Argentina are especially pronounced in the book &quot;Six Problems for don Isidoro Parodi&quot; (co-authored with Bioy Casares) and &quot;Death and the Compass&quot;. Borges wrote that he considered Mexican writer Alfonso Reyes to be &quot;the best prose-writer in the Spanish language of any time.&quot; Borges was also an admirer of Asian culture, e.g. the ancient Chinese board game of Go, about which he penned some verses, while &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot; had a strong Chinese theme.

==Influences==
===Modernism===
Borges was rooted in the Modernism predominant in its early years and was influenced by Symbolism. Like Vladimir Nabokov and James Joyce, he combined an interest in his native culture with broader perspectives, also sharing their multilingualism and inventiveness with language. However, while Nabokov and Joyce tended toward progressively larger works, Borges remained a miniaturist. His work progressed &quot;away&quot; from what he referred to as &quot;the baroque&quot;: his later style is far more transparent and naturalistic than his earlier works. Borges represented the humanist view of media that stressed the social aspect of art driven by emotion. If art represented the tool, then Borges was more interested in how the tool could be used to relate to people.

Existentialism saw its apogee during the years of Borges&#x27;s greatest artistic production. It has been argued that his choice of topics largely ignored existentialism&#x27;s central tenets. Critic Paul de Man notes, &quot;Whatever Borges&#x27;s existential anxieties may be, they have little in common with Sartre&#x27;s robustly prosaic view of literature, with the earnestness of Camus&#x27; moralism, or with the weighty profundity of German existential thought. Rather, they are the consistent expansion of a purely poetic consciousness to its furthest limits.&quot;

===Mathematics===

The essay collection &quot;Borges y la Matemática&quot; (Borges and Mathematics, 2003) by Argentine mathematician and writer Guillermo Martínez outlines how Borges used concepts from mathematics in his work. Martínez states that Borges had, for example, at least a superficial knowledge of set theory, which he handles with elegance in stories such as &quot;The Book of Sand&quot;. Other books such as &quot;The Unimaginable Mathematics of Borges&#x27; Library of Babel&quot; by William Goldbloom Bloch (2008) and &quot;Unthinking Thinking: Jorge Luis Borges, Mathematics, and the New Physics&quot; by Floyd Merrell (1991) also explore this relationship.

===Philosophy===
Fritz Mauthner, philosopher of language and author of the &quot;Wörterbuch der Philosophie&quot; (&quot;Dictionary of Philosophy&quot;), had an important influence on Borges. Borges always recognized the influence of this German philosopher. According to the literary review &quot;Sur&quot;, the book was one of the five books most noted and read by Borges. The first time that Borges mentioned Mauthner was in 1928 in his book &quot;The language of the Argentines&quot; (El idioma de los argentinos). In a 1962 interview Borges described Mauthner as possessing a fine sense of humor as well as great knowledge and erudition.

In an interview, Denis Dutton asked Borges who were the &quot;philosophers who have influenced your works, in whom you&#x27;ve been the most interested&quot;. In reply, Borges named Berkeley and Schopenhauer. He was also influenced by Spinoza, about whom Borges wrote a famous poem. It is not without humour that Borges once wrote: &quot;Siempre imaginé que el Paraíso sería algún tipo de biblioteca.&quot; (&quot;I always imagined Paradise to be some kind of a library.&quot;)

<text>Jane Austen ( ; 16 December 1775 – 18 July 1817) was an English novelist known primarily for her six novels, which implicitly interpret, critique, and comment on the English landed gentry at the end of the 18th century. Austen&#x27;s plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage for the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. Her works are implicit critiques of the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism. Her use of social commentary, realism, wit, and irony have earned her acclaim amongst critics and scholars.

The anonymously published &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; (1811), &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1813), &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; (1814), and &quot;Emma&quot; (1816) were modest successes, but they brought her little fame in her lifetime. She wrote two other novels—&quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; and &quot;Persuasion&quot;, both published posthumously in 1817—and began another, eventually titled &quot;Sanditon&quot;, but it was left unfinished on her death. She also left behind three volumes of juvenile writings in manuscript, the short epistolary novel &quot;Lady Susan&quot;, and the unfinished novel &quot;The Watsons&quot;.

Since her death Austen&#x27;s novels have rarely been out of print. A significant transition in her reputation occurred in 1833, when they were republished in Richard Bentley&#x27;s Standard Novels series (illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering and sold as a set). They gradually gained wide acclaim and popular readership. In 1869, her nephew published &quot;A Memoir of Jane Austen&quot;. Her work has inspired a large number of critical essays and has been included in many literary anthologies. Her novels have been adapted in numerous films including &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; (1995), &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot; (2005), &quot;Emma&quot; (2020), and an adaptation of &quot;Lady Susan&quot;, &quot;Love &amp; Friendship&quot; (2016), as well as the BBC film &quot;Persuasion&quot; (1995), and BBC miniseries &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1995).

==Biographical sources==
The scant biographical information about Austen comes from her few surviving letters and sketches her family members wrote about her. Only about 160 of the approximately 3,000 letters Austen wrote have survived and been published. Cassandra Austen destroyed the bulk of the letters she received from her sister, burning or otherwise destroying them. She wanted to ensure that the &quot;younger nieces did not read any of Jane&#x27;s sometimes acid or forthright comments on neighbours or family members&quot;. In the interest of protecting reputations from Jane&#x27;s penchant for honesty and forthrightness, Cassandra omitted details of illnesses, unhappiness and anything she considered unsavoury. Important details about the Austen family were elided by intention, such as any mention of Austen&#x27;s brother George, whose undiagnosed developmental challenges led the family to send him away from home; the two brothers sent away to the navy at an early age; or wealthy Aunt Leigh-Perrot, arrested and tried on charges of larceny.

The first Austen biography was Henry Thomas Austen&#x27;s 1818 &quot;Biographical Notice&quot;. It appeared in a posthumous edition of &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; and included extracts from two letters, against the judgement of other family members. Details of Austen&#x27;s life continued to be omitted or embellished in her nephew&#x27;s &quot;A Memoir of Jane Austen&quot;, published in 1869, and in William and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh&#x27;s biography &quot;Jane Austen: Her Life and Letters&quot;, published in 1913, all of which included additional letters. Austen&#x27;s family and relatives built a legend of &quot;good quiet Aunt Jane&quot;, portraying her as a woman in a happy domestic situation, whose family was the mainstay of her life. Modern biographers include details excised from the letters and family biographies, but the biographer Jan Fergus writes that the challenge is to keep the view balanced, not to present her languishing in periods of deep unhappiness as &quot;an embittered, disappointed woman trapped in a thoroughly unpleasant family&quot;.

==Life==
===Family===

Jane Austen was born in Steventon, Hampshire on 16 December 1775. Her father wrote of her arrival in a letter that her mother &quot;certainly expected to have been brought to bed a month ago&quot;. He added that the newborn infant was &quot;a present plaything for Cassy and a future companion&quot;. The winter of 1775-1776 was particularly harsh and it was not until 5 April that she was baptised at the local church and christened Jane.

Her father, George Austen (1731–1805), served as the rector of the Anglican parishes of Steventon and Deane. The Reverend Austen came from an old and wealthy family of wool merchants. As each generation of eldest sons received inheritances, George&#x27;s branch of the family fell into poverty. He and his two sisters were orphaned as children and had to be taken in by relatives. In 1745, at the age of fifteen, George Austen&#x27;s sister Philadelphia was apprenticed to a milliner in Covent Garden. At the age of sixteen, George entered St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he most likely met Cassandra Leigh (1739–1827). She came from the prominent Leigh family. Her father was rector at All Souls College, Oxford, where she grew up among the gentry. Her eldest brother James inherited a fortune and large estate from his great-aunt Perrot, with the only condition that he change his name to Leigh-Perrot.

George Austen and Cassandra Leigh were engaged, probably around 1763, when they exchanged miniatures. He received the living of the Steventon parish from Thomas Knight, the wealthy husband of his second cousin. They married on 26 April 1764 at St Swithin&#x27;s Church in Bath, by license, in a simple ceremony, two months after Cassandra&#x27;s father died. Their income was modest, with George&#x27;s small &quot;per annum&quot; living; Cassandra brought to the marriage the expectation of a small inheritance at the time of her mother&#x27;s death.

After the living at the nearby Deane rectory had been purchased for George by his wealthy uncle Francis Austen, the Austens took up temporary residence there, until Steventon rectory, a 16th-century house in disrepair, underwent necessary renovations. Cassandra gave birth to three children while living at Deane: James in 1765, George in 1766, and Edward in 1767. Her custom was to keep an infant at home for several months and then place it with Elizabeth Littlewood, a woman living nearby to nurse and raise for twelve to eighteen months.

===Steventon===
In 1768, the family finally took up residence in Steventon. Henry was the first child to be born there, in 1771. At about this time, Cassandra could no longer ignore the signs that little George was developmentally disabled. He had seizures and may have been deaf and mute. At this time she chose to send him to be fostered. In 1773, Cassandra was born, followed by Francis in 1774, and Jane in 1775.

According to the biographer Park Honan, the Austen home had an &quot;open, amused, easy intellectual atmosphere&quot;, in which the ideas of those with whom members of the Austen family might disagree politically or socially were considered and discussed.

The family relied on the patronage of their kin and hosted visits from numerous family members. Mrs Austen spent the summer of 1770 in London with George&#x27;s sister, Philadelphia, and her daughter Eliza, accompanied by his other sister, Mrs. Walter and her daughter Philly. Philadelphia and Eliza Hancock were, according to Le Faye, &quot;the bright comets flashing into an otherwise placid solar system of clerical life in rural Hampshire, and the news of their foreign travels and fashionable London life, together with their sudden descents upon the Steventon household in between times, all helped to widen Jane&#x27;s youthful horizon and influence her later life and works.&quot;

Cassandra Austen&#x27;s cousin Thomas Leigh visited a number of times in the 1770s and 1780s, inviting young Cassie to visit them in Bath in 1781. The first mention of Jane occurs in family documents upon her return, &quot;... and almost home they were when they met Jane &amp; Charles, the two little ones of the family, who had to go as far as New Down to meet the chaise, &amp; have the pleasure of riding home in it.&quot; Le Faye writes that &quot;Mr Austen&#x27;s predictions for his younger daughter were fully justified. Never were sisters more to each other than Cassandra and Jane; while in a particularly affectionate family, there seems to have been a special link between Cassandra and Edward on the one hand, and between Henry and Jane on the other.&quot;

From 1773 until 1796, George Austen supplemented his income by farming and by teaching three or four boys at a time, who boarded at his home. The Reverend Austen had an annual income of £200 () from his two livings. This was a very modest income at the time; by comparison, a skilled worker like a blacksmith or a carpenter could make about £100 annually while the typical annual income of a gentry family was between £1,000 and £5,000. Mr. Austen also rented the 200-acre Cheesedown farm from his benefactor Thomas Knight which could make a profit of £300 () a year.

During this period of her life, Jane Austen attended church regularly, socialised with friends and neighbours, and read novels—often of her own composition—aloud to her family in the evenings. Socialising with the neighbours often meant dancing, either impromptu in someone&#x27;s home after supper or at the balls held regularly at the assembly rooms in the town hall. Her brother Henry later said that &quot;Jane was fond of dancing, and excelled in it&quot;.

===Education===
In 1783 Austen and her sister Cassandra were sent to Oxford to be educated by Ann Cawley, who took them to Southampton later that year. That autumn both girls were sent home after catching typhus, of which Jane nearly died. She was from then home-educated, until she attended boarding school with her sister from early in 1785 at the Reading Abbey Girls&#x27; School, ruled by Mrs La Tournelle. The curriculum probably included French, spelling, needlework, dancing, music and drama. The sisters returned home before December 1786 because the school fees for the two girls were too high for the Austen family. After 1786 Austen &quot;never again lived anywhere beyond the bounds of her immediate family environment&quot;.

Her education came from reading, guided by her father and brothers James and Henry. Irene Collins said that Austen &quot;used some of the same school books as the boys&quot;. Austen apparently had unfettered access both to her father&#x27;s library and that of a family friend, Warren Hastings. Together these collections amounted to a large and varied library. Her father was also tolerant of Austen&#x27;s sometimes risqué experiments in writing, and provided both sisters with expensive paper and other materials for their writing and drawing.

Private theatricals were an essential part of Austen&#x27;s education. From her early childhood, the family and friends staged a series of plays in the rectory barn, including Richard Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The Rivals&quot; (1775) and David Garrick&#x27;s &quot;Bon Ton&quot;. Austen&#x27;s eldest brother James wrote the prologues and epilogues and she probably joined in these activities, first as a spectator and later as a participant. Most of the plays were comedies, which suggests how Austen&#x27;s satirical gifts were cultivated. At the age of 12, she tried her own hand at dramatic writing; she wrote three short plays during her teenage years.

===&quot;Juvenilia&quot; (1787–1793)===

From at least the time she was aged eleven, Austen wrote poems and stories to amuse herself and her family. She exaggerated mundane details of daily life and parodied common plot devices in &quot;stories [] full of anarchic fantasies of female power, licence, illicit behaviour, and general high spirits&quot;, according to Janet Todd. Containing work written between 1787 and 1793, the juvenilia (or childhood writings) that Austen compiled fair copies consisted of twenty-nine early works into three bound notebooks, now referred to as the &quot;Juvenilia&quot;. She called the three notebooks &quot;Volume the First&quot;, &quot;Volume the Second&quot; and &quot;Volume the Third&quot;, and they preserve 90,000 words she wrote during those years. The &quot;Juvenilia&quot; are often, according to scholar Richard Jenkyns, &quot;boisterous&quot; and &quot;anarchic&quot;; he compares them to the work of 18th-century novelist Laurence Sterne.

Among these works is a satirical novel in letters titled &quot;Love and Freindship&quot; , written when aged fourteen in 1790, in which she mocked popular novels of sensibility. The next year, she wrote &quot;The History of England&quot;, a manuscript of thirty-four pages accompanied by thirteen watercolour miniatures by her sister, Cassandra. Austen&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; parodied popular historical writing, particularly Oliver Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;History of England&quot; (1764). Honan speculates that not long after writing &quot;Love and Freindship&quot;, Austen decided to &quot;write for profit, to make stories her central effort&quot;, that is, to become a professional writer. When she was around eighteen years old, Austen began to write longer, more sophisticated works.

In August 1792, aged seventeen, Austen started &quot;Catharine or the Bower&quot;, which presaged her mature work, especially &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;, but was left unfinished until picked up in &quot;Lady Susan&quot;, which Todd describes as less prefiguring than &quot;Catharine&quot;. A year later she began, but abandoned, a short play, later titled &quot;Sir Charles Grandison or the happy Man, a comedy in 6 acts&quot;, which she returned to and completed around 1800. This was a short parody of various school textbook abridgements of Austen&#x27;s favourite contemporary novel, &quot;The History of Sir Charles Grandison&quot; (1753), by Samuel Richardson.
When Austen became an aunt for the first time aged eighteen, she sent new-born niece Fanny Catherine Austen Knight &quot;five short pieces of ... the Juvenilia now known collectively as &#x27;Scraps&#x27; .., purporting to be her &#x27;Opinions and Admonitions on the conduct of Young Women. For Jane-Anna-Elizabeth Austen (also born in 1793), her aunt wrote &quot;two more &#x27;Miscellanious Morsels&#x27;, dedicating them to [Anna] on 2 June 1793, &#x27;convinced that if you seriously attend to them, You will derive from them very important Instructions, with regard to your Conduct in Life. There is manuscript evidence that Austen continued to work on these pieces as late as 1811 (when she was 36), and that her niece and nephew, Anna and James Edward Austen, made further additions as late as 1814.

Between 1793 and 1795 (aged eighteen to twenty), Austen wrote &quot;Lady Susan&quot;, a short epistolary novel, usually described as her most ambitious and sophisticated early work. It is unlike any of Austen&#x27;s other works. Austen biographer Claire Tomalin describes the novella&#x27;s heroine as a sexual predator who uses her intelligence and charm to manipulate, betray and abuse her lovers, friends and family. Tomalin writes:

Told in letters, it is as neatly plotted as a play, and as cynical in tone as any of the most outrageous of the Restoration dramatists who may have provided some of her inspiration ... It stands alone in Austen&#x27;s work as a study of an adult woman whose intelligence and force of character are greater than those of anyone she encounters.

According to Janet Todd, the model for the title character may have been Eliza de Feuillide, who inspired Austen with stories of her glamorous life and various adventures. Eliza&#x27;s French husband was guillotined in 1794; she married Jane&#x27;s brother Henry Austen in 1797.

===Tom Lefroy===
When Austen was twenty, Tom Lefroy, a neighbour, visited Steventon from December 1795 to January 1796. He had just finished a university degree and was moving to London for training as a barrister. Lefroy and Austen would have been introduced at a ball or other neighbourhood social gathering, and it is clear from Austen&#x27;s letters to Cassandra that they spent considerable time together: &quot;I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together.&quot;

Austen wrote in her first surviving letter to her sister Cassandra that Lefroy was a &quot;very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man&quot;. Five days later in another letter, Austen wrote that she expected an &quot;offer&quot; from her &quot;friend&quot; and that &quot;I shall refuse him, however, unless he promises to give away his white coat&quot;, going on to write &quot;I will confide myself in the future to Mr Tom Lefroy, for whom I don&#x27;t give a sixpence&quot; and refuse all others. The next day, Austen wrote: &quot;The day will come on which I flirt my last with Tom Lefroy and when you receive this it will be all over. My tears flow as I write at this melancholy idea&quot;.

Halperin cautioned that Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, and some of the statements about Lefroy may have been ironic. However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him. The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane Austen never saw him again. In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen&#x27;s mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.

===Early manuscripts (1796–1798)===
After finishing &quot;Lady Susan&quot;, Austen began her first full-length novel &quot;Elinor and Marianne&quot;. Her sister remembered that it was read to the family &quot;before 1796&quot; and was told through a series of letters. Without surviving original manuscripts, there is no way to know how much of the original draft survived in the novel published anonymously in 1811 as &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;.

Austen began a second novel, &quot;First Impressions&quot; (later published as &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;), in 1796. She completed the initial draft in August 1797, aged 21; as with all of her novels, Austen read the work aloud to her family as she was working on it and it became an &quot;established favourite&quot;. At this time, her father made the first attempt to publish one of her novels. In November 1797, George Austen wrote to Thomas Cadell, an established publisher in London, to ask if he would consider publishing &quot;First Impressions&quot;. Cadell returned Mr. Austen&#x27;s letter, marking it &quot;Declined by Return of Post&quot;. Austen may not have known of her father&#x27;s efforts. Following the completion of &quot;First Impressions&quot;, Austen returned to &quot;Elinor and Marianne&quot; and from November 1797 until mid-1798, revised it heavily; she eliminated the epistolary format in favour of third-person narration and produced something close to &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;. In 1797, Austen met her cousin (and future sister-in-law), Eliza de Feuillide, a French aristocrat whose first husband the Comte de Feuillide had been guillotined, causing her to flee to Britain, where she married Henry Austen. The description of the execution of the Comte de Feuillide related by his widow left Austen with an intense horror of the French Revolution that lasted for the rest of her life.

During the middle of 1798, after finishing revisions of &quot;Elinor and Marianne&quot;, Austen began writing a third novel with the working title &quot;Susan&quot;—later &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;—a satire on the popular Gothic novel. Austen completed her work about a year later. In early 1803, Henry Austen offered &quot;Susan&quot; to Benjamin Crosby, a London publisher, who paid £10 for the copyright. Crosby promised early publication and went so far as to advertise the book publicly as being &quot;in the press&quot;, but did nothing more. The manuscript remained in Crosby&#x27;s hands, unpublished, until Austen repurchased the copyright from him in 1816.
===Bath and Southampton===
In December 1800, George Austen unexpectedly announced his decision to retire from the ministry, leave Steventon, and move the family to 4, Sydney Place in Bath, Somerset. While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens, Jane Austen was shocked to be told she was moving away from the only home she had ever known. An indication of her state of mind is her lack of productivity as a writer during the time she lived in Bath. She was able to make some revisions to &quot;Susan&quot;, and she began and then abandoned a new novel, &quot;The Watsons&quot;, but there was nothing like the productivity of the years 1795–1799. Tomalin suggests this reflects a deep depression disabling her as a writer, but Honan disagrees, arguing Austen wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life, except for a few months after her father died. It is often claimed that Austen was unhappy in Bath, which caused her to lose interest in writing, but it is just as possible that Austen&#x27;s social life in Bath prevented her from spending much time writing novels. The critic Robert Irvine argued that if Austen spent more time writing novels when she was in the countryside, it might just have been because she had more spare time as opposed to being more happy in the countryside as is often argued. Furthermore, Austen frequently both moved and travelled over southern England during this period, which was hardly a conducive environment for writing a long novel. Austen sold the rights to publish &quot;Susan&quot; to a publisher Crosby &amp; Company, who paid her £10 (). The Crosby &amp; Company advertised &quot;Susan&quot;, but never published it.
The years from 1801 to 1804 are something of a blank space for Austen scholars as Cassandra destroyed all of her letters from her sister in this period for unknown reasons. In December 1802, Austen received her only known proposal of marriage. She and her sister visited Alethea and Catherine Bigg, old friends who lived near Basingstoke. Their younger brother, Harris Bigg-Wither, had recently finished his education at Oxford and was also at home. Bigg-Wither proposed and Austen accepted. As described by Caroline Austen, Jane&#x27;s niece, and Reginald Bigg-Wither, a descendant, Harris was not attractive—he was a large, plain-looking man who spoke little, stuttered when he did speak, was aggressive in conversation, and almost completely tactless. However, Austen had known him since both were young and the marriage offered many practical advantages to Austen and her family. He was the heir to extensive family estates located in the area where the sisters had grown up. With these resources, Austen could provide her parents a comfortable old age, give Cassandra a permanent home and, perhaps, assist her brothers in their careers. By the next morning, Austen realised she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance. No contemporary letters or diaries describe how Austen felt about this proposal. Irvine described Bigg-Wither as somebody who &quot;...seems to have been a man very hard to like, let alone love&quot;.

In 1814, Austen wrote a letter to her niece Fanny Knight, who had asked for advice about a serious relationship, telling her that &quot;having written so much on one side of the question, I shall now turn around &amp; entreat you not to commit yourself farther, &amp; not to think of accepting him unless you really do like him. Anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying without Affection&quot;. The English scholar Douglas Bush wrote that Austen had &quot;had a very high ideal of the love that should unite a husband and wife ... All of her heroines ... know in proportion to their maturity, the meaning of ardent love&quot;. A possible autobiographical element in &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; occurs when Elinor Dashwood contemplates &quot;the worse and most irremediable of all evils, a connection for life&quot; with an unsuitable man.
In 1804, while living in Bath, Austen started, but did not complete, her novel &quot;The Watsons&quot;. The story centres on an invalid and impoverished clergyman and his four unmarried daughters. Sutherland describes the novel as &quot;a study in the harsh economic realities of dependent women&#x27;s lives&quot;. Honan suggests, and Tomalin agrees, that Austen chose to stop work on the novel after her father died on 21 January 1805 and her personal circumstances resembled those of her characters too closely for her comfort.

Her father&#x27;s relatively sudden death left Jane, Cassandra, and their mother in a precarious financial situation. Edward, James, Henry, and Francis Austen (known as Frank) pledged to make annual contributions to support their mother and sisters. For the next four years, the family&#x27;s living arrangements reflected their financial insecurity. They spent part of the time in rented quarters in Bath before leaving the city in June 1805 for a family visit to Steventon and Godmersham. They moved for the autumn months to the newly fashionable seaside resort of Worthing, on the Sussex coast, where they resided at Stanford Cottage. It was here that Austen is thought to have written her fair copy of &quot;Lady Susan&quot; and added its &quot;Conclusion&quot;. In 1806, the family moved to Southampton, where they shared a house with Frank Austen and his new wife. A large part of this time they spent visiting various branches of the family.

On 5 April 1809, about three months before the family&#x27;s move to Chawton, Austen wrote an angry letter to Richard Crosby, offering him a new manuscript of &quot;Susan&quot; if needed to secure the immediate publication of the novel, and requesting the return of the original so she could find another publisher. Crosby replied that he had not agreed to publish the book by any particular time, or at all, and that Austen could repurchase the manuscript for the £10 he had paid her and find another publisher. She did not have the resources to buy the copyright back at that time, but was able to purchase it in 1816.
===Chawton===
Around early 1809, Austen&#x27;s brother Edward offered his mother and sisters a more settled life—the use of a large cottage in Chawton village which was part of the estate around Edward&#x27;s nearby property Chawton House. Jane, Cassandra and their mother moved into Chawton cottage on 7 July 1809. Life was quieter in Chawton than it had been since the family&#x27;s move to Bath in 1800. The Austens did not socialise with gentry and entertained only when family visited. Her niece Anna described the family&#x27;s life in Chawton as &quot;a very quiet life, according to our ideas, but they were great readers, and besides the housekeeping our aunts occupied themselves in working with the poor and in teaching some girl or boy to read or write.&quot;

==Published author==

Like many women authors at the time, Austen published her books anonymously. At the time, the ideal roles for a woman were as wife and mother, and writing for women was regarded at best as a secondary form of activity; a woman who wished to be a full-time writer was felt to be degrading her femininity, so books by women were usually published anonymously in order to maintain the conceit that the female writer was only publishing as a sort of part-time job, and was not seeking to become a &quot;literary lioness&quot; (i.e. a celebrity). Another reason noted is that the novel was still seen as a lesser form of literature at the time compared with poetry, and many female and male authors published novels anonymously, whereas works of poetry, by both female and male writers were almost always attributed to the author. 

During her time at Chawton, Austen published four generally well-received novels. Through her brother Henry, the publisher Thomas Egerton agreed to publish &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, which, like all of Austen&#x27;s novels except &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, was published &quot;on commission&quot;, that is, at the author&#x27;s financial risk. When publishing on commission, publishers would advance the costs of publication, repay themselves as books were sold and then charge a 10% commission for each book sold, paying the rest to the author. If a novel did not recover its costs through sales, the author was responsible for them. The alternative to selling via commission was by selling the copyright, where an author received a one-time payment from the publisher for the manuscript, which occurred with &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. Austen&#x27;s experience with &quot;Susan&quot; (the manuscript that became &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;) where she sold the copyright to the publisher Crosby &amp; Sons for £10, who did not publish the book, forcing her to buy back the copyright in order to get her work published, left Austen leery of this method of publishing. The final alternative, of selling by subscription, where a group of people would agree to buy a book in advance, was not an option for Austen as only authors who were well known or had an influential aristocratic patron who would recommend an up-coming book to their friends, could sell by subscription. &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; appeared in October 1811, and was described as being written &quot;By a Lady&quot;. As it was sold on commission, Egerton used expensive paper and set the price at 15 shillings ().
Reviews were favourable and the novel became fashionable among young aristocratic opinion-makers; the edition sold out by mid-1813. Austen&#x27;s novels were published in larger editions than was normal for this period. The small size of the novel-reading public and the large costs associated with hand production (particularly the cost of handmade paper) meant that most novels were published in editions of 500 copies or fewer to reduce the risks to the publisher and the novelist. Even some of the most successful titles during this period were issued in editions of not more than 750 or 800 copies and later reprinted if demand continued. Austen&#x27;s novels were published in larger editions, ranging from about 750 copies of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; to about 2,000 copies of &quot;Emma&quot;. It is not clear whether the decision to print more copies than usual of Austen&#x27;s novels was driven by the publishers or the author. Since all but one of Austen&#x27;s books were originally published &quot;on commission&quot;, the risks of overproduction were largely hers (or Cassandra&#x27;s after her death) and publishers may have been more willing to produce larger editions than was normal practice when their own funds were at risk. Editions of popular works of non-fiction were often much larger.

Austen made £140 () from &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, which provided her with some financial and psychological independence. After the success of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, all of Austen&#x27;s subsequent books were billed as written &quot;By the author of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;&quot; and Austen&#x27;s name never appeared on her books during her lifetime. Egerton then published &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, a revision of &quot;First Impressions&quot;, in January 1813. Austen sold the copyright to &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; to Egerton for £110 (). To maximise profits, he used cheap paper and set the price at 18 shillings (). He advertised the book widely and it was an immediate success, garnering three favourable reviews and selling well. Had Austen sold &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; on commission, she would have made a profit of £475, or twice her father&#x27;s annual income. By October 1813, Egerton was able to begin selling a second edition. &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; was published by Egerton in May 1814. While &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; was ignored by reviewers, it was very popular with readers. All copies were sold within six months, and Austen&#x27;s earnings on this novel were larger than for any of her other novels.

Without Austen&#x27;s knowledge or approval, her novels were translated into French and published in cheaply produced, pirated editions in France. The literary critic Noel King commented in 1953 that, given the prevailing rage in France at the time for lush romantic fantasies, it was remarkable that her novels with the emphasis on everyday English life had any sort of a market in France. King cautioned that Austen&#x27;s chief translator in France, Madame Isabelle de Montolieu, had only the most rudimentary knowledge of English, and her translations were more of &quot;imitations&quot; than translations proper, as Montolieu depended upon assistants to provide a summary, which she then translated into an embellished French that often radically altered Austen&#x27;s plots and characters. The first of the Austen novels to be published that credited her as the author was in France, when &quot;Persuasion&quot; was published in 1821 as &quot;La Famille Elliot ou L&#x27;Ancienne Inclination&quot;.

Austen learned that the Prince Regent admired her novels and kept a set at each of his residences. In November 1815, the Prince Regent&#x27;s librarian James Stanier Clarke invited Austen to visit the Prince&#x27;s London residence and hinted Austen should dedicate the forthcoming &quot;Emma&quot; to the Prince. Though Austen disapproved of the Prince Regent, she could scarcely refuse the request. Austen disapproved of the Prince Regent on the account of his womanising, gambling, drinking, spendthrift ways, and generally disreputable behaviour. She later wrote &quot;Plan of a Novel, according to Hints from Various Quarters&quot;, a satiric outline of the &quot;perfect novel&quot; based on the librarian&#x27;s many suggestions for a future Austen novel. Austen was greatly annoyed by Clarke&#x27;s often pompous literary advice, and the &quot;Plan of a Novel&quot; parodying Clarke was intended as her revenge for all the unwanted letters she had received from the royal librarian.

In mid-1815 Austen moved her work from Egerton to John Murray, a better-known publisher in London, who published &quot;Emma&quot; in December 1815 and a second edition of &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; in February 1816. &quot;Emma&quot; sold well, but the new edition of &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; did poorly, and this failure offset most of the income from &quot;Emma&quot;. These were the last of Austen&#x27;s novels to be published during her lifetime.

While Murray prepared &quot;Emma&quot; for publication, Austen began &quot;The Elliots&quot;, later published as &quot;Persuasion&quot;. She completed her first draft in July 1816. In addition, shortly after the publication of &quot;Emma&quot;, Henry Austen repurchased the copyright for &quot;Susan&quot; from Crosby. Austen was forced to postpone publishing either of these completed novels by family financial troubles. Henry Austen&#x27;s bank failed in March 1816, depriving him of all of his assets, leaving him deeply in debt and costing Edward, James, and Frank Austen large sums. Henry and Frank could no longer afford the contributions they had made to support their mother and sisters.

===Illness and death===


Austen was feeling unwell by early 1816, but ignored the warning signs. By the middle of that year, her decline was unmistakable, and she began a slow, irregular deterioration. The majority of biographers rely on Zachary Cope&#x27;s 1964 retrospective diagnosis and list her cause of death as Addison&#x27;s disease, although her final illness has also been described as resulting from Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma. When her uncle died and left his entire fortune to his wife, effectively disinheriting his relatives, she suffered a relapse, writing: &quot;I am ashamed to say that the shock of my Uncle&#x27;s Will brought on a relapse ... but a weak Body must excuse weak Nerves.&quot;

Austen continued to work in spite of her illness. Dissatisfied with the ending of &quot;The Elliots&quot;, she rewrote the final two chapters, which she finished on 6 August 1816. In January 1817, Austen began &quot;The Brothers&quot; (titled &quot;Sanditon&quot; when published in 1925), completing twelve chapters before stopping work in mid-March 1817, probably due to illness. Todd describes &quot;Sanditon&quot;″s heroine, Diana Parker, as an &quot;energetic invalid&quot;. In the novel Austen mocked hypochondriacs, and although she describes the heroine as &quot;bilious&quot;, five days after abandoning the novel she wrote of herself that she was turning &quot;every wrong colour&quot; and living &quot;chiefly on the sofa&quot;. She put down her pen on 18 March 1817, making a note of it.
Austen made light of her condition, describing it as &quot;bile&quot; and rheumatism. As her illness progressed, she experienced difficulty walking and lacked energy; by mid-April she was confined to bed. In May, Cassandra and Henry brought her to Winchester for treatment, by which time she suffered agonising pain and welcomed death. Austen died in Winchester on 18 July 1817 at the age of 41. Henry, through his clerical connections, arranged for his sister to be buried in the north aisle of the nave of Winchester Cathedral. The epitaph composed by her brother James praises Austen&#x27;s personal qualities, expresses hope for her salvation, and mentions the &quot;extraordinary endowments of her mind&quot;, but does not explicitly mention her achievements as a writer.

==Posthumous publication==
In the months after Austen&#x27;s death in July 1817, Cassandra, Henry Austen and Murray arranged for the publication of &quot;Persuasion&quot; and &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; as a set. Henry Austen contributed a &quot;Biographical Note&quot; dated December 1817, which for the first time identified his sister as the author of the novels. Tomalin describes it as &quot;a loving and polished eulogy&quot;. Sales were good for a year—only 321 copies remained unsold at the end of 1818.

Although Austen&#x27;s six novels were out of print in England in the 1820s, they were still being read through copies housed in private libraries and circulating libraries. Austen had early admirers. The first piece of fiction using her as a character (what might now be called real person fiction) appeared in 1823 in a letter to the editor in &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. It refers to Austen&#x27;s genius and suggests that aspiring authors were envious of her powers.

In 1832, Richard Bentley purchased the remaining copyrights to all of her novels, and over the following winter published five illustrated volumes as part of his &quot;Standard Novels&quot; series. In October 1833, Bentley released the first collected edition of her works. Since then, Austen&#x27;s novels have been continuously in print.

==Genre and style==
Austen&#x27;s works implicitly critique the sentimental novels of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism. The earliest English novelists, Richardson, Henry Fielding, and Tobias Smollett, were followed by the school of sentimentalists and romantics such as Walter Scott, Horace Walpole, Clara Reeve, Ann Radcliffe, and Oliver Goldsmith, whose style and genre Austen repudiated, returning the novel on a &quot;slender thread&quot; to the tradition of Richardson and Fielding for a &quot;realistic study of manners&quot;. In the mid-20th century the literary critics F. R. Leavis and Ian Watt placed her in the tradition of Richardson and Fielding; both believe that she used their tradition of &quot;irony, realism and satire to form an author superior to both&quot;.

Walter Scott noted Austen&#x27;s &quot;resistance to the trashy sensationalism of much of modern fiction—&#x27;the ephemeral productions which supply the regular demand of watering places and circulating libraries&#x27;&quot;. Yet her relationship with these genres is complex, as evidenced by &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; and &quot;Emma&quot;. Similar to William Wordsworth, who excoriated the modern frantic novel in the &quot;Preface&quot; to his &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; (1800), Austen distances herself from escapist novels; the discipline and innovation she demonstrates is similar to his, and she shows &quot;that rhetorically less is artistically more.&quot; She eschewed popular Gothic fiction, stories of terror in which a heroine typically was stranded in a remote location, a castle or abbey (32 novels between 1784 and 1818 contain the word &quot;abbey&quot; in their title). Yet in &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; she alludes to the trope, with the heroine, Catherine, anticipating a move to a remote locale. Rather than full-scale rejection or parody, Austen transforms the genre, juxtaposing reality, with descriptions of elegant rooms and modern comforts, against the heroine&#x27;s &quot;novel-fueled&quot; desires. Nor does she completely denigrate Gothic fiction: instead she transforms settings and situations, such that the heroine is still imprisoned, yet her imprisonment is mundane and real—regulated manners and the strict rules of the ballroom. In &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; Austen presents characters who are more complex than in staple sentimental fiction, according to the critic Tom Keymer, who notes that although it is a parody of popular sentimental fiction, &quot;Marianne in her sentimental histrionics responds to the calculating world ... with a quite justifiable scream of female distress.&quot;
Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Pamela&quot;, the prototype for the sentimental novel, is a didactic love story with a happy ending, written at a time women were beginning to have the right to choose husbands and yet were restricted by social conventions. Austen attempted Richardson&#x27;s epistolary style, but found the flexibility of narrative more conducive to her realism, a realism in which each conversation and gesture carries a weight of significance. The narrative style utilises free indirect speech—she was the first English novelist to do so extensively—through which she had the ability to present a character&#x27;s thoughts directly to the reader and yet still retain narrative control. The style allows an author to vary discourse between the narrator&#x27;s voice and values and those of the characters.

Austen had a natural ear for speech and dialogue, according to the scholar Mary Lascelles: &quot;Few novelists can be more scrupulous than Jane Austen as to the phrasing and thoughts of their characters.&quot; Techniques such as fragmentary speech suggest a character&#x27;s traits and their tone; &quot;syntax and phrasing rather than vocabulary&quot; is utilised to indicate social variants. Dialogue reveals a character&#x27;s mood—frustration, anger, happiness—each treated differently and often through varying patterns of sentence structures. When Elizabeth Bennet rejects Darcy, her stilted speech and the convoluted sentence structure reveals that he has wounded her:
From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that the groundwork of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike. And I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.
Austen&#x27;s plots highlight women&#x27;s traditional dependence on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. As an art form, the 18th-century novel lacked the seriousness of its equivalents from the 19th century, when novels were treated as &quot;the natural vehicle for discussion and ventilation of what mattered in life&quot;. Rather than delving too deeply into the psyche of her characters, Austen enjoys them and imbues them with humour, according to critic John Bayley. He believes that the well-spring of her wit and irony is her own attitude that comedy &quot;is the saving grace of life&quot;. Part of Austen&#x27;s fame rests on the historical and literary significance that she was the first woman to write great comic novels. Samuel Johnson&#x27;s influence is evident, in that she follows his advice to write &quot;a representation of life as may excite mirth&quot;.

Her humour comes from her modesty and lack of superiority, allowing her most successful characters, such as Elizabeth Bennet, to transcend the trivialities of life, which the more foolish characters are overly absorbed in. Austen used comedy to explore the individualism of women&#x27;s lives and gender relations, and she appears to have used it to find the goodness in life, often fusing it with &quot;ethical sensibility&quot;, creating artistic tension. Critic Robert Polhemus writes, &quot;To appreciate the drama and achievement of Austen, we need to realize how deep was her passion for both reverence and ridicule ... and her comic imagination reveals both the harmonies and the telling contradictions of her mind and vision as she tries to reconcile her satirical bias with her sense of the good.&quot;

==Reception==
===Contemporaneous responses===

As Austen&#x27;s works were published anonymously, they brought her little personal renown. They were fashionable among opinion-makers, but were rarely reviewed. Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious, most often focused on the moral lessons of the novels.

Walter Scott, a leading novelist of the day, anonymously wrote a review of &quot;Emma&quot; in 1815, using it to defend the then-disreputable genre of the novel and praising Austen&#x27;s realism, &quot;the art of copying from nature as she really exists in the common walks of life, and presenting to the reader, instead of the splendid scenes from an imaginary world, a correct and striking representation of that which is daily taking place around him&quot;. The other important early review was attributed to Richard Whately in 1821. However, Whately denied having authored the review, which drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and Shakespeare, and praised the dramatic qualities of her narrative. Scott and Whately set the tone for almost all subsequent 19th-century Austen criticism.

===19th century===
Because Austen&#x27;s novels did not conform to Romantic and Victorian expectations that &quot;powerful emotion [be] authenticated by an egregious display of sound and colour in the writing&quot;, some 19th-century critics preferred the works of Charles Dickens and George Eliot. Notwithstanding Walter Scott&#x27;s positivity, Austen&#x27;s work did not win over those who preferred the prevailing aesthetic values of the elite Romantic zeitgeist. Her novels were republished in Britain from the 1830s and sold steadily. Austen&#x27;s six books were included in the canon-making Standard Novels series by publisher Richard Bentley, which increased their stature. That series referred to her as &quot;the founder of a school of novelists&quot; and called her a genius.

The first French critic who paid notice to Austen was Philarète Chasles in an 1842 essay, dismissing her in two sentences as a boring, imitative writer with no substance. Austen was not widely appreciated in France until 1878, when the French critic Léon Boucher published the essay , in which he called Austen a &quot;genius&quot;, the first French author to do so. The first accurate translation of Austen into French occurred in 1899 when Félix Fénéon translated &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; as &quot;Catherine Morland&quot;.

In Britain and North America, Austen gradually grew in the estimation of both the public and the literati. In the United States, Austen was being recommended as reading in schools as early as 1838, according to Professor Devoney Looser. The philosopher and literary critic George Henry Lewes published a series of enthusiastic articles in the 1840s and 1850s. Later in the century, the novelist Henry James referred to Austen several times with approval, and on one occasion ranked her with Shakespeare, Cervantes, and Henry Fielding as amongst &quot;the fine painters of life&quot;.

The publication of James Edward Austen-Leigh&#x27;s &quot;A Memoir of Jane Austen&quot; in 1869 introduced Austen&#x27;s life story to a wider public as &quot;dear aunt Jane&quot;, the respectable maiden aunt. Publication of the &quot;Memoir&quot; spurred another reissue of Austen&#x27;s novels. Editions were released in 1883 and fancy illustrated editions and collectors&#x27; sets quickly followed. The author and critic Leslie Stephen described the popular mania that started to develop for Austen in the 1880s as &quot;Austenolatry&quot;. Around the start of the 20th century, an intellectual clique of &quot;Janeites&quot; reacted against the popularisation of Austen, distinguishing their deeper appreciation from the vulgar enthusiasm of the masses.

In response, Henry James decried &quot;a beguiled infatuation&quot; with Austen, a rising tide of public interest that exceeded Austen&#x27;s &quot;intrinsic merit and interest&quot;. The American literary critic A. Walton Litz noted that the &quot;anti-Janites&quot; in the 19th and 20th centuries comprised a formidable literary squad of Mark Twain, Henry James, Charlotte Brontë, D. H. Lawrence, and Kingsley Amis, but in &quot;every case the adverse judgement merely reveals the special limitations or eccentricities of the critic, leaving Jane Austen relatively untouched&quot;.

===Modern===
Austen&#x27;s works have attracted legions of scholars. The first dissertation on Austen was published in 1883, by George Pellew, a student at Harvard University. Another early academic analysis came from a 1911 essay by the Oxford Shakespearean scholar A. C. Bradley, who grouped Austen&#x27;s novels into &quot;early&quot; and &quot;late&quot; works, a distinction still used by scholars today. The first academic book devoted to Austen in France was &quot;Jane Austen&quot; by Paul and Kate Rague (1914), who set out to explain why French critics and readers should take Austen seriously. The same year, Léonie Villard published &quot;Jane Austen, Sa Vie et Ses Oeuvres&quot;, originally her PhD thesis, the first serious academic study of Austen in France. In 1923, R.W. Chapman published the first scholarly edition of Austen&#x27;s collected works, which was also the first scholarly edition of any English novelist. The Chapman text has remained the basis for all subsequent published editions of Austen&#x27;s works.

With the publication in 1939 of Mary Lascelles&#x27; &quot;Jane Austen and Her Art&quot;, the academic study of Austen took hold. Lascelles analysed the books Austen read and their influence on her work, and closely examined Austen&#x27;s style and &quot;narrative art&quot;. Concern arose that academics were obscuring the appreciation of Austen with increasingly esoteric theories, a debate that has continued since.

The period since the Second World War has seen a diversity of critical approaches to Austen, including feminist theory, and perhaps most controversially, postcolonial theory. The divide has widened between the popular appreciation of Austen, particularly by modern Janeites, and academic judgements. In 1994 the literary critic Harold Bloom placed Austen among the greatest Western writers of all time.

In the People&#x27;s Republic of China after 1949, writings of Austen were regarded as too frivolous, and thus during the Chinese Cultural Revolution of 1966–76, Austen was banned as a &quot;British bourgeois imperialist&quot;. In the late 1970s, when Austen&#x27;s works were re-published in China, her popularity with readers confounded the authorities who had trouble understanding that people generally read books for enjoyment, not political edification.

The conservative American professor Gene Koppel claimed that Austen and her family were &quot;Tories of the deepest dye&quot;, i.e. Conservatives in opposition to the liberal Whigs. Although several feminist authors such as Claudia Johnson and Mollie Sandock claimed Austen for their own cause, Koppel argued that different people react to a work of literature in different subjective ways, as explained by the philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer. Thus competing interpretations of Austen&#x27;s work can be equally valid, provided they are grounded in textual and historical analysis: it is equally possible to see Austen as a feminist critiquing Regency-era society and as a conservative upholding its values.

===Adaptations===

Austen&#x27;s novels have resulted in sequels, prequels and adaptations of almost every type, from soft-core pornography to fantasy. From the 19th century, her family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels, and by 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations. The first dramatic adaptation of Austen was published in 1895, Rosina Filippi&#x27;s &quot;Duologues and Scenes from the Novels of Jane Austen: Arranged and Adapted for Drawing-Room Performance&quot;, and Filippi was also responsible for the first professional stage adaptation, &quot;The Bennets&quot; (1901). The first film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. BBC television dramatisations released in the 1970s and 1980s attempted to adhere meticulously to Austen&#x27;s plots, characterisations and settings. The British critic Robert Irvine noted that in American film adaptations of Austen&#x27;s novels, starting with the 1940 version of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, class is subtly downplayed, and the society of Regency England depicted by Austen that is grounded in a hierarchy based upon the ownership of land and the antiquity of the family name is one that Americans cannot embrace in its entirety.

From 1995, many Austen adaptations appeared, with Ang Lee&#x27;s film of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, for which screenwriter and star Emma Thompson won an Academy Award, and the BBC&#x27;s immensely popular TV mini-series &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. A 2005 British production of &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot;, directed by Joe Wright and starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen, was followed in 2007 by ITV&#x27;s &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; and &quot;Persuasion&quot;, and in 2016 by &quot;Love &amp; Friendship&quot; starring Kate Beckinsale as Lady Susan, a film version of &quot;Lady Susan&quot;, that borrowed the title of Austen&#x27;s &quot;Love and &quot; .

== Honours ==

In 2013, Austen&#x27;s works featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail to mark the bicentenary of the publication of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. Austen is on the £10 note issued by the Bank of England which was introduced in 2017, replacing Charles Darwin. In July 2017 a statue of Austen was erected in Basingstoke, Hampshire on the 200th anniversary of her death.

<text>June—abbreviated Jun—is the sixth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars—the latter the most widely used calendar in the world. Its length is 30 days. June succeeds May and precedes July. This month marks the start of summer in the Northern Hemisphere and contains the summer solstice, which is the day with the most daylight hours. In the Southern Hemisphere, June is the start of winter and contains the winter solstice, the day with the fewest hours of daylight out of the year.

In places north of the Arctic Circle, the June solstice is when the midnight sun occurs, during which the Sun remains visible even at midnight. The Atlantic hurricane season—when tropical or subtropical cyclones are most likely to form in the north Atlantic Ocean—begins on 1 June and lasts until 30 November. Several monsoons and subsequent wet seasons also commence in the Northern Hemisphere during this month. Multiple meteor showers occur annually in June, including the Arietids, which are among the most intense daylight meteor showers of the year; they last between 22 May and 2 July, peaking in intensity on 8 June.

Numerous observances take place in June. Midsummer, the celebration of the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, is celebrated in several countries. In Catholicism, this month is dedicated to the devotion of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and known as the Month of the Sacred Heart. In the United States, June is dedicated to Pride Month, a month-long observance of LGBT individuals. Father&#x27;s Day, which honours fathers and fatherhood, occurs on the third Sunday in June in most countries.

== Overview ==
June is the sixth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars—the latter the most widely used calendar in the world. Containing 30 days, June succeeds May and precedes July. It is one of four months that have 30 days—alongside April, September and November—and is the second 30-day month of the year, following April, the fourth month of the year, and preceding September—the ninth month of the year. June is in the second quarter (Q2) of a calendar year, alongside April and May, and the sixth and final month in the first half of the year (January–June). Under the ISO week date system, June incidentally begins in either the 22nd or 23rd week of the year.

As of , June last occurred days ago (UTC). During each calendar year, no other month starts on the same day of the week as June. The Julian calendar—which also has June and is still used as a ceremonial religious calendar by some of the Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodoxy—is 13 days behind the Gregorian calendar. Thus, in this calendar, 1 June begins on 13 June. It will be 14 days behind in 2100. June is abbreviated as &quot;Jun&quot;, and may be spelled with or without a concluding period (full stop).

=== Etymology ===
&quot;June&quot; is ultimately derived from the Latin month of &quot;Iunius&quot;, named after the ancient Roman goddess Juno (Latin: ). The present English spelling was influenced by the Anglo-Norman &quot;join&quot;, &quot;junye&quot; and &quot;junie&quot;. It was also written in Middle English as &quot;Iun&quot; and &quot;Juin&quot;, while the spelling variant &quot;Iune&quot; was in use until the 17th century. It displaced the Old English name for June, &quot;ærra liþa&quot;.

== History ==

June originates from the month of &quot;Iunius&quot; (also called ) in the original Roman calendar used during the Roman Republic. The origin of this calendar is obscure. &quot;Iunius&quot; was originally the fourth month of the year, and had 29 days alongside (&quot;April&quot;), (later renamed &quot;August&quot;), , and . It is not known when the Romans reset the course of the year so that (&quot;January&quot;) and (&quot;February&quot;), originally the 11th and 12th months respectively, came first—thus moving &quot;Iunius&quot; to the sixth month of the year—but later Roman scholars generally dated this to 153 BC.

In ancient Rome, the period from mid-May through mid-June may have been considered inauspicious for marriages. The Roman poet Ovid claimed to have consulted the &quot;flaminica Dialis&quot;, the high priestess of the god Jupiter, about setting a date for his daughter&#x27;s wedding, but was advised to wait until after 15 June. The Greek philosopher and writer Plutarch, however, implied that the entire month of June was more favorable for weddings than May.

In 46 BC, Julius Caesar reformed the calendar, which thus became known as the Julian calendar after himself. This reform fixed the calendar to 365 days with a leap year every fourth year, and made June 30 days long; however, this reform resulted in the average year of the Julian calendar being 365.25 days long, slightly more than the actual solar year of 365.2422 days (the current value, which varies).

In AD 65, June was renamed as &quot;Germanicus&quot; in honour of the Roman emperor Nero. As recalled by the Roman historian Tacitus in his &quot;Annals&quot;, the Roman senator Cornelius Orfitus, who made the proposal, claimed that the name &quot;Junius&quot; had become inauspicious due to the executions of Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus and Decimus Junius Silanus Torquatus in AD 49 and AD 64, respectively. The names did not survive and were likely erased when Nero was subjected to &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;. In AD 184, Roman Emperor Commodus briefly renamed all of the months after a name in his full title; June became &quot;Aelius&quot;. However, this decision was repealed after his death in AD 192.

In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII promulgated a revised calendar—the Gregorian calendar—that reduced the average length of the calendar year from 365.25 days to 365.2425, correcting the Julian calendar&#x27;s drift against the solar year.

== Climate, daylight and astronomy ==

In the Northern Hemisphere, June marks the commencement of summer, while in the Southern Hemisphere, it is the start of winter. In the Northern Hemisphere, the beginning of the traditional astronomical summer is 21 June, while meteorological summer commences on 1 June. In the Southern Hemisphere, astronomical winter starts on 21 June while meteorological winter begins on 1 June.

The June solstice—known as the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere and winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere—occurs for one-day between 20–22 June (most often on 21 June), marking the longest day of the year in terms of daylight hours in the Northern Hemisphere and the shortest day in the Southern Hemisphere. In places north of the Arctic Circle, this is when the midnight sun occurs for the longest period, during which the Sun remains visible even at midnight. Conversely, it is polar night in places within the Antarctic Circle, during which the Sun remains below the horizon for more than 24 hours.

In astronomy, certain meteor showers occur annually during this month. The Arietids—among the most intense daylight meteor showers of the year—last from 22 May until 2 July, peaking in intensity on 8 June; the Beta Taurids take place between 5 June and 18 July, peaking on 28 June; and the June Bootids commence between 22 June and 2 July, peaking on 27 June. The full moon that occurs in June is most commonly known as the strawberry moon because it coincides with the strawberry-picking season; other names for it include the &quot;rose moon&quot;, &quot;honey moon&quot; and the poetic &quot;midsummer moon&quot;.

=== Climate ===
June is one of the hottest months in the Northern Hemisphere, alongside July and August, with July being the hottest; in the Southern Hemisphere, it is the inverse. For instance, the lowest temperature ever recorded in South America occurred on 1 June 1907 in the town of Sarmiento in the Chubut Province of Argentina, measuring -32.8°C (-27°F). June 2024 was the hottest June in recorded history at 1.22°C (2.20°F) above the 20th-century global average, beating the previous record held by June 2023.

The Atlantic hurricane season—when tropical or subtropical cyclones are most likely to form in the north Atlantic Ocean—begins on 1 June and lasts until 30 November. In the Indian Ocean north of the equator, around the Indian subcontinent, year-round tropical cyclones appear frequently between May and June. In contrast, Mediterranean tropical-like cyclones are least likely to form in June because of the dry season of the Mediterranean having stable air.

The East Asian, North American, South Asian (Indian) and West African monsoons generally begin in June, while the European monsoon season intensifies that month. The East Asian monsoon commences the East Asian rainy season. The highest volume of rainfall ever recorded in a one-hour period occurred on 22 June 1947 in the small city of Holt, Missouri in the United States, measuring 305 mm (12 inches) of rainfall. The greatest rainfall within a 48-hour period occurred between 15–16 June 1995 in the town of Cherrapunji in Meghalaya, India, with 2.493 metres (98.15 inches) of rainfall recorded.

=== Agriculture ===
The crops which are harvested this month include several varieties of corn; wheat, barley, maize, rapeseed, rice, rye and sorghum in most of the Northern Hemisphere, and maize, cotton, pearl millet, sorghum and soybeans in most of the Southern Hemisphere. In much of the Northern Hemisphere, apricots, blackberries, blueberries, cherries, mangoes, raspberries, strawberries and watermelons are fruits which are considered to be in season or at their peak in June. Vegetables that are in season in this hemisphere during June include asparagus, beetroot, cucumbers, lettuce, peas, radishes, spinach, tomatoes and zucchini (courgettes). In much of the Southern Hemisphere, the fruits which are in season are avocados, bananas, citrus (such as grapefruit, lemons, mandarins and oranges), kiwifruit and pears.

== Observances ==

In Catholicism, June is dedicated to the devotion of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. This observance is called the Month of the Sacred Heart. In Canada, June is ALS Awareness Month, a campaign to spread awareness and raise funds for a cure for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Filipino Heritage Month. In the United States, June is Pride Month, which is the celebration of LGBTQ individuals. Caribbean-American Heritage Month also occurs annually in June. In Brazil, the &quot;Festa Juninas&quot; (June Festivals) occur throughout the entire month to celebrate the harvest.

It is also National Safety Month in the United States, a month-long observance aimed at increasing awareness of, and ultimately decreasing, the number of unintentional injuries and deaths in the country. National Smile Month, the largest oral health campaign in the United Kingdom and organised by the Oral Health Foundation, commences between alternating dates from mid-May to mid-June. In Barbados, June is part of the Season of Emancipation which takes place between 14 April and 23 August to commemorate the emancipation of slaves of African descent.

=== Global single-day observances ===
The first day of June commences with World Milk Day and International Children&#x27;s Day in several countries. International Whores&#x27; Day, an observance to honour sex workers (prostitutes) and recognise their often exploited and poor working conditions, occurs on 2 June. Several memorials and other commemorations are held around the world on 4 June to honour the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre that occurred in China. Similar annual memorials are held for the Normandy landings (D-Day), the largest seaborne invasion in history, which occurred on 6 June 1944 as part of the Second World War. Global Wind Day is on 15 June, and on 16 June is the International Day of the African Child, which raises awareness for the need of improved education provided to children in Africa. Autistic Pride Day occurs on 18 June.

19 June is World Sauntering Day, which encourages people to slow down (&quot;saunter&quot;) and enjoy life. Go Skateboarding Day and World Hydrography Day both occur on 21 June.

<text>July is the seventh month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars. Its length is 31 days. It was named by the Roman Senate in honour of Roman general Julius Caesar in 44 B.C., being the month of his birth. Before then it was called Quintilis, being the fifth month of the calendar that started with March.

It is on average the warmest month in most of the Northern Hemisphere, where it is the second month of summer, and the coldest month in much of the Southern Hemisphere, where it is the second month of winter. The second half of the year commences in July. In the Southern Hemisphere, July is the seasonal equivalent of January in the Northern hemisphere.

&quot;Dog days&quot; are considered to begin in early July in the Northern Hemisphere, when the hot sultry weather of summer usually starts. Spring lambs born in late winter or early spring are usually sold before 1 July.

== Symbols ==
July&#x27;s birthstone is the ruby, which symbolizes contentment. Its birth flowers are the larkspur and the water lily. The zodiac signs are Cancer (until July 22) and Leo (July 23 onward).
