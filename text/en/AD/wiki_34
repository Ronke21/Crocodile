<text>James Gillespie Blaine (January 31, 1830January 27, 1893) was an American statesman and Republican politician who represented Maine in the United States House of Representatives from 1863 to 1876, serving as speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1869 to 1875, and then in the United States Senate from 1876 to 1881. Blaine twice served as Secretary of State, first in 1881 under President James A. Garfield and Chester A. Arthur, and then from 1889 to 1892 under President Benjamin Harrison. He is one of only two U.S. Secretaries of State to hold the position under three separate presidents, the other being Daniel Webster. Blaine unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for President in 1876 and 1880 before being nominated in 1884. In the 1884 general election, he was narrowly defeated by Democratic nominee Grover Cleveland. Blaine was one of the late 19th century&#x27;s leading Republicans and a champion of the party&#x27;s moderate reformist faction, later known as the &quot;Half-Breeds&quot;.

Blaine was born in the western Pennsylvania town of West Brownsville; after completing college he moved to Maine where he became a newspaper editor. Nicknamed &quot;the Magnetic Man&quot;, he was a charismatic speaker in an era that prized oratory. He began his political career as an early supporter of Republican Abraham Lincoln and the Union war effort in the American Civil War. During Reconstruction, Blaine was a supporter of black suffrage, but opposed some of the more coercive measures of the Radical Republicans. Initially in favor of high tariffs, he later worked to lower tariffs and expand international trade. Railroad promotion and construction were important issues in his time and, as a result of his interest and support, Blaine was widely suspected of corruption in awarding railroad charters, especially with the emergence of the Mulligan letters. Though no evidence of corruption ever surfaced from these allegations, they nevertheless plagued his 1884 presidential candidacy.

As Secretary of State, Blaine was a transitional figure, marking the end of an isolationist era in foreign policy and foreshadowing the rise of the American Century that would begin with the Spanish–American War. His efforts to expand U.S. trade and influence began the nation&#x27;s shift to a more active American foreign policy. Blaine was a pioneer of tariff reciprocity and urged greater involvement in Latin American affairs. Blaine was also an expansionist, and his policies would lead in less than a decade to the U.S. acquisition of Pacific colonies and the establishment of dominance in the Caribbean.

== Early life ==

=== Family and childhood ===
James Gillespie Blaine was born January 31, 1830, in West Brownsville, Pennsylvania, the third child of Ephraim Lyon Blaine and his wife Maria (Gillespie) Blaine. He had two older sisters, Harriet and Margaret. Blaine&#x27;s father was a western Pennsylvania businessman and landowner, and the family lived in relative comfort. On his father&#x27;s side, Blaine was descended from Scotch-Irish settlers who first emigrated to Pennsylvania in 1745. His great-grandfather Ephraim Blaine served as a Commissary-General under George Washington in the American Revolutionary War. Blaine&#x27;s mother and her forebears were Irish Catholics who immigrated to Pennsylvania in the 1780s. Blaine&#x27;s parents were married in 1820 in a Catholic ceremony, although Blaine&#x27;s father remained a Presbyterian. Following a common compromise of the era, the Blaines agreed that their daughters would be raised in their mother&#x27;s Catholic faith while their sons would be brought up in their father&#x27;s religion. James Blaine&#x27;s cousin, Angela Gillespie, was a nun and founded the American branch of the Sisters of the Holy Cross. In politics, Blaine&#x27;s father supported the Whig Party.

Blaine&#x27;s biographers describe his childhood as &quot;harmonious,&quot; and note that the boy took an early interest in history and literature. At the age of thirteen, Blaine enrolled in his father&#x27;s alma mater, Washington College (now Washington &amp; Jefferson College), in nearby Washington, Pennsylvania. There, he was a member of the Washington Literary Society, one of the college&#x27;s debating societies. Blaine succeeded academically, graduating near the top of his class and delivering the salutatory address in June 1847. After graduation, Blaine considered attending Yale Law School, but ultimately decided against it, instead moving west to find a job.

=== Teacher and publisher ===
In 1848, Blaine was hired as a professor of mathematics and ancient languages at the Western Military Institute in Georgetown, Kentucky. Although he was only 18 years old and younger than many of his students, Blaine adapted well to his new profession. Blaine grew to enjoy life in his adopted state and became an admirer of Kentucky Senator Henry Clay. He also made the acquaintance of Harriet Stanwood, a teacher at the nearby Millersburg Female College and native of Maine. On June 30, 1850, the two wed. Blaine once again considered taking up the study of law, but instead took his new bride to visit his family in Pennsylvania. They next lived with Harriet Blaine&#x27;s family in Augusta, Maine, for several months, where their first child, Stanwood Blaine, was born in 1851. The young family soon moved again, this time to Philadelphia where Blaine took a job at the Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of the Blind (now Overbrook School for the Blind) in 1852, teaching science and literature.

Philadelphia&#x27;s law libraries gave Blaine the chance to, at last, begin to study the law, but in 1853 he received a more tempting offer: to become editor and co-owner of the &quot;Kennebec Journal&quot;. Blaine had spent several vacations in his wife&#x27;s native state of Maine and had become friendly with the &quot;Journal&quot;″s editors. When the newspaper&#x27;s founder, Luther Severance, retired, Blaine was invited to purchase the publication along with co-editor Joseph Baker. He quickly accepted, borrowing the purchase price from his wife&#x27;s brothers. In 1854, Baker sold his share to John L. Stevens, a local minister. The &quot;Journal&quot; had been a staunchly Whig newspaper, which coincided with Blaine&#x27;s and Stevens&#x27; political opinions. The decision to become a newspaperman, unexpected as it was, started Blaine on the road to a lifelong career in politics. Blaine&#x27;s purchase of the &quot;Journal&quot; coincided with the demise of the Whig party and the birth of the Republican party, and Blaine and Stevens actively promoted the new party in their newspaper. The newspaper was financially successful, and Blaine was soon able to invest his profits in coal mines in Pennsylvania and Virginia, forming the basis of his future wealth.

=== Maine politics ===
Blaine&#x27;s career as a Republican newspaperman led naturally to involvement in party politics. In 1856, he was selected as a delegate to the first Republican National Convention. From the party&#x27;s early days, Blaine identified with the conservative wing, supporting Supreme Court Justice John McLean for the presidential nomination over the more radical John C. Frémont, the eventual nominee. The following year, Blaine was offered the editorship of the &quot;Portland Daily Advertiser&quot;, which he accepted, selling his interest in the &quot;Journal&quot; soon thereafter. He still maintained his home in Augusta, however, with his growing family. Although Blaine&#x27;s first son, Stanwood, died in infancy, he and Harriet had two more sons soon afterward: Walker, in 1855, and Emmons, in 1857. They would have four more children in years to come: Alice, James, Margaret, and Harriet. It was around this time that Blaine left the Presbyterian church of his childhood and joined his wife&#x27;s new denomination, becoming a member of the South Parish Congregational Church in Augusta.

In 1858, Blaine ran for a seat in the Maine House of Representatives, and was elected. He ran for reelection in 1859, 1860, and 1861, and was successful each time by large majorities. The added responsibilities led Blaine to reduce his duties with the &quot;Advertiser&quot; in 1860, and he soon ceased editorial work altogether. Meanwhile, his political power was growing as he became chairman of the Republican state committee in 1859, replacing Stevens. Blaine was not a delegate to the Republican convention in 1860, but attended anyway as an enthusiastic supporter of Abraham Lincoln. Returning to Maine, he was elected Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives in 1861 and reelected in 1862. With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, he supported Lincoln&#x27;s war effort and saw that the Maine Legislature voted to organize and equip units to join the Union Army.

== House of Representatives, 1863–1876 ==

=== Elected to the House ===

Blaine had considered running for the United States House of Representatives from Maine&#x27;s 4th district in 1860, but agreed to step aside when Anson P. Morrill, a former governor, announced his interest in the seat. Morrill was successful, but after redistricting placed Blaine in the 3rd district for the 1862 election, he allowed his name to be put forward. Running on a campaign of staunch support for the war effort, Blaine was elected by a wide margin; though nationwide, the Republican Party lost a significant number of seats in Congress as the Union war effort to date had been only weakly successful. By the time Blaine took his seat in December 1863, at the start of the 38th Congress, the Union Army had turned the tide of the war with victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg.

As a first-term congressman, he initially said little, mostly following the administration&#x27;s lead in supporting the continuing war effort. He did clash several times with the leader of the Republicans&#x27; radical faction, Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania, firstly over payment of states&#x27; debts incurred in supporting the war, and again over monetary policy concerning the new greenback currency. Blaine also spoke in support of the commutation provision of the military draft law passed in 1863 and proposed a constitutional amendment allowing the federal government to impose taxes on exports, but it never passed.

=== Reconstruction and impeachment ===

Blaine was reelected in 1864 and, when the 39th Congress assembled in December 1865, the main issue was the Reconstruction of the defeated Confederate States. Although he was not a member of the committee charged with drafting what became the Fourteenth Amendment, Blaine did make his views on the subject known and believed that three-fourths of the non-seceded states would be needed to ratify it, rather than three-fourths of all states, an opinion that did not prevail and placed him, atypically, in the radical camp. The Republican Congress also played a role in the governance of the conquered South, dissolving the state governments President Andrew Johnson had installed and substituting military governments under Congress&#x27; control. Blaine voted in favor of these new, harsher measures, but also supported some leniency toward the former rebels when he opposed a bill that would have barred Southerners from attending the United States Military Academy. Blaine voted to impeach Johnson in 1868, although he had initially opposed the effort. Later, Blaine was more ambiguous about the validity of the charges against Johnson, writing that &quot;there was a very grave difference of opinion among those equally competent to decide,&quot; but he followed his party&#x27;s leaders.

=== Monetary policy ===
Continuing his earlier battle with Stevens, Blaine led the fight in Congress for a strong dollar. After the issuance of 150 million dollars in greenbacks—non-gold-backed currency—the value of the dollar stood at a low ebb. A bipartisan group of inflationists, led by Republican Benjamin F. Butler and Democrat George H. Pendleton, wished to preserve the &quot;status quo&quot; and allow the Treasury to continue to issue greenbacks and even to use them to pay the interest due on pre-war bonds. Blaine called this idea a repudiation of the nation&#x27;s promise to investors, which was made when the only currency was gold. Speaking several times on the matter, Blaine said that the greenbacks had only ever been an emergency measure to avoid bankruptcy during the war. Blaine and his hard money allies were successful, but the issue remained alive until 1879, when all remaining greenbacks were made redeemable in gold by the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875.

=== Speaker of the House ===
During his first three terms in Congress, Blaine had earned for himself a reputation as an expert of parliamentary procedure, and, aside from a growing feud with Roscoe Conkling of New York, had become popular among his fellow Republicans. In March 1869, when Speaker Schuyler Colfax resigned from office at the end of the 40th Congress to become vice president, the highly regarded Blaine was the unanimous choice of the Republican Congressional Caucus to become Speaker of the House for the 41st Congress. In the subsequent March 4, 1869, election for Speaker, Blaine easily defeated Democrat Michael C. Kerr of Indiana by a vote of 135 to 57. Republicans remained in control of the House in the 42nd and 43rd congresses, and Blaine was re-elected as speaker at the start of both of them. His time as speaker came to an end following the 1874-75 elections which produced a Democratic majority in the House for the 44th Congress.
Blaine was an effective Speaker with a magnetic personality. In the words of Washington journalist Benjamin Perley Poore, Blaine&#x27;s &quot;graceful as well as powerful figure, his strong features, glowing with health, and his hearty, honest manner, made him an attractive speaker and an esteemed friend.&quot; Moreover, President Ulysses S. Grant valued his skill and loyalty in leading the House. He enjoyed the job and made his presence in Washington more permanent by buying a large residence on Fifteenth Street in the city. At the same time, the Blaine family moved to a mansion in Augusta.

During Blaine&#x27;s six-year tenure as Speaker his popularity continued to grow, and Republicans dissatisfied with Grant mentioned Blaine as a potential presidential candidate prior to the 1872 Republican National Convention. Instead, Blaine worked steadfastly for Grant&#x27;s re-election. Blaine&#x27;s growing fame brought growing opposition from the Democrats, as well, and during the 1872 campaign he was accused of receiving bribes in the Crédit Mobilier scandal. Blaine denied any part in the scandal, which involved railroad companies bribing federal officials to turn a blind eye to fraudulent railroad contracts that overcharged the government by millions of dollars. No one was able to satisfactorily prove Blaine&#x27;s involvement. Though not an absolute defense, it is true that the law that made the fraud possible had been written before he was elected to Congress. But other Republicans were exposed by the accusations, including Vice President Colfax, who was dropped from the 1872 presidential ticket in favor of Henry Wilson.

Although he supported a general amnesty for former Confederates, Blaine opposed extending it to include Jefferson Davis, and he cooperated with Grant in helping to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1875 in response to increased violence and disenfranchisement of blacks in the South. He refrained from voting on the anti-third term resolution that overwhelmingly passed the House that same year, believing that to vote for it would look self-interested. Blaine was loyal to Grant, and the scandals of the Grant administration did not seem to affect how the public perceived him; according to his biographer, Blaine was never more popular than when he was Speaker. Liberal Republicans saw him as an alternative to the evident corruption of other Republican leaders, and some even urged him to form a new, reformist party. Although he remained a Republican, this base of moderate reformers remained loyal to Blaine and became known as the Half Breed faction of the party.

=== Blaine Amendment ===

Once out of the speaker&#x27;s chair, Blaine had more time to concentrate on his presidential ambitions, and to develop new policy ideas. One result was a foray into education policy. In late 1875, President Grant made several speeches on the importance of the separation of church and state and the duty of the states to provide free public education. Blaine saw in this an issue that would distract from the Grant administration scandals and let the Republican party regain the high moral ground. In December 1875, he proposed a joint resolution that became known as the Blaine Amendment.

The proposed amendment codified the church-state separation Blaine and Grant were promoting, stating that:

The effect was to prohibit the use of public funds by any religious school, although it did not advance Grant&#x27;s other aim of requiring states to provide public education to all children. The bill passed the House but failed in the Senate. Although it never passed Congress, and left Blaine open to charges of anti-Catholicism, the proposed amendment served Blaine&#x27;s purpose of rallying Protestants to the Republican party and promoting himself as one of the party&#x27;s foremost leaders.

== 1876 presidential election ==
=== Mulligan letters ===
Blaine entered the 1876 presidential campaign as the favorite, but his chances were almost immediately harmed by the emergence of a scandal. Rumors had begun to spread in February that Blaine had been involved in a transaction with the Union Pacific Railroad which had paid Blaine $64,000 for some Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad bonds he owned even though they were nearly worthless. In essence, the alleged transaction was presented as a sham designed to bribe Blaine. Blaine denied the charges, as did the Union Pacific&#x27;s directors. Blaine claimed that he never had any dealings with the Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad except to purchase bonds at market price and that he had lost money on the transaction. Democrats in the House of Representatives, however, demanded a congressional investigation. The testimony appeared to favor Blaine&#x27;s version of events until May 31, when James Mulligan, a Boston clerk who had been employed by Blaine&#x27;s brother-in-law, testified that the allegations were true, that he had arranged the transaction, and that he had letters to prove it. The letters ended with the damning phrase: &quot;Kindly burn this letter.&quot; When the investigating committee recessed, Blaine met with Mulligan that night in his hotel room. What happened between the men is unclear, but Blaine acquired the letters or, as Mulligan told the committee, snatched them from Mulligan&#x27;s hands, and fled the room. In any event, Blaine had the letters and refused the committee&#x27;s demand to turn them over.

Opinion swiftly turned against Blaine. The June 3 &quot;The New York Times&quot; carried the headline &quot;Blaine&#x27;s Nomination Now Out of the Question.&quot; Blaine took his case to the House floor on June 5, theatrically proclaiming his innocence and calling the investigation a partisan attack by Southern Democrats in revenge for his exclusion of Jefferson Davis from the amnesty bill of the previous year. He read selected passages from the letters aloud and said, &quot;Thank God Almighty, I am not afraid to show them!&quot; Blaine even succeeded in extracting an apology from the committee chairman. The political tide turned anew in Blaine&#x27;s favor, but the pressure had begun to affect Blaine&#x27;s health, and he collapsed while leaving church services on June 14. His opponents called the collapse a political stunt, with one Democratic newspaper reporting the event as &quot;Blaine Feigns a Faint.&quot; Rumors of Blaine&#x27;s ill health, combined with the lack of hard evidence against him, garnered him sympathy among Republicans and, when the Republican convention began in Cincinnati later that month, he was again seen as the frontrunner.

=== Plumed Knight ===

Though he was damaged by the Mulligan letters, Blaine entered the convention as the favorite. Five other men were also considered serious candidates: Benjamin Bristow, the Kentucky-born Treasury Secretary; Roscoe Conkling, Blaine&#x27;s old enemy and now a Senator from New York; Senator Oliver P. Morton of Indiana; Governor Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio; and Governor John F. Hartranft of Pennsylvania.

Blaine was nominated by Illinois orator Robert G. Ingersoll in what became a famous speech:

The speech was a success and Ingersoll&#x27;s description of Blaine as a &quot;plumed knight&quot; remained a nickname for Blaine for years to come. On the first ballot, no candidate received the required majority of 378, but Blaine had the most votes, with 285, and no other candidate had more than 125. There were a few vote shifts in the next five ballots, and Blaine climbed to 308 votes, with his nearest competitor having just 111. On the seventh ballot, however, the situation shifted drastically because anti-Blaine delegates began to coalesce around Hayes. By the time the balloting ended, Blaine&#x27;s votes had risen to 351, but Hayes surpassed him with 384, a majority.

Blaine received the news at his home in Washington and telegraphed Hayes his congratulations. In the subsequent contest of 1876, Hayes was elected after a contentious compromise over disputed electoral votes. The results of the convention had further effects on Blaine&#x27;s political career because Bristow, having lost the nomination, resigned as Treasury Secretary three days after the convention ended. President Grant selected Senator Lot M. Morrill of Maine to fill the cabinet post, and Maine&#x27;s governor, Seldon Connor, appointed Blaine to the now-vacant Senate seat. When the Maine Legislature reconvened that autumn, it confirmed Blaine&#x27;s appointment and elected him to the full six-year term that would begin on March 4, 1877.

== United States Senate, 1876–1881 ==
Blaine was appointed to the Senate on July 10, 1876, but did not begin his duties there until the Senate convened in December of that year. While in the Senate, he served on the Appropriations Committee and held the chairmanship of the Committee on Civil Service and Retrenchment, but he never achieved the role of leadership that he had held as a member of the House. The Senate in the 45th Congress was controlled by a narrow Republican majority, but it was a majority often divided against itself and against the Hayes administration. Blaine did not number himself among the administration&#x27;s defenders—later known as the Half-Breeds—but neither could he join the Republicans led by Conkling—later known as the Stalwarts—who opposed Hayes, because of the deep personal enmity between Blaine and Conkling. He opposed Hayes&#x27;s withdrawal of federal troops from Southern capitals, which effectively ended the Reconstruction of the South, but to no avail. Blaine continued to antagonize Southern Democrats, voting against bills passed in the Democrat-controlled House that would reduce the Army&#x27;s appropriation and repeal the post-war Enforcement Acts he had helped pass. Such bills passed Congress several times and Hayes vetoed them several times; ultimately, the Enforcement Acts remained in place, but the funds to enforce them dwindled. By 1879, there were only 1,155 soldiers stationed in the former Confederacy, and Blaine believed that this small force could never guarantee the civil and political rights of black Southerners—which would mean an end to the Republican party in the South.

On monetary issues, Blaine continued the advocacy for a strong dollar that he had begun as a Representative. This stance was in opposition to Senate Republican leadership, including Senate President Pro Tempore Thomas W. Ferry, who generally supported the greenback movement. The issue had shifted from debate over greenbacks to debate over which metal should back the dollar: gold and silver, or gold alone. The Coinage Act of 1873 stopped the coinage of silver for all coins worth a dollar or more, effectively tying the dollar to the value of gold. As a result, the money supply contracted and the effects of the Panic of 1873 grew worse, making it more expensive for debtors to pay debts they had entered into when currency was less valuable. Farmers and laborers, especially, clamored for the return of coinage in both metals, believing the increased money supply would restore wages and property values. Democratic Representative Richard P. Bland of Missouri proposed a bill, which passed the House, that required the United States to coin as much silver as miners could sell the government, thus increasing the money supply and aiding debtors. In the Senate, William B. Allison, a Republican from Iowa offered an amendment to limit the silver coinage to two to four million dollars per month. This was still too much for Blaine, and he denounced the bill and the proposed amendment, but the amended Bland–Allison Act passed the Senate by a 48 to 21 vote. Hayes vetoed the bill, but Congress mustered the two-thirds vote to pass it over his veto. Even after the Bland–Allison Act&#x27;s passage, Blaine continued his opposition, making a series of speeches against it during the 1878 congressional campaign season.

His time in the Senate allowed Blaine to develop his foreign policy ideas. He advocated expansion of the American navy and merchant marine, which had been in decline since the Civil War. Blaine also bitterly opposed the results of the arbitration with Great Britain over American fishermen&#x27;s right to fish in Canadian waters, which resulted in a $5.5 million award to Britain. Blaine&#x27;s Anglophobia combined with his support of high tariffs. He had initially opposed a reciprocity treaty with Canada that would have reduced tariffs between the two nations, but by the end of his time in the Senate, he had changed his mind, believing that Americans had more to gain by increasing exports than they would lose by the risk of cheap imports.

== 1880 presidential election ==
Hayes had announced early in his presidency that he would not seek another term which meant that the contest for the Republican nomination in 1880 was open to all challengers—including Blaine. Blaine was among the early favorites for the nomination, as were former President Grant, Treasury Secretary John Sherman of Ohio, and Senator George F. Edmunds of Vermont. Although Grant did not actively promote his candidacy, his entry into the race re-energized the Stalwarts and when the convention met in Chicago in June 1880, they instantly polarized the delegates into Grant and anti-Grant factions, with Blaine the most popular choice of the latter group. Blaine was nominated by James Frederick Joy of Michigan, but in contrast to Ingersoll&#x27;s exciting speech of 1876, Joy&#x27;s lengthy oration was remembered only for its maladroitness. After the other candidates were nominated, the first ballot showed Grant leading with 304 votes and Blaine in second with 284; no other candidate had more than Sherman&#x27;s 93, and none had the required majority of 379. Sherman&#x27;s delegates could swing the nomination to either Grant or Blaine, but he refused to release them through twenty-eight ballots in the hope that the anti-Grant forces would desert Blaine and flock to him. Eventually, they did desert Blaine, but instead of Sherman they shifted their votes to Ohio Congressman James A. Garfield, and by the thirty-sixth ballot he had 399 votes, enough for victory.

Garfield placated the Stalwarts by endorsing Chester A. Arthur of New York, a Conkling loyalist, as nominee for vice president, but it was to Blaine and his delegates that Garfield owed his nomination. When Garfield was elected over Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock, he turned to Blaine to guide him in selection of his cabinet and offered him the preeminent position: Secretary of State. Blaine accepted, resigning from the Senate on March 4, 1881.

== Secretary of State, 1881 ==

=== Foreign policy initiatives ===
Blaine saw presiding over the cabinet as a chance to preside over the Washington social scene, as well, and soon ordered construction of a new, larger home near Dupont Circle. Although his foreign policy experience was minimal, Blaine quickly threw himself into his new duties. By 1881, Blaine had completely abandoned his protectionist leanings and now used his position as Secretary of State to promote freer trade, especially within the western hemisphere. His reasons were twofold: firstly, Blaine&#x27;s old fear of British interference in the Americas was undiminished, and he saw increased trade with Latin America as the best way to keep Britain from dominating the region. Secondly, he believed that by encouraging exports, he could increase American prosperity, and by doing so position the Republican party as the author of that prosperity, ensuring continued electoral success. Garfield agreed with his Secretary of State&#x27;s vision and Blaine called for a Pan-American conference in 1882 to mediate disputes among the Latin American nations and to serve as a forum for talks on increasing trade. At the same time, Blaine hoped to negotiate a peace in the War of the Pacific then being fought by Bolivia, Chile, and Peru. Blaine favored a resolution that would not result in Peru yielding any territory, but Chile, which had by 1881 occupied the Peruvian capital, rejected any negotiations that would gain them nothing. Blaine sought to expand American influence in other areas, calling for renegotiation of the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty to allow the United States to construct a canal through Panama without British involvement, as well as attempting to reduce British involvement in the strategically located Kingdom of Hawaii. His plans for the United States&#x27; involvement in the world stretched even beyond the Western Hemisphere, as he sought commercial treaties with Korea and Madagascar.
=== Garfield&#x27;s assassination ===
On July 2, 1881, Blaine and Garfield were walking through the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad in Washington when Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau, a crazed office seeker who had made repeated demands for Blaine and other State Department officials to appoint him to a consulship for which he was grossly unqualified. On May 14, 1881, Guiteau had encountered Blaine just outside the State Department. Guiteau&#x27;s request for a position in the US Consul&#x27;s office in France was met by an angry rebuke from Blaine: &quot;Never speak to me about the Paris Consulship again as long as you live!&quot; 

Guiteau, a self-professed Stalwart, believed that after assassinating the President, he would strike a blow to unite the two factions of the Republican Party, allowing him to ingratiate himself with Vice President Arthur and receive his coveted position. Guiteau was overpowered and arrested immediately, while Garfield lingered for two and a half months before he died on September 19, 1881. Guiteau was convicted of killing Garfield and hanged on June 30, 1882.

Garfield&#x27;s death was not just a personal tragedy for Blaine; it also meant the end of his dominance of the cabinet, and the end of his foreign policy initiatives. With Arthur&#x27;s ascent to the presidency, the Stalwart faction now held sway, and Blaine&#x27;s days at the State Department were numbered. While Arthur asked all of the cabinet members to postpone their resignations until Congress recessed that December, Blaine nonetheless tendered his resignation on October 19, 1881, but he agreed to remain in office until December 19, when his successor would be in place.

Blaine&#x27;s replacement was Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, a New Jersey Stalwart; while Arthur and Frelinghuysen undid much of Blaine&#x27;s work, cancelling the call for a Pan-American conference and stopping the effort to end the War of the Pacific, they did continue the drive for tariff reductions, signing a reciprocity treaty with Mexico in 1882.

=== Private life ===
Blaine began the year 1882 without a political office for the first time since 1859. Troubled by poor health, he sought no employment other than the completion of the first volume of his memoir, &quot;Twenty Years of Congress.&quot; Friends in Maine petitioned Blaine to run for Congress in the 1882 elections, but he declined, preferring to spend his time writing and supervising the move to the new home. His income from mining and railroad investments was sufficient to sustain the family&#x27;s lifestyle and to allow for the construction of a vacation cottage, &quot;Stanwood&quot; on Mount Desert Island, Maine, designed by Frank Furness. Blaine appeared before Congress in 1882 during an investigation into his War of the Pacific diplomacy, defending himself against allegations that he owned an interest in the Peruvian guano deposits being occupied by Chile, but otherwise stayed away from the Capitol. The publication of the first volume of &quot;Twenty Years&quot; in early 1884 added to Blaine&#x27;s financial security and thrust him back into the political spotlight. As the 1884 campaign loomed, Blaine&#x27;s name was being circulated once more as a potential nominee, and despite some reservations, he soon found himself back in the hunt for the presidency.
== 1884 presidential election ==

=== Nomination ===

In the months leading up to the 1884 convention, Blaine was once more considered the favorite for the nomination, but President Arthur was contemplating a run for election in his own right. George Edmunds was again the favored candidate among reformers and John Sherman had a few delegates pledged to him, but neither was expected to command much support at the convention. John A. Logan of Illinois hoped to attract Stalwart votes if Arthur&#x27;s campaign was unsuccessful. Blaine was unsure he wanted to try for the nomination for the third time and even encouraged General William T. Sherman, John Sherman&#x27;s older brother, to accept it if it came to him, but ultimately Blaine agreed to be a candidate again.

William H. West of Ohio nominated Blaine with an enthusiastic speech and after the first ballot, Blaine led the count with 334½ votes. While short of the necessary 417 for nomination, Blaine had far more than any other candidate with Arthur in second place at 278 votes. Blaine was unacceptable to the Arthur delegates just as Blaine&#x27;s own delegates would never vote for the President, so the contest was between the two for the delegates of the remaining candidates. Blaine&#x27;s total steadily increased as Logan and Sherman withdrew in his favor and some of the Edmunds delegates defected to him. Unlike in previous conventions, the momentum for Blaine in 1884 would not be halted. On the fourth ballot, Blaine received 541 votes and was, at last, nominated. Logan was named vice presidential nominee on the first ballot, and the Republicans had their ticket.

=== Campaign against Cleveland ===
The Democrats held their convention in Chicago the following month and nominated Governor Grover Cleveland of New York. Cleveland&#x27;s time on the national scene was brief, but Democrats hoped that his reputation as a reformer and an opponent of corruption would attract Republicans dissatisfied with Blaine and his reputation for scandal. They were correct, as reform-minded Republicans (called &quot;Mugwumps&quot;) denounced Blaine as corrupt and flocked to Cleveland. The Mugwumps, including such men as Carl Schurz and Henry Ward Beecher, were more concerned with morality than with party, and felt Cleveland was a kindred soul who would promote civil service reform and fight for efficiency in government. However, even as the Democrats gained support from the Mugwumps, they lost some blue-collar workers to the Greenback Party, led by Benjamin F. Butler, Blaine&#x27;s antagonist from their early days in the House.

The campaign focused on the candidates&#x27; personalities, as each candidate&#x27;s supporters cast aspersions on their opponents. Cleveland&#x27;s supporters rehashed the old allegations from the Mulligan letters that Blaine had corruptly influenced legislation in favor of railroads, later profiting on the sale of bonds he owned in both companies. Although the stories of Blaine&#x27;s favors to the railroads had made the rounds eight years earlier, this time more of his correspondence was discovered, making his earlier denials less plausible. Blaine acknowledged that the letters were genuine, but denied that anything in them impugned his integrity or contradicted his earlier explanations. Nevertheless, what Blaine described as &quot;stale slander&quot; served to focus the public&#x27;s attention negatively on his character. On some of the most damaging correspondence, Blaine had written &quot;Burn this letter,&quot; giving Democrats the last line to their rallying cry: &quot;Blaine, Blaine, James G. Blaine, the continental liar from the state of Maine, &#x27;Burn this letter!&#x27;&quot;

To counter Cleveland&#x27;s image of superior morality, Republicans discovered reports that Cleveland had fathered an illegitimate child while he was a lawyer in Buffalo, New York, and chanted &quot;Ma, Ma, where&#x27;s my Pa?&quot;—to which the Democrats, after Cleveland had been elected, appended, &quot;Gone to the White House, Ha! Ha! Ha!&quot; Cleveland admitted to paying child support in 1874 to Maria Crofts Halpin, the woman who claimed he fathered her child named Oscar Folsom Cleveland. Halpin was involved with several men at the time, including Cleveland&#x27;s friend and law partner, Oscar Folsom, for whom the child was also named. Cleveland did not know which man was the father, and is believed to have assumed responsibility because he was the only bachelor among them. At the same time, Democratic operatives accused Blaine and his wife of not having been married when their eldest son, Stanwood, was born in 1851; this rumor was false, however, and caused little excitement in the campaign. Halpin disputed the claims of being involved with several men, accusing Cleveland of raping and impregnating her, then institutionalizing her against her will to gain control of their child.

Both candidates believed that the states of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut would determine the election. In New York, Blaine received less support than he anticipated when Arthur and Conkling, still powerful in the New York Republican party, failed to actively campaign for him. Blaine hoped that he would have more support from Irish Americans than Republicans typically did; while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century, Blaine&#x27;s mother was Irish Catholic, and he believed his career-long opposition to the British government would resonate with the Irish. Blaine&#x27;s hope for Irish defections to the Republican standard were dashed late in the campaign when one of his supporters, Samuel D. Burchard, gave a speech denouncing the Democrats as the party of &quot;Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.&quot; The Democrats spread the word of this insult in the days before the election, and Cleveland narrowly won all four of the swing states, including New York by just over one thousand votes. While the popular vote total was close, with Cleveland winning by just one-quarter of a percent, the electoral votes gave Cleveland a majority of 219–182.

== Party leader in exile ==
Blaine accepted his narrow defeat and spent most of the next year working on the second volume of &quot;Twenty Years of Congress.&quot; The book continued to earn him enough money to support his lavish household and pay off his debts. Although he spoke to friends of retiring from politics, Blaine still attended dinners and commented on the Cleveland administration&#x27;s policies. By the time of the 1886 Congressional elections, Blaine was giving speeches and promoting Republican candidates, especially in his home state of Maine. Republicans were successful in Maine, and after the Maine elections in September, Blaine went on a speaking tour from Pennsylvania to Tennessee, hoping to boost the prospects of Republican candidates there. Republicans were less successful nationwide, gaining seats in the House while losing seats in the Senate, but Blaine&#x27;s speeches kept him and his opinions in the spotlight.

Blaine and his wife and daughters sailed for Europe in June 1887, visiting England, Ireland, Germany, France, Austria-Hungary, and finally Scotland, where they stayed at the summer home of Andrew Carnegie. While in France, Blaine wrote a letter to the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; criticizing Cleveland&#x27;s plans to reduce the tariff, saying that free trade with Europe would impoverish American workers and farmers. The family returned to the United States in August 1887. His letter in the &quot;Tribune&quot; had raised his political profile even higher, and by 1888 Theodore Roosevelt and Henry Cabot Lodge, both former opponents, urged Blaine to run against Cleveland again. Opinion within the party was overwhelmingly in favor of renominating Blaine.

As the state conventions drew nearer, Blaine announced that he would not be a candidate. His supporters doubted his sincerity and continued to encourage him to run, but Blaine still demurred. Hoping to make his intentions clear, Blaine left the country and was staying with Carnegie in Scotland when the 1888 Republican National Convention began in Chicago. Carnegie encouraged Blaine to accept if the convention nominated him, but the delegates finally accepted Blaine&#x27;s refusal. John Sherman was the most prominent candidate and sought to attract the Blaine supporters to his candidacy, but instead found them flocking to former senator Benjamin Harrison of Indiana after a telegram from Carnegie suggested that Blaine favored him. Blaine returned to the United States in August 1888 and visited Harrison at his home in October, where twenty-five thousand residents paraded in Blaine&#x27;s honor. Harrison defeated Cleveland in a close election, and offered Blaine his former position as Secretary of State.

== Secretary of State, 1889–1892 ==

Harrison had developed his foreign policy based largely on Blaine&#x27;s ideas, and at the start of his term, Harrison and Blaine had very similar views on the United States&#x27; place in the world. In spite of their shared worldview, however, the two men became personally unfriendly as the term went on. Harrison was conscious that his Secretary of State was more popular than he, and while he admired Blaine&#x27;s gift for diplomacy, he grew displeased with Blaine&#x27;s frequent absence from his post because of illness, and suspected that Blaine was angling for the presidential nomination in 1892. Harrison tried to limit how many &quot;Blaine men&quot; filled subordinate positions in the State Department and denied Blaine&#x27;s request that his son, Walker, be appointed First Assistant Secretary, instead naming him Solicitor of the Department of State. Despite the growing personal rancor, the two men continued, with one exception, to agree on the foreign policy questions of the day.

=== Pacific diplomacy ===
Blaine and Harrison wished to see American power and trade expanded across the Pacific and were especially interested in securing rights to harbors in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and Pago Pago, Samoa. When Blaine entered office, the United States, Great Britain, and the German Empire were disputing their respective rights in Samoa. Thomas F. Bayard, Blaine&#x27;s predecessor, had accepted an invitation to a three-party conference in Berlin aimed at resolving the dispute, and Blaine appointed American representatives to attend. The result was a treaty that created a condominium among the three powers, allowing all of them access to the harbor.

In Hawaii, Blaine worked to bind the kingdom more closely to the United States and to avoid its becoming a British protectorate. When the McKinley Tariff of 1890 eliminated the duty on sugar, Hawaiian sugar-growers looked for a way to retain their once-exclusive access to the American market. The Hawaiian minister to the United States, Henry A. P. Carter, tried to arrange for Hawaii to have complete trade reciprocity with the United States, but Blaine proposed instead that Hawaii become an American protectorate; Carter favored the idea, but the Hawaiian king, Kalākaua, rejected the infringement on his sovereignty. Blaine next procured the appointment of his former newspaper colleague John L. Stevens as minister to Hawaii. Stevens had long believed that the United States should annex Hawaii, and as minister he co-operated with Americans living in Hawaii in their efforts to bring about annexation. Their efforts ultimately culminated in a coup d&#x27;état against Kalākaua&#x27;s successor, Liliuokalani, in 1893. Blaine&#x27;s precise involvement is undocumented, but the results of Stevens&#x27; diplomacy were in accord with his ambitions for American power in the region. The new government petitioned the United States for annexation, but by that time Blaine was no longer in office.

=== Latin America and reciprocity ===
Soon after taking office, Blaine revived his old idea of an international conference of Western hemisphere nations. The result was the First International Conference of American States, which met in Washington in 1890. Blaine and Harrison had high hopes for the conference, including proposals for a customs union, a pan-American railroad line, and an arbitration process to settle disputes among member nations. Their overall goal was to extend trade and political influence over the entire hemisphere; some of the other nations understood this and were wary of deepening ties with the United States to the exclusion of European powers. Blaine said publicly that his only interest was in &quot;annexation of trade,&quot; not annexation of territory, but privately he wrote to Harrison of a desire for some territorial enlargement of the United States:

Congress was not as enthusiastic about a customs union as Blaine and Harrison were, but tariff reciprocity provisions were ultimately included in the McKinley Tariff that reduced duties on some inter-American trade. Otherwise, the conference achieved none of Blaine&#x27;s goals in the short-term, but did lead to further communication and what would eventually become the Organization of American States.

In 1891, a diplomatic crisis arose in Chile that drove a wedge between Harrison and Blaine. The American minister to Chile, Patrick Egan, a political friend of Blaine&#x27;s, granted asylum to Chileans who were seeking refuge from the Chilean Civil War. Chile was already suspicious of Blaine because of his War of the Pacific diplomacy ten years earlier, and this incident raised tensions even further. When sailors from the &quot;Baltimore&quot; took shore leave in Valparaíso, a fight broke out, resulting in the deaths of two American sailors and three dozen arrested. When the news reached Washington, Blaine was in Bar Harbor recuperating from a bout of ill health and Harrison himself drafted a demand for reparations. The Chilean foreign minister, Manuel Antonio Matta, replied that Harrison&#x27;s message was &quot;erroneous or deliberately incorrect&quot; and said that the Chilean government was treating the affair the same as any other criminal matter. Tensions increased as Harrison threatened to break off diplomatic relations unless the United States received a suitable apology. Blaine returned to the capital and made conciliatory overtures to the Chilean government, offering to submit the dispute to arbitration and recall Egan. Harrison still insisted on an apology and submitted a special message to Congress about the threat of war. Chile issued an apology for the incident, and the threat of war subsided.

=== Relations with European powers ===

Blaine&#x27;s earliest expressions in the foreign policy sphere were those of a reactionary Anglophobe, but by the end of his career his relationship with the United Kingdom had become more moderate and nuanced. A dispute over seal hunting in the waters off Alaska was the cause of Blaine&#x27;s first interaction with Britain as Harrison&#x27;s Secretary of State. A law passed in 1889 required Harrison to ban seal hunting in Alaskan waters, but Canadian fishermen believed they had the right to continue fishing there. Soon thereafter, the United States Navy seized several Canadian ships near the Pribilof Islands. Blaine entered into negotiations with Britain and the two nations agreed to submit the dispute to arbitration by a neutral tribunal. Blaine was no longer in office when the tribunal began its work, but the result was to allow the hunting once more, albeit with some regulation, and to require the United States to pay damages of $473,151. Ultimately, the nations signed the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911, which outlawed open-water seal hunting.

At the same time as the Pribilof Islands dispute, an outbreak of mob violence in New Orleans became an international incident. After New Orleans police chief David Hennessy led a crackdown against local mafiosi, he was assassinated on October 14, 1890. After the alleged murderers were found not guilty on March 14, 1891, a mob stormed the jail and lynched eleven of them. Since many of those killed were Italian citizens the Italian minister, Saverio Fava, protested to Blaine. Blaine explained that federal officials could not control how state officials deal with criminal matters, and Fava announced that he would withdraw the legation back to Italy. Blaine and Harrison believed the Italians&#x27; response to be an overreaction, and did nothing. Tensions slowly cooled, and after nearly a year, the Italian minister returned to the United States to negotiate an indemnity. After some internal dispute—Blaine wanted conciliation with Italy, Harrison was reluctant to admit fault—the United States agreed to pay an indemnity of $25,000, and normal diplomatic relations resumed.

== Retirement and death ==

Blaine had always believed his health to be fragile, and by the time he joined Harrison&#x27;s cabinet he truly was unwell. The years at the State Department also brought Blaine personal tragedy as two of his children, Walker and Alice, died suddenly in 1890. Another son, Emmons, died in 1892. With these family losses and his declining health, Blaine decided to retire and announced that he would resign from the cabinet on June 4, 1892. Because of their growing animosity, and because Blaine&#x27;s resignation came three days before the 1892 Republican National Convention began, Harrison suspected that Blaine was preparing to run against him for the party&#x27;s nomination for president.

Harrison was unpopular with the party and the country, and many of Blaine&#x27;s old supporters encouraged him to run for the nomination. Blaine had denied any interest in the nomination months before his resignation, but some of his friends, including Senator Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania and James S. Clarkson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, took it for false modesty and worked for his nomination anyway. When Blaine resigned from the cabinet, his boosters were certain that he was a candidate, but the majority of the party stood by the incumbent. Harrison was renominated on the first ballot, but die-hard Blaine delegates still gave their champion 182 and 1/6 votes, good enough for second place.

Blaine spent the summer of 1892 at his Bar Harbor cottage, and did not involve himself in the presidential campaign other than to make a single speech in New York in October. Harrison was defeated soundly in his rematch against former president Cleveland and when Blaine returned to Washington at the close of 1892, he and Harrison were friendlier than they had been in years. Blaine&#x27;s health declined rapidly in the winter of 1892–1893, and he died in his Washington home on January 27, 1893, four days before turning sixty-three. After a funeral at the Presbyterian Church of the Covenant, he was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington. He was later re-interred in Blaine Memorial Park, Augusta, Maine, in 1920.

== Legacy ==
A towering figure in the Republican party of his day, Blaine fell into obscurity fairly soon after his death. A 1905 biography by his wife&#x27;s cousin, Edward Stanwood, was written when the question was still in doubt, but by the time David Saville Muzzey published his biography of Blaine in 1934, the subtitle &quot;A Political Idol of Other Days&quot; already spoke to its subject&#x27;s fading place in the popular mind, perhaps because of the nine men the Republican Party nominated for the presidency from 1860 to 1912, Blaine is the only one who never became president. Although several authors studied Blaine&#x27;s foreign policy career, including Edward P. Crapol&#x27;s 2000 work, Muzzey&#x27;s was the last full-scale biography of the man until Neil Rolde&#x27;s 2006 book. Historian R. Hal Williams was working on a new biography of Blaine, tentatively titled &quot;James G. Blaine: A Life in Politics&quot;, until his death in 2016.

During the 2016 United States presidential election, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were compared to Blaine for their controversies. Blaine&#x27;s status as a former Secretary of State who sought to erase evidence of his personal corruption drew parallels to Clinton, while his appeals to anti-Chinese sentiment were compared to Trump&#x27;s anti-Muslim rhetoric. Similarly, the Mugwumps who opposed Blaine in 1884 have been compared to the Never Trump movement.

<text>Justinian I (, ; 48214 November 565), also known as Justinian the Great, was the Roman emperor from 527 to 565.

His reign was marked by the ambitious but only partly realized &quot;renovatio imperii&quot;, or &quot;restoration of the Empire&quot;. This ambition was expressed by the partial recovery of the territories of the defunct Western Roman Empire. His general, Belisarius, swiftly conquered the Vandal Kingdom in North Africa. Subsequently, Belisarius, Narses, and other generals conquered the Ostrogothic Kingdom, restoring Dalmatia, Sicily, Italy, and Rome to the empire after more than half a century of rule by the Ostrogoths. The praetorian prefect Liberius reclaimed the south of the Iberian Peninsula, establishing the province of Spania. These campaigns re-established Roman control over the western Mediterranean, increasing the Empire&#x27;s annual revenue by over a million &quot;solidi&quot;. During his reign, Justinian also subdued the &quot;Tzani&quot;, a people on the east coast of the Black Sea that had never been under Roman rule before. He engaged the Sasanian Empire in the east during Kavad I&#x27;s reign, and later again during Khosrow I&#x27;s reign; this second conflict was partially initiated due to his ambitions in the west.

Justinian is regarded as one of the most prominent and influential Roman emperors, and historians have often characterized him as a workaholic who worked tirelessly to expand the Byzantine Empire. One of the most enduring aspects of his legacy was the uniform rewriting of Roman law, the , which was first applied throughout Continental Europe and is still the basis of civil law in many modern states. His reign also marked a blossoming of Byzantine culture, and his building program yielded works such as the Hagia Sophia.

==Life==
Justinian was born in Tauresium, Dardania, probably in 482. A native speaker of Latin (possibly the last Roman emperor to be one), he came from a peasant family thought to have been of either of Illyro-Roman or Thraco-Roman origin. The name &quot;Iustinianus&quot;, which he took later, is indicative of adoption by his uncle Justin. During his reign, he founded Justiniana Prima not far from his birthplace. His mother was Vigilantia, the sister of Justin. Justin, who was commander of one of the imperial guard units (the Excubitors) before he became emperor, adopted Justinian, brought him to Constantinople, and ensured the boy&#x27;s education. As a result, Justinian was well educated in jurisprudence, theology, and Roman history. Justinian served as a &quot;candidatus&quot;, one of 40 men selected from the &quot;scholae palatinae&quot; to serve as the emperor&#x27;s personal bodyguard. The chronicler John Malalas, who lived during the reign of Justinian, describes his appearance as short, fair-skinned, curly-haired, round-faced, and handsome, with receding hairline and greying hair and beard. Another contemporary historian, Procopius, describing him in similar terms, compares Justinian&#x27;s appearance to that of Emperor Domitian.

When Emperor Anastasius died in 518, Justin was proclaimed the new emperor with significant help from Justinian. Justinian showed a lot of ambition, and several sources claim that he was functioning as virtual regent long before Justin made him associate emperor, although there is no conclusive evidence of this. As Justin became senile near the end of his reign, Justinian became the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler. Following the general Vitalian&#x27;s assassination in 520 (orchestrated by Justinian or Justin), Justinian was appointed consul and commander of the army of the east. Justinian remained Justin&#x27;s close confidant, and in 525 was granted the titles of &quot;nobilissimus&quot; and &quot;caesar&quot; (heir-apparent). He was crowned co-emperor on 1 April 527, and became sole ruler after Justin&#x27;s death on 1 August 527.

As a ruler, Justinian showed great energy. He was known as &quot;the emperor who never sleeps&quot; for his work habits. Nevertheless, he seems to have been amiable and easy to approach. Around 525, he married his mistress, Theodora, in Constantinople. She was by profession an actress and some twenty years his junior. In earlier times, Justinian could not have married her owing to her class, but his uncle, Emperor Justin I, had passed a law lifting restrictions on marriages with ex-actresses. Though the marriage caused a scandal, Theodora would become very influential in the politics of the Empire. Other talented individuals included Tribonian, his legal adviser; Peter the Patrician, the diplomat and long-time head of the palace bureaucracy; Justinian&#x27;s finance ministers John the Cappadocian and Peter Barsymes, who managed to collect taxes more efficiently than any before, thereby funding Justinian&#x27;s wars; and finally, his generals, Belisarius and Narses, responsible for the re-conquest of North Africa and Italy.

Justinian&#x27;s rule was not universally popular; early in his reign he nearly lost his throne during the Nika riots, and a conspiracy against the emperor&#x27;s life by dissatisfied entrepreneurs was discovered as late as 562. Justinian was struck by the plague in the early 540s but recovered. Theodora died in 548 at a relatively young age, possibly of cancer; Justinian outlived her by nearly twenty years. Justinian, who had always had a keen interest in theological matters and actively participated in debates on Christian doctrine, became even more devoted to religion during the later years of his life. He died on 14 November 565, childless. He was succeeded by Justin II, who was the son of his sister Vigilantia and married to Sophia, the niece of Theodora. Justinian&#x27;s body was entombed in a specially built mausoleum in the Church of the Holy Apostles until it was desecrated and robbed during the pillage of the city in 1204 by the Latin States of the Fourth Crusade.

==Reign==
===Legislative activities===

Justinian remains well-known for his judicial reforms, particularly through the complete revision of all Roman law, something that had not previously been attempted. The total of Justinian&#x27;s legislation is known today as the . It consists of the &quot;Codex Justinianeus,&quot; the &quot;Digesta&quot; or &quot;Pandectae&quot;, the &quot;Institutiones&quot;, and the &quot;Novellae&quot;.

Early in his reign, Justinian had appointed the &quot;quaestor&quot; Tribonian to oversee this task. The first draft of the &quot;Codex Justinianeus&quot;, a codification of imperial constitutions from the 2nd century onward, was issued on 7 April 529. (The final version appeared in 534.) It was followed by the &quot;Digesta&quot; (or &quot;Pandectae&quot;), a compilation of older legal texts, in 533, and by the &quot;Institutiones&quot;, a textbook explaining the principles of law. The &quot;Novellae&quot;, a collection of new laws issued during Justinian&#x27;s reign, supplements the &quot;Corpus&quot;. As opposed to the rest of the corpus, the &quot;Novellae&quot; appeared in Greek, the common language of the Eastern Empire.

The &quot;Corpus&quot; forms the basis of Latin jurisprudence (including ecclesiastical Canon Law) and, for historians, provides a valuable insight into the concerns and activities of the later Roman Empire. As a collection it gathers together the many sources in which the &quot;leges&quot; (laws) and the other rules were expressed or published: proper laws, senatorial consults (&quot;senatusconsulta&quot;), imperial decrees, case law, and jurists&#x27; opinions and interpretations (&quot;responsa prudentium&quot;).
Tribonian&#x27;s code ensured the survival of Roman law. It formed the basis of later Byzantine law, as expressed in the &quot;Basilika&quot; of Basil I and Leo VI the Wise. The only western province where the Justinianic code was introduced was Italy (after the conquest by the so-called Pragmatic Sanction of 554), from where it was to pass to Western Europe in the 12th century and become the basis of much Continental European law code, which was eventually spread by European empires to the Americas and beyond in the Age of Discovery. It eventually passed to Eastern Europe where it appeared in Slavic editions, and it also passed on to Russia. It remains influential to this day.

His legislations restricted avenues of divorce, including divorce by mutual consent. The latter was overturned by his immediate successor, Justin II.

He passed laws to protect prostitutes from exploitation and women from being forced into prostitution. Rapists were treated severely. Further, by his policies: women charged with major crimes should be guarded by other women to prevent sexual abuse; if a woman was widowed, her dowry should be returned; and a husband could not take on a major debt without his wife giving her consent twice.

Family legislation also revealed a greater concern for the interests of children. This was particularly so with respect to children born out of wedlock. The law under Justinian also reveals a striking interest in child neglect issues. Justinian protected the rights of children whose parents remarried and produced more offspring, or who simply separated and abandoned their offspring, forcing them to beg.

He passed legislations directed against the Christian &quot;heretics&quot;, pagans, Jews and Samaritans, forbidding them from holding public office, destroying their places of worship and restricting the ownership of property.

Justinian discontinued the regular appointment of Consuls in 541.

In Constantinople, under Justinian, hospitals were built and free medical care provided to the many poor residents of the city. In addition, public baths were free for all residents and 20 state bakeries provided free bread to those who needed it.

===Nika riots===

In January 532, partisans of the chariot racing factions in Constantinople, normally rivals, united against Justinian in a revolt that has become known as the Nika riots. They forced him to dismiss Tribonian and two of his other ministers, and then attempted to overthrow Justinian himself and replace him with the senator Hypatius, who was a nephew of the late emperor Anastasius. While the crowd was rioting in the streets, Justinian considered fleeing the capital by sea, but eventually decided to stay, apparently on the prompting of his wife Theodora, who refused to leave. In the next two days, he ordered the brutal suppression of the riots by his generals Belisarius and Mundus. Procopius relates that 30,000 unarmed civilians were killed in the Hippodrome. Justinian had Anastasius&#x27; nephews executed.

The destruction that took place during the revolt provided Justinian with an opportunity to carry out his building program in Constantinople, most notably the architectural innovation of the domed Hagia Sophia.

===Military activities===
Justinian&#x27;s reign was marked by the recovery of large stretches of land around the Western Mediterranean basin that had slipped out of imperial control in the 5th century. Although he never personally took part in military campaigns, he boasted of his successes in the prefaces to his laws and had them commemorated in art. The re-conquests were in large part carried out by his general Belisarius.

====War with the Sassanid Empire, 527–532====

From his uncle, Justinian inherited ongoing hostilities with the Sassanid Empire. In 530 the Persian forces suffered a double defeat at Dara and Satala, but the next year saw the defeat of Roman forces under Belisarius near Callinicum. Justinian then tried to make alliance with the Axumites of Ethiopia and the Himyarites of Yemen against the Persians, but this failed. When king Kavadh I of Persia died (September 531), Justinian concluded an &quot;Eternal Peace&quot; (which cost him 11,000 pounds of gold) with his successor Khosrau I (532). Having thus secured his eastern frontier, Justinian turned his attention to the West, where Germanic kingdoms had been established in the territories of the former Western Roman Empire.

====Conquest of North Africa, 533–534====
The first of the western kingdoms Justinian attacked was that of the Vandals in North Africa. King Hilderic, who had maintained good relations with Justinian and the North African Catholic clergy, had been overthrown by his cousin Gelimer in 530 AD. Imprisoned, the deposed king appealed to Justinian. Justinian protested Gelimer&#x27;s actions, demanding that Gelimer return the kingdom to Hilderic. Gelimer replied, in effect, that Justinian had no authority to make these demands. Angered at this response, Justinian quickly concluded his ongoing war with the Sassanian Empire and prepared an expedition against the Vandals in 533.

In 533, Belisarius sailed to Africa with a fleet of 92 dromons, escorting 500 transports carrying an army of about 15,000 men, as well as a number of barbarian troops. They landed at Caput Vada (modern Ras Kaboudia) in modern Tunisia. They defeated the Vandals, who were caught completely off guard, at Ad Decimum on 14 September 533 and Tricamarum in December; Belisarius took Carthage. King Gelimer fled to Mount Pappua in Numidia, but surrendered the next spring. He was taken to Constantinople, where he was paraded in a triumph. Sardinia and Corsica, the Balearic Islands, and the stronghold Septem Fratres near Mons Calpe (later named Gibraltar) were recovered in the same campaign.

In this war, the contemporary Procopius remarks that Africa was so entirely depopulated that a person might travel several days without meeting a human being, and he adds, &quot;it is no exaggeration to say, that in the course of the war 5,000,000 perished by the sword, and famine, and pestilence.&quot; An African prefecture, centred in Carthage, was established in April 534, but it would teeter on the brink of collapse during the next 15 years, amidst warfare with the Moors and military mutinies. By the mid-540s, under a succession of Byzantine generals, the region was disrupted under civil war, plague and military campaigning. The area was not completely pacified until 548, but remained peaceful thereafter and enjoyed a measure of prosperity. The recovery of Africa cost the empire about 100,000 pounds of gold.

====War in Italy, first phase, 535–540====

As in Africa, dynastic struggles in Ostrogothic Italy provided an opportunity for intervention. The young king Athalaric had died on 2 October 534, and a usurper, Theodahad, had imprisoned queen Amalasuintha, Theodoric&#x27;s daughter and mother of Athalaric, on the island of Martana in Lake Bolsena, where he had her assassinated in 535. Thereupon Belisarius, with 7,500 men, invaded Sicily (535) and advanced into Italy, sacking Naples and capturing Rome on 9 December 536. By that time Theodahad had been deposed by the Ostrogothic army, who had elected Vitigis as their new king. He gathered a large army and besieged Rome from February 537 to March 538 without being able to retake the city.

Justinian sent another general, Narses, to Italy, but tensions between Narses and Belisarius hampered the progress of the campaign. Milan was taken, but was soon recaptured and razed by the Ostrogoths. Justinian recalled Narses in 539. By then the military situation had turned in favour of the Romans, and in 540 Belisarius reached the Ostrogothic capital Ravenna. There he was offered the title of Western Roman Emperor by the Ostrogoths at the same time that envoys of Justinian were arriving to negotiate a peace that would leave the region north of the Po River in Gothic hands. Belisarius feigned acceptance of the offer, entered the city in May 540, and reclaimed it for the Empire. Then, having been recalled by Justinian, Belisarius returned to Constantinople, taking the captured Vitigis and his wife Matasuntha with him.

====War with the Sassanid Empire, 540–562====

Belisarius had been recalled in the face of renewed hostilities by the Persians. Following a revolt against the Empire in Armenia in the late 530s and possibly motivated by the pleas of Ostrogothic ambassadors, King Khosrau I broke the &quot;Eternal Peace&quot; and invaded Roman territory in the spring of 540. He first sacked Beroea and then Antioch (allowing the garrison of 6,000 men to leave the city), besieged Daras, and then went on to attack the Byzantine base in the small but strategically significant satellite kingdom of Lazica near the Black Sea as requested by its discontented king Gubazes, exacting tribute from the towns he passed along his way. He forced Justinian I to pay him 5,000 pounds of gold, plus 500 pounds of gold more each year.

Belisarius arrived in the East in 541, but after some success, was again recalled to Constantinople in 542. The reasons for his withdrawal are not known, but it may have been instigated by rumours of his disloyalty reaching the court. 
The outbreak of the plague coupled with a rebellion in Persia brought Khosrow I&#x27;s offensives to a halt. Exploiting this, Justinian ordered all the forces in the East to invade Persian Armenia, but the 30,000-strong Byzantine force was defeated by a small force at Anglon. The next year, Khosrau unsuccessfully besieged the major city of Edessa. Both parties made little headway, and in 545 a truce was agreed upon for the southern part of the Roman-Persian frontier. After that, the Lazic War in the North continued for several years: the Lazic king switched to the Byzantine side, and in 549 Justinian sent Dagisthaeus to recapture Petra, but he faced heavy resistance and the siege was relieved by Sasanian reinforcements. Justinian replaced him with Bessas, who was under a cloud after the loss of Rome in 546, but he managed to capture and dismantle Petra in 551. The war continued for several years until a second truce in 557, followed by a fifty years&#x27; peace in 562. Under its terms, the Persians agreed to abandon Lazica in exchange for an annual tribute of 400 or 500 pounds of gold (30,000 &quot;solidi&quot;) to be paid by the Romans.

====War in Italy, second phase, 541–554====
While military efforts were directed to the East, the situation in Italy took a turn for the worse. Under their respective kings Ildibad and Eraric (both murdered in 541) and especially Totila, the Ostrogoths made quick gains. After a victory at Faenza in 542, they reconquered the major cities of Southern Italy and soon held almost the entire Italian Peninsula. Belisarius was sent back to Italy late in 544 but lacked sufficient troops and supplies. Making no headway, he was relieved of his command in 548. Belisarius succeeded in defeating a Gothic fleet of 200 ships. During this period the city of Rome changed hands three more times, first taken and depopulated by the Ostrogoths in December 546, then reconquered by the Byzantines in 547, and then again by the Goths in January 550. Totila also plundered Sicily and attacked Greek coastlines.

Finally, Justinian dispatched a force of approximately 35,000 men (2,000 men were detached and sent to invade southern Visigothic Hispania) under the command of Narses. The army reached Ravenna in June 552 and defeated the Ostrogoths decisively within a month at the battle of Busta Gallorum in the Apennines, where Totila was slain. After a second battle at Mons Lactarius in October that year, the resistance of the Ostrogoths was finally broken. In 554, a large-scale Frankish invasion was defeated at Casilinum, and Italy was secured for the empire, though it would take Narses several years to reduce the remaining Gothic strongholds. At the end of the war, Italy was garrisoned with an army of 16,000 men. The recovery of Italy cost the empire about 300,000 pounds of gold. Procopius estimated 15,000,000 Goths died.

====Other campaigns====
In addition to the other conquests, the Empire established a presence in Visigothic Hispania, when the usurper Athanagild requested assistance in his rebellion against King Agila I. In 552, Justinian dispatched a force of 2,000 men; according to the historian Jordanes, this army was led by the octogenarian Liberius. The Byzantines took Cartagena and other cities on the southeastern coast and founded the new province of Spania before being checked by their former ally Athanagild, who had by now become king. This campaign marked the apogee of Byzantine expansion.

During Justinian&#x27;s reign, the Balkans suffered from several incursions by the Turkic and Slavic peoples who lived north of the Danube. Here, Justinian resorted mainly to a combination of diplomacy and a system of defensive works. In 559 a particularly dangerous invasion of Sklavinoi and Kutrigurs under their khan Zabergan threatened Constantinople, but they were repulsed by the aged general Belisarius.

====Results====
Justinian&#x27;s ambition for re-conquest was only partly realized, with the only lasting and sustainable conquest being Africa. In the West, the early military successes of the 530s were followed by years of stagnation. The dragging war with the Goths was a disaster for Italy, even though its long-lasting effects may have been less severe than is sometimes thought. The heavy taxes that the administration imposed upon Italian population were deeply resented.

The final victory in Italy and the conquest of Africa and the coast of southern Hispania significantly enlarged the area of Byzantine influence and eliminated all naval threats to the empire, which in 555 reached its territorial zenith. Despite losing much of Italy soon after Justinian&#x27;s death, the empire retained several important cities, including Rome, Naples, and Ravenna, leaving the Lombards as a regional threat. The newly founded province of Spania kept the Visigoths as a threat to Hispania alone and not to the western Mediterranean and Africa.

Events of the later years of his reign showed that Constantinople itself was not safe from barbarian incursions from the north, and even the relatively benevolent historian Menander Protector felt the need to attribute the Emperor&#x27;s failure to protect the capital to the weakness of his body in his old age. Some historians view that in his efforts to renew the Roman Empire, Justinian dangerously stretched its resources while failing to take into account the changed realities of 6th-century Europe.

===Religious activities===
Justinian saw the orthodoxy of his empire threatened by diverging religious currents, especially monophysitism, which had many adherents in the eastern provinces of Syria and Egypt. Monophysite doctrine, which maintains that Jesus Christ had one divine nature rather than a synthesis of divine and human nature, had been condemned as a heresy by the Council of Chalcedon in 451, and the tolerant policies towards Monophysitism of Zeno and Anastasius I had been a source of tension in the relationship with the bishops of Rome.

Justin reversed this trend and confirmed the Chalcedonian doctrine, openly condemning the Monophysites. Justinian, who continued this policy, tried to impose religious unity on his subjects by forcing them to accept doctrinal compromises that might appeal to all parties, a policy that proved unsuccessful as he satisfied none of them.

Near the end of his life, Justinian became ever more inclined towards the Monophysite doctrine, especially in the form of Aphthartodocetism, but he died before being able to issue any legislation. The empress Theodora sympathized with the Monophysites and is said to have been a constant source of pro-Monophysite intrigues at the court in Constantinople in the earlier years. In the course of his reign, Justinian, who had a genuine interest in matters of theology, authored a small number of theological treatises.

====Religious policy====

As in his secular administration, despotism appeared also in the Emperor&#x27;s ecclesiastical policy. At the very beginning of his reign, he promulgated by law the Church&#x27;s belief in the Trinity and the Incarnation, and to threaten all heretics with the appropriate penalties, whereas he subsequently declared that he intended to deprive all disturbers of orthodoxy of the opportunity for such offense by due process of law. He made the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan creed the sole symbol of the Church and accorded legal force to the canons of the four ecumenical councils. The bishops in attendance at the Council of Constantinople (536) recognized that nothing could be done in the Church contrary to the emperor&#x27;s will and command, while, on his side, the emperor, in the case of the Patriarch Anthimus, reinforced the ban of the Church with temporal proscription. Justinian protected the purity of the church by suppressing heretics. He neglected no opportunity to secure the rights of the Church and clergy, and to protect and extend monasticism. He granted the monks the right to inherit property from private citizens and the right to receive &quot;solemnia&quot;, or annual gifts, from the imperial treasury or from the taxes of certain provinces and he prohibited lay confiscation of monastic estates.

Both the &quot;Codex&quot; and the &quot;Novellae&quot; contain many enactments regarding donations, foundations, and the administration of ecclesiastical property; election and rights of bishops, priests and abbots; monastic life, residential obligations of the clergy, conduct of divine service, episcopal jurisdiction, etc. Justinian also rebuilt the Church of Hagia Sophia (which cost 20,000 pounds of gold), the original site having been destroyed during the Nika riots. The new Hagia Sophia, with its numerous chapels and shrines, gilded octagonal dome, and mosaics, became the Eastern Roman Empire&#x27;s space of identification.

====Religious relations with Rome====

Justinian entered the arena of ecclesiastical conflicts shortly after his uncle&#x27;s accession in 518, and put an end to the Acacian schism. Previous Emperors had tried to alleviate theological conflicts by declarations that deemphasized the Council of Chalcedon, which had condemned monophysitism, which had strongholds in Egypt and Syria, and by tolerating the appointment of Monophysites to church offices. The Popes reacted by severing ties with the Patriarch of Constantinople who supported these policies. Emperors Justin I (and later Justinian himself) rescinded these policies and re-established the union between Constantinople and Rome. After this, Justinian also felt entitled to settle disputes in papal elections, as he did when he favored Vigilius and had his rival Silverius deported.

This new-found unity between East and West did not, however, solve the ongoing disputes in the east. Justinian&#x27;s policies switched between attempts to force Monophysites to accept the Chalcedonian creed by persecuting their bishops and monks – thereby embittering their sympathizers in Egypt and other provinces – and attempts at a compromise that would win over the Monophysites without surrendering the Chalcedonian faith. Such an approach was supported by the Empress Theodora, who favoured the Miaphysites unreservedly. In the condemnation of the &quot;Three Chapters&quot;, three theologians that had opposed Monophysitism before and after the Council of Chalcedon, Justinian tried to win over the opposition. At the Fifth Ecumenical Council, most of the Eastern church yielded to the Emperor&#x27;s demands, and Pope Vigilius, who was forcibly brought to Constantinople and besieged at a chapel, finally also gave his assent. However, the condemnation was received unfavourably in the west, where it led to new (albeit temporal) schism, and failed to reach its goal in the east, as the Monophysites remained unsatisfied – all the more bitter for him because during his last years he took an even greater interest in theological matters.

====Authoritarian rule====
Justinian&#x27;s religious policy reflected the conviction that the unity of the empire presupposed unity of faith under the Chalcedonian Church. Those of different beliefs were subjected to persecution, which imperial legislation had effected from the time of Constantius II and which would now vigorously continue. The &quot;Codex&quot; contained two statutes that decreed the total destruction of paganism, even in private life; these provisions were zealously enforced. Contemporary sources (John Malalas, Theophanes, and John of Ephesus) tell of severe persecutions, including men in high positions.

The original Academy of Plato had been destroyed by the Roman dictator Sulla in 86 BC. Several centuries later, in 410 AD, a Neoplatonic Academy was established that had no institutional continuity with Plato&#x27;s Academy, and which served as a center for Neoplatonism and mysticism. It persisted until 529 AD when it was finally closed by Justinian I. Other schools in Constantinople, Antioch, and Alexandria, which were the centers of Justinian&#x27;s empire, continued.

In Asia Minor alone, John of Ephesus was reported to have converted 70,000 pagans, which was probably an exaggerated number. Other peoples also accepted Christianity: the Heruli, the Huns dwelling near the Don, the Abasgi, and the Tzanni in Caucasia.

The worship of Amun at the oasis of Awjila in the Libyan desert was abolished, and so were the remnants of the worship of Isis on the island of Philae, at the first cataract of the Nile. The Presbyter Julian and the Bishop Longinus conducted a mission among the Nabataeans, and Justinian attempted to strengthen Christianity in Yemen by dispatching a bishop from Egypt.

The civil rights of Jews were restricted and their religious privileges threatened. Justinian also interfered in the internal affairs of the synagogue and encouraged the Jews to use the Greek Septuagint in their synagogues in Constantinople.

The Emperor faced significant opposition from the Samaritans, who resisted conversion to Christianity and were repeatedly in insurrection. He persecuted them with rigorous edicts, for example, in 529, he banned them from having wills, an intentional act of humiliation. However, he could not prevent reprisals towards Christians from taking place in Samaria toward the close of his reign. 

The Manicheans too suffered persecution, experiencing both exile and threat of capital punishment. In Constantinople, c.450, a number of Manicheans, after strict inquisition, were executed by burning.

===Architecture, learning, art and literature===
Justinian&#x27;s reputation as a prolific builder is attested in the works of Procopius, Paul the Silentiary, John Malalas and Pseudo-Zacharias Rhetor. Under Justinian&#x27;s reign, the San Vitale in Ravenna, which features two famous mosaics representing Justinian and Theodora, was completed under the sponsorship of Julius Argentarius. Most notably, he had the Hagia Sophia, originally a basilica-style church that had been burnt down during the Nika riots, splendidly rebuilt according to a completely different ground plan, under the architectural supervision of Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles. On 26 December 537, according to Pseudo-Codinus, Justinian stated at the completion of this edifice: &quot;Solomon, I have outdone thee&quot; (in reference to the first Jewish temple). The church had a second inauguration on 24 December 562, after several reworks made by Isidore the Younger. This new cathedral, with its magnificent dome filled with mosaics, remained the centre of eastern Christianity for centuries.

Another prominent church in the capital, the Church of the Holy Apostles, which had been in a very poor state near the end of the 5th century, was likewise rebuilt. The Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus, later renamed Little Hagia Sophia, was also built between 532 and 536 by the imperial couple. Works of embellishment were not confined to churches alone: excavations at the site of the Great Palace of Constantinople have yielded several high-quality mosaics dating from Justinian&#x27;s reign, and a column topped by a bronze statue of Justinian on horseback and dressed in a military costume was erected in the Augustaeum in Constantinople in 543. Rivalry with other, more established patrons from the Constantinopolitan and exiled Roman aristocracy might have enforced Justinian&#x27;s building activities in the capital as a means of strengthening his dynasty&#x27;s prestige.

Justinian also strengthened the borders of the Empire from Africa to the East through the construction of fortifications and ensured Constantinople of its water supply through construction of underground cisterns (see Basilica Cistern). To prevent floods from damaging the strategically important border town Dara, an advanced arch dam was built. During his reign the large Sangarius Bridge was built in Bithynia, securing a major military supply route to the east. Furthermore, Justinian restored cities damaged by earthquake or war and built a new city near his place of birth called Justiniana Prima, which was intended to replace Thessalonica as the political and religious centre of Illyricum.

In Justinian&#x27;s reign, and partly under his patronage, Byzantine culture produced noteworthy historians, including Procopius and Agathias, and poets such as Paul the Silentiary and Romanus the Melodist flourished. On the other hand, centres of learning such as the Neoplatonic Academy in Athens and the famous Law School of Berytus lost their importance during his reign.

===Economy and administration===

As was the case under Justinian&#x27;s predecessors, the empire was an agrarian-based economy. In addition, long-distance trade flourished, reaching as far north as Cornwall where tin was exchanged for Roman wheat. Within the empire, convoys sailing from Alexandria provided Constantinople with wheat and grains. Justinian made the traffic more efficient by building a large granary on the island of Tenedos for storage and further transport to Constantinople. Justinian also tried to find new routes for the eastern trade, which was suffering badly from the wars with the Persians.

Silk was an important luxury product, which was imported and then processed in the empire. In order to protect the manufacture of silk products, Justinian granted a monopoly to the imperial factories in 541. In order to bypass the Persian landroute, Justinian established friendly relations with the Abyssinians, whom he wanted to act as trade mediators by transporting Indian silk to the empire; the Abyssinians, however, were unable to compete with the Persian merchants in India. Then, in the early 550s, two monks succeeded in smuggling eggs of silk worms from Central Asia back to Constantinople, and silk became an indigenous product.

Gold and silver were mined in the Balkans, Anatolia, Armenia, Cyprus, Egypt and Nubia. At the start of Justinian I&#x27;s reign, he had inherited a surplus 28,800,000 &quot;solidi&quot; (400,000 pounds of gold) in the imperial treasury from Anastasius I and Justin I. Under Justinian&#x27;s rule, measures were taken to counter corruption in the provinces and to make tax collection more efficient. Greater administrative power was given to both the leaders of the prefectures and of the provinces, while power was taken away from the vicariates of the dioceses, of which a number were abolished. The overall trend was towards a simplification of administrative infrastructure. According to Brown (1971), the increased professionalization of tax collection did much to destroy the traditional structures of provincial life, as it weakened the autonomy of the town councils in the Greek towns. It has been estimated that before Justinian I&#x27;s reconquests the state had an annual revenue of 5,000,000 &quot;solidi&quot; in AD 530, but after his reconquests, the annual revenue was increased to 6,000,000 &quot;solidi&quot; in AD 550.

Throughout Justinian&#x27;s reign, the cities and villages of the East thrived, although Antioch was struck by two earthquakes (526, 528) and sacked and evacuated by the Persians (540). Justinian had the city rebuilt, but on a slightly smaller scale.

The empire suffered several major setbacks in the course of the 6th century. The first one was the plague, which lasted from 541 to 543 and, by decreasing the empire&#x27;s population, probably created a scarcity of labor and a rising of wages. It has been proposed that the lack of manpower also led to a significant increase in the number of &quot;barbarians&quot; in the Byzantine armies after the early 540s, but others are skeptical of this view. The protracted war in Italy and the wars with the Persians themselves laid a heavy burden on the empire&#x27;s resources, and Justinian was criticized for curtailing the government-run post service, which he limited to only one eastern route of military importance.

==Natural disasters==

The extreme weather events of 535–536 led to a famine such as had not been recorded before, affecting both Europe and the Middle East. These events may have been caused by an atmospheric dust veil resulting from a large volcanic eruption.

The historian Procopius recorded in 536 in his work on the Vandalic War &quot;during this year a most dread portent took place. For the sun gave forth its light without brightness … and it seemed exceedingly like the sun in eclipse, for the beams it shed were not clear&quot;.

The causes of these disasters are not precisely known, but volcanoes at the Rabaul caldera, Lake Ilopango, Krakatoa, or, according to a recent finding, in Iceland are suspected.

Seven years later in 542, a devastating outbreak of Bubonic Plague, known as the Plague of Justinian, was traditionally believed to have killed tens of millions, second only to Black Death of the 14th century. Justinian and members of his court were afflicted, with Justinian himself contracting and surviving the pestilence. The impact of this outbreak of plague has recently been disputed, since evidence for tens of millions dying is uncertain.

In July 551, the Beirut earthquake struck the eastern Mediterranean and triggered a tsunami. The combined fatalities of both events likely exceeded 30,000, with tremors felt from Antioch to Alexandria.

==Historical sources==

Contemporary sources include the writings of Procopius, John Malalas, John of Ephesus, Agathias, John the Lydian, Menander Protector, Evagrius Scholasticus, Pseudo-Zacharias Rhetor, Jordanes, Marcellinus Comes, Corippus and Victor of Tunnuna. The Paschal Chronicle and Theophanes the Confessor also provide accounts of his reign though written in a later period.

Procopius provides some of the primary sources for the history of Justinian&#x27;s reign, but displays growing disillusionment (Justinian and the Later Roman Empire by John W. Barker) and bitterness towards Justinian and his empress Theodora. While he glorified Justinian&#x27;s architectural achievements in his panegyric (&quot;Buildings&quot;) and provided a more lukewarm account in his history (&quot;Wars&quot;), Procopius also wrote a hostile account, &quot;Anekdota&quot; (the so-called &quot;Secret History&quot;), in which Justinian is depicted as cruel, venal, incompetent and demonic. The Syriac chronicle of John of Ephesus, which survives partially, was used as a source for later chronicles, contributing many additional details of value. John Malalas&#x27; chronicle was another popular source that summarized the events of his reign.

Justinian is widely regarded as a saint by Orthodox Christians. In various Eastern Orthodox Churches, including the Orthodox Church in America, Justinian and his empress Theodora are commemorated on the anniversary of his death, 14 November. Some denominations translate the Julian calendar date to 27 November on the Gregorian calendar. The Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod and the Lutheran Church–Canada also commemorate Justinian on 14 November.

==Cultural depictions==


In the &quot;Paradiso&quot; section of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, Canto (chapter) VI, by Dante Alighieri, Justinian I is prominently featured as a spirit residing on the sphere of Mercury. The latter holds in Heaven the souls of those whose acts were righteous, yet meant to achieve fame and honor. Justinian&#x27;s legacy is elaborated on, and he is portrayed as a defender of the Christian faith and the restorer of Rome to the Empire. Justinian confesses that he was partially motivated by fame rather than duty to God, which tainted the justice of his rule in spite of his proud accomplishments. In his introduction, &quot;Cesare fui e son Iustinïano&quot; (&quot;Caesar I was, and am Justinian&quot;), his mortal title is contrasted with his immortal soul, to emphasize that &quot;glory in life is ephemeral, while contributing to God&#x27;s glory is eternal&quot;, according to Dorothy L. Sayers. Dante also uses Justinian to criticize the factious politics of his 14th-century Italy, divided between Ghibellines and Guelphs, in contrast to the unified Italy of the Roman Empire.

Justinian is a major character in the 1938 novel &quot;Count Belisarius&quot;, by Robert Graves. He is depicted as a jealous and conniving Emperor obsessed with creating and maintaining his own historical legacy.

Justinian appears as a character in the 1939 time-travel novel &quot;Lest Darkness Fall&quot;, by L. Sprague de Camp.

&quot;The Glittering Horn: Secret Memoirs of the Court of Justinian&quot; was a novel written by Pierson Dixon in 1958 about the court of Justinian.

In the 1968 West German-Italian historical drama film &quot;Kampf um Rom&quot; (English language title: The Last Roman) Justinian is played by Orson Welles.

In the 1985 Soviet film &quot;Primary Russia&quot; Justinian is played by Innokenty Smoktunovsky.

Justinian is a chief protagonist of Belisarius in &quot;Empire in Apocalypse&quot; by Robert Bruton (Legend Books 2023). The emperor&#x27;s jealousy and envy of Belisarius eventually prompt him to undermine his best general.

Justinian occasionally appears in the comic strip &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;, usually as a nemesis of the title character.

Justinian&#x27;s Crown is a historical artifact claimed by the Byzantine Empire in the popular 2020 computer strategy game &quot;Crusader Kings 3&quot;, by Paradox Development Studio.

<doc id="16211" wikidata="Q472578" url="?curid=16211" title="John Martyn">
<text>Iain David McGeachy (11 September 1948 – 29 January 2009), known professionally as John Martyn, was a British singer-songwriter and guitarist. Over a 40-year career, he released 23 studio albums and received frequent critical acclaim. &quot;The Times&quot; described him as &quot;an electrifying guitarist and singer whose music blurred the boundaries between folk, jazz, rock and blues&quot;.

Martyn began his career at age 17 as a key member of the Scottish folk music scene, drawing inspiration from American blues and English traditional music, and signed with Island Records. By the 1970s he had begun incorporating jazz and rock into his sound on albums such as &quot;Solid Air&quot; (1973) and &quot;One World&quot; (1977), as well as experimenting with guitar effects and tape delay machines like the Echoplex. Domestic and substance abuse problems marked his personal life throughout the 1970s and 1980s, though he continued to release albums while collaborating with figures such as Phil Collins and Maeve Aubele, Carolyn Woolham and Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry. He remained active until his death in 2009.

== Early life and education ==
Martyn was born in Beechcroft Avenue, New Malden, Surrey, to Belgian Jewish mother Beatrice &quot;Betty&quot; Ethel (&quot;née&quot; Jewitt) and Greenock-born Scottish father Thomas Paterson &quot;Tommy&quot; McGeachy. His parents, both opera singers, divorced when he was five and he spent his childhood alternating between Scotland and England. Most of this time was spent in the care of his father and grandmother, Janet, in Shawlands, Glasgow, part of his holidays each year spent on his mother&#x27;s houseboat. He adapted his accent depending on context or company, changing between broad or refined Glaswegian and southern English accents, and continued to do so throughout his life. He attended Shawlands Academy in Glasgow. At school, he was a keen rugby player. On leaving school he attended Glasgow School of Art, but left to pursue his musical aspirations.

== Career ==

=== 1960s and 1970s ===
Mentored by Hamish Imlach, Martyn began his professional musical career when he was 17, playing a fusion of blues and folk resulting in a distinctive style which made him a key figure in the British folk scene during the mid-1960s. He signed to Chris Blackwell&#x27;s Island Records in 1967 and released his first album, &quot;London Conversation&quot;, the same year. Released in 1968, his second album, &quot;The Tumbler&quot;, was moving towards jazz.

By 1970 Martyn had developed a wholly original and idiosyncratic sound: acoustic guitar run through a fuzzbox, phase shifter and Echoplex. This sound was first apparent on &quot;Stormbringer!&quot; released in February 1970.

&quot;Stormbringer!&quot; was written and performed by Martyn and his then-wife Beverley, who had previously recorded solo as Beverley Kutner. Their second duo album, &quot;The Road to Ruin&quot;, was released in November 1970. Island Records felt that it would be more successful to market Martyn as a solo act and this was how subsequent albums were produced, although Beverley continued to make appearances as a backing singer as well as continuing as a solo artist herself.

Released in 1971, &quot;Bless the Weather&quot; was Martyn&#x27;s third solo album. In February 1973, Martyn released the album &quot;Solid Air&quot;, the title song a tribute to the singer-songwriter Nick Drake, a close friend and label-mate who would die in 1974 from an overdose of antidepressants. In 2009, a double CD Deluxe edition of &quot;Solid Air&quot; was released featuring unreleased songs and out-takes, and sleeve notes by Record Collector&#x27;s Daryl Easlea. On &quot;Bless the Weather&quot; and on &quot;Solid Air&quot; Martyn collaborated with jazz bassist Danny Thompson, with whom he proceeded to have a musical partnership which continued until his death.

Following the commercial success of &quot;Solid Air&quot;, later on in 1973 Martyn quickly recorded and released the experimental &quot;Inside Out&quot;, an album with emphasis placed on feel and improvisation rather than song structure. In 1975, he followed this with &quot;Sunday&#x27;s Child&quot;, a more song-based collection that includes &quot;My Baby Girl&quot; and &quot;Spencer the Rover&quot;, which are references to his young family. Martyn subsequently described this period as &#x27;very happy&#x27;. In September 1975, he released a live album, &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; — Martyn had been unable to persuade Island to release the record, and resorted to selling individually signed copies by mail from his home in Hastings. &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; features Danny Thompson and drummer John Stevens. In 2010, a 2CD Deluxe version of Live at Leeds was released, and it was discovered that not all of the songs on the original album were from the Leeds concert. After releasing &quot;Live at Leeds&quot;, Martyn took a sabbatical, including a visit to Jamaica, spending time with reggae producer Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry.

In 1977, he released &quot;One World&quot;, which led some commentators to describe Martyn as the &quot;Father of Trip-Hop&quot;. It included tracks such as &quot;Small Hours&quot; and &quot;Big Muff&quot;, a collaboration with Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry. &quot;Small Hours&quot; was recorded outside; the microphones picked up ambient sounds, such as geese from a nearby lake. In 1978, he played guitar on the album &quot;Harmony of the Spheres&quot; by Neil Ardley.

=== 1980s ===
Martyn&#x27;s marriage broke down at the end of the 1970s and &quot;John hit the self destruct button&quot; (although other biographers, including &quot;The Times&quot; obituary writer, attribute the break-up of his marriage to his already being addicted to alcohol and drugs). In her autobiography, Beverley also alleges protracted domestic violence. Out of this period, described by Martyn as &quot;a very dark period in my life&quot;, came the album &quot;Grace and Danger&quot;. Released in October 1980, the album had been held up for a year by Chris Blackwell. He was a close friend of John and Beverley, and found the album too openly disturbing to release. Only after intense and sustained pressure from Martyn did Blackwell agree to release the album. Commenting on that period, Martyn said, &quot;I was in a dreadful emotional state over that record. I was hardly in control of my own actions. The reason they finally released it was because I freaked: Please get it out! I don&#x27;t give a damn about how sad it makes you feel—it&#x27;s what I&#x27;m about: the direct communication of emotion. &quot;Grace and Danger&quot; was very cathartic, and it really hurt.&quot;

In the late 1980s, Martyn cited &quot;Grace and Danger&quot; as his favourite album, and said that it was &quot;probably the most specific piece of autobiography I&#x27;ve written. Some people keep diaries, I make records.&quot; The album has since become one of his highest-regarded, prompting a deluxe double-disc issue in 2007, containing the original album remastered.

Phil Collins played drums and sang backing vocals on &quot;Grace and Danger&quot; and subsequently played drums on and produced Martyn&#x27;s next album, &quot;Glorious Fool&quot;, in 1981. Martyn left Island records in 1981, and recorded &quot;Glorious Fool&quot; and &quot;Well Kept Secret&quot; for WEA achieving his first Top 30 album. In 1983 Martyn released a live album, &quot;Philentropy&quot;, and married Annie Furlong but the couple, who had lived in Scotland, later separated. Returning to Island records, he recorded &quot;Sapphire&quot; (1984), &quot;Piece by Piece&quot; (1986) and the live &quot;Foundations&quot; (1987) before leaving the label in 1988.

=== 1990s and 2000s ===

Martyn released &quot;The Apprentice&quot; in 1990 and &quot;Cooltide&quot; in 1991 for Permanent Records, and reunited with Phil Collins for &quot;No Little Boy&quot; (1993), which featured rerecorded versions of some of his classic tracks. The similar 1992 release &quot;Couldn&#x27;t Love You More&quot; was unauthorised and disowned by Martyn. Material from these recordings and his two Permanent albums have been recycled on many releases. Permanent Records also released a live 2-CD set called &quot;Live&quot; in 1994. &quot;And&quot; (1996) came out on Go! Discs and saw Martyn draw heavily on trip-hop textures, a direction which saw more complete expression on 2000&#x27;s &quot;Glasgow Walker&quot;. &quot;The Church with One Bell&quot; (1998) is a covers album of blues classics, which draws on songs by other artists, including Portishead and Ben Harper. In 2001, Martyn appeared on the track &quot;Deliver Me&quot; by Faithless keyboard player and DJ Sister Bliss.
In July 2006, the documentary &quot;Johnny Too Bad&quot; was screened by the BBC. The programme documented the period surrounding the operation to amputate Martyn&#x27;s right leg below the knee (the result of a burst cyst that had led to septicaemia) and the writing and recording of &quot;On the Cobbles&quot; (2004), an album described by Peter Marsh on the BBC Music website as &quot;the strongest, most consistent set he&#x27;s come up with in years.&quot; Much of &quot;Cobbles&quot; was a revisiting of his acoustic-based sound.
Martyn&#x27;s last concerts were in November 2008, reprising Grace and Danger.

In collaboration with his keyboard player Spenser Cozens, Martyn wrote and performed the score for &quot;Strangebrew&quot; (Robert Wallace 2007), which won the Fortean Times Award at the London Short Film Festival in the same year. The film concept being a strong influence of the album design of Martyn&#x27;s &quot;Heaven and Earth&quot; (2011). On 4 February 2008, Martyn received the lifetime achievement award at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. The award was presented by his friend Phil Collins. The BBC website stated Martyn&#x27;s &quot;heartfelt performances have either suggested or fully demonstrated an idiosyncratic genius.&quot; Eric Clapton was quoted saying that Martyn was &quot;so far ahead of everything, it&#x27;s almost inconceivable.&quot;

To mark Martyn&#x27;s 60th birthday, Island released a 4 CD boxed set, &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Saint&quot;, on 1 September 2008. The set includes unreleased studio material and rare live recordings.

Martyn was appointed OBE in the 2009 New Year Honours and died a few weeks later. His partner Theresa Walsh collected the award at Buckingham Palace. Martyn had recorded new material before he died and his final studio album, &quot;Heaven and Earth&quot;, was completed and released posthumously in May 2011. The sleeve note says, &quot;all the tracks on this recording were kept as John wished — in their entirety&quot;.

== Death ==
Martyn died on 29 January 2009, at a hospital in Thomastown, County Kilkenny, Ireland, from acute respiratory distress syndrome. He had been living in Thomastown with his partner Theresa Walsh. Martyn&#x27;s health was affected by his life-long abuse of drugs and alcohol. He was survived by his partner and his children, Mhairi, Wesley and Spencer McGeachy.

=== Tributes ===
Following Martyn&#x27;s death, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; lauded his &quot;progressive folk invention and improvising sorcery&quot;. Friend and collaborator Phil Collins paid tribute to him, saying, &quot;John&#x27;s passing is terribly, terribly sad. I had worked with and known him since the late 1970s and he was a great friend. He was uncompromising, which made him infuriating to some people, but he was unique and we&#x27;ll never see the likes of him again. I loved him dearly and will miss him very much.&quot;

Mike Harding introduced an hour-long tribute to Martyn in his BBC Radio 2 programme on 25 February 2009. A tribute album, &quot;Johnny Boy Would Love This&quot;, was released on 15 August 2011, comprising cover versions of his songs by various artists.

The &quot;Grace &amp; Danger: A Celebration of John Martyn&quot; tribute concert held on 27 January 2019 at Glasgow Royal Concert Hall marked the tenth anniversary of his passing. Curated and hosted by Danny Thompson, artists including Eddi Reader, Eric Bibb and Paul Weller performed &quot;to do full justice to a selection of Martyn&#x27;s finest songs and channel some of the great man&#x27;s spirit&quot;.

<doc id="16215" wikidata="Q79759" url="?curid=16215" title="John Milton">
<text>John Milton (9 December 1608 – 8 November 1674) was an English poet, polemicist, and civil servant. His 1667 epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, written in blank verse and including twelve books, was written in a time of immense religious flux and political upheaval. It addressed the fall of man, including the temptation of Adam and Eve by the fallen angel Satan and God&#x27;s expulsion of them from the Garden of Eden. &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; elevated Milton&#x27;s reputation as one of history&#x27;s greatest poets. He also served as a civil servant for the Commonwealth of England under its Council of State and later under Oliver Cromwell.

Milton achieved fame and recognition during his lifetime; his celebrated &quot;Areopagitica&quot; (1644), written in condemnation of pre-publication censorship, is among history&#x27;s most influential and impassioned defences of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. His desire for freedom extended beyond his philosophy and was reflected in his style, which included his introduction of new words (coined from Latin and Ancient Greek) to the English language. He was the first modern writer to employ unrhymed verse outside of the theatre or translations.

Milton is described as the &quot;greatest English author&quot; by his biographer William Hayley, and he remains generally regarded &quot;as one of the preeminent writers in the English language&quot;, though critical reception has oscillated in the centuries since his death, often on account of his republicanism. Samuel Johnson praised &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; as &quot;a poem which ... with respect to design may claim the first place, and with respect to performance, the second, among the productions of the human mind&quot;, though he (a Tory) described Milton&#x27;s politics as those of an &quot;acrimonious and surly republican&quot;. Milton was revered by poets such as William Blake, William Wordsworth, and Thomas Hardy.

Phases of Milton&#x27;s life parallel the major historical and political divisions in Stuart England at the time. In his early years, Milton studied at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and then travelled, wrote poetry mostly for private circulation, and launched a career as pamphleteer and publicist under Charles I&#x27;s increasingly autocratic rule and Britain&#x27;s breakdown into constitutional confusion and ultimately civil war. While once considered dangerously radical and heretical, Milton contributed to a seismic shift in accepted public opinions during his life that ultimately elevated him to public office in England. The Restoration of 1660 and his loss of vision later deprived Milton much of his public platform, but he used the period to develop many of his major works.

Milton&#x27;s views developed from extensive reading, travel, and experience that began with his days as a student at Cambridge in the 1620s and continued through the English Civil War, which started in 1642 and continued until 1651. By the time of his death in 1674, Milton was impoverished and on the margins of English intellectual life but famous throughout Europe and unrepentant for political choices that placed him at odds with governing authorities.

John Milton is widely regarded as one of the greatest poets in English literature, though his oeuvre has drawn criticism from notable figures, including T. S. Eliot and Joseph Addison. According to some scholars, Milton was second in influence to none but William Shakespeare. In one of his books, Samuel Johnson praised him for having the power of &quot;displaying the vast, illuminating the splendid, enforcing the awful, darkening the gloomy and aggravating the dreadful&quot;.

== Early life and education ==

John Milton was born in Bread Street, London, on 9 December 1608, the son of composer John Milton and his wife Sarah Jeffrey. The senior John Milton (1562–1647) moved to London around 1583 after being disinherited by his devout Catholic father Richard &quot;the Ranger&quot; Milton for embracing Protestantism. In London, the senior John Milton married Sarah Jeffrey (1572–1637) and found lasting financial success as a scrivener. He lived in and worked from a house in Cheapside at Bread Street, where the Mermaid Tavern was located. The elder Milton was noted for his skill as a composer of music, and this talent left his son with a lifelong appreciation for music and friendships with musicians such as Henry Lawes.

The prosperity of Milton&#x27;s father allowed his eldest son to obtain a private tutor, Thomas Young, a Scottish Presbyterian with an MA from the University of St Andrews. Young&#x27;s influence also served as the poet&#x27;s introduction to religious radicalism. After Young&#x27;s tutorship, Milton attended St Paul&#x27;s School in London, where he began the study of Latin and Greek; the classical languages left an imprint on both his poetry and prose in English (he also wrote in Latin and Italian).

Milton&#x27;s first datable compositions are two psalms written at age 15 at Long Bennington. One contemporary source is &quot;Brief Lives&quot; of John Aubrey, an uneven compilation including first-hand reports. In the work, Aubrey quotes Christopher, Milton&#x27;s younger brother: &quot;When he was young, he studied very hard and sat up very late, commonly till twelve or one o&#x27;clock at night&quot;. Aubrey adds, &quot;His complexion exceeding faire—he was so faire that they called him the Lady of Christ&#x27;s College.&quot;

In 1625, Milton gained entry to Christ&#x27;s College at the University of Cambridge, where he graduated with a BA in 1629, ranking fourth of 24 honours graduates that year in the University of Cambridge. Preparing, at that time, to become an Anglican priest, he stayed on at Cambridge where he received his MA on 3 July 1632.

Milton may have been rusticated (suspended) in his first year at Cambridge for quarrelling with his tutor, Bishop William Chappell. He was certainly at home in London in the Lent Term 1626; there he wrote &quot;Elegia Prima&quot;, his first Latin elegy, to Charles Diodati, a friend from St Paul&#x27;s. Based on remarks of John Aubrey, Chappell &quot;whipt&quot; Milton. This story is now disputed, though certainly Milton disliked Chappell. Historian Christopher Hill notes that Milton was apparently rusticated and that the differences between Chappell and Milton may have been either religious or personal. It is also possible that, like Isaac Newton four decades later, Milton was sent home from Cambridge because of the plague, which afflicted Cambridge in 1625.

At Cambridge, Milton was on good terms with Edward King; he later dedicated &quot;Lycidas&quot; to him. Milton also befriended theologian Roger Williams, tutoring Williams in Hebrew in exchange for lessons in Dutch. Despite developing a reputation for poetic skill and general erudition, Milton suffered from alienation among his peers during his time at Cambridge. Having once watched his fellow students attempting comedy on the college stage, he later observed, &quot;they thought themselves gallant men, and I thought them fools&quot;.

Milton also was disdainful of the university curriculum, which consisted of stilted formal debates conducted in Latin on abstruse topics. His own corpus is not devoid of humour, notably his sixth and his epitaphs on the death of Thomas Hobson. While at Cambridge, he wrote some of his well-known shorter English poems, including &quot;On the Morning of Christ&#x27;s Nativity&quot;, &quot;Epitaph on the admirable Dramaticke Poet, W. Shakespeare&quot; (his first poem to appear in print), &quot;L&#x27;Allegro&quot;, and &quot;Il Penseroso&quot;.

== Study, poetry, and travel ==

After receiving his MA, Milton moved to Hammersmith, his father&#x27;s new home since the previous year. He also lived at Horton, Berkshire, from 1635 and undertook six years of self-directed private study. Hill argues that this was not retreating into a rural idyll; Hammersmith was then a &quot;suburban village&quot; falling into the orbit of London, and even Horton was becoming deforested and suffered from the plague. He read both ancient and modern works of theology, philosophy, history, politics, literature, and science in preparation for a prospective poetical career. Milton&#x27;s intellectual development can be charted via entries in his commonplace book (like a scrapbook), now in the British Library. As a result of such intensive study, Milton is considered to be among the most learned of all English poets. In addition to his years of private study, Milton had command of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, Spanish, and Italian from his school and undergraduate days; he also added Old English to his linguistic repertoire in the 1650s while researching his &quot;History of Britain&quot;, and probably acquired proficiency in Dutch soon after.

Milton continued to write poetry during this period of study; his &quot;Arcades&quot; and &quot;Comus&quot; were both commissioned for masques composed for noble patrons, connections of the Egerton family, and performed in 1632 and 1634 respectively. &quot;Comus&quot; argues for the virtuousness of temperance and chastity. He contributed his pastoral elegy &quot;Lycidas&quot; to a memorial collection for one of his fellow students at Cambridge. Drafts of these poems are preserved in Milton&#x27;s poetry notebook, known as the Trinity Manuscript, because it is now kept at Trinity College, Cambridge. It was Charles Mason who made the extraordinary discovery, in the library of Trinity College, of &quot;a packet of thirty loose and tattered folio leaves, almost covered with the handwriting of Milton&quot;. It is thought that Mason recognised the nature of this material around 1735 and the loose-leaf sheets were bound for the first time in 1736; the Trinity Manuscript has been described as &quot;“the chief treasure of Trinity Library”&quot;.

In May 1638, accompanied by a manservant, Milton embarked upon a tour of France and Italy for 15 months that lasted until July or August 1639. His travels supplemented his study with new and direct experiences of artistic and religious traditions, especially Roman Catholicism. He met famous theorists and intellectuals of the time and was able to display his poetic skills. For specific details of what happened within Milton&#x27;s &quot;grand tour&quot;, there appears to be just one primary source: Milton&#x27;s own &quot;Defensio Secunda&quot;. There are other records, including some letters and some references in his other prose tracts, but the bulk of the information about the tour comes from a work that, according to Barbara Lewalski, &quot;was not intended as autobiography but as rhetoric, designed to emphasise his sterling reputation with the learned of Europe.&quot;

He first went to Calais and then on to Paris, riding horseback, with a letter from diplomat Henry Wotton to ambassador John Scudamore. Through Scudamore, Milton met Hugo Grotius, a Dutch law philosopher, playwright, and poet. Milton left France soon after this meeting. He travelled south from Nice to Genoa, and then to Livorno and Pisa. He reached Florence in July 1638. While there, Milton enjoyed many of the sites and structures of the city. His candour of manner and erudite neo-Latin poetry earned him friends in Florentine intellectual circles, and he met the astronomer Galileo who was under house arrest at Arcetri, as well as others. Milton probably visited the Florentine Academy and the Accademia della Crusca along with smaller academies in the area, including the Apatisti and the Svogliati.

He left Florence in September to continue to Rome. With the connections from Florence, Milton was able to have easy access to Rome&#x27;s intellectual society. His poetic abilities impressed those like Giovanni Salzilli, who praised Milton within an epigram. In late October, Milton attended a dinner given by the English College, Rome, despite his dislike for the Society of Jesus, meeting English Catholics who were also guests—theologian Henry Holden and the poet Patrick Cary. He also attended musical events, including oratorios, operas, and melodramas. Milton left for Naples toward the end of November, where he stayed only for a month because of the Spanish control. During that time, he was introduced to Giovanni Battista Manso, patron to both Torquato Tasso and to Giambattista Marino.

Originally, Milton wanted to leave Naples in order to travel to Sicily and then on to Greece, but he returned to England during the summer of 1639 because of what he claimed in &quot;Defensio Secunda&quot; were &quot;sad tidings of civil war in England.&quot; Matters became more complicated when Milton received word that his childhood friend Diodati had died. Milton in fact stayed another seven months on the continent and spent time at Geneva with Diodati&#x27;s uncle after he returned to Rome. In &quot;Defensio Secunda&quot;, Milton proclaimed that he was warned against a return to Rome because of his frankness about religion, but he stayed in the city for two months and was able to experience Carnival and meet Lukas Holste, a Vatican librarian who guided Milton through its collection. He was introduced to Cardinal Francesco Barberini who invited Milton to an opera hosted by the Cardinal. Around March, Milton travelled once again to Florence, staying there for two months, attending further meetings of the academies, and spending time with friends. After leaving Florence, he travelled through Lucca, Bologna, and Ferrara before coming to Venice. In Venice, Milton was exposed to a model of Republicanism, later important in his political writings, but he soon found another model when he travelled to Geneva. From Switzerland, Milton travelled to Paris and then to Calais before finally arriving back in England in either July or August 1639.

== Civil war, prose tracts, and marriage ==

On returning to England where the Bishops&#x27; Wars presaged further armed conflict, Milton began to write prose tracts against episcopacy, in the service of the Puritan and Parliamentary cause. Milton&#x27;s first foray into polemics was &quot;Of Reformation touching Church Discipline in England&quot; (1641), followed by &quot;Of Prelatical Episcopacy&quot;, the two defences of Smectymnuus (a group of Presbyterian divines named from their initials; the &quot;TY&quot; belonged to Milton&#x27;s old tutor Thomas Young), and &quot;The Reason of Church-Government Urged against Prelaty&quot;. He vigorously attacked the High-church party of the Church of England and their leader William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, with frequent passages of real eloquence lighting up the rough controversial style of the period, and deploying a wide knowledge of church history.

He was supported by his father&#x27;s investments, but Milton became a private schoolmaster at this time, educating his nephews and other children of the well-to-do. This experience and discussions with educational reformer Samuel Hartlib led him to write his short tract &quot;Of Education&quot; in 1644, urging a reform of the national universities.

In June 1642, Milton paid a visit to the manor house at Forest Hill, Oxfordshire, and, aged 34, married the 17-year-old Mary Powell. The marriage got off to a poor start as Mary did not adapt to Milton&#x27;s austere lifestyle or get along with his nephews. Milton found her intellectually unsatisfying and disliked the royalist views she had absorbed from her family. It is also speculated that she refused to consummate the marriage. Mary soon returned home to her parents and did not come back until 1645, partly because of the outbreak of the Civil War.

In the meantime, her desertion prompted Milton to publish a series of pamphlets over the next three years arguing for the legality and morality of divorce beyond grounds of adultery. (Anna Beer, author of a 2008 biography of Milton, points to a lack of evidence and the dangers of cynicism in urging that it was not necessarily the case that the private life so animated the public polemicising.) In 1643, Milton had a brush with the authorities over these writings, in parallel with Hezekiah Woodward, who had more trouble. It was the hostile response accorded the divorce tracts that spurred Milton to write &quot;Areopagitica; A speech of Mr. John Milton for the Liberty of Unlicenc&#x27;d Printing, to the Parlament of England&quot;, his celebrated attack on pre-printing censorship. In &quot;Areopagitica&quot;, Milton aligns himself with the parliamentary cause, and he also begins to synthesize the ideal of neo-Roman liberty with that of Christian liberty. Milton also courted another woman during this time; we know nothing of her except that her name was Davis and she turned him down. However, it was enough to induce Mary Powell into returning to him which she did unexpectedly by begging him to take her back. They had two daughters in quick succession following their reconciliation.

== Secretary for Foreign Tongues ==
With the Parliamentary victory in the Civil War, Milton used his pen in defence of the republican principles represented by the Commonwealth. &quot;The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates&quot; (1649) defended the right of the people to hold their rulers to account, and implicitly sanctioned the regicide; Milton&#x27;s political reputation got him appointed Secretary for Foreign Tongues by the Council of State in March 1649. His main job description was to compose the English Republic&#x27;s foreign correspondence in Latin and other languages, but he also was called upon to produce propaganda for the regime and to serve as a censor.

In October 1649, he published &quot;Eikonoklastes&quot;, an explicit defence of the regicide, in response to the &quot;Eikon Basilike&quot;, a phenomenal best-seller popularly attributed to Charles I that portrayed the King as an innocent Christian martyr. A month later the exiled Charles II and his party published the defence of monarchy &quot;Defensio Regia pro Carolo Primo&quot;, written by leading humanist Claudius Salmasius. By January of the following year, Milton was ordered to write a defence of the English people by the Council of State. Milton worked more slowly than usual, given the European audience and the English Republic&#x27;s desire to establish diplomatic and cultural legitimacy, as he drew on the learning marshalled by his years of study to compose a riposte.

On 24 February 1652, Milton published his Latin defence of the English people &quot;Defensio pro Populo Anglicano&quot;, also known as the &quot;First Defence&quot;. Milton&#x27;s pure Latin prose and evident learning exemplified in the &quot;First Defence&quot; quickly made him a European reputation, and the work ran to numerous editions. He addressed his &quot;Sonnet 16&quot; to &#x27;The Lord Generall Cromwell in May 1652&#x27; beginning &quot;Cromwell, our chief of men ...&quot;, although it was not published until 1654.

In 1654, Milton completed the second defence of the English nation &quot;Defensio secunda&quot; in response to an anonymous Royalist tract &quot;Regii Sanguinis Clamor ad Coelum Adversus Parricidas Anglicanos&quot; [The Cry of the Royal Blood to Heaven Against the English Parricides], a work that made many personal attacks on Milton. The second defence praised Oliver Cromwell, now Lord Protector, while exhorting him to remain true to the principles of the Revolution. Alexander Morus, to whom Milton wrongly attributed the &quot;Clamor&quot; (in fact by Peter du Moulin), published an attack on Milton, in response to which Milton published the autobiographical &quot;Defensio pro se&quot; in 1655. Milton held the appointment of Secretary for Foreign Tongues to the Commonwealth Council of State until 1660, although after he had become totally blind, most of the work was done by his deputies, Georg Rudolph Wecklein, then Philip Meadows, and from 1657 by the poet Andrew Marvell.

By 1652, Milton had become totally blind; the cause of his blindness is debated but bilateral retinal detachment or glaucoma are most likely. His blindness forced him to dictate his verse and prose to amanuenses who copied them out for him; one of these was Andrew Marvell. One of his best-known sonnets, &quot;When I Consider How My Light is Spent,&quot; titled by a later editor, John Newton, &quot;On His Blindness,&quot; is presumed to date from this period.

== The Restoration ==

Cromwell&#x27;s death in 1658 caused the English Republic to collapse into feuding military and political factions. Milton, however, stubbornly clung to the beliefs that had originally inspired him to write for the Commonwealth. In 1659, he published &quot;A Treatise of Civil Power&quot;, attacking the concept of a state-dominated church (the position known as Erastianism), as well as &quot;Considerations touching the likeliest means to remove hirelings&quot;, denouncing corrupt practises in church governance. As the Republic disintegrated, Milton wrote several proposals to retain a non-monarchical government against the wishes of parliament, soldiers, and the people.
* &quot;A Letter to a Friend, Concerning the Ruptures of the Commonwealth&quot;, written in October 1659, was a response to General Lambert&#x27;s recent dissolution of the Rump Parliament.
* &quot;Proposals of certain expedients for the preventing of a civil war now feared&quot;, written in November 1659.
* &quot;The Ready and Easy Way to Establishing a Free Commonwealth&quot;, in two editions, responded to General Monck&#x27;s march towards London to restore the Long Parliament (which led to the restoration of the monarchy). The work is an impassioned, bitter, and futile jeremiad damning the English people for backsliding from the cause of liberty and advocating the establishment of an authoritarian rule by an oligarchy set up by an unelected parliament.

Upon the Restoration in May 1660, Milton, fearing for his life, went into hiding, while a warrant was issued for his arrest and his writings were burnt. He re-emerged after a general pardon was issued, but was nevertheless arrested and briefly imprisoned before influential friends intervened, such as Marvell, now an MP. Milton married for a third and final time on 24 February 1663, marrying Elizabeth (Betty) Minshull, aged 24, a native of Wistaston, Cheshire. He spent the remaining decade of his life living quietly in London, only retiring to a cottage during the Great Plague of London—Milton&#x27;s Cottage in Chalfont St. Giles, his only extant home.

During this period, Milton published several minor prose works, such as the grammar textbook &quot;Art of Logic&quot; and a &quot;History of Britain&quot;. His only explicitly political tracts were the 1672 &quot;Of True Religion&quot;, arguing for toleration (except for Catholics), and a translation of a Polish tract advocating an elective monarchy. Both these works were referred to in the Exclusion debate, the attempt to exclude the heir presumptive from the throne of England—James, Duke of York—because he was Roman Catholic. That debate preoccupied politics in the 1670s and 1680s and precipitated the formation of the Whig party and the Glorious Revolution.

== Death ==

Milton died on 8 November 1674, just a month before his 66th birthday. He was buried in the church of St Giles-without-Cripplegate, Fore Street, London. However, sources differ as to whether the cause of death was consumption or gout. According to an early biographer, his funeral was attended by &quot;his learned and great Friends in London, not without a friendly concourse of the Vulgar.&quot; A monument was added in 1793, sculpted by John Bacon the Elder.

== Family ==
Milton and his first wife Mary Powell (1625–1652) had four children:
* Anne (born 29 July 1646)
* Mary (born 25 October 1648)
* John (16 March 1651 – June 1652)
* Deborah (2 May 1652 – 10 August 1727)

Mary Powell died on 5 May 1652 from complications following Deborah&#x27;s birth. Milton&#x27;s daughters survived to adulthood, but he always had a strained relationship with them.

On 12 November 1656, Milton was married to Katherine Woodcock at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster. She died on 3 February 1658, less than four months after giving birth to her daughter Katherine, who also died.

Milton married for a third time on 24 February 1663 to Elizabeth Mynshull or Minshull (1638–1728), the niece of Thomas Mynshull, a wealthy apothecary and philanthropist in Manchester. The marriage took place at St Mary Aldermary in the City of London. Despite a 31-year age gap, the marriage seemed happy, according to John Aubrey, and lasted more than 12 years until Milton&#x27;s death. (A plaque on the wall of Mynshull&#x27;s House in Manchester describes Elizabeth as Milton&#x27;s &quot;3rd and Best wife&quot;.) Samuel Johnson, however, claims that Mynshull was &quot;a domestic companion and attendant&quot; and Milton&#x27;s nephew Edward Phillips relates that Mynshull &quot;oppressed his children in his lifetime, and cheated them at his death&quot;.

His nephews, Edward and John Phillips (sons of Milton&#x27;s sister Anne), were educated by Milton and became writers themselves. John acted as a secretary, and Edward was Milton&#x27;s first biographer.

==Poetry==
Milton&#x27;s poetry was slow to see the light of day, at least under his name. His first published poem was &quot;On Shakespeare&quot; (1630), anonymously included in the Second Folio edition of William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays in 1632. An annotated copy of the First Folio has been suggested to contain marginal notes by Milton. Milton collected his work in &quot;1645 Poems&quot; in the midst of the excitement attending the possibility of establishing a new English government. The anonymous edition of &quot;Comus&quot; was published in 1637, and the publication of &quot;Lycidas&quot; in 1638 in &quot;Justa Edouardo King Naufrago&quot; was signed J. M. Otherwise. The 1645 collection was the only poetry of his to see print until &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; appeared in 1667.

===&quot;Paradise Lost&quot;===

Milton&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;, the blank-verse epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, was composed by the blind and impoverished Milton from 1658 to 1664 (first edition), with small but significant revisions published in 1674 (second edition). As a blind poet, Milton dictated his verse to a series of aides in his employ. It has been argued that the poem reflects his personal despair at the failure of the Revolution yet affirms an ultimate optimism in human potential. Some literary critics have argued that Milton encoded many references to his unyielding support for the &quot;Good Old Cause&quot;.

On 27 April 1667, Milton sold the publication rights for &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; to publisher Samuel Simmons for £5 (equivalent to approximately £770 in 2015 purchasing power), with a further £5 to be paid if and when each print run sold out of between 1,300 and 1,500 copies. The first run was a quarto edition priced at three shillings per copy (about £23 in 2015 purchasing power equivalent), published in August 1667, and it sold out in eighteen months.

Milton followed up the publication &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; with its sequel &quot;Paradise Regained&quot;, which was published alongside the tragedy &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot; in 1671. Both of these works also reflect Milton&#x27;s post-Restoration political situation. Just before his death in 1674, Milton supervised a second edition of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, accompanied by an explanation of &quot;why the poem rhymes not&quot;, and prefatory verses by Andrew Marvell. In 1673, Milton republished his &quot;1645 Poems&quot;, as well as a collection of his letters and the Latin prolusions from his Cambridge days.

==Views==
An unfinished religious manifesto, , probably written by Milton, lays out many of his heterodox theological views, and was not discovered and published until 1823. Milton&#x27;s key beliefs were idiosyncratic, not those of an identifiable group or faction, and often they go well beyond the orthodoxy of the time. Their tone, however, stemmed from the Puritan emphasis on the centrality and inviolability of conscience. He was his own man, but he was anticipated by Henry Robinson in &quot;Areopagitica&quot;.

===Philosophy===
While Milton&#x27;s beliefs are generally considered to be consistent with Protestant Christianity, Stephen Fallon argues that by the late 1650s, Milton may have at least toyed with the idea of monism or animist materialism, the notion that a single material substance which is &quot;animate, self-active, and free&quot; composes everything in the universe: from stones and trees and bodies to minds, souls, angels, and God. Fallon claims that Milton devised this position to avoid the mind-body dualism of Plato and Descartes as well as the mechanistic determinism of Hobbes. According to Fallon, Milton&#x27;s monism is most notably reflected in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; when he has angels eat (5.433–439) and apparently engage in sexual intercourse (8.622–629) and the &quot;De Doctrina&quot;, where he denies the dual natures of man and argues for a theory of Creation &quot;ex Deo&quot;.

===Political thought===
Milton was a &quot;passionately individual Christian Humanist poet.&quot; He appears on the pages of seventeenth-century English Puritanism, an age characterized as &quot;the world turned upside down.&quot; He was a Puritan and yet was unwilling to surrender conscience to party positions on public policy. Thus, Milton&#x27;s political thought, driven by competing convictions, a Reformed faith and a Humanist spirit, led to enigmatic outcomes. &quot;Areopagitica&quot; was written in response to the Licensing Order, in November 1644.

Milton&#x27;s political thought may be best categorized according to respective periods in his life and times. The years 1641–42 were dedicated to church politics and the struggle against episcopacy. After his divorce writings, &quot;Areopagitica&quot;, and a gap, he wrote in 1649–54 in the aftermath of the execution of Charles I, and in polemic justification of the regicide and the existing Parliamentarian regime. Then in 1659–60 he foresaw the Restoration and wrote to head it off.

Milton&#x27;s own beliefs were in some cases unpopular, particularly his commitment to republicanism. In the coming centuries, Milton would be claimed as an early apostle of liberalism. According to James Tully:

A friend and ally in the pamphlet wars was Marchamont Nedham. Austin Woolrych considers that although they were quite close, there is &quot;little real affinity, beyond a broad republicanism&quot;, between their approaches. Blair Worden remarks that both Milton and Nedham, with others such as Andrew Marvell and James Harrington, would have taken their problem with the Rump Parliament to be not the republic itself, but the fact that it was not a proper republic. Woolrych speaks of &quot;the gulf between Milton&#x27;s vision of the Commonwealth&#x27;s future and the reality&quot;. In the early version of his &quot;History of Britain&quot;, begun in 1649, Milton was already writing off the members of the Long Parliament as incorrigible.

He praised Oliver Cromwell as the Protectorate was set up; though subsequently he had major reservations. When Cromwell seemed to be backsliding as a revolutionary, after a couple of years in power, Milton moved closer to the position of Sir Henry Vane, to whom he wrote a sonnet in 1652. The group of disaffected republicans included, besides Vane, John Bradshaw, John Hutchinson, Edmund Ludlow, Henry Marten, Robert Overton, Edward Sexby and John Streater; but not Marvell, who remained with Cromwell&#x27;s party. Milton had already commended Overton, along with Edmund Whalley and Bulstrode Whitelocke, in &quot;Defensio Secunda&quot;. Nigel Smith writes that

As Richard Cromwell fell from power, he envisaged a step towards a freer republic or &quot;free commonwealth&quot;, writing in the hope of this outcome in early 1660. Milton had argued for an awkward position, in the &quot;Ready and Easy Way&quot;, because he wanted to invoke the Good Old Cause and gain the support of the republicans, but without offering a democratic solution of any kind. His proposal, backed by reference (amongst other reasons) to the oligarchical Dutch and Venetian constitutions, was for a council with perpetual membership. This attitude cut right across the grain of popular opinion of the time, which swung decisively behind the restoration of the Stuart monarchy that took place later in the year. Milton, an associate of and advocate on behalf of the regicides, was silenced on political matters as Charles II returned.

===Theology===

John Milton was neither a clergyman nor a theologian; however, theology, and particularly English Calvinism, formed the palette on which he created his greatest thoughts. Milton wrestled with the great doctrines of the Church amidst the theological crosswinds of his age. The great poet was undoubtedly Reformed (though his grandfather, Richard &quot;the Ranger&quot; Milton had been Roman Catholic). However, Milton&#x27;s Calvinism had to find expression in a broad-spirited Humanism. Like many Renaissance artists before him, Milton attempted to integrate Christian theology with classical modes. In his early poems, the poet narrator expresses a tension between vice and virtue, the latter invariably related to Protestantism. In &quot;Comus&quot;, Milton may make ironic use of the Caroline court masque by elevating notions of purity and virtue over the conventions of court revelry and superstition. In his later poems, Milton&#x27;s theological concerns become more explicit.

His use of biblical citation was wide-ranging; Harris Fletcher, standing at the beginning of the intensification of the study of the use of scripture in Milton&#x27;s work (poetry and prose, in all languages Milton mastered), notes that typically Milton clipped and adapted biblical quotations to suit the purpose, giving precise chapter and verse only in texts for a more specialized readership. As for the plenitude of Milton&#x27;s quotations from scripture, Fletcher comments, &quot;For this work, I have in all actually collated about twenty-five hundred of the five to ten thousand direct Biblical quotations which appear therein&quot;. Milton&#x27;s customary English Bible was the Authorized King James. When citing and writing in other languages, he usually employed the Latin translation by Immanuel Tremellius, though &quot;he was equipped to read the Bible in Latin, in Greek, and in Hebrew, including the Targumim or Aramaic paraphrases of the Old Testament, and the Syriac version of the New, together with the available commentaries of those several versions&quot;.

Milton embraced many heterodox Christian theological views. He has been accused of rejecting the Trinity, believing instead that the Son was subordinate to the Father, a position known as Arianism; and his sympathy or curiosity was probably engaged by Socinianism: in August 1650 he licensed for publication by William Dugard the &quot;Racovian Catechism&quot;, based on a non-trinitarian creed. Milton&#x27;s alleged Arianism, like much of his theology, is still the subject of debate and controversy. Rufus Wilmot Griswold argued that &quot;In none of his great works is there a passage from which it can be inferred that he was an Arian; and in the very last of his writings he declares that &quot;the doctrine of the Trinity is a plain doctrine in Scripture.&quot; In &quot;Areopagitica,&quot; Milton classified Arians and Socinians as &quot;errorists&quot; and &quot;schismatics&quot; alongside Arminians and Anabaptists. A source has interpreted him as broadly Protestant, if not always easy to locate in a more precise religious category. In 2019, John Rogers stated, &quot;Heretics both, John Milton and Isaac Newton were, as most scholars now agree, Arians.&quot;

In his 1641 treatise, &quot;Of Reformation&quot;, Milton expressed his dislike for Catholicism and episcopacy, presenting Rome as a modern Babylon, and bishops as Egyptian taskmasters. These analogies conform to Milton&#x27;s puritanical preference for Old Testament imagery. He knew at least four commentaries on &quot;Genesis&quot;: those of John Calvin, Paulus Fagius, David Pareus and Andreus Rivetus.

Through the Interregnum, Milton often presents England, rescued from the trappings of a worldly monarchy, as an elect nation akin to the Old Testament Israel, and shows its leader, Oliver Cromwell, as a latter-day Moses. These views were bound up in Protestant views of the Millennium, which some sects, such as the Fifth Monarchists predicted would arrive in England. Milton, however, would later criticise the &quot;worldly&quot; millenarian views of these and others, and expressed orthodox ideas on the prophecy of the Four Empires.

The Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660 began a new phase in Milton&#x27;s work. In &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, &quot;Paradise Regained&quot; and &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot;, Milton mourns the end of the godly Commonwealth. The Garden of Eden may allegorically reflect Milton&#x27;s view of England&#x27;s recent Fall from Grace, while Samson&#x27;s blindness and captivity—mirroring Milton&#x27;s own lost sight—may be a metaphor for England&#x27;s blind acceptance of Charles II as king. Illustrated by &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; is mortalism, the belief that the soul lies dormant after the body dies.

Despite the Restoration of the monarchy, Milton did not lose his personal faith; &quot;Samson&quot; shows how the loss of national salvation did not necessarily preclude the salvation of the individual, while &quot;Paradise Regained&quot; expresses Milton&#x27;s continuing belief in the promise of Christian salvation through Jesus Christ.

Though he maintained his personal faith in spite of the defeats suffered by his cause, the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; recounted how he had been alienated from the Church of England by Archbishop William Laud, and then moved similarly from the Dissenters by their denunciation of religious tolerance in England.

Writing of the enigmatic and often conflicting views of Milton in the Puritan age, David Daiches wrote,A fair theological summary may be that John Milton was a Puritan, though his tendency to press further for liberty of conscience, sometimes out of conviction and often out of mere intellectual curiosity, made the great man, at least, a vital if not uncomfortable ally in the broader Puritan movement.

===Religious toleration===
Milton called in the &quot;Areopagitica&quot; for &quot;the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties&quot; to the conflicting Protestant denominations. According to American historian William Hunter, &quot;Milton argued for disestablishment as the only effective way of achieving broad toleration. Rather than force a man&#x27;s conscience, government should recognise the persuasive force of the gospel.&quot;

===Divorce===
Milton wrote &quot;The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce&quot; in 1643, at the beginning of the English Civil War. In August of that year, he presented his thoughts to the Westminster Assembly of Divines, which had been created by the Long Parliament to bring greater reform to the Church of England. The Assembly convened on 1 July against the will of King Charles I.

Milton&#x27;s thinking on divorce caused him considerable trouble with the authorities. An orthodox Presbyterian view of the time was that Milton&#x27;s views on divorce constituted a one-man heresy:

Even here, though, his originality is qualified: Thomas Gataker had already identified &quot;mutual solace&quot; as a principal goal in marriage. Milton abandoned his campaign to legitimise divorce after 1645, but he expressed support for polygamy in the , the theological treatise that provides the clearest evidence for his views.

Milton wrote during a period when thoughts about divorce were anything but simplistic; rather, there was active debate among thinkers and intellectuals at the time. However, Milton&#x27;s basic approval of divorce within strict parameters set by the biblical witness was typical of many influential Christian intellectuals, particularly the Westminster divines. Milton addressed the Assembly on the matter of divorce in August 1643, at a moment when the Assembly was beginning to form its opinion on the matter. In the &quot;Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce&quot;, Milton argued that divorce was a private matter, not a legal or ecclesiastical one. Neither the Assembly nor Parliament condemned Milton or his ideas. In fact, when the Westminster Assembly wrote the Westminster Confession of Faith they allowed for divorce (&#x27;Of Marriage and Divorce,&#x27; Chapter 24, Section 5) in cases of infidelity or abandonment. Thus, the Christian community, at least a majority within the &#x27;Puritan&#x27; sub-set, approved of Milton&#x27;s views.

Nevertheless, the reaction among Puritans to Milton&#x27;s views on divorce was mixed. Herbert Palmer, a member of the Westminster Assembly, condemned Milton in the strongest possible language:

Palmer expressed his disapproval in a sermon addressed to the Westminster Assembly. The Scottish commissioner Robert Baillie described Palmer&#x27;s sermon as one &quot;of the most Scottish and free sermons that ever I heard anywhere&quot;.

===History===
History was particularly important for the political class of the period, and Lewalski considers that Milton &quot;more than most illustrates&quot; a remark of Thomas Hobbes on the weight placed at the time on the classical Latin historical writers Tacitus, Livy, Sallust and Cicero, and their republican attitudes. Milton himself wrote that &quot;Worthy deeds are not often destitute of worthy relaters&quot;, in Book II of his &quot;History of Britain&quot;. A sense of history mattered greatly to him:

==Legacy and influence==
Once &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; was published, Milton&#x27;s stature as an epic poet was immediately recognised. He cast a formidable shadow over English poetry in the 18th and 19th centuries; he was often judged equal or superior to all other English poets, including Shakespeare. Very early on, though, he was championed by Whigs, and decried by Tories: with the regicide Edmund Ludlow he was claimed as an early Whig, while the High Tory Anglican minister Luke Milbourne lumped Milton in with other &quot;Agents of Darkness&quot; such as John Knox, George Buchanan, Richard Baxter, Algernon Sidney and John Locke. The political ideas of Milton, Locke, Sidney, and James Harrington strongly influenced the Radical Whigs, whose ideology in turn was central to the American Revolution. Modern scholars of Milton&#x27;s life, politics, and work are known as Miltonists: &quot;his work is the subject of a very large amount of academic scholarship&quot;.

In 2008, John Milton Passage, a short passage by Bread Street into St Mary-le-Bow Churchyard in London, was unveiled.

===Early reception of the poetry===
John Dryden, an early enthusiast, in 1677 began the trend of describing Milton as the poet of the sublime. Dryden&#x27;s &quot;The State of Innocence and the Fall of Man: an Opera&quot; (1677) is evidence of an immediate cultural influence. In 1695, Patrick Hume became the first editor of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, providing an extensive apparatus of annotation and commentary, particularly chasing down allusions.

In 1732, the classical scholar Richard Bentley offered a corrected version of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. Bentley was considered presumptuous and was attacked in the following year by Zachary Pearce. Christopher Ricks judges that, as a critic, Bentley was both acute and wrong-headed, and &quot;incorrigibly eccentric&quot;; William Empson also finds Pearce to be more sympathetic to Bentley&#x27;s underlying line of thought than is warranted.

There was an early, partial translation of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; into German by Theodore Haak and based on that a standard verse translation by Ernest Gottlieb von Berge. A subsequent prose translation by Johann Jakob Bodmer was very popular; it influenced Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock. The German-language Milton tradition returned to England in the person of the artist Henry Fuseli.

Many Enlightenment thinkers of the 18th century revered and commented on Milton&#x27;s poetry and non-poetical works. In addition to John Dryden, among them were Alexander Pope, Joseph Addison, Thomas Newton, and Samuel Johnson. For example, in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, Joseph Addison wrote extensive notes, annotations, and interpretations of certain passages of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. Jonathan Richardson, senior, and Jonathan Richardson, the younger, co-wrote a book of criticism. In 1749, Thomas Newton published an extensive edition of Milton&#x27;s poetical works with annotations provided by himself, Dryden, Pope, Addison, the Richardsons (father and son) and others. Newton&#x27;s edition of Milton was a culmination of the honour bestowed upon Milton by early Enlightenment thinkers; it may also have been prompted by Richard Bentley&#x27;s infamous edition, described above. Samuel Johnson wrote numerous essays on &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, and Milton was included in his &quot;Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets&quot; (1779–1781). In &quot;The Age of Louis XIV&quot;, Voltaire said &quot;Milton remains the glory and the wonder (&quot;l&#x27;admiration&quot;) of England.&quot;

===William Blake===
William Blake considered Milton the major English poet. Blake placed Edmund Spenser as Milton&#x27;s precursor, and saw himself as Milton&#x27;s poetical son. In his &quot;&quot;, Blake uses Milton as a spiritual guide and a symbol of poetic inspiration.

===Romantic theory===
Edmund Burke was a theorist of the sublime, and he regarded Milton&#x27;s description of Hell as exemplary of sublimity as an aesthetic concept. For Burke, it was to set alongside mountaintops, a storm at sea, and infinity. In &quot;The Beautiful and the Sublime&quot;, he wrote: &quot;No person seems better to have understood the secret of heightening, or of setting terrible things, if I may use the expression, in their strongest light, by the force of a judicious obscurity than Milton.&quot;

The Romantic poets valued his exploration of blank verse, but for the most part rejected his religiosity. William Wordsworth began his sonnet &quot;London, 1802&quot; with &quot;Milton! thou should&#x27;st be living at this hour&quot; and modelled &quot;The Prelude&quot;, his own blank verse epic, on &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. John Keats found the yoke of Milton&#x27;s style uncongenial; he exclaimed that &quot;Miltonic verse cannot be written but in an artful or rather artist&#x27;s humour.&quot; Keats felt that &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; was a &quot;beautiful and grand curiosity&quot;, but his own unfinished attempt at epic poetry, &quot;Hyperion&quot;, was unsatisfactory to the author because, amongst other things, it had too many &quot;Miltonic inversions&quot;. In &quot;The Madwoman in the Attic&quot;, Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar note that Mary Shelley&#x27;s novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is, in the view of many critics, &quot;one of the key &#x27;Romantic&#x27; readings of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;.&quot;

===Later legacy===
The Victorian age witnessed a continuation of Milton&#x27;s influence. Thomas Carlyle declared him the &quot;moral king of English literature,&quot; while George Eliot and Thomas Hardy were particularly inspired by Milton&#x27;s poetry and biography. Hostile 20th-century criticism by T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound did not reduce Milton&#x27;s stature. F. R. Leavis, in &quot;The Common Pursuit&quot;, responded to the points made by Eliot, in particular the claim that &quot;the study of Milton could be of no help: it was only a hindrance&quot;, by arguing, &quot;As if it were a matter of deciding &quot;not&quot; to study Milton! The problem, rather, was to escape from an influence that was so difficult to escape from because it was unrecognized, belonging, as it did, to the climate of the habitual and &#x27;natural&#x27;.&quot; Harold Bloom, in &quot;The Anxiety of Influence&quot;, wrote that &quot;Milton is the central problem in any theory and history of poetic influence in English [...]&quot;.

Milton&#x27;s &quot;Areopagitica&quot; is still cited as relevant to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. A quotation from &quot;Areopagitica&quot;—&quot;A good book is the precious lifeblood of a master spirit, embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life&quot;—is displayed in many public libraries, including the New York Public Library.

The title of Philip Pullman&#x27;s &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; trilogy is derived from a quotation, &quot;His dark materials to create more worlds&quot;, line 915 of Book II in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. Pullman was concerned to produce a version of Milton&#x27;s poem accessible to teenagers, and has spoken of Milton as &quot;our greatest public poet&quot;.

Titles of a number of other well-known literary works are also derived from Milton&#x27;s writings. Examples include Thomas Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot;, Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Eyeless in Gaza&quot;, Arthur Koestler&#x27;s &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot;, and William Golding&#x27;s &quot;Darkness Visible&quot;.

T. S. Eliot believed that &quot;of no other poet is it so difficult to consider the poetry simply as poetry, without our theological and political dispositions ... making unlawful entry&quot;.

===Literary legacy===
Milton&#x27;s use of blank verse, in addition to his stylistic innovations (such as grandiloquence of voice and vision, peculiar diction and phraseology) influenced later poets. At the time, poetic blank verse was considered distinct from its use in verse drama, and &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; was taken as a unique exemplar. Said Isaac Watts in 1734, &quot;Mr. Milton is esteemed the parent and author of blank verse among us&quot;. &quot;Miltonic verse&quot; might be synonymous for a century with blank verse as poetry, a new poetic terrain independent from both the drama and the heroic couplet.

Lack of rhyme was sometimes taken as Milton&#x27;s defining innovation. He himself considered the rhymeless quality of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; to be an extension of his own personal liberty:

This pursuit of freedom was largely a reaction against conservative values entrenched within the rigid heroic couplet. Within a dominant culture that stressed elegance and finish, he granted primacy to freedom, breadth and imaginative suggestiveness, eventually developed into the romantic vision of sublime terror. Reaction to Milton&#x27;s poetic worldview included, grudgingly, acknowledgement of the poet&#x27;s resemblance to classical writers (Greek and Roman poetry being unrhymed). Blank verse came to be a recognised medium for religious works and for translations of the classics. Unrhymed lyrics like Collins&#x27; &quot;Ode to Evening&quot; (in the meter of Milton&#x27;s translation of Horace&#x27;s &quot;Ode to Pyrrha&quot;) were not uncommon after 1740.

A second aspect of Milton&#x27;s blank verse was the use of unconventional rhythm:

Before Milton, &quot;the sense of regular rhythm ... had been knocked into the English head so securely that it was part of their nature&quot;. The &quot;Heroick measure&quot;, according to Samuel Johnson, &quot;is pure ... when the accent rests upon every second syllable through the whole line ... The repetition of this sound or percussion at equal times, is the most complete harmony of which a single verse is capable&quot;. Caesural pauses, most agreed, were best placed at the middle and the end of the line. In order to support this symmetry, lines were most often octo- or deca-syllabic, with no enjambed endings. To this schema Milton introduced modifications, which included hypermetrical syllables (trisyllabic feet), inversion or slighting of stresses, and the shifting of pauses to all parts of the line. Milton deemed these features to be reflective of &quot;the transcendental union of order and freedom&quot;. Admirers remained hesitant to adopt such departures from traditional metrical schemes: &quot;The English ... had been writing separate lines for so long that they could not rid themselves of the habit&quot;. Isaac Watts preferred his lines distinct from each other, as did Oliver Goldsmith, Henry Pemberton, and Scott of Amwell, whose general opinion it was that Milton&#x27;s frequent omission of the initial unaccented foot was &quot;displeasing to a nice ear&quot;. It was not until the late 18th century that poets (beginning with Gray) began to appreciate &quot;the composition of Milton&#x27;s harmony ... how he loved to vary his pauses, his measures, and his feet, which gives that enchanting air of freedom and wilderness to his versification&quot;. By the 20th century, American poet and critic John Hollander would go so far as to say that Milton &quot;was able, by plying that most remarkable instrument of English meter ... to invent a new mode of image-making in English poetry.&quot;

Milton&#x27;s pursuit of liberty extended into his vocabulary as well. It included many Latinate neologisms, as well as obsolete words already dropped from popular usage so completely that their meanings were no longer understood. In 1740, Francis Peck identified some examples of Milton&#x27;s &quot;old&quot; words (now popular). The &quot;Miltonian dialect&quot;, as it was called, was emulated by later poets; Pope used the diction of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; in his Homer translation, while the lyric poetry of Gray and Collins was frequently criticised for their use of &quot;obsolete words out of Spenser and Milton&quot;. The language of Thomson&#x27;s finest poems (e.g. &quot;The Seasons&quot;, &quot;The Castle of Indolence&quot;) was self-consciously modelled after the Miltonian dialect, with the same tone and sensibilities as &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. Following to Milton, English poetry from Pope to John Keats exhibited a steadily increasing attention to the connotative, the imaginative and poetic, value of words.

===Musical settings===

Milton&#x27;s ode &quot;At a solemn Musick&quot; was set for choir and orchestra as &quot;Blest Pair of Sirens&quot; by Hubert Parry (1848–1918), and Milton&#x27;s poem &quot;On the Morning of Christ&#x27;s Nativity&quot; was set as a large-scale choral work by Cyril Rootham (1875–1938). Milton also wrote the hymn Let us with a gladsome mind, a versification of Psalm 136. His &#x27;L&#x27;Allegro&#x27; and &#x27;Il Penseroso&#x27;, with additional material, were magnificently set by Handel (1740).

<text>Georg Henri Anton &quot;Joris&quot; Ivens (18 November 1898 – 28 June 1989) was a Dutch documentary filmmaker. Among the notable films he directed or co-directed are &quot;A Tale of the Wind&quot;, &quot;The Spanish Earth&quot;, &quot;Rain&quot;, &quot;...A Valparaiso&quot;, &quot;Misère au Borinage&quot; (&quot;Borinage&quot;), &quot;17th Parallel: Vietnam in War&quot;, &quot;The Seine Meets Paris&quot;, &quot;Far from Vietnam&quot;, &quot;Pour le Mistral&quot; and &quot;How Yukong Moved the Mountains&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Born Georg Henri Anton Ivens on 18 November 1898 at Nijmegen, Netherlands, into a wealthy family, Ivens went to work in one of his father&#x27;s photo supply shops and from there developed an interest in film. Under the direction of his father, he completed his first film at 13.

He studied first at the Rotterdam School of Economics (1916–17, 1920–21), before serving as a field artillery lieutenant in World War I. In 1922 and 1923 he studied photochemistry in Germany.

Returning to Amsterdam in 1926, he joined the family business, but left around 1929 after his first two films were met with acclaim.

==Career==
===Early work===
Originally his work was constructivist in character, especially his short city symphonies &quot;Rain&quot; (&quot;Regen&quot;, 1929), which he directed together with Mannus Franken, filmed over two years, and &quot;The Bridge&quot; (&quot;De Brug&quot;, 1928). The latter was about a newly built elevator railway bridge in Rotterdam, shot in 1927, and shown in 1928 by the &quot;Nederlandsche Filmliga&quot; (Netherlands Film League) (1927–1933). This avant-garde cineclub, with its eponymous magazine, had just been established by Ivens, Menno ter Braak, and others, with branches in different Dutch cities. &quot;The Bridge&quot; was part of its first season of film screenings, and received critical acclaim. The &quot;Filmliga&quot; drew various foreign filmmakers to the Netherlands, such as Alberto Cavalcanti, René Clair, Sergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, and Dziga Vertov, who also became Ivens&#x27; friends. Through these connections, &quot;The Bridge&quot; was widely shown abroad, including the Soviet Union.

In 1929, Ivens went to the Soviet Union after being invited to present a lecture there, and due to the success of &quot;The Bridge&quot;, he was invited to direct a film on a topic of his own choosing, which was the new industrial city of Magnitogorsk. Before commencing work, he returned to the Netherlands to make &quot;Industrial Symphony&quot; for Philips Electric, which is considered to be a film of great technical beauty. 

He returned to the Soviet Union to make the film about Magnitogorsk, &quot;Song of Heroes &quot; in 1931 with music composed by Hanns Eisler. This was the first film on which Ivens and Eisler worked together. It was a propaganda film about this new industrial city where masses of laborers and Dommunist youth worked for Stalin&#x27;s Five Year Plan.

With Henri Storck, Ivens made &quot;Misère au Borinage&quot; (&quot;Borinage&quot;, 1933), a documentary on life in a coal mining region. In 1943, he also directed two Allied propaganda films for the National Film Board of Canada, including &quot;Action Stations&quot;, about the Royal Canadian Navy&#x27;s escorting of convoys in the Battle of the Atlantic.

Ivens met Ernest Hemingway and Ludwig Renn during the Spanish Civil War in 1936.

===U.S. and World War II===
From 1936 to 1945, Ivens was based in the United States. For Pare Lorentz&#x27;s U.S. Film Service, in the year 1940, he made a documentary film on rural electrification called &quot;Power and the Land&quot;. It focused on a family, the Parkinsons, who ran a business providing milk for their community. The film showed the problem in the lack of electricity and the way the problem was fixed.

Ivens was, however, better known for his anti-fascist and other propaganda films, including the feature-length documentary &quot;The Spanish Earth&quot; (1937). This film was made for the Spanish Republican cause, co-written with Ernest Hemingway, with music by Marc Blitzstein and Virgil Thomson. Jean Renoir did the French narration for the film and Hemingway did the English version (after Orson Welles&#x27; version had sounded too theatrical). This film was financed by Archibald MacLeish, Fredric March, Florence Eldridge, Lillian Hellman, Luise Rainer, Dudley Nichols, Franchot Tone, and other Hollywood movie stars, moguls, and writers who composed a group known as the Contemporary Historians. &quot; The Spanish Earth &quot; was shown at the White House on 8 July 1937 after Ivens, Hemingway, and Martha Gellhorn had had dinner with President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Harry Hopkins. The Roosevelts loved the film but said that it needed more propaganda. The film showed how the Republicans tried to hold on to freedoms which were threatened by the Falangists, and their attempts to reclaim farmland which had been neglected for decades by absentee landlords. Ivens produced the film for less than $10,000. This documentary was considered his masterpiece.

In 1938 he traveled to China. &quot;The 400 Million&quot; (1939) depicted the history of modern China and the Chinese resistance during the Second Sino-Japanese War, including dramatic shots of the Battle of Taierzhuang. Robert Capa did camerawork, Sidney Lumet worked on the film as a reader, Hanns Eisler wrote the musical score, and Fredric March provided the narration. It had been financed by the same people who had supported &quot;Spanish Earth&quot;. Its chief fundraiser was Luise Rainer, recipient of the best actress Oscar two years in a row; and the entire group called themselves this time, &quot;History Today, Inc &quot;. The Kuomintang government censored the film, fearing that it would give too much credit to left-wing forces. Ivens was also suspected of being a friend of Mao Zedong and especially Zhou Enlai.

In early 1943, Frank Capra hired Ivens to supervise the production of &quot;Know Your Enemy: Japan &quot; for his U.S. War Department film series &quot;Why We Fight&quot;. The film&#x27;s commentary was written largely by Carl Foreman. Capra fired Ivens from the project because he felt that his approach was too sympathetic toward the Japanese. The film&#x27;s release was held up because there were concerns that Emperor Hirohito was being depicted as a war criminal, and there was a policy shift to portray the Emperor more favorably after the war as a means of maintaining order in post-war Japan.

With the emerging &quot;Red Scare&quot; of the late 1940s, Ivens was forced to leave the country in the early months of the Truman administration. Ivens&#x27;s leftist politics also put a stop to his first feature film project, which was to have starred Greta Garbo. Walter Wanger, the film&#x27;s producer, was adamant about &quot;running [Ivens] out of town.&quot;

=== Return to Europe ===

In 1946, commissioned to make a Dutch film about Indonesian independence, Ivens resigned in protest over what he considered ongoing imperialism; the Dutch were in his view resisting decolonization. Instead, Ivens filmed &quot;Indonesia Calling&quot; in secret, for which he received funding from the International Workers Order. 

For around a decade Ivens lived in Eastern Europe, working for several studios there.

Having been criticized in the Netherlands, the tides were turning in the 1960s. In 1965, the city of Rotterdam commissioned him to make a film about the port, which was meant to be a promotional film, but Ivens got &quot;carte blanche&quot;. The result, the essay-film &quot;Rotterdam Europoort&quot; (1966), is not only critical of modern city planning and consumerism, but also an autobiographical tale inspired by the legend of the Flying Dutchman. Ivens was very happy with the result and even believed that it was his best film. 

At about the same time, from 1965 to 1970, Ivens also worked on two documentary films about North Vietnam during the war; he made &quot;17e parallèle: La guerre du peuple&quot; &quot;(17th Parallel: Vietnam in War)&quot; and he participated in the collective work &quot;Loin du Vietnam&quot; (&quot;Far from Vietnam&quot;). 

From 1971 to 1977, he shot &quot;How Yukong Moved the Mountains&quot;, a 763-minute documentary about the Cultural Revolution in China.

Shortly before his death in 1989, Ivens released the last of more than 40 films: &quot;Une histoire de vent&quot; (&quot;A Tale of the Wind&quot;).

==Recognition and awards==
Ivens was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize for the year 1967.

In 1988 he received the Golden Lion Honorary Award at the Venice Film Festival. 

He received the Order of the Netherlands Lion in January 1989.

==Personal life==
Ivens met photographer Germaine Krull in Berlin in 1923, and entered into a marriage of convenience with her between 1927 and 1943 so that Krull could hold a Dutch passport and could have a &quot;veneer of married respectability without sacrificing her autonomy.&quot;

Ivens later married French filmmaker and writer Marceline Loridan. They had no children.

==Death and legacy==
On 7 June 1989 Ivens spoke to Radio Netherlands about his life and work in a wide-ranging interview.

He died on 28 June 1989. He was buried at the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris.

The Joris Ivens Award was awarded at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam from 1988, before being renamed the IDFA Award for Best Feature-Length Documentary between 2006 and 2009. It was presented annually until 2020, when the category was split.

 the Prix du premier film Loridan-Ivens (First Film Loridan-Ivens Award) is awarded each year at the Cinéma du Réel film festival. The Loridan-Ivens Award was initiated by Loridan-Ivens to support emerging committed filmmakers &quot;casting a sharp eye on the state of the world&quot;. It is given in honour of her husband Joris Ivens, who was an early supporter Cinéma du Réel. The prize was formerly known as the Joris Ivens Prize for a Young Filmmaker, or just Joris Ivens Award.

A statue of Ivens by sculptor Bryan McCormack was erected in Parc de Saint-Cloud in Paris in 2010.

The Joris Ivens European Foundation (Europese Stichting Joris Ivens) includes an archive of Ivens&#x27; work, as well as other features relating to him.

<text>The jaguar (Panthera onca) is a large cat species and the only living member of the genus &quot;Panthera&quot; that is native to the Americas. With a body length of up to and a weight of up to , it is the biggest cat species in the Americas and the third largest in the world. Its distinctively marked coat features pale yellow to tan colored fur covered by spots that transition to rosettes on the sides, although a melanistic black coat appears in some individuals. The jaguar&#x27;s powerful bite allows it to pierce the carapaces of turtles and tortoises, and to employ an unusual killing method: it bites directly through the skull of mammalian prey between the ears to deliver a fatal blow to the brain.

The modern jaguar&#x27;s ancestors probably entered the Americas from Eurasia during the Early Pleistocene via the land bridge that once spanned the Bering Strait. Today, the jaguar&#x27;s range extends from the Southwestern United States across Mexico and much of Central America, the Amazon rainforest and south to Paraguay and northern Argentina. It inhabits a variety of forested and open terrains, but its preferred habitat is tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest, wetlands and wooded regions. It is adept at swimming and is largely a solitary, opportunistic, stalk-and-ambush apex predator. As a keystone species, it plays an important role in stabilizing ecosystems and in regulating prey populations.

The jaguar is threatened by habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, poaching for trade with its body parts and killings in human–wildlife conflict situations, particularly with ranchers in Central and South America. It has been listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List since 2002. The wild population is thought to have declined since the late 1990s. Priority areas for jaguar conservation comprise 51 Jaguar Conservation Units (JCUs), defined as large areas inhabited by at least 50 breeding jaguars. The JCUs are located in 36 geographic regions ranging from Mexico to Argentina.

The jaguar has featured prominently in the mythology of indigenous peoples of the Americas, including those of the Aztec and Maya civilizations.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;jaguar&quot; is possibly derived from the Tupi-Guarani word meaning &#x27;wild beast that overcomes its prey at a bound&#x27;. In North America, the word is pronounced disyllabic , while in British English, it is pronounced with three syllables . Because that word also applies to other animals, indigenous peoples in Guyana call it , with the added sufix &quot;eté&quot;, meaning &quot;true beast&quot;.
&quot;Onca&quot; is derived from the Portuguese name for a spotted cat that is larger than a lynx; cf. &quot;ounce&quot;. The word &quot;panther&quot; is derived from classical Latin , itself from the ancient Greek ().

== Taxonomy and evolution ==
===Taxonomy===
In 1758, Carl Linnaeus described the jaguar in his work &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; and gave it the scientific name &quot;Felis onca&quot;.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, several jaguar type specimens formed the basis for descriptions of subspecies. In 1939, Reginald Innes Pocock recognized eight subspecies based on the geographic origins and skull morphology of these specimens.
Pocock did not have access to sufficient zoological specimens to critically evaluate their subspecific status but expressed doubt about the status of several. Later consideration of his work suggested only three subspecies should be recognized. The description of &quot;P. o. palustris&quot; was based on a fossil skull.

By 2005, nine subspecies were considered to be valid taxa:
*&quot;P. o. onca&quot; was a jaguar from Brazil.
*&quot;P. o. peruviana&quot; was a jaguar skull from Peru.
*&quot;P. o. hernandesii&quot; was a jaguar from Mazatlán in Mexico.
*&quot;P. o. palustris&quot; was a fossil jaguar mandible excavated in the Sierras Pampeanas of Córdova District, Argentina.
*&quot;P. o. centralis&quot; was a skull of a male jaguar from Talamanca, Costa Rica.
*&quot;P. o. goldmani&quot; was a jaguar skin from Yohatlan in Campeche, Mexico.
*&quot;P. o. paraguensis&quot; was a skull of a male jaguar from Paraguay.
*&quot;P. o. arizonensis&quot; was a skin and skull of a male jaguar from the vicinity of Cibecue, Arizona.
*&quot;P. o. veraecrucis&quot; was a skull of a male jaguar from San Andrés Tuxtla in Mexico.

Reginald Innes Pocock placed the jaguar in the genus &quot;Panthera&quot; and observed that it shares several morphological features with the leopard (&quot;P. pardus&quot;). He, therefore, concluded that they are most closely related to each other. Results of morphological and genetic research indicate a clinal north–south variation between populations, but no evidence for subspecific differentiation. DNA analysis of 84 jaguar samples from South America revealed that the gene flow between jaguar populations in Colombia was high in the past. Since 2017, the jaguar is considered to be a monotypic taxon, though the modern &quot;Panthera onca onca&quot; is still distinguished from two fossil subspecies, &quot;Panthera onca augusta&quot; and &quot;Panthera onca mesembrina&quot;. However, the 2024 study suggested that the validity of subspecific assignments on both &quot;P. o. augusta&quot; and &quot;P. o. mesembrina&quot; remains unresolved, since both fossil and living jaguars show a considerable variation in morphometry.

===Evolution===

The &quot;Panthera&quot; lineage is estimated to have genetically diverged from the common ancestor of the Felidae around to . Some genetic analyzes place the jaguar as a sister species to the lion with which it diverged , but other studies place the lion closer to the leopard.

The lineage of the jaguar appears to have originated in Africa and spread to Eurasia 1.95–1.77 mya. The living jaguar species is often suggested to have descended from the Eurasian &quot;Panthera gombaszoegensis.&quot; The ancestor of the jaguar entered the American continent via Beringia, the land bridge that once spanned the Bering Strait, Some authors have disputed the close relationship between &quot;P. gombaszoegensis&quot; (which is primarily known from Europe) and the modern jaguar. The oldest fossils of modern jaguars (&quot;P. onca&quot;) have been found in North America dating between 850,000-820,000 years ago. Results of mitochondrial DNA analysis of 37 jaguars indicate that current populations evolved between 510,000 and 280,000 years ago in northern South America and subsequently recolonized North and Central America after the extinction of jaguars there during the Late Pleistocene.

Two extinct subspecies of jaguar are recognized in the fossil record: the North American &quot;P. o. augusta&quot; and South American &quot;P. o. mesembrina&quot;.
==Description==
The jaguar is a compact and muscular animal. It is the largest cat native to the Americas and the third largest in the world, exceeded in size only by the tiger and the lion. It stands tall at the shoulders.
Its size and weight vary considerably depending on sex and region: weights in most regions are normally in the range of . Exceptionally big males have been recorded to weigh as much as .
The smallest females from Middle America weigh about . It is sexually dimorphic, with females typically being 10–20% smaller than males. The length from the nose to the base of the tail varies from . The tail is long and the shortest of any big cat.
Its muscular legs are shorter than the legs of other &quot;Panthera&quot; species with similar body weight.

Size tends to increase from north to south. Jaguars in the Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve on the Pacific coast of central Mexico weighed around .
Jaguars in Venezuela and Brazil are much larger, with average weights of about in males and of about in females.

The jaguar&#x27;s coat ranges from pale yellow to tan or reddish-yellow, with a whitish underside and covered in black spots. The spots and their shapes vary: on the sides, they become rosettes which may include one or several dots. The spots on the head and neck are generally solid, as are those on the tail where they may merge to form bands near the end and create a black tip. They are elongated on the middle of the back, often connecting to create a median stripe, and blotchy on the belly. These patterns serve as camouflage in areas with dense vegetation and patchy shadows.
Jaguars living in forests are often darker and considerably smaller than those living in open areas, possibly due to the smaller numbers of large, herbivorous prey in forest areas.

The jaguar closely resembles the leopard but is generally more robust, with stockier limbs and a more square head. The rosettes on a jaguar&#x27;s coat are larger, darker, fewer in number and have thicker lines, with a small spot in the middle.
It has powerful jaws with the third-highest bite force of all felids, after the tiger and the lion.
It has an average bite force at the canine tip of 887.0 Newton and a bite force quotient at the canine tip of 118.6.
A jaguar can bite with a force of with the canine teeth and at the carnassial notch.

===Color variation===
Melanistic jaguars are also known as black panthers. The black morph is less common than the spotted one.
Black jaguars have been documented in Central and South America. Melanism in the jaguar is caused by deletions in the melanocortin 1 receptor gene and inherited through a dominant allele. Black jaguars occur at higher densities in tropical rainforest and are more active during the daytime. This suggests that melanism provides camouflage in dense vegetation with high illumination.

In 2004, a camera trap in the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains photographed the first documented black jaguar in Northern Mexico. Black jaguars were also photographed in Costa Rica&#x27;s Alberto Manuel Brenes Biological Reserve, in the mountains of the Cordillera de Talamanca, in Barbilla National Park and in eastern Panama.

==Distribution and habitat==
In 1999, the jaguar&#x27;s historic range at the turn of the 20th century was estimated at , stretching from the southern United States through Central America to southern Argentina. By the turn of the 21st century, its global range had decreased to about , with most declines occurring in the southern United States, northern Mexico, northern Brazil, and southern Argentina.
Its present range extends from Mexico through Central America to South America comprising Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, particularly on the Osa Peninsula, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina. It is considered to be locally extinct in El Salvador and Uruguay.

Jaguars have been occasionally sighted in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, with 62 accounts reported in the 20th century.
Between 2012 and 2015, a male vagrant jaguar was recorded in 23 locations in the Santa Rita Mountains. Eight jaguars were photographed in the southwestern US between 1996 and 2024. 

The jaguar prefers dense forest and typically inhabits dry deciduous forests, tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests, rainforests and cloud forests in Central and South America; open, seasonally flooded wetlands, dry grassland and historically also oak forests in the United States. It has been recorded at elevations up to but avoids montane forests. It favors riverine habitat and swamps with dense vegetation cover. In the Mayan forests of Mexico and Guatemala, 11 GPS-collared jaguars preferred undisturbed dense habitat away from roads; females avoided even areas with low levels of human activity, whereas males appeared less disturbed by human population density. A young male jaguar was also recorded in the semi-arid Sierra de San Carlos at a waterhole.

=== Former range ===
In the 19th century, the jaguar was still sighted at the North Platte River north of Longs Peak in Colorado, in coastal Louisiana, northern Arizona and New Mexico.
Multiple verified zoological reports of the jaguar are known in California, two as far north as Monterey in 1814 and 1826. The only record of an active jaguar den with breeding adults and kittens in the United States was in the Tehachapi Mountains of California prior to 1860. The jaguar persisted in California until about 1860.
The last confirmed jaguar in Texas was shot in 1948, southeast of Kingsville, Texas.
In Arizona, a female was shot in the White Mountains in 1963. By the late 1960s, the jaguar was thought to have been extirpated in the United States. Arizona outlawed jaguar hunting in 1969, but by then no females remained, and over the next 25 years only two males were sighted and killed in the state. In 1996, a rancher and hunting guide from Douglas, Arizona came across a jaguar in the Peloncillo Mountains and became a researcher on jaguars, placing trail cameras, which recorded four more jaguars.

==Behavior and ecology==
The jaguar is mostly active at night and during twilight.
However, jaguars living in densely forested regions of the Amazon Rainforest and the Pantanal are largely active by day, whereas jaguars in the Atlantic Forest are primarily active by night.
The activity pattern of the jaguar coincides with the activity of its main prey species. Jaguars are good swimmers and play and hunt in the water, possibly more than tigers. They have been recorded moving between islands and the shore. Jaguars are also good at climbing trees but do so less often than cougars.

===Ecological role===

The adult jaguar is an apex predator, meaning it is at the top of the food chain and is not preyed upon in the wild. The jaguar has also been termed a keystone species, as it is assumed that it controls the population levels of prey such as herbivorous and seed-eating mammals and thus maintains the structural integrity of forest systems.
However, field work has shown this may be natural variability, and the population increases may not be sustained. Thus, the keystone predator hypothesis is not accepted by all scientists.

The jaguar is sympatric with the cougar. In central Mexico, both prey on white-tailed deer, which makes up 54% and 66% of jaguar and cougar&#x27;s prey, respectively. In northern Mexico, the jaguar and the cougar share the same habitat, and their diet overlaps dependent on prey availability. Jaguars seemed to prefer deer and calves. In Mexico and Central America, neither of the two cats are considered to be the dominant predator.
In South America, the jaguar is larger than the cougar and tends to take larger prey, usually over . The cougar&#x27;s prey usually weighs between , which is thought to be the reason for its smaller size.
This situation may be advantageous to the cougar. Its broader prey niche, including its ability to take smaller prey, may give it an advantage over the jaguar in human-altered landscapes.

===Hunting and diet===
The jaguar is an obligate carnivore and depends solely on flesh for its nutrient requirements. An analysis of 53 studies documenting the diet of the jaguar revealed that its prey ranges in weight from ; it prefers prey weighing , with the capybara and the giant anteater being the most selected. When available, it also preys on marsh deer, southern tamandua, collared peccary and black agouti. In floodplains, jaguars opportunistically take reptiles such as green anacondas, turtles and caimans. Consumption of reptiles appears to be more frequent in jaguars than in other big cats. One remote population in the Brazilian Pantanal is recorded to primarily feed on aquatic reptiles and fish.
The jaguar also preys on livestock in cattle ranching areas where wild prey is scarce.
The daily food requirement of a captive jaguar weighing was estimated at of meat.

The jaguar&#x27;s bite force allows it to pierce the carapaces of the yellow-spotted Amazon river turtle and the yellow-footed tortoise. It employs an unusual killing method: it bites mammalian prey directly through the skull between the ears to deliver a fatal bite to the brain. It kills capybara by piercing its canine teeth through the temporal bones of its skull, breaking its zygomatic arch and mandible and penetrating its brain, often through the ears.
It has been hypothesized to be an adaptation to cracking open turtle shells; armored reptiles may have formed an abundant prey base for the jaguar following the late Pleistocene extinctions. However, this is disputed, as even in areas where jaguars prey on reptiles, they are still taken relatively infrequently compared to mammals in spite of their greater abundance.

Between October 2001 and April 2004, 10 jaguars were monitored in the southern Pantanal. In the dry season from April to September, they killed prey at intervals ranging from one to seven days; and ranging from one to 16 days in the wet season from October to March.

The jaguar uses a stalk-and-ambush strategy when hunting rather than chasing prey. The cat will slowly walk down forest paths, listening for and stalking prey before rushing or ambushing. The jaguar attacks from cover and usually from a target&#x27;s blind spot with a quick pounce; the species&#x27; ambushing abilities are considered nearly peerless in the animal kingdom by both indigenous people and field researchers and are probably a product of its role as an apex predator in several different environments. The ambush may include leaping into water after prey, as a jaguar is quite capable of carrying a large kill while swimming; its strength is such that carcasses as large as a heifer can be hauled up a tree to avoid flood levels. After killing prey, the jaguar will drag the carcass to a thicket or other secluded spot. It begins eating at the neck and chest. The heart and lungs are consumed, followed by the shoulders.

===Social activity===

The jaguar is generally solitary except for females with cubs. In 1977, groups consisting of a male, female and cubs, and two females with two males were sighted several times in a study area in the Paraguay River valley. In some areas, males may form paired coalitions which together mark, defend and invade territories, find and mate with the same females and search for and share prey. A radio-collared female moved in a home range of , which partly overlapped with another female. The home range of the male in this study area overlapped with several females.

The jaguar uses scrape marks, urine, and feces to mark its territory.
The size of home ranges depends on the level of deforestation and human population density. The home ranges of females vary from in the Pantanal to in the Amazon to in the Atlantic Forest. Male jaguar home ranges vary from in the Pantanal to in the Amazon to in the Atlantic Forest and in the Cerrado.
Studies employing GPS telemetry in 2003 and 2004 found densities of only six to seven jaguars per in the Pantanal region, compared with 10 to 11 using traditional methods; this suggests the widely used sampling methods may inflate the actual numbers of individuals in a sampling area. Fights between males occur but are rare, and avoidance behavior has been observed in the wild. In one wetland population with degraded territorial boundaries and more social proximity, adults of the same sex are more tolerant of each other and engage in more friendly and co-operative interactions.
The jaguar roars/grunts for long-distance communication; intensive bouts of counter-calling between individuals have been observed in the wild. This vocalization is described as &quot;hoarse&quot; with five or six guttural notes. Chuffing is produced by individuals when greeting, during courting, or by a mother comforting her cubs. This sound is described as low intensity snorts, possibly intended to signal tranquility and passivity. Cubs have been recorded bleating, gurgling and mewing.

===Reproduction and life cycle===
In captivity, the female jaguar is recorded to reach sexual maturity at the age of about 2.5 years. Estrus lasts 7–15 days with an estrus cycle of 41.8 to 52.6 days. During estrus, she exhibits increased restlessness with rolling and prolonged vocalizations.
She is an induced ovulator but can also ovulate spontaneously.
Gestation lasts 91 to 111 days.
The male is sexually mature at the age of three to four years.
His mean ejaculate volume is 8.6±1.3 ml.
Generation length of the jaguar is 9.8 years.

In the Pantanal, breeding pairs were observed to stay together for up to five days. Females had one to two cubs.
The young are born with closed eyes but open them after two weeks. Cubs are weaned at the age of three months but remain in the birth den for six months before leaving to accompany their mother on hunts.
Jaguars remain with their mothers for up to two years. They appear to rarely live beyond 11 years, but captive individuals may live 22 years.

In 2001, a male jaguar killed and partially consumed two cubs in Emas National Park. DNA paternity testing of blood samples revealed that the male was the father of the cubs. Two more cases of infanticide were documented in the northern Pantanal in 2013. To defend against infanticide, the female may hide her cubs and distract the male with courtship behavior.

===Attacks on humans===

The Spanish conquistadors feared the jaguar. According to Charles Darwin, the indigenous peoples of South America stated that people did not need to fear the jaguar as long as capybaras were abundant.
The first official record of a jaguar killing a human in Brazil dates to June 2008.
Two children were attacked by jaguars in Guyana.
The majority of known attacks on people happened when it had been cornered or wounded.

==Threats==

The jaguar is threatened by loss and fragmentation of habitat, illegal killing in retaliation for livestock depredation and for illegal trade in jaguar body parts. It is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List since 2002, as the jaguar population has probably declined by 20–25% since the mid-1990s. Deforestation is a major threat to the jaguar across its range. Habitat loss was most rapid in drier regions such as the Argentine pampas, the arid grasslands of Mexico and the southwestern United States.

In 2002, it was estimated that the range of the jaguar had declined to about 46% of its range in the early 20th century. In 2018, it was estimated that its range had declined by 55% in the last century. The only remaining stronghold is the Amazon rainforest, a region that is rapidly being fragmented by deforestation.
Between 2000 and 2012, forest loss in the jaguar range amounted to , with fragmentation increasing in particular in corridors between Jaguar Conservation Units (JCUs).
By 2014, direct linkages between two JCUs in Bolivia were lost, and two JCUs in northern Argentina became completely isolated due to deforestation.

In Mexico, the jaguar is primarily threatened by poaching. Its habitat is fragmented in northern Mexico, in the Gulf of Mexico and the Yucatán Peninsula, caused by changes in land use, construction of roads and tourism infrastructure.
In Panama, 220 of 230 jaguars were killed in retaliation for predation on livestock between 1998 and 2014.
In Venezuela, the jaguar was extirpated in about 26% of its range in the country since 1940, mostly in dry savannas and unproductive scrubland in the northeastern region of Anzoátegui.
In Ecuador, the jaguar is threatened by reduced prey availability in areas where the expansion of the road network facilitated access of human hunters to forests.
In the Alto Paraná Atlantic forests, at least 117 jaguars were killed in Iguaçu National Park and the adjacent Misiones Province between 1995 and 2008.
Some Afro-Colombians in the Colombian Chocó Department hunt jaguars for consumption and sale of meat.
Between 2008 and 2012, at least 15 jaguars were killed by livestock farmers in central Belize.

The international trade of jaguar skins boomed between the end of the Second World War and the early 1970s.
Significant declines occurred in the 1960s, as more than 15,000 jaguars were yearly killed for their skins in the Brazilian Amazon alone; the trade in jaguar skins decreased since 1973 when the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species was enacted.
Interview surveys with 533 people in the northwestern Bolivian Amazon revealed that local people killed jaguars out of fear, in retaliation, and for trade.
Between August 2016 and August 2019, jaguar skins and body parts were seen for sale in tourist markets in the Peruvian cities of Lima, Iquitos and Pucallpa.
Human-wildlife conflict, opportunistic hunting and hunting for trade in domestic markets are key drivers for killing jaguars in Belize and Guatemala.
Seizure reports indicate that at least 857 jaguars were involved in trade between 2012 and 2018, including 482 individuals in Bolivia alone; 31 jaguars were seized in China.
Between 2014 and early 2019, 760 jaguar fangs were seized that originated in Bolivia and were destined for China. Undercover investigations revealed that the smuggling of jaguar body parts is run by Chinese residents in Bolivia.

==Conservation==
The jaguar is listed on CITES Appendix I, which means that all international commercial trade in jaguars or their body parts is prohibited. Hunting jaguars is prohibited in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, French Guiana, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, the United States, and Venezuela. Hunting jaguars is restricted in Guatemala and Peru. In Ecuador, hunting jaguars is prohibited, and it is classified as threatened with extinction.
In Guyana, it is protected as an endangered species, and hunting it is illegal.

In 1986, the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary was established in Belize as the world&#x27;s first protected area for jaguar conservation.

===Jaguar Conservation Units===
In 1999, field scientists from 18 jaguar range countries determined the most important areas for long-term jaguar conservation based on the status of jaguar population units, stability of prey base and quality of habitat. These areas, called &quot;Jaguar Conservation Units&quot; (JCUs), are large enough for at least 50 breeding individuals and range in size from ; 51 JCUs were designated in 36 geographic regions including:
* the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra de Tamaulipas in Mexico
* the Selva Maya tropical forests extending over Mexico, Belize and Guatemala
* the Chocó–Darién moist forests from Honduras and Panama to Colombia
* Venezuelan Llanos
* northern Cerrado and Amazon basin in Brazil
* Tropical Andes in Bolivia and Peru
* Misiones Province in Argentina

Optimal routes of travel between core jaguar population units were identified across its range in 2010 to implement wildlife corridors that connect JCUs. These corridors represent areas with the shortest distance between jaguar breeding populations, require the least possible energy input of dispersing individuals and pose a low mortality risk. They cover an area of and range in length from in Mexico and Central America and from in South America.
Cooperation with local landowners and municipal, state, or federal agencies is essential to maintain connected populations and prevent fragmentation in both JCUs and corridors.
Seven of 13 corridors in Mexico are functioning with a width of at least and a length of no more than . The other corridors may hamper passage, as they are narrower and longer.

In August 2012, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service set aside in Arizona and New Mexico for the protection of the jaguar. The Jaguar Recovery Plan was published in April 2019, in which Interstate 10 is considered to form the northern boundary of the Jaguar Recovery Unit in Arizona and New Mexico.

In Mexico, a national conservation strategy was developed from 2005 on and published in 2016. The Mexican jaguar population increased from an estimated 4,000 individuals in 2010 to about 4,800 individuals in 2018. This increase is seen as a positive effect of conservation measures that were implemented in cooperation with governmental and non-governmental institutions and landowners.

An evaluation of JCUs from Mexico to Argentina revealed that they overlap with high-quality habitats of about 1,500 mammals to varying degrees. Since co-occurring mammals benefit from the JCU approach, the jaguar has been called an umbrella species.
Central American JCUs overlap with the habitat of 187 of 304 regional endemic amphibian and reptile species, of which 19 amphibians occur only in the jaguar range.

===Approaches===

In setting up protected reserves, efforts generally also have to be focused on the surrounding areas, as jaguars are unlikely to confine themselves to the bounds of a reservation, especially if the population is increasing in size. Human attitudes in the areas surrounding reserves and laws and regulations to prevent poaching are essential to make conservation areas effective.

To estimate population sizes within specific areas and to keep track of individual jaguars, camera trapping and wildlife tracking telemetry are widely used, and feces are sought out with the help of detection dogs to study jaguar health and diet.

Current conservation efforts often focus on educating ranch owners and promoting ecotourism. Ecotourism setups are being used to generate public interest in charismatic animals such as the jaguar while at the same time generating revenue that can be used in conservation efforts. A key concern in jaguar ecotourism is the considerable habitat space the species requires. If ecotourism is used to aid in jaguar conservation, some considerations need to be made as to how existing ecosystems will be kept intact, or how new ecosystems will be put into place that are large enough to support a growing jaguar population.

Conservationists and professionals in Mexico and the United States have established the Northern Jaguar Reserve in northern Mexico. Advocacy for reintroduction of the jaguar to its former range in Arizona and New Mexico have been supported by documentation of natural migrations by individual jaguars into the southern reaches of both states, the recency of extirpation from those regions by human action, and supportive arguments pertaining to biodiversity, ecological, human, and practical considerations.

==In culture and mythology==
In the pre-Columbian Americas, the jaguar was a symbol of power and strength. In the Andes, a jaguar cult disseminated by the early Chavín culture became accepted over most of today&#x27;s Peru by 900 BC. The later Moche culture in northern Peru used the jaguar as a symbol of power in many of their ceramics. In the Muisca religion in Altiplano Cundiboyacense, the jaguar was considered a sacred animal, and people dressed in jaguar skins during religious rituals.
The skins were traded with peoples in the nearby Orinoquía Region.
The name of the Muisca ruler Nemequene was derived from the Chibcha words &quot;nymy&quot; and &quot;quyne&quot;, meaning &quot;force of the jaguar&quot;.

Sculptures with &quot;Olmec were-jaguar&quot; motifs were found on the Yucatán Peninsula in Veracruz and Tabasco; they show stylized jaguars with half-human faces. In the later Maya civilization, the jaguar was known as &quot;balam&quot; or &quot;bolom&quot;&#x27; in many of the Mayan languages, and was used to symbolize warriors and the elite class for being brave, fierce and strong. The cat was associated with the underworld and its image was used to decorate tombs and grave-good vessels. 

The Aztec civilization called the jaguar &quot;ocelotl&quot; and considered it to be the king of the animals. It was believed to be fierce and courageous, but also wise, dignified and careful. The military had two classes of warriors, the &quot;ocelotl&quot; or jaguar warriors and the &quot;cuauhtli&quot; or eagle warriors and each dressed like their representative animal. In addition, members of the royal class would decorate in jaguar skins. The jaguar was considered to be the totem animal of the powerful deities Tezcatlipoca and Tepeyollotl.

A conch shell gorget depicting a jaguar was found in a burial mound in Benton County, Missouri. The gorget shows evenly-engraved lines and measures .
Rock drawings made by the Hopi, Anasazi and Pueblo all over the desert and chaparral regions of the American Southwest show an explicitly spotted cat, presumably a jaguar, as it is drawn much larger than an ocelot.

The jaguar is also used as a symbol in contemporary culture. It is the national animal of Guyana and is featured in its coat of arms.

<text>Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer (; May 21, 1960 – November 28, 1994), also known as the Milwaukee Cannibal or the Milwaukee Monster, was an American serial killer and sex offender who killed and dismembered seventeen men and boys between 1978 and 1991. Many of his later murders involved necrophilia, cannibalism, and the permanent preservation of body parts—typically all or part of the skeleton.

Although he was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD), schizotypal personality disorder (StPD), and a psychotic disorder, Dahmer was found to be legally sane at his trial. He was convicted of fifteen of the sixteen homicides he had committed in Wisconsin and was sentenced to fifteen terms of life imprisonment on February 17, 1992. Dahmer was later sentenced to a sixteenth term of life imprisonment for an additional homicide committed in Ohio in 1978.

On November 28, 1994, Dahmer was beaten to death by Christopher Scarver, a fellow inmate at the Columbia Correctional Institution in Portage, Wisconsin.

==Early life==
===Childhood===
Jeffrey Dahmer was born on May 21, 1960, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the first of two sons to Lionel Herbert Dahmer, a Marquette University chemistry student and later a research chemist, and Joyce Annette Dahmer (), a teletype machine instructor. Lionel was of German and Welsh ancestry, and Joyce was of Norwegian and Irish ancestry.

Some sources report Dahmer was deprived of attention as an infant. Other sources, however, suggest that Dahmer was generally doted upon as an infant and toddler by both parents, although his mother was known to be tense, greedy for both attention and pity, and argumentative with her husband and their neighbors.

As Dahmer entered first grade, Lionel&#x27;s studies kept him away from home much of the time. When he was home, his wife—a hypochondriac who suffered from depression—demanded constant attention and spent an increasing amount of time in bed. On one occasion, she attempted suicide using Equanil. Neither parent devoted much time to their son, who later recollected that, from an early age, he felt &quot;unsure of the solidity of the family&quot;, recalling extreme tension and numerous arguments between his parents during his early years.

Dahmer had been an &quot;energetic and happy child&quot; but became notably subdued after undergoing double hernia surgery shortly before his fourth birthday. At elementary school, Dahmer was regarded as quiet and timid. One teacher recollected she detected early signs of abandonment due to his father&#x27;s absence and mother&#x27;s illnesses, the symptoms of which increased when she became pregnant with her second child. In elementary school, Dahmer had a small number of friends.

In October 1966, the family moved to Doylestown, Ohio. When Joyce gave birth in December, Dahmer was allowed to choose the name of his new baby brother; he chose the name David. The same year, Lionel earned his degree and started work as an analytical chemist in nearby Akron.

From an early age, Dahmer manifested an interest in dead animals. His fascination with dead animals may have begun when, at the age of four, he saw his father removing animal bones from beneath the family home. According to Lionel, Dahmer was &quot;oddly thrilled&quot; by the sound the bones made, and became preoccupied with animal bones, which he initially called his &quot;fiddlesticks&quot;. He occasionally searched beneath and around the family home for additional bones, and explored the bodies of live animals to discover where their bones were located.

In May 1968, the family moved to Bath Township, Summit County, Ohio. This address was their third in two years, and the Dahmers&#x27; sixth address since marriage. The home stood in one and a half acres of woodland, with a small hut a short walk from the house where Dahmer began collecting large insects and the skeletons of small animals, such as chipmunks and squirrels. Some of these remains were preserved in jars of formaldehyde and stored within the hut.

Two years later, during a chicken dinner, Dahmer asked Lionel what would happen if the chicken bones were placed in bleach. Lionel, pleased by what he believed to be his son&#x27;s scientific curiosity, demonstrated how to safely bleach and preserve animal bones. Dahmer incorporated these preserving techniques into his bone collecting. He also began collecting dead animals—including roadkill—which he would dissect and bury beside the hut, with the skulls occasionally placed atop makeshift crosses.

According to one friend, Dahmer explained that he was curious as to how animals &quot;fit together&quot;. In one instance in 1975, Dahmer decapitated the carcass of a dog before nailing the body to a tree and impaling the skull upon a stick in the woodland behind his house. As a &quot;prank&quot;, he later invited a friend to view the display, claiming he had discovered the remains by chance. The same year Lionel taught his son how to preserve animal bones, Joyce began increasing her daily consumption of Equanil, laxatives and sleeping pills, further increasing her emotional distance from her husband and children.

===Adolescence and high school===

From his freshman year at Revere High School, Dahmer was seen as an outcast. By age 14, he had begun drinking beer and hard alcohol in the daylight hours, frequently concealing his liquor inside the jacket he wore to school. When a classmate asked why he was drinking Scotch in a morning history class, Dahmer shrugged and said the alcohol was &quot;my medicine&quot;. Although largely uncommunicative, in his freshman year Dahmer was seen by staff as polite and highly intelligent, but earned only average grades. He was a competitive tennis player and played briefly in the high school band.

When he reached puberty, Dahmer discovered he was gay; he did not tell his parents. In his early teens, he had a brief relationship with another teenage boy, although they never had intercourse. By Dahmer&#x27;s admission, he began fantasizing about dominating and controlling a completely submissive male partner in his early to mid-teens, and his masturbatory fantasies gradually evolved to his focusing on chests and torsos. These fantasies gradually became intertwined with dissection.

When he was about 16, Dahmer conceived a fantasy of rendering unconscious a particular male jogger he found attractive, and then making sexual use of his body. On one occasion, Dahmer concealed himself in bushes with a baseball bat to lie in wait for this man. However, the jogger did not pass by on that particular day. Dahmer later admitted this was his first attempt to attack and render an individual submissive to him.

Dahmer was known to his high school peers as a class clown who often staged pranks, which became known as &quot;Doing a Dahmer&quot;; these included bleating and simulating epileptic seizures or cerebral palsy at school and local stores. Occasionally, Dahmer would perform these antics for money to purchase alcohol.

By 1977, Dahmer&#x27;s grades had declined. His parents hired a private tutor, with limited success. The same year, in an attempt to save their marriage, his parents attended counseling sessions. They continued to quarrel frequently. When Lionel discovered Joyce had engaged in a brief affair in September 1977, they decided to divorce, telling their sons they wished to do so amicably. The process of their divorce soon became increasingly bitter and acrimonious, and Lionel moved out of the house in early 1978, temporarily residing in a motel on North Cleveland Massillon Road.

In May 1978, Dahmer graduated from high school. A few weeks before his graduation, one of his teachers observed Dahmer sitting close to the school parking lot, drinking several cans of beer. When the teacher threatened to report the matter, Dahmer informed him he was experiencing &quot;a lot of problems&quot; at home and that the school&#x27;s guidance counselor was aware of them. That spring, Joyce—contrary to a court order and without informing Lionel—moved out of the family home with David to live with relatives in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. Dahmer had just turned 18 and remained in the family home. Dahmer&#x27;s parents&#x27; divorce was finalized on July 24, 1978. Joyce was awarded custody of their younger son and alimony payments.

==Late teens and early 20s: first murder==
===Murder of Steven Hicks===
Dahmer committed his first murder in 1978, three weeks after his graduation. On June 18, Dahmer picked up a hitchhiker named Steven Mark Hicks, who was 18 years old. Dahmer lured Hicks to his house on the pretext of drinking. Hicks, who had been hitchhiking to a rock concert at Chippewa Lake Park, Ohio, agreed to accompany Dahmer to his house upon the promise of &quot;a few beers&quot; with Dahmer as he had the house to himself.

According to Dahmer, the sight of the bare-chested Hicks standing at the roadside stirred his sexual feelings, although when Hicks began talking about girls, he knew any sexual passes he made would be rebuffed. After several hours of talking, drinking and listening to music, Hicks &quot;wanted to leave and I didn&#x27;t want him to leave&quot;. Dahmer bludgeoned Hicks with a dumbbell. He later stated he struck Hicks twice from behind with the dumbbell as Hicks sat upon a chair. When Hicks fell unconscious, Dahmer strangled him to death with the bar of the dumbbell, then stripped the clothes from Hicks&#x27; body before exploring his chest with his hands, then masturbating as he stood above the corpse. Hours later, Dahmer dragged the body to the basement.

The following day, Dahmer dissected Hicks&#x27; body in his basement. He later buried the remains in a shallow grave in his back yard. Several weeks later, he unearthed the remains and pared the flesh from the bones. He dissolved the flesh in acid before flushing the solution down the toilet; he crushed the bones with a sledgehammer and scattered them in the woodland behind the family home. He threw Hicks&#x27; necklace and the knife used to dismember him from the West Bath Road bridge into the Cuyahoga River.

===College and Army service===
Six weeks after the murder of Hicks, Dahmer&#x27;s father and his fiancée returned to his home, where they discovered Dahmer living alone. That August, Dahmer enrolled at Ohio State University (OSU), hoping to major in business. Dahmer&#x27;s sole term at OSU was completely unproductive, largely because of his persistent alcohol abuse. He received failing grades in Introduction to Anthropology, Classical Civilizations, and Administrative Science. The only course Dahmer was successful at was Riflery, where he received a B− grade. His overall GPA was 0.45/4.0. On one occasion, Lionel paid a surprise visit to his son, only to find his room strewn with empty liquor bottles. Despite his father having paid in advance for the second term, Dahmer dropped out of OSU after just three months.

In January 1979, on his father&#x27;s urging, Dahmer enlisted in the United States Army. He underwent basic training at Fort McClellan in Anniston, Alabama, before training as a medical specialist at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. He was occasionally reprimanded for intoxication while stationed at Fort Sam Houston. On one occasion, an instance of insubordination resulted in his entire platoon being punished, earning Dahmer a severe beating from his fellow recruits.

On July 13, 1979, Dahmer was deployed to Baumholder, West Germany, where he served as a combat medic in the 2nd Battalion, 68th Armored Regiment, 8th Infantry Division. According to published reports, in Dahmer&#x27;s first year of service, he was an &quot;average or slightly above average&quot; soldier.

Owing to Dahmer&#x27;s alcohol abuse, his performance deteriorated, and, in March 1981, he was deemed unsuitable for military service and was later discharged from the Army. He received an honorable discharge, as his superiors did not believe that any problems Dahmer had in the Army would be applicable to civilian life.

On March 24, 1981, Dahmer was sent to Fort Jackson, South Carolina, for debriefing and provided with a plane ticket to travel anywhere in the country. Dahmer later told police he felt he could not return home to face his father, so he opted to travel to Miami Beach, Florida, both because he was &quot;tired of the cold&quot; and in an attempt to live by his own means. In Florida, Dahmer found a job at a delicatessen and rented a room in a nearby motel. He spent most of his salary on alcohol and was soon evicted from the motel for non-payment. Dahmer initially spent his evenings on the beach as he continued to work at the sandwich shop until phoning his father and asking to return to Ohio in September of the same year.

=== Return to Ohio and relocation to West Allis, Wisconsin ===
After his return to Ohio, Dahmer initially lived with his father and stepmother and insisted on being delegated numerous chores to occupy his time while he looked for work. He continued to drink heavily, and two weeks after his return, was arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct. He was fined $60 and given a suspended 10-day jail sentence. Dahmer&#x27;s father tried unsuccessfully to wean his son off alcohol. In December 1981, he and his second wife sent him to live with his paternal grandmother, Catherine Dahmer, in West Allis, Wisconsin. As she was the only family member to whom Dahmer displayed any positivity or affection, they hoped that both her influence and the change of location might persuade him to quit drinking, find a job, and live responsibly.

Initially, Dahmer&#x27;s living arrangements with his grandmother were harmonious: he accompanied her to church, willingly undertook chores, actively sought work, and abided by most of her house rules (although he continued to drink and smoke). In early 1982, he found employment as a phlebotomist at the Milwaukee Blood Plasma Center. He held this job for a total of ten months before being laid off. Dahmer remained unemployed for over two years, during which he lived upon whatever money his grandmother gave him.

Shortly before losing his job, Dahmer was arrested for indecent exposure. On August 8, 1982, at Wisconsin State Fair Park, he was observed exposing himself &quot;on the south side of the Coliseum in which 25 people were present including women and children&quot;. For this incident, he was convicted and fined $50 plus court costs.

In January 1985, Dahmer was hired as a mixer at the Milwaukee Ambrosia Chocolate Factory, where he worked from 11 p.m to 7 a.m. six nights per week, with Saturday evenings off. Shortly after he started this job, an incident occurred in which Dahmer was propositioned by another man while reading in the West Allis Public Library. The stranger threw Dahmer a note offering to perform fellatio upon him. Although Dahmer did not respond to this proposition, the incident stirred the fantasies of control and dominance he had developed as a teenager, and he began to familiarize himself with Milwaukee&#x27;s gay bars, gay bathhouses, and bookstores. He also stole a male mannequin from a store, which he briefly used for sexual stimulation, until his grandmother discovered the item stowed in a closet and demanded that he discard it.

By late 1985, Dahmer had begun to regularly frequent the bathhouses, which he later described as being &quot;relaxing places&quot;, but during his sexual encounters, he became frustrated at his partners&#x27; moving during the act. Following his arrest, he stated: &quot;I trained myself to view people as objects of pleasure instead of [as] people&quot;. For this reason, beginning in June 1986, he administered sleeping pills to his partners, giving them liquor laced with sedatives. He then waited for his partner to fall asleep before performing various sexual acts. To maintain an adequate supply of this medication, Dahmer informed doctors he worked nights and required the tablets to adjust to that schedule. After approximately 12 such instances, the bathhouses&#x27; administration revoked Dahmer&#x27;s membership, and he began to use hotel rooms to continue this practice.

Shortly after his bathhouse memberships were revoked, Dahmer read a report in a newspaper regarding the upcoming funeral of an 18-year-old male. He conceived the idea of stealing the freshly interred corpse and taking it home. According to Dahmer, he attempted to dig up the coffin from the ground but found the soil too hard and abandoned the plan.

On September 8, 1986, Dahmer was arrested upon a charge of lewd and lascivious behavior for masturbating in the presence of two 12-year-old boys as he stood close to the Kinnickinnic River. He initially claimed he had merely been urinating, unaware that there were witnesses, but soon admitted the offense. The charge was changed to disorderly conduct and, on March 10, 1987, Dahmer was sentenced to one year of probation, with additional instructions to undergo counseling.

==Late 20s and early 30s: subsequent murders==
===Ambassador Hotel===
On November 20, 1987, Dahmer, at the time still residing with his grandmother, encountered a 25-year-old man from Ontonagon, Michigan, named Steven Tuomi at a bar and persuaded him to return to the Ambassador Hotel in Milwaukee, where Dahmer had rented a room for the evening. According to Dahmer, he had no intention of killing Tuomi, but intended to simply drug him and lie beside him as he explored his body. The following morning, Dahmer awoke to find Tuomi lying beneath him on the bed, his chest &quot;crushed in&quot; and &quot;black and blue&quot; with bruises. Blood was seeping from the corner of his mouth, and Dahmer&#x27;s fists and one forearm were extensively bruised. Dahmer later said he had no memory of having killed Tuomi, and that he &quot;could not believe this had happened&quot;.

Dahmer purchased a large suitcase, in which he transported Tuomi&#x27;s body to his grandmother&#x27;s residence. One week later, he severed the head, arms, and legs, then filleted the bones from the body before cutting the flesh into pieces small enough to handle. Dahmer placed the flesh inside plastic garbage bags. He wrapped the bones inside a sheet and pounded them into splinters with a sledgehammer. The dismemberment process took Dahmer approximately two hours. He disposed of all of Tuomi&#x27;s remains, excluding the head, in the trash.

For two weeks following Tuomi&#x27;s killing, Dahmer retained Tuomi&#x27;s head wrapped in a blanket. After two weeks, Dahmer boiled the head in a mixture of Soilax (an alkali-based industrial detergent) and bleach in an effort to retain the skull, which he then used as stimulus for masturbation. Eventually, the skull became too brittle by this bleaching process, so Dahmer pulverized and disposed of it.

===Intermediate murders===
According to Dahmer, Tuomi&#x27;s murder was a pivotal incident after which he did not try to control his compulsions. He began to actively seek victims, most of whom he encountered in or around gay bars and would typically lure them to his grandmother&#x27;s home. He would drug his victim with triazolam or temazepam before or shortly after engaging in sexual activity with them. Once his victim was unconscious, he strangled them to death.

Two months after the Tuomi killing, Dahmer encountered a 14-year-old Native American prostitute, James Doxtator. Dahmer lured him to his grandmother&#x27;s residence with an offer of $50 to pose for nude pictures. They engaged in sexual activity before Dahmer drugged Doxtator and strangled him on the floor of the cellar. Dahmer left the body in the cellar for one week before dismembering it in much the same manner as he had with Tuomi. He placed all of Doxtator&#x27;s remains (excluding the skull) in the trash. The skull was boiled and cleansed in bleach before Dahmer found that it, too, had been rendered brittle by the process. He pulverized the skull two weeks later.

On March 24, 1988, Dahmer met a 22-year-old bisexual man, Richard Guerrero, outside a gay bar called the Phoenix. Dahmer lured Guerrero to his grandmother&#x27;s residence, offering him $50 to spend the night with him. He drugged Guerrero with sleeping pills, strangled him with a leather strap, and performed oral sex on the corpse. Dahmer dismembered Guerrero&#x27;s body within 24 hours, again disposing of the remains in the trash and retaining the skull before pulverizing it several months later.

On April 2, Dahmer lured Ronald Flowers Jr. to his house; however, after giving Flowers a drugged coffee, both he and Flowers heard Dahmer&#x27;s grandmother call, &quot;Is that you, Jeff?&quot; Although Dahmer replied in a manner that led his grandmother to believe he was alone, she observed that he was not alone. Because of this, Dahmer was unable to kill Flowers. After Flowers became unconscious, Dahmer took him to the County General Hospital.

In September 1988, Dahmer&#x27;s grandmother asked him to move out, largely because of his drinking, his habit of bringing young men to her house late at night, and the foul smells emanating from the basement and the garage. Dahmer found a one-bedroom apartment at 808 North 24th Street and moved into the residence on September 25. Two days later, he was arrested for drugging and sexually fondling a 13-year-old boy whom he had lured to his home on the pretext of posing nude for photographs.

Dahmer&#x27;s father hired attorney Gerald Boyle to defend his son. At Boyle&#x27;s request, Dahmer underwent a series of psychological evaluations prior to his court hearings. The evaluations found that Dahmer harbored deep feelings of alienation. A second evaluation two months later revealed Dahmer to be an impulsive individual, suspicious of others, and dismayed by his lack of accomplishments in life. His probation officer also referenced a 1987 diagnosis of Dahmer suffering from a schizoid personality disorder for presentation to the court.

On January 30, 1989, Dahmer pleaded guilty to the charges of second-degree sexual assault and of enticing a child for immoral purposes. Sentencing was suspended until May. On March 20, Dahmer commenced a ten-day Easter absence from work, during which he moved back into his grandmother&#x27;s home.

Two months after his conviction and two months prior to his sentencing, Dahmer murdered his fifth victim, a 24-year-old mixed-race aspiring model, Anthony Sears, whom he met at a gay bar on March 25, 1989. According to Dahmer, on this particular occasion he was not looking to commit a crime; however, shortly before closing time that evening, Sears &quot;just started talking to me&quot;. Dahmer lured Sears to his grandmother&#x27;s home, where the pair engaged in oral sex before Dahmer drugged and strangled Sears.

The following morning, Dahmer placed the corpse in his grandmother&#x27;s bathtub, where he decapitated the body before attempting to flay the corpse. He stripped the flesh from the body and pulverized the bones, which he disposed of in the trash. According to Dahmer, he found Sears &quot;exceptionally attractive&quot;, and Sears was the first victim from whom he permanently retained any body parts: he preserved Sears&#x27; head and genitalia in acetone and stored them in a wooden box, which he later placed in his work locker. When he moved to a new address the following year, he took the remains there.

On May 23, 1989, Dahmer was sentenced to five years&#x27; probation and one year in the House of Correction, with work release permitted so he could keep his job. He was also required to register as a sex offender. Two months before his scheduled release, Dahmer was paroled from this regimen. His five years&#x27; probation imposed in 1989 began at this point. Dahmer temporarily moved back to his grandmother&#x27;s home in West Allis.

===Oxford Apartments===

====1990 murders====
On May 14, 1990, Dahmer moved out of his grandmother&#x27;s house and into 924 North 25th Street, Apartment 213, taking Sears&#x27; mummified head and genitals with him. Although located in a high-crime area, Dahmer&#x27;s new apartment was close to his workplace, was furnished, and at $300 per month inclusive of all bills excluding electricity, was economical. Within one week of his moving to this address, Dahmer killed his sixth victim, Raymond Smith. Smith was a 32-year-old prostitute whom Dahmer lured to his apartment with the promise of $50 for sex. Inside the apartment, he gave Smith a drink laced with seven sleeping pills, then manually strangled him.

The following day, Dahmer purchased a Polaroid camera, with which he took several pictures of Smith&#x27;s body in suggestive positions before dismembering him in the bathroom. He boiled the legs, arms, and pelvis in a steel kettle with Soilax, which allowed him to rinse the bones in his sink. Dahmer dissolved the remainder of Smith&#x27;s skeleton—excluding the skull—in a container filled with acid. He later spray-painted Smith&#x27;s skull, which he placed alongside the skull of Sears upon a black towel inside a filing cabinet.

Approximately one week after the murder of Smith, on or about May 27, Dahmer lured another young man to his apartment. On this occasion, Dahmer accidentally consumed the drink laden with sedatives intended for his guest. When he awoke the following day, he discovered the man had stolen several items of clothing, $300 and a watch. Dahmer never reported this incident to the police, although on May 29, he divulged to his probation officer that he had been robbed.

In June 1990, Dahmer lured a 27-year-old acquaintance, Edward Smith, to his apartment, where he drugged and strangled him. On this occasion, rather than immediately acidifying the skeleton or repeating previous processes of bleaching, which had rendered previous victims&#x27; skulls brittle, Dahmer placed Smith&#x27;s skeleton in his freezer for several months in the hope it would not retain moisture. Freezing the skeleton did not remove moisture, and the skeleton of this victim was acidified several months later. Dahmer accidentally destroyed the skull when he placed it in the oven to dry—a process that caused the skull to explode. Dahmer later informed police he had felt &quot;rotten&quot; about Smith&#x27;s murder, as he had been unable to retain any parts of his body.

Less than three months after the murder of Edward Smith, Dahmer encountered a 22-year-old Chicago native named Ernest Miller outside a bookstore on the corner of North 27th Street. Miller agreed to accompany Dahmer to his apartment for $50 and further agreed to allow him to listen to his heart and stomach. When Dahmer attempted to perform oral sex upon Miller, he was informed, &quot;That&#x27;ll cost you extra&quot;, whereupon Dahmer gave Miller a drink laced with two sleeping pills.

On this occasion, Dahmer had only two sleeping pills to give his victim. Therefore, he killed Miller by slashing his carotid artery with the same knife he used to dissect his victims&#x27; bodies. Miller bled to death within minutes. Dahmer then posed the nude body for various suggestive Polaroid photographs before placing it in his bathtub for dismemberment. Dahmer repeatedly kissed and talked to the severed head while he dismembered the remainder of the body.

Dahmer wrapped Miller&#x27;s heart, liver, biceps, and portions of flesh from the legs in plastic bags and placed them in the freezer for later consumption. He boiled the remaining flesh and organs into a &quot;jelly-like substance&quot; using Soilax, which enabled him to rinse the flesh off the skeleton, which he intended to retain. To preserve the skeleton, Dahmer placed the bones in a light bleach solution for 24 hours before allowing them to dry upon a cloth for one week. The severed head was initially placed in the refrigerator before being stripped of flesh, then painted and coated with enamel.

Three weeks after the murder of Miller, on September 24, Dahmer encountered a 22-year-old father of two named David Thomas at the Grand Avenue Mall. He persuaded him to return to his apartment for a few drinks, with additional money on offer if he would pose for photographs. In his statement to police after his arrest, Dahmer said that, after giving Thomas a drink laden with sedatives, he did not feel attracted to him, but was afraid to allow him to awaken, fearing that he would be angry over having been drugged. Therefore, he strangled him and dismembered the body—intentionally retaining no body parts whatsoever. He photographed the dismemberment process and retained these photographs, which later aided in Thomas&#x27;s identification.

Following the murder of Thomas, Dahmer did not kill anyone for almost five months, although on a minimum of five occasions between October 1990 and February 1991, he unsuccessfully attempted to lure men to his apartment. He regularly complained of feelings of both anxiety and depression to his probation officer throughout 1990, with frequent references to his sexuality, his solitary lifestyle, financial difficulties, and—shortly before Thanksgiving—his apprehension regarding meeting and facing his father and younger brother. On several occasions, Dahmer also referred to harboring suicidal thoughts.

====1991 murders====
In February 1991, Dahmer observed a 17-year-old named Curtis Straughter standing at a bus stop near Marquette University. According to Dahmer, he lured Straughter into his apartment with an offer of money for posing for nude photos, with the added incentive of sexual intercourse. Dahmer drugged Straughter, cuffed his hands behind his back, then strangled him to death with a leather strap. He then dismembered Straughter, retaining his skull, hands, and genitals and photographing each stage of the dismemberment process.

Less than two months later, on April 7, Dahmer encountered a 19-year-old named Errol Lindsey walking to get a key cut. Dahmer lured Lindsey to his apartment where he drugged him, then drilled a hole in his skull through which he injected hydrochloric acid with a baster. According to Dahmer, Lindsey awoke after this experiment (which Dahmer had conceived in the hope of inducing a permanent, unresistant, submissive state), saying: &quot;I have a headache. What time is it?&quot; In response to this, Dahmer again drugged Lindsey, then strangled him. He decapitated Lindsey and retained his skull. He then flayed Lindsey&#x27;s body, placing the skin in a solution of cold water and salt for several weeks in the hope of permanently retaining it. Reluctantly, he disposed of Lindsey&#x27;s skin when he noted it had become too frayed and brittle.

By 1991, fellow residents of the Oxford Apartments had repeatedly complained to the building&#x27;s manager, Sopa Princewill, of the foul smells emanating from Apartment 213, in addition to the sounds of falling objects and the occasional sound of a chainsaw. Princewill contacted Dahmer in response to these complaints on several occasions, although he initially excused the odors emanating from his apartment as being caused by his freezer breaking, causing the contents to become &quot;spoiled&quot;. On later occasions, he informed Princewill that the reason for the resurgence of the odor was that several of his tropical fish had recently died, and that he would take care of the matter.

On May 24, 1991, Dahmer encountered 31-year-old aspiring model Tony Hughes at a nightclub. He was lured to Dahmer&#x27;s apartment with an offer of money to pose for photographs. Hughes was drugged into unconsciousness before Dahmer injected hydrochloric acid into his skull in an effort to disable his will and render him submissive, although on this occasion, the drilling and injection proved fatal.
On the afternoon of May 26, 1991, Dahmer encountered a 14-year-old Lao teenager, Konerak Sinthasomphone, on Wisconsin Avenue. Unknown to Dahmer, Sinthasomphone was the younger brother of the boy he had molested in 1988. Dahmer offered Sinthasomphone money to accompany him to his apartment to pose for Polaroid pictures. According to Dahmer, Sinthasomphone was initially reluctant to the proposal, before changing his mind and accompanying him to his apartment, where he posed for two pictures in his underwear before Dahmer drugged him into unconsciousness and performed oral sex on him. Before Sinthasomphone fell unconscious, Dahmer led the boy into his bedroom, where the body of Tony Hughes, whom Dahmer had killed three days earlier, lay naked on the floor. According to Dahmer, he &quot;believed [that Sinthasomphone] saw this body&quot; yet did not react to seeing the bloated corpse—likely because of the effects of the sleeping pills he had ingested.

On this occasion, Dahmer drilled a single narrow hole into the crown of Sinthasomphone&#x27;s skull, through which he injected hydrochloric acid into the frontal lobe. Dahmer then drank several beers while lying alongside Sinthasomphone before briefly falling asleep, then leaving his apartment to drink at a bar and purchase more alcohol.

In the early morning hours of May 27, Dahmer returned toward his apartment to discover Sinthasomphone sitting naked on the corner of 25th and State, talking in Lao, with three distressed young women standing near him. Dahmer approached the women and told them that Sinthasomphone (whom he referred to by the alias John Hmong) was his friend, and attempted to lead him to his apartment by the arm. The three women dissuaded Dahmer, explaining they had phoned 9-1-1.

Upon the arrival of two Milwaukee police officers, John Balcerzak and Joseph Gabrish, Dahmer&#x27;s demeanor relaxed: he told the officers that Sinthasomphone was his 19-year-old boyfriend, that he had drunk too much following a quarrel, and that he frequently behaved in this manner when intoxicated. Dahmer added his lover had consumed Jack Daniel&#x27;s whiskey that evening.

The three women were exasperated, and when one of the trio attempted to indicate to one of the officers—both of whom had observed no injuries beyond a scrape to Sinthasomphone&#x27;s knee and believed him to be intoxicated—that Sinthasomphone had blood upon his testicles, was bleeding from his rectum and that he had seemingly struggled against Dahmer&#x27;s attempts to walk him to his apartment prior to their arrival, the officer harshly informed her to &quot;butt out&quot;, &quot;shut the hell up&quot; and to not interfere.

Shortly after the arrival of the Milwaukee police officers, three members of the Milwaukee Fire Department arrived at the scene. These individuals also examined Sinthasomphone for injuries and provided a yellow blanket for the police officers to cover Sinthasomphone. One of the three believed Sinthasomphone needed treatment, but the police officers directed the fire department personnel to leave. Shortly thereafter, officer Richard Porubcan arrived at the scene. He and Gabrish—followed by Balcerzak—escorted Dahmer and Sinthasomphone to Dahmer&#x27;s apartment as Dahmer repeatedly commented on the general crime in the neighborhood and of his appreciation of the police.

Inside his apartment and in an effort to verify his claim that he and Sinthasomphone were lovers, Dahmer showed the officers the two semi-nude Polaroid pictures he had taken of Sinthasomphone the previous evening. Though Balcerzak said he smelled nothing unusual, Gabrish later stated he noted a strange scent reminiscent of excrement inside the apartment. This odor emanated from the decomposing body of Hughes. Dahmer stated that to investigate this odor, one officer simply &quot;peeked his head around the bedroom, but really didn&#x27;t take a good look&quot;. The officers then left, with a departing remark that Dahmer &quot;take good care&quot; of Sinthasomphone. This incident was listed by the officers as a &quot;domestic dispute&quot;.

Upon the departure of the three officers from his apartment, Dahmer again injected hydrochloric acid into Sinthasomphone&#x27;s brain. This second injection proved fatal. The following day, May 28, Dahmer took a day&#x27;s leave from work to devote himself to the dismemberment of the bodies of Sinthasomphone and Hughes. He retained both victims&#x27; skulls.

On June 30, Dahmer traveled to Chicago, where he encountered a 20-year-old named Matt Turner at a bus station. Turner accepted Dahmer&#x27;s offer to travel to Milwaukee for a professional photo shoot. At the apartment, Dahmer drugged, strangled and dismembered Turner and placed his head and internal organs in separate plastic bags in the freezer. Turner was not reported missing. Five days later, on July 5, Dahmer lured 23-year-old Jeremiah Weinberger from a Chicago bar to his apartment on the promise of spending the weekend with him. He drugged Weinberger and twice injected boiling water through his skull, sending him into a coma from which he died two days later.

On July 15, Dahmer encountered 24-year-old Oliver Lacy at the corner of 27th and Kilbourn. Lacy agreed to Dahmer&#x27;s ruse of posing nude for photographs and accompanied him to his apartment, where the pair engaged in tentative sexual activity before Dahmer drugged Lacy. On this occasion, Dahmer intended to prolong the time he spent with Lacy while alive. After unsuccessfully attempting to render Lacy unconscious with chloroform, he phoned his workplace to request a day&#x27;s absence; this was granted, although the next day, he was suspended.

After strangling Lacy, Dahmer had sex with the corpse before dismembering him. He placed Lacy&#x27;s head and heart in the refrigerator and his skeleton in the freezer. Four days later, on July 19, Dahmer received word that he was dismissed. Upon receipt of this news, Dahmer lured 25-year-old Joseph Bradehoft to his apartment. Bradehoft was strangled and left lying on Dahmer&#x27;s bed covered with a sheet for two days. On July 21, Dahmer removed the sheet to find the head covered in maggots. He decapitated the body, cleaned the head and placed it in the refrigerator. He later acidified Bradehoft&#x27;s torso, along with those of two other victims killed within the previous month.

==Arrest==
===Capture===
On July 22, 1991, Dahmer approached three men with an offer of $100 to accompany him to his apartment to pose for nude photographs, drink beer and simply keep him company. One of the trio, 32-year-old Tracy Edwards, agreed to accompany him to his apartment. Upon entering Dahmer&#x27;s apartment, Edwards noted a foul odor and several boxes of hydrochloric acid on the floor, which Dahmer claimed to use for cleaning bricks. After some minor conversation, Edwards responded to Dahmer&#x27;s request to turn his head and view his tropical fish, whereupon Dahmer placed a handcuff upon his wrist. When Edwards asked, &quot;What&#x27;s happening?&quot; Dahmer unsuccessfully attempted to cuff his wrists together, then told Edwards to accompany him to the bedroom to pose for nude pictures. While inside the bedroom, Edwards noted nude male posters on the wall and that a videotape of &quot;The Exorcist III&quot; was playing. He also noted a blue 57-gallon drum in the corner, from which a strong odor emanated.

Dahmer then brandished a knife and informed Edwards he intended to take nude pictures of him. In an attempt to appease Dahmer, Edwards unbuttoned his shirt, saying he would allow him to do so if he would remove the handcuffs and put the knife away. In response to this promise, Dahmer simply turned his attention towards the TV. Edwards observed Dahmer rocking back and forth and chanting before turning his attention back to him. He placed his head on Edwards&#x27; chest, listened to his heartbeat and, with the knife pressed against his intended victim, informed Edwards he intended to eat his heart.

In continuous attempts to prevent Dahmer from attacking him, Edwards repeated that he was Dahmer&#x27;s friend and that he was not going to run away. Edwards had decided he was going to either jump from a window or run through the unlocked front door upon the next available opportunity. When Edwards next stated he needed to use the bathroom, he asked if they could sit with a beer in the living room, where there was air conditioning. Dahmer consented, and the pair walked to the living room when Edwards exited the bathroom. Inside the living room, Edwards waited until he observed Dahmer have a momentary lapse of concentration before requesting to use the bathroom again. When Edwards rose from the couch, he noted Dahmer was not holding the handcuffs, whereupon Edwards punched him in the face, knocking Dahmer off balance, and ran out the front door.

At 11:30 p.m. on July 22, Edwards flagged down two Milwaukee police officers, Robert Rauth and Rolf Mueller, at the corner of North 25th Street. The officers noted Edwards had a handcuff attached to his wrist, whereupon he explained to the officers that a &quot;freak&quot; had placed the handcuffs upon him and asked if the police could remove them. When the officers&#x27; handcuff keys failed to fit the brand of handcuffs, Edwards agreed to accompany the officers to the apartment where, Edwards stated, he had spent the previous five hours before escaping.

When the officers and Edwards arrived at Apartment 213, Dahmer invited the trio inside and acknowledged he had placed the handcuffs upon Edwards, although he offered no explanation as to why he had done so. At this point, Edwards divulged to the officers that Dahmer had also brandished a large knife upon him and that this had happened in the bedroom. Dahmer made no comment to this revelation, indicating to one of the officers, Mueller, that the key to the handcuffs was in his bedside dresser. As Mueller entered the bedroom, Dahmer attempted to pass Mueller to retrieve the key himself, whereupon the second officer present, Rauth, informed him to &quot;back off&quot;.

In the bedroom, Mueller noted there was a large knife beneath the bed. He saw an open drawer that, upon closer inspection, contained scores of Polaroid pictures—many of which were of human bodies in various stages of dismemberment. Mueller noted the decor indicated they had been taken in the same apartment in which they were standing. Mueller walked into the living room to show them to his partner, uttering the words, &quot;These are for real.&quot;

When Dahmer saw that Mueller was holding several of his Polaroids, he fought with the officers in an effort to resist arrest. The officers quickly overpowered him, cuffed his hands behind his back, and called a second squad car for backup. At this point, Mueller opened the refrigerator to reveal the freshly severed head of a black male on the bottom shelf. As Dahmer lay pinned on the floor beneath Rauth, he turned his head towards the officers and muttered the words: &quot;For what I did I should be dead.&quot;

A more detailed search of the apartment, conducted by the Milwaukee police&#x27;s Criminal Investigation Bureau, revealed a total of four severed heads in Dahmer&#x27;s kitchen. A total of seven skulls—some painted, some bleached—were found in Dahmer&#x27;s bedroom and inside a closet. Investigators discovered collected blood drippings upon a tray at the bottom of Dahmer&#x27;s refrigerator, plus two human hearts and a portion of arm muscle, each wrapped inside plastic bags upon the shelves. In Dahmer&#x27;s freezer, investigators discovered an entire torso, plus a bag of human organs and flesh stuck to the ice at the bottom.
Elsewhere in Apartment 213, investigators discovered two entire skeletons, a pair of severed hands, two severed and preserved penises, a mummified scalp and, in the 57-gallon drum, three further dismembered torsos dissolving in the acid solution. A total of 74 Polaroid pictures detailing the dismemberment of Dahmer&#x27;s victims were found. In reference to the recovery of body parts and artifacts at 924 North 25th Street, the chief medical examiner later stated: &quot;It was more like dismantling someone&#x27;s museum than an actual crime scene.&quot;

===Confession===
Beginning in the early hours of July 23, 1991, Dahmer was questioned by Detective Patrick Kennedy as to the murders he had committed and the evidence found at his apartment. Over the following two weeks, Kennedy and, later, Detective Dennis Murphy conducted numerous interviews with Dahmer that, when combined, totaled over 60 hours. Dahmer waived his right to have a lawyer present throughout his interrogations, adding he wished to confess all as he had &quot;created this horror and it only makes sense I do everything to put an end to it&quot;. He readily admitted to having murdered sixteen young men in Wisconsin since 1987, with one further victim—Steven Hicks—killed in Ohio in 1978.

Most of Dahmer&#x27;s victims had been rendered unconscious prior to their murder, although some had died as a result of having acid or boiling water injected into their brain. As he had no memory of the killing of his second victim, Steven Tuomi, he was unsure whether he was unconscious when beaten to death, although he did concede it was possible that his viewing the exposed chest of Tuomi while in a drunken stupor may have led him to unsuccessfully attempt to tear Tuomi&#x27;s heart from his chest. Almost all the murders Dahmer committed after moving into the Oxford Apartments had involved a ritual of posing the victims&#x27; bodies in suggestive positions—typically with the chest thrust outwards—prior to dismemberment.

Dahmer readily admitted to engaging in necrophilia with several of his victims&#x27; bodies, including performing sexual acts with their viscera as he dismembered their bodies in his bathtub. Having noted that much of the blood pooled inside his victims&#x27; chest after death, Dahmer first removed their internal organs, then suspended the torso so the blood drained into his bathtub, before dicing any organs he did not wish to retain and paring the flesh from the body. The bones he wished to dispose of were pulverized or acidified, with Soilax and bleach solutions used to aid in the preservation of the skeletons and skulls he wished to keep. Dahmer confessed to having consumed the hearts, liver, biceps, and portions of thigh of three victims he had killed at the Oxford Apartments (Raymond Smith, Ernest Miller and Oliver Lacy), and to have retained the flesh and organs of other victims for intended consumption. Typically, Dahmer would tenderize the body parts he intended to consume prior to preparing meals flavored with various condiments.

Referencing his reasons for consuming his victims, Dahmer stated he had initially consumed portions of his victims due to &quot;curiosity&quot; before adding: &quot;I suppose, in an odd way, it made me feel they were even more a permanent part of me.&quot;

Describing the increase in his rate of killing in the two months prior to his arrest, Dahmer stated he had been &quot;completely swept along&quot; with his compulsion to kill, adding: &quot;It was an incessant and never-ending desire to be with someone at whatever cost. Someone good looking, really nice looking. It just filled my thoughts all day long.&quot; When asked as to why he had preserved a total of seven skulls and the entire skeletons of two victims, Dahmer stated he had been in the process of constructing a private altar of victims&#x27; skulls which he had intended to display on the black table located in his living room and upon which he had photographed the bodies of many of his victims.
This display of skulls was to be adorned at each side with the complete skeletons of Miller and Lacy. The four severed heads found in his kitchen were to have all flesh removed and used in this altar, as was the skull of at least one future victim. Incense sticks were to be placed at each end of the black table, above which Dahmer intended to place a large blue lamp with extending blue globe lights. The entire construction was to be placed before a window covered with a black, opaque shower curtain, in front of which Dahmer intended to sit in a black leather chair.

When asked in a November 18, 1991, interview to whom the altar was dedicated, Dahmer replied: &quot;Myself ... It was a place where I could feel at home.&quot; He further described his intended altar as a &quot;place for meditation&quot;, from where he believed he could draw a sense of power, adding: &quot;If this [his arrest] had happened six months later, that&#x27;s what they would have found.&quot;

===Indictment===
On July 25, 1991, Dahmer was charged with four counts of first-degree murder. By August 22, he had been charged with a further eleven murders committed in Wisconsin. On September 14, investigators in Ohio, having uncovered hundreds of bone fragments in woodland behind the address in which Dahmer had confessed to killing his first victim, formally identified two molars and a vertebra with X-ray records of Hicks. Three days later, Dahmer was charged by authorities in Ohio with Hicks&#x27; murder.

Dahmer was not charged with the attempted murder of Edwards, nor with the murder of Tuomi. He was not charged with Tuomi&#x27;s murder because the district attorney only brought charges where murder could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt and Dahmer had no memory of actually committing this particular murder, for which no physical evidence of the crime existed. At a scheduled preliminary hearing on January 13, 1992, Dahmer pleaded guilty but insane to 15 counts of murder.

==Trial==
Dahmer&#x27;s trial began on January 30, 1992. He was tried in Milwaukee for the 15 counts of first-degree murder before Judge Laurence Gram. By pleading guilty on January 13 to the charges brought against him, Dahmer had waived his rights to a trial to establish guilt, as defined in Wisconsin law. Attorneys at Dahmer&#x27;s trial debated whether he suffered from either a mental or a personality disorder. The prosecution claimed that any disorders did not deprive Dahmer of the ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to deprive him of the ability to resist his impulses. The defense argued that Dahmer suffered from a mental disease and was driven by obsessions and impulses he was unable to control.

Defense experts argued that Dahmer was insane due to his necrophilic drive—his compulsion to have sexual encounters with corpses. Defense expert Fred Berlin testified that Dahmer was unable to conform his conduct at the time that he committed the crimes due to his paraphilia or, more specifically, necrophilia. Judith Becker, a professor of psychiatry and psychology, was the second expert witness for the defense. Becker diagnosed Dahmer as a necrophiliac, although she added Dahmer had informed her, he preferred comatose sexual partners to deceased ones &quot;75 percent&quot; of the time. The final defense expert to testify, forensic psychiatrist Carl Wahlstrom, diagnosed Dahmer with necrophilia, borderline personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, alcohol dependence, and a psychotic disorder.

On February 8, Fred Fosdal testified on behalf of the prosecution. Fosdal testified to his belief that Dahmer was without mental disease or defect at the time he committed the murders. He described Dahmer as a calculating and cunning individual, able to differentiate between right and wrong, with the ability to control his actions, and whose lust overpowered his morals. Although Fosdal did state his belief that Dahmer was a paraphiliac, his conclusion was that Dahmer was not a sadist.

The second and final witness to appear for the prosecution, forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz, began his testimony on February 12. Dietz testified that he did not believe Dahmer had any form of mental disease or defect at the time that he committed the crimes, stating that &quot;Dahmer went to great lengths to be alone with his victim and to have no witnesses.&quot; He explained that there was ample evidence that Dahmer prepared in advance for each murder, and therefore, his crimes were not impulsive. Although Dietz did concede any acquisition of a paraphilia was not a matter of personal choice, he stated his belief that Dahmer&#x27;s habit of becoming intoxicated prior to committing each of the murders was significant; &quot;If he had an impulse to kill or a compulsion to kill&quot;, Dietz testified, &quot;he wouldn&#x27;t have to drink alcohol to overcome it. He only has to drink alcohol to overcome it because he is inhibited against killing.&quot;

Dietz noted that Dahmer strongly identified with the villains of &quot;The Exorcist III&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, particularly the level of power held by these characters. Expounding on the significance of these movies on Dahmer&#x27;s psyche and many of the murders committed at the Oxford Apartments, Dietz explained that Dahmer occasionally viewed scenes from these films before searching for a victim. Dietz diagnosed Dahmer with substance use disorder, paraphilia, and schizotypal personality disorder.

Forensic psychiatrist George Palermo and clinical psychologist Samuel Friedman testified about Dahmer&#x27;s pathology independently of either prosecution or defense. Palermo stated that Dahmer was motivated to commit murder by a &quot;pent-up aggression within himself. He killed those men because he wanted to kill the source of his homosexual attraction to them. In killing them, he killed what he hated in himself.&quot; Palermo concluded that Dahmer had a severe mixed personality disorder, with antisocial, obsessive-compulsive, sadistic, fetishistic, borderline and necrophilic features, but otherwise legally sane.

Friedman testified that it was a longing for companionship that caused Dahmer to kill and testified that Dahmer was not psychotic. He described Dahmer as &quot;amiable, pleasant to be with, courteous, with a sense of humor, conventionally handsome, and charming in manner. He was, and still is, a bright young man.&quot; He diagnosed Dahmer with a personality disorder not otherwise specified featuring borderline, obsessive-compulsive, and sadistic traits.

===Closing arguments===
The trial lasted two weeks. On February 14, both attorneys delivered their closing arguments to the jury. Each attorney was allowed to speak for two hours. Defense attorney Gerald Boyle argued first. Repeatedly referring to the testimony of the mental health professionals—almost all of whom had agreed Dahmer was afflicted with a mental disease—Boyle argued that Dahmer&#x27;s compulsive killings had been a result of &quot;a sickness he discovered, not chose&quot;. Boyle portrayed Dahmer as a desperately lonely and profoundly sick individual &quot;so out of control he could not conform his conduct anymore&quot;.

Following the defense counsel&#x27;s 75-minute closing argument, Michael McCann delivered his closing argument for the prosecution, describing Dahmer as a sane man, in full control of his actions, who simply strove to avoid detection. McCann described Dahmer as a calculating individual who killed to control his victims and retained their bodies &quot;merely to afford&quot; himself a prolonged period of sexual pleasure. McCann argued that by pleading guilty but insane to the charges, Dahmer was seeking to escape responsibility for his crimes.

===Conviction===
On February 15, the court reconvened to hear the verdict: Dahmer was ruled to be sane and not suffering from a mental disorder at the time of each of the 15 murders for which he was tried, although in each count, two of the twelve jurors signified their dissent. Formal sentencing was postponed until February 17. On this date, Dahmer&#x27;s attorney announced his client wished to address the court. Dahmer then approached a lectern and read from a statement prepared by himself and his defense as he faced the judge.

In this statement, Dahmer emphasized that he had never desired freedom following his arrest, and that he &quot;frankly&quot; wished for his own death. He further stressed that none of his murders had been motivated by hatred, that he understood that nothing he either said or did could &quot;undo the terrible harm&quot; he had caused to the families of his victims and the city of Milwaukee, and that he and his doctors believed his criminal behavior had been motivated by mental disorders. Dahmer added that this medical knowledge had given him &quot;some peace&quot;, and that although he understood that society would never forgive him, he hoped God would. Dahmer closed his statement with: &quot;I know my time in prison will be terrible, but I deserve whatever I get because of what I have done. Thank you, your honor, and I am prepared for your sentence, which I know will be the maximum. I ask for no consideration.&quot; He then returned to his seat to await formal sentencing.

Dahmer was then sentenced to life imprisonment plus ten years upon the first two counts. The remaining thirteen counts carried a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment plus seventy years. The death penalty was not an option for Judge Gram to consider at the penalty phase, as Wisconsin had abolished capital punishment in 1853.

Upon hearing of Dahmer&#x27;s sentencing, his father Lionel and stepmother Shari requested to be allowed a ten-minute private meeting with their son before he was transferred to the Columbia Correctional Institution in Portage, to begin his sentence. This request was granted, and the trio exchanged hugs and well-wishes before Dahmer was escorted away.

Three months after his conviction in Milwaukee, Dahmer was extradited to Ohio to be tried for the murder of his first victim, Steven Hicks. In a court hearing lasting just 45 minutes, Dahmer again pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to a 16th term of life imprisonment on May 1, 1992.

==Imprisonment==
Upon sentencing, Dahmer was transferred to the Columbia Correctional Institution. For the first year of his incarceration, Dahmer was placed in solitary confinement due to concerns for his physical safety should he come into contact with fellow inmates. He received ample correspondence from individuals across the world, with several individuals donating money which he spent on items such as cassette recordings, stationery, cigarettes, and magazines. Upon Dahmer&#x27;s request, after one year in solitary confinement, he was transferred to a less secure unit, where he was assigned a two-hour daily work detail cleaning the toilet block. This work detail later expanded to include cleaning the prison gymnasium.

Shortly after completing his lengthy confessions in 1991, Dahmer had requested to Detective Murphy that he be given a copy of the Bible. This request was granted and Dahmer gradually devoted himself to Christianity and became a born-again Christian. On his father&#x27;s urging, he also read creationist books from the Institute for Creation Research. In May 1994, Dahmer was baptized by Roy Ratcliff, a minister in the Church of Christ and a graduate of Oklahoma Christian University whom he had met on April 20. This service was conducted in the prison whirlpool.

Following Dahmer&#x27;s baptism, Ratcliff visited him every week. The two regularly discussed the prospect of death, and Ratcliff later divulged that, in the months prior to his murder, Dahmer had questioned whether he was sinning against God by continuing to live. Referring to his crimes in a 1994 interview with Stone Phillips on &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;, Dahmer had stated: &quot;If a person doesn&#x27;t think that there is a God to be accountable to, then what&#x27;s the point of trying to modify your behavior to keep it within acceptable ranges? That&#x27;s how I thought anyway.&quot;

On July 3, 1994, a fellow inmate, Osvaldo Durruthy, attempted to slash Dahmer&#x27;s throat with a razor embedded in a toothbrush as Dahmer sat in the prison chapel after the weekly church service was concluded. Dahmer received superficial wounds and was not seriously hurt in this incident. According to Dahmer&#x27;s family, he had long been ready to die, and accepted any punishment which he might endure in prison. In addition to his father and stepmother maintaining regular contact, Dahmer&#x27;s mother, Joyce, also maintained regular contact with her son. Prior to his arrest, the two had not seen each other since Christmas 1983. Joyce related that in her weekly phone calls, whenever she expressed concerns for her son&#x27;s physical well-being, Dahmer responded with comments to the effect of: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter, Mom. I don&#x27;t care if something happens to me.&quot;

===Death===
On the morning of November 28, 1994, Dahmer left his cell to conduct his assigned work detail. Accompanying him were two fellow inmates, Jesse Anderson and Christopher Scarver. The trio were left unsupervised in the showers of the prison gym for approximately 20 minutes. At approximately 8:10 a.m. Dahmer was discovered on the floor of the bathrooms of the gym suffering from extreme head wounds; he had been severely bludgeoned about the head and face with a metal bar. His head had also been repeatedly struck against the wall in the assault. Although Dahmer was still alive and was rushed to a nearby hospital, he was pronounced dead one hour later. Anderson had been beaten with the same instrument; he died from his wounds two days later.

Scarver, who was serving a life sentence for a murder committed in 1990, informed authorities he had first attacked Dahmer with the metal bar as Dahmer was cleaning a staff locker room, before attacking Anderson as Anderson cleaned an inmate locker room. According to Scarver, Dahmer did not yell or make any noise as he was attacked. Immediately after attacking both men, Scarver, who was thought to be schizophrenic, returned to his cell and informed a prison guard: &quot;God told me to do it. Jesse Anderson and Jeffrey Dahmer are dead.&quot; Scarver was adamant he had not planned the attacks in advance, although he later divulged to investigators he had concealed the 20-inch iron bar used to kill both men in his clothing shortly before the killings.

Upon learning of his death, Dahmer&#x27;s mother Joyce responded angrily to the media: &quot;Now is everybody happy? Now that he&#x27;s bludgeoned to death, is that good enough for everyone?&quot; The response of the families of Dahmer&#x27;s victims was mixed: some celebrated the news, while others were saddened. Catherine Lacy, the mother of victim Oliver Lacy, remarked: &quot;The hurt is worse now, because he&#x27;s not suffering like we are.&quot; The district attorney who prosecuted Dahmer cautioned against turning Scarver into a folk hero, saying that Dahmer&#x27;s death was still murder. On May 15, 1995, Scarver was sentenced to two additional terms of life imprisonment for the murders of Dahmer and Anderson.

Dahmer had stated in his will that he wished for no services to be conducted and that he wished to be cremated. In September 1995, Dahmer&#x27;s body was cremated, and his ashes divided between his parents. Owing to a disagreement between his parents as to whether Dahmer&#x27;s brain should be retained for medical research, this organ was initially retained, but later cremated in December 1995.

===Aftermath===
On August 5, 1991, as the nature and scale of Dahmer&#x27;s crimes initially came to light, a candlelight vigil to celebrate and heal the Milwaukee community was attended by more than 400 people. Present at the vigil were community leaders, gay rights activists, and family members of several of Dahmer&#x27;s victims. Organizers stated the purpose of the vigil was to enable Milwaukeeans to &quot;share their feelings of pain and anger over what happened&quot;.

Dahmer&#x27;s murders were committed at a time of heightened racial tension in Milwaukee. A professor of community studies at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, Walter Farrell, later stated race relations in the city had been &quot;in a state of disrepair for nearly a decade&quot; at the time of Dahmer&#x27;s arrest. In an August 1991 interview given to the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;, Farrell stated that news of the murders, as well as the conduct of Milwaukee police officers John Balcerzak and Joseph Gabrish with regards to victim Konerak Sinthasomphone, exacerbated and highlighted racial tensions within the city.

Milwaukee&#x27;s gay scene was generally underground and transient in nature at the time of Dahmer&#x27;s murders, with many sexually active gay men using aliases. Many in the city&#x27;s gay community were nervous of the intentions of others after the extent of Dahmer&#x27;s murders became known, although the fear and distrust generated by Dahmer&#x27;s crimes was short-lived. As the 1990s progressed, the usage of aliases became less common among members of Milwaukee&#x27;s gay community.

The Oxford Apartments at 924 North 25th Street, where Dahmer had killed twelve of his victims, were demolished in November 1992. The site is now a vacant lot. Alternate plans to convert the site into either a memorial garden, a playground, or to reconstruct new housing have failed to materialize.

Dahmer&#x27;s estate was awarded to the families of eleven of his victims who had sued for damages. In 1996, Thomas Jacobson, a lawyer representing eight of the families, announced a planned auction of Dahmer&#x27;s estate. Although victims&#x27; relatives stated the motivation was not greed, the announcement sparked controversy. A civic group, Milwaukee Civic Pride, was quickly established in an effort to raise the funds to purchase and destroy many of Dahmer&#x27;s possessions. The group pledged $407,225, including a $100,000 gift by Milwaukee real estate developer Joseph Zilber, for purchase of Dahmer&#x27;s estate; five of the eight families represented by Jacobson agreed to the terms, and Dahmer&#x27;s possessions were subsequently destroyed and buried in an undisclosed Illinois landfill.

In 1994, Lionel published a book, &quot;A Father&#x27;s Story&quot;, and donated a portion of the proceeds from his book to the victims&#x27; families. Most of the families showed support for Lionel and Shari, although three families subsequently sued Lionel: two for using their names in the book without obtaining prior consent, and a third family—that of Steven Hicks—filing a wrongful death suit against Lionel, Shari, and former wife Joyce, citing parental negligence as the cause for the claim.

Lionel Dahmer lived with his second wife, Shari, until her death in January 2023. He died of natural causes on December 5, 2023. Both refused to change their surname and professed their love of Dahmer in spite of his crimes.

Joyce Flint died of cancer on November 27, 2000. Prior to her death, she had attempted suicide on at least one occasion. Dahmer&#x27;s younger brother, David, changed his surname and lives in anonymity.

==Victims==
Jeffrey Dahmer killed seventeen young men between 1978 and 1991. Twelve were killed in his North 25th Street apartment. Three victims were murdered and dismembered at his grandmother&#x27;s West Allis residence. His first and second victims were murdered at his parents&#x27; home in Ohio and at the Ambassador Hotel in Milwaukee, respectively. A total of fourteen of Dahmer&#x27;s victims were from various ethnic minority backgrounds, with nine victims being black. Dahmer was adamant that the race of his victims was incidental to him and that it was the body form of a potential victim that attracted his attention. These contentions have been supported via an independent forensic specialists&#x27; study of Dahmer&#x27;s victim selection, the anthropological analysis of which revealed his victims shared a &quot;morphological similarity&quot; and suggesting Dahmer was &quot;psychologically attracted to a certain anthropometric body type&quot;.

Most of Dahmer&#x27;s victims were killed by strangulation after being drugged with sedatives. His first victim was killed by a combination of bludgeoning and strangulation and his second victim was battered to death, with one further victim killed in 1990, Ernest Miller, dying of a combination of shock and blood loss due to his carotid artery being cut. Four of Dahmer&#x27;s victims killed in 1991 had holes bored into their skulls through which Dahmer injected hydrochloric acid or, later, boiling water, into their frontal lobes in an attempt to induce a permanent, submissive, unresistant state. This proved fatal, although on each occasion this was not Dahmer&#x27;s intention.

===1978===
* June 18: Steven Mark Hicks, 18. Last seen hitchhiking to a rock concert in Chippewa Lake Park in Bath, Ohio. By Dahmer&#x27;s admission, Hicks caught his attention because he was bare-chested. Dahmer bludgeoned him with a dumbbell and strangled him to death with this instrument before he dismembered the corpse. He then pulverized Hicks&#x27; bones with a hammer and scattered them in woodland behind the Dahmer family home.

===1987===

* November 20: Steven Walter Tuomi, 25. Killed in a rented room at the Ambassador Hotel in Milwaukee. Dahmer claimed to have no memory of murdering Tuomi, yet stated he must have battered him to death in a drunken stupor. His body was dismembered in the basement of Dahmer&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s house and the remains discarded in the trash. No remains were ever found.

===1988===
* January 16: James Edward Doxtator, 14. Dahmer met him outside a gay bar in Wisconsin and lured him to West Allis on the pretext of paying him $50 to pose for nude pictures. Dahmer strangled Doxtator and kept his body in the basement for a week before dismembering him and discarding the remains in the trash.
* March 24: Richard Guerrero, 22. Drugged and strangled in Dahmer&#x27;s bedroom at West Allis. Dahmer dismembered Guerrero&#x27;s corpse in the basement, dissolved the flesh in acid and disposed of the bones in the trash. He bleached and retained the skull for several months before disposing of it. No remains were ever found.

===1989===
* March 25: Anthony Lee Sears, 24. Sears was the last victim whom Dahmer drugged and strangled at his grandmother&#x27;s residence; he was also the first victim from whom Dahmer permanently retained any body parts. His preserved skull and genitals were found in a filing cabinet at 924 North 25th Street following Dahmer&#x27;s arrest in 1991.

===1990===
* May 20: Raymond Lamont Smith (also known as Ricky Beeks), 32. The first victim to be killed at Dahmer&#x27;s North 25th Street apartment. Smith was a male sex worker whom Dahmer encountered at a tavern. Dahmer gave Smith a drink laced with sleeping pills, then strangled him on his kitchen floor. His skull was spray-painted and retained.
* June 14: Edward Warren Smith, 27. A known acquaintance of Dahmer who was last seen in his company at a party. Dahmer acidified Smith&#x27;s skeleton; his skull was destroyed unintentionally when placed in the oven in an effort to remove moisture. No remains were ever found.
* September 2: Ernest Marquez Miller, 22. Miller was a dance student whom Dahmer encountered outside a bookstore. According to Dahmer, he was especially attracted to Miller&#x27;s physique. He was killed by having his carotid artery severed before being dismembered in the bathtub, with Dahmer storing his entire skeleton in the bottom drawer of a filing cabinet and his heart, liver, biceps, and portions of his thighs in the freezer for later consumption.
* September 24: David Courtney Thomas, 22. Encountered Dahmer near the Grand Avenue Mall; he was lured to Dahmer&#x27;s apartment on the promise of money for posing nude. Once a laced drink had rendered Thomas unconscious, Dahmer decided he &quot;wasn&#x27;t my type&quot;. Nonetheless, Dahmer strangled Thomas, taking Polaroid photos of the dismemberment process. No remains were ever found.

===1991===
* February 18: Curtis Durrell Straughter, 17. Approached by Dahmer as he waited at a bus stop near Marquette University. Dahmer lured Straughter to his apartment, where he drugged, handcuffed and strangled him before dismembering his body in the bathtub. He retained Straughter&#x27;s skull, hands, and genitals.
* April 7: Errol Lindsey, 19. The first victim upon whom Dahmer practiced what he later described to investigators as his &quot;drilling technique&quot;, a procedure in which he drilled holes into the victim&#x27;s skull, through which he injected hydrochloric acid into the brain. According to Dahmer, Lindsey awoke after this practice, after which he was again rendered unconscious with a drink laced with sedatives, then strangled to death. Dahmer flayed Lindsey&#x27;s body and retained the skin for several weeks. His skull was found following Dahmer&#x27;s arrest.

*May 24: Tony Anthony Hughes, 31. Hughes was lured by Dahmer to his apartment upon the promise of posing nude for photographs. As Hughes was deaf, he and Dahmer communicated using handwritten notes. The injection of hydrochloric acid into Hughes&#x27;s skull proved fatal. His body was left on Dahmer&#x27;s bedroom floor for three days before being dismembered, with Dahmer photographing the dismemberment process. His skull was retained and identified from dental records.
* May 27: Konerak Sinthasomphone, 14. The younger brother of the boy Dahmer had molested in 1988. Dahmer drugged Sinthasomphone and injected hydrochloric acid into his brain before leaving him unattended as he left the apartment to purchase beer. When he returned, he discovered Sinthasomphone naked and disoriented in the street, with three distressed young women attempting to assist him. When police arrived, Dahmer persuaded them he and Sinthasomphone were lovers and that Sinthasomphone was simply intoxicated. When police left Sinthasomphone with Dahmer in his apartment, Dahmer again injected hydrochloric acid into Sinthasomphone&#x27;s brain, and this proved fatal. He kept Sinthasomphone&#x27;s head in the freezer and dismembered his body.
* June 30: Matt Cleveland Turner, 20. On June 30, Dahmer attended the Chicago Pride Parade. At a bus stop, he encountered a 20-year-old named Matt Turner and persuaded him to accompany him to Milwaukee to pose for a photo shoot. Turner was drugged, strangled, and then dismembered in the bathtub. His head and internal organs were put in the freezer and his torso subsequently placed in the 57-gallon drum Dahmer purchased on July 12.
* July 5: Jeremiah Benjamin Weinberger, 23. Dahmer met him at a gay bar in Chicago and persuaded him to accompany him to Milwaukee for the weekend. Dahmer drilled through Weinberger&#x27;s skull and injected boiling water into the cavity. He later recalled Weinberger&#x27;s death to be exceptional, as he was the only victim who died with his eyes open. He kept Weinberger&#x27;s decapitated body in the bathtub for a week before dismembered; his torso was placed in the 57-gallon drum.
* July 15: Oliver Joseph Lacy, 24. A bodybuilding enthusiast whom Dahmer enticed to his apartment with the promise of money for posing for photographs. Lacy was drugged and strangled with a leather strap before being decapitated, with his head and heart being placed in the refrigerator. His skeleton was retained to adorn one side of the private shrine of skulls and skeletons Dahmer was in the process of creating when arrested one week later.
* July 19: Joseph Arthur Bradehoft, 25. Dahmer&#x27;s last victim. Bradehoft was a father of three children from Minnesota who was looking for work in Milwaukee at the time of his murder. Dahmer left Bradehoft&#x27;s body on his bed for two days before, on July 21, decapitating it. Dahmer placed Bradehoft&#x27;s head in the refrigerator, and his torso in the 57-gallon drum.

<text>Joseph Cheshire Cotten Jr. (May 15, 1905 – February 6, 1994) was an American film, stage, radio and television actor. Cotten achieved prominence on Broadway, starring in the original stage productions of &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1939) and &quot;Sabrina Fair&quot; (1953). He then gained worldwide fame for his collaborations with Orson Welles on &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941), &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; (1942), and &quot;Journey into Fear&quot; (1943), in which Cotten starred and for which he was also credited with the screenplay.

Cotten went on to become one of the leading Hollywood actors of the 1940s, appearing in films such as &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; (1943); &quot;Gaslight&quot; (1944); &quot;Love Letters&quot; (1945); &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946); &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1947); &quot;Portrait of Jennie&quot; (1948), for which he won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor; &quot;The Third Man&quot; (1949), alongside Welles; and &quot;Niagara&quot; (1953). One of his final films was Michael Cimino&#x27;s &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; (1980).

Multiple film critics and media outlets have cited him as one of the best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination.

==Early life==

Joseph Cheshire Cotten Jr. was born on May 15, 1905, in Petersburg, Virginia, United States, the first of three sons born to Joseph Cheshire Cotten Sr., an assistant postmaster, and Sally Willson Cotten. He had two brothers, Whitworth W. &quot;Whit&quot; and Samuel W. Cotten. Both were engineers. Cotten grew up in the Tidewater region and showed an aptitude for drama and a gift for storytelling.

In 1923, when Cotten was 18, his family arranged for him to receive private lessons at the Hickman School of Expression in Washington, D.C., and underwrote his expenses. Cotten served in the First Motion Picture Unit of the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II.

Cotten earned spending money playing professional football on Sundays, for $25 a quarter. After graduation, he earned enough money as a lifeguard at Wilcox Lake to pay back his family&#x27;s loan, with interest. He moved to Miami in 1925 and worked as an advertising salesman for &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; at $35 a week. He started performing at the Miami Civic Theatre, and worked there for five years, also reviewing the shows for the &quot;Herald&quot;.

== Career ==
=== 1932–1939: Broadway and film debuts ===
Cotten moved to New York and went to work for David Belasco as an assistant stage manager. He understudied Melvyn Douglas in &quot;Tonight or Never&quot; then took over Douglas&#x27; role for the Copley Theatre in Boston, where he worked on over 30 plays. Cotten struggled to find work in the depression so turned to modeling under the Walter Thornton Model Agency and acting in industrial films. He also performed on radio. Cotten made his Broadway debut in 1932 in &quot;Absent Friends&quot; which ran for 88 performances. He followed it with &quot;Jezebel&quot; (1933), staged by Katherine Cornell and Guthrie McClintic, which only had a short run. He was in &quot;Loose Moments&quot; which ran for 8 performances.

In 1934, Cotten met and became friends with Orson Welles, a fellow cast member on CBS Radio&#x27;s &quot;The American School of the Air&quot;. Welles regarded Cotten as a brilliant comic actor, and gave him the starring role in his Federal Theatre Project farce, &quot; Horse Eats Hat&quot; (September 26 – December 5, 1936). Cotten was sure that &quot;Horse Eats Hat&quot; won him the notice of his future Broadway co-star, Katharine Hepburn. Cotten said Welles later told him &quot;You&#x27;re very lucky to be tall and thin and have curly hair. You can also move about the stage without running into the furniture. But these are fringe assets, and I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;ll never make it as an actor. But as a star, I think you well might hit the jackpot.&quot;

In 1937, Cotten became an inaugural member of Welles&#x27;s Mercury Theatre company, starring in its Broadway productions &quot;Caesar&quot; as Publius; it ran for 157 performances. He followed it with &quot;The Shoemaker&#x27;s Holiday&quot; (1938) and &quot;Danton&#x27;s Death&quot; (1938) for Welles. Cotten also performed in radio dramas presented on &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot; and &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot;. That same year Cotten made his film debut in the Welles-directed short, &quot;Too Much Johnson&quot; (1938), a comedy that was intended to complement the aborted 1938 Mercury stage production of William Gillette&#x27;s 1894 play. The film was never screened in public and was lost until 2008 (and then screened in 2013 at the Pordenone Silent Film Festival).

Cotten returned to Broadway in 1939, creating the role of C. K. Dexter Haven opposite Katharine Hepburn&#x27;s Tracy Lord in the original production of Philip Barry&#x27;s &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;. The play ran for 417 performances at the Shubert Theatre, and in the months before its extensive national tour a film version was to be made by MGM. Cotten went to Hollywood, but discovered there that his stage success in &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; translated to, in the words of his agent Leland Hayward, &quot;spending a solid year creating the Cary Grant role.&quot; Hayward suggested that they call Cotten&#x27;s good pal, Orson Welles. &quot;He&#x27;s been making big waves out here&quot;, Hayward said. &quot;Maybe nobody in Hollywood ever heard of the Shubert Theatre in New York, but everybody certainly knows about the Mercury Theatre in New York.&quot;

=== 1940–1949: Leading film roles ===
==== &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941) ====
After the success of Welles&#x27;s &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; 1938 Halloween radio broadcast, Welles gained a unique contract with RKO Pictures. The two-picture deal promised full creative control for the young director below an agreed budget limit, and Welles&#x27;s intention was to feature the Mercury Players in his productions. Shooting had still not begun on a Welles film after a year, but after a meeting with writer Herman J. Mankiewicz Welles had a suitable project.

In mid-1940, filming began on &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, portraying the life of a press magnate (played by Welles) who starts out as an idealist but eventually turns into a corrupt, lonely old man. The film featured Cotten prominently in the role of Kane&#x27;s best friend Jedediah Leland, eventually a drama critic for one of Kane&#x27;s papers.

When released on May 1, 1941, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; – based in part on the life of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst– did not do much business at theaters; Hearst owned numerous major newspapers, and forbade them to carry advertisements for the film. Nominated for nine Academy Awards in 1942, the film won only for Best Screenplay, for Mankiewicz and Welles. &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; launched the film careers of the Mercury Players, including Agnes Moorehead (who played Kane&#x27;s mother), Ruth Warrick (Kane&#x27;s first wife), and Ray Collins (Kane&#x27;s political opponent). However, Cotten was the only one of the four to find major success as a lead in Hollywood outside of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;; Moorehead and Collins became successful character film actors. Moorehead starred in Bewitched and Warrick spent decades in a career in daytime television, specifically All My Children.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, in an otherwise mixed review of the film, said that &quot;Cotten&#x27;s work is vital and distinctive ... He is an important &#x27;find.&#x27;&quot; Alexander Korda hired him to play Merle Oberon&#x27;s leading man in &quot;Lydia&quot; (1941). &quot;I didn&#x27;t care about the movies, really&quot;, Cotten said later. &quot;I was tall. I had curly hair. I could talk. It was easy to do.&quot;

==== &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; (1942) ====
Cotten starred in Welles&#x27;s adaptation and production of &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; (1942). After the commercial disappointment of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, RKO was apprehensive about the new film, and after poor preview responses, cut it by nearly an hour before its release. Though at points the film appeared disjointed, it was well received by critics. Despite the critical accolades Cotten received for his performance, he was again snubbed by the academy.

==== &quot;Journey into Fear&quot; (1943) ====
Cotten was cast in the World War II spy thriller &quot;Journey into Fear&quot; (1943) based on the novel by Eric Ambler. It was originally scripted by Ben Hecht but Welles, who was supervising, disliked it, and rewrote it with Cotten. Released by RKO, the Mercury production was directed by Norman Foster. It was a collaborative effort due to the difficulties shooting the film and the pressures related to Welles&#x27; imminent departure to South America to begin work on &quot;It&#x27;s All True&quot;.

Alfred Hitchcock cast Cotten as a charming serial killer in &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; (1943). It was made for Universal Pictures, for whom Cotten then appeared in &quot;Hers to Hold&quot; (1943), as Deanna Durbin&#x27;s leading man.

After Welles&#x27;s return, he and Cotten co-produced &quot;The Mercury Wonder Show&quot; for members of the U.S. armed services. Opening August 3, 1943, the all-star magic and variety show was presented in a tent at 9000 Cahuenga Boulevard in Hollywood. Featured were Welles (Orson the Magnificent), Cotten (Jo-Jo the Great), Rita Hayworth (forced to quit by Columbia Pictures boss Harry Cohn and replaced by Marlene Dietrich), Agnes Moorehead (Calliope Aggie) and others. Tickets were free to servicemen, and more than 48,000 of them had seen show by September 1943.

In late 1943, Cotten visited Welles&#x27;s office and said that producer David O. Selznick wanted to make two or three films with him, but that he wanted him under his own contract. Welles then tore up Cotten&#x27;s contract with Mercury Productions, saying, &quot;He can do more for you than I can. Good luck!&quot; Cotten signed a long-term deal with Selznick. Selznick loaned out Cotten and Ingrid Bergman to MGM for the thriller &quot;Gaslight&quot; (1944), which was a major hit. Selznick then put Cotten in the wartime drama &quot;Since You Went Away&quot; (1944) alongside Claudette Colbert, Jennifer Jones and Shirley Temple, which was another major success.

Selznick followed this up by teaming Cotten with Ginger Rogers and Temple in &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Seeing You&quot; (1945), another melodrama. Hal Wallis borrowed Cotten and Jones to make &quot;Love Letters&quot; (1945). Exhibitors voted him the 17th most popular star in the United States in 1945. Selznick used Cotten, Jennifer Jones and Gregory Peck in &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946), an epic Western that was hugely popular at the box office.

Dore Schary, who had worked for Selznick, went to run RKO and hired Cotten for &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1947), where he was Loretta Young&#x27;s leading man. Cotten then made &quot;Portrait of Jennie&quot; (1948) for Selznick, co starring with Jones; Cotten played a melancholy artist who becomes obsessed with a girl who might have died many years before. His performance won Cotten the International Prize for Best Actor at the 1949 Venice International Film Festival.

==== &quot;The Third Man&quot; (1949) ====
Cotten was reunited with Welles in Carol Reed&#x27;s &quot;The Third Man&quot; (1949), produced by Korda and Selznick. Cotten portrays a writer of pulp fiction who travels to postwar Vienna to meet his friend Harry Lime (Welles). When he arrives, he is told that Lime has died. Determined to prove to the police that his friend was murdered, he uncovers an even darker secret. Years later, Cotten would recall that &quot;Orson Welles lists &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; as his best film, Alfred Hitchcock opts for &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot;, and Sir Carol Reed chose &quot;The Third Man&quot; – and I&#x27;m in all of them.&quot;

Cotten then reunited with Hitchcock and Ingrid Bergman in &quot;Under Capricorn&quot; (1949) as an Australian landowner with a shady past; it was a box office disappointment. So too was &quot;Beyond the Forest&quot; (1949) with Bette Davis at Warner Bros.

=== 1950–1969: Established actor ===
Cotten co-starred with Joan Fontaine in &quot;September Affair&quot; (1950) for Hal Wallis. Selznick loaned him to 20th Century Fox for the dark Civil War Western &quot;Two Flags West&quot; (1950), then to RKO for &quot;Walk Softly, Stranger&quot; (1950, shot in 1948) which reunited him with Alida Valli from &quot;The Third Man&quot;. It was a flop. At Fox he did &quot;Half Angel&quot; (1951) with Young, then did another with Wallis at Paramount, &quot;Peking Express&quot; (1951) and went to MGM for &quot;The Man with a Cloak&quot; (1951) with Barbara Stanwyck. He had a cameo in Welles&#x27; &quot;Othello&quot; (1951).

Cotten did a Western at Universal, &quot;Untamed Frontier&quot; (1953), during the filming of which he was injured. He did a thriller for Andrew L. Stone, &quot;The Steel Trap&quot; (1952), which reunited him with Teresa Wright from &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot;. At Fox he was in the Marilyn Monroe vehicle &quot;Niagara&quot; (1953), after James Mason turned down the role. He narrated &quot;Egypt by Three&quot; (1953) and was reunited with Stone in &quot;A Blueprint for Murder&quot; (1953).

On the stage in 1953, Cotten created the role of Linus Larrabee Jr. in the original Broadway production of &quot;Sabrina Fair&quot;, opposite Margaret Sullavan. The production ran from November 11, 1953, until August 21, 1954, and was the basis of the Billy Wilder film &quot;Sabrina&quot;, which starred Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn. He and Sullavan appeared in a TV production of &quot;State of the Union&quot; for &quot;Producers&#x27; Showcase,&quot; directed by Arthur Penn.

Cotten made &quot;Special Delivery&quot; (1955) in West Germany and appeared in a TV adaptation of &quot;Broadway&quot; for &quot;The Best of Broadway&quot; (1955), directed by Franklin J. Schaffner. He appeared in episodes of several TV anthology series, a popular format of the era, including &quot;Celebrity Playhouse&quot;, &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot;, &quot;Star Stage&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; (three episodes) and &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;.

In 1955, Cotten hosted &quot;The 20th Century Fox Hour&quot; on television. In 1956, he introduced and occasionally starred in his own anthology NBC series, &quot;On Trial&quot;. Because it was popularly known as &quot;The Joseph Cotten Show&quot;, it was retitled mid-run to &quot;The Joseph Cotten Show: On Trial&quot;. It ran for 41 episodes through 1959, with Cotten appearing in at least 20.

He returned to features with &quot;The Bottom of the Bottle&quot; (1956), &quot;The Killer Is Loose&quot; (1957) and &quot;The Halliday Brand&quot; (1957). He guest-starred on &quot;Jane Wyman Presents The Fireside Theatre&quot;, &quot;Telephone Time&quot;, &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Zane Grey Theater&quot;, &quot;Suspicion&quot; and &quot;Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse&quot;. He made a cameo appearance in Welles&#x27;s &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; (1958) and a starring role in the film adaptation of Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; (1958). Cotten had another success on Broadway when he appeared in &quot;Once More, With Feeling&quot; (1958–60), which ran for 263 performances. For the third time, Cotten was in a Broadway hit but did not reprise his role in the film version; Yul Brynner played the part on screen.

Cotten had a supporting role in the films &quot;The Angel Wore Red&quot; (1960) and &quot;The Last Sunset&quot; (1961), and guest-starred on &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot;, &quot;Checkmate&quot;, &quot;The Barbara Stanwyck Show&quot;, &quot;Bus Stop&quot;, &quot;Theatre &#x27;62&quot; (an adaptation of Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Notorious&quot;), &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot; and &quot;Saints and Sinners&quot;.

Cotten returned to Broadway to appear in &quot;Calculated Risk&quot; (1962–63), which ran for 221 performances and meant he had to turn down a role in a film &quot;Harrigan&#x27;s Halo&quot;. He guest starred on &quot;The Great Adventure&quot; and &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; and appeared in the pilot for &quot;Alexander the Great&quot; (1963).

After some time away from film, Cotten returned in the horror classic &quot;Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte&quot; (1964) for Aldrich, with Bette Davis, Olivia de Havilland and Agnes Moorehead. Cotten was top billed in &quot;The Great Sioux Massacre&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Tramplers&quot; (1965), &quot;Brighty of the Grand Canyon&quot; (1966), &quot;The Cruel Ones&quot; (1967), &quot;Some May Live&quot; (1967) and &quot;Gangsters &#x27;70&quot; (1968). He took supporting roles in &quot;The Money Trap&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Oscar&quot; (1966).

He guest starred on &quot;Cimarron Strip&quot;, &quot;Ironside&quot; and &quot;Journey to the Unknown&quot; and had a support role in &quot;Jack of Diamonds&quot; (1967). He had the lead in &quot;White Comanche&quot; (1968) and &quot;Latitude Zero&quot; (1969) (shot in Japan with his wife) and supported in the TV movies &quot;The Lonely Profession&quot; (1969) and &quot;Cutter&#x27;s Trail&quot; (1970). He also appeared as himself on the &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; (1968) variety show.

=== 1970–1981: Later and final roles ===
Cotten appeared in &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;, &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot;, &quot;NET Playhouse&quot;, &quot;The Grasshopper&quot; (1970), &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;, &quot;The Virginian&quot;, &quot;Assault on the Wayne&quot; (1971), &quot;Do You Take This Stranger?&quot; (1971), &quot;City Beneath the Sea&quot; (1971), &quot;The Abominable Dr. Phibes&quot; (1971), &quot;Lady Frankenstein&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Screaming Woman&quot; (1972) with de Havilland.

He had lead roles in &quot;Doomsday Voyage&quot; (1972), &quot;Baron Blood&quot; (1972), and &quot;The Scopone Game&quot; (1973) and was in &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1973), &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Soylent Green&quot; (1973), &quot;A Delicate Balance&quot; (1973), &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, &quot;Syndicate Sadists&quot; (1975), &quot;The Timber Tramps&quot; (1975), &quot;The Lindbergh Kidnapping Case&quot; (1976), &quot;A Whisper in the Dark&quot; (1976), &quot;Origins of the Mafia&quot; (1976), &quot;Twilight&#x27;s Last Gleaming&quot; (1977) for Aldrich, &quot;Airport &#x27;77&quot;, &quot;Aspen&quot; (1977), &quot;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Last In, First Out&quot; (1978), &quot;Caravans&quot; (1978), &quot;The Perfect Crime&quot; (1978), &quot;Island of the Fishmen&quot; (1979), &quot;Concorde Affaire &#x27;79&quot; (1979), &quot;&quot; (1979), &quot;Churchill and the Generals&quot; (1979), &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; and &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Cotten&#x27;s first wife Lenore Kipp died of leukemia in early 1960. He adopted Kipp&#x27;s daughter, Judith Lenore LaMonte, from her previous marriage who later went on to marry James Pande Young, a television director. He married British actress Patricia Medina on October 20, 1960, in Beverly Hills at the home of David O. Selznick and Jennifer Jones. He bought a historic 1935 home in the Mesa neighborhood of Palm Springs, California, where he and his wife lived from 1985 to 1992. The marriage produced no children.

In 1961 Cotten was admitted to the Society of the Cincinnati in North Carolina based on his descent from Captain Hudson Whitaker, Seventh Regiment, North Carolina Continental Line. He held Captain Whitaker&#x27;s hereditary seat until his death in 1994.

===Illness and death===
On June 8, 1981, Cotten experienced a heart attack followed by a stroke that affected his brain&#x27;s speech center. He began years of therapy that eventually restored his ability to speak. As he began to recover, he and Orson Welles talked on the phone each week for several hours. Cotten wrote, &quot;He was strong and supportive, and whenever I used the wrong word (which was frequently) he would say, &#x27;That&#x27;s a much better word, Joe, I&#x27;m going to use it.&#x27;&quot; He and Welles would meet for lunch and reminisce. When Cotten announced he had written a book, Welles asked for the manuscript and read it that night.

In 1990, Cotten&#x27;s larynx was removed because of cancer. He died on February 6, 1994, of pneumonia at the age of 88. He was buried at Blandford Cemetery in Petersburg, Virginia.

== Acting credits ==
==Accolades and legacy ==
At the 10th Venice International Film Festival, Cotten was awarded the Volpi Cup for Best Actor for his performance in the film &quot;Portrait of Jennie&quot; (1948). He was also given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.

Cotten was portrayed by Tim Robbins in the 1985 TV film &quot;Malice in Wonderland&quot;, by James Tupper in the film &quot;Me and Orson Welles&quot; (2008) and by Matthew Glave in the television series &quot;Feud&quot; (2017), which depicts the filming of &quot;Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte&quot;.

<doc id="16224" wikidata="Q2468262" url="?curid=16224" title="Jonah">
<text>Jonah the son of Amittai or Jonas ( , ) is a Jewish prophet in the Hebrew Bible hailing from Gath-hepher in the Northern Kingdom of Israel around the 8th century BCE. He is the central figure of the Book of Jonah, one of the minor prophets, which details his reluctance in delivering the judgment of God to the city of Nineveh (near present-day Mosul) in the Neo-Assyrian Empire. After he is swallowed by a large sea creature () and then released, he returns to the divine mission.

In Judaism, the story of Jonah represents the teaching of repentance in Judaism, the ability to repent to God for forgiveness. In the New Testament of Christianity, Jesus calls himself &quot;greater than Jonah&quot; and promises the Pharisees &quot;the sign of Jonah&quot; when referring to his resurrection. Early Christian interpreters viewed Jonah as a &quot;type&quot; of Jesus. Jonah in Islam is regarded as a prophet and the narrative of Jonah appears in a surah of the Quran named after him, Yūnus.

Many modern Bible scholars suggest the Book of Jonah is fictional, and at least partially satirical. Most scholars consider the Book of Jonah to have been composed long after the events it describes due to its use of words and motifs exclusive to postexilic Aramaic sources. The character of Jonah son of Amittai may have been based on the historical prophet of the same name who prophesied during the reign of King Amaziah of Judah, as mentioned in 2 Kings.

Although the creature that swallowed Jonah is often depicted in art and culture as a whale, the Hebrew text uses the phrase &quot;large fish&quot;. In the 17th century and early 18th century, the species of the fish that swallowed Jonah was the subject of speculation by naturalists, who interpreted the story as an account of a historical incident. Some modern scholars of folklore, on the other hand, note similarities between Jonah and other legendary religious figures, like the Indian yogi Matsyendranatha &quot;Lord of the Fishes&quot;, the Sumerian king Gilgamesh, and the Greek hero Jason.

==Book of Jonah==

Jonah is the central character in the Book of Jonah, in which God commands him to go to the city of Nineveh to prophesy against it &quot;for their great wickedness is come up before me,&quot; but Jonah instead attempts to flee from &quot;the presence of the Lord&quot; by going to Jaffa (sometimes transliterated as &quot;Joppa&quot; or &quot;Joppe&quot;). He sets sail for Tarshish. A huge storm arises and the sailors, realizing that it is no ordinary storm, cast lots and discover that Jonah is to blame. Jonah admits this and says that if he is thrown overboard, the storm will cease. The sailors refuse to do this and continue rowing, but all their efforts fail, and they eventually throw Jonah overboard. As a result, the storm calms and the sailors offer sacrifices to God.

After being cast from the ship, Jonah is swallowed by a large fish, within the belly of which he remains for three days and three nights. While in the great fish, Jonah prays to God in his affliction and commits to giving thanks and to paying what he has vowed. God commands the fish to vomit Jonah out.

God again commands Jonah to travel to Nineveh and prophesy to its inhabitants. This time he travels there and enters the city, crying, &quot;In forty days Nineveh shall be overthrown.&quot; After Jonah has walked across Nineveh, the people begin to believe his word and proclaim a fast. The king of Nineveh puts on sackcloth and sits in ashes, making a proclamation which decrees fasting, the wearing of sackcloth, prayer and repentance. God sees their repentant hearts and spares the city at that time. The entire city is humbled and broken, with the people (and even the livestock) wearing sackcloth and ashes.

Displeased by this, Jonah refers to his earlier flight to Tarshish while asserting that, since God is merciful, it was inevitable that God would turn from the threatened calamities. He leaves the city and makes a shelter, waiting to see whether or not the city will be destroyed. God causes a plant (in Hebrew a &quot;kikayon&quot;) to grow over Jonah&#x27;s shelter to give him some shade from the sun. Later, God causes a worm to bite the plant&#x27;s root and it withers. Jonah, exposed to the full force of the sun, becomes faint and pleads for God to kill him.

==Religious views==
===In Judaism===
The Book of Jonah (Yonah יונה) is one of the twelve minor prophets included in the Hebrew Bible. According to one tradition, Jonah was the boy brought back to life by Elijah the prophet in 1 Kings. Another tradition holds that he was the son of the woman of Shunem brought back to life by Elisha in 2 Kings and that he is called the &quot;son of Amittai&quot; (&quot;Truth&quot;) due to his mother&#x27;s recognition of Elijah&#x27;s identity as a prophet in 1 Kings. The Book of Jonah is read every year, in its original Hebrew and in its entirety, on Yom Kippur – the Day of Atonement – as the Haftarah at the afternoon mincha prayer. According to Rabbi Eliezer, the fish that swallowed Jonah was created in the primordial era and the inside of its mouth was like a synagogue; the fish&#x27;s eyes were like windows and a pearl inside its mouth provided further illumination.

According to the Midrash, while Jonah was inside the fish, the fish told him that its life was nearly over because soon the Leviathan would eat them both. Jonah promised the fish that he would save them. Following Jonah&#x27;s directions, the fish swam up alongside the Leviathan and Jonah threatened to leash the Leviathan by its tongue and let the other fish eat it. The Leviathan heard Jonah&#x27;s threats, saw that he was circumcised, and realized that he was protected by the Lord, so it fled in terror, leaving Jonah and the fish alive. 

The medieval Jewish scholar and rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra (1092–1167) argued against any literal interpretation of the Book of Jonah, stating that the &quot;experiences of all the prophets except Moses were visions, not actualities.&quot; The later scholar Isaac Abarbanel (1437–1509), however, argued that Jonah could have easily survived in the belly of the fish for three days, because &quot;after all, fetuses live nine months without access to fresh air.&quot;

Teshuva – the ability to repent and be forgiven by God – is a prominent idea in Jewish thought. This concept is developed in the Book of Jonah: Jonah, the son of truth (the name of his father &quot;Amitai&quot; in Hebrew means &quot;truth&quot;), refuses to ask the people of Nineveh to repent. He seeks the truth only, and not forgiveness. When forced to go, his call is heard loud and clear, and the people of Nineveh repent ecstatically, &quot;fasting, including the sheep,&quot; and the Jewish text is critical of this. The Book of Jonah also highlights the sometimes unstable relationship between two religious needs: comfort and truth.

Twelfth-century Jewish rabbi and explorer Petachiah of Regensburg visited Jonah&#x27;s tomb during his visit to the Holy Land, and wrote: &quot;There is a beautiful palace built over it. Near it is a pleasure garden wherein all kinds of fruit are found. The keeper of the pleasure garden is a Gentile. Nevertheless, when Gentiles come there he gives them no fruit, but when Jews come he gives them a friendly reception, saying, Jonah, son of Amittai, was a Jew, therefore it is due to you to partake of what is his, and then gives to the Jews to eat thereof.&quot; Petachiah did not provide details about the exact location of the tomb.

In the Book of Tobit

Jonah is mentioned twice in the fourteenth chapter of the deuterocanonical Book of Tobit, the conclusion of which finds Tobit&#x27;s son, Tobias, rejoicing at the news of Nineveh&#x27;s destruction by Nebuchadnezzar and Ahasuerus in apparent fulfillment of Jonah&#x27;s prophecy against the Assyrian capital.

===In Christianity===
====In the New Testament====
In the New Testament, Jonah is mentioned in the gospels of Matthew and Luke. In Matthew, Jesus makes a reference to Jonah when he is asked for a sign by some of the scribes and the Pharisees. Jesus says that the sign will be the sign of Jonah: Jonah&#x27;s restoration after three days and three night inside the great fish prefigures his own resurrection.
In Luke, Jesus makes a reference to Jonah in an eschatological prophecy, after a woman in the crowd suddenly exclaims, &quot;Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked&quot; (Luke 11:27 - King James Version):


Jonah is regarded as a saint by a number of Christian denominations. His feast day in the Roman Catholic Church is on 21 September, according to the &quot;Martyrologium Romanum&quot;. On the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar, Jonah&#x27;s feast day is on 22 September (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian calendar; 22 September currently falls in October on the modern Gregorian calendar). In the Armenian Apostolic Church, moveable feasts are held in commemoration of Jonah as a single prophet and as one of the Twelve Minor Prophets. Jonah&#x27;s mission to the Ninevites is commemorated by the Fast of Nineveh in Syriac and Oriental Orthodox Churches. Jonah is commemorated as a prophet in the Calendar of Saints of the Missouri Synod of the Lutheran Church on 22 September.

Christian theologians have traditionally interpreted Jonah as a type for Jesus Christ. Jonah being in swallowed by the giant fish was regarded as a foreshadowing of Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion and Jonah emerging from the fish after three days was seen as a parallel for Jesus emerging from the tomb after three days. Saint Jerome equates Jonah with Jesus&#x27;s more nationalistic side, and justifies Jonah&#x27;s actions by arguing that &quot;Jonah acts thus as a patriot, not so much that he hates the Ninevites, as that he does not want to destroy his own people.&quot;

====Post-Biblical views====

Other Christian interpreters, including Saint Augustine and Martin Luther, have taken a directly opposite approach, regarding Jonah as the epitome of envy and jealousness, which they regarded as inherent characteristics of the Jewish people. Luther likewise concludes that the &quot;kikayon&quot; (plant) represents Judaism, and that the worm which devours it represents Christ. Luther also questioned the idea that the Book of Jonah was ever intended as literal history, commenting that he found it hard to believe that anyone would have interpreted it as such if it were not in the Bible. Luther&#x27;s antisemitic interpretation of Jonah remained the prevailing interpretation among German Protestants throughout early modern history. J. D. Michaelis comments that &quot;the meaning of the fable hits you right between the eyes&quot;, and concludes that the Book of Jonah is a polemic against &quot;the Israelite people&#x27;s hate and envy towards all the other nations of the earth.&quot; Albert Eichhorn was a strong supporter of Michaelis&#x27;s interpretation.

John Calvin and John Hooper regarded the Book of Jonah as a warning to all those who might attempt to flee from the wrath of God. While Luther had been careful to maintain that the Book of Jonah was not written by Jonah, Calvin declared that the Book of Jonah was Jonah&#x27;s personal confession of guilt. Calvin sees Jonah&#x27;s time inside the fish&#x27;s belly as equivalent to the fires of Hell, intended to correct Jonah and set him on the path of righteousness. Also, unlike Luther, Calvin finds fault with all the characters in the story, describing the sailors on the boat as &quot;hard and iron-hearted, like Cyclops&#x27;&quot;, the penitence of the Ninevites as &quot;untrained&quot;, and the king of Nineveh as a &quot;novice&quot;. Hooper, on the other hand, sees Jonah as the archetypal dissident and the ship he is cast out from as a symbol of the state. Hooper deplores such dissidents, decrying: &quot;Can you live quietly with so many Jonasses? Nay then, throw them into the sea!&quot; In the eighteenth century, German professors were forbidden from teaching that the Book of Jonah was anything other than a literal, historical account.

===In Islam===

====Quran====
Jonah () is the title of the tenth chapter of the Quran. Yūnus is traditionally viewed as highly important in Islam as a prophet who was faithful to God and delivered His messages. Jonah is the only one of Judaism&#x27;s Twelve Minor Prophets to be named in the Quran. In Quran 21:87 and 68:48, Jonah is called Dhul-Nūn (; meaning &quot;The One of the Fish&quot;). In 4:163 and 6:86, he is referred to as &quot;an apostle of Allah&quot;. Surah 37:139–148 retells the full story of Jonah:

The Quran never mentions Jonah&#x27;s father, but Muslim tradition teaches that Jonah was from the tribe of Benjamin and that his father was Amittai.

====Hadiths====
Jonah is also mentioned in a few incidents during the lifetime of Muhammad. Quraysh sent their servant, Addas, to serve him grapes for sustenance. Muhammad asked Addas where he was from and the servant replied Nineveh. &quot;The town of Jonah the just, son of Amittai!&quot; Muhammad exclaimed. Addas was shocked because he knew that the pagan Arabs had no knowledge of the prophet Jonah. He then asked how Muhammad knew of this man. &quot;We are brothers,&quot; Muhammad replied. &quot;Jonah was a Prophet of God and I, too, am a Prophet of God.&quot; Addas immediately accepted Islam and kissed the hands and feet of Muhammad.

One of the sayings attributed to Muhammad, in the collection of Imam Bukhari, says that Muhammad said &quot;One should not say that I am better than Jonah&quot;. Umayya ibn Abi al-Salt, an older contemporary of Muhammad, taught that, had Jonah not prayed to Allah, he would have remained trapped inside the fish until Judgement Day, but, because of his prayer, Jonah &quot;stayed only a few days within the belly of the fish&quot;.

The ninth-century Persian historian Al-Tabari records that, while Jonah was inside the fish, &quot;none of his bones or members were injured&quot;. Al-Tabari also writes that Allah made the body of the fish transparent, allowing Jonah to see the &quot;wonders of the deep&quot; and that Jonah heard all the fish singing praises to Allah. Kisai Marvazi, a tenth-century poet, records that Jonah&#x27;s father was seventy years old when Jonah was born and that he died soon afterwards, leaving Jonah&#x27;s mother with nothing but a wooden spoon, which turned out to be a cornucopia.

====Claimed tombs====
Nineveh&#x27;s current location is marked by excavations of five gates, parts of walls on four sides, and two large mounds: the hill of Kuyunjik and hill of Nabi Yunus. A mosque atop Nabi Yunus was dedicated to the prophet Jonah and contained a shrine, which was revered by both Muslims and Christians as the site of Jonah&#x27;s tomb. The tomb was a popular pilgrimage site and a symbol of unity to Jews, Christians, and Muslims across the Middle East. On July 24, 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) destroyed the mosque containing the tomb as part of a campaign to destroy religious sanctuaries it deemed to be idolatrous. After Mosul was taken back from ISIL in January 2017, an ancient Assyrian palace built by Esarhaddon dating to around the first half of the 7th century BCE was discovered beneath the ruined mosque. ISIL had plundered the palace of items to sell on the black market, but some of the artifacts that were more difficult to transport still remained in place.

Other reputed locations of Jonah&#x27;s tomb include:
* the Arab village of Mashhad, located on the ancient site of Gath-hepher in Israel; 
* the Nabi Yunis mosque of the Palestinian town of Halhul, in the West Bank, north of Hebron, was purportedly built over Jonah&#x27;s tomb; 
* a sanctuary near the city of Sarafand (Sarepta) in Lebanon; 
* a hill now called Giv&#x27;at Yonah, &quot;Jonah&#x27;s Hill&quot;, at the northern edge of the Israeli town of Ashdod, at a site covered by a modern lighthouse;
* a &quot;tomb of Jonah&quot; in the city of Diyarbakir, Turkey, located behind the mihrab at Fatih Pasha Mosque – Evliya Çelebi states in his &quot;Seyahatname&quot; that he visited the tombs of prophet Jonah and prophet George in the city.

==Scholarly interpretations==
The story of a man surviving after being swallowed by a whale or giant fish is classified in the catalogue of folktale types as ATU 1889G.

===Historicity===

Many Biblical scholars hold that the contents of the Book of Jonah are ahistorical. Although the prophet Jonah allegedly lived in the eighth century BCE, the Book of Jonah was written centuries later during the time of the Achaemenid Empire. The Hebrew used in the Book of Jonah shows strong influences from Aramaic and the cultural practices described in it match those of the Achaemenid Persians. Some scholars regard the Book of Jonah as an intentional work of parody or satire. If this is the case, then it was probably admitted into the canon of the Hebrew Bible by sages who misunderstood its satirical nature and mistakenly interpreted it as a serious prophetic work.

Jonah himself may have been a historical prophet; he is briefly mentioned in the Second Book of Kings:
In a lecture delivered in 1978 and published in 1979, Assyriologist Donald Wiseman defended the plausibility of many aspects of the story, supporting &quot;the tradition that many features in the narrative exhibit an intimate and accurate knowledge of Assyria which could stem from an historical event as early as the eighth century B.C.&quot;, concluding that &quot;the story of Jonah need not be considered as a late story or parable&quot;.

===Parodic elements===

The views expressed by Jonah in the Book of Jonah are a parody of views held by members of Jewish society at the time when it was written. The primary target of the satire may have been a faction whom Morton Smith calls &quot;Separationists&quot;, who believed that God would destroy those who disobeyed him, that sinful cities would be obliterated, and that God&#x27;s mercy did not extend to those outside the Abrahamic covenant. McKenzie and Graham remark that &quot;Jonah is in some ways the most &#x27;orthodox&#x27; of Israelite theologians – to make a theological point.&quot; Jonah&#x27;s statements throughout the book are characterized by their militancy, but his name ironically means &quot;dove&quot;, a bird which the ancient Israelites associated with peace.

Jonah&#x27;s rejection of God&#x27;s commands is a parody of the obedience of the prophets described in other Old Testament writings. The king of Nineveh&#x27;s instant repentance parodies the rulers throughout the other writings of the Old Testament who disregard prophetic warnings, such as Ahab and Zedekiah. The readiness to worship God displayed by the sailors on the ship and the people of Nineveh contrasts ironically with Jonah&#x27;s own reluctance, as does Jonah&#x27;s greater love for &quot;kikayon&quot; providing him shade than for all the people in Nineveh.

The Book of Jonah also employs elements of literary absurdism; it exaggerates the size of the city of Nineveh to an implausible degree and incorrectly refers to the administrator of the city as a &quot;king&quot;. According to scholars, no human could realistically survive for three days inside a fish, and the description of the livestock in Nineveh fasting alongside their owners is &quot;silly&quot;.
Some of these points are countered in the aforementioned lecture of Donald Wiseman.

The motif of a protagonist being swallowed by a giant fish or whale became a stock trope of later satirical writings. Similar incidents are recounted in Lucian of Samosata&#x27;s &quot;A True Story&quot;, which was written in the second century CE, and in the novel &quot;Baron Munchausen&#x27;s Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia&quot;, published by Rudolf Erich Raspe in 1785.

==The fish==
===Translation===

Though art and culture often depicts Jonah&#x27;s fish as a whale, the Hebrew text, as throughout scripture, refers to no marine species in particular, simply saying &quot;great fish&quot; or &quot;big fish&quot;. While some biblical scholars suggest the size and habits of the great white shark correspond better to the representations of Jonah&#x27;s experiences, normally an adult human is too large to be swallowed whole. The development of whaling from the 18th century onwards made it clear that most, if not all, species of whale are incapable of swallowing a human, leading to much controversy about the veracity of the biblical story of Jonah.

In Jonah 2:1 (1:17 in English translations), the Hebrew text reads &quot;dag gadol&quot; (דג גדול) or, in the Hebrew Masoretic Text, &quot;dāḡ gāḏōl&quot; (דָּ֣ג גָּד֔וֹל), which means &quot;great fish&quot;. The Septuagint translates this phrase into Greek as &quot;kētei megalōi&quot; (κήτει μεγάλῳ), meaning &quot;huge fish&quot;. In Greek mythology, the same word meaning &quot;fish&quot; (&quot;kêtos&quot;) is used to describe the sea monster slain by the hero Perseus that nearly devoured the Princess Andromeda. Jerome later translated this phrase as &quot;piscis grandis&quot; in his Latin Vulgate. He translated &quot;koilia kétous&quot;, however, as &quot;ventre ceti&quot; in Matthew 12:40: this second case occurs only in this verse of the New Testament.

At some point &quot;cetus&quot; became synonymous with &quot;whale&quot; (the study of whales is now called &quot;cetology&quot;). In his 1534 translation, William Tyndale translated the phrase in Jonah 2:1 as &quot;greate fyshe&quot; and the word &quot;kétos&quot; (Greek) or &quot;cetus&quot; (Latin) in Matthew 12:40 as &quot;whale&quot;. Tyndale&#x27;s translation was later incorporated into the Authorized Version of 1611. Since then, the &quot;great fish&quot; in Jonah 2 has been most often interpreted as a whale. In English some translations use the word &quot;whale&quot; for Matthew 12:40, while others use &quot;sea creature&quot; or &quot;big fish&quot;.

===Scientific speculation===
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, naturalists, interpreting the Jonah story as a historical account, became obsessed with trying to identify the exact species of the fish that swallowed Jonah. In the mid-nineteenth century, Edward Bouverie Pusey, professor of Hebrew at Oxford University, claimed that the Book of Jonah must have been authored by Jonah himself and argued that the fish story must be historically true, or else it would not have been included in the Bible. Pusey attempted to scientifically catalogue the fish, hoping to &quot;shame those who speak of the miracle of Jonah&#x27;s preservation in the fish as a thing less credible than any of God&#x27;s other miraculous doings&quot;.

The debate over the fish in the Book of Jonah played a major role during Clarence Darrow&#x27;s cross-examination of William Jennings Bryan at the Scopes trial in 1925. Darrow asked Bryan &quot;When you read that ... the whale swallowed Jonah ... how do you literally interpret that?&quot; Bryan replied that he believed in &quot;a God who can make a whale and can make a man and make both of them do what He pleases.&quot; Bryan ultimately admitted that it was necessary to interpret the Bible, and is generally regarded as having come off looking like a &quot;buffoon&quot;.

The largest of all whales – blue whales – are baleen whales which eat plankton; and &quot;it is commonly said that this species would be choked if it attempted to swallow a herring.&quot; The largest of all fishes – the whale shark — has a large mouth, but its throat is only four inches wide, with a sharp elbow or bend behind the opening, such that not even a human arm would be able to pass through it. Therefore, Jonah could not have been swallowed by a whale shark.

Sperm whales, however, appear to be a different matter: They regularly eat giant squid, so presumably one could swallow a human. Similar to a cow, sperm whales have four-chambered stomachs. The first chamber has no gastric juices but has muscular walls to crush its food. On the other hand, it is not possible to breathe inside the sperm whale&#x27;s stomach because there is no air (but probably methane instead). A 2023 novel by Daniel Kraus explores the idea of a man surviving being swallowed by a sperm whale, but with an oxygen tank.

==Cultural influence==

In Turkish, &quot;Jonah&#x27;s fish&quot; (&quot;yunus balığı&quot;) is the term used for dolphins. A long-established expression among sailors uses the term &quot;a Jonah&quot; to mean a sailor/passenger whose presence on board brings bad luck and endangers the ship. Later, this meaning was extended to &quot;a person who carries a jinx, one who will bring bad luck to any enterprise.&quot;

Despite its brevity, the Book of Jonah has been adapted numerous times in literature and in popular culture. In Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; (1851), Father Mapple delivers a sermon on the Book of Jonah. Mapple asks why Jonah does not show remorse for disobeying God while he is inside of the fish. He concludes that Jonah admirably understands that &quot;his dreadful punishment is just.&quot; Carlo Collodi&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot; (1883) features the title character and his father Geppetto being swallowed by &quot;the Terrible Dogfish,&quot; an allusion to the story of Jonah. Walt Disney&#x27;s 1940 film adaptation of the novel retains this allusion. The story of Jonah was adapted into Phil Vischer and Mike Nawrocki&#x27;s animated film &quot;&quot; (2002). In the film, Jonah (portrayed by Archibald Asparagus) is swallowed by a gargantuan whale.

==Suggested connections to legends==

===&quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;===
Joseph Campbell suggests that the story of Jonah parallels a scene from the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, in which Gilgamesh obtains a plant from the bottom of the sea. In the Book of Jonah, a worm (in Hebrew &quot;tola&#x27;ath&quot;, &quot;maggot&quot;) bites the shade-giving plant&#x27;s root causing it to wither; whereas in the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, Gilgamesh ties stones to his feet and plucks his plant from the floor of the sea. Once he returns to the shore, the rejuvenating plant is eaten by a serpent.

===Jason (Greek mythology)===
Campbell also noted several similarities between the story of Jonah and that of Jason in Greek mythology. The Greek rendering of the name Jonah is &quot;Jonas&quot; (Ἰωνᾶς), which differs from &quot;Jason&quot; (Ἰάσων) only in the order of sounds—both &quot;o&quot;s are omegas suggesting that Jason may have been confused with Jonah. Gildas Hamel, drawing on the Book of Jonah and Greco-Roman sources—including Greek vases and the accounts of Apollonius of Rhodes, Gaius Valerius Flaccus and Orphic Argonautica—identifies a number of shared motifs, including the names of the heroes, the presence of a dove, the idea of &quot;fleeing&quot; like the wind and causing a storm, the attitude of the sailors, the presence of a sea-monster or dragon threatening the hero or swallowing him, and the form and the word used for the &quot;gourd&quot; (&quot;kikayon&quot;). Hamel takes the view that it was the Hebrew author who reacted to and adapted this mythological material to communicate his own quite different message.

<text>The Jacquard machine () is a device fitted to a loom that simplifies the process of manufacturing textiles with such complex patterns as brocade, damask and matelassé. The resulting ensemble of the loom and Jacquard machine is then called a Jacquard loom. The machine was patented by Joseph Marie Jacquard in 1804, based on earlier inventions by the Frenchmen Basile Bouchon (1725), Jean Baptiste Falcon (1728), and Jacques Vaucanson (1740). The machine was controlled by a &quot;chain of cards&quot;; a number of punched cards laced together into a continuous sequence. Multiple rows of holes were punched on each card, with one complete card corresponding to one row of the design. 

Both the Jacquard process and the necessary loom attachment are named after their inventor. This mechanism is probably one of the most important weaving innovations, as Jacquard shedding made possible the automatic production of unlimited varieties of complex pattern weaving. The term &quot;Jacquard&quot; is not specific or limited to any particular loom, but rather refers to the added control mechanism that automates the patterning. The process can also be used for patterned knitwear and machine-knitted textiles such as jerseys.

This use of replaceable punched cards to control a sequence of operations is considered an important step in the history of computing hardware, having inspired Charles Babbage&#x27;s Analytical Engine.

==History==
Traditionally, figured designs were made on a drawloom. The heddles with warp ends to be pulled up were manually selected by a second operator, the draw boy, not the weaver. The work was slow and labour-intensive, and the complexity of the pattern was limited by practical factors.
The first prototype of a Jacquard-type loom was made in the second half of the 15th century by an Italian weaver from Calabria, Jean le Calabrais, who was invited to Lyon by Louis XI. He introduced a new kind of machine which was able to work the yarns faster and more precisely. Over the years, improvements to the loom were ongoing.

An improvement of the draw loom took place in 1725, when Basile Bouchon introduced the principle of applying a perforated band of paper. A continuous roll of paper was punched by hand, in sections, each of which represented one lash or tread, and the length of the roll was determined by the number of shots in each repeat of pattern. The Jacquard machine then evolved from this approach.

Joseph Marie Jacquard saw that a mechanism could be developed for the production of sophisticated patterns. He possibly combined mechanical elements of other inventors, but certainly innovated. His machine was generally similar to Vaucanson&#x27;s arrangement, but he made use of Jean-Baptiste Falcon&#x27;s individual pasteboard cards and his square prism (or card &quot;cylinder&quot;): he is credited with having fully perforated each of its four sides, replacing Vaucanson&#x27;s perforated &quot;barrel&quot;. Jacquard&#x27;s machine contained eight rows of needles and uprights, where Vaucanson had a double row. This modification enabled him to increase the figuring capacity of the machine. In his first machine, he supported the harness by knotted cords, which he elevated by a single trap board.

One of the chief advantages claimed for the Jacquard machine was that unlike previous damask-weaving machines, in which the figuring shed was usually drawn once for every four shots, with the new apparatus, it could be drawn on every shot, thus producing a fabric with greater definition of outline.

Jacquard&#x27;s invention had a deep influence on Charles Babbage. In that respect, he is viewed by some authors as a precursor of modern computing technology.

==Principles of operation==

As shown in the diagram, the cards are fastened into a continuous chain (1) which passes over a square box. At each quarter rotation, a new card is presented to the Jacquard head which represents one row (one &quot;pick&quot; of the shuttle carrying the weft). The box swings from the right to the position shown and presses against the control rods (2). For each hole in the card, a rod passes through and is unmoved; where there is no hole, a rod is pushed to the left. Each rod acts upon a hook (3). When the rod is pushed in, the hook moves out of position to the left; a rod that is not pushed in leaves its hook in place. A beam (4) then rises under the hooks, and the hooks in the rest position are raised. The hooks that have been displaced are not moved by the beam. Each hook can have multiple cords (5). Each cord passes through a guide (6) and is attached to a corresponding heddle (7) and return weight (8). The heddles raise the warp to create the shed through which the shuttle carrying the weft will pass. A loom with a 400-hook head might have four threads connected to each hook, resulting in a fabric that is 1600 warp ends wide with four repeats of the weave going across.

The term &quot;Jacquard loom&quot; is somewhat inaccurate. It is the &quot;Jacquard head&quot; that adapts to a great many dobby looms that allow the weaving machine to then create the intricate patterns often seen in Jacquard weaving.

Jacquard-driven looms, although relatively common in the textile industry, are not as ubiquitous as dobby looms which are usually faster and much cheaper to operate. However, dobby looms are not capable of producing many different weaves from one warp. Modern jacquard machines are controlled by computers in place of the original punched cards and can have thousands of hooks.

The threading of a Jacquard machine is so labor-intensive that many looms are threaded only once. Subsequent warps are then tied into the existing warp with the help of a knotting robot which ties on each new thread individually. Even for a small loom with only a few thousand warp ends, the process of re-threading can take days.

==Mechanical Jacquard devices==

Originally, Jacquard machines were mechanical, and the fabric design was stored on a series of punched cards which were joined to form a continuous chain. The Jacquards were often small and controlled relatively few warp ends. This required a number of repeats across the loom width. Larger capacity machines, or the use of multiple machines, allowed greater control with fewer repeats; hence, larger designs could be woven across the loom width.

A factory must choose looms and shedding mechanisms to suit its commercial requirements. As a rule, greater warp control means greater expense. So it is not economical to purchase Jacquard machines if one can make do with a dobby mechanism. Beyond the capital expense, Jacquard machines cost more to maintain as they are complex, require highly-skilled operators, and use expensive systems to prepare designs for the loom. Thus, they are more likely to produce faults than dobby or cam shedding. Also, the looms will not run as quickly and down-time will increase because it takes time to change the continuous chain of cards when a design changes. It is best to weave larger batches with mechanical Jacquards.

==Electronic Jacquard machines==
In 1855, a Frenchman adapted the Jacquard mechanism to a system by which it could be worked by electro-magnets. There was significant interest, but trials were not successful, and the development was soon forgotten.

Bonas Textile Machinery NV launched the first successful electronic Jacquard at ITMA Milan in 1983. Although the machines were initially small, modern technology has allowed Jacquard machine capacity to increase significantly, and single end warp control can extend to more than 10,000 warp ends. This eliminates the need for repeats and symmetrical designs and invites almost infinite versatility. The computer-controlled machines significantly reduce the down time associated with changing punchcards, thereby allowing smaller batch sizes. However, electronic Jacquards are costly and may not be necessary in a factory weaving large batch sizes and smaller designs. Larger machines accommodating single-end warp control are very expensive and can only be justified when great versatility or very specialized designs are required. For example, they are an ideal tool to increase the ability and versatility of niche linen Jacquard weavers who remain active in Europe and the West, while most large batch commodity weaving has moved to low-cost production.

Linen products associated with Jacquard weaving are linen damask napery, Jacquard apparel fabrics and damask bed linen. Jacquard weaving uses all sorts of fibers and blends of fibers, and it is used in the production of fabrics for many end uses. Jacquard weaving can also be used to create fabrics that have a Matelassé or a brocade pattern.

== The woven silk prayer book ==

A pinnacle of production using a Jacquard machine is a prayer book, woven in silk, entitled . All 58 pages of the prayer book were woven silk, made with a Jacquard machine using black and gray thread, at 160 threads per cm (400 threads per inch). The pages have elaborate borders with text and pictures of saints. An estimated 200,000 to 500,000 punchcards were necessary to encode the pages.

The book was issued in 1886 and 1887 in Lyon, France, and was publicly displayed at the 1889 &quot;Exposition Universelle&quot; (World&#x27;s Fair). It was designed by R. P. J. Hervier, woven by J. A. Henry, and published by A. Roux. It took two years and almost 50 trials to get correct. An estimated 50 or 60 copies were produced.

==Importance in computing==
The Jacquard head used replaceable punched cards to control a sequence of operations. It is considered an important step in the history of computing hardware. The ability to change the pattern of the loom&#x27;s weave by simply changing cards was an important conceptual precursor to the development of computer programming and data entry. Charles Babbage knew of Jacquard machines and planned to use cards to store programs in his Analytical Engine. In the late 19th century, Herman Hollerith took the idea of using punched cards to store information a step further when he created a punched card tabulating machine which he used to input data for the 1890 U.S. Census. A large data processing industry using punched-card technology was developed in the first half of the twentieth centurydominated initially by the International Business Machine corporation (IBM) with its line of unit record equipment. The cards were used for data, however, with programming done by plugboards.

Some early computers, such as the 1944 IBM Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator (Harvard Mark I) received program instructions from a paper tape punched with holes, similar to Jacquard&#x27;s string of cards. Later computers executed programs from higher-speed memory, though cards were commonly used to load the programs into memory. Punched cards remained in use in computing up until the mid-1980s.

<text>JUnit is a test automation framework for the Java programming language. JUnit is often used for unit testing, and is one of the xUnit frameworks.

JUnit is linked as a JAR at compile-time. The latest version of the framework, JUnit 5, resides under package . Previous versions JUnit 4 and JUnit 3 were under packages and , respectively.

A research survey performed in 2013 across 10,000 Java projects hosted on GitHub found that JUnit (in a tie with slf4j-api) was the most commonly included external library. Each library was used by 30.7% of projects.

==JUnit Lifecycle==
Every JUnit test class usually has several test cases. These test cases are subject to the test life cycle. The full JUnit Lifecycle has three major phases:
# Setup phase - This phase is where the test infrastructure is prepared. Two levels of setup are available. The first type of setup is class-level setup in which a computationally expensive object, such as a database connection, is created and reused, with minimal side effects. Class-level setup is implemented using the annotation. The other type is setup before running each test case, which uses the annotation.
# Test execution - This phase is responsible for running the test and verifying the result. The test result will indicate if the test result is a success or a failure. The annotation is used here.
# Clean up phase - After all posttest executions are performed, the system may need to perform cleanup. Similar to class-level setup, there is a corresponding class-level clean up. The annotation is used to support class-level clean up. The annotation allows for cleanup after test execution.

==Integration with other tools==
JUnit 5 integrates a number of tools, such as build tools, integrated development environments (IDE), continuous integration (CI) tools and many more.

===Build Tools===

JUnit supports Apache Ant, Apache Maven and Gradle build tools, which are the most widely used project build tools. Build tools are vital for automating the process of building the project. 

====Ant Extension====

Apache Ant, also known as Ant, is one of the build tools with the highest degree of versatility, and has the longest history out of the three build tools listed above. Ant centers around the codice_1 file, used for configuring the tasks necessary to run a project. Ant also has an extension called Apache Ivy, which helps deal with dependency resolution. The project dependencies can be declared in the codice_2 file. Ant can integrate with JUnit 5 by configuring the Java code coverage tools (JaCoCo), for the codice_2 file. The codice_2 can then be configured with the codice_5 and codice_6 dependencies to integrate with JUnit 5. 

====Maven Extension====
In contrast to Ant, Apache Maven, also known as Maven, uses a standardized and unified approach to the build process. Maven follows the paradigm of &quot;convention over configuration&quot; for managing its dependencies. The Java source code (or &quot;src&quot;) can be found under the codice_7 directory, and the test files can be found under the codice_8 directory. Maven can be used for any Java Project. It uses the Project Object Model (POM), which is an XML-based approach to configuring the build steps for the project. The minimal Maven with the codice_9 build file must contain a list of dependencies and a unique project identifier. Maven must be available on the build path to work. Maven can integrate with JUnit 5 using the codice_10 plugin which supports out-of-box functionality for JUnit 5 tests. Different Maven goals can be specified to achieve these tasks.

====Gradle Extension====
Gradle is a build tool that borrows many concepts from its predecessors, Ant and Maven. It uses the file to declare the steps required for the project build. Unlike Ant and Maven, which are XML-based, Gradle requires the use of Apache Groovy, which is a Java-based programming language. Unlike Ant and Maven, Gradle does not require the use of XML. Gradle still adheres to Maven&#x27;s &quot;convention over configuration&quot; approach, and follows the same structure for and directories. Gradle can integrate with JUnit 5 by configuring a plugin alongside the junit-platform plug-in given by the JUnit 5 team in the build file.

==JUnit Extension Model==
JUnit follows the paradigm of preferring extension points over features. The JUnit team decided not to put all features within the JUnit core, and instead decided to give an extensible way for developers to address their concerns. 

In JUnit 4, there are two extension mechanisms: the Runner API and Rule API. There were some disadvantages to both the Runner API and the Rule API. 

A major limitation of the Runner API is that the developer has to implement the entire life cycle even if they only need a specific life cycle stage. This is too complicated and heighweight for the majority of use cases. Another major limitation is that only one runner class is used for each test case, and makes them uncomposable. As an example, Mockito and Parameterized runners cannot exist within the same test class. 

A major limitation of the Rule API is that it cannot control the entire life cycle of the test, so they cannot be used for every single use case. They are only appropriate when something needs to occur before or after test case execution. Another major limitation is that rules for class-level and method-level callbacks must be made separately. 

In JUnit 5, the extension API is found within the JUnit Jupiter Engine. The JUnit Team wants to allow the developer to hook to separate stages of a test life cycle by providing a single unified extension API. Upon reaching a certain life cycle phase, the Jupiter Engine will invoke all registered extensions for that phase. The developer can hook into five major extension points:
# Test life cycle callbacks - This allows the developer to hook to certain phases of a test life cycle
# Test instance post-processing - this enables the developer to hook after test instance creation by implementing the TestInstancePostProcessor interface.
# Conditional test execution - this enables the developer to execute the test case only after meeting certain criteria.
# Parameter resolution - This enables the developer to resolve a parameter after receiving it from a test method or constructor.
# Exception handling - A use case for exception handling is to change the testing behavior instead of throwing an exception.

==Example of a JUnit test fixture==
A JUnit test fixture is a Java object. Test methods must be annotated by the annotation. If the situation requires it, it is also possible to define a method to execute before (or after) each (or all) of the test methods with the (or ) and (or ) annotations.
import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;

class FoobarTests {
 @BeforeAll
 static void setUpClass() throws Exception {
 // Code executed before the first test method

 @BeforeEach
 void setUp() throws Exception {
 // Code executed before each test
 
 @Test
 void oneThing() {
 // Code that tests one thing

 @Test
 void anotherThing() {
 // Code that tests another thing

 @Test
 void somethingElse() {
 // Code that tests something else

 @AfterEach
 void tearDown() throws Exception {
 // Code executed after each test 
 
 @AfterAll
 static void tearDownClass() throws Exception {
 // Code executed after the last test method 
}
==Previous versions of JUnit==
According to Martin Fowler, one of the early adopters of JUnit:
As a side effect of its wide use, previous versions of JUnit remain popular, with JUnit 4 having over 100,000 usages by other software components on the Maven Central repository.

In JUnit 4, the annotations for test execution callbacks were , , , and , as opposed to JUnit 5&#x27;s , , , and .

In JUnit 3, test fixtures had to inherit from . Additionally, test methods had to be prefixed with &#x27;test&#x27;.

<doc id="16227" wikidata="Q313270" url="?curid=16227" title="Jerome Kern">
<text>Jerome David Kern (January 27, 1885 – November 11, 1945) was an American composer of musical theatre and popular music. One of the most important American theatre composers of the early 20th century, he wrote more than 700 songs, used in over 100 stage works, including such classics as &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Lovin&#x27; Dat Man&quot;, &quot;A Fine Romance&quot;, &quot;Smoke Gets in Your Eyes&quot;, &quot;The Song Is You&quot;, &quot;All the Things You Are&quot;, &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot; and &quot;Long Ago (and Far Away)&quot;. He collaborated with many of the leading librettists and lyricists of his era, including George Grossmith Jr., Guy Bolton, P. G. Wodehouse, Otto Harbach, Oscar Hammerstein II, Dorothy Fields, Johnny Mercer, Ira Gershwin and Yip Harburg.

A native New Yorker, Kern created dozens of Broadway musicals and Hollywood films in a career that lasted for more than four decades. His musical innovations, such as 4/4 dance rhythms and the employment of syncopation and jazz progressions, built on, rather than rejected, earlier musical theatre tradition. He and his collaborators also employed his melodies to further the action or develop characterization to a greater extent than in the other musicals of his day, creating the model for later musicals. Although dozens of Kern&#x27;s musicals and musical films were hits, only &quot;Show Boat&quot; is now regularly revived. Songs from his other shows, however, are still frequently performed and adapted. Many of Kern&#x27;s songs have been adapted by jazz musicians to become standard tunes.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Kern was born in New York City, on Sutton Place, in what was then the city&#x27;s brewery district. His parents were Henry Kern (1842–1908), a Jewish German immigrant, and Fannie Kern &quot;née&quot; Kakeles (1852–1907), who was an American Jew of Bohemian parentage. At the time of Kern&#x27;s birth, his father ran a livery stable; later he became a successful merchant. Kern grew up on East 56th Street in Manhattan, where he attended public schools. He showed an early aptitude for music and was taught to play the piano and organ by his mother, a professional player and teacher.

In 1897, the family moved to Newark, New Jersey, where Kern attended Newark High School (which became Barringer High School in 1907). He wrote songs for the school&#x27;s first musical, a minstrel show, in 1901, and for an amateur musical adaptation of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; put on at the Newark Yacht Club in January 1902. Kern left high school before graduation in the spring of his senior year in 1902. In response, Kern&#x27;s father insisted that his son work with him in business, instead of composing. Kern, however, failed miserably in one of his earliest tasks: he was supposed to purchase two pianos for the store, but instead he ordered 200. His father relented, and later in 1902, Kern became a student at the New York College of Music, studying the piano under Alexander Lambert and Paolo Gallico, and harmony under Dr. Austin Pierce. His first published composition, a piano piece, &quot;At the Casino&quot;, appeared in the same year. Between 1903 and 1905, he continued his musical training under private tutors in Heidelberg, Germany, returning to New York via London.

===First compositions===

For a time, Kern worked as a rehearsal pianist in Broadway theatres and as a song-plugger for Tin Pan Alley music publishers. While in London, he secured a contract from the American impresario Charles Frohman to provide songs for interpolation in Broadway versions of London shows. He began to provide these additions in 1904 to British scores for &quot;An English Daisy&quot;, by Seymour Hicks and Walter Slaughter, and &quot;Mr. Wix of Wickham&quot;, for which he wrote most of the songs.

In 1905, Kern contributed the song &quot;How&#x27;d you like to spoon with me?&quot; to Ivan Caryll&#x27;s hit musical &quot;The Earl and the Girl&quot; when the show transferred to Chicago and New York in 1905. He also contributed to the New York production of &quot;The Catch of the Season&quot; (1905), &quot;The Little Cherub&quot; (1906) and &quot;The Orchid&quot; (1907), among other shows. From 1905 on, he spent long periods of time in London, contributing songs to West End shows like &quot;The Beauty of Bath&quot; (1906; with lyricist P. G. Wodehouse) and making valuable contacts, including George Grossmith Jr. and Seymour Hicks, who were the first to introduce Kern&#x27;s songs to the London stage. In 1909 during one of his stays in England, Kern took a boat trip on the River Thames with some friends, and when the boat stopped at Walton-on-Thames, they went to an inn called the Swan for a drink. Kern was much taken with the proprietor&#x27;s daughter, Eva Leale (1891–1959), who was working behind the bar. He wooed her, and they were married at the Anglican church of St. Mary&#x27;s in Walton on October 25, 1910. The couple then lived at the Swan when Kern was in England.
Kern is believed to have composed music for silent films as early as 1912, but the earliest documented film music which he is known to have written was for a twenty-part serial, &quot;Gloria&#x27;s Romance&quot; in 1916. This was one of the first starring vehicles for Billie Burke, for whom Kern had earlier written the song &quot;Mind the Paint&quot;, with lyrics by A. W. Pinero. The film is now considered lost, but Kern&#x27;s music survives. Another score for the silent movies, &quot;Jubilo&quot;, followed in 1919. Kern was one of the founding members of ASCAP.

Kern&#x27;s first complete score was Broadway&#x27;s &quot;The Red Petticoat&quot; (1912), one of the first musical-comedy Westerns. The libretto was by Rida Johnson Young. By World War I, more than a hundred of Kern&#x27;s songs had been used in about thirty productions, mostly Broadway adaptations of West End and European shows. Kern contributed two songs to &quot;To-Night&#x27;s the Night&quot; (1914), another Rubens musical. It opened in New York and went on to become a hit in London. The best known of Kern&#x27;s songs from this period is probably &quot;They Didn&#x27;t Believe Me&quot;, which was a hit in the New York version of the Paul Rubens and Sidney Jones musical, &quot;The Girl from Utah&quot; (1914), for which Kern wrote five songs. Kern&#x27;s song, with four beats to a bar, departed from the customary waltz-rhythms of European influence and fitted the new American passion for modern dances such as the fox-trot. He was also able to use elements of American styles, such as ragtime, as well as syncopation, in his lively dance tunes. Theatre historian John Kenrick writes that the song put Kern in great demand on Broadway and established a pattern for musical comedy love songs that lasted through the 1960s.

In May 1915, Kern was due to sail with Charles Frohman from New York to London on board the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot;, but Kern missed the boat, having overslept after staying up late playing poker. Frohman died in the sinking of the ship.

===Princess Theatre musicals===

Kern composed 16 Broadway scores between 1915 and 1920 and also contributed songs to the London hit &quot;Theodore &amp; Co&quot; (1916; most of the songs are by the young Ivor Novello) and to revues like the Ziegfeld Follies. The most notable of his scores were those for a series of shows written for the Princess Theatre, a small (299-seat) house built by Ray Comstock. Theatrical agent Elisabeth Marbury asked Kern and librettist Guy Bolton to create a series of intimate and low-budget, yet smart, musicals.

The &quot;Princess Theatre shows&quot; were unique on Broadway not only for their small size, but their clever, coherent plots, integrated scores and naturalistic acting, which presented &quot;a sharp contrast to the large-scale Ruritanian operettas then in vogue&quot; or the star-studded revues and extravaganzas of producers like Florenz Ziegfeld. Earlier musical comedy had often been thinly plotted, gaudy pieces, marked by the insertion of songs into their scores with little regard to the plot. But Kern and Bolton followed the examples of Gilbert and Sullivan and French &quot;opéra bouffe&quot; in integrating song and story. &quot;These shows built and polished the mold from which almost all later major musical comedies evolved. ... The characters and situations were, within the limitations of musical comedy license, believable and the humor came from the situations or the nature of the characters. Kern&#x27;s exquisitely flowing melodies were employed to further the action or develop characterization.&quot; The shows featured modern American settings and simple scene changes to suit the small theatre.
The team&#x27;s first Princess Theatre show was an adaptation of Paul Rubens&#x27; 1905 London show, &quot;Mr. Popple (of Ippleton)&quot;, called &quot;Nobody Home&quot; (1915). The piece ran for 135 performances and was a modest financial success. However, it did little to fulfill the new team&#x27;s mission to innovate, except that Kern&#x27;s song, &quot;The Magic Melody&quot;, was the first Broadway showtune with a basic jazz progression. Kern and Bolton next created an original piece, &quot;Very Good Eddie&quot;, which was a surprise hit, running for 341 performances, with additional touring productions that went on into the 1918-19 season. The British humorist, lyricist and librettist P. G. Wodehouse joined the Princess team in 1917, adding his skill as a lyricist to the succeeding shows. &quot;Oh, Boy!&quot; (1917) ran for an extraordinary 463 performances. Other shows written for the theatre were &quot;Have a Heart&quot; (1917), &quot;Leave It to Jane&quot; (1917) and &quot;Oh, Lady! Lady!!&quot; (1918). The first opened at another theatre before &quot;Very Good Eddie&quot; closed. The second played elsewhere during the long run of &quot;Oh Boy!&quot; An anonymous admirer wrote a verse in their praise that begins:

In February 1918, Dorothy Parker wrote in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;:
&quot;Oh, Lady! Lady!!&quot; was the last successful &quot;Princess Theatre show&quot;. Kern and Wodehouse disagreed over money, and the composer decided to move on to other projects. Kern&#x27;s importance to the partnership was illustrated by the fate of the last musical of the series, &quot;Oh, My Dear!&quot; (1918), to which he contributed only one song: &quot;Go, Little Boat&quot;. The rest of the show was composed by Louis Hirsch and ran for 189 performances: &quot;Despite a respectable run, everyone realized there was little point in continuing the series without Kern.&quot;

===Early 1920s===

The 1920s were an extremely productive period in American musical theatre, and Kern created at least one show every year for the entire decade. His first show of 1920 was &quot;The Night Boat&quot;, with book and lyrics by Anne Caldwell, which ran for more than 300 performances in New York and for three seasons on tour. Later in the same year, Kern wrote the score for &quot;Sally&quot;, with a book by Bolton and lyrics by Otto Harbach. This show, staged by Florenz Ziegfeld, ran for 570 performances, one of the longest runs of any Broadway show in the decade, and popularized the song &quot;Look for the Silver Lining&quot; (which had been written for an earlier show), performed by the rising star Marilyn Miller. It also had a long run in London in 1921, produced by George Grossmith Jr. Kern&#x27;s next shows were &quot;Good Morning, Dearie&quot; (1921, with Caldwell) which ran for 347 performances; followed in 1922 by a West End success, &quot;The Cabaret Girl&quot; in collaboration with Grossmith and Wodehouse; another modest success by the same team, &quot;The Beauty Prize&quot; (1923); and a Broadway flop, &quot;The Bunch and Judy&quot;, remembered, if at all, as the first time Kern and Fred Astaire worked together.

&quot;Stepping Stones&quot; (1923, with Caldwell) was a success, and in 1924 the Princess Theatre team of Bolton, Wodehouse and Kern reunited to write &quot;Sitting Pretty&quot;, but it did not recapture the popularity of the earlier collaborations. Its relative failure may have been partly due to Kern&#x27;s growing aversion to having individual songs from his shows performed out of context on radio, in cabaret, or on record, although his chief objection was to jazz interpretations of his songs. He called himself a &quot;musical clothier – nothing more or less,&quot; and said, &quot;I write music to both the situations and the lyrics in plays.&quot; When &quot;Sitting Pretty&quot; was produced, he forbade any broadcasting or recording of individual numbers from the show, which limited their chance to gain popularity.

1925 was a major turning point in Kern&#x27;s career when he met Oscar Hammerstein II, with whom he would entertain a lifelong friendship and collaboration. As a young man, Kern had been an easy companion with great charm and humor, but he became less outgoing in his middle years, sometimes difficult to work with: he once introduced himself to a producer by saying, &quot;I hear you&#x27;re a son of a bitch. So am I.&quot; He rarely collaborated with any one lyricist for long. With Hammerstein, however, he remained on close terms for the rest of his life. Their first show, written together with Harbach, was &quot;Sunny&quot;, which featured the song &quot;Who (Stole My Heart Away)?&quot; Marilyn Miller played the title role, as she had in &quot;Sally&quot;. The show ran for 517 performances on Broadway, and the following year ran for 363 performances in the West End, starring Binnie Hale and Jack Buchanan.

===&quot;Show Boat&quot;===
Because of the strong success of &quot;Sally&quot; and &quot;Sunny&quot; and consistent good results with his other shows, Ziegfeld was willing to gamble on Kern&#x27;s next project in 1927. Kern had been impressed by Edna Ferber&#x27;s novel &quot;Show Boat&quot; and wished to present a musical stage version. He persuaded Hammerstein to adapt it and Ziegfeld to produce it. The story, dealing with racism, marital strife and alcoholism, was unheard of in the escapist world of musical comedy. Despite his doubts, Ziegfeld spared no expense in staging the piece to give it its full epic grandeur. According to the theatre historian John Kenrick: &quot;After the opening night audience filed out of the Ziegfeld Theatre in near silence, Ziegfeld thought his worst fears had been confirmed. He was pleasantly surprised when the next morning brought ecstatic reviews and long lines at the box office. In fact, &quot;Show Boat&quot; proved to be the most lasting accomplishment of Ziegfeld&#x27;s career – the only one of his shows that is regularly performed today.&quot; The score is, arguably, Kern&#x27;s greatest and includes the well-known songs &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Lovin&#x27; Dat Man&quot; as well as &quot;Make Believe&quot;, &quot;You Are Love&quot;, &quot;Life Upon the Wicked Stage&quot;, &quot;Why Do I Love You&quot;, all with lyrics by Hammerstein, and &quot;Bill&quot;, originally written for &quot;Oh, Lady! Lady!&quot;, with lyrics by P. G. Wodehouse. The show ran for 572 performances on Broadway and was also a success in London. Although Ferber&#x27;s novel was filmed unsuccessfully as a part-talkie in 1929 (using some songs from the Kern score), the musical itself was filmed twice, in 1936, and, with Technicolor, in 1951. In 1989, a stage version of the musical was presented on television for the first time, in a production from the Paper Mill Playhouse telecast by PBS on &quot;Great Performances&quot;.

While most Kern musicals have largely been forgotten, except for their songs, &quot;Show Boat&quot; remains well-remembered and frequently seen. It is a staple of stock productions and has been revived numerous times on Broadway and in London. A 1946 revival integrated choreography into the show, in the manner of a Rodgers and Hammerstein production, as did the 1994 Harold Prince–Susan Stroman revival, which was nominated for ten Tony Awards, winning five, including best revival. It was the first musical to enter a major opera company&#x27;s repertory (New York City Opera, 1954), and the rediscovery of the 1927 score with Robert Russell Bennett&#x27;s original orchestrations led to a large-scale EMI recording in 1987 and several opera-house productions. In 1941, the conductor Artur Rodziński wished to commission a symphonic suite from the score, but Kern considered himself a songwriter and not a symphonist. He never orchestrated his own scores, leaving that to musical assistants, principally Frank Saddler (until 1921) and Robert Russell Bennett (from 1923). In response to the commission, Kern oversaw an arrangement by Charles Miller and Emil Gerstenberger of numbers from the show into the orchestral work &quot;Scenario for Orchestra: Themes from Show Boat&quot;, premiered in 1941 by the Cleveland Orchestra conducted by Rodziński.
Kern&#x27;s last Broadway show in the 1920s was &quot;Sweet Adeline&quot; (1929), with a libretto by Hammerstein. It was a period piece, set in the Gay 90s, about a girl from Hoboken, New Jersey (near Kern&#x27;s childhood home), who becomes a Broadway star. Opening just before the stock market crash, it received rave reviews, but the elaborate, old-fashioned piece was a step back from the innovations in &quot;Show Boat&quot;, or even the Princess Theatre shows. In January 1929, at the height of the Jazz Age, and with &quot;Show Boat&quot; still playing on Broadway, Kern made news on both sides of the Atlantic for reasons wholly unconnected with music. He sold at auction, at New York&#x27;s Anderson Galleries, the collection of English and American literature that he had been building up for more than a decade. The collection, rich in inscribed first editions and manuscript material of eighteenth and nineteenth century authors, sold for a total of $1,729,462.50 () – a record for a single-owner sale that stood for over fifty years. Among the books he sold were first or early editions of poems by Robert Burns and Percy Bysshe Shelley, and works by Jonathan Swift, Henry Fielding and Charles Dickens, as well as manuscripts by Alexander Pope, John Keats, Shelley, Lord Byron, Thomas Hardy and others.

===First films and later shows===
In 1929 Kern made his first trip to Hollywood to supervise the 1929 film version of &quot;Sally&quot;, one of the first &quot;all-talking&quot; Technicolor films. The following year, he was there a second time to work on &quot;Men of the Sky&quot;, released in 1931 without his songs, and a 1930 film version of &quot;Sunny&quot;. There was a public reaction against the early glut of film musicals after the advent of film sound; Hollywood released more than 100 musical films in 1930, but only 14 in 1931. Warner Bros. bought out Kern&#x27;s contract, and he returned to the stage. He collaborated with Harbach on the Broadway musical &quot;The Cat and the Fiddle&quot; (1931), about a composer and an opera singer, featuring the songs &quot;She Didn&#x27;t Say Yes&quot; and &quot;The Night Was Made for Love&quot;. It ran for 395 performances, a remarkable success for the Depression years, and transferred to London the following year. It was filmed in 1934 with Jeanette MacDonald.

&quot;Music in the Air&quot; (1932) was another Kern-Hammerstein collaboration and another show-biz plot, best remembered today for &quot;The Song Is You&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Told Ev&#x27;ry Little Star&quot;. It was &quot;undoubtedly an operetta&quot;, set in the German countryside, but without the Ruritanian trimmings of the operettas of Kern&#x27;s youth. &quot;Roberta&quot; (1933) by Kern and Harbach included the songs &quot;Smoke Gets in Your Eyes&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Begin&quot; and &quot;Yesterdays&quot; and featured, among others, Bob Hope, Fred MacMurray, George Murphy and Sydney Greenstreet all in the early stages of their careers. Kern&#x27;s &quot;Three Sisters&quot; (1934), was his last West End show, with a libretto by Hammerstein. The musical, depicting horse-racing, the circus, and class distinctions, was a failure, running for only two months. Its song &quot;I Won&#x27;t Dance&quot; was used in the film &quot;Roberta&quot;. Some British critics objected to American writers essaying a British story; James Agate, doyen of London theatre critics of the day, dismissed it as &quot;American inanity,&quot; though both Kern and Hammerstein were strong and knowledgeable Anglophiles. Kern&#x27;s last Broadway show (other than revivals) was &quot;Very Warm for May&quot; (1939), another show-biz story and another disappointment, although the score included the Kern and Hammerstein classic &quot;All The Things You Are&quot;.

===Kern in Hollywood===
In 1935, when musical films had become popular once again, thanks to Busby Berkeley, Kern returned to Hollywood, where he composed the scores to a dozen more films, although he also continued working on Broadway productions. He settled permanently in Hollywood in 1937. After suffering a heart attack in 1939, he was told by his doctors to concentrate on film scores, a less stressful task, as Hollywood songwriters were not as deeply involved with the production of their works as Broadway songwriters. This second phase of Kern&#x27;s Hollywood career had considerably greater artistic and commercial success than the first. With Hammerstein, he wrote songs for the film versions of his recent Broadway shows &quot;Music in the Air&quot; (1934), which starred Gloria Swanson in a rare singing role, and &quot;Sweet Adeline&quot; (1935). With Dorothy Fields, he composed the new music for &quot;I Dream Too Much&quot; (1935), a musical melodrama about the opera world, starring the Metropolitan Opera diva Lily Pons. Kern and Fields interspersed the opera numbers with their songs, including &quot;the swinging &#x27;I Got Love,&#x27; the lullaby &#x27;The Jockey on the Carousel,&#x27; and the entrancing title song.&quot; Also with Fields, he wrote two new songs, &quot;I Won&#x27;t Dance&quot; and &quot;Lovely to Look At&quot;, for the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film version of &quot;Roberta&quot; (1935), which was a hit. The show also included the song &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Hard to Handle&quot;. This was given a 1952 remake called &quot;Lovely to Look At&quot;.

Their next film, &quot;Swing Time&quot; (1936) included the song &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot;, which won the Academy Award in 1936 for the best song. Other songs in &quot;Swing Time&quot; include &quot;A Fine Romance&quot;, &quot;Pick Yourself Up&quot; and &quot;Never Gonna Dance&quot;. &quot;The Oxford Companion to the American Musical&quot; calls &quot;Swing Time&quot; &quot;a strong candidate for the best of the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals&quot; and says that, although the screenplay is contrived, it &quot;left plenty of room for dance and all of it was superb. ... Although the movie is remembered as one of the great dance musicals, it also boasts one of the best film scores of the 1930s.&quot; For the 1936 film version of &quot;Show Boat&quot;, Kern and Hammerstein wrote three new songs, including &quot;I Have The Room Above Her&quot; and &quot;Ah Still Suits Me&quot;. &quot;High, Wide, and Handsome&quot; (1937) was intentionally similar in plot and style to &quot;Show Boat&quot;, but it was a box-office failure. Kern songs were also used in the Cary Grant film, &quot;When You&#x27;re in Love&quot; (1937), and the first Abbott and Costello feature, &quot;One Night in the Tropics&quot; (1940). In 1940, Hammerstein wrote the lyric &quot;The Last Time I Saw Paris&quot;, in homage to the French capital, recently occupied by the Germans. Kern set it, the only time he set a pre-written lyric, and his only hit song not written as part of a musical. Originally a hit for Tony Martin and later for Noël Coward, the song was used in the film &quot;Lady Be Good&quot; (1941) and won Kern another Oscar for best song. Kern&#x27;s second and last symphonic work was his &#x27;Mark Twain Suite&quot; (1942).

In his last Hollywood musicals, Kern worked with several new and distinguished partners. With Johnny Mercer for &quot;You Were Never Lovelier&quot; (1942), he contributed &quot;a set of memorable songs to entertain audiences until the plot came to its inevitable conclusion&quot;. The film starred Astaire and Rita Hayworth and included the song &quot;I&#x27;m Old Fashioned&quot;. Kern&#x27;s next collaboration was with Ira Gershwin on &quot;Cover Girl&quot; starring Hayworth and Gene Kelly (1944) for which Kern composed &quot;Sure Thing&quot;,&quot;Put Me to the Test,&quot; &quot;Make Way for Tomorrow&quot; (lyric by E. Y. Harburg), and the hit ballad &quot;Long Ago (and Far Away)&quot;. For the Deanna Durbin Western musical, &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Singing&quot; (1944), with lyrics by Harburg, Kern &quot;provided the best original score of Durbin&#x27;s career, mixing operetta and Broadway sounds in such songs as &#x27;Any Moment Now,&#x27; &#x27;Swing Your Partner,&#x27; &#x27;More and More,&#x27; and the lilting title number.&quot; &quot;More and More&quot; was nominated for an Oscar.

Kern composed his last film score, &quot;Centennial Summer&quot; (1946) in which &quot;the songs were as resplendent as the story and characters were mediocre. ... Oscar Hammerstein, Leo Robin, and E. Y. Harburg contributed lyrics for Kern&#x27;s lovely music, resulting in the soulful ballad &#x27;All Through the Day,&#x27; the rustic &#x27;Cinderella Sue,&#x27; the cheerful &#x27;Up With the Lark,&#x27; and the torchy &#x27;In Love in Vain.&#x27;&quot; &quot;All Through the Day&quot; was another Oscar nominee. The music of Kern&#x27;s last two films is notable in the way it developed from his earlier work. Some of it was too advanced for the film companies; Kern&#x27;s biographer, Stephen Banfield, refers to &quot;tonal experimentation ... outlandish enharmonics&quot; that the studios insisted on cutting. At the same time, in some ways his music came full circle: having in his youth helped to end the reigns of the waltz and operetta, he now composed three of his finest waltzes (&quot;Can&#x27;t Help Singing&quot;, &quot;Californ-i-ay&quot; and &quot;Up With the Lark&quot;), the last having a distinctly operetta-like character.

===Personal life and death===

Kern and his wife, Eva, often vacationed on their yacht &quot;Show Boat&quot;. He collected rare books and enjoyed betting on horses. At the time of Kern&#x27;s death, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was filming a fictionalized version of his life, &quot;Till the Clouds Roll By&quot;, which was released in 1946 starring Robert Walker as Kern. In the film, Kern&#x27;s songs are sung by Judy Garland, Kathryn Grayson, June Allyson, Lena Horne, Dinah Shore, Frank Sinatra and Angela Lansbury, among others, and Gower Champion and Cyd Charisse appear as dancers. Many of the biographical elements are fictionalized.

In the fall of 1945, Kern returned to New York City to oversee auditions for a new revival of &quot;Show Boat&quot;, and began to work on the score for what would become the musical &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, to be produced by Rodgers and Hammerstein. On November 5, 1945, at 60 years of age, he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage while walking at the corner of Park Avenue and 57th Street. Identifiable only by his ASCAP card, Kern was initially taken to the indigent ward at City Hospital, later being transferred to Doctors Hospital in Manhattan. Hammerstein was at his side when Kern&#x27;s breathing stopped. Hammerstein hummed or sang the song &quot;I&#x27;ve Told Ev&#x27;ry Little Star&quot; from &quot;Music in the Air&quot; (a personal favorite of the composer&#x27;s) into Kern&#x27;s ear. Receiving no response, Hammerstein realized Kern had died. Rodgers and Hammerstein then assigned the task of writing the score for &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; to the veteran Broadway composer Irving Berlin.

Kern is interred at Ferncliff Cemetery in Westchester County, New York. His daughter, Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Jane Kern (1918–1996) married Artie Shaw in 1942 and later Jack Cummings. Kern&#x27;s wife eventually remarried, to a singer named George Byron.

==Accolades==
Jerome Kern was nominated eight times for an Academy Award, and won twice. Seven nominations were for Best Original Song; these included a posthumous nomination in each of 1945 and 1946. One nomination was in 1945 for Best Original Music Score. Kern was not eligible for any Tony Awards, which were not created until 1947. In 1976, &quot;Very Good Eddie&quot; was nominated for a Drama Desk Award as Outstanding Revival, and the director and actors received various Tony, Drama Desk and other awards and nominations. Elisabeth Welsh was nominated for a Tony Award for her performance in &quot;Jerome Kern Goes to Hollywood&quot; in 1986, and &quot;Show Boat&quot; received Tony nominations in both 1983 and 1995, winning for best revival in 1995 (among numerous other awards and nominations), and won the Laurence Olivier Award for best revival in 2008. In 1986, &quot;Big Deal&quot; was nominated for the Tony for best musical, among other awards, and Bob Fosse won as best choreographer. In 2000, &quot;Swing!&quot;, featuring Kern&#x27;s &quot;I Won&#x27;t Dance&quot; was nominated for the Tony for Best Musical, among others. In 2002, &quot;Elaine Stritch at Liberty&quot;, featuring Kern&#x27;s &quot;All in Fun&quot;, won the Tony Award for Best Special Theatrical Event. In 2004, &quot;Never Gonna Dance&quot; received two Tony nominations.

Kern was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame posthumously, in 1970. In 1985, the U.S. Post Office issued a postage stamp (Scott #2110, 22¢), with an illustration of Kern holding sheet music. The Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia was named after Kern by his Dixieland bandleader father.

==Selected works==
Note: All shows listed are musical comedies for which Kern was the sole composer unless otherwise specified.

During his first phase of work (1904–1911), Kern wrote songs for 22 Broadway productions, including songs interpolated into British musicals or featured in revues (sometimes writing lyrics as well as music), and he occasionally co-wrote musicals with one or two other composers. During visits to London beginning in 1905, he also composed songs that were first performed in several London shows. The following are some of the most notable such shows from this period:

From 1912 to 1924, the more-experienced Kern began to work on dramatically concerned shows, including incidental music for plays, and, for the first time since his college show &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, he wrote musicals as the sole composer. His regular lyricist collaborators for his more than 30 shows during this period were Bolton, Wodehouse, Caldwell, Harry B. Smith and Howard Dietz. Some of his most notable shows during this very productive period were as follows:
*&quot;The &quot;Mind-the-Paint&quot; Girl&quot; (1912 play; starring Billie Burke) – incidental music
*&quot;The Red Petticoat&quot; (1912) – Kern&#x27;s first complete score

*&quot;Stepping Stones&quot; (1923)
During the last phase of his theatrical composing career, Kern continued to work with his previous collaborators but also met Oscar Hammerstein II and Otto Harbach, with whom Kern wrote his most lasting, memorable, and well-known works. The most successful of these are as follows:

*&quot;Sunny&quot; (1925) – a follow-up to &quot;Sally&quot; and almost as big a hit; first collaboration with Hammerstein and Harbach
*&quot;Criss Cross&quot; (1926) – with Harbach
*&quot;Show Boat&quot; (1927; revived frequently) – with Hammerstein
*&quot;Blue Eyes&quot; (1928; London)
*&quot;Sweet Adeline&quot; (1929) – with Hammerstein
*&quot;The Cat and the Fiddle&quot; (1931) – Kern collaborated with Harbach the music, book and lyrics

<text>James Maury Henson (September 24, 1936 – May 16, 1990) was an American puppeteer, animator, actor, and filmmaker who achieved worldwide notability as the creator of the Muppets. Henson was also well known for creating &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; (1983–1987) and as the director of &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; (1982) and &quot;Labyrinth&quot; (1986).

Born in Greenville, Mississippi, and raised in both Leland, Mississippi, and University Park, Maryland, Henson began developing puppets in high school. He created &quot;Sam and Friends&quot; (1955–1961), a short-form comedy television program on WRC-TV, while he was a freshman at the University of Maryland, College Park, in collaboration with fellow student Jane Nebel. Henson and Nebel co-founded Muppets, Inc. – now The Jim Henson Company – in 1958, and married less than a year later in 1959. Henson graduated from the University of Maryland with a degree in home economics.

In 1969, Henson joined the children&#x27;s educational television program &quot;Sesame Street&quot; (1969–present) where he helped to develop Muppet characters for the series. He and his creative team also appeared on the first season of the sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (1975–present). He produced the sketch comedy television series &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; (1976–1981) during this period. Henson revolutionized the way puppetry is captured and presented in video media, and he won fame for his characters – particularly Kermit the Frog, Rowlf the Dog, and the characters on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. During the later years of his life, he founded the Jim Henson Foundation and Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop. He won the Emmy Award twice for his involvement in &quot;The StoryTeller&quot; (1987–1988) and &quot;The Jim Henson Hour&quot; (1989).

Henson died in New York City from toxic shock syndrome caused by &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;. At the time of his death, he was in negotiations to sell his company to The Walt Disney Company, but talks fell through after his death. He was posthumously awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1991, and was named a Disney Legend in 2011.

==Early life==
James Maury Henson was born on September 24, 1936, in Greenville, Mississippi, the younger of two children of Betty Marcella (née Brown, 1904–1972) and Paul Ransom Henson (1904–1994), an agronomist for the United States Department of Agriculture. Henson&#x27;s older brother, Paul Ransom Henson Jr. (1932–1956), died in a car crash on April 15, 1956. He was raised as a Christian Scientist and spent his early childhood in nearby Leland, Mississippi, before moving with his family to University Park, Maryland, near Washington, D.C., in the late 1940s and later to Bethesda, Maryland. He remembered the arrival of the family&#x27;s first television as &quot;the biggest event of his adolescence&quot;, being heavily influenced by radio ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and the early television puppets of Burr Tillstrom on &quot;Kukla, Fran and Ollie&quot; and Bil and Cora Baird. He remained a Christian Scientist at least into his twenties, when he taught Sunday school, but he wrote to a Christian Science church in the early 1970s to inform them that he was no longer a practicing member.

==Career==
===Education===
Henson attended a variety of grade schools in his youth, including Hyattsville High School until it was closed in 1951. He completed his high school career at the newly opened Northwestern High School, where he joined the puppetry club.

He enrolled at the University of Maryland, College Park, the following fall as a studio arts major, thinking that he might become a commercial artist. As a freshman at the university, Jim took a newly offered puppetry class mostly populated with seniors, including his future wife Jane Nebel. He graduated in 1960 with a Bachelor of Science degree in home economics.

===Early career: 1954–1961===
Henson began working at WTOP-TV (now WUSA-TV) in the late spring of 1954, at age , hired to &quot;manipulate marionettes&quot; on a Saturday morning children&#x27;s show called &quot;The Junior Morning Show&quot;, until the show was cancelled only three weeks later. This first break into the Television industry was short-lived, but his talent landed him and his puppets an opportunity to continue working at WTOP-TV, lip-syncing on Roy Meachum&#x27;s &quot;Saturday&quot; show.

Henson&#x27;s employment at WTOP-TV lasted only until August, when &quot;Saturday&quot; was also cancelled. Meachum then referred Jim to the local NBC-affiliate station WRC-TV, where Henson continued performing his puppets with Jane&#x27;s help. The two were eventually offered a nightly segment for which they created &quot;Sam and Friends&quot;, a five-minute puppet show that afforded Henson much more freedom to develop his own creative work. The characters on &quot;Sam and Friends&quot; were forerunners of the Muppets, and the show included a prototype of Henson&#x27;s most famous character Kermit the Frog. He remained at WRC until &quot;Sam and Friends&quot; aired its last episode on December 15, 1961.

In the show, Henson began experimenting with techniques that changed the way in which puppetry was used on television, foregoing the convention of pointing the camera at a stationary puppet theatre proscenium and instead using the image created by the TV camera and lens to dynamically engage with his characters. He believed that television puppets needed to have &quot;life and sensitivity&quot;. Rather than carving wooden puppets Henson built characters from softer, flexible materials like foam rubber; his first iteration of Kermit was made from a halved table tennis ball and fabric from an old coat belonging to his mother, with denim from a pair of jeans forming the sleeve for the puppeteer&#x27;s arm.

Though Henson told people that &quot;Muppet&quot; was a portmanteau of &quot;marionette&quot; and &quot;Puppet&quot;, many early Muppets were actually hand puppets, rod puppets, or some combination of the two. Direct control over the puppet&#x27;s mouth, in combination with the softer construction materials, allowed the puppeteer to express a wider range of emotions and to more accurately move the puppet&#x27;s mouth along with the character&#x27;s dialogue or while lip-syncing to music. Commenting on his puppet design philosophy, Henson said,&quot;A lot of people build very stiff puppets—you can barely move the things—and you can get very little expression out of a character that you can barely move. Your hand has a lot of flexibility to it, and what you want to do is to build a puppet that can reflect all that flexibility.&quot;&quot;Sam and Friends&quot; was a financial success, but Henson began to have doubts about going into a career performing with puppets once he graduated. He spent six weeks in Europe during the summer of 1958, originally with the intent to study painting, but was surprised to learn that puppets were considered just as serious of an art form as painting or sculpture. After returning to the United States he and Jane made their partnership official, creating Muppets, Inc. in November of that same year, then marrying each other in 1959.

===Television and Muppets: 1961–1969===

Henson spent much of the next two decades working in commercials, talk shows, and children&#x27;s projects before realizing his dream of the Muppets as &quot;entertainment for everybody&quot;. The popularity of his work on &quot;Sam and Friends&quot; in the late 1950s led to a series of guest appearances on network talk and variety shows. He appeared as a guest on many shows, including &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;, &quot;The Jack Paar Program&quot;, and &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. (Sullivan introduced him as &quot;Jim Newsom and his Puppets&quot; on September 11, 1966.) These television broadcasts greatly increased his exposure, leading to hundreds of commercial appearances by Henson characters throughout the 1960s.

Among the most popular of Henson&#x27;s commercials was a series for the local Wilkins Coffee company in Washington, D.C., created for a campaign managed by advertising manager Helen Ver Standig. Most of the Wilkins advertisements followed a similar formula: two Muppets, in this case named Wilkins and Wontkins (usually both voiced by Henson), would appear. Wilkins would extol the product while Wontkins would express his hatred for it, prompting physical retaliation from Wilkins; Wontkins might be shot with a cannon, struck in the head with a hammer or baseball bat, or have a pie thrown in his face. The Jim Henson Company has posted a short selection of them. Henson later explained, &quot;Till then, advertising agencies believed that the hard sell was the only way to get their message over on television. We took a very different approach. We tried to sell things by making people laugh.&quot;

The first seven-second commercials for Wilkins were an immediate hit and were later remade for other local coffee companies throughout the United States, such as Community Coffee, Red Diamond Coffee, La Touraine Coffee, Nash&#x27;s Coffee, and Jomar Instant coffee. The characters were so successful in selling coffee that soon other companies began seeking them to promote their products, such as bakeries like Merita Breads, service station chains such as Standard Oil of Ohio and the downstream assets of Marathon Oil, and beverage bottlers such as Faygo. Over 300 &quot;Wilkins and Wontkins&quot; commercials were made. The ads were primarily produced in black and white, but some color examples also exist.

Henson sold the rights to Wilkins and Wontkins to the Wilkins Company, who allowed marketing executive John T. Brady to sell the rights to some toymakers and film studios. However, in July 1992 Brady was sued by Jim Henson Productions for unfair competition in addition to copyright and trademark infringement. The Henson company claimed that Brady was incorrectly using Henson&#x27;s name and likeness in their attempts to license the characters.

In 1963, Henson and his wife moved to New York City where the newly formed Muppets, Inc. resided for some time. Jane quit performing to raise their children, and Henson hired writer Jerry Juhl in 1961 and puppet performer Frank Oz in 1963 to replace her. Henson credited them both with developing much of the humor and character of his Muppets. Henson and Oz developed a close friendship and a performing partnership that lasted until Henson&#x27;s death; their teamwork is particularly evident in their portrayals of Bert and Ernie, Kermit and Miss Piggy, and Kermit and Fozzie Bear. In New York City, Henson formed a partnership with Bernie Brillstein, who managed Henson&#x27;s career until the puppeteer&#x27;s death. In the years that followed, more performers joined Henson&#x27;s team, including Jerry Nelson, Richard Hunt, Dave Goelz, Steve Whitmire, Fran Brill, and Kevin Clash.

In 1964 he and his family moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, where they lived until 1971, when they moved to Bedford, New York.

Henson&#x27;s talk show appearances culminated when he devised Rowlf, a piano-playing anthropomorphic dog that became the first Muppet to make regular appearances on &quot;The Jimmy Dean Show&quot;. Henson was so grateful for this break that he offered Jimmy Dean a 40-percent interest in his production company, but Dean declined, stating that Henson deserved all the rewards for his own work, a decision of conscience that Dean never regretted. From 1963 to 1966, Henson began exploring filmmaking and produced a series of experimental films. His nine-minute experimental film &quot;Time Piece&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film in 1965. He produced &quot;The Cube&quot; in 1969. Around this time, he wrote the first drafts of a live-action movie script with Jerry Juhl which became &quot;Tale of Sand&quot;. The script remained in the Henson Company archives until it was adapted in the 2012 graphic novel &quot;Jim Henson&#x27;s Tale of Sand&quot;.

During this time, Henson continued to work with various companies who sought out his Muppets for advertising purposes. Among his clients were Wilson Meats, Royal Crown Cola, Claussen&#x27;s Bread, La Choy, and Frito-Lay, which featured an early version of his character Cookie Monster to promote their Munchos line of potato snacks. Like the Wilkins Coffee ads of the late 1950s and early 1960s, the formula stayed fairly similar. For instance, one of the Claussen&#x27;s commercials featured Kermit the Frog dangling from a window while a character named Mack asks him if he brought a loaf of the company&#x27;s bread; when Kermit says he did not, Mack closes the window on Kermit&#x27;s fingers and causes him to fall, suggesting he &quot;drop down&quot; to the grocery store to buy a loaf.

===&quot;Sesame Street&quot;: 1969===
In 1969, television producer Joan Ganz Cooney and her staff at the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop were impressed by the quality and creativity of the Henson-led team, so they asked Henson and staff to work full-time on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, a children&#x27;s program for public television that premiered on National Educational Television on November 10, 1969. Part of the show was set aside for a series of funny, colorful puppet characters living on Sesame Street, including Grover, Cookie Monster, Bert and Ernie, Oscar the Grouch, and Big Bird. Henson performed the characters of Ernie, game-show host Guy Smiley, and Kermit, who appeared as a roving television news reporter.

Henson&#x27;s Muppets initially appeared separately from the realistic segments on the Street, but the show was revamped to integrate the two segments, placing much greater emphasis on Henson&#x27;s work. Cooney frequently praised Henson&#x27;s work, and PBS called him &quot;the spark that ignited our fledgling broadcast service.&quot; The success of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; also allowed him to stop producing commercials, and he said that &quot;it was a pleasure to get out of that world&quot;.

Henson was also involved in producing various shows and animation inserts during the first two seasons. He produced a series of counting films for the numbers 1 through 10 which always ended with a baker (voiced by Henson) falling down the stairs while carrying the featured number of desserts. He also worked on a variety of inserts for the numbers 2 through 12, including the films &quot;Dollhouse&quot;; &quot;Number Three Ball Film&quot;; the stop-motions &quot;King of Eight&quot; and &quot;Queen of Six&quot;; the cut-out animation &quot;Eleven Cheer&quot;; and the computer animation &quot;Nobody Counts To 10.&quot; He also directed the original &quot;C Is For Cookie&quot; and &quot;Tales from Muppetland&quot;, a short series of TV movie specials that were comic retellings of classic fairy tales aimed at a young audience and hosted by Kermit the Frog. The series included &quot;Hey, Cinderella!&quot;, &quot;The Frog Prince&quot;, and &quot;The Muppet Musicians of Bremen&quot;.

===Expansion of audience: 1970–1978===
Henson, Oz, and his team were concerned that the company was becoming typecast solely as purveyors of children&#x27;s entertainment, so they targeted an adult audience with a series of sketches on the first season of the late-night live television variety show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Eleven &quot;Land of Gorch&quot; sketches were aired between October 1975 and January 1976 on NBC, with four additional appearances in March, April, May, and September 1976. Henson liked Lorne Michaels&#x27; work and wanted to be a part of it, but he ultimately concluded that &quot;what we were trying to do and what his writers could write for it never gelled&quot;. The &quot;SNL&quot; writers were not comfortable writing for the characters, and they frequently disparaged Henson&#x27;s creations. Michael O&#x27;Donoghue quipped, &quot;I won&#x27;t write for felt.&quot;

Henson began developing a Broadway show and a weekly television series both featuring the Muppets. The American networks rejected the series in 1976, believing that Muppets would appeal only to a child audience. Then, Henson pitched the show to British impresario Lew Grade to finance the show. The show would be shot in the United Kingdom and syndicated worldwide. That same year, he scrapped plans for his Broadway show and moved his creative team to England, where &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; began taping. The show featured Kermit as host, with a variety of prominent characters, notably Miss Piggy, Gonzo the Great, and Fozzie Bear, in addition to its large cast of supporting characters such as the Muppet musicians Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem with their chaotic drummer Animal. Henson&#x27;s teammates sometimes compared his role to that of Kermit: a shy, gentle boss with &quot;a whim of steel&quot; who ran things like &quot;an explosion in a mattress factory.&quot; Caroll Spinney, who performed as Big Bird, remembered that Henson would never say he did not like something. &quot;He would just go &#x27;Hmm.&#x27; ... And if he liked it, he would say, &#x27;Lovely!&#x27;&quot; Henson recognized Kermit as an alter ego, though he thought that Kermit was bolder than he; he once said of the character: &quot;He can say things I hold back.&quot;
===Transition to the big screen: 1979–1986===
The Muppets appeared in their first theatrical feature film &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; in 1979. It was both a critical and financial success; it made $65.2 million domestically and was the 61st highest-grossing film at the time. Henson&#x27;s idol Edgar Bergen died at age 75 during production of the film, and Henson dedicated it to his memory. Henson as Kermit sang &quot;Rainbow Connection&quot;, and it hit number 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. The Henson-directed &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot; (1981) followed, and Henson decided to end the &quot;Muppet Show&quot; to concentrate on making films, though the Muppet characters continued to appear in TV movies and specials.

Henson also aided others in their work. During development on &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), George Lucas asked him to aid make-up artist Stuart Freeborn in the creation and articulation of Yoda. Lucas had also wanted Henson to puppeteer the character, but Henson instead suggested Frank Oz for the role; Oz performed the role and continued in the subsequent &quot;Star Wars&quot; films. Lucas lobbied unsuccessfully to have Oz nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

In 1982, Henson founded the Jim Henson Foundation to promote and develop the art of puppetry in the United States. Around that time, he began creating darker and more realistic fantasy films that did not feature the Muppets and displayed &quot;a growing, brooding interest in mortality.&quot; He co-directed &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; (1982) with Oz, &quot;trying to go toward a sense of realism—toward a reality of creatures that are actually alive&quot;. To provide a visual style distinct from the Muppets, the puppets in &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; were based on conceptual artwork by Brian Froud, and it was a critical success, winning several industry awards including the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film and the Grand Prize Winner at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival. The film was less financially successful in theaters, but later claimed an enormous following and revenue when it was introduced on VHS for home entertainment. Also in 1982, Henson co-founded Henson International Television with Peter Orton and Sophie Turner Laing as his partners. The company was a distribution company for children&#x27;s, teens&#x27; and family television.
Henson worked with Oz again on &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; (1984), this time with Oz as sole director. The film grossed $25.5 million domestically of a budget of only around $8 million, and ranked as one of the top 40 films of 1984.

&quot;Labyrinth&quot; (1986) was a fantasy that Henson directed by himself, but—despite some positive reviews; &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a fabulous film&quot;—it was a commercial disappointment. This demoralized Henson; his son Brian Henson described it as &quot;the closest I&#x27;ve seen him to turning in on himself and getting quite depressed.&quot; The film later became a cult classic.

In 1984 Henson traveled to Moscow, where he made a film about Sergei Obraztsov. Henson also donated four dolls to the puppeteer to replenish the Moscow Museum of Obraztsov Puppets: Fraggle, Skeksi, Bugard, and Robin the Frog. Of the show&#x27;s guests, the Henson Archivist points out that Jim Henson placed a special importance on meeting Obraztsov: &quot;As a teenager learning to make puppets, Jim checked out some books from the public library for instruction – one was Obraztsov’s 1950 book, &quot;My Profession&quot;&quot;

===Last years: 1987–1990===

Henson continued creating children&#x27;s television, such as &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; and the animated &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;. He also continued to address darker, more mature themes with the folklore and mythology-oriented show &quot;The StoryTeller&quot; (1988), which won an Emmy for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program. The next year, he returned to television with &quot;The Jim Henson Hour&quot;, which mixed lighthearted Muppet fare with more risqué material. It was critically well-received and won him another Emmy for Outstanding Directing in a Variety or Music Program, but it was canceled after 12 episodes due to poor ratings. Henson blamed its failure on NBC&#x27;s constant rescheduling.

In late 1989, Henson entered into negotiations to sell his company and characters (excluding those from &quot;Sesame Street&quot;) to The Walt Disney Company for almost $150 million, hoping that he would &quot;be able to spend a lot more of my time on the creative side of things&quot; with Disney handling business matters. By 1990, he had completed production on the television special &quot;The Muppets at Walt Disney World&quot; and the Disney-MGM Studios attraction &quot;Muppet*Vision 3D&quot; and he was developing film ideas and a television series entitled &quot;Muppet High&quot;.

==Personal life==
Henson and fellow puppeteer Jane Nebel were married on May 28, 1959, in a small ceremony at Jane&#x27;s family home. They had five children: Lisa (born 1960), Cheryl (born 1961), Brian (born 1963), John (1965–2014), and Heather Henson (born 1970). Henson and his wife separated in 1986, although they remained close for the rest of his life. Jane said that Henson was so involved with his work that he had very little time to spend with her or their children. His children began working with Muppets at an early age, partly because &quot;one of the best ways of being around him was to work with him&quot;, according to Cheryl. Henson was a strong supporter of the civil rights movement.

==Illness and death==
Henson appeared with Kermit on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; in Los Angeles on May 4, 1990. This was his final television appearance. Shortly afterwards, he privately disclosed to his publicist that he was tired and had a sore throat, but that he believed it would soon go away. On May 12, Henson traveled to Ahoskie, North Carolina, with his daughter Cheryl to visit his father and stepmother. They returned to their home in New York City the following day, and Henson cancelled a Muppet recording session that had been scheduled for May 14, 1990, due to his ill health. His wife came to visit that night.

Henson was having trouble breathing when he woke up at around 2:00 a.m. EDT on May 15, and he began coughing up blood. He suggested to his wife that he might be dying, but he did not want to take time off from his schedule to visit a hospital. Two hours later, Henson agreed to be taken by taxi to the emergency room at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. Shortly after admission, he stopped breathing and was rushed into the intensive care unit. X-ray images of his chest revealed multiple abscesses in both of his lungs as a result of a previous streptococcal pharyngitis he had apparently had for the past few days. Henson was placed on a ventilator but quickly deteriorated over the next several hours despite increasingly aggressive treatment with multiple antibiotics. Although the medicine killed off most of the infection, it had already weakened many of Henson&#x27;s organs, and he died at 1:21 a.m. the following morning. He was 53.

David Gelmont, the hospital&#x27;s intensive care unit director, announced that Henson had died from &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, a bacterium that causes bacterial pneumonia. However, on May 29, Gelmont reclassified it as organ dysfunction resulting from streptococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;. Gelmont noted Henson might have been saved had he gone to the hospital just a few hours sooner. Medical expert Lawrence D. Altman also stated that Henson&#x27;s death &quot;may have shocked many Americans who believed that bacterial infections no longer could kill with such swiftness.&quot; 
A lack of familiarity with this possibility, combined with the then-recent deaths of prominent men (including Rock Hudson, Liberace, Roy Cohn, and others) whose AIDS deaths had first been publicly euphemized as other illnesses due to AIDS&#x27;s pervasive stigma, led to a false but widespread rumor that Henson had died of AIDS — a rumor that was swiftly and directly refuted by Gelmont. Frank Oz believed the stress of negotiating with Disney contributed to Henson&#x27;s death, stating in a 2021 interview: &quot;The Disney deal is probably what killed Jim. It made him sick.&quot; His remains were cremated, and in 1992, his ashes were scattered near Taos, New Mexico.

===Memorials===

News of Henson&#x27;s death spread quickly and admirers of his work responded from around the world with tributes and condolences. Many of Henson&#x27;s co-stars and directors from &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, the Muppets, and other works also shared their thoughts on his death. On May 21, 1990, Henson&#x27;s public memorial service was conducted in Manhattan at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. Another was conducted on July 2, at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London. Harry Belafonte sang &quot;Turn the World Around&quot;, a song that he had debuted on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, as each member of the congregation waved a brightly colored foam butterfly attached to a puppet performer&#x27;s rod. Later, Big Bird (performed by Caroll Spinney) walked onto the stage and sang Kermit&#x27;s signature song &quot;Bein&#x27; Green&quot; while fighting back tears. Dave Goelz, Frank Oz, Kevin Clash, Steve Whitmire, Jerry Nelson, and Richard Hunt sang a medley of Henson&#x27;s favorite songs in their characters&#x27; voices, ending with a performance of &quot;Just One Person&quot; while performing their Muppets.

In accordance with Henson&#x27;s wishes, no one in attendance wore black, and the Dirty Dozen Brass Band finished the service by performing &quot;When the Saints Go Marching In&quot;. The funeral was described by &quot;Life&quot; as &quot;an epic and almost unbearably moving event&quot;.

==Legacy==
The Jim Henson Company and the Jim Henson Foundation continued after his death, producing new series and specials. Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop also continues to create characters and special effects for both Henson-related and outside projects. Steve Whitmire, who had joined the Muppets cast in 1978, began performing Kermit the Frog six months after Henson&#x27;s death. He was dismissed from the cast in October 2016, and Matt Vogel succeeded him in the role of Kermit.

The Children&#x27;s Television Workshop was renamed Sesame Workshop, which retained the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; characters in 2000. On February 17, 2004, the Muppets and the &quot;Bear in the Big Blue House&quot; properties were sold to Disney.

One of Henson&#x27;s last projects was the attraction &quot;Muppet*Vision 3D&quot;, which opened at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios on May 16, 1991, exactly one year after his death. The Jim Henson Company retains the Creature Shop as well as the rest of its film and television library, including &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;, &quot;Farscape&quot;, &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;, and &quot;Labyrinth&quot;. Brian Jay Jones wrote the book &quot;Jim Henson: The Biography.&quot; It was released on what would have been Henson&#x27;s 77th birthday, September 24, 2013.

The moving-image collection of Jim Henson, which contains the film work of Jim Henson and The Jim Henson Company, is held at the Academy Film Archive.

In 2019, the YouTube channel Defunctland released a six-part miniseries on the life and legacy of Jim Henson.

A biopic film based on Henson&#x27;s life, known as &quot;Muppet Man&quot;, has been in development at Walt Disney Pictures and The Jim Henson Company since 2010. In April 2021, it was reported that Michael Mitnick was hired to rewrite the screenplay, previously written by Aaron and Jordan Kandell. Lisa Henson will serve as producer.

In March 2022, it was announced that Ron Howard planned to direct a documentary on Henson&#x27;s life, with Brian Grazer&#x27;s Imagine Entertainment collaborating with Disney Original Documentary to produce it. The project was reported to have &quot;the full participation and cooperation of the Henson family&quot;. In April 2024, it was announced the documentary was titled &quot;Jim Henson Idea Man&quot;. It began streaming on Disney+ on May 31, 2024.

In 2024, Henson was portrayed by Nicholas Braun in the biographical dramedy &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, which chronicles the production of the first episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

Henson&#x27;s characters are currently performed by the following puppeteers: Matt Vogel (Kermit), Peter Linz (Ernie, Link Hogthrob), Eric Jacobson (Guy Smiley, The Newsman), Dave Goelz (Waldorf) and Bill Barretta (Rowlf the Dog, The Swedish Chef, Dr. Teeth).

<doc id="16229" wikidata="Q178805" url="?curid=16229" title="Joystick">
<text>A joystick, sometimes called a flight stick, is an input device consisting of a stick that pivots on a base and reports its angle or direction to the device it is controlling. Also known as the control column, it is the principal control device in the cockpit of many civilian and military aircraft, either as a centre stick or side-stick. It has various switches to control functions of the aircraft controlled by the Pilot and First Officer of the flight.

Joysticks are often used to control video games, and usually have push-buttons whose state can be read by the computer. A popular variation of the joystick used on modern video game consoles is the analog stick. Joysticks are also used for controlling machines such as cranes, trucks, underwater unmanned vehicles, wheelchairs, surveillance cameras, and zero turning radius lawn mowers. Miniature finger-operated joysticks have been adopted as input devices for smaller electronic equipment such as mobile phones.

== Aviation ==
Joysticks originated as controls for aircraft ailerons and elevators, and are first known to have been used as such on Louis Bleriot&#x27;s Bleriot VIII aircraft of 1908, in combination with a foot-operated rudder bar for the yaw control surface on the tail.

== Origins ==
The name &quot;joystick&quot; is thought to originate with early 20th century French pilot Robert Esnault-Pelterie. There are also competing claims on behalf of fellow pilots Robert Loraine, James Henry Joyce, and A. E. George. Loraine is cited by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; for using the term &quot;joystick&quot; in his diary in 1909 when he went to Pau to learn to fly at Blériot&#x27;s school. George was a pioneer aviator who with his colleague Jobling built and flew a biplane at Newcastle in England in 1910. The George and Jobling aircraft control column is in the collection of the Discovery Museum in Newcastle upon Tyne, England.
Joysticks were present in early planes, though their mechanical origins are uncertain. The coining of the term &quot;joystick&quot; may actually be credited to Loraine, as his is the earliest known usage of the term, although he most certainly did not invent the device.

==Electronic joysticks==
===History===
The electrical two-axis joystick was invented by C. B. Mirick at the United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and patented in 1926 (U.S. Patent no. 1,597,416)&quot;. NRL was actively developing remote controlled aircraft at the time and the joystick was possibly used to support this effort. In the awarded patent, Mirick writes: &quot;My control system is particularly applicable in maneuvering aircraft without a pilot.&quot;

The Germans developed an electrical two-axis joystick around 1944. The device was used as part of the Germans&#x27; &quot;Funkgerät&quot; FuG 203 &quot;Kehl&quot; radio control transmitter system used in certain German bomber aircraft, used to guide both the rocket-boosted anti-ship missile &quot;Henschel Hs 293&quot;, and the unpowered pioneering precision-guided munition &quot;Fritz-X&quot;, against maritime and other targets. Here, the joystick of the &quot;Kehl&quot; transmitter was used by an operator to steer the missile towards its target. This joystick had on-off switches rather than analogue sensors. Both the Hs 293 and Fritz-X used FuG 230 &quot;Straßburg&quot; radio receivers in them to send the &quot;Kehl&#x27;s&quot; control signals to the ordnance&#x27;s control surfaces. A comparable joystick unit was used for the contemporary American Azon steerable munition, strictly to laterally steer the munition in the yaw axis only.

This German invention was picked up by someone in the team of scientists assembled at the &quot;Heeresversuchsanstalt&quot; in Peenemünde. Here a part of the team on the German rocket program was developing the Wasserfall missile, a variant of the V-2 rocket, the first ground-to-air missile. The Wasserfall steering equipment converted the electrical signal to radio signals and transmitted these to the missile.
In the 1960s the use of joysticks became widespread in radio-controlled model aircraft systems such as the Kwik Fly produced by Phill Kraft (1964). The now-defunct Kraft Systems firm eventually became an important OEM supplier of joysticks to the computer industry and other users. The first use of joysticks outside the radio-controlled aircraft industry may have been in the control of powered wheelchairs, such as the Permobil (1963). During this time period NASA used joysticks as control devices as part of the Apollo missions. For example, the lunar lander test models were controlled with a joystick.

In many modern airliners, for example all Airbus aircraft developed from the 1980s, the joystick has received a new lease on life for flight control in the form of the &quot;side-stick&quot;, a controller similar to a gaming joystick but which is used to control flight, replacing the traditional yoke. The sidestick saves weight, improves movement and visibility in the cockpit, and may be safer in an accident than the yoke.

===Electronic games===
Ralph H. Baer, inventor of the Magnavox Odyssey console, released in 1972, created the first video game joysticks in 1967. They were able to control the horizontal and vertical position of a spot displayed on a screen. The earliest known electronic game joystick with a fire button was released by Sega as part of their 1969 arcade game &quot;Missile&quot;, a shooter simulation game that used it as part of an early dual-control scheme, where two directional buttons are used to move a motorized tank and a two-way joystick is used to shoot and steer the missile onto oncoming planes displayed on the screen; when a plane is hit, an explosion is animated on screen along with an explosion sound. In 1970, the game was released in North America as &quot;S.A.M.I.&quot; by Midway Games.

Taito released a four-way joystick as part of their arcade racing video game &quot;Astro Race&quot; in 1973, while their 1975 multidirectional shooter &quot;Western Gun&quot; introduced dual-stick controls with one eight-way joystick for movement and the other for changing the shooting direction. In North America, it was released by Midway under the title &quot;Gun Fight&quot;. In 1976, Taito released &quot;Interceptor&quot;, an early first-person combat flight simulator that involved piloting a jet fighter, using an eight-way joystick to aim with a crosshair and shoot at enemy aircraft.

The Atari CX40 joystick, developed for the 1977 Atari Video Computer System, is a digital controller with a single fire button. The Atari joystick port was for many years the &quot;de facto&quot; standard digital joystick specification. Joysticks were commonly used as controllers in first and second generation game consoles, but they gave way to the familiar game pad with the Nintendo Entertainment System and Master System during the mid-1980s, though joysticks—especially arcade-style ones—were and are popular after-market add-ons for any console.

In 1985, Sega&#x27;s third-person arcade rail shooter game &quot;Space Harrier&quot; featured a true analog flight stick, used for movement. The joystick could register movement in any direction as well as measure the degree of push, which could move the player character at different speeds depending on how far the joystick was pushed in a certain direction.

A variation of the joystick is the rotary joystick. It is a type of joystick-knob hybrid, where the joystick can be moved in various direction while at the same time being able to rotate the joystick. It is mainly used in arcade shoot &#x27;em up games, to control both the player&#x27;s eight-directional movement and the gun&#x27;s 360-degree direction. It was introduced by SNK, initially with the tank shooter &quot;TNK III&quot; (1985) before it was popularized by the run and gun video game &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot; (1986). SNK later used rotary joystick controls in arcade games such as &quot;Guerrilla War&quot; (1987).

A distinct variation of an analog joystick is a positional gun, which works differently from a light gun. Instead of using light sensors, a positional gun is essentially an analog joystick mounted in a fixed location that records the position of the gun to determine where the player is aiming on the screen. It is often used for arcade gun games, with early examples including Sega&#x27;s &quot;Sea Devil&quot; in 1972; Taito&#x27;s &quot;Attack&quot; in 1976; &quot;Cross Fire&quot; in 1977; and Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Battle Shark&quot; in 1978.

During the 1990s, joysticks such as the CH Products Flightstick, Gravis Phoenix, Microsoft SideWinder, Logitech WingMan, and Thrustmaster FCS were in demand with PC gamers. They were considered a prerequisite for flight simulators such as &quot;F-16 Fighting Falcon&quot; and &quot;LHX Attack Chopper&quot;. Joysticks became especially popular with the mainstream success of space flight simulator games like &quot;X-Wing&quot; and &quot;Wing Commander&quot;, as well as the &quot;Six degrees of freedom&quot; 3D shooter &quot;Descent&quot;. VirPil Controls&#x27; MongoosT-50 joystick was designed to mimic the style of Russian aircraft (including the Sukhoi Su-35 and Sukhoi Su-57), unlike most flight joysticks.

However, since the beginning of the 21st century, these types of games have waned in popularity and are now considered a &quot;dead&quot; genre, and with that, gaming joysticks have been reduced to niche products. In NowGamer&#x27;s interview with Jim Boone, a producer at Volition Inc., he stated that &quot;FreeSpace 2&quot;″s poor sales could have been due to joysticks&#x27; being sold poorly because they were &quot;going out of fashion&quot; because more modern first-person shooters, such as &quot;Quake&quot;, were &quot;very much about the mouse and [the] keyboard&quot;. He went further on to state &quot;Before that, when we did &quot;Descent&quot; for example, it was perfectly common for people to have joysticks – we sold a lot of copies of Descent. It was around that time [when] the more modern FPS with mouse and keyboard came out, as opposed to just keyboard like &quot;Wolfenstein [3D]&quot; or something.&quot;.

Since the late 1990s, &quot;analog sticks&quot; (or &quot;thumbsticks&quot;, due to their being controlled by one&#x27;s thumbs) have become standard on controllers for video game consoles, popularized by Nintendo&#x27;s Nintendo 64 controller, and have the ability to indicate the stick&#x27;s displacement from its neutral position. This means that the software does not have to keep track of the position or estimate the speed at which the controls are moved. These devices usually use potentiometers to determine the position of the stick, though some newer models instead use a Hall effect sensor for greater reliability and reduced size.

In 1997, ThrustMaster, Inc. introduced a 3D programmable controller, which was integrated into computer games to experience flight simulations. This line adapted several aspects of NASA&#x27;s RHC (Rotational Hand Controller), which is used for landing and navigation methods.

In 1997 the first gaming joystick with force feedback (haptics) was manufactured by CH Products under license from technology creator, Immersion Corporation. The product, called the Force FX joystick was followed by force feedback joysticks from Logitech, Thrustmaster, and others, also under license from Immersion.

===Arcade sticks===

An arcade stick is a large-format controller for use with home consoles or computers. They use the stick-and-button configuration of some arcade cabinets, such as those with particular multi-button arrangements. For example, the six button layout of the arcade games &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; or &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; cannot be comfortably emulated on a console joypad, so licensed home arcade sticks for these games have been manufactured for home consoles and PCs.

===Hat switch===

A hat switch is a control on some joysticks. It is also known as a POV (point of view) switch in electronic games, where it allows one to look around in one&#x27;s virtual world, browse menus, etc. For example, many flight simulators use it to switch the player&#x27;s views, while other games sometimes use it as a substitute for the D-pad. Computer gamepads with both an analogue stick and a D-pad usually assign POV switch scancodes to the latter.

The term hat switch is a shortening of the term &quot;coolie hat switch&quot;, named for the similar looking headgear.

In a real aircraft, the hat switch may control things like aileron or elevator trim.

Apart from buttons, wheels and dials as well as touchscreens also miniature joysticks have been established for the efficient manual operation of cameras.

== Industrial applications ==
In recent times, the employment of joysticks has become commonplace in many industrial and manufacturing applications, such as cranes, assembly lines, forestry equipment, mining trucks, and excavators. In fact, the use of such joysticks is in such high demand, that it has virtually replaced the traditional mechanical control lever in nearly all modern hydraulic control systems. Additionally, most unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and submersible remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) require at least one joystick to control either the vehicle, the on-board cameras, sensors and/or manipulators.

Due to the highly hands-on, rough nature of such applications, the industrial joystick tends to be more robust than the typical video-game controller, and able to function over a high cycle life. This led to the development and employment of Hall effect sensing to such applications in the 1980s as a means of contactless sensing. Several companies produce joysticks for industrial applications using Hall effect technology. Another technology used in joystick design is the use of strain gauges to build force transducers from which the output is proportional to the force applied rather than physical deflection. Miniature force transducers are used as additional controls on joysticks for menu selection functions.

Some larger manufacturers of joysticks are able to customize joystick handles and grips specific to the OEM needs while small regional manufacturers often concentrate on selling standard products at higher prices to smaller OEMs.

== Assistive technology ==

Specialist joysticks, classed as an assistive technology pointing device, are used to replace the computer mouse for people with fairly severe physical disabilities. Rather than controlling games, these joysticks control the pointer. They are often useful to people with athetoid conditions, such as cerebral palsy, who find them easier to grasp than a standard mouse. Miniature joysticks are available for people with conditions involving muscular weakness such as muscular dystrophy or motor neurone disease as well. They are also used on electric powered wheelchairs for control since they are simple and effective to use as a control method.

== Non-human use ==
In 1996, a scientific study established that both chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys could be taught to move a pointer on a screen by using a joystick. Both have consistently managed to demonstrate &quot;conceptual knowledge&quot; of the task required of them during trials, although rhesus monkeys were notably slower to do so.

In 2021, another pair of researchers investigated the level of intelligence in domestic pigs by designing a joystick which could be controlled with their snout. Unlike the chimpanzees or the rhesus monkeys, none of the four pigs was able to fully meet the 1996&#x27;s test criteria for &quot;motoric or conceptual acquisition&quot; of the task, but they still performed &quot;significantly above chance&quot;. Notably, the pigs experienced additional difficulties in comparison to the primates, as they were all far-sighted and so may have struggled with the details on screen, and they could not move the target with a joystick without taking their eyes off the screen first.

<doc id="16232" wikidata="Q156325" url="?curid=16232" title="Juan Fernández Islands">
<text>The Juan Fernández Islands () are a sparsely inhabited series of islands in the South Pacific Ocean reliant on tourism and fishing. Situated off the coast of Chile, they are composed of three main volcanic islands: Robinson Crusoe, Alejandro Selkirk and Santa Clara. The group is part of Insular Chile.

The islands are primarily known for having been the home to the marooned sailor Alexander Selkirk for more than four years from 1704, which may have inspired English writer Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;. Most of the archipelago&#x27;s present-day inhabitants reside on Robinson Crusoe Island, and mainly in the capital, San Juan Bautista, located at Cumberland Bay on the island&#x27;s north coast.

The group of islands is part of Chile&#x27;s Valparaíso Region (which also includes Easter Island) and, along with the Desventuradas Islands, forms one of the nine communes of Valparaíso Province. The islands are named after Juan Fernández, the explorer who discovered them in the 1570s.

==Geography==
* Robinson Crusoe Island (), also known as Isla Más a Tierra, is located closest to the mainland of continental South America, and is surrounded by a number of islets, including Juanango, Viñilla, Los Chamelos, Los Claveles and El Verdugo.
** Santa Clara (), lying southwest of Robinson Crusoe.
* Alejandro Selkirk Island (), also known as Isla Más Afuera, is located farther west.

Alejandro Selkirk is the largest of the Juan Fernández Islands at , and its highest peak, Cerro de Los Inocentes, is also the highest point of the archipelago at . The island&#x27;s population was 57 in 2012. Robinson Crusoe is the second-largest island in the archipelago at ; its highest peak, El Yunque, is . The population of Robinson Crusoe was 843 in 2012. Santa Clara is in area and reaches a height of . Santa Clara is uninhabited. The maximum elevations of Juan Fernández, for Robinson Crusoe and for Alejandro Selkirk, respectively, are high enough to cause the phenomenon known as Kármán vortex street, which can be seen from space.

The islands are volcanic in origin, produced by the movement of the Nazca Plate over the Juan Fernández hotspot. As the plate moved eastward over the hot spot, volcanic eruptions formed the Juan Fernández Ridge before being subducted under the South American continent at the Peru–Chile Trench. The islands occur where the peaks of the submarine ridge have protruded above sea level. Radiometric dating indicates that Santa Clara is the oldest of the islands, at 5.8 million years old, followed by Robinson Crusoe, 3.8 – 4.2 million years old, and Alexander Selkirk, 1.0 – 2.4 million years old.

The seafloor around Juan Fernández Islands is rich in Manganese–Iron nodules, which might be of potential economic interest.

Some consider the islands to be one of the easternmost points of Oceania, rather than an outlying region of South America. In their book &quot;Shore Fishes of Easter Island&quot;, authors John E. Randall and Alfredo Cea Egana claim that the Juan Fernández Islands have &quot;great similarity in ichthyofauna with Oceania more so than with the nearing South America.&quot;

==Climate==
The archipelago is very diverse in climate taking into account its size, this is due to factors such as its topography which causes the temperature and precipitation regime to change depending on the area of an island. In the Archipelago according to Trewartha&#x27;s climate classification the windward slopes have a subtropical climate, while areas such as the eastern tip of Robinson Crusoe Island have a Semi-arid climate and the western and leeward areas have a Mediterranean climate. The weather is moderated by the cold Humboldt Current, which flows northward to the east of the islands, and the southeast trade winds. Temperatures range from to , with an annual mean of . Higher elevations are generally cooler, with occasional frosts on Robinson Crusoe.

Average annual precipitation is , varying from to year to year. Much of the variability in rainfall depends on the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. Rainfall is higher in the winter months, and varies with elevation and exposure; elevations above experience almost daily rainfall, while the western, leeward side of Robinson Crusoe and Santa Clara are quite dry.

==Biota and ecology==

The Juan Fernández islands are home to a high percentage of rare and endemic plants and animals, and are recognized as a distinct ecoregion. The volcanic origin and remote location of the islands meant that the islands&#x27; flora and fauna had to reach the archipelago from far across the sea; as a result, the island is home to relatively few plant species and very few animal species. The closest relatives of the archipelago&#x27;s plants and animals are found in the Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests ecoregions of southern South America, including the Valdivian temperate rain forests, Magellanic subpolar forests, and Desventuradas Islands.

===Flora===
There are 209 native species of vascular plants in the Juan Fernandez Islands, approximately 150 of which are flowering plants, and 50 are ferns. There are 126 species (62 percent) that are endemic, with 12 endemic genera and two endemic families, Lactoridaceae and Thyrsopteridaceae. Many plants are characteristic of the Antarctic flora, and are related to plants found in southern South America, New Zealand and Australia. Vegetation zones generally correspond to elevation, with grasslands and shrublands at lower elevations, tall and montane forests at middle elevations, and shrublands at the highest elevations. The two main islands have somewhat distinct plant communities.

Alejandro Selkirk is mostly covered with grassland from 0 to , interspersed with wooded ravines &quot;(quebradas)&quot;. Lower montane forests occur between , with upper montane forest from . &quot;Myrceugenia schulzei&quot; is the predominant tree in the dry low-elevation &quot;quebrada&quot; forests and in lower montane forests. &quot;Fagara externa&quot; was historically abundant in lower montane forest but is now scarce. The treeline is at approximately , above which is alpine shrubland and grassland, dominated by temperate Magellanic vegetation such as &quot;Acaena, Dicksonia, Drimys, Empetrum, Gunnera, Myrteola, Pernettya&quot;, and &quot;Ugni&quot;.

On Robinson Crusoe, grasslands predominate from sea level to ; introduced shrubs from ; tall forests from ; montane forests from , with dense tree cover of &quot;Cuminia fernandezia, Zanthoxylum mayu&quot;, and &quot;Rhaphithamnus venustus&quot;; tree fern forests from , and brushwood forests above . Santa Clara is covered with grassland.

Three endemic species dominate the tall and lower montane forests of the archipelago, &quot;Drimys confertifolia&quot; on both main islands, &quot;Nothomyrcia fernandeziana&quot; on Robinson Crusoe, and &quot;M. schulzei&quot; on Alexander Selkirk. Endemic tree fern species of southern hemisphere genus &quot;Dicksonia&quot; (&quot;D. berteroana&quot; on Robinson Crusoe and &quot;D. externa&quot; on Alexander Selkirk) and the endemic genus &quot;Thyrsopteris&quot; &quot;(T. elegans)&quot; are the predominant species in the tree-fern forests. An endemic species of sandalwood, &quot;Santalum fernandezianum&quot;, was overexploited for its fragrant wood, has not been seen since 1908, and is believed extinct. The Chonta palm (&quot;Juania australis&quot;), which is endemic to the Juan Fernández Islands, is endangered.

===Fauna===
The Juan Fernández Islands have a very limited fauna, with no native land mammals, reptiles, or amphibians. Seventeen land and sea-bird species breed on the islands. The island has three endemic bird species, and three endemic subspecies. Introduced fauna by humans include rats and goats. Robinson Crusoe Island is home to an endemic and endangered hummingbird, the Juan Fernández firecrown (&quot;Sephanoides fernandensis&quot;). This large hummingbird, about long, is thought to number only about 500 individuals. The other endemic bird species are the Juan Fernández tit-tyrant (&quot;Anairetes fernandezianus&quot;) of Robinson Crusoe Island, and the Masafuera rayadito (&quot;Aphrastura masafuerae&quot;) of Alejandro Selkirk Island. The islands support the entire known breeding populations of two petrel species, Stejneger&#x27;s Petrel &quot;Pterodroma longirostris&quot; (IUCN status VU) and the Juan Fernandez Petrel &quot;Pterodroma externa&quot; (IUCN status VU). In addition, the Juan Fernandez Islands may still support a third breeding petrel species, De Filippi&#x27;s Petrel &quot;Pterodroma defilippiana&quot; (IUCN status VU), whose only other known breeding grounds are on the Desventuradas Islands. The Magellanic penguin breeds on Robinson Crusoe Island within the archipelago. All three islands of the Juan Fernandez archipelago have been recognised as Important Bird Areas (IBAs) by BirdLife International.

The endemic Juan-Fernandez spiny lobster (without claws) lives in the marine waters (&quot;Jasus frontalis&quot;). The Juan Fernández fur seal (&quot;Arctophoca philippii&quot;) also lives on the islands. This species was nearly exterminated in the sixteenth to nineteenth century, but it was rediscovered in 1965. A census in 1970 found about 750 fur seals living there. Only two were sighted on the Desventuradas Islands, located some to the north. The actual population of the Desventuradas may be higher, because the species tends to hide in sea caves. There seems to be a yearly population increase of 16–17 percent.

==History==
===Prehistory===
A 2008 report by archaeologists from the Australian National University states that, &quot;a combination of palaeoecology and archaeology in the Juan Fernández Islands showed it was unlikely there had been human activity in the islands before Europeans arrived.&quot; Ichthyologists Ingo Hahn and Uwe Römer wrote in 2002, &quot;the geographically isolated Juan Fernández Islands were probably untouched by man until their discovery by European sailors in 1574. Polynesians did not reach further east than Easter Island and native Americans perhaps not west of the South American continent.&quot;

===Discovery===
The archipelago was discovered on 22 November 1574, by the Spanish sailor Juan Fernández, who was sailing south between Callao and Valparaíso along a route which he also discovered, hundreds of miles west of the coast of Chile, which avoided the northerly Humboldt current. He called the islands Más Afuera, Más a Tierra, and Santa Clara.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, the islands were used as a hideout for pirates and became the location of a penal colony. It was during this period that Alexander Selkirk became marooned on the islands. In the 1740s, they were visited by Commodore Anson&#x27;s flotilla during his ill-fated venture to the South Seas. The location of the archipelago was fixed by Alessandro Malaspina in 1790; previous charts had differed on the location. British and American whaling vessels were regular visitors to the islands, starting with the &quot;London&quot; (Captain Joshua Coffin) in 1795.

During the maritime fur trade era of the early 19th century the islands were a source of fur seal skins, and the Juan Fernández fur seal was nearly driven to extinction. In his book &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; (Chapter VII), Richard Henry Dana Jr. described the islands as he found them circa 1834. At this time the main island was being used as a penal colony. However, when Dr John Coulter visited it in the early 1840s, he reported the island deserted after the approximately 1000 convicts had risen up, killing the soldiers and Governor who had held them captive. The prisoners fled to mainland Chile, where &quot;great numbers&quot; were later hunted down and shot. The story appears in Coulter&#x27;s book &quot;Adventures in the Pacific&quot; (1845). On 6 May 1846, a ship carrying Mormon missionaries visited the archipelago, re-stocking before travelling onward. During their stop, they buried the body a pregnant woman, Laura Graham, who had died during a storm.

In 1908, the islands were visited by the Swedish Magellanic Expedition and Carl Skottsberg is believed to have been the last to have seen the &quot;Santalum fernandezianum&quot; tree alive.

Late in 1914 the islands were the rendezvous for Admiral Maximilian von Spee&#x27;s East Asia Squadron as he gathered his ships together before defeating the British under Admiral Christopher Cradock at the Battle of Coronel. Following the Royal Navy&#x27;s win at the Battle of the Falkland Islands a month later, the only surviving German cruiser, , was hunted down and cornered illegally at Más a Tierra early in 1915, although she was in Chilean territorial waters, where it was scuttled after a brief battle with British cruisers.

In 1966 the Chilean government renamed Más Afuera as Alejandro Selkirk Island and Más a Tierra as Robinson Crusoe Island, in order to promote tourism. Incidentally, Selkirk never set foot on Más Afuera, only on Más a Tierra. On 30 July 2007, a constitutional reform gave the Juan Fernández Islands and Easter Island the status of &quot;special territories&quot; of Chile. Pending the enactment of a charter the archipelago will continue to be governed as a commune of the Valparaíso Region.

On 27 February 2010, a tsunami following the 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Maule, Chile struck the islands causing at least 8 deaths. Eleven people were reported as missing. Some early reports described the tsunami as being high, but later reports measured it at . Most of the town of San Juan Bautista on Robinson Crusoe Island was destroyed.

==Government==

As a commune, the Juan Fernández Islands are a third-level administrative division of Chile governed by a municipal council, headed by a mayor () who is directly elected every four years. The current mayor for the term 2021–2024 is Pablo Andrés Manríquez Angulo.

Within the electoral divisions of Chile, the commune was represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Joaquín Godoy (RN) and Aldo Cornejo (PDC) as part of the 13th electoral district, together with Valparaíso and Easter Island. It was represented in the Senate by Francisco Chahuán Chahuán (RN) and Ricardo Lagos Weber (PPD) as part of the 6th senatorial constituency (Valparaíso-Coast).

== Women&#x27;s rights ==
Advocacy for women in the islands is led by the Juan Fernandez Women&#x27;s Group.

== Religion ==
A Mormon church was established in the islands in the 1980s.

==Travel==
The islands are served by Robinson Crusoe Airfield, located on Robinson Crusoe Island.

<text>John Maynard Smith (6 January 1920 – 19 April 2004) was a British theoretical and mathematical evolutionary biologist and geneticist. Originally an aeronautical engineer during the Second World War, he took a second degree in genetics under the biologist J. B. S. Haldane. Maynard Smith was instrumental in the application of game theory to evolution with George R. Price, and theorised on other problems such as the evolution of sex and signalling theory.

==Biography==

===Early years===
John Maynard Smith was born in London, the son of the surgeon Sidney Maynard Smith, but following his father&#x27;s death in 1928, the family moved to Exmoor, where he became interested in natural history. Quite unhappy with the lack of formal science education at Eton College, Maynard Smith took it upon himself to develop an interest in Darwinian evolutionary theory and mathematics, after having read the work of old Etonian J. B. S. Haldane, whose books were in the school&#x27;s library despite the bad reputation Haldane had at Eton for his communism. He became an atheist at age 14.

On leaving school, Maynard Smith joined the Communist Party of Great Britain and started studying engineering at Trinity College, Cambridge. When the Second World War broke out in 1939, he defied his party&#x27;s line and volunteered for service. He was rejected, however, because of poor eyesight and was told to finish his engineering degree, which he did in 1941. He later quipped that &quot;under the circumstances, my poor eyesight was a selective advantage—it stopped me getting shot&quot;. The year of his graduation, he married Sheila Matthew, and they later had two sons and one daughter (Tony, Carol, and Julian). Between 1942 and 1947, he applied his degree to military aircraft design.

===Second degree===
Maynard Smith, having decided that aircraft were &quot;noisy and old-fashioned&quot;, then took a change of career, entering University College London to study fruit fly genetics under Haldane. After graduating he became a lecturer in zoology at his alma mater between 1952 and 1965, where he directed the &quot;Drosophila&quot; lab and conducted research on population genetics. He published a popular Penguin book, &quot;The Theory of Evolution&quot;, in 1958 (with subsequent editions in 1966, 1975, 1993).

He became gradually less attracted to communism and became a less active member, finally leaving the party in 1956 like many other intellectuals, after the Soviet Union brutally suppressed the Hungarian Revolution (Haldane had left the party in 1950 after becoming similarly disillusioned). He also admitted that a research program in evolutionary biology explicitly informed by Marxism seemed to bear little fruit.

===University of Sussex===
In 1962 he was one of the founding members of the University of Sussex and was a dean between 1965 and 1985. He subsequently became a professor emeritus. Prior to his death the building housing much of life sciences at Sussex was renamed the John Maynard Smith Building in his honour.

===&quot;Evolution and the Theory of Games&quot;===
In 1973 Maynard Smith formalised a central concept in evolutionary game theory called the evolutionarily stable strategy, based on a verbal argument by George R. Price. This area of research culminated in his 1982 book &quot;Evolution and the Theory of Games&quot;. The Hawk-Dove game is arguably his single most influential game theoretical model.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1977. In 1986 he was awarded the Darwin Medal.

===Evolution of sex and other major transitions in evolution===
Maynard Smith published a book titled &quot;The Evolution of Sex&quot; which explored in mathematical terms, the notion of the &quot;two-fold cost of sex&quot;. During the late 1980s he also became interested in evolutionary transitions in individuality (ETIs) and worked with the evolutionary biologist Eörs Szathmáry. Together they wrote an influential 1995 book &quot;The Major Transitions in Evolution&quot;, a seminal work which continues to contribute to ongoing issues in evolutionary biology. A popular science version of the book, &quot;The Origins of Life: From the birth of life to the origin of language&quot;, was published in 1999.

In 1991 he was awarded the Balzan Prize for genetics and evolution &quot;for his powerful analysis of evolutionary theory and of the role of sexual reproduction as a critical factor in evolution and in the survival of species; for his mathematical models applying the theory of games to evolutionary problems&quot; (motivation of the Balzan General Prize Committee). In 1995 he was awarded the Linnean Medal by the Linnean Society and in 1999 he was awarded the Crafoord Prize jointly with Ernst Mayr and George C. Williams. In 2001 he was awarded the Kyoto Prize.

In his honour the European Society for Evolutionary Biology has an award for extraordinary young evolutionary biology researchers named &quot;The John Maynard Smith Prize&quot;.

===&quot;Animal Signals&quot;===
His final book, &quot;Animal Signals&quot;, co-authored with David Harper, on signalling theory was published in 2003.

===Death===
He died on 19 April 2004 sitting in a chair at home, surrounded by books. He was survived by his wife Sheila and their children.

=== Controversy ===
Another evolutionary biologist, William Donald Hamilton, harboured a grievance against Maynard Smith for his handling of an article that Hamilton submitted to &quot;The Journal of Theoretical Biology&quot; in 1963, which was eventually published as two papers in July 1964. Maynard Smith acted as a reviewer of the paper after two other reviewers had been unable to understand it, and requested that Hamilton revise it into two parts due to concerns about its accessibility, later describing it as &quot;deeply obscure&quot;. In March 1964, Maynard Smith published the article &quot;Group Selection and Kin selection&quot; in &quot;Nature&quot;, which covered concepts from Hamilton&#x27;s article. Although Maynard Smith cited an earlier paper by Hamilton published in the &quot;American Naturalist&quot;, Hamilton felt Maynard Smith had not given him sufficient credit. Hamilton also objected to an anecdote included by Maynard Smith in a review published in the &quot;New Scientist&quot; in 1976 which implied Maynard Smith&#x27;s mentor Haldane had understood the concept of Hamilton&#x27;s inclusive fitness in the 1950s. Hamilton replied to the review suggesting that the anecdote was false, but later apologised to Maynard Smith for having doubted it&quot;.&quot;

==Legacy==

<text>John Claggett Danforth (born September 5, 1936) is an American politician, attorney, diplomat, and Episcopal priest who served as the Attorney General of Missouri from 1969 to 1976 and as a United States Senator from 1976 to 1995. A member of the Republican Party, he later served as Special Counsel for the U.S. Department of Justice from 1999 to 2000 and as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations from 2004 to 2005.

Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Danforth graduated from Princeton University and Yale University. George W. Bush considered selecting him as a vice-presidential running mate in 2000.

==Early life and education==
Danforth was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Dorothy (Claggett) and Donald Danforth. He is the grandson of William H. Danforth, founder of Ralston Purina. Danforth&#x27;s brother, William Henry Danforth, was former chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis.

Danforth attended St. Louis Country Day School and Princeton University, where he graduated with an A.B. in religion in 1958 after completing a 111-page senior thesis titled &quot;Christ and Meaning: An Interpretation of Reinhold Niebuhr&#x27;s Christology.&quot; He received degrees from Yale Law School and Yale Divinity School in 1963.

== Career ==
Danforth practiced law at the New York law firm Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell from 1964 to 1966. He was a partner at the law firm of Bryan, Cave, McPheeters and McRoberts in St. Louis from 1966 to 1968.

Before Danforth entered Republican politics, Missouri was a reliably Democratic state with its U.S. senators and governors usually being Democrats. Danforth&#x27;s seat in the Senate was previously held by Democrats Thomas Hart Benton, Harry S. Truman, and Stuart Symington.

===Missouri Attorney General===
In 1968, Danforth was elected Missouri Attorney General, the first Republican elected to the office in 40 years, and the first from his party elected to statewide office in 22 years. On his staff of assistant attorneys general were future Missouri Governor and U.S. Senator Kit Bond, future Missouri Governor, U.S. Senator and U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft, future Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, and future federal judge D. Brook Bartlett. Danforth was reelected in 1972.

===United States Senate===
====Elections====
In 1970, Danforth ran for the United States Senate for the first time, against Democratic incumbent Stuart Symington. He lost in a close race.

In 1976, Danforth ran to succeed Symington, who was retiring. He had little opposition in the Republican primary. The Democrats had a three-way battle among Symington&#x27;s son James W. Symington, former Missouri Governor Warren Hearnes, and rising political star Congressman Jerry Litton. Litton won the primary, but he and his family were killed when the plane taking them to their victory party in Kansas City crashed on takeoff in Chillicothe, Missouri. Hearnes, who had finished second in the primary, was chosen to replace Litton as the Democratic nominee. In the general election, Danforth defeated Hearnes with nearly 57% of the vote.

In 1982, the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate was Harriett Woods, a relatively unknown state senator from the St. Louis suburb of University City. She was active in women&#x27;s rights organizations and collected union support and was a cousin of Democratic Senator Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio. Her speeches denounced Ronald Reagan&#x27;s policies so vigorously that she ran on the nickname &quot;Give &#x27;em Hell, Harriett&quot; (a play on the famous Truman phrase). Danforth defeated Woods 51% to 49%, with Woods&#x27;s pro-choice stance said to be the reason for her loss.

In 1988, Danforth defeated Democrat Jay Nixon, 68%–32%. He chose not to run for a fourth term and retired from the Senate in 1995. He was succeeded by former Missouri governor John Ashcroft. Nixon was later elected Missouri Attorney General, and, in 2008, governor of Missouri.

In January 2001, when Missouri Democrats opposed Ashcroft&#x27;s nomination for U.S. Attorney General, Danforth&#x27;s name was invoked. Former U.S. Senator Tom Eagleton reacted to the nomination by saying: &quot;John Danforth would have been my first choice. John Ashcroft would have been my last choice.&quot;

====Tenure====

During the 1991 Senate confirmation hearings for U.S. Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, Danforth used his clout to support Thomas, who had served Danforth during his state attorney general years and later as an aide in the Senate.

Danforth portrayed himself as a political moderate, but voted like his right-wing Republican colleagues, including sustaining filibusters. He was once quoted as saying he joined the Republican Party for &quot;the same reason you sometimes choose which movie to see—[it&#x27;s] the one with the shortest line.&quot;

Danforth is a longtime opponent of capital punishment, as he made clear on the Senate floor in 1994.

In 1988, George H. W. Bush&#x27;s presidential campaign vetted Danforth as a potential running mate. Bush selected Senator Dan Quayle (whose middle name is &quot;Danforth&quot;) instead.

===UN Ambassador===
On July 1, 2004, Danforth was sworn in as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, succeeding John Negroponte, who left the post after becoming the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq in June. He is best remembered for attempts to bring peace to the Sudan but stayed at the UN for just six months. Danforth was mentioned as a successor to Secretary of State Colin Powell. Six days after the announcement that Condoleezza Rice was going to take the position, Danforth submitted his resignation on November 22, 2004, effective January 20, 2005. His resignation letter said, &quot;Forty-seven years ago, I married the girl of my dreams, and, at this point in my life, what is most important to me is to spend more time with her.&quot;

==Post-Senate career==

===Political activity===
In 1999, Democratic U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno appointed Danforth to lead an investigation into the FBI&#x27;s role in the 1993 Waco Siege. Danforth appointed Democratic U.S. Attorney Edward L. Dowd Jr. for the Eastern District of Missouri as his deputy special counsel. He also hired Bryan Cave partner Thomas A. Schweich as his chief of staff. Assistant U.S. Attorney James G. Martin served as Danforth&#x27;s director of investigative operations for what became known as the &quot;Waco Investigation&quot; and its resulting &quot;Danforth Report&quot;.

In July 2000, Danforth&#x27;s name was leaked as being on the short list of potential vice presidential nominees for Republican nominee George W. Bush, along with Michigan Governor John Engler, New York Governor George Pataki, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, and former U.S. Secretary of Transportation, U.S. Secretary of Labor and former American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole. One week before the 2000 Republican National Convention was held in Philadelphia, campaign sources said that Dick Cheney, the man charged with leading the selection process for the nominee, had recommended Danforth, but Bush selected Cheney himself. Bush wrote in his book &quot;Decision Points&quot; that Danforth would have been his choice if Cheney had not accepted. In September 2001, Bush appointed Danforth a special envoy to Sudan. He brokered a peace deal that officially ended the civil war in the South between Sudan&#x27;s Islamic government and the U.S.-backed Christian rebels, but elements of that conflict still remain unresolved (as has the separate Darfur conflict). Known as the Second Sudanese Civil War, the conflict ended in January 2005 with the signing of a peace agreement.

On June 11, 2004, Danforth presided over the funeral of Ronald Reagan, held at Washington National Cathedral. Danforth also officiated at the funerals of &quot;Washington Post&quot; executive Katharine Graham, former United States Senator Harry Flood Byrd Jr. of Virginia, and Missouri State Auditor Tom Schweich.

On March 30, 2005, Danforth wrote an op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; critical of the Republican party. The article began: &quot;By a series of recent initiatives, Republicans have transformed our party into the political arm of conservative Christians&quot;. He also penned a June 17, 2005, piece headlined &quot;Onward, Moderate Christian Soldiers&quot;. In 2015, Danforth joined 299 other Republicans in signing an amicus brief calling on the Supreme Court to legalize same-sex marriage.

Contributing to the anthology &quot;Our American Story&quot; (2019), Danforth addressed the possibility of a shared American narrative and focused on the &quot;great American purpose&quot; of &quot;hold[ing] together in one nation a diverse and often contentious people.&quot; He encouraged continued work &quot;to demand a functioning government where compromise is the norm, to integrate all our people into one indivisible nation, and to incorporate separated individuals into the wholeness of the community.&quot; Danforth is a member of the Reformers Caucus of Issue One.

Since the mid-2000s, Danforth was a mentor and political supporter of Josh Hawley, who became Attorney General of Missouri in 2017 and U.S. Senator in 2019 with Danforth&#x27;s encouragement; Danforth also supported Hawley&#x27;s presidential ambitions. In the wake of the January 6 United States Capitol attack and Hawley&#x27;s efforts to challenge the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count, Danforth said that supporting Hawley in the 2018 election &quot;was the worst mistake I ever made in my life&quot;. During the 2022 United States Senate election in Missouri, Danforth headed a PAC supporting independent candidate John Wood, considered a long shot to win. Wood collected enough signatures to get on the ballot but dropped out after 50 days when Eric Schmitt won the Republican primary. Danforth spent $6 million on the effort.

===Private sector===
In 1995, following his departure from the Senate, Danforth again became a partner at the Bryan Cave law firm. As of 2021 Danforth is a partner at Dowd Bennett, a Clayton law firm just outside Saint Louis.

In May 2012, a group led by Danforth&#x27;s son-in-law and Summitt Distributing CEO Tom Stillman, in which Danforth is a minority investor, took controlling ownership of the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League. The group acquired full ownership of the team in June 2019. Danforth has a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame. He is an honorary board member of the humanitarian organization Wings of Hope.

==Personal life==
Danforth married the former Sally Dobson in 1957. They have five children and 15 grandchildren.

<doc id="16239" wikidata="Q131548" url="?curid=16239" title="Jordanes">
<text>Jordanes (; Greek: Ιορδάνης), also written as Jordanis or Jornandes, was a 6th-century Eastern Roman bureaucrat, claimed to be of Gothic descent, who became a historian later in life.

He wrote two works, one on Roman history (&quot;Romana&quot;) and the other on the Goths (&quot;Getica&quot;). The latter, along with Isidore of Seville&#x27;s &quot;Historia Gothorum&quot;, is one of only two extant ancient works dealing with the early history of the Goths. Other writers, such as Procopius, wrote works on the later history of the Goths. &quot;Getica&quot; has been the object of much critical review. Jordanes wrote in Late Latin rather than the classical Ciceronian Latin. According to his own introduction, he had only three days to review what Cassiodorus had written and so he must also have relied on his own knowledge.

==Life==
Jordanes writes about himself almost in passing:

Paria was Jordanes&#x27;s paternal grandfather. Jordanes writes that he was secretary to Candac, , an otherwise unknown leader of the Alans.

Jordanes was asked by a friend to write &quot;Getica&quot; as a summary of a multi-volume history of the Goths by the statesman Cassiodorus that existed then but has since been lost. Jordanes was selected for his known interest in history and because of his own Gothic background. He had been a high-level , or secretary, of a small client state on the Roman frontier in Scythia Minor, modern southeastern Romania and northeastern Bulgaria.

Jordanes was , or secretary to Gunthigis Baza, a nephew of Candac and a magister militum of the leading Ostrogoth clan of the Amali.

That was (&quot;before my conversion&quot;). The nature and the details of the conversion remain obscure. The Goths had been converted with the assistance of Ulfilas (a Goth), made bishop on that account. However, the Goths had adopted Arianism. Jordanes&#x27;s conversion may have been a conversion to the trinitarian Nicene Creed, which may be expressed in anti-Arianism in certain passages in &quot;Getica&quot;. In the letter to Vigilius he mentions that he was awakened – &quot;by your questioning&quot;.

Alternatively, Jordanes&#x27;s may mean that he had become a monk, a or a member of the clergy. Some manuscripts say that he was a bishop, and some even say bishop of Ravenna, but the name Jordanes is not known in the lists of bishops of Ravenna.

Jordanes wrote &quot;Romana&quot;, about the history of Rome, but his best-known work is his &quot;Getica&quot;, which was written in Constantinople about 551 AD.
Jordanes wrote his &quot;Romana&quot; at the behest of a certain Vigilius. Although some scholars have identified this person with Pope Vigilius, there is nothing else to support the identification besides the name. The form of address that Jordanes uses and his admonition that Vigilius &quot;turn to God&quot; would seem to rule out this identification.

In the preface to his &quot;Getica&quot;, Jordanes writes that he is interrupting his work on the &quot;Romana&quot; at the behest of a brother Castalius, who apparently knew that Jordanes possessed the twelve volumes of the History of the Goths by Cassiodorus. Castalius wanted a short book about the subject, and Jordanes obliged with an excerpt based on memory, possibly supplemented with other material to which he had access. The &quot;Getica&quot; sets off with a geography/ethnography of the North, especially of Scandza (16–24).

He lets the history of the Goths commence with the emigration of Berig with three ships from Scandza to Gothiscandza (25, 94), in a distant past. In the pen of Jordanes, Herodotus&#x27;s Getian demigod Zalmoxis becomes a king of the Goths (39). Jordanes tells how the Goths sacked &quot;Troy and Ilium&quot; just after they had recovered somewhat from the war with Agamemnon (108). They are also said to have encountered the Egyptian pharaoh Vesosis (47). The less fictional part of Jordanes&#x27;s work begins when the Goths encounter Roman military forces in the third century AD. The work concludes with the defeat of the Goths by the Byzantine general Belisarius. Jordanes concludes the work by stating that he writes to honour those who were victorious over the Goths after a history spanning 2,030 years.

==Controversy==
Jordanes wrongly equated the Getae with the Goths. Many historical records which originally related to Dacians and Getae were thus wrongly attributed to Goths.

Arne Søby Christensen and Michael Kulikowski argue that in his &quot;Getica&quot; Jordanes also supplemented his Gothic history with many fictional events such as a Gothic war against Egypt.

Caracalla in 214 received the titles &quot;Geticus Maximus&quot; and &quot;Quasi Gothicus&quot; after battles with Getae and Goths.

<text>James Orsen Bakker (; born January 2, 1940) is an American televangelist and convicted felon. Between 1974 and 1987, Bakker hosted the television program &quot;The PTL Club&quot; and its cable television platform, the PTL Satellite Network, with his then wife, Tammy Faye. He also developed Heritage USA, a now-defunct Christian theme park in Fort Mill, South Carolina.

In the late 1980s, Bakker resigned from the PTL ministry over a cover-up of hush money to church secretary Jessica Hahn for an alleged rape. Subsequent revelations of accounting fraud brought about felony charges, conviction, imprisonment, and divorce. Bakker later remarried and returned to televangelism, founding Morningside Church in Blue Eye, Missouri, and reestablishing the PTL ministry. He currently hosts &quot;The Jim Bakker Show&quot;, which focuses on the end times and the Second Coming of Christ while promoting emergency survival products. Bakker has written several books, including &quot;I Was Wrong&quot; and &quot;Time Has Come: How to Prepare Now for Epic Events Ahead&quot;.

==Early life and education==
James Orsen Bakker was born in Muskegon, Michigan, the son of Raleigh Bakker and Furnia Lynette &quot;Furn&quot; Irwin. Bakker attended North Central University, a Minneapolis Bible college affiliated with the Assemblies of God, where he met fellow student Tammy Faye LaValley in 1960. Bakker worked at a restaurant in the Young-Quinlan department store in Minneapolis; Tammy Faye worked at the Three Sisters, a nearby boutique. Despite already having a fiancee in Muskegon, Jim began courting Tammy Faye.

The Bakkers married on April 1, 1961, and left college to become itinerant evangelists. They had two children, Tammy Sue &quot;Sissy&quot; Bakker Chapman (born March 2, 1970) and Jamie Charles &quot;Jay&quot; Bakker (born December 18, 1975). The couple divorced on March 13, 1992. On September 4, 1998, Bakker married Lori Beth Graham, a former televangelist, fifty days after they met. In 2002, they adopted five children, siblings whom Lori had befriended in Phoenix.

==Career==
===Early career===
In 1966, Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker began working at Pat Robertson&#x27;s Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) in Portsmouth, Virginia, which had an audience in the low thousands at the time. The Bakkers contributed to the network&#x27;s growth, hosting a children&#x27;s variety show called &quot;Come On Over&quot; that employed comic routines with puppets. Due to the success of &quot;Come On Over&quot;, Robertson made Bakker the host of a new prime-time talk show, &quot;The 700 Club&quot;, which gradually became CBN&#x27;s flagship program. The Bakkers left CBN in 1973 and, soon after, joined with Paul and Jan Crouch to help co-found the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) in California. However, this partnership lasted only eight months until a falling-out between Jim Bakker and Paul Crouch caused the Bakkers to eventually leave the new network.

===PTL===

While under TBN, the Bakkers moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, where in May of 1973 they launched an east coast version of &quot;Praise The Lord&quot; under TBN&#x27;s umbrella. Less than a year later the Bakkers formed their own non profit organization, registered the PTL trademark, left the umbrella of TBN and the Crouches, and continued their show on 36 WRET Charlotte, 16 WGGS Greenville, South Carolina, and a few other stations. In 1975, they nationally debuted their own late night-style talk show, known as &quot;The PTL Club&quot;. Bakker founded the PTL Satellite Network in 1974, which aired &quot;The PTL Club&quot; and other religious television programs through local affiliates across the U.S.

Throughout the 1970s, Bakker built a headquarters for PTL in the Carolinas called Heritage Village. Over time, the Bakkers expanded the ministry to include the Heritage USA theme park in Fort Mill, South Carolina, which became the third most successful theme park in the U.S. at the time. Viewer contributions were estimated to exceed $1 million a week, with proceeds to expand the theme park and &quot;The PTL Club&quot; mission. Bakker responded to inquiries about his use of mass media by saying: &quot;I believe that if Jesus were alive today, he would be on TV&quot;.

Two scandals brought down PTL in 1987: Bakker was accused of sexual misconduct by church secretary Jessica Hahn, which led to his resignation, and his illegal misuse of ministry funds eventually led to his imprisonment. Bakker was dismissed as an Assemblies of God minister on May 6, 1987. In 1990, the biographic television movie &quot;Fall from Grace&quot;, starring Kevin Spacey as Bakker, depicted his rise and fall. On January 18, 2019, ABC&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot; aired a two-hour special, entitled &quot;Unfaithfully Yours&quot;, about the PTL scandal.

==== Early investigations ====
In 1979, Bakker and PTL came under investigation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for allegedly misusing funds raised on the air. The FCC report was finalized in 1982 and found that Bakker had raised $350,000 that he told viewers would go towards funding overseas missions but that was actually used to pay for part of Heritage USA. The report also found that the Bakkers used PTL funds for personal expenses. FCC commissioners voted four to three to drop the investigation, after which they allowed Bakker to sell the only TV station that he owned, therefore bypassing future FCC oversight. The FCC forwarded its report to the U.S. Department of Justice, which declined to press charges, citing insufficient evidence. Bakker used the controversy to raise more funds from his audience, branding the investigation a &quot;witch-hunt&quot; and asking viewers to &quot;give the Devil a black eye&quot;.

A confidential 1985 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) report found that $1.3 million in ministry funds was used for the Bakkers&#x27; personal benefit from 1980 to 1983. The report recommended that PTL be stripped of its tax-exempt status, but no action was taken until after the Jessica Hahn scandal broke in 1987. Art Harris and Michael Isikoff wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that politics may have played a role in the three government agencies taking no action against PTL despite the evidence against them, as members of the Reagan administration were not eager to go after television ministers whose evangelical followers made up their base.

====Sexual misconduct and resignation====
A $279,000 payoff for the silence of Jessica Hahn, who alleged that Bakker and former &quot;PTL Club&quot; co-host John Wesley Fletcher drugged and raped her, was paid with PTL funds through Bakker&#x27;s associate Roe Messner. Bakker, who made PTL&#x27;s financial decisions, allegedly kept two sets of books to conceal accounting irregularities. Reporters for &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot;, led by Charles Shepard, investigated PTL&#x27;s finances and published a series of articles.

On March 19, 1987, after the disclosure of a payoff to Hahn, Bakker resigned from PTL. Although he acknowledged that he had a sexual encounter with Hahn at a hotel room in Clearwater, Florida, he denied raping her. Bakker was also the subject of homosexual and bisexual allegations made by Fletcher and PTL director Jay Babcock, which Bakker denied under oath. Rival televangelist John Ankerberg appeared on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; and made several allegations of moral impropriety against Bakker, which both Bakkers denied.

Bakker was succeeded as PTL head by the Rev. Jerry Falwell of Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Virginia. Bakker chose Falwell as his successor because he feared that fellow televangelist Jimmy Swaggart, who had initiated an Assemblies of God investigation into Bakker&#x27;s sexual misconduct, was attempting to take over his ministry.

Bakker believed that Falwell would temporarily lead the ministry until the scandal died down, but on April 28, 1987, Falwell barred Bakker from returning to PTL upon hearing of allegations of illicit behavior which went beyond the Hahn allegations. Later that summer, as donations declined sharply in the wake of Bakker&#x27;s resignation and the end of &quot;The PTL Club&quot;, Falwell raised $20 million to keep Heritage USA solvent and took a promised water slide ride at the park. Falwell and the remaining members of the PTL board resigned in October 1987, stating that a ruling from a bankruptcy court judge made rebuilding the ministry impossible.

In response to the scandal, Falwell called Bakker a liar, an embezzler, a sexual deviant, and &quot;the greatest scab and cancer on the face of Christianity in 2,000 years of church history&quot;. On CNN, Swaggart stated that Bakker was a &quot;cancer in the body of Christ&quot;. In February 1988, Swaggart became involved in a sex scandal of his own after being caught visiting prostitutes in New Orleans. The Bakker and Swaggart scandals had a profound effect on the world of televangelism, causing greater media scrutiny of TV ministers and their finances. Falwell said that the scandals had &quot;strengthened broadcast evangelism and made Christianity stronger, more mature and more committed.&quot;

====Fraud conviction and imprisonment====
&quot;The PTL Club&quot;″s fundraising activities between 1984 and 1987 were reported by &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot;, eventually leading to criminal charges against Bakker. Bakker and his PTL associates sold $1,000 &quot;lifetime memberships&quot;, entitling buyers to an annual three-night stay at a luxury hotel at Heritage USA during that period. According to the prosecution at Bakker&#x27;s fraud trial, tens of thousands of memberships were sold but only one 500-room hotel was ever finished. Bakker sold &quot;exclusive partnerships&quot; which exceeded capacity, raising more than twice the money needed to build the hotel. Much of the money paid Heritage USA&#x27;s operating expenses, and Bakker kept $3.4 million.

After a 16-month federal grand jury probe, Bakker was indicted in 1988 on eight counts of mail fraud, 15 counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy. In 1989, after a five-week trial which began on August 28 in Charlotte, North Carolina, a jury found him guilty on all 24 counts. Judge Robert Daniel Potter sentenced Bakker to 45 years in federal prison and imposed a $500,000 fine. At the Federal Medical Center, Rochester in Rochester, Minnesota, he shared a cell with activist Lyndon LaRouche and skydiver Roger Nelson.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld Bakker&#x27;s conviction on the fraud and conspiracy charges, voided Bakker&#x27;s 45-year sentence and $500,000 fine and ordered a new sentencing hearing in February 1991. The court ruled that Potter&#x27;s sentencing statement about Bakker, that &quot;those of us who do have a religion are sick of being saps for money-grubbing preachers and priests&quot;, was evidence that the judge had injected his religious beliefs into Bakker&#x27;s sentence.

A sentence-reduction hearing was held on November 16, 1992, and Bakker&#x27;s sentence was reduced to eight years. In August 1993, he was transferred to a minimum-security federal prison in Jesup, Georgia. Bakker was paroled in July 1994, after serving almost five years of his sentence. His son, Jay, spearheaded a letter-writing campaign to the parole board advocating leniency. Celebrity lawyer Alan Dershowitz acted as Bakker&#x27;s parole attorney, having said that he &quot;would guarantee that Mr. Bakker would never again engage in the blend of religion and commerce that led to his conviction.&quot; Bakker was released from Federal Bureau of Prisons custody on December 1, 1994, owing $6 million to the IRS.
===Return to televangelism===

In 2003, Bakker began broadcasting &quot;The Jim Bakker Show&quot; daily at Studio City Café in Branson, Missouri, with his second wife Lori; it has been carried on CTN, Daystar, Folk TV, Grace Network (Canada), Daystar Television Canada, GEB America, Hope TV (Canada), Impact Network, WGN, WHT, TCT Network, The Word Network, UpliftTV, and ZLiving networks. Most of Bakker&#x27;s audience receives his program on DirecTV and Dish Network. 

Bakker condemned the prosperity theology in which he took part earlier in his career, and has embraced apocalypticism. His show has a millennial, survivalist focus and sells buckets of freeze-dried food, such as beans on toast, to his audience in preparation for the end of days. Elspeth Reeve wrote in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; that Bakker&#x27;s &quot;doomsday survival gear&quot; is overpriced. A man named Jerry Crawford, who credits Bakker with saving his marriage, invested $25 million in a new ministry for Bakker in Blue Eye, Missouri, named Morningside USA. Production for &quot;The Jim Bakker Show&quot; moved to Morningside in 2008.

====Prophecies and statements====
In 2013, Bakker wrote &quot;Time Has Come: How to Prepare Now for Epic Events Ahead&quot; about end-time events. Bakker has changed his views on prosperity theology. In his 1980 book &quot;Eight Keys to Success&quot;, he stated, &quot;God wants you to be happy, God wants you to be rich, God wants you to prosper.&quot; In his 1996 book, &quot;I Was Wrong&quot;, he admitted that the first time he actually read the Bible all the way through was in prison. Bakker also wrote that he realized that he had taken passages out of context and used them as prooftexts to support his prosperity theology.

Bakker&#x27;s revived show features a number of ministers who bill themselves as &quot;prophets&quot;. He now says that &quot;PTL&quot; stands for &quot;Prophets Talking Loud&quot;.

In an October 2017 video, Bakker said that &quot;God will punish those&quot; who ridicule him; he has said that Hurricane Harvey was a judgment of God, and he blamed Hurricane Matthew on then-President Barack Obama. Bakker predicted that if then-President Donald Trump was impeached, Christians would begin a Second American Civil War. He compared the 2017 Washington train derailment to the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; and stated the Amtrak train derailment was a warning from God. He also claimed that he predicted the September 11 attacks of 2001, stating that he &quot;saw 9/11 in 1999 before New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot; and that there would &quot;be terrorism&quot; and bombings in New York City and Washington, D.C.&quot; A few days after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, he stated that &quot;God came to [him] in a dream... and he was wearing camouflage, a hunting vest and had an AR-15 strapped to his back&quot; and that God supported Trump&#x27;s plan to arm teachers. Following the death of Billy Graham on February 21, 2018, Bakker attended Graham&#x27;s funeral and paid his respects, stating that Graham was the greatest preacher since Jesus, and also remarking that Graham had visited him in prison.

On the &quot;Stand in the Gap Today&quot; radio program, Pennsylvania Pastors Network president Sam Rohrer criticized Bakker&#x27;s civil-war prediction. &quot;Christian Today&quot; criticized Bakker&#x27;s show for preying on &quot;the most vulnerable kinds of people&quot; and claimed that it had &quot;no place on our TV screens.&quot;

====COVID-19 misinformation====

Bakker sold colloidal silver supplements that he advertised as a panacea. In March 2020, the office of the Attorney General of New York ordered Bakker to cease making false medicinal claims about his supplements&#x27; alleged ability to cure the 2019–2020 strains of coronavirus, and the Federal Trade Commission and the Food and Drug Administration also sent a warning letter to Bakker about his claims regarding the supplements and coronavirus.

Missouri attorney general Eric Schmitt and Arkansas attorney general Leslie Rutledge filed lawsuits against Bakker for allegedly pushing the supplements as a treatment for the virus. In the State lawsuit against him, Bakker is represented by former Missouri governor Jay Nixon, who has argued for the suit to be dismissed. Nixon says that the allegations made in the lawsuit are false, stating: &quot;Bakker is being unfairly targeted by those who want to crush his ministry and force his Christian television program off the air.&quot;

In April 2020, prohibited from receiving credit card transactions, Bakker disclosed to his viewers that his ministry was on the brink of filing for bankruptcy and urgently petitioned them for donations.

The following month, GEB America and World Harvest Television dropped Bakker&#x27;s program from their networks after DirecTV owner AT&amp;T asked channels to reconsider airing the show. AT&amp;T made the request of its channels in response to a deplatforming campaign from the liberal Christian group Faithful America.

On May 8, 2020, Lori Bakker announced that Jim Bakker had suffered a stroke that his son Jay described as &quot;minor&quot;. Lori stated that he would be taking a sabbatical from the program until he recovers. She blamed the stroke on Bakker&#x27;s hard work on his show and wrote that he had described the criticism against him as &quot;the most vicious attack that he has ever experienced&quot;. Bakker returned to his program for the first time following his stroke on July 8, 2020.

On June 23, 2021, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt announced the settlement of the state&#x27;s lawsuit against Bakker. Bakker and Morningside Church would be prohibited from saying silver solution could &quot;diagnose, prevent, mitigate, treat, or cure any disease or illness&quot;. Restitution of about $157,000 would also be paid to those who bought silver solution between February 12, 2020, and March 10, 2020.

<text>Jan and Dean were an American rock duo consisting of William Jan Berry (April 3, 1941 – March 26, 2004) and Dean Ormsby Torrence (born March 10, 1940). In the early 1960s, they were pioneers of the California Sound and vocal surf music styles popularized by the Beach Boys.

Among their most successful songs was 1963&#x27;s &quot;Surf City&quot;, the first surf song ever to reach the #1 spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the US. Their other charting top 10 singles were &quot;Baby Talk&quot; (1959), &quot;Drag City&quot; (1963), &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Curve&quot; (1964; inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008,) and &quot;The Little Old Lady (from Pasadena)&quot; (1964). 

In 1972, Torrence won the Grammy Award for Best Album Cover for the psychedelic rock band Pollution&#x27;s first eponymous 1971 album, and was nominated three other times in the same category for albums of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. In 2013, Torrence&#x27;s design contribution of the Surf City Allstars&#x27; &quot;In Concert&quot; CD was named a Silver Award of Distinction at the Communicator Awards competition.

==Early lives==
William Jan Berry (April 3, 1941 – March 26, 2004), was born in Los Angeles to Clara Lorentze Mustad (born September 2, 1919, Bergen, Norway – died July 9, 2009) and aeronautical engineer William L. Berry (born December 7, 1909, New York City – died December 19, 2004, Camarillo, California), He was raised in Bel Air, Los Angeles. Jan&#x27;s father worked for Howard Hughes as a project manager of the &quot;Spruce Goose&quot; and flew on its only flight with Hughes.

Dean Ormsby Torrence (born ) was born in Los Angeles, the son of Natalie Ormsby (April 10, 1911 – August 10, 2008) and Maurice Dean Torrence (December 5, 1907 – November 16, 1997). His father, Maurice, was a graduate of Stanford University, and was a sales manager at the Wilshire Oil Company.

==History==

===1957–59: formation===
Berry and Torrence met while both were students at Emerson Junior High School in Westwood, Los Angeles, and both were on the school&#x27;s football team. By 1957, they were students in the class of 1958 at the nearby University High School, where again they were both on the school&#x27;s football team, the Warriors. Berry and Torrence had adjoining lockers, and after football practice, they began harmonizing together in the showers with several other football players, including future actor James Brolin.

====The Barons====
In order to enter a talent competition at University High School, Berry and Torrence helped form a doo-wop group known as &quot;The Barons&quot; (named after their high school&#x27;s Hi-Y club, of which they were members), which was composed of fellow University High students William &quot;Chuck&quot; Steele (lead singer), Arnold P. &quot;Arnie&quot; Ginsburg (born November 19, 1939; 1st tenor), Wallace S. &quot;Wally&quot; Yagi (born July 20, 1940; 2nd tenor), John &#x27;Sagi&quot; Seligman (2nd tenor), with Berry singing bass and Torrence providing falsetto.

During its short duration, Sandy Nelson, Torrence&#x27;s neighbor, played drums, and future Beach Boy Bruce Johnston occasionally sang and played piano. The Barons rehearsed for hours in Berry&#x27;s parents&#x27; garage, where Berry&#x27;s father provided an upright piano and two two-track Ampex reel-to-reel tape recorders.

In 1958, the Barons performed to popular acclaim at the talent competition at University High School, covering contemporary hits like &quot;Get a Job&quot;, &quot;Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay&quot;, and &quot;Short Shorts&quot;. Following the contest, various members of the Barons drifted away, leaving only Berry and Torrence, who tried to write their own songs.

====Jan &amp; Arnie====
After being inspired by a poster featuring a local Hollywood burlesque performer, Virginia Lee Hicks, who was then performing as Jennie Lee, the &quot;Bazoom Girl&quot;, at the New Follies Burlesk at 548 S. Main St, Los Angeles, Ginsburg wrote a tribute song, &quot;Jennie Lee&quot;, that he brought to Berry and Torrence. Berry adapted the Civil War tune &quot;Aura Lea&quot; and arranged the harmonies. After weeks of practice, Berry, Ginsburg, and Torrence planned to make a demo recording in Berry&#x27;s garage, but Torrence was drafted into the United States Army Reserve, forcing Berry and Ginsburg to record &quot;Jennie Lee&quot; without Torrence, with Berry&#x27;s friend and fellow University High student Donald J. Altfeld (born March 18, 1940, in Los Angeles ) &quot;beating out the rhythm on a children&#x27;s metal high chair&quot;. The next day Berry took their recording to Radio Recorders, a small recording studio, to have it transferred to an acetate disc. Joe Lubin, Vice President and Head of A &amp; R of Arwin Records, was impressed and offered to add instruments and to release it through Arwin.

In March 1958, the fathers of Berry and Ginsburg signed contracts authorizing Lubin to produce, arrange, and manage their sons.

Produced by Lubin, &quot;Jennie Lee&quot; (Arwin 108), backed with &quot;Gotta Get a Date&quot; (credited to Ginsburg, Berry &amp; Lubin), became a surprise commercial success. According to Berry biographer Mark A. Moore, &quot;The song (with backing vocals, plus additional instruments added by the Ernie Freeman combo) had a raucous R&amp;B flavor, with a bouncing bomp-bomp vocal hook that would become a signature from Jan on future recordings.&quot; Distributed by Dot Records, &quot;Jennie Lee&quot; was released in mid-April, entered the charts on May 10, 1958, the same day they appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dick Clark Show&quot;. &quot;Jennie Lee&quot; peaked at No. 3 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; charts on June 21, 1958, No. 4 on the R&amp;B charts, and No. 8 on the Billboard charts on June 30, 1958. Billy Ward and his Dominoes&#x27;s R&amp;B cover of &quot;Jennie Lee&quot; reached No. 55 in the Pop charts in June 1958, while other cover versions including that of Moon Mullican (Coral 9-61994) and Bobby Phillips &amp; the Toppers (Tops 45-R422-49), released in 1958 failed to chart.

In July 1958, Jan &amp; Arnie released their second single, &quot;Gas Money&quot; backed with &quot;Bonnie Lou&quot; (Arwin 111), both written by Berry, Ginsburg, and Altfeld. Like &quot;Jennie Lee&quot;, &quot;Gas Money&quot; contained a few elements of what would later become surf music. It entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts on August 24, 1958, and peaked at No. 81 a week later. Jan &amp; Arnie were a featured act on the Summer Dance Party that toured the US East Coast, including Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Connecticut in July 1958. By the end of the month, they traveled to Manhattan to appear on &quot;The Dick Clark Show&quot;.

On August 24, 1958, Jan &amp; Arnie played in a live show hosted by Dick Clark that featured Bobby Darin, the Champs, Sheb Wooley, the Blossoms, the Six Teens, Jerry Wallace, Jack Jones, Rod McKuen and the Ernie Freeman Orchestra in front of nearly 12,000 fans at the first rock-n-roll show ever held at the Hollywood Bowl.

By September 6, 1958, Jan &amp; Arnie&#x27;s third and final single, &quot;The Beat That Can&#x27;t Be Beat&quot; backed with &quot;I Love Linda&quot; (Arwin 113), again composed by the Berry, Ginsburg, and Altfeld team, was released. However this single failed to chart, due in part to a lack of distribution. On October 19, 1958, Jan &amp; Arnie performed &quot;The Beat That Can&#x27;t Be Beat&quot; on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Jack Benny Show&quot;.

Arnie Ginsburg recorded a one-off single with a band named the Rituals on the Arwin label. The single, &quot;Girl in Zanzibar&quot; b/w &quot;Guitarro&quot;, was released on vinyl in January 1959, preceding Jan and Dean&#x27;s first single &quot;Baby Talk&quot;, released in May 1959. Other than Arnie, the single featured Richard Podolor on guitar, Sandy Nelson on drums, Bruce Johnston on piano, Dave Shostac on sax, Harper Cosby on bass, and Mike Deasy on guitar. It is unclear if the actual single was released for the general public but there are several promotional copies pressed to vinyl in existence.

By the end of the year, when Torrence had completed his six-month stint at Fort Ord, Ginsburg had become disenchanted with the music business. Ginsburg enrolled in the School of Architecture and Design at the University of Southern California and graduated in the field of product design in 1966. After graduation Ginsburg worked for several noted Los Angeles architects, among them Charles Eames, and in December 1973 he was granted a U.S. patent for a table he designed.

Ginsburg moved in 1975 to Santa Barbara, California, where he worked as an architectural designer. designing the innovative Ginsburg House. In September 1976, Ginsburg and Michael W. O&#x27;Neill were granted a patent for a portable batting cage.

===1959–62: early records===
After Torrence returned from a six-month compulsory stint in the US Army Reserve, Berry and Torrence began to make music as &quot;Jan and Dean&quot;. With the help of record producers Herb Alpert and Lou Adler, Jan and Dean scored a No. 10 hit on the Dore label with &quot;Baby Talk&quot; (1959) (which was incorrectly labeled as Jan &amp; Arnie when it initially was released), then scored a series of hits over the next couple of years. Playing local venues, they met and performed with the Beach Boys, and discovered the appeal of the latter&#x27;s &quot;surf sound&quot;. By this time Berry was co-writing, arranging, and producing all of Jan and Dean&#x27;s original material.

During this time Berry co-wrote or arranged and produced songs for other artists outside of Jan and Dean, including the Angels (&quot;I Adore Him&quot;, Top 30), the Gents, the Matadors (Sinners), Pixie (unreleased), Jill Gibson, Shelley Fabares, Deane Hawley, the Rip Chords (&quot;Three Window Coupe&quot;, Top 30), and Johnny Crawford, among others.

Unlike most other rock &#x27;n roll acts of the period, Jan and Dean did not give music their full-time attention. Jan and Dean were college students, maintaining their studies while writing and recording music and making public appearances on the side. Torrence majored in advertising design in the school of architecture at USC, where he also was a member of the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity. Berry took science and music classes at UCLA, became a member of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, and entered the California College of Medicine (now the UC Irvine School of Medicine) in 1963.

===1963–66: peak years===

Jan and Dean reached their commercial peak in 1963 and 1964, after they met Brian Wilson. The duo scored sixteen Top 40 hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Cash Box&quot; magazine charts, with a total of twenty-six chart hits over an eight-year period (1959-1966). Berry and Wilson collaborated on roughly a dozen hits and album cuts for Jan and Dean, including &quot;Surf City&quot;, co-written by Jan Berry and Brian Wilson (#1, 1963). Subsequent top 10 hits included &quot;Drag City&quot; (#10, 1964), the eerily portentous &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Curve&quot; (#8, 1964), and &quot;The Little Old Lady from Pasadena&quot; (#3, 1964).

In 1964, at the height of their fame, Jan and Dean hosted and performed at &quot;The T.A.M.I. Show,&quot; a historic concert film directed by Steve Binder. The film also featured such acts as the Rolling Stones, Chuck Berry, Gerry &amp; the Pacemakers, James Brown, Billy J. Kramer &amp; the Dakotas, Marvin Gaye, the Supremes, Lesley Gore, Smokey Robinson &amp; the Miracles and the Beach Boys. Also in 1964, the duo performed the title track for the Columbia Pictures film &quot;Ride the Wild Surf&quot;, starring Fabian Forte, Tab Hunter, Peter Brown, Shelley Fabares, and Barbara Eden. The song, penned by Jan Berry, Brian Wilson and Roger Christian, was a Top 20 national hit. The pair were also to have appeared in the film, but their roles were cut following their friendship with Barry Keenan, who had engineered the Frank Sinatra Jr. kidnapping.

Jan and Dean also filmed two unreleased television pilots: &quot;Surf Scene&quot; in 1963 and &quot;On the Run&quot; in 1966. Their feature film for Paramount Pictures &quot;Easy Come, Easy Go&quot; was canceled when Berry, as well as the film&#x27;s director and other crew members, were seriously injured in a railroad accident while shooting the film in Chatsworth, California, in August 1965.

After the surfing craze, Jan and Dean scored two Top-30 hits in 1965: &quot;You Really Know How to Hurt a Guy&quot; got up to 27 and &quot;I Found a Girl&quot; got to 30—the latter from the album &quot;Folk &#x27;n Roll&quot;. During this period, they also began to experiment with cutting-edge comedy concepts such as the original (unreleased) &quot;Filet of Soul&quot; and &quot;Jan &amp; Dean Meet Batman&quot;. The former&#x27;s album cover shows Berry with his leg in a cast as a result of the accident while filming &quot;Easy Come, Easy Go&quot;.

In 1966, Jan Berry recorded &quot;The Universal Coward&quot;, an angry response to Donovan’s anti-war single &quot;Universal Soldier&quot;(originally written by Buffy Sainte-Marie) even though Berry never served in the military.

===1966–68: Berry&#x27;s car wreck===
On April 12, 1966, Berry received severe head injuries in an automobile accident on Whittier Drive, just a short distance from Dead Man&#x27;s Curve in Beverly Hills, California, two years after the song had become a hit. He was en route to a business meeting when he crashed his Corvette into a parked truck on Whittier Drive, near the intersection of Sunset Boulevard, in Beverly Hills. Berry also had separated from his girlfriend of seven years, singer-artist Jill Gibson, later a member of the Mamas &amp; the Papas for a short time, who also had co-written several songs with him. He was in a coma for more than two months before finally awakening on the morning of June 16.

Berry recovered from brain damage and partial paralysis. He had limited use of his right arm, and had to learn to write with his left hand as well as learning to walk again.

In Berry&#x27;s absence, Torrence released several singles on the J&amp;D Record Co. label and recorded &quot;Save for a Rainy Day&quot; in 1966, a concept album featuring all rain-themed songs. Torrence posed with Berry&#x27;s brother Ken for the album cover photos. Columbia Records released one single from the project (&quot;Yellow Balloon&quot;) as did the song&#x27;s writer, Gary Zekley, with the group the Yellow Balloon.

 Besides his studio work, Torrence became a graphic artist, starting his own company, Kittyhawk Graphics, and designing and creating album covers and logos for other musicians and recording artists, including Harry Nilsson, Steve Martin, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Michael Nesmith, Dennis Wilson, Bruce Johnston, the Beach Boys, Diana Ross and the Supremes, Linda Ronstadt, Canned Heat, the Ventures and many others. Torrence (with Gene Brownell) won a Grammy Award for &quot;Album Cover of the Year&quot; in 1971, for the album &quot;Pollution&quot; by Pollution on Prophesy Records.

Berry returned to the studio in April 1967, almost one year to the day after his accident. Working with Alan Wolfson, he began writing and producing music again. In December 1967, Jan and Dean signed an agreement with Warner Bros. Records. Warner issued three singles under the name &quot;Jan and Dean&quot;, but a 1968 Berry-produced album for Warner Bros., the psychedelic &quot;Carnival of Sound&quot;, remained unreleased until February 2010, when Rhino Records&#x27; &quot;Handmade&quot; label put out CD and vinyl compilations of all tracks recorded for &quot;Carnival&quot;, along with various outtakes and remixes from the project.

===Later years===
In 1971, Jan and Dean released the album &quot;Jan &amp; Dean Anthology Album&quot; under the label United Artists Records. The album included many of their top hits, starting with 1958&#x27;s &quot;Jennie Lee&quot; and ending with 1968&#x27;s &quot;Vegetables&quot;.

Berry began to sing again in the early 1970s, touring with his Aloha band, while Dean began performing with a band called Papa Doo Run Run.

On August 26, 1973, Torrence was scheduled to appear at the Hollywood Palladium as part of Jim Pewter&#x27;s &quot;Surfer&#x27;s Stomp&quot; reunion. Torrence had recently released some Jan &amp; Dean songs with new vocal parts by Bruce Johnston (of the Beach Boys) and producer Terry Melcher under the moniker the Legendary Masked Surfers. Torrence arranged with Berry to join him lip-syncing on stage to a pre-recorded track. The two anticipated that the audience would know it was a tape recording, and they decided to make light of it during the performance. That night, they joked around and stopped lip-syncing on stage while the music continued, but the audience became angry and started booing. The duo&#x27;s first live performance after Berry&#x27;s accident occurred at the Palomino Nightclub in North Hollywood on June 5, 1976, ten years after the accident, as guests of Disneyland regulars Papa Doo Run Run. Their first actual multi-song concert billed as Jan and Dean took place in 1978 in New York City at the Palladium as part of the Murray the K Brooklyn Fox Reunion Show. This was followed by a handful of East Coast shows as guests of their longtime friends the Beach Boys. Four nationwide J &amp; D headlining tours followed through 1980. Berry was still suffering the effects of his 1966 accident, with partial paralysis and aphasia.

The duo experienced a resurgence after Paul Morantz&#x27;s &quot;Road back from Deadman&#x27;s Curve&quot; article appeared in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1974, writing the piece after spending extensive time with the two singers, their families, doctors and associates. Morantz first submitted the story to &quot;Playboy&quot;, who recommended it to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. He then wrote a film treatment from his story which was purchased by CBS.

On February 3, 1978, CBS aired a made-for-TV film about the duo titled &quot;Deadman&#x27;s Curve&quot;. The biopic starred Richard Hatch as Jan Berry and Bruce Davison as Dean Torrence, with cameo appearances by Dick Clark, Wolfman Jack, Mike Love of the Beach Boys, and Bruce Johnston (who at that time was temporarily out of the Beach Boys), as well as Berry himself. Near the end of the film he can be seen sitting in the audience, watching &quot;himself&quot; (Richard Hatch) perform onstage. The part of Jan and Dean&#x27;s band was played by Papa Doo Run Run, which included Mark Ward and Jim Armstrong, who went on to form Jan and Dean and the Bel-Air Bandits. Johnston and Berry had known each other since high school, and had played music together in Berry&#x27;s garage in Bel Air — long before Jan and Dean or the Beach Boys were formed. Following the release of the film, the duo made steps toward an official comeback that year, including touring with the Beach Boys, and performing with Papa Doo Run Run at Cupertino High School. In the Netherlands the showing on television of the movie by Veronica in August 1979 earned them a huge hit record of the re-recorded &quot;Surf City&quot; and &quot;Deadman&#x27;s Curve&quot; songs as a double A-sided single record release, and a golden oldies record having &quot;The Little Old Lady From Pasadena&quot; as its flip side reached a lower position in the charts.

In the early 1980s, Papa Doo Run Run left to explore other performance and recording ventures. Berry struggled to overcome drug addiction. In 1979, Berry had performed over 100 concerts of Jan and Dean songs with another front man from Hawaii, Randy Ruff. Torrence also toured briefly as &quot;Mike &amp; Dean&quot;, with Mike Love of the Beach Boys. Later, the duo reunited for good. In &quot;Phase II&quot; of their career, Torrence led the touring operation.

Jan and Dean continued to tour on their own throughout the 1980s, the 1990s, and into the new millennium – with 1960s nostalgia providing them with a ready audience, headlining oldies shows throughout North America. Sundazed Music reissued Torrence&#x27;s &quot;Save for a Rainy Day&quot; in 1996 in CD and vinyl formats, as well as the collector&#x27;s vinyl 45 rpm companion EP, &quot;Sounds For A Rainy Day&quot;, featuring four instrumental versions of the album&#x27;s tracks.

Between the 1970s and the early 2000s, Torrence issued a number of re-recordings of classic Jan and Dean and Beach Boys hits. A double album titled &quot;One Summer Night / Live&quot; was issued by Rhino Records in 1982. Torrence released the album &quot;Silver Summer&quot; with the help of Mike Love in 1985 for Jan &amp; Dean&#x27;s 25th anniversary. &quot;Silver Summer&quot; was officially released as a Jan &amp; Dean album, but falsely gives credit to Berry as co-producer and singer; Berry did not contribute to the album. Torrence participated with Berry on &quot;Port to Paradise&quot;, released as a cassette on the J&amp;D Records label in 1986. In 1997, after many years of hard work, Berry released a solo album called &quot;Second Wave&quot; on One Way Records. June 11, 2002, Torrence released a solo album titled &quot;Anthology: Legendary Masked Surfer Unmasked&quot;.

On August 31, 1991, Berry married Gertie Filip at the Stardust Convention Centre in Las Vegas, Nevada. Torrence was Berry&#x27;s best man at the wedding.

====Berry&#x27;s death====
Berry died on March 26, 2004, as the result of a seizure at age 62. He was an organ donor and his body was cremated. On April 18, a &quot;Celebration of Life&quot; was held in Berry&#x27;s memory at the Roxy Theatre on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, California. Attendees included Torrence, Lou Adler, Jill Gibson, and Nancy Sinatra, along with many family members, friends, and musicians associated with Jan and Dean and the Beach Boys, including the original members of Papa Doo Run Run.

In February 2010, the Jan and Dean album &quot;Carnival of Sound&quot; was released on the Rhino Handmade label. The album cover was designed by Torrence. Along with the CD, there was a limited edition (1500 copies), which included a 10-track LP. The album was released in Europe in April 2010 in its original US form.

In 2012, Torrence reunited with Bruce Davison, who portrayed him in the 1978 film &quot;Deadman&#x27;s Curve&quot;, to perform with the Bamboo Trading Company on their &quot;From Kitty Hawk To Surf City&quot; album. The songs were &quot;Shrewd Awakening&quot; and &quot;Tonga Hut&quot;, which was featured on the film &quot;Return of the Killer Shrews&quot;, a sequel to the 1959 film &quot;The Killer Shrews&quot; and also &quot;Tweet (Don&#x27;t Talk Anymore)&quot;, &quot;Drinkin&#x27; In the Sunshine&quot;, and &quot;Star Of The Beach&quot;. The album also features Dean&#x27;s two daughters, Jillian and Katie Torrence. Torrence and his two daughters were featured in the music video of &quot;Shrewd Awakening&quot;.

After Berry&#x27;s death, Torrence began touring occasionally with the Surf City All-Stars. He serves as a spokesman for the City of Huntington Beach, California, which, thanks in part to his efforts, is nationally recognized as &quot;Surf City USA&quot;. Torrence&#x27;s website features—among other things—rare images, a complete Jan and Dean discography, a biography, and a timeline of his career with cohort Jan Berry. He currently resides in Huntington Beach, California, with his wife and two daughters.

==Legacy==
In 1964, Jan and Dean were signed to host what became the first multi-act rock and roll show that was edited into a motion picture designed for wide distribution. &quot;The T.A.M.I. Show&quot; became a seminal and original production – in essence one of the first rock videos – on its release in 1964. Using a high-resolution videotape process called Electronovision (transferred from television directly onto 35mm motion picture stock as a kinescope), new sound recording techniques and having a remarkable cast, &quot;The T.A.M.I. Show&quot; set the standard for all succeeding music film and video work, including many of the early videos shown by MTV 17 years later. The revolutionary technical achievements of &quot;The T.A.M.I. Show&quot; and the list of performers (including a performance by James Brown that many critics have called the best of his career) marked a high point for Jan and Dean, as they were the hosts and one of the main featured acts as well. They became one of the main faces of mid-1960s music, until Berry&#x27;s auto accident two years later, through their &quot;T.A.M.I. Show &quot;appearance.

According to rock critic Dave Marsh, the attitude and public persona of punk rock can be traced to Jan and Dean.

Brian Wilson has cited Berry as having a direct impact on his own growth as a record producer.

In an interview conducted by Jan and Dean fan and historian David Beard for the Collectors&#x27; Choice release, &quot;Jan &amp; Dean, the Complete Liberty Singles&quot;, Dean Torrence stated that he felt the duo should be in the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame: &quot;We have the scoreboard if you just want to compare number of hits and musical projects done. We beat 75 percent of the people in there. So what else is it? I&#x27;ve got to think that we were pretty irreverent when it came to the music industry. They kind of always held that against us. That&#x27;s okay with me.&quot;

Jan and Dean were inducted into the Hollywood Rock Walk of Fame on April 12, 1996, exactly 30 years after Jan Berry had his near fatal car accident.

On January 28, 2023, Jan and Dean were inducted into the California Music Hall Of Fame.

The Who covered Jan and Dean&#x27;s &quot;Bucket T&quot; on their UK EP &quot;Ready Steady Who&quot; from 1966, one of only a few songs the group performed where surf-fan Keith Moon provided the lead vocals.

Alternative rock group the Red Hot Chili Peppers referenced the duo in their song &quot;Did I Let You Know&quot;, on the album &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot;.
