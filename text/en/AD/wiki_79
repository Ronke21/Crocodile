<text>Lyman J. Abbott (December 18, 1835 – October 22, 1922) was an American Congregationalist theologian, editor, and author.

==Biography==
===Early years===

Abbott was born at Roxbury, Massachusetts, on December 18, 1835, the son of the prolific author, educator and historian Jacob Abbott, and his mother being Harriet Vaughan. Abbott grew up in Farmington, Maine, and later in New York City. Abbott&#x27;s ancestors were from England, and came to America roughly twenty years after Plymouth Rock.

He graduated from the New York University in 1853, where he was a member of the Eucleian Society, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1856. Abbott soon abandoned the legal profession, however, and after studying theology with his uncle, John Stevens Cabot Abbott, was ordained a minister of the Congregational Church in 1860. He was married October 14, 1857, to Abby F. Hamlin, whose father Hannibal Hamlin (1809-1863) was the cousin of the politician Hannibal Hamlin of Boston, Mass.

===Career===
He was pastor of the Congregational Church in Terre Haute, Indiana, from 1860 to 1865 and of the New England Church in New York City in 1865–1869. From 1865 to 1868 he was secretary of the American Union Commission (later called the American Freedmen&#x27;s and Union Commission). In 1869 he resigned his pastorate to devote himself to literature.
Abbott worked variously in the publishing profession as an associate editor of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and was the founder of a publication called the &quot;Illustrated Christian Weekly,&quot; which he edited for six years. He was also the co-editor of &quot;The Christian Union&quot; with Henry Ward Beecher from 1876 to 1881. Abbott later succeeded Beecher in 1888 as pastor of Plymouth Church, Brooklyn. He also wrote the official biography of Beecher and edited his papers.

From 1881 Abbott was editor-in-chief of &quot;The Christian Union&quot;, renamed &quot;The Outlook&quot; in 1891; this periodical reflected his efforts toward social reform, and, in theology, a liberality, humanitarianism and nearly unitarian. The latter characteristics marked his published works also.

Abbott&#x27;s opinions differed from those of Beecher. Abbott was a constant advocate of Industrial Democracy, and was an advocate of Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s progressivism for almost 20 years. He would later adopt a pronouncedly liberal theology. He was also a pronounced Christian Evolutionist. In two of his books, &quot;The Evolution of Christianity&quot; and &quot;The Theology of an Evolutionist&quot;, Abbott applied the concept of evolution in a Christian theological perspective. Although he himself objected to being called an advocate of Darwinism, he was an optimistic advocate of evolution who thought that &quot;what Jesus saw, humanity is becoming.&quot;

Abbott was a religious figure of some public note and was called upon on October 30, 1897, to deliver an address in New York at the funeral of economist, Henry George. He ultimately resigned his pastorate in November 1898.

His son, Lawrence Fraser Abbott, accompanied President Roosevelt on a tour of Europe and Africa (1909–10). In 1913 Lyman Abbott was expelled from the American Peace Society because military preparedness was vigorously advocated in &quot;The Outlook&quot;, which he edited, and because he was a member of the Army and Navy League. During the World War I he was a strong supporter of the government&#x27;s war policies.

He received the degree D.D. from the University of the City of New York in 1879; from Harvard in 1891, from Yale in 1903, and LL.D. from Western Reserve in 1900.

===Death and legacy===
Lyman Abbott died on October 22, 1922, and was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery at New Windsor, New York.

The editors of &quot;The Outlook&quot; kept their normal routine, publishing without &quot;departure from the normal course of publication&quot; since that was what their departed colleague would have wanted. The issue asked readers for understanding as the paper &quot;wait[ed] until [the] next week to give to his friends, known and unknown, a record of his life and of the tributes which marked his passing.&quot; A brief tribute appeared in that issue, but the November 8th edition contained the official remembrance and tributes. Fifteen pages in that issue dealt with Abbott, and the publishers included &quot;several long essays in Abbott&#x27;s honor from close relatives, shorter tributes from friends and past associates, and blurbs from many American press companies.&quot;

The many diverse and prominent author who contributed tributes &quot;demonstrated the scope and magnitude of Lyman Abbott&#x27;s influence within American religious and intellectual culture during his long career.&quot; Prominent examples include a re-published 1915 tribute from former United States president Theodore Roosevelt and articles from prestigious newspapers such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;New York Herald&quot;. Roosevelt praised Abbott for being &quot;one of those men whose work and life give strength to all who believe in this country,&quot; and the New York Herald recalled Abbott&#x27;s ability to &quot;convey his valuable opinions to the entire intellectual public.&quot; Dr. Henry Sloane Coffin noted at a later memorial service, &quot;Measured by the number of people he reached, Dr. Abbott was unquestionably the greatest teacher of religion of this generation.&quot;

Abbott&#x27;s lasting influence and widespread appeal is readily apparent in later evaluations of his life. Abbott&#x27;s one biographer, Ira V. Brown, confirmed Abbott&#x27;s importance via &quot;testimonials by the dozen,&quot; and added that Abbott &quot;directly reached several hundred thousands of people&quot; through his work as a &quot;minister, lecturer, author, and editor.&quot; Abbott was &quot;something of a national patriarch&quot; by the time of his death, and according to Brown, he was &quot;no less than a modern oracle&quot; to thousands of followers. Abbott influenced hundreds every week through his sermons at the prestigious Plymouth Avenue Congregationalist Church. He also gave speeches at many American colleges, published several books that sold between five and ten thousand copies, and edited the Outlook that, at its peak, sold &quot;about 125,000 copies a week.&quot; The magazine &quot;was a prominent news source for Protestant ministers and laypeople all over the United States, demonstrating Abbott&#x27;s lasting influence.&quot;

<doc id="18472" wikidata="Q194230" url="?curid=18472" title="Leap second">
<text>A leap second is a one-second adjustment that is occasionally applied to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), to accommodate the difference between precise time (International Atomic Time (TAI), as measured by atomic clocks) and imprecise observed solar time (UT1), which varies due to irregularities and long-term slowdown in the Earth&#x27;s rotation. The UTC time standard, widely used for international timekeeping and as the reference for civil time in most countries, uses TAI and consequently would run ahead of observed solar time unless it is reset to UT1 as needed. The leap second facility exists to provide this adjustment. The leap second was introduced in 1972. Since then, 27 leap seconds have been added to UTC, with the most recent occurring on December 31, 2016. All have so far been positive leap seconds, adding a second to a UTC day; while it is possible for a negative leap second to be needed, this has not happened yet.

Because the Earth&#x27;s rotational speed varies in response to climatic and geological events, UTC leap seconds are irregularly spaced and unpredictable. Insertion of each UTC leap second is usually decided about six months in advance by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), to ensure that the difference between the UTC and UT1 readings will never exceed 0.9 seconds.

This practice has proven disruptive, particularly in the twenty-first century and especially in services that depend on precise timestamping or time-critical process control. And since not all computers are adjusted by leap-second, they will display times differing from those that have been adjusted. After many years of discussions by different standards bodies, in November 2022, at the 27th General Conference on Weights and Measures, it was decided to abandon the leap second by or before 2035.

==History==

In about AD 140, Ptolemy, the Alexandrian astronomer, sexagesimally subdivided both the mean solar day and the true solar day to at least six places after the sexagesimal point, and he used simple fractions of both the equinoctial hour and the seasonal hour, none of which resemble the modern second. Muslim scholars, including al-Biruni in 1000, subdivided the mean solar day into 24 equinoctial hours, each of which was subdivided sexagesimally, that is into the units of minute, second, third, fourth and fifth, creating the modern second as of the mean solar day in the process. With this definition, the second was proposed in 1874 as the base unit of time in the CGS system of units. Soon afterwards Simon Newcomb and others discovered that Earth&#x27;s rotation period varied irregularly, so in 1952, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) defined the second as a fraction of the sidereal year. In 1955, considering the tropical year to be more fundamental than the sidereal year, the IAU redefined the second as the fraction of the 1900.0 mean tropical year. In 1956, a slightly more precise value of was adopted for the definition of the second by the International Committee for Weights and Measures, and in 1960 by the General Conference on Weights and Measures, becoming a part of the International System of Units (SI).

Eventually, this definition too was found to be inadequate for precise time measurements, so in 1967, the SI second was again redefined as 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation emitted by a caesium-133 atom in the transition between the two hyperfine levels of its ground state. That value agreed to 1 part in 1010 with the astronomical (ephemeris) second then in use. It was also close to of the mean solar day as averaged between years 1750 and 1892.

However, for the past several centuries, the length of the mean solar day has been increasing by about 1.4–1.7 ms per century, depending on the averaging time. By 1961, the mean solar day was already a millisecond or two longer than SI seconds. Therefore, time standards that change the date after precisely SI seconds, such as the International Atomic Time (TAI), would become increasingly ahead of time standards tied to the mean solar day, such as Universal Time (UT).

When the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) standard was instituted in 1960, based on atomic clocks, it was felt necessary to maintain agreement with UT, which, until then, had been the reference for broadcast time services. From 1960 to 1971, the rate of UTC atomic clocks was offset from a pure atomic time scale by the BIH to remain synchronized with UT2, a practice known as the &quot;rubber second&quot;. The rate of UTC was decided at the start of each year, and was offset from the rate of atomic time by −150 parts per 10 for 1960–1962, by −130 parts per 10 for 1962–63, by −150 parts per 10 again for 1964–65, and by −300 parts per 10 for 1966–1971. Alongside the shift in rate, an occasional 0.1 s step (0.05 s before 1963) was needed. This predominantly frequency-shifted rate of UTC was broadcast by MSF, WWV, and CHU among other time stations. In 1966, the CCIR approved &quot;stepped atomic time&quot; (SAT), which adjusted atomic time with more frequent 0.2 s adjustments to keep it within 0.1 s of UT2, because it had no rate adjustments. SAT was broadcast by WWVB among other time stations.

In 1972, the leap-second system was introduced so that the UTC seconds could be set exactly equal to the standard SI second, while still maintaining the UTC time of day and changes of UTC date synchronized with those of UT1. By then, the UTC clock was already 10 seconds behind TAI, which had been synchronized with UT1 in 1958, but had been counting true SI seconds since then. After 1972, both clocks have been ticking in SI seconds, so the difference between their displays at any time is 10 seconds plus the total number of leap seconds that have been applied to UTC as of that time; , 27 leap seconds have been applied to UTC, so the difference is 10 + 27 = 37 seconds. The most recent leap second was on December 31, 2016.

==Rationale==
Leap seconds are irregularly spaced because the Earth&#x27;s rotation speed changes irregularly. Indeed, the Earth&#x27;s rotation is quite unpredictable in the long term, which explains why leap seconds are announced only six months in advance.

A mathematical model of the variations in the length of the solar day was developed by F. R. Stephenson and L. V. Morrison, based on records of eclipses for the period 700 BC to 1623, telescopic observations of occultations for the period 1623 until 1967 and atomic clocks thereafter. The model shows a steady increase of the mean solar day by 1.70 ms (±0.05 ms) per century, plus a periodic shift of about 4 ms amplitude and period of about 1,500 yr. Over the last few centuries, rate of lengthening of the mean solar day has been about 1.4 ms per century, being the sum of the periodic component and the overall rate.

The main reason for the slowing down of the Earth&#x27;s rotation is tidal friction, which alone would lengthen the day by 2.3 ms/century. Other contributing factors are the movement of the Earth&#x27;s crust relative to its core, changes in mantle convection, and any other events or processes that cause a significant redistribution of mass. These processes change the Earth&#x27;s moment of inertia, affecting the rate of rotation due to the conservation of angular momentum. Some of these redistributions increase Earth&#x27;s rotational speed, shorten the solar day and oppose tidal friction. For example, glacial rebound shortens the solar day by 0.6 ms/century and the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake is thought to have shortened it by 2.68 microseconds.

It is a mistake, however, to consider leap seconds as indicators of a slowing of Earth&#x27;s rotation rate; they are indicators of the accumulated difference between atomic time and time measured by Earth rotation. The plot at the top of this section shows that in 1972 the average length of day was approximately seconds and in 2016 it was approximately seconds, indicating an overall increase in Earth&#x27;s rotation rate over that time period. Positive leap seconds were inserted during that time because the annual average length of day remained greater than SI seconds, not because of any slowing of Earth&#x27;s rotation rate.

In 2021, it was reported that Earth was spinning faster in 2020 and experienced the 28 shortest days since 1960, each of which lasted less than seconds. This caused engineers worldwide to discuss a negative leap second and other possible timekeeping measures, some of which could eliminate leap seconds. The shortest day ever recorded was 29 June 2022, at 1.59 milliseconds less than 24 hours. In a 2024 paper published in &quot;Nature&quot;, Duncan Agnew of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography projects that the water from increasing ice cap melting will migrate to the equator and thus cause the rate of rotation to slow down again.

==Procedure==
The scheduling of leap seconds was initially delegated to the Bureau International de l&#x27;Heure (BIH), but passed to the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) on 1 January 1988. IERS usually decides to apply a leap second whenever the difference between UTC and UT1 approaches 0.6 s, in order to keep the difference between UTC and UT1 from exceeding 0.9 s.

The UTC standard allows leap seconds to be applied at the end of any UTC month, with first preference to June and December and second preference to March and September. , all of them have been inserted at the end of either 30 June or 31 December. IERS publishes announcements every six months, whether leap seconds are to occur or not, in its &quot;Bulletin C&quot;. Such announcements are typically published well in advance of each possible leap second date – usually in early January for 30 June and in early July for 31 December. Some time signal broadcasts give voice announcements of an impending leap second.
Between 1972 and 2020, a leap second has been inserted about every 21 months, on average. However, the spacing is quite irregular and apparently increasing: there were no leap seconds in the six-year interval between 1 January 1999, and 31 December 2004, but there were nine leap seconds in the eight years 1972–1979. Since the introduction of leap seconds, 1972 has been the longest year on record: 366 days, 364 of which were 86,400 seconds long and two of which were 86,401 seconds long, for a total of 31,622,402 seconds.

Unlike leap days, which begin after 28 February, 23:59:59 local time, UTC leap seconds occur simultaneously worldwide; for example, the leap second on 31 December 2005, 23:59:60 UTC was 31 December 2005, 18:59:60 (6:59:60 p.m.) in U.S. Eastern Standard Time and 1 January 2006, 08:59:60 (a.m.) in Japan Standard Time.

When it is mandated, a positive leap second is inserted between second 23:59:59 of a chosen UTC calendar date and second 00:00:00 of the following date. The definition of UTC states that the last day of December and June are preferred, with the last day of March or September as second preference, and the last day of any other month as third preference. All leap seconds (as of 2019) have been scheduled for either 30 June or 31 December. The extra second is displayed on UTC clocks as 23:59:60. On clocks that display local time tied to UTC, the leap second may be inserted at the end of some other hour (or half-hour or quarter-hour), depending on the local time zone. A negative leap second would suppress second 23:59:59 of the last day of a chosen month so that second 23:59:58 of that date would be followed immediately by second 00:00:00 of the following date. Since the introduction of leap seconds, the mean solar day has outpaced atomic time only for very brief periods and has not triggered a negative leap second.

Recent changes to the Earth&#x27;s rotation rate have made it more likely that a negative leap second will be required before the abolition of leap seconds in 2035.

==Future==

The TAI and UT1 time scales are precisely defined, the former by atomic clocks (and thus independent of Earth&#x27;s rotation) and the latter by astronomical observations (that measure actual planetary rotation and thus the solar time at the IERS Reference Meridian at Greenwich). UTC (on which civil time is usually based) is a compromise, stepping with atomic seconds but periodically reset by a leap second to match UT1.

The irregularity and unpredictability of UTC leap seconds is problematic for several areas, especially computing (see below). With increasing requirements for timestamp accuracy in systems such as process automation and high-frequency trading, this raises a number of issues. Consequently, the long-standing practice of inserting leap seconds is under review by the relevant international standards body.

===Elimination proposals===

On 5 July 2005, the Head of the Earth Orientation Center of the IERS sent a notice to IERS Bulletins C and D subscribers, soliciting comments on a U.S. proposal before the ITU-R Study Group 7&#x27;s WP7-A to eliminate leap seconds from the UTC broadcast standard before 2008 (the ITU-R is responsible for the definition of UTC). It was expected to be considered in November 2005, but the discussion has since been postponed. Under the proposal, leap seconds would be technically replaced by leap hours as an attempt to satisfy the legal requirements of several ITU-R member nations that civil time be astronomically tied to the Sun.

A number of objections to the proposal have been raised. P. Kenneth Seidelmann, editor of the Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac, wrote a letter lamenting the lack of consistent public information about the proposal and adequate justification. In an op-ed for &quot;Science News&quot;, Steve Allen of the University of California, Santa Cruz said that the process has a large impact on astronomers.

At the 2014 General Assembly of the International Union of Radio Scientists (URSI), Demetrios Matsakis, the United States Naval Observatory&#x27;s Chief Scientist for Time Services, presented the reasoning in favor of the redefinition and rebuttals to the arguments made against it. He stressed the practical inability of software programmers to allow for the fact that leap seconds make time appear to go backwards, particularly when most of them do not even know that leap seconds exist. The possibility of leap seconds being a hazard to navigation was presented, as well as the observed effects on commerce.

The United States formulated its position on this matter based upon the advice of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which solicited comments from the general public. This position is in favor of the redefinition.

In 2011, Chunhao Han of the Beijing Global Information Center of Application and Exploration said China had not decided what its vote would be in January 2012, but some Chinese scholars consider it important to maintain a link between civil and astronomical time due to Chinese tradition. The 2012 vote was ultimately deferred. At an ITU/BIPM-sponsored workshop on the leap second, Han expressed his personal view in favor of abolishing the leap second, and similar support for the redefinition was again expressed by Han, along with other Chinese timekeeping scientists, at the URSI General Assembly in 2014.

At a special session of the Asia-Pacific Telecommunity meeting on 10 February 2015, Chunhao Han indicated China was now supporting the elimination of future leap seconds, as were all the other presenting national representatives (from Australia, Japan, and the Republic of Korea). At this meeting, Bruce Warrington (NMI, Australia) and Tsukasa Iwama (NICT, Japan) indicated particular concern for the financial markets due to the leap second occurring in the middle of a workday in their part of the world. Subsequent to the CPM15-2 meeting in March/April 2015 the draft gives four methods which the WRC-15 might use to satisfy Resolution 653 from WRC-12.

Arguments against the proposal include the unknown expense of such a major change and the fact that universal time will no longer correspond to mean solar time. It is also answered that two timescales that do not follow leap seconds are already available, International Atomic Time (TAI) and Global Positioning System (GPS) time. Computers, for example, could use these and convert to UTC or local civil time as necessary for output. Inexpensive GPS timing receivers are readily available, and the satellite broadcasts include the necessary information to convert GPS time to UTC. It is also easy to convert GPS time to TAI, as TAI is always exactly 19 seconds ahead of GPS time. Examples of systems based on GPS time include the CDMA digital cellular systems IS-95 and CDMA2000. In general, computer systems use UTC and synchronize their clocks using Network Time Protocol (NTP). Systems that cannot tolerate disruptions caused by leap seconds can base their time on TAI and use Precision Time Protocol. However, the BIPM has pointed out that this proliferation of timescales leads to confusion.

At the 47th meeting of the Civil Global Positioning System Service Interface Committee in Fort Worth, Texas, in September 2007, it was announced that a mailed vote would go out on stopping leap seconds. The plan for the vote was:
* April 2008: ITU Working Party 7A will submit to ITU Study Group 7 project recommendation on stopping leap seconds
* During 2008, Study Group 7 will conduct a vote through mail among member states
* October 2011: The ITU-R released its status paper, &quot;Status of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) study in ITU-R&quot;, in preparation for the January 2012 meeting in Geneva; the paper reported that, to date, in response to the UN agency&#x27;s 2010 and 2011 web-based surveys requesting input on the topic, it had received 16 responses from the 192 Member States with &quot;13 being in favor of change, 3 being contrary.&quot;
* January 2012: The ITU makes a decision.
In January 2012, rather than decide yes or no per this plan, the ITU decided to postpone a decision on leap seconds to the World Radiocommunication Conference in November 2015. At this conference, it was again decided to continue using leap seconds, pending further study and consideration at the next conference in 2023.

In October 2014, Włodzimierz Lewandowski, chair of the timing subcommittee of the Civil GPS Interface Service Committee and a member of the ESA Navigation Program Board, presented a CGSIC-endorsed resolution to the ITU that supported the redefinition and described leap seconds as a &quot;hazard to navigation&quot;.

Some of the objections to the proposed change have been addressed by its supporters. For example, Felicitas Arias, who, as Director of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM)&#x27;s Time, Frequency, and Gravimetry Department, was responsible for generating UTC, noted in a press release that the drift of about one minute every 60–90 years could be compared to the 16-minute annual variation between true solar time and mean solar time, the one hour offset by use of daylight time, and the several-hours offset in certain geographically extra-large time zones.

Proposed alternatives to the leap second are the leap hour, which requires changes only once every few centuries; and the leap minute, with changes coming every half-century.

On 18 November 2022, the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) resolved to eliminate leap seconds by or before 2035. The difference between atomic and astronomical time will be allowed to grow to a larger value yet to be determined. A suggested possible future measure would be to let the discrepancy increase to a full minute, which would take 50 to 100 years, and then have the last minute of the day taking two minutes in a &quot;kind of smear&quot; with no discontinuity. The year 2035 for eliminating leap seconds was chosen considering Russia&#x27;s request to extend the timeline to 2040, since, unlike the United States&#x27;s global navigation satellite system, GPS, which does not adjust its time with leap seconds, Russia&#x27;s system, GLONASS, does adjust its time with leap seconds.

ITU World Radiocommunication Conference 2023 (WRC-23), which was held in Dubai (United Arab Emirates) from 20 November to 15 December 2023 formally recognized the Resolution 4 of the 27th CGPM (2022) which decides that the maximum value for the difference (UT1-UTC) will be increased in, or before, 2035.

==Problems==

===Time difference and sequence calculations===
To compute the elapsed time in seconds between two given UTC dates requires the consultation of a table of leap seconds, which needs to be updated whenever a new leap second is announced. Since leap seconds are known only 6 months in advance, time intervals for UTC dates further in the future cannot be computed.

===Missing announcements===
Although BIPM announces a leap second 6 months in advance, most time distribution systems (SNTP, IRIG-B, PTP) announce leap seconds at most 12 hours in advance, sometimes only in the last minute and some even not at all (DNP3).

===Implementation differences===
Not all clocks implement leap seconds in the same manner. Leap seconds in Unix time are commonly implemented by repeating 23:59:59 or adding the time-stamp 23:59:60. Network Time Protocol (NTP) freezes time during the leap second, some time servers declare &quot;alarm condition&quot;. Other schemes &quot;smear&quot; time in the vicinity of a leap second, spreading out the second of change over a longer period. This aims to avoid any negative effects of a substantial (by modern standards) step in time. This approach has led to differences between systems, as leap smear is not standardized and several different schemes are used in practice.

===Textual representation===
The textual representation of a leap second is defined by BIPM as &quot;23:59:60&quot;. There are programs that are not familiar with this format and may report an error when dealing with such input.

===Binary representation===
Most computer operating systems and most time distribution systems represent time with a binary counter indicating the number of seconds elapsed since an arbitrary epoch; for instance, since 00:00:00 in POSIX machines or since 00:00:00 in NTP. This counter does not count positive leap seconds, and has no indicator that a leap second has been inserted, therefore two seconds in sequence will have the same counter value. Some computer operating systems, in particular Linux, assign to the leap second the counter value of the preceding, 23:59:59 second ( sequence), while other computers (and the IRIG-B time distribution) assign to the leap second the counter value of the next, 00:00:00 second ( sequence). Since there is no standard governing this sequence, the timestamp of values sampled at exactly the same time can vary by one second. This may explain flaws in time-critical systems that rely on timestamped values.

===Others===
Several models of global navigation satellite receivers have software flaws associated with leap seconds:

* Some older versions of Motorola Oncore VP, UT, GT, and M12 GPS receivers had a software bug that would cause a single timestamp to be off by a day if no leap second was scheduled for 256 weeks. On 28 November 2003, this happened. At midnight, the receivers with this firmware reported 29 November 2003, for one second and then reverted to 28 November 2003.
* Older Trimble GPS receivers had a software flaw that would insert a leap second immediately after the GPS constellation started broadcasting the next leap second insertion time (some months in advance of the actual leap second), rather than waiting for the next leap second to happen. This left the receiver&#x27;s time off by a second in the interim.
* Older Datum Tymeserve 2100 GPS receivers and Symmetricom Tymeserve 2100 receivers apply a leap second as soon as the a leap second notification is received, instead of waiting for the correct date. The manufacturers no longer supports these models and no corrected software is available. A workaround has been described and tested, but if the GPS system rebroadcasts the announcement, or the unit is powered off, the problem will occur again.
* Four different brands of navigational receivers that use data from BeiDou satellites were found to implement leap seconds one day early. This was traced to a bug related to how the BeiDou protocol numbers the days of the week.

Several software vendors have distributed software that has not properly functioned with the concept of leap seconds:

* NTP specifies a flag to inform the receiver that a leap second is imminent. However, some NTP server implementations have failed to set their leap second flag correctly. Some NTP servers have responded with the wrong time for up to a day after a leap second insertion.
* A number of organizations reported problems caused by flawed software following the leap second that occurred on 30 June 2012. Among the sites which reported problems were Reddit (Apache Cassandra), Mozilla (Hadoop), Qantas, and various sites running Linux.
* Despite the publicity given to the 2015 leap second, a small number of network failures occurred due to leap second-related software errors of some routers. Several older versions of the Cisco Systems Nexus 5000 Series Operating System NX-OS (versions 5.0, 5.1, 5.2) are affected by leap second bugs.

Some businesses and service providers have been impacted by leap-second related software bugs:

* In 2015, interruptions occurred with Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Netflix, Amazon, and Apple&#x27;s music streaming series Beats 1.
* Leap second software bugs in Linux reportedly affected the Amadeus Altéa airlines reservation system, used by Qantas and Virgin Australia, in 2015.
* Cloudflare was affected by a leap second software bug. Its DNS resolver implementation incorrectly calculated a negative number when subtracting two timestamps obtained from the Go programming language&#x27;s codice_1function, which then used only a real-time clock source. This could have been avoided by using a monotonic clock source, which has since been added to Go 1.9.
* The Intercontinental Exchange, parent body to 7 clearing houses and 11 stock exchanges including the New York Stock Exchange, chose to cease operations for 61 minutes at the time of the 30 June 2015, leap second.

There were misplaced concerns that farming equipment using GPS navigation during harvests occurring on 31 December 2016, would be affected by the 2016 leap second. GPS navigation makes use of GPS time, which is not impacted by the leap second.

Due to a software error, the UTC time broadcast by the NavStar GPS system was incorrect by about 13 microseconds on 25–26 January 2016.

==Workarounds==
The most obvious workaround is to use the TAI scale for all operational purposes and convert to UTC for human-readable text. UTC can always be derived from TAI with a suitable table of leap seconds. The Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) video/audio industry standards body selected TAI for deriving timestamps of media. 
IEC/IEEE 60802 (Time sensitive networks) specifies TAI for all operations. Grid automation is planning to switch to TAI for global distribution of events in electrical grids. Bluetooth mesh networking also uses TAI.

Instead of inserting a leap second at the end of the day, Google servers implement a &quot;leap smear&quot;, extending seconds slightly over a 24-hour period centered on the leap second. Amazon followed a similar, but slightly different, pattern for the introduction of the 30 June 2015, leap second, leading to another case of the proliferation of timescales. They later released an NTP service for EC2 instances which performs leap smearing. UTC-SLS was proposed as a version of UTC with linear leap smearing, but it never became standard.

It has been proposed that media clients using the Real-time Transport Protocol inhibit generation or use of NTP timestamps during the leap second and the second preceding it.

NIST has established a special NTP time server to deliver UT1 instead of UTC. Such a server would be particularly useful in the event the ITU resolution passes and leap seconds are no longer inserted. Those astronomical observatories and other users that require UT1 could run off UT1 – although in many cases these users already download UT1-UTC from the IERS, and apply corrections in software.

<doc id="18473" wikidata="Q87620" url="?curid=18473" title="Luca Pacioli">
<text>Luca Bartolomeo de Pacioli, [[Order of Friars Minor|O.F.M.]] (sometimes &quot;Paccioli&quot; or &quot;Paciolo&quot;; 1447 – 19 June 1517) was an Italian mathematician, Franciscan friar, collaborator with Leonardo da Vinci, and an early contributor to the field now known as accounting. He is referred to as the father of accounting and bookkeeping and he was the first person to publish a work on the double-entry system of book-keeping on the continent. He was also called Luca di Borgo after his birthplace, Borgo Sansepolcro, Tuscany.

==Life==

Luca Pacioli was born between 1446 and 1448 in the Tuscan town of Sansepolcro where he received an abbaco education. This was education in the vernacular (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the local tongue) rather than Latin and focused on the knowledge required of merchants. His father was Bartolomeo Pacioli; however, Luca Pacioli was said to have lived with the Befolci family as a child in his birth town Sansepolcro. He moved to Venice around 1464, where he continued his own education while working as a tutor to the three sons of a merchant. It was during this period that he wrote his first book, a treatise on arithmetic for the boys he was tutoring. Between 1472 and 1475, he became a Franciscan friar. Thus, he could be referred to as Fra (&#x27;Friar&#x27;) Luca.

In 1475, he started teaching in Perugia as a private teacher before becoming first chair in mathematics in 1477. During this time, he wrote a comprehensive textbook in the vernacular for his students. He continued to work as a private tutor of mathematics and was instructed to stop teaching at this level in Sansepolcro in 1491. In 1494, his first book, , was published in Venice. In 1497, he accepted an invitation from Duke Ludovico Sforza to work in Milan. There he met, taught mathematics to, collaborated, and lived with Leonardo da Vinci. In 1499, Pacioli and Leonardo were forced to flee Milan when Louis XII of France seized the city and drove out their patron. Their paths appear to have finally separated around 1506. Pacioli died at about the age of 70 on 19 June 1517, most likely in Sansepolcro, where it is thought that he had spent much of his final years.

==Mathematics==


Pacioli published several works on mathematics, including:
* (Ms. Vatican Library, Lat. 3129), a nearly 600-page textbook dedicated to his students at the University of Perugia where Pacioli taught from 1477 to 1480. The manuscript was written between December 1477 and 29 April 1478. It contains 16 sections on merchant arithmetic, such as barter, exchange, profit, mixing metals, and algebra, though 25 pages from the chapter on algebra are missing. A modern transcription was published by Calzoni and Cavazzoni (1996) along with a partial translation of the chapter on partitioning problems.
* (Venice 1494), a textbook for use in the schools of Northern Italy. It was a synthesis of the mathematical knowledge of his time and contained the first printed work on algebra written in the vernacular (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the spoken language of the day). It is also notable for including one of the first published descriptions of the bookkeeping method that Venetian merchants used during the Italian Renaissance, known as the double-entry accounting system. The system he published included most of the accounting cycle as we know it today. He described the use of journals and ledgers and warned that a person should not go to sleep at night until the debits equalled the credits. His ledger had accounts for assets (including receivables and inventories), liabilities, capital, income, and expenses – the account categories that are reported on an organization&#x27;s balance sheet and income statement, respectively. He demonstrated year-end closing entries and proposed that a trial balance be used to prove a balanced ledger. Additionally, his treatise touches on a wide range of related topics from accounting ethics to cost accounting. He introduced the Rule of 72, using an approximation of 100*ln 2 more than 100 years before Napier and Briggs. Its exercises were largely copied without credit from Piero della Francesca&#x27;s earlier book, &quot;Trattato d&#x27;abaco&quot;.
* (Ms. Università degli Studi di Bologna, 1496–1508), a treatise on mathematics and magic. Written between 1496 and 1508, it contains the first reference to card tricks as well as guidance on how to juggle, eat fire, and make coins dance. It is the first work to note that Leonardo was left-handed. &quot;De viribus quantitatis&quot; is divided into three sections: Mathematical problems, puzzles, and tricks, along with a collection of proverbs and verses. The book has been described as the &quot;Foundation of modern magic and numerical puzzles,&quot; but it was never published and sat in the archives of the University of Bologna, where it was seen by only a small number of scholars during the Middle Ages. The book was rediscovered after David Singmaster, a mathematician, came across a reference to it in a 19th-century manuscript. An English translation was published for the first time in 2007.
* &quot;Geometry&quot; (1509), a Latin translation of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;.
* &quot;Divina proportione&quot; (written in Milan in 1496–1498, published in Venice in 1509). Two versions of the original manuscript are extant, one in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, the other in the Bibliothèque Publique et Universitaire in Geneva. The subject was mathematical and artistic proportion, especially the mathematics of the golden ratio and its application in architecture. It incorporates without credit a translation of the entire book &quot;De quinque corporibus regularibus&quot; by Piero della Francesca. Leonardo da Vinci drew the illustrations of the regular solids in &quot;Divina proportione&quot; while he lived with and took mathematics lessons from Pacioli. Leonardo&#x27;s drawings are probably the first illustrations of skeletal solids, which allowed an easy distinction between front and back. The work also discusses the use of perspective by painters such as Piero della Francesca, Melozzo da Forlì, and Marco Palmezzano.

===Translation of Piero della Francesca&#x27;s work===
The majority of the second volume of was a slightly rewritten version of one of Piero della Francesca&#x27;s works. The third volume of Pacioli&#x27;s &quot;Divina proportione&quot; was an Italian translation of Piero della Francesca&#x27;s Latin book &quot;De quinque corporibus regularibus&quot;. In neither case did Pacioli include an attribution to Piero. He was severely criticized for this and accused of plagiarism by sixteenth-century art historian and biographer Giorgio Vasari. R. Emmett Taylor (1889–1956) said that Pacioli may have had nothing to do with the translated volume &quot;Divina proportione&quot;, and that it may just have been appended to his work. However, no such defense can be presented concerning the inclusion of Piero della Francesca&#x27;s material in Pacioli&#x27;s Summa.

== Impact on accounting and business ==
Pacioli dramatically affected the practice of accounting by describing the double-entry accounting method used in parts of Italy. This revolutionized how businesses oversaw their operations, enabling improved efficiency and profitability. The &quot;Summa&quot;&#x27;s section on accounting was used internationally as an accounting textbook up to the mid-16th century. The essentials of double-entry accounting have for the most part remained unchanged for over 500 years. &quot;Accounting practitioners in public accounting, industry, and not-for-profit organizations, as well as investors, lending institutions, business firms, and all other users for financial information are indebted to Luca Pacioli for his monumental role in the development of accounting.&quot;

The ICAEW Library&#x27;s rare book collection at Chartered Accountants&#x27; Hall holds the complete published works of Luca Pacioli. Sections of two of Pacioli&#x27;s books, &#x27;Summa de arithmetica&#x27; and &#x27;Divina proportione&#x27; can be viewed online using Turning the Pages, an interactive tool developed by the British Library.

==Chess==
Around 1500, Pacioli wrote an unpublished treatise on chess, &quot;De ludo scachorum&quot; (&quot;On the Game of Chess&quot;). Long thought to have been lost, a surviving manuscript was rediscovered in 2006, in the 22,000-volume library of Count Guglielmo Coronini-Cronberg in Gorizia. A facsimile edition of the book was published in Pacioli&#x27;s home town of Sansepolcro in 2008. Based on Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s long association with the author and his having illustrated &quot;Divina proportione&quot;, some scholars speculate that Leonardo either drew the chess problems that appear in the manuscript or at least designed the chess pieces used in the problems.

<doc id="18474" wikidata="Q206489" url="?curid=18474" title="Lower Mainland">
<text>The Lower Mainland is a geographic and cultural region of the mainland coast of British Columbia that generally comprises the regional districts of Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley. Home to approximately 3.05million people as of the 2021 Canadian census, the Lower Mainland contains sixteen of the province&#x27;s 30 most populous municipalities and approximately 60% of the province&#x27;s total population.

The region was historically occupied by the Sto:lo, a Halkomelem-speaking people of the Coast Salish linguistic and cultural grouping.

==Boundaries==
Although the term &quot;Lower Mainland&quot; has been recorded from the earliest period of colonization in British Columbia, it has never been officially defined in legal terms. The term has historically been in popular usage for over a century to describe a region that extends from Horseshoe Bay south to the Canada–United States border and east to Hope at the eastern end of the Fraser Valley. This definition makes the term &quot;Lower Mainland&quot; almost synonymous with the regional districts of Metro Vancouver and Fraser Valley.

However, the British Columbia Geographical Names Information System (BCGNIS) comments that most residents of Vancouver might consider it to be only areas west of Mission and Abbotsford, while residents in the rest of the province consider it to be the Sea-to-Sky Corridor south of Whistler and west of Hope.

==Geography==

The region is bounded to the north by the Pacific Ranges and to the southeast by the Cascade Mountains, and is traversed from east to west by the Fraser River. Due to its consistency of climate, flora and fauna, geology and land use, &quot;Lower Mainland&quot; is also the name of an ecoregion—a biogeoclimatic region—that comprises the eastern part of the Georgia Depression and extends from Powell River on the Sunshine Coast to Hope at the eastern end of the Fraser Valley.

===Climate===
One of the mildest climates in Canada, the region has a mean annual temperature of with a summer mean of and a winter mean of . Annual precipitation ranges from an annual mean of in the west end to in the eastern end of the Fraser Valley and at higher elevations. Maximum precipitation occurs as rain in winter. Less than ten percent falls as snow at sea level but the amount of snowfall increases significantly with elevation.

==Demographics==

===Population===
As of the 2021 census, the population of the Lower Mainland core area totals 2,966,830:
* 2,642,825 in Metro Vancouver Regional District
* 324,005 in the Fraser Valley Regional District

These figures are slightly inflated due to the inclusion of areas within the regional districts which are not normally considered to be part of the Lower Mainland, notably the lower Fraser Canyon and the heads of Harrison and Pitt Lakes, which are within the FVRD, and Lions Bay and Bowen Island, which are within the Metro Vancouver Regional District.

===Ethnicity===

The Lower Mainland is among the most multicultural and diverse regions in Canada. 

As of 2021, Europeans form a plurality with 1,337,105 persons or 45.7 percent of the total population, followed by East Asians with 614,860 persons or 21.0 percent and South Asians with 422,880 persons or 14.5 percent.
===Religion===

The Lower Mainland includes large irreligious, Christian, and Sikh communities. The Sikh population, numbering over 265,000 persons or 9.1 percent of the total population is statistically significant across Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley; proportionally, it is more than four times the national average of 2.1 percent.
===Language===



==Regional districts==

Regional districts were first created across British Columbia from 1966 to 1967 to form bodies for inter-municipal coordination and to extend municipal-level powers to areas outside existing municipalities. Today, the Lower Mainland includes two regional districts: the Metro Vancouver Regional District (MVRD) and the Fraser Valley Regional District (FVRD). Both regional districts, however, include areas outside the traditional limits of the Lower Mainland. Metro Vancouver includes areas like Surrey and Langley that are geographically in the Fraser Valley.

The Metro Vancouver Regional District is made up of 21 municipalities. The MVRD is bordered on the west by the Strait of Georgia, to the north by the Squamish-Lillooet Regional District, on the east by the Fraser Valley Regional District, and to the south by Whatcom County, Washington, in the United States.

The Fraser Valley Regional District lies east of the Metro Vancouver Regional District, and comprises the cities of Abbotsford and Chilliwack, the district municipalities of Mission, Kent, and Hope, and the village of Harrison Hot Springs. It also includes many unincorporated areas in the Fraser Valley and along the west side of the Fraser Canyon (the Fraser Canyon is not in the Lower Mainland).

Regional district powers are very limited and other localized provincial government services are delivered through other regionalization systems.

==Indigenous territories==
The region was historically occupied by the Musqueam and Tsleil&#x27;waututh, and the southern portion was historically occupied by the Squamish. Its claims overlap those of the Tsleil-waututh, Musqueam, and Kwikwetlem. Other peoples who historically occupied the region are the , Chehalis, Katzie, Kwantlen, Tsawwassen, and Semiahmoo; many of their territories overlap with those of the Musqueam, and with each other. Many other peoples of the Georgia Strait region also frequented the lower Fraser, including those from Vancouver Island and what is now Whatcom County, Washington. Sto:lo &quot;traditional territory&quot;, known as &quot;Solh Temexw&quot; in Halkomelem, roughly coincides with the Lower Mainland, except for the inclusion of Port Douglas at the head of Harrison Lake, which is in In-SHUCK-ch territory, and the lands around Burrard Inlet.

==Health regions==
Health system services and governance in the Lower Mainland are provided by Vancouver Coastal Health, serving Vancouver, Richmond and the North Shore, and the mainland coast as far north as the Central Coast region, and Fraser Health, which serves the area of the Lower Mainland east of Vancouver and Richmond.

==Natural threats==

===Flooding===
The Lower Mainland is considered to have a high vulnerability to flood risk. There have been two major region-wide floods in 1894 and 1948, both associated with an extreme spring freshet of the Fraser River. Other major floods in the Lower Mainlandincluding June 1972, November 1990, and November 2021have been more localized, primarily impacting areas in the Fraser Valley like the Sumas Prairie, with comparatively minor impacts to Metro Vancouver. Prior to the 2021 flood, according to the Fraser Basin Council, scientists predicted a one-in-three chance of a similar-sized flood occurring in the next 50 years.

In the second quarter of 2007, the Lower Mainland was on high alert for flooding. Higher than normal snow packs in the British Columbia Interior prompted municipal governments to start taking emergency measures in the region. Dikes along the Fraser River are regulated to handle approximately at the Mission Gauge (the height above sea level of the dykes at Mission). Warmer than normal weather in the province&#x27;s Interior region caused large amounts of snow to melt prematurely, resulting in higher-than-normal water levels, which, nevertheless, remained well below flood levels.

Flooding can cover much of the Lower Mainland. Cloverdale, Barnston Island, low-lying areas of Maple Ridge, areas west of Hope, White Rock, Richmond, parts of Vancouver, and parts of Surrey are potentially at risk. In 2007, the Lower Mainland was largely spared, although northern regions of the province, along the Skeena and Nechako Rivers, experienced floods. Climate scientists predict that increasing temperatures will mean wetter winters and more snow at the high elevations. This will increase the likelihood of snowmelt floods.

The provincial government maintains an integrated flood hazard management program and extensive flood protection infrastructure in the Lower Mainland. The infrastructure consists of dikes, pump stations, floodboxes, riprap, and relief wells.

===Earthquakes===
While earthquakes are common in British Columbia and adjacent coastal waters, most are minor in energy release or are sufficiently remote to have little effect on populated areas. Nevertheless, earthquakes with a magnitude of up to 7.3 have occurred within of the Lower Mainland.

Based on geological evidence, however, stronger earthquakes appear to have occurred at approximately 600-year intervals. Therefore, there is a probability that there will be a major earthquake in the region within the next 200 years.

In April 2008, the United States Geological Survey released information concerning a newly found fault south of downtown Abbotsford, called the Boulder Creek Fault. Scientists now believe this fault is active and capable of producing earthquakes in the 6.8 magnitude range.

===Volcanoes===
Much of the Lower Mainland is vulnerable to explosive eruptions from the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. Volcanoes in this zone are capable of producing large quantities of volcanic ash that may cause short and long term water supply problems for Lower Mainland communities. All airports covered by the accompanying eruption column would be closed, heavy ash falls would damage electrical equipment and weak structures could collapse under the weight of the ash.

==Communities==
The Lower Mainland&#x27;s communities includes large cities in Metro Vancouver, and smaller cities, towns and villages along both banks of the Fraser River. Neighbourhoods within cities are not listed unless historically or otherwise notable and/or separate. Only some of the many Indian Reserves are listed.

<text>Lucius Afranius was an ancient Roman comic poet who lived at the beginning of the 1st century BC.

==Life==
Afranius&#x27; comedies described Roman scenes and manners (the genre called &quot;comoediae togatae&quot;) and the subjects were mostly taken from the life of the lower classes (&quot;comoediae tabernariae&quot;). They were considered by some ancients to be frequently polluted with disgraceful amours, which, according to Quintilian, were only a representation of the conduct of Afranius. He depicted, however, Roman life with such accuracy that he is classed with Menander, from whom indeed he borrowed largely. He imitated the style of Gaius Titius, and his language is praised by Cicero. His comedies are spoken of in the highest terms by the ancient writers, and under the Empire they not only continued to be read, but were even acted, of which an example occurs in the time of Nero. They seem to have been well known even at the latter end of the 4th century AD.

==Quintilian&#x27;s judgement==
The Spanish-Roman teacher of rhetoric Quintilian wrote of Afranius&#x27;s plays:

:&quot;Togātīs excellit Afrānius: utinam non inquināsset argūmenta puerōrum foedīs amōribus, mōrēs suōs fassus.&quot;
:(&quot;Afranius excelled in Roman-style comedies: if only he hadn&#x27;t polluted his plots with unseemly sexual affairs with boys, confessing his own habits.&quot;)

Such is the generally accepted interpretation of this sentence. An alternative view is proposed by Welsh (2010), who, noting that there is no trace of pederasty or any lewdness in any of the quoted fragments of Afranius, proposed to translate the sentence &quot;if only he hadn&#x27;t polluted his plots with disreputable love affairs (conducted) by boys&quot;, something which Quintilian perhaps thought unsuited to the moralising tone of Roman comedies. A problem with this interpretation, as Welsh himself admits, is that in Roman literature the word &quot;pueri&quot; is usually used for the boys who are object of love affairs, not the young men who conduct them.

==Surviving titles and fragments==
Afranius wrote many comedies. The titles of forty-two of his plays are still preserved, along with associated fragments and quotations:

<text>The Post Office Railway, known since 1987 as Mail Rail, is a narrow-gauge, driverless underground railway in London that was built by the Post Office with assistance from the Underground Electric Railways Company of London, to transport mail between sorting offices. Inspired by the Chicago Tunnel Company, it opened in 1927 and operated for 76 years until it closed in 2003. A museum within the former railway was opened in September 2017.

== Geography ==
The line ran from Paddington Head District Sorting Office in the west to the Eastern Head District Sorting Office at Whitechapel in the east, a distance of . It had eight stations, the largest of which was underneath Mount Pleasant, but by 2003 only three stations remained in use because the sorting offices above the other stations had been relocated.

==History==
===Use as post office railway===

In 1911, a plan evolved to build an underground railway long from Paddington to Whitechapel serving the main sorting offices along the route; road traffic congestion was causing unacceptable delays. The contract to build the tunnels was won by John Mowlem and Co. Construction of the tunnels started in February 1915 from a series of shafts. Most of the line was constructed using the Greathead shield system, with limited amounts of hand-mining for connecting tunnels at stations.

The main line has a single diameter tube with two tracks. Just before stations, tunnels diverge into two single-track diameter tunnels leading to two parallel diameter station tunnels. The main tube is at a depth of around . Stations are at a much shallower depth, with a 1-in-20 gradient into the stations. The gradients assist in slowing the trains when approaching stations, and accelerating them away. There is also less distance to lift mail from the stations to the surface. At Oxford Circus the tunnel runs close to the Bakerloo line tunnel of the London Underground. The tunnel also runs under Selfridges as the recent 2018 refurbishment of the building revealed.
During 1917, work was suspended due to the shortage of labour and materials. By June 1924, track laying had started. In February 1927, the first section, between Paddington and the West Central District Office, was made available for training. The line became available for the Christmas parcel post in 1927 and letters were carried from February 1928.

In 1954, plans were developed for a new Western District Office at Rathbone Place, which required a diversion, opening in 1958. It was not until 3 August 1965 that the new station and office were opened by the Postmaster General, Tony Benn. The disused section was used as a store tunnel; some parts of it still have the track in place.

In 1987, the railway changed its name to Mail Rail in celebration of its 60th anniversary, and some trains were rebuilt with more aerodynamic casings.

===Closure===
A Royal Mail press release in April 2003 said that the railway would be closed and mothballed at the end of May that year. Royal Mail had earlier stated that using the railway was five times more expensive than using road transport for the same task. The Communication Workers Union claimed the actual figure was closer to three times more expensive but argued that this was the result of a deliberate policy of running the railway down and using it at only one-third of its capacity. A local governmental report by the Greater London Authority stated that the &quot;line carries an average of four million letters and parcels per day&quot; and was in support of continued use and criticized the increase of lorries on local roads, estimated to be 80 more truck loads per week. The railway was closed on 31 May 2003.

In April 2011, an urban exploration group called the &quot;Consolidation Crew&quot; published accounts of illicit access to the tunnels. Detailed photography and text revealed that the railway is still largely in good condition, despite some natural decay. More recently, media have been admitted to the tunnels as part of the pre-launch publicity for the Postal Museum. Photographs show much of the infrastructure in place.

A team from the University of Cambridge has taken over a short, double track section of unused Post Office tunnel near Liverpool Street Station, where a newly built tunnel for Crossrail is situated some two metres beneath. The study is to establish how the original cast-iron lining sections, which are similar to those used for many miles of railway under London, resist possible deformation and soil movement caused by the new works. Digital cameras, fibre optic deformation sensors, laser scanners and other low-cost instruments, reporting in real time, have been installed in the vacated tunnel. As well as providing information about the behaviour of the old construction materials, the scheme can also provide an early warning if the new tunnel bores are creating dangerous soil movement.

===Redevelopment and preservation===

In October 2013, the British Postal Museum &amp; Archive announced that it intended opening part of the network to the public. After approval was granted by Islington Council, work on the new museum and the railway began in 2014. Special tourist trains were installed in late 2016. It was planned to open a circular route, running beneath the depot at Mount Pleasant with a journey time of around 15 minutes, by mid-2017. The museum opened on 5 September.

In its first year of operation (2017–2018), the trains performed 9,000 trips totalling , with the railway and museum hosting over 198,000 visitors.

==Rolling stock==
The first stock was delivered in 1926 with the opening of the system. All stock used was electrically powered.

==In fiction==
*The railway features in the novel &quot;The Horn of Mortal Danger&quot; by Lawrence Leonard in which there is a connecting tunnel to a secret railway to the North London network. The only other known connection is in the disused tunnel between Highgate and the disused Cranley Gardens.
*A version of the railway is featured in the novel &quot;The Great Game&quot; by Lavie Tidhar. It takes mail to Buckingham Palace, and is run by the book&#x27;s featured Simulacra.
*The railway appears in the film &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot; as &#x27;Poste Vaticane&#x27; in the Vatican City. Bruce Willis (as Hawk) stows away in one of the mail containers.
*A mail train system closely based on the railway is in Charlie Higson&#x27;s third &quot;Young Bond&quot; book, &quot;Double or Die&quot;.
*The railway is prominent in Oliver Harris&#x27;s 2014 book &quot;Deep Shelter&quot;.
*The railway features in Mark Leggatt&#x27;s 2016 novel &quot;The London Cage,&quot; as a means for Connor Montrose to move about London. The International Thriller, a follow-up to &quot;Names of the Dead&quot;,&quot; was&quot; published by Scottish-based publisher Fledgling Press in June 2016.
*The railways make an appearance in Adrian Tchaikovsky&#x27;s 2020 novel &quot;The Doors of Eden&quot; as Khan and Lee are being led by Stig towards a door to escape from pursuit by Rove&#x27;s henchmen.

==Similar railways==
A pneumatic underground railway was used by the Post Office in London between 1863 and 1874 using individual wheeled capsules, operated by the London Pneumatic Despatch Company.

In 1910, a tunnel railway opened in Munich, Germany between München Hauptbahnhof and the nearby Post office. The tunnels were damaged in World War II, restored in 1948 and partially rebuilt in 1966 to allow for the first Munich S-Bahn tunnel. Operations ceased in 1988.

Postal Telegraph and Telephone (Switzerland) opened the Post-U-Bahn (underground railway) in Zürich in 1938. It ran between Zürich Hauptbahnhof and the , Zürich&#x27;s main post office. The track gauge was 60 cm, and the small electric railcar, which could carry 250 kg of mail, collected power from wires between the tracks. Operations ceased on 11 October 1980 when a rubber-tired system replaced the train.

The Chicago Tunnel Company, in operation between 1906 and 1959, delivered freight, parcels, and coal, and disposed of ash and excavation debris. It operated an elaborate network of narrow-gauge track in tunnels running under the streets throughout the central business district including and surrounding the &quot;Loop&quot;.

<text>Lulach mac Gille Coemgáin (Modern Gaelic: &quot;Lughlagh mac Gille Chomghain&quot;, known in English simply as Lulach, and nicknamed Tairbith, &quot;the Unfortunate&quot; and Fatuus, &quot;the Simple-minded&quot; or &quot;the Foolish&quot;; c. 1032 – 17 March 1058) was King of Alba (Scotland) between 15 August 1057 and 17 March 1058.

Lulach was the son of Gruoch of Scotland, from her first marriage to Gille Coemgáin, Mormaer of Moray, and thus the stepson of Macbeth (Mac Bethad mac Findlaích). Through his mother, he was also the great-grandson of either Kenneth II or Kenneth III. Following the death of Macbeth at the Battle of Lumphanan on 15 August 1057, the king&#x27;s followers placed Lulach on the throne. He has the distinction of being the first king of Scotland of whom there are coronation details available: he was crowned, probably on 8 September 1057 at Scone. Lulach appears to have been a weak king, as his nicknames suggest, and ruled only for a few months before being assassinated and usurped by Malcolm III. However, it is also plausible his nicknames are the results of negative propaganda, and were established as part of a smear campaign by Malcolm III.

Lulach&#x27;s son Máel Snechtai was Mormaer of Moray, while Óengus of Moray was the son of Lulach&#x27;s daughter.

He is believed to be buried on Saint Columba&#x27;s Holy Island of Iona in or around the monastery. The exact position of his grave is unknown.

== Depictions in fiction ==
Lulach is an important secondary character in Dorothy Dunnett&#x27;s historical novel &quot;King Hereafter&quot;, where he is portrayed as a seer. In the novel, Dunnett used Lulach as a mouthpiece for researched information about the real Macbeth.

Lulach is also one of the protagonists in Jackie French&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel &quot;Macbeth and Son&quot; and in Susan Fraser King&#x27;s novel &quot;Lady MacBeth&quot;.

Lulach is also a character in David Greig&#x27;s play &quot;Dunsinane&quot; where he is hunted by the English soldiers as a threat to peace in Malcolm&#x27;s Scotland.

Lulach McPritchett in Modern Family, a Comedy series, is a Scottish warrior and ancestor of Jay Pritchett.

Lulach - misnamed Luach - appears in the animated series Gargoyles (TV series) as Macbeth and Gruoch&#x27;s son, and, briefly, King of Scotland.

Lulach appears in a 2024 adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s play called &quot;Gruoch and Macbeth: A Screenplay&quot; by Graham J. Howard.

Lulach appears in Val McDermid&#x27;s &quot;Queen Macbeth&quot;.

He is apparently referenced by Lady Macbeth (his mother&#x27;s counterpart in the play Macbeth), in Act I Scene VII, where she says she has &quot;given suck, and know / How tender &#x27;tis to love the babe that milks me&quot;, in what would be a historical reference to Lulach.

<text>Lexicography is the study of lexicons and the art of compiling dictionaries. It is divided into two separate academic disciplines:
* Practical lexicography is the art or craft of compiling, writing and editing dictionaries.
* Theoretical lexicography is the scholarly study of semantic, orthographic, syntagmatic and paradigmatic features of lexemes of the lexicon (vocabulary) of a language, developing theories of dictionary components and structures linking the data in dictionaries, the needs for information by users in specific types of situations, and how users may best access the data incorporated in printed and electronic dictionaries. This is sometimes referred to as &quot;metalexicography&quot;.

There is some disagreement on the definition of lexicology, as distinct from lexicography. Some use &quot;lexicology&quot; as a synonym for theoretical lexicography; others use it to mean a branch of linguistics pertaining to the inventory of words in a particular language.

A person devoted to lexicography is called a lexicographer and is, according to a jest of Samuel Johnson, a &quot;harmless drudge&quot;.

== Focus ==
Generally, lexicography focuses on the design, compilation, use and evaluation of general dictionaries, i.e. dictionaries that provide a description of the language in general use. Such a dictionary is usually called a general dictionary or LGP dictionary (Language for General Purpose). Specialized lexicography focuses on the design, compilation, use and evaluation of specialized dictionaries, i.e. dictionaries that are devoted to a (relatively restricted) set of linguistic and factual elements of one or more specialist subject fields, e.g. legal lexicography. Such a dictionary is usually called a specialized dictionary or Language for specific purposes dictionary and following Nielsen 1994, specialized dictionaries are either multi-field, single-field or sub-field dictionaries.

It is now widely accepted that lexicography is a scholarly discipline in its own right and not a sub-branch of applied linguistics, as the chief object of study in lexicography is the dictionary (see e.g. Bergenholtz/Nielsen/Tarp 2009).

Lexicography is the practice of creating books, computer programs, or databases that reflect lexicographical work and are intended for public use. These include dictionaries and thesauri which are widely accessible resources that present various aspects of lexicology, such as spelling, pronunciation, and meaning.

Lexicographers are tasked with defining simple words as well as figuring out how compound or complex words or words with many meanings can be clearly explained. They also make decisions regarding which words should be kept, added, or removed from a dictionary. They are responsible for arranging lexical material (usually alphabetically) to facilitate understanding and navigation.

==Etymology==

Coined in English 1680, the word &quot;lexicography&quot; derives from the Greek λεξικογράφος (&quot;lexikographos&quot;), &quot;lexicographer&quot;, from λεξικόν (&quot;lexicon&quot;), neut. of λεξικός &quot;lexikos&quot;, &quot;of or for words&quot;, from λέξις (&quot;lexis&quot;), &quot;speech&quot;, &quot;word&quot; (in turn from λέγω (&quot;lego&quot;), &quot;to say&quot;, &quot;to speak&quot;) and γράφω (&quot;grapho&quot;), &quot;to scratch, to inscribe, to write&quot;.

==Aspects==
Practical lexicographic work involves several activities, and the compilation of well-crafted dictionaries requires careful consideration of all or some of the following aspects:
* profiling the intended users (i.e. linguistic and non-linguistic competences) and identifying their needs
* defining the communicative and cognitive functions of the dictionary
* selecting and organizing the components of the dictionary
* choosing the appropriate structures for presenting the data in the dictionary (i.e. frame structure, distribution structure, macro-structure, micro-structure and cross-reference structure)
* selecting words and affixes for systematization as entries
* selecting collocations, phrases and examples
* choosing lemma forms for each word or part of word to be lemmatized
* defining words
* organizing definitions
* specifying pronunciations of words
* labeling definitions and pronunciations for register and dialect, where appropriate
* selecting equivalents in bi- and multi-lingual dictionaries
* translating collocations, phrases and examples in bi- and multilingual dictionaries
* designing the best way in which users can access the data in printed and electronic dictionaries

One important goal of lexicography is to keep the lexicographic information costs incurred by dictionary users as low as possible. Nielsen (2008) suggests relevant aspects for lexicographers to consider when making dictionaries as they all affect the users&#x27; impression and actual use of specific dictionaries.

Theoretical lexicography concerns the same aspects as lexicography, but aims to develop principles that can improve the quality of future dictionaries, for instance in terms of access to data and lexicographic information costs. Several perspectives or branches of such academic dictionary research have been distinguished: &#x27;dictionary criticism&#x27; (or evaluating the quality of one or more dictionaries, e.g. by means of reviews (see Nielsen 1999), &#x27;dictionary history&#x27; (or tracing the traditions of a type of dictionary or of lexicography in a particular country or language), &#x27;dictionary typology&#x27; (or classifying the various genres of reference works, such as dictionary versus encyclopedia, monolingual versus bilingual dictionary, general versus technical or pedagogical dictionary), &#x27;dictionary structure&#x27; (or formatting the various ways in which the information is presented in a dictionary), &#x27;dictionary use&#x27; (or observing the reference acts and skills of dictionary users), and &#x27;dictionary IT&#x27; (or applying computer aids to the process of dictionary compilation).

One important consideration is the status of &#x27;bilingual lexicography&#x27;, or the compilation and use of the bilingual dictionary in all its aspects (see e.g. Nielsen 1994). In spite of a relatively long history of this type of dictionary, it is often said to be less developed in a number of respects than its unilingual counterpart, especially in cases where one of the languages involved is not a major language. Not all genres of reference works are available in interlingual versions, e.g. LSP, learners&#x27; and encyclopedic types, although sometimes these challenges produce new subtypes, e.g. &#x27;semi-bilingual&#x27; or &#x27;bilingualised&#x27; dictionaries such as Hornby&#x27;s &quot;(Oxford) Advanced Learner&#x27;s Dictionary English-Chinese&quot;, which have been developed by translating existing monolingual dictionaries (see Marello 1998).

== History ==
Traces of lexicography can be identified as early late 4th millennium BCE, with the first known examples being Sumerian cuneiform texts uncovered in the city of Uruk. Ancient lexicography usually consisted of word lists documenting a language&#x27;s lexicon. Other early word lists have been discovered in Egyptian, Akkadian, Sanskrit, and Eblaite, and take the shape of mono- and bilingual word lists. They were organized in different ways including by subject and part of speech. The first extensive glosses, or word lists with accompanying definitions, began to appear around 300 BCE, and the discipline begins to develop more steadily. Lengthier glosses started to emerge in the literary cultures of antiquity, including Greece, Rome, China, India, Sasanian Persia, and the Middle East. In 636, Isidore of Seville published the first formal etymological compendium. The word was first applied to this type of text by the late 14th century.

With the invention and spread of Gutenberg&#x27;s printing press in the 15th century, lexicography flourished. Dictionaries became increasingly widespread, and their purpose shifted from a way to store lexical knowledge to a mode of disseminating lexical information. Modern lexicographical practices began taking shape during the 18th and 19th centuries, led by notable lexicographers such as Samuel Johnson, Vladimir Dal, the Brothers Grimm, Noah Webster, James Murray, Peter Mark Roget, Joseph Emerson Worcester, and others.

During the 20th century, the invention of computers changed lexicography again. With access to large databases, finding lexical evidence became significantly faster and easier. Corpus research also enables lexicographers to discriminate different senses of a word based on said evidence. Additionally, lexicographers were now able to work nonlinearly, rather than being bound to a traditional lexicographical ordering like alphabetical ordering.

In the early 21st century, the increasing ubiquity of artificial intelligence began to impact the field, which had traditionally been a time-consuming, detail-oriented task. The advent of AI has been hailed by some as the &quot;end of lexicography&quot;. Others are skeptical that human lexicographers will be outmoded in a field studying the particularly human substance of language.

<text>Law enforcement is the activity of some members of the government or other social institutions who act in an organized manner to enforce the law by investigating, deterring, rehabilitating, or punishing people who violate the rules and norms governing that society. The term encompasses police, courts and corrections. These three components of the criminal justice system may operate independently of each other or collectively through the use of record sharing and cooperation. Throughout the world, law enforcement are also associated with protecting the public, life, property, and keeping the peace in society.

The concept of law enforcement dates back to ancient times, and forms of law enforcement and police have existed in various forms across many human societies. Modern state legal codes use the term law enforcement officer or peace officer to include every person vested by the legislating state with police power or authority; traditionally, anyone sworn or badged who can arrest any person for a violation of criminal law is included under the umbrella term of law enforcement.

Although law enforcement may be most concerned with the prevention and punishment of crimes, organizations exist to discourage a wide variety of non-criminal violations of rules and norms, effected through the imposition of less severe consequences such as probation.

== History ==


Law enforcement organizations existed in ancient times, such as prefects in ancient China, &quot;paqūdus&quot; in Babylonia, &quot;curaca&quot; in the Inca Empire, &quot;vigiles&quot; in the Roman Empire, and Medjay in ancient Egypt. Who law enforcers were and reported to depended on the civilization and often changed over time, but they were typically enslaved people, soldiers, officers of a judge, or hired by settlements and households. Aside from their duties to enforce laws, many ancient law enforcers also served as slave catchers, firefighters, watchmen, city guards, and bodyguards.

By the post-classical period and the Middle Ages, forces such as the Santa Hermandades, the s&quot;hurta&quot;, and the &quot;Maréchaussée&quot; provided services ranging from law enforcement and personal protection to customs enforcement and waste collection. In England, a complex law enforcement system emerged, where tithings, groups of ten families, were responsible for ensuring good behavior and apprehending criminals; groups of ten tithings (&quot;hundreds&quot;) were overseen by a reeve; hundreds were governed by administrative divisions known as shires; and shires were overseen by shire-reeves. In feudal Japan, samurai were responsible for enforcing laws.

The concept of police as the primary law enforcement organization originated in Europe in the early modern period; the first statutory police force was the High Constables of Edinburgh in 1611, while the first organized police force was the Paris &quot;lieutenant général de police&quot; in 1667. Until the 18th century, law enforcement in England was mostly the responsibility of private citizens and thief-takers, albeit also including constables and watchmen. This system gradually shifted to government control following the 1749 establishment of the London Bow Street Runners, the first formal police force in Britain. In 1800, Napoleon reorganized French law enforcement to form the Paris Police Prefecture; the British government passed the Glasgow Police Act, establishing the City of Glasgow Police; and the Thames River Police was formed in England to combat theft on the River Thames. In September 1829, Robert Peel merged the Bow Street Runners and the Thames River Police to form the Metropolitan Police. The title of the &quot;first modern police force&quot; has still been claimed by the modern successors to these organizations.

Following European colonization of the Americas, the first law enforcement agencies in the Thirteen Colonies were the New York Sheriff&#x27;s Office and the Albany County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, both formed in the 1660s in the Province of New York. The Province of Carolina established slave-catcher patrols in the 1700s, and by 1785, the Charleston Guard and Watch was reported to have the duties and organization of a modern police force. The first municipal police department in the United States was the Philadelphia Police Department, while the first American state police, federal law enforcement agency was the United States Marshals Service, both formed in 1789. In the American frontier, law enforcement was the responsibility of county sheriffs, rangers, constables, and marshals. The first law enforcement agency in Canada was the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary, established in 1729, while the first Canadian national law enforcement agency was the Dominion Police, established in 1868. By the 19th century, improvements in technology, greater global connections, and changes in the sociopolitical order led to the establishment of police forces worldwide. National, regional, and municipal civilian law enforcement agencies exist in practically all countries; to promote their international cooperation, the International Criminal Police Organization, also known as Interpol, was formed in September 1923. Technology has made an immense impact on law enforcement, leading to the development and regular use of police cars, police radio systems, police aviation, police tactical units, and police body cameras.

== Law enforcement agencies ==
Most law enforcement is conducted by some law enforcement agency, typically a police force. Civilians generally staff police agencies, which are typically not a military branch. However, some militaries do have branches that enforce laws among the civilian populace, often called gendarmerie, security forces, or internal troops. Social investment in enforcement through such organizations can be massive in terms of the resources invested in the activity and the number of people professionally engaged to perform those functions.

Law enforcement agencies are limited to operating within a specified jurisdiction. These are typically organized into three basic levels: national, regional, and municipal. However, depending on certain factors, there may be more or less levels, or they may be merged: in the United States, there are federal, state, and local police and sheriff agencies; in Canada, some territories may only have national-level law enforcement, while some provinces have national, provincial, and municipal; in Japan, there is a national police agency, which supervises the police agencies for each individual prefecture; and in Niger, there is a national police for urban areas and a gendarmerie for rural areas, both technically national-level. In some cases, there may be multiple agencies at the same level but with different focuses: for example, in the United States, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are both national-level federal law enforcement agencies, but the DEA focuses on narcotics crimes, while the ATF focuses on weapon regulation violations.

Various segments of society may have their own specialist law enforcement agency, such as the military having military police, schools having school police or campus police, or airports having airport police. Private police may exist in some jurisdictions, often to provide dedicated law enforcement for privately-owned property or infrastructure, such as railroad police for private railways or hospital police for privately-owned hospital campuses.
Depending on various factors, such as whether an agency is autonomous or dependent on other organizations for its operations, the governing body that funds and oversees the agency may decide to dissolve or consolidate its operations. Dissolution of an agency may occur when the governing body or the agent itself decides to end operations. This can occur due to multiple reasons, including criminal justice reform, a lack of population in the jurisdiction, mass resignations, efforts to deter corruption, or the governing body contracting with a different agency that renders the original agency redundant or obsolete. According to the International Association of Chiefs of Police, agency consolidation can occur to improve efficiency, consolidate resources, or when forming a new type of government.

<doc id="18488" wikidata="Q178066" url="?curid=18488" title="Libido">
<text>In psychology, libido (; ) is psychic drive or energy, usually conceived of as sexual in nature, but sometimes conceived of as including other forms of desire. The term &quot;libido&quot; was originally developed by Sigmund Freud, the pioneering originator of psychoanalysis. With direct reference to Plato&#x27;s Eros, the term initially referred only to specific sexual desire, later expanded to the concept of a universal psychic energy that drives all instincts and whose &quot;great reservoir is the id&quot;. The libido partly according to its synthesising, partly to its analytical aspect called &quot;life-&quot; and &quot;death-drive&quot; - thus becomes the source of all natural forms of expression: the behaviour of sexuality as well as striving for social commitment (&quot;maternal love instinct&quot; etc.), skin pleasure, food, knowledge and victory in the areas of species- and self-preservation.

In common or colloquial usage, a person&#x27;s overall sexual drive is often referred to as that person&#x27;s &quot;libido&quot;. In this sense, libido is influenced by biological, psychological, and social factors. Biologically, the sex hormones and associated neurotransmitters that act upon the nucleus accumbens (primarily testosterone, estrogen, and dopamine, respectively) regulate sex drive in humans. Sexual drive can be affected by social factors such as work and family; psychological factors such as personality and stress; also by medical conditions, medications, lifestyle, relationship issues, and age.

== Psychological perspectives ==
===Freud===

Sigmund Freud, who is considered the originator of the modern use of the term, defined libido as &quot;the energy, regarded as a quantitative magnitude... of those instincts which have to do with all that may be comprised under the word &#x27;love&#x27;.&quot; It is the instinctual energy or force, contained in what Freud called the id, the strictly unconscious structure of the psyche. He also explained that it is analogous to hunger, the will to power, and so on insisting that it is a fundamental instinct that is innate in all humans.

Freud pointed out that these libidinal drives can conflict with the conventions of civilised behavior, represented in the psyche by the superego. It is this need to conform to society and control the libido that leads to tension and anxiety in the individual, prompting the use of ego defenses which channel the psychic energy of the unconscious drives into forms that are acceptable to the ego and superego. Excessive use of ego defenses results in neurosis, so a primary goal of psychoanalysis is to make the drives accessible to consciousness, allowing them to be addressed directly, thus reducing the patient&#x27;s automatic resort to ego defenses.

Freud viewed libido as passing through a series of developmental stages in the individual, in which the libido fixates on different erogenous zones: first the oral stage (exemplified by an infant&#x27;s pleasure in nursing), then the anal stage (exemplified by a toddler&#x27;s pleasure in controlling his or her bowels), then the phallic stage, through a latency stage in which the libido is dormant, to its reemergence at puberty in the genital stage (Karl Abraham would later add subdivisions in both oral and anal stages.). Failure to adequately adapt to the demands of these different stages could result in libidinal energy becoming &#x27;dammed up&#x27; or fixated in these stages, producing certain pathological character traits in adulthood.

===Jung===
Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung identified the libido with psychic energy in general. According to Jung, &#x27;energy&#x27;, in its subjective and psychological sense, is &#x27;desire&#x27;, of which sexual desire is just one aspect. Libido thus denotes &quot;a desire or impulse which is unchecked by any kind of authority, moral or otherwise. Libido is appetite in its natural state. From the genetic point of view it is bodily needs like hunger, thirst, sleep, and sex, and emotional states or affects, which constitute the essence of libido.&quot; It is &quot;the energy that manifests itself in the life process and is perceived subjectively as striving and desire.&quot; Duality (opposition) creates the energy (or libido) of the psyche, which Jung asserts expresses itself only through symbols. These symbols may manifest as &quot;fantasy-images&quot; in the process of psychoanalysis, giving subjective expression to the contents of the libido, which otherwise lacks any definite form. Desire, conceived generally as a psychic longing, movement, displacement and structuring, manifests itself in definable forms which are apprehended through analysis.

=== Other psychological and social perspectives ===
A person may have a desire for sex, but not have the opportunity to act on that desire, or may on personal, moral or religious reasons refrain from acting on the urge. Psychologically, a person&#x27;s urge can be repressed or sublimated. Conversely, a person can engage in sexual activity without an actual desire for it. Multiple factors affect human sex drive, including stress, illness, pregnancy, and others. A 2001 review found that, on average, men have a higher desire for sex than women.

Certain psychological or social factors can reduce the desire for sex. These factors can include lack of privacy or intimacy, stress or fatigue, distraction, or depression. Environmental stress, such as prolonged exposure to elevated sound levels or bright light, can also affect libido. Other causes include experience of sexual abuse, assault, trauma, or neglect, body image issues, and anxiety about engaging in sexual activity.

Individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may find themselves with reduced sexual desire. Struggling to find pleasure, as well as having trust issues, many with PTSD experience feelings of vulnerability, rage and anger, and emotional shutdowns, which have been shown to inhibit sexual desire in those with PTSD. Reduced sex drive may also be present in trauma victims due to issues arising in sexual function. For women, it has been found that treatment can improve sexual function, thus helping restore sexual desire. Depression and libido decline often coincide, with reduced sex drive being one of the symptoms of depression. Those with depression often report the decline in libido to be far reaching and more noticeable than other symptoms. In addition, those with depression often are reluctant to report their reduced sex drive, often normalizing it with cultural/social values, or by the failure of the physician to inquire about it.

Sexual desires are often an important factor in the formation and maintenance of intimate relationships in humans. A lack or loss of sexual desire can adversely affect relationships. Changes in the sexual desires of any partner in a sexual relationship, if sustained and unresolved, may cause problems in the relationship. The infidelity of a partner may be an indication that a partner&#x27;s changing sexual desires can no longer be satisfied within the current relationship. Problems can arise from disparity of sexual desires between partners, or poor communication between partners of sexual needs and preferences.

== Biological perspectives ==
=== Endogenous compounds ===

Libido is governed primarily by activity in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway (ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens). Consequently, dopamine and related trace amines (primarily phenethylamine) that modulate dopamine neurotransmission play a critical role in regulating libido.

Other neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and sex hormones that affect sex drive by modulating activity in or acting upon this pathway include:
* Testosterone (directly correlated) – and other androgens
* Estrogen (directly correlated) – and related female sex hormones
* Progesterone (inversely correlated)
* Oxytocin (directly correlated)
* Serotonin (inversely correlated)
* Norepinephrine (directly correlated)
* Acetylcholine

==== Sex hormone levels and the menstrual cycle ====
A woman&#x27;s desire for sex is correlated to her menstrual cycle, with many women experiencing a heightened sexual desire in the several days immediately before ovulation, which is her peak fertility period, which normally occurs two days before and until two days after the ovulation. This cycle has been associated with changes in a woman&#x27;s testosterone levels during the menstrual cycle. According to Gabrielle Lichterman, testosterone levels have a direct impact on a woman&#x27;s interest in sex. According to her, testosterone levels rise gradually from about the 24th day of a woman&#x27;s menstrual cycle until ovulation on about the 14th day of the next cycle, and during this period the woman&#x27;s desire for sex increases consistently. The 13th day is generally the day with the highest testosterone levels. In the week following ovulation, the testosterone level is the lowest and as a result women will experience less interest in sex.

Also, during the week following ovulation, progesterone levels increase, resulting in a woman experiencing difficulty achieving orgasm. Although the last days of the menstrual cycle are marked by a constant testosterone level, women&#x27;s libido may get a boost as a result of the thickening of the uterine lining which stimulates nerve endings and makes a woman feel aroused. Also, during these days, estrogen levels decline, resulting in a decrease of natural lubrication.

Although some specialists disagree with this theory, menopause is still considered by the majority a factor that can cause decreased sexual desire in women. The levels of estrogen decrease at menopause and this usually causes a lower interest in sex and vaginal dryness which makes sex painful. However, the levels of testosterone increase at menopause and this may be why some women may experience a contrary effect of an increased libido.

=== Physical factors ===
Physical factors that can affect libido include endocrine issues such as hypothyroidism, the effect of certain prescription medications (for example flutamide), and the attractiveness and biological fitness of one&#x27;s partner, among various other lifestyle factors.

Anemia is a cause of lack of libido in women due to the loss of iron during the period.

Smoking tobacco, alcohol use disorder, and the use of certain drugs can also lead to a decreased libido. Moreover, specialists suggest that several lifestyle changes such as exercising, quitting smoking, lowering consumption of alcohol or using prescription drugs may help increase one&#x27;s sexual desire.

==== Medications ====
Some people purposefully attempt to decrease their libido through the usage of anaphrodisiacs. Aphrodisiacs, such as dopaminergic psychostimulants, are a class of drugs which can increase libido. On the other hand, a reduced libido is also often iatrogenic and can be caused by many medications, such as hormonal contraception, SSRIs and other antidepressants, antipsychotics, opioids, beta blockers and isotretinoin.

Isotretinoin, finasteride and many SSRIs uncommonly can cause a long-term decrease in libido and overall sexual function, sometimes lasting for months or years after users of these drugs have stopped taking them. These long-lasting effects have been classified as iatrogenic medical disorders, respectively termed post-retinoid sexual dysfunction/post-Accutane syndrome (PRSD/PAS), post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) and post-SSRI sexual dysfunction (PSSD). These three disorders share many overlapping symptoms in addition to reduced libido, and are thought to share a common etiology, but collectively remain poorly-understood and lack effective treatments.

Multiple studies have shown that with the exception of bupropion (Wellbutrin), trazodone (Desyrel) and nefazodone (Serzone), antidepressants generally will lead to lowered libido. SSRIs that typically lead to decreased libido are fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), fluvoxamine (Luvox), citalopram (Celexa) and sertraline (Zoloft). Lowering the dosage of SSRI medications has been shown to improve libido in some patients. Other users try enrolling in psychotherapy to solve depression-related issues of libido. However, the effectiveness of this therapy is mixed, with many reporting that it had no or little effect on sexual drive.

Testosterone is one of the hormones controlling libido in human beings. Emerging research is showing that hormonal contraception methods like oral contraceptive pills (which rely on estrogen and progesterone together) are causing low libido in females by elevating levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). SHBG binds to sex hormones, including testosterone, rendering them unavailable. Research is showing that even after ending a hormonal contraceptive method, SHBG levels remain elevated and no reliable data exists to predict when this phenomenon will diminish.

Oral contraceptives lower androgen levels in users, and lowered androgen levels generally lead to a decrease in sexual desire. However, usage of oral contraceptives has shown to typically not have a connection with lowered libido in women.

==== Effects of age ====
Males reach the peak of their sex drive in their teenage years , while females reach it in their thirties. The surge in testosterone hits the male at puberty resulting in a sudden and extreme sex drive which reaches its peak at age 15–16, then drops slowly over their lifetime. In contrast, a female&#x27;s libido increases slowly during adolescence and peaks in their mid-thirties.
Actual testosterone and estrogen levels that affect a person&#x27;s sex drive vary considerably.

Some boys and girls will start expressing romantic or sexual interest by age 10–12. The romantic feelings are not necessarily sexual, but are more associated with attraction and desire for another. For boys and girls in their preteen years (ages 11–12), at least 25% report &quot;thinking a lot about sex&quot;. By the early teenage years (ages 13–14), however, boys are much more likely to have sexual fantasies than girls. In addition, boys are much more likely to report an interest in sexual intercourse at this age than girls. Masturbation among youth is common, with prevalence among the population generally increasing until the late 20s and early 30s. Boys generally start masturbating earlier, with less than 10% boys masturbating around age 10, around half participating by age 11–12, and over a substantial majority by age 13–14. This is in sharp contrast to girls where virtually none are engaging in masturbation before age 13, and only around 20% by age 13–14.

People in their 60s and early 70s generally retain a healthy sex drive, but this may start to decline in the early to mid-70s. Older adults generally develop a reduced libido due to declining health and environmental or social factors. In contrast to common belief, postmenopausal women often report an increase in sexual desire and an increased willingness to satisfy their partner. Women often report family responsibilities, health, relationship problems, and well-being as inhibitors to their sexual desires. Aging adults often have more positive attitudes towards sex in older age due to being more relaxed about it, freedom from other responsibilities, and increased self-confidence. Those exhibiting negative attitudes generally cite health as one of the main reasons. Stereotypes about aging adults and sexuality often regard seniors as asexual beings, doing them no favors when they try to talk about sexual interest with caregivers and medical professionals. Non-western cultures often follow a narrative of older women having a much lower libido, thus not encouraging any sort of sexual behavior for women. Residence in retirement homes has effects on residents&#x27; libidos. In these homes, sex occurs, but it is not encouraged by the staff or other residents. Lack of privacy and resident gender imbalance are the main factors lowering desire. Generally, for older adults, being excited about sex, good health, sexual self-esteem and having a sexually talented partner can be factors.

== Sexual desire disorders ==

Sexual desire disorders are more common in women than in men, and women tend to exhibit less frequent and less intense sexual desires than men. Erectile dysfunction may happen to the penis because of lack of sexual desire, but these two should not be confused since the two can commonly occur simultaneously. For example, moderate to large recreational doses of cocaine, amphetamine or methamphetamine can simultaneously cause erectile dysfunction (evidently due to vasoconstriction) while still significantly increasing libido due to heightened levels of dopamine. Although conversely, excessive or very regular/repeated high-dose amphetamine use may damage leydig cells in the male testes, potentially leading to markedly lowered sexual desire subsequently due to hypogonadism. However, in contrast to this, other stimulants such as cocaine and even caffeine appear to lack negative impacts on testosterone levels, and may even increase their concentrations in the body. Studies on cannabis however seem to be exceptionally mixed, with some claiming decreased levels on testosterone, others reporting increased levels, and with some showing no measurable changes at all. This varying data seems to coincide with the almost equally conflicting data on cannabis&#x27; effects on sex drive as well, which may be dosage or frequency-dependent, due to different amounts of distinct cannabinoids in the plant, or based on individual enzyme properties responsible for metabolism of the drug. Evidence on alcohol&#x27;s effects on testosterone however invariably show a clear decrease, however (like amphetamine, albeit to a lesser degree); temporary increases in libido and related sexual behavior have long been observed during alcohol intoxication in both sexes, but likely most noticeable with moderation, particularly in males. Additionally, men often also naturally experience a decrease in their libido as they age due to decreased productions in testosterone.

The American Medical Association has estimated that several million US women have a female sexual arousal disorder, though arousal is not at all synonymous with desire, so this finding is of limited relevance to the discussion of libido. Some specialists claim that women may experience low libido due to some hormonal abnormalities such as lack of luteinising hormone or androgenic hormones, although these theories are still controversial.

<text>Larissa (; , , ) is the capital and largest city of the Thessaly region in Greece. It is the fifth-most populous city in Greece with a population of 148,562 in the city proper, according to the 2021 census. It is also capital of the Larissa regional unit. It is a principal agricultural centre and a national transport hub, linked by road and rail with the port of Volos, the cities of Thessaloniki and Athens. The municipality of Larissa has inhabitants, while the regional unit of Larissa reached a population of ().

Legend has it that Achilles was born here. Hippocrates, the &quot;Father of Medicine&quot;, died here. Today, Larissa is an important commercial, transportation, educational, agricultural and industrial centre of Greece. The city straddles the Pineios river and N.-NE. of the city are the Mount Olympus and Mount Kissavos.

==Mythology==

According to Greek mythology it is said that the city was founded by Acrisius, who was killed accidentally by his grandson, Perseus. There lived Peleus, the hero beloved by the gods, and his son Achilles.

In mythology, the nymph Larissa was a daughter of the primordial man Pelasgus.

The city of Larissa is mentioned in Book II of &quot;Iliad&quot; by Homer: &quot;Hippothous led the tribes of Pelasgian spearsmen, who dwelt in fertile Larissa—Hippothous, and Pylaeus of the race of Mars, two sons of the Pelasgian Lethus, son of Teutamus.&quot; In this paragraph, Homer shows that the Pelasgians, Trojan allies, used to live in the city of Larissa. It is likely that this city of Larissa was different to the city that was the birthplace of Achilles. The Larissa that features as a Trojan ally in the &quot;Iliad&quot; was likely to be located in the Troad, on the other side of the Aegean Sea.

==History==

===Antiquity===
====Pre-history====
Traces of Paleolithic human settlement have been recovered from the area, but it was peripheral to areas of advanced culture. The area around Larissa was extremely fruitful; it was agriculturally important and in antiquity was known for its horses.

====Archaic Era====

The name Larissa (Λάρισα &quot;Lárīsa&quot;) is in origin a Pelasgian word for &quot;fortress&quot;. There were many ancient Greek cities with this name.
The name of Thessalian Larissa is first recorded in connection with the aristocratic Aleuadai family. It was also a polis (city-state).

====Classical Era====
Larissa was a polis (city-state) during the Classical Era. Larissa is thought to be where the famous Greek physician Hippocrates and the famous philosopher Gorgias of Leontini died.
When Larissa ceased minting the federal coins it shared with other Thessalian towns and adopted its own coinage in the late fifth century BC, it chose local types for its coins. The obverse depicted the nymph of the local spring, Larissa, for whom the town was named; probably the choice was inspired by the famous coins of Kimon depicting the Syracusan nymph Arethusa. The reverse depicted a horse in various poses. The horse was an appropriate symbol of Thessaly, a land of plains, which was well known for its horses. Usually there is a male figure; he should perhaps be seen as the eponymous hero of the Thessalians, Thessalos, who is probably also to be identified on many of the earlier, federal coins of Thessaly.

Larissa, sometimes written Larisa on ancient coins and inscriptions, is near the site of the Homeric Argissa. It appears in early times, when Thessaly was mainly governed by a few aristocratic families, as an important city under the rule of the Aleuadae, whose authority extended over the whole district of Pelasgiotis. This powerful family possessed for many generations before 369 BC the privilege of furnishing the &quot;tagus&quot;, the local term for the &quot;strategos&quot; of the combined Thessalian forces. The principal rivals of the Aleuadae were the Scopadae of Crannon, the remains of which are about 14 miles south west.

Larissa was the birthplace of Meno, who thus became, along with Xenophon and a few others, one of the generals leading several thousands Greeks from various places, in the ill-fated expedition of 401 (retold in Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Anabasis&quot;) meant to help Cyrus the Younger, son of Darius II, king of Persia, overthrow his elder brother Artaxerxes II and take over the throne of Persia (Meno is featured in Plato&#x27;s dialogue bearing his name, in which Socrates uses the example of &quot;the way to Larissa&quot; to help explain to Meno the difference between true opinion and science (Meno, 97a–c); this &quot;way to Larissa&quot; might well be on the part of Socrates an attempt to call to Meno&#x27;s mind a &quot;way home&quot;, understood as the way toward one&#x27;s true and &quot;eternal&quot; home reached only at death, that each man is supposed to seek in his life).

The constitution of the town was democratic, which explains why it sided with Athens in the Peloponnesian War. In the neighbourhood of Larissa was celebrated a festival which recalled the Roman Saturnalia, and at which the slaves were waited on by their masters. As the chief city of ancient Thessaly, Larissa was taken by the Thebans and later directly annexed by Philip II of Macedon in 344. It remained under Macedonian control afterwards, except for a brief period when Demetrius Poliorcetes captured it in 302 BC.

====Hellenistic Era====

====Roman Era====
It was in Larissa that Philip V of Macedon signed in 197 BC a treaty with the Romans after his defeat at the Battle of Cynoscephalae, and it was there also that Antiochus III the Great, won a great victory in 192 BC. In 196 BC Larissa became an ally of Rome and was the headquarters of the Thessalian League.

Larissa is frequently mentioned in connection with the Roman civil wars which preceded the establishment of the Roman Empire and Pompey sought refuge there after the defeat of Pharsalus.

===Middle Ages===

Larissa was sacked by the Ostrogoths in the late 5th century, and rebuilt under the Byzantine emperor Justinian I.

In the eighth century, the city became the metropolis of the theme of Hellas. The city was captured in 986 by Tsar Samuel of Bulgaria, who carried off the relics of its patron saint, Saint Achilleios, to Prespa. It was again unsuccessfully besieged by the Italo-Normans under Bohemond I in 1082/3.

After the Fourth Crusade, the King of Thessalonica, Boniface of Montferrat, gave the city to Lombard barons, but they launched a rebellion in 1209 that had to be subdued by the Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders himself. The city was recovered by Epirus soon after.

=== Ottoman period ===
Larissa was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1386/87 and again in the 1390s, but only came under permanent Ottoman control in 1423, by Turahan Bey. Under Ottoman rule, the city was known as &quot;Yeni-şehir i-Fenari&quot;, &quot;new citadel&quot;. As the chief town and military base of Ottoman Thessaly, Larissa was a predominantly Muslim city. In 1521 (Hijri 927) the town had 693 Muslim and 75 Christian households; according to Gökbilgin (1956), it also included Albanian and Jewish communities. During Ottoman rule the administration of the Metropolis of Larissa was transferred to nearby Trikala where it remained until 1734, when Metropolitan Iakovos II returned the see from Trikala to Larissa and established the present-day metropolis of Larissa and Tyrnavos.

The town was noted for its trade fair in the 17th and 18th centuries, while the seat of the pasha of Thessaly was also transferred there in 1770. Larissa was the headquarters of Hursid Pasha during the Greek War of Independence. It was also renowned for its mosques (four of which were still in use in the late 19th century) and its muslim cemeteries.

The city remained a part of the Ottoman Empire until Thessaly became part of the independent Kingdom of Greece in 1881, except for a period where Ottoman forces re-occupied it during the Greco-Turkish War of 1897. In the late 19th century, there was still a small village in the outskirts of the town inhabited by Africans from Sudan, a curious remnant of the forces collected by Ali Pasha.

In the 19th century, the town produced leather, cotton, silk and tobacco. Fevers and agues were prevalent owing to bad drainage and the overflowing of the river; and the death rate was higher than the birth rate.

===Modern Greek era===
In 1881, the city, along with the rest of Thessaly, was incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece during the prime ministry of Alexandros Koumoundouros. On 31 August 1881 a unit of the Greek Army headed by General Skarlatos Soutsos entered the city. A considerable portion of the Turkish population emigrated into the Ottoman Empire at that point. In this new era the city starts gradually to expand and to be rebuilt by the Greek authorities.

During the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, the city was the headquarters of Greek Crown Prince Constantine. The flight of the Greek army from here to Farsala took place on April 23, 1897. Turkish troops entered the city two days later. After a treaty for peace was signed, they withdrew and Larissa remained permanently in Greece. This was followed by a further exodus of Turks in 1898. The Hassan Bey mosque (which was built in the early 16th century) was demolished in 1908.

During the Axis Occupation of the country, the Jewish community of the city (dated back to second BC, see Romaniotes) suffered heavy losses. Today in the city there is a Holocaust memorial and a synagogue.

=== After WWII ===
After WWII the city was expanded rapidly. Today Larissa is the fourth largest Greek city with many squares, taverns and cafes. It has three public hospitals with one being a military hospital. It hosts the Hellenic Air Force Headquarters and NATO Headquarters in Greece. It has a School of Medicine and a School of Biochemistry – Biotechnology and the third largest in the country Institute of Technology. It occupies the first place among Greek cities into green coverage rate per square-metre urban space and the first place with the highest percentance of bars-taverns-restaurants per capita in Greece. It also has two public libraries and five museums.

==Ecclesiastical history==
Christianity penetrated early to Larissa, though its first bishop is recorded only in 325 at the Council of Nicaea. St. Achillius of the fourth century, is celebrated for his miracles. Le Quien cites twenty-nine bishops from the fourth to the 18th centuries; the most famous is Jeremias II, who occupied the see until 733, when the Emperor Leo III the Isaurian transferred it from the jurisdiction of the Pope of Rome to the Patriarchate of Constantinople. In the first years of the tenth century it had ten suffragan sees; subsequently the number increased and about the year 1175 under the Emperor Manuel I Comnenus, it reached twenty-eight. At the close of the 15th century, under the Ottoman domination, there were only ten suffragan sees, which gradually grew less and finally disappeared.

Larissa is an Orthodox Metropolis of the Church of Greece.

It was also briefly a Latin archbishopric in the early 13th century, and remains a Latin Metropolitan (top-ranking) titular see of the Roman Catholic Church, which must not be confused with the Latin episcopal (low-ranking) titular see Larissa in Syria. Today there is a Catholic church in the city (Sacred Heart of Jesus).

<doc id="18491" wikidata="Q1480958" url="?curid=18491" title="Lead and follow">
<text>In some types of partner dance, lead and follow are designations for the two dancers&#x27; roles in a dance pairing. The leader is responsible for guiding the couple and initiating transitions to different dance steps and, in improvised dances, for choosing the dance steps to perform. The leader communicates choices to the follower, and directs the follower by means of subtle physical and visual signals, thereby allowing the pair to be smoothly coordinated.

The amount of direction given by the leader depends on several factors, including dance style, social context of the dance, and experience and personalities of the dancers. Traditionally, the male dance partner was the leader and the female dance partner was the follower. In the 21st century, it has become increasingly common to see partnerships that buck this dynamic, particularly in more socially progressive dance styles.

==Gender roles==
Traditionally, the male dance partner is the leader and the female dance partner is the follower, though this is not always the case, such as in Schottische danced in the Madrid style where women lead and men follow (although this is not totally true: during the dance there is an exchange of roles, the leader becomes the follower and vice versa). Many social dance forms have a long history of same-sex (e.g. tango) and role-crossing partnerships, and there have been some changes to the strict gendering of partner dances in some competition or performance contexts. An example is a &quot;Jack and Jack&quot; dance contest.

==Communication==
Partner dancing requires awareness and clear communication; this is essential both for safety and for the overall success of the dance. If following in the dance, it helps to maintain a centered readiness to the leader. This helps the follower be ready for cues both visually and physically. The leader in the dance will best support the follower by giving clear directions.

For the leader and follower to interact with each other, communication needs to occur between the dance couple. Dancers take cues through physical connection, with the follower using it to communicate feedback to the leader just as the leader uses it to suggest moves to the follower. The most accomplished dancers use connection as a line of communication which allows the leader to incorporate the follower&#x27;s ideas, abilities, and creative suggestions into their own styling and selection of moves.

In many partner dances, the leader&#x27;s steps differ from the follower&#x27;s. In face-to-face positions, the follower generally &quot;mirrors&quot; the leader&#x27;s footwork. For example, if the leader begins on their left foot, the follower will begin on their right foot. In choreographed pieces and other situations where the follower is in a tandem position or shadow position, the leader and follower will use the same footwork. Usually both partners move together as a unit, but in some dances the partners move in opposite directions - together and apart again.

In partner dancing, dancers seek to work together to create synchronized or complementary movements. The leader is largely responsible for &quot;initiating&quot; movement, whereas the follower&#x27;s role is to &quot;maintain&quot; this movement (though they may choose not to). This process can be described as involving the initiation of momentum or &#x27;energy&#x27; (by the leader) and then the subsequent maintenance, exaggeration, decreasing or dissolving of this momentum by both partners.
This momentum or energy may be manifested as movement (in its most obvious form), or in a range of more complex interactions between partners:
* Compression (where each partner &#x27;compress&#x27; the energy by bending joints and moving towards or &#x27;into&#x27; their partner, to varying degrees);
* Leverage (where one partner – usually the leader – exploits the development of compression or connection to shift their follower&#x27;s weight or to &#x27;ground&#x27; (develop &#x27;compression&#x27; downwards, with the contact their feet make with the floor) themselves more thoroughly before initiating movement);
* Tension (is the opposite of compression - partners moving away from each other but still in contact)

It is also helpful for dancers to regard their partners in terms of their &quot;points of balance&quot; to help the leader initiate movements for their follower. These points of balance include the front-facing side of the shoulders, the front facing side of the hips, and the follower&#x27;s center (the abdomen). If the leader wants to bring the follower close, the leader is to apply tension and draw the hand in and down toward the leader&#x27;s own hip; to send the follower away, the leader would guide the hand toward the follower and add compression, signaling the move away.

===Obstruction avoidance===
A general rule is that both leader and follower watch each other&#x27;s back in a dance hall situation. Collision avoidance is one of the cases when the follower is required to &quot;backlead&quot; or at least to communicate about the danger to the leader. In travelling dances, such as waltz, common follower signals of danger are an unusual resistance to the leader, or a slight tap by the shoulder. In open-position dances, such as swing or Latin dances, maintaining eye contact with the partner is an important safety communication link.

===Weight transfer===
For partner dancers, using weight transfers is a way for a leader to communicate a &#x27;lead&#x27; for a dance step to a follower.

In another example, for a leader to have their follower walk forwards while connected, the leader begins by taking his or her center back, indicating a backward walking move. As the partners&#x27; arms/points of contact move away from each other, they develop tension, which the follower may either break by dropping their arms or breaking the hold, or &#x27;follow&#x27; by moving.

A more experienced leader may realize (if only on an unconscious level) that the most effective execution of even this &quot;simple&quot; step is achieved by preparing for movement before the step begins.

The leader-follower connection facilitates this. The principles of leading and following are explored in contact improvisation of modern dance.

===Recovery from miscommunication===
Sometimes a miscommunication will occur between the leader and follower. Techniques of the recovery of connection and synchronization vary from dance to dance, but below are a few common examples.

*In dances without obligatory body contact (Latin, swing, hustle, American Smooth), free spin recovers from anything.
*In dances danced in body contact (waltz, tango, quickstep, foxtrot) it is very important to recover the feet match. To recover, leaders may initiate a well-known (i.e. basic) step with slightly exaggerated sideways shift of weight to force the follower to free the required foot. For example, in waltz or foxtrot one might end a measure in the open promenade position, as there would then be no doubt as to the direction of the movement and which foot to use at the beginning of the next measure.

==Lead==

===Methods to lead===
*Body lead
*Arm lead

====Body lead vs. arm lead====
A body lead occurs where the leader initiates a lead by moving their body, which moves their arm(s), and thus transmits a lead to the follower. &#x27;Body lead&#x27; means much the same as &#x27;weight transfer&#x27;.
An arm lead occurs where the leader moves their arm(s) without moving their body, or moves their body in a different direction to their arm.
While an &#x27;arm lead&#x27; without the transfer of weight (or movement of the body) on the part of the leader is often a marker of an inexperienced or poorly taught dancer, the process of leading and following, particularly at an advanced level, often involves the contrasting uses of weight transfers and &#x27;arm moves&#x27;. As an example, a leader may lead a follower back onto their right foot through the leader&#x27;s own weight transfer forwards onto their left foot; yet at the same time turn the follower&#x27;s torso to the left from above the hips.

===Techniques of leading===
The leader has to communicate the direction of the movement to the follower. Traditionally, the leader&#x27;s right hand is on the follower&#x27;s back, near the lowest part of the shoulder-blade. This is the strongest part of the back and the leader can easily pull the follower&#x27;s body inwards. To enable the leader to communicate a step forward (backward for the follower) the follower has to constantly put a little weight against the leader&#x27;s right hand. When the leader goes forward, the follower will naturally go backwards.

An important leading mechanism is the leader&#x27;s left hand, which usually holds the follower&#x27;s right hand. At no point should it be necessary for any partner to firmly grab the other&#x27;s hand. It is sufficient to press the hand or even only finger tips slightly against each other, the follower&#x27;s hand following the leader&#x27;s hand.

Another important leading mechanism is hip contact. Though not possible in traditional Latin dances like Rumba, Cha-cha, Tango Argentino because of partner separation, hip contact is a harmonious and sensual way of communicating movement to the partner, used primarily in Standard or Ballroom dances (English / slow waltz, European tango, quickstep etc.) and Caribbean dances.

==Follow==

===Types of follow===

*Active follow
*Passive follow

===Techniques of following===
===Backleading===
Backleading is when a follower is executing steps without waiting for, or contrary to the lead&#x27;s lead. Both are considered bad dancing habits because it makes the follower difficult to lead and dance with.

Backleading can be a teaching tool that is often used intentionally by an instructor when dancing with a student lead, in order to help them learn the desired technique.

Backleading sounds similar to &quot;hijacking&quot;, and indeed it is often used in place of &quot;hijacking&quot;. However the two terms have significant differences, stemming from intentions. The first difference is superficial; hijacking is usually an occasional &quot;outburst&quot; from the follower, who otherwise diligently follows the lead, while a &quot;backlead&quot; may refer to a consistent habit. The second difference is more significant; hijacking is an actual reversal of roles, meaning that the hijacker leads the leader and takes control of the dance, while backleading only takes care of the follower.

===Hijacking===
Sometimes the follower steals the lead and the couple reverses roles for some time. This is called &quot;hijacking&quot; (also known as &quot;lead stealing&quot;). Hijacking requires experience and good connection, since without proper timing it may look like sloppy dancing. A signal for hijacking is typically an unusually changed (mostly, increased) stress in the connection from the follower&#x27;s side. &quot;Unusually&quot; meaning more than typically required for the execution of the current step (by these partners). For a follower to hijack, they must be sure that the lead will understand or at least guess the follower&#x27;s intentions.

<doc id="18492" wikidata="Q111352" url="?curid=18492" title="Lexeme">
<text>A lexeme () is a unit of lexical meaning that underlies a set of words that are related through inflection. It is a basic abstract unit of meaning, a unit of morphological analysis in linguistics that roughly corresponds to a set of forms taken by a single root word. For example, in the English language, &quot;run&quot;, &quot;runs&quot;, &quot;ran&quot; and &quot;running&quot; are forms of the same lexeme, which can be represented as RUN.

One form, the lemma (or citation form), is chosen by convention as the canonical form of a lexeme. The lemma is the form used in dictionaries as an entry&#x27;s headword. Other forms of a lexeme are often listed later in the entry if they are uncommon or irregularly inflected.

== Description ==
The notion of the lexeme is central to morphology, the basis for defining other concepts in that field. For example, the difference between inflection and derivation can be stated in terms of lexemes:
* Inflectional rules relate a lexeme to its forms.
* Derivational rules relate a lexeme to another lexeme.

A lexeme belongs to a particular syntactic category, has a certain meaning (semantic value), and in inflecting languages, has a corresponding inflectional paradigm. That is, a lexeme in many languages will have many different forms. For example, the lexeme RUN has a present third person singular form &quot;runs&quot;, a present non-third-person singular form &quot;run&quot; (which also functions as the past participle and non-finite form), a past form &quot;ran&quot;, and a present participle &quot;running&quot;. (It does not include &quot;runner, runners, runnable&quot; etc.) The use of the forms of a lexeme is governed by rules of grammar. In the case of English verbs such as RUN, they include subject–verb agreement and compound tense rules, which determine the form of a verb that can be used in a given sentence.

In many formal theories of language, lexemes have subcategorization frames to account for the number and types of complements. They occur within sentences and other syntactic structures.

== Decomposition ==
A language&#x27;s lexemes are often composed of smaller units with individual meaning called morphemes, according to root morpheme + derivational morphemes + affix (not necessarily in that order), where:
* The root morpheme is the primary lexical unit of a word, which carries the most significant aspects of semantic content and cannot be reduced to smaller constituents.
* The derivational morphemes carry only derivational information.
* The affix is composed of all inflectional morphemes, and carries only inflectional information.

The compound root morpheme + derivational morphemes is often called the stem. The decomposition stem + can then be used to study inflection.

<doc id="18494" wikidata="Q23393" url="?curid=18494" title="Lord's Prayer">
<text>The Lord&#x27;s Prayer, also known by its incipit Our Father (, ), is a central Christian prayer attributed to Jesus. Two versions of this prayer are recorded in the gospels: a longer form within the Sermon on the Mount in the Gospel of Matthew, and a shorter form in the Gospel of Luke when &quot;one of his disciples said to him, &#x27;Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples. Regarding the presence of the two versions, some have suggested that both were original, the Matthean version spoken by Jesus early in his ministry in Galilee, and the Lucan version one year later, &quot;very likely in Judea&quot;. 

The first-century text &quot;Didache&quot; (at chapter VIII) reports a version closely resembling that of Matthew and the modern prayer. It ends with the Minor Doxology.

The prayer is used by most Christian denominations in their worship and, with few exceptions, the liturgical form is the Matthean version. It has been set to music for use in liturgical services. Although theological differences and various modes of worship divide Christians, according to Fuller Theological Seminary professor Clayton Schmit, &quot;there is a sense of solidarity in knowing that Christians around the globe are praying together[...] and these words always unite us.&quot;

== Texts ==
The text of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer shown here is from the New International Version (NIV).

Initial words on the topic from the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; teach that it &quot;is truly the summary of the whole gospel&quot;.

The first three of the seven petitions in Matthew address God; the other four are related to human needs and concerns. Matthew&#x27;s account alone includes the &quot;Your will be done&quot; and the &quot;Rescue us from the evil one&quot; (or &quot;Deliver us from evil&quot;) petitions. Both original Greek texts contain the adjective ; while controversial, &#x27;daily&#x27; has been the most common English-language translation of this word. Protestants usually conclude the prayer with a doxology (in some versions, &quot;For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, for ever and ever, Amen&quot;), a later addition appearing in some manuscripts of Matthew. Eastern Orthodox version is: For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and ever and forever. Amen.

== Relationship between the Matthaean and Lucan texts ==
In biblical criticism, the absence of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer in the Gospel of Mark, together with its occurrence in Matthew and Luke, has caused scholars who accept the two-source hypothesis (against other document hypotheses) to conclude that it is probably a &quot;logion&quot; original to the Q source. According to W.D. Davies and Dale Allison, it is also possible than one version was present in Q and another from the M source or the L source, though they do not view the notion that Luke&#x27;s version used Matthew as plausible. The common source of the two existing versions, whether Q or an oral or another written tradition, was elaborated differently in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke.

Marianus Pale Hera considers it unlikely that either of the two used the other as its source and that it is possible that they &quot;preserve two versions of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer used in two different communities: the Matthean in a Jewish Christian community and the Lucan in the Gentile Christian community&quot;. Davies and Allison find this theory to be possible as well. 

While there is no reason to doubt the origin of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer with Jesus, the prayer differs between Luke and Matthew. Luke&#x27;s is not as long and closer in wording, while Matthew&#x27;s is thematically more similar to the original. If either source built on the other, Joachim Jeremias attributes priority to Matthew on the grounds that &quot;in the early period, before wordings were fixed, liturgical texts were elaborated, expanded and enriched&quot;. On the other hand, Michael Goulder, Thomas J. Mosbo and Ken Olson see the shorter Lucan version as a reworking of the Matthaean text, removing unnecessary verbiage and repetition.

The Matthaean version has completely ousted the Lucan in general Christian usage. The following considerations are based on the Matthaean version.

== Greek texts ==

The majority percentage of the verbs are aorist imperatives. In the first part of the prayer there are third person passive imperatives, while in the last one there are second person active imperatives.

== Original Greek text and Syriac and Latin translations ==
===Standard edition of the Greek text===
The text given here is that of the latest edition of &quot;Greek New Testament&quot; of the United Bible Societies and in the Nestle-Aland . Most modern translations use a text similar to this one. Most older translations are based on a Byzantine-type text with in line 5 (verse 10) instead of , and in line 8 (verse 12) instead of , and adding at the end (verse 13) the doxology

===Standard edition of the Syriac text of the Peshitta===
The Classical Syriac vowels here transcribed as &quot;ê&quot;, &quot;ā&quot; and &quot;o/ō&quot; have been raised to &quot;i&quot;, &quot;o&quot; and &quot;u&quot; respectively in Western Syriac.

===Vulgata Clementina (1692)===
There are three editions of the Vulgate: the Clementine edition of the Vulgate, the , and the Stuttgart Vulgate. The Clementine edition varies from the in this place only in punctuation and in having in place of . The Stuttgart Vulgate has in place of ; in place of ; in place of ; and in place of .

The doxology associated with the Lord&#x27;s Prayer in Byzantine Greek texts is found in four Vetus Latina manuscripts, only two of which give it in its entirety. The other surviving manuscripts of the Vetus Latina Gospels do not have the doxology. The Vulgate translation also does not include it, thus agreeing with critical editions of the Greek text.

== English versions ==


There are several different English translations of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer from Greek or Latin, beginning around AD 650 with the Northumbrian translation. Of those in current liturgical use, the three best-known are:
* The translation in the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; (BCP) of the Church of England
* The slightly modernized &quot;traditional ecumenical&quot; form used in the Catholic, and (often with doxology) in many Protestant Churches
* The 1988 translation of the ecumenical English Language Liturgical Consultation (ELLC)
All these versions are based on the text in Matthew, rather than Luke, of the prayer given by Jesus.

===Book of Common Prayer, 1662===

===Traditional ecumenical version===

===1988 English Language Liturgical Consultation===

The concluding doxology (&quot;For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory for ever&quot;) is representative of the practice of concluding prayers with a short, hymn-like verse that exalts the glory of God. Older English translations of the Bible, based on late Byzantine Greek manuscripts, included it, but it is absent in the oldest manuscripts and is not considered to be part of the original text of Matthew 6:9–13. The translators of the 1611 King James Bible assumed that a Greek manuscript they possessed was ancient and therefore adopted the text into the Lord&#x27;s Prayer of the Gospel of Matthew. The use of the doxology in English dates from at least 1549 with the First Prayer Book of Edward VI which was influenced by William Tyndale&#x27;s New Testament translation in 1526.

In the Byzantine Rite, whenever a priest is officiating, after the Lord&#x27;s Prayer he intones this augmented form of the doxology, &quot;For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory: of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages.&quot;, and in either instance, reciter(s) of the prayer reply &quot;Amen&quot;.

The Catholic Latin liturgical rites have never attached the doxology to the end of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer. The doxology does appear in the Roman Rite Mass as revised in 1969. After the conclusion of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, the priest says a prayer known as the embolism. In the official International Commission on English in the Liturgy (ICEL) English translation, the embolism reads: &quot;Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil, graciously grant peace in our days, that, by the help of your mercy, we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress, as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Saviour, Jesus Christ.&quot; This elaborates on the final petition, &quot;Deliver us from evil.&quot; The people then respond to this with the doxology: &quot;For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours, now and forever.&quot;

==Analysis==
Augustine of Hippo gives the following analysis of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, which elaborates on Jesus&#x27; words just before it in the Gospel of Matthew: &quot;Your Father knows what you need before you ask him. Pray then in this way&quot; (Matthew 6:8–9):

This excerpt from Augustine is included in the Office of Readings in the Catholic Liturgy of the Hours.

Many have written biblical commentaries on the Lord&#x27;s Prayer. Contained below are a variety of selections from some of those commentaries.

===Introduction===
&quot;Our&quot; indicates that the prayer is that of a group of people who consider themselves children of God and who call God their &quot;Father&quot;. &quot;In heaven&quot; indicates that the Father who is addressed is distinct from human fathers on earth.

Augustine interpreted &quot;heaven&quot; (&quot;coelum&quot;, sky) in this context as meaning &quot;in the hearts of the righteous, as it were in His holy temple&quot;.

===First Petition===
Former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams explains this phrase as a petition that people may look upon God&#x27;s name as holy, as something that inspires awe and reverence, and that they may not trivialize it by making God a tool for their purposes, to &quot;put other people down, or as a sort of magic to make themselves feel safe&quot;. He sums up the meaning of the phrase by saying: &quot;Understand what you&#x27;re talking about when you&#x27;re talking about God, this is serious, this is the most wonderful and frightening reality that we could imagine, more wonderful and frightening than we can imagine.&quot;

Richard Challoner writes that: &quot;[t]his petition claims the first place in the Lord&#x27;s prayer [...]; because the first and principal duty of a Christian is, to love his God with his whole heart and soul, and therefore the first and principal thing he ought to desire and pray for is, the great honor and glory of God.&quot;

===Second Petition===
&quot;This petition has its parallel in the Jewish prayer, &#x27;May he establish his Kingdom during your life and during your days. In the gospels Jesus speaks frequently of God&#x27;s kingdom, but never defines the concept: &quot;He assumed this was a concept so familiar that it did not require definition.&quot; Concerning how Jesus&#x27; audience in the gospels would have understood him, George Eldon Ladd turns to the concept&#x27;s Hebrew biblical background: &quot;The Hebrew word &quot;malkuth&quot; [...] refers first to a reign, dominion, or rule and only secondarily to the realm over which a reign is exercised. [...] When &quot;malkuth&quot; is used of God, it almost always refers to his authority or to his rule as the heavenly King.&quot; This petition looks to the perfect establishment of God&#x27;s rule in the world in the future, an act of God resulting in the eschatological order of the new age.

The Catholic Church believes that, by praying the Lord&#x27;s prayer, a Christian hastens the Second Coming. Like the church, some denominations see the coming of God&#x27;s kingdom as a divine gift to be prayed for, not a human achievement. Others believe that the Kingdom will be fostered by the hands of those faithful who work for a better world. These believe that Jesus&#x27; commands to feed the hungry and clothe the needy make the seeds of the kingdom already present on earth (Lk 8:5–15; Mt 25:31–40).

Hilda C. Graef notes that the operative Greek word, &quot;basileia,&quot; means both kingdom and kingship (i.e., reign, dominion, governing, etc.), but that the English word kingdom loses this double meaning. Kingship adds a psychological meaning to the petition: one is also praying for the condition of soul where one follows God&#x27;s will.

Richard Challoner, commenting on this petition, notes that the kingdom of God can be understood in three ways: 1) of the eternal kingdom of God in heaven. 2) of the spiritual kingdom of Christ, in his Church upon earth. 3) of the mystical kingdom of God, in our souls, according to the words of Christ, &quot;The kingdom of God is within you&quot; (Luke 17:21).

===Third Petition===

According to William Barclay, this phrase is a couplet with the same meaning as &quot;Thy kingdom come.&quot; Barclay argues: &quot;The kingdom is a state of things on earth in which God&#x27;s will is as perfectly done as it is in heaven. ...To do the will of God and to be in the Kingdom of God are one and the same thing.&quot;

John Ortberg interprets this phrase as follows: &quot;Many people think our job is to get my afterlife destination taken care of, then tread water till we all get ejected and God comes back and torches this place. But Jesus never told anybody – neither his disciples nor us – to pray, &#x27;Get me out of here so I can go up there.&#x27; His prayer was, &#x27;Make up there come down here.&#x27; Make things down here run the way they do up there.&quot; The request that &quot;thy will be done&quot; is God&#x27;s invitation to &quot;join him in making things down here the way they are up there&quot;.

===Fourth Petition===

As mentioned earlier, the original word (&quot;epiousion&quot;), commonly characterized as &quot;daily&quot;, is unique to the Lord&#x27;s Prayer in all of ancient Greek literature. The word is almost a &quot;hapax legomenon&quot;, occurring only in Luke and Matthew&#x27;s versions of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, and nowhere else in any other extant Greek texts. While &quot;epiousion&quot; is often substituted by the word &quot;daily&quot;, all other New Testament translations from the Greek into &quot;daily&quot; otherwise reference &quot;hemeran&quot; (ἡμέραν, &quot;the day&quot;), which does not appear in this usage.

Jerome by linguistic parsing translated &quot;ἐπιούσιον&quot; (&quot;epiousion&quot;) as &quot;&quot;supersubstantialem&quot; in the Gospel of Matthew, but as &quot;cotidianum&quot;&quot; (&quot;daily&quot;) in the Gospel of Luke. This wide-ranging difference with respect to meaning of &quot;epiousion&quot; is discussed in detail in the current &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; in an inclusive approach toward tradition as well as a literal one for meaning: &quot;Taken in a temporal sense, this word is a pedagogical repetition of &#x27;this day&#x27;, to confirm us in trust &#x27;without reservation&#x27;. Taken in the qualitative sense, it signifies what is necessary for life, and more broadly every good thing sufficient for subsistence. Taken literally (&quot;epi-ousios&quot;: &#x27;super-essential&#x27;), it refers directly to the Bread of Life, the Body of Christ, the &#x27;medicine of immortality,&#x27; without which we have no life within us.&quot;

&quot;Epiousion&quot; is translated as &quot;supersubstantialem&quot; in the Vulgate Matthew 6:11 and accordingly as &quot;supersubstantial&quot; in the Douay–Rheims Bible Matthew 6:11.

Barclay M. Newman&#x27;s &quot;A Concise Greek-English Dictionary of the New Testament&quot;, published in a revised edition in 2010 by the United Bible Societies, has the following entry:
It thus derives the word from the preposition ἐπί (&quot;epi&quot;) and the verb εἰμί (&quot;eimi&quot;), from the latter of which are derived words such as οὐσία (&quot;ousia&quot;), the range of whose meanings is indicated in &quot;A Greek–English Lexicon&quot;.

===Fifth Petition===

Although Matthew 6:12 uses the term &quot;debts&quot;, most older English versions of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer use the term &quot;trespasses&quot;, while ecumenical versions often use the term &quot;sins&quot;. The last choice may be due to Luke 11:4, which uses the word &quot;sins&quot;, while the former may be due to Matthew 6:14 (immediately after the text of the prayer), where Jesus speaks of &quot;trespasses&quot;. As early as the third century, Origen of Alexandria used the word &quot;trespasses&quot; () in the prayer. 

The Latin form that was traditionally used in Western Europe has &quot;debita&quot; (&quot;debts&quot;), but most English-speaking Christians (except Scottish Presbyterians and some others of the Dutch Reformed tradition) use &quot;trespasses&quot;. For example, the Church of Scotland, the Presbyterian Church (USA), the Reformed Church in America, as well as some Congregational heritage churches in the United Church of Christ follow the version found in Matthew 6 in the King James Version (KJV), which in the prayer uses the words &quot;debts&quot; and &quot;debtors&quot;.

The Presbyterian and other Reformed churches tend to use the rendering &quot;forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors&quot;. Roman Catholics, Lutherans, Anglicans and Methodists are more likely to say &quot;trespasses... those who trespass against us&quot;. 

The &quot;debts&quot; form appears in the first English translation of the Bible, by John Wycliffe in 1395 (Wycliffe spelling &quot;dettis&quot;). The &quot;trespasses&quot; version appears in the 1526 translation by William Tyndale (Tyndale spelling &quot;treaspases&quot;). In 1549 the first &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; in English used a version of the prayer with &quot;trespasses&quot;. This became the &quot;official&quot; version used in Anglican congregations. On the other hand, the 1611 King James Version, the version specifically authorized for the Church of England, has &quot;forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors&quot;.

After the request for bread, Matthew and Luke diverge slightly. Matthew continues with a request for debts to be forgiven in the same manner as people have forgiven those who have debts against them. Luke, on the other hand, makes a similar request about sins being forgiven in the manner of debts being forgiven between people. The word &quot;debts&quot; () does not necessarily mean financial obligations, as shown by the use of the verbal form of the same word () in passages such as Romans 13:8. The Aramaic word &quot;ḥôbâ&quot; can mean &quot;debt&quot; or &quot;sin&quot;. This difference between Luke&#x27;s and Matthew&#x27;s wording could be explained by the original form of the prayer having been in Aramaic. The generally accepted interpretation is thus that the request is for forgiveness of sin, not of supposed loans granted by God. Asking for forgiveness from God was a staple of Jewish prayers (e.g., Penitential Psalms). It was also considered proper for individuals to be forgiving of others, so the sentiment expressed in the prayer would have been a common one of the time.

Anthony C. Deane, Canon of Worcester Cathedral, suggested that the choice of the word &quot;ὀφειλήματα&quot; (debts), rather than &quot;ἁμαρτίας&quot; (sins), indicates a reference to failures to use opportunities of doing good. He linked this with the parable of the sheep and the goats (also in Matthew&#x27;s Gospel), in which the grounds for condemnation are not wrongdoing in the ordinary sense, but failure to do right, missing opportunities for showing love to others.

&quot;As we forgive ...&quot;. Divergence between Matthew&#x27;s &quot;debts&quot; and Luke&#x27;s &quot;sins&quot; is relatively trivial compared to the impact of the second half of this statement. The verses immediately following the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, Matthew 6:14–15 show Jesus teaching that the forgiveness of our sin/debt (by God) is linked with how we forgive others, as in the Parable of the Unforgiving Servant Matthew 18:23–35, which Matthew gives later. R. T. France comments:

===Sixth Petition===
Interpretations of the penultimate petition of the prayer – not to be led by God into &quot;peirasmos –&quot; vary considerably. The range of meanings of the Greek word &quot;πειρασμός&quot; (&quot;peirasmos&quot;) is illustrated in New Testament Greek lexicons. In different contexts it can mean temptation, testing, trial, experiment. Although the traditional English translation uses the word &quot;temptation&quot; and Carl Jung saw God as actually leading people astray, Christians generally interpret the petition as not contradicting James 1:13–14: &quot;Let no one say when he is tempted, &#x27;I am being tempted by God&#x27;, for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one. But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire.&quot; Some see the petition as an eschatological appeal against unfavourable Last Judgment, a theory supported by the use of the word &quot;peirasmos&quot; in this sense in Revelation 3:10. Others see it as a plea against hard &quot;tests&quot; described elsewhere in scripture, such as those of Job. It is also read as: &quot;Do not let us be led (by ourselves, by others, by Satan) into temptations&quot;. Tertullian comments: &quot;For the completeness of so brief a prayer He added — in order that we should supplicate not touching the remitting merely, but touching the entire averting, of acts of guilt — Lead us not into temptation: that is, suffer us not to be led into it, by him (of course) who tempts; but far be the thought that the Lord should seem to tempt, as if He either were ignorant of the faith of any, or else were eager to overthrow it. Infirmity and malice are characteristics of the Devil...The final clause, therefore, is consonant, and interprets the sense of Lead us not into temptation; for this sense is, But convey us away from the Evil One.&quot; (&quot;On Prayer&quot;, Ch. VIII) Coherently, Saint Cyprian of Carthago translates Matthew 6:9 as follows: &quot;And suffer us not to be led into temptation; but deliver us from evil.&quot; (&quot;On the Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot;, n. 7)

Since it follows shortly after a plea for daily bread (i.e., material sustenance), it is also seen as referring to not being caught up in the material pleasures given. A similar phrase appears in Matthew 26:41 and Luke 22:40 in connection with the prayer of Jesus in Gethsemane.

Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, in a version of the Holy Bible which was not published before his death, used: &quot;And suffer us not to be led into temptation&quot;.

In a conversation on the Italian TV channel TV2000 on 6 December 2017, Pope Francis commented that the then Italian wording of this petition (similar to the traditional English) was a poor translation. He said &quot;the French&quot; (i.e., the Bishops&#x27; Conference of France) had changed the petition to &quot;Do not let us fall in/into temptation&quot;. He was referring to the 2017 change to a new French version, (&quot;Do not let us enter into temptation&quot;), but spoke of it in terms of the Spanish translation, (&quot;do not let us fall in/into temptation&quot;), that he was accustomed to recite in Argentina before his election as Pope. He explained: &quot;I am the one who falls; it&#x27;s not him [God] pushing me into temptation to then see how I have fallen&quot;. Anglican theologian Ian Paul said that such a proposal was &quot;stepping into a theological debate about the nature of evil&quot;.

In January 2018, after &quot;in-depth study&quot;, the German Bishops&#x27; Conference rejected any rewording of their translation of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer.

In November 2018, the Episcopal Conference of Italy adopted a new edition of the &quot;Messale Romano&quot;, the Italian translation of the Roman Missal. One of the changes made from the older (1983) edition was to render this petition as (&quot;do not abandon us to temptation&quot;). This was approved by Pope Francis; however, there are no current plans to make a similar change for the English translation . The Italian-speaking Union of Methodist and Waldensian Churches maintains its translation of the petition: (&quot;do not expose us to temptation&quot;).

===Seventh Petition===

Translations and scholars are divided over whether the final word here refers to &quot;evil&quot; in general or &quot;the evil one&quot; (the devil) in particular. In the original Greek, as well as in the Latin translation, the word could be either of neuter (evil in general) or masculine (the evil one) gender. Matthew&#x27;s version of the prayer appears in the Sermon on the Mount, in earlier parts of which the term is used to refer to general evil. Later parts of Matthew refer to the devil when discussing similar issues. However, the devil is never referred to as &quot;the evil one&quot; in any known Aramaic sources. While John Calvin accepted the vagueness of the term&#x27;s meaning, he considered that there is little real difference between the two interpretations, and that therefore the question is of no real consequence. Similar phrases are found in John 17:15 and Thessalonians 3:3.

===Doxology===

====Content====
The doxology sometimes attached to the prayer in English is similar to a passage in 1 Chronicles 29:11 – &quot;Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head above all.&quot; It is also similar to the paean to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon in Daniel 2:37 – &quot;You, O king, the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the might, and the glory&quot;.

The doxology has been interpreted as connected with the final petition: &quot;Deliver us from evil&quot;. The kingdom, the power and the glory are the Father&#x27;s, not of our antagonist&#x27;s, who is subject to him to whom Christ will hand over the kingdom after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power (1 Corinthians 15:24). It makes the prayer end as well as begin with the vision of God in heaven, in the majesty of his name and kingdom and the perfection of his will and purpose.

====Origin====
The doxology is not included in Luke&#x27;s version of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, nor is it present in the earliest manuscripts (papyrus or parchment) of Matthew, representative of the Alexandrian text, although it is present in the manuscripts representative of the later Byzantine text. Most scholars do not consider it part of the original text of Matthew. The Codex Washingtonianus, which adds a doxology (in the familiar text), is of the early fifth or late fourth century. New translations generally omit it except as a footnote.

The &quot;Didache&quot;, generally considered a first-century text, has a doxology, &quot;for yours is the power and the glory forever&quot;, as a conclusion for the Lord&#x27;s Prayer (&quot;Didache&quot;, 8:2). C. Clifton Black, although regarding the &quot;Didache&quot; as an &quot;early second century&quot; text, nevertheless considers the doxology it contains to be the &quot;earliest additional ending we can trace&quot;. Of a longer version, Black observes: &quot;Its earliest appearance may have been in Tatian&#x27;s &quot;Diatessaron&quot;, a second-century harmony of the four Gospels&quot;. The first three editions of the United Bible Societies text cited the &quot;Diatessaron&quot; for inclusion of the familiar doxology in Matthew 6:13, but in the later editions it cites the &quot;Diatessaron&quot; for excluding it. The &quot;Apostolic Constitutions&quot; added &quot;the kingdom&quot; to the beginning of the formula in the &quot;Didache&quot;, thus establishing the now familiar doxology.

====Varied liturgical use====
In the Byzantine Rite, whenever a priest is officiating, after the last line of the prayer he intones the doxology, &quot;For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory: of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages.&quot;, and in either instance, reciter(s) of the prayer reply &quot;Amen&quot;.

Adding a doxology to the Our Father is not part of the liturgical tradition of the Roman Rite nor does the Latin Vulgate of St. Jerome contain the doxology that appears in late Greek manuscripts. However, it is recited since 1970 in the Roman Rite Order of Mass, not as part of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer but separately as a response acclamation after the embolism developing the seventh petition in the perspective of the Final Coming of Christ.

In most Anglican editions of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, the Lord&#x27;s Prayer ends with the doxology unless it is preceded by the Kyrie eleison. This happens at the daily offices of Morning Prayer (Mattins) and Evening Prayer (Evensong) and in a few other offices.

The vast majority of Protestant churches conclude the Lord&#x27;s Prayer with the doxology.

==Use as a language comparison tool==
In the course of Christianization, one of the first texts to be translated between many languages has historically been the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, long before the full Bible would be translated into the respective languages. Since the 16th century, collections of translations of the prayer have often been used for a quick comparison of languages. The first such collection, with 22 versions, was &quot;Mithridates, de differentiis linguarum&quot; by Conrad Gessner (1555; the title refers to Mithridates VI of Pontus who according to Pliny the Elder was an exceptional polyglot).

Gessner&#x27;s idea of collecting translations of the prayer was taken up by authors of the 17th century, including Hieronymus Megiserus (1603) and Georg Pistorius (1621). in 1680 published an enlarged collection of 83 versions of the prayer, under the pseudonym of Thomas Ludeken, of which three were in fictional philosophical languages.
In 1700, Müller&#x27;s collection was re-edited by B. Mottus as &quot;Oratio dominica plus centum linguis versionibus aut characteribus reddita et expressa&quot;.
This edition was comparatively inferior, but a second, revised edition was published in 1715 by John Chamberlayne.
This 1715 edition was used by Gottfried Hensel in his &quot;Synopsis Universae Philologiae&quot; (1741) to compile &quot;geographico-polyglot maps&quot; where the beginning of the prayer was shown in the geographical area where the respective languages were spoken.
Johann Ulrich Kraus also published a collection with more than 100 entries.

These collections continued to be improved and expanded well into the 19th century; Johann Christoph Adelung and Johann Severin Vater in 1806–1817 published the prayer in &quot;well-nigh five hundred languages and dialects&quot;.

Samples of scripture, including the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, were published in 52 oriental languages, most of them not previously found in such collections, translated by the brethren of the Serampore Mission and printed at the mission press there in 1818.

==Indulgence==
===History===
In the Catholic Church, a rescript of Pope Pius VII and subsequent decree of the Pro-Vicar Cardinal of 18 April 1809 introduced a 300-day indulgence for whoever would recite with a contrite heart and devoutly, on behalf of a suffering faithful, three &quot;Our Fathers&quot; in memory of the Passion and agony of Jesus and three &quot;Hail Mary&quot;s in memory of the pains of the Virgin in the presence of her divine son. Furthermore, for those who would perform this pious practice at least once a day for a month, they granted plenary indulgence, and the remission of all sins on a day of their choice on which they had confessed, communicated, and prayed according to the intentions of the pope at the time. These indulgences were to be perpetual and could be applied to souls in Purgatory.

===After the Second Vatican Council===
This type of indulgence was suppressed by the &quot;Indulgentiarum Doctrina&quot; of Pope Paul VI.

In occasion of the 2020–2021 jubilee of Saint Joseph, Pope Francis signed a decree that granted the plenary indulgence to those who shall contemplate the Lord&#x27;s Prayer for at least 30 minutes.

==Comparisons with other prayer traditions==
The book &quot;The Comprehensive New Testament&quot;, by T. E. Clontz and J. Clontz, points to similarities between elements of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer and expressions in writings of other religions as diverse as the &quot;Dhammapada&quot;, the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, the &quot;Golden Verses&quot;, and the Egyptian &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;. It mentions in particular parallels in 1 Chronicles 29:10-18.

Rabbi Aron Mendes Chumaceiro says that nearly all the elements of the prayer have counterparts in the Jewish Bible and Deuterocanonical books: the first part in Isaiah 63:15-16 (&quot;Look down from heaven and see, from your holy and beautiful habitation... for you are our Father&quot;) and Ezekiel 36:23 (&quot;I will vindicate the holiness of my great name...&quot;) and 38:23 (&quot;I will show my greatness and my holiness and make myself known in the eyes of many nations...&quot;), the second part in Obadiah 1:21 (&quot;Saviours shall go up to Mount Zion to rule Mount Esau, and the kingdom shall be the L&#x27;s&quot;) and 1 Samuel 38:18 (&quot;...It is the L. Let him do what seems good to him.&quot;), the third part in Proverbs 30:8 (&quot;...feed me with my apportioned bread...&quot;), and the fourth part in Book of Sirach 28:2 (&quot;Forgive your neighbour the wrong he has done, and then your sins will be pardoned when you pray.&quot;). &quot;Deliver us from evil&quot; can be compared with Psalm 119:133 (&quot;...let no iniquity get dominion over me.&quot;).

Chumaceiro says that, because the idea of God leading a human into temptation contradicts the righteousness and love of God, &quot;Lead us not into temptation&quot; has no counterpart in the Jewish Bible/Christian Old Testament. However, the word &quot;πειρασμός&quot;, which is translated as &quot;temptation&quot;, can also be translated as &quot;test&quot; or &quot;trial&quot;, making evident the attitude of someone&#x27;s heart, and in the Old Testament God tested Abraham, and told David, &quot;Go, number Israel and Judah,&quot; an action that David later acknowledged as sin; and the testing of Job in the Book of Job.

Reuben Bredenhof says that the various petitions of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, as well as the doxology attached to it, have a conceptual and thematic background in the Old Testament Book of Psalms.

On the other hand, Andrew Wommack says that the Lord&#x27;s Prayer &quot;technically speaking... isn&#x27;t even a true New Testament prayer&quot;. The only evidence or argument he offers readers, however, is to &quot;notice that it&#x27;s not prayed in the name of Jesus.&quot; 

In post-biblical Jewish prayer, especially Kiddushin 81a (Babylonian). &quot;Our Father which art in heaven&quot; (אבינו שבשמים, &quot;Avinu shebashamayim&quot;) is the beginning of many Hebrew prayers. &quot;Our Father who art in heaven&quot; and &quot;hallowed be thy name&quot; are reflected in the Kaddish (where it says: &quot;May His great name be hallowed in the world which He created, according to His will, and may He establish His Kingdom...)&quot;. &quot;Lead us not into sin&quot; is echoed in the &quot;morning blessings&quot; of Jewish prayer. A blessing said by some Jewish communities after the evening &quot;Shema&quot; includes a phrase quite similar to the opening of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer: &quot;Our God in heaven, hallow thy name, and establish thy kingdom forever, and rule over us for ever and ever. Amen.&quot; None of these liturgical prayers, however, can be dated to before Jesus Christ.

==In popular culture==
As with other prayers, the Lord&#x27;s Prayer was used by cooks to time their recipes before the spread of clocks. For example, a step could be &quot;simmer the broth for three Lord&#x27;s Prayers&quot;.

American songwriter and arranger Brian Wilson set the text of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer to an elaborate close-harmony arrangement loosely based on Malotte&#x27;s melody. Wilson&#x27;s group, The Beach Boys, would return to the piece several times throughout their recording career, most notably as the B-side to their 1964 single &quot;Little Saint Nick.&quot; The band Yazoo used the prayer interspersed with the lyrics of &quot;In My Room&quot; on the album &quot;Upstairs at Eric&#x27;s&quot;.

In the 2002 movie &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, Norman Osborn as the &quot;Green Goblin&quot;, attacks and injures Aunt May while she is in the middle of saying the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, who then becomes hospitalized.

Beat Generation poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti wrote and performed a &quot;Loud Prayer&quot; parodying the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, one version of which was featured in the 1978 film &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;.

In July 2023, Filipino drag queen and former &quot;Drag Den&quot; contestant Pura Luka Vega drew controversy online for posting a video of themselves dressing up as Jesus Christ and dancing to a punk rock version of &quot;Ama Namin&quot;, the Filipino version of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer. The video was also condemned by several Philippine politicians and the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of the Philippines.

<text>Lightworks is a freemium non-linear editing system (NLE) for editing and mastering digital video. It was an early developer of computer-based non-linear editing systems, and has been in development since 1998. The development of an open-source version was announced on April 11, 2010. However, no source code of the program has been released. In July 2020, a Lightworks product manager confirmed that they &quot;still hope to announce something in the future&quot; about Lightworks&#x27; open source development.

== Features ==

The free version comes with a limited number of features:
* Multicam editing
* Second monitor output
* Ability to import a range of file types
* Export to Vimeo (H.264/MPEG-4) up to 720p 
* Export to YouTube (H.264/MPEG-4) up to 720p 

The free version cannot export to DVD or Blu-ray, but can export to a hard drive (since Lightworks 14).

== History ==
OLE Limited was founded in 1994 by Paul Bamborough, Nick Pollock and Neil Harris. In 1995 it was sold to Tektronix. In 1999 it was sold on to the newly formed Lightworks Inc., then owned by Fairlight Japan, and then purchased by Gee Broadcast in May 2004.

=== Gee Broadcast ownership, 2004–2009 ===
Under Gee Broadcast ownership, new product releases resumed with the release of the Lightworks &quot;Touch&quot; range, and the &quot;Alacrity&quot; and &quot;Softworks&quot; ranges for SD &amp; HD editing. Softworks offered the Lightworks User Interface and toolset in a software only package for laptops or office workstations. Alacrity supported dual outputs while the same facility was available for Softworks users as an option.

=== EditShare ownership, 2009–2020 ===
In August 2009, the UK and US based company &quot;EditShare&quot; acquired Gee Broadcast and the Lightworks editing platform from, along with their video server system &quot;GeeVS&quot;.

At the annual convention of the National Association of Broadcasters, NAB Show, on 11 April 2010, EditShare announced that they plan to transform Lightworks into Lightworks Open Source. It was presented at IBC in Amsterdam September 2010.

On 9 November 2010, EditShare announced that Lightworks would be downloadable on 29 November of the same year, at first exclusively for the users who had registered during the initial announcement, but subsequently publishing the software as &quot;public beta&quot;.

EditShare planned the release of the open source version in Q4 of 2011, after they finished code review. They plan to make money from proprietary plugins offered in their associated online shop, including plugins needed to access professional video formats. Shortly before the scheduled release date of 29 November 2011, EditShare announced that an open source release of the software would be temporarily delayed, but did not announce a new release date. The announcement noted that they were not yet satisfied with the stability of the new version.

==== Windows version released at NAB 2012 ====
After an 18-month beta program, EditShare released Lightworks 11, for Windows only, on 28 May 2012. The non beta release of Lightworks includes a host of new features for editors, and runs on wide range of PC hardware. The software was re-designed and re-written for portability (versions for Linux and Mac OS X have also been released) and now supports many more codecs including AVCHD, H.264, AVC-Intra, DNxHD, ProRes, Red R3D, DPX, XDCAM HD 50, XDCAM EX, DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K, but only for the paid Pro version. The free version supports DV, MPEG, Uncompressed and other codecs for both import and export.

==== Windows version 11.1 released 29 May 2013 ====
On 29 May 2013, v11.1 stable release was made available for download. A major development in the Pro version is improved performance of the H.264/AVC codec in MP4 and MOV containers. This makes it possible to edit this format natively, even with less powerful CPUs. This should interest HDSLR and GoPro camera users. Native editing of H.264 MTS files has been possible since version 11.0.3.

This version of Lightworks has also replaced HASP with the new EditShare Licensing System (ELS), which eliminates some installation problems.{{Which?|reason=Probably the ones that revolved around hardware locks for software being absolute garbage, Lightworks Free users can now download the 64 bit version, which was previously limited to Pro users. The Free version now also comes with a 30-day Pro Trial period.

==== Linux version announced at IBC 2012 ====
EditShare demonstrated the Linux version at the NAB in Las Vegas in April 2012, and posted a video of it running on Ubuntu on their YouTube channel. At IBC in Amsterdam in September, an updated Linux demo was presented, and EditShare announced that the initial Linux alpha version would become available on 30 October . Lightworks 11 alpha for Linux was released on 30 April 2012, but only to a limited audience. The Linux version of Lightworks was made available as a Public Beta on 30 April 2013.

==== Lightworks 12 beta released for Windows, Linux and Mac ====
On 8 August 2014, the first beta of Lightworks version 12 working on Windows, Linux and Mac was released.

==== Lightworks 12.6 released for Windows, Linux and Mac ====
On 29 August 2015, Lightworks version 12.5 for Windows, Linux and Mac was released.

==== Lightworks 12.7 released for Windows, Linux and Mac ====
On 4 February 2016, Lightworks version 12.6 for Windows, Linux and Mac was released.

==== Lightworks 14.5 released for Windows, Linux and Mac ====
In October 2018, Lightworks released version 14.5 for Windows, Linux and Mac platforms. 14.5 added a vast array of new features including variable frame rate support, a huge amount of codec support including Red Cinema R3D, Cineform and Blackmagic Q1 codecs.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

=== LWKS Software Ltd ownership, 2020-present ===
In September 2020, a new company, LWKS Software Ltd, founded in August of the same year by two members of the development team, took ownership of Lightworks, as well as QScan AQC software. the agreement also mentions Key member of the development teams of both software joining the new company.

Over the years, Lightworks has confirmed that over 4-million downloads and registrations had taken place.

<doc id="18496" wikidata="Q153998" url="?curid=18496" title="Love Parade">
<text>The Love Parade () was an electronic dance music festival and technoparade that originated in 1989 in West Berlin, Germany. It was held annually in Berlin from 1989 to 2003 and in 2006, then from 2007 to 2010 in the Ruhr region. Events scheduled for 2004 and 2005 in Berlin and for 2009 in Bochum were canceled.

On 24 July 2010, a crowd crush at the Love Parade in Duisburg caused the deaths of 21 people, with at least 500 others injured. As a consequence, the organizer of the festival announced that no further Love Parades would be held and that the festival was permanently canceled.

==History==

The parade first occurred in July 1989, when 150 people took to the streets in Berlin. It was started by the Berlin underground at the initiative of Matthias Roeingh (also known as &quot;Dr. Motte&quot;) and Danielle de Picciotto, who were partners at the time. It was conceived as a political demonstration for peace and international understanding through love and music. The idea came from the administrative employee Miriam Scheffler https://www.zeit.de/online/2009/27/loveparade-interview It was supposed to be a bigger birthday party for Roeingh, and the motto &quot;Friede, Freude, Eierkuchen&quot; (in English — &quot;Peace, Joy, Pancakes&quot;) stood for disarmament (peace), music (joy) and a fair food production/distribution (pancakes). Roeingh dissociated himself from the parade in 2006 because of the commercialization of the event.

The parade was held on the Berlin Kurfürstendamm until 1996. Because of overcrowding on this street, the festival moved to the Straße des 17. Juni in the Großer Tiergarten park in the center of Berlin. The festival became centered around the &quot;Siegessäule&quot; in the middle of the park; and the golden angel atop the column became the parade&#x27;s emblem.

Many people from Germany and abroad traveled to Berlin to take part in the Parade — over a million attended in the years 1997 through 2000 and 800,000 in 2001. Attendance at the 2001 festival was significantly lower because the date of the parade was changed with little advance notice. 2002 and 2003 also saw lower figures, and in 2004 and 2005 the parade was canceled because of funding difficulties. The parade had inspired opposition because of the damage to the Tiergarten by attendees, who were provided with insufficient toilet facilities. Opponents allegedly complicated matters for organisers by booking their own events in Berlin and so to exclude the parade from being able to register with city police. In 2004, however, a scaled-down version took place which served more as a mini-protest and was promoted with the title &quot;Love Weekend&quot;. Dozens of clubs promoted the weekend-long event all over the city, with various clubs staying open for three days straight without closing. In 2006, the parade made a comeback with the help of German exercise studio McFit.

The Love Parade 2007 was planned for 7 July 2007 in Berlin. However, the Berlin event was canceled in February because the Senate of Berlin did not issue the necessary permits at that time. After negotiations with several German cities, on 21 July, it was announced that the parade would move to the Ruhr Area for the next five years. The first event took place in Essen on 25 August. The parade in Essen saw 1.2 million visitors in comparison to the 500,000 who attended the 2006 parade in Berlin.

In 2008, the festival took place in Dortmund on 19 July on the Bundesstraße 1 under the motto &quot;Highway of Love&quot;. The event was planned as a &quot;Love Weekend&quot;, with parties throughout the region. The official estimate is that 1.6 million visitors attended, making it the largest parade to date.

The 2009 event, planned for Bochum, was canceled; a year later, the deaths of 21 attendees at the Duisburg venue prompted the parade&#x27;s organiser Rainer Schaller to declare an end to the festival. &quot;The Love Parade has always been a peaceful party, but it will forever be overshadowed by the accident, so out of respect for the victims the Love Parade will never take place again,&quot; Schaller said. The parade was one of the oldest and largest festivals of electronic music, together with Zürich&#x27;s Streetparade, Mayday and Nature One.

==Successors==
A spiritual successor, the Rave The Planet Parade, was founded by Dr. Motte, the original creator of the Love Parade and is annually held in Berlin. On 9 July 2022, the first Rave The Planet Parade took place in Berlin to call for the city’s electronic music culture to be added to a World Heritage list.

==Setup==
The music played at the events was predominantly electronic dance music — in this case mainly house &amp; techno, and schranz music. Attempts to introduce other music styles, such as hip hop, have failed. Hardcore and gabber music were part of the parade in early years, but were later removed. They are now celebrated separately on a counter-demonstration called &quot;Fuckparade&quot;.

The parade was seen to be louder and more crowded than most concerts. With its water-cooled sound systems on every truck, the parade produced an extremely loud sound floor. After the 2001 arrangement, veterinarians at the Berlin Zoo blamed the parade for giving more than half of its animals diarrhea. Chairman Heiner Kloes said veterinarians told him the heavy bass was to blame for disturbing the animals. The parade consisted of the sound trucks that usually featured local, or important, clubs and their DJs. It had become a rule that only trucks that had sponsors from a techno-related field, such as clubs, labels or stores, were allowed, but advertising space was increased after the 2006 event to offset the high costs of equipping a truck. The trucks were usually open on top and featured dancers, with box-systems mounted on the side or rear.

The parade was a place where some exhibited and enjoyed other people&#x27;s exhibitionist tendencies. Some attendees enjoyed carrying around toys or other items such as dummies (pacifiers) or face masks. Often the crowd was imaginative in terms of clothing (or lack thereof) and appearance.

One famous picture from the parade is people sitting and dancing on streetlamps, trees, commercial signs, telephone booths, which gave the event&#x27;s nickname &quot;the greatest amateur circus on earth&quot;.

The demonstration concluded with the so-called &quot;Abschlusskundgebung&quot; which were sets of the world&#x27;s leading top DJs such as DJ Tiesto, Paul Van Dyk, Carl Cox, Armin Van Buuren, DJ Rush, DJ Hell, Westbam, Drum Connection, Miss Djax, Marusha or Chris Liebing. During this time all trucks (usually about 40) were connected to each other and set online to the statue of victory where the turntables are. This was one of the few chances a DJ can ever have to play for a crowd of about one million people.

==Disturbances==
The parade was quite peaceful for an event of its size, seeing few arrests. In 2008, for example, charges were pressed for six robberies, three sexually related offences and forty thefts. Twenty-three attendees were caught with drugs and forty-nine were charged with bodily harm. There were 177 parade visitors provisionally arrested by the police. Arrests were usually related to drug crimes and most other incidents featured people passing out due to dehydration or hyperthermia. In 2000, after the parade, a girl under the influence of ecstasy was run over by an S-Bahn after she had been leaning on the door too hard.

==2010 disaster==

At the 2010 Love Parade in Duisburg, the number of people attending allegedly reached 1.4 million – the original expectation was around 800,000 – whereas police believed around 400,000 people were present. 21 people were killed, and more than 600 injured, in an incident on an overcrowded ramp leading from a tunnel into the festival. All of the victims were crushed to death, according to officials.

Safety experts and a fire service investigator had previously warned that the site was not suitable for the numbers expected to attend. Rainer Schaller, the festival&#x27;s organizer and chief executive officer, later said the festival would not continue in future.

A preliminary investigation of the ministry of the interior placed heavy blame on the organizers around Rainer Schaller. Schaller in turn claimed that errors by the police in controlling streams of visitors led to the accident.

==Love Parade International==

Similar festivals have taken place in other cities of Germany and many other countries worldwide. Large spin-off festivals in Europe include Zürich&#x27;s Street Parade, Geneva&#x27;s Lake Parade, Paris&#x27;s Techno Parade, Rotterdam&#x27;s FFWD Dance Parade, Munich&#x27;s Union Move, Hamburg&#x27;s Generation Move, Hannover&#x27;s Reincarnation, Bremen&#x27;s Vision Parade and the Love Parade and the Freeparade in Vienna. In 1994, 1995 and 1996 an event called Love Parade was held in Melbourne, Australia. Unlike its overseas counterparts, this was a smaller &quot;rave party&quot; version of the festival. In 1996 it was held at Festival Hall in West Melbourne and included a parade that made the evening news. It was followed in 1997 by a Love Parade in Sydney, Australia, likewise a smaller rave party, held at the infamous Graffiti Hall of Fame in Redfern. In 1999 and 2000 technoparades named &quot;Buenos Aires Energy Parade&quot; took place in Buenos Aires, Argentina under the motto &quot;Love, Peace and Dance&quot;. On Saturday 8 July 2000 a Love Parade was held in Roundhay Park, Leeds, United Kingdom sponsored by BBC Radio 1. In 2001, the official UK parade had moved to Newcastle upon Tyne which was to have seen a parade through the streets of Newcastle before ending up on Town Moor but was canceled after the police refused a license: BBC Radio 1 still hosted a more contained event, however. Since then no Love Parade has taken place in the United Kingdom. In Summer 2000 one of the first public events that took place in post-war Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, was Futura, Festival of Electronic Music. Some of the world&#x27;s most famous DJs, including the organizers of the Berlin Love Parade, performed in a bombed and burnt out factory.
After being held in the North-American Continent for the first time in Mexico (2002), in the fall of 2004 the Love Parade was held in San Francisco. They had held their inaugural Parade in September 2004 with 37,000 attending. The parade was held again in San Francisco in September 2005 as a rousing success drawing over 50–60,000 people. In 2006, the parade was held on 23 September and was renamed Love Fest because the Loveparade Berlin organization did not renew any of their worldwide licenses not already under contract so they could focus on their own event. 2009 was the biggest success of the parade now renamed Lovevolution with over 100,000 people. The first Love Parade in Santiago was held in 2005 and gathered over 100,000 people; the 2006 version gathered over 200,000 people. The first Love Parade in Caracas was held in June 2007 and gathered over 25,000 people.

Spin-off festivals of the Love Parade have taken place in:
*Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt, Bremen and Hanover, Germany
*Zurich, Geneva, Basel and Bern, Switzerland
*Vienna and Salzburg, Austria
*Paris, France
*Rotterdam, Netherlands
*Bologna and Turin, Italy
*Oporto, Portugal
*Sydney, Australia
*Buenos Aires, Argentina
*Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
*Santiago, Chile
*Leeds, England
*Budapest, Hungary
*Tel Aviv, Israel
*Mexico City and Acapulco, Mexico
*Oslo, Norway (Summer Parade)
*Cape Town, South Africa
*Caracas, Venezuela
*Little Rock and San Francisco, United States
*Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina
==Legal issues==
Under German law the state has to pay for security during political demonstrations as well as cleaning up the streets after the demonstration. In the case of a commercial event however, the organizer must cover these expenses. For a large event like the Love Parade the costs are quite high: an estimated €300,000 to €400,000.

The Love Parade was initially held as a political demonstration to save costs; however it was organized by two companies set up just for the Love Parade. Due to this there was a dispute between the organizers and the city of Berlin every year about the status of the Love Parade and who should bear what costs. Finally in 2001, the courts ruled that the Love Parade had to be held as commercial event.

==Anthems==
Every German parade has had its own anthem.
==List of Love Parades==

According to media reports, the attendance figures had been misstated by the organizers for years. Accurate counts are not available since entry is free and uncontrolled. The mayor of Dortmund and the police confirmed the number of attendees in Dortmund.

<doc id="18497" wikidata="Q234105" url="?curid=18497" title="Lost Generation">
<text>The Lost Generation was the demographic cohort that reached early adulthood during World War I, and preceded the Greatest Generation. The social generation is generally defined as people born from 1883 to 1900, coming of age in either the 1900s or the 1910s, and were the first generation to mature in the 20th century. The term is also particularly used to refer to a group of American expatriate writers living in Paris during the 1920s. Gertrude Stein is credited with coining the term, and it was subsequently popularized by Ernest Hemingway, who used it in the epigraph for his 1926 novel &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;: &quot;You are all a lost generation.&quot; &quot;Lost&quot; in this context refers to the &quot;disoriented, wandering, directionless&quot; spirit of many of the war&#x27;s survivors in the early postwar period.

In the wake of the Industrial Revolution, Western members of the Lost Generation grew up in societies that were more literate, consumerist, and media-saturated than ever before, but which also tended to maintain strictly conservative social values. Young men of the cohort were mobilized on a mass scale for World War I, a conflict that was often seen as the defining moment of their age group&#x27;s lifespan. Young women also contributed to and were affected by the war, and in its aftermath gained greater freedoms politically and in other areas of life. The Lost Generation was also heavily vulnerable to the Spanish flu pandemic and became the driving force behind many cultural changes, particularly in major cities during what became known as the Roaring Twenties.

Later in their midlife, they experienced the economic effects of the Great Depression and often saw their own sons leave for the battlefields of World War II. In the developed world, they tended to reach retirement and average life expectancy during the decades after the conflict, but some significantly outlived the norm. The last surviving person who was known to have been born during the 19th century was Nabi Tajima, who died in 2018 at age 117. Most members were parents of the Greatest Generation and Silent Generation.

==Terminology==
The first named generation, the term &quot;Lost Generation&quot; is used for the young people who came of age around the time of World War I. In Europe, they are mostly known as the &quot;Generation of 1914&quot;, for the year World War I began. In France, they were sometimes called the &quot;Génération du feu&quot;, the &quot;(gun)fire generation&quot;. In the United Kingdom, the term was originally used for those who died in the war, and often implicitly referred to upper-class casualties who were perceived to have died disproportionately, robbing the country of a future elite. Many felt that &quot;the flower of youth and the best manhood of the peoples [had] been mowed down&quot;, for example, such notable casualties as the poets Isaac Rosenberg, Rupert Brooke, Edward Thomas, and Wilfred Owen, composer George Butterworth, and physicist Henry Moseley.

==Date and age range definitions==
Authors William Strauss and Neil Howe define the Lost Generation as the cohort born from 1883 to 1900, who came of age during World War I and the Roaring Twenties.

==Characteristics==
===As children and adolescents===
====Family life and upbringing====

When the Lost Generation was growing up, the ideal family arrangement was generally seen as the man of the house being the breadwinner and primary authority figure whilst his wife dedicated herself to caring for the home and children. Most, even less well-off, married couples attempted to conform to this ideal. It was common for family members of three different generations to share a home. Wealthier households also tended to include domestic servants, though their numbers would have varied from a single maid to a large team depending on how well-off the family was.

Public concern for the welfare of children was intensifying by the later 19th century with laws being passed and societies formed to prevent their abuse. The state increasingly gained the legal right to intervene in private homes and family life to protect minors from harm. However, beating children for misbehaviour was not only common but viewed as the duty of a responsible caregiver.
====Health and living conditions====
Sewer systems designed to remove human waste from urban areas had become widespread in industrial cities by the late 19th century, helping to reduce the spread of diseases such as cholera. Legal standards for the quality of drinking water also began to be introduced. However, the introduction of electricity was slower, and during the formative years of the Lost Generation gas lights and candles were still the most common form of lighting.

Though statistics on child mortality dating back to the beginning of the Lost Generation&#x27;s lifespan are limited, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that in 1900 one in ten American infants died before their first birthday. Figures for the United Kingdom state that during the final years of the 19th century, mortality in the first five years of childhood was plateauing at a little under one in every four births. At around one in three in 1800, the early childhood mortality rate had declined overall throughout the next hundred years but would fall most sharply during the first half of the 20th century, reaching less than one in twenty by 1950. This meant that members of the Lost Generation were somewhat less likely to die at a very early age than their parents and grandparents, but were significantly more likely to do so than children born even a few decades later.

====Literacy and education====
Laws restricting child labour in factories had begun to appear from around 1840 onwards and by the end of the 19th century, compulsory education had been introduced throughout much of the Western world for at least a few years of childhood. By 1900, levels of illiteracy had fallen to less than 11% in the United States, around 3% in Great Britain, and only 1% in Germany. However, the problems of illiteracy and lack of school provision or attendance were felt more acutely in parts of Eastern and Southern Europe.

Schools of this time period tended to emphasise strict discipline, expecting pupils to memorize information by rote. To help deal with teacher shortages, older students were often used to help supervise and educate their younger peers. Dividing children into classes based on age became more common as schools grew.

However, whilst elementary schooling was becoming increasingly accessible for Western children at the turn of the century, secondary education was still much more of a luxury. Only 11% of American fourteen to seventeen-year-olds were enrolled at High School in 1900, a figure which had only marginally increased by 1910. Though the school leaving age was officially meant to be 14 by 1900, until the First World War, most British children could leave school through rules put in place by local authorities at 12 or 13 years old. It was not uncommon at the end of the 19th century for Canadian children to leave school at nine or ten years old.

====Leisure and play====
By the 1890s, children&#x27;s toys entered into mass production. In 1893, the British toy company William Britain revolutionized the production of toy soldiers by devising the method of hollow casting, making soldiers that were cheaper and lighter than their competitors. This led to metal toy soldiers, which had previously been the preserve of boys from wealthier families, gaining mass appeal during the late Victorian and Edwardian period. Dolls often sold by street vendors at a low price were popular with girls. Teddy bears appeared for the first time in the early 1900s. Tin plated penny toys were also sold by street sellers for a single penny.

The turn of the 20th century saw a surge in public park building in parts of the west to provide public space in rapidly growing industrial towns. They provided a means for children from different backgrounds to play and interact together, sometimes in specially designed facilities. They held frequent concerts and performances.

====Popular culture and mass media====
Beginning around the middle of the 19th century, magazines of various types which had previously mainly targeted the few that could afford them found rising popularity among the general public. The latter part of the century not only saw rising popularity for magazines targeted specifically at young boys but the development of a relatively new genre aimed at girls.

A significant milestone was reached in the development of cinema when, in 1895, projected moving images were first shown to a paying audience in Paris. Early films were very short (generally taking the form of newsreels, comedic sketches, and short documentaries). They lacked sound but were accompanied by music, lectures, and a lot of audience participation. A notable film industry had developed by the start of the First World War.

===As young adults===
====Military service in the First World War====
The Lost Generation is best known as being the cohort that primarily fought in World War I. More than 70 million people were mobilized during the First World War, around 8.5 million of whom were killed and 21 million wounded in the conflict. About 2 million soldiers are believed to have been killed by disease, while individual battles sometimes caused hundreds of thousands of deaths.

Around 60 million of the enlisted originated from the European continent, which saw its younger men mobilized on a mass scale. Most of Europe&#x27;s great powers operated peacetime conscription systems where men were expected to do a brief period of military training in their youth before spending the rest of their lives in the army reserve. Nations with this system saw a huge portion of their manpower directly invested in the conflict: 55% of male Italians and Bulgarians aged 18 to 50 were called to military service. Elsewhere the proportions were even higher: 63% of military-aged men in Serbia, 78% in Austro-Hungary, and 81% of military-aged men in France and Germany served. Britain, which traditionally relied primarily on the Royal Navy for its security, was a notable exception to this rule and did not introduce conscription until 1916. Around 5 million British men fought in the First World War out of a total United Kingdom population of 46 million including women, children, and men too old to bear arms.

Additionally, nations recruited heavily from their colonial empires. Three million men from around the British Empire outside the United Kingdom served in the British Army as soldiers and laborers, whilst France recruited 475,000 soldiers from its colonies. Other nations involved include the United States which enlisted 4 million men during the conflict and the Ottoman Empire which mobilized 2,850,000 soldiers.

Beyond the extent of the deaths, the war had a profound effect on many of its survivors, giving many young men severe mental health problems and crippling physical disabilities. The war also unsettled many soldiers&#x27; sense of reality, who had gone into the conflict with a belief that battle and hardship was a path to redemption and greatness. When years of pain, suffering, and loss seemed to bring about little in the way of a better future, many were left with a profound sense of disillusionment.

====Young women in the 1910s and 1920s====

Though soldiers on the frontlines of the First World War were exclusively men, women contributed to the war effort in other ways. Many took the jobs men had left in previously male-dominated sectors such as heavy industry, while some even took on non-combat military roles. Many, particularly wealthier women, took part in voluntary work to contribute to the war effort or to help those suffering due to it, such as the wounded or refugees. Often they were experiencing manual labor for the first time. However, this reshaping of the female role led to fears that the sexes having the same responsibilities would disrupt the fabric of society and that more competition for work would leave men unemployed and erode their pay. Most women had to exit the employment they had taken during the war as soon as it concluded.

The war also had a personal impact on the lives of female members of the Lost Generation. Many women lost their husbands in the conflict, which frequently meant losing the main breadwinner of the household. However, war widows often received a pension and financial assistance to support their children. Even with some economic support, raising a family alone was often financially difficult and emotionally draining, and women faced losing their pensions if they remarried or were accused of engaging in frowned-upon behavior. In some cases, grief and the other pressures on them drove widows to alcoholism, depression, or suicide. Additionally, the large number of men killed in the First World War made it harder for many young women who were still single at the start of conflict to get married; this accelerated a trend towards them gaining greater independence and embarking on careers.

Women&#x27;s gaining of political rights sped up in the Western world after the First World War, while employment opportunities for unmarried women widened. This time period saw the development of a new type of young woman in popular culture known as a flapper, who was known for their rebellion against previous social norms. They had a physically distinctive appearance compared to their predecessors only a few years earlier, cutting their hair into bobs, wearing shorter dresses and more makeup, while taking on a new code of behaviour filled with more recklessness, party-going, and overt sexuality.

====Aftermath of the First World War====
The aftermath of the First World War saw substantive changes in the political situation, including a trend towards republicanism, the founding of many new relatively small nation-states which had previously been part of larger empires, and greater suffrage for groups such as the working class and women. France and the United Kingdom both gained territory from their enemies, while the war and the damage it did to the European empires are generally considered major stepping stones in the United States&#x27; path to becoming the world&#x27;s dominant superpower. The German and Italian populations&#x27; resentment against what they generally saw as a peace settlement that took too much away from the former or did not give enough to the latter fed into the fascist movements, which would eventually turn those countries into totalitarian dictatorships. For Russia, the years after its revolution in 1917 were plagued by disease, famine, terror, and civil war eventually concluded in the establishment of the Soviet Union.

The immediate post-World War One period was characterized by continued political violence and economic instability. The late 1910s saw the Spanish flu pandemic, which was unusual in the sense that it killed many younger adults of the same Lost Generation age group that had mainly died in the war. Later, especially in major cities, much of the 1920s is considered to have been a more prosperous period when the Lost Generation, in particular, escaped the suffering and turmoil they had lived through by rebelling against the social and cultural norms of their elders.

===In midlife===
====1930s====
=====Politics and economics=====
This more optimistic period was short-lived, however, as 1929 saw the beginning of the Great Depression, which would continue throughout the 1930s and become the longest and most severe financial downturn ever experienced in Western industrialized history. Though it had begun in the United States, the crises led to sharp increases in worldwide unemployment, reductions in economic output and deflation. The depression was also a major catalyst for the rise of Nazism in Germany and the beginnings of its quest to establish dominance over the European continent, which would eventually lead to World War II in Europe. Additionally, the 1930s saw the less badly damaged Imperial Japan engage in its own empire-building, contributing to conflict in the Far East, where some scholars have argued the Second World War began as early as 1931.

=====Popular media=====
The 1930s saw rising popularity for radio, with the vast majority of Western households having access to the medium by the end of the decade. Programming included soap operas, music, and sport. Educational broadcasts were frequently available. The airwaves also provided a source of news and, particularly for the era&#x27;s autocratic regimes, an outlet for political propaganda.

====Second World War====
When World War II broke out in 1939, the Lost Generation faced a major global conflict for the second time in their lifetime, and now often had to watch their sons go to the battlefield. The place of the older generation who had been young adults during World War I in the new conflict was a theme in popular media of the time period, with examples including &quot;Waterloo Bridge&quot; and &quot;Old Bill and Son.&quot; Civil defense organizations designed to provide a final line of resistance against invasion and assist in home defense more broadly recruited heavily from the older male population. Like in the First World War, women helped to make up for labour shortages caused by mass military recruitment by entering more traditionally masculine employment and entering the conflict more directly in female military branches and underground resistance movements. However, those in middle age were generally less likely to become involved in this kind of work than the young. This was particularly true of any kind of military involvement.

===In later life===
In the West, the Lost Generation tended to reach the end of their working lives around the 1950s and 1960s. For those members of the cohort who had fought in World War I, their military service frequently was viewed as a defining moment in their lives even many years later. Retirement notices of this era often included information on a man&#x27;s service in the First World War.

Though there were slight differences between individual countries and from one year to the next, the average life expectancy in the developed world during the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s was typically around seventy years old. However, some members of the Lost Generation outlived the norm by several decades. Nabi Tajima, the last surviving person known to have been born in the 19th century, died in 2018. The final remaining veteran to have served in World War I in any capacity was Florence Green, who died in 2012, while Claude Choules, the last veteran to have been involved in combat, had died the previous year. However, these individuals were born in 1902 and 1901 respectively, putting them outside the usual birth years for the Lost Generation.

==In literature==
In his memoir &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot; (1964), published after Hemingway&#x27;s and Stein&#x27;s deaths, Ernest Hemingway writes that Gertrude Stein heard the phrase from a French garage owner who serviced Stein&#x27;s car. When a young mechanic failed to repair the car quickly enough, the garage owner shouted at the young man, &quot;You are all a &quot;génération perdue&quot;″.&quot; While telling Hemingway the story, Stein added: &quot;That is what you are. That&#x27;s what you all are ... all of you young people who served in the war. You are a lost generation.&quot; Hemingway thus credits the phrase to Stein, who was then his mentor and patron.

The 1926 publication of Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; popularized the term; that novel serves to epitomize the post-war expatriate generation. However, Hemingway later wrote to his editor Max Perkins that the &quot;point of the book&quot; was not so much about a generation being lost, but that &quot;the earth abideth forever&quot;. Hemingway believed the characters in &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; may have been &quot;battered&quot; but were not lost.

Consistent with this ambivalence, Hemingway employs &quot;Lost Generation&quot; as one of two contrasting epigraphs for his novel. In &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot;, Hemingway writes, &quot;I tried to balance Miss Stein&#x27;s quotation from the garage owner with one from Ecclesiastes.&quot; A few lines later, recalling the risks and losses of the war, he adds: &quot;I thought of Miss Stein and Sherwood Anderson and egotism and mental laziness versus discipline and I thought &#x27;who is calling who a lost generation?

===Themes===
The writings of the Lost Generation literary figures often pertained to the writers&#x27; experiences in World War I and the years following it. It is said that the work of these writers was autobiographical based on their use of mythologized versions of their lives. One of the themes that commonly appear in the authors&#x27; works is decadence and the frivolous lifestyle of the wealthy. Both Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald touched on this theme throughout the novels &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; and &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. Another theme commonly found in the works of these authors was the death of the American Dream, which is exhibited throughout many of their novels. It is particularly prominent in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, in which the character Nick Carraway comes to realize the corruption that surrounds him.

===Notable figures===
Notable figures of the Lost Generation include F. Scott Fitzgerald, Thomas Wolfe, Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, Dorothy Parker, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Jean Rhys, Henry Strater, and Sylvia Beach.

<doc id="18499" wikidata="Q164597" url="?curid=18499" title="Left-wing politics">
<text>Left-wing politics describes the range of political ideologies that support and seek to achieve social equality and egalitarianism, often in opposition to social hierarchy as a whole or certain social hierarchies. Left-wing politics typically involve a concern for those in society whom its adherents perceive as disadvantaged relative to others as well as a belief that there are unjustified inequalities that need to be reduced or abolished through radical means that change the nature of the society they are implemented in. According to emeritus professor of economics Barry Clark, supporters of left-wing politics &quot;claim that human development flourishes when individuals engage in cooperative, mutually respectful relations that can thrive only when excessive differences in status, power, and wealth are eliminated.&quot;

Within the left–right political spectrum, &quot;Left&quot; and &quot;Right&quot; were coined during the French Revolution, referring to the seating arrangement in the French National Assembly. Those who sat on the left generally opposed the Ancien Régime and the Bourbon monarchy and supported the Revolution, the creation of a democratic republic and the secularisation of society while those on the right were supportive of the traditional institutions of the Ancien Régime. Usage of the term &quot;Left&quot; became more prominent after the restoration of the French monarchy in 1815, when it was applied to the &quot;Independents&quot;. The word &quot;wing&quot; was first appended to Left and Right in the late 19th century, usually with disparaging intent, and &quot;left-wing&quot; was applied to those who were unorthodox in their religious or political views.

Ideologies considered to be &quot;left-wing&quot; vary greatly depending on the placement along the political spectrum in a given time and place. At the end of the 18th century, upon the founding of the first liberal democracies, the term &quot;Left&quot; was used to describe liberalism in the United States and republicanism in France, supporting a lesser degree of hierarchical decision-making than the &quot;right-wing politics&quot; of the traditional conservatives and monarchists. In modern politics, the term &quot;Left&quot; typically applies to ideologies and movements to the left of classical liberalism, supporting some degree of democracy in the economic sphere. Today, ideologies such as social liberalism and social democracy are considered to be centre-left, while &quot;the Left&quot; is typically reserved for movements more critical of capitalism, including the labour movement, socialism, anarchism, communism, Marxism, and syndicalism, each of which rose to prominence in the 19th and 20th centuries.
In addition, the term &quot;left-wing&quot; has also been applied to a broad range of culturally liberal social movements, including the civil rights movement, feminist movement, LGBT rights movement, abortion-rights movements, multiculturalism, anti-war movement, and environmental movement, as well as a wide range of political parties.‌

== Positions ==
The following positions are typically associated with left-wing politics.

=== Economics ===

Left-leaning economic beliefs range from Keynesian economics and the welfare state through industrial democracy and the social market to the nationalization of the economy and central planning, to the anarcho-syndicalist advocacy of a council-based and self-managed anarchist communism. During the Industrial Revolution, leftists supported trade unions. At the beginning of the 20th century, many leftists advocated strong government intervention in the economy. Leftists continue to criticize the perceived exploitative nature of globalization, the &quot;race to the bottom&quot; and unjust lay-offs and exploitation of workers. In the last quarter of the 20th century, the belief that the government (ruling in accordance with the interests of the people) ought to be directly involved in the day-to-day workings of an economy declined in popularity amongst the centre-left, especially social democrats who adopted the Third Way. Left-wing politics are typically associated with popular or state control of major political and economic institutions.

Other leftists believe in Marxian economics, named after the economic theories of Karl Marx. Some distinguish Marx&#x27;s economic theories from his political philosophy, arguing that Marx&#x27;s approach to understanding the economy is independent of his advocacy of revolutionary socialism or his belief in the inevitability of a proletarian revolution. Marxian economics do not exclusively rely on Marx and draw from a range of Marxist and non-Marxist sources. The &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; and &quot;workers&#x27; state&quot; are terms used by some Marxists, particularly Leninists and Marxist–Leninists, to describe what they see as a temporary state between the capitalist state of affairs and a communist society. Marx defined the proletariat as salaried workers, in contrast to the lumpenproletariat, who he defined as the outcasts of society such as beggars, tricksters, entertainers, buskers, criminals and prostitutes. The political relevance of farmers has divided the left. In , Marx scarcely mentioned the subject. Mikhail Bakunin thought the lumpenproletariat was a revolutionary class, while Mao Zedong believed that it would be rural peasants, not urban workers, who would bring about the proletarian revolution.

Left-libertarians, anarchists and libertarian socialists believe in a decentralized economy run by trade unions, workers&#x27; councils, cooperatives, municipalities and communes, opposing both state and private control of the economy, preferring social ownership and local control in which a nation of decentralized regions is united in a confederation. The global justice movement, also known as the anti-globalisation movement and the alter-globalisation movement, protests against corporate economic globalisation due to its negative consequences for the poor, workers, the environment, and small businesses.

Leftists generally believe in innovation in various technological and philosophical fields and disciplines to help causes they support.

=== Environment ===

One of the foremost left-wing advocates was Thomas Paine, one of the first individuals since &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; became political terms to describe the collective human ownership of the world which he speaks of in Agrarian Justice. As such, most of left-wing thought and literature regarding environmentalism stems from this duty of ownership and the aforementioned form of cooperative ownership means that humanity must take care of the Earth. This principle is reflected in much of the historical left-wing thought and literature that came afterwards, although there were disagreements about what this entailed. Both Karl Marx and the early socialist philosopher and scholar William Morris arguably had a concern for environmental matters. According to Marx, &quot;[e]ven an entire society, a nation, or all simultaneously existing societies taken together, are not the owners of the earth. They are simply its possessors, its beneficiaries, and have to bequeath it in an improved state to succeeding generations&quot;. Following the Russian Revolution, environmental scientists such as revolutionary Alexander Bogdanov and the Proletkult organisation made efforts to incorporate environmentalism into Bolshevism and &quot;integrate production with natural laws and limits&quot; in the first decade of Soviet rule, before Joseph Stalin attacked ecologists and the science of ecology, purged environmentalists and promoted the pseudoscience of Trofim Lysenko during his rule up until his death in 1953. Similarly, Mao Zedong rejected environmentalism and believed that based on the laws of historical materialism, all of nature must be put into the service of revolution.

From the 1970s onwards, environmentalism became an increasing concern of the left, with social movements and several unions campaigning on environmental issues and causes. In Australia, the left-wing Builders Labourers Federation, led by the communist Jack Mundy, united with environmentalists to place green bans on environmentally destructive development projects. Several segments of the socialist and Marxist left consciously merged environmentalism and anti-capitalism into an eco-socialist ideology. Barry Commoner articulated a left-wing response to &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot; model that predicted catastrophic resource depletion and spurred environmentalism, postulating that capitalist technologies were the key cause responsible for environmental degradation, as opposed to human population pressures. Environmental degradation can be seen as a class or equity issue, as environmental destruction disproportionately affects poorer communities and countries.
Several left-wing or socialist groupings have an overt environmental concern and several green parties contain a strong socialist presence. The Green Party of England and Wales features an eco-socialist group, the Green Left, which was founded in June 2005. Its members held several influential positions within the party, including both the former Principal Speakers Siân Berry and Derek Wall, himself an eco-socialist and Marxist academic. In Europe, several green left political parties such as the European United Left–Nordic Green Left combine traditional social-democratic values such as a desire for greater economic equality and workers rights with demands for environmental protection. Democratic socialist Bolivian president Evo Morales has traced environmental degradation to capitalist consumerism, stating that &quot;[t]he Earth does not have enough for the North to live better and better, but it does have enough for all of us to live well&quot;. James Hansen, Noam Chomsky, Raj Patel, Naomi Klein, The Yes Men and Dennis Kucinich hold similar views.

In climate change mitigation, the Left is also divided over how to effectively and equitably reduce carbon emissions as the center-left often advocates a reliance on market measures such as emissions trading and a carbon tax while those further to the left support direct government regulation and intervention in the form of a Green New Deal, either alongside or instead of market mechanisms.

=== Nationalism, anti-imperialism and anti-nationalism ===

The question of nationality, imperialism and nationalism has been a central feature of political debates on the Left. During the French Revolution, nationalism was a key policy of the Republican Left. The Republican Left advocated for civic nationalism and argued that the nation is a &quot;daily plebiscite&quot; formed by the subjective &quot;will to live together&quot;. Related to revanchism, the belligerent will to take revenge against Germany and retake control of Alsace-Lorraine, nationalism was sometimes opposed to imperialism. In the 1880s, there was a debate between leftists such as the Radical Georges Clemenceau, the Socialist Jean Jaurès and the nationalist Maurice Barrès, who argued that colonialism diverted France from liberating the &quot;blue line of the Vosges&quot;, in reference to Alsace-Lorraine; and the &quot;colonial lobby&quot; such as Jules Ferry of the Moderate Republicans, Léon Gambetta of the Republicans and Eugène Etienne, the president of the Parliamentary Colonial Group. After the antisemitic Dreyfus Affair in which officer Alfred Dreyfus was falsely convicted of sedition and exiled to a penal colony in 1894 before being exonerated in 1906, nationalism in the form of Boulangism increasingly became associated with the far-right.

The Marxist social class theory of proletarian internationalism asserts that members of the working class should act in solidarity with working people in other countries in pursuit of a common class interest, rather than only focusing on their own countries. Proletarian internationalism is summed up in the slogan: &quot;Workers of the world, unite!&quot;, the last line of &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;. Union members had learned that more members meant more bargaining power. Taken to an international level, leftists argued that workers should act in solidarity with the international proletariat in order to further increase the power of the working class. Proletarian internationalism saw itself as a deterrent against war and international conflicts, because people with a common interest are less likely to take up arms against one another, instead focusing on fighting the bourgeoisie as the ruling class. According to Marxist theory, the antonym of proletarian internationalism is bourgeois nationalism. Some Marxists, together with others on the left, view nationalism, racism (including antisemitism) and religion as divide and conquer tactics used by the ruling classes to prevent the working class from uniting against them in solidarity with one another. Left-wing movements have often taken up anti-imperialist positions. Anarchism has developed a critique of nationalism that focuses on nationalism&#x27;s role in justifying and consolidating state power and domination. Through its unifying goal, nationalism strives for centralisation (both in specific territories and in a ruling elite of individuals) while it prepares a population for capitalist exploitation. Within anarchism, this subject has been extensively discussed by Rudolf Rocker in his book titled &quot;Nationalism and Culture&quot; and by the works of Fredy Perlman such as &quot;Against His-Story, Against Leviathan&quot; and &quot;The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism&quot;.

The failure of revolutions in Germany and Hungary in the 1918–1920 years ended Bolshevik hopes for an imminent world revolution and led to the promotion of the doctrine of socialism in one country by Joseph Stalin. In the first edition of his book titled &quot;Osnovy Leninizma&quot; (&quot;Foundations of Leninism&quot;, 1924), Stalin argued that revolution in one country is insufficient. By the end of that year in the second edition of the book, he argued that the &quot;proletariat can and must build the socialist society in one country&quot;. In April 1925, Nikolai Bukharin elaborated on the issue in his brochure titled &quot;Can We Build Socialism in One Country in the Absence of the Victory of the West-European Proletariat?&quot;, whose position was adopted as state policy after Stalin&#x27;s January 1926 article titled &quot;On the Issues of Leninism&quot; (К вопросам ленинизма) was published. This idea was opposed by Leon Trotsky and his supporters, who declared the need for an international &quot;permanent revolution&quot; and condemned Stalin for betraying the goals and ideals of the socialist revolution. Various Fourth Internationalist groups around the world who describe themselves as Trotskyist see themselves as standing in this tradition while Maoist China formally supported the theory of socialism in one country.

European social democrats strongly support Europeanism and supranational integration within the European Union, although there is a minority of nationalists and Eurosceptics on the left. Several scholars have linked this form of left-wing nationalism to the pressure generated by economic integration with other countries, often encouraged by neoliberal free trade agreements. This view is sometimes used to justify hostility towards supranational organizations. Left-wing nationalism can also refer to any form of nationalism which emphasizes a leftist working-class populist agenda that seeks to overcome exploitation or oppression by other nations. Many Third World anti-colonialist movements have adopted leftist and socialist ideas. Third-Worldism is a tendency within leftist thought that regards the division between First World and Second World developed countries and Third World developing countries as being of high political importance. This tendency supports decolonization and national liberation movements against imperialism by capitalists. Third-Worldism is closely connected with African socialism, Latin American socialism, Maoism, pan-Africanism and pan-Arabism. Several left-wing groups in the developing world such as the Zapatista Army of National Liberation in Mexico, the Abahlali baseMjondolo in South Africa and the Naxalites in India have argued that the First World and the Second World Left takes a racist and paternalistic attitude towards liberation movements in the Third World.

=== Religion ===

The original French Left was firmly anti-clerical, strongly opposing the influence of the Roman Catholic Church and supporting atheism and the separation of church and state, ushering in a policy known as &quot;laïcité&quot;. Karl Marx asserted that &quot;religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people&quot;. In Soviet Russia, the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin originally embraced an ideological principle which professed that all religion would eventually atrophy and resolved to eradicate organized Christianity and other religious institutions. In 1918, 10 Russian Orthodox hierarchs were summarily executed by a firing squad, and children were deprived of any religious education outside of the home.

Today in the Western world, those on the Left generally support secularization and the separation of church and state. However, religious beliefs have also been associated with many left-wing movements such as the progressive movement, the Social Gospel movement, the civil rights movement, the anti-war movement, the anti-capital punishment movement and Liberation Theology. Early utopian socialist thinkers such as Robert Owen, Charles Fourier and the Comte de Saint-Simon based their theories of socialism upon Christian principles. Other common leftist concerns such as pacifism, social justice, racial equality, human rights and the rejection of capitalism and excessive wealth can be found in the Bible.

In the late 19th century, the Protestant Social Gospel movement arose in the United States which integrated progressive and socialist thought with Christianity through faith-based social activism. Other left-wing religious movements include Buddhist socialism, Jewish socialism and Islamic socialism. There have been alliances between the left and anti-war Muslims, such as the Respect Party and the Stop the War Coalition in Britain. In France, the left has been divided over moves to ban the hijab from schools, with some leftists supporting a ban based on the separation of church and state in accordance with the principle of &quot;laïcité&quot; and other leftists opposing the prohibition based on personal and religious freedom.

=== Social progressivism and counterculture ===
Social progressivism is another common feature of modern leftism, particularly in the United States, where social progressives played an important role in the abolition of slavery, the enshrinement of women&#x27;s suffrage in the United States Constitution, and the protection of civil rights, LGBTQ rights, women&#x27;s rights and multiculturalism. Progressives have both advocated for alcohol prohibition legislation and worked towards its repeal in the mid to late 1920s and early 1930s. Current positions associated with social progressivism in the Western world include strong opposition to the death penalty, torture, mass surveillance, and the war on drugs, and support for abortion rights, cognitive liberty, LGBTQ rights including legal recognition of same-sex marriage, same-sex adoption of children, the right to change one&#x27;s legal gender, distribution of contraceptives, and public funding of embryonic stem-cell research. The desire for an expansion of social and civil liberties often overlaps that of the libertarian movement. Public education was a subject of great interest to groundbreaking social progressives such as Lester Frank Ward and John Dewey, who believed that a democratic society and system of government was practically impossible without a universal and comprehensive nationwide system of education.

Various counterculture and anti-war movements in the 1960s and 1970s were associated with the New Left. Unlike the earlier leftist focus on labour union activism and a proletarian revolution, the New Left instead adopted a broader definition of political activism commonly called social activism. The New Left in the United States is associated with the hippie movement, mass protest movements on school campuses and a broadening of focus from protesting class-based oppression to include issues such as gender, race and sexual orientation. The British New Left was an intellectually driven movement which attempted to correct the perceived errors of the Old Left. The New Left opposed prevailing authoritarian structures in society which it designated as &quot;The Establishment&quot; and became known as the &quot;Anti-Establishment&quot;. The New Left did not seek to recruit industrial workers en masse, but instead concentrated on a social activist approach to organization, convinced that they could be the source for a better kind of social revolution. This view has been criticized by several Marxists, especially Trotskyists, who characterized this approach as &quot;substitutionism&quot; which they described as a misguided and non-Marxist belief that other groups in society could &quot;substitute&quot; for and &quot;replace&quot; the revolutionary agency of the working class.

Many early feminists and advocates of women&#x27;s rights were considered a part of the Left by their contemporaries. Feminist pioneer Mary Wollstonecraft was influenced by Thomas Paine. Many notable leftists have been strong supporters of gender equality such as Marxist philosophers and activists Rosa Luxemburg, Clara Zetkin and Alexandra Kollontai, anarchist philosophers and activists such as Virginia Bolten, Emma Goldman and Lucía Sánchez Saornil and democratic socialist philosophers and activists such as Helen Keller and Annie Besant. However, Marxists such as Rosa Luxemburg, Clara Zetkin, and Alexandra Kollontai, who are supporters of radical social equality for women and have rejected and opposed liberal feminism because they considered it to be a capitalist bourgeois ideology. Marxists were responsible for organizing the first International Working Women&#x27;s Day events.

The women&#x27;s liberation movement is closely connected to the New Left and other new social movements which openly challenged the orthodoxies of the Old Left. Socialist feminism as exemplified by the Freedom Socialist Party and Radical Women and Marxist feminism, spearheaded by Selma James, saw themselves as a part of the Left that challenges male-dominated and sexist structures within the Left. The connection between left-wing ideologies and the struggle for LGBTQ rights also has an important history. Prominent socialists who were involved in early struggles for LGBTQ rights include Edward Carpenter, Oscar Wilde, Harry Hay, Bayard Rustin and Daniel Guérin, among others. The New Left is also strongly supportive of LGBTQ rights and liberation, having been instrumental in the founding of the LGBTQ rights movement in the aftermath of the Stonewall Riots of 1969. Contemporary leftist activists and socialist countries such as Cuba are actively supportive of LGBTQ+ people and are involved in the struggle for LGBTQ+ rights and equality.

== History ==
In politics, the term &quot;Left&quot; derives from the French Revolution as the political groups opposed to the royal veto privilege (Montagnard and Jacobin deputies from the Third Estate) generally sat to the left of the presiding member&#x27;s chair in parliament while the ones in favour of the royal veto privilege sat on its right. That habit began in the original French National Assembly. Throughout the 19th century, the main line dividing Left and Right was between supporters of the French republic and those of the monarchy&#x27;s privileges. The June Days uprising during the Second Republic was an attempt by the Left to re-assert itself after the 1848 Revolution, but only a small portion of the population supported this.

In the mid-19th century, nationalism, socialism, democracy and anti-clericalism became key features of the French Left. After Napoleon III&#x27;s 1851 coup and the subsequent establishment of the Second Empire, Marxism began to rival radical republicanism and utopian socialism as a force within left-wing politics. The influential &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot; by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, published amidst the wave of revolutions of 1848 across Europe, asserted that all of human history is defined by class struggle. They predicted that a proletarian revolution would eventually overthrow bourgeois capitalism and create a stateless, moneyless and classless communist society. It was in this period that the word &quot;wing&quot; was appended to both Left and Right.

The International Workingmen&#x27;s Association (1864–1876), sometimes called the First International, brought together delegates from many different countries, with many different views about how to reach a classless and stateless society. Following a split between supporters of Marx and Mikhail Bakunin, anarchists formed the Saint-Imier International and later the International Workers&#x27; Association (IWA–AIT). The Second International (1888–1916) became divided over the issue of World War I. Those who opposed the war, among them Vladimir Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg, saw themselves as further to the left.

In the United States, leftists such as social liberals, progressives and trade unionists were influenced by the works of Thomas Paine, who introduced the concept of asset-based egalitarianism which theorises that social equality is possible by a redistribution of resources. After the Reconstruction era in the aftermath of the American Civil War, the phrase &quot;the Left&quot; was used to describe those who supported trade unions, the civil rights movement and the anti-war movement. More recently, &quot;left-wing&quot; and &quot;right-wing&quot; have often been used as synonyms for the Democratic and Republican parties, or as synonyms for liberalism and conservatism, respectively.

During the 20th century, war resulted in a dramatic intensification of the pace of social changes, and was a crucial catalyst for the growth of left-wing politics. Since the Right was populist, both in the Western and the Eastern Bloc, anything viewed as avant-garde art was called leftist across Europe, thus the identification of Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Guernica&quot; as &quot;leftist&quot; in Europe and the condemnation of the Russian composer Shostakovich&#x27;s opera (&quot;The Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk District&quot;) in &quot;Pravda&quot; as follows: &quot;Here we have &#x27;leftist&#x27; confusion instead of natural, human music&quot;.

== Types ==
The spectrum of left-wing politics ranges from centre-left to far-left or ultra-left. The term &quot;centre-left&quot; describes a position within the political mainstream that accepts capitalism and a market economy. The terms &quot;far-left&quot; and &quot;ultra-left&quot; are used for positions that are more radical, more strongly rejecting capitalism and mainstream representative democracy, instead advocating for a socialist society based on economic democracy and direct democracy, representing economic, political and social democracy. The centre-left includes social democrats, social liberals, progressives and greens. Centre-left supporters accept market allocation of resources in a mixed economy with an empowered public sector and a thriving private sector. Centre-left policies tend to favour limited state intervention in matters pertaining to the public interest.

In several countries, the terms &quot;far-left&quot; and &quot;radical left&quot; have been associated with many varieties of anarchism, autonomism and communism. They have been used to describe groups that advocate anti-capitalism and eco-terrorism. In France, a distinction is made between the centre-left and the left represented by the Socialist Party and the French Communist Party and the far-left as represented by anarcho-communists, Maoists and Trotskyists. The United States Department of Homeland Security defines &quot;left-wing extremism&quot; as groups that &quot;seek to bring about change through violent revolution, rather than through established political processes&quot;. Similar to far-right politics, extremist far-left politics have motivated political violence, radicalization, genocide, terrorism, sabotage and damage to property, the formation of militant organizations, political repression, conspiracism, xenophobia, and nationalism.

In China, the term &quot;Chinese New Left&quot; denotes those who oppose the economic reforms enacted by Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s and 1990s, favour instead the restoration of Maoist policies and the immediate transition to a socialist economy. In the Western world, the term &quot;New Left&quot; is used for social and cultural politics.

In the United Kingdom during the 1980s, the term &quot;hard left&quot; was applied to supporters of Tony Benn such as the Campaign Group and those involved in the &quot;London Labour Briefing&quot; newspaper as well as Trotskyist groups such as Militant and the Alliance for Workers&#x27; Liberty. In the same period, the term &quot;soft left&quot; was applied to supporters of the British Labour Party who were perceived to be more moderate and closer to the centre, accepting Keynesianism. Under the leadership of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, the Labour Party adopted the Third Way and rebranded itself as New Labour in order to promote the notion that it was less left-wing than it had been in the past to accommodate the neoliberal trend arising since the 1970s with the displacement of Keynesianism and post-war social democracy. One of the first actions of Ed Miliband, the Labour Party leader who succeeded Blair and Brown, was the rejection of the New Labour label and a promise to abandon the Third Way and turn back to the left. However, Labour&#x27;s voting record in the House of Commons from 2010 to 2015 indicated that the Labour Party under Miliband had maintained the same distance from the left as it did under Blair. In contrast, the election of Jeremy Corbyn as the Labour Party leader was viewed by scholars and political commentators as Labour turning back toward its more classical socialist roots, rejecting neoliberalism and the Third Way whilst supporting a democratic socialist society and an end to austerity measures.

<text>The &quot;Los Angeles&quot; class of submarines are nuclear-powered fast attack submarines (SSN) in service with the United States Navy. Also known as the 688 class (pronounced &quot;six-eighty-eight&quot;) after the hull number of lead vessel , 62 were built from 1972 to 1996, the latter 23 to an improved 688i standard. As of 2024, 24 of the &quot;Los Angeles&quot; class remain in commission—more than any other class in the world—and they account for almost half of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s 50 fast attack submarines.

Submarines of this class are named after American towns and cities, such as Albany, New York; Los Angeles, California; and Tucson, Arizona, with the exception of , named for the &quot;father of the nuclear Navy.&quot; This was a change from traditionally naming attack submarines after marine animals, such as or . Rickover explained the decision to name the submarines after cities (and occasionally politicians influential in defense issues) by observing that &quot;fish don&#x27;t vote.&quot;

== Development ==
In the late 1960s, the Soviet Union&#x27;s advances in submarine technology increasingly threatened the survivability of US Navy (USN) carrier battle groups. Soviet fast-attack submarines became capable of keeping pace with carrier groups, while their newer missile submarines could potentially overwhelm the group&#x27;s defenses with salvos of missiles. Development of the &quot;Los Angeles&quot; class commenced in 1967 as a response. The class originally had essentially the same weapons and sensors as the preceding , but was approximately 50% larger with &quot;major improvements&quot; in stealth and speed so that they too could keep up with carrier battle groups.

On 1 December 1976 General Dynamics Electric Boat (GDEB) submitted a $544 million claim related to its contract for 18 &quot;Los-Angeles&quot;-class submarines; the contractor alleged the USN made an undue amount of design changes while the government argued that Electric Boat mismanaged its operations. The USN and General Dynamics reached an $843 million settlement agreement in June 1978; the contract price was increased by $125 million, GDEB absorbed a $359 million loss, and the USN paid an additional $359 million under the authority of Public Law 85-804. The USN and General Dynamics had a further dispute in 1979–1980 when it was discovered that nonconforming steel had been used in the construction of the submarines and thousands of welds were found to be either defective or missing. This led General Dynamics to file a $100 million insurance claim to cover the costs of re-inspections of the yard&#x27;s work, &quot;thus, Electric Boat was asking the Navy to reimburse it for its own mis-management.&quot; The parties reached an agreement in 1981 whereby GDEB was awarded a firm contract for an additional 688-class boat and two options; the Navy needed GDEB&#x27;s shipbuilding capacity to achieve its procurement goals.

&quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarines were built in three successive flights:

==Design==

===Flights===
In 1982, after building 31 boats, the class underwent a minor redesign. The following eight that made up the second &quot;flight&quot; of subs had 12 new vertical launch tubes that could fire Tomahawk missiles. The last 23 had a significant upgrade with the 688i improvement program. These boats are quieter, with more advanced electronics, sensors, and noise-reduction technology. The diving planes are placed at the bow rather than on the sail, and are retractable. A further four boats were proposed by the Navy, but later cancelled.

===Capabilities===

According to the U.S. Department of Defense, the top speed of the submarines of the &quot;Los Angeles&quot; class is over , although the actual maximum is classified. Some published estimates have placed their top speed at . In his book &quot;Submarine: A Guided Tour Inside a Nuclear Warship&quot;, Tom Clancy estimated the top speed of &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarines at about .

The U.S. Navy gives the maximum operating depth of the &quot;Los Angeles&quot; class as , while Patrick Tyler, in his book &quot;Running Critical&quot;, suggests a maximum operating depth of . Although Tyler cites the 688-class design committee for this figure, the government has not commented on it. The maximum diving depth is according to &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships, 2004–2005 Edition&quot;, edited by Commodore Stephen Saunders of the Royal Navy.

===Weapons===

&quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarines carry about 25 torpedo tube-launched weapons, as well as Mark 67 and Mark 60 CAPTOR mines and were designed to launch Tomahawk cruise missiles, and Harpoon missiles horizontally (from the torpedo tubes). The last 31 boats of this class (Flight II and Flight III/688i) also have 12 dedicated vertical launching system tubes for launching Tomahawks. The tube configuration for the first two boats of Flight II differed from the later ones: &quot;Providence&quot; and &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; have four rows of three tubes vs. the inner two rows of four and outer two rows of two tubes found on other examples. The 688i (&quot;improved&quot;) model submarines are capable of deploying the Mk 67 Submarine Launched Mobile Mines.

===Control systems===
Over close to 40 years, the control suite of the class has changed dramatically. The class was originally equipped with the Mk 113 mod 10 fire control system, also known as the Pargo display program. The Mk 113 runs on a UYK-7 computer.

The Mk 117 FCS, the first &quot;all digital&quot; fire control system, replaced the Mk 113. The Mk 117 transferred the duties of the analog Mk 75 attack director to the UYK-7, and the digital Mk 81 weapon control consoles, removing the two analog conversions, and allowing &quot;all digital&quot; control of the digital Mk 48 control. The first 688 sub to be built with the Mk 117 was .

The Mark 1 Combat Control System/All Digital Attack Center replaced the Mk 117 FCS, on which it was based. The Mk 1 CCS was built by Lockheed Martin, and gave the class the ability to fire Tomahawk missiles. The CSS internal tracker model provides processing for both towed-array and spherical-array trackers. Trackers are signal followers that generate bearing, arrival angle, and frequency reports based on information received by an acoustic sensor. It incorporated the Gyro Static Navigator into the system in replacement of the AN/WSN-1 DMINS (Dual Mini Ship&#x27;s Inertial navigation system) of the earlier 688 class.

The Mk 1 CCS was replaced by the Mk 2, which was built by Raytheon. Mk 2 provides Tomahawk Block III vertical launch capability as well as fleet-requested improvements to Mk 48 ADCAP torpedo and Towed Array Target Motion Analysis operability. The Mk 2 CCS paired with the AN/BQQ-5E system is referred to as the QE-2&quot; system. The CCS MK2 Block 1 A/B system architecture extends the CCS MK2 tactical system with a network of tactical advanced computers (TAC-3). These TAC-3s are configured to support the SFMPL, NTCS-A, LINK-11 and ATWCS subsystems.

===Sensors===
====Sonar====
=====AN/BQQ-5=====
AN/BQQ-5 sensor suite consists of the AN/BQS-13 spherical sonar array and AN/UYK-44 computer. The AN/BQQ-5 was developed from the AN/BQQ-2 sonar system. The BQS 11, 12, and 13 spherical arrays have 1,241 transducers. Also equipped are a conformal hull array with 104 to 156 hydrophones and two towed arrays: the TB-12 (later replaced by the TB-16) and TB-23 or TB-29, of which there are multiple variants. There are five versions of the AN/BQQ-5 system, sequentially identified by letters A–E.

The 688i (Improved) subclass was initially equipped with the AN/BSY-1 SUBACS submarine advanced combat system that used an AN/BQQ-5E sensor system with updated computers and interface equipment. Development of the AN/BSY-1 and its sister the AN/BSY-2 for the was widely reported as one of the most problematic programs for the Navy, its cost and schedule suffering many setbacks.

A series of conformal passive hydrophones are hard-mounted to each side of the hull, using the AN/BQR-24 internal processor. The system uses FLIT (frequency line integration tracking) which homes in on precise narrowband frequencies of sound and, using the Doppler principle, can accurately provide firing solutions against very quiet submarines. The AN/BQQ-5&#x27;s hull array doubled the performance of its predecessors.

=====AN/BQQ-10=====
The AN/BQQ-5 system was replaced by the AN/BQQ-10 system. Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off-The-Shelf Insertion (A-RCI), designated AN/BQQ-10, is a four-phase program for transforming existing submarine sonar systems (AN/BSY-1, AN/BQQ-5, and AN/BQQ-6) from legacy systems to a more capable and flexible COTS/Open System Architecture (OSA) and also provide the submarine force with a common sonar system. A single A-RCI Multi-Purpose Processor (MPP) has as much computing power as the entire &quot;Los Angeles&quot; (SSN-688/688I) submarine fleet combined and will allow the development and use of complex algorithms previously beyond the reach of legacy processors. The use of COTS/OSA technologies and systems will enable rapid periodic updates to both software and hardware. COTS-based processors will allow computer power growth at a rate commensurate with the commercial industry.

===Engineering and auxiliary systems===

Two watertight compartments are used in the &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarines. The forward compartment contains crew living spaces, weapons-handling spaces, and control spaces not critical to recovering propulsion. The aft compartment contains the bulk of the submarine&#x27;s engineering systems, power generation turbines, and water-making equipment. Some submarines in the class are capable of delivering Navy SEALs through either a SEAL Delivery Vehicle deployed from the Dry Deck Shelter or the Advanced SEAL Delivery System mounted on the dorsal side, although the latter was cancelled in 2006 and removed from service in 2009. A variety of atmospheric control devices are used to allow the vessel to remain submerged for long periods of time without ventilating, including an electrolytic oxygen generator, which produces oxygen for the crew and hydrogen as a byproduct. The hydrogen is pumped overboard but there is always a risk of fire or explosion from this process.
While on the surface or at snorkel depth, the submarine may use the submarine&#x27;s auxiliary or emergency diesel generator for power or ventilation (e.g., following a fire). The diesel engine in a 688 class can be quickly started by compressed air during emergencies or to evacuate noxious (nonvolatile) gases from the boat, although &#x27;ventilation&#x27; requires raising a snorkel mast. During nonemergency situations, design constraints call for operators to allow the engine to reach normal operating temperatures before it is capable of producing full power, a process that may take from 20 to 30 minutes. However, the diesel generator can be immediately loaded to 100% power output, despite design criteria cautions, at the discretion of the submarine commander on the recommendation of the submarine&#x27;s engineer, if necessity dictates such actions to: (a) restore electrical power to the submarine, (b) prevent a reactor incident from occurring or escalating, or (c) to protect the lives of the crew or others as determined necessary by the commanding officer.

===Propulsion===
The &quot;Los Angeles&quot; class is powered by the General Electric S6G pressurized water reactor. The hot reactor coolant water heats water in the steam generators, producing steam to power the propulsion turbines and ship service turbine generators (SSTGs), which generate the submarine&#x27;s electrical power. The high-speed propulsion turbines drive the shaft and propeller through a reduction gear. In the case of a reactor plant casualty, the submarine has a diesel generator and a bank of batteries to provide electrical power. An emergency propulsion motor on the shaft line or a retractable 325-hp secondary propulsion motor power the submarine off the battery or diesel generator.

The S6G reactor plant was originally designed to use the D1G-2 core, similar to the D2G reactor used on the guided missile cruiser . The D1G-2 core had a rated thermal power of 150 MW and the turbines were rated at 30,000 shp. All &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarines from on were built with a D2W core and older submarines with D1G-2 cores have been refueled with D2W cores. The D2W core is rated at 165 MW and turbine power rose to approximately 33,500 shp.

== Boats in class ==
The class has a total of 62 boats divided into three flights as follows:
*31 × Flight I
*8 × Flight II with VLS
*23 × Flight III 688i (Improved)

=== Submarines ===

Among the retired boats, a few were in commission for nearly 40 years or more, including &quot;Bremerton&quot; (40), &quot;Jacksonville&quot; (40), &quot;La Jolla&quot; (38) and &quot;San Francisco&quot; (41). With a wide variance in longevity, twelve boats were laid up halfway through their projected lifespans, with &quot;Baltimore&quot; being the youngest to be retired at only 15 years, 11 months. Another five boats were also laid up early (within 20–25 years), due to their midlife reactor refueling being cancelled, and one was lost during overhaul due to arson. All retired boats have been or will be scrapped per the Navy&#x27;s Ship-Submarine Recycling Program. In addition, two boats, &quot;La Jolla&quot; and &quot;San Francisco&quot;, have been converted to moored training ships.

==In popular culture==
* &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarines have been featured prominently in numerous Tom Clancy literary works and film adaptations, most notably in &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;. Other appearances include in the novel &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; and in &quot;SSN&quot;. In addition to fictional works, Clancy&#x27;s 1993 non-fiction book &quot;Submarine: A Guided Tour Inside a Nuclear Warship&quot; features an in-depth exploration of .

* &quot;688 Attack Sub&quot;, a 1989 MS-DOS submarine simulator, allowed the player to control a &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarine during a set of Cold War missions. The game was also released for the Sega Genesis console.
* &quot;Jane&#x27;s 688(i) Hunter/Killer&quot;, &quot;Sub Command&quot;, &quot;Dangerous Waters&quot;, developed by Sonalysts Inc., and &quot;Cold Waters&quot; by Killerfish Games, are video games where players control the 688i &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarine.

<text>According to Roman tradition, Lucretia ( , ; died ), anglicized as Lucrece, was a noblewoman in ancient Rome. Sextus Tarquinius (Tarquin) raped her. Her subsequent suicide precipitated a rebellion that overthrew the Roman monarchy and led to the transition of Roman government from a kingdom to a republic. After Tarquin raped Lucretia, flames of dissatisfaction were kindled over the tyrannical methods of Tarquin&#x27;s father, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the last king of Rome. As a result, the prominent families instituted a republic, drove the extensive royal family of Tarquin from Rome, and successfully defended the republic against attempted Etruscan and Latin intervention.

There are no contemporary sources of Lucretia and Tarquin’s rape of her. Information regarding Lucretia, how and when Tarquin raped her, her suicide, and the consequence of this being the start of the Roman Republic come from the accounts of Roman historian Livy and Greco-Roman historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus approximately 500 years later. Secondary sources on the establishment of the republic reiterate the basic events of Lucretia&#x27;s story, though accounts vary slightly between historians. The evidence points to the historical existence of a woman named Lucretia and an event that played a critical part in the downfall of the monarchy. However, specific details are debatable and vary depending on the writer. According to modern sources, Lucretia&#x27;s narrative is considered a part of Roman . Much like the rape of the Sabine women, Lucretia&#x27;s story provides an explanation for historical change in Rome through a recounting of violence against women by men. 

==Early life and marriage==

Lucretia was the daughter of magistrate Spurius Lucretius and the wife of Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus. The marriage between Lucretia and Collatinus was depicted as the ideal Roman union, as both Lucretia and Collatinus were faithfully devoted to one another. According to Livy, Lucretia was an exemplar of &quot;beauty and purity,&quot; as well as Roman standards. While her husband was away at battle, Lucretia would stay at home and pray for his safe return. As with Livy, Dionysius&#x27; depiction of Lucretia separates her from the rest of Roman women in a story about the men returning home from a battle. The narrative begins with a bet between the sons of Tarquinius and their kinsmen, Brutus and Collatinus. The men fight over which of their wives best exemplified sophrosyne, an ideal of superb moral and intellectual character. The men return home to find the women socializing with each other, presumably in conversation. By contrast, they find Lucretia home alone, working with her wool in silence. Because of her devotion to her husband, Roman writers Livy and Dionysius outline Lucretia as the role model for Roman girls.

==Rape==

As the events of the story move rapidly, the date that Tarquin raped Lucretia is most likely the same year as the first of the &quot;fasti&quot;. Dionysius of Halicarnassus sets this year &quot;at the beginning of the sixty-eighth Olympiad ... Isagoras being the annual archon at Athens&quot;; that is, 508/507 BC. According to Dionysius, Lucretia therefore died in 508 BC. This approximate date is met with consensus by other historians; however, the exact year is debatable within a range of about five years.

While engaged in the siege of Ardea, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the last king of Rome, sent his son, Tarquin, on a military errand to Collatia. Tarquin was received with great hospitality at the governor&#x27;s mansion, home of Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, son of the king&#x27;s cousin, Arruns Tarquinius, former governor of Collatia and first of the Tarquinii Collatini. Spurius Lucretius, father of Collatinus&#x27; wife Lucretia and prefect of Rome, made sure that the king&#x27;s son was treated as a guest and a figure of his rank.

In a variant of the story, Tarquin and Collatinus, at a wine party on furlough, were debating the virtues of wives when Collatinus volunteered to settle the debate. In order to do so, he proposed riding to his home to observe Lucretia. Upon their arrival, she was weaving with her maids. The party awarded her the palm of victory and Collatinus invited them to stay, but for the time being they returned to camp.

Later in the night, Tarquin entered Lucretia&#x27;s bedroom, quietly avoiding the slaves who were sleeping at her door. When she awoke, he identified himself and offered her two choices: he would rape her and she would become his wife and future queen, or he would kill her and one of her slaves, place the bodies together, and claim he had caught her having adulterous sex (see sexuality in ancient Rome for Roman attitudes toward sex). In the alternative story, he returned from camp a few days later with one companion to take Collatinus up on his invitation to visit and was lodged in a guest bedroom. He entered Lucretia&#x27;s room while she lay naked in her bed and started to wash her belly with water, which woke her up. Tarquin tried to convince Lucretia that she should be with him, using &quot;every argument likely to influence a female heart.&quot; However, Lucretia stood firm in her devotion to her husband, even when Tarquin threatened her life and honor, while ultimately raping her.

==Suicide==
===&quot;The account of Dionysius of Halicarnassus&quot;===

In Dionysius of Halicarnassus&#x27; account, the following day Lucretia dressed in black and went to her father&#x27;s house in Rome and cast herself down in the supplicant&#x27;s position (embracing the knees), weeping in front of her father and husband. She asked to explain herself and insisted on summoning witnesses before she told them about her rape. After disclosing that Tarquin had raped her, she asked them for vengeance, a plea that could not be ignored because she was speaking to the chief magistrate of Rome. While the men debated the proper course of action, Lucretia drew a concealed dagger and stabbed herself in the heart. She died in her father&#x27;s arms, while the women present lamented her death. According to Dionysius, &quot;This dreadful scene struck the Romans who were present with so much horror and compassion that they all cried out with one voice that they would rather die a thousand deaths in defense of their liberty than suffer such outrages to be committed by the tyrants.&quot;

===&quot;The account of Livy&quot;===
In Livy&#x27;s version, Lucretia acts quickly and calmly, deciding not to go to Rome, but instead sends for her father and her husband, asking them to bring one friend each to act as a witness. Those selected were Publius Valerius Publicola from Rome and Lucius Junius Brutus from the camp at Ardea. Once the men found Lucretia in her room, her explanation of Tarquin’s rape of her leads the men to state that &quot;it is the mind that sins, not the body, and where there has been no consent there is no guilt.&quot; After exacting an oath of vengeance while the men were discussing the matter—&quot;Pledge me your solemn word that the adulterer shall not go unpunished&quot;— Lucretia drew a poignard and stabbed herself in her heart.

===&quot;The account of Dio&quot;===
In Dio&#x27;s version, Lucretia&#x27;s request for revenge is: &quot;And, whereas I (for I am a woman) shall act in a manner which is fitting for me: you, if you are men, and if you care for your wives and children, exact vengeance on my behalf and free your selves and show the tyrants what sort of woman they outraged, and what sort of men were her menfolk!&quot; She follows her statement by plunging the dagger into her chest and promptly dying.

In this version, Collatinus and Brutus were encountered returning to Rome unaware of Tarquin&#x27;s rape of Lucretia, were briefed, and were brought to the death scene. Brutus happened to be a politically motivated participant. By kinship he was a Tarquin on his mother&#x27;s side, the son of Tarquinia, daughter of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, the third king before last. He was a candidate for the throne if anything should happen to Superbus. By law, however, because he was a Junius on his father&#x27;s side, he was thus not a Tarquin and therefore could later propose the exile of the Tarquins without fear for himself. Superbus had taken his inheritance and left him a pittance, keeping him at court for entertainment.

Collatinus, seeing his wife dead, became distraught. He held her, kissed her, called her name and spoke to her. Dio stated that after seeing the hand of Destiny in these events, Brutus called the grieving party to order, explained that his simplicity had been a sham, and proposed that they drive the Tarquins from Rome. Grasping the bloody dagger, he swore by Mars and all the other gods that he would do everything in his power to overthrow the dominion of the Tarquinii. He stated that he would neither be reconciled to the tyrants himself, nor tolerate any who should be reconciled to them, but would look upon every man who thought otherwise as an enemy, and til his death would pursue with unrelenting hatred both the tyranny and its abettors; and if he should violate his oath, he prayed that he and his children might meet with the same end as Lucretia.

He passed the dagger around and each mourner swore the same oath by it. The primary sources of both Dio and Livy agree on this point: Livy&#x27;s version is:

By this blood—most pure before the outrage wrought by the king&#x27;s son—I swear, and you, O gods, I call to witness that I will drive hence Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, together with his cursed wife and his whole blood, with fire and sword and every means in my power, and I will not suffer them or anyone else to reign in Rome.

==Revolution==
The newly sworn revolutionary committee paraded the bloody corpse of Lucretia to the Roman Forum where it remained on display as a reminder of the dishonor committed. At the forum, the committee heard grievances against the Tarquins and began to enlist an army to abolish the monarchy. Brutus &quot;urged them to act as men and Romans and take up arms against their insolent foes&quot; in response to the death of a dutiful wife. The gates of Rome were blockaded by the new revolutionary soldiers and more were sent to guard Collatia. By now a crowd had gathered in the forum; the presence of the magistrates among the revolutionaries kept them in good order.

Brutus was the Tribune of the Celeres, a minor office of some religious duties, which as a magistracy gave him the theoretical power to summon the curiae, an organization of patrician families used mainly to ratify the decrees of the king. Summoning them on the spot, he transformed the crowd into an authoritative legislative assembly and began to address them in one of the more noted and effective speeches of ancient Rome.

He began by revealing that his pose as a fool was a sham designed to protect him against an evil king. He levelled a number of charges against the king and his family: Tarquin’s rape of Lucretia, whom everyone could see on the dais, the king&#x27;s tyranny, the forced labor of the plebeians in the ditches and sewers of Rome. In his speech, he pointed out that Superbus had come to rule by the murder of Servius Tullius, his wife&#x27;s father, next-to-the-last king of Rome. He &quot;solemnly invoked the gods as the avengers of murdered parents.&quot; He suggested that the king&#x27;s wife, Tullia, was in fact in Rome and probably was a witness to the proceedings from her palace near the forum. Seeing herself the target of so much animosity, she fled from the palace in fear of her life and proceeded to the camp at Ardea.

Brutus opened a debate on the form of government Rome ought to have, a debate at which many patricians spoke. In summation, he proposed the banishment of the Tarquins from all the territories of Rome and the appointment of an interrex to nominate new magistrates and conduct an election of ratification. They decided on a republican form of government with two consuls in place of a king executing the will of a patrician senate. This was a temporary measure until they could consider the details more carefully. Brutus renounced all right to the throne. In subsequent years, the powers of the king were divided among various elected magistracies.A final vote of the curiae carried the interim constitution. Spurius Lucretius was swiftly elected interrex; he was prefect of the city already. He proposed Brutus and Collatinus as the first two consuls and that choice was ratified by the curiae. Needing to acquire the assent of the population as a whole, they paraded Lucretia through the streets, summoning the plebeians to a legal assembly in the forum. Once there, they heard a constitutional speech by Brutus. It began:

A general election was held and the vote won in favor of the republic. This ended the monarchy, and during these proceedings Lucretia was still displayed in the forum.

The constitutional consequences of this event ended the reign of the hereditary king; however, later emperors were absolute rulers in all but name. This constitutional tradition prevented both Julius Caesar and Octavian Augustus from accepting a crown; instead, they had to devise a confluence of several republican offices onto their persons in order to secure absolute power. Their successors both in Rome and in Constantinople adhered to this tradition in essence, and the office of German Holy Roman Emperor remained elective rather than hereditary—up to its abolition in the Napoleonic Wars, over 2300 years later.
==In literature and music==
Lucretia became an important embodiment of political and literary ideals for different authors throughout the ages, specifically because &quot;stories of sexual violence against women serve as foundational myths of Western culture.&quot;

Livy&#x27;s account in &quot;Ab Urbe Condita Libri&quot; (c. 25–8 BC) is the earliest surviving full historical treatment. In his account, her husband has boasted of the virtue of his wife to Tarquin and others. Livy contrasts the virtue of the Roman Lucretia, who remained in her room weaving, with the Etruscan ladies who feasted with friends. Ovid recounts the story of Lucretia in Book II of his &quot;Fasti&quot;, published in 8 AD, concentrating on the bold over-reaching character of Tarquin. Later, St. Augustine made use of the figure of Lucretia in &quot;The City of God&quot; (published 426 AD) to defend the honour of Christian women who had been raped in the sack of Rome and had not committed suicide.

The story of Lucretia was a popular moral tale in the later Middle Ages. Lucretia appears to Dante in the section of Limbo, reserved for the nobles of Rome and other &quot;virtuous pagans&quot;, in Canto IV of the &quot;Inferno&quot;. Christine de Pizan used Lucretia, just as St. Augustine of Hippo did, in her &quot;City of Ladies&quot;, defending a woman&#x27;s sanctity.

The myth is recounted in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Good Women&quot;, and it follows a similar storyline to Livy&#x27;s. Lucretia calls for her father and husband, but Chaucer&#x27;s tale also has her call for her mother and attendants as well, whereas Livy&#x27;s has both her father and husband bring a friend as witness. The tale also deviates from Livy&#x27;s account, as it begins with her husband coming home to surprise her, rather than the men placing a bet on the virtue of their wives.John Gower&#x27;s &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot; (Book VII), and John Lydgate&#x27;s &quot;Fall of Princes&quot; recount the myth of Lucretia. Gower&#x27;s work is a collection of narrative poems. In Book VII, he tells the &quot;Tale of the Rape of Lucrece.&quot; Lydgate&#x27;s work is a long poem containing stories and myths about various kings and princes who fell from power. It follows their lives from their rise into power and their fall into adversity. Lydgate&#x27;s poem mentions the fall of Tarquin, the rape and suicide of Lucretia, and her speech prior to death.

Lucretia&#x27;s rape and suicide is also the subject of William Shakespeare&#x27;s 1594 long poem &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot;, which draws extensively on Ovid&#x27;s treatment of the story; he also mentions her in &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, in &quot;As You Like It&quot;, and in &quot;Twelfth Night,&quot; wherein Malvolio authenticates his fateful letter by spotting Olivia&#x27;s Lucrece seal. Shakespeare also alludes to her in &quot;Macbeth&quot;, and in &quot;Cymbeline&quot; he further refers to the story, though without mentioning Lucretia by name. Shakespeare&#x27;s poem, based on the rape of Lucretia, draws on the beginning of the Livy&#x27;s account of the incident. The poem begins with a bet between husbands about the virtuousness of their wives. Shakespeare draws on the idea of Lucretia as a moral agent, as Livy did, when he explores his characters&#x27; response to death and her unwillingness to yield to her rapist. A direct excerpt from Livy is used when Shakespeare prefaces his poem with a brief prose called &quot;Argument&quot;. This is the internal deliberation Lucrece suffered from, following the rape.

Niccolò Machiavelli&#x27;s comedy &quot;La Mandragola&quot; is loosely based on the Lucretia story.

She is also mentioned in the poem &quot;Appius and Virginia&quot; by John Webster and Thomas Heywood, which includes the following lines:

Thomas Heywood&#x27;s play &quot;The Rape of Lucretia&quot; dates from 1607. The subject also enjoyed a revival in the mid twentieth century; André Obey&#x27;s 1931 play &quot;&quot; was adapted by librettist Ronald Duncan for &quot;The Rape of Lucretia&quot;, a 1946 opera by Benjamin Britten which premiered at Glyndebourne. Ernst Krenek set Emmet Lavery&#x27;s libretto &quot;Tarquin&quot; (1940), a version in a contemporary setting.

Jacques Gallot (died ) composed the allemandes &quot;Lucrèce&quot; and &quot;Tarquin&quot; for baroque lute.

In Samuel Richardson&#x27;s 1740 novel &quot;Pamela&quot;, Mr. B. cites the story of Lucretia as a reason why Pamela ought not fear for her reputation, should he rape her. Pamela quickly sets him straight with a better reading of the story. Colonial Mexican poet Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz also mentions Lucretia in her poem &quot;Redondillas,&quot; a commentary on prostitution and who is to blame.

In 1769, doctor Juan Ramis wrote a tragedy in Menorca entitled &quot;Lucrecia&quot;. The play is written in the Catalan language using a neoclassical style and is a significant work of the eighteenth century written in this language.

In 1932, the play &quot;Lucrece&quot; was produced on Broadway, starring legendary actress Katharine Cornell in the title part. It was mostly performed in pantomime.

In 1989, a song entitled &quot;The Rape of Lucretia&quot; was released by the Scottish musician Momus.

In Donna Leon&#x27;s 2009 Venetian novel, &quot;About Face&quot;, Franca Marinello refers to the tale of Tarquin and Lucrezia, as recounted in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot; (Book II, for February 24, &quot;Regifugium&quot;) to explain her actions to Commissario Brunetti.

American thrash metal band Megadeth used the name Lucretia as the title for the sixth track on their 1990 release &quot;Rust In Peace&quot;. The song doesn’t have a direct connection to the story of Lucretia, rather Lucretia acting as a muse for Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine reaching sobriety after a heavy drug and alcohol addiction during the 1980s.

==Subject in art==
Since the Renaissance, the suicide of Lucretia has been an enduring subject for visual artists, including Titian, Rembrandt, Dürer, Raphael, Botticelli, Jörg Breu the Elder, Johannes Moreelse, Artemisia Gentileschi, Damià Campeny, Eduardo Rosales, Lucas Cranach the Elder, and others. Most commonly, either the moment of the rape is shown, or Lucretia is shown alone at the moment of her suicide. In either situation, her clothing is loosened or absent, while Tarquin is normally clothed.

The subject was one of a group showing women from legend or the Bible who were either powerless, such as Susanna and Verginia, or only able to escape their situations by suicide, such as Dido of Carthage and Lucretia. These formed a counterpoint to, or sub-group of, the set of subjects known as the Power of Women, showing female violence against, or domination of, men. These were often depicted by the same artists, and especially popular in Northern Renaissance art. The story of Esther lay somewhere between these two extremes.

The subject of Lucretia spinning with her ladies, is sometimes depicted, as in a series of four engravings of her story by Hendrick Goltzius, which also includes a banquet.

<text>The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP ) is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network. Directory services play an important role in developing intranet and Internet applications by allowing the sharing of information about users, systems, networks, services, and applications throughout the network. As examples, directory services may provide any organized set of records, often with a hierarchical structure, such as a corporate email directory. Similarly, a telephone directory is a list of subscribers with an address and a phone number.

LDAP is specified in a series of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Standard Track publications known as Request for Comments (RFCs), using the description language ASN.1. The latest specification is Version 3, published as RFC 4511 (a road map to the technical specifications is provided by RFC4510).

A common use of LDAP is to provide a central place to store usernames and passwords. This allows many different applications and services to connect to the LDAP server to validate users.

LDAP is based on a simpler subset of the standards contained within the X.500 standard. Because of this relationship, LDAP is sometimes called X.500-lite.

==History==
Telecommunication companies&#x27; understanding of directory requirements were well developed after some 70 years of producing and managing telephone directories. These companies introduced the concept of directory services to information technology and computer networking, their input culminating in the comprehensive X.500 specification, a suite of protocols produced by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in the 1980s.

X.500 directory services were traditionally accessed via the X.500 Directory Access Protocol (DAP), which required the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) protocol stack. LDAP was originally intended to be a lightweight alternative protocol for accessing X.500 directory services through the simpler (and now widespread) TCP/IP protocol stack. This model of directory access was borrowed from the DIXIE and Directory Assistance Service protocols.

The protocol was originally created by Tim Howes of the University of Michigan, Steve Kille of Isode Limited, Colin Robbins of Nexor and Wengyik Yeong of Performance Systems International, circa 1993, as a successor to DIXIE and DAS. Mark Wahl of Critical Angle Inc., Tim Howes, and Steve Kille started work in 1996 on a new version of LDAP, LDAPv3, under the aegis of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). LDAPv3, first published in 1997, superseded LDAPv2 and added support for extensibility, integrated the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, and better aligned the protocol to the 1993 edition of X.500. Further development of the LDAPv3 specifications themselves and of numerous extensions adding features to LDAPv3 has come through the IETF.

In the early engineering stages of LDAP, it was known as &quot;Lightweight Directory Browsing Protocol&quot;, or &quot;LDBP&quot;. It was renamed with the expansion of the scope of the protocol beyond directory browsing and searching, to include directory update functions. It was given its &quot;Lightweight&quot; name because it was not as network intensive as its DAP predecessor and thus was more easily implemented over the Internet due to its relatively modest bandwidth usage.

LDAP has influenced subsequent Internet protocols, including later versions of X.500, XML Enabled Directory (XED), Directory Service Markup Language (DSML), Service Provisioning Markup Language (SPML), and the Service Location Protocol (SLP). It is also used as the basis for Microsoft&#x27;s Active Directory.

==Protocol overview==
A client starts an LDAP session by connecting to an LDAP server, called a Directory System Agent (DSA), by default on TCP and UDP port 389, or on port 636 for LDAPS (LDAP over TLS/SSL, see below). The client then sends an operation request to the server, and a server sends responses in return. With some exceptions, the client does not need to wait for a response before sending the next request, and the server may send the responses in any order. All information is transmitted using Basic Encoding Rules (BER).

The client may request the following operations:
* StartTLS – use the LDAPv3 Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension for a secure connection
* Bind – authenticate and specify LDAP protocol version
* Search – search for and/or retrieve directory entries
* Compare – test if a named entry contains a given attribute value
* Add a new entry
* Delete an entry
* Modify an entry
* Modify Distinguished Name (DN) – move or rename an entry
* Abandon – abort a previous request
* Extended Operation – generic operation used to define other operations
* Unbind – close the connection (not the inverse of Bind)

In addition the server may send &quot;Unsolicited Notifications&quot; that are not responses to any request, e.g. before the connection is timed out.

A common alternative method of securing LDAP communication is using an SSL tunnel. The default port for LDAP over SSL is 636. The use of LDAP over SSL was common in LDAP Version 2 (LDAPv2) but it was never standardized in any formal specification. This usage has been deprecated along with LDAPv2, which was officially retired in 2003.

==Directory structure==
The protocol provides an interface with directories that follow the 1993 edition of the X.500 model:
* An entry consists of a set of attributes.
* An attribute has a name (an &quot;attribute type&quot; or &quot;attribute description&quot;) and one or more values. The attributes are defined in a &quot;schema&quot; (see below).
* Each entry has a unique identifier: its &quot;Distinguished Name&quot; (DN). This consists of its &quot;Relative Distinguished Name&quot; (RDN), constructed from some attribute(s) in the entry, followed by the parent entry&#x27;s DN. Think of the DN as the full file path and the RDN as its relative filename in its parent folder (e.g. if codice_1 were the DN, then codice_2 would be the RDN).

A DN may change over the lifetime of the entry, for instance, when entries are moved within a tree. To reliably and unambiguously identify entries, a UUID might be provided in the set of the entry&#x27;s &quot;operational attributes&quot;.

An entry can look like this when represented in LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF), a plain text format (as opposed a binary protocol such as LDAP itself):

dn: cn=John Doe,dc=example,dc=com
cn: John Doe
givenName: John
sn: Doe
telephoneNumber: +1 888 555 6789
telephoneNumber: +1 888 555 1232
mail: john@example.com
manager: cn=Barbara Doe,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: organizationalPerson
objectClass: person
objectClass: top

&quot;codice_3&quot; is the distinguished name of the entry; it is neither an attribute nor a part of the entry. &quot;codice_4&quot; is the entry&#x27;s RDN (Relative Distinguished Name), and &quot;codice_5&quot; is the DN of the parent entry, where &quot;codice_6&quot; denotes &#x27;Domain Component&#x27;. The other lines show the attributes in the entry. Attribute names are typically mnemonic strings, like &quot;codice_7&quot; for common name, &quot;codice_6&quot; for domain component, &quot;codice_9&quot; for email address, and &quot;codice_10&quot; for surname.

A server holds a subtree starting from a specific entry, e.g. &quot;codice_5&quot; and its children. Servers may also hold references to other servers, so an attempt to access &quot;codice_12&quot; could return a &quot;referral&quot; or &quot;continuation reference&quot; to a server that holds that part of the directory tree. The client can then contact the other server. Some servers also support &quot;chaining&quot;, which means the server contacts the other server and returns the results to the client.

LDAP rarely defines any ordering: The server may return the values of an attribute, the attributes in an entry, and the entries found by a search operation in any order. This follows from the formal definitions - an entry is defined as a set of attributes, and an attribute is a set of values, and sets need not be ordered.

==Operations==

===Add===
The ADD operation inserts a new entry into the directory-server database. If the distinguished name in the add request already exists in the directory, then the server will not add a duplicate entry but will set the result code in the add result to decimal 68, &quot;entryAlreadyExists&quot;.
* LDAP-compliant servers will never dereference the distinguished name transmitted in the add request when attempting to locate the entry, that is, distinguished names are never de-aliased.
* LDAP-compliant servers will ensure that the distinguished name and all attributes conform to naming standards.
* The entry to be added must not exist, and the immediate superior must exist.

dn: uid=user,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: add
objectClass:top
objectClass:person
uid: user
sn: last-name
cn: common-name
userPassword: password
In the above example, codice_13 must not exist, and codice_14 must exist.

===Bind (authenticate)===
When an LDAP session is created, that is, when an LDAP client connects to the server, the authentication state of the session
is set to anonymous. The BIND operation establishes the authentication state for a session.

Simple BIND and SASL PLAIN can send the user&#x27;s DN and password in plaintext, so the connections utilizing either Simple or SASL PLAIN
should be encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). The server typically checks the password against the codice_15
attribute in the named entry. Anonymous BIND (with empty DN and password) resets the connection to anonymous state.

SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) BIND provides authentication services through a
wide range of mechanisms, e.g. Kerberos or the client certificate sent with TLS.

BIND also sets the LDAP protocol version by sending a version number in the form of an integer. If the client requests a version that the server does not support, the server must set the result code in the BIND response to the code for a protocol error. Normally clients should use LDAPv3, which is the
default in the protocol but not always in LDAP libraries.

BIND had to be the first operation in a session in LDAPv2, but is not required as of LDAPv3. In LDAPv3, each
successful BIND request changes the authentication state of the session and each unsuccessful BIND request resets the authentication state
of the session.

===Delete===
To delete an entry, an LDAP client transmits a properly formed delete request to the server.
* A delete request must contain the distinguished name of the entry to be deleted
* Request controls may also be attached to the delete request
* Servers do not dereference aliases when processing a delete request
* Only leaf entries (entries with no subordinates) may be deleted by a delete request. Some servers support an operational attribute codice_16 whose value indicates whether an entry has any subordinate entries, and some servers support an operational attribute codice_17 indicating the number of entries subordinate to the entry containing the codice_17 attribute.
* Some servers support the subtree delete request control permitting deletion of the DN and all objects subordinate to the DN, subject to access controls. Delete requests are subject to access controls, that is, whether a connection with a given authentication state will be permitted to delete a given entry is governed by server-specific access control mechanisms.

===Search and compare===
The Search operation is used to both search for and read entries. Its parameters are:
; baseObject : The name of the base object entry (or possibly the root) relative to which the search is to be performed.
; scope : What elements below the baseObject to search. This can be codice_19 (search just the named entry, typically used to read one entry), codice_20 (entries immediately below the base DN), or codice_21 (the entire subtree starting at the base DN).
; filter : Criteria to use in selecting elements within scope. For example, the filter codice_22 will select &quot;persons&quot; (elements of objectClass codice_23) where the matching rules for codice_24 and codice_9 determine whether the values for those attributes match the filter assertion. Note that a common misconception is that LDAP data is case-sensitive, whereas in fact matching rules and ordering rules determine matching, comparisons, and relative value relationships. If the example filters were required to match the case of the attribute value, an &quot;extensible match filter&quot; must be used, for example, codice_26
; derefAliases : Whether and how to follow alias entries (entries that refer to other entries),
; attributes : Which attributes to return in result entries.
; sizeLimit, timeLimit : Maximum number of entries to return, and maximum time to allow search to run. These values, however, cannot override any restrictions the server places on size limit and time limit.
; typesOnly : Return attribute types only, not attribute values.

The server returns the matching entries and potentially continuation references. These may be returned in any order. The final result will include the result code.

The Compare operation takes a DN, an attribute name and an attribute value, and checks if the named entry contains that attribute with that value.

===Modify===
The MODIFY operation is used by LDAP clients to request that the LDAP server make changes to existing entries. Attempts to modify entries that do not exist will fail. MODIFY requests are subject to access controls as implemented by the server.

The MODIFY operation requires that the distinguished name (DN) of the entry be specified, and a sequence of changes. Each change in the sequence must be one of:
* add (add a new value, which must not already exist in the attribute)
* delete (delete an existing value)
* replace (replace an existing value with a new value)

LDIF example of adding a value to an attribute:
dn: dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
add: cn
cn: the-new-cn-value-to-be-added


To replace the value of an existing attribute, use the codice_27 keyword. If the attribute is multi-valued, the client must specify the value of the attribute to update.

To delete an attribute from an entry, use the keyword codice_28 and the changetype designator codice_29. If the attribute is multi-valued, the client must specify the value of the attribute to delete.

There is also a Modify-Increment extension which allows an incrementable attribute value to be incremented by a specified amount. The following example using LDIF increments codice_30 by codice_31:
dn: uid=user.0,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
increment: employeeNumber
employeeNumber: 5


When LDAP servers are in a replicated topology, LDAP clients should consider using the post-read control to verify updates instead of a search after an update. The post-read control is designed so that applications need not issue a search request after an update – it is bad form to retrieve an entry for the sole purpose of checking that an update worked because of the replication eventual consistency model. An LDAP client should not assume that it connects to the same directory server for each request because architects may have placed load-balancers or LDAP proxies or both between LDAP clients and servers.

===Modify DN===
Modify DN (move/rename entry) takes the new RDN (Relative Distinguished Name), optionally the new parent&#x27;s DN, and a flag that indicates whether to delete the value(s) in the entry that match the old RDN. The server may support renaming of entire directory subtrees.

An update operation is atomic: Other operations will see either the new entry or the old one. On the other hand, LDAP does not define transactions of multiple operations: If you read an entry and then modify it, another client may have updated the entry in the meantime. Servers may implement extensions that support this, though.

===Extended operations===
The Extended Operation is a generic LDAP operation that can define new operations that were not part of the original protocol specification. StartTLS is one of the most significant extensions. Other examples include Cancel and Password Modify.

====StartTLS====
The StartTLS operation establishes Transport Layer Security (the descendant of SSL) on the connection. It can provide data confidentiality (to protect data from being observed by third parties) and/or data integrity protection (which protects the data from tampering). During TLS negotiation the server sends its X.509 certificate to prove its identity. The client may also send a certificate to prove its identity. After doing so, the client may then use SASL/EXTERNAL. By using the SASL/EXTERNAL, the client requests the server derive its identity from credentials provided at a lower level (such as TLS). Though technically the server may use any identity information established at any lower level, typically the server will use the identity information established by TLS.

Servers also often support the non-standard &quot;LDAPS&quot; (&quot;Secure LDAP&quot;, commonly known as &quot;LDAP over SSL&quot;) protocol on a separate port, by default 636. LDAPS differs from LDAP in two ways:
1) upon connect, the client and server establish TLS before any LDAP messages are transferred (without a StartTLS operation) and
2) the LDAPS connection must be closed upon TLS closure.

Some &quot;LDAPS&quot; client libraries only encrypt communication; they do not check the host name against the name in the supplied certificate.

===Abandon===
The Abandon operation requests that the server abort an operation named by a message ID. The server need not honor the request. Neither Abandon nor a successfully abandoned operation send a response. A similar Cancel extended operation does send responses, but not all implementations support this.

===Unbind===
The Unbind operation abandons any outstanding operations and closes the connection. It has no response. The name is of historical origin, and is &quot;not&quot; the opposite of the Bind operation.

Clients can abort a session by simply closing the connection, but they should use Unbind. Unbind allows the server to gracefully close the connection and free resources that it would otherwise keep for some time until discovering the client had abandoned the connection. It also instructs the server to cancel operations that can be canceled, and to not send responses for operations that cannot be canceled.

==URI scheme==
An LDAP uniform resource identifier (URI) scheme exists, which clients support in varying degrees, and servers return in referrals and continuation references (see RFC 4516):

 ldap://host:port/DN?attributes?scope?filter?extensions

Most of the components described below are optional.
* &quot;host&quot; is the FQDN or IP address of the LDAP server to search.
* &quot;port&quot; is the network port (default port 389) of the LDAP server.
* &quot;DN&quot; is the distinguished name to use as the search base.
* &quot;attributes&quot; is a comma-separated list of attributes to retrieve.
* &quot;scope&quot; specifies the search scope and can be &quot;base&quot; (the default), &quot;one&quot; or &quot;sub&quot;.
* &quot;filter&quot; is a search filter. For example, codice_32 as defined in RFC 4515.
* &quot;extensions&quot; are extensions to the LDAP URL format.

For example, &quot;codice_33&quot; refers to all user attributes in John Doe&#x27;s entry in codice_34, while &quot;codice_35&quot; searches for the entry in the default server (note the triple slash, omitting the host, and the double question mark, omitting the attributes). As in other URLs, special characters must be percent-encoded.

There is a similar non-standard codice_36 URI scheme for LDAP over SSL. This should not be confused with LDAP with TLS, which is achieved using the StartTLS operation using the standard codice_37 scheme.

==Schema==
The contents of the entries in a subtree are governed by a directory schema, a set of definitions and constraints concerning the structure of the directory information tree (DIT).

The schema of a Directory Server defines a set of rules that govern the kinds of information that the server can hold. It has a number of elements, including:
* Attribute Syntaxes—Provide information about the kind of information that can be stored in an attribute.
* Matching Rules—Provide information about how to make comparisons against attribute values.
* Matching Rule Uses—Indicate which attribute types may be used in conjunction with a particular matching rule.
* Attribute Types—Define an object identifier (OID) and a set of names that may refer to a given attribute, and associates that attribute with a syntax and set of matching rules.
* Object Classes—Define named collections of attributes and classify them into sets of required and optional attributes.
* Name Forms—Define rules for the set of attributes that should be included in the RDN for an entry.
* Content Rules—Define additional constraints about the object classes and attributes that may be used in conjunction with an entry.
* Structure Rule—Define rules that govern the kinds of subordinate entries that a given entry may have.

Attributes are the elements responsible for storing information in a directory, and the schema defines the rules for which attributes may be used in an entry, the kinds of values that those attributes may have, and how clients may interact with those values.

Clients may learn about the schema elements that the server supports by retrieving an appropriate subschema subentry.

The schema defines &quot;object classes&quot;. Each entry must have an objectClass attribute, containing named classes defined in the schema. The schema definition of the classes of an entry defines what kind of object the entry may represent - e.g. a person, organization or domain. The object class definitions also define the list of attributes that must contain values and the list of attributes which may contain values.

For example, an entry representing a person might belong to the classes &quot;top&quot; and &quot;person&quot;. Membership in the &quot;person&quot; class would require the entry to contain the &quot;sn&quot; and &quot;cn&quot; attributes, and allow the entry also to contain &quot;userPassword&quot;, &quot;telephoneNumber&quot;, and other attributes. Since entries may have multiple ObjectClasses values, each entry has a complex of optional and mandatory attribute sets formed from the union of the object classes it represents. ObjectClasses can be inherited, and a single entry can have multiple ObjectClasses values that define the available and required attributes of the entry itself. A parallel to the schema of an objectClass is a class definition and an instance in Object-oriented programming, representing LDAP objectClass and LDAP entry, respectively.

Directory servers may publish the directory schema controlling an entry at a base DN given by the entry&#x27;s subschemaSubentry operational attribute. (An &quot;operational attribute&quot; describes operation of the directory rather than user information and is only returned from a search when it is explicitly requested.)

Server administrators can add additional schema entries in addition to the provided schema elements. A schema for representing individual people within organizations is termed a white pages schema.

==Variations==
A lot of the server operation is left to the implementor or administrator to decide. Accordingly, servers may be set up to support a wide variety of scenarios.

For example, data storage in the server is not specified - the server may use flat files, databases, or just be a gateway to some other server. Access control is not standardized, though there has been work on it and there are commonly used models. Users&#x27; passwords may be stored in their entries or elsewhere. The server may refuse to perform operations when it wishes, and impose various limits.

Most parts of LDAP are extensible. Examples: One can define new operations. &quot;Controls&quot; may modify requests and responses, e.g. to request sorted search results. New search scopes and Bind methods can be defined. Attributes can have &quot;options&quot; that may modify their semantics.

==Other data models==
As LDAP has gained momentum, vendors have provided it as an access protocol to other services. The implementation then recasts the data to mimic the LDAP/X.500 model, but how closely this model is followed varies. For example, there is software to access SQL databases through LDAP, even though LDAP does not readily lend itself to this. X.500 servers may support LDAP as well.

Similarly, data previously held in other types of data stores are sometimes moved to LDAP directories. For example, Unix user and group information can be stored in LDAP and accessed via PAM and NSS modules. LDAP is often used by other services for authentication and/or authorization (what actions a given already-authenticated user can do on what service). For example in Active Directory Kerberos is used in the authentication step, while LDAP is used in the authorization step.

An example of such data model is the GLUE Schema, which is used in a distributed information system based on LDAP that enable users, applications and services to discover which services exist in a Grid infrastructure and further information about their structure and state.

==Usage==
An LDAP server may return referrals to other servers for requests that it cannot fulfill itself. This requires a naming structure for LDAP entries so one can find a server holding a given distinguished name (DN), a concept defined in the X.500 Directory and also used in LDAP. Another way of locating LDAP servers for an organization is a DNS server record (SRV).

An organization with the domain example.org may use the top level LDAP DN codice_38 (where &quot;dc&quot; means domain component). If the LDAP server is also named ldap.example.org, the organization&#x27;s top level LDAP URL becomes codice_39.

Primarily two common styles of naming are used in both X.500 [2008] and LDAPv3. These are documented in the ITU specifications and IETF RFCs. The original form takes the top level object as the country object, such as codice_40, codice_41. The domain component model uses the model described above. An example of country based naming could be codice_42, or in the US: codice_43.

<text>Latino (masculine) and Latina (feminine) as a noun refer to people living in the United States and have cultural ties to Latin America. As an adjective, the terms refer to things as having ties with Latin America. The term &quot;Hispanic&quot; usually includes Spaniards whereas &quot;Latino&quot; as a noun often does not. &quot;Latino/Latina&quot; may include Brazilians, Spaniards and sometimes even some European romanophones such as Portuguese (a usage sometimes found in bilingual subgroups within the U.S., borrowing from how the word is defined in Spanish), but &quot;Hispanic&quot; does not include any of those other than Spaniards.

Usage of the term is mostly limited to the United States. Latin American countries usually refer to themselves by national origin, rarely as &quot;Latino&quot; because the whole continent does not have a cohesive national identity like in the United States. Because of this, many Latin American scholars, journalists, and Indigenous-rights organizations have objected to the mass-media use of the word to refer to all people of Latin American background.

== Origins ==

The terms &quot;Latino&quot; and &quot;Latina&quot; originated in Ancient Rome. In the English language, the term &quot;Latino&quot; is a loan word from American Spanish. (&quot;Oxford Dictionaries&quot; attributes the origin to Latin-American Spanish.) Its origin is generally given as a shortening of , Spanish for &#x27;Latin American&#x27;. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; traces its usage to 1946.

&quot;Latino&quot; has its origins in the French term , coined in the mid-19th century during the Second Mexican Empire to identify areas of the Americas colonized by Romance-speaking people and used to show affinity with French allies during the Mexican Empire, also termed the Mexican intervention.

By the late 1850s, with the loss of California to Anglo-Americans or the United States, owing to the Mexican–American War, the term &quot;latino&quot; was being used in local California newspapers such as &quot;El Clamor Publico&quot; by Californios writing about &quot;America latina&quot; and &quot;Latinoamerica&quot;, and identifying themselves as &quot;latinos&quot; as the abbreviated term for their &quot;hemispheric membership in &quot;.

== Usage ==

=== Community usage ===
Both &quot;Hispanic&quot; and &quot;Latino&quot; are generally used to denote people living in the United States. Marcelo M. Suárez-Orozco and Mariela Páez write that &quot;Outside the United States, we don&#x27;t speak of Latinos; we speak of Mexicans, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, and so forth.&quot; In Latin America, the term is not a common endonym and its usage in Spanish as a demonym is restricted to the Latin American-descended population of the United States, but this is not always the case. The exception is Spain where is a common demonym for immigrants from Latin America.
Sociologist Salvador Vidal‑Ortiz and literary scholar Juliana Martínez write that after the U.S. census introduced &quot;Hispanic&quot; in the 1970s, &quot;Latino&quot; emerged as &quot;a term of resistance to the explicit colonial relations that &#x27;Hispanic&#x27; sets between Spain and countries in Latin America&quot;.

=== Governmental usage ===
The U.S. government Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has defined &quot;Hispanic or Latino&quot; people as &quot;a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race&quot;. The U.S. census uses the ethnonym &quot;Hispanic or Latino&quot; to refer to &quot;a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race&quot;. The Census Bureau also explains that &quot;[o]rigin can be viewed as the heritage, nationality group, lineage, or country of birth of the person or the person&#x27;s ancestors before their arrival in the United States. People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race.&quot; Hence the U.S. census and the OMB are using the terms differently. The U.S. census and the OMB use the terms interchangeably, where both terms are synonyms. According to a study by the Pew Research Center, the majority (51%) of Hispanic and Latino Americans prefer to identify with their families&#x27; country of origin, while only 24% prefer the term &quot;Hispanic&quot; or &quot;Latino&quot;.

=== Style guides ===
The &quot;AP Stylebook&quot; recommends usage of &quot;Latino&quot; for persons of Spanish-speaking ancestry, as well as persons &quot;from – or whose ancestors were from – ... Latin America, including Brazilians&quot;. However, in the recent past, the term &quot;Latinos&quot; was also applied to people from the Caribbean region, but those from former French, Dutch and British colonies are excluded.

=== Contrast with &quot;Hispanic&quot; ===

Whereas &quot;Latino&quot; designates someone with roots in Latin America, the term &quot;Hispanic&quot; in contrast is a demonym that includes Spaniards and other speakers of the Spanish language.

The term &quot;Latino&quot; was officially adopted in 1997 by the United States Government in the ethnonym &quot;Hispanic or Latino&quot;, which replaced the single term &quot;Hispanic&quot;: &quot;Because regional usage of the terms differs – Hispanic is commonly used in the eastern portion of the United States, whereas Latino is commonly used in the western portion.&quot;

U.S. official use of the term &quot;Hispanic&quot; has its origins in the 1970 census. The Census Bureau attempted to identify all Hispanics by use of the following criteria in sampled sets:
:* Spanish speakers and persons belonging to a household where Spanish was spoken
:* Persons with Spanish heritage by birth location
:* Persons who self-identify with Latin America, excluding Brazil, Haiti and French Guiana

Neither &quot;Hispanic&quot; nor &quot;Latino&quot; refers to a race, as a person of Latino or Hispanic ethnicity can be of any race. Like non-Latinos, a Latino can be of any race or combination of races: White, Black or African American, Asian American, Native American or Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander American, or two or more ethnicities. While Brazilian Americans are not included with Hispanics and Latinos in the government&#x27;s census population reports, any Brazilian American can report as being Hispanic or Latino since Hispanic or Latino origin is, like race or ethnicity, a matter of self-identification.

Other federal and local government agencies and non-profit organizations include Brazilians and Portuguese in their definition of &quot;Hispanic&quot;. The U.S. Department of Transportation defines &quot;Hispanic Americans&quot; as: &quot;persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Central or South American, or other Spanish or Portuguese culture or origin, regardless of race&quot;. This definition has been adopted by the Small Business Administration as well as by many federal, state, and municipal agencies for the purposes of awarding government contracts to minority owned businesses. 
The Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Conference include representatives of Spanish and Portuguese descent. The Hispanic Society of America is dedicated to the study of the arts and cultures of Spain, Portugal, and Latin America. Each year since 1997 the International Latino Book Award is conferred to the best achievements in Spanish or Portuguese literature at BookExpo America, the largest publishing trade show in the United States. The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, which proclaims itself the champion of Hispanic success in higher education, has member institutions in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Latin America, Spain, and Portugal.

The &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot; maintains a distinction between the terms &quot;Hispanic&quot; and &quot;Latino&quot;:

Though often used interchangeably in American English, &quot;Hispanic&quot; and &quot;Latino&quot; are not identical terms, and in certain contexts the choice between them can be significant. &quot;Hispanic&quot;, from the Latin word for &quot;Spain,&quot; has the broader reference, potentially encompassing all Spanish-speaking peoples in both hemispheres and emphasizing the common denominator of language among communities that sometimes have little else in common. &quot;Latino&quot;—which in Spanish and Portuguese means &quot;Latin&quot; but which as an English word is probably a shortening of the Spanish word &quot;latinoamericano&quot;—refers more exclusively to persons or communities of Latin American origin. Of the two, only &quot;Hispanic&quot; can be used in referring to Spain and its history and culture; a native of Spain residing in the United States is a &quot;Hispanic&quot;, not a &quot;Latino&quot;, and one cannot substitute &quot;Latino&quot; in the phrase &quot;the Hispanic influence on native Mexican cultures&quot; without garbling the meaning. In practice, however, this distinction is of little significance when referring to residents of the United States, most of whom are of Latin American origin and can theoretically be called by either word.
The &quot;AP Stylebook&quot; also distinguishes between the terms &quot;Hispanic&quot; and &quot;Latino&quot;. The Stylebook limits the term &quot;Hispanic&quot; to people &quot;from – or whose ancestors were from – a Spanish-speaking land or culture&quot;. It provides a more expansive definition, however, of the term &quot;Latino&quot;. The Stylebook definition of Latino includes not only people of Spanish-speaking ancestry, but also more generally includes persons &quot;from – or whose ancestors were from – . . . Latin America&quot;. The Stylebook specifically lists &quot;Brazilian&quot; as an example of a group which can be considered Latino.

There were 28 categories tabulated in the 2000 United States census: Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Central American: Costa Rican, Guatemalan, Honduran, Nicaraguan, Panamanian, Salvadoran, Other Central American; South American: Argentinian, Bolivian, Chilean, Colombian, Ecuadorian, Paraguayan, Peruvian, Uruguayan, Venezuelan, Other South American; Other Hispanic or Latino: Spaniard, Spanish, Spanish American, All other Hispanic or Latino.

===Debates===

The use of the term &quot;Latino&quot;, despite its increasing popularity, is still highly debated among those who are called by the name. Since the adoption of the term by the U.S. Census Bureau and its subsequent widespread use, there have been several controversies and disagreements, especially in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in Mexico and other Spanish-speaking countries. Many Latin American scholars, journalists, and indigenous-rights organisations have objected to the mass-media use of the word &quot;Latino&quot;, pointing out that such ethnonyms are optional and should be used only to describe people involved in the practices, ideologies, and identity politics of their supporters. Journalist Rodolfo Acuña writes:

When and why the Latino identity came about is a more involved story. Essentially, politicians, the media, and marketers find it convenient to deal with the different U.S. Spanish-speaking people under one umbrella. However, many people with Spanish surnames contest the term &quot;Latino&quot;. They claim it is misleading because no Latino or Hispanic nationality exists since no Latino state exists, so generalizing the term &quot;Latino&quot; slights the various national identities included under the umbrella.

==Gender-neutral forms==

Attempts have been made to introduce gender-neutral language into Spanish and Portuguese by changing the ending of &quot;Latino&quot;, as in the terms &quot;Latin@&quot;, &quot;Latine&quot;, &quot;Latino/a&quot;, and &quot;Latinx&quot;. Both supporters and opponents of &quot;Latinx&quot; have cited linguistic imperialism as a reason for supporting or opposing the use of the term.

<text>Latin America refers to a cultural region of the Americas where Romance languages are predominantly spoken, primarily in the form of Spanish and Portuguese (excluding Azores islands), and to a lesser extent, Italian dialects, French (excluding Quebec) and its creoles. There is no precise or official inclusion list. Latin America is defined according to cultural identity, not geography, and as such it includes countries in both North and South America. Most countries south of the United States tend to be included: Mexico and the countries of Central America, South America and the Caribbean. Despite being in the same geographical region, English- and Dutch-speaking countries are sometimes excluded (Suriname, Guyana, the Falkland islands, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Belize, etc.). In a narrower sense, it often refers to Spanish America plus Brazil. Related terms are the narrower Hispanic America, which exclusively refers to Spanish-speaking nations, and the broader Ibero-America, which includes all Iberic countries in the Americas and occasionally European countries like Spain and Portugal. 

The term &quot;Latin America&quot; was first introduced in 1856 at a Paris conference titled, literally, &quot;Initiative of America: Idea for a Federal Congress of the Republics&quot; (&quot;Iniciativa de la América. Idea de un Congreso Federal de las Repúblicas&quot;; the original Spanish uses the singular form, &quot;América&quot;, equivalent to meaning conveyed in English by the plural form, &quot;the Americas&quot;). Chilean politician Francisco Bilbao coined the term to unify countries with shared cultural and linguistic heritage. It gained further prominence during the 1860s under the rule of Napoleon III, whose government sought to justify France&#x27;s intervention in the Second Mexican Empire. Napoleon III extended the term to include French-speaking territories in the Americas, such as French Canada, Haiti, French Louisiana, French Guiana, and the French Antillean Creole Caribbean islands (e.g., Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Lucia, and Dominica). This broader conceptualization aligned with France’s geopolitical ambitions to categorize these regions alongside the predominantly Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries of the Americas.

==Etymology and definitions==
===Origins===
Research has shown that the idea that a part of the Americas has a linguistic and cultural affinity with the Romance cultures as a whole can be traced back to the 1830s, in the writing of the French Saint-Simonian Michel Chevalier, who postulated that a part of the Americas was inhabited by people of a &quot;Latin race&quot;, and that it could, therefore, ally itself with &quot;Latin Europe&quot;, ultimately overlapping the Latin Church, in a struggle with &quot;Teutonic Europe&quot; and &quot;Anglo-Saxon America&quot; with its Anglo-Saxonism, as well as &quot;Slavic Europe&quot; with its Pan-Slavism.

Scholarship has political origins of the term. Two Latin American historians, Uruguayan Arturo Ardao and Chilean Miguel Rojas Mix, found evidence that the term &quot;Latin America&quot; was used earlier than Phelan claimed, and the first use of the term was in fact in opposition to imperialist projects in the Americas. Ardao wrote about this subject in his book &quot;Génesis de la idea y el nombre de América latina&quot; (Genesis of the Idea and the Name of Latin America, 1980), and Miguel Rojas Mix in his article &quot;Bilbao y el hallazgo de América latina: Unión continental, socialista y libertaria&quot; (Bilbao and the Finding of Latin America: a Continental, Socialist, and Libertarian Union, 1986). As Michel Gobat points out in his article &quot;The Invention of Latin America: A Transnational History of Anti-Imperialism, Democracy, and Race&quot;, &quot;Arturo Ardao, Miguel Rojas Mix, and Aims McGuinness have revealed [that] the term &#x27;Latin America&#x27; had already been used in 1856 by Central Americans and South Americans protesting US expansion into the Southern Hemisphere&quot;. Edward Shawcross summarizes Ardao&#x27;s and Rojas Mix&#x27;s findings in the following way: &quot;Ardao identified the term in a poem by a Colombian diplomat and intellectual resident in France, José María Torres Caicedo, published on 15 February 1857 in a French based Spanish-language newspaper, while Rojas Mix located it in a speech delivered in France by the radical liberal Chilean politician Francisco Bilbao in June 1856&quot;.

By the late 1850s, the term was being used in California (which had become a part of the United States), in local newspapers such as &quot;El Clamor Público&quot; by Californios writing about and , and identifying as as the abbreviated term for their &quot;hemispheric membership in &quot;.

The words &quot;Latin&quot; and &quot;America&quot; were first found to be combined in a printed work to produce the term &quot;Latin America&quot; in 1856 at a conference by the Chilean politician Francisco Bilbao in Paris. The conference had the title &quot;Initiative of the America. The idea for a Federal Congress of Republics.&quot; The following year, Colombian writer José María Torres Caicedo also used the term in his poem &quot;The Two Americas&quot;. Two events related with the United States played a central role in both works. The first event happened less than a decade before the publication of Bilbao&#x27;s and Torres Caicedo&#x27;s works: the Invasion of Mexico or, in the United States, the Mexican–American War, after which the United States annexed more than half of Mexico&#x27;s territory. The second event, the Walker affair, which happened the same year that both works were written: the decision by US president Franklin Pierce to recognize the regime recently established in Nicaragua by American William Walker and his band of filibusters who ruled Nicaragua for nearly a year (1856–57) and attempted to reinstate slavery there, where it had been already abolished for three decades

In both Bilbao&#x27;s and Torres Caicedo&#x27;s works, the Mexican–American War (1846–48) and William Walker&#x27;s expedition to Nicaragua are explicitly mentioned as examples of dangers for the region. For Bilbao, &quot;Latin America&quot; was not a geographical concept, as he excluded Brazil, Paraguay, and Mexico. Both authors also asked for the union of all Latin American countries as the only way to defend their territories against further foreign US interventions. Both also rejected European imperialism, claiming that the return of European countries to non-democratic forms of government was another danger for Latin American countries, and used the same word to describe the state of European politics at the time: &quot;despotism.&quot; Several years later, during the French invasion of Mexico, Bilbao wrote another work, &quot;Emancipation of the Spirit in the Americas&quot;, where he asked all Latin American countries to support the Mexican cause against France, and rejected French imperialism in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. He asked Latin American intellectuals to search for their &quot;intellectual emancipation&quot; by abandoning all French ideas, claiming that France was: &quot;Hypocrite, because she [France] calls herself protector of the Latin race just to subject it to her exploitation regime; treacherous, because she speaks of freedom and nationality, when, unable to conquer freedom for herself, she enslaves others instead!&quot; Therefore, as Michel Gobat puts it, the term Latin America itself had an &quot;anti-imperial genesis,&quot; and their creators were far from supporting any form of imperialism in the region, or in any other place of the globe.

=== Contemporary definitions ===
* &quot;Latin America&quot; is often used synonymously with Ibero-America (&quot;Iberian America&quot;), where the populations speak Spanish or Portuguese and the dominant religion is Roman Catholic. Puerto Rico, the Spanish-speaking Caribbean territory of the United States, acquired from the Spanish Empire following its defeat in the 1898 Spanish–American War, is usually included. This definition excludes the predominantly Protestant English-speaking and Dutch-speaking regions, as well as French-speaking predominantly Catholic regions. Belize, Guyana and Suriname, as well as several French overseas departments, are excluded from the definition. 
* In another definition, &quot;Latin America&quot; designates the set of countries in the Americas where a Romance language (a language derived from Latin) predominates: Spanish, Portuguese, or French. Thus, it includes Mexico; most of Central and South America; and in the Caribbean, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. &quot;Latin America&quot; then comprises all of the countries in the Americas that were once part of the Spanish, Portuguese, and French Empires. Puerto Rico, although not a sovereign nation, is often included.
* The term is sometimes used more broadly to refer to all of the Americas south of the United States, thus including the Guianas (French Guiana, Guyana, and Suriname); the Anglophone Caribbean (and Belize); the Francophone Caribbean; and the Dutch Caribbean. This definition emphasizes a similar socioeconomic history of the region, which was characterized by formal or informal colonialism, rather than cultural aspects (see, for example, dependency theory). Some sources avoid this simplification by using the alternative phrase &quot;Latin America and the Caribbean&quot;, as in the United Nations geoscheme for the Americas. A number of academic area-studies programs and centers of Latin American studies are titled &quot;Latin American and Caribbean&quot; studies, such as the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, University of Michigan , New York University Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS) , and University of Washington&#x27;s Latin American and Caribbean Studies, The Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies . Although the United States acquired a large swath of territory from the Spanish Empire and called Spanish borderlands and nearly 20% of the U.S. population identifies as &quot;Hispanic&quot; (or &quot;Latino&quot;), the United States is generally not classified as being part of Latin America. However, the significant demographic is sometimes brought under the umbrella of Latin American studies, such as at University of Albany.

The distinction between &quot;Latin America&quot; and &quot;Anglo-America&quot; is a convention based on the predominant languages in the Americas by which Romance language- and English-speaking cultures are distinguished. Neither area is culturally or linguistically homogeneous; in substantial portions of Latin America (e.g., highland Peru, Bolivia, Mexico, Guatemala), Indigenous Amerindian cultures and, to a lesser extent, Indigenous Amerindian languages, are predominant, and in other areas, the influence of African cultures is strong (e.g., the Caribbean basinincluding parts of Colombia and Venezuela).

The term&#x27;s meaning is contested and not without controversy. Historian Mauricio Tenorio-Trillo explores at length the &quot;allure and power&quot; of the idea of Latin America. He remarks at the outset, &quot;The idea of &#x27;Latin America&#x27; ought to have vanished with the obsolescence of racial theory... But it is not easy to declare something dead when it can hardly be said to have existed,&quot; going on to say, &quot;The term is here to stay, and it is important.&quot; Following in the tradition of Chilean writer Francisco Bilbao, who excluded Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay from his early conceptualization of Latin America, Chilean historian Jaime Eyzaguirre has criticized the term Latin America for &quot;disguising&quot; and &quot;diluting&quot; the Spanish character of a region (i.e. Hispanic America) with the inclusion of nations that, according to him, do not share the same pattern of conquest and colonization.

The Francophone part of North America which includes Quebec, Acadia, and Louisiana is generally excluded from the definition of Latin America. The primarily Papiamento-speaking ABC Islands are also often excluded, Papiamento being a Portuguese-based creole.

===Subregions and countries===
Latin America can be subdivided into several subregions based on geography, politics, democracy, demographics and culture. The basic geographical subregions are North America, Central America, the Caribbean and South America; the latter contains further politico-geographical subdivisions such as the Southern Cone, the Guianas and the Andean states. It may be subdivided on linguistic grounds into Spanish America, Portuguese America, and French America.

The term &quot;Latin America&quot; is defined to mean parts of Americas south of the mainland of the United States of America where a Romance language (a language derived from Latin) predominates. Latin America are the countries and territories in the Americas which speak Spanish or Portuguese, with French being sometimes included. As is customary, Puerto Rico is included and Dominica, Grenada, and Saint Lucia (where French is spoken but not official language) are excluded from Latin America.

*: Not a sovereign state

==History==
Before the arrival of Europeans in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, the region was home to many indigenous peoples, including advanced civilizations, most notably from South: the Olmec, Maya, Muisca, Aztecs and Inca. The region came under control of the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal, which established colonies, and imposed Roman Catholicism and their languages. Both brought African slaves to their colonies as laborers, exploiting large, settled societies and their resources. The Spanish Crown regulated immigration, allowing only Christians to travel to the New World. The colonization process led to significant native population declines due to disease, forced labor, and violence. They imposed their culture, destroying native codices and artwork. Colonial-era religion played a crucial role in everyday life, with the Spanish Crown ensuring religious purity and aggressively prosecuting perceived deviations like witchcraft.

In the early nineteenth century nearly all of areas of Spanish America attained independence by armed struggle, with the exceptions of Cuba and Puerto Rico. Brazil, which had become a monarchy separate from Portugal, became a republic in the late nineteenth century. Political independence from European monarchies did not result in the abolition of black slavery in the new nations, it resulted in political and economic instability in Spanish America, immediately after independence. Yet, as regional Caudillos started to rise in power nation nation-builders started to view themselves as more modern than their former European colonizers. Leaders began to shift away from aristocracy toward republicanism and democracy, which allowed all citizens, not just the Creole elites, to have a voice in politics. Politics helped unify many of the Latin American nations as all people, even illiterate people, would gather in their communities to talk about political ideals and how they should be used in their nation. Great Britain and the United States exercised significant influence in the post-independence era, resulting in a form of neo-colonialism, where political sovereignty remained in place, but foreign powers exercised considerable power in the economic sphere. Newly independent nations faced domestic and interstate conflicts, struggling with economic instability and social inequality.

The 20th century brought U.S. intervention and the Cold War&#x27;s impact on the region, with revolutions in countries like Cuba influencing Latin American politics. The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw shifts towards left-wing governments, followed by conservative resurgences, and a recent resurgence of left-wing politics in several countries.

===After 2000===

In many countries in the early 2000s, left-wing political parties rose to power, known as the Pink tide. The presidencies of Hugo Chávez (1999–2013) in Venezuela, Ricardo Lagos and Michelle Bachelet in Chile, Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff of the Workers Party (PT) in Brazil, Néstor Kirchner and his wife Cristina Fernández in Argentina, Tabaré Vázquez and José Mujica in Uruguay, Evo Morales in Bolivia, Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua, Rafael Correa in Ecuador, Fernando Lugo in Paraguay, Manuel Zelaya in Honduras (removed from power by a coup d&#x27;état), Mauricio Funes and Salvador Sánchez Cerén in El Salvador are all part of this wave of left-wing politicians who often declare themselves socialists, Latin Americanists, or anti-imperialists, often implying opposition to US policies towards the region. An aspect of this has been the creation of the eight-member ALBA alliance, or &quot;The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Alianza Bolivariana para los Pueblos de Nuestra América&quot;) by some of these countries.
Following the pink tide, there was a Conservative wave across Latin America. In Mexico, the rightwing National Action Party (PAN) won the presidential election of 2000 with its candidate Vicente Fox, ending the 71-year rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. He was succeed six-years later by another conservative, Felipe Calderón (2006–2012), who attempted to crack down on the Mexican drug cartels and instigated the Mexican drug war . Several right-wing leaders rose to power, including Argentina&#x27;s Mauricio Macri and Brazil&#x27;s Michel Temer, following the impeachment of the country&#x27;s first female president. In Chile, the conservative Sebastián Piñera succeeded the socialist Michelle Bachelet in 2017. In 2019, center-right Luis Lacalle Pou ended a 15-year leftist rule in Uruguay, after defeating the Broad Front candidate.

Economically, the 2000s commodities boom caused positive effects for many Latin American economies. Another trend was the rapidly increasing importance of their relations with China.
However, with the Great Recession beginning in 2008, there was an end to the commodity boom, resulting in economic stagnation or recession resulted in some countries. A number of left-wing governments of the Pink tide lost support. The worst-hit was Venezuela, which is facing severe social and economic upheaval.

Charges of against a major Brazilian conglomerate, Odebrecht, has raised allegations of corruption across the region&#x27;s governments (see Operation Car Wash). This bribery ring has become the largest corruption scandal in Latin American history. As of July 2017, the highest ranking politicians charged were former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was arrested, and former Peruvian presidents Ollanta Humala and Alejandro Toledo, who fled to the United States and was extradited back to Peru.

The COVID-19 pandemic proved a political challenge for many unstable Latin American democracies, with scholars identifying a decline in civil liberties as a result of opportunistic emergency powers. This was especially true for countries with strong presidential regimes, such as Brazil.

==Inequality==
Wealth inequality in Latin America and the Caribbean remains a serious issue despite strong economic growth and improved social indicators. A report released in 2013 by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs entitled &quot;Inequality Matters: Report of the World Social Situation&quot;, observed that: &#x27;Declines in the wage share have been attributed to the impact of labour-saving technological change and to a general weakening of labour market regulations and institutions.&#x27; Such declines are likely to disproportionately affect individuals in the middle and bottom of the income distribution, as they rely mostly on wages for income. In addition, the report noted that &#x27;highly-unequal land distribution has created social and political tensions and is a source of economic inefficiency, as small landholders frequently lack access to credit and other resources to increase productivity, while big owners may not have had enough incentive to do so.

According to the United Nations ECLAC, Latin America is the most unequal region in the world. Inequality in Latin America has deep historical roots in the Latin European racially based Casta system instituted in Latin America during colonial times that has been difficult to eradicate because of the differences between initial endowments and opportunities among social groups have constrained the poorest&#x27;s social mobility, thus causing poverty to transmit from generation to generation, and become a vicious cycle. Inequality has been reproduced and transmitted through generations because Latin American political systems allow a differentiated access on the influence that social groups have in the decision-making process, and it responds in different ways to the least favored groups that have less political representation and capacity of pressure. Recent economic liberalisation also plays a role as not everyone is equally capable of taking advantage of its benefits. Differences in opportunities and endowments tend to be based on race, ethnicity, rurality, and gender. Because inequality in gender and location are near-universal, race and ethnicity play a larger, more integral role in discriminatory practices in Latin America. The differences have a strong impact on the distribution of income, capital and political standing.

One indicator of inequality is access to and quality of education. During the first phase of globalization in Latin America, educational inequality was on the rise, peaking around the end of the 19th century. In comparison with other developing regions, Latin America then had the highest level of educational inequality, which is certainly a contributing factor for its current general high inequality. During the 20th century, however, educational inequality started decreasing.

=== Standard of living ===
Latin America has the highest levels of income inequality in the world. The following table lists all the countries in Latin America indicating a valuation of the country&#x27;s Human Development Index, GDP at purchasing power parity per capita, measurement of inequality through the Gini index, measurement of poverty through the Human Poverty Index, a measure of extreme poverty based on people living on less than 1.25 dollars a day, life expectancy, murder rates and a measurement of safety through the Global Peace Index. Green cells indicate the best performance in each category, and red the lowest.

===Largest cities===
Urbanization accelerated starting in the mid-twentieth century, especially in capital cities, or in the case of Brazil, traditional economic and political hubs founded in the colonial era. In Mexico, the rapid growth and modernization in country&#x27;s north has seen the growth of Monterrey, in Nuevo León. The following is a list of the ten largest metropolitan areas in Latin America. Entries in &quot;bold&quot; indicate they are ranked the highest.

===Race and ethnicity===
Latin American populations are very diverse, with descendants of the Indigenous peoples, Europeans, Africans initially brought as slaves, and Asians, as well as new immigrants. Mixing of groups was a fact of life at contact of the Old World and the New, but colonial regimes established legal and social discrimination against non-white populations simply on the basis of perceived ethnicity and skin color. Social class was usually linked to a person&#x27;s racial category, with European-born Spaniards and Portuguese on top. During the colonial era, with a dearth initially of European women, European men and Indigenous women and African women produced what were considered mixed-race children. In Spanish America, the so-called &quot;Sociedad de castas&quot; or &quot;Sistema de castas&quot; was constructed by white elites to try to rationalize the processes at work. In the sixteenth century the Spanish crown sought to protect Indigenous populations from exploitation by white elites for their labor and land. The crown created the&quot; &quot; to paternalistically govern and protect Indigenous peoples. It also created the &quot;República de Españoles&quot;, which included not only European whites, but all non-Indigenous peoples, such as blacks, mulattoes, and mixed-race castas who were not dwelling in Indigenous communities. In the religious sphere, the Indigenous were deemed perpetual neophytes in the Catholic faith, which meant Indigenous men were not eligible to be ordained as Catholic priests; however, Indigenous were also excluded from the jurisdiction of the Inquisition. Catholics saw military conquest and religious conquest as two parts of the assimilation of Indigenous populations, suppressing Indigenous religious practices and eliminating the Indigenous priesthood. Some worship continued underground. Jews and other non-Catholics, such as Protestants (all called &quot;Lutherans&quot;) were banned from settling and were subject to the Inquisition. Considerable mixing of populations occurred in cities, while the countryside was largely Indigenous. At independence in the early nineteenth century, in many places in Spanish America formal racial and legal distinctions disappeared, although slavery was not uniformly abolished.

Significant black populations exist in Brazil and Spanish Caribbean islands such as Cuba and Puerto Rico and the circum-Caribbean mainland (Venezuela, Colombia, Panama), as long as in the southern part of South America and Central America (Honduras, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Ecuador, and Peru) a legacy of their use in plantations. All these areas also have significant white populations. In Brazil, coastal Indigenous peoples largely died out in the early sixteenth century, with Indigenous populations surviving far from cities, sugar plantations, and other European enterprises. Many mixed-race people in much of Latin America are tri-racial, usually of European, African, and Indigenous blood, where European (mostly Spanish/Portuguese) tends to be the strongest of the three. In most of Brazil and the Spanish Caribbean, the average ancestral mix is European and African blood, with much smaller amounts of indigenous blood. While the opposite is true in many mainland Spanish-speaking Latin American countries like Venezuela, Colombia, and Panama, where the average ancestral mix is of European and indigenous blood, with smaller amounts of African. But in Mexico, and other places in northern Central America and southern South America, mixed race people tend to be completely of European and indigenous blood.

Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Brazil have dominant Mulatto/Triracial populations (&quot;Pardo&quot; in Brazil), in Brazil and Cuba, there is equally large white populations and smaller black populations, while Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico are more Mulatto/Triracial dominated, with significant black and white minorities. Parts of Central America and northern South America are more diverse in that they are dominated by Mestizos and whites but also have large numbers of Mulattos, blacks, and indigenous, especially Colombia, Venezuela, and Panama. The southern cone region, Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile are dominated by whites and mestizos. The rest of Latin America, including México, northern Central America (Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras), and central South America (Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Paraguay), are dominated by mestizos but also have large white and indigenous minorities. The French Caribbean is dominated by blacks, but is sometimes not considered part of Latin America.

In the nineteenth century, a number of Latin American countries sought immigrants from Europe and Asia. With the abolition of black slavery in 1888, the Brazilian monarchy fell in 1889. By then, another source of cheap labor to work on coffee plantations was found in Japan. Chinese male immigrants arrived in Cuba, Mexico, Peru and elsewhere. With political turmoil in Europe during the mid-nineteenth century and widespread poverty, Germans, Spaniards, and Italians immigrated to Latin America in large numbers, welcomed by Latin American governments both as a source of labor as well as a way to increase the size of their white populations. In Argentina, many Afro-Argentines married Europeans.

In twentieth-century Brazil, sociologist Gilberto Freyre proposed that Brazil was a &quot;racial democracy&quot;, with less discrimination against blacks than in the U.S. Even if a system of legal racial segregation was never implemented in Latin America, unlike the United States, subsequent research has shown that in Brazil there&#x27;s discrimination against darker citizens, and that whites remain the elites in the country. In Mexico, the mestizo population was considered the true embodiment of &quot;the cosmic race&quot;, according to Mexican intellectual José Vasconcelos, thus erasing other populations. There was considerable discrimination against Asians, with calls for the expulsion of Chinese in northern Mexico during the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920) and racially motivated massacres. In a number of Latin American countries, Indigenous groups have organized explicitly as Indigenous, to claim human rights and influence political power. With the passage of anti-colonial resolutions in the United Nations General Assembly and the signing of resolutions for Indigenous rights, the Indigenous are able to act to guarantee their existence within nation-states with legal standing.

===Language===

Spanish is the predominant language of Latin America. It is spoken as first language by about 60% of the population. Portuguese is spoken by about 30%, and about 10% speak other languages such as Quechua, Mayan languages, Guaraní, Aymara, Nahuatl, English, French, Dutch and Italian. Portuguese is spoken mostly in Brazil, the largest and most populous country in the region. Spanish is the official language of most of the other countries and territories on the Latin American mainland, as well as in Cuba, Puerto Rico (where it is co-official with English), and the Dominican Republic. French is spoken in Haiti and in the French overseas departments of Guadeloupe, Martinique, and Guiana. It is also spoken by some Panamanians of Afro-Antillean descent. Dutch is the official language in Suriname, Aruba, Curaçao and Bonaire. (As Dutch is a Germanic language, the territories are not necessarily considered part of Latin America.) However, the native and co-official language of Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, is Papiamento, a creole language largely based on Portuguese and Spanish that has had a considerable influence from Dutch and other Portuguese-based creole languages.

Amerindian languages are widely spoken in Peru, Guatemala, Bolivia, Paraguay and Mexico, and to a lesser degree, in Panama, Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina, and Chile. In other Latin American countries, the population of speakers of Indigenous languages tend to be very small or even non-existent, for example in Uruguay. Mexico is possibly contains more Indigenous languages than any other Latin American country, but the most-spoken Indigenous language there is Nahuatl.

In Peru, Quechua is an official language, alongside Spanish and other Indigenous languages in the areas where they predominate. In Ecuador, while Quichua holds no official status, it is a recognized language under the country&#x27;s constitution; however, it is only spoken by a few groups in the country&#x27;s highlands. In Bolivia, Aymara, Quechua and Guaraní hold official status alongside Spanish. Guaraní, like Spanish, is an official language of Paraguay, and is spoken by a majority of the population, which is, for the most part, bilingual, and it is co-official with Spanish in the Argentine province of Corrientes. In Nicaragua, Spanish is the official language, but on the country&#x27;s Caribbean coast English and Indigenous languages such as Miskito, Sumo, and Rama also hold official status. Colombia recognizes all Indigenous languages spoken within its territory as official, though fewer than 1% of its population are native speakers of these languages. Nahuatl is one of the 62 Native languages spoken by Indigenous people in Mexico, which are officially recognized by the government as &quot;national languages&quot; along with Spanish.

Other European languages spoken in Latin America include: English, by half of the current population in Puerto Rico, as well as in nearby countries that may or may not be considered Latin American, like Belize and Guyana, and spoken by descendants of British settlers in Argentina and Chile. German is spoken in southern Brazil, southern Chile, portions of Argentina, Venezuela and Paraguay; Italian in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, and Uruguay; Ukrainian, Polish, and Russian in southern Brazil and Argentina; and Welsh, in southern Argentina. Non-European or Asian languages include Japanese in Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay, Korean in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Chile, Arabic in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, and Chile, and Chinese throughout South America. Countries like Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil have their own dialects or variations of German and Italian.

In several nations, especially in the Caribbean region, creole languages are spoken. The most widely-spoken creole language in Latin America and the Caribbean is Haitian Creole, the predominant language of Haiti, derived primarily from French and certain West African tongues, with Amerindian, English, Portuguese and Spanish influences as well. Creole languages of mainland Latin America, similarly, are derived from European languages and various African tongues. The aforementioned Papiamento, commonly spoken on the Dutch Caribbean ABC Islands, is a Portuguese-based creole.

The Garifuna language is spoken along the Caribbean coast in Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Belize, mostly by the Garifuna people, a mixed-race Zambo people who were the result of mixing between Indigenous Caribbeans and escaped Black slaves. Primarily an Arawakan language, it has influences from Caribbean and European languages.

Archaeologists have deciphered over 15 pre-Columbian distinct writing systems from Mesoamerican societies. Ancient Maya had the most sophisticated textually written language, but since texts were largely confined to the religious and administrative elite, traditions were passed down orally. Oral traditions also prevailed in other major Indigenous groups including, but not limited to the Aztecs and other Nahuatl speakers, Quechua and Aymara of the Andean regions, the Quiché of Central America, the Tupi-Guaraní in today&#x27;s Brazil, the Guaraní in Paraguay and the Mapuche in Chile.

===Religion===


The vast majority of Latin Americans are Christians (90%), mostly Roman Catholics belonging to the Latin Church. About 70% of the Latin American population considers itself Catholic. In 2012 Latin America constitutes in absolute terms the second world&#x27;s largest Christian population, after Europe.

According to the detailed Pew multi-country survey in 2014, 69% of the Latin American population is Catholic and 19% is Protestant. Protestants are 26% in Brazil and over 40% in much of Central America. More than half of these are converts from Roman Catholicism.

===Migration===

The entire hemisphere was settled by migrants from Asia, Europe, and Africa. Indigenous Amerindian populations settled throughout the hemisphere before the arrival of Europeans in the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and the forced migration of slaves from Africa.

In the post-independence period, a number of Latin American countries sought to attract European immigrants as a source of labor as well as to deliberately change the proportions of racial and ethnic groups within their borders. Chile, Argentina, and Brazil actively recruited labor from Catholic southern Europe, where populations were poor and sought better economic opportunities. Many nineteenth-century immigrants went to the United States and Canada, but a significant number arrived in Latin America. Although Mexico tried to attract immigrants, it largely failed. As black slavery was abolished in Brazil in 1888, coffee growers recruited Japanese migrants to work in coffee plantations. There is a significant population of Japanese descent in Brazil. Cuba and Peru recruited Chinese labor in the late nineteenth century. Some Chinese immigrants who were excluded from immigrating to the U.S. settled in northern Mexico. When the U.S. acquired its southwest by conquest in the Mexican American War, Latin American populations did not cross the border to the U.S., the border crossed them.

In the twentieth century there have been several types of migration. One is the movement of rural populations within a given country to cities in search of work, causing many Latin American cities to grow significantly. Another is international movement of populations, often fleeing repression or war. Other international migration is for economic reasons, often unregulated or undocumented. Mexicans immigrated to the U.S. during the violence of the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920) and the religious Cristero War (1926–29); during World War II, Mexican men worked in the U.S. in the bracero program. Economic migration from Mexico followed the crash of the Mexican economy in the 1980s.
Spanish refugees fled to Mexico following the fascist victory in the Spanish Civil War (1936–38), with some 50,000 exiles finding refuge at the invitation of President Lázaro Cárdenas. Following World War II a larger wave of refugees to Latin America, many of them Jews, settled in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, and Venezuela. Some were only transiting through the region, but others stayed and created communities. A number of Nazis escaped to Latin America, living under assumed names, in an attempt to avoid attention and prosecution.

In the aftermath of the Cuban Revolution, middle class and elite Cubans moved to the U.S., particularly to Florida. Some fled Chile for the U.S. and Europe after the 1973 military coup. Colombians migrated to Spain and the United Kingdom during the region&#x27;s political turmoil, compounded by the rise of narcotrafficking and guerrilla warfare. During the Central American wars of the 1970s to the 1990s, many Salvadorans, Guatemalans, and Hondurans migrated to the U.S. to escape narcotrafficking, gangs, and poverty. As living conditions deteriorated in Venezuela under Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro, many left for neighboring Colombia and Ecuador. In the 1990s, economic stress in Ecuador during the La Década Perdida triggered considerable migration to Spain and to the U.S.

Some Latin American countries seek to strengthen links between migrants and their states of origin, while promoting their integration in the receiving state. These emigrant policies focus on the rights, obligations and opportunities for participation of emigrated citizens who already live outside the borders of the country of origin. Research on Latin America shows that the extension of policies towards migrants is linked to a focus on civil rights and state benefits that can positively influence integration in recipient countries. In addition, the tolerance of dual citizenship has spread more in Latin America than in any other region of the world.

===Education===

Despite significant progress, education access and school completion remains unequal in Latin America. The region has made great progress in educational coverage; almost all children attend primary school, and access to secondary education has increased considerably. Quality issues such as poor teaching methods, lack of appropriate equipment, and overcrowding exist throughout the region. These issues lead to adolescents dropping out of the educational system early. Most educational systems in the region have implemented various types of administrative and institutional reforms that have enabled reach for places and communities that had no access to education services in the early 1990s. School meal programs are also employed to expand access to education, and at least 23 countries in the Latin America and Caribbean region have large-scale school feeding activities, altogether reaching 88% of primary school-age children in the region. Compared to prior generations, Latin American youth have seen an increase in their levels of education. On average, they have completed two more years of school than their parents.

However, there are still 23 million children in the region between the ages of 4 and 17 outside of the formal education system. Estimates indicate that 30% of preschool age children (ages 4–5) do not attend school, and for the most vulnerable populations, the poor and rural, this proportion exceeds 40 percent. Among primary school age children (ages 6 to 12), attendance is almost universal; however there is still a need to enroll five million more children in the primary education system. These children mostly live in remote areas, are Indigenous or Afro-descendants and live in extreme poverty.

Among people between the ages of 13 and 17 years, only 80% are full-time students, and only 66% of these advance to secondary school. These percentages are lower among vulnerable population groups: only 75% of the poorest youth between the ages of 13 and 17 years attend school. Tertiary education has the lowest coverage, with only 70% of people between the ages of 18 and 25 years outside of the education system. Currently, more than half of low income or rural children fail to complete nine years of education.

===Crime and violence===
Latin America and the Caribbean have been cited by numerous sources to be the most dangerous regions in the world. Studies have shown that Latin America contains the majority of the world&#x27;s most dangerous cities.

Crime and violence prevention and public security are now important issues for governments and citizens in Latin America and the Caribbean region. Homicide rates in Latin America are the highest in the world. From the early 1980s through the mid-1990s, homicide rates increased by 50 percent. Latin America and the Caribbean experienced more than 2.5 million murders between 2000 and 2017. There were a total of 63,880 murders in Brazil in 2018.

The most frequent victims of such homicides are young men, 69 percent of them between the ages of 15 and 19. Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean with the highest homicide rate per year per 100,000 inhabitants in 2015 were: El Salvador 109, Honduras 64, Venezuela 57, Jamaica 43, Belize 34.4, St. Kitts and Nevis 34, Guatemala 34, Trinidad and Tobago 31, the Bahamas 30, Brazil 26.7, Colombia 26.5, the Dominican Republic 22, St. Lucia 22, Guyana 19, Mexico 16, Puerto Rico 16, Ecuador 13, Grenada 13, Costa Rica 12, Bolivia 12, Nicaragua 12, Panama 11, Antigua and Barbuda 11, and Haiti 10. Most of the countries with the highest homicide rates are in Africa and Latin America. Countries in Central America, like El Salvador and Honduras, top the list of homicides in the world.

Brazil has more overall homicides than any country in the world, at 50,108, accounting for one in 10 globally. Crime-related violence is the biggest threat to public health in Latin America, striking more victims than HIV/AIDS or any other infectious disease. Countries with the lowest homicide rate per year per 100,000 inhabitants as of 2015 were: Chile 3, Peru 7, Argentina 7, Uruguay 8 and Paraguay 9.

Brazil is the world&#x27;s largest exporter of chicken meat: 3.77 million tons in 2019. The country had the second largest herd of cattle in the world, 22.2% of the world herd. The country was the second largest producer of beef in 2019, responsible for 15.4% of global production. It was also the third largest world producer of milk in 2018. This year, the country produced 35.1 billion liters. In 2019, Brazil was the fourth largest pork producer in the world, with almost four million tons.

In 2018, Argentina was the fourth largest producer of beef in the world, with a production of 3 million tons (behind only United States, Brazil and China). Uruguay is also a major meat producer. In 2018, it produced 589 thousand tons of beef.

In the production of chicken meat, Mexico is among the ten largest producers in the world, Argentina among the 15 largest and Peru and Colombia among the 20 largest. In beef production, Mexico is one of the ten largest producers in the world and Colombia is one of the 20 largest producers. In the production of pork, Mexico is among the 15 largest producers in the world. In the production of honey, Argentina is among the five largest producers in the world, Mexico among the ten largest and Brazil among the 15 largest. In terms of cow&#x27;s milk production, Mexico is among the 15 largest producers in the world and Argentina among the 20 largest.

===Mining and petroleum===
Mining is one of the most important economic sectors in Latin America, especially for Chile, Peru and Bolivia, whose economies are highly dependent on this sector. The continent has large productions of:
*gold (mainly in Peru, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina); 
*silver (mainly in Mexico, Peru, Chile, Bolivia and Argentina); 
*copper (mainly in Chile, Peru, Mexico and Brazil); 
*iron ore (Brazil, Peru and Chile); 
*zinc (Peru, Mexico, Bolivia and Brazil); 
*molybdenum (Chile, Peru and Mexico); 
*lithium (Chile, Argentina and Brazil); 
*lead (Peru, Mexico and Bolivia); 
*bauxite (Brazil and Jamaica); 
*tin (Peru, Bolivia and Brazil); 
*manganese (Brazil and Mexico); 
*antimony (Bolivia, Mexico, Guatemala and Ecuador); 
*nickel (Brazil, Dominican Republic and Cuba); 
*niobium (Brazil); 
*rhenium (Chile); 
*iodine (Chile),

Brazil stands out in the extraction of 
*iron ore (where it is the 2nd largest producer and exporter in the world—iron ore is usually one of the three export products that generate the greatest value in the country&#x27;s trade balance)
*copper
*gold
*bauxite (one of the five largest producers in the world)
*manganese (one of the five largest producers in the world)
*tin (one of the largest producers in the world)
*niobium (98% of known world reserves) and 
*nickel

In terms of gemstones, Brazil is the world&#x27;s largest producer of amethysts, topaz, and agates and one of the main producers of tourmaline, emeralds, aquamarines, garnets and opals.

Chile contributes about a third of the world&#x27;s copper production. In addition, Chile was, in 2019, the world&#x27;s largest producer of iodine and rhenium, the second largest producer of lithium and molybdenum, the sixth largest producer of silver, the seventh largest producer of salt, the eighth largest producer of potash, the thirteenth-largest producer of sulfur and the thirteenth largest producer of iron ore in the world.

In 2019, Peru was the second largest world producer of copper and silver, 8th largest world producer of gold, third largest world producer of lead, second largest world producer of zinc, fourth largest world producer of tin, fifth largest world producer of boron, and fourth largest world producer of molybdenum.

In 2019, Bolivia was the eighth largest world producer of silver; fourth largest world producer of boron; fifth largest world producer of antimony; fifth largest world producer of tin; sixth largest world producer of tungsten; seventh largest producer of zinc, and the eighth largest producer of lead.

In 2019, Mexico was the world&#x27;s largest producer of silver (representing almost 23% of world production, producing more than 200 million ounces in 2019); ninth largest producer of gold, the eighth largest producer of copper, the world&#x27;s fifth largest producer of lead, the world&#x27;s sixth largest producer of zinc, the world&#x27;s fifth largest producer of molybdenum, the world&#x27;s third largest producer of mercury, the world&#x27;s fifth largest producer of bismuth, the world&#x27;s 13th largest producer of manganese and the 23rd largest world producer of phosphate. It is also the eighth largest world producer of salt.

In 2019, Argentina was the fourth largest world producer of lithium, the ninth largest world producer of silver, the 17th largest world producer of gold and the seventh largest world producer of boron.

Colombia is the world&#x27;s largest producer of emeralds. In the production of gold, between 2006 and 2017, the country produced 15 tons per year until 2007, when its production increased significantly, breaking a record of 66.1 tons extracted in 2012. In 2017, it extracted 52.2 tons. The country is among the 25 largest gold producers in the world. In the production of silver, in 2017 the country extracted 15,5 tons.

In the production of oil, Brazil was the tenth largest oil producer in the world in 2019, with 2.8 million barrels a day. Mexico was the twelfth largest, with 2.1 million barrels a day, Colombia in 20th place with 886 thousand barrels a day, Venezuela was the twenty-first place, with 877 thousand barrels a day, Ecuador in 28th with 531 thousand barrels a day and Argentina. 29th with 507 thousand barrels a day. Since Venezuela and Ecuador consume little oil and export most of their production, they are part of OPEC. Venezuela had a big drop in production after 2015 (when it produced 2.5 million barrels a day), falling in 2016 to 2.2 million, in 2017 to 2 million, in 2018 to 1.4 million and in 2019 to 877 thousand, due to lack of investment.

In the production of natural gas, in 2018, Argentina produced 1,524 bcf (billions of cubic feet), Mexico produced 999, Venezuela 946, Brazil 877, Bolivia 617, Peru 451, Colombia 379.

In the production of coal, the continent had three of the 30 largest world producers in 2018: Colombia (12th), Mexico (24th) and Brazil (27th).

===Manufacturing===

The World Bank annually lists the top manufacturing countries by total manufacturing value. According to the 2019 list:
*Mexico had the twelfth most valuable industry in the world (US$217.8 billion)
*Brazil the thirteenth largest (US$173.6 billion)
*Venezuela the thirtieth largest (US$58.2 billion, however, it depends on oil to reach this value)
*Argentina the 31st largest (US$57.7 billion)
*Colombia the 46th largest (US$35.4 billion)
*Peru the 50th largest (US$28.7 billion) 
*Chile the 51st largest (US$28.3 billion).

In Latin America, few countries stand out in industrial activity: Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and, less prominently, Chile. Begun late, the industrialization of these countries received a great boost from World War II: this prevented the countries at war from buying the products they were used to importing and exporting what they produced. At that time, benefiting from the abundant local raw material, the low wages paid to the labor force and a certain specialization brought by immigrants, countries such as Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, as well as Venezuela, Chile, Colombia and Peru, were able to implement important industrial parks. In general, in these countries there are industries that require little capital and simple technology for their installation, such as the food processing and textile industries. The basic industries (steel, etc.) also stand out, as well as the metallurgical and mechanical industries.

The industrial parks of Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Chile, however, present much greater diversity and sophistication, producing advanced technology items. In the rest of Latin American countries, mainly in Central America, the processing industries of primary products for export predominate.

In the food industry, in 2019, Brazil was the second largest exporter of processed foods in the world. In 2016, the country was the second largest producer of pulp in the world and the eighth largest producer of paper. In the footwear industry, in 2019, Brazil ranked fourth among world producers. In 2019, the country was the eighth largest producer of vehicles and the ninth largest producer of steel in the world. In 2018, the chemical industry of Brazil was the eighth largest in the world. In the textile industry, Brazil, although it was among the five largest world producers in 2013, is very little integrated into world trade. In the aviation sector, Brazil has Embraer, the third largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, behind Boeing and Airbus.

===Infrastructure===

Transport in Latin America is basically carried out using the road mode, the most developed in the region. There is also a considerable infrastructure of ports and airports. The railway and fluvial sector, although it has potential, is usually treated in a secondary way.

Brazil has more than 1.7 million km of roads, of which 215,000 km are paved, and about 14,000 km are divided highways. The two most important highways in the country are BR-101 and BR-116. Argentina has more than 600,000 km of roads, of which about 70,000 km are paved, and about 2,500 km are divided highways. The three most important highways in the country are Route 9, Route 7 and Route 14. Colombia has about 210,000 km of roads, and about 2,300 km are divided highways. Chile has about 82,000 km of roads, 20,000 km of which are paved, and about 2,000 km are divided highways. The most important highway in the country is the Route 5 (Pan-American Highway) These 4 countries are the ones with the best road infrastructure and with the largest number of double-lane highways, in South America.

The roadway network in Mexico has an extent of , of which are paved, Of these, are multi-lane expressways: are four-lane highways and the rest have 6 or more lanes.

Due to the Andes Mountains, Amazon River and Amazon Forest, there have always been difficulties in implementing transcontinental or bioceanic highways. Practically the only route that existed was the one that connected Brazil to Buenos Aires, in Argentina and later to Santiago, in Chile. However, in recent years, with the combined effort of countries, new routes have started to emerge, such as Brazil-Peru (Interoceanic Highway), and a new highway between Brazil, Paraguay, northern Argentina and northern Chile (Bioceanic Corridor).

There are more than 2,000 airports in Brazil. The country has the second largest number of airports in the world, behind only the United States. São Paulo International Airport, located in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo, is the largest and busiest in the country – the airport connects São Paulo to practically all major cities around the world. Brazil has 44 international airports, such as those in Rio de Janeiro, Brasília, Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre, Florianópolis, Cuiabá, Salvador, Recife, Fortaleza, Belém and Manaus, among others. Argentina has important international airports such as Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Bariloche, Mendoza, Salta, Puerto Iguazú, Neuquén and Ushuaia, among others. Chile has important international airports such as Santiago, Antofagasta, Puerto Montt, Punta Arenas and Iquique, among others. Colombia has important international airports such as Bogotá, Medellín, Cartagena, Cali and Barranquilla, among others. Peru has important international airports such as Lima, Cuzco and Arequipa. Other important airports are those in the capitals of Uruguay (Montevideo), Paraguay (Asunción), Bolivia (La Paz) and Ecuador (Quito). The 10 busiest airports in South America in 2017 were: São Paulo-Guarulhos (Brazil), Bogotá (Colombia), São Paulo-Congonhas (Brazil), Santiago (Chile), Lima (Peru), Brasília (Brazil), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Buenos Aires-Aeroparque (Argentina), Buenos Aires-Ezeiza (Argentina), and Minas Gerais (Brazil).

There are 1,834 airports in Mexico, the third-largest number of airports by country in the world. The seven largest airports—which absorb 90% of air travel—are (in order of air traffic): Mexico City, Cancún, Guadalajara, Monterrey, Tijuana, Acapulco, and Puerto Vallarta. Considering all of Latin America, the 10 busiest airports in 2017 were: Mexico City (Mexico), São Paulo-Guarulhos (Brazil), Bogotá (Colombia), Cancún (Mexico), São Paulo-Congonhas (Brazil), Santiago ( Chile), Lima (Peru), Brasilia (Brazil), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and Tocumen (Panama).

About ports, Brazil has some of the busiest ports in South America, such as Port of Santos, Port of Rio de Janeiro, Port of Paranaguá, Port of Itajaí, Port of Rio Grande, Port of São Francisco do Sul and Suape Port. Argentina has ports such as Port of Buenos Aires and Port of Rosario. Chile has important ports in Valparaíso, Caldera, Mejillones, Antofagasta, Iquique, Arica and Puerto Montt. Colombia has important ports such as Buenaventura, Cartagena Container Terminal and Puerto Bolivar. Peru has important ports in Callao, Ilo and Matarani. The 15 busiest ports in South America are: Port of Santos (Brazil), Port of Bahia de Cartagena (Colombia), Callao (Peru), Guayaquil (Ecuador), Buenos Aires (Argentina), San Antonio (Chile), Buenaventura (Colombia), Itajaí (Brazil), Valparaíso (Chile), Montevideo (Uruguay), Paranaguá (Brazil), Rio Grande (Brazil), São Francisco do Sul (Brazil), Manaus (Brazil) and Coronel (Chile).

The four major seaports concentrating around 60% of the merchandise traffic in Mexico are Altamira and Veracruz in the Gulf of Mexico, and Manzanillo and Lázaro Cárdenas in the Pacific Ocean. Considering all of Latin America, the 10 largest ports in terms of movement are: Colon (Panama), Santos (Brazil), Manzanillo (Mexico), Bahia de Cartagena (Colombia), Pacifico (Panama), Callao (Peru), Guayaquil (Ecuador), Buenos Aires (Argentina), San Antonio (Chile) and Buenaventura (Colombia).

The Brazilian railway network has an extension of about 30,000 kilometers. It is basically used for transporting ores. The Argentine rail network, with 47,000 km of tracks, was one of the largest in the world and continues to be the most extensive in Latin America. It came to have about 100,000 km of rails, but the lifting of tracks and the emphasis placed on motor transport gradually reduced it. It has four different trails and international connections with Paraguay, Bolivia, Chile, Brazil and Uruguay. Chile has almost 7,000 km of railways, with connections to Argentina, Bolivia and Peru. Colombia has only about 3,500 km of railways.

Among the main Brazilian waterways, two stand out: Hidrovia Tietê-Paraná (which has a length of 2,400 km, 1,600 on the Paraná River and 800 km on the Tietê River, draining agricultural production from the states of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Goiás and part of Rondônia, Tocantins and Minas General) and Hidrovia do Solimões-Amazonas (it has two sections: Solimões, which extends from Tabatinga to Manaus, with approximately 1600 km, and Amazonas, which extends from Manaus to Belém, with 1650 km. Almost entirely passenger transport from the Amazon plain is done by this waterway, in addition to practically all cargo transportation that is directed to the major regional centers of Belém and Manaus). In Brazil, this transport is still underutilized: the most important waterway stretches, from an economic point of view, are found in the Southeast and South of the country. Its full use still depends on the construction of locks, major dredging works and, mainly, of ports that allow intermodal integration. In Argentina, the waterway network is made up of the La Plata, Paraná, Paraguay and Uruguay rivers. The main river ports are Zárate and Campana. The port of Buenos Aires is historically the first in individual importance, but the area known as Up-River, which stretches along 67 km of the Santa Fé portion of the Paraná River, brings together 17 ports that concentrate 50% of the total exports of the country.

=== Energy ===
====Brazil====

The Brazilian government has undertaken an ambitious program to reduce dependence on imported petroleum. Imports previously accounted for more than 70% of the country&#x27;s oil needs but Brazil became self-sufficient in oil in 2006–2007. Brazil was the 10th largest oil producer in the world in 2019, with 2.8 million barrels / day. Production manages to supply the country&#x27;s demand. In the beginning of 2020, in the production of oil and natural gas, the country exceeded 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, for the first time. In January this year, 3.168 million barrels of oil per day and 138.753 million cubic meters of natural gas were extracted.

Brazil is one of the main world producers of hydroelectric power. In 2019, Brazil had 217 hydroelectric plants in operation, with an installed capacity of 98,581 MW, 60.16% of the country&#x27;s energy generation. In the total generation of electricity, in 2019 Brazil reached 170,000 megawatts of installed capacity, more than 75% from renewable sources (the majority, hydroelectric).

In 2013, the Southeast Region used about 50% of the load of the National Integrated System (SIN), being the main energy consuming region in the country. The region&#x27;s installed electricity generation capacity totaled almost 42,500 MW, which represented about a third of Brazil&#x27;s generation capacity. The hydroelectric generation represented 58% of the region&#x27;s installed capacity, with the remaining 42% corresponding basically to the thermoelectric generation. São Paulo accounted for 40% of this capacity; Minas Gerais by about 25%; Rio de Janeiro by 13.3%; and Espírito Santo accounted for the rest. The South Region owns the Itaipu Dam, which was the largest hydroelectric plant in the world for several years, until the inauguration of Three Gorges Dam in China. It remains the second largest operating hydroelectric in the world. Brazil is the co-owner of the Itaipu Plant with Paraguay: the dam is located on the Paraná River, located on the border between countries. It has an installed generation capacity of 14 GW for 20 generating units of 700 MW each. North Region has large hydroelectric plants, such as Belo Monte Dam and Tucuruí Dam, which produce much of the national energy. Brazil&#x27;s hydroelectric potential has not yet been fully exploited, so the country still has the capacity to build several renewable energy plants in its territory.

 according to ONS, total installed capacity of wind power was 22 GW, with average capacity factor of 58%. While the world average wind production capacity factors is 24.7%, there are areas in Northern Brazil, specially in Bahia State, where some wind farms record with average capacity factors over 60%; the average capacity factor in the Northeast Region is 45% in the coast and 49% in the interior. In 2019, wind energy represented 9% of the energy generated in the country. In 2019, it was estimated that the country had an estimated wind power generation potential of around 522 GW (this, only onshore), enough energy to meet three times the country&#x27;s current demand. In 2021 Brazil was the 7th country in the world in terms of installed wind power (21 GW), and the 4th largest producer of wind energy in the world (72 TWh), behind only China, USA and Germany.

Nuclear energy accounts for about 4% of Brazil&#x27;s electricity. The nuclear power generation monopoly is owned by Eletronuclear (Eletrobrás Eletronuclear S/A), a wholly owned subsidiary of Eletrobrás. Nuclear energy is produced by two reactors at Angra. It is located at the Central Nuclear Almirante Álvaro Alberto (CNAAA) on the Praia de Itaorna in Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro. It consists of two pressurized water reactors, Angra I, with capacity of 657 MW, connected to the power grid in 1982, and Angra II, with capacity of 1,350 MW, connected in 2000. A third reactor, Angra III, with a projected output of 1,350 MW, is planned to be finished.

 according to ONS, total installed capacity of photovoltaic solar was 21 GW, with average capacity factor of 23%. Some of the most irradiated Brazilian States are MG (&quot;Minas Gerais&quot;), BA (&quot;Bahia&quot;) and GO (&quot;Goiás&quot;), which have indeed world irradiation level records. In 2019, solar power represented 1.27% of the energy generated in the country. In 2021, Brazil was the 14th country in the world in terms of installed solar power (13 GW), and the 11th largest producer of solar energy in the world (16.8 TWh).

In 2020, Brazil was the 2nd largest country in the world in the production of energy through biomass (energy production from solid biofuels and renewable waste), with 15,2 GW installed.

====Other countries====
After Brazil, Mexico is the country in Latin America that most stands out in energy production. In 2020, the country was the 14th largest petroleum producer in the world, and in 2018 it was the 12th largest exporter. In natural gas, the country was, in 2015, the 21st largest producer in the world, and in 2007 it was the 29th largest exporter. Mexico was also the world&#x27;s 24th largest producer of coal in 2018. In renewable energies, in 2020, the country ranked 14th in the world in terms of installed wind energy (8.1 GW), 20th in the world in terms of installed solar energy (5.6 GW) and 19th in the world in terms of installed hydroelectric power (12.6 GW). In third place, Colombia stands out: In 2020, the country was the 20th largest petroleum producer in the world, and in 2015 it was the 19th largest exporter. In natural gas, the country was, in 2015, the 40th largest producer in the world. Colombia&#x27;s biggest highlight is in coal, where the country was, in 2018, the world&#x27;s 12th largest producer and the 5th largest exporter. In renewable energies, in 2020, the country ranked 45th in the world in terms of installed wind energy (0.5 GW), 76th in the world in terms of installed solar energy (0.1 GW) and 20th in the world in terms of installed hydroelectric power (12.6 GW).

Venezuela, which was one of the world&#x27;s largest oil producers (about 2.5 million barrels/day in 2015) and one of the largest exporters, due to its political problems, has had its production drastically reduced in recent years: in 2016, it dropped to 2.2 million, in 2017 to 2 million, in 2018 to 1.4 million and in 2019 to 877 thousand, reaching only 300,000 barrels/day at a given point. The country also stands out in hydroelectricity, where it was the 14th country in the world in terms of installed capacity in 2020 (16,5 GW).

Argentina was, in 2017, the 18th largest producer in the world, and the largest producer in Latin America, of natural gas, in addition to being the 28th largest oil producer; although the country has the Vaca Muerta field, which holds close to 16 billion barrels of technically recoverable shale oil, and is the second largest shale natural gas deposit in the world, the country lacks the capacity to exploit the deposit: it is necessary capital, technology and knowledge that can only come from offshore energy companies, who view Argentina and its erratic economic policies with considerable suspicion, not wanting to invest in the country. In renewable energies, in 2020, the country ranked 27th in the world in terms of installed wind energy (2.6 GW), 42nd in the world in terms of installed solar energy (0.7 GW) and 21st in the world in terms of installed hydroelectric power (11.3 GW). The country has great future potential for the production of wind energy in the Patagonia region. Chile, although currently not a major energy producer, has great future potential for solar energy production in the Atacama Desert region.

Paraguay stands out today in hydroelectric production thanks to the Itaipu Power Plant. Trinidad and Tobago and Bolivia stand out in the production of natural gas, where they were, respectively, the 20th and 31st largest in the world in 2015. Ecuador, because it consumes little energy, is part of OPEC and was the 27th largest oil producer in the world in 2020, being the 22nd largest exporter in 2014.

==Trade blocs==

The major trade blocs (or agreements) in the region are the Pacific Alliance and Mercosur. Minor blocs or trade agreements are the G3 Free Trade Agreement, the Dominican Republic – Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA), the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Andean Community of Nations (CAN). However, major reconfigurations are taking place along opposing approaches to integration and trade; Venezuela has officially withdrawn from both the CAN and G3 and it has been formally admitted into the Mercosur (pending ratification from the Paraguayan legislature). The president-elect of Ecuador has manifested his intentions of following the same path. This bloc nominally opposes any Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States, although Uruguay has manifested its intention otherwise. Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico are the only four Latin American nations that have an FTA with the United States and Canada, both members of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

=== China ===
China&#x27;s economic influence in Latin America increased substantially in the 21st century. Imports from China valued $8.3 billion in 2000, but by 2022 its value was $450 billion and had grown to be the largest trading partner of South America, as well as the second-largest for the broader Latin America. In particular, many of the investments are related to the Belt and Road Initiative or energy. China has also provided loans to several Latin American countries; this has raised concerns about the possibility of &quot;debt traps.&quot; Specifically, Venezuela, Brazil, Ecuador, and Argentina received the most loans from China during 2005–2016.

==Tourism==
Income from tourism is key to the economy of several Latin American countries. Mexico is the only Latin American country to be ranked in the top 10 worldwide in the number of tourist visits. It received by far the largest number of international tourists, with 39.3 million visitors in 2017, followed by Argentina, with 6.7 million; then Brazil, with 6.6 million; Chile, with 6.5 million; Dominican Republic, with 6.2 million; Cuba with 4.3 million; Peru and Colombia with 4.0 million. The World Tourism Organization reports the following destinations as the top six tourism earners for the year 2017: Mexico, with US$21,333 million; the Dominican Republic, with US$7,178 million; Brazil, with US$6,024 million; Colombia, with US$4,773 million; Argentina, with US$4,687 million; and Panama, with US$4,258 million.

Places such as Cancún, Riviera Maya, Chichen Itza, Cabo San Lucas, Mexico City, Acapulco, Puerto Vallarta, Guanajuato City, San Miguel de Allende, Guadalajara in Mexico, Punta Cana, Santo Domingo in Dominican Republic, Punta del Este in Uruguay, San Juan, Ponce in Puerto Rico, Panama City in Panama, Poás Volcano National Park in Costa Rica, Viña del Mar in Chile, Rio de Janeiro, Florianópolis, Iguazu Falls, São Paulo, Armação dos Búzios, Salvador, Bombinhas, Angra dos Reis, Balneário Camboriú, Paraty, Ipojuca, Natal, Cairu, Fortaleza and Itapema in Brazil; Buenos Aires, Bariloche, Salta, Jujuy, Perito Moreno Glacier, Valdes Peninsula, Guarani Jesuit Missions in the cities of Misiones and Corrientes, Ischigualasto Provincial Park, Ushuaia and Patagonia in Argentina;

==Culture==


Latin American culture is a mixture of many influences:

* Indigenous cultures of the people who inhabited the continent prior to European colonization. Ancient and advanced civilizations developed their own political, social and religious systems. The Maya, the Aztec and the Inca are examples of these. Indigenous legacies in music, dance, foods, arts and crafts, clothing, folk culture and traditions are strong in Latin America. Indigenous languages affected Spanish and Portuguese, giving rise to loanwords like pampa, taco, tamale, cacique.
* The culture of Europe was brought mainly by the colonial powersthe Spanish, Portuguese and Frenchbetween the 16th and 19th centuries. The most enduring European colonial influences are language, institutions, customs and Catholicism.
* Additional cultural influences came from the Europe during the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, due to growing immigration from Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Portugal; as well as artistic, ideological and technological developments of the time. Due to the impact of Enlightenment ideals after the French revolution, a certain number of Iberian American countries decriminalized homosexuality after France and French territories in the Americas did so in 1791. Some of the countries that abolished sodomy laws or banned state interference in consensual adult sexuality in the 19th century were Dominican Republic (1822), Brazil (1824), Peru (1836), Mexico (1871), Paraguay (1880), Argentina (1887), Honduras (1899), Guatemala, and El Salvador. Today same-sex marriage is legal in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Uruguay, and French overseas departments. South America experienced waves of immigration of Europeans, especially Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese, Germans, Austrians, Poles, Ukrainians, French, Dutch, Russians, Croatians, Lithuanians, and Ashkenazi Jews. With the end of colonialism, French culture also exerted a direct influence in Latin America, especially in the realms of high culture, Independentism, science and medicine. This can be seen in the region&#x27;s artistic traditions, including painting, literature, and music, and in the realms of science and politics. 
* African cultures, whose presence stems from a long history of the Atlantic slave trade. People of African descent have influenced the ethno-scapes of Latin America and the Caribbean. This is manifested for instance in music, dance and religion, especially in countries like Brazil, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, and Cuba.
* Asian cultures, whose part of the presence derives from the long history of the coolies who mostly arrived during the 19th and 20th centuries, most commonly Chinese workers in Peru and Venezuela, but also from Japanese and Korean immigration. especially headed to Brazil. This has greatly affected cuisine and other traditions including literature, art and lifestyles and politics. Asian influences have especially affected Brazil, Cuba, Panama and Peru.
* The influence of the United States and globalization is present throughout the region, with particular strength in northern Latin America, especially Puerto Rico, which is an American territory. Prior to 1959, Cuba, which fought for its independence with American aid in the Spanish–American War, also had a close political and economic relationship with the United States. The United States also helped Panama become independent from Colombia and built the twenty-mile-long Panama Canal Zone in Panama, which it held from 1903—the Panama Canal opened to transoceanic freight traffic in 1914—to 1999, when the Torrijos-Carter Treaties restored Panamanian control of the Canal Zone.

===Art===
Beyond the tradition of Indigenous art, the development of Latin American visual art owed much to the influence of Spanish, Portuguese and French Baroque painting, which in turn often followed the trends of the Italians. In general, artistic Eurocentrism began to wane in the early twentieth century with the increased appreciation for indigenous forms of representation.

From the early twentieth century, the art of Latin America was greatly inspired by the Constructivist Movement. The movement rapidly spread from Russia to Europe and then into Latin America. Joaquín Torres García and Manuel Rendón have been credited with bringing the Constructivist Movement into Latin America from Europe.

An important artistic movement generated in Latin America is &quot;muralism&quot; represented by Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, José Clemente Orozco and Rufino Tamayo in Mexico, Santiago Martinez Delgado and Pedro Nel Gómez in Colombia and Antonio Berni in Argentina. Some of the most impressive &quot;Muralista&quot; works can be found in Mexico, Colombia, New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Philadelphia.

Painter Frida Kahlo, one of the most famous Mexican artists, painted about her own life and the Mexican culture in a style combining Realism, Symbolism and Surrealism. Kahlo&#x27;s work commands the highest selling price of all Latin American paintings.

The Venezuelan Armando Reverón, whose work begins to be recognized internationally, is one of the most important artists of the 20th century in South America; he is a precursor of Arte Povera and Happening. In the 60s kinetic art emerged in Venezuela. Its main representatives are Jesús Soto, Carlos Cruz-Diez, Alejandro Otero and Gego.

Colombian sculptor and painter Fernando Botero has gained regional and international recognition for his works which, on first examination, are noted for their exaggerated proportions and the corpulence of the human and animal figures.

The Ecuadorian Oswaldo Guayasamín, considered one of the most important and seminal artists in Ecuador and South America. In his life, he made over 13,000 paintings and held more than 180 exhibitions all over the world, including Paris, Barcelona, New York, Buenos Aires, Moscow, Prague, and Rome. He brought his unique style of expressionism and cubism to the collection of Ecuador artwork during the Age of Anger which relates to the period of the Cold War when the United States opposed communist presence in South America. Social criticism of human and social inequality was central to his artwork.

===Film===
Latin American film is both rich and diverse. Historically, the main centers of production have been Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Cuba. Latin American film flourished after sound was introduced in cinema, which added a linguistic barrier to the export of Hollywood film south of the border.
Mexican cinema began in the silent era from 1896 to 1929 and flourished in the Golden Era of the 1940s. It boasted a huge industry comparable to Hollywood at the time, with stars such as María Félix, Dolores del Río, and Pedro Infante. In the 1970s, Mexico was the location for many cult horror and action movies. More recently, films such as &quot;Amores Perros&quot; (2000) and &quot;Y tu mamá también&quot; (2001) enjoyed box office and critical acclaim and propelled Alfonso Cuarón and Alejandro González Iñárritu to the front rank of Hollywood directors. Iñárritu in 2010 directed &quot;Biutiful&quot; and &quot;Birdman&quot; (2014), Alfonso Cuarón directed &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; in 2004 and &quot;Gravity&quot; in 2013. A close friend of both, Guillermo del Toro, a top rank Hollywood director in Hollywood and Spain, directed &quot;Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot; (2006) and produced &quot;El Orfanato&quot; (2007). Carlos Carrera (&quot;The Crime of Father Amaro)&quot;, and screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga are also some of the best known modern Mexican film makers. &quot;Rudo y Cursi&quot; released in December (2008) in Mexico, was directed by Carlos Cuarón.
Argentine cinema has also been prominent since the first half of the 20th century and today averages over 60 full-length titles yearly. The industry suffered during the 1976–1983 military dictatorship; but re-emerged to produce the Academy Award winner &quot;The Official Story&quot; in 1985. A wave of imported US films again damaged the industry in the early 1990s, though it soon recovered, thriving even during the Argentine economic crisis around 2001. Many Argentine movies produced during recent years have been internationally acclaimed, including &quot;Nueve reinas&quot; (2000), &quot;Son of the Bride&quot; (2001), &quot;El abrazo partido&quot; (2004), &quot;El otro&quot; (2007), the 2010 Foreign Language Academy Award winner &quot;El secreto de sus ojos&quot;, &quot;Wild Tales&quot; (2014) and &quot;Argentina, 1985&quot; (2022).

In Brazil, the &quot;Cinema Novo&quot; movement created a particular way of making movies with critical and intellectual screenplays, clearer photography related to the light of the outdoors in a tropical landscape, and a political message. The modern Brazilian film industry has become more profitable inside the country, and some of its productions have received prizes and recognition in Europe and the United States, with movies such as &quot;Central do Brasil&quot; (1999), &quot;Cidade de Deus&quot; (2002) and &quot;Tropa de Elite&quot; (2007).
Puerto Rican cinema has produced some notable films, such as &quot;Una Aventura Llamada Menudo&quot;, &quot;Los Diaz de Doris&quot; and &quot;Casi Casi&quot;. An influx of Hollywood films affected the local film industry in Puerto Rico during the 1980s and 1990s, but several Puerto Rican films have been produced since and it has been recovering.

Cuban cinema has enjoyed much official support since the Cuban revolution and important film-makers include Tomás Gutiérrez Alea.

Venezuelan television has also had a great impact in Latin America, is said that whilst &quot;Venezuelan cinema began sporadically in the 1950s[, it] only emerged as a national-cultural movement in the mid-1970s&quot; when it gained state support and auteurs could produce work. International co-productions with Latin America and Spain continued into this era and beyond, and Venezuelan films of this time were counted among the works of New Latin American Cinema. This period is known as Venezuela&#x27;s Golden Age of cinema, having massive popularity even though it was a time of much social and political upheaval.

One of the most famous Venezuelan films, even to date, is the 1976 film Soy un delincuente by Clemente de la Cerda, which won the Special Jury Prize at the 1977 Locarno International Film Festival. Soy un delincuente was one of nine films for which the state gave substantial funding to produce, made in the year after the Venezuelan state began giving financial support to cinema in 1975. The support likely came from increased oil wealth in the early 1970s, and the subsequent 1973 credit incentive policy. At the time of its production the film was the most popular film in the country, and took a decade to be usurped from this position, even though it was only one in a string of films designed to tell social realist stories of struggle in the 1950s and &#x27;60s. Equally famous is the 1977 film El Pez que Fuma (Román Chalbaud). In 1981 FONCINE (the Venezuelan Film Fund) was founded, and this year it provided even more funding to produce seventeen feature films. A few years later in 1983 with Viernes Negro, oil prices dropped and Venezuela entered a depression which prevented such extravagant funding, but film production continued; more transnational productions occurred, many more with Spain due to Latin America&#x27;s poor economic fortune in general, and there was some in new cinema, as well: Fina Torres&#x27; 1985 Oriana won the Caméra d&#x27;Or Prize at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival as the best first feature. Film production peaked in 1984–5,:37 with 1986 considered Venezuelan cinema&#x27;s most successful year by the state, thanks to over 4 million admissions to national films, according to Venezuelanalysis. The Venezuelan capital of Caracas hosted the Ibero-American Forum on Cinematography Integration in 1989, from which the pan-continental IBERMEDIA was formed; a union which provides regional funding.

===Literature===



Pre-Columbian cultures were primarily oral, although the Aztecs and Maya, for instance, produced elaborate codices. Oral accounts of mythological and religious beliefs were also sometimes recorded after the arrival of European colonizers, as was the case with the Popol Vuh. Moreover, a tradition of oral narrative survives to this day, for instance among the Quechua-speaking population of Peru and the Quiché (K&#x27;iche&#x27;) of Guatemala.

From the very moment of Europe&#x27;s discovery of the continents, early explorers and conquistadores produced written accounts and crónicas of their experiencesuch as Columbus&#x27;s letters or Bernal Díaz del Castillo&#x27;s description of the conquest of Mexico. During the colonial period, written culture was often in the hands of the church, within which context Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz wrote memorable poetry and philosophical essays. Towards the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th, a distinctive criollo literary tradition emerged, including the first novels such as Lizardi&#x27;s &quot;El Periquillo Sarniento&quot; (1816).

The 19th century was a period of &quot;foundational fictions&quot; in critic Doris Sommer&#x27;s words, novels in the Romantic or Naturalist traditions that attempted to establish a sense of national identity, and which often focussed on the Indigenous question or the dichotomy of &quot;civilization or barbarism&quot; (for which see, say, Domingo Sarmiento&#x27;s &quot;Facundo&quot; (1845), Juan León Mera&#x27;s &quot;Cumandá&quot; (1879), or Euclides da Cunha&#x27;s &quot;Os Sertões&quot; (1902)). The 19th century also witnessed the realist work of Machado de Assis, who made use of surreal devices of metaphor and playful narrative construction, much admired by critic Harold Bloom.

At the turn of the 20th century, &quot;modernismo&quot; emerged, a poetic movement whose founding text was Nicaraguan poet Rubén Darío&#x27;s &quot;Azul&quot; (1888). This was the first Latin American literary movement to influence literary culture outside of the region, and was also the first truly Latin American literature, in that national differences were no longer so much at issue. José Martí, for instance, though a Cuban patriot, also lived in Mexico and the United States and wrote for journals in Argentina and elsewhere.

However, what really put Latin American literature on the global map was no doubt the literary boom of the 1960s and 1970s, distinguished by daring and experimental novels (such as Julio Cortázar&#x27;s &quot;Rayuela&quot; (1963)) that were frequently published in Spain and quickly translated into English. The Boom&#x27;s defining novel was Gabriel García Márquez&#x27;s &quot;Cien años de soledad&quot; (1967), which led to the association of Latin American literature with magic realism, though other important writers of the period such as the Peruvian Mario Vargas Llosa and Carlos Fuentes do not fit so easily within this framework. Arguably, the Boom&#x27;s culmination was Augusto Roa Bastos&#x27;s monumental &quot;Yo, el supremo&quot; (1974). In the wake of the Boom, influential precursors such as Juan Rulfo, Alejo Carpentier, and above all Jorge Luis Borges were also rediscovered.

Contemporary literature in the region is vibrant and varied, ranging from the best-selling Paulo Coelho and Isabel Allende to the more avant-garde and critically acclaimed work of writers such as Diamela Eltit, Giannina Braschi, Ricardo Piglia, or Roberto Bolaño. There has also been considerable attention paid to the genre of testimonio, texts produced in collaboration with subaltern subjects such as Rigoberta Menchú. Finally, a new breed of chroniclers is represented by the more journalistic Carlos Monsiváis and Pedro Lemebel.

The region boasts six Nobel Prize winners: in addition to the two Chilean poets Gabriela Mistral (1945) and Pablo Neruda (1971), there is also the Guatemalan novelist Miguel Ángel Asturias (1967), the Colombian writer Gabriel García Márquez (1982), the Mexican poet and essayist Octavio Paz (1990), and the Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa (2010).

===Music and dance===

Latin America has produced many successful worldwide artists in terms of recorded global music sales. Among the most successful have been Juan Gabriel (Mexico) only Latin American musician to have sold over 200 million records worldwide, Gloria Estefan (Cuba), Carlos Santana, Luis Miguel (Mexico) of whom have sold over 90 million records, Shakira (Colombia) and Vicente Fernández (Mexico) with over 50 million records sold worldwide. Enrique Iglesias, although not a Latin American, has also contributed for the success of Latin music.

Other notable successful mainstream acts through the years, include RBD, Celia Cruz, Soda Stereo, Thalía, Ricky Martin, Maná, Marc Anthony, Ricardo Arjona, Selena, and Menudo.

Latin Caribbean music, such as merengue, bachata, salsa, and more recently reggaeton, from such countries as the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Panama, has been strongly influenced by African rhythms and melodies.
Another well-known Latin American musical genre includes the Argentine and Uruguayan tango (with Carlos Gardel as the greatest exponent), as well as the distinct nuevo tango, a fusion of tango, acoustic and electronic music popularized by bandoneón virtuoso Ástor Piazzolla. Samba, North American jazz, European classical music and choro combined to form &quot;bossa nova&quot; in Brazil, popularized by guitarist João Gilberto with singer Astrud Gilberto and pianist Antonio Carlos Jobim.

Other influential Latin American sounds include the Antillean soca and calypso, Dennery segment which is a style of Soca music developed in Saint Lucia in the early 2010s which came from Kuduro music, Zouk influence and Lucian drums alongside lyrics usually sung in French Antillean Creole Kwéyòl, Bouyon music is a mixture of Soca, Zouk, and traditional genres native to Dominica which is sung in French Antillean Creole and is one of the most popular musical genres in Dominica, the Honduran (Garifuna) punta, the Colombian cumbia and vallenato, the Chilean cueca, the Ecuadorian boleros, the Haitian compas [ konpa] and rockoleras, the Mexican ranchera and the mariachi which is the epitome of Mexican soul, the Nicaraguan palo de Mayo, the Peruvian marinera and tondero, the Uruguayan candombe and the various styles of music from pre-Columbian traditions that are widespread in the Andean region.

The classical composer Heitor Villa-Lobos (1887–1959) worked on the recording of Native musical traditions within his homeland of Brazil. The traditions of his homeland heavily influenced his classical works. Also notable is the recent work of the Cuban Leo Brouwer, Uruguayan-American Miguel del Águila, guitar works of the Venezuelan Antonio Lauro and the Paraguayan Agustín Barrios. Latin America has also produced world-class classical performers such as the Chilean pianist Claudio Arrau, Brazilian pianist Nelson Freire and the Argentine pianist and conductor Daniel Barenboim. Brazilian opera soprano Bidu Sayão, one of Brazil&#x27;s most famous musicians, was a leading artist of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City from 1937 to 1952.

Arguably, the main contribution to music entered through folklore, where the true soul of the Latin American and Caribbean countries is expressed. Musicians such as Yma Súmac, Chabuca Granda, Atahualpa Yupanqui, Violeta Parra, Víctor Jara, Jorge Cafrune, Facundo Cabral, Mercedes Sosa, Jorge Negrete, Luiz Gonzaga, Caetano Veloso, Susana Baca, Chavela Vargas, Simon Diaz, Julio Jaramillo, Toto la Momposina, Gilberto Gil, Maria Bethânia, Nana Caymmi, Nara Leão, Gal Costa, Ney Matogrosso as well as musical ensembles such as Inti Illimani and Los Kjarkas are magnificent examples of the heights that this soul can reach.

Latin pop, including many forms of rock, is popular in Latin America today (see Spanish language rock and roll). A few examples are Café Tacuba, Soda Stereo, Maná, Los Fabulosos Cadillacs, Rita Lee, Mutantes, Secos e Molhados Legião Urbana, Titãs, Paralamas do Sucesso, Cazuza, Barão Vermelho, Skank, Miranda!, Cansei de Ser Sexy or CSS, and Bajo Fondo.

More recently, reggaeton, which blends Jamaican reggae and dancehall with Latin America genres such as bomba and plena, as well as hip hop, is becoming more popular, in spite of the controversy surrounding its lyrics, dance steps (Perreo) and music videos. It has become very popular among populations with a &quot;migrant culture&quot; influence – both Latino populations in the United States, such as southern Florida and New York City, and parts of Latin America where migration to the United States is common, such as Trinidad and Tobago, Dominican Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Mexico.

<text>Lynx is a customizable text-based web browser for use on cursor-addressable character cell terminals. , it is the oldest web browser still being maintained, having started in 1992.

==History==
Lynx was a product of the Distributed Computing Group within Academic Computing Services of the University of Kansas. It was initially developed in 1992 by a team of students and staff at the university (Lou Montulli, Michael Grobe and Charles Rezac) as a hypertext browser used solely to distribute campus information as part of a &quot;Campus-Wide Information System&quot; and for browsing the Gopher space. Beta availability was announced to Usenet on 22 July 1992. In 1993, Montulli added an Internet interface and released a new version (2.0) of the browser.

, the support of communication protocols in Lynx is implemented using a version of libwww, forked from the library&#x27;s code base in 1996. The supported protocols include Gopher, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, NNTP and WAIS. Support for NNTP was added to libwww from ongoing Lynx development in 1994. Support for HTTPS was added to Lynx&#x27;s fork of libwww later, initially as patches due to concerns about encryption.

Garrett Blythe created DosLynx in April 1994 and later joined the Lynx effort as well. Foteos Macrides ported much of Lynx to VMS and maintained it for a time. In 1995, Lynx was released under the GNU General Public License, and is now maintained by a group of volunteers led by Thomas Dickey.

==Features==

Browsing in Lynx consists of highlighting the chosen link using cursor keys, or having all links on a page numbered and entering the chosen link&#x27;s number. Current versions support SSL and many HTML features. Tables are formatted using spaces, while frames are identified by name and can be explored as if they were separate pages. Lynx is not inherently able to display various types of non-text content on the web, such as images and video, but it can launch external programs to handle it, such as an image viewer or a video player.

Unlike most web browsers, Lynx does not support JavaScript, which many websites require to work correctly.

The speed benefits of text-only browsing are most apparent when using low bandwidth internet connections, or older computer hardware that may be slow to render image-heavy content.

===Privacy===
Because Lynx does not support graphics, web bugs that track user information are not fetched, meaning that web pages can be read without the privacy concerns of graphic web browsers. However, Lynx does support HTTP cookies, which can also be used to track user information. Lynx therefore supports cookie whitelisting and blacklisting, or alternatively cookie support can be disabled permanently.

As with conventional browsers, Lynx also supports browsing histories and page caching, both of which can raise privacy concerns.

===Configurability===
Lynx supports both command-line options and configuration files. There are 142 command-line options according to its help message. The template configuration file codice_1 lists 233 configurable features. There is some overlap between the two approaches to configuration, although there are command-line options such as codice_2 which are not matched in codice_1. In addition to pre-set options by command-line and configuration file, Lynx&#x27;s behavior can be adjusted at runtime using its options menu. Again, there is some overlap between the settings. Lynx implements many of these runtime optional features, optionally (controlled through a setting in the configuration file) allowing the choices to be saved to a separate writable configuration file. The reason for restricting the options which can be saved originated in a usage of Lynx which was more common in the mid-1990s, i.e., using Lynx itself as a front-end application to the Internet accessed by dial-in connections.

===Accessibility===
Because Lynx is a text-based browser, it can be used for internet access by visually impaired users on a refreshable braille display and is easily compatible with text-to-speech software. As Lynx substitutes images, frames and other non-textual content with the text from codice_4, codice_5 and codice_6 HTML attributes and allows hiding the user interface elements, the browser becomes specifically suitable for use with cost-effective general purpose screen reading software. A version of Lynx specifically enhanced for use with screen readers on Windows was developed at Indian Institute of Technology Madras.

===Remote access===
Lynx is also useful for accessing websites from a remotely connected system in which no graphical display is available. Despite its text-only nature and age, it can still be used to effectively browse much of the modern web, including performing interactive tasks such as editing Wikipedia.

===Web design and robots===
Since Lynx will take keystrokes from a text file, it is still very useful for automated data entry, web page navigation, and web scraping. Consequently, Lynx is used in some web crawlers. Web designers may use Lynx to determine the way in which search engines and web crawlers see the sites that they develop. Online services that provide Lynx&#x27;s view of a given web page are available.

Lynx is also used to test websites&#x27; performance. As one can run the browser from different locations over remote access technologies like Telnet and SSH, one can use Lynx to test the website&#x27;s connection performance from different geographical locations simultaneously. Another possible web design application of the browser is quick checking of the site&#x27;s links.

==Supported platforms==

Lynx was originally designed for Unix-like operating systems. It was ported to VMS soon after its public release and to other systems, including DOS, Microsoft Windows, Classic Mac OS and OS/2. It was included in the default OpenBSD installation from OpenBSD 2.3 (May 1998) to 5.5 (May 2014), being in the main tree prior to July 2014, subsequently being made available through the ports tree. Lynx can also be found in the repositories of most Linux distributions, as well as in the Homebrew, Fink, and MacPorts repositories for macOS. Ports to BeOS, MINIX, QNX, AmigaOS and OS/2 are also available.

The sources can be built on many platforms, such as Google&#x27;s Android operating system.

<text>L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule (, ) or L&#x27;Hospital&#x27;s rule, also known as Bernoulli&#x27;s rule, is a mathematical theorem that allows evaluating limits of indeterminate forms using derivatives. Application (or repeated application) of the rule often converts an indeterminate form to an expression that can be easily evaluated by substitution. The rule is named after the 17th-century French mathematician Guillaume De l&#x27;Hôpital. Although the rule is often attributed to De l&#x27;Hôpital, the theorem was first introduced to him in 1694 by the Swiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli.

L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule states that for functions and which are defined on an open interval and differentiable on formula_1 for a (possibly infinite) accumulation point of , if formula_2 and formula_3 for all in formula_1, and formula_5 exists, then
:formula_6

The differentiation of the numerator and denominator often simplifies the quotient or converts it to a limit that can be directly evaluated by continuity.

Guillaume de l&#x27;Hôpital (also written l&#x27;Hospital) published this rule in his 1696 book &quot;Analyse des Infiniment Petits pour l&#x27;Intelligence des Lignes Courbes&quot; (literal translation: &quot;Analysis of the Infinitely Small for the Understanding of Curved Lines&quot;), the first textbook on differential calculus. However, it is believed that the rule was discovered by the Swiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli.

== General form ==
The general form of L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule covers many cases. Let and be extended real numbers: real numbers, positive or negative infinity. Let be an open interval containing (for a two-sided limit) or an open interval with endpoint (for a one-sided limit, or a limit at infinity if is infinite). On formula_7, the real-valued functions and are assumed differentiable with formula_8. It is also assumed that formula_9, a finite or infinite limit. 

If eitherformula_10orformula_11thenformula_12Although we have written throughout, the limits may also be one-sided limits ( or ), when is a finite endpoint of .

In the second case, the hypothesis that diverges to infinity is not necessary; in fact, it is sufficient that formula_13

The hypothesis that formula_14 appears most commonly in the literature, but some authors sidestep this hypothesis by adding other hypotheses which imply formula_14. For example, one may require in the definition of the limit formula_9 that the function formula_17 must be defined everywhere on an interval formula_7. Another method is to require that both and be differentiable everywhere on an interval containing .

== Necessity of conditions: Counterexamples ==

All four conditions for L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule are necessary:

# Indeterminacy of form: formula_19 or formula_20 ; 
# Differentiability of functions: formula_21 and formula_22 are differentiable on an open interval formula_23 except possibly at the limit point formula_24 in formula_23; 
# Non-zero derivative of denominator: formula_26 for all formula_27 in formula_23 with formula_29 ; 
# Existence of limit of the quotient of the derivatives: formula_30 exists.

Where one of the above conditions is not satisfied, L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule is not valid in general, and its conclusion may be false in certain cases.

=== 1. Form is not indeterminate ===
The necessity of the first condition can be seen by considering the counterexample where the functions are formula_31 and formula_32 and the limit is formula_33.

The first condition is not satisfied for this counterexample because formula_34 and formula_35. This means that the form is not indeterminate.

The second and third conditions are satisfied by formula_21 and formula_22. The fourth condition is also satisfied with

formula_38

But the conclusion fails, since formula_39
=== 2. Differentiability of functions ===
Differentiability of functions is a requirement because if a function is not differentiable, then the derivative of the function is not guaranteed to exist at each point in formula_23. The fact that formula_23 is an open interval is grandfathered in from the hypothesis of the Cauchy&#x27;s mean value theorem. The notable exception of the possibility of the functions being not differentiable at formula_24 exists because L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule only requires the derivative to exist as the function approaches formula_24; the derivative does not need to be taken at formula_24. 

For example, let formula_45 , formula_46, and formula_47. In this case, formula_21 is not differentiable at formula_24. However, since formula_21 is differentiable everywhere except formula_24, then formula_52 still exists. Thus, since 

formula_53 and formula_54 exists, L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule still holds.

=== 3. Derivative of denominator is zero ===
The necessity of the condition that formula_14 near formula_56 can be seen by the following counterexample due to Otto Stolz. Let formula_57 and formula_58 Then there is no limit for formula_59 as formula_60 However,

:formula_61

which tends to 0 as formula_62, although it is undefined at infinitely many points. Further examples of this type were found by Ralph P. Boas Jr.

=== 4. Limit of derivatives does not exist ===
The requirement that the limit formula_63 exists is essential; if it does not exist, the other limit formula_64 may nevertheless exist. Indeed, as formula_65 approaches formula_56, the functions formula_67 or formula_68 may exhibit many oscillations of small amplitude but steep slope, which do not affect formula_64 but do prevent the convergence of formula_63. 

For example, if formula_71, formula_72 and formula_73, then formula_74which does not approach a limit since cosine oscillates infinitely between and . But the ratio of the original functions does approach a limit, since the amplitude of the oscillations of formula_67 becomes small relative to formula_68:

:formula_77

In a case such as this, all that can be concluded is that

: formula_78

so that if the limit of formula_79 exists, then it must lie between the inferior and superior limits of formula_80 . In the example, 1 does indeed lie between 0 and 2.)

Note also that by the contrapositive form of the Rule, if formula_64 does not exist, then formula_63 also does not exist.

==Examples==
In the following computations, we indicate each application of L&#x27;Hopital&#x27;s rule by the symbol formula_83. 
* Here is a basic example involving the exponential function, which involves the indeterminate form at : formula_84
* This is a more elaborate example involving . Applying L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule a single time still results in an indeterminate form. In this case, the limit may be evaluated by applying the rule three times: formula_85
* Here is an example involving : formula_86 Repeatedly apply L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule until the exponent is zero (if is an integer) or negative (if is fractional) to conclude that the limit is zero.
* Here is an example involving the indeterminate form (see below), which is rewritten as the form : formula_87
*Here is an example involving the mortgage repayment formula and . Let be the principal (loan amount), the interest rate per period and the number of periods. When is zero, the repayment amount per period is formula_88 (since only principal is being repaid); this is consistent with the formula for non-zero interest rates: formula_89
* One can also use L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule to prove the following theorem. If is twice-differentiable in a neighborhood of and its second derivative is continuous on this neighborhood, then formula_90
*Sometimes L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule is invoked in a tricky way: suppose formula_91 converges as and that formula_92 converges to positive or negative infinity. Then:formula_93and so, formula_94 exists and formula_95 (This result remains true without the added hypothesis that formula_92 converges to positive or negative infinity, but the justification is then incomplete.)
== Complications ==
Sometimes L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule does not reduce to an obvious limit in a finite number of steps, unless some intermediate simplifications are applied. Examples include the following:

* Two applications can lead to a return to the original expression that was to be evaluated: formula_97 This situation can be dealt with by substituting formula_98 and noting that goes to infinity as goes to infinity; with this substitution, this problem can be solved with a single application of the rule: formula_99 Alternatively, the numerator and denominator can both be multiplied by formula_100 at which point L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule can immediately be applied successfully: formula_101
*An arbitrarily large number of applications may never lead to an answer even without repeating:formula_102This situation too can be dealt with by a transformation of variables, in this case formula_103: formula_104 Again, an alternative approach is to multiply numerator and denominator by formula_105 before applying L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule: formula_106

A common logical fallacy is to use L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule to prove the value of a derivative by computing the limit of a difference quotient. Since applying l&#x27;Hôpital requires knowing the relevant derivatives, this amounts to circular reasoning or begging the question, assuming what is to be proved. For example, consider the proof of the derivative formula for powers of &quot;x&quot;:

:formula_107

Applying L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule and finding the derivatives with respect to yields 
 as expected, but this computation requires the use of the very formula that is being proven. Similarly, to prove formula_108, applying L&#x27;Hôpital requires knowing the derivative of formula_109 at formula_110, which amounts to calculating formula_111 in the first place; a valid proof requires a different method such as the squeeze theorem. 

== Other indeterminate forms ==
Other indeterminate forms, such as , , , , and , can sometimes be evaluated using L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule. We again indicate applications of L&#x27;Hopital&#x27;s rule by formula_83.

For example, to evaluate a limit involving , convert the difference of two functions to a quotient:

:formula_113

L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule can be used on indeterminate forms involving exponents by using logarithms to &quot;move the exponent down&quot;. Here is an example involving the indeterminate form :

:formula_114

It is valid to move the limit inside the exponential function because this function is continuous. Now the exponent formula_65 has been &quot;moved down&quot;. The limit formula_116 is of the indeterminate form dealt with in an example above: L&#x27;Hôpital may be used to determine that

:formula_117

Thus

:formula_118

The following table lists the most common indeterminate forms and the transformations which precede applying l&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule:

== Stolz–Cesàro theorem ==
The Stolz–Cesàro theorem is a similar result involving limits of sequences, but it uses finite difference operators rather than derivatives.

== Geometric interpretation: parametric curve and velocity vector ==
Consider the parametric curve in the &quot;xy&quot;-plane with coordinates given by the continuous functions formula_119 and formula_120, the locus of points formula_121, and suppose formula_122. The slope of the tangent to the curve at formula_123 is the limit of the ratio formula_124 as . The tangent to the curve at the point formula_121 is the velocity vector formula_126 with slope formula_127. L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule then states that the slope of the curve at the origin () is the limit of the tangent slope at points approaching the origin, provided that this is defined.

== Proof of L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule ==

===Special case===
The proof of L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule is simple in the case where and are continuously differentiable at the point and where a finite limit is found after the first round of differentiation. This is only a special case of L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule, because it only applies to functions satisfying stronger conditions than required by the general rule. However, many common functions have continuous derivatives (e.g. polynomials, sine and cosine, exponential functions), so this special case covers most applications.

Suppose that and are continuously differentiable at a real number , that formula_128, and that formula_129. Then

: formula_130

This follows from the difference quotient definition of the derivative. The last equality follows from the continuity of the derivatives at . The limit in the conclusion is not indeterminate because formula_131.

The proof of a more general version of L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule is given below.

===General proof===
The following proof is due to , where a unified proof for the formula_132 and formula_133 indeterminate forms is given. Taylor notes that different proofs may be found in and .

Let &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; be functions satisfying the hypotheses in the General form section. Let formula_134 be the open interval in the hypothesis with endpoint &quot;c&quot;. Considering that formula_14 on this interval and &quot;g&quot; is continuous, formula_134 can be chosen smaller so that &quot;g&quot; is nonzero on formula_134.

For each &quot;x&quot; in the interval, define formula_138 and formula_139 as formula_140 ranges over all values between &quot;x&quot; and &quot;c&quot;. (The symbols inf and sup denote the infimum and supremum.)

From the differentiability of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; on formula_134, Cauchy&#x27;s mean value theorem ensures that for any two distinct points &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in formula_134 there exists a formula_143 between &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; such that formula_144. Consequently, formula_145 for all choices of distinct &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in the interval. The value &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)-&quot;g&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) is always nonzero for distinct &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in the interval, for if it was not, the mean value theorem would imply the existence of a &quot;p&quot; between &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; such that &quot;g&#x27; &quot;(&quot;p&quot;)=0.

The definition of &quot;m&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) will result in an extended real number, and so it is possible for them to take on the values ±∞. In the following two cases, &quot;m&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) will establish bounds on the ratio .

Case 1: formula_146

For any &quot;x&quot; in the interval formula_134, and point &quot;y&quot; between &quot;x&quot; and &quot;c&quot;,
:formula_148
and therefore as &quot;y&quot; approaches &quot;c&quot;, formula_149 and formula_150 become zero, and so
:formula_151

Case 2: formula_152

For every &quot;x&quot; in the interval formula_134, define formula_154. For every point &quot;y&quot; between &quot;x&quot; and &quot;c&quot;,
: formula_155

As &quot;y&quot; approaches &quot;c&quot;, both formula_156 and formula_157 become zero, and therefore
: formula_158

The limit superior and limit inferior are necessary since the existence of the limit of has not yet been established.

It is also the case that 
:formula_159

and
:formula_160 and formula_161

In case 1, the squeeze theorem establishes that formula_64 exists and is equal to &quot;L&quot;. In the case 2, and the squeeze theorem again asserts that formula_163, and so the limit formula_64 exists and is equal to &quot;L&quot;. This is the result that was to be proven.

In case 2 the assumption that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) diverges to infinity was not used within the proof. This means that if |&quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)| diverges to infinity as &quot;x&quot; approaches &quot;c&quot; and both &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; satisfy the hypotheses of L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule, then no additional assumption is needed about the limit of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;): It could even be the case that the limit of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) does not exist. In this case, L&#x27;Hopital&#x27;s theorem is actually a consequence of Cesàro–Stolz.

In the case when |&quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)| diverges to infinity as &quot;x&quot; approaches &quot;c&quot; and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) converges to a finite limit at &quot;c&quot;, then L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule would be applicable, but not absolutely necessary, since basic limit calculus will show that the limit of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)/&quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) as &quot;x&quot; approaches &quot;c&quot; must be zero.

== Corollary ==
A simple but very useful consequence of L&#x27;Hopital&#x27;s rule is that the derivative of a function cannot have a removable discontinuity. That is, suppose that &quot;f&quot; is continuous at &quot;a&quot;, and that formula_165 exists for all &quot;x&quot; in some open interval containing &quot;a&quot;, except perhaps for formula_166. Suppose, moreover, that formula_167 exists. Then formula_168 also exists and
:formula_169
In particular, &quot;f&quot;&#x27; is also continuous at &quot;a&quot;. 

Thus, if a function is not continuously differentiable near a point, the derivative must have an essential discontinuity at that point.

===Proof===
Consider the functions formula_170 and formula_171. The continuity of &quot;f&quot; at &quot;a&quot; tells us that formula_172. Moreover, formula_173 since a polynomial function is always continuous everywhere. Applying L&#x27;Hopital&#x27;s rule shows that formula_174.

<doc id="18532" wikidata="Q178433" url="?curid=18532" title="Lexicology">
<text>Lexicology is the branch of linguistics that analyzes the lexicon of a specific language. A word is the smallest meaningful unit of a language that can stand on its own, and is made up of small components called morphemes and even smaller elements known as phonemes, or distinguishing sounds. Lexicology examines every feature of a word – including formation, spelling, origin, usage, and definition.

Lexicology also considers the relationships that exist between words. In linguistics, the lexicon of a language is composed of lexemes, which are abstract units of meaning that correspond to a set of related forms of a word. Lexicology looks at how words can be broken down as well as identifies common patterns they follow.

Lexicology is associated with lexicography, which is the practice of compiling dictionaries.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;lexicology&quot; derives from the Greek word λεξικόν &quot;lexicon&quot; (neuter of λεξικός &quot;lexikos&quot;, &quot;of or for words&quot;, from λέξις &quot;lexis&quot;, &quot;speech&quot; or &quot;word&quot;) and -λογία &quot;-logia&quot;, &quot;the study of&quot; (a suffix derived from λόγος &quot;logos&quot;, amongst others meaning &quot;learning, reasoning, explanation, subject-matter&quot;).
Etymology as a science is actually a focus of lexicology. Since lexicology studies the meaning of words and their semantic relations, it often explores the history and development of a word. Etymologists analyze related languages using the comparative method, which is a set of techniques that allow linguists to recover the ancestral phonological, morphological, syntactic, etc., components of modern languages by comparing their cognate material. This means many word roots from different branches of the Indo-European language family can be traced back to single words from the Proto-Indo-European language. The English language, for instance, contains more borrowed words (or loan words) in its vocabulary than native words. Examples include &quot;parkour&quot; from French, &quot;karaoke&quot; from Japanese, &quot;coconut&quot; from Portuguese, &quot;mango&quot; from Hindi, etc. A lot of music terminology, like &quot;piano&quot;, &quot;solo&quot;, and &quot;opera&quot;, is borrowed from Italian. These words can be further classified according to the linguistic element that is borrowed: phonemes, morphemes, and semantics.

== Approach ==
General lexicology is the broad study of words regardless of a language&#x27;s specific properties. It is concerned with linguistic features that are common among all languages, such as phonemes and morphemes. Special lexicology, on the other hand, looks at what a particular language contributes to its vocabulary, such as grammars. Altogether lexicological studies can be approached two ways:

# Diachronic or historical lexicology is devoted to the evolution of words and word-formation over time. It investigates the origins of a word and the ways in which its structure, meaning, and usage have since changed.
# Synchronic or descriptive lexicology examines the words of a language within a certain time frame. This could be a period during the language&#x27;s early stages of development, its current state, or any given interval in between.

These complementary perspectives were proposed by Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure. Lexicology can have both comparative and contrastive methodologies. Comparative lexicology searches for similar features that are shared among two or more languages. Contrastive lexicology identifies the linguistic characteristics which distinguish between related and unrelated languages.

== Semantics ==

The of semantics that pertains especially to lexicological work is called lexical semantics. In brief, lexical semantics contemplates the significance of words and their meanings through several lenses, including synonymy, antonymy, hyponymy, and polysemy, among others. Semantic analysis of lexical material may involve both the contextualization of the word(s) and syntactic ambiguity. Semasiology and onomasiology are relevant linguistic disciplines associated with lexical semantics.

A word can have two kinds of meaning: grammatical and lexical. Grammatical meaning refers to a word&#x27;s function in a language, such as tense or plurality, which can be deduced from affixes. Lexical meaning is not limited to a single form of a word, but rather what the word denotes as a base word. For example, the verb &quot;to walk&quot; can become &quot;walks&quot;, &quot;walked&quot;, and &quot;walking –&quot; each word has a different grammatical meaning, but the same lexical meaning (&quot;to move one&#x27;s feet at a regular pace&quot;).

== Phraseology ==
Another focus of lexicology is phraseology, which studies multi-word expressions, or idioms, like &#x27;raining cats and dogs.&#x27; The meaning of the phrase as a whole has a different meaning than each word does on its own and is often unpredictable when considering its components individually. Phraseology examines how and why such meanings exist, and analyzes the laws that govern these word combinations.

Idioms and other phraseological units can be classified according to content and/ or meaning. They are difficult to translate word-for-word from one language to another.

<doc id="18534" wikidata="Q321534" url="?curid=18534" title="Lake Abitibi">
<text>Lake Abitibi (, ) is a shallow lake in northeastern Ontario and western Quebec, Canada. The lake, which lies within the vast Clay Belt, is separated in two distinct portions by a short narrows, making it actually two lakes. Its total area is , and net area . The lake is shallow and studded with islands. Its shores and vicinity are covered with small timber.

Its outlet is the Abitibi River, a tributary of the Moose River, which empties into James Bay. The lake takes its name from the river. &quot;Abitibi&quot; comes from the Algonquin words &quot;abitah&quot;, meaning middle and &quot;nipi&quot; meaning water, possibly a reference to its geographic location between the Harricana (from the Algonquin word &quot;Nanikana&quot;, meaning &quot;the main way&quot;) to the east and the Kapuskasing–Mattagami river system to the west.

Water levels on the lake are influenced by the Twin Falls Dam on the Abitibi River.

Portions of Lake Abitibi&#x27;s southern shores and a section of the Abitibi River are part of the Abitibi-de-Troyes Provincial Park. The islands in Ontario&#x27;s portion of the lake are protected in the Lake Abitibi Islands Provincial Park. The entire McDougall Point Peninsula, that separates the lake in two, is part of the Mcdougal Point Peninsula Conservation Reserve.

Pointe Abitibi at the mouth of the Duparquet River is a National Historic Site of Canada. This site, known as Apitipik National Historic Site of Canada, was a summer gathering place for the Abitibiwinnik until 1956 and the location of several trading posts between 1686 and 1922.

==History==
Artifacts dating to the Late Archaic period have been found at Lake Abitibi.

Application of &quot;Abitibi&quot; to describe the lake and the people living in the area around it was first noted in The Jesuit Relations in 1640. One of the first Europeans in this area was Pierre de Troyes, who built a post on Lake Abitibi when he was on his way to capture English HBC posts on James Bay in 1686. The Abitibi Post lay halfway between trading posts on James Bay and those on the Ottawa River and was in continuous existence throughout the French period.

The lake was part of the canoe route from James Bay to Montreal, via the Moose and Abitibi Rivers, then a series of intermediate streams and portages to Lake Temiskaming and the Ottawa River.

After the British conquered Canada in 1763, free traders either took over the French fort or built another post on the lake, providing strong trading competition to the main Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) fort at Moose Factory and the HBC outpost at Frederick House. This moved the HBC to set up a post, called Abitibi House, on Lake Abitibi in 1794, located on the peninsula at the mouth of the Duparquet River. In subsequent decades this post, as well as competing posts of the North West Company, were rebuilt or moved to various locations around the lake and its islands. Being unproductive due to competition, the HBC abandoned Abitibi House in 1811. When two companies merged in 1821, the HBC took over the trading post of the North West Company on Lake Abitibi.

The construction of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (now Canadian National Railway) through this district made it of some importance at the start of the 20th century.

==Lake Abitibi Islands==

The Lake Abitibi Islands Provincial Park protects nearly all the islands on the Ontario side of Lake Abitibi. It includes 786 islands, from tiny shoals to large islands of up to . Some of the larger islands are Deer, Dominion, and St. Patrick, as well as the Mistaken Islands (the largest island in the lake, Nepawa Island, is not part of the park since it is in Clerval, Quebec). The park was created in 2005 when the Abitibi-De-Troyes Provincial Park was reconfigured.

The park is an important nesting habitat for many bird species, including great blue heron, bald eagle, osprey, and double-crested cormorant. The vegetation is characterized by intolerant hardwood and mixedwood forests, with black spruce, white spruce, and white birch as the common tree species.

It is a non-operating park, meaning that there are no facilities or services, and only accessible via air or water.

<doc id="18538" wikidata="Q28237" url="?curid=18538" title="Lansing, Michigan">
<text>Lansing () is the capital of the U.S. state of Michigan and the most populous city in Ingham County. It is mostly in the county, although portions of the city extend west into Eaton County and north into Clinton County. The 2020 census placed the city&#x27;s population at 112,644, making it the sixth most populous city in Michigan. The population of its metropolitan statistical area (MSA) was 541,297 at the 2020 census, the third largest in the state after metropolitan Detroit and Grand Rapids. It was named the new state capital of Michigan in 1847, ten years after Michigan became a state.

The Lansing metropolitan area, colloquially referred to as &quot;Mid-Michigan&quot;, is an important center for educational, cultural, governmental, commercial, and industrial functions. Neighboring East Lansing is home to Michigan State University, a public research university with an enrollment of more than 50,000. The area features two medical schools, one veterinary school, two nursing schools, and two law schools. It is the site of the Michigan State Capitol, the state Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, a federal court, the Library of Michigan and Historical Center, and headquarters of four national insurance companies.

Lansing is the only U.S. state capital (among the 47 located in counties) that is not also a county seat. The seat of government of Ingham County is Mason, but the county maintains some offices in Lansing.

==History==
===Exploration by Europeans===
The first recorded person of European descent to travel through the area that is now Lansing was British fur trader Hugh Heward and his French-Canadian team on April 24, 1790, while canoeing the Grand River. The land that was to become Lansing was surveyed as &quot;Township 4 North Range 2 West&quot; in February 1827 in what was then dense forest. It was the last of the county&#x27;s townships to be surveyed, and the land was not offered for sale until October 1830. There would be no roads to this area for decades to come.

===Founding myth===
Historians have lamented the persistence of a myth about Lansing&#x27;s founding.

The incorrect story of Lansing&#x27;s beginnings states that in the winter of 1835 and early 1836, two brothers from New York plotted the area now known as REO Town just south of downtown Lansing and named it &quot;Biddle City&quot;. This land lay in a floodplain and was underwater during the majority of the year. Nevertheless, the brothers went back to Lansing, New York, to sell plots for the town that did not exist. They told the New Yorkers this new &quot;city&quot; had an area of 65 blocks, a church and a public and academic square. 16 men bought plots in the nonexistent city, and upon reaching the area later that year found they were the victims of the scam. Many in the group, disappointed and now without funds to move on again, opted to stay and ended up settling around what is now metropolitan Lansing.

The story has persisted due to a 1904 newspaper article, which cited a memoir told by Daniel W. Buck, a respected Lansing mayor and son of one of the early pioneers. His story was cited in Michigan pioneer papers and retold in newspaper articles multiple times in the decades that followed. His characterization of the city as being born from a &quot;land scam&quot; was incorrect, though his story had some elements of truth as well.

===Origins as a town===
The brothers were William and Jerry Ford. Although they were originally from New York, they were well-respected businessmen who hailed from Jackson and were instrumental during its earliest years.

In 1836, they bought 290 acres in the northwest corner of Ingham County. They platted the land and hoped to build a community they named Biddle City, located south of the convergence of the Grand River and the Red Cedar River, in Lansing&#x27;s present-day REO Town neighborhood. Biddle City&#x27;s plat map included plans for a public square, church square and academy square. They sold 21 parcels of it — mostly to other Michiganders, not New Yorkers — and buyers understood that it was not yet a real city. Unfortunately, Biddle City never took off. The financial Panic of 1837 forced the brothers to heavily mortgage the property, and the city never materialized.

Biddle City was not Lansing&#x27;s original name, nor a precursor to it, as the plat was located outside of Lansing&#x27;s original city limits.

Originally, all that existed was Lansing Township, named in 1842 by an early settler, Joseph E. North Sr., after Lansing in Tompkins County, NY, where he was from.

The settlement of fewer than 20 people that would become the City of Lansing remained quiet until the winter of 1847. The state constitution required the capital be moved from Detroit to a more central and safer location in the state&#x27;s interior in 1847; many were concerned about Detroit&#x27;s proximity to British-controlled Canada, which had captured Detroit in the War of 1812. The United States had recaptured the city in 1813, but these events led to the dire need to have the center of government relocated further away from hostile British territory. There was also concern with Detroit&#x27;s strong influence over Michigan politics, being the state&#x27;s largest city as well as the capital city.

During the multi-day session to determine a new location for the state capital, many cities, including Ann Arbor, Marshall, and Jackson, lobbied hard to win this designation. Unable to publicly reach a consensus because of constant political wrangling, the Michigan House of Representatives privately chose the Township of Lansing out of frustration. When announced, many present openly laughed that such an insignificant settlement was now Michigan&#x27;s capital. Two months later, Governor William L. Greenly signed into law the act of the legislature making Lansing Township the state capital.

With the announcement that Lansing Township had been made the capital, the small settlement quickly transformed into the seat of state government. Within months after it became the capital city, further individual settlements began to develop around it, along three key points along the Grand River in the township:

* &quot;Lower Village/Town&quot;, where present-day Old Town stands, was the oldest of the three villages. It was home to the first house built in Lansing in 1843 by pioneer James Seymour and his family. Lower Town began to develop in 1847 with the completion of the Franklin Avenue (now Grand River Avenue) covered bridge over the Grand River.
* &quot;Upper Village/Town&quot;, where present-day REO Town stands at the confluence of the Grand River and the Red Cedar River. It began to take off in 1847 when the Main Street Bridge was constructed over the Grand River. This village&#x27;s focal point was the Benton House, a 4-story hotel, which opened in 1848. It was the first brick building in Lansing and was later razed in 1900.
* &quot;Middle Village/Town&quot;, where downtown Lansing now stands, was the last of the three villages to develop in 1848 with the completion of the Michigan Avenue bridge across the Grand River and the completion of the temporary capitol building which sat where Cooley Law School stands today on Capitol Avenue between Allegan and Washtenaw Streets, and finally the relocation of the post office to the village in 1851. This area would grow to become larger than the other two villages up and down river.

The collection of original settlements (&quot;Upper Town&quot;, &quot;Lower Town&quot; and &quot;Middle Town&quot;) had for some years been collectively referred to as the &quot;Village of Michigan&quot;. On February 16, 1842, Alaiedon township was split into the townships of Lansing, Delhi and Meridian (originally suggested as &quot;Genoa&quot;) based on a petition submitted in December 1841 by Henry North, Roswell Everett and Zalmon Holmes. Henry North proposed the name &quot;Lansing&quot; for the township at the request of his father, who wanted it named after their old town of Lansing, New York.

On February 15, 1859, the settlement, having grown to nearly 3,000 and encompassing about in area, was incorporated as a city, carving off a section of seven square miles from Lansing Township. The boundaries of the original city were Douglas Avenue to the north, Wood and Regent streets to the east, Mount Hope Avenue to the south, and Jenison Avenue to the west. These boundaries would remain until 1916. Lansing began to grow steadily over the next two decades with the completion of the railroads through the city, a plank road, and the completion of the current capitol building in 1878.

Most of what is known as Lansing today is the result of the city becoming an industrial powerhouse which began with the founding of Olds Motor Vehicle Company in August 1897. The company went through many changes, including a buyout, between its founding to 1905 when founder Ransom E. Olds started his new REO Motor Car Company, which would last in Lansing for another 70 years. Olds would be joined by the less successful Clarkmobile around 1903. Over the next decades, the city would be transformed into a major American industrial center for the manufacturing of automobiles and parts, among other industries. The city also continued to grow in area. By 1956, the city had grown to , and doubled in size over the next decade to its current size of roughly .

Today, the city&#x27;s economy is diversified among government service, healthcare, manufacturing, insurance, banking, and education.

===Notable events===

====Anti-slavery movement====
In the late 1840s to early 1850s, the citizens of Lansing were unified against slavery, and the city became a secondary stop on the Underground Railroad, as one of the last steps of an escape route that led through Battle Creek, Schoolcraft and Cassopolis. From Lansing, the route led to Durand, and then to either Port Huron or Detroit.

====Major fires====
The Kerns Hotel fire on December 11, 1934, was the deadliest in the city&#x27;s history. Perhaps thirty-four people died in the fire, although the hotel register was also destroyed making an exact count impossible.

On February 8, 1951, the Elliott-Larsen Building was intentionally set on fire by a state office employee. The following morning, the seventh floor collapsed down to the next level, which destroyed a large number of state historical records.

====Elephant incident====
On September 26, 1963, a 12-year-old, 3,000-pound female dancing elephant named Rajje (alternately reported as Raji and Little Rajjee, among other variations) rebelled against her trainer during a performance in a shopping-center circus near what was then Logan Street and Holmes Road in Lansing, and escaped into the streets, aggravated by the frenzied pursuit of nearly 4,000 local residents. The incident ended with the shooting of the elephant by Lansing police. Provoked by the growing crowd, Rajje&#x27;s rampage took her through the men&#x27;s wear, sporting goods and gift departments of a local Arlan&#x27;s discount store before leading police on a two-mile chase in which she knocked down and injured a 67-year-old man, tried to move a car, and caused thousands of dollars in damage before being killed.

&quot;Life Magazine&quot; quoted Rajje&#x27;s trainer, William Pratt, as shouting at the scene, &quot;Damn these people [...] They wouldn&#x27;t leave her alone.&quot;

The incident was widely reported, including a photospread in &quot;Life&quot;. While the &quot;Lansing State Journal&quot; coverage stressed the danger of the incident, the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; noted that witnesses cried out &quot;Murderers! Murderers!&quot; as police fired eight shots.

Author Nelson Algren cites the injustice and sad end of the pursuit of &quot;Raji, the Pixie-Eared Elephant&quot; in continuity with the ambush of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow in his introduction to a 1968 biography of the outlaws. Then teenage Lansing residents who had goaded the elephant later on recalled the incident with sober regret in a local newspaper retrospective in 2011.

==Geography==
Lansing is the centerpiece of a region of Michigan known as Mid-Michigan.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. This figure includes two 425 Agreements with Alaiedon Township and Meridian Township, and the four 425 Agreements with Delta Township since 2000.

Since the 2010 census, the city has entered into two additional 425 Agreements. The first agreement consisted of the temporary transfer of 1,888.2 acres of Lansing Capital Region International Airport to the city from DeWitt Township in 2011. The second agreement consisted of the temporary transfer of in Alaiedon Township for the expansion of the headquarters of Jackson National Life Insurance Company in 2013 bringing the area either fully or conditionally under control of the city to .

Under Michigan law, 425 Agreements are only temporary land sharing agreements and do not count as official annexations. The Census Bureau, however, for statistical purposes does count these as annexations. Not counting the temporary 425 Agreements, Lansing administers total.

Lansing is located in the south-central part of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, where the Grand River meets the Red Cedar River. The city occupies most of what had formerly been part of Lansing Charter Township. It has also annexed adjacent tracts of land in Delta Charter Township and Windsor Township in Eaton County to the west, Delhi Charter Township in Ingham County to the south, and in DeWitt Charter Township in Clinton County to the north. The city also controls three non-contiguous tracts of land through 425 Agreements (conditional land transfer agreements) with Meridian Charter Township, Delta Charter Township, and Alaiedon Township in Ingham County to the southeast. It is also located between the state&#x27;s two largest cities, Detroit and Grand Rapids.

Lansing elevations range between above sea level on the far south side of Lansing along Northrup Street near the Cedar Street intersection, to to above sea level along the Grand River.

The Grand River, the largest river in Michigan, flows through downtown Lansing, and the Red Cedar River, a tributary of the Grand, flows through the campus of Michigan State University to its confluence with the Grand in Lansing. Sycamore Creek, a tributary of the Red Cedar, flows northward through the southeastern part of the city. There are two lakes in the area, Park Lake and Lake Lansing, both northeast of the city. Lake Lansing is approximately in size and is a summer favorite for swimmers, boaters, and fishermen. Michigan State University Sailing Club and the Lansing Sailing Club are located on Lake Lansing, where sailing regattas are hosted throughout the summer.

The City of Lansing operates a total of of parkland, of which is parkland, are golflands, and are cemetery lands. However, this figure includes the Waverly Hills Golf Course and adjacent Michigan Avenue Park, whose are located within neighboring Lansing Township, but operated by the City of Lansing, and does not include the of the combined Hawk Island County Park and adjacent Soldan Dog Park operated by Ingham County within the city of Lansing. All together then, of the city (or approximately 10%) is publicly administered open space.

=== Neighborhoods ===

The city&#x27;s downtown is dominated by state government buildings, especially the State Capitol; but downtown has also experienced recent growth in new restaurants, retail stores and residential developments. Downtown Lansing had a historic city market that was one of the oldest continuously operating farmers&#x27; markets in the United States, until it closed in 2019. Downriver and north of downtown is historic Old Town Lansing with many architecturally significant buildings dating to the mid-19th century. Directly south of downtown on the other side of I-496 along Washington Avenue lies &quot;REO Town&quot;, the birthplace of the automobile in the United States, is where Ransom Eli Olds built factories along Washington Avenue. Ransom Eli Olds&#x27; home, which once overlooked the factories along Washington Avenue, was displaced by I-496.

Lansing is generally divided into four sections: the Eastside, Westside, Northwestside, and Southside. Each section contains a diverse array of neighborhoods. The Eastside, located east of the Grand River and north of the Red Cedar River, is the most ethnically diverse side of Lansing, with foreign-born citizens making up more of its population than any other side in the city. The Eastside&#x27;s commercial districts are located mainly along Michigan Avenue, and to a lesser extent along Kalamazoo Street. It is anchored by Frandor Shopping Center on the very eastern edge of the eastside.

The Westside, roughly located north, west, and south of the Grand River as it curves through the city, is sometimes regarded as the city&#x27;s most socio-economically diverse section. This side also contains Lansing&#x27;s downtown area, though this neighborhood is often included as an area all its own. Outside downtown, this side is largely a collection of residential neighborhoods and is served by only one other commercial area along Saginaw Street. However, it also includes a small part of the Old Town Commercial Association.

The Northwestside, generally located north of the Grand River, with the city limits defining its north and western borders, is physically the smallest side of the city. This part of the city includes moderate-density residential areas and some green areas. North of Grand River Avenue, the main street of the side, lie warehouses and light industrial areas served by a major rail line that runs through Lansing. The most notable landmark of this side is Lansing&#x27;s airport: Capital Region International Airport.

The Southside, usually described as the neighborhoods located south of the Grand and Red Cedar rivers and the I-496 freeway, is physically the largest and most populous side of the city. The area is largely residential in nature (south of Mount Hope Road near the northern edge) and is served by numerous commercial strips along Cedar Street, Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, Pennsylvania Avenue, and Waverly Road, which run north–south. The large Edgewood District is located in the southernmost part of the Southside and is sometimes referred to as South Lansing. Though it is the largest area of the city by both physical size and population, it has often been regarded by Southside citizens as Lansing&#x27;s most overlooked and forgotten area, as most of Lansing&#x27;s attention in recent decades has been put into the revitalization of the city&#x27;s historic core located mostly on small parts of both the East and Westside.

The middle of the Southside—South-Central Lansing—contains the Old Everett Area. This location once contained the Everett School District and was annexed into the city in 1948.

Unincorporated areas adjacent to Lansing include parts of Lansing Charter Township, such as the unincorporated community of Edgemont Park, as well as parts of Delta Charter Township, such as the unincorporated community of Waverly. Though they are not part of the City of Lansing, these unincorporated communities often use Lansing mailing addresses.

, the Lansing area has about 2,000 Arab Americans, mostly second-generation Christian Lebanese Americans as well as some Palestinian Americans.

The city is also home to a large number of temporary foreign residents enrolled as international students at Lansing Community College and nearby Michigan State University, with the city&#x27;s visitors bureau specifically promoting Mandarin-language video tours of Lansing, touting the &quot;more than 6,000&quot; Chinese students enrolled at MSU. The Lansing School District offers language immersion programs for its students in both Spanish and Chinese.

==Government==
Lansing is administered under a mayor–council government, more specifically a strong mayor form in which the mayor is the city&#x27;s chief executive officer. The mayor is obligated to appoint department heads (subject to council approval), and draft and administer a city budget among other responsibilities. The mayor may also veto legislation from council, though the veto can be overridden by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the council. The mayor and city clerk are elected at-large every four years.

The city council is the legislative body of the city and consists of eight members. Four members are elected from four single-member districts using the first-past-the-post method in the city&#x27;s wards, and four members are elected at-large using the block voting method. Members of the council serve staggered four-year terms. Half the council is up for election every two years, including two ward seats and two at-large seats. At its first meeting of the year, the council chooses from amongst its members a president and vice president. The president is the council&#x27;s presiding officer, and also chooses the chairs of council committees. In the absence of the president and vice president, the city clerk chairs the council.

The city largely supports the Democratic Party. It has not had a Republican mayor in office since 1993 when then-Democratic state representative David Hollister defeated incumbent Mayor Jim Crawford, who had formerly served as a Republican member on the Ingham County Board of Commissioners. However, all city elections are held on an officially nonpartisan basis.

Since given the ability to do so by the state in 1964, the city has levied an income tax of 1 percent on residents. 0.5 percent on non-residents, and 1.0 percent on corporations.

===State and federal representation===
Lansing is currently split between three congressional districts. Most of the city lies within the boundaries of Michigan&#x27;s 8th congressional district, which is represented by Democratic congresswoman Elissa Slotkin, who was elected in the 2018 midterm election. The small portion of the city that extends into Eaton County is located in the 7th district, which has been represented by Republican congressman Tim Walberg since 2011. The small portion of the city that extends into Clinton County is located in the 4th district, which has been represented by Republican congressman John Moolenaar since 2015.

At the state level, most of Lansing is located in the 23rd district of the Michigan Senate, which has been represented by Democratic state senator Curtis Hertel Jr. since 2015. The small portions of the city that extend into Eaton County and Clinton County is located in the 24th district of the Michigan Senate, are currently represented by Republican state senator Tom Barrett. The city lies in the 67th, 68th, 71st, and 93rd districts of the Michigan State House of Representatives, represented by state representatives Kara Hope (D-67), Sarah Anthony (D-68), Angela Witwer (D-71), and Graham Filler (R-93).

==Economy==

The Lansing metropolitan area&#x27;s major industries are government, education, insurance, healthcare, and automobile manufacturing. Being the state capital, many state government workers reside in the area.

Quality Dairy Company&#x27;s headquarters is located near REO Town in Lansing and operates its Dairy Plant and Bakery Plant from central Lansing as well.

The recent decline of the auto industry in the region has increased the region&#x27;s awareness of the importance of a strategy to foster the high-technology sector.

Early availability of high-speed Internet in 1996, as well as the MSU, Cooley Law School, and Lansing Community College student body population, fostered an intellectual environment for information technology companies to incubate. Lansing has a number of technology companies in the fields of information technology and biotechnology.

Several urban renewal projects by private developers are adding higher end apartments and condominiums to the Lansing market. The Arbaugh, a former department store across from Cooley Law School, was converted into apartments in 2005. Motor Wheel Lofts, a former industrial site, was converted into loft-style living spaces in mid-2006. A combination retail and residential complex immediately south of Cooley Law School Stadium (formerly &quot;Oldsmobile Park&quot;) called &quot;The Stadium District&quot;, was completed in 2007. The Stadium District was redeveloped using a grant from the Michigan State Housing Development Authority through the Cool Cities Initiative.

In May 2006 the historically significant Mutual Building located on Capitol Avenue was purchased by The Christman Company to be renovated back to its original grandeur and used as the company&#x27;s headquarters. Additional downtown developments include the renovation of the historic Hollister Building and the expansion of the former Abrams Aerial Building. As of August 2008, an 18-story condominium high-rise called Capitol Club Tower was in the design phase with the adjacent parking structure having been approved by city council and purchased by the developer. The city market, in existence since 1909, was approved to be sold for a multi-building mixed-use development called MarketPlace, right next to the current market on the adjacent riverfront. The MarketPlace project was redeveloped along with BallPark North, another mixed-use development that will be immediately north of Oldsmobile Stadium. A new city market was built north of the Lansing Center, but closed in 2019. Across the river, the Accident Fund Insurance Company renovated the former (art deco) Ottawa Street Powerplant into their new headquarters. In addition to the renovation, Accident Fund Insurance Company built a modern addition to the north of the historic portion that is connected by an atrium for more office space, as well as a parking structure. In 2009, the restaurant Troppo began construction on a new 2-story building that will have an open-air patio on the roof facing the Capitol building. Developer Eyde Co. announced plans on April 6, 2010, to renovate the historical and prominent Knapp&#x27;s building in downtown Lansing for first floor retail, office space and apartments/condos on the top floor (5th) in a $22–24 million project.

===Airports===

Scheduled commercial airline service is offered from Capital Region International Airport (formerly known as &quot;Capital City Airport&quot;). Delta Air Lines maintains a route to Detroit, while American Airlines offers non-stop flights to both Chicago O&#x27;Hare and Washington, D.C.. Apple Vacations provides seasonal flights to Cancún, Mexico; Montego Bay, Jamaica; and Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. UPS has a freight hub at Capital Region International Airport making up part of the 42 million pounds of annual cargo moving through the airport. In 2008 the airport received a port of entry designation – known as &quot;Port Lansing&quot; – and now has a permanent customs facility, thus changing its name to reflect the port of entry status. The same year a extension to the largest of the three runways – now – was completed to allow for larger aircraft to use the airport.

===Public transportation===
* Capital Area Transportation Authority (CATA) provides public transit bus service to the Lansing-East Lansing Metropolitan area on 33 routes. CATA boasts the second highest ridership in the state of Michigan after Detroit with 53,000 daily rides in September 2008 and 11,306,339 rides in fiscal year 2008. CATA also provides paratransit services through Spec-Tran and the &quot;Night Owl&quot;. Also, the &quot;Entertainment Express&quot; (CATA route 4) runs Thursday through Saturday from 7 pm to 2 am connecting downtown Lansing&#x27;s and East Lansing&#x27;s entertainment districts. CATA won APTA&#x27;s America&#x27;s Best Transit Award in the medium-size category (4–30 million rides) in 2007. CATA has two transportation centers (CTC), one in downtown Lansing and one on the campus of Michigan State University. In 2010, a study was conducted to consider ways of enhancing the Lansing-to-East Lansing route (currently known as Route 1), with options including enhanced bus service, single-car trolley service and light rail service. (Heavy rail was eliminated as an option early in the process, with enhanced bus service eventually winning out.)
* Greyhound Lines provides inter-city bus service. CATA and Greyhound are both located in the CATA Transportation Center (CTC) in downtown Lansing.
* Several taxicab companies serve the area. In 2001, Big Daddy Taxi opened using large vans to address the safety concerns of drunk driving and offered $3 rides for students of Michigan State University. In 2008 the Green Cab Company opened using Toyota Prius hybrid cars to provide &quot;green&quot; cabs to Lansing.

===Bicycling===
* The , non-motorized Lansing River Trail runs along the Grand River and the Red Cedar River, running as far east as Michigan State University, and passes Potter Park Zoo, the Capitol Loop, and several other destinations of interest, and as far west as Moores Park. The trail is accessible at many points along it, some with car parking lots. The trails breadth is extended from time to time. Currently, the trailheads are: North – Dietrich Park; East – Kircher Park; South – Maguire Park; West – Moores Park. All segments are hard-surfaced. The River Trail connects to other pathways/trails in the Lansing-metro area: East – Michigan State University path system; South – Sycamore Trail. Since the trail follows a river, most street crossings use platforms under existing street bridges to provide an uncommon amount of grade separation, to the benefit of both trail users and automobile traffic. As of February 2015, the River Trail is under construction to add paths as far as Holt.
