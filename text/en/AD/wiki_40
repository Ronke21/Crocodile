<text>Jerry Laymon Falwell Sr. (August 11, 1933 – May 15, 2007) was an American Baptist pastor, televangelist, and conservative activist. He was the founding pastor of the Thomas Road Baptist Church, a megachurch in Lynchburg, Virginia. He founded Lynchburg Christian Academy (Liberty Christian Academy) in 1967, founded Liberty University in 1971, and co-founded the Moral Majority in 1979.

==Early life and education==
Falwell and his twin brother Gene were born in the Fairview Heights area of Lynchburg, Virginia, on August 11, 1933, the sons of Helen Virginia (&quot;née&quot; Beasley) and Carey Hezekiah Falwell. His father was an entrepreneur and one-time bootlegger who was agnostic. His father shot and killed his brother Garland and died of cirrhosis of the liver in 1948 at the age of 55. His paternal grandfather was a staunch atheist. Jerry Falwell was a member of a group in Fairview Heights known to the police as &quot;the Wall Gang&quot; because they sat on a low concrete wall at the Pickeral Café. Falwell met Macel Pate on his first visit to Park Avenue Baptist Church in 1949; Macel was a pianist there. They married on April 12, 1958. The couple had two sons, Jerry Jr. (a lawyer who succeeded Jerry Sr. as president of Liberty University until 2020) and Jonathan (who succeeded Jerry Sr. as senior pastor at Thomas Road Baptist Church, and became chancellor of Liberty University in 2023), and a daughter, Jeannie (a surgeon).

Falwell and his wife had a close relationship, and she supported him throughout his career. The Falwells often appeared together in public, and did not shy away from showing physical affection. Of his marriage, Falwell jokingly said: &quot;Macel and I have never considered divorce. Murder maybe, but never divorce.&quot; Macel appreciated her husband&#x27;s non-combative, affable nature, writing in her book that he &quot;hated confrontation and didn&#x27;t want strife in our home... he did everything in his power to make me happy.&quot; The Falwells had been married for nearly 50 years when Jerry died.

Falwell graduated from Brookville High School in Lynchburg, and from then-unaccredited Baptist Bible College in Springfield, Missouri, in 1956. He enrolled there to subvert Pate&#x27;s relationship with her fiancé, who was a student there. Falwell was later awarded three honorary doctorates: Doctor of Divinity from Tennessee Temple Theological Seminary, Doctor of Letters from California Graduate School of Theology, and Doctor of Laws from Central University in Seoul, South Korea.

==Associated organizations==
===Thomas Road Baptist Church===
In 1956, aged 22, Falwell founded the Thomas Road Baptist Church. Originally at 701 Thomas Road in Lynchburg, with 35 members, it became a megachurch. Also in 1956, Falwell began &quot;The Old-Time Gospel Hour&quot;, a nationally syndicated radio and television ministry. When Falwell died, his son Jonathan inherited his father&#x27;s ministry, and took over as the church&#x27;s senior pastor. The weekly program&#x27;s name was then changed to &quot;Thomas Road Live&quot;.

===Liberty Christian Academy===

During the 1950s and 1960s, Falwell spoke and campaigned against the civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. and the racial desegregation of public school systems by the federal government. Liberty Christian Academy (LCA, founded as Lynchburg Christian Academy) is a Christian school in Lynchburg that the &quot;Lynchburg News&quot; in 1966 called &quot;a private school for white students&quot;.

Falwell opened The Lynchburg Christian Academy in 1967 as a segregation academy and a ministry of Thomas Road Baptist Church.

The Liberty Christian Academy is recognized as an educational facility by the Commonwealth of Virginia through the Virginia State Board of Education, Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, and the Association of Christian Schools International.

===Liberty University===
In 1971, Falwell co-founded Liberty University with Elmer L. Towns. Liberty University offers over 350 accredited programs of study, with approximately 13,000 students on-campus and 90,000 online.

===Moral Majority===


During the 1980s, the Moral Majority became one of the largest political lobbies for evangelical Christians in the U.S. According to Falwell&#x27;s autobiography, the Moral Majority was promoted as &quot;pro-life, pro-traditional family, pro-moral, and pro-American&quot; and was credited with delivering two-thirds of the white evangelical vote to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election. According to Jimmy Carter, &quot;that autumn [1980] a group headed by Jerry Falwell purchased $10 million in commercials on southern radio and TV to brand me as a traitor to the South and no longer a Christian.&quot; As head of the Moral Majority, Falwell consistently supported Republican candidates and conservative politics. This led Billy Graham to criticize him for &quot;sermonizing&quot; about political issues that lacked a moral element. At the time of Falwell&#x27;s death, Graham said: &quot;We did not always agree on everything, but I knew him to be a man of God. His accomplishments went beyond most clergy of his generation.&quot;

===PTL===

In March 1987, Pentecostal televangelist Jim Bakker came under media scrutiny when it was revealed that he had a sexual encounter with, and allegedly raped, Jessica Hahn, and had paid for her silence. Bakker believed that fellow Pentecostal pastor Jimmy Swaggart was attempting to take over his ministry because he had initiated a church investigation into allegations of his sexual misconduct. To avoid the takeover, Bakker resigned on March 19 and appointed Falwell to succeed him as head of his PTL ministry, which included the PTL Satellite Network, television program &quot;The PTL Club&quot; and the Christian-themed amusement park Heritage USA.

Bakker believed Falwell would lead the ministry temporarily, until the scandal died down, but Falwell barred Bakker from returning to PTL on April 28, calling him &quot;probably the greatest scab and cancer on the face of Christianity in 2,000 years of church history&quot;. Later that summer, as donations to the ministry declined in the wake of Bakker&#x27;s scandal and resignation, Falwell raised $20 million to keep PTL solvent and delivered on a promise to ride the water slide at Heritage USA. Despite this, Falwell was unable to save the ministry from bankruptcy, and he resigned in October 1987.

==Social and political views==

===Families===
Falwell advocated beliefs and practices influenced by his version of biblical teachings.

===Tithing===
In 1989, he told Liberty University employees that membership in his church and tithing were mandatory.

===Vietnam War===
Falwell felt the Vietnam War was being fought with &quot;limited political objectives&quot; when it should have been an all-out war against the North. In general, Falwell held that the president &quot;as a minister of God&quot; has the right to use arms to &quot;bring wrath upon those who would do evil.&quot;

===Civil rights===
On his evangelist program &quot;The Old-Time Gospel Hour&quot; in the mid-1960s, Falwell regularly featured segregationist politicians like governors Lester Maddox and George Wallace. Of Martin Luther King Jr., he said: &quot;I do question the sincerity and nonviolent intentions of some civil rights leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mr. James Farmer, and others, who are known to have left-wing associations.&quot;

Of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, he said in 1958:

In 1977, Falwell supported Anita Bryant&#x27;s campaign, which its proponents called &quot;Save Our Children&quot;, to overturn an ordinance in Dade County, Florida, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. He supported a similar movement in California.

Twenty-eight years later, during a 2005 MSNBC television appearance, Falwell said he was not troubled by reports that the nominee for Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, John G. Roberts, had done volunteer legal work for gay rights activists in the case &quot;Romer v. Evans&quot;. Falwell told then-MSNBC host Tucker Carlson that if he were a lawyer, he too would argue for civil rights for LGBT people. &quot;I may not agree with the lifestyle, but that has nothing to do with the civil rights of that part of our constituency&quot;, said Falwell. When Carlson countered that conservatives &quot;are always arguing against &#x27;special rights&#x27; for gays&quot;, Falwell said equal access to housing and employment are basic rights, not special rights. &quot;Civil rights for all Americans, black, white, red, yellow, the rich, poor, young, old, gay, straight, et cetera, is not a liberal or conservative value. It&#x27;s an American value that I would think that we pretty much all agree on.&quot;

===Israel and Jews===
Falwell&#x27;s relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin was reported in the media in 1981. Falwell&#x27;s staunch pro-Israel stance, sometimes called &quot;Christian Zionism&quot;, drew the support of the Anti-Defamation League and its leader Abraham Foxman, but they condemned what they perceived intolerance toward Muslims in Falwell&#x27;s public statements. They also criticized him for saying that &quot;Jews can make more money accidentally than you can on purpose&quot;. In his book &quot;Listen, America!&quot;, Falwell called the Jewish people &quot;spiritually blind and desperately in need of their Messiah and Savior.&quot;

In the 1984 book &quot;Jerry Falwell and the Jews&quot;, Falwell is quoted saying: 

===Education===
Falwell repeatedly denounced certain teachings in public schools and secular education in general, calling them breeding grounds for atheism, secularism, and humanism, which he claimed to be in contradiction with Christian morality. He advocated that the U.S. change its public education system by implementing a school voucher system that would allow parents to send their children to either public or private schools. In his book &quot;America Can Be Saved&quot;, he wrote: &quot;I hope I live to see the day when, as in the early days of our country, we won&#x27;t have any public schools. The churches will have taken them over again and Christians will be running them.&quot;

Falwell supported President George W. Bush&#x27;s Faith Based Initiative, but had strong reservations about where the funding would go and the restrictions placed on churches: 

===Apartheid===
In the 1980s Falwell said sanctions against South Africa&#x27;s apartheid regime would result in what, he felt, would be a worse situation, such as a Soviet-backed revolution. He also urged his followers to buy up gold Krugerrands and push U.S. &quot;reinvestment&quot; in South Africa. In 1985 he drew the ire of many when he called Nobel Peace Prize winner and Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu a phony &quot;as far as representing the black people of South Africa&quot;.

===&quot;The Clinton Chronicles&quot;===
In 1994, Falwell promoted and distributed the video documentary &quot;The Clinton Chronicles: An Investigation into the Alleged Criminal Activities of Bill Clinton&quot;. The video purported to connect Bill Clinton to a murder conspiracy involving Vince Foster, James McDougall, Ron Brown, and a cocaine-smuggling operation. The theory was discredited, but the video sold more than 150,000 copies.

The film&#x27;s production costs were partly met by &quot;Citizens for Honest Government&quot;, to which Falwell paid $200,000 in 1994 and 1995. In 1995 Citizens for Honest Government interviewed Arkansas state troopers Roger Perry and Larry Patterson about the Foster murder conspiracy theory. Perry and Patterson also gave information about the allegations in the Paula Jones affair.

The infomercial for the 80-minute videotape included footage of Falwell interviewing a silhouetted journalist who claimed to be afraid for his life. The journalist accused Clinton of orchestrating the deaths of several reporters and personal confidants who had gotten too close to his supposed illegal activities. The silhouetted journalist was subsequently revealed to be Patrick Matrisciana, the producer of the video and president of Citizens for Honest Government. &quot;Obviously, I&#x27;m not an investigative reporter&quot;, Matrisciana admitted to investigative journalist Murray Waas. Later, Falwell seemed to back away from personally trusting the video. In an interview for the 2005 documentary &quot;The Hunting of the President&quot;, Falwell said, &quot;to this day I do not know the accuracy of the claims made in &quot;The Clinton Chronicles&quot;.&quot;

===Views on homosexuality===
Falwell condemned homosexuality as forbidden by the Bible. Homosexual rights groups called Falwell an &quot;agent of intolerance&quot; and &quot;the founder of the anti-gay industry&quot; for statements he had made and for campaigning against LGBT social movements. Falwell supported Anita Bryant&#x27;s 1977 &quot;Save Our Children&quot; campaign to overturn a Florida ordinance prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and a similar movement in California. In urging the ordinance&#x27;s repeal, Falwell told one crowd, &quot;Gay folks would just as soon kill you as look at you.&quot; When the LGBT-friendly Metropolitan Community Church was almost accepted into the World Council of Churches, Falwell called them &quot;brute beasts&quot; and said they were &quot;part of a vile and satanic system&quot; that &quot;will be utterly annihilated, and there will be a celebration in heaven&quot;. He later denied saying this. Falwell also regularly linked the AIDS epidemic to LGBT issues and said, &quot;AIDS is not just God&#x27;s punishment for homosexuals, it is God&#x27;s punishment for the society that tolerates homosexuals.&quot;

After comedian and actress Ellen DeGeneres came out as a lesbian, Falwell referred to her in a sermon as &quot;Ellen DeGenerate&quot;. DeGeneres responded, &quot;Really, he called me that? Ellen DeGenerate? I&#x27;ve been getting that since the fourth grade. I guess I&#x27;m happy I could give him work.&quot;

Falwell&#x27;s legacy regarding homosexuality is complicated by his support for LGBT civil rights and his attempts to reconcile with the LGBT community in later years. In October 1999, he hosted a meeting of 200 evangelicals with 200 gay people and lesbians at Thomas Road Baptist Church for an &quot;Anti-Violence Forum&quot;, during which he acknowledged that some evangelicals&#x27; comments about homosexuality qualified as hate speech that could incite violence. At the forum, Falwell told homosexuals in attendance, &quot;I don&#x27;t agree with your lifestyle, I will never agree with your lifestyle, but I love you&quot; and added, &quot;Anything that leaves the impression that we hate the sinner, we want to change that.&quot; He later told &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Frank Rich that &quot;admittedly, evangelicals have not exhibited an ability to build a bond of friendship to the gay and lesbian community. We&#x27;ve said &quot;go somewhere else, we don&#x27;t need you here [at] our churches.&quot;&quot;

===&quot;Teletubbies&quot;===

In February 1999, a &quot;National Liberty Journal&quot; article (the media attributed it to Falwell) claimed that Tinky Winky, a Teletubby, was intended as a homosexual role model. The &quot;NLJ&quot; is a Liberty University publication. A 1998 &quot;Salon&quot; article had referred to Tinky Winky&#x27;s status as a gay icon. In response, Steve Rice, spokesperson for Itsy Bitsy Entertainment, which licenses &quot;Teletubbies&quot;, a U.K. show for preschool children, in the U.S., said, &quot;I really find it absurd and kind of offensive.&quot; The &quot;NLJ&quot; wrote, &quot;he is purple—the gay pride color; and his antenna is shaped like a triangle—the gay-pride symbol&quot;. Tinky Winky also carries a magic bag, which the &quot;NLJ&quot; and &quot;Salon&quot; called a purse. Falwell added, &quot;role-modeling the gay lifestyle is damaging to the moral lives of children&quot;.

===September 11 attacks===
After the September 11 attacks in 2001, Falwell said on Pat Robertson&#x27;s &quot;The 700 Club&quot;, &quot;I really believe that the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People for the American Way, all of them who have tried to secularize America—I point the finger in their face and say &#x27;you helped this happen.&#x27;&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;falwell 9/11&quot;&gt;Falwell speaks about WTC disaster, Christian Broadcasting Network &lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion, LGBT organizations had angered God, thereby in part causing God to let the attacks happen. Falwell said the attacks were &quot;probably deserved&quot;, a statement Christopher Hitchens called treasonous. After heavy criticism, Falwell said that no one but the terrorists were to blame and &quot;If I left that impression with gays or lesbians or anyone else, I apologize.&quot; Falwell was later the object of some of his followers&#x27; outrage for retracting his statements about divine judgment on the U.S. and its causes, because they had heard in his preaching for many years that the U.S. must repent of its lack of devotion to God, immoral living, and timid support of Israel if it wanted divine protection and blessing.

===Labor unions===
Falwell said, &quot;Labor unions should study and read the Bible instead of asking for more money. When people get right with God, they are better workers.&quot;

===Relationship with American fundamentalism===
 In her extensive ethnographic study of Falwell, cultural anthropologist Susan Friend Harding noted that he adapted his preaching to win a broader, less extremist audience as he grew famous. This manifested itself in several ways. For example, though he was a teetotaler, Falwell no longer condemned &quot;worldly&quot; lifestyle choices such as dancing, drinking wine, and attending movie theaters; he softened his rhetoric predicting an apocalypse and God&#x27;s vengeful wrath; and he shifted from a belief in outright biblical patriarchy to a complementarian view of appropriate gender roles. He also began to aim his strongest criticism at &quot;secular humanists&quot;, pagans, and liberals rather than engaging in the racist, antisemitic, and anti-Catholic rhetoric common among Southern fundamentalist preachers but increasingly condemned as hate speech by the consensus of American society.

===Islam===
Falwell opposed Islam. According to &quot;Asharq Al-Awsat&quot;, a pan-Arab newspaper, he called Islam &quot;satanic&quot;. In a televised interview with &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Falwell called Muhammad a &quot;terrorist&quot;, adding, &quot;I concluded from reading Muslim and non-Muslim writers that Muhammad was a violent man, a man of war.&quot; Falwell later apologized to Muslims for what he had said about Muhammad and affirmed that he did not intend to offend &quot;honest and peace-loving&quot; Muslims, but he refused to remove his comments about Islam from his website. In response, Egyptian Christian intellectuals signed a statement condemning what Falwell had said about Muhammad being a terrorist.

==Legal issues==
Beginning in the 1970s, Falwell was involved in legal matters that occupied much of his time and increased his name recognition.

===SEC and bonds===
In 1972, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched an investigation of bonds issued by Falwell&#x27;s organizations. The SEC charged Falwell&#x27;s church with &quot;fraud and deceit&quot; in the issuance of $6.5 million in unsecured church bonds. The church won a 1973 federal court case prosecuted at the SEC&#x27;s behest. The court exonerated the church and ruled that while technical violations of law did occur, there was no proof the church intended any wrongdoing.

===Falwell versus &quot;Penthouse&quot;===
Falwell filed a $10 million lawsuit against &quot;Penthouse&quot; for publishing an article based on interviews he gave to freelance reporters, after failing to convince a federal court to enjoin the article&#x27;s publication. The suit was dismissed in federal district court in 1981 on the grounds that the article was not defamatory or an invasion of Falwell&#x27;s privacy (the Virginia courts had not recognized this privacy tort, which is recognized in other states).

===&quot;Hustler Magazine v. Falwell&quot;===
In 1983, Larry Flynt&#x27;s pornographic magazine &quot;Hustler&quot; ran a parody of a Campari ad featuring a mock &quot;interview&quot; with Falwell in which he admits that his &quot;first time&quot; was incest with his mother in an outhouse while drunk. Falwell sued for $45 million, alleging invasion of privacy, libel, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. A jury rejected the invasion of privacy and libel claims, holding that the parody could not have reasonably been taken to describe true events, but ruled in Falwell&#x27;s favor on the emotional distress claim and awarded damages of $200,000. This was upheld on appeal. Flynt then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which unanimously held that the First Amendment prevents public figures from recovering damages for emotional distress caused by parodies.

After Falwell&#x27;s death, Flynt said of Falwell:

My mother always told me that no matter how much you dislike a person, when you meet them face to face you will find characteristics about them that you like. Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even though I knew what he was selling and he knew what I was selling.

===Falwell versus Jerry Sloan===
In 1984, Falwell was ordered to pay gay rights activist and former Baptist Bible College classmate Jerry Sloan $5,000 after losing a court battle. In July 1984 during a televised debate in Sacramento, California, Falwell denied calling the gay-friendly Metropolitan Community Churches &quot;brute beasts&quot; and &quot;a vile and Satanic system&quot; that will &quot;one day be utterly annihilated and there will be a celebration in heaven&quot;.

When Sloan insisted he had a tape, Falwell promised $5,000 if he could produce it. Sloan did, Falwell refused to pay, and Sloan successfully sued. The money was donated to build Sacramento&#x27;s first LGBT community center, the Lambda Community Center, serving &quot;lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex&quot; communities. Falwell appealed the decision, with his attorney charging that the Jewish judge in the case was prejudiced. He lost again and was made to pay an additional $2,875 in sanctions and court fees.

=== Trademark infringement lawsuit against Christopher Lamparello ===

In &quot;Lamparello v. Falwell&quot;, a dispute over the ownership of the Internet domain &quot;fallwell.com&quot;, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed an earlier District Court decision, arguing that Christopher Lamparello, who owned the domain, &quot;clearly created his website intending only to provide a forum to criticize ideas, not to steal customers.&quot; Lamparello&#x27;s website described itself as not being connected to Jerry Falwell and is critical of Falwell&#x27;s views on homosexuality. On April 17, 2006, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the Appeals Court&#x27;s ruling that Lamparello&#x27;s usage of the domain was legal.

Before that, a different man had turned over &quot;jerryfalwell.com&quot; and &quot;jerryfallwell.com&quot; after Falwell threatened to sue for trademark infringement. Lawyers for Public Citizen Litigation Group&#x27;s Internet Free Speech project represented the domain name owners in both cases.

==Apocalyptic beliefs==
On July 31, 2006, CNN&#x27;s &quot;Paula Zahn Now&quot; program featured a segment on &quot;whether the crisis in the Middle East is actually a prelude to the end of the world&quot;. In an interview, Falwell said, &quot;I believe in the pre-millennial, pre-tribulational coming of Christ for all of his church, and to summarize that, your first poll, do you believe Jesus&#x27; coming the second time will be in the future, I would vote yes with the 59 percent and with Billy Graham and most evangelicals.&quot; Based on that and other statements, Falwell has been identified as a dispensationalist.

In 1999, Falwell said the Antichrist would probably arrive within a decade and &quot;of course he&#x27;ll be Jewish&quot;. After accusations of antisemitism, Falwell apologized and explained he was simply expressing the theological tenet that the Antichrist and Christ share many attributes.

==Failing health and death==
In early 2005, Falwell was hospitalized for two weeks with a viral infection, discharged, and re-hospitalized on May 30, 2005, in respiratory arrest. He was released from the hospital and returned to work. Later that year, a stent was implanted to correct a 70 percent blockage in his coronary arteries.
At about 10:45 a.m. on May 15, 2007, Falwell was found unconscious and without a pulse in his office after he missed a morning appointment, and was taken to Lynchburg General Hospital. &quot;I had breakfast with him, and he was fine at breakfast... He went to his office, I went to mine and they found him unresponsive&quot;, said Ron Godwin, the executive vice president of Liberty University. His condition was initially reported as &quot;gravely serious&quot;; CPR was administered unsuccessfully. At 2:10 p.m., during a live press conference, a doctor from the hospital confirmed that Falwell had died of &quot;cardiac arrhythmia, or sudden cardiac death&quot;. The hospital released a statement saying that he was pronounced dead at Lynchburg General Hospital at 12:40 p.m. He was 73. Falwell&#x27;s wife and sons were at the hospital at the time of the pronouncement.

Falwell&#x27;s funeral took place on May 22, 2007, at Thomas Road Baptist Church after he lay in repose both at the church and at Liberty University. Falwell&#x27;s burial service was private. He is interred at a spot on the Liberty University campus near the Carter Glass Mansion and Falwell&#x27;s office. B. R. Lakin, his mentor, is buried nearby. After Falwell&#x27;s death, his sons succeeded him at the two positions he held, Jerry Falwell Jr. as president of Liberty University and Jonathan Falwell as the senior pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church. Jerry Falwell Sr.&#x27;s daughter, Jeannie F. Savas, is a surgeon.

The last televised interview with Jerry Falwell Sr. was conducted by Christiane Amanpour for the CNN original series &quot;CNN Presents: God&#x27;s Warriors&quot; on May 8, 2007, a week before his death; in the interview he said that he had asked God for at least 20 more years in order to accomplish his vision for the university he founded. Falwell&#x27;s last televised sermon was his May 13, 2007, message on Mother&#x27;s Day.

==Legacy==
Views on Falwell&#x27;s legacy are mixed. Supporters praise his advancement of his socially conservative message. They tout his evangelist ministries and his stress on church planting and growth. Conversely, many of his detractors have accused him of hate speech and identified him as an &quot;agent of intolerance&quot;.

The antitheistic social commentator Christopher Hitchens called Falwell&#x27;s work &quot;Chaucerian fraud&quot; and &quot;faith-based fraud&quot;. Hitchens took special umbrage at Falwell&#x27;s alignment with &quot;the most thuggish and demented Israeli settlers&quot; and his declaration that 9/11 represented God&#x27;s judgment of America&#x27;s sinful behavior, deeming it &quot;extraordinary that not even such a scandalous career is enough to shake our dumb addiction to the &#x27;faith-based.&#x27;&quot; Hitchens also said that, despite his support for Israel, Falwell &quot;kept saying to his own crowd, yes, you have got to like the Jews, because they can make more money in 10 minutes than you can make in a lifetime&quot;. Appearing on CNN the day after Falwell&#x27;s death, Hitchens said, &quot;The empty life of this ugly little charlatan proves only one thing: that you can get away with the most extraordinary offenses to morality and to truth in this country if you will just get yourself called &#x27;reverend&#x27;.&quot;

At one point, prank callers, especially home activists, were an estimated 25 percent of Falwell&#x27;s total calls until the ministry disconnected the toll-free number in 1986. In the mid-1980s, Edward Johnson programmed his Atari home computer to make thousands of repeat phone calls to Falwell&#x27;s toll-free number as a response to Falwell&#x27;s having, Johnson felt, swindled large amounts of money from his followers, including Johnson&#x27;s mother. Southern Bell forced Johnson to stop after he had run up Falwell&#x27;s telephone bill by an estimated $500,000.

Jerry Falwell Jr. is a lawyer; he became president of Liberty University after his father&#x27;s death and was put on indefinite leave from that position on August 7, 2020, after posting an inappropriate photo with a young woman on social media. He resigned on August 24 amid further questions about his and his wife&#x27;s sexual and financial involvement with an associate. Falwell Jr. later said that the real reason his father began attending church as a teenager was that he had fallen in love with Macel, who played piano there and was engaged at the time, and that Falwell Sr. had used deception to convince her to break off the engagement.

Director Terrence Malick has an unproduced screenplay about the lives of Falwell and pianist-singer Jerry Lee Lewis.

<text>James Douglas Muir Leno ( ; born April 28, 1950) is an American television host, comedian, and writer. After doing stand-up comedy for years, he became the host of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; from 1992 until 2009 when Conan O&#x27;Brien took over as host. Beginning in September 2009, Leno started a primetime talk show, &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;, which aired weeknights at 10:00 p.m. ET, also on NBC. O&#x27;Brien turned down NBC&#x27;s offer to have Leno host a half hour monologue show before &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; to boost ratings amid reported viewership diminishing, which sparked the 2010 &quot;Tonight Show&quot; conflict that resulted in Leno&#x27;s returning to hosting the show on March 1, 2010. He hosted his last episode of his second tenure on February 6, 2014. That year, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame. From 2014 to 2022, he hosted &quot;Jay Leno&#x27;s Garage,&quot; and from 2021 to 2023, hosted the revival of &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;.

Leno writes a regular column in &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; showcasing his car collection and giving automotive advice. He also writes occasional &quot;Motormouth&quot; articles for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;.

==Early life==
Leno was born April 28, 1950, in New Rochelle, New York. His homemaker mother, Catherine (née Muir; 1911–1993), was born in Greenock, Scotland, and came to the United States at age 11. His father, Angelo (1910–1994), was an insurance salesman born in New York to immigrants from Flumeri, Campania, Italy. Leno grew up in Andover, Massachusetts, and graduated from Andover High School. He obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in speech therapy from Emerson College in Boston, where he started a comedy club in 1973. His older brother, Patrick (May 12, 1940 – October 6, 2002), was a Vietnam War veteran who became an attorney.

==Career==

===Early career===
Leno made his first appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on March 2, 1977, performing a comedy routine. During the 1970s, he had minor roles in several television series and films, first in the 1976 episode &quot;J.J. in Trouble&quot; of &quot;Good Times,&quot; and the same year in the pilot of &quot;Holmes &amp; Yo-Yo&quot;. After an uncredited appearance in the 1977 film &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot;, he played more prominent roles in 1978 in &quot;American Hot Wax&quot; and &quot;Silver Bears&quot;. His other film and television appearances from that period include &quot;Almost Heaven&quot; (1978), &quot;Going Nowhere&quot; (1979) on &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;, &quot;Americathon&quot; (1979), &quot;Polyester&quot; (1981), &quot;The Wild One&quot; (1981) on &quot;Alice&quot;, and both &quot;Feminine Mistake&quot; (1979) and &quot;Do the Carmine&quot; (1983) on &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;. His only starring film role was the 1989 direct-to-video &quot;Collision Course&quot;, with Pat Morita. He also appeared numerous times on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;.

He also appeared on three weeks of the short-lived NBC game show &quot;Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour&quot; in 1983 and 1984.

===&quot;The Tonight Show&quot;===

Starting in 1986, Leno was a regular substitute host for Johnny Carson on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. In 1992, he replaced Carson as host amid controversy with David Letterman, who had been hosting &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; since 1982 (which aired after &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;), and whom many—including Carson himself—expected to be Carson&#x27;s successor. The story of this turbulent transition became the basis of a book and a movie. Leno continued to perform as a stand-up comedian throughout his &quot;Tonight Show&quot; tenure. In 1988, he received a contract extension with NBC itself. The July 1995 episode of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; which featured an interview with Hugh Grant (who had been arrested for receiving oral sex in a public place from a prostitute) saw Leno rate higher than Letterman for the first time.

In 2004, Leno signed a contract extension with NBC to retain him as host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; until 2009. Later in 2004, Conan O&#x27;Brien signed a contract with NBC to become the show&#x27;s host in 2009, replacing Leno at that time.

During the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, Leno was accused of violating WGA guidelines by writing his own monologue for &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. NBC and Leno claimed there were private meetings with the WGA where a secret agreement was reached allowing this; the WGA denied such meetings. Leno answered questions in front of the Writers Guild of America, West trial committee in February 2009 and June 2009, and when the WGAW published its list of strikebreakers on August 11, 2009, Leno was not on it.

On April 23, 2009, Leno checked himself in to a hospital with an undisclosed illness. He was released the following day and returned to work on Monday, April 27. The two subsequently canceled &quot;Tonight Show&quot; episodes for April 23 and 24 were his first in 17 years as host. The illness was not initially disclosed, but Leno later told &quot;People&quot; magazine that it was for exhaustion.

====Michael Jackson trial====
During the 2005 trial of Michael Jackson over allegations of child molestation, Leno was one of a few celebrities who appeared as defense witnesses. In his testimony regarding a phone conversation with the accuser, Leno testified that he was not asked for any money and there did not appear to be any coaching — but the calls seemed unusual and scripted.
As a result, Leno was initially not allowed to tell jokes about Jackson or the case, which had been a fixture of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;″s opening monologue in particular. But he and his show&#x27;s writers used a legal loophole by having Leno briefly step aside while stand-in comedians took the stage and told jokes about the trial. These stand-ins included Roseanne Barr, Drew Carey, Brad Garrett and Dennis Miller. The gag order was challenged, and the court ruled that Leno could continue telling jokes about the trial as long as he did not discuss his testimony. Leno celebrated by devoting an entire monologue to Michael Jackson jokes.

===Succession by Conan O&#x27;Brien; &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;===

Because Leno&#x27;s show continued to lead all late-night programming in the Nielsen ratings, the pending expiration of his contract led to speculation about whether he would become a late-night host for another network when his commitment to NBC expired. He left &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on Friday, May 29, 2009, and Conan O&#x27;Brien took over on June 1, 2009.

On December 8, 2008, it was reported that Leno would remain on NBC and move to a new hour-long show at 10 p.m. Eastern Time (9 p.m. Central Time) five nights a week. It would follow a similar format to &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, be recorded in the same studio, and retain many of Leno&#x27;s most popular segments, while O&#x27;Brien continued to host &quot;The&quot; &quot;Tonight Show&quot;.

Leno&#x27;s new show, &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;, debuted on September 14, 2009. It was announced at the Television Critics Association summer press tour that it would feature one or two celebrities, occasional musical guests, and keep the popular &quot;Headlines&quot; segments, which would be near the end of the show. First guests included Jerry Seinfeld, Oprah Winfrey (via satellite), and a short sit-down with Kanye West discussing his controversy at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, which had occurred the night before.

===Timeslot conflict and return to &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;===

In their new roles, neither O&#x27;Brien nor Leno succeeded in delivering the viewing audiences the network anticipated. On January 7, 2010, multiple media outlets reported that beginning March 1, 2010, Leno would move from his 10 p.m. weeknight time slot to 11:35 p.m., due to a combination of pressure from local affiliates, whose newscasts were suffering, and both Leno&#x27;s and O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s poor ratings. Leno&#x27;s show would be shortened from an hour to 30 minutes. All NBC late night programming would also be preempted by the 2010 Winter Olympics between February 15 and 26, moving &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; to 12:05 a.m., the first post-midnight timeslot in its history. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s contract stipulated that NBC could move the show ahead to 12:05 a.m. without penalty (a clause included primarily to accommodate sports preemptions).

On January 10, NBC confirmed that it would move Leno out of primetime as of February 12 and move him to late-night as soon as possible. TMZ reported that O&#x27;Brien was given no advance notice of this change, and that NBC offered him two choices: an hour-long 12:05 a.m. time slot, or the option to leave the network. On January 12, O&#x27;Brien issued a press release that he would not continue with &quot;Tonight&quot; if it moved to a 12:05 a.m. time slot, saying, &quot;I believe that delaying &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting. &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; at 12:05 simply isn&#x27;t &quot;The Tonight Show.&quot;&quot;

On January 21, it was announced that NBC had struck a deal with O&#x27;Brien: He would leave &quot;The Tonight Show,&quot; receive a $33-million payout, and his staff of almost 200 would receive $12 million in the departure. His final episode aired on Friday, January 22, 2010. Leno returned as host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; following the 2010 Winter Olympics on March 1, 2010.

On July 1, 2010, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that total viewership for Leno&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; had dropped from 5 million to 4 million for the second quarter of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. Although it represented the show&#x27;s lowest second-quarter ratings since 1992, &quot;Tonight&quot; was still the most-watched late-night program, ahead of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot; (3.7 million) and &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; (3.3 million).

===Announcement of successor===
On April 3, 2013, NBC announced that Leno would leave &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in spring 2014, with Jimmy Fallon as his designated successor.

Leno&#x27;s final show as the host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; was on February 6, 2014, with guests Billy Crystal (who was the first guest on the first version of Leno&#x27;s show), musical guest Garth Brooks, and surprise guests Jack Black, Kim Kardashian, Jim Parsons, Sheryl Crow, Chris Paul, Carol Burnett and Oprah Winfrey.

===After &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;===

Leno has maintained an active schedule as a touring stand-up comedian, doing an average of 200 live performances a year in venues across the United States and Canada and at charity events and USO tours. He has also appeared on the &quot;Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon&quot; and &quot;Late Night with Seth Meyers,&quot; and was a guest on the finale of &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson.&quot; He appeared in a cameo role drilling and tormenting James Corden in a facetious boot camp for talk-show hosts on the premiere of &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot;. He declined an invitation to appear on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; despite speculation he would appear on the show&#x27;s finale in 2015, although he had appeared with Letterman along with Winfrey in a &quot;Late Show&quot; commercial airing during Super Bowl XLIV in 2010.

Leno hosted a one-hour &quot;Jay Leno&#x27;s Garage&quot; special on CNBC in 2014, and the show returned as a primetime series on the cable channel from 2015 until 2022. The series was canceled in January 2023 after seven seasons due to a decision by the channel to re-emphasize business-oriented programming.

Leno also had a recurring role in the Tim Allen comedy series &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; since season 5, playing a mechanic, Joe Leonard, in a store operated by Allen&#x27;s character, Mike Baxter.

Leno hosted the third revival of the game show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; for two seasons, from 2021 until 2023. The show was renewed for a third season but was cancelled in August 2023 after Leno refused to cross the picket line during the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike, after Fox First Run offered stations two other syndicated game shows to fill &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;&#x27;s timeslot during the strike, instead of reruns.

Leno also does voice acting, such as The Crimson Chin on &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; from 2001 to 2016 and Billy Beagle of &quot;Mickey and the Roadster Racers&quot;.

In 2019, Leno was a guest judge on season 14 of &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; where he pressed the Golden Buzzer for opera singer Emanne Beasha.

In 2023, Leno returned to NBC to appear as a celebrity guest judge on the two-episode season finale of &quot;Hot Wheels: Ultimate Challenge&quot;.

===Criticism===
Leno has faced criticism for his perceived role in the 2010 &quot;Tonight Show&quot; conflict. Critics have cited a 2004 &quot;Tonight Show&quot; clip where Leno said he would allow O&#x27;Brien to take over without incident. At the time, Leno said he did not want O&#x27;Brien to leave for a competing network, adding, &quot;I&#x27;ll be 59 when [the switch occurs]. That&#x27;s five years from now. There&#x27;s really only one person who could have done this into his 60s, and that was Johnny Carson; I think it&#x27;s fair to say I&#x27;m no Johnny Carson.&quot; Leno also described &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; as a dynasty, saying, &quot;You hold it and hand it off to the next person. And I don&#x27;t want to see all the fighting.&quot; At the end of the segment, he said, &quot;Conan, it&#x27;s yours! See you in five years, buddy!&quot;

Rosie O&#x27;Donnell was among O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s most vehement supporters, calling Leno a &quot;bully&quot; and his actions &quot;classless and kind of career-defining&quot;. Bill Zehme, the co-author of Leno&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Leading with My Chin&quot;, told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The thing Leno should do is walk, period. He&#x27;s got everything to lose in terms of public popularity by going back. People will look at him differently. He&#x27;ll be viewed as the bad guy.&quot;

In 2009, Leno received criticism for asking rapper Kanye West how his recently deceased mother, Donda West, would have felt about the incident at the 2009 VMAs, causing West to begin crying live on air.

Howard Stern has also been a critic of Leno before and following his &quot;Tonight Show&quot; timeslot-change announcement; Stern appeared on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; in 2006 and said he felt it was unlikely that Leno would ever willingly give up &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. During the conflict, Stern made many negative remarks about Leno as a guest on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

Jimmy Kimmel discussed his appearance on Leno&#x27;s show during an interview with Marc Maron for the latter&#x27;s podcast in 2012. Kimmel stated that he felt O&#x27;Brien was not given a proper chance, but that he was also motivated by his own history with Leno. According to Kimmel, Leno had some years prior been in serious discussions with ABC about the possibility of jumping ship from NBC. During this period, Leno initiated a friendship with Kimmel, wanting to ensure that they would be on good terms if the move was made. (Under that scenario, Leno would have taken Kimmel&#x27;s time slot and become his lead-in.) However, after Leno made the arrangement to remain at NBC, &quot;those conversations were gone&quot;, according to Kimmel. Realizing that Leno&#x27;s relationship with him had been artificial, Kimmel felt &quot;worked over&quot;, reasoning that Leno was using the ABC discussions as a bargaining tactic to try to get his old job back.

John Oliver has also criticized Leno for his coverage of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in an episode on public shaming.

Leno has also been criticized for the perceived change in the content of his monologues from his previous stand-up material. Actor and comedian Patton Oswalt was among the celebrities who openly voiced disappointment with Leno, saying, &quot;Comedians who don&#x27;t like Jay Leno now, and I&#x27;m one of them, we&#x27;re not like, &#x27;Jay Leno sucks&#x27;; it&#x27;s that we&#x27;re so hurt and disappointed that one of the best comedians of our generation ... willfully has shut the switch off.&quot;

In August 2020, Leno faced criticism for expressing support for Ellen DeGeneres despite a workplace investigation into toxic behavior and sexual misconduct and harassment claims against producers of &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;.

===Support for Leno===
NBC Sports chairman and former &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; producer Dick Ebersol spoke out against all who had criticized Leno, calling them &quot;chicken-hearted and gutless&quot;. Jeff Gaspin, then chairman of NBC Universal Television Entertainment, also defended Leno, saying, &quot;This has definitely crossed the line. Jay Leno is the consummate professional and one of the hardest-working people in television. It&#x27;s a shame that he&#x27;s being pulled into this.&quot; Fellow comedians Paul Reiser, Jerry Seinfeld and Jim Norton (a frequent contributor to &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;) also voiced support for Leno.

Responding to the mounting criticism, Leno said NBC had assured him that O&#x27;Brien was willing to accept the proposed arrangement and that they would not let either host out of his contract. He also said that the situation was &quot;all business&quot;, and that all of the decisions were made by NBC. He appeared on the January 28, 2010 episode of &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; in an attempt to repair some of the damage done to his public image.

==Influences==
Leno&#x27;s comedic influences include Johnny Carson, Robert Klein, Alan King, David Brenner, Mort Sahl, George Carlin, Don Rickles, Bob Newhart, and Rodney Dangerfield.

Dennis Miller and Jerry Seinfeld have credited Leno as their inspiration.

==Personal life==

Leno has been married to Mavis Leno since 1980. In 1993, during his first season as host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Leno&#x27;s mother died at the age of 82; and the next year, his father died at 84. Leno&#x27;s older brother, Patrick, a Vietnam veteran and graduate of Yale Law School, died of cancer in 2002 at the age of 62. In 2024, it was disclosed that Mavis Leno is suffering from an advanced form of dementia when the Los Angeles Superior Court granted Jay Leno conservatorship of the couple&#x27;s joint estate as she experiences periods of disorientation and at times does not know who her husband is or her own date of birth.

Leno is known for his prominent jaw, which has been described as mandibular prognathism. In the book &quot;Leading with My Chin&quot;, he says he was aware of surgery that could reset his mandible, but that he did not wish to endure a prolonged healing period with his jaws wired shut.

Leno is dyslexic. He claims to need only four or five hours of sleep each night. He does not consume alcohol, smoke, or gamble. He spends much of his free time visiting car collections and working in his private garage.

Leno has claimed that he has not spent any of the money he earned from &quot;The Tonight Show,&quot; but lives off his money from his stand-up routines. He reportedly earned $32 million in 2005. In 2014, he received an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Emerson College, where he also delivered the commencement speech. He also received an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Academy of Art University in 2021.
On November 12, 2022, Leno suffered &quot;serious burns&quot; to his face and hands when a vehicle at his Los Angeles garage burst into flames. As part of the treatment, he received a &quot;new ear&quot;. On January 17, 2023, he sustained multiple broken bones after falling off a motorcycle. On November 16, 2024, Leno had broken his right wrist, including tearing the fingernail off his right index finger, and sustained several bruises on his left side acquiring a periorbital hematoma after he accidentally tripped while walking to go have dinner at Dino&#x27;s Sports Lounge outside the Hampton Inn in Greensburg, Pennsylvania causing him to roll straight down a hill landing on the curb.

===Charity===
In 2001, he and his wife donated $100,000 to the Feminist Majority Foundation&#x27;s campaign to stop gender apartheid in Afghanistan, to educate the public regarding the plight of women in Afghanistan under Taliban rule. Mavis Leno is on the board of the Feminist Majority.

In 2009, he donated $100,000 to a scholarship fund at Salem State College (now Salem State University) in honor of Lennie Sogoloff, who gave Leno his start at his jazz club, Lennie&#x27;s-on-the-Turnpike.

In August 2012, Leno auctioned his Fiat 500, which was sold for $385,000 with all the proceeds going to a charity that helps wounded war veterans recover by providing them with temporary housing.

, Leno sponsored two scholarships at McPherson College.

===Love Ride===
Since 1985, Leno has been the Grand Marshal for the Love Ride, a motorcycle charity event which since its founding in 1984 has raised nearly $14 million for charities benefiting muscular dystrophy research, Autism Speaks, and in 2001, the September 11 attacks recovery.

===Vehicle collection===

Leno owns approximately 286 vehicles (169 cars and 117 motorcycles). He also has a website and a TV program called &quot;Jay Leno&#x27;s Garage&quot;, which contains video clips and photos of his car collection in detail, as well as other vehicles of interest to him. Leno&#x27;s garage manager is Bernard Juchli. Among his collection are two Doble steam cars, a sedan and a roadster that were owned by Howard Hughes, the fifth Duesenberg Model X known to survive, and one of nine remaining 1963 Chrysler Turbine Cars. The collection also includes three antique electric cars — the 1909 Baker Motor Vehicle is his wife Mavis&#x27;s favorite car.

He has a regular column in &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; which showcases his car collection and gives advice about various automotive topics, including restoration and unique models, such as his jet-powered motorcycle and solar-powered hybrid. Leno also writes occasional &quot;Motormouth&quot; articles for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, reviewing high-end sports cars and giving his humorous take on motoring matters.

Leno opened his garage to Team Bondi, the company that developed the 2011 video game &quot;L.A. Noire&quot;, which is set in Los Angeles in the late-1940s. Leno&#x27;s collection contains almost 100 cars from this period, and allowed the team to create their images as accurately as possible.

===Politics===

Hosting the 2014 Genesis Prize award ceremony in Jerusalem, Leno made jokes mocking then-President Barack Obama and then-Secretary of State John Kerry, accusing Obama of &quot;trying to break&quot; the U.S.&#x27;s relationship with Israel.

In a 2015 interview with &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, Leno said, &quot;I always considered Israel as not only the only democracy in the Middle East, I think it&#x27;s the purest, because every Israeli voter seems to have his own political party.&quot; He also added about Israel&#x27;s relations with other Middle Eastern countries: &quot;Israel is so efficient in defending itself and so good at it, that to the rest of the world it looks like bullying.&quot;

In a 2024 interview on &quot;Piers Morgan Uncensored&quot;, Leno said that he is &quot;not a fan&quot; of former President Donald Trump. Of President Joe Biden, Leno said: &quot;I like him. I think he&#x27;s a good guy. And, you know, the economy&#x27;s doing pretty good!&quot;

<text>Jeroboam II (, &quot;Yāroḇʿām&quot;; ; ), also referred to as Jeroboam son of Jehoash, was the successor of Jehoash (alternatively spelled Joash) and the thirteenth king of the ancient Kingdom of Israel, over which he ruled for forty-one years in the eighth century BC. His reign was contemporary with those of Amaziah and Uzziah, kings of Judah. Jeroboam is the fourth king of the House of Jehu and the longest-reigning king of the kingdom of Israel in Samaria.

He extended Israel to its former limits, from &quot;the entering of Hamath to the sea of the plain&quot;.

In 1910, G. A. Reisner found sixty-three inscribed potsherds while excavating the royal palace at Samaria, which were later dated to the reign of Jeroboam II and mention regnal years extending from the ninth to the 17th of his reign. These ostraca, while unremarkable in themselves, contain valuable information about the script, language, religion and administrative system of the period. During the excavations at Megiddo in 1904, an 8th century BCE Hebrew seal was found with the image of a roaring lion and the inscription &quot;Belonging to Shema, servant of Jeroboam.&quot; In 2020, a number of scholars claimed to have authenticated an unprovenanced bulla belonging to the same official, but others hold that it is a forgery based on the Megiddo seal.

Archaeological evidence confirms the biblical account of his reign as the most prosperous that the northern kingdom of Israel had yet known. By the late 8th century BC, the territory of Israel was the most densely settled in the entire Levant, with a population of about 350,000. This prosperity was built on trade in olive oil, wine, and possibly horses, with Egypt and especially Assyria providing the markets. According to the prophet Amos, the triumphs of the king had engendered a haughty spirit of boastful overconfidence at home. Oppression and exploitation of the poor by the mighty, luxury in palaces of unheard-of splendor, and a craving for amusement were some of the internal fruits of these external triumphs. Archaeologist Israel Finkelstein has argued that many of the stories of King Solomon&#x27;s rule over a large, prosperous kingdom were inspired by memories or records of the reign of Jeroboam II. For example, Finkelstein claimed that a list of districts in 1 Kings 4 supposedly under Solomonic rule actually matches the geographic boundaries of the Kingdom of Israel in the time of Jeroboam II. Thomas Römer has argued that Jeroboam I may not have existed and that Deuteronomistic redactors transferred the reign of Jeroboam II to Jeroboam I, although Lester L. Grabbe finds this theory unlikely.

Under Jeroboam II, the God of Israel was worshiped at Dan and Beth-el and at other old Israelite shrines, through actual images, such as the golden calf. These services at Dan and Beth-el, at Gilgal and Beer-sheba, were of a nature to arouse the indignation of the prophets, and the foreign cults, both numerous and degrading, contributed still further to arousing of the prophetic spirit. Jeroboam&#x27;s reign was the period of the prophets Hosea, Joel, Amos and Jonah, all of whom condemned the materialism and selfishness of the Israelite elite of their day: &quot;Woe unto those who lie upon beds of ivory ... eat lambs from the flock and calves ... [and] sing idle songs ...&quot; The Book of Kings condemns Jeroboam for doing &quot;evil in the eyes of the Lord&quot;, meaning both the oppression of the poor and his continuing support of the cult centres of Dan and Bethel, in opposition to the temple in Jerusalem. He was allowed to reign for 41 years because he protected the prophet Amos.

===Earthquake in Israel c. 760 BC===
A major earthquake had occurred in Israel c. 760 BC, which may have been during the time of Jeroboam II, towards the end of his rule. This earthquake is mentioned in the Book of Amos as having occurred during the rule of &quot;Jeroboam son of Jehoash&quot;.

Geologists believe they have found evidence of this big earthquake in sites throughout Israel and Jordan. Archeologists Yigael Yadin and Israel Finkelstein dated the earthquake level at Tel Hazor to 760 BC based on stratigraphic analysis of the destruction debris. Similarly, David Ussishkin arrived at the same date based on the &quot;sudden destruction&quot; level at Lachish.

According to Steven A. Austin, the magnitude of this earthquake may have been at least 7.8, but more likely as high as 8.2. &quot;This magnitude 8 event of 750 B.C. appears to be the largest yet documented on the Dead Sea transform fault zone during the last four millennia.&quot;

The epicenter of this earthquake may have been 200–300 km north of present-day Israel.

Multiple biblical references exist to this earthquake in the Book of Amos, and also in Zechariah 14:5.

Recent excavations by Aren Maeir in ancient Gath have revealed evidence of a major earthquake.
&quot;Based on the tight stratigraphic context, this can be dated to the mid-8th cent. BCE&quot; ...
==In the Bible==
His name occurs in the Old Testament only in 2 Kings; 1 Chronicles; Book of Hosea; and Book of Amos. In all other passages it is Jeroboam I, the son of Nebat that is meant.

<doc id="16509" wikidata="Q7226" url="?curid=16509" title="Joan of Arc">
<text>Joan of Arc ( ; ;  – 30 May 1431) is a patron saint of France, honored as a defender of the French nation for her role in the siege of Orléans and her insistence on the coronation of Charles VII of France during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Claiming to be acting under divine guidance, she became a military leader who transcended gender roles and gained recognition as a savior of France.

Joan was born to a propertied peasant family at Domrémy in northeast France. In 1428, she requested to be taken to Charles VII, later testifying that she was guided by visions from the archangel Michael, Saint Margaret, and Saint Catherine to help him save France from English domination. Convinced of her devotion and purity, Charles sent Joan, who was about seventeen years old, to the siege of Orléans as part of a relief army. She arrived at the city in April 1429, wielding her banner and bringing hope to the demoralized French army. Nine days after her arrival, the English abandoned the siege. Joan encouraged the French to aggressively pursue the English during the Loire Campaign, which culminated in another decisive victory at Patay, opening the way for the French army to advance on Reims unopposed, where Charles was crowned as the King of France with Joan at his side. These victories boosted French morale, paving the way for their final triumph in the Hundred Years&#x27; War several decades later.

After Charles&#x27;s coronation, Joan participated in the unsuccessful siege of Paris in September 1429 and the failed siege of La Charité in November. Her role in these defeats reduced the court&#x27;s faith in her. In early 1430, Joan organized a company of volunteers to relieve Compiègne, which had been besieged by the Burgundians—French allies of the English. She was captured by Burgundian troops on 23 May. After trying unsuccessfully to escape, she was handed to the English in November. She was put on trial by Bishop Pierre Cauchon on accusations of heresy, which included blaspheming by wearing men&#x27;s clothes, acting upon visions that were demonic, and refusing to submit her words and deeds to the judgment of the church. She was declared guilty and burned at the stake on 30 May 1431, aged about nineteen.

In 1456, an inquisitorial court reinvestigated Joan&#x27;s trial and overturned the verdict, declaring that it was tainted by deceit and procedural errors. Joan has been described as an obedient daughter of the Roman Catholic Church, an early feminist, and a symbol of freedom and independence. She is popularly revered as a martyr. After the French Revolution, she became a national symbol of France. In 1920, Joan of Arc was canonized by Pope Benedict XV and, two years later, was declared one of the patron saints of France. She is portrayed in numerous cultural works, including literature, music, paintings, sculptures, and theater.

==Name==
Joan of Arc&#x27;s name was written in a variety of ways. There is no standard spelling of her name before the sixteenth century; her last name was usually written as &quot;Darc&quot; without an apostrophe, but there are variants such as &quot;Tarc&quot;, &quot;Dart&quot; or &quot;Day&quot;. Her father&#x27;s name was written as &quot;Tart&quot; at her trial. She was called &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Ay de Domrémy&quot; in Charles VII&#x27;s 1429 letter granting her a coat of arms. Joan may never have heard herself called &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot;. The first written record of her being called by this name is in 1455, 24 years after her death.

She was not taught to read and write in her childhood, and so dictated her letters. She may later have learned to sign her name, as some of her letters are signed, and she may even have learned to read. Joan referred to herself in the letters as (&quot;Joan the Maiden&quot;) or as (&quot;the Maiden&quot;), emphasizing her virginity, and she signed &quot;Jehanne&quot;. In the sixteenth century, she became known as the &quot;Maid of Orleans&quot;.

==Birth and historical background==
Joan of Arc was born in Domrémy, a small village in the Meuse valley now in the Vosges department in the north-east of France. Her date of birth is unknown and her statements about her age were vague. Her parents were Jacques d&#x27;Arc and Isabelle Romée. Joan had three brothers and a sister. Her father was a peasant farmer with about of land, and he supplemented the family income as a village official, collecting taxes and heading the local watch.

She was born during the Hundred Years&#x27; War between England and France, which had begun in 1337 over the status of English territories in France and English claims to the French throne. Nearly all the fighting had taken place in France, devastating its economy. At the time of Joan&#x27;s birth, France was divided politically. The French king Charles VI had recurring bouts of mental illness and was often unable to rule; his brother Louis, Duke of Orléans, and his cousin John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy, quarreled over the regency of France. In 1407, the Duke of Burgundy ordered the assassination of the Duke of Orléans, precipitating a civil war. Charles of Orléans succeeded his father as duke at the age of thirteen and was placed in the custody of Bernard, Count of Armagnac; his supporters became known as &quot;Armagnacs&quot;, while supporters of the Duke of Burgundy became known as &quot;Burgundians&quot;. The future French king Charles VII had assumed the title of Dauphin (heir to the throne) after the deaths of his four older brothers and was associated with the Armagnacs.

Henry V of England exploited France&#x27;s internal divisions when he invaded in 1415. The Burgundians took Paris in 1418. In 1419, the Dauphin offered a truce to negotiate peace with the Duke of Burgundy, but the duke was assassinated by Charles&#x27;s Armagnac partisans during the negotiations. The new duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good, allied with the English. Charles VI accused the Dauphin of murdering the Duke of Burgundy and declared him unfit to inherit the French throne. During a period of illness, Charles&#x27;s wife Isabeau of Bavaria stood in for him and signed the Treaty of Troyes, which gave their daughter Catherine of Valois in marriage to Henry V, granted the succession of the French throne to their heirs, and effectively disinherited the Dauphin. This caused rumors that the Dauphin was not King Charles VI&#x27;s son, but the offspring of an adulterous affair between Isabeau and the murdered duke of Orléans. In 1422, Henry V and Charles VI died within two months of each other; the 9-month-old Henry VI of England was the nominal heir of the Anglo-French dual monarchy as agreed in the treaty, but the Dauphin also claimed the French throne.

==Early life==
In her youth, Joan did household chores, spun wool, helped her father in the fields and looked after their animals. Her mother provided Joan&#x27;s religious education. Much of Domrémy lay in the Duchy of Bar, whose precise feudal status was unclear; though surrounded by pro-Burgundian lands, its people were loyal to the Armagnac cause. By 1419, the war had affected the area, and in 1425, Domrémy was attacked and cattle were stolen. This led to a sentiment among villagers that the English must be expelled from France to achieve peace. Joan had her first vision after this raid.

Joan later testified that when she was thirteen, , a figure she identified as Saint Michael surrounded by angels appeared to her in the garden. After this vision, she said she wept because she wanted them to take her with them. Throughout her life, she had visions of St. Michael, a patron saint of the Domrémy area who was seen as a defender of France. She stated that she had these visions frequently and that she often had them when the church bells were rung. Her visions also included St. Margaret and St. Catherine; although Joan never specified, they were probably Margaret of Antioch and Catherine of Alexandria—those most known in the area. Both were known as virgin saints who strove against powerful enemies, were tortured and martyred for their beliefs, and preserved their virtue to the death. Joan testified that she swore a vow of virginity to these voices. When a young man from her village alleged that she had broken a promise of marriage, Joan stated that she had made him no promises, and his case was dismissed by an ecclesiastical court.

During Joan&#x27;s youth, a prophecy circulating in the French countryside, based on the visions of , promised an armed virgin would come forth to save France. Another prophecy, attributed to Merlin, stated that a virgin carrying a banner would put an end to France&#x27;s suffering. Joan implied she was this promised maiden, reminding the people around her that there was a saying that France would be destroyed by a woman but would be restored by a virgin. In May 1428, she asked her uncle to take her to the nearby town of Vaucouleurs, where she petitioned the garrison commander, Robert de Baudricourt, for an armed escort to the Armagnac court at Chinon. Baudricourt harshly refused and sent her home. In July, Domrémy was raided by Burgundian forces which set fire to the town, destroyed the crops, and forced Joan, her family and the other townspeople to flee. She returned to Vaucouleurs in January 1429. Her petition was refused again, but by this time she had gained the support of two of Baudricourt&#x27;s soldiers, Jean de Metz and Bertrand de Poulengy. Meanwhile, she was summoned to Nancy under safe conduct by Charles II, Duke of Lorraine, who had heard about Joan during her stay at Vaucouleurs. The duke was ill and thought she might have supernatural powers that could cure him. She offered no cures, but reprimanded him for living with his mistress.

Henry V&#x27;s brothers, John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford, and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, had continued the English conquest of France. Most of northern France, Paris, and parts of southwestern France were under Anglo-Burgundian control. The Burgundians controlled Reims, the traditional site for the coronation of French kings; Charles had not yet been crowned, and doing so at Reims would help legitimize his claim to the throne. In July 1428, the English had started to surround Orléans and had nearly isolated it from the rest of Charles&#x27;s territory by capturing many of the smaller bridge towns on the Loire River. Orléans was strategically important as the last obstacle to an assault on the remainder of Charles&#x27;s territory. According to Joan&#x27;s later testimony, it was around this period that her visions told her to leave Domrémy to help the Dauphin Charles. 

Baudricourt agreed to a third meeting with Joan in February 1429, around the time the English captured an Armagnac relief convoy at the Battle of the Herrings during the Siege of Orléans. Their conversations, along with Metz and Poulengy&#x27;s support, convinced Baudricourt to allow her to go to Chinon for an audience with the Dauphin. Joan traveled with an escort of six soldiers. Before leaving, Joan put on men&#x27;s clothes, which were provided by her escorts and the people of Vaucouleurs. She continued to wear men&#x27;s clothes for the remainder of her life.

==Chinon==
Charles VII met Joan for the first time at the Royal Court in Chinon in late February or early March 1429, when she was seventeen and he was twenty-six. She told him that she had come to raise the siege of Orléans and to lead him to Reims for his coronation. They had a private exchange that made a strong impression on Charles; Jean Pasquerel, Joan&#x27;s confessor, later testified that Joan told him she had reassured the Dauphin that he was Charles VI&#x27;s son and the legitimate king.

Charles and his council needed more assurance, sending Joan to Poitiers to be examined by a council of theologians, who declared that she was a good person and a good Catholic. They did not render a decision on the source of Joan&#x27;s inspiration, but agreed that sending her to Orléans could be useful to the king and would test whether her inspiration was of divine origin. Joan was then sent to Tours to be physically examined by women directed by Charles&#x27;s mother-in-law Yolande of Aragon, who verified her virginity. This was to establish if she could indeed be the prophesied virgin savior of France, to show the purity of her devotion, and to ensure she had not consorted with the Devil.

The Dauphin, reassured by the results of these tests, commissioned plate armor for her. She designed her own banner and had a sword brought to her from under the altar in the church at Sainte-Catherine-de-Fierbois. Around this time she began calling herself &quot;Joan the Maiden&quot;, emphasizing her virginity as a sign of her mission.

Before Joan&#x27;s arrival at Chinon, the Armagnac strategic situation was bad but not hopeless. The Armagnac forces were prepared to endure a prolonged siege at Orléans, the Burgundians had recently withdrawn from the siege due to disagreements about territory, and the English were debating whether to continue. Nonetheless, after almost a century of war, the Armagnacs were demoralized. Once Joan joined the Dauphin&#x27;s cause, her personality began to raise their spirits, inspiring devotion and the hope of divine assistance. Her belief in the divine origin of her mission turned the longstanding Anglo-French conflict over inheritance into a religious war. Before beginning the journey to Orléans, Joan dictated a letter to the Duke of Bedford warning him that she was sent by God to drive him out of France.

==Military campaigns==

===Orléans===
In the last week of April 1429, Joan set out from Blois as part of an army carrying supplies for the relief of Orléans. She arrived there on 29 April and met the commander Jean de Dunois, the Bastard of Orléans. Orléans was not completely cut off, and Dunois got her into the city, where she was greeted enthusiastically. Joan was initially treated as a figurehead to raise morale, flying her banner on the battlefield. She was not given any formal command or included in military councils but quickly gained the support of the Armagnac troops. She always seemed to be present where the fighting was most intense, she frequently stayed with the front ranks, and she gave them a sense she was fighting for their salvation. Armagnac commanders would sometimes accept the advice she gave them, such as deciding what position to attack, when to continue an assault, and how to place artillery.

On 4 May, the Armagnacs went on the offensive, attacking the outlying (fortress of Saint Loup). Once Joan learned of the attack, she rode out with her banner to the site of the battle, a mile east of Orléans. She arrived as the Armagnac soldiers were retreating after a failed assault. Her appearance rallied the soldiers, who attacked again and took the fortress. On 5 May, no combat occurred since it was Ascension Thursday, a feast day. She dictated another letter to the English warning them to leave France and had it tied to a bolt, which was fired by a crossbowman.

The Armagnacs resumed their offensive on 6 May, capturing Saint-Jean-le-Blanc, which the English had deserted. The Armagnac commanders wanted to stop, but Joan encouraged them to launch an assault on &quot;les Augustins&quot;, an English fortress built around a monastery. After its capture, the Armagnac commanders wanted to consolidate their gains, but Joan again argued for continuing the offensive. On the morning of 7 May, the Armagnacs attacked the main English stronghold, &quot;les Tourelles&quot;. Joan was wounded by an arrow between the neck and shoulder while holding her banner in the trench on the south bank of the river but later returned to encourage the final assault that took the fortress. The English retreated from Orléans on 8 May, ending the siege.

At Chinon, Joan had declared that she was sent by God. At Poitiers, when she was asked to show a sign demonstrating this claim, she replied that it would be given if she were brought to Orléans. The lifting of the siege was interpreted by many people to be that sign. Prominent clergy such as , Archbishop of Embrun, and the theologian Jean Gerson wrote treatises in support of Joan after this victory. In contrast, the English saw the ability of this peasant girl to defeat their armies as proof she was possessed by the devil.

===Loire Campaign===
After the success at Orléans, Joan insisted that the Armagnac forces should advance promptly toward Reims to crown the Dauphin. Charles allowed her to accompany the army under the command of John II, Duke of Alençon, who collaboratively worked with Joan and regularly heeded her advice. Before advancing toward Reims, the Armagnacs needed to recapture the bridge towns along the Loire: Jargeau, Meung-sur-Loire, and Beaugency. This would clear the way for Charles and his entourage, who would have to cross the Loire near Orléans to get from Chinon to Reims.

The campaign to clear the Loire towns began on 11 June when the Armagnac forces led by Alençon and Joan arrived at Jargeau and forced the English to withdraw inside the town&#x27;s walls. Joan sent a message to the English to surrender; they refused and she advocated for a direct assault on the walls the next day. By the end of the day, the town was taken. The Armagnac took few prisoners and many of the English who surrendered were killed. During this campaign, Joan continued to serve in the thick of battle. She began scaling a siege ladder with her banner in hand but before she could climb the wall, she was struck by a stone which split her helmet.

Alençon and Joan&#x27;s army advanced on Meung-sur-Loire. On 15 June, they took control of the town&#x27;s bridge, and the English garrison withdrew to a castle on the Loire&#x27;s north bank. Most of the army continued on the south bank of the Loire to besiege the castle at Beaugency.

Meanwhile, the English army from Paris under the command of Sir John Fastolf had linked up with the garrison in Meung and traveled along the north bank of the Loire to relieve Beaugency. Unaware of this, the English garrison at Beaugency surrendered on 18 June. The main English army retreated toward Paris; Joan urged the Armagnacs to pursue them, and the two armies clashed at the Battle of Patay later that day. The English had prepared their forces to ambush an Armagnac attack with hidden archers, but the Armagnac vanguard detected and scattered them. A rout ensued that decimated the English army. Fastolf escaped with a small band of soldiers, but many of the English leaders were captured. Joan arrived at the battlefield too late to participate in the decisive action, but her encouragement to pursue the English had made the victory possible.

===Coronation and siege of Paris===

After the destruction of the English army at Patay, some Armagnac leaders argued for an invasion of English-held Normandy, but Joan remained insistent that Charles must be crowned. The Dauphin agreed, and the army left Gien on 29 June to march on Reims. The advance was nearly unopposed. The Burgundian-held town of Auxerre surrendered on 3 July after three days of negotiations, and other towns in the army&#x27;s path returned to Armagnac allegiance without resistance. Troyes, which had a small garrison of English and Burgundian troops, was the only one to resist. After four days of negotiation, Joan ordered the soldiers to fill the city&#x27;s moat with wood and directed the placement of artillery. Fearing an assault, Troyes negotiated a surrender.

Reims opened its gates on 16 July 1429. Charles, Joan, and the army entered in the evening, and Charles&#x27;s consecration took place the following morning. Joan was given a place of honor at the ceremony, and announced that God&#x27;s will had been fulfilled.

After the consecration, the royal court negotiated a truce of fifteen days with the Duke of Burgundy, who promised he would try to arrange the transfer of Paris to the Armagnacs while continuing negotiations for a definitive peace. At the end of the truce, Burgundy reneged on his promise. Joan and the Duke of Alençon favored a quick march on Paris, but divisions in Charles&#x27;s court and continued peace negotiations with Burgundy led to a slow advance.

As the Armagnac army approached Paris, many of the towns along the way surrendered without a fight. On 15 August, the English forces under the Duke of Bedford confronted the Armagnacs near Montépilloy in a fortified position that the Armagnac commanders thought was too strong to assault. Joan rode out in front of the English positions to try to provoke them to attack. They refused, resulting in a standoff. The English retreated the following day. The Armagnacs continued their advance and launched an assault on Paris on 8 September. During the fighting, Joan was wounded in the leg by a crossbow bolt. She remained in a trench beneath the city walls until she was rescued after nightfall. The Armagnacs had suffered 1,500 casualties. The following morning, Charles ordered an end to the assault. Joan was displeased and argued that the attack should be continued. She and Alençon had made fresh plans to attack Paris, but Charles dismantled a bridge approaching Paris that was necessary for the attack and the Armagnac army had to retreat.

After the defeat at Paris, Joan&#x27;s role in the French court diminished. Her aggressive independence did not agree with the court&#x27;s emphasis on finding a diplomatic solution with Burgundy, and her role in the defeat at Paris reduced the court&#x27;s faith in her. Scholars at the University of Paris argued that she failed to take Paris because her inspiration was not divine. In September, Charles disbanded the army, and Joan was not allowed to work with the Duke of Alençon again.

===Campaign against Perrinet Gressart===

In October, Joan was sent as part of a force to attack the territory of , a mercenary who had served the Burgundians and English. The army besieged Saint-Pierre-le-Moûtier, which fell after Joan encouraged a direct assault on 4 November. The army then tried unsuccessfully to take La-Charité-sur-Loire in November and December and had to abandon their artillery during the retreat. This defeat further diminished Joan&#x27;s reputation.

Joan returned to court at the end of December, where she learned that she and her family had been ennobled by Charles as a reward for her services to him and the kingdom. Before the September attack on Paris, Charles had negotiated a four-month truce with the Burgundians, which was extended until Easter 1430. During this truce, the French court had no need for Joan.

===Siege of Compiègne and capture===

The Duke of Burgundy began to reclaim towns which had been ceded to him by treaty but had not submitted. Compiègne was one such town of many in areas which the Armagnacs had recaptured over the previous few months. Joan set out with a company of volunteers at the end of March 1430 to relieve the town, which was under siege. This expedition did not have the explicit permission of Charles, who was still observing the truce. Some writers suggest that Joan&#x27;s expedition to Compiègne without documented permission from the court was a desperate and treasonable action, but others have argued that she could not have launched the expedition without the financial support of the court.

In April, Joan arrived at Melun, which had expelled its Burgundian garrison. As Joan advanced, her force grew as other commanders joined her. Joan&#x27;s troops advanced to Lagny-sur-Marne and defeated an Anglo-Burgundian force commanded by the mercenary Franquet d&#x27;Arras who was captured. Typically, he would have been ransomed or exchanged by the capturing force, but Joan allowed the townspeople to execute him after a trial.
Joan reached Compiègne on 14 May. After defensive forays against the Burgundian besiegers, she was forced to disband the majority of the army because it had become too difficult for the surrounding countryside to support. Joan and about 400 of her remaining soldiers entered the town.

On 23 May 1430, Joan accompanied an Armagnac force which sortied from Compiègne to attack the Burgundian camp at Margny, northeast of the town. The attack failed, and Joan was captured; she agreed to surrender to a pro-Burgundian nobleman named Lyonnel de Wandomme, a member of Jean de Luxembourg&#x27;s contingent. who quickly moved her to his castle at Beaulieu-les-Fontaines, near Noyes. After her first attempt to escape, she was transferred to Beaurevoir Castle. She made another escape attempt while there, jumping from a window of a tower and landing in a dry moat; she was injured but survived. In November, she was moved to the Burgundian town of Arras.

The English and Burgundians rejoiced that Joan had been removed as a military threat. The English negotiated with their Burgundian allies to pay Joan&#x27;s ransom and transfer her to their custody. Bishop Pierre Cauchon of Beauvais, a partisan supporter of the Duke of Burgundy and the English crown, played a prominent part in these negotiations, which were completed in November. The final agreement called for the English to pay 10,000 livres tournois to obtain her from Luxembourg. After the English paid the ransom, they moved Joan to Rouen, their main headquarters in France. There is no evidence that Charles tried to save Joan once she was transferred to the English.

==Trials and execution==
=== Trial ===


Joan was put on trial for heresy in Rouen on 9 January 1431. She was accused of having blasphemed by wearing men&#x27;s clothes, of acting upon visions that were demonic, and of refusing to submit her words and deeds to the church because she claimed she would be judged by God alone. Joan&#x27;s captors downplayed the secular aspects of her trial by submitting her judgment to an ecclesiastical court, but the trial was politically motivated. Joan testified that her visions had instructed her to defeat the English and crown Charles, and her success was argued to be evidence she was acting on behalf of God. If unchallenged, her testimony would invalidate the English claim to the rule of France and undermine the University of Paris, which supported the dual monarchy ruled by an English king.

The verdict was a foregone conclusion. Joan&#x27;s guilt could be used to compromise Charles&#x27;s claims to legitimacy by showing that he had been consecrated by the act of a heretic. Cauchon served as the ordinary judge of the trial. The English subsidized the trial, including payments to Cauchon and Jean Le Maître, who represented the Inquisitor of France. All but 8 of the 131 clergy who participated in the trial were French and two thirds were associated with the University of Paris, but most were pro-Burgundian and pro-English.
Cauchon attempted to follow correct inquisitorial procedure, but the trial had many irregularities. Joan should have been in the hands of the church during the trial and guarded by women, but instead was imprisoned by the English and guarded by male soldiers under the command of the Duke of Bedford. Contrary to canon law, Cauchon had not established Joan&#x27;s infamy before proceeding with the trial. Joan was not read the charges against her until well after her interrogations began. The procedures were below inquisitorial standards, subjecting Joan to lengthy interrogations without legal counsel. One of the trial clerics stepped down because he felt the testimony was coerced and its intention was to entrap Joan; another challenged Cauchon&#x27;s right to judge the trial and was jailed. There is evidence that the trial records were falsified.

During the trial, Joan showed great control. She induced her interrogators to ask questions sequentially rather than simultaneously, refer back to their records when appropriate, and end the sessions when she requested. Witnesses at the trial were impressed by her prudence when answering questions. For example, in one exchange she was asked if she knew she was in God&#x27;s grace. The question was meant as a scholarly trap, as church doctrine held that nobody could be certain of being in God&#x27;s grace. If she answered positively, she would have been charged with heresy; if negatively, she would have confessed her own guilt. Joan avoided the trap by stating that if she was not in God&#x27;s grace, she hoped God would put her there, and if she was in God&#x27;s grace then she hoped she would remain so. One of the court notaries at her trial later testified that the interrogators were stunned by her answer. To convince her to submit, Joan was shown the instruments of torture. When she refused to be intimidated, Cauchon met with about a dozen assessors (clerical jurors) to vote on whether she should be tortured. The majority decided against it.

In early May, Cauchon asked the University of Paris to deliberate on twelve articles summarizing the accusation of heresy. The university approved the charges. On 23 May, Joan was formally admonished by the court. The next day, she was taken out to the churchyard of the abbey of Saint-Ouen for public condemnation. As Cauchon began to read Joan&#x27;s sentence, she agreed to submit. She was presented with an abjuration document, which included an agreement that she would not bear arms or wear men&#x27;s clothing. It was read aloud to her, and she signed it.

===Execution===
Public heresy was a capital crime, in which an unrepentant or relapsed heretic could be given over to the judgment of the secular courts and punished by death. Having signed the abjuration, Joan was no longer an unrepentant heretic but could be executed if convicted of relapsing into heresy.

As part of her abjuration, Joan was required to renounce wearing men&#x27;s clothes. She exchanged her clothes for a woman&#x27;s dress and allowed her head to be shaved. She was returned to her cell and kept in chains instead of being transferred to an ecclesiastical prison.
Witnesses at the rehabilitation trial stated that Joan was subjected to mistreatment and rape attempts, including one by an English noble, and that guards placed men&#x27;s clothes in her cell, forcing her to wear them. Cauchon was notified that Joan had resumed wearing male clothing. He sent clerics to admonish her to remain in submission, but the English prevented them from visiting her.

On 28 May, Cauchon went to Joan&#x27;s cell, along with several other clerics. According to the trial record, Joan said that she had gone back to wearing men&#x27;s clothes because it was more fitting that she dress like a man while being held with male guards, and that the judges had broken their promise to let her go to mass and to release her from her chains. She stated that if they fulfilled their promises and placed her in a decent prison, she would be obedient. When Cauchon asked about her visions, Joan stated that the voices had blamed her for abjuring out of fear, and that she would not deny them again. As Joan&#x27;s abjuration had required her to deny her visions, this was sufficient to convict her of relapsing into heresy and to condemn her to death. The next day, forty-two assessors were summoned to decide Joan&#x27;s fate. Two recommended that she be abandoned to the secular courts immediately; the rest recommended that the abjuration be read to her again and explained. In the end, they voted unanimously that Joan was a relapsed heretic and should be abandoned to the secular power, the English, for punishment.

At about the age of nineteen, Joan was executed on 30 May 1431. In the morning, she was allowed to receive the sacraments despite the court process requiring they be denied to heretics. She was then taken to Rouen&#x27;s Vieux-Marché (Old Marketplace), where she was publicly read her sentence of condemnation. At this point, she should have been turned over to the appropriate authority, the bailiff of Rouen, for secular sentencing, but instead was delivered directly to the English and tied to a tall plastered pillar for execution by burning. She asked to view a cross as she died, and was given one by an English soldier made from a stick, which she kissed and placed next to her chest. A processional crucifix was fetched from the church of Saint-Saveur. She embraced it before her hands were bound, and it was held before her eyes during her execution. After her death, her remains were thrown into the Seine River.

===Aftermath and rehabilitation trial===

The military situation was not changed by Joan&#x27;s execution. Her triumphs had raised Armagnac morale, and the English were not able to regain momentum. Charles remained king of France, despite a rival coronation held for the ten-year-old Henry VI of England at Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris in 1431. In 1435, the Burgundians signed the Treaty of Arras, abandoning their alliance with England. Twenty-two years after Joan&#x27;s death, the war ended with a French victory at the Battle of Castillon in 1453, and the English were expelled from all of France except Calais.

Joan&#x27;s execution created a political liability for Charles, implying that his consecration as the king of France had been achieved through the actions of a heretic. On 15 February 1450, a few months after he regained Rouen, Charles ordered Guillaume Bouillé, a theologian and former rector of the University of Paris, to open an inquest. In a brief investigation, Bouillé interviewed seven witnesses of Joan&#x27;s trial and concluded that the judgment of Joan as a heretic was arbitrary. She had been a prisoner of war treated as a political prisoner, and was put to death without basis.
Bouillé&#x27;s report could not overturn the verdict but it opened the way for the later retrial.

In 1452, a second inquest into Joan&#x27;s trial was opened by Cardinal Guillaume d&#x27;Estouteville, papal legate and relative of Charles, and Jean Bréhal, the recently appointed Inquisitor of France, who interviewed about 20 witnesses. The inquest was guided by 27 articles describing how Joan&#x27;s trial had been biased. Immediately after the inquest, d&#x27;Estouteville went to Orléans on 9 June and granted an indulgence to those who participated in the ceremonies in Joan&#x27;s honor on 8 May commemorating the lifting of the siege.

For the next two years d&#x27;Estouteville and Bréhal worked on the case. Bréhal forwarded a petition from Joan&#x27;s mother, Isabelle, and Joan&#x27;s two brothers Jean and Pierre, to Pope Nicholas V in 1454. Bréhal submitted a summary of his findings to theologians and lawyers in France and Italy, as well as a professor at the University of Vienna, most of whom gave opinions favorable to Joan. After Nicholas V died in early 1455, the new pope Callixtus III gave permission for a rehabilitation trial, and appointed three commissioners to oversee the process: Jean Juvénal des Ursins, archbishop of Reims; Guillaume Chartier, bishop of Paris; and Richard Olivier de Longueil, bishop of Coutances. They chose Bréhal as Inquisitor.

The rehabilitation trial began on 7 November 1455 at Notre Dame Cathedral when Joan&#x27;s mother publicly delivered a formal request for her daughter&#x27;s rehabilitation, and ended on 7 July 1456 at Rouen Cathedral, having heard from about 115 witnesses. The court found that the original trial was unjust and deceitful; Joan&#x27;s abjuration, execution and their consequences were nullified. In his summary of the trial, Bréhal suggested that Cauchon and the assessors who supported him might be guilty of malice and heresy. To emphasize the court&#x27;s decision, a copy of the Articles of Accusation was formally torn up. The court ordered that a cross should be erected on the site of Joan&#x27;s execution.

==Visions==
Joan&#x27;s visions played an important role in her condemnation, and her admission that she had returned to heeding them led to her execution. Theologians of the era believed that visions could have a supernatural source. The assessors at her trial focused on determining the specific source of Joan&#x27;s visions, using an ecclesiastical form of (discernment of spirits). Because she was accused of heresy, they sought to show that her visions were false. The rehabilitation trial nullified Joan&#x27;s sentence, but did not declare her visions authentic. In 1894, Pope Leo XIII pronounced that Joan&#x27;s mission was divinely inspired.

Modern scholars have discussed possible neurological and psychiatric causes for her visions. Her visions have been described as hallucinations arising from epilepsy or a temporal lobe tuberculoma. Others have implicated ergot poisoning, schizophrenia, delusional disorder, or creative psychopathy induced by her early childhood rearing. One of the Promoters of the Faith at her 1903 canonization trial argued that her visions may have been manifestations of hysteria. Other scholars argue that Joan created some of the visions&#x27; specific details in response to the demands of the interrogators at her trial.

Many of these explanations have been challenged; the trial records designed to demonstrate that Joan was guilty of heresy are unlikely to provide the objective descriptions of symptoms needed to support a medical diagnosis.

Joan&#x27;s firm belief in the divinity of her visions strengthened her confidence, enabled her to trust herself, and gave her hope during her capture and trial.

==Clothing==

Joan&#x27;s cross-dressing was the topic of five of the articles of accusation against her during the trial. In the view of the assessors, it was the emblem of her heresy. Her final condemnation began when she was found to have resumed wearing men&#x27;s clothes, which was taken as a sign that she had relapsed into heresy.
From the time of her journey to Chinon to her abjuration, Joan usually wore men&#x27;s clothes and cropped her hair in a male fashion. When she left Vaucouleurs to see the Dauphin in Chinon, Joan was said to have worn a black doublet, a black tunic, and a short black cap. By the time she was captured, she had acquired more elaborate outfits. At her trial, she was accused of wearing breeches, a mantle, a coat of mail, a doublet, hose joined to the doublet with twenty laces, tight boots, spurs, a breastplate, buskins, a sword, a dagger, and a lance. She was also described as wearing furs, a golden surcoat over her armor, and sumptuous riding habits made of precious cloth.

During the trial proceedings, Joan is not recorded as giving a practical reason why she cross-dressed. She stated that it was her own choice to wear men&#x27;s clothes, and that she did so not at the request of men but by the command of God and his angels. She stated she would return to wearing women&#x27;s clothes when she fulfilled her calling.

Although Joan&#x27;s cross-dressing was used to justify her execution, the church&#x27;s position on it was not clear. In general, it was seen as a sin, but there was no agreement about its severity. Thomas Aquinas stated that a woman may wear a man&#x27;s clothes to hide herself from enemies or if no other clothes were available, and Joan did both, wearing them in enemy territory to get to Chinon, and in her prison cell after her abjuration when her dress was taken from her. Soon after the siege of Orléans was lifted, Jean Gerson said that Joan&#x27;s male clothes and haircut were appropriate for her calling, as she was a warrior and men&#x27;s clothes were more practical.

Cross-dressing may have helped her maintain her virginity by deterring rape: witnesses at the nullification trial stated that Joan gave this as one of the reasons for returning to men&#x27;s clothes after she had abjured wearing them. However, scholars have stated that when she was imprisoned, wearing men&#x27;s clothes would only have been a minor deterrent to rape as she was shackled most of the time. For most of her active life, Joan did not cross-dress to hide her gender. Rather, it may have functioned to emphasize her unique identity as , a model of virtue that transcends gender roles and inspires people.

==Legacy==
Joan is one of the most studied people of the Middle Ages, partly because her two trials provided a wealth of documents. Her image, changing over time, has included being the savior of France, an obedient daughter of the Roman Catholic Church, an early feminist, and a symbol of freedom and independence.

===Military leader and symbol of France===

Joan&#x27;s reputation as a military leader who helped drive the English from France began to form before her death. Just after Charles&#x27;s coronation, Christine de Pizan wrote the poem &quot;Ditié de Jehanne D&#x27;Arc&quot;, celebrating Joan as a supporter of Charles sent by Divine Providence and reflecting French optimism after the triumph at Orléans. As early as 1429, Orléans began holding a celebration in honor of the raising of the siege on 8 May.

After Joan&#x27;s execution, her role in the Orléans victory encouraged popular support for her rehabilitation. Joan became a central part of the annual celebration, and by 1435, a play, (Mystery of the Siege of Orléans), portrayed her as the vehicle of the divine will that liberated Orléans. The Orléans festival celebrating Joan continues in modern times.

Less than a decade after her rehabilitation trial, Pope Pius II wrote a brief biography describing her as the maid who saved the kingdom of France. Louis XII commissioned a full-length biography of her .

Joan&#x27;s early legacy was closely associated with the divine right of the monarchy to rule France. During the French Revolution, her reputation came into question because of her association with the monarchy and religion, and the festival in her honor held at Orléans was suspended in 1793. In 1803, Napoleon Bonaparte authorized its renewal and the creation of a new statue of Joan at Orléans, stating, &quot;The illustrious Joan ... proved that there is no miracle which French genius cannot accomplish when national independence is threatened.&quot;

Since then, she has become a prominent symbol as the defender of the French nation. After the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, Joan became a rallying point for a new crusade to reclaim Lorraine, the province of her birth. The Third Republic held a patriotic civic holiday in her honor on 8 May to celebrate her victory at Orléans. During World War I, her image was used to inspire victory. In World War II, all sides of the French cause appealed to her legacy: she was a symbol for Philippe Pétain in Vichy France, a model for Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s leadership of the Free French, and an example for the Communist resistance. More recently, her association with the monarchy and national liberation has made her a symbol for the French far right, including the monarchist movement Action Française and the National Front Party. Joan&#x27;s image has been used by the entire spectrum of French politics, and she is an important reference in political dialogue about French identity and unity.

===Saint and heroic woman===

Joan is a saint in the Roman Catholic Church. She was viewed as a religious figure in Orléans after the siege was lifted, and an annual panegyric was pronounced there on her behalf until the 1800s. In 1849, the Bishop of Orlėans Félix Dupanloup delivered an oration that attracted international attention and in 1869, petitioned Rome to begin beatification proceedings. She was beatified by Pope Pius X in 1909, and canonized on 16 May 1920 by Pope Benedict XV. Her feast day is 30 May, the anniversary of her execution. In an apostolic letter, Pope Pius XI declared Joan one of the patron saints of France on 2 March 1922.

Joan was canonized as a Virgin, not as a Christian martyr because she had been put to death by a canonically constituted court, which executed her not for her faith in Christ, but for her private revelation. Nevertheless, she has been popularly venerated as a martyr since her death: one who suffered for her modesty and purity, her country, and the strength of her convictions. Joan is also remembered as a visionary in the Church of England with a commemoration on 30 May. She is revered in the pantheon of the Cao Dai religion.

During her lifetime, Joan was already being compared to biblical women heroes, such as Esther, Judith, and Deborah. Her claim of virginity, which signified her virtue and sincerity, was upheld by women of status from both the Armagnac and Burgundian-English sides of the Hundred Years&#x27; War: Yolande of Aragon, Charles&#x27;s mother-in-law, and Anne of Burgundy, Duchess of Bedford.

Joan has been described as a model of an autonomous woman who challenged traditions of masculinity and femininity to be heard as an individual in a patriarchal culture—setting her own course by heeding the voices of her visions. She fulfilled the traditionally male role of a military leader, while maintaining her status as a valiant woman. Merging qualities associated with both genders, Joan has inspired numerous artistic and cultural works for many centuries. In the nineteenth century, hundreds of works of art about her—including biographies, plays, and musical scores—were created in France, and her story became popular as an artistic subject in Europe and North America. By the 1960s, she was the topic of thousands of books. Her legacy has become global, and inspires novels, plays, poems, operas, films, paintings, children&#x27;s books, advertising, computer games, comics and popular culture across the world.

<text>Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted (; 22 February 1879 – 17 December 1947) was a Danish physical chemist who is best known for developing the Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory; he developed the theory at the same time as (but independently of) Martin Lowry.

== Biography ==
Brønsted was born in Varde, Denmark on 22 February 1879. His mother died shortly after his birth, and his father died when Brønsted was 14 years old; he then moved to Copenhagen with his older sister and his stepmother. In 1897, Brønsted began his studies as a chemical engineer at the Polytechnic Institute in
Copenhagen. After his first degree, Brønsted changed fields and received his magister degree in chemistry in 1902 from the University of Copenhagen. In 1905, he became an assistant at the Chemical Institute and obtained his doctoral degree in 1908. In the same year, Brønsted became a professor of physical and inorganic chemistry at the University of Copenhagen.

In 1929, Brønsted was a visiting professor at Yale University. His research gained worldwide recognition, resulting in four Nobel Prize nominations, a gold H. C. Ørsted Medal and being appointed as a fellow of the Royal Society and a member of the National Academy of Sciences.

Brønsted married Charlotte Warberg, whom he met during his first degree. The couple had four children. In World War II, Brønsted&#x27;s opposition to the Nazis led to his election to the Danish parliament in 1947, but he was too ill to take his seat and died shortly after the election.

== Research ==
Early in his career, Brønsted studied chemical thermodynamics and later studied electrolyte solutions and carried out an extensive series of solubility measurements. These measurements led him to establish general laws which were later confirmed when the Debye–Hückel theory was proposed.

Brønsted is best known for his work on reaction kinetics, in particular acid–base reactions. In 1923, he recognized that acid–base reactions involved the transfer of a proton, from the acid (proton donor) to the base (proton acceptor). Almost simultaneously and independently, the British chemist Martin Lowry arrived at the same conclusion, thus the name Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory. Also in 1923, Gilbert N. Lewis proposed an electronic theory of acid–base reactions, but both theories remain commonly used.

Later in his career, Brønsted kept studying reaction kinetics, with a special focus on reactions taking place in non-aqueous solutions. He also developed some work about the effect of molecular size on the thermodynamical properties of hydrocarbons, polymers and colloids. He also worked with the Nobel prize winner George de Hevesy on isotope separation by fractional distillation.

<doc id="16511" wikidata="Q903451" url="?curid=16511" title="Janus kinase">
<text>Janus kinase (JAK) is a family of intracellular, non-receptor tyrosine kinases that transduce cytokine-mediated signals via the JAK-STAT pathway. They were initially named &quot;just another kinase&quot; 1 and 2 (since they were just two of many discoveries in a PCR-based screen of kinases), but were ultimately published as &quot;Janus kinase&quot;. The name is taken from the two-faced Roman god of beginnings, endings and duality, Janus, because the JAKs possess two near-identical phosphate-transferring domains. One domain exhibits the kinase activity, while the other negatively regulates the kinase activity of the first.

==Family==

The four JAK family members are:
* Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)
* Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)
* Janus kinase 3 (JAK3)
* Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2)

Transgenic mice that do not express JAK1 have defective responses to some cytokines, such as interferon-gamma. JAK1 and JAK2 are involved in type II interferon (interferon-gamma) signalling, whereas JAK1 and TYK2 are involved in type I interferon signalling. Mice that do not express TYK2 have defective natural killer cell function.

==Functions==
Since members of the type I and type II cytokine receptor families possess no catalytic kinase activity, they rely on the JAK family of tyrosine kinases to phosphorylate and activate downstream proteins involved in their signal transduction pathways. The receptors exist as paired polypeptides, thus exhibiting two intracellular signal-transducing domains.

JAKs associate with a proline-rich region in each intracellular domain that is adjacent to the cell membrane and called a box1/box2 region. After the receptor associates with its respective cytokine/ligand, it goes through a conformational change, bringing the two JAKs close enough to phosphorylate each other. The JAK autophosphorylation induces a conformational change within itself, enabling it to transduce the intracellular signal by further phosphorylating and activating transcription factors called STATs (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription, or Signal Transduction And Transcription). The activated STATs dissociate from the receptor and form dimers before translocating to the cell nucleus, where they regulate transcription of selected genes.

Some examples of the molecules that use the JAK/STAT signaling pathway are colony-stimulating factor, prolactin, growth hormone, and many cytokines. Janus Kinases have also been reported to have a role in the maintenance of X chromosome inactivation.

===Clinical significance===
JAK inhibitors are used for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and rheumatoid arthritis. They are also being studied in psoriasis, polycythemia vera, alopecia, essential thrombocythemia, ulcerative colitis, myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis and vitiligo. Examples are tofacitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib and filgotinib.

In 2014 researchers discovered that oral JAK inhibitors, when administered orally, could restore hair growth in some subjects and that applied to the skin, effectively promoted hair growth.

==Structure==

JAKs range from 120-140 kDa in size and have seven defined regions of homology called Janus homology domains 1 to 7 (JH1-7). JH1 is the kinase domain important for the enzymatic activity of the JAK and contains typical features of a tyrosine kinase such as conserved tyrosines necessary for JAK activation (e.g., Y1038/Y1039 in JAK1, Y1007/Y1008 in JAK2, Y980/Y981 in JAK3, and Y1054/Y1055 in Tyk2). Phosphorylation of these dual tyrosines leads to the conformational changes in the JAK protein to facilitate binding of substrate. JH2 is a pseudokinase domain, a domain structurally similar to a tyrosine kinase and essential for a normal kinase activity, yet lacks enzymatic activity. This domain may be involved in regulating the activity of JH1, and was likely a duplication of the JH1 domain which has undergone mutation post-duplication. The JH3-JH4 domains of JAKs share homology with Src-homology-2 (SH2) domains. The amino terminal (NH2) end (JH4-JH7) of Jaks is called a FERM domain (short for band 4.1, ezrin, radixin and moesin); this domain is also found in the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) family and is involved in association of JAKs with cytokine receptors and/or other kinases.

<doc id="16514" wikidata="Q6701" url="?curid=16514" title="Jacob Grimm">
<text>Jacob Ludwig Karl Grimm (4 January 1785 – 20 September 1863), also known as Ludwig Karl, was a German author, linguist, philologist, jurist, and folklorist. He formulated Grimm&#x27;s law of linguistics, and was the co-author of the &quot;Deutsches Wörterbuch&quot;, the author of &quot;Deutsche Mythologie&quot;, and the editor of &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot;. He was the older brother of Wilhelm Grimm; together, they were the literary duo known as the Brothers Grimm.

==Life and books==

Jacob Grimm was born 4 January 1785, in Hanau in Hesse-Kassel. His father, Philipp Grimm, was a lawyer who died while Jacob was a child, and his mother Dorothea was left with a very small income. Her sister was the lady of the chamber to the Landgravine of Hesse, and she helped to support and educate the family. Jacob was sent to the public school at Kassel in 1798 with his younger brother Wilhelm.

In 1802, he went to the University of Marburg where he studied law, a profession for which he had been intended by his father. His brother joined him at Marburg a year later, having just recovered from a severe illness, and likewise began the study of law.
He then later with his brother, Wilhelm Grimm, wrote Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales.

===Meeting von Savigny===
Jacob Grimm became inspired by the lectures of Friedrich Carl von Savigny, a noted expert of Roman law; Wilhelm Grimm, in the preface to the &quot;Deutsche Grammatik&quot; (German Grammar), credits Savigny with giving the brothers an awareness of science. Savigny&#x27;s lectures also awakened in Jacob a love for historical and antiquarian investigation, which underlies all his work. It was in Savigny&#x27;s library that Grimm first saw Bodmer&#x27;s edition of the Middle High German minnesingers and other early texts, which gave him a desire to study their language.

At the beginning of 1805, he was invited by Savigny to Paris, to help him in his literary work. There Grimm strengthened his taste for the literature of the Middle Ages. Towards the close of the year, he returned to Kassel, where his mother and brother had settled after Wilhelm finished his studies. The following year, Jacob obtained a position in the war office with a small salary of 100 thalers. He complained that he had to exchange his stylish Paris suit for a stiff uniform and pigtail, but the role gave him spare time for the pursuit of his studies.

===Librarianship===
In 1808, soon after the death of his mother, he was appointed superintendent of the private library of Jérôme Bonaparte, King of Westphalia, into which Hesse-Kassel had been incorporated by Napoleon. Grimm was appointed an auditor to the state council, while retaining his superintendent post. His salary rose to 4000 francs and his official duties were nominal. In 1813, after the expulsion of Bonaparte and the reinstatement of an elector, Grimm was appointed Secretary of Legation accompanying the Hessian minister to the headquarters of the allied army. In 1814, he was sent to Paris to demand restitution of books taken by the French, and he attended the Congress of Vienna as Secretary of Legation in 1814–1815. Upon his return from Vienna, he was sent to Paris again to secure book restitutions. Meanwhile, Wilhelm had obtained a job at the Kassel library, and Jacob was made second librarian under Volkel in 1816. Upon the death of Volkel in 1828, the brothers both expected promotion, and they were dissatisfied when the role of the first librarian was given to Rommel, the keeper of the archives. Consequently, they moved the following year to the University of Göttingen, where Jacob was appointed professor and librarian, and Wilhelm under-librarian. Jacob Grimm lectured on legal antiquities, historical grammar, literary history, and diplomatics, explained Old German poems, and commented on the &quot;Germania&quot; of Tacitus.

===Later work===

Grimm joined other academics, known as the Göttingen Seven, who signed a protest against the King of Hanover&#x27;s abrogation of the liberal constitution which had been established some years before. As a result, he was dismissed from his professorship and banished from the Kingdom of Hanover in 1837. He returned to Kassel with his brother, who had also signed the protest. They remained there until 1840 when they accepted King Frederick William IV&#x27;s invitation to move to the University of Berlin, where they both received professorships and were elected members of the Academy of Sciences. Grimm was not under any obligation to lecture, and seldom did so; he spent his time working with his brother on their dictionary project. During their time in Kassel, he regularly attended the meetings of the academy and read papers on varied subjects, including Karl Konrad Friedrich Wilhelm Lachmann, Friedrich Schiller, old age, and the origin of language. He described his impressions of Italian and Scandinavian travel, interspersing more general observations with linguistic details. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1857.

Grimm died in Berlin at the age of 78, working until the very end of his life. He describes his own work at the end of his autobiography:
Nearly all my labours have been devoted, either directly or indirectly, to the investigation of our earlier language, poetry and laws. These studies may have appeared to many, and may still appear, useless; to me they have always seemed a noble and earnest task, definitely and inseparably connected with our common fatherland, and calculated to foster the love of it. My principle has always been in these investigations to under-value nothing, but to utilize the small for the illustration of the great, the popular tradition for the elucidation of the written monuments.
==Linguistic work==

===&quot;History of the German Language&quot;===

Grimm&#x27;s &quot;Geschichte der deutschen Sprache&quot; (History of the German Language) explores German history hidden in the words of the German language and is the oldest linguistic history of the Teutonic tribes. He collected scattered words and allusions from classical literature and tried to determine the relationship between the German language and those of the Getae, Thracians, Scythians, and other nations whose languages were known only through Greek and Latin authors. Grimm&#x27;s results were later greatly modified by a wider range of available comparisons and improved methods of investigation. Many questions that he raised remain obscure due to the lack of surviving records of the languages, but his book&#x27;s influence was profound.

===&quot;German Grammar&quot;===
Grimm&#x27;s famous &quot;Deutsche Grammatik&quot; (German Grammar) was the outcome of his purely philological work. He drew on the work of past generations, from the humanists onwards, consulting an enormous collection of materials in the form of text editions, dictionaries, and grammars, mostly uncritical and unreliable. Some work had been done in the way of comparison and determination of general laws, and the concept of a comparative Germanic grammar had been grasped by the Englishman George Hickes by the beginning of the 18th century, in his &quot;Thesaurus&quot;. Ten Kate in the Netherlands had made valuable contributions to the history and comparison of Germanic languages. Grimm himself did not initially intend to include all the languages in his &quot;Grammar&quot;, but he soon found that Old High German postulated Gothic, and that the later stages of German could not be understood without the help of other West Germanic varieties including English, and that the literature of Scandinavia could not be ignored. The first edition of the first part of the &quot;Grammar&quot;, which appeared in 1819, treated the inflections of all these languages, and included a general introduction in which he vindicated the importance of a historical study of the German language against the quasi-philosophical methods then in vogue.

In 1822 the book appeared in a second edition (really a new work, for, as Grimm himself says in the preface, he had to &quot;mow the first crop down to the ground&quot;). The considerable gap between the two stages of Grimm&#x27;s development of these editions is shown by the fact that the second volume addresses phonology in 600 pages – more than half the volume. Grimm had concluded that all philology must be based on rigorous adherence to the laws of sound change, and he subsequently never deviated from this principle. This gave to all his investigations a consistency and force of conviction that had been lacking in the study of philology before his day.

His advances have been attributed mainly to the influence of his contemporary Rasmus Christian Rask. Rask was two years younger than Grimm, but the Icelandic paradigms in Grimm&#x27;s first editions are based entirely on Rask&#x27;s grammar; in his second edition, he relied almost entirely on Rask for Old English. His debt to Rask is shown by comparing his treatment of Old English in the two editions. For example, in the first edition he declines &quot;dæg, dæges&quot;, plural &quot;dægas&quot;, without having observed the law of vowel-change pointed out by Rask. (The correct plural is &quot;dagas.&quot;) The appearance of Rask&#x27;s Old English grammar was probably the primary impetus for Grimm to recast his work from the beginning. Rask was also the first to clearly formulate the laws of sound-correspondence in the different languages, especially in the vowels (previously ignored by etymologists).

The &quot;Grammar&quot; was continued in three volumes, treating principally derivation, composition and syntax, the last of which was unfinished. Grimm then began a third edition, of which only one part, comprising the vowels, appeared in 1840, his time being afterwards taken up mainly by the dictionary. The &quot;Grammar&quot; is noted for its comprehensiveness, method and fullness of detail, with all his points illustrated by an almost exhaustive mass of material, and it has served as a model for all succeeding investigators. Diez&#x27;s grammar of the Romance languages is founded entirely on Grimm&#x27;s methods, which have had a profound influence on the wider study of the Indo-European languages in general.

===Grimm&#x27;s law===

Jacob is recognized for enunciating Grimm&#x27;s law, the Germanic Sound Shift, which was first observed by the Danish philologist Rasmus Christian Rask. Grimm&#x27;s law, also known as the &quot;Rask-Grimm Rule&quot; or the First Germanic Sound Shift, was the first law in linguistics concerning a non-trivial sound change. It was a turning point in the development of linguistics, enabling the introduction of a rigorous methodology to historic linguistic research. It concerns the correspondence of consonants between the ancestral Proto-Indo-European language and its Germanic descendants, Low Saxon and High German, and was first fully stated by Grimm in the second edition of the first part of his &quot;Grammar&quot;. The correspondence of single consonants had been more or less clearly recognized by several of his predecessors, including Friedrich von Schlegel, Rasmus Christian Rask and Johan Ihre, the last having established a considerable number of &quot;literarum permutationes&quot;, such as b for f, with the examples &quot;bœra&quot; = &quot;ferre&quot; (&quot;to bear&quot;), &quot;befwer&quot; = &quot;fibra&quot; (&quot;fiber&quot;). Rask, in his essay on the origin of the Icelandic language, gave the same comparisons, with a few additions and corrections, and even the same examples in most cases. As Grimm in the preface to his first edition expressly mentioned Rask&#x27;s essay, there is every probability that it inspired his own investigations. But there is a wide difference between the isolated permutations described by his predecessors and his own comprehensive generalizations. The extension of the law to High German in any case is entirely Grimm&#x27;s work.

The idea that Grimm wished to deprive Rask of his priority claims is based on the fact that he does not expressly mention Rask&#x27;s results in his second edition, but it was always his plan to refrain from all controversy or reference to the works of others. In his first edition, he calls attention to Rask&#x27;s essay and praises it ungrudgingly. Nevertheless, a certain bitterness of feeling afterwards sprang up between Grimm and Rask, after Rask refused to consider the value of Grimm&#x27;s views when they clashed with his own.

===&quot;German Dictionary&quot;===
Grimm&#x27;s monumental dictionary of the German Language, the &quot;Deutsches Wörterbuch&quot;, was started in 1838 and first published in 1854. The Brothers anticipated it would take 10 years and encompass some six to seven volumes. However, it was undertaken on so large a scale as to make it impossible for them to complete it. The dictionary, as far as it was worked on by Grimm himself, has been described as a collection of disconnected antiquarian essays of high value. It was finally finished by subsequent scholars in 1961 and supplemented in 1971. At 33 volumes at some 330,000 headwords, it remains a standard work of reference to the present day. A current project at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities is underway to update the &quot;Deutsches Wörterbuch&quot; to modern academic standards. Volumes A–F were planned for completion in 2012 by the Language Research Centre at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities and the University of Göttingen.

==Literary work==
The first work Jacob Grimm published, &quot;Über den altdeutschen Meistergesang&quot; (1811), was of a purely literary character. Yet even in this essay, Grimm showed that &quot;Minnesang&quot; and &quot;Meistergesang&quot; were really one form of poetry, of which they merely represented different stages of development, and also announced his important discovery of the invariable division of the &quot;Lied&quot; into three strophic parts.

Grimm&#x27;s text-editions were mostly prepared in conjunction with his brother. In 1812 they published the two ancient fragments of the &quot;Hildebrandslied&quot; and the &quot;Weißenbrunner Gebet&quot;, Jacob having discovered what until then had never been suspected — namely the alliteration in these poems. However, Jacob had little taste for text editing, and, as he himself confessed, working on a critical text gave him little pleasure. He therefore left this department to others, especially Lachmann, who soon turned his brilliant critical genius, trained in the severe school of classical philology, to Old and Middle High German poetry and metre.

Both Brothers were attracted from the beginning by all national poetry, whether in the form of epics, ballads or popular tales. They published In 1816–1818 a collection of legends culled from diverse sources and published the two-volume &quot;Deutsche Sagen&quot; (German Legends). At the same time they collected all the folktales they could find, partly from the mouths of the people, partly from manuscripts and books, and published in 1812–1815 the first edition of those &quot;Kinder- und Hausmärchen&quot; (Children&#x27;s and Household Tales), which has carried the name of the brothers Grimm into every household of the western world. The closely related subject of the satirical beast epic of the Middle Ages also held great charm for Jacob Grimm, and he published an edition of the &quot;Reinhart Fuchs&quot; in 1834. His first contribution to mythology was the first volume of an edition of the Eddaic songs, undertaken jointly with his brother, and was published in 1815. However, this work was not followed by any others on the subject.

The first edition of his &quot;Deutsche Mythologie&quot; (German Mythology) appeared in 1835. This work covered the whole range of the subject, attempting to trace the mythology and superstitions of the old Teutons back to the very dawn of direct evidence, and following their evolution to modern-day popular traditions, tales, and expressions.

==Legal scholarship==
Grimm&#x27;s work as a jurist was influential for the development of the history of law, particularly in Northern Europe.

His essay &quot;Von der Poesie im Recht&quot; (&quot;Poetry in Law&quot;, 1816) developed a far-reaching, suprapositivist Romantic conception of law. The &quot;Deutsche Rechtsalterthümer&quot; (&quot;German Legal Antiquities&quot;, 1828) was a comprehensive compilation of sources of law from all Germanic languages, whose structure allowed an initial understanding of older German legal traditions not influenced by Roman law. Grimm&#x27;s &quot;Weisthümer&quot; (4 vol., 1840–63), a compilation of partially oral legal traditions from rural Germany, allows research of the development of written law in Northern Europe.

==Politics==
Jacob Grimm&#x27;s work tied in strongly with his views on Germany and its culture. His work on both fairy tales and philology dealt with the country&#x27;s origins. He wished for a united Germany, and, like his brother, supported the Liberal movement for a constitutional monarchy and civil liberties, as demonstrated by their involvement in the Göttingen Seven protest. In the German revolution of 1848, he was elected to the Frankfurt National Parliament. The people of Germany had demanded a constitution, so the Parliament, formed of elected members from various German states, met to form one. Grimm was selected for the office largely because of his part in the University of Göttingen&#x27;s refusal to swear to the king of Hanover. In Frankfurt, he made some speeches and was adamant that the Danish-ruled but German-speaking duchy of Holstein be under German control. Grimm soon became disillusioned with the National Assembly and asked to be released from his duties to return to his studies.

He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1863.

== Death ==
Jacob Grimm died on 20 September 1863, in Berlin, Germany from disease, at the age of 78.

<text>Jamiroquai ( ) are an English acid jazz and funk band from London. Formed in 1992, they are fronted by vocalist Jay Kay, and were prominent in the London-based funk and acid jazz movement of the 1990s. They built on their acid jazz sound in their early releases and later drew from rock, disco, electronic and Latin music genres. Lyrically, the group have addressed social and environmental justice. Kay has remained the only constant member through several line-up changes.

The band made their debut under Acid Jazz Records but subsequently found mainstream success under Sony. While under this label, three of their albums have charted at number one in the UK, including &quot;Emergency on Planet Earth&quot; (1993), &quot;Synkronized&quot; (1999), &quot;A Funk Odyssey&quot; (2001), and the band&#x27;s single, &quot;Deeper Underground&quot; (1998).

, Jamiroquai had sold more than 26million albums worldwide. Their third album, &quot;Travelling Without Moving&quot; (1996), received a Guinness World Record as the best-selling funk album in history. The music video for its second single, &quot;Virtual Insanity&quot;, also contributed to the band&#x27;s success. The song was named Video of the Year at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards and earned the band a Grammy Award in 1998.

==History==

=== 1992–1995: Formation, &quot;Emergency on Planet Earth&quot; and &quot;The Return of the Space Cowboy&quot;===
Jay Kay was sending songs to record companies, including a hip-hop single released in 1986 under the label StreetSounds. During this time, Kay was influenced by Native American and First Nation peoples and their philosophies; this led to the creation of &quot;When You Gonna Learn&quot;, a song covering social issues. After he had it recorded, Kay fought with his producer, who took out half of the lyrics and produced the song based on what was charting at the time. With the track restored to his preference, the experience helped Kay realise he &quot;wanted a proper live band with a proper live sound&quot;. The band would be named &quot;Jamiroquai&quot;, a portmanteau of the words &quot;jam&quot; and the name of a Native American confederacy, the Iroquois. He was signed to Acid Jazz Records in 1991 after he sent a demo tape of himself covering a song by the Brand New Heavies. Kay gradually gathered band members, including Wallis Buchanan, who played the didgeridoo. Kay&#x27;s manager scouted keyboardist Toby Smith, who joined the group as Kay&#x27;s songwriting partner. In 1992, Jamiroquai began their career by performing in the British club scene. They released &quot;When You Gonna Learn&quot; as their debut single, charting outside the UK Top 50 on its initial release. In the following year, Stuart Zender became the band&#x27;s bassist by audition.

After the success of &quot;When You Gonna Learn&quot;, the band were offered major-label contracts. Kay signed a one-million-dollar, eight-album record deal with Sony Soho2. He was the only member under contract, but he would share his royalties with his band members in accordance to their contributions as musicians. Their label for US releases would be under the Work Group. The band released their debut album, &quot;Emergency on Planet Earth&quot;, where it entered the UK albums chart at number 1. Kevin L. Carter of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; commented that the album &quot;is full of upbeat, multi-hued pop tunes based heavily in acid jazz, &#x27;70s fusion, funk and soul, reggae and world music&quot;. With it, the band would continue to build upon their acid-jazz sounds in the following years. The album&#x27;s ecologically charged concept gave Kay press coverage, although Mark Jenkins of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; found the record&#x27;s sloganeering &quot;as crude as the music is slick&quot;.
The band&#x27;s original drummer, Nick van Gelder, was replaced in 1993 by Derrick McKenzie, who recorded with the group in one take for his audition. They issued their second album, &quot;The Return of the Space Cowboy&quot;, in 1994, and it ranked at number 2 in the UK chart. During its recording, Kay was in a creative block, worsened by his increasing drug use at the time, which resulted in its complex songwriting. However, the record was said to have &quot;capture[ed] this first phase of Jamiroquai at their very best&quot;, according to Daryl Easlea of BBC Music. Josef Woodard from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that its &quot;syncopated grooves and horn-lined riffs&quot; were &quot;played by humans, not samplers&quot;.

===1996–2000: &quot;Travelling Without Moving&quot;, peak of fame and &quot;Synkronized&quot;===
Released in 1996, &quot;Travelling Without Moving&quot; reached number 24 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 2 in the UK albums chart. With more than 8 million copies sold worldwide, it has been listed in the Guinness World Records as the best-selling funk album in history since 2001. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Virtual Insanity&quot;, gained popularity for its music video, which was heavily played on MTV. Containing symphonic and jungle elements, Kay aimed for a more accessible sound. Ted Kessler of &quot;NME&quot; saw &quot;Travelling Without Moving&quot; as an improvement from previous albums, while critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented that it did not have &quot;uniform consistenc[ies]&quot; in comparison.

While the group were preparing their fourth album, &quot;Synkronized&quot; (1999), Zender left Jamiroquai due to internal conflicts with Kay. While Zender had not been involved in the album&#x27;s songwriting, the group chose to scrap his recorded tracks to avoid lawsuits, and Nick Fyffe was recruited for new sessions. This resulted in what was thought to be both a &quot;tighter, more angry collection of songs&quot; for &quot;Synkronized&quot;, and a change of musical direction from &quot;creating propulsive collections of looooong tunes, speaking out against injustice&quot;. Some of the album&#x27;s tracks, including &quot;Canned Heat&quot;, display a hi-NRG and house style, while slower tempos on others were said to &quot;ease the pressure for [Kay&#x27;s] more romantic musings&quot;. The album reached number 1 in the UK albums chart and number 28 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. A year prior to &quot;Synkronized&quot;, &quot;Deeper Underground&quot; was released as a single for the and reached number one in the UK singles chart.

===2001–2009: &quot;A Funk Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Dynamite&quot; and subsequent activities===

The group issued their follow-up, &quot;A Funk Odyssey&quot;, a disco record exploring Latin music influences, in 2001. It introduced guitarist Rob Harris, whose playing in the album &quot;melts seductively into a mix that occasionally incorporates lavish orchestration&quot;, according to Jim Abbot of &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Sal Cinquemani claimed: &quot;Like its predecessors, &quot;Odyssey&quot; mixes self-samplage with Jamiroquai’s now-signature robo-funk.&quot; The album topped the chart in the UK. In the US, under Epic Records, it reached number 44 in the US &quot;Billboard 200&quot;. It was the last album to feature Smith, who left the band in the following year to spend more time with his family.

Their sixth album, &quot;Dynamite&quot;, was released in 2005 and reached number 3 in the UK; in the same year, Paul Turner replaced Fyffe as the band&#x27;s new bassist. Rashod D. Ollison of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; said the album &quot;boasts a harder digital edge ... With heavier beats, manipulated guitar lines and odd digital textures, &quot;Dynamite&quot; is less organic than Jamiroquai&#x27;s other efforts&quot;. Its tracks &quot;Feels Just Like It Should&quot; and &quot;Love Blind&quot; were characterised as &quot;[having] a fatter, dirtier sound than usual&quot;. In 2006, Kay&#x27;s contract with Sony ended, which led to the issue of the band&#x27;s greatest hits collection, &quot;High Times: Singles 1992–2006&quot;. It charted at number one in the UK after its first week of release. The following year, Jamiroquai performed at the Gig in the Sky, a concert held on a private Boeing 757 in association with Sony Ericsson. The band thus currently hold the Guinness World Record for &quot;fastest concert&quot;, performed on the aircraft whilst travelling at 1,017 km/h (632 mph).

===2010–2019: &quot;Rock Dust Light Star&quot; and &quot;Automaton&quot;===
&quot;Rock Dust Light Star&quot; was released in 2010 under Mercury Records, where it charted at number 7 in the UK. Kay considered the album as &quot;a real band record&quot; that &quot;capture[s] the flow of our live performances&quot;. Critics have seen this as a return to their organic funk and soul style, as it forgoes &quot;the electro textures that followed the band into the new millennium&quot;, according to Luke Winkie of &quot;MusicOMH&quot;. It also has a sound Thomas H. Green of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; described as &quot;Californian Seventies funk rock&quot;.

Jamiroquai released their 2017 album, &quot;Automaton&quot;, through Virgin EMI. It was their eighth studio album and the first in seven years, reaching number 4 in the UK. It was produced by Kay and band keyboardist Matt Johnson, and it &quot;carefully balance[s] their signature sound with… EDM, soul and trap sounds&quot;, according to Ryan Patrick of &quot;Exclaim!&quot;. Craig Jenkins of &quot;Vulture&quot; writes: &quot;Arrangements that used to spill out over horn, flute, didgeridoo, and string accompaniments now lean closer to French house&quot;. By 2018, the group&#x27;s line-up consisted of Kay, Harris, McKenzie, Johnson, Turner, percussionist Sola Akingbola, Nate Williams on guitar and keyboards and Howard Whiddett with Ableton Live.

=== 2021–present: &quot;The Heels of Steel Tour&quot; and upcoming ninth studio album ===
Kay announced on the back notes of their 2021 re-released single, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Going To The Moon&quot;, that the band were working on a new album. On 19 March 2024, Kay announced that recording sessions for the new album were underway. On 18 November 2024, Jamiroquai announced their upcoming UK and Europe 2025 tour, The Heels of Steel Tour, which is set to commence 6 November running through 12 December 2025. It will be their first live tour since 2019.

== Artistry ==

=== Musical style and influences ===

Jamiroquai&#x27;s music is generally termed acid jazz, funk, disco, soul, house, and R&amp;B. Their sound has been described by J. D. Considine as having an &quot;anything-goes attitude, an approach that leaves the band open to anything&quot;. Tom Moon wrote that the band &quot;embrac[es] old-school funk, Philly-soul strings, the crisp keyboard sounds of the &#x27;70s and even hints of jazz fusion&quot;, blending these with &quot;agitated, aggressive dance rhythms to create an easygoing feel that looks both backward and forward&quot;. Ben Sisario facetiously commented that Jay Kay and Toby Smith as songwriters, &quot;studied &quot;Innervisions&quot;-era [Stevie] Wonder carefully, and just about everything the group has recorded sounds like it could in fact have been played by [Wonder] himself.&quot;

Kay is the primary songwriter of Jamiroquai. When composing, he sings melodies and beats for band members to transcribe to their instrumentation. The band relies on analog sounds, such as running keyboards through vintage effects pedals &quot;to get the warmth and the clarity of those instruments&quot;. Parry Gettelman of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; described Kay&#x27;s vocals as &quot;not identifiably male or female, black or white&quot;. Other writers said Toby Smith&#x27;s keyboard arrangements were &quot;psychedelic and soulful&quot;, and compared Stuart Zender&#x27;s bass playing to the work of Marcus Miller. Wallis Buchanan on didgeridoo was met with either praise or annoyance from critics.

Kay was influenced by Roy Ayers, Herbie Hancock, Lou Donaldson, Grant Green, Sly Stone, Gil Scott-Heron, and hip-hop and its culture. He was introduced to much of these influences by British club DJs within the rare groove scene in the 1980s. &quot;I&#x27;d been into Stevie and all that… Then I got into the JBs, Maceo Parker and the Meters… I decided around that time to try to make music built around those loose, open grooves.&quot; A 2003 compilation titled &quot;Late Night Tales: Jamiroquai&quot; under Azuli Records, also contains a selection of some of the band&#x27;s late 1970s R&amp;B, disco and quiet storm influences. Kay and the group have been compared to Stevie Wonder, with some critics accusing the band of copying black artists. In response, Kay said &quot;we never tried to hide our influences&quot;. The band references them as Kay maintained Jamiroquai&#x27;s own sound: &quot;it&#x27;s about the style of music you aim for, not the exact sound. If you just sample Barry White or Sly Stone, that&#x27;s one thing; to get their spirit is different.&quot;

=== Lyrics ===

Jamiroquai&#x27;s lyrics have touched on socially charged themes. With &quot;Emergency on Planet Earth&quot; (1993), it revolves around environmental awareness and speaks out against war. &quot;The Return of the Space Cowboy&quot; (1994) contains themes of homelessness, Native American rights, youth protests, and slavery.

 &quot;Virtual Insanity&quot; from &quot;Travelling Without Moving&quot; (1996) is about the prevalence of technology and the replication and simulation of life. The lyrics of &quot;Automaton&quot; (2017) allude to dystopian films and compromised relationships within a digital landscape.

However, critics wrote that the band had focused more on &quot;boy–girl seductions&quot; and &quot;having fun&quot; rather than social justice, and that Kay&#x27;s interest in sports cars contradicts his earlier beliefs. Kay was reluctant to release &quot;Travelling Without Moving&quot; (1996), as it adopted a motorcar concept, but he added: &quot;just because I love to drive a fast car, that doesn&#x27;t mean I believe in [destroying the environment.]&quot; He also stated in separate interviews he was tired of being &quot;[a] troubadour of social conscious[ness]&quot;, and &quot;after a while you realise that people won&#x27;t boogie and dance to [politics].&quot;

=== Stage and visuals ===

While critics said the group tended towards 1970s funk and soul archetypes in their performances, Kay&#x27;s presence received praise, with critics noting his strong vocals and energetic dance moves on stage. Robert Hilburn said Kay &quot;establish[es] a rapport with the audience&quot; and has a &quot;disarming sense of humor&quot;. Helen Brown of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; was more critical, writing of a 2011 concert that there was no &quot;deeply personal emotion&quot; in its set list or in Kay&#x27;s vocals, and &quot;much of the material is exhilarating in the moment, forgettable thereafter&quot;.

With their visual style being described as &quot;sci-fi and futuristic&quot;, Jamiroquai&#x27;s music video of &quot;Virtual Insanity&quot; made them &quot;icons of the music-video format&quot;, according to Spencer Kornhaber from &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. It was directed by Jonathan Glazer, and depicted Kay &quot;perform[ing] in a room where the floors, walls and furniture all moved simultaneously.&quot;

Kay has worn elaborate headgear, some he designed himself. He said that the headgear give him a spiritual power described by the Iroquois as &quot;orenda&quot;. The illuminating helmet that appears in the music video for &quot;Automaton&quot; was designed by Moritz Waldemeyer for Kay to control its lights and movements and to portray him as an endangered species. Kay has also worn Native American head-dresses, in which he was accused of culturally appropriating sacred regalia of the First Nations.

== Legacy ==

As a prominent component of the London-based funk and acid-jazz movement of the 1990s, writer Kenneth Prouty said: &quot;few acid jazz groups have reached the level of visibility in the pop music mainstream as London-born Jamiroquai&quot;. The success of the 1996 single &quot;Virtual Insanity&quot; led to the climax of &quot;1970s soul and funk that early acid jazz artists had initiated&quot;. The band were also credited for popularising the didgeridoo. Artists who mention the group as an influence include Chance the Rapper, SZA, Kamaal Williams, the Internet, Calvin Harris, and Tyler, the Creator. According to Tony Farsides of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Jamiroquai&#x27;s musical prowess goes largely ignored. Whilst the band have received plaudits from American heavyweights such as Quincy Jones and Maurice White of Earth, Wind And Fire, Jamiroquai fight to be taken seriously in the UK.&quot; Writing for the same newspaper, Ian Gittins said the group &quot;have long been shunned by music&#x27;s tastemakers for a perceived naffness, and have shown their utter disregard for this critical snobbery by getting bigger and bigger&quot;. Sisario gave a negative review of the band&#x27;s discography in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; in 2004, finding much of their material to be identical.

Jamiroquai were the third-best-selling UK act of the 1990s, after the Spice Girls and Oasis. As of April 2017, they have sold more than 26 million albums worldwide. Despite becoming one of the most popular bands in the UK with high-charting albums, the band did not find as much success in the United States. The band&#x27;s studio albums became less frequently released. Kay said in 2013: &quot;I will only put out an album now when I am inspired to do so&quot;.

== Awards and nominations ==

Jamiroquai have received 15 Brit Award nominations. In 1999, the band won an Ivor Novello Award for an Outstanding Song Collection. Front-man Kay was given a BMI Presidents Award &quot;in recognition of his profound influence on songwriting within the music industry.&quot; Jamiroquai received a nomination for Best Pop Album at the 1998 Grammy Awards and won Best Performance by a Duo Or Group for &quot;Virtual Insanity&quot;. The band were also nominated for Best Short Form Music Video for &quot;Feels Just Like It Should&quot; at the 2005 Grammy Awards. For their &quot;Virtual Insanity&quot; music video, Jamiroquai had ten nominations at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards and four wins: Best Visual Effects, Best Cinematography, Best Breakthrough Video and Video of the Year.

<text>John Augustus Sutter (February 23, 1803 – June 18, 1880), born Johann August Sutter and known in Spanish as Don Juan Sutter, was a Swiss immigrant who became a Mexican and later an American citizen, known for establishing Sutter&#x27;s Fort in the area that would eventually become Sacramento, California, the state&#x27;s capital. His employee James W. Marshall discovered gold, leading to the founding of the mill-making team at Sutter&#x27;s Mill. Sutter, however, saw his own business ventures fail during the California Gold Rush, though those of his elder son, John Augustus Sutter Jr., were more successful.

==Early life==
Sutter was born on February 23, 1803, in Kandern, Baden in present-day Germany, to Johann Jakob Sutter, a foreman at a paper mill, and Christina Wilhelmine Sutter (née Stober). His father came from the nearby town of Rünenberg, in the canton of Basel in Switzerland, and his maternal grandfather was a pastor from Grenzach, on the Swiss-German border.

After attending school in Kandern, Sutter studied at Saint-Blaise from 1818 to 1819. He then worked as an apprentice at the Thurneysen printing and publishing house in Basel until 1823. From 1823 to 1828, he was employed as a clerk in clothing shops in Aarburg and Burgdorf. At age 21, Sutter married the daughter of a wealthy widow. He briefly operated a store but spent more time indulging his interests than managing the business. Facing mounting debts and legal charges that could lead to imprisonment, he fled to America to avoid trial, adopting the name Captain John Augustus Sutter.

In May 1834, he left his wife and five children behind in Burgdorf, Switzerland, and with a French passport, he boarded the ship &quot;Sully&quot;, which traveled from Le Havre, France, to New York City, where it arrived on July 14, 1834.

==The New World==
In North America, John Augustus Sutter (as he would call himself for the rest of his life) undertook extensive travels. Before he went to the United States, he had learned Spanish, English, and French. He and 35 Germans traveled from the St. Louis area to Santa Fe, New Mexico (then a province of Mexico), before eventually settling in Westport (modern-day Kansas City). On April 1, 1838, he joined a group of missionaries, led by the fur trapper Andrew Drips, and traveled the Oregon Trail to Fort Vancouver in Oregon Territory, which they reached in October. Sutter originally planned to cross the Siskiyou Mountains during the winter, but acting chief factor James Douglas convinced him that such an attempt would be perilous. Douglas charged Sutter £21 to arrange transportation on the British bark &quot;Columbia&quot; for himself and his eight followers.

The &quot;Columbia&quot; departed Fort Vancouver on November 11 and sailed to the Hawaiian Kingdom, reaching Honolulu on December 9. Sutter had missed the only ship outbound for Alta California, and had to remain in the kingdom for four months. Over the months, Sutter developed friendly relations with the European-American community, dining with Consuls of the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, John Coffin Jones and Richard Charlton, as well as merchants like American Faxon Atherton. The brig &quot;Clementine&quot; was eventually hired by Sutter to take freight provisions and general merchandise for New Archangel (now known as Sitka), the capital of the Russian-American Company colonies in Russian America. Joining the crew as unpaid supercargo, Sutter, 10 Native Hawaiian laborers, and several other followers embarked on April 20, 1839. Staying at New Archangel for a month, Sutter joined several balls hosted by Governor Kupreyanov, who likely gave help in determining the course of the Sacramento River. The &quot;Clementine&quot; then sailed for Alta California, arriving on July 1, 1839, at Yerba Buena (now San Francisco), which at that time was only a small seaport town.

===Beginnings of Sutter&#x27;s Fort===

At the time of Sutter&#x27;s arrival, Alta California was a province of Mexico and had a population of Native Americans estimated at 100,000–700,000. Sutter had to go to the capital at Monterey to obtain permission from the governor, Juan Bautista Alvarado, to settle in the territory. Alvarado saw Sutter&#x27;s plan of establishing a colony in Central Valley as useful in &quot;buttressing the frontier which he was trying to maintain against Indians, Russians, Americans and British.&quot; Sutter persuaded Governor Alvarado to grant him 48,400 acres of land for the sake of curtailing American encroachment on the Mexican territory of California. This stretch of land was called New Helvetia and Sutter was given the right to &quot;represent in the Establishment of New Helvetia all the laws of the country, to function as political authority and dispenser of justice, in order to prevent the robberies committed by adventurers from the United States, to stop the invasion of savage Indians, and the hunting and trading by companies from the Columbia (river).&quot;

The governor required Sutter to meet certain conditions to qualify for land ownership. These included residing in the territory for one year and becoming a Mexican citizen, which Sutter fulfilled on August 29, 1840. After receiving the land grant and building his fort, Sutter did not strictly adhere on his initial agreement to deter European settlers. Instead, he actively supported the migrations of Europeans to California. Sutter later stated, &quot;I gave passports to those entering the country… and this (Bautista) did not like it… I encouraged immigration, while they discouraged it. I sympathized with the Americans while they hated them.&quot;

Construction began on August 1839 on a fortified settlement which Sutter named New Helvetia, or &quot;New Switzerland,&quot; after his homeland. In order to elevate his social standing, Sutter impersonated a Swiss guard officer who had been displaced by the French Revolution and identified himself accordingly as &#x27;Captain Sutter of the Swiss Guard&#x27;. When the settlement was completed on June 18, 1841, he received title to on the Sacramento River. The site is now part of the California state capital of Sacramento.

===Relationship with Native Americans===
Sutter&#x27;s Fort had a central building made of adobe bricks, surrounded by a high wall with protection on opposite corners to guard against attack. It also had workshops and stores that produced necessary goods for the New Helvetia settlement.

Sutter employed or enslaved Native Americans of the Miwok, Maidu, Nisenan, and Ohlone tribes, the Hawaiians (Kanakas) he had brought, and also employed some Europeans at his compound. He envisioned creating an agricultural utopia, and for a time the settlement was in fact quite large and prosperous. Prior to the Gold Rush, it was the destination for most immigrants entering California via the high passes of the Sierra Nevada, including the ill-fated Donner Party of 1846, for whose rescue Sutter contributed supplies.

In order to build his fort and develop a large ranching/farming network in the area, Sutter relied on Indian labor. Some Native Americans worked voluntarily for Sutter (e.g. Nisenans, Miwoks, Ochecames), but others were subjected to varying degrees of coercion that resembled slavery or serfdom. Sutter believed that Native Americans had to be kept &quot;strictly under fear&quot; in order to serve white landowners. Housing and working conditions at the fort were very poor, and have been described as &quot;enslavement&quot;, with uncooperative Indians being &quot;whipped, jailed, and executed.&quot; Sutter&#x27;s Native American &quot;employees&quot; slept on bare floors in locked rooms without sanitation, and ate from troughs made from hollowed tree trunks. Housing conditions for workers living in nearby villages and rancherías was described as being more favorable. Pierson Reading, Sutter&#x27;s fort manager, wrote in a letter to a relative that “the Indians of California make as obedient and humble slaves as the Negro in the South&quot;. If Indians refused to work for him, Sutter responded with violence. Observers accused him of using &quot;kidnapping, food privation, and slavery&quot; in order to force Indians to work for him, and generally stated that Sutter held the Indians under inhumane conditions. Theodor Cordua, a German immigrant who leased land from Sutter, wrote:

&quot;When Sutter established himself in 1839 in the Sacramento Valley, new misfortune came upon these peaceful natives of the country. Their services were demanded immediately. Those who did not want to work were considered as enemies. With other tribes the field was taken against the hostile Indian. Declaration of war was not made. The villages were attacked usually before daybreak when everybody was still asleep. Neither old nor young was spared by the enemy, and often the Sacramento River was colored red by the blood of the innocent Indians, for these villages usually were situated at the banks of the rivers. During a campaign one section of the attackers fell upon the village by way of land. All the Indians of the attacked village naturally fled to find protection on the other bank of the river. But there they were awaited by the other half of the enemy and thus the unhappy people were shot and killed with rifles from both sides of the river. Seldom an Indian escaped such an attack, and those who were not murdered were captured. All children from six to fifteen years of age were usually taken by the greedy white people. The village was burned down and the few Indians who had escaped with their lives were left to their fate.&quot;

Heinrich Lienhard, a Swiss immigrant that served as Sutter&#x27;s majordomo, wrote of the treatment of the enslaved once captured:

&quot;As the room had neither beds nor straw, the inmates were forced to sleep on the bare floor. When I opened the door for them in the morning, the odor that greeted me was overwhelming, for no sanitary arrangements had been provided. What these rooms were like after ten days or two weeks can be imagined, and the fact that nocturnal confinement was not agreeable to the Indians was obvious. Large numbers deserted during the daytime, or remained outside the fort when the gates were locked.&quot;

Lienhard also claimed that Sutter was known to rape his Indian captives, even girls as young as 12 years old. Despite the procurement of fertile agriculture, Sutter fed his Native American work force in pig troughs, where they would eat gruel with their hands in the sun on their knees. Numerous visitors to Sutter&#x27;s Fort noted the shock of this sight in their diaries, alongside their discontent for his kidnapping of Indian children who were sold into bondage to repay Sutter&#x27;s debts or given as gifts. American explorer and mountain man James Clyman reported in 1846 that:

&quot;The Capt. [Sutter] keeps 600 to 800 Indians in a complete state of Slavery and as I had the mortification of seeing them dine I may give a short description. 10 or 15 Troughs 3 or 4 feet long were brought out of the cook room and seated in the Broiling sun. All the Labourers grate [sic] and small ran to the troughs like so many pigs and fed themselves with their hands as long as the troughs contained even a moisture.&quot;

Dr. Waseurtz af Sandels, a Swedish explorer who visited California in 1842–1843, also wrote about Sutter&#x27;s brutal treatment of Indian slaves in 1842:

&quot;I could not reconcile my feelings to see these fellows being driven, as it were, around some narrow troughs of hollow tree trunks, out of which, crouched on their haunches, they fed more like beasts than human beings, using their hands in hurried manner to convey to their mouths the thin porage [sic] which was served to them. Soon they filed off to the fields after having, I fancy, half satisfied their physical wants.&quot;

These concerns were even shared by Juan Bautista Alvarado, then Governor of Alta California, who deplored Sutter&#x27;s ill-treatment of indigenous Californians in 1845:

&quot;The public can see how inhuman were the operations of Sutter who had no scruples about depriving Indian mothers of their children. Sutter has sent these little Indian children as gifts to people who live far from the place of their birth, without demanding of them any promises that in their homes the Indians should be treated with kindness.&quot;

Despite his promises to the Mexican government, Sutter was hospitable to American settlers entering the region, and provided an impetus for many of them to settle there. The hundreds of thousands of acres which these men took from the Native Americans had been an important source of food and resources. As the White settlers were ranching two million head of livestock, shooting wild game in enormous numbers, and replacing wilderness with wheat fields, available food for Indians in the region diminished. In response, some Indians took to raiding the cattle of White ranchers. In August 1846, an article in &quot;The Californian&quot; declared that in respect to California Indians, &quot;The only effectual means of stopping inroads upon the property of the country, will be to attack them in their villages.&quot; On February 28, 1847 Sutter ordered the Kern and Sutter massacres in retaliation.

Much of Sutter&#x27;s labor practices were illegal under Mexican law. However, in April 22, 1850, following the annexation of California by the United States, the California state legislature passed the &quot;Act for the Government and Protection of Indians,&quot; legalizing the kidnapping and forced servitude of Indians by White settlers. In 1851, the civilian governor of California declared, &quot;That a war of extermination will continue to be waged ... until the Indian race becomes extinct, must be expected.&quot; This expectation soon found its way into law. An 1851 legislative measure not only gave settlers the right to organize lynch mobs to kill Indians, but allowed them to submit their expenses to the government. By 1852, the state had authorized over a million dollars in such claims.

In 1856, a &quot;San Francisco Bulletin&quot; editorial stated, &quot;Extermination is the quickest and cheapest remedy, and effectually prevents all other difficulties when an outbreak [of Indian violence] occurs.&quot; In 1860, the legislature passed a law expanding the age and condition of Indians available for forced slavery. A &quot;Sacramento Daily Union&quot; article of the time accused high-pressure lobbyists interested in profiting off enslaved Indians of pushing the law through, gave examples of how wealthy individuals had abused the law to acquire Indian slaves from the reservations, and stated, &quot;The Act authorizes as complete a system of slavery, without any of the checks and wholesome restraints of slavery, as ever was devised.&quot;

====&#x27;Red Star&#x27; and &#x27;Bear Flag&#x27; revolts====

=====Lone star rebellion=====

In 1844–1845, there was a revolt of the Mexican colony of California against the army of the mother country.

Two years earlier, in 1842, Mexico had removed California Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado, and sent Brigadier General Manuel Micheltorena to replace him. It also sent an army.

The army had been recruited from Mexico&#x27;s worst jails, and the soldiers soon began stealing Californians&#x27; chickens and other property. Micheltorena&#x27;s army was described as descending on California &quot;like a plague of locusts, stripping the countryside bare.&quot; Californians complained that the army was committing robberies, beatings, and rapes.

In late 1844, the Californios revolted against Micheltorena. He had appointed Sutter as &quot;commandante militar.&quot; Sutter, in turn, recruited men, one of whom was John Marsh, a medical doctor and owner of the large Rancho los Meganos. Marsh, who sided with the Californios, wanted no part of this effort. However, Sutter gave Marsh a choice: either join the army or be arrested and put in jail.

In 1845, Sutter&#x27;s forces met the Californio forces at the Battle of Providencia (also known as the Second Battle of Cahuenga Pass). The battle consisted primarily of an artillery exchange, and during the battle Marsh secretly went over to parley with the other side. There was a large number of Americans fighting on both sides. Marsh met with them and convinced the Americans on both sides that there was no reason for Americans to be fighting each other.

The Americans agreed and quit the fight, and as a result, Sutter’s forces lost the battle. The defeated Micheltorena took his army back to Mexico, and Californian Pio Pico became governor.

=====Mexico&#x27;s loss in the MexicanAmerican War=====
During the Mexican-American War, Mexico&#x27;s control over Alta California weakened significantly. Sutter, who identified himself as a French citizen, reportedly considered organizing muster British, Canadian, and American immigrants, along with Indigenous peoples, to declare New Helvetia an independent republic under French protection. Sutter wrote to US Counsel Jacob Leese in Yerba Buena: &quot;Very curious reports come to me from below but the poor wretches do not know what they do. The first French frigate that comes here will do me justice. The first step they do against me I will make a declaration of Independence and proclaim California a Republic independent of Mexico.&quot;

On July 7, 1846, following the Bear Flag Revolt and the Battle of Monterey, Commodore John B. Montgomery raised the American flag in Monterey. Four days later, on July 11, 1846, Sutter raised an American flag at his fort after receiving it from a messenger sent by Montgomery. In August 1846, Sutter formally transferred control of the fort to the United States after receiving a commission as a lieutenant under US Army Captain John C. Frémont. In March 1847, command returned to Sutter.

===Beginning of the Gold Rush===

In 1848, gold was discovered at Sutter&#x27;s Mill, by one of Sutter&#x27;s employees, James W. Marshall. It started when Sutter hired Marshall, a New Jersey native who had served with John C. Frémont in the Bear Flag Revolt, to build a water-driven sawmill in Coloma, along the American River. Sutter was intent on building a city on his property (not yet named ), including housing and a wharf on the Sacramento River, and needed lumber for the construction. One morning, as Marshall inspected the tailrace for silt and debris, he noticed some gold nuggets and brought them to Sutter&#x27;s attention. Together, they read an encyclopedia entry on gold and performed primitive tests to confirm whether it was precious metal. Sutter concluded that it was, in fact, gold, but he was very anxious that the discovery not disrupt his plans for construction and farming. At the same time, he set about gaining legitimate title to as much land near the discovery as possible.

Sutter&#x27;s attempt at keeping the gold discovery quiet failed when merchant and newspaper publisher Samuel Brannan returned from Sutter&#x27;s Mill to San Francisco with gold he had acquired there and began publicizing the find. Large crowds of people overran the land and destroyed nearly everything Sutter had worked for. To avoid losing everything, Sutter deeded his remaining land to his eldest son, John Augustus Sutter Jr., who had come from Switzerland to join his father in September 1848.

When Sutter Jr. arrived, Sutter Sr. asked his fellow Swiss majordomo Heinrich Lienhard to lend him his half of the gold he had mined, so that the elder Sutter could impress his son with a large amount of the precious metal. However, when Lienhard later went to the Fort, Sutter Jr., having taken charge of his father&#x27;s debt-ridden business, was unable to return his share of the gold to Lienhard, who finally accepted Sutter&#x27;s flock of sheep as payment.

The younger Sutter saw the commercial possibilities of the land and promptly started plans for building a new town he named Sacramento, after the Sacramento River. The elder Sutter deeply resented this; he had wanted the town named Sutterville (for both of them) and for it to be built near New Helvetia.

Sutter gave up New Helvetia to pay the last of his debts. He rejoined his family and lived on Hock Farm (north of Sacramento along the Feather River).

In 1853, the California legislature made Sutter a major general in the California Militia.

===Land grant challenge===
Sutter&#x27;s El Sobrante (Spanish for leftover) land grant was challenged by the Squatters&#x27; Association, and in 1858 the US Supreme Court denied its validity.

Sutter got a letter of introduction to the Congress of the United States from the governor of California. He moved to Washington, D.C. at the end of 1865, after Hock Farm was destroyed by fire in June of that year. Sutter sought reimbursement of his losses associated with the Gold Rush, and received a pension of US$250 a month as a reimbursement of taxes paid on the El Sobrante grant at the time that Sutter considered it his own.

He and wife Annette moved to Lititz, Pennsylvania in 1871. The proximity to Washington along with the reputed healing qualities of Lititz Springs appealed to the aging Sutter. He also wanted three of his grandchildren (he had grandchildren in Acapulco, Mexico, as well) to have the benefits of the fine private Moravian Schools. Sutter built his home across from the Lititz Springs Hotel (renamed in 1930 as the General Sutter Inn and subsequently as the Lititz Springs Inn &amp; Spa).

After prospectors had destroyed his crops and slaughtered cattle leaving him only his own gold, Sutter spent the rest of his life trying to get the government to pay him for his losses, without success. He continually petitioned Congress for restitution but little was done. On June 16, 1880, Congress adjourned, once again, without action on a bill that would have given Sutter US$50,000 (~$ in ). Two days later, Sutter died in the Mades Hotel in Washington. His body was returned to Lititz and buried adjacent to God&#x27;s Acre, the Moravian Graveyard; Annette Sutter died the following January and is buried with him.

==Legacy ==
There are numerous California landmarks bearing the name of Sutter. Sutter Street in San Francisco is named for John A. Sutter. Sutter&#x27;s Landing, Sutterville Road, Sutter Middle School (renamed Miwok Middle School in 2023), Sutter&#x27;s Mill School, and Sutterville Elementary School in Sacramento are all named after him. The Sutterville Bend of the Sacramento River is named for Sutter, as is Sutter Health, a non-profit health care system in Northern California. The City of Sutter Creek, California and Sutter, California are also named after him. In Acapulco, Mexico, the property that used to belong to John Augustus Sutter Jr. became the Hotel Sutter, which is still in service. The Sutter Buttes, a mountain range near Yuba City, California, and Sutter County, California (of which Yuba City is the seat) are named after him as well.

The Johann Agust Sutter House in Lititz, Pennsylvania was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

The &#x27;Sutter&#x27;s Gold&#x27; rose, an orange blend hybrid tea rose bred by Herbert C. Swim, was named after him.

Gov. Jerry Brown, elected to a third term in 2010, had a Welsh corgi named Sutter Brown, affectionately referred to as the First Dog of California. Sutter died in late 2016 from cancer.

On June 15, 2020, amid the Black Lives Matter protests and the removal of many statues deemed to be racist, the statue of John Sutter outside the Sutter Medical Center in Sacramento, CA, was removed, &quot;out of respect for some community members&#x27; viewpoints, and in the interest of public safety for patients and staff.&quot;

<doc id="16518" wikidata="Q84114" url="?curid=16518" title="John Adams (composer)">
<text>John Coolidge Adams (born February 15, 1947) is an American composer and conductor. Among the most regularly performed composers of contemporary classical music, he is particularly noted for his operas, many of which center around historical events. Apart from opera, his oeuvre includes orchestral, concertante, vocal, choral, chamber, electroacoustic, and piano music.

Born in Worcester, Massachusetts, Adams grew up in a musical family and was exposed to classical music, jazz, musical theatre, and rock music. He attended Harvard University, studying with Leon Kirchner, Roger Sessions, and David Del Tredici, among others. His earliest work was aligned with modernist music, but he began to disagree with its tenets upon reading John Cage&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Teaching at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, Adams developed a minimalist aesthetic first fully realized in &quot;Phrygian Gates&quot; (1977) and later in the string septet &quot;Shaker Loops&quot;. Adams became increasingly active in San Francisco&#x27;s contemporary music scene, and his orchestral works &quot;Harmonium&quot; and &quot;Harmonielehre&quot; (1985) first gained him national attention. Other popular works from this time include the fanfare &quot;Short Ride in a Fast Machine&quot; (1986) and the orchestral work &quot;El Dorado&quot; (1991).

Adams&#x27;s first opera was &quot;Nixon in China&quot; (1987), which recounts Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1972 visit to China and was the first of many collaborations with theatre director Peter Sellars. Though the work&#x27;s reception was initially mixed, it has become increasingly respected since its premiere, receiving performances worldwide. Begun soon after &quot;Nixon in China&quot;, the opera &quot;The Death of Klinghoffer&quot; (1991) was based on the Palestinian Liberation Front&#x27;s 1985 hijacking and murder of Leon Klinghoffer and incited considerable controversy for its subject matter. His next notable works include a Chamber Symphony (1992), a Violin Concerto (1993), the opera-oratorio &quot;El Niño&quot; (2000), the orchestral piece &quot;My Father Knew Charles Ives&quot; (2003), and the six-string electric violin concerto &quot;The Dharma at Big Sur&quot;. Adams won a Pulitzer Prize for Music for &quot;On the Transmigration of Souls&quot; (2002), a piece for orchestra and chorus commemorating the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks. Continuing with historical subjects, Adams wrote the opera &quot;Doctor Atomic&quot; (2005), based on J. Robert Oppenheimer, the Manhattan Project, and the building of the first atomic bomb. Later operas include &quot;A Flowering Tree&quot; (2006) and &quot;Girls of the Golden West&quot; (2017).

In many ways, Adams&#x27;s music is developed from the minimalist tradition of Steve Reich and Philip Glass, but he tends to more readily engage in the immense orchestral textures and climaxes of late Romanticism in the vein of Wagner and Mahler. His style is to a considerable extent a reaction against the modernism and serialism of the Second Viennese and Darmstadt Schools. In addition to the Pulitzer, Adams has received the Erasmus Prize, a Grawemeyer Award, five Grammy Awards, the Harvard Arts Medal, France&#x27;s Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, and six honorary doctorates.

==Life and career==

===Youth and early career===
John Coolidge Adams was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, on February 15, 1947. As an adolescent, he lived in Woodstock, Vermont, for five years before moving to East Concord, New Hampshire, and his family spent summers on the shores of Lake Winnipesaukee, where his grandfather ran a dance hall. Adams&#x27;s family did not own a television, and did not have a record player until he was ten. But both his parents were musicians, his mother a singer with big bands, and his father a clarinetist. He grew up with jazz, Americana, and Broadway musicals, once meeting Duke Ellington at his grandfather&#x27;s dance hall. Adams also played baseball as a boy.

In the third grade, Adams took up the clarinet, initially taking lessons from his father, Carl Adams, and later with Boston Symphony Orchestra bass clarinetist Felix Viscuglia. He also played in various local orchestras, concert bands, and marching bands while a student. Adams began composing at age ten and first heard his music performed as a teenager. He graduated from Concord High School in 1965.

Adams next enrolled in Harvard University, where he earned a bachelor of arts, magna cum laude, in 1969 and a master of arts in 1971, studying composition with Leon Kirchner, Roger Sessions, Earl Kim, Harold Shapero, and David Del Tredici. As an undergraduate, he conducted Harvard&#x27;s student ensemble, the Bach Society Orchestra, for a year and a half; his ambitious programming drew criticism in the student newspaper, where one of his concerts was called &quot;the major disappointment of last week&#x27;s musical offerings&quot;. Adams also became engrossed by the strict modernism of the 20th century (such as that of Boulez) while at Harvard, and believed that music had to continue progressing, to the extent that he once wrote a letter to Leonard Bernstein criticizing the supposed stylistic reactionism of &quot;Chichester Psalms&quot;. But by night, Adams enjoyed listening to The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, and Bob Dylan, and has said he once stood in line at eight in the morning to purchase a copy of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band.&quot;

Adams was the first Harvard student to be allowed to write a musical composition for his senior thesis. For his thesis, he wrote &quot;The Electric Wake&quot; for &quot;electric&quot; (i.e., amplified) soprano accompanied by an ensemble of &quot;electric&quot; strings, keyboards, harp, and percussion. A performance could not be put together at the time, and Adams has never heard the piece performed.

After graduating, Adams received a copy of John Cage&#x27;s book &quot;&quot; from his mother. Largely shaken of his loyalty to modernism, he was inspired to move to San Francisco, where he worked at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music from 1972 until 1982, teaching classes and directing the school&#x27;s New Music Ensemble. In the early 1970s, Adams wrote several pieces of electronic music for a homemade modular synthesizer he called the &quot;Studebaker&quot;. He also wrote &quot;American Standard&quot;, comprising three movements, a march, a hymn, and a jazz ballad, which was recorded and released on Obscure Records in 1975.

===1977 to &quot;Nixon in China&quot;===

In 1977, Adams wrote the half-hour-long solo piano piece &quot;Phrygian Gates&quot;, which he later called &quot;my first mature composition, my official &#x27;opus one&#x27;&quot;, as well as its much shorter companion piece, &quot;China Gates&quot;. The next year, he finished &quot;Shaker Loops&quot;, a string septet based on an earlier, unsuccessful string quartet called &quot;Wavemaker&quot;. In 1979, he finished his first orchestral work, &quot;Common Tones in Simple Time&quot;, which the San Francisco Conservatory of Music Orchestra premiered with Adams conducting.

In 1979, Adams became the San Francisco Symphony&#x27;s New Music Adviser and created the symphony&#x27;s &quot;New and Unusual Music&quot; concerts. A commission from the symphony resulted in Adams&#x27;s large, three-movement choral symphony &quot;Harmonium&quot; (1980–81), setting texts by John Donne and Emily Dickinson. He followed this with the three-movement orchestral piece (without strings) &quot;Grand Pianola Music&quot; (1982). That summer, he wrote the score for &quot;Matter of Heart&quot;, a documentary about psychoanalyst Carl Jung, a score he later derided as &quot;of stunning mediocrity&quot;. In the winter of 1982–83, Adams worked on the electronic score for &quot;Available Light&quot;, a dance choreographed by Lucinda Childs with sets by architect Frank Gehry. Without dance, the electronic piece alone is called &quot;Light Over Water&quot;.

After an 18-month period of writer&#x27;s block, Adams wrote his orchestral piece &quot;Harmonielehre&quot; (1984–85), which he called &quot;a statement of belief in the power of tonality at a time when I was uncertain about its future&quot;. Like many of Adams&#x27;s pieces, it was inspired by a dream, in this case, one in which he was driving across the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge and saw an oil tanker on the surface of the water abruptly turn upright and take off like a Saturn V rocket.

From 1985 to 1987, Adams composed his first opera, &quot;Nixon in China&quot;, with a libretto by Alice Goodman, based on Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1972 visit to China. The opera marked the first collaboration between Adams and theatre director Peter Sellars, who had proposed it to Adams in 1983. Adams worked with Sellars on all his operas until &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; (2022).

During this time, Adams also wrote &quot;The Chairman Dances&quot; (1985), which he described as an &quot;&#x27;out-take&#x27; of Act III of &quot;Nixon in China&quot;&quot;, to fulfill a long-delayed commission for the Milwaukee Symphony. He also wrote the short orchestral fanfare &quot;Short Ride in a Fast Machine&quot; (1986).

===1988 to &quot;Doctor Atomic&quot;===
Adams wrote two orchestral pieces in 1988: &quot;Fearful Symmetries&quot;, a 25-minute work in the same style as &quot;Nixon in China&quot;, and &quot;The Wound-Dresser&quot;, a setting of Walt Whitman&#x27;s 1865 poem of that title, written when Whitman was volunteering at a military hospital during the American Civil War. &quot;The Wound-Dresser&quot; is scored for baritone voice, two flutes (or two piccolos), two oboes, clarinet, bass clarinet, two bassoons, two horns, trumpet (or piccolo trumpet), timpani, synthesizer, and strings.

During this time, Adams established an international career as a conductor. From 1988 to 1990, he served as conductor and music advisor for the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra. He has also served as artistic director and conductor of the Ojai and Cabrillo Music Festivals in California. He has conducted orchestras around the world, including the New York Philharmonic, the Chicago Symphony, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the London Symphony Orchestra, and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, performing pieces by Debussy, Copland, Stravinsky, Haydn, Reich, Zappa, Wagner, and himself.

Adams completed his second opera, &quot;The Death of Klinghoffer&quot;, in 1991, again working with Goodman and Sellars. It is based on the 1985 hijacking of the Italian cruise ship &quot;Achille Lauro&quot; by Palestinian terrorists and details the murder of passenger Leon Klinghoffer, a retired, physically disabled Jewish American. The opera has generated controversy, including allegations that it is antisemitic and glorifies terrorism.

Adams&#x27;s next piece, &quot;Chamber Symphony&quot; (1992), is for a 15-member chamber orchestra. In three movements, the work is inspired by an unlikely combination of sources: Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s Chamber Symphony No. 1, Op. 9 (which Adams was studying at the time) and the &quot;hyperactive, insistently aggressive and acrobatic&quot; music of the cartoons his young son was watching.

The next year, he wrote his Violin Concerto for American violinist Jorja Fleezanis. Lasting a little more than half an hour, it is also in three movements: a &quot;long extended rhapsody for the violin&quot; is followed by a slow chaconne (titled &quot;Body through which the dream flows&quot;, a phrase from a poem by Robert Haas), and then an energetic toccare. Adams received the Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition for the concerto.

In 1995, he completed &quot;I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky&quot;, a stage piece with libretto by poet June Jordan and staging by Sellars. Inspired by musicals, Adams called the piece a &quot;songplay in two acts&quot;. The main characters are seven young Americans from different social and ethnic backgrounds, all living in Los Angeles, with stories that take place around the 1994 Northridge earthquake.

&quot;Hallelujah Junction&quot; (1996) is a three-movement composition for two pianos that employs variations of a repeated two-note rhythm. The intervals between the notes remain the same for much of the piece. Adams used the same phrase for the title of his 2008 memoir.

Written to celebrate the millennium, &quot;El Niño&quot; (2000) is an &quot;oratorio about birth in general and about the Nativity in specific&quot;. The piece incorporates a wide range of texts, including biblical texts as well as poems by Hispanic poets like Rosario Castellanos, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, Gabriela Mistral, Vicente Huidobro, and Rubén Darío,

After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the New York Philharmonic commissioned Adams to write a memorial piece for the victims. The result, &quot;On the Transmigration of Souls&quot;, was premiered around the first anniversary of the attacks. &quot;On the Transmigration of Souls&quot; is for orchestra, chorus, and children&#x27;s choir, accompanied by taped readings of the names of the victims mixed with the sounds of the city. It won the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Music and the 2005 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Composition.

Commissioned by the San Francisco Symphony, Adams&#x27;s orchestral piece &quot;My Father Knew Charles Ives&quot; (2003) has three movements: &quot;Concord&quot;, &quot;The Lake&quot;, and &quot;The Mountain&quot;. Though his father did not actually know American composer Charles Ives, Adams saw many similarities between the two men&#x27;s lives and between their lives and his own, including their love of small-town New England life and their unfulfilled musical dreams.
Written for the Los Angeles Philharmonic to celebrate the opening of Disney Hall in 2003, &quot;The Dharma at Big Sur&quot; (2003) is a two-movement work for solo electric six-string violin and orchestra. Adams wrote that with &quot;Dharma&quot;, he &quot;wanted to compose a piece that embodied the feeling of being on the West Coast – literally standing on a precipice overlooking the geographic shelf with the ocean extending far out to the horizon&quot;. Inspired by the music of Lou Harrison, the piece calls for some instruments (harp, piano, samplers) to use just intonation, a tuning system in which intervals sound pure, rather than equal temperament, the common Western tuning system in which all intervals except the octave are impure.

Adams&#x27;s third opera, &quot;Doctor Atomic&quot; (2005), is about physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, the Manhattan Project, and the creation and testing of the first atomic bomb. The work premiered at the San Francisco Opera in October 2005. Its libretto, by Sellars, draws on original source material, including personal memoirs, recorded interviews, technical manuals of nuclear physics, declassified government documents, and the poetry of the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, John Donne, Charles Baudelaire, and Muriel Rukeyser. It takes place in June and July 1945, mainly over the last few hours before the first atomic bomb explodes at the test site in New Mexico. Characters include Oppenheimer and his wife Kitty, Edward Teller, General Leslie Groves, and Robert Wilson. Two years later, Adams extracted music from the opera to create the &quot;Doctor Atomic Symphony&quot;.

In 2018, The Santa Fe Opera performed &quot;Doctor Atomic&quot; in its summer season. The production took place in Santa Fe, 33 miles away from the Los Alamos Laboratory, the Manhattan Project&#x27;s research and development facility. This proximity forged a deeper connection between the production and the people of Los Alamos, fostering a new relationship with the pueblo communities. According to Andrew Martinez, this association &quot;became an opportunity to confront the histories and present-day experiences of pain and suffering that New Mexico citizens have endured since that rainy summer night in July 1945 when the first atomic bomb was detonated&quot;. The production also featured a 2,400-pound silver orb hanging from the ceiling, representing the bomb. This single set piece stood on an otherwise empty stage, set against the backdrop of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.

=== After &quot;Doctor Atomic&quot; ===
Adams&#x27;s next opera, &quot;A Flowering Tree&quot; (2006), with a libretto by Adams and Sellars, is based on a folktale from the Kannada language of southern India translated by A. K. Ramanujan about a young girl who discovers she has the magic ability to transform into a flowering tree. The opera was commissioned as part of the Vienna New Crowned Hope Festival to celebrate the 250th anniversary of Mozart&#x27;s birth, and has many parallels with Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, including its themes of &quot;magic, transformation and the dawning of moral awareness&quot;.

Adams wrote three pieces for the St. Lawrence String Quartet: his First Quartet (2008), his concerto for string quartet and orchestra, &quot;Absolute Jest&quot; (2012), and his Second Quartet (2014). Both &quot;Absolute Jest&quot; and the Second Quartet are based on fragments from Beethoven, with &quot;Absolute Jest&quot; using music from his late quartets (specifically Opus 131, Opus 135 and the &quot;Große Fuge&quot;) and the Second Quartet drawing from Beethoven&#x27;s Opus 110 and 111 piano sonatas.

From 2011 to 2013, Adams wrote his two-act Passion oratorio, &quot;The Gospel According to the Other Mary&quot;, a decade after his Nativity oratorio, &quot;El Niño&quot;. The work focuses on the final few weeks of the life of Jesus from the point of view of &quot;the other Mary&quot;, Mary of Bethany (sometimes misidentified as Mary Magdalene), her sister Martha, and her brother, Lazarus. Sellars&#x27;s libretto draws from the Bible and from Rosario Castellanos, Rubén Darío, Dorothy Day, Louise Erdrich, Hildegard von Bingen, June Jordan, and Primo Levi.

&quot;Scheherazade.2&quot; (2014) is a four-movement &quot;dramatic symphony&quot; for violin and orchestra. Written for violinist Leila Josefowicz, who frequently performed Adams&#x27;s Violin Concerto and &quot;The Dharma at Big Sur&quot;, the work was inspired by the character Scheherazade (from &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;) who, after being forced into marriage, recounts tales to her husband in order to delay her death. Adams associated modern examples of suffering and injustice toward women, with acts in Tahrir Square during the Egyptian revolution of 2011, Kabul, and comments from &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot;.

Adams&#x27;s most recent opera, &quot;Girls of the Golden West&quot; (2017), with a libretto by Sellars based on historical sources, is set in mining camps during the California Gold Rush of the 1850s. Sellars described the opera this way: &quot;These true stories of the Forty-Niners are overwhelming in their heroism, passion and cruelty, telling tales of racial conflicts, colorful and humorous exploits, political strife and struggles to build anew a life and to decide what it would mean to be American.&quot;

On June 14, 2023, the Library of Congress announced that it was acquiring Adams&#x27;s manuscripts and papers for its Music Division, which also includes the papers of Bernstein, Copland, George and Ira Gershwin, Martha Graham, Charles Mingus, and Neil Simon, among others.

=== Personal life ===
Adams was married to Hawley Currens, a music teacher, from 1970 to 1974. He is married to photographer Deborah O&#x27;Grady, with whom he has a daughter, Emily, and a son, the composer Samuel Carl Adams.

==Musical style==

Adams&#x27;s music is usually categorized as minimalist or post-minimalist, although in an interview he said that his music is part of the &quot;post-style&quot; era at the end of the 20th century. He employs minimalist techniques, such as repeating patterns, but is not a strict follower of the movement. Adams adopted much of the minimalist technique of Steve Reich and Philip Glass, but his work synthesizes this with the orchestral textures of Wagner, Mahler, and Sibelius. Comparing &quot;Shaker Loops&quot; to the minimalist composer Terry Riley&#x27;s piece &quot;In C&quot;, Adams remarked:

Many of Adams&#x27;s ideas are a reaction to the philosophy of serialism and its depictions of &quot;the composer as scientist&quot;. The Darmstadt School of twelve-tone composition was dominant while Adams was in college, and he compared class to a &quot;mausoleum where we would sit and count tone-rows in Webern&quot;.

Adams experienced a musical epiphany after reading John Cage&#x27;s 1961 book &quot;Silence&quot;, which he said &quot;dropped into my psyche like a time bomb&quot;, causing him to drop out of academia, &quot;pack his belongings into a VW Bug, and drive to California&quot;. Cage posed fundamental questions about what music was, and regarded all types of sounds as viable sources of music. This perspective offered Adams a liberating alternative to serialism&#x27;s rule-based techniques. But Adams found Cage&#x27;s music equally restricting. He began to experiment with electronic music, and his experiences are reflected in the writing of &quot;Phrygian Gates&quot; (1977–78), in which the constant shifting between modules in Lydian mode and Phrygian mode refers to activating electronic gates rather than architectural ones. Adams explained that working with synthesizers caused a &quot;diatonic conversion&quot;, a reversion to the belief that tonality was a force of nature.

Some of Adams&#x27;s compositions amalgamate different styles. &quot;Grand Pianola Music&quot; (1981–82) is a humorous piece that purposely draws its content from musical cliches. In &quot;The Dharma at Big Sur,&quot; Adams draws from literary texts such as Jack Kerouac, Gary Snyder, and Henry Miller to illustrate the California landscape. He has professed his love of genres other than classical music; his parents were jazz musicians, and he has also listened to rock music, albeit only passively. Adams once claimed that originality was not an urgent concern for him the way it was for minimalists, and compared his position to that of Gustav Mahler, J. S. Bach, and Johannes Brahms, who &quot;were standing at the end of an era and were embracing all of the evolutions that occurred over the previous thirty to fifty years&quot;.

Like other minimalists of his time, Adams used a steady pulse to define and control his music. The pulse was best known from Terry Riley&#x27;s early composition &quot;In C&quot;, and more and more composers used it as a common practice. Jonathan Bernard highlighted this adoption by comparing &quot;Phrygian Gates&quot;, from 1977, and &quot;Fearful Symmetries&quot;, from 1988.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Adams started to add a new character to his music, which he called &quot;the Trickster&quot;. The Trickster allowed Adams to use the repetitive style and rhythmic drive of minimalism while simultaneously poking fun at it. When Adams commented on his own characterization of particular minimalist music, he said that he went joyriding on &quot;those Great Prairies of non-event&quot;.

==Critical reception==
===Overview===
Adams won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2003 for &quot;On the Transmigration of Souls&quot;. Response to his output as a whole has been more divided, and Adams&#x27;s works have been called both brilliant and boring in reviews that stretch across both ends of the rating spectrum. &quot;Shaker Loops&quot; has been called &quot;hauntingly ethereal&quot;, while 1999&#x27;s &quot;Naïve and Sentimental Music&quot; has been called &quot;an exploration of a marvelously extended spinning melody&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called 1996&#x27;s &quot;Hallelujah Junction&quot; &quot;a two-piano work played with appealingly sharp edges&quot;, and 2001&#x27;s &quot;American Berserk&quot; &quot;a short, volatile solo piano work&quot;.

The most critically divisive pieces in Adams&#x27;s collection are his historical operas. At first release, &quot;Nixon in China&quot; received mostly negative press. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Donal Henahan called the Houston Grand Opera world premiere of the work &quot;worth a few giggles but hardly a strong candidate for the standard repertory&quot; and &quot;visually striking but coy and insubstantial&quot;. In the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;, James Wierzbicki called Adams&#x27;s score the weak point in an otherwise well-staged performance, describing it as &quot;inappropriately placid&quot;, &quot;cliché-ridden in the abstract&quot; and trafficking &quot;heavily in Adams&#x27;s worn-out Minimalist clichés&quot;. But with time, the opera has come to be revered. In &quot;Music and Vision&quot;, Robert Hugill called a production &quot;astonishing ... nearly twenty years after its premier&quot;, while &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Fiona Maddocks praised the score&#x27;s &quot;diverse and subtle palette&quot; and Adams&#x27;s &quot;rhythmic ingenuity&quot;.

More recently, &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Anthony Tommasini commended a 2007 American Composers Orchestra concert celebrating Adams&#x27;s 60th birthday, calling Adams a &quot;skilled and dynamic conductor&quot; and the music &quot;gravely beautiful yet restless&quot;.

===Klinghoffer controversy===
The opera &quot;The Death of Klinghoffer&quot; has been criticized as antisemitic by some, including the Klinghoffer family. Leon Klinghoffer&#x27;s daughters, Lisa and Ilsa, after attending the opera, released a statement saying: &quot;We are outraged at the exploitation of our parents and the coldblooded murder of our father as the centerpiece of a production that appears to us to be anti-Semitic.&quot; In response to these accusations of antisemitism, composer and Oberlin College professor Conrad Cummings wrote a letter to the editor defending &quot;Klinghoffer&quot; as &quot;the closest analogue to the experience of Bach&#x27;s audience attending his most demanding works&quot;, and noted that, as a person of Jewish descent, he &quot;found nothing anti-Semitic about the work&quot;.

After the September 11 attacks in 2001, performances by the Boston Symphony Orchestra of excerpts from &quot;Klinghoffer&quot; were canceled. BSO managing director Mark Volpe said of the decision: &quot;We originally programmed the choruses from John Adams&#x27; &quot;The Death of Klinghoffer&quot; because we believe in it as a work of art, and we still hold that conviction. ... [Tanglewood Festival Chorus members] explained that it was a purely human reason, and that it wasn&#x27;t in the least bit a criticism of the work.&quot; Adams and &quot;Klinghoffer&quot; librettist Alice Goodman criticized the decision, and Adams rejected a request to substitute a performance of &quot;Harmonium&quot;, saying: &quot;The reason that I asked them not to do &quot;Harmonium&quot; was that I felt that &quot;Klinghoffer&quot; is a serious and humane work, and it&#x27;s also a work about which many people have made prejudicial judgments without even hearing it. I felt that if I said, &#x27;OK, &quot;Klinghoffer&quot; is too hot to handle, do &quot;Harmonium&quot;, that in a sense I would be agreeing with the judgment about &quot;Klinghoffer&quot;. In response to an article by the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;&#x27;s David Wiegand denouncing the BSO decision, musicologist and critic Richard Taruskin accused the work of catering to &quot;anti-American, anti-Semitic and anti-bourgeois&quot; prejudices.

A 2014 revival by the Metropolitan Opera reignited debate. Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, who marched in protest against the production, wrote: &quot;This work is both a distortion of history and helped, in some ways, to foster a three decade long feckless policy of creating a moral equivalency between the Palestinian Authority, a corrupt terrorist organization, and the state of Israel, a democracy ruled by law.&quot; Mayor Bill de Blasio criticized Giuliani&#x27;s participation in the protests, and Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of The Public Theater, said: &quot;It is not only permissible for the Met to do this piece – it&#x27;s required for the Met to do the piece. It is a powerful and important opera.&quot; A week after watching a Met performance of the opera, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said &quot;there was nothing antisemitic about the opera&quot; and characterized the portrayal of the Klinghoffers as &quot;very strong, very brave&quot; and the terrorists as &quot;bullies and irrational&quot;.

<text>Jonathan Vincent Voight (; born December 29, 1938) is an American actor. Throughout his career, he has received numerous accolades, including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, and four Golden Globe Awards as well as nominations for four Primetime Emmy Awards. In 2019, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts. Films in which Voight has appeared have grossed more than $5.2 billion worldwide.

Associated with the angst and unruliness that typified the late 1960s counterculture, Voight won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of a paraplegic Vietnam veteran in &quot;Coming Home&quot; (1978). His other Oscar nominations are for playing Joe Buck, a would-be gigolo, in &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; (1969); ruthless bank robber Oscar &quot;Manny&quot; Manheim in &quot;Runaway Train&quot; (1985); and sportscaster Howard Cosell in &quot;Ali&quot; (2001). His other notable films include &quot;Deliverance&quot; (1972), &quot;The Champ&quot; (1979), &quot;Heat&quot; (1995), &quot;&quot; (1996), &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; (1997), &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; (1998), &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, &quot;Zoolander&quot; (both 2001), &quot;Holes&quot; (2003), &quot;Glory Road&quot; (2006), &quot;Transformers&quot; (2007), and &quot;Pride and Glory&quot; (2008). He is also known for his role in the &quot;National Treasure&quot; film series.

Voight is also known for his television roles, including as Nazi officer Jürgen Stroop in &quot;Uprising&quot; (2001) and Pope John Paul II on the eponymous miniseries (2005). His role as Mickey Donovan on the Showtime drama series &quot;Ray Donovan&quot; brought him newfound acclaim and attention among critics and audiences, as well as his fourth Golden Globe win in 2014. He also appeared on the thriller series &quot;24&quot; in its seventh season.

Despite originally adopting liberal views, Voight has gained attention in his later years for his outspoken conservative and religious beliefs. He is the father of actress Angelina Jolie and actor James Haven.

==Early life and education ==
Jonathan Vincent Voight was born on December 29, 1938, in Yonkers, New York, to Barbara () and Elmer Voight (), a professional golfer. He has two brothers, Barry Voight, a former volcanologist at Pennsylvania State University, and James Wesley Voight, known as Chip Taylor, a singer-songwriter who wrote &quot;Wild Thing&quot; and &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot;. Voight&#x27;s paternal grandfather and his paternal grandmother&#x27;s parents were Slovak immigrants, while his maternal grandfather and his maternal grandmother&#x27;s parents were German immigrants. Political activist Joseph P. Kamp was his great-uncle through his mother.

Voight was raised as a Catholic and attended the Catholic boys&#x27; Archbishop Stepinac High School in White Plains, New York, where he first took an interest in acting. Following his graduation in 1956, he enrolled at Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he majored in art and graduated with a B.A. degree in 1960. After graduation, Voight moved to New York City, where he pursued an acting career. He graduated from the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre, where he studied under Sanford Meisner.

== Career==
===1961–1969: Early roles and breakthrough ===

Voight started his off-Broadway career in a revue called &quot;O Oysters&quot;, which ran in early 1961. He made his Broadway debut in the fall of 1961 as Rolf in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. In the early 1960s, Voight found work in television, appearing in several episodes of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, between 1963 and 1968, as well as guest spots on &quot;Naked City&quot; and &quot;The Defenders&quot;, both in 1963, and &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot;, in 1966 and &quot;Cimarron Strip&quot; in 1968. Voight&#x27;s theater career took off in January 1965, playing Rodolfo in Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot; in an Off-Broadway revival. Voight&#x27;s film debut did not come until 1967, when he took a part in Phillip Kaufman&#x27;s crimefighter spoof, &quot;Fearless Frank&quot;. He also took a small role in 1967&#x27;s western, &quot;Hour of the Gun&quot;, directed by veteran helmer John Sturges. In 1968 he took a role in director Paul Williams&#x27;s &quot;Out of It&quot;.

In 1968, Voight was cast in the groundbreaking &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; (1969), the film that would make his career. He played Joe Buck, a naïve male hustler from Texas, adrift in New York City. He comes under the tutelage of Dustin Hoffman&#x27;s Ratso Rizzo, a tubercular petty thief and con artist. The film explored late 1960s New York and the development of an unlikely, but poignant friendship between the two main characters. Directed by John Schlesinger and based on a novel by James Leo Herlihy, the film struck a chord with critics and audiences. Because of its controversial themes, the film was released with an X rating and would make history by being the only X-rated feature to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Both Voight and Hoffman were nominated for Best Actor, but lost out to John Wayne in&quot; True Grit.&quot;

=== 1970–1989: Stardom and acclaim ===

In 1970, Voight appeared in Mike Nichols&#x27; adaptation of &quot;Catch-22&quot;, and re-teamed with director Paul Williams to star in &quot;The Revolutionary&quot;, as a left-wing college student struggling with his conscience. Voight next starred in 1972&#x27;s &quot;Deliverance.&quot; Directed by John Boorman, from a script that James Dickey had helped to adapt from his own novel of the same name, it tells the story of a canoe trip in a feral, backwoods America. Both the film and the performances of Voight and co-stars Burt Reynolds and Ned Beatty received great critical acclaim, and were popular with audiences. Voight also appeared at the Studio Arena Theater, in Buffalo, New York, in the Tennessee Williams play &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; from 1973 to 1974 as Stanley Kowalski.

Voight played a directionless young boxer in 1973&#x27;s &quot;The All American Boy&quot;, then appeared in the 1974 film &quot;Conrack&quot;, directed by Martin Ritt. Based on Pat Conroy&#x27;s autobiographical novel &quot;The Water Is Wide&quot;, Voight portrayed the title character, an idealistic young schoolteacher sent to teach underprivileged black children on a remote South Carolina island. The same year he appeared in &quot;The Odessa File&quot;, based on Frederick Forsyth&#x27;s thriller, as Peter Miller, a young German journalist who discovers a conspiracy to protect former Nazis still operating within Germany. This film first teamed him with the actor-director Maximilian Schell, who acted out a character named and based on the &quot;Butcher of Riga&quot; Eduard Roschmann, and for whom Voight would appear in 1975&#x27;s &quot;End of the Game&quot;, a psychological thriller co-starring Jacqueline Bisset and based on a story by Swiss novelist and playwright Friedrich Dürrenmatt.

According to Joseph McBride&#x27;s biography of Steven Spielberg, Voight was Spielberg&#x27;s first choice for the role of Matt Hooper in the 1975 film &quot;Jaws&quot; and he turned down the role, which was ultimately played by Richard Dreyfuss. However, in interview with Dr. Ben Carson on September 6, 2024, Voight was asked if he turned down the part of Quint in Jaws; Voight said that the offer of a part in Jaws is &quot;a myth&quot; and that Spielberg had actually offered him a part in a different, less successful film, a role that he turned down because he thought it was a &quot;repeat of the character from Midnight Cowboy&quot;. In 1978, Voight portrayed the Vietnam veteran Luke Martin in Hal Ashby&#x27;s film &quot;Coming Home,&quot; and was awarded Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival, for his portrait of a cynical, yet noble paraplegic, reportedly based on real-life Vietnam veteran-turned-antiwar-activist Ron Kovic, with whom Jane Fonda&#x27;s character falls in love. The film included a much-talked-about love scene between the two. Fonda won her second Best Actress award for her role, and Voight won for Best Actor in a Leading Role at the Oscars. In 1979, Voight once again put on boxing gloves, starring as an alcoholic ex-heavyweight in Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s &quot;The Champ&quot; with Faye Dunaway and Ricky Schroder. The film was an international success, but less popular with American audiences.

He next reteamed with director Ashby in 1982&#x27;s &quot;Lookin&#x27; to Get Out&quot;, in which he played Alex Kovac, a con man who has run into debt with New York mobsters and hopes to win enough in Las Vegas to pay them off. Voight both co-wrote the script and also co-produced. He also produced and acted in 1983&#x27;s &quot;Table for Five&quot;, in which he played a widower bringing up his children by himself. Also in 1983, Voight was slated to play Robert Harmon in John Cassavetes&#x27; Golden Bear-winning &quot;Love Streams&quot;, having performed the role on stage in 1981. However, a few weeks before shooting began, Voight announced that he also wanted to direct the picture and was consequently dropped. In 1985, Voight teamed up with Russian writer and director Andrei Konchalovsky to play the role of escaped con Oscar &quot;Manny&quot; Manheim in &quot;Runaway Train&quot;. The script was based on a story by Akira Kurosawa, and paired Voight with Eric Roberts as a fellow escapee, and Rebecca De Mornay as an assistant locomotive engineer. Voight received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and won the Golden Globe&#x27;s award for Best Actor. Roberts was also honored for his performance, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Voight followed up this and other performances with a role in the 1986 film, &quot;Desert Bloom&quot;, and reportedly experienced a &quot;spiritual awakening&quot; toward the end of the decade. In 1989, Voight starred in and helped write &quot;Eternity&quot;, which dealt with a television reporter&#x27;s efforts to uncover corruption.

===1990–2012: Established actor ===

He made his first acting debut into television films, acting in 1991&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, followed by &quot;The Last of his Tribe&quot;, in 1992. He followed with 1992&#x27;s &quot;The Rainbow Warrior&quot; for ABC, the story of the ill-fated Greenpeace ship sunk by French operatives in Auckland Harbour. For the remainder of the decade, Voight would alternate between feature films and television movies, including a starring role in the 1993 miniseries &quot;Return to Lonesome Dove&quot;, a continuation of Larry McMurtry&#x27;s western saga, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;. Voight played Captain Woodrow F. Call, the part played by Tommy Lee Jones in the original miniseries. Voight made a cameo appearance as himself on the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Mom &amp; Pop Store&quot; airing November 17, 1994, in which George Costanza buys a car that appears to be owned by Jon Voight. Voight described the process leading up to the episode in an interview on the Red Carpet at the 2006 BAFTA Emmy Awards:

::Well what happened was I was asked to be on Seinfeld. They said: &quot;Would you do a Seinfeld?&quot; And I said, and I just happened to know to see a few Seinfelds and I knew these guys were really tops; they were really, really clever guys, and I liked the show. And so I said &quot;Sure!&quot; and I thought they would ask me to do a walk-on, the way it came: &quot;Would you come be part of the show?&quot; And I said &quot;Yeah, sure I&#x27;ll do it.&quot; You know what I mean? Then I got the script and my name was on every page because it was about my car. And I laughed; it was hysterically funny. So I was really delighted to do it. The writer came up to me and he said &quot;Jon, would you come take a look at my car to see if you ever owned it?&quot;, because the writer wrote it from a real experience where someone sold him the car based on the fact that it was my car. And I went down and I looked at the car and I said &quot;No, I never had this car.&quot; So unfortunately I had to give him the bad news. But it was a funny episode.

In 1992, Voight appeared in the HBO film &quot;The Last of His Tribe&quot;. In 1995, Voight played the role of &quot;Nate&quot;, a sophisticated fence, in the crime drama film &quot;Heat&quot;, directed by Michael Mann, and appeared in the television films &quot;Convict Cowboy&quot; and &quot;The Tin Soldier&quot;, also directing the latter film. Voight next appeared in 1996&#x27;s blockbuster film &quot;&quot;, directed by Brian De Palma and starring Tom Cruise. Voight played the role of spymaster James Phelps, a role originated by Peter Graves in the television series. In 1997, Voight appeared in six films, beginning with &quot;Rosewood&quot;, based on the 1923 destruction of the primarily black town of Rosewood, Florida, by the white residents of nearby Sumner. Voight played John Wright, a white Rosewood storeowner who follows his conscience and protects his black customers from the white rage. He next appeared in &quot;Anaconda&quot;, set in the Amazon; he played Paul Sarone, a snake hunter obsessed with a fabled giant anaconda, who hijacks an unwitting National Geographic film crew who are looking for a remote Indian tribe. Voight next appeared in a supporting role in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;U Turn&quot;, portraying a blind man. He took a supporting role in &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;, adopted from the John Grisham novel and directed by Francis Ford Coppola. He played an unscrupulous lawyer representing an insurance company, facing off with a neophyte lawyer played by Matt Damon. His last film of 1997 was &quot;Boys Will Be Boys&quot;, a family comedy directed by Dom DeLuise.

The following year, Voight had the lead role in the television film &quot;The Fixer&quot;, in which he played Jack Killoran, a lawyer who crosses ethical lines in order to &quot;fix&quot; things for his wealthy clients. A near-fatal accident awakens his dormant conscience and Killoran soon runs afoul of his former clients. He also took a substantial role in Tony Scott&#x27;s 1998 political thriller, &quot;Enemy of the State,&quot; in which he played Will Smith&#x27;s character&#x27;s stalwart antagonist from the NSA . Voight was reunited with director Boorman in 1998&#x27;s &quot;The General&quot;. Set in Dublin, Ireland, the film tells the true-life story of the charismatic leader of a gang of thieves, Martin Cahill, at odds with both the police and the Provisional IRA. Voight portrays Inspector Ned Kenny, determined to bring Cahill to justice. He next appeared in 1999&#x27;s &quot;Varsity Blues&quot;. He played a blunt, autocratic football coach, pitted in a test of wills against his star player, portrayed by James Van Der Beek. Produced by fledgling MTV Pictures, the film became a surprise hit and helped connect Voight with a younger audience. Voight played Noah in the 1999 television production &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;, and appeared in &quot;Second String,&quot; also for TV. He also appeared with Cheryl Ladd in the feature &quot;A Dog of Flanders&quot;, a remake of a popular film set in Belgium.
Voight next portrayed President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 2001&#x27;s action/war film &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, having accepted the role when Gene Hackman declined (his performance was received favorably by critics). Also that year, he appeared as Lord Croft, father of the title character of &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot;. Based on the popular video game, the digital adventuress was played on the big screen by Voight&#x27;s own real-life daughter Angelina Jolie. That year, he also appeared in &quot;Zoolander&quot;, directed by Ben Stiller who starred as the title character, a vapid supermodel with humble roots. Voight appeared as Zoolander&#x27;s coal-miner father. The film extracted both pathos and cruel humor from the scenes of Zoolander&#x27;s return home, when he entered the mines alongside his father and brothers and Voight&#x27;s character expressed his unspoken disgust at his son&#x27;s chosen profession. Also in 2001, Voight joined Leelee Sobieski, Hank Azaria and David Schwimmer in the made-for-television film &quot;Uprising&quot;, which was based on the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto. Voight played Major-General Juergen Stroop, the German officer responsible for the destruction of the Jewish resistance, and received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie

Director Michael Mann tagged Voight for a supporting role in the 2001 biopic &quot;Ali&quot;, which starred Will Smith as the controversial former heavyweight champ, Muhammad Ali. Voight was almost unrecognizable under his make-up and toupée, as he impersonated the sports broadcaster Howard Cosell. Voight received his fourth Academy Award nomination, this time for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, for his performance. Also in 2001, he appeared in the television mini-series &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk: The Real Story&quot; along with Vanessa Redgrave, Matthew Modine, Richard Attenborough, and Mia Sara. In 2003, he played the role of Marion Seville/Mr. Sir in &quot;Holes&quot;. In 2004, Voight joined Nicolas Cage, in &quot;National Treasure&quot; as Patrick Gates, the father of Cage&#x27;s character. In 2005, he played the title role in the second part of CBS&#x27; miniseries, &quot;Pope John Paul II&quot;.

In 2006, he was Kentucky Wildcats head coach Adolph Rupp in the Disney hit &quot;Glory Road&quot;. In 2007, he played United States Secretary of Defense John Keller in the summer blockbuster &quot;Transformers&quot;, reuniting him with &quot;Holes&quot; star Shia LaBeouf. Also in 2007, Voight reprised his role as Patrick Gates in &quot;National Treasure: Book of Secrets&quot;. He appeared in &quot;Bratz&quot; with his goddaughter Skyler Shaye. In 2008, he appeared as Creighton Kinkaid in the Christmas film &quot;Four Christmases&quot;. In 2009, Voight played Jonas Hodges, the American antagonist, in the seventh season of the hit Fox drama &quot;24&quot;, a role that many argue is based on real life figures Alfried Krupp, Johann Rall and Erik Prince. Voight plays the chief executive officer of a fictional private military company based in northern Virginia called &quot;Starkwood&quot;, which has loose resemblances to Academi and ThyssenKrupp. Voight made his first appearance in the two-hour prequel episode &quot;24: Redemption&quot; on November 23. He then went on to recur for 10 episodes of Season 7. He joined Dennis Haysbert as the only two actors ever to have been credited with the &quot;Special Guest Appearance&quot; card on &quot;24&quot;.

That same year Voight also lent his voice talents in the Thomas Nelson audio Bible production known as &quot;The Word of Promise&quot;. In this dramatized audio, Voight played the character of Abraham. The project also featured a large ensemble of other well-known Hollywood actors including Jim Caviezel, Louis Gossett Jr., John Rhys-Davies, Luke Perry, Gary Sinise, Jason Alexander, Christopher McDonald, Marisa Tomei and John Schneider.

===2013–present===
In 2013, Voight made his much-acclaimed appearance on &quot;Ray Donovan&quot; as Mickey Donovan, the main character&#x27;s conniving father. The role earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film in 2014 as well as nominations for two Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. He reprised his role in the 2022 film &quot;Ray Donovan: The Movie&quot;. He played Henry Shaw Sr. in &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot; (2016). The following year he acted in the Christian drama &quot;Same Kind of Different as Me&quot; alongside Greg Kinnear and Renée Zellweger. On March 26, 2019, Voight was appointed to a six-year term on the Board of Trustees of the Kennedy Center in Washington DC. He portrayed Supreme Court Justice Warren E. Burger in the film &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; (2020). In 2022 he participated in the documentary film &quot;Desperate Souls, Dark City and the Legend of Midnight Cowboy&quot; with Bob Balaban, Brian De Palma and Brenda Vaccaro. It premiered at the 79th Venice International Film Festival and was later shortlisted for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 96th Academy Awards. In 2022, Voight was cast in the science fiction epic &quot;Megalopolis&quot;, directed by Francis Ford Coppola. In &quot;Reagan&quot;, Jon Voight is cast as Viktor Ivanov, a former KGB agent. The film, starring Dennis Quaid as Ronald Reagan, was theatrically released in the United States on August 30, 2024.

On January 16, 2025, it was announced by president-elect Donald Trump that Voight would serve in a new role as a Special Ambassador to Hollywood, sharing the role with fellow actors Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone. Trump stated that he wants these actors to make Hollywood &quot;stronger than ever before&quot; by bringing back business lost to &quot;foreign countries&quot;.

==Political views==

In his early life, Voight&#x27;s political views aligned with American liberal views, and he supported President John F. Kennedy, describing his assassination as traumatizing to people at that time. He also worked along side Jane Fonda, Tina Sinatra, and Cicely Tyson for the George McGovern campaign, assisting with voter registration efforts in the inner city areas of Los Angeles. Voight actively protested against the Vietnam War. In the 1970s, he made public appearances alongside Jane Fonda and Leonard Bernstein in support of the leftist Popular Unity group in Chile.

In a July 28, 2008, op-ed in &quot;The Washington Times,&quot; Voight wrote that he regretted his youthful anti-war activism, and claimed that the peace movement of that time was driven by &quot;Marxist propaganda&quot;. He also claimed that the radicals in the peace movement were responsible for the communists coming to power in Vietnam and Cambodia and for failing to stop the subsequent slaughter of 1.5 million people in the Killing Fields.

In the same op-ed, Voight also criticized the Democratic Party and Barack Obama&#x27;s bid to become president, claiming that the Democrats had created &quot;a propaganda campaign with subliminal messages, creating a God-like figure (Obama)&quot; who would &quot;demoralize this country and help create a socialist America.&quot; He claimed that Obama had grown up with the teachings of very angry, militant white and black people around him.

Voight endorsed Republican presidential nominees Mitt Romney and Donald Trump in the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections respectively. Speaking at an inauguration rally for Trump in January 2017, Voight said, &quot;God answered all our prayers&quot; by granting Trump the White House. In May 2019, Voight released a short two-part video on Twitter supporting Trump&#x27;s policies, and calling him &quot;the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln.&quot;

In November 2020, after the United States presidential election, Voight released a statement through his Twitter account, in which he stated he was very angry that Joe Biden had won the election. He further implied that Biden had committed electoral fraud and proclaimed that the United States was engaged in &quot;our greatest fight since the Civil War – the battle of righteousness versus Satan, because these leftists are evil, corrupt, and they want to tear down this nation.&quot; He finished the statement by imploring his followers to not let the 2020 presidential election be certified without attempting to make sure it was accurate first. After the January 6 United States Capitol attack, and after Biden&#x27;s victory was confirmed in Congress on January 7, Voight released one more video on his Twitter account for his followers, telling them to cease protesting.

In 2022, following a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, Voight posted a video in support of gun control, arguing that &quot;proper qualifications&quot; and &quot;testing&quot; should be necessary for gun ownership. In November 2023, Voight expressed disappointment in his daughter Angelina Jolie, criticizing her views on the Israel-Hamas war and accusing her of spreading misinformation. Whereas Jolie had called for a ceasefire, Voight emphasized Israel&#x27;s right to protect its people, stating that the conflict was about preserving the Holy Land and the Jewish people. Reportedly this was one factor leading Jolie to once again cut off contact with him. Voight again endorsed Donald Trump&#x27;s candidacy for president in 2024.

==Personal life==
In 1962, Voight married actress Lauri Peters, whom he met when they both appeared in the original Broadway production of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. They divorced in 1967. He married actress Marcheline Bertrand in 1971. They separated in 1976, filed for divorce in 1978, and finalized it in 1980. Their children, James Haven (born 1973) and Angelina Jolie (born 1975), went on to enter the film business as actors and producers. Through Jolie, he has six grandchildren.

Voight has not remarried since the divorce from his second wife. Over the decades, he has dated Linda Morand, Stacey Pickren, Rebecca De Mornay, Eileen Davidson, Barbra Streisand, Nastassja Kinski, and Diana Ross.

== Acting credits and accolades ==

Over his career he has received several accolades including an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, and four Golden Globe Awards as well as nominations for four Primetime Emmy Awards and a Screen Actors Guild Award. In 2019 he was awarded with the National Medal of Arts.

<text>John Climacus (; ; ), also known as John of the Ladder, John Scholasticus and John Sinaites, was a 6th–7th century Christian monk at the monastery on Mount Sinai. He is revered as a saint by the Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church.

== History ==
There is almost no information about John&#x27;s life. There exists an ancient &quot;vita&quot; (life) of the saint by a monk named Daniel of the Raithu monastery, which is the principal source about the life of John. Daniel, though claiming to be a contemporary, admits to no knowledge of John&#x27;s origins—any detail on John&#x27;s birth is the result of much later speculation, and is confined to references in the Menologion. Daniel also does not provide any chronology and his knowledge of the life of John is both scanty and vague. If Daniel&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; is trustworthy (there is nothing against which to judge its accuracy), then John came to the &quot;Vatos&quot; Monastery at Mount Sinai, now Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery, and became a novice when he was about 16 years old. He was taught about the spiritual life by the more senior monk, Martyrius. After the death of Martyrius, John, wishing to practice greater asceticism, withdrew to a hermitage at the foot of the mountain. In this isolation he lived for some twenty years, constantly studying the lives of the saints and thus becoming one of the most learned Church Fathers.

In the meantime, the above tradition has been proven to be historically implausible. The artful rhetorical figures in his writings, as well as philosophical forms of thought indicate a solid academic education, as was customary for a profession in administration and law during his epoch. Such training could not have been acquired in Sinai.

Furthermore, biographical observations indicate that he probably lived by the sea, probably in Gaza, and apparently practiced Law there. It was only after his wife&#x27;s death, in his early forties, that he entered the Sinai Monastery. These findings also explain the horizon and the literary quality of his writings, which have a clear philosophical background. The legend of his renunciation of the world at the age of 16, found also in other biographies of saints, is to suggest his having been untouched by secular education. Blurred deliberately would have been any roots in theological and philosophical educational traditions.

When he was about 65 years of age, the monks of Sinai persuaded him to become their hegumen. He acquitted himself of his functions as abbot with the greatest wisdom. John Climacus&#x27; reputation spread so far that, according to the &quot;Life&quot; of John, Pope Gregory the Great wrote to propose himself to his prayers, and sent him a sum of money for the hospital of Sinai, where pilgrims lodged.

Of John&#x27;s literary output, we know only the &quot;Κλῖμαξ&quot; () or &quot;The Ladder of Divine Ascent&quot;. This was composed in the early 7th century at the request of John, Abbot of Raithu, a monastery situated on the shores of the Red Sea. Also surviving to the present day is a shorter work &quot;To the Pastor&quot; (Latin: &quot;Liber ad Pastorem&quot;), most likely a sort of appendix to the &quot;Ladder&quot;. It is in the &quot;Ladder&quot; that we hear of the ascetic practice of carrying a small notebook to record the monk&#x27;s thoughts during contemplation.

The &quot;Ladder&quot; describes how to raise one&#x27;s soul and body to God through the acquisition of ascetic virtues. Climacus uses the analogy of Jacob&#x27;s Ladder as the framework for his spiritual teaching. Each chapter is referred to as a &quot;step&quot;, and deals with a separate spiritual subject. There are thirty Steps of the ladder, which correspond to the age of Jesus at his baptism and the beginning of his earthly ministry. Within the general framework of a &#x27;ladder&#x27;, Climacus&#x27; book falls into three sections. The first seven Steps concern general virtues necessary for the ascetic life, while the next nineteen (Steps 8–26) give instruction on overcoming vices and building their corresponding virtues. The final four Steps concern the higher virtues toward which the ascetic life aims. The final rung of the ladder—beyond prayer (προσευχή), stillness (ἡσυχία), and even dispassion (ἀπάθεια)—is love (ἀγάπη).

Originally written simply for the monks of a neighbouring monastery, the &quot;Ladder&quot; swiftly became one of the most widely read and much-beloved books of Byzantine spirituality. This book remains one of the most widely read among Orthodox Christians, especially during the season of Great Lent which immediately precedes Pascha (Easter). It is often read in the &quot;trapeza&quot; (refectory) in Orthodox monasteries, and in some places it is read in church as part of the Daily Office on Lenten weekdays, being prescribed in the &quot;Triodion&quot;.

An icon known by the same title, &quot;Ladder of Divine Ascent&quot;, depicts a ladder extending from earth to heaven. Several monks are depicted climbing a ladder; at the top is Jesus, prepared to receive them into Heaven. Also shown are angels helping the climbers, and demons attempting to drag down the climbers or shoot them with arrows, no matter how high up the ladder they may be. Most versions of the icon show at least one person falling. Often, in the lower right corner John Climacus himself is shown, gesturing towards the ladder, with rows of monks behind him.

Saint John&#x27;s feast day is 30 March in both the East and West. The Eastern Orthodox Church and the Byzantine Catholic churches also commemorate him on the Fourth Sunday of Great Lent. Many churches are dedicated to him in Russia, including a church and belltower in the Moscow Kremlin. John Climacus was also known as &quot;Scholasticus&quot;, but he is not to be confused with John Scholasticus, Patriarch of Constantinople.

Several translations into English have been made, including one by Holy Transfiguration Monastery (Boston, 1978). This volume contains the &quot;Life of St. John&quot; by Daniel, &quot;The Ladder of Divine Ascent&quot;, and &quot;To the Pastor&quot;, and provides footnotes explaining many of the concepts and terminology used from an Orthodox perspective, as well as a General Index.

<text>Jerome Callet (April 24, 1930 – May 13, 2019) was a brass embouchure clinician, and designer of brass instruments and mouthpieces.

Callet rediscovered the original brass embouchure technique utilized in Europe during the baroque era, which at the time was only passed on verbally from trumpet guild members to their sons, and subsequently, by the great classical and jazz players of the first half of the 20th century. While this technique was described in written form within the first brass instruction books published in France in the late 1800s, as well as some American trumpet method books from the early 20th century, the instructions were mistranslated by subsequent generations of teachers, altering the trajectory and quality of brass playing and instruction for the past 100 years. Callet subsequently began creating and manufacturing his own line of trumpets and mouthpieces, for he believed that most modern trumpet equipment was designed to compensate for the failures of modern trumpet playing and teaching.

Born April 24, 1930, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Callet began his trumpet studies at age thirteen after being inspired by two fellow students, Cal Massey and Tommy Turrentine, at Herron Hill Junior High School in Pittsburgh. Although he subsequently studied with several well known and accomplished trumpet instructors in the Pittsburgh area and dedicated himself laboriously to mastering the instrument, by the age of thirty Callet could still not play a high C. In 1947, after many years of struggle, Callet began researching the physical elements necessary to develop a &quot;Super Power Embouchure&quot;, such as those developed by players such as Harry James, Charlie Shavers, Horst Fischer, Maurice Andre, and Maynard Ferguson. In 1970, at the age of 40, and after much trial and error, Callet had developed his new embouchure, and named it Superchops. The Superchops embouchure methodology eventually led him on the quest to design and produce the best trumpets and mouthpieces available.
Callet&#x27;s involvement with the business of instruments began with sixteen years in sales (1953–1968) for Elden Benge, followed by eight years of experience with Dominick Calicchio (1968–1975). He absorbed much of his knowledge of trumpet making from these two brilliant men. With this rich background and his talent as an accomplished machinist, Mr. Callet was able to release his first line of trumpet mouthpieces in 1973, and his first trumpet under his own brand name in 1984. In 1973, he also developed a line of mouthpieces to complement his embouchure theories. In the meantime, he taught embouchure technique in Pittsburgh (1960) and New York (from 1972 to April 2019).
The fulfillment of his quest to create the best brass instruments possible culminated with his &quot;New York Soloist&quot; B♭ trumpet, released in 2013 (built by Kanstul), and his 1ss, 1sc, and 1sb trumpet mouthpieces, released in 2017 (built by Jim New). Callet&#x27;s historical legacy of trumpet manufacturing is represented by his &quot;Sima Bb&quot;, &quot;Sima C&quot;, &quot;Sima D/Eb&quot;, &quot;Jazz Bb&quot;, &quot;Superchops Bb&quot;, &quot;Symphonique Bb&quot;, &quot;Symphonique C&quot;, &quot;Stratosphere Bb&quot;, and previous &quot;Soloist Bb&quot; trumpets, as well as his &quot;Grand Prix&quot; flugelhorn, his earlier &quot;Jazz&quot; and &quot;NY&quot; flugelhorns, and his &quot;Jazz&quot; trombone. More than 6,000 Callet trumpets and 15,000 Callet mouthpieces were manufactured overall. 
Callet published five books on trumpet embouchure and technique, including &quot;Trumpet Secrets&quot; (2002), &quot;Beyond Arban&quot; (1991), &quot;Superchops&quot; (1987), &quot;Brass Power and Endurance&quot; (1974), and &quot;Trumpet Yoga&quot; (1971), as well as the &quot;Master Superchops&quot; DVD (2007). Callet also conducted brass embouchure clinics in the United States, Canada, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, France, Denmark, Hungary and Japan.

<text>Java is a German-style board game designed by Wolfgang Kramer and Michael Kiesling, illustrated by Franz Vohwinkel, and published in 2000 by Ravensburger in German and by Rio Grande Games in English. In the game, players build the island of Java to set up palace festivals and gain victory points. Upon its release, the game received several awards.

== Gameplay ==
The game provides the atmosphere of the island of Java on a hexagonal board. Players build the island and score by setting up palace festivals at opportune moments. When players run out of hexagons to build the island, the game is over. A final scoring phase now takes place and a winner is declared.

== Reception ==
Bernhard Fischer, reviewing from &quot;Spieletest&quot;, praised the game’s strategy and tactics. However, he criticised its poor appeal for intermediate players and complex rules. &quot;Java&quot; also placed 9th place in the 2001 &quot;Deutscher Spiele Preis&quot; award and the &quot;Games Magazine&quot; Best Advanced Strategy Game in 2002. It is the second game in the Mask Trilogy, following &quot;Tikal&quot; and followed by &quot;Mexica&quot;.

<text>John Radcliffe (1650 – 1 November 1714) was an English physician, academic and politician. A number of landmark buildings in Oxford, including the Radcliffe Camera (in Radcliffe Square), the Radcliffe Infirmary, the Radcliffe Science Library, Radcliffe Primary Care and the Radcliffe Observatory were named after him. The John Radcliffe Hospital, a large tertiary hospital in Headington, is also named after him.

==Life==
Radcliffe was born the son of George Radcliffe and Anne Loader, in Wakefield, Yorkshire, where he was baptised on 1 May 1650. He was educated at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield and Northallerton Grammar School and graduated from the University of Oxford, where he was an exhibitioner at University College tutored by Obadiah Walker, to become a Fellow of Lincoln College. He obtained his MD in 1682 and moved to London shortly afterwards. There he enjoyed great popularity and became royal physician to William III and Mary II.

In 1690 he was elected Member of Parliament for Bramber, Sussex and in 1713 member for Buckingham.

On his death in the following year, his property was bequeathed to various charitable causes, including St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, London and University College, Oxford, where the Radcliffe Quad is named after him. The charitable trust founded by his will of 13 September 1714 still operates as a registered charity.

==Anecdotes of Radcliffe==
1. Among the many singularities related of Radcliffe, it has been noticed that, when he was in a convivial party, he was unwilling to leave it, even though sent for by persons of the highest distinction. Whilst he was thus deeply engaged at a tavern, he was called on by a grenadier, who desired his immediate attendance on his &quot;colonel&quot;; but no entreaties could prevail on the physician to postpone his revelry.

:&quot;Sir,&quot; the soldier was quoted as saying, &quot;my orders are to bring you to the boss.&quot; And being a very powerful man, he took him up in his arms, and carried him off per force. He had betrayed his loyal friend. After traversing some dirty lanes, the doctor and his escort arrived at a narrow alley.
:&quot;What the Devil is all this,&quot; said Radcliffe, &quot;your colonel doesn&#x27;t live here?&quot;
:&quot;No,&quot; said his military friend, &quot;my colonel does not live here – but my comrade does, and he&#x27;s worth two of the colonel, so by God, doctor, if you don&#x27;t do your best for &quot;him&quot;, it will be the worst for &quot;you!&quot;&quot;

2. To confer medical authority upon themselves, doctors of the day often published their theories, clinical findings, and pharmacopoeia (collections of &quot;receipts&quot; or prescriptions). Radcliffe, however, not only wrote little but also took a certain iconoclastic pride in having read little, remarking once of some vials of herbs and a skeleton in his study: “This is Radcliffe’s library.” However, he bequeathed a substantial sum of money to Oxford for the founding of the Radcliffe Library, an endowment which, Samuel Garth quipped, was &quot;about as logical as if a eunuch should found a seraglio.&quot;

3. Physician to King William III until 1699, when Radcliffe offended the King by remarking &quot;Why truly, I would not have your Majesty&#x27;s two legs for your three kingdoms.&quot;

== Medical institutions named after Radcliffe ==
The John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford is named after John Radcliffe, as was the former Radcliffe Infirmary, now being redeveloped for academic use by Oxford University as the Radcliffe Observatory Quarter.

<text>Joual () is an accepted name for the linguistic features of Quebec French that are associated with the French-speaking working class in Montreal which has become a symbol of national identity for some. &quot;Joual&quot; has historically been stigmatized by some, and celebrated by others. While &quot;Joual&quot; is often considered a sociolect of the Québécois working class, many feel that perception is outdated, with &quot;Joual&quot; becoming increasingly present in the arts.

Speakers of Quebec French from outside Montreal usually have other names to identify their speech, such as Magoua in Trois-Rivières, and Chaouin south of Trois-Rivières. Linguists tend to eschew this term, but historically some have reserved the term &quot;Joual&quot; for the variant of Quebec French spoken in Montreal.

Both the upward socio-economic mobility among the Québécois, and a cultural renaissance around &quot;Joual&quot; connected to the Quiet Revolution in the Montreal East-End have resulted in &quot;Joual&quot; being spoken by people across the educational and economic spectrum. Today, many Québécois who were raised in Quebec during the 20th century (command of English notwithstanding) can understand and speak at least some &quot;Joual. Joual&quot; is also commonly spoken in a few Francophone communities in Ontario, such as Hearst.

== History ==

The creation of &quot;Joual&quot; can be traced back to the &quot;era of silence&quot;, the period from the 1840s to the 1960s and the start of the Quiet Revolution. The &quot;era of silence&quot; was marked with stark stigmatization of the common working man. Written documents were not shared with the typical working class man, and the very strict form of French that was used by elites excluded a majority of the population. The Quiet Revolution during the 1960s was a time of awakening, in which the Quebec working class demanded more respect in society, including wider use of Québécois in literature and the performing arts. Michel Tremblay is an example of a writer who deliberately used &quot;Joual&quot; and Québécois to represent the working class populations of Quebec. &quot;Joual&quot;, a language of the working class, quickly became associated with slang and vulgar language. Despite its continued use in Canada, there are still ideologies present which place a negative connotation on the use of &quot;Joual&quot;.

== Origin of the name ==
Although coinage of the name &quot;joual&quot; is often attributed to French-Canadian journalist André Laurendeau, who in October 1959 wrote an article in &quot;Le Devoir&quot; criticizing the quality of the French language spoken by French Canadian students, the usage of this term throughout French-speaking Canada likely predates this text.

The actual word &quot;Joual&quot; is the representation of how the word &quot;cheval&quot; (Standard French: , ) is pronounced by those who speak &quot;Joual&quot;. (&quot;Horse&quot; is used in a variation of the phrase , i.e. to speak French terribly; hence, a put-down of the Québécois dialect.) The weak schwa vowel disappeared. Then the voiceless was voiced to , thereby creating . Next, the at the beginning of a syllable in some regional dialects of French or even in very rapid speech in general weakened to become the semi-vowel written . The end result is the word transcribed as &quot;Joual&quot;.

==Most notable or stereotypical linguistic features==
Diphthongs are normally present where long vowels would be present in standard French. There is also the usage of &quot;sontaient, sonté&quot; (&quot;ils étaient, ils ont été&quot;).

Although &quot;moé&quot; and &quot;toé&quot; are today considered substandard slang pronunciations of &quot;moi&quot; and &quot;toi&quot;, these were the original pronunciations of &quot;ancien régime&quot; French used in all provinces of Northern France, by the royalty, aristocracy, and common people. After the 1789 French Revolution, the standard pronunciation in France changed to that of a previously-stigmatized form in the speech of Paris, but Quebec French continued to evolve from the historically older dialects, having become isolated from France following the 1760 British conquest of New France.

&quot;Joual&quot; shares many features with modern Oïl languages, such as Norman, Gallo, Picard, Poitevin and Saintongeais though its affinities are greatest with the 17th century koiné of Paris. Speakers of these languages of France predominated among settlers to New France.
It could be argued that at least some aspects of more modern &quot;Joual&quot; are further linguistic contractions of standard French. &quot;D&#x27;la&quot; (&quot;de la&quot;) is an example where the word &quot;de&quot; has nearly fallen out of usage over time and has become contracted. This argument does apply to other words, and this phenomenon has become widespread throughout contemporary French language.

A defining characteristic of the sociolect is the deliberate use of the pronoun &quot;tu&quot; to indicate a question. The pronoun maintains its traditional usage, that of representing the second person singular, but is also used in conjunction with a verb, to indicate a question. &quot;Tu&quot; is used, for this purpose, regardless of the technically relevant grammatical person. This is because &quot;tu&quot;, in this use-case, is a contraction of the antiquated &quot;t-il&quot; particle originating from 13th century France, which was used to indicate a question. For example, in metropolitan french, a question may be asked as simply &quot;Veut-il manger?&quot; whereas in Joual, it may be asked as &quot;Il veux-tu manger?&quot;

Another significant characteristic of &quot;Joual&quot; is the liberal use of profanities called &quot;sacre&quot; in everyday speech.

===Words of English origin===

There are a number of English loanwords in &quot;Joual&quot;, although they have been stigmatized since the 1960s, instead favoring alternative terms promoted by the &quot;Office québécois de la langue française&quot;. The commonality of English loanwords in &quot;Joual&quot; is attributed to the unilingually anglophone nature of the factory owners, business higher-ups, and industrial supervisors which employed the majority of French-speaking blue-collar workers throughout 20th century. This need to use English in workplace environments, when referring to technical elements of the worker&#x27;s labour, caused the gradual integration of English loanwords into French. These words would eventually come to be conjugated and integrated as though they were traditionally French words (such as &quot;Check&quot; becoming the verb &quot;Chequer&quot;). The usage of deprecated anglicisms varies both regionally and historically. In the table below are a few common &quot;Joual&quot; words of English origin. 

Some words were also previously thought to be of English origin, although modern research has shown them to be from regional French dialects:
* Pitoune (log, cute girl, loose girl): previously thought to come from &quot;happy town&quot; although the word &quot;pitchoune&quot; exists in dialects from southern France (possibly coming from the Occitan word &quot;pichona&quot;, &quot;little girl&quot;), now used to mean &quot;cute girl&quot;.
* Poutine: was thought to come from &quot;pudding&quot;, but some have drawn a parallel with the Occitan language (also called Provençal or Languedoc) term &quot;podinga&quot;, a stew made of scraps, which was the previous use of the term in Montreal.

===Glossary===
== In popular culture ==
The two-act play &quot;Les Belles-sœurs&quot; by Canadian writer Michel Tremblay premiered in 1968 at the Théâtre du Rideau Vert in Montreal. Many consider it to have had a profound impact on Canadian culture, as it was one of the first times &quot;Joual&quot; was seen on a national stage. The play follows a working-class woman named Germaine in Montréal. After winning a million trading stamps, she invites her friends over to help paste them into booklets to redeem them. But Germaine is unsuspecting of her jealous friends who are envious of her winnings. The fact that the play was originally written in &quot;Joual&quot; is very important to the socio-linguistic aspect of the women. The characters all come from the working class and for the most part, speak in &quot;Joual&quot;, which at the time was not seen on the main stage. The play was cited at the time as a &quot;radical element among Quebec critics as the dawn of a new era of liberation, both political and aesthetic&quot;.

When &quot;Les Belles-sœurs&quot; premiered in Paris, France in 1973 as it was originally written, in &quot;Joual&quot;, it was met with some initial criticism. One critic described it as difficult to understand as ancient Greek. Tremblay responded, &quot;a culture should always start with speak to herself. The ancient Greeks spoke to each other&quot;. The popularity of the play has since caused it to be translated into multiple languages, raising controversies in the translation community over retaining the authenticity of &quot;Les Belles-sœurs&quot; even when not performed in the original dialect of &quot;Joual&quot;.

Writing in &quot;Joual&quot; gave Tremblay an opportunity to resist cultural and linguistic &quot;imperialism&quot; of France, while signifying the secularization of Québec culture.

<doc id="16534" wikidata="Q6119506" url="?curid=16534" title="Jacob and Esau">
<text>The biblical Book of Genesis speaks of the relationship between fraternal twins Jacob and Esau, sons of Isaac and Rebekah. The story focuses on Esau&#x27;s loss of his birthright to Jacob and the conflict that ensued between their descendant nations because of Jacob&#x27;s deception of their aged and blind father, Isaac, in order to receive Esau&#x27;s birthright/blessing from Isaac.

This conflict was paralleled by the affection the parents had for their favored child: &quot;Isaac, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.&quot; Even since conception, their conflict was foreshadowed: &quot;And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of the Lord. And the Lord said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.&quot;

Genesis 25:26 states that Esau was born before Jacob, who came out holding on to his older brother&#x27;s heel as if he was trying to pull Esau back into the womb so that he could be firstborn. The name Jacob means &quot;he grasps the heel&quot; which is a Hebrew idiom for deceptive behavior.

==Birthright==

In Genesis, Esau returned to his brother, Jacob, being famished from the fields. He begged his twin brother to give him some &quot;red pottage&quot; (paralleling his nickname, , &quot;adom&quot;, meaning &quot;red&quot;). Jacob offered to give Esau a bowl of stew in exchange for his birthright (the right to be recognized as firstborn) and Esau agreed.

The birthright (&quot;bekorah&quot;) has to do with both position and inheritance. By birthright, the firstborn son inherited the leadership of the family and the judicial authority of his father. Deuteronomy 21:17 states that he was also entitled to a double portion of the paternal inheritance.

In the interpretation of Daniel J. Elazar, Esau acts impulsively: &quot;Esau demonstrates that he does not deserve to be the one who continues Abraham&#x27;s responsibilities and rewards under God&#x27;s covenant, since he does not have the steady, thoughtful qualities which are required... Jacob shows his willingness as well as his greater intelligence and forethought... What he does is not quite honorable, though not illegal. The title that he gains is at least partially valid, although he is insecure enough about it to conspire later with his mother to deceive his father so as to gain the blessing for the first-born as well.&quot;

Later, Esau marries two wives, both Hittite women, that is, locals, in violation of Abraham&#x27;s (and God&#x27;s) injunction not to take wives from among the Canaanite population. Again, one gets the sense of a headstrong person who acts impulsively, without sufficient thought. His marriage is described as a vexation to both Rebekah and Isaac. Even his father, who has strong affection for him, is hurt by his act. According to Daniel J. Elazar this action alone forever rules out Esau as the bearer of patriarchal continuity. Esau could have overcome the sale of his birthright; Isaac was still prepared to give him the blessing due the firstborn. But acquiring foreign wives meant the detachment of his children from the Abrahamic line. Despite the deception on the part of Jacob and his mother to gain Isaac&#x27;s patriarchal blessing, Jacob&#x27;s vocation as Isaac&#x27;s legitimate heir in the continued founding of the Jewish people is reaffirmed.

Elazar suggests the Bible indicates that a bright, calculating person, even if he is less than honest at times, is preferable as a founder over a bluff, impulsive one who cannot make discriminating choices.

==Blessing of the firstborn==

Pronouncing the blessing was considered to be the act formally acknowledging the firstborn as the principal heir.

In Genesis 27:5–7, Rebecca overhears Isaac tell Esau, &quot;Bring me venison and prepare a savoury food, that I may eat, and bless thee before the before my death.&quot; Rebecca counsels Jacob to pretend to be Esau, in order to obtain the blessing in his brother&#x27;s stead. He dressed himself in Esau&#x27;s best clothes and disguised himself by covering his arms in lamb skin so that if his blind father touched him, he would think Jacob his more hirsute brother. Jacob brought Isaac a dish of goat meat prepared by Rebecca to taste like venison. Isaac then bestowed the blessing (&quot;bekhorah&quot;), which confers a prophetic wish for fertility (vv. 27–28) and dominion (v.29), on Jacob before Esau&#x27;s return.

Esau is furious and vows to kill Jacob as soon as their father has died. Rebecca intervenes to save her younger son Jacob from being murdered by her elder son, Esau. At Rebecca&#x27;s urging, Jacob flees to a distant land to work for his mother&#x27;s brother, Laban. She explains to Isaac that she has sent Jacob to find a wife among her own people.

Jacob does not immediately receive his father&#x27;s inheritance. Jacob, having fled for his life, leaves behind the wealth of Isaac&#x27;s flocks and land and tents in Esau&#x27;s hands. Jacob is forced to sleep out on the open ground and then work for wages as a servant in Laban&#x27;s household. Jacob, who had deceived his father, is in turn deceived and cheated by his uncle Laban concerning Jacob&#x27;s seven years of service (lacking money for a dowry) for the hand of Laban&#x27;s daughter Rachel, receiving his older daughter Leah instead. However, despite Laban, Jacob eventually becomes so rich as to incite the envy of Laban and Laban&#x27;s sons.

==Reconciliation==

Genesis 32-33 tells of Jacob and Esau&#x27;s eventual meeting according to God&#x27;s commandment in Genesis 31:3 and 32:10 after Jacob had spent more than 20 years staying with Laban in Padan-Aram. The two men prepare for their meeting like warriors about to enter into battle. Jacob divides his family into two camps such that if one is taken the other might escape. Jacob sends messengers to Esau, as well as gifts meant to appease him.

Jacob gets the name &quot;Israel&quot; after he wrestles with the Angel of God as he is traveling to Esau. His hip is knocked out of joint but he keeps on wrestling and gains the name.

After the encounter with the angel, Jacob crosses over the ford Jabbok and encounters Esau who seems initially pleased to see him, which attitude of favour Jacob fosters by means of his gift. Esau refuses the gift at first but Jacob humbles himself before his brother and presses him to take it, which he finally does. However, Jacob evidently does not trust his brother&#x27;s favour to continue for long, so he makes excuses to avoid traveling to Mount Seir in Esau&#x27;s company, and he further evades Esau&#x27;s attempt to put his own men among Jacob&#x27;s bands and finally completes the deception of his brother yet again by going to Succoth and then to Shalem, a city of Shechem, instead of following Esau at a distance to Seir. George Savran suggests that Jacob&#x27;s avoidance of Esau is a metaphor for Israel being separate from their enemies such as Edom or an indicator of Jacob&#x27;s reserved personality. The next time Jacob and Esau meet is at the burial of their father, Isaac, in Hebron.

==Views of the birthright==
The narrative of Esau selling his birthright to Jacob, in Genesis 25, states that Esau despised his birthright. However, it also alludes to Jacob being deceitful.

In Esau&#x27;s mother and father&#x27;s eyes, the deception may have been deserved. Rebecca later abets Jacob in receiving his father&#x27;s blessing disguised as Esau. Isaac then refuses to take Jacob&#x27;s blessing back after learning he was tricked, and does not give this blessing to Esau but, after Esau begs, gives him an inferior blessing.

Justus Knecht comments that: &quot;&quot;The Wisdom of God&quot;, which makes good come out of evil, can be learnt from this story. Almighty God had from the beginning, or rather from all eternity, chosen Jacob to be the heir of His promises. The faults of men (such as Isaac&#x27;s preference for Esau, Jacob&#x27;s deceit, and Esau&#x27;s hatred) could not alter what He had ordained; on the contrary, they served, under the divine guidance, for the accomplishment of it. Jacob, especially, was strengthened in confidence in God, and purified by the very consequences of his deceit, his long exile and servitude. He was by them confirmed in humility and piety, and trained to be a holy man of God, and the worthy heir of the promises.&quot;

== In comparative mythology ==
The common motive of the vast number of world mythologies (especially in the Proto-Indo-European mythology) is a fight between the twins (or just brothers) in which the death of one creates the world or precedes an important event (e.g. Romulus and Remus, Cain and Abel). Moreover, in the Ashanti Region, a story about the supreme god Nyame and his two sons resembles this exact story. He intended to give the more fertile land to his elder son Bia, and the rest to Bia&#x27;s brother Tano. Nyame sent his goat to tell his sons to come to him for their inheritance. The goat preferred Tano to Bia and told him to disguise himself as Bia and go to Nyame very early in the morning. When Nyame realized what had happened, it was too late to fix the error. Note that the goat soup and the goat skin is mentioned in the Esau and Jacob story. 

The Soninke people of Mauritania have a story that also resembles the Jacob and Esau narrative. In it, king Mama Dinga sends his servant to bring him his eldest son after midnight so that he could tell him things he needed to know, as he felt he would die soon. As the servant was mistreated by all of his sons, except by the youngest one, he decided to tell him to disguise himself in his brother&#x27;s robe and wear his arm ring. In this way, he tricked his blind father.

<doc id="16535" wikidata="Q155768" url="?curid=16535" title="Joseph Lister">
<text>Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister, (5 April 1827 – 10 February 1912) was a British surgeon, medical scientist, experimental pathologist and pioneer of antiseptic surgery and preventive healthcare. Joseph Lister revolutionised the craft of surgery in the same manner that John Hunter revolutionised the science of surgery.

From a technical viewpoint, Lister was not an exceptional surgeon, but his research into bacteriology and infection in wounds revolutionised surgery throughout the world.

Lister&#x27;s contributions were four-fold. Firstly, as a surgeon at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, he introduced carbolic acid (modern-day phenol) as a steriliser for surgical instruments, patients&#x27; skins, sutures, surgeons&#x27; hands, and wards, promoting the principle of antiseptics. Secondly, he researched the role of inflammation and tissue perfusion in the healing of wounds. Thirdly, he advanced diagnostic science by analyzing specimens using microscopes. Fourthly, he devised strategies to increase the chances of survival after surgery. His most important contribution, however, was recognising that putrefaction in wounds is caused by germs, in connection to Louis Pasteur&#x27;s then-novel germ theory of fermentation.

Lister&#x27;s work led to a reduction in post-operative infections and made surgery safer for patients, leading to him being distinguished as the &quot;father of modern surgery&quot;.
==Early life==
Lister was born to a prosperous, educated Quaker family in the village of Upton, then near but now in London, England. He was the fourth child and second son of four sons and three daughters born to gentleman scientist and wine merchant Joseph Jackson Lister and school assistant Isabella Lister née Harris. The couple married in a ceremony held in Ackworth, West Yorkshire on 14 July 1818.

Lister&#x27;s paternal great-great-grandfather, Thomas Lister was the last of several generations of farmers who lived in Bingley in West Yorkshire. Lister joined the Society of Friends as a young man and passed his beliefs on to his son, Joseph Lister. He moved to London in 1720 to open a tobacconist&#x27;s shop in Aldersgate Street in the City of London. His son, John Lister, was born there. Lister&#x27;s grandfather was apprenticed to watchmaker Isaac Rogers, in 1752 and followed that trade on his own account in Bell Alley, Lombard Street from 1759 to 1766. He then took over his father&#x27;s tobacco business, but gave it up in 1769 in favour of working at his father-in-law Stephen Jackson&#x27;s business as a wine-merchant at No 28 Old Wine and Brandy Values on Lothbury Street, opposite Tokenhouse Yard.

His father was a pioneer in the design of achromatic object lenses for use in compound microscopes He spent 30 years perfecting the microscope, and in the process, discovered the Law of Aplanatic Foci, building a microscope where the image point of one lens coincided with the focal point of another. Up until that time, the best higher magnification lenses produced an excessive secondary aberration known as a coma, which interfered with normal use. It was considered a major advance that elevated histology into an independent science. By 1832, Lister&#x27;s work had built a reputation sufficient to enable his being elected to the Royal Society. His mother, Isabella, was the youngest daughter of master mariner Anthony Harris. Isabella worked at the Ackworth School, a Quaker school for the poor, assisting her widowed mother, the superintendent of the school.

The eldest daughter of the couple was Mary Lister. On 21 August 1851, she married the barrister Rickman Godlee of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn and the Middle Temple, who belonged to the Friends meeting house in Plaistow. The couple had six children. Their second child was Rickman Godlee, a neurosurgeon who became Professor of Clinical Surgery at the University College Hospital and surgeon to Queen Victoria. He became Lister&#x27;s biographer in 1917. The eldest son of Joseph and Isabella Lister was John Lister, who died of a painful brain tumour. With John&#x27;s death, Joseph became the heir of the family. The couple&#x27;s second daughter was Isabella Sophia Lister, who married Irish Quaker Thomas Pim in 1848. Lister&#x27;s other brother William Henry Lister died after a long illness. The youngest son was Arthur Lister, a wine merchant, botanist and lifelong Quaker, who studied Mycetozoa. He worked alongside his daughter Gulielma Lister to produce the standard monograph on Mycetozoa. By 1898, Lister&#x27;s work had built a reputation sufficient to enable his election to the Royal Society. Gulielma Lister, a talented artist, later updated the standard monograph with colour drawings. Her work built a reputation sufficient to be elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1904. She becoming its vice-president in 1929. The couple&#x27;s last child was Jane Lister; she married widower Smith Harrison, a wholesale tea merchant.

After their marriage, the Listers lived at 5 Tokenhouse Yard in Central London for three years until 1822, where they ran a port wine business in partnership with Thomas Barton Beck.
Beck was the grandfather of the professor of surgery and proponent of the germ theory of disease, Marcus Beck, who would later promote Lister&#x27;s discoveries in his fight to introduce antiseptics. In 1822, Lister&#x27;s family moved to Stoke Newington. In 1826, the family moved to Upton House, a long low Queen Anne style mansion that came with 69 acres of land. It had been rebuilt in 1731, to suit the style of the period.

==Education==
===School===
As a child, Lister had a stammer and this was possibly why he was educated at home until he was eleven. Lister then attended Isaac Brown and Benjamin Abbott&#x27;s Academy, a private Quaker school in Hitchin, Hertfordshire. When Lister was thirteen, he attended Grove House School in Tottenham, also a private Quaker School to study mathematics, natural science, and languages. His father was insistent that Lister received a good grounding in French and German, in the knowledge he would learn Latin at school. From an early age, Lister was strongly encouraged by his father and would talk about his father&#x27;s great influence later in life, particularly in encouraging him in his study of natural history. Lister&#x27;s interest in natural history led him to study bones and to collect and dissect small animals and fish that were examined using his father&#x27;s microscope and then drawn using the camera lucida technique that his father had explained to him, or sketched. His father&#x27;s interests in microscopical research developed in Lister the determination to become a surgeon and prepared him for a life of scientific research. None of Lister&#x27;s relatives were in the medical profession. According to Godlee, the decision to become a physician seemed to be an entirely spontaneous decision.

In 1843 his father decided to send him to university. As Lister was unable to attend either University of Oxford or the University of Cambridge owing to the religious tests that effectively barred him, he decided to apply to the non-sectarian University College London Medical School (UCL), one of only a few institutions in Great Britain that accepted Quakers at that time. Lister took the public examination in the junior class of botany, a required course that would enable him to matriculate. Lister left school in the spring of 1844 when he was seventeen.

===University===
In 1844, just before Lister&#x27;s seventeenth birthday, he moved to an apartment at 28 London Road that he shared with Edward Palmer, also a Quaker. Between 1844 and 1845, Lister continued his pre-matriculation studies, in Greek, Latin and natural philosophy. In the Latin and Greek classes, he won a &quot;Certificate of Honour&quot;. For the experimental natural philosophy class, Lister won first prize and was awarded a copy of Charles Hutton&#x27;s &quot;Recreations in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy&quot;.

Although his father wanted him to continue his general education, the university had demanded since 1837, that each student obtain a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree before commencing medical training. Lister matriculated in August 1845, initially studying for a BA in classics. Between 1845 and 1846, Lister studied the mathematics of natural philosophy, mathematics and Greek earning a &quot;Certificate of Honour&quot; in each class. Between 1846 and 1847, Lister studied both anatomy and atomic theory (chemistry) and won a prize for his essay. On 21 December 1846, Lister and Palmer attended Robert Liston&#x27;s famous operation where ether was applied by Lister&#x27;s classmate, William Squire to anaesthetise a patient for the first time. On 23 December 1847, Lister and Palmer moved to 2 Bedford Place and were joined by John Hodgkin, the nephew of Thomas Hodgkin who discovered Hodgkin lymphoma. Lister and Hodgkin had been school friends.

In December 1847, Lister graduated with a degree of Bachelor of Arts 1st division, with a distinction in classics and botany. While he was studying, Lister suffered from a mild bout of smallpox, a year after his elder brother died of the disease. The bereavement combined with the stress of his classes led to a nervous breakdown in March 1848. Lister&#x27;s nephew Godlee used the term to describe the situation and is perhaps indicative that adolescence was just as difficult in 1847, as it is now. Lister decided to take a long holiday to recuperate and this delayed the start of his studies. In late April 1848, Lister visited the Isle of Man with Hodgkin and by 7 June 1848, he was visiting Ilfracombe. At the end of June, Lister accepted an invitation to stay in the home of Thoman Pim, a Dublin Quaker. Using it as his base, Lister travelled throughout Ireland. On 1 July 1848, Lister received a letter full of warmth and love from his father where his last meeting was &quot;...sunshine after a refreshing shower, following a time of cloud&quot; and advised him to &quot;cherish a pious cheerful spirit, open to see and to enjoy the bounties and the beauties spread around us :—not to give way to turning thy thoughts upon thyself nor even at present to dwell long on serious things&quot;. From 22 July 1848, for more than a year, the record is blank.

===Medical student===
Lister registered as a medical student in the winter of 1849 and became active in the University Debating Society and the Hospital Medical Society. In the autumn of 1849, he returned to college with a microscope given to him by his father. After completing courses in anatomy, physiology and surgery, he was awarded a &quot;Certificate of Honours&quot;, winning the silver medal in anatomy and physiology and a gold medal in botany.

His main lecturers were John Lindley professor of botany, Thomas Graham professor of chemistry, Robert Edmond Grant professor of comparative anatomy, George Viner Ellis professor of anatomy and William Benjamin Carpenter professor of medical jurisprudence. Lister often spoke highly of Lindley and Graham in his writings, but Wharton Jones professor of ophthalmic medicine and surgery, and William Sharpey professor of physiology, exercised the greatest influence on him. He was greatly attracted by Dr. Sharpey&#x27;s lectures, which inspired in him a love of experimental physiology and histology that never left him.

Thomas Henry Huxley praised Wharton Jones for the method and quality of his physiology lectures. As a clinical scientist working in physiological sciences, he was foremost in the number of discoveries he made. He was also considered a brilliant ophthalmic surgeon, his main field. He conducted research into the circulation of blood and the phenomena of inflammation, carried out on the frog&#x27;s web and the bat&#x27;s wing, and no doubt suggested this method of research to Lister. Sharpey was called the &quot;father of modern physiology&quot; as he was the first to give a series of lectures on the subject. Prior to that the field had been considered part of anatomy. Sharpey studied at Edinburgh University, then went to Paris to study clinical surgery under French anatomist Guillaume Dupuytren and operative surgery under Jacques Lisfranc de St. Martin. Sharpey met Syme while in Paris and became the two became life-long friends. After he moved to Edinburgh he taught anatomy with Allen Thomson as his physiological colleague. He left Edinburgh in 1836, to become the first Professor of Physiology.

====Clinical instruction====

To qualify for his degree, Lister had to complete two years of clinical instruction, and began his residency at University College Hospital in October 1850. as an intern and then house physician to Walter Hayle Walshe, professor of pathological anatomy and author of the 1846 study, &quot;The Nature and Treatment of Cancer&quot;. Lister in 1850 again received &quot;Certificates of Honours&quot; and won two gold medals in anatomy and a silver medal each in surgery and medicine.

In his second year in 1851, Lister became first a dresser in January 1851 then a house surgeon to John Eric Erichsen in May 1851. Erichsen was professor of surgery and author of the 1853 &quot;Science and Art of Surgery&quot;, described as one of the most celebrated English-language textbooks on surgery. The book went through many editions; Marcus Beck edited the eighth and ninth, adding Lister&#x27;s antiseptic techniques and Pasteur and Robert Koch&#x27;s germ theory.

Lister&#x27;s first case notes were recorded on 5 February 1851. As a dresser, his immediate superior was Henry Thompson, who recalled &quot;..a shy Quaker...I remember that he had a better microscope than any man in the college&quot;.

Lister had only just begun working in his role as dresser to Erichsen in January 1851, when an epidemic of erysipelas broke out in the male ward. An infected patient from an Islington workhouse was left in Erichsen&#x27;s surgical ward for two hours. The hospital had been free of infection but within days there were twelve cases of infection and four deaths. In his notebook, Lister stated that the disease was a form of surgical fever, and particularly noted that recent surgical patients were infected the worst, but that those with older surgeries with suppurating wounds, &#x27;mostly escaped&#x27;. It was while Lister worked for Erichsen, that his interest in the healing of wounds began. Erichsen was a miasmist who thought the wounds became infected from &quot;miasmas&quot; from the wound itself that caused a noxious form of &quot;bad air&quot; that spread to other patients in the ward. Erichsen believed that seven patients with an infected wound had saturated of the ward with &quot;bad air&quot;, which spread to cause gangrene. However Lister saw that some wounds, when debrided and cleaned, would sometimes heal. He believed that something in the wound itself was at fault.

When he became a house surgeon, Lister had patients put in his charge. For the first time, he came into contact face-to-face with various forms of blood-poisoning diseases like pyaemia and hospital gangrene, which rots living tissue with a remarkable rapidity. While examining in an autopsy an excision of the elbow of a little boy who had died of pyaemia, Lister noticed that a thick yellow-pus was present at the seat of the humerus bone, and distended the brachial and axillary veins. He also noticed that the pus advanced in the reverse direction along the veins, bypassing the valves in the veins. He also found suppuration in a knee-joint and multiple abscesses in the lungs. Lister knew that Charles-Emmanuel Sédillot had discovered that multiple abscesses in the lungs were caused by introducing pus into the veins of an animal. At the time he could not explain the facts but believed the pus in the organs had a metastatic origin. On 2 October 1900, during The Huxley Lecture, Lister described how his interest in the germ theory of disease and how it applied to surgery began with his investigation into the death of that little boy.

There was an epidemic of gangrene during his surgeoncy. The treatment method was to chloroform the patient, scrape the soft slough off and burn the necrotic flesh away with mercury pernitrate Occasionally the treatment would succeed, but when a grey film appeared at the edges of the wound, it presaged death. In one patient, the repeated treatment failed several times, so Erichsen amputated the limb, which healed fine. Lister recognised was that the disease was a &quot;local poison&quot; and probably parasitic in nature. He examined the diseased tissues under his microscope. He saw peculiar objects that he could not identify, as he had no frame of reference to draw conclusions from these observations. In his notebook he recorded:

I imagined they might be the materies morbi in the form of some kind of fungus.

Lister wrote two papers on the epidemics; but both were lost: &quot;Hospital gangrene&quot; and &quot;Microscope&quot;. They were read to the Student Medical Society at UCL.

====Lister&#x27;s first operation====
On 26 June 2013, medical historian Ruth Richardson and orthopaedic surgeon Bryan Rhodes published a paper in which they described their discovery of Lister&#x27;s first operation, made while both were researching his career. At 1pm on 27 June 1851, Lister, a second-year medical student working at a casualty ward in Gower Street, conducted his first operation. Julia Sullivan, a mother of eight grown children, had been stabbed in the abdomen by her husband, a drunk and ne&#x27;er-do-well, who was taken into custody. On 15 September 1851, Lister was called as a witness to the husband&#x27;s trial at the Old Bailey. His testimony helped convict the husband, who was transported to Australia for 20 years.

About a yard of small intestine about eight inches across, damaged in two places, protruded from the woman&#x27;s lower abdomen, which had three open wounds. After cleaning the intestines with blood-warm water, Lister was unable to place them back into the body, so he decided to extend the cut. then placed them back into the abdomen, and sewed and sutured the wounds shut. He administered opium to induce constipation and enable the intestines to recover. Sullivan recovered her health. This was a full decade before his first public operation in the Glasgow Infirmary.

This operation was missed by historians. Liverpool consultant surgeon John Shepherd, in his essay on Lister, &quot;Joseph Lister and abdominal surgery&quot;, written in 1968, failed to mention the operation, and instead started his account from the 1860s onwards. He apparently was unaware of this surgery.

====Microscope experiments 1852====
=====Observations on the Contractile Tissue of the Iris=====
Lister&#x27;s first paper, written while he was still at university, was published in the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science&quot; in 1853.

On 11 August 1852, Lister attended an operation at University College Hospital by Wharton Jones, who presented him with a fresh slice of human iris. Lister took the opportunity to study the iris. He reviewed existing research and studied tissue from a horse, a cat, a rabbit and a guinea pig as well as six surgical specimens from patients who had undergone eye surgery. Lister was unable to complete his research to his satisfaction, due to his need to pass his final examination. He offered an apology in the paper:

The paper advanced the work of Swiss physiologist Albert von Kölliker, demonstrating the existence of two distinct muscles, the dilator and sphincter in the iris. This corrected the convictions of previous researchers that there was no dilator pupillae muscle.

=====Observations on the Muscular Tissue of the Skin=====
His next paper, an investigation into goose bumps, was published on 1 June 1853 in the same journal. Lister was able to confirm Kölliker&#x27;s experimental finding that in humans the smooth muscle fibres are responsible for making hair stand out from the skin, in contrast to other mammals, whose large tactile hairs are associated with striated muscle. Lister also demonstrated a new method of creating histological sections from the tissue of the scalp.

Lister&#x27;s microscopy skills were so advanced that he was able to correct the observations of German histologist Friedrich Gustav Henle, who mistook small blood vessels for muscle fibres. In each of the papers, he created camera lucida drawings so accurate that they could be used to scale and measure the observations.

Both papers attracted significant attention in Britain and abroad. Naturalist Richard Owen, an old friend of Lister&#x27;s father, was particularly impressed by them. Owen contemplated recruiting Lister for his department and forwarded him a thank-you letter on 2 August 1853. Kölliker was particularly pleased with the analysis that Lister had formulated. Kölliker made many trips to Britain, and eventually met Lister. They became life-long friends. Their close friendship was described in a letter by Kölliker on 17 November 1897, that Rickman Godlee chose to use to illustrate their relationship. Kölliker sent a letter to Lister when he was president of the Royal Society, congratulating him on receiving the Copley medal, fondly remembering old friends who had died, and celebrating his time in Scotland with Syme and Lister. Kölliker was 80 years old at the time.

===Graduation===
Lister graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine with honours in the autumn of 1852. During his final year, Lister won several prestigious awards heavily contested among the student body of London teaching hospitals. He won the Longridge Prize

that included a £40 stipend. He was also awarded a gold medal in structural and physiological botany. Lister won two of the four available gold medals in anatomy and physiology as well as surgery, which came with a scholarship of £50 a year for two years, for his second examination in medicine. In the same year, Lister passed the examination for the fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons, bringing to a close nine years of education.

Sharpey advised Lister to spend a month at the medical practice of his lifelong friend James Syme in Edinburgh and then visit medical schools in Europe for a longer period for training. Sharpey himself had been taught first in Edinburgh and later in Paris. Sharpey had met Syme, a teacher of clinical surgery widely considered the best surgeon in the United Kingdom while he was in Paris. Sharpey had gone to Edinburgh in 1818, along with many other surgeons since, due to the influence of John Hunter. Hunter had taught Edward Jenner, seen as the first surgeon to take a scientific approach to the study of medicine, known as the &quot;Hunterian method&quot; Hunter was an early advocate for careful investigation and experimentation, using the techniques of pathology and physiology to give himself a better understanding of healing than many of his colleagues. For example, his 1794 paper, &quot;A treatise on the blood, inflammation and gun-shot wounds&quot; was the first systematic study of swelling, discovering that inflammation was common to all diseases. Due to Hunter, surgery, then practised by hobbyists or amateurs, became a true scientific profession. As the Scottish universities taught medicine and surgery from a scientific viewpoint, surgeons who wished to emulate those techniques travelled there for training. Scottish universities had several other features that distinguished them from those in the south. They were inexpensive and did not require religious admissions tests, and thus attracted the most scientifically progressive students in Britain. The most important differentiator was that medical schools in Scotland had evolved from a scholarly tradition, where English medical schools relied on hospitals and practice. Experimental science had no practitioners at English medical schools and while Edinburgh University medical school was large and active at the time, southern medical schools were generally moribund, and their laboratory space and teaching materials inadequate. English medical schools also tended to view surgery as manual labour, not a respectable calling for a gentleman academic.

==Surgical profession 1854==
Before Lister&#x27;s studies of surgery, many people believed that chemical damage from exposure to &quot;bad air&quot;, or &quot;miasma&quot;, was responsible for infections in wounds. Hospital wards were occasionally aired out at midday as a precaution against the spread of infection via miasma, but facilities for washing hands or a patient&#x27;s wounds were not available. A surgeon was not required to wash his hands before seeing a patient; in the absence of any theory of bacterial infection, such practices were not considered necessary. Despite the work of Ignaz Semmelweis and Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., hospitals practised surgery under unsanitary conditions. Surgeons of the time referred to the &quot;good old surgical stink&quot; and took pride in the stains on their unwashed operating gowns as a display of their experience.

==Edinburgh 1853–1860==
===James Syme===
Syme, a well-established clinical lecturer at Edinburgh University for more than two decades before he met Lister, was considered the boldest and most original surgeon then living in Great Britain. He became a surgical pioneer during his career, preferring simpler surgical procedures, as he detested complexity, in the era that immediately preceded the introduction of anaesthesia.

In September 1823, at the age of 24, Syme made a name for himself by first performing an amputation at the hip-joint, the first in Scotland. Considered the bloodiest operation in surgery, Syme completed it in less than a minute, as speed was essential at that time, before anaesthesia. Syme became widely known and acclaimed for developing a surgical operation that became known as &quot;Syme amputation&quot;, an amputation at the ankle where the foot is removed and the heel pad is preserved. Syme was considered a scientific surgeon, as evidenced by his paper &quot;On the Power of the Periosteum to form New Bone&quot;, and became one of the first advocates of antiseptics.

===Arrival in Edinburgh===
In September 1853, Lister arrived in Edinburgh bearing letters of introduction from Sharpey to Syme. Lister was anxious about his first appointment but decided to settle in Edinburgh after meeting Syme, who embraced him with open arms, invited him to dinner, and offered him an opportunity to assist him in his private operations.

Lister was invited to Syme&#x27;s house &quot;Millbank&quot; in Morningside (now part of Astley Ainslie Hospital), where he met, amongst others, Agnes Syme, Syme&#x27;s daughter from another marriage and granddaughter of physician Robert Willis. While Lister thought that Agnes was not conventionally pretty, he admired her quickness of mind, her familiarity with medical practice, and her warmth. He became a frequent visitor to Millbank and met a much wider group of eminent people than he would have in London.

In the same month, Lister began assisting Syme at the University of Edinburgh In a letter to his father, Lister expressed surprise at the size of the infirmary and spoke about his impressions of Syme, &quot;..is larger than I expected to find it; there are 200 Surgical beds, and a large number in other departments. At University College Hospital there were only about 60 Surgical beds, so altogether a prospect appears to be opening of a very profitable stay here. ...Syme is, I suppose, the first of British surgeons, and to observe the practice and hear the conversation of such a man is of the greatest possible advantage&quot;. By October 1853, Lister decided to spend the winter in Edinburgh. Syme was so impressed by Lister, that after a month Lister became Syme&#x27;s supernumerary house surgeon at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and his assistant in his private hospital at Minto House in Chambers Street. As house surgeon, Lister assisted Syme during every operation, taking notes. It was a much-coveted position and gave Lister the option of choosing which of the ordinary cases he would attend. During this period, Lister presented a paper at the Royal Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical Society on the structure of cancellous exostoses that had been removed by Syme, demonstrating that the method of ossification of these growths is the same as that which occurs in epiphyseal cartilage.

In September 1854, Lister&#x27;s house surgeoncy appointment was finished. With the prospect of being out of a job, he spoke to his father about seeking a position at the Royal Free Hospital in London. However, Sharpey had written to Syme warning him that it was unlikely that Lister would be welcome at the Royal Free as he would have likely eclipsed Thomas H. Wakley, whose father held considerable sway at the hospital. Lister then made plans to tour Europe for a year. However, an opportunity presented itself with the death of noted infirmary surgeon and surgical lecturer at the Edinburgh Extramural School of Medicine Richard James Mackenzie. Mackenzie had been seen as a successor to Syme but had contracted cholera in Balbec in Scutari, Istanbul, while on a four-month volunteer sabbatical as field surgeon to the 79th Highlanders during the Crimean War. Lister proposed to Syme that he take over Mackenzie&#x27;s position and become assistant surgeon to Syme. Syme initially rejected the idea, as Lister was not licensed to operate in Scotland, but later warmed to the idea. In October 1854, Lister was appointed as a lecturerLister successfully transferred the lease held by Mackenzie at his lecture room at 4 High School Yards, to himself. On 21 April 1855, Lister was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and two days later rented a home at 3 Rutland Square. In June 1855, Lister made a hurried trip to Paris to take a course on operative surgery on the dead body and returned in June.

===Extramural lecturing===

On 7 November 1855, Lister gave his first extramural lecture on the &quot;Principles and Practice of Surgery&quot;, in a lecture theatre at 4 High School Yards known as Old Jerusalem, directly located across from the infirmary. His first lecture was read from 21 pages of foolscap folio. Lister&#x27;s first lectures were based on notes, either read or spoken, but over time he used notes less and less, becoming extempore in his speech, slowly and deliberately forming his argument as he went along. With this deliberate way of speaking, he managed to overcome a slight, occasional stammer which in his early days had been more pronounced.

His first student was John Batty Tuke, in a class of nine or ten, mostly consisting of dressers. Within a week, twenty-three people had joined. In the next year, only eight people turned up. In the summer of 1858, Lister had the ignominious experience of reading his lecture to a single student, who arrived ten minutes late. Seven more students arrived later.

His first lecture focused on the concept of surgery, giving a definition of disease that linked it to the Hippocratic Oath. He then explained that surgery could have more benefits than medicine, which could only comfort the patient at best. He then explained the attributes a good surgeon should exhibit, before finishing the lecture by recommending Syme&#x27;s book &quot;Principles of Surgery&quot;. Lister completed 114 lectures that followed a standard syllabus. Lecture VII described his earliest experiment on inflammation, where he put mustard on his arm and watched the results. Lectures IV to IX dealt with the circulation of blood. Inflammation was discussed in lectures X to XIII. The second half of the course dealt with clinical surgery. For the last four days, he gave two lectures a day, to complete the event before his wedding, with the first course ending on 18 April 1856. In the summer of 1858, Lister started a second, completely separate course, where he lectured on surgical pathology and operative surgery.

===Marriage===
By mid-summer 1854, Lister had started to court Agnes Syme. Lister wrote to his parents about his love but they worried about the union, particularly since he was Quaker and Agnes had given no indication that she would change her denomination. At that time when a Quaker married a person of another denomination, it was considered as marrying &quot;out of the society&quot;. Lister was determined to marry Agnes and sent a further letter to his father, asking him if his financial support would continue should Lister and Agnes marry. Lister&#x27;s father replied that Agnes not being in the Society of Friends would not affect his pecuniary arrangements and offered his son extra money to buy furniture and suggested that Syme would offer a dowry and that he would negotiate with Syme directly on it. His father suggested that Lister voluntarily resign from the Society of Friends. Lister made up his mind and subsequently left the Quakers to become a Protestant, later joining the congregation of the Saint Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Jeffrey Street, Edinburgh. In August 1855, Lister became engaged to Agnes Syme and on 23 April 1856 married her in the drawing room of Millbank, Syme&#x27;s house in Morningside. Agnes&#x27;s sister stated that this was out of consideration of any Quaker relations. Only the Syme family were present. The Scottish physician and family friend John Brown toasted the couple after the reception.

The couple spent a month at Upton and the Lake District, followed by a three-month tour of the leading medical institutes in France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. They returned in October 1856. By this time, Agnes was enamoured with medical research and became Lister&#x27;s partner in the laboratory for the rest of her life. When they returned to Edinburgh, the couple moved into a rented house at 11 Rutland Street in Edinburgh. The house was situated over three floors with a study on the first floor, that was converted into a consulting room for patients and a room with hot and cold taps on the second floor that became his laboratory. The Scottish surgeon Watson Cheyne, who was almost a surrogate son to Lister, stated after his death that Agnes had entered into her work wholeheartedly, had been his only secretary, and that they discussed his work &quot;on an almost equal footing&quot;.

Lister&#x27;s books are full of Agnes&#x27; careful handwriting. Agnes would take dictation from Lister for
hours at a stretch. Spaces would be left blank amongst the reams of Agnes&#x27; handwriting for small diagrams, that Lister would create using the camera lucida technique and Agnes would later paste in.

===Assistant surgeoncy===
On 13 October 1856, he was unanimously elected to the position of Assistant at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. In 1856 he was also elected a member of the Harveian Society of Edinburgh.

===Contributions to physiology and pathology 1853–1859===
Between 1853 and 1859 in Edinburgh, Lister conducted a series of physiological and pathological experiments. His approach was rigorous and meticulous in both measurement and description. Lister was clearly aware of the latest advances in physiological research in France, Germany, and other European countries and maintained an ongoing discussion of his observations and results with other leading physicians in his peer group including Albert von Kölliker, Wilhelm von Wittich, Theodor Schwann, and Rudolf Virchow and ensured he correctly cited their work.

Lister&#x27;s primary instrument of research was his microscope and his primary research subjects were frogs. Before his honeymoon, the couple had visited his uncle&#x27;s house in Kinross. Lister took his microscope and captured several frogs, intending to use them in the study of inflammation, but they escaped. When he returned from his honeymoon, he used frogs captured from Duddingston Loch in his experiments. Lister carried out his experiments in his laboratory and in the veterinary college abattoir, on animals that were either dead or chloroformed and &quot;pithed&quot;, to deprive it of sensation. He also used bats, sheep, cats, rabbits, oxen and horses in his experiments. Lister&#x27;s tirelessness in his pursuit of knowledge was illustrated by his assistant Thomas Annandale, who stated:

These experiments resulted in the publication of eleven papers between 1857 and 1859. They included the study of the nervous control of arteries, the earliest stages of inflammation, the early stages of coagulation, the structure of nerve fibres, and the study of the nervous control of the gut with reference to sympathetic nerves. He continued these experiments for three years until he was appointed to a position at the University of Glasgow.

====1855: Beginning of inflammation research====
In a letter dated 16 September 1855, Lister recorded the beginnings of his research into inflammation, six weeks before his lectures were to begin. Later in life, Lister stated that he considered his research into inflammation to have been an &quot;essential preliminary&quot; to his conception of the antiseptic principle and insisted that these early findings be included in any memorial volume of his work. In 1905, when he was seventy-eight years old, he wrote,

Inflammation is defined by four symptoms, heat, redness, swelling and pain. Surgeons prior to Lister saw it as the signal for the arrival of suppuration or putrefaction, local or general infection. As the germ theory of disease had not yet been discovered, the concept of infection did not yet exist. However, Lister knew that slowing of the blood through the capillaries seemed to precede inflammation. Joseph Jackson Lister had written a paper with Thomas Hodgkin that described how blood cells behaved prior to a clot, i.e. specifically how the concave cells fitted themselves together into stacks. Lister knew that to observe the next step, it was important that the tissue remain alive so the blood vessels could be observed through the microscope.

In September 1855, Lister&#x27;s first experiment was on the artery of a frog viewed under his microscope, subjected to a water droplet of differing temperatures, to determine the early stage of inflammation. He initially applied a water droplet at which caused the artery to contract for a second and the flow to cease, then dilate as the area turned red and the flow of blood increased. He progressively increased the temperature to . The blood slowed down and then coagulated. He continued the experiment on the wing of a chloroformed bat to widen his research focus. Lister concluded that the contraction of the vessels led to the exclusion of blood cells from the capillaries, not their arrest, and that blood serum continued to flow. This was his first independent discovery.

The experiments ceased between October 1855 and continued in September 1856 when the couple moved into Rutland Square. Lister started with mustard as an irritant, then Croton oil, acetic acid, oil of Cantharidin and chloroform and many others. These experiments led to the production of three papers. His first paper grew out of the need to prepare for these extramural lectures and had begun the year before, continuing in development for six weeks after he moved into Rutland Street. The early paper, titled: &quot;On the early stages of inflammation as observed in the Foot of a Frog&quot; was read to the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh on 5 December 1856. The last third was read out extempore.

====1856 Beginning of coagulation research====
Lister also conducted research into the process of coagulation during this period. He had observed inflammation in certain cases of septicaemia that affected the blood vessel&#x27;s lining, and led to intravascular blood clotting, which led to putrefaction and secondary haemorrhage. A simple experiment in December 1856 described by Agnes, where he pricked his own finger to observe the process of coagulation. led to five physiology papers on coagulation between 1858 and 1863.

Several competing theories explained the occurrence of a blood clot, and although the theories were largely abandoned, it was still thought that blood contained a liquifying agent, i.e. fibrin held in a solution of ammonia that became known as the &quot;Ammonia theory&quot;.

In 1824, Charles Scudamore had proposed carbonic acid as the solution. The prevailing theory was from Benjamin Ward Richardson, who won the 1857 Astley Cooper triennial prize for an essay where he postulated that blood remained liquid due to the presence of ammonia. In the same year, Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke proposed that the vital actions of the vessels inhibited the blood&#x27;s natural tendency to coagulate.

====1856 On the minute structure of involuntary muscle fibre====
Lister&#x27;s third paper, published in 1858 in the same journal and read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 1 December 1856, concerned the histology and function of the minute structures of involuntary muscle fibres. The experiment, conducted in the autumn of 1856, was designed to confirm Kölliker&#x27;s observations on the structure of individual muscle fibres. Kölliker&#x27;s description had been criticised, as he had used needles to separate the tissue to observe individual cells, and his critics said that he had observed artefacts from the experiment rather than real muscle cells. Lister proved conclusively that the muscle fibres of blood vessels, described by Lister as slightly flattened and elongated, were similar to those found by Kölliker in pig intestine, but wrapped spirally and individually around the innermost membrane. He stated that the variations in shape, from long tubular bodies with pointed ends and elongated nuclei to short &quot;spindles&quot; with squat nuclei, represented different phases of muscular contraction. During the &quot;Huxley Lecture&quot; he stated in retrospect, that he could not imagine a more efficient mechanism to constrict these vessels.

====1857 On the flow of the lacteal fluid in the mesentery of the mouse====
His next paper was a short report based on observations that he had made in 1853. This first experiment, as opposed to purely microscope work, determined the nature of the flow of chyle in the lymphatics and whether the lacteals in the gastrointestinal wall could absorb solid granules from the lumen. For the first experiment, a mouse fed beforehand on bread and milk was chloroformed and then had its abdomen opened and a length of intestine placed on glass under a microscope. Lister repeated the experiment several times and each time saw mesenteric lymph flowing in a steady stream, without visible contractions of the lacteals. For the second experiment, Lister dyed some bread with indigo dye and fed it to a mouse, with the result that no indigo particles were ever seen in the chyle. Lister delivered the paper to the 27th meeting of the British Medical Association, held in Dublin 26 August to 2 September 1857. The paper was formally published in 1858 in the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science&quot;.

====Seven papers on the origin and mechanism of inflammation====
In 1858, Lister published seven papers on physiological experiments he conducted on the origin and mechanism of inflammation. Two of these papers were research into the neural control by the nervous system of blood vessels, &quot;An Inquiry Regarding the Parts of the Nervous System Which Regulate the Contractions of the Arteries&quot; and &quot;On the Cutaneous Pigmentary System of the Frog&quot;, while the third and the principal paper in the series was titled: &quot;On the Early Stages of Inflammation&quot;, which extended the research of Wharton Jones. The three papers were read to the Royal Society of London on 18 June 1857. They had originally been written as one paper and had been sent to Sharpey, John Goodsir and the English pathologist James Paget for review. However, Paget and Goodsir both recommended that it be published as three separate papers.

====1858 An Inquiry Regarding the Parts of the Nervous System Which Regulate the Contractions of the Arteries====
During 1856, Lister has been thinking about the nervous control of blood vessels and had been studying the work of various French researchers who were examining the denervation of the sympathetic nerves. Lister thought that how blood vessels behaved when irritated was important to understand the inflammatory process.

The experiments on vasomotor control began in the autumn of 1856 and continued until the autumn of the next year. In total, Lister conducted 13 experiments, some of which were repeated to verify the results of other experiments in the series. He used a microscope fitted with an ocular micrometer, a recent invention, to measure the diameter of blood vessels in a common frogs web. In a before and after experiment, he ablated parts of the central nervous system and also before and after, split the sciatic nerve. Lister concluded that blood vessel tone was controlled from the medulla oblongata and the spinal cord. This refuted Wharton&#x27;s conclusions, in his paper &quot;Observations on the State of the Blood and the Blood-Vessels in Inflammation.&quot; who was not able to confirm that the control of blood vessels of the hind legs was dependent upon spinal centres.

In October 1857, the referee for &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; John Goodsir wrote to Sharpey who warned Lister that the experimental conclusions were similar to findings by the German physiologist Eduard Friedrich Wilhelm Pflüger. This was to enable Lister to print an acknowledgement. Pflüger found that vasomotor control was through nerve fibres connected to the spinal canal which were similar to Lister research showing vaso-motor fibres came from the spinal canal through the sciatic plexus. Although their approaches were similar, Lister used denervation and discovered that even after parts of the spinal cord were removed, the arterioles eventually recovered their contractility.

These experiments settled a contemporary dispute between physiologists concerning the origin of the influence exercised over blood vessel diameter (calibre) by the sympathetic nervous system. The dispute began when Albrecht von Haller formulated a new theory known as &quot;Sensibility and Irritability&quot; in his 1752 thesis &quot;De partibus corporis humani sensibilibus et irritabilibus&quot;. The dispute had been debated since the middle of the 18th century. Haller put forward the view that contractability was a power inherent in the tissues which possessed it, and was a fundamental fact of physiology. It concerned the property of &quot;irratability&quot;, the supposed automatic response of muscular tissue, especially visceral tissue, to external stimulus, that caused them to contract when stimulated. Even as late as 1853, highly respected textbooks, for example William Benjamin Carpenter &quot;Principles of Human Physiology&quot; stated the doctrine of &#x27;irritability&#x27; was a fact beyond dispute, and this was still considered contentious when John Hughes Bennett created the &quot;Physiology&quot; article for the 8th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica in 1859.

====1858 On the Cutaneous Pigmentary System of the Frog====
The second part of the original paper was an experiment into the nature and behaviour of pigment. It had been known for some years that the skin of frogs is capable of varying in colour under different circumstances. The first account of this mechanism had been first described by Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke of Vienna in 1832 and later investigated further by Wilhelm von Wittich in 1854 and Emile Harless in 1947.

Lister had noted that the beginning of inflammation was always accompanied by a change of colour in the frog&#x27;s web. He determined that the pigments consisted of &quot;very minute pigment-granules&quot; contained in a network of stellate cells, the branches of which, subdividing minutely and anastomosing freely with one another and with those of neighbouring cells, constitute a delicate network in the substance of the true skin. It had been supposed that the concentration and diffusion of the pigment depended upon the contraction and extension of the branches of the star-shaped cells in which it was contained; and that only these movements of the cells were under the influence of the nervous system. At the time, there was no cell theory of matter nor were there any dyes or fixatives that could used to enhance experimental discovery. Indeed, Lister wrote of this, stating &quot;The extreme delicacy of the cell wall makes it very difficult to trace it among the surrounding tissue&quot;. Lister observed that it was the pigment granules themselves and not the cells that moved, and that this movement was not merely brought about by the control of the nervous system, but perhaps by the direct action of irritants on the tissues themselves. He believed that the pigment reflected the activity of blood vessels, though it was the slowing of blood flow that initiated the process of inflammation.

====1858 On the early stages of inflammation====
The focal study was the longest paper of the three and the last to be published. Like many of his colleagues, Lister was aware that inflammation was the first stage of many postoperative conditions and that excessive inflammation often preceded the onset of a septic condition. Once that happened, the patient would develop a fever. Lister had come to the conclusion that accurate knowledge of the functioning of inflammation could not be obtained by researching the more advanced stages, which were subject to secondary processes. He therefore started in quite a different way from that of almost all his predecessors by directing his enquiry to the very first deviations from health, hoping to find in them &quot;the essential character of the morbid state most unequivocally stamped&quot;. Essentially, Lister performed these experiments to discover the causes of erythrocyte adhesiveness. As well as experimenting on frogs&#x27; web and bats wing, Lister used blood that he had obtained from the end of his own finger that was inflamed and compared it against blood from one of his other fingers. He discovered that after something irritating had been applied to living tissues which did not kill them outright, firstly the blood vessels contracted and their lumen became very small; the part became pale. Secondly, the vessels after an interval, dilated and the part became red. Thirdly, some of the blood in the most injured blood vessels slowed down in its flow and coagulated. Redness occurred which, being solid, could not be pressed away. Lastly, the fluid of the blood passed through the vessel walls and formed a &quot;blister&quot; about the seat of injury. He found that each tiny artery was surrounded by a muscle, which enables it to contract and dilate. He found further that this contraction and dilation was not an individual act on its part, but was an act dictated to it by the nervous cells in the spinal cord.

The paper was divided into four sections:
* The aggregation of red blood cells when removed from the body, i.e., which occurs during coagulation.
:: This section deals with the aggregation of the cells of the blood, which occurs during the process of clotting. It shows that when blood is removed from the body this aggregation depends on their possessing a certain degree of mutual adhesiveness, which is much greater in the white blood cells than in the red blood cells. This property, though apparently not depending upon vitality, is capable of remarkable variations, in consequence of very slight chemical changes in the blood plasma.
* The structure and function of blood vessels.
:: This section shows that the arteries regulate, by their contractility, the amount of blood transmitted in a given time through the capillaries, but that neither full dilatation, extreme contraction, nor any intermediate state of the arteries, is capable per se of producing accumulation of blood cells in the capillaries.
* The effects of irritants on blood vessels, e.g., hot water.
::This section details how the effects are two-fold
:::* firstly, a dilatation of the arteries (commonly preceded by a brief period of contraction), which is developed through the nervous system and is not confined to the part brought into actual contact with the irritant, but implicates a surrounding area of greater or less extent; and
:::* secondly, an alteration in the tissues upon which the irritant directly acts, which makes them influence the blood in the same manner as does ordinary solid matter. This imparts adhesiveness to both the red and the white blood cells, making them prone to stick to one another and to the walls of the vessels, and so gives rise, if the damage to the tissues be severe, to stagnation of the blood flow and ultimately to obstruction.
* The effects of irritants on tissue.
:: The fourth section describes the effects of irritants upon the tissues. It proves that those which destroy the tissues when they act powerfully, produce by their gentler action only a condition bordering on loss of vitality, i.e. a condition in which the tissues are incapacitated, but from which they may recover, provided the irritation has not been too severe or protracted.

Lister&#x27;s paper was able to show that capillary action is governed by the constriction and dilation of the arteries. The action is affected by trauma, irritation or reflex action through the central nervous system. He noticed that although the capillary walls lack muscle fibres, they are very elastic and are subject to significant capacity variations that are influenced by arterial blood flow into the circulatory system. Drawings made with a camera lucida were used to depict the experimental reactions. They displayed vascular stasis and congestion in the early stages of the body&#x27;s reaction to damage. According to Lister, vascular alterations that were initially brought on by reflexes occurring within the nervous system were followed by changes that were brought on by local tissue damage. In the conclusions of the paper, Lister linked his experimental observations to physical clinical conditions, for example skin damage resulting from boiling water and trauma occurring after a surgical incision.

After the paper was read to the Royal Society in June 1857, it was very well received and his name became known outside Edinburgh.

====On a Case of Spontaneous Gangrene from Arteritis, and on the Causes of Coagulation of the Blood in Diseases of the Blood-Vessels====
Lister&#x27;s first paper is an account of a case of spontaneous gangrene in a child. The paper on coagulation was read before the Medico-Chirugical Society of Edinburgh on 18 March 1858. In an account written by Agnes, she states that there was no one at the medical school meeting who was capable of appreciating it, and the remarks made upon it were very poor. There were suggestions for improvement which Lister threw out. There was lots of cheering, proclaiming it a great success. The paper was written up at 7pm, with Lister dictating and Agnes writing it during a 50-minute session, followed by the exposition to the society at George Street hall at 8pm.

Lister first used the amputated legs from sheep and discovered that blood remained liquid in the blood vessels for up to six days and still underwent coagulation, albeit more slowly when the vessel was opened. He also noticed that if vessels remained fresh, the blood would remain fluid. In later experiments he moved to cats. He tried to emulate an inflamed blood vessel by exposing the jugular vein of the animal and applying irritants then constricting and opening the flow, to measure the effect. He noticed that in the damaged vessel the blood would coagulate He eventually came to the conclusion that if there was ammonia in the blood, it was much less important than the condition of the vessel in stopping coagulation. He tested his hypothesis on three cadavers by examining the condition of various veins and arteries and found he was correct. He also concluded that the Ammonia theory did not apply to vessels in the body, but it could apply to blood outside the body. While that was incorrect, his other conclusions were accurate. Specifically that inflammation in the blood vessel lining, results in coagulation occurring. Lister realised that vascular occlusion increased the pressure through the network of small vessels, leading to the formation of &quot;liquor sanguinis&quot; that lead to further localised damaged perfusion. Certainly, Lister had no knowledge of the coagulation cascade but his experiments contributed to the current understanding of clotting, the final product of coagulation.

Lister continued experimenting in April, examining vessels and blood from a horse. This resulted in another communication to the society on 7 April. His work in coagulation continued until the end of the year. Lister&#x27;s second article on coagulation was published in August 1858, and was one of two case histories he published in the Edinburgh Medical Journal in 1858. Titled: &quot;Case of Ligature of the Brachial Artery, Illustrating the Persistent Vitality of the Tissues&quot;. The history described saving a patient&#x27;s arm from being amputated which had been constricted by a tourniquet for thirty hours. The second history was titled &quot;Example of mixed Aortic Aneurysm&quot; and published in December 1858.

====1858 Preliminary account of an inquiry into the functions of the visceral nerves====
Lister continual interest in the nervous control of blood vessels led him to conduct a series of experiments during June and July 1858, where he researched the nervous control of the gut. The research was published in the form of three letters sent to Sharpey. The first two letters were sent on 28 June and 7 July 1858 The last letter was published as the &quot;Preliminary Account of an Inquiry into the Functions of the Visceral Nerves, with special reference to the so-called Inhibitory System.&quot;.

He had been studying the work of Claude Bernard, LJ Budge and Augustus Waller and had become interested in what was known as &quot;sympathetic action&quot;, where inflammation appeared in a different area from the source of irritation. This led him to study Pflüger&#x27;s 1857 paper titled &quot;About the inhibitory nervous system for the peristaltic movements of the intestines&quot;, proposed that the splanchnic nerves instead of exciting the intestine muscle layer that they are connected to, inhibit their movement. The German physiologist Eduard Weber made the same claim. Pflüger had named these inhibitory nerves &quot;Hemmungs-Nervensystem&quot;, a name that Syme, at Lister&#x27;s request thought they should be translated as &quot;inhibitory nervous system&quot;. Lister dismissed Pflüger&#x27;s idea of inhibitory nerves as not only implausible but not supported by observation, as a mild stimulus caused increased muscle activity which changed to a decreased muscle activity as the incoming stimulus became stronger. Lister believed that it was questionable whether the motions of the heart or the intestines are ever checked by the spinal system, except for very brief periods.

Lister conducted a series of experiments using mechanical irritation and galvanism to stimulate the nerves and spinal cord in rabbits and frogs. and due to rabbits active gut movement, he considered them ideal for the experiment. To ensure their gut reflexes were not impaired, the rabbits were not anaesthetised. Lister conducted three experiments. In the first experiment, an incision was made in the rabbit&#x27;s side and a section of intestine was pulled through the skin. Lister then connected a magnetic coil battery to the splanchnic nerves in the spinal cord. When the current was applied, the gut completely relaxed but when the current was applied locally, a small localised contraction occurred that did not spread to the bowel. Lister stated that &quot;this observation is of fundamental importance, since it proves that the inhibitory influence does not operate directly upon the muscular tissue, but upon the nervous apparatus by which its contractions are, under ordinary circumstances, elicited&quot;. In the second experiment, Lister examined the reaction in a section of the bowel, when he restricted the blood supply by tying the vessels and found that there was an increase in peristalsis. When he applied current the gut relaxed. He concluded that activity in the gut was under the control of bowel wall nerves and had been stimulated due to loss of blood. In the third experiment, he removed the nerves from a section of the bowel while ensuring to maintain a good blood supply. This time, stimulation of the section had no effect except when the section would spontaneously contract.

During the histological study of the bowel wall, Lister discovered a plexus of neurons the myenteric plexus, that confirmed the observations made by Georg Meissner in 1857.

Lister concluded, &quot;...it appears that the intestines possess an intrinsic ganglionic apparatus which is in all cases essential to the peristaltic movements, and, while capable of independent action, is liable to be stimulated or checked by other parts of the nervous system&quot;.

Although Lister did not believe in the inhibitory system, he did conclude that extrinsic nerves controlled the intestinal motor function indirectly through their effect on the plexus. It was not until 1964 that this was proven by Karl‐Axel Norberg.

====Notice of further researches on the coagulation of the blood====
Lister&#x27;s third paper on coagulation was a short article in the form of a communication consisting of five pages that were read before the Medico-Chirugical Society of Edinburgh on 16 November 1859. In the paper, Lister found that the coagulation of blood was not solely dependent on the presence of ammonia, but may also be influenced by other factors. In a demonstration before the society, Lister had a sample of horse&#x27;s blood that had been shed twenty-nine hours earlier and added acetic acid to it. The blood remained fluid despite being acidified, but it eventually coagulated after being left to stand for 15 minutes. Lister demonstrated that the Ammonia theory was incorrect as the coagulation of the blood was not dependent on the presence of ammonia. He concluded that other factors may influence blood coagulation in addition to or instead of ammonia, and that the Ammonia theory was fallacious.

===Glasgow appointment===
On 1 August 1859, Lister wrote to his father to inform him of the ill-health of James Adair Lawrie, Regius Professor of Surgery at the University of Glasgow, believing he was close to death. The anatomist Allen Thomson had written to Syme to inform him of Lawrie&#x27;s condition and that it was his opinion that Lister was the most suitable person for the position. Lister stated that Syme believed he should become a candidate for the position. He went on to discuss the merits of the post; a higher salary, being able to undertake more surgery and being able to create a bigger private practice. Lawrie died on 23 November 1859. In the following month, Lister received a private communication, although baseless, that confirmed he had received the appointment. However, it was clear the matter was not settled when a letter appeared in the Glasgow Herald on 18 January 1860 that discussed a rumour that the decision had been handed over to the Lord Advocate and officials in Edinburgh. The letter annoyed the members of the governing body of Glasgow University, the Senatus Academicus. The matter was referred to the Vice-Chancellor Thomas Barclay who tipped the decision in favour of Lister. On 28 January 1860, Lister&#x27;s appointment was confirmed.

==Glasgow 1860–1869==
===University life===
To be formally inducted into the academic staff, Lister had to deliver a Latin oration before the senatus academicus. In a letter to his father, he described how surprised he was when a letter arrived from Allen Thomson informing him that the thesis had to be presented the next day on 9 March. Lister unable to start the paper until 2 am that night, had only prepared around two-thirds of it, when he arrived in Glasgow. The rest was written at Thomson&#x27;s house. In the letter, he described the dread he felt being admitted into the room prior to presenting the oration. After the thesis was read and Lister was inducted to the senate, he signed a statement not to act contrary to the wishes of the Church of Scotland. While the contents of his thesis have been lost, the title is known, &quot;De Arte Chirurgica Recte Erudienda&quot; (&quot;On the proper way of teaching the art of surgery&quot;).

In early May 1860, the couple made the journey to Glasgow to move into their new house at 17 Woodside Place, at the time on the western edge of the city. In 1860, university life in Glasgow was lived in the grimy quadrangles of the small college on Glasgow High Street, a mile east of the city centre next to Glasgow Royal Infirmary (GRI) and the Cathedral and surrounded by the most squalid part of the old medieval city. The Scottish poet and novelist Andrew Lang wrote of his student days at the college, that while Coleridge could smell 75 different stenches during his student days in Cologne, Lang counted more. The city was so polluted the grass did not grow.

The position of Professor of Surgery at Glasgow was peculiar, as it did not carry with it an appointment as surgeon to the Royal Infirmary, as the university was separate from the hospital. The allotment of surgical wards to the care of the Professor of Surgery depended upon the goodwill of the directors of the infirmary. His predecessor Lawrie never held any hospital appointments at all. Having no patients to care for, Lister immediately began a summer lecture course. He discovered that college classrooms were considered too small and had low ceilings for the number of students, which made them unpleasant to be in when filled to overcrowding. Before his first lecture, the couple cleaned and painted the dingy lecture room assigned to them, at their own expense. He inherited a large class of students from his predecessor that grew rapidly.

After his first session, he wrote favourably of Glasgow:


In August 1860, Lister was visited by his parents, who took a &quot;saloon&quot; carriage on the Great Northern Railway. In September 1860, Marcus Beck came to live with the Listers and their two servants, while he studied medicine at the university. In the closing weeks of the summer, the Listers along with Beck, Lucy Syme and Ramsay went on a short holiday to Balloch, Loch Lomond. While the group was visiting Tarbet, Argyll, the men rowed across the loch and ascended Ben Lomond.

===Election to surgeoncy===
In August 1860, Lister had been rejected for a post at the Royal Infirmary by David Smith, a shoemaker who was the chairman of the hospital board. When Lister put his case to Smith explaining the need for anatomical demonstrations so the students could understand the practice of surgery, Smith stated his belief that &quot;the infirmary was a curative institution, not an educational one&quot;. The rejection both annoyed and surprised Lister as he had been promised by Thomson that the position was assured. Indeed, he had informed his father of the fact that the post was guaranteed in his letter to his father.

In November 1860, the winter lecture course began. In total 182 students registered for the lectures and according to Godlee it was likely the &quot;largest class of systematic surgery in Great Britain, if not in Europe&quot;. The class consisting of mostly 4th year students with some 3rd and 2nd year students, was so enthused, that they decided to make Lister the Honorary President of their Medical Society. When the time approached for the election to the surgeoncy in 1861, 161 students signed a petition on parchment supporting his claim for election. Lister was not elected until 5 August 1861, in what was described by Beck as a &quot;troublesome canvas&quot;. Lister was put in charge of wards XXIV (24) and XXV (25) in October 1861. It wasn&#x27;t until November 1861 that he performed his first public operation. Soon after Lister arrived at the GRI, a new surgical block was built and it was here that he conducted many of his trials of antisepsis.

===Holmes System of Surgery===
Between the end of his winter lecture course and his appointment, Lister&#x27;s correspondence contained little of scientific interest. A letter to his father dated 2 August 1861 explained why. He had halted his experiments on coagulation to work on two chapters, &quot;Amputation&quot; and &quot;On Æsthetics&quot; (On anaesthetics) for the medical reference work &quot;System of Surgery&quot; by Timothy Holmes, published in four volumes in 1862. Chloroform was Lister&#x27;s preferred anaesthetic. He wrote three papers for Holmes in 1861, 1870 and 1882. The science of anaesthesia was in its infancy when Lister first recommended chloroform to Syme in 1855, and he continued to use it until the 1880s. His sister Isabella Sophie first described it to him in 1848 when she had a tooth pulled. He had also used it without complications on three patients with tumours of the jaw in 1854. He classed it along with alcohol and opium as a &quot;specific irritant&quot; in &quot;On the early stages of imflammation&quot;. Lister preferred it to ether, as it was safer to use in artificial light, protected the heart and blood vessels, and, Lister believed, gave the patient &quot;mental tranquility&quot; as it was the safest. In the 1871 edition, he reported that there had been no deaths in the Edinburgh or Glasgow infirmaries from chloroform,between 1861 and 1870. Lister described how his assistant applied the chloroform onto a simple handkerchief used as a mask and watched the patient&#x27;s breathing. In 1870 however Lister updated the chapter to state that he felt apprehension about using chloroform on the &quot;aged and infirm&quot;. In the same edition he recommended nitrous oxide for tooth extraction and the use of ether to avoid vomiting after abdominal surgery. In the winter of 1873, the English medical journals reported that sulphuric ether should be used instead but Watson Cheyne stated there had been no deaths from chloroform during the winter of 1873. In 1880, the British Medical Association recommended the synthetic gas ethidene dichloride for clinical trials. On 14 November 1881, Paul Bert published the dose-response curve of chloroform but Lister believed that smaller doses were sufficient to anaesthetize the patient. Starting in April 1882, Lister first conducted clinical research using ether and from July to November, lab experiments on chaffinches and then on himself and Agnes, to determine the correct dose. The 1882 chapter continued to recommend chloroform.

The chapter on amputation was much more technical than the anaesthesia chapter, for example describing the ways of cutting the skin to produce flaps to close over the wound. In the first edition, Lister examined the history of amputation from Hippocrates to Thomas Pridgin Teale, William Hey, François Chopart, Nikolay Pirogov and Dominique Jean Larrey and the discovery of the tourniquet by Etienne Morel. In the first edition, Lister devoted seven pages to dressings, but by the third edition used only a single sentence to recommend a dry dressing as opposed to the more common water dressing, thought to excluded air. By the third edition, Lister focused on describing three innovative surgical techniques. The first was a method for amputation through the thigh that he developed between 1858 and 1860, a modification of Henry Douglas Carden&#x27;s technique for knee amputation. The thigh amputation went through the femoral condyles in a circular fashion with a small posterior flap that enabled a neat scar.

The second technique was an aortic tourniquet for controlling blood flow in the abdominal aorta. The vessels of the aorta were too tough to close properly and ligatures either damaged the artery walls or caused premature death if left in too long. The third technique was a method of bloodless operation that he created in 1863–1864 by elevating a limb and quickly applying an india rubber tourniquet to stop limb circulation. It became unnecessary with the use of the Esmarch bandage. In 1859, he advocated for the use of silver wire sutures that had been invented by J. Marion Sims, but their use fell out of favour with the introduction of antiseptics.

===Croonian Lecture===
On 1 January 1863, Lister returned to the topic of coagulation with the Croonian Lecture titled &quot;On the coagulation of the blood&quot;, although it contained little that was new. The lecture, given in London at the invitation of the Royal Society and the Royal College of Physicians, began by reconfirming the fallacious nature of the ammonia theory, instead proposing that shed blood coagulates when the solid and fluid elements of the blood meet. His experiments had confirmed that blood plasma (liquor sanguinis) alone does not coagulate, but does when in contact with red blood cells. Lister suggested that living tissues possessed similar properties in relation to blood coagulation. He mentioned the presence of coagulable fluid in the interstices of cellular tissue and described instances of oedema liquid coagulating after emission, possibly due to a slight admixture of red blood cells. Lister highlighted the tendency of inflamed tissues to induce coagulation in their vicinity, suggesting that inflamed tissues temporarily lose their vital properties and behave like ordinary solids, leading to coagulation. He provided examples of inflamed arteries and veins exhibiting coagulation on their interior, like artificially deprived vessels. Lister then noted that inflamed tissues induce coagulation and oedema effusions remain liquid. He hypothesised that the accumulated red blood cells increased pressure in inflamed capillaries and contributed to the loss of healthy condition in capillary walls, leading to coagulation. In closing, Lister said his previous microscopic investigation published in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;, supported the view that tissues could be temporarily deprived of vital power by irritants. He proposed that inflammatory congestion arose from the adhesiveness of red blood cells to irritated tissues, like their behaviour outside the body when encountering ordinary solids. In finishing the lecture, Lister said he was satisfied that his previous conclusions on the nature of inflammation were independently confirmed through his research into blood coagulation.

===On excision of the wrist for caries===
Lister&#x27;s most original work that he undertook during 1863 and the beginning of 1864 was the development of a surgical technique for the excision of caries from the wrist, i.e., the removal of diseased bone due to tuberculosis. The procedure consisted of removing the ends of the bones entering into an articulation instead of amputating the whole limb, and was considered a recent development in &quot;conservative surgery&quot;. Several surgeons had attempted the procedure. It was first performed by German surgeons Johann von Dietz in 1839 and in 1849, followed by British surgeon William Fergusson in 1851. While the development of techniques for excision of the elbow was largely successful, similar success for the excision of the wrist was elusive, so amputation was still considered the most appropriate treatment even in 1860. Lister developed a complicated technique that removed the tissue where the disease was likely to occur but preserved the structures used to move the fingers and wrist. The technique was adopted by the profession and the only complaint from surgeons was the length of the operation at 90 minutes. Lister waited almost a year before publishing the paper in March 1865 in The Lancet. The paper presented 15 case histories. In summary, ten people were cured, two had hopes of achieving a cure, two died of causes independent of the operation and Lister considered one operation unsatisfactory, a failure rate of 13%.

===Edinburgh position===
Professor of Systematic Surgery in Edinburgh James Miller died in June 1864. The Edinburgh chair, considered the most prestigious within the Scottish medical community, came with an annual stipend of £700-£800 per year. Syme and his friends suggested that Lister should apply as his candidature was all but assured. A number of reasons have been advanced for why Lister applied. In a letter to his father, he said that he saw Glasgow as a stepping stone. There were a multitude of reasons to either stay or go. He was drawn to research, his friends were there, and he found the routine tasks in Glasgow to be &quot;working in a corner&quot;. There was also the fact that his tenure only lasted 10 years. Testimonials from Christison, Paget, Buchanan and Syme followed the application. By the end of June, Lister was convinced the position was his. However, the chair went with James Spence instead. Lister was disappointed and in social settings tended to solipsism in conversation, but by October his father, in a letter said that it was, &quot;very gratifying to learn thy complete reconcilement to remaining at Glasgow&quot;.

Before he received the disappointing news, Lister had been called back to Upton as his mother Isabella was on her deathbed. She died on 3 September 1864. His father now lived alone at Upton as the only daughter left at home had married in 1858. Communication with his children became of paramount importance to Joseph Jackson and he started to send Lister a letter every week, stating in October &quot;The thought that thou wilt look for letters from thee weekly, and the letters when they come, are alike gratifying to thy poor father.&quot;

;Winter lecture course
On 1 November, Lister began the winter lecture course, divided in two: common tissue and organ conditions, and conditions of physiology. His first lectures were on blood, then nerves, then detailed special nerves which explained the process of inflammation. In introducing the subject, he stated that any injury that didn&#x27;t cause death would result in inflammation with the familiar symptoms of redness, swelling and pain. These symptoms indicated &quot;inflammatory congestion&quot;, the suspension of vital energy, beginning with red corpuscles adhering together, which was caused by fibrin, which itself was caused by two substances in the blood, one in the blood cells and one in liquor sanguis (plasma). He described two types of inflammation, direct and indirect. He saw direct inflammation as caused by a noxious agent and indirect by &quot;sympathy&quot;, an indication that his frame of reference was wholly inadequate. He then provided various examples and examined various types of inflammation such as acute, latent and chronic. The following lectures explained how to alleviate the symptoms of inflammation, by for example elevating a limb to enable blood flow, or reducing tension by draining an abscess. The remarkable aspect of Lister&#x27;s theory of inflammation was that while the details of his observations were correct, his theoretical structure to explain his observations was completely wrong. Lister&#x27;s error lay in his belief that inflammation was a &quot;unitary disease&quot;, a single underlying disease, when in effect it was a range of conditions. The second division of the lectures focused on the heart, blood vessels, lymphatic system, bones, joints and nerves.

;Christmas
Lister and Agnes spent Christmas 1864 with Joseph Jackson at Upton. In January, Lister attended a quite unusual operation by Syme in Edinburgh in which a patient&#x27;s tongue was removed. A month later, Lister received an interesting letter from Jackson on fees that indicated Lister&#x27;s growing private practice that he began in 1861. His practice was unusual, as it was solely dedicated to surgery, during a period when operations either took place at the doctor&#x27;s surgery or at the patient&#x27;s home. In March 1865, Lister and his colleagues became involved in the case of the murderer Edward William Pritchard who was employed as a doctor in Glasgow. Prichard had broken his oath. In a letter to his father, Lister expressed his sincere hope that he would be hung.

===Pasteur===
At the end of 1864 or during the spring of 1865 (sources vary) while walking home with Thomas Anderson, the chemistry professor at Glasgow and discussing putrefaction, Anderson drew Lister&#x27;s attention to the latest research of the French chemist Louis Pasteur, who had discovered living things that caused fermentation and putrefaction. Lister had not been a wide reader of continental literature, but began reading the weekly journal &quot;Comptes rendus hebdomadaires&quot; of the French Academy of Sciences in the years 1860-1863 where Pasteur discussed fermentation and putrefaction.

The two papers that Anderson recommended to Lister were &quot;Sur les corpuscules organisés qui existent dans l&#x27;atmosphère, examen de la doctrine des générations spontanées&quot; 1861 (On the organized particles that exist in the atmosphere, examination of the doctrine of spontaneous generations). In this paper, Pasteur disproved the theory of spontaneous generation by proving the hypothesis that life in boiled infusions arose from spores. He also proved that particles in the air could be cultivated; and that if they were introduced from the air into a sterile liquid, they would reappear and multiply in the liquid. The second paper was Pasteur&#x27;s magnum opus, titled &quot;Examen du rôle attribué au gaz oxygène atmosphérique dans la destruction des matières animales et végétales après la mort&quot; 1863 (Examination of the role attributed to atmospheric oxygen gas in the destruction of animal and plant matter after death), published 29 June 1863. The paper concluded that fermentation, putrefaction and slow combustion destroyed organic matter and these were necessary processes for life to exist. Pasteur learned that slow combustion was related to the anaerobic conditions when microorganisms were present.

Several other papers would directly influence Lister&#x27;s work on microorganisms. The third paper was the &quot;Mémoire sur la fermentation appelée lactique (Extrait par l&#x27;auteur)&quot; (Memoir on the so-called lactic acid fermentation (Extracted by the author)), published in 1857,
described the discovery of the microbe responsible for fermentation in beer yeast. The fourth paper was the &quot;Memoire sur la Fermentation Alcoolique&quot; (Memoir on Alcoholic Fermentation), published in Annales de chimie et de physique in 1860. Pasteur described living microorganisms in yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, that were responsible for the effervescent change that led to fermentation. The last paper by Pasteur was the &quot;Animalcules infusoires vivant sans gaz oxygène libre et déterminant des fermentations&quot;, (Animal Infusoria Living in the Absence of Free Oxygen and their fermentations) That paper, 
presented in 1861, was seminal in enabling Lister to understand the nature of sepsis, where the body&#x27;s response to infections leads to injury of the tissue and organs. Pasteur&#x27;s research led him to believe the ferment that produced Butyric acid was a microbe that lived in the absence of oxygen. The last paper that Lister found important was &quot;Recherches sur la putréfaction&quot; (Research on putrefaction) that concluded that &quot;...that putrefecation is determined by living ferments&quot;.

Lister was not the only surgeon interested in Pasteur&#x27;s research. Thomas Spencer Wells, surgeon to Queen Victoria, had emphasised the significance of Pasteur&#x27;s work at a meeting of the British Medical Association in 1864, stating &quot;[By] applying the knowledge for which we are indebted to Pasteur of the presence in the atmosphere of organic germs ... it is easy to understand that some germs find their most appropriate nutriment in the secretions from wounds, or in pus, and that they so modify it as to convert it into a poison when absorbed&quot;. However, Wells did not have an experiment to demonstrate germ theory and was unable to develop the techniques to put it into practice.

===Discovery===
The serendipitous discovery of Pasteur&#x27;s work at a time when he was struggling to control post-surgical infections provided a simple explanation for a problem he had long experienced. He was now convinced that infection and suppuration of wounds must be due to entry into the wound of minute living airborne creatures. He recognised that contamination was the vector for infection, realising from the first that the surgeon&#x27;s hands, dressings and instruments would also be contaminated. However, Pasteur&#x27;s work confirmed the view Lister had always expressed that contamination came from the air. Lister did not realise the vast and diverse amount of microbial life. As Lister&#x27;s work at that time derived directly from Pasteur&#x27;s, Lister probably thought that wound infection was due to a single organism. He had no concept, nor indeed did anybody else, of the vast number of types of germs. Reading the papers did spur him to determine how the hands, dressings and instruments he used could be rid of these ubiquitous organisms and how the wound could be cleared of them.

Pasteur suggested three methods to eliminate microorganisms: filtration, exposure to heat, or exposure to chemical solutions. Lister was particularly interested in the efficacy of filtration and repeated many of Pasteur&#x27;s experiments in modified form for instruction in his class, but eventually excluded the first two techniques as not applicable for the treatment of wounds.

Lister confirmed Pasteur&#x27;s conclusions with his own experiments and decided to use his findings to develop antiseptic techniques for wounds.

===Carbolic acid===
In 1834, Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge discovered the germicide phenol, then known as carbolic acid, which he derived in an impure form from coal tar. At that time, there was uncertainty as to the relationship of creosote – a chemical that had been used as a preservative on the wood used for railway sleeper and ships to protect the wood from rotting – and carbolic acid. Upon hearing that creosote had been used for treating sewage in Carlisle, Lister obtained a sample from Anderson. Known as &quot;German creosote&quot;, it was a thick, smelly tarry substance.

==Antiseptic system 1865–1867==


===History===
====Hospitalism====

The history of antiseptic surgery in the years before 1847, was preventing or treating infection in accidental wounds, often received in battle.

====1860&#x27;s surgery and pathological theory====
In the 1860s, Lister&#x27;s assumptions about surgery and theory of pathology were similar to those of his contemporaries.

===Early experiments===
In early March 1865, Lister conducted his first experiment using the acid on a patient whose wrist was being excised due to caries. Although he carefully washed the wound, it became infected and the experiment was a failure.

On 21 March 1865, Lister began his second experiment with carbolic acid on a 22-year-old patient named Neil Kelly who had a severe compound fracture of the leg. His treatment consisted of cleaning the wound of all blood clots and then applying the undiluted carbolic acid by the use of forceps across the whole wound. A piece of lint impregnated in the acid was then laid on the leg, overlapping the wound and fixed by an adhesive plaster. A thin metal sheet made of tin or lead and sterilized by the acid was over the lint, to prevent the antiseptic from evaporating. This was further fixed with adhesive plaster and packing was used between the limb and the splints for the purpose of soaking up any blood or discharges. A crust formed that was not removed except to apply a new antiseptic. While the treatment possessed many of the essential characteristics of the antiseptic dressings that Lister would subsequently introduce, it failed and suppuration began to occur, leading to the death of the patient. Lister blamed himself and noted that the treatment &quot;..proved unsuccessful, in consequence, as I now believe, of improper management&quot;.

===Antiseptic treatment and dressings===
The essential part of the wound treatment was not the application of strong carbolic acid to the wound, although that required careful management to ensure the wound was sterilised, but designing the dressing in such a manner to stop the ingress of airborne infection. This was often misunderstood, even when he was explaining the procedure to fellow doctors at Glasgow who were celebrating him as humanity&#x27;s benefactor, and it caused him considerable irritation and unhappiness later in life. They were confused by the initial application of the acid and this led to the claim that Lister was advocating for the use of carbolic acid to prevent suppuration.

The disadvantages of the first primitive dressings of lint soaked in carbolic acid were soon apparent. The German creosote was also far from ideal, as it irritated the skin, causing ulceration and then suppuration that occasionally resulted in tissue necrosis. It was also almost insoluble in water. Lister began to look for another source of phenol. Lister discovered that Frederick Crace Calvert, an honorary chemistry professor from the Royal Manchester Institution was manufacturing small quantities of phenol at a much finer purity and managed to obtain some. The phenol was in the form of small white crystals which liquified at and were readily soluble in a ratio of 1:20 parts of water and to any extent soluble in oil. The watery solution could be used in a lotion of any strength and be used for disinfection of wounds while the solution in oil that served as a reservoir of antiseptic seemed likely to provide a suitable dressing. Lister began to experiment with the phenol and produced a new dressing made of a putty that consisted of carbonate of lime mixed with phenol mixed with boiled linseed oil in a ratio of 1:4 or 1:6.

After two failures, Lister had no clear experimental design to test the efficacy of carbolic acid. At that point he decided to only experiment on patients with compound fractures, i.e. open wounds where the fractured bone breaks through the skin, leading to extensive loss of blood. In 1865, industrial accidents often led to the patient being thrown to the ground, leading to dirt entering the wound and a risk of deep infection. By the time the patient saw a surgeon several hours later, suppuration had invariably set in. In 1865, amputation was the standard treatment for compound fractures. Lister reasoned that he could experiment on the patient and if the treatment failed, perform the amputation to remove the limb and save the patient&#x27;s life. He believed this experimental model was both ethically and medically ideal.

===James Greenlees===
On 12 August 1865, Lister achieved success for the first time when he used the crude oily full-strength carbolic acid to disinfect a compound fracture. He applied a piece of lint dipped in carbolic acid solution onto the wound of an 11-year-old boy, James Greenlees, who sustained a compound fracture after a cart wheel passed over his left leg. After washing the wound with carbolic acid dissolved in linseed oil, he applied a dressing of putty mixed with the acid widely over the wound and placed a sheet of tin to cover the wound and protect it. The putty ensured that the acid didn&#x27;t wash out of the wound in blood or lymph fluid. He splinted the leg and bandaged it to hold the lot in place. After four days, he renewed the pad and discovered that no infection had developed. He again dressed it and left it for five days. When he removed the second dressing, he found the skin around the wound was burnt and applied a dressing of gauze soaked in a combination of 5% to 10% acid and olive oil for a further four days. He then applied a water dressing to the wound until it completely healed. After slightly over six weeks, Lister discovered that the boy&#x27;s bones had fused back together without suppuration. Confident that carbolic acid was the antiseptic that he had been looking for, Lister treated patient after patient at the Royal Infimary in the following months, improving both the wound dressing design and the operating treatment.

During the summer, the Listers never strayed far from Glasgow as he was still monitoring Greenlees. In the same month, he treated two ulcers. Both sores were washed with an acid in oil solution and one was covered with an oiled paper coated with spirit varnish and the second with gutta-percha covered with a water dressing. In both cases the dressing failed and he swapped them for a water dressing covered with cotton. On 11 September 1865, Lister treated the second patient with the acid, Patrick F., a labourer with a compound fracture of the thigh. After the thigh was splinted, the small wound was dressed using lint dipped in carbolic acid and covered in oil paper. After 16 days, the patient had an excellent prognosis. On 22 September, the Listers decided to take short holiday to Upton and the patient was left with his house surgeon, John Macfee. However, the treatment failed and the limb was amputated after gangrene developed in the wound. When he wrote up his seminal paper, Lister considered the wound size too small to have effectively tested the efficacy of the acid, but he was happy with the outcome. At Christmas 1865, the Lister joined the Symes in Edinburgh. It was eight months before Lister treated another compound fracture. On 22 January 1866 he treated John Austin, a shipwreck survivor with a wound in the leg that had developed into an ulcer. He washed the wound in 20:1 oil-to-acid solution and dressed it with a lint bandage dipped in the solution covered with plaster of paris.

===Improved dressing===
On 19 May 1866, the first patient to use the improved method presented at Lister&#x27;s accident ward with a compound fracture with extensive swelling and bruising. The patient was John Hainy, a 21-year-old casting moulder in an iron foundry, who had been supervising a crane when a chain broke and a metal box, containing a sand mould weighing 12 hundredweight or , fell from a height of four feet and landed obliquely on his left leg. Both leg bones were broken and a wound measuring had bled profusely into the muscles and tissue of the leg. A secondary complication had occurred when air bubbles had mixed with the blood when the man was moved to the hospital. The normal treatment would have been amputation, but Lister decided to treat the wound with phenol. He squeezed the leg to remove as much air and blood as possible, then placed a piece of lint soaked in carbolic acid on the wound and covered it with tin foil. A bloody crust formed over the wound, consisting of a scab free of bacteria. Lister saw for the first time how the scab was gradually converted into living tissue, even when new carbolic acid was being applied - something entirely new. Unfortunately Hainy developed bed sores that became gangrenous. These were treated with nitric acid to remove the necrotic flesh and carbolic acid to sterilize the wounds. Hainy survived the injury. On 27 May, Lister wrote to his father expressing intense satisfaction, stating &quot;I tried the application of carbolic acid to the wound, to prevent decomposition of the blood and to prevent the fearful mischief of suppuration. It is now eight days since the accident and patient has been going exactly as though the fracture were a simple one.&quot; Two weeks later another letter followed, reporting &quot;The great swelling has almost entirely subsided, and the limb is becoming firm&quot;. On 11 June, he wrote a further letter to his father where he describes compound fractures as &quot;no longer a case of uncertainty&quot; and his decision to publish the results. On 7 August 1866, Hainy was released from hospital.

===Refined dressing===
Lister continued to refine the dressing and perfect the antiseptic treatment on several other compound fracture and patients with absesses. He would often spend long nights experimenting in his home laboratory. He searched for a material that could be placed over the wound and under the carbolic acid, that would serve to protect the wound from the irritating effects of the acid and stop the ingress of microbes but enable bodily secretions to escape. He eventually settled on the use of oiled silk sold under the &quot;Green oiled silk protective&quot; brand. The silk surface was painted with one part dextrin, two parts of powdered starch and 16 parts of watery acid in a 20-1 water-acid solution, to ensure a thorough wetting. The sterile silk dressing was an effective barrier between the acid and the tissue. He described the new treatment as &quot;An antiseptic to exclude putrefaction with a protective to exclude the atmosphere will by their joint action, keep the wound from abnormal stimulus&quot;.

In July 1866, while he continued to treat compound fracture cases, he applied for a vacant surgeoncy position at the University College London. It was an attractive position as a came with guaranteed post at University College Hospital. He approached Lord Henry Brougham and prepared a testimonial that included a short description of the antiseptic system, which was the first formal description of his work. However, he lost the election. 

===Abcess treatment===
On 7 November 1866, Lister began using his technique on abscesses, when he sucessfully treated 12-year old Mary Phillips. On 17 March 1867, he treated a 5-year old boy who had a disease of the spine that had developed an large abscess between the umbilicus to the middle of the thigh. Known as psoas abscesses, they were often as result of complication from tuberculosis, where pus collects in the muscles within the abdominable cavity. They tended to grow very large but the relationship between underlying infection in the bone caused by the tuberculosis and the abscess was not understood. The treatment he developed consisted of draining the abscess, placing a piece of lint soaked with carbolic acid in the incision and applying a dressing consisting of layer of the putty then covered with tinfoil. The dressing was changed daily with the lint left in place. Eventually the lint was removed after several days, leaving a scar. In a letter to his father he stated &quot;...cases of abscess treated in this way is so beautifully in harmony with the theory of the whole subject of suppuration, and besides the treatment is now rendered so simple and easy for any one to put in practice, that it really charms me&quot;.

===&quot;On a new method of treating compound fracture, abscess&quot;===

In early 1867, Lister began writing the compound fracture case histories of his experiments with carbolic acid in a series of papers, the first to describe his new technique of antiseptics. Titled &quot;On a New Method of treating Compound Fracture, Abscess, Etc., with Observations on the Conditions of Suppuration&quot;. the paper was published in &quot;The Lancet&quot; in five instalments with the first appearing on 10 March 1867. and the last part on abcesses added in July 1867. The paper was divided into a main section dealing with compound fractures, and a short note on the treatment of abscesses.

Lister&#x27;s theory of inflammation provided the conceptual structure of the article. He stated that the inflammation that appeared immediately after an injury was both necessary and dangerous. It was a precursor to healing, but the fluids which flowed into the wound were akin to dead tissue. Inflammation could trigger putrefaction. Lister described tissues healing by granulation, which he believed was the likely outcome in wounds in compound fractures. Lister believed that cells of granulated tissue were remarkably active and that since they were alive, they were immune to putrefaction and also to secondary inflammation, as they lacked sensory nerves. Airborne putrefaction, &quot;a danger that was underrated&quot;, was proven by the scabs which appeared to protect small wounds as they healed. Lister then explained how often it appeared in less than 24 hours and had an associated smell. He described the source of putrefaction and how the &quot;raw surface&quot; of the wound could putrify before the granulations formed or the liquids on the surface of the granulations putrified. The liquids were extremely acrid and acted on the sensory nerves to initiate indirect inflammation and fever. This led to increased cell turnover and cellular death, increasing the quantity of putrescent material in the wound. Sloughs were produced that resulted in suppuration. In the next section, Lister made his most famous declaration, namely that the decomposition of organic tissue was not caused by the gaseous components in the atmosphere but &quot;minute particles suspended in [the air], which are the germs of various low forms of life, long since revealed by the microscope, and regarded as merely accidental concomitants of putrescence&quot; and had been identified by Pasteur as the &quot;essential cause&quot; of putrefaction. He described germs as working in the same manner as yeast converts sugar to alcohol. Lister&#x27;s germs were scavengers who lived on dead tissue. He didn&#x27;t see them as parasites on living tissue. In that respect, Lister&#x27;s paper is open to many interpretations, but in the context of wounds, he believed that living tissue could resist germs. He never made the distinction as to whether germs were living beings for example in erysipelas, that entered the body or were a chemical agent.

In the rest of the paper, Lister described using carbolic acid, and how the acid formed a dense crust protecting the wound from the ingress of germs. He then described the detailed case histories of 11 patients. Healing by granulation occurred in all cases except 7,10, and 11, which didn&#x27;t suppurate. Cases 1 and 9 did suppurate. Lister didn&#x27;t regard pus as significant, as it was not associated with inflammation or change in putrefaction. In essence, he had &quot;attained healing by granulation without inflammation&quot; in compound fracture cases. He believed that the elimination of suppuration wasn&#x27;t a desirable therapeutic outcome, as a small amount of suppuration on a healthy granulation wasn&#x27;t a cause for alarm.

===Medical discourse===
During his life, Lister never wrote any books and was exhausted by the process of writing. He considered the meaning of each individual word, which would have led the process of writing a book extremely time-consuming and a burden. An example of Listers poor communucation was placing the reason for his antiseptic treatment at the end of first antiseptic paper, instead of in the first paper. Foremost amongst his biographers to examine Listers writing skills was Joseph Fisher, who pointed to his flatness of expression and his inability to state the obvious, i.e. that he was seeking to prevent putrefaction. Fisher wondered if it was simple &quot;stylistic ham-handedness&quot;, a statement examined by Connor and Connor in 2008.

===Carcinoma of the breast ===
In July 1867, Lister discovered that his sister Isabella Pim had breast cancer. Pim had visited Paget and Syme to seek treatment but had such an extensive carcinoma that both surgeons advised against operating. Lister made the difficult decision to perform a radical mastectomy. He consulted Syme in Edinburgh and rehearsed the operation on a dead body. The recovery went smoothly and although there was some suppuration in the wound, Lister&#x27;s use of antiseptics prevented putrefaction. The next day he wrote to his father, &quot;I may say the operation was done at least as well as if she was not my sister. But I do not wish to do such a thing again. Pim lived for another three before dying of liver metastasis on 9 August 1870.

===Antiseptic principle of the practice of surgery===
Within a few days of the publishing of the last part of the previous paper, Syme asked Lister to attend the British Medical Association meeting in Dublin on 9 August 1867. Lister had some difficulty preparing a new paper, the seminal &quot;On the Antiseptic Principle in the Practice of Surgery-*&quot; Lister&#x27;s second paper on antiseptic surgery. It was later published in the British Medical Journal on 21 September 1867.

Lister claimed that based on experiments on inflammation, the essential cause of suppuration in wounds was decomposition. Several aspects of this claim need to be examined. Firstly, it was specific to wounds, as Lister had other views about suppuration elsewhere on the body. Secondly, he stipulated that decomposition was the &quot;essential&quot; cause of suppuration, i.e. not the only cause. Thirdly, decomposition was the cause of pus in wounds. Lister&#x27;s pronouncement is best described as that he had discovered that the only important cause of suppuration in inflamed wounds is decomposition. Lister was specifically referring to the pathology of pus formation in inflamed tissue, the essential cause of harm in the practice of surgery. His appeal to the reader, in essence, to surgical consensus, was: &quot;To prevent the occurrence of suppuration, with all its attendant risks, was an object manifestly desirable&quot;, and refers to the surgeon&#x27;s dread of pus appearing in an inflamed wound. Lister then made the wholly inaccurate statement that &quot;...oxygen, which was universally regarded as the agent by which putrefaction was effected&quot; compared to other sources. Lister introduced the work of Pasteur, claiming that decomposition might be avoided by using a dressing that could destroy the minute organisms in the wound. Lister decided to formulate his new surgical technique into a general principle. He termed it the &quot;antiseptic principle&quot;, thus linking its nomenclature to carbolic acid. His principle was &quot;that all the local inflammatory mischief and general febrile disturbance which follow severe injuries are due to the irritation, and the reason for this was the carbolic acid induced suppuration but prevented decomposition, which was contrary to normal surgical treatment that saw suppuration as an indication that something was wrong, in Lister&#x27;s case essentially that the antiseptic treatment had failed.[325] influence of decomposing blood or sloughs.&quot; He stating a &quot;great principle&quot; – not that decomposition was the cause of disease in wounds, but that it was the only cause.

The paper instructed surgeons to continue treatment even when suppuration appeared. The reason for this was the carbolic acid-induced suppuration but prevented decomposition, which was contrary to normal surgical treatment, which saw suppuration as an indication that something was wrong, in Lister&#x27;s case essentially that the antiseptic treatment had failed. He noted that he felt it necessary to affirm on &quot;pathological principles&quot; that granulation tissue had no inherent tendency to form pus but only did so when &quot;subjected to a preternatural tendency&quot;. He explained that carbolic acid and decomposing substances were similar, i.e., both caused suppuration by a chemical process but carbolic acid only acted on the surface of the tissue to which it was applied, but decomposition is a &quot;self-propagating and self-aggravating poison&quot;. Decomposing tissue was a breeding ground for more decomposition that led to putrefaction in the tissue surrounding it.

Lister argued that the pus formed by carbolic acid was acceptable as long as it wasn&#x27;t accompanied by inflammation. In this respect, Lister&#x27;s approach to normal or abnormal healing by granulation was the same as the average surgeon of the period: that healthy healing didn&#x27;t occur when inflammation was present.

Lister paid particular attention to putrefaction. The last part of the paper stating that decomposing wounds were the cause of disease in hospitals, which was not an uncommon belief amongst the surgical community. He described how the two large wards where he offered treatment were the unhealthiest in Glasgow and how since the application of antiseptics, &quot;wounds and abscesses no longer poison the atmosphere with putrid exhalations&quot; and the wards completely changed their character. Not a single instance of pyaemia, hospital gangrene, or erysipelas had occurred in them since the new regime of antiseptics had begun. However, Lister did not explain how the &quot;putrid exhalations&quot; led to fever.

===Illustrations of the antiseptic system of treatment in surgery===
On 21 September 1867, Lister published a new paper, &quot;Illustrations of the Antiseptic System of Treatment in Surgery&quot;, in &quot;The Lancet&quot;, his third paper on antisepsis. This paper was supposed be the first in a new series with the next paprt to be on wounds with simple incisions but it never appeared. 

The paper summarised his earlier claims and added further observations on the nature of putrefaction. He stated that the &quot;character of the decomposition in a given fermentable substance is determined by the nature of the organism that develops in it&quot;. He suggested that the cause of fermentation in food was yeasts and putrefaction was possibly caused &quot;Vibrios&quot; (a type of bacteria). At the end of the paper, he stated that on the basis of his new antiseptic theory &quot;a really trustworthy treatment for compound fractures and other severe contused wounds has been established for the first time, so far as I am aware, in the history of surgery&quot;.

;Sterility experiment
In October 1867, Lister repeated a modified form of Pasteur&#x27;s experiment, originally devised by French chemist Chevreul, to support germ theory and disprove the theory of spontaneous generation. Lister poured urine into four glass flasks, then washed the necks to remove any urine and modified three of them, extending and drawing their necks into a narrow tube bent at an acute angle. The fourth&#x27;s neck was cut short and left vertical, but with a reduced diameter, smaller than the others&#x27; necks. The flasks were then boiled and when the heat was withdrawn, air was allowed to rush into the flask to replace the condensed steam. The flasks were then left undisturbed in the same room, the necks open to the air. Within four days a vegetative mould appeared in the fourth flask while the other three flasks remained clear. Lister would later use the flasks in demonstrations. His dresser John Rudd Leeson described how Lister took the three flasks to London on their laps in a specially reserved first-class cabin, to ensure the flasks would survive the journey.

===First reception of antisepsis===
Although Lister was honoured in later life, his ideas about the transmission of infection and the use of antiseptics were widely criticised in his early career. On 24 August 1867, within a month of Lister&#x27;s publishing his first paper on antiseptics, the editor of &quot;The Lancet&quot;, Lister&#x27;s nemesis James G. Wakley, wrote an editorial crediting Pasteur for Lister&#x27;s research and invited physicians to investigate Lister&#x27;s claims and report their findings to the journal.

====Simpson&#x27;s attack====
On 21 September 1867, Scottish obstetrician James Young Simpson, professor of medicine and midwifery at Edinburgh University and discoverer of chloroform, published an editorial that attacked Lister in the &quot;Edinburgh Daily Review&quot;, written under the pen name &quot;Chirurgicus&quot;, a common practice to signal a personal attack. Simpson&#x27;s motive was that he was trying to convince the medical community of the efficacy of his acupressure technique, which used needles to halt arterial haemorrhage, counter to Lister&#x27;s use of ligatures. The editorial letter was the first of many and began a tit-for-tat argument in the press over months and eventually led to the acceptance of antisepsis.

Simpson claimed that Lister&#x27;s prior article had copied a continental practice and accused him of plagiarising the work of French doctor and pharmacist Jules Lemaire. Lemaire had described carbolic acid as a constituent of coal tar in 1860 in &quot;Saponinated coal tar&quot; and after a long series of investigations had followed up with an 1863 book,
&quot;De l&#x27;acide phénique, de son action sur les végétaux, les animaux, les ferments, les venins, les virus, les miasmes et de ses applications à l&#x27;industrie, à l&#x27;hygiène, aux sciences anatomiques et à la thérapeutique&quot; (Carbolic acid, its action on plants, animals, ferments, venoms, viruses, miasmas and its applications to industry, hygiene, anatomical sciences and therapy) with the second edition in 1865, where he described the antiseptic power of carbolic acid. While Lemaire believed in the germ theory and realised the causes of putrefaction, he made no attempt to develop a process to exclude them from the wound.

On 5 October 1867, Lister gave a robust reply to Simpson in a letter &quot;On the Use of Carbolic Acid&quot; to &quot;The Lancet&quot;, denying that he had heard of Lemaire&#x27;s work and arguing that that work had made little impact on the medical profession. Lister went on to defend his work, stating:

::&quot;For my own part, I may say that, of all the gentlemen from Great Britain and both continents who have recently visited Glasgow, not one has ever expressed the slightest doubt that the system in question was entirely new; the novelty, I may remark, being, not the surgical use of carbolic acid (which I never claimed), but the methods of its employment with the view of protecting the reparatory processes from disturbance by external agency.&quot;

He unsuccessfully searched all the Glasgow libraries for Lemaires work before finally discovering a copy in the library of Edinburgh University. On 19 October, Lister wrote a follow-up letter to &quot;The Lancet&quot; and stated he didn&#x27;t claim to be the first physician to use carbolic acid and that he chose the acid due to its strength as an antiseptic. He also included a letter of support from a Carlisle medical student, Phillip Hair, who had studied in Paris. Hair stated he had seen no treatments there that were as effective as Lister&#x27;s. Lister&#x27;s response angered Simpson and two weeks later on 2 November 1867 he published a bitter reply: &quot;Carbolic acid and its compounds in surgery&quot; in, &quot;The Lancet&quot; under his own name. Simpson reiterated his previous claims about Lemaire&#x27;s and others&#x27; prior use of the acid, mentioning James Spence, who had used the acid to wash amputations, but had abandoned its use. He cited a report by Sampson Gamgee who visited Paris and reported that surgeons were using a solution of 100:1 of water to acid, while Lister recommended 40:1. Simpson exposed his true motives when he compared his preferred technique of acupressure to Lister&#x27;s use of ligatures. He used the work of William Pirrie, professor of surgery at Aberdeen University, who had used acupressure to stop pus formation during breast cancer operations, to illustrate his point, that there had been no deaths from pyaemia at the hospital, compared to the many deathd in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Simpson was acutely embarrassed when Pirrie replied a week later in &quot;The Lancet&quot; in a small article titled &quot;On the Use of Carbolic Acid in Burns&quot;, recommending its use for burn injuries and believing it proved effective in other treatments. Lister replied with a short note on 9 November to ask the reader to: &quot;to judge for themselves how far the present attack admits of justification, promising to publish additional articles on his antiseptic technique&quot;.

===First experimentalist===
The first experimentalist surgeon to question the validity of the airborne microorganisms hypothesis was Edinburgh surgeon and professor of medicine John Hughes Bennett. In a January 1868 lecture for the Edinburgh Medical Journal, Bennett advanced &quot;The Atmospheric Germ Theory&quot;, agreeing with the theories of Félix Archimède Pouchet, professor of natural history at the University of Rouen, who believed in spontaneous generation of life. Bennet described his own theory of molecular degeneration to explain how microorganisms transformed old tissue into new tissue by the action of molecules. Bennett taught that molecules rather than cells were the foundational building blocks of tissue and that microorganisms could be spontaneously created from different combinations of molecules. In his view, each molecule had a specific function, i.e. certain molecules were destructive to tissue, while others constructed tissue.

Bennett believed that diseases developed from the physical properties of the air, such as its density or changes in temperature. Bennett believed that the germs that Pasteur captured couldn&#x27;t be identified as organic organisms. The components of this dust were also found in minerals and they were either lint, debris from clothing, vegetable matter or pieces of seeds. Bennett particularly disagreed about temperature. Pasteur stated that germs died when heated to 30 degrees above boiling, and also from extreme cold. In the lecture, he referred to Pouchet&#x27;s experiments duplicating Pasteur&#x27;s, and refuted Pasteur&#x27;s conclusions. Bennet didn&#x27;t realise that Pasteur had proved his theory by both isolating the germs and stopping them from reappearing. In his experiments, Bennett reported that he &quot;proved&quot; that germs generate spontaneously, so therefore one could never create a germ-free environment.

It was likely that Hughes Bennett never adequately sterilized his experimental apparatus correctly. On 8 November 1868, Lister gave a lecture on germ theory, where he elaborated on the origin of germs, as a rebuttal of Bennett&#x27;s theory.

In 1869, at the meetings of the British Association at Leeds, Lister&#x27;s ideas were mocked; and again, in 1873, the medical journal &quot;The Lancet&quot; warned the entire medical profession against his progressive ideas. However, Lister did have some supporters, including Marcus Beck, a consultant surgeon at University College Hospital, who not only practised Lister&#x27;s antiseptic technique, but included it in the next edition of one of the main surgical textbooks of the time.

Lister&#x27;s use of carbolic acid proved problematic, and he eventually repudiated it for superior methods. The spray irritated eyes and respiratory tracts, and the soaked bandages were suspected of damaging tissue, so his teachings and methods were not always adopted in their entirety. Because his ideas were based on germ theory, still in its infancy, their adoption was slow. General criticism of his methods was exacerbated by the fact that he found it hard to express himself adequately in writing, so his methods seemed complicated, unorganised, and impractical.

Lister left Glasgow University in October 1869 and was succeeded by George Husband Baird MacLeod. Lister returned to Edinburgh as successor to Syme as professor of surgery at the University of Edinburgh and continued to develop improved methods of antisepsis and asepsis. Amongst those he worked with there, was the senior apothecary and later MD, Alexander Gunn.

==Edinburgh 1869–1877==
In Edinburgh, his primary objectives were to perfect the design of his dressings, improve the reliability of antiseptics and apply his technique to an ever wider class of operations. He selected cases of the repair of bone deformities and rewiring of fractures where the union had malformed while healing.

In 1870, Lister published &quot;On the Effects of the Antiseptic System of Treatment upon the Salubrity of a Surgical Hospital&quot;.

Lister&#x27;s meticulous nature became ever more apparent in his casebooks for wards 4 and 5 at the infirmary.

On 14 January 1871, Lister published his first details of &quot;Gauze and Spray&quot; in the British Medical Journal.

In 1872 he was elected a member of the Aesculapian Club.

===Sprays===

Therefore, Lister tested the results of spraying instruments, surgical incisions, and dressings with a solution of carbolic acid. Lister found that the solution swabbed on wounds remarkably reduced the incidence of gangrene.

==London 1877–1900==

On 10 February 1877, the Scottish surgeon Sir William Fergusson, Chair of Systematic Surgery at King&#x27;s College Hospital, died. On 18 February, in reply to a tentative approach from a representative of Kings College, Lister stated that he would be willing to accept the chair if he could radically reform the teaching there. There was no doubt that Lister&#x27;s mission was both evangelical and apostolic and this was his true purpose in moving to London.

British surgeon John Wood, originally next in line, was elected to the chair. Wood was hostile to Lister obtaining the chair. On 8 March 1877, in a private letter to an associate, Lister contrasted their differing teaching methods and stated in no uncertain terms his opinion of Fergusson, &quot;The mere fact of Fergusson having held the clinical chair is surely a matter of no great moment&quot;. In a comment to another colleague, Lister stated that his goal in taking the appointment was &quot;the thorough working of the antiseptic system with a view to its diffusion in the Metropolis&quot;. At a memorial held by his students to persuade him to remain, Lister criticised London teaching. His impromptu speech was heard by a reporter who ensured that it was published in the London and Edinburgh newspapers. This jeopardised Lister&#x27;s position, as word reached the governing council at King&#x27;s College, who awarded the chair to John Wood a few weeks later.

However, negotiations were renewed in May and he was finally elected on 18 June 1877 to a newly created Chair of Clinical Surgery. The second Clinical Surgery Chair was created specifically for Lister because the hospital feared the negative publicity that would have resulted had Lister not been elected.

===Moving to Regents Park===
On 11 September 1877, Joseph and Aggie moved to London and found a house at 12 Park Crescent in Regent&#x27;s Park. Lister began teaching on 1 October. The hospital made attendance at Lister&#x27;s lectures mandatory 
for all students. Attendance was small, compared to the four hundred students who regularly attended his classes in Edinburgh. Lister&#x27;s conditions of employment were met, but he was only provided with 24 beds, instead of the 60 beds that he was used to in Edinburgh. Lister stipulated that he should be able to bring from Edinburgh four people who would constitute the core of his new staff at the hospital. These were Watson Cheyne who became his assistant surgeon, John Stewart, an anatomical artist and senior assistant, and W. H. Dobie and James Altham Lister&#x27;s dressers (surgical assistants who dressed wounds). There was considerable friction at Lister&#x27;s first lecture, both from students who heckled him and staff. Even the nurses were hostile. This was clearly illustrated in October 1877 when a patient, Lizzie Thomas, who travelled from the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary to be treated for a Psoas abscess, was not admitted due to not having the correct paperwork. Lister could hardly believe that such a lack of sympathy from imperious nurses could exist. More so, such a state of mind was a real danger to his patients, because his system depended on loyal staff to carry out the preparations for antiseptic surgery.

===Introductory address===
On 1 October 1877, Lister held the customary introductory address. His inaugural lecture in London concerned &quot;The nature of fermentation&quot;. Lister described the fermentation of milk and explained how putrefaction was caused by fermentation of blood and tried to prove that all fermentation was due to microorganisms. To demonstrate, he used a series of test tubes containing milk, loosely covered with glass caps. Although air had entered the test tubes and the milk had not decomposed, demonstrating that air was responsible for fermentation. The experiment had two conclusions, first that unboiled milk had no tendency to ferment and secondly that an organism that Lister had isolated, Bacterium lactis was the cause of lactic acid fermentation.

The address was badly received. In defence, John Stewart described it as: &quot;a brilliant and most hopeful beginning of what we regarded as a campaign in the enemy&#x27;s country... There seemed to be a colossal apathy, an inconceivable indifference to the light which, to our minds, shone so brightly, a monstrous inertia to the force of new ideas.&quot;

===Wiring of fractured patellas===

In October 1877, Lister performed an operation on a patient, Francis Smith, that was not considered life-threatening. The open operation on a fractured patella, in front of 200 students, involved wiring the two fragments together and was likely the first time a healthy knee-joint was ever opened.

In 1881 Lister was elected President of the Clinical Society of London.

In October 1883, St Clair Thomson gathered together and examined Lister&#x27;s first seven knee surgery patients at the Medical Society of London meeting.

He also developed a method of repairing kneecaps with metal wire and improved mastectomy technique. He also became known for being the first surgeon to use catgut ligatures, sutures and rubber drains, and developed an aortic tourniquet. He introduced a diluted spray of carbolic acid combined for surgical use. However he abandoned carbolic acid sprays in the late 1890s after he saw that they provided no beneficial change in the outcomes of the surgeries. The only reported reactions were minor symptoms that did not affect the surgical outcome as a whole, like coughing, irritation of the eye, and minor tissue damage among his patients who were exposed to the carbolic acid sprays during the surgery.

==Reception abroad (1870–1876)==
In 1869, Mathias Saxtorph from the University of Copenhagen visited Lister in Glasgow to adopt his methods. In July 1870, Saxtorph recognised Lister&#x27;s technique as being effective in a letter to Lister where he stated:

The Frederick Hospital, to which I am head surgeon is a very old building and I have 150 patients in the surgical wards. Foremerly, there used to be every year several cases of death from pyaemia, sometime, arising from the most trivial injuries. Now, I have had the satisfaction that not a single case of pyaemia has occurred since I came home last year, which result is certainly owing to the introduction of your antiseptic treatment.

===Germany===
The first use of Lister&#x27;s method in Germany was by Karl Thiersch in Leipzig in 1867. Thiersch practised Lister&#x27;s approach since its introduction and never published his results, but did teach it to his students. His house surgeon Hermann Georg Joseph tested it on 16 patients with abscesses, with favourable results. Joseph wrote a thesis on his results, proving the value of the Lister method, and presented in Leipzig the following year. In January 1870, Heinrich Adolf von Bardeleben presented a paper to the Berlin Medical Society that described the results but provided no statistical evaluation of them.

The adoption of Listerism on the European continent halted during the Franco-Prussian War, but it became the greatest opportunity to advance Lister&#x27;s ideas. At the start of the war, Lister had written a pamphlet known as &quot;A Method of Antiseptic Treatment Applicable To Wounded Soldiers in the Present War&quot; that described a simplified technique of antiseptic that could be used on the battlefield and military hospital. The pamphlet was immediately translated into German, but never made a material difference.

By far the most important advocate for Lister&#x27;s antiseptic system in Germany was surgeon and osteotomy specialist Richard von Volkmann, who taught at the University of Halle. In August 1870, he became surgeon-general during the Franco-Prussian War and was responsible for 12 army hospitals and 1442 beds. When he returned to his own hospital in the winter of 1871, he found large numbers of patients with infectious diseases throughout the ward. He wrote of the experience:

The mortality after large amputations and complicated fractures grew year by year. In the summer of 1871, during my absence on the battlefield, the clinic was crowded by a large amount of injured. For eight months, in the winter of 1871 to 1872, the numbers of blood poisoning and rose disease victims were so great, that I considered applying for a temporary closure of the facility. Without a morgue, the dead stayed in the cellar beneath the wards

In 1872, Volkmann sent his assistant Max Schede to visit Lister at his clinic, to learn his new techniques. Once Schede returned in the autumn of 1872, Volkmann began to use Lister&#x27;s new techniques. On 16 February 1873, in a letter to Theodor Billroth, Volkmann wrote:

since autumn of last year (1872), I have been experimenting with Lister&#x27;s method... Already, the first trials in the old &#x27;contaminated&#x27; house, show wounds healing, uneventful, without fever and pus.

In April 1874, Volkmann presented a lecture titled: &quot;About antiseptic occlusive bandages and their influence on the healing process of wounds&quot; where he detailed the influence of Lister. The lecture became famous in Germany, to such an extent that Lister&#x27;s antiseptics were established in Germany, faster than in any other developed country. At the German Congress of Surgery, the members were so enthused with the results of Lister&#x27;s work, that they invited him to visit Germany and see first-hand the results of his work. Lister decided to accept the invitation to a continental tour.

In the spring of 1875, Lister along with Agnes, his sister-in-law and two nieces left Edinburgh. The group spent several weeks in a tour that began in Cannes in France, visited several cities in Italy and finished with a four-day visit to Venice. The first place in Germany that Lister visited was the &quot;Allgemeines Krankenhaus&quot; (general hospital) in Munich, which was run by Nussbaum. A celebratory dinner was held in Munich for Lister, with seventy guests. Lister received his most glorious reception in Leipzig, where Karl Thiersch held a banquet for three to four hundred guests. Lister then visited Volkmann in Halle before visiting Berlin, where the group was entertained by Heinrich Adolf von Bardeleben, who worked at the Charité hospital and was one of the earliest adopters of antiseptics.

==Later life==

In December 1892, Lister attended a celebration of the 70th birthday of Pasteur at the Sorbonne in Paris, The theatre, designed to hold 2500 people, was crowded and included the university governing staff, ministers of state, ambassadors, the President of France Sadi Carnot and representatives from the Institut de France. Lister, invited to give the address, received a great ovation when he stood up. He spoke of the debt that he and surgery owed to Pasteur. In a scene captured later by Jean-André Rixens, Pasteur strode forward and kissed Lister on both cheeks. In January 1896, Lister was present when Pasteur&#x27;s body was laid in his tomb at the Pasteur Institute.

In 1893, four days into a spring holiday in Rapallo, Agnes Lister died from acute pneumonia. While still responsible for the wards at Kings College Hospital, Lister&#x27;s private practice ceased along with an appetite for experimental work. He severely curtailed social gatherings, studying and writing lost appeal for him, and he sank into religious melancholy. On 31 July 1895, Lister retired from Kings College Hospital. Lister was presented with a portrait painted by Scottish artist John Henry Lorimer, in a small presentation, held in recognition of the affection and esteem that felt by his colleagues.

Despite suffering a stroke, he still came into the public light from time to time. He had for several years been a Surgeon Extraordinary to Queen Victoria, and from March 1900 was appointed the Serjeant Surgeon to the Queen, thus becoming the senior surgeon in the Medical Household of the Royal Household of the sovereign. After her death the following year, he was re-appointed as such to her successor, King Edward VII.

On 24 June 1902, with a 10-day history of appendicitis with a distinct mass on the right lower quadrant, Edward was operated on by Sir Frederick Treves two days before his scheduled coronation. Like all internal surgery at the time, the appendectomy needed by the King still posed an extremely high risk of death by post-operational infection, and surgeons did not dare operate without consulting Britain&#x27;s leading surgical authority. Lister obligingly advised them in the latest antiseptic surgical methods (which they followed to the letter), and the King survived, later telling Lister, &quot;I know that if it had not been for you and your work, I wouldn&#x27;t be sitting here today.&quot;

In 1903, Lister left London to live in the coastal village of Walmer at Park House.

=== Death ===
Lord Lister died on 10 February 1912 at his country home at the age of 84. The first part of Lister&#x27;s funeral was a large public service held at Westminster Abbey, which took place at 1.30 pm on 16 February 1912. His body was moved from his house and taken to the Chapel of St. Faith and a wreath of orchids and lilies was placed by the German ambassador Count Paul Wolff Metternich on behalf of the German Emperor Wilhelm II. Before the start of the service, Frederick Bridge played the music of Henry Purcell, the &quot;funeral march&quot; by Chopin and Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Tres Aequili&quot;. The body was then placed on a high catafalque, where his Order of Merit, Prussian Pour le Mérite and Grand Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog were placed. It was then borne by several pallbearers including John William Strutt, Archibald Primrose, Rupert Guinness, Archibald Geikie, Donald MacAlister, Watson Cheyne, Godlee and Francis Mitchell Caird where the catafalque was conveyed to Hampstead Cemetery in London, reaching it at 4pm. Lister&#x27;s body was then buried in a plot in the south-east corner of the central chapel, attended by a small group of his family and friends. Many tributes from learned societies all over the world were published in &quot;The Times&quot; on that day. A memorial service was held in St Giles&#x27; Cathedral in Edinburgh on the same day. Glasgow University held a memorial service in Bute Hall on 15 February 1912.

A marble medallion of Lister was placed in the north transept of Westminster Abbey, which sits alongside four other noted men of science, Darwin, Stokes, Adams, and Watt.

==Lister Memorial Fund==
Following his death, the Lord Lister Memorial Fund was established by the Royal Society as a public subscription to raise monies for the public good in honour of Lord Lister. It led to the founding of the Lister Medal, considered the most prestigious prize that can be awarded to a surgeon.

==Awards and honours==
On 26 December 1883, Queen Victoria created Lister a baronet, of Park Crescent in the parish of St Marylebone in the county of Middlesex.

In 1885, he was awarded the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;, the highest Prussian order of merit. The order was restricted to 30 living Germans and as many foreigners.

On 8 February 1897, he was further honoured when Her Majesty raised him to the peerage as Baron Lister, of Lyme Regis in the county of Dorset.

In the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902 (the original day of King Edward VII&#x27;s coronation), Lord Lister was appointed a privy counsellor and one of the original members of the new Order of Merit (OM). He received the order from the King on 8 August 1902, and was sworn a member of the Privy Council at Buckingham Palace on 11 August 1902.

In December 1902, the King of Denmark bestowed upon Lister the Knight of the Grand Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog, an Order of chivalry that gave him more pleasure than any of his later honours.

===Medals===
Throughout his life, Lister was awarded a number of medals for his achievements.

In May 1890, Lister was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh, that included the delivery of a short &quot;oration&quot; or lecture, that was held at the Synod Hall in Edinburgh.

===Academic societies===
Lister was a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England between 1880 and 1888.

In 1877, Lister was awarded the Cothenius Medal of the German Society of Naturalists. In 1886, he was elected vice president of the college, but declined the nomination for office of president, as he wished to devote his remaining time to further research. In 1887, Lister presented the Bradshaw lecture with a lecture titled &quot;On the Present Position of Antiseptic Treatment in Surgery&quot;. In 1897, Lister was awarded the College Gold Medal, their highest honour.

Lister was elected to the Royal Society in 1860. He served as a trustee on the Royal Society council between 1881 and 1883. Ten years later, in November 1893 Lister was elected for two years, to the position of foreign secretary of the society, succeeding the Scottish geologist Sir Archibald Geikie. In 1895, he was elected president of the Royal Society succeeding Lord Kelvin. He held the position until 1900.

In March 1893, Lister received a telegram from Pasteur, Félix Guyon and Charles Bouchard that informed him he had been elected an associate of the Academie des Sciences.

Lister was elected an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1893, an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1897, and an International Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences. 

===Monuments and legacy===
In 1903, the British Institute of Preventive Medicine was renamed Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine in honour of Lister. The building, along with another adjacent building, forms what is now the Lister Hospital in Chelsea, which opened in 1985. The building at Glasgow Royal Infirmary which houses the cytopathology, microbiology, and pathology departments was named in Lister&#x27;s honour to recognise his work at the hospital. The Lister Hospital in Stevenage, Hertfordshire is named after him.

Lister&#x27;s name is one of 23 people featured on the frieze of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine – although the committee which chose the names to include on the frieze did not provide documentation about why certain names were chosen and others were not.

Only two British surgeons have public monuments in London, Lister and John Hunter. The statue of Lister, created by Thomas Brock in bronze in 1924, stands at the north end of Portland Place. A bronze statue of Lister, mounted on a granite base in Glasgow&#x27;s Kelvingrove Park, was sculpted by George Henry Paulin in 1924. It sits next to a statue of Lord Kelvin.

The &quot;Discovery&quot; Expedition of 1901–1904 named the highest point in the Royal Society Range, Antarctica, Mount Lister.
In 1879 Joseph Lawrence, the American inventor of Listerine antiseptic, developed as a surgical antiseptic but nowadays best known as a mouthwash, named it after Lister.

Microorganisms named in his honour include the pathogenic &quot;Listeria&quot; bacterial genus named by J. H. H. Pirie, typified by the food-borne pathogen &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;, and &quot;Listerella&quot; slime mould genus first described by Eduard Adolf Wilhelm Jahn in 1906.

Two postage stamps were issued in September 1965 to honour Lister on the centenary of his antiseptic surgery at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary of Greenlees, the first ever recorded instance of such treatment.

<text>Johann Baptist Homann (20 March 1664 – 1 July 1724) was a German geographer and cartographer, who also made maps of the Americas.

== Life ==
Homann was born in Oberkammlach near Kammlach in the Electorate of Bavaria. Although educated at a Jesuit school, and preparing for an ecclesiastical career, he eventually converted to Protestantism and from 1687 worked as a civil law notary in Nuremberg. He soon turned to engraving and cartography; in 1702 he founded his own publishing house.

Homann acquired renown as a leading German cartographer, and in 1715 was appointed Imperial Geographer by Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI. Giving such privileges to individuals was an added right that the Holy Roman Emperor enjoyed. In the same year he was also named a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin. Of particular significance to cartography were the imperial printing privileges (Latin: &quot;privilegia impressoria&quot;). These protected for a time the authors in all scientific fields such as printers, copper engravers, map makers and publishers. They were also very important as a recommendation for potential customers.

In 1716 Homann published his masterpiece &quot;Grosser Atlas ueber die ganze Welt&quot; (Grand Atlas of all the World). Numerous maps were drawn up in cooperation with the engraver Christoph Weigel the Elder, who also published &quot;Siebmachers Wappenbuch&quot;.

Homann died in Nuremberg in 1724. He was succeeded by his son Johann Christoph (1703–1730). The company carried on upon his death as &quot;Homann heirs&quot; company, managed by Johann Michael Franz and Johann Georg Ebersberger. After subsequent changes in management the company folded in 1852. The company was known as &quot;Homann Erben&quot;, &quot;Homanniani Heredes&quot;, or &quot;Heritiers de Homann&quot; abroad.

==Controversies and Criticism==

===2014 Jadavpur University Protests===
In 2014 a series of protests broke out in response to the alleged molestation of a female student and beating of a male student by 10 other students on 28 August 2014. Her family and ultimately the student body were unsatisfied by the response of the Vice Chancellor to the allegations. Protests began on 10 September. On 16 September students gheraoed several officials in their offices, demanding that the Vice Chancellor make a statement on the status of a fair probe. Police were summoned, and later that night the police allegedly attacked and beat the student demonstrators. 30 to 40 students were injured; some had to be hospitalized. Reaction was nationwide, with supportive protests at multiple other cities including New Delhi, Hyderabad and Bangalore. On 20 September, Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi, who is also the chancellor of the university, met with student representatives and promised to conduct an impartial inquiry. However, students said they will continue to boycott classes until the Vice Chancellor resigns.

On 26 September, a State Government inquiry panel submitted its report, confirming that the female student had indeed been sexually abused on 28 August 2014. On 26 September, police summoned two Jadavpur University students to come to the Lalbazar Police HQ for questioning at 4 pm on Friday. They were arrested at 6 pm. &quot;The arrests were made after evidence was found, prima facie, against the duo. Further investigation is on,&quot; said joint CP-crime Pallab Kanti Ghosh. Mr Ghosh also stated, &quot;(Two names) were arrested because we had enough evidence to prove that they were present at the spot and had carried out the crime as alleged in the victim&#x27;s complaint.&quot; The duo were booked under Sections of 354 (assault or use of criminal force on a woman with the intent to outrage her modesty), 342 (wrongful confinement), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 114 (abettor present when offence is committed) of the IPC.

===2018 Scrapping Entrance Tests===
JU got embroiled in controversy on 4 July 2018, when the executive council announced its decision to scrap entrance tests for six humanities subjects which was met with protests from the Jadavpur University Teacher&#x27;s Association and the student unions along with other academics and university students due speculations that state education ministry had influenced this decision.

===2023 ragging allegations===
In August 2023, Swapnadeep Kundu, a 17 year old freshman student studying an Honours course in Bengali fell from the balcony of the second floor of the Jadavpur University Hostel – either by suicide or by murder – after intense ragging. The Kolkata Police arrested several students and alumni who were suspected to have been involved. The incident left a deep impact on the general public, leading to an outcry. Media attention was also given to the need for strengthening security measures within the university, a suggestion that was vehemently opposed by certain sections of Jadavpur University&#x27;s political circles. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, directed the Higher Education Committee of West Bengal to form a team to investigate the incident. As the student happened to be a minor, the incident was also taken up by the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights (WBCPCR). Amidst the investigation, Jadavpur University students protested against ragging.

<doc id="16544" wikidata="Q467451" url="?curid=16544" title="James L. Jones">
<text>James Logan Jones Jr. (born December 19, 1943) is a retired United States Marine Corps four-star general and consultant who served as the 21st United States National Security Advisor from 2009 to 2010. During his military career, he served as the 32nd Commandant of the Marine Corps from July 1999 to January 2003, and Commander, United States European Command and Supreme Allied Commander Europe from 2003 to 2006. Jones retired from the Marine Corps on February 1, 2007, after 40 years of service.

After retiring from the Marine Corps, Jones remained involved in national security and foreign policy issues. In 2007, Jones served as chairman of the Congressional Independent Commission on the Security Forces of Iraq, which investigated the capabilities of the Iraqi police and armed forces. In November 2007, he was appointed by the U.S. Secretary of State as special envoy for Middle East security. He served as chairman of the Atlantic Council from June 2007 to January 2009, when he assumed the post of National Security Advisor which he held until resigning in November 2010.

Jones owns the consulting firms Ironhand Security LLC and Jones Group International LLC.

==Early life and education==
Jones was born in Kansas City, Missouri, on December 19, 1943. He is the son of Charlotte Ann (née Ground) and James L. Jones Sr., a decorated Marine in World War II who was an officer in the Observer Group and the commanding officer of its successor, the Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion. Having spent his formative years in France, where he attended the American School of Paris, he returned to the United States, graduating from Groveton High School in Fairfax County, Virginia, then attended Georgetown University Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, from which he received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1966. Jones, who is tall, played forward on the 1963–64 Georgetown Hoyas men&#x27;s basketball team.

==Military career==

In January 1967, Jones was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps. Upon completion of The Basic School at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, in October 1967, he was ordered to South Vietnam, where he served as a platoon and company commander with Golf Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines. While overseas, he was promoted to first lieutenant in June 1968.

Returning to the United States in December 1968, Jones was assigned to Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California, where he served as a company commander until May 1970. He then received orders to Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C., for duties as a company commander, serving in this assignment until July 1973. While at this post, he was promoted to captain in December 1970. From July 1973 until June 1974, he was a student at the Amphibious Warfare School, Marine Corps University, Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia.

In November 1974, Jones received orders to report to the 3rd Marine Division at Marine Corps Base Camp Smedley D. Butler, Okinawa, Japan, where he served as the commander of Company H, 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines, until December 1975.

From January 1976 to August 1979, Jones served in the Officer Assignments Section at Headquarters Marine Corps, Washington, D.C. During this assignment, he was promoted to major in July 1977. Remaining in Washington, his next assignment was as the Marine Corps liaison officer to the United States Senate, where he served until July 1984. In this assignment, his first commander was John McCain, then a United States Navy captain. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in September 1982.

===Senior staff and command===

Jones was selected to attend the National War College in Washington, D.C. Following graduation in June 1985, he was assigned to command the 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines, 1st Marine Division, at Camp Pendleton, California, from July 1985 to July 1987.

In August 1987, Jones returned to Headquarters Marine Corps, where he served as senior aide to the Commandant of the Marine Corps. He was promoted to colonel in April 1988, and became the Military Secretary to the Commandant of the Marine Corps in February 1989. During August 1990, Jones was assigned as the commanding officer of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (24th MEU) at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.

During his tour with the 24th MEU, Jones participated in Operation Provide Comfort in Northern Iraq and Turkey. He was advanced to brigadier general on April 23, 1992. Jones was assigned to duties as deputy director, J-3, United States European Command in Stuttgart, Germany, on July 15, 1992. During this tour of duty, he was reassigned as chief of staff, Joint Task Force Provide Promise, for operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina and North Macedonia.

Returning to the United States, Jones was advanced to the rank of major general in July 1994 and was assigned as commanding general, 2nd Marine Division, Marine Forces Atlantic, Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune. Jones next served as director, Expeditionary Warfare Division (N85), Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, during 1996, then as the deputy chief of staff for plans, policies, and operations, Headquarters Marine Corps, Washington, D.C. He was advanced to lieutenant general on July 18, 1996. His next assignment was as the military assistant to the Secretary of Defense.

===Commandant===

On April 21, 1999, Jones was nominated for appointment to the grade of general and assignment as the 32nd Commandant of the Marine Corps. He was promoted to general on June 30, 1999, and assumed the post on July 1, 1999. He served as commandant until January 2003, turning over the reins to General Michael Hagee.

Among other innovations during his tenure as Marine Corps commandant, Jones oversaw the Marine Corps&#x27; development of MARPAT camouflage uniforms, and the adoption of the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program. These replaced M81 Woodland uniforms and the LINE combat system, respectively.

===Supreme Allied Commander Europe===
Jones assumed duties as the commander of United States European Command (EUCOM) on January 16, 2003, and Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) the following day. He was the first Marine Corps general to serve as SACEUR/EUCOM commander.

The Marine Corps had only recently begun to take on a larger share of high-level assignments in the Department of Defense. In December 2006, Jones was one of five serving Marine Corps four-star general officers who outranked the Commandant of the Marine Corps, General James T. Conway in terms of seniority and time in grade—the others being Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Peter Pace; former commandant General Michael Hagee; commander of United States Strategic Command General James E. Cartwright; and Assistant Commandant General Robert Magnus.

As SACEUR, Jones led the Allied Command Operations (ACO), comprising NATO&#x27;s military forces in Europe, from the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe in Mons, Belgium. Jones relinquished command as SACEUR on December 7, 2006, and was succeeded by United States Army General John Craddock. Jones was reported to have declined an opportunity to succeed General John P. Abizaid as commander of United States Central Command. He retired from the Marine Corps on February 1, 2007.

===Awards and decorations===
Jones&#x27; personal decorations include (foreign and non-U.S. personal and unit decorations are in order of precedence based on military guidelines and award date):


===Silver Star citation===

The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to First Lieutenant James Logan Jones, Jr. (MCSN: 0-102030), United States Marine Corps Reserve, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as Commanding Officer of Company F, Second Battalion, Third Marines, THIRD Marine Division, in connection with operations against the enemy in the Republic of Vietnam. On the night of 27 May 1968, while occupying a defensive position near Khe Sanh, Company F, came under heavy attack by a numerically superior North Vietnamese Army force. During the ensuing fire fight, the company defensive perimeter was penetrated by enemy. Realizing the seriousness of the situation, First Lieutenant Jones unhesitatingly exposed himself to intense fire and fearlessly maneuvered across the fire-swept terrain while rapidly readjusting his defensive lines. Ignoring the enemy rockets and hand grenades impacting around him, he boldly directed supporting artillery fire on his position to halt the hostile force&#x27;s attack. Continuing his determined efforts, he directed the delivery of accurate suppressive fire which repulsed numerous enemy attacks during the remainder of the night. His heroic actions and outstanding leadership inspired all who served with him and were instrumental in his unit accounting for 230 North Vietnamese soldiers confirmed killed. By his courage, aggressive fighting spirit and unwavering devotion to duty in the face of great personal danger, First Lieutenant Jones upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and of the United States Naval Service.

====Other recognition====
In 2000, Jones received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

==Post-military career==
===Business roles===
Following his retirement from the military, Jones became president of the Institute for 21st Century Energy, an affiliate of the US Chamber of Commerce; he also served as chair of the board of directors of the Atlantic Council of the United States from June 2007 until January 2009, when he assumed the post of National Security Advisor. Jones also served as a member of the guiding coalition for the Project on National Security Reform, as well as chairman of the Independent Commission on the Iraqi Security Forces. He was a member of the board of directors of The Boeing Company from June 21, 2007, to December 15, 2008, serving on the company&#x27;s Audit and Finance Committees. Jones was also a member of the board of directors of Cross Match Technologies, a privately held biometric solutions company, from October 2007 to January 2009.

Jones was employed on the board of trustees of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a bipartisan think-tank, from 2007 to 2008, and then began serving again in 2011. He was a member of the board of directors of Chevron Corporation from May 28, 2008, to December 5, 2008, serving on the Board Nominating and Governance and Public Policy Committees.
According to the first report since Jones re-entered government service in January 2009, Jones earned a salary and bonus of $900,000 from the US Chamber, as well as director fees of $330,000 from the Boeing Company and $290,000 from the Chevron Corporation.

After leaving the Obama administration, Jones returned as a Fellow at the US Chamber in 2011.

The board of directors of General Dynamics has elected Jones to be a director of the corporation, effective August 3, 2011. Also, on January 13, 2012, Jones joined Deloitte Consulting LLP as a senior adviser who will work with Federal and commercial consulting clients within Deloitte&#x27;s Department of Defense and Intel segments. In early 2013, Jones joined OxiCool Inc&#x27;s Advisory Board.

Jones established the consulting firms Ironhand Security LLC and Jones Group International LLC. The firms have worked for foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia. After the murder of Jamal Khashoggi by the Saudi regime, Jones downplayed his firms&#x27; work with the Saudi government and said that the remaining contract with them was about to expire. However, Jones&#x27;s firms subsequently expanded its partnership with the Saudi regime. By 2022, his firms had four contracts with the Saudi government and employed 53 Americans in Riyadh, eight of whom were retired generals and admirals.

===Diplomatic roles===
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice asked Jones twice to be Deputy Secretary of State after Robert Zoellick resigned. He declined.

On May 25, 2007, Congress created an Independent Commission on the Security Forces of Iraq to investigate for 120 days the capabilities of the Iraq armed forces and police. Jones served as chairman of that commission and reported on Congress on September 6, 2007, noting serious deficiencies in the Iraq Interior Ministry and in the Iraq National Police.

Rice appointed Jones as a special envoy for Middle East security on November 28, 2007, to work with both Israelis and Palestinians on security issues.

Jones serves as a Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC), where he works on a variety of national security and energy-related issues. Jones is also a co-chair of BPC&#x27;s Energy Project.

Jones is an Advisory Board Member of Spirit of America, a 501(c)(3) organization that supports the safety and success of Americans serving abroad and the local people and partners they seek to help.

===National Security Advisor===
On December 1, 2008, President-elect Obama announced Jones as his selection for National Security Advisor. The National Security Advisor is appointed by the president without confirmation by the United States Senate.

The selection surprised people because, as Michael Crowley reported, &quot;The two men didn&#x27;t meet until Obama&#x27;s foreign policy aide, Mark Lippert, arranged a 2005 sit-down, and, as of this October, Jones had only spoken to Obama twice&quot;. Crowley speculated that Jones&#x27; record suggests he is &quot;someone who, unencumbered by strong ideological leanings, can evaluate ideas dispassionately whether they come from left or right&quot;, and, &quot;This is probably why Obama picked him&quot;. Jones was also picked because he is well respected and likely to possess the skills to navigate the other prestigious and powerful cabinet members.

Though he did not know Gates especially well, both men shared long experience in the national security establishment (Gates was in the Air Force and previously headed the CIA). Jones and Clinton had a more direct connection from her tenure on the Senate Armed Services Committee. The two were said to have particularly clicked at a 2005 conference on security policy in Munich. Jones hosted a small private dinner that included Clinton and South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, among others; at the end of the convivial evening, according to one person present, Jones followed Clinton out to her car to visit in private.

Jones assumed the post when Obama was sworn into office on January 20, 2009. He announced his resignation as National Security Advisor on October 8, 2010, and was succeeded by Thomas E. Donilon.

In March 2013, Jones was quoted comparing the conditions for Iranians in a US camp in Iraq with the conditions of detention for captives held in the Guantanamo Bay detention camps. While addressing the Iranian American Cultural Society of Michigan, Jones said Guantanamo captives &quot;are treated far better&quot; than the Iranian internees. Jones criticized other aspects of the Obama administration&#x27;s policy on Iran. &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine noted that Jones had not volunteered whether he had been paid for this speaking engagement.

===Middle East consultancy===
In March 2017, Jones reportedly began working as a paid consultant for the Ministry of Defense (Saudi Arabia). In 2019, he began working for the government of Libya, but stopped after a few months at the request of the State Department.

==Personal life==
Former Secretary of Defense William Cohen, who hired Jones as his military assistant, said that Jones has a placid demeanor and a &quot;methodical approach to problems—he&#x27;s able to view issues at both the strategic and tactical level&quot;.

Jones was also responsible for convincing country music artist Toby Keith that he should record and publish his popular concert hit &quot;Courtesy of the Red, White, &amp; Blue (The Angry American)&quot;.

<text>James Ephraim Lovelock (26 July 1919 – 26 July 2022) was an English independent scientist, environmentalist and futurist. He is best known for proposing the Gaia hypothesis, which postulates that the Earth functions as a self-regulating system.

With a PhD in the chemistry of disinfection, Lovelock began his career performing cryopreservation experiments on rodents, including successfully thawing and reviving frozen specimens. His methods were influential in the theories of cryonics (the cryopreservation of humans). He invented the electron capture detector and, using it, became the first to detect the widespread presence of chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere. While designing scientific instruments for NASA, he developed the Gaia hypothesis.

In the 2000s, he proposed a method of climate engineering to restore carbon dioxide–consuming algae. He was an outspoken member of Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy, asserting that fossil fuel interests have been behind opposition to nuclear energy, citing the effects of carbon dioxide as being harmful to the environment and warning of global warming due to the greenhouse effect. He wrote several environmental science books based upon the Gaia hypothesis from the late 1970s.

He also worked for MI5, the British security service, for decades. Bryan Appleyard, writing in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, described him as &quot;basically Q in the &quot;James Bond&quot; films&quot;.
== Early life and education ==
James Lovelock was born in Letchworth Garden City to Tom Arthur Lovelock and his second wife Nellie. Nell, his mother, was born in Bermondsey and won a scholarship to a grammar school but was unable to take it up, and started work at thirteen in a pickle factory. She was described by Lovelock as a socialist and suffragist, who was also anti-vaccine, and did not allow Lovelock to receive his smallpox inoculation as a child. His father, Tom, was born in Fawley, Berkshire, had served six months hard labour for poaching in his teens, and was illiterate until attending technical college, later running a bookshop. Lovelock was brought up a Quaker and imbued with the notion that &quot;God is a still, small voice within rather than some mysterious old gentleman way out in the universe&quot;, which he thought was a helpful way of thinking for inventors, but he would eventually end up as being non-religious. The family moved to London, where his dislike of authority made him, by his own account, an unhappy pupil at Strand School in Tulse Hill, south London.

Lovelock could not at first afford to go to university, something which he believed helped prevent him from becoming overspecialised and aided the development of Gaia theory.

== Career ==
After leaving school Lovelock worked at a photography firm, attending Birkbeck College during the evenings, before being accepted to study chemistry at the University of Manchester, where he was a student of the Nobel Prize laureate professor Alexander R. Todd. Lovelock worked at a Quaker farm before a recommendation from his professor led to him taking up a Medical Research Council post, working on ways of shielding soldiers from burns. Lovelock refused to use the shaved and anaesthetised rabbits that were used as burn victims, and exposed his skin to heat radiation instead, an experience he describes as &quot;exquisitely painful&quot;. His student status enabled temporary deferment of military service during the Second World War. Still, he registered as a conscientious objector. He later abandoned his conscientious objection in the light of Nazi atrocities and tried to enlist in the armed forces but was told that his medical research was too valuable for the enlistment to be approved.

In 1948, Lovelock received a PhD degree at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He spent the next two decades working at London&#x27;s National Institute for Medical Research. In the United States, he conducted research at Yale, Baylor College of Medicine and Harvard University Medical School.

In the mid-1950s, Lovelock experimented with the cryopreservation of rodents, determining that hamsters could be frozen and revived successfully. Hamsters were frozen with 60% of the water in the brain crystallised into ice with no adverse effects recorded. Other organs were shown to be susceptible to damage.

A lifelong inventor, Lovelock created and developed many scientific instruments, some of which were designed for NASA in its planetary exploration program. While working as a NASA consultant, Lovelock developed the Gaia hypothesis, for which he is most widely known.

In early 1961, Lovelock was engaged by NASA to develop sensitive instruments for the analysis of extraterrestrial atmospheres and planetary surfaces. The Viking program, which visited Mars in the late 1970s, was motivated in part to determine whether Mars supported life, and some of the sensors and experiments that were ultimately deployed aimed to resolve this issue. During work on a precursor of this program, Lovelock became interested in the composition of the Martian atmosphere, reasoning that many life forms on Mars would be obliged to make use of it (and, thus, alter it). However, the atmosphere was found to be in a stable condition close to its chemical equilibrium, with very little oxygen, methane, or hydrogen, but with an overwhelming abundance of carbon dioxide. To Lovelock, the stark contrast between the Martian atmosphere and chemically dynamic mixture of the Earth&#x27;s biosphere was strongly indicative of the absence of life on Mars. However, when they were finally launched to Mars, the Viking probes still searched (unsuccessfully) for extant life there. Further experiments to search for life on Mars have been carried out by additional space probes, for instance, by NASA&#x27;s Perseverance rover, which landed in 2021.

Lovelock invented the electron capture detector, which ultimately assisted in discoveries about the persistence of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and their role in stratospheric ozone depletion. After studying the operation of the Earth&#x27;s sulphur cycle, Lovelock and his colleagues, Robert Jay Charlson, Meinrat Andreae and Stephen G. Warren developed the CLAW hypothesis as a possible example of biological control of the Earth&#x27;s climate.

Lovelock was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1974. He served as the president of the Marine Biological Association (MBA) from 1986 to 1990 and was an Honorary Visiting Fellow of Green Templeton College, Oxford (formerly Green College, Oxford) from 1994.

As an independent scientist, inventor and author, Lovelock worked out of a barn-turned-laboratory he called his &quot;experimental station&quot; located in a wooded valley on the Devon–Cornwall border in South West England.

In 1988 he made an extended appearance on the Channel 4 television programme &quot;After Dark&quot;, alongside Heathcote Williams and Petra Kelly, among others.

On 8 May 2012, he appeared on the Radio Four series &quot;The Life Scientific&quot;, talking to Jim Al-Khalili about the Gaia hypothesis. On the programme, he mentioned how his ideas had been received by various people, including Jonathon Porritt. He also said how he had a claim for inventing the microwave oven. He later explained this claim in an interview with &quot;The Manchester Magazine&quot;. Lovelock said that he did create an instrument during his time studying causes of damage to living cells and tissue, which had, according to him, &quot;almost everything you would expect in an ordinary microwave oven&quot;. He invented the instrument to heat frozen hamsters in a way that caused less suffering to the animals, as opposed to the traditional way, which involved putting red-hot spoons on the animals&#x27; chests to heat them. He believed that, at the time, nobody had gone that far and made an embodiment of an actual microwave oven. However, he did not claim to have been the first person to have the idea of using microwaves for cooking.

=== CFCs ===
After developing his electron capture detector, in the late 1960s, Lovelock was the first to detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the atmosphere. He found a concentration of 60 parts per trillion of CFC-11 over Ireland and, in a partially self-funded research expedition in 1972, went on to measure the concentration of CFC-11 from the northern hemisphere to the Antarctic aboard the research vessel . He found the gas in each of the 50 air samples that he collected but, not realising that the breakdown of CFCs in the stratosphere would release chlorine that posed a threat to the ozone layer, concluded that the level of CFCs constituted &quot;no conceivable hazard&quot;. He later stated that he meant &quot;no conceivable toxic hazard&quot;.

However, the experiment did provide the first useful data on the ubiquitous presence of CFCs in the atmosphere. The damage caused to the ozone layer by the photolysis of CFCs was later discovered by Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina. After hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock&#x27;s results, they embarked on research that resulted in the first published paper that suggested a link between stratospheric CFCs and ozone depletion in 1974 (for which Sherwood and Molina later shared the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Paul Crutzen). Lovelock was sceptical of the CFC–ozone depletion hypothesis for several years, calling the US ban of CFCs as aerosol propellants in the late 1970s arbitrary overkill.

=== Gaia hypothesis ===
Drawing from the research of Alfred C. Redfield and G. Evelyn Hutchinson, Lovelock first formulated the Gaia hypothesis in the 1960s resulting from his work for NASA concerned with detecting life on Mars and his work with Royal Dutch Shell. The hypothesis proposes that living and non-living parts of the Earth form a complex interacting system that can be thought of as a single organism. Named after the Greek goddess Gaia at the suggestion of novelist William Golding, the hypothesis postulates that the biosphere has a regulatory effect on the Earth&#x27;s environment that acts to sustain life.

While the hypothesis was readily accepted by many in the environmentalist community, it has not been widely accepted within the scientific community as a whole. Among its most prominent critics were the evolutionary biologists Richard Dawkins, Ford Doolittle and Stephen Jay Gould, a convergence of opinion among a trio whose views on other scientific matters often diverged. These (and other) critics have questioned how natural selection operating on individual organisms can lead to the evolution of planetary-scale homeostasis.

In response to this, Lovelock, together with Andrew Watson, published the computer model Daisyworld in 1983, which postulated a hypothetical planet orbiting a star whose radiant energy is slowly increasing or decreasing. In the non-biological case, the temperature of this planet simply tracks the energy received from the star. However, in the biological case, ecological competition between &quot;daisy&quot; species with different albedo values produces a homeostatic effect on global temperature. When energy received from the star is low, black daisies proliferate since they absorb a greater fraction of the heat, but when energy input is high, white daisies predominate since they reflect excess heat. As the white and black daisies have contrary effects on the planet&#x27;s overall albedo and temperature, changes in their relative populations stabilise the planet&#x27;s climate and keep the temperature within an optimal range despite fluctuations in energy from the star. Lovelock argued that Daisyworld, although a parable, illustrates how conventional natural selection operating on individual organisms can still produce planetary-scale homeostasis.
In Lovelock&#x27;s 2006 book, &quot;The Revenge of Gaia&quot;, he argued that the lack of respect humans have had for Gaia, through the damage done to rainforests and the reduction in planetary biodiversity, is testing Gaia&#x27;s capacity to minimise the effects of the addition of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. This eliminates the planet&#x27;s negative feedbacks and increases the likelihood of homeostatic positive feedback potential associated with runaway global warming. Similarly, the warming of the oceans is extending the oceanic thermocline layer of tropical oceans into the Arctic and Antarctic waters, preventing the rise of oceanic nutrients into the surface waters and eliminating the algal blooms of phytoplankton on which oceanic food chains depend. As phytoplankton and forests are the main ways in which Gaia draws down greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, taking it out of the atmosphere, the elimination of this environmental buffering will see, according to Lovelock, most of the Earth becoming uninhabitable for humans and other life-forms by the middle of this century, with a massive extension of tropical deserts. In 2012, Lovelock distanced himself from these conclusions, saying he had &quot;gone too far&quot; in describing the consequences of climate change over the next century in this book.

In his 2009 book, &quot;The Vanishing Face of Gaia&quot;, he rejected scientific models that disagree with the findings that sea levels are rising and Arctic ice is melting faster than the models predict. He suggested that we may already have passed the tipping point of terrestrial climate resilience into a permanently hot state. Given these conditions, Lovelock expected that human civilisation would be hard-pressed to survive. He expected the change to be similar to the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum when the temperature of the Arctic Ocean was 23 °C.

=== Nuclear power ===

Lovelock became concerned about the threat of global warming from the greenhouse effect. In 2004 he broke with many fellow environmentalists by stating that &quot;only nuclear power can now halt global warming&quot;.

In his view, nuclear energy is the only realistic alternative to fossil fuels that can both fulfil the large scale energy needs of humankind while also reducing greenhouse emissions. He was an open member of Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy (EFN).

In 2005, against the backdrop of renewed UK government interest in nuclear power, Lovelock again publicly announced his support for nuclear energy, stating, &quot;I am a Green, and I entreat my friends in the movement to drop their wrongheaded objection to nuclear energy&quot;. Although those interventions in the public debate on nuclear power were in the 21st century, his views on it were longstanding. In his 1988 book &quot;The Ages of Gaia&quot;, he stated: 

In &quot;The Revenge of Gaia&quot; (2006), where he put forward the concept of , Lovelock wrote: 

In 2019 Lovelock said he thought difficulties in getting nuclear power going again were due to propaganda, that &quot;the coal and oil business fight like mad to tell bad stories about nuclear&quot;, and that &quot;the greens played along with it. There&#x27;s bound to have been some corruption there – I&#x27;m sure that various green movements were paid some sums on the side to help with propaganda&quot;.

=== Climate ===
Writing in &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2006, Lovelock argued that, as a result of global warming, &quot;billions of us will die and the few breeding pairs of people that survive will be in the Arctic where the climate remains tolerable&quot; by the end of the 21st century. The same year he suggested that &quot;we have to keep in mind the awesome pace of change and realise how little time is left to act, and then each community and nation must find the best use of the resources they have to sustain civilisation for as long as they can.&quot; He further predicted in 2007 that the temperature increase would leave much of the world&#x27;s land uninhabitable and unsuitable for farming, with northerly migrations and new cities created in the Arctic; furthermore that much of Europe will have turned to desert and Britain will have become Europe&#x27;s &quot;life-raft&quot; due to its stable temperature caused by being surrounded by the ocean. He was quoted in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2008 that 80% of humans will perish by 2100, and this climate change will last 100,000 years.

In a 2010 interview with the &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper, he said that democracy might have to be &quot;put on hold&quot; to prevent climate change. He continued:

Statements from 2012 portrayed Lovelock as continuing his concern over global warming while at the same time criticising extremism and suggesting alternatives to oil, coal and the green solutions he did not support.

In a 2012 interview aired on MSNBC, Lovelock stated that he had been &quot;alarmist&quot;, using the words &quot;All right, I made a mistake,&quot; about the timing of climate change and noted the documentary &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; and the book &quot;The Weather Makers&quot; as examples of the same kind of alarmism. Lovelock still believed the climate to be warming, although not at the rate of change he once thought; he admitted that he had been &quot;extrapolating too far.&quot; He believed that climate change is still happening, but it will be felt further in the future. Of the claims &quot;the science is settled&quot; on global warming, he stated: He criticised environmentalists for treating global warming like a religion. 
In this 2012 MSNBC article, Lovelock is quoted as saying: In a follow-up interview also in 2012, Lovelock stated his support for natural gas; he favoured fracking as a low-polluting alternative to coal. He opposed the concept of &quot;sustainable development&quot;, where modern economies might be powered by wind turbines, calling it meaningless drivel. He kept a poster of a wind turbine to remind himself how much he detested them.

In &quot;Novacene&quot; (2019), Lovelock proposed that benevolent superintelligence may take over and save the ecosystem and stated that the machines would need to keep organic life around to keep the planet&#x27;s temperature habitable for electronic life. On the other hand, if instead life becomes entirely electronic, &quot;so be it: we played our part and newer, younger actors are already appearing on stage&quot;.

==== Ocean fertilisation ====
In 2007, Lovelock and Chris Rapley proposed the construction of ocean pumps to pump water up from below the thermocline to &quot;fertilize algae in the surface waters and encourage them to bloom&quot;. The basic idea was to accelerate the transfer of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the ocean by increasing primary production and enhancing the export of organic carbon (as marine snow) to the deep ocean. A scheme similar to that proposed by Lovelock and Rapley was later developed independently by a commercial company.

The proposal attracted widespread media attention and criticism. Commenting on the proposal, Corinne Le Quéré, a University of East Anglia researcher, said &quot;It doesn&#x27;t make sense. There is absolutely no evidence that climate engineering options work or even go in the right direction. I&#x27;m astonished that they published this. Before any geoengineering is put to work a massive amount of research is needed – research which will take 20 to 30 years&quot;. Other researchers claimed that &quot;this scheme would bring water with high natural  levels (associated with the nutrients) back to the surface, potentially causing exhalation of &quot;. Lovelock subsequently said that his proposal was intended to stimulate interest and that research would be the next step, and several research studies were published in the wake of the original proposal. However, these estimated that the scheme would require a huge number of pipes, and that the main effect of the pipes may be on the land rather than in the ocean.

==== Sustainable retreat ====

Sustainable retreat is a concept developed by Lovelock to define the necessary changes to human settlement and dwelling at the global scale to adapt to global warming and prevent its expected negative consequences on humans.

Lovelock thought the time was past for sustainable development and that we had come to a time when development is no longer sustainable. Therefore, we needed to retreat. Lovelock stated the following to explain the concept:

The concept of sustainable retreat emphasises a pattern of resource use that aims to meet human needs with lower levels or less environmentally harmful types of resources.

== Awards and recognition ==
Lovelock was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1974. His nomination reads: 

Lovelock was awarded a number of prestigious prizes, including the Tswett Medal for Chromatography (1975), the American Chemical Society Award in Chromatography (1980), the World Meteorological Organization Norbert Gerbier–MUMM Award (1988), the Dr A. H. Heineken Prize for Environmental Sciences (1990) and the Royal Geographical Society Discovery Lifetime award (2001). In 2006 he received the Wollaston Medal, the Geological Society of London&#x27;s highest award, whose previous recipients include Charles Darwin. Lovelock was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for services to the study of the Science and Atmosphere in the 1990 New Year Honours and a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) for services to Global Environmental Science in the 2003 New Year Honours.

=== Portraits ===
In March 2012, the National Portrait Gallery unveiled a new portrait of Lovelock by British artist Michael Gaskell, which was completed in 2011. The collection also has two photographic portraits by Nick Sinclair (1993) and Paul Tozer (1994). The archive of the Royal Society of Arts has a 2009 image taken by Anne-Katrin Purkiss. Lovelock agreed to sit for sculptor Jon Edgar in Devon during 2007, as part of the &quot;Environment Triptych&quot; (2008) along with heads of Mary Midgley and Richard Mabey. A bronze head is in the collection of the sitter, and the terracotta is in the artist&#x27;s archive.

== Personal life ==
Lovelock married Helen Hyslop in 1942. They had four children and remained married until her death in 1989 from multiple sclerosis. He first met his second wife, Sandy, at the age of 69. Lovelock stated of their relationship: &quot;...you would find the life of me and my wife Sandy to be an unusually happy one in simple beautiful but unpretentious surroundings.&quot;

Lovelock turned 100 in 2019. He died at his home in Abbotsbury, Dorset, on his 103rd birthday in 2022, of complications related to a fall.

<text>John Akii-Bua (3 December 1949 – 20 June 1997) was a Ugandan hurdler and the first Olympic champion from his country Uganda. In 1986, he was a recipient of the Silver Olympic Order.

==Biography==
Akii-Bua was raised in a family of 43 children from one father and his eight wives. Akii-Bua started his athletic career as a short-distance hurdler, but failed to qualify for the 1968 Olympics. Coached by British-born athletics coach Malcolm Arnold, he was introduced to the 400 meter hurdles. After finishing fourth in the 1970 Commonwealth Games and running the fastest time of 1971, he was not a big favourite for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, having limited competitive experience. Nevertheless, he won the final there, setting a world record time of 47.82 seconds despite running on the inside lane. He missed the 1976 Olympics and a showdown with United States rival Edwin Moses because of the boycott by Uganda and other African nations.

As a police officer, Akii-Bua was promoted by Ugandan president Idi Amin and given a house as a reward for his athletic prowess. When the Amin regime was collapsing, he fled to Kenya with his family, fearful that he would be seen as a collaborator; this was more likely because he was a member of the Langi tribe, many of whom were persecuted by Amin, whereas Akii-Bua was cited by Amin as an example of a Langi who was doing well. However, in Kenya he was put into a refugee camp. From there, he was freed by his shoe-manufacturer Puma and lived in Germany working for Puma for 3–4 years. He represented Uganda once again at the 1980 Summer Olympics. Later he returned to Uganda and became a coach.

Akii-Bua died a widower, at the age of 47, survived by eleven children. He was given a state funeral. His nephew is international footballer David Obua, and his brother Lawrence Ogwang competed in the long jump and triple jump at the 1956 Olympics.

The phrase &quot;akii-buas&quot; has come to colloquially mean &quot;runs&quot; in Uganda.

<doc id="16547" wikidata="Q101886" url="?curid=16547" title="Joachim von Ribbentrop">
<text>Ulrich Friedrich-Wilhelm Joachim von Ribbentrop (; 30 April 1893 – 16 October 1946) was a German politician and diplomat who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Nazi Germany from 1938 to 1945.

Ribbentrop first came to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s notice as a well-travelled businessman with more knowledge of the outside world than most senior Nazis and as a perceived authority on foreign affairs. He offered his house Schloss Fuschl for the secret meetings in January 1933 that resulted in Hitler&#x27;s appointment as Chancellor of Germany. He became a close confidant of Hitler, to the dismay of some party members, who thought him unintelligent, superficial and lacking in talent. He was appointed ambassador to the Court of St James&#x27;s, the royal court of the United Kingdom, in 1936 and then Foreign Minister of Germany in February 1938.

Before World War II, he played a key role in brokering the Pact of Steel (an alliance with Fascist Italy) and the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact (the Nazi–Soviet non-aggression pact). He favoured retaining good relations with the Soviets, opposing the invasion of the Soviet Union. In late 1941, due to American aid to Britain and the increasingly frequent &quot;incidents&quot; in the North Atlantic between U-boats and American warships guarding convoys to Britain, Ribbentrop worked for the failure of the Japanese-American talks in Washington and for Japan to attack the United States. He did his utmost to support a declaration of war on the United States after the attack on Pearl Harbor. From 1941 onwards, Ribbentrop&#x27;s influence declined.

Arrested in June 1945, Ribbentrop was convicted and sentenced to death at the Nuremberg trials for his role in starting World War II in Europe and enabling the Holocaust. On 16 October 1946, he became the first of the Nuremberg defendants to be executed by hanging.
==Early life==
Joachim von Ribbentrop was born in Wesel, Rhenish Prussia, to Richard Ulrich Friedrich Joachim Ribbentrop, a career army officer, and his wife Johanne Sophie Hertwig. He was not born with the nobiliary particle &quot;von&quot;. 
From 1904 to 1908, Ribbentrop took French courses at Lycée Fabert in Metz, the German Empire&#x27;s most powerful fortress, and would become fluent in both French and English. A former teacher recalled Ribbentrop &quot;was the most stupid in his class, full of vanity and very pushy&quot;. His father was cashiered from the Prussian Army in 1908 for repeatedly disparaging Kaiser Wilhelm II for his dismissal of Otto von Bismarck and the Kaiser&#x27;s alleged homosexuality. As a result, the Ribbentrop family was often short of money.

For the next 18 months, the family moved to Arosa, Switzerland, where the children continued to be taught by French and English private tutors, and Ribbentrop spent his free time skiing and mountaineering. 
Following the stay in Arosa, Ribbentrop was sent to Britain for a year to improve his knowledge of English. 
Fluent in both French and English, young Ribbentrop lived at various times in Grenoble, France and London, before travelling to Canada in 1910.

He worked for the Molsons Bank on Stanley Street in Montreal, and then for the engineering firm M. P. and J. T. Davis on the Quebec Bridge reconstruction. He was also employed by the National Transcontinental Railway, which constructed a line from Moncton to Winnipeg. He worked as a journalist in New York City and Boston but returned to Germany to recover from tuberculosis. He returned to Canada and set up a small business in Ottawa importing German wine and champagne. In 1914, he competed for Ottawa&#x27;s Minto ice-skating team and participated in the Ellis Memorial Trophy tournament in Boston in February.

When the First World War began later in 1914, Ribbentrop left Canada, which, as part of the British Empire, was at war with Germany, and found temporary sanctuary in the neutral United States. On 15 August 1914, he sailed from Hoboken, New Jersey on the Holland-America ship &quot;Potsdam&quot;, bound for Rotterdam, and on his return to Germany enlisted in the Prussian 12th Hussar Regiment.

Ribbentrop served first on the Eastern Front, and was then transferred to the Western Front. He earned a commission and was awarded the Iron Cross, having been wounded during his service. In 1918, 1st Lieutenant Ribbentrop was stationed in Istanbul as a staff officer. During his time in Turkey, he became a friend of another staff officer, Franz von Papen.

In 1919, Ribbentrop met Anna Elisabeth Henkell (&quot;Annelies&quot; to her friends), the daughter of a wealthy Wiesbaden wine producer. They were married on 5 July 1920, and Ribbentrop began to travel throughout Europe as a wine salesman. He and Annelies had five children together. In 1925, his aunt, Gertrud von Ribbentrop, adopted him, which allowed him to add the nobiliary particle &quot;von&quot; to his name. Many of his peers and colleagues, including Joseph Goebbels, would ridicule him later in life for not having been born with the title.

In 1928, Ribbentrop was introduced to Adolf Hitler as a businessman with foreign connections who &quot;gets the same price for German champagne as others get for French champagne&quot;. Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorff, with whom Ribbentrop had served in the 12th Torgau Hussars in the First World War, arranged the introduction. Ribbentrop and his wife joined the Nazi Party on 1 May 1932. Ribbentrop began his political career by offering to be a secret emissary between Chancellor of Germany Franz von Papen, his old wartime friend, and Hitler. His offer was initially refused. Six months later, however, Hitler and Papen accepted his help.

Their change of heart occurred after General Kurt von Schleicher ousted Papen in December 1932. This led to a complex set of intrigues in which Papen and various friends of president Paul von Hindenburg negotiated with Hitler to oust Schleicher. On 22 January 1933, State Secretary Otto Meissner and Hindenburg&#x27;s son Oskar met Hitler, Hermann Göring, and Wilhelm Frick at Ribbentrop&#x27;s home in Berlin&#x27;s exclusive Dahlem district. Over dinner, Papen made the fateful concession that if Schleicher&#x27;s government were to fall, he would abandon his demand for the Chancellorship and instead use his influence with President Hindenburg to ensure Hitler got the Chancellorship.

Ribbentrop was not popular with the Nazi Party&#x27;s &quot;Alte Kämpfer&quot; (Old Fighters); they nearly all disliked him. British historian Laurence Rees described Ribbentrop as &quot;the Nazi almost all the other leading Nazis hated&quot;. Joseph Goebbels expressed a common view when he confided to his diary that &quot;Von Ribbentrop bought his name, he married his money and he swindled his way into office&quot;. Ribbentrop was among the few who could meet with Hitler at any time without an appointment, however, unlike Goebbels or Göring.

During most of the Weimar Republic era, Ribbentrop was apolitical and displayed no antisemitic prejudices. A visitor to a party Ribbentrop threw in 1928 recorded that Ribbentrop had no political views beyond a vague admiration for Gustav Stresemann, fear of Communism, and a wish to restore the monarchy. Several Berlin Jewish businessmen who did business with Ribbentrop in the 1920s and knew him well later expressed astonishment at the vicious antisemitism he later displayed in the Nazi era, saying that they did not see any indications he had held such views. As a partner in his father-in-law&#x27;s champagne firm, Ribbentrop did business with Jewish bankers and organised the Impegroma Importing Company (&quot;Import und Export großer Marken&quot;) with Jewish financing.

==Early diplomatic career==
===Background===
Ribbentrop became Hitler&#x27;s favourite foreign-policy adviser, partly by dint of his familiarity with the world outside Germany but also by flattery and sycophancy. One German diplomat later recalled, &quot;Ribbentrop didn&#x27;t understand anything about foreign policy. His sole wish was to please Hitler&quot;. In particular, Ribbentrop acquired the habit of listening carefully to what Hitler was saying, memorizing his pet ideas and then later presenting Hitler&#x27;s ideas as his own, a practice that much impressed Hitler as proving Ribbentrop was an ideal Nazi diplomat. Ribbentrop quickly learned that Hitler always favoured the most radical solution to any problem and accordingly tendered his advice in that direction as a Ribbentrop aide recalled:

When Hitler said &quot;Grey&quot;, Ribbentrop said &quot;Black, black, black&quot;. He always said it three times more, and he was always more radical. I listened to what Hitler said one day when Ribbentrop wasn&#x27;t present: &quot;With Ribbentrop it is so easy, he is always so radical. Meanwhile, all the other people I have, they come here, they have problems, they are afraid, they think we should take care and then I have to blow them up, to get strong. And Ribbentrop was blowing up the whole day and I had to do nothing. I had to break – much better!&quot;

Another reason for Ribbentrop&#x27;s rise was Hitler&#x27;s distrust of and disdain for Germany&#x27;s professional diplomats. He suspected that they did not entirely support his revolution. However, the Foreign Office diplomats loyally served the government and rarely gave Hitler grounds for criticism, while the Foreign Office diplomats were ultranationalist, authoritarian and antisemitic. As a result, there was enough overlap in values between both groups to allow most of them to work comfortably for the Nazis. Nonetheless, Hitler never quite trusted the Foreign Office and was on the lookout for someone to carry out his foreign policy goals.

===Undermining Versailles===
The Nazis and Germany&#x27;s professional diplomats shared a goal in destroying the Treaty of Versailles and restoring Germany as a great power. In October 1933, German Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath presented a note at the World Disarmament Conference announcing that it was unfair that Germany should remain disarmed by Part V of the Versailles Treaty and demanded for the other powers to disarm to Germany&#x27;s level or to rescind Part V and allow Germany &quot;Gleichberechtigung&quot; (&quot;equality of armaments&quot;). When France rejected Neurath&#x27;s note, Germany stormed out of the League of Nations and the World Disarmament Conference. It all but announced its intention of unilaterally violating Part V. Consequently, there were several calls in France for a preventive war to put an end to the Nazi regime while Germany was still more-or-less disarmed.

However, in November, Ribbentrop arranged a meeting between Hitler and the French journalist Fernand de Brinon, who wrote for the newspaper &quot;Le Matin&quot;. During the meeting, Hitler stressed what he claimed to be his love of peace and his friendship towards France. Hitler&#x27;s meeting with Brinon had a huge effect on French public opinion and helped to put an end to the calls for a preventive war. It convinced many in France that Hitler was a man of peace, who wanted to do away only with Part V of the Versailles Treaty.

===Special Commissioner for Disarmament===
In 1934, Hitler named Ribbentrop Special Commissioner for Disarmament. In his early years, Hitler&#x27;s goal in foreign affairs was to persuade the world that he wished to reduce the defence budget by making idealistic but very vague disarmament offers (in the 1930s, disarmament described arms limitation agreements). At the same time, the Germans always resisted making concrete arms-limitations proposals, and they went ahead with increased military spending on grounds that other powers would not take up German arms-limitation offers. Ribbentrop was tasked with ensuring that the world remained convinced that Germany sincerely wanted an arms-limitation treaty, but he ensured that no such treaty was ever developed.

On 17 April 1934, French Foreign Minister Louis Barthou issued the so-called &quot;Barthou note&quot;, which led to concerns on the part of Hitler that the French would ask for sanctions against Germany for violating Part V of the Versailles Treaty. Ribbentrop volunteered to stop the rumoured sanctions and visited London and Rome. During his visits, Ribbentrop met with British Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon and Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and asked them to postpone the next meeting of the Bureau of Disarmament in exchange for which Ribbentrop offered nothing in return other than promising better relations with Berlin. The meeting of the Bureau of Disarmament went ahead as scheduled, but because no sanctions were sought against Germany, Ribbentrop could claim a success.

====Dienststelle Ribbentrop====
In August 1934, Ribbentrop founded an organization linked to the Nazi Party called the &quot;Büro Ribbentrop&quot; (later renamed the &quot;Dienststelle Ribbentrop&quot;). It functioned as an alternative foreign ministry. The &quot;Dienststelle Ribbentrop&quot;, which had its offices directly across from the Foreign Office&#x27;s building on the Wilhelmstrasse in Berlin, had in its membership a collection of &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot; alumni, dissatisfied businessmen, former reporters, and ambitious Nazi Party members, all of whom tried to conduct a foreign policy independent of and often contrary to the official Foreign Office. The Dienststelle served as an informal tool for the implementation of the foreign policy of Hitler, consciously bypassing the traditional foreign policy institutions and diplomatic channels of the German Foreign Office. However, the Dienststelle also competed with other Nazi party units active in the area of foreign policy, such as the foreign organization of the Nazis (NSDAP/AO) led by Ernst Bohle and Nazi Party office of foreign affairs (APA) led by Alfred Rosenberg. With the appointment of Ribbentrop to the Minister of Foreign Affairs in February 1938, the Dienststelle itself lost its importance, and about a third of the staff of the office followed Ribbentrop to the Foreign Office.

Ribbentrop engaged in diplomacy on his own, such as when he visited France and met Foreign Minister Louis Barthou. During their meeting, Ribbentrop suggested for Barthou to meet Hitler at once to sign a Franco-German non-aggression pact. Ribbentrop wanted to buy time to complete German rearmament by removing preventive war as a French policy option. The Barthou-Ribbentrop meeting infuriated Konstantin von Neurath, since the Foreign Office had not been informed.

Although the &quot;Dienststelle Ribbentrop&quot; was concerned with German relations in every part of the world, it emphasised Anglo-German relations, as Ribbentrop knew that Hitler favoured an alliance with Britain. As such, Ribbentrop greatly worked during his early diplomatic career to realize Hitler&#x27;s dream of an anti-Soviet Anglo-German alliance. Ribbentrop made frequent trips to Britain, and upon his return he always reported to Hitler that most British people longed for an alliance with Germany. In November 1934, Ribbentrop met George Bernard Shaw, Sir Austen Chamberlain, Lord Cecil and Lord Lothian. On the basis of Lord Lothian&#x27;s praise for the natural friendship between Germany and Britain, Ribbentrop informed Hitler that all elements of British society wished for closer ties with Germany. His report delighted Hitler, causing him to remark that Ribbentrop was the only person who told him &quot;the truth about the world abroad&quot;. Because the Foreign Office&#x27;s diplomats were not so sunny in their appraisal of the prospects for an alliance, Ribbentrop&#x27;s influence with Hitler increased. Ribbentrop&#x27;s personality, with his disdain for diplomatic niceties, meshed with what Hitler felt should be the relentless dynamism of a revolutionary regime.

====Ambassador-Plenipotentiary at Large====
Hitler rewarded Ribbentrop by appointing him &quot;Reich&quot; Minister Ambassador-Plenipotentiary at Large. In that capacity, Ribbentrop negotiated the Anglo-German Naval Agreement (AGNA) in 1935 and the Anti-Comintern Pact in 1936.

====Anglo-German Naval Agreement====
Neurath did not think it possible to achieve the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. To discredit his rival, he appointed Ribbentrop head of the delegation sent to London to negotiate it. Once the talks began, Ribbentrop issued an ultimatum to Sir John Simon, informing him that if Germany&#x27;s terms were not accepted in their entirety, the German delegation would go home. Simon was angry with that demand, and walked out of the talks. However, to everyone&#x27;s surprise, the next day the British accepted Ribbentrop&#x27;s demands, and the AGNA was signed in London on 18 June 1935 by Ribbentrop and Sir Samuel Hoare, the new British Foreign Secretary. The diplomatic success did much to increase Ribbentrop&#x27;s prestige with Hitler, who called the day the AGNA was signed &quot;the happiest day in my life&quot;. He believed it marked the beginning of an Anglo-German alliance, and ordered celebrations throughout Germany to mark the event.

Immediately after the AGNA was signed, Ribbentrop followed up with the next step that was intended to create the Anglo-German alliance, the &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; (co-ordination) of all societies demanding the restoration of Germany&#x27;s former colonies in Africa. On 3 July 1935, it was announced that Ribbentrop would head the efforts to recover Germany&#x27;s former African colonies. Hitler and Ribbentrop believed that demanding colonial restoration would pressure the British into making an alliance with the &quot;Reich&quot; on German terms. However, there was a difference between Ribbentrop and Hitler: Ribbentrop sincerely wished to recover the former German colonies, but for Hitler, colonial demands were just a negotiating tactic. Germany would renounce its demands in exchange for a British alliance.

====Anti-Comintern Pact====
The Anti-Comintern Pact in November 1936 marked an important change in German foreign policy. The Foreign Office had traditionally favoured a policy of friendship with the Republic of China, and an informal Sino-German alliance had emerged by the late 1920s. Neurath very much believed in maintaining Germany&#x27;s good relations with China and mistrusted the Empire of Japan. Ribbentrop was opposed to the Foreign Office&#x27;s pro-China orientation and instead favoured an alliance with Japan. To that end, Ribbentrop often worked closely with General Hiroshi Ōshima, who served first as the Japanese military attaché and then as ambassador in Berlin, to strengthen German-Japanese ties, despite furious opposition from the Wehrmacht and the Foreign Office, which preferred closer Sino-German ties.

The origins of the Anti-Comintern Pact went back to mid-1935, when in an effort to square the circle between seeking a &quot;rapprochement&quot; with Japan and Germany&#x27;s traditional alliance with China, Ribbentrop and Ōshima devised the idea of an anticommunist alliance as a way to bind China, Japan and Germany together. However, when the Chinese made it clear that they had no interest in such an alliance (especially given that the Japanese regarded Chinese adhesion to the proposed pact as a way of subordinating China to Japan), both Neurath and War Minister Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg persuaded Hitler to shelve the proposed treaty to avoid damaging Germany&#x27;s good relations with China. Ribbentrop, who valued Japanese friendship far more than that of the Chinese, argued that Germany and Japan should sign the pact without Chinese participation. By November 1936, a revival of interest in a German-Japanese pact in both Tokyo and Berlin led to the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact in Berlin. When the Pact was signed, invitations were sent to Italy, China, Britain and Poland to join. However, of the invited powers, only the Italians would ultimately sign. The Anti-Comintern Pact marked the beginning of the shift on Germany&#x27;s part from China&#x27;s ally to Japan&#x27;s ally.

====Veterans&#x27; exchanges====
In 1935, Ribbentrop arranged for a series of much-publicised visits of First World War veterans to Britain, France and Germany. Ribbentrop persuaded the Royal British Legion and many French veterans&#x27; groups to send delegations to Germany to meet German veterans as the best way to promote peace. At the same time, Ribbentrop arranged for members of the &quot;Frontkämpferbund&quot;, the official German World War I veterans&#x27; group, to visit Britain and France to meet veterans there. The veterans&#x27; visits and attendant promises of &quot;never again&quot; did much to improve the &quot;New Germany&#x27;s&quot; image in Britain and France. In July 1935, Brigadier Sir Francis Featherstone-Godley led the British Legion&#x27;s delegation to Germany. The Prince of Wales, the Legion&#x27;s patron, made a much-publicized speech at the Legion&#x27;s annual conference in June 1935 that stated that he could think of no better group of men than those of the Legion to visit and carry the message of peace to Germany and that he hoped that Britain and Germany would never fight again. As for the contradiction between German rearmament and his message of peace, Ribbentrop argued to whoever would listen that the German people had been &quot;humiliated&quot; by the Versailles Treaty, Germany wanted peace above all and German violations of Versailles were part of an effort to restore Germany&#x27;s &quot;self-respect&quot;. By the 1930s, much of British opinion had been convinced that the treaty was monstrously unfair and unjust to Germany, so as a result, many in Britain, such as Thomas Jones, Deputy Secretary to the Cabinet, were very open to Ribbentrop&#x27;s message that European peace would be restored if only the Treaty of Versailles could be done away with.

==Ambassador to the United Kingdom==
In August 1936, Hitler appointed Ribbentrop ambassador to the United Kingdom with orders to negotiate an Anglo-German alliance. Ribbentrop arrived to take up his position in October 1936, formally presenting his credentials to King Edward VIII on 30 October. Ribbentrop&#x27;s time in London was marked by an endless series of social gaffes and blunders that worsened his already-poor relations with the British Foreign Office.

Invited to stay as a house guest of the 7th Marquess of Londonderry at Wynyard Hall in County Durham, in November 1936, he was taken to a service in Durham Cathedral, and the hymn &quot;Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken&quot; was announced. As the organ played the opening bars, identical to the German national anthem, Ribbentrop gave the Nazi salute and had to be restrained by his host.

At his wife&#x27;s suggestion, Ribbentrop hired the Berlin interior decorator Martin Luther to assist with his move to London and help realise the design of the new German embassy that Ribbentrop had built there (he felt that the existing embassy was insufficiently grand). Luther proved to be a master intriguer and became Ribbentrop&#x27;s favourite hatchet man.

Ribbentrop did not understand the limited role in government exercised by 20th-century British monarchs. He thought that King Edward VIII, Emperor of India, could dictate British foreign policy if he wanted. He convinced Hitler that he had Edward&#x27;s support, but that was as much a delusion as his belief that he had impressed British society. In fact, Ribbentrop often displayed a fundamental misunderstanding of British politics and society. During the abdication crisis in December 1936, Ribbentrop reported to Berlin that it had been precipitated by an anti-German Jewish-Masonic-reactionary conspiracy to depose Edward, whom Ribbentrop represented as a staunch friend of Germany, and that civil war would soon break out in Britain between supporters of Edward and those of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin. Ribbentrop&#x27;s civil war predictions were greeted with incredulity by the British people who heard them. Duke Carl Alexander of Württemberg had told the Federal Bureau of Investigation that Wallis Simpson, Edward&#x27;s lover and a suspected Nazi sympathizer, had slept with Ribbentrop in London in 1936; had remained in constant contact with him; and had continued to leak secrets.

Ribbentrop had a habit of summoning tailors from the best British firms, making them wait for hours and then sending them away without seeing him but with instructions to return the next day, only to repeat the process. That did immense damage to his reputation in British high society, as London&#x27;s tailors retaliated by telling all their well-off clients that Ribbentrop was impossible to deal with. In an interview, his secretary Reinhard Spitzy stated, &quot;He [Ribbentrop] behaved very stupidly and very pompously and the British don&#x27;t like pompous people&quot;. In the same interview, Spitzy called Ribbentrop &quot;pompous, conceited and not too intelligent&quot; and stated he was an utterly insufferable man to work for.

In addition, Ribbentrop chose to spend as little time as possible in London to stay close to Hitler, which irritated the British Foreign Office immensely, as Ribbentrop&#x27;s frequent absences prevented the handling of many routine diplomatic matters. (&quot;Punch&quot; referred to him as the &quot;&quot;Wandering Aryan&quot;&quot; for his frequent trips home.) As Ribbentrop alienated more and more people in Britain, &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring warned Hitler that Ribbentrop was a &quot;stupid ass&quot;. Hitler dismissed Göring&#x27;s concerns: &quot;But after all, he knows quite a lot of important people in England.&quot; That remark led Göring to reply &quot;&quot;Mein Führer&quot;, that may be right, but the bad thing is, they know &quot;him&quot;&quot;.

In February 1937, Ribbentrop committed a notable social gaffe by unexpectedly greeting George VI with the &quot;German greeting&quot;, a stiff-armed Nazi salute: the gesture nearly knocked over the King, who was walking forward to shake Ribbentrop&#x27;s hand at the time. Ribbentrop further compounded the damage to his image and caused a minor crisis in Anglo-German relations by insisting that henceforward all German diplomats were to greet heads of state by giving and receiving the stiff-arm fascist salute. The crisis was resolved when Neurath pointed out to Hitler that under Ribbentrop&#x27;s rule, if the Soviet ambassador were to give the Communist clenched-fist salute, Hitler would be obliged to return it. On Neurath&#x27;s advice, Hitler disavowed Ribbentrop&#x27;s demand that King George receive and give the &quot;German greeting&quot;.

Most of Ribbentrop&#x27;s time was spent demanding that Britain either sign the Anti-Comintern Pact or return the former German colonies in Africa. However, he also devoted considerable time to courting what he called the &quot;men of influence&quot; as the best way to achieve an Anglo-German alliance. In order to achieve this he became a member of the Lansdowne Club, a private members club in Mayfair. He believed that the British aristocracy comprised some sort of secret society that ruled from behind the scenes, and that if he could befriend enough members of Britain&#x27;s &quot;secret government&quot; he could bring about the alliance. Almost all of the initially-favourable reports Ribbentrop provided to Berlin about the alliance&#x27;s prospects were based on friendly remarks about the &quot;New Germany&quot; that came from British aristocrats such as Lord Londonderry and Lord Lothian. The rather cool reception that Ribbentrop received from British Cabinet ministers and senior bureaucrats did not make much of an impression on him at first. This British governmental view, summarised by Robert, Viscount Cranborne, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, was that Ribbentrop always was a second-rate man.

In 1935, Sir Eric Phipps, the British Ambassador to Germany, complained to London about Ribbentrop&#x27;s British associates in the Anglo-German Fellowship. He felt that they created &quot;false German hopes as in regards to British friendship and caused a reaction against it in England, where public opinion is very naturally hostile to the Nazi regime and its methods&quot;. In September 1937, the British Consul in Munich, writing about the group that Ribbentrop had brought to the Nuremberg Rally, reported that there were some &quot;serious persons of standing among them&quot; but that an equal number of Ribbentrop&#x27;s British contingent were &quot;eccentrics and few, if any, could be called representatives of serious English thought, either political or social, while they most certainly lacked any political or social influence in England&quot;. In June 1937, when Lord Mount Temple, the Chairman of the Anglo-German Fellowship, asked to see Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain after meeting Hitler in a visit arranged by Ribbentrop, Robert Vansittart, the British Foreign Office&#x27;s Permanent Under-Secretary of State, wrote a memo stating that:

The P.M. [Prime Minister] should certainly not see Lord Mount Temple – nor should the S[ecretary] of S[tate]. We really must put a stop to this eternal butting in of amateurs – and Lord Mount Temple is a particularly silly one. These activities – which are practically confined to Germany – render impossible the task of diplomacy.

After Vansittart&#x27;s memo, members of the Anglo-German Fellowship ceased to see Cabinet ministers after they went on Ribbentrop-arranged trips to Germany.

In February 1937, before a meeting with the Lord Privy Seal, Lord Halifax, Ribbentrop suggested to Hitler that Germany, Italy and Japan begin a worldwide propaganda campaign with the aim of forcing Britain to return the former German colonies in Africa. Hitler turned down the idea, but nonetheless during his meeting with Lord Halifax, Ribbentrop spent much of the meeting demanding that Britain sign an alliance with Germany and return the former German colonies. The German historian Klaus Hildebrand noted that as early as the Ribbentrop–Halifax meeting the differing foreign policy views of Hitler and Ribbentrop were starting to emerge, with Ribbentrop more interested in restoring the pre-1914 German &quot;Imperium&quot; in Africa than the conquest of Eastern Europe. Following the lead of Andreas Hillgruber, who argued that Hitler had a &quot;Stufenplan&quot; (stage by stage plan) for world conquest, Hildebrand argued that Ribbentrop may not have fully understood what Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Stufenplan&quot; was or that in pressing so hard for colonial restoration, he was trying to score a personal success that might improve his standing with Hitler. In March 1937, Ribbentrop attracted much adverse comment in the British press when he gave a speech at the Leipzig Trade Fair in Leipzig in which he declared that German economic prosperity would be satisfied &quot;through the restoration of the former German colonial possessions, or by means of the German people&#x27;s own strength.&quot; The implied threat that if colonial restoration did not occur, the Germans would take back their former colonies by force attracted a great deal of hostile commentary on the inappropriateness of an ambassador threatening his host country in such a manner.

Ribbentrop&#x27;s negotiating style, a mix of bullying bluster and icy coldness coupled with lengthy monologues praising Hitler, alienated many. The American historian Gordon A. Craig once observed that of all the voluminous memoir literature of the diplomatic scene of 1930s Europe, there are only two positive references to Ribbentrop. Of the two references, General Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg, the German military attaché in London, commented that Ribbentrop had been a brave soldier in World War I, and the wife of the Italian Ambassador to Germany, Elisabetta Cerruti, called Ribbentrop &quot;one of the most diverting of the Nazis&quot;. In both cases, the praise was limited, with Cerruti going on to write that only in Nazi Germany was it possible for someone as superficial as Ribbentrop to rise to be a minister of foreign affairs, and Geyr von Schweppenburg called Ribbentrop an absolute disaster as ambassador in London. The British historian/television producer Laurence Rees noted for his 1997 series &quot;The Nazis: A Warning from History&quot; that every single person interviewed for the series who had known Ribbentrop expressed a passionate hatred for him. One German diplomat, Herbert Richter, called Ribbentrop &quot;lazy and worthless&quot;, while another, Manfred von Schröder, was quoted as saying Ribbentrop was &quot;vain and ambitious&quot;. Rees concluded, &quot;No other Nazi was so hated by his colleagues&quot;.

In November 1937, Ribbentrop was placed in a highly-embarrassing situation since his forceful advocacy of the return of the former German colonies led British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden and French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos to offer to open talks on returning the former German colonies in return for which the Germans would make binding commitments to respect their borders in Central and Eastern Europe. Since Hitler was not interested in obtaining the former colonies, especially if the price was a brake on expansion into Eastern Europe, Ribbentrop was forced to turn down the Anglo-French offer that he had largely brought about. Immediately after turning down the Anglo-French offer on colonial restoration, Ribbentrop, for reasons of pure malice, ordered the &quot;Reichskolonialbund&quot; to increase the agitation for the former German colonies, a move that exasperated both the Foreign Office and the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

As the Italian Foreign Minister, Count Galeazzo Ciano, noted in his diary in late 1937, Ribbentrop had come to hate Britain with all the &quot;fury of a woman scorned&quot;. Ribbentrop—and Hitler, for that matter—never understood that British foreign policy aimed at the appeasement of Germany, not an alliance with it.

When Ribbentrop traveled to Rome in November 1937 to oversee Italy&#x27;s adhesion to the Anti-Comintern Pact, he made clear to his hosts that the pact was really directed against Britain. As Ciano noted in his diary, the Anti-Comintern Pact was &quot;anti-Communist in theory, but in fact unmistakably anti-British&quot;. Believing himself to be in a state of disgrace with Hitler over his failure to achieve the British alliance, Ribbentrop spent December 1937 in a state of depression and, together with his wife, wrote two lengthy documents for Hitler that denounced Britain. In the first report to Hitler, which was presented on 2 January 1938, Ribbentrop stated that &quot;England is our most dangerous enemy&quot;. In the same report, Ribbentrop advised Hitler to abandon the idea of a British alliance and instead embrace the idea of an alliance of Germany, Japan and Italy to destroy the British Empire.

Ribbentrop wrote in his &quot;Memorandum for the &quot;Führer&quot;&quot; that &quot;a change in the status quo in the East to Germany&#x27;s advantage can only be accomplished by force&quot; and that the best way to achieve it was to build a global anti-British alliance system. Besides converting the Anti-Comintern Pact into an anti-British military alliance, Ribbentrop argued that German foreign policy should work to &quot;winning over all states whose interests conform directly or indirectly to ours.&quot; By the last statement, Ribbentrop clearly implied that the Soviet Union should be included in the anti-British alliance system he had proposed.

==Foreign Minister of the &quot;Reich&quot;==

In early 1938, Hitler asserted his control of the military-foreign policy apparatus, in part by sacking Neurath. On 4 February 1938, Ribbentrop succeeded Neurath as Foreign Minister. Ribbentrop&#x27;s appointment has generally been seen as an indication that German foreign policy was moving in a more radical direction. In contrast to Neurath&#x27;s cautious and less bellicose nature, Ribbentrop unequivocally supported war in 1938 and 1939.

Ribbentrop&#x27;s time as Foreign Minister can be divided into three periods. In the first, from 1938 to 1939, he tried to persuade other states to align themselves with Germany for the coming war. In the second, from 1939 to 1943, Ribbentrop attempted to persuade other states to enter the war on Germany&#x27;s side or at least to maintain pro-German neutrality. He was also involved in Operation Willi, an attempt to convince the former King Edward VIII to lobby his brother, now the king, on behalf of Germany. Many historians have suggested that Hitler was prepared to reinstate the Duke of Windsor as king in the hope of establishing a fascist Britain. If Edward would agree to work openly with Nazi Germany, he would be given financial assistance and would hopefully come to be a &quot;compliant&quot; king. Reportedly, 50 million Swiss francs were set aside for that purpose. The plan was never realised.

In the final phase, from 1943 to 1945, he had the task of trying to keep Germany&#x27;s allies from leaving her side. During the course of all three periods, Ribbentrop frequently met leaders and diplomats from Italy, Japan, Romania, Spain, Bulgaria, and Hungary. During all of that time, Ribbentrop feuded with various other Nazi leaders. As time went by, Ribbentrop started to oust the Foreign Office&#x27;s old diplomats from their senior positions and replace them with men from the &quot;Dienststelle&quot;. As early as 1938, 32 per cent of the offices in the Foreign Ministry were held by men who previously served in the &quot;Dienststelle&quot;.

One of Ribbentrop&#x27;s first acts as Foreign Minister was to achieve a total volte-face in Germany&#x27;s Far Eastern policies. Ribbentrop was instrumental in February 1938 in persuading Hitler to recognize the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo and to renounce German claims upon its former colonies in the Pacific, which were now held by Japan. By April 1938, Ribbentrop had ended all German arms shipments to China and had all of the German Army officers serving with the Kuomintang government of Chiang Kai-shek recalled, with the threat that the families of the officers in China would be sent to concentration camps if the officers did not return to Germany immediately. In return, the Germans received little thanks from the Japanese, who refused to allow any new German businesses to be set up in the part of China they had occupied and continued with their policy of attempting to exclude all existing German and all other Western businesses from Japanese-occupied China. At the same time, the end of the informal Sino-German alliance led Chiang to terminate all concessions and contracts held by German companies in Kuomintang China.

===Munich Agreement and Czechoslovakia&#x27;s destruction===
Ernst von Weizsäcker, the State Secretary from 1938 to 1943, opposed the general trend in German foreign policy towards attacking the First Czechoslovak Republic and feared that it might cause a general war that Germany would lose. Weizsäcker had no moral objections to the idea of destroying Czechoslovakia but opposed only the timing of the attack. He favoured the idea of a &quot;chemical&quot; destruction of Czechoslovakia in which Germany, Hungary and Poland would close their frontiers to destabilise Czechoslovakia economically. He strongly disliked Ribbentrop&#x27;s idea of a &quot;mechanical&quot; destruction of Czechoslovakia by war, which he saw as too risky. However, despite all of their reservations and fears about Ribbentrop, whom they saw as recklessly seeking to plunge Germany into a general war before the &quot;Reich&quot; was ready, neither Weizsäcker nor any of the other professional diplomats were prepared to confront their chief.
Before the Anglo-German summit at Berchtesgaden on 15 September 1938, the British Ambassador, Sir Nevile Henderson, and Weizsäcker worked out a private arrangement for Hitler and Chamberlain to meet with no advisers present as a way of excluding the ultrahawkish Ribbentrop from attending the talks. Hitler&#x27;s interpreter, Paul Schmidt, later recalled that it was &quot;felt that our Foreign Minister would prove a disturbing element&quot; at the Berchtesgaden summit. In a moment of pique at his exclusion from the Chamberlain-Hitler meeting, Ribbentrop refused to hand over Schmidt&#x27;s notes of the summit to Chamberlain, a move that caused much annoyance on the British side. Ribbentrop spent the last weeks of September 1938 looking forward very much to the German-Czechoslovak war that he expected to break out on 1 October 1938. Ribbentrop regarded the Munich Agreement as a diplomatic defeat for Germany, as it deprived Germany of the opportunity to wage the war to destroy Czechoslovakia that Ribbentrop wanted to see. The Sudetenland issue, which was the ostensible subject of the German-Czechoslovak dispute, had been a pretext for German aggression. During the Munich Conference, Ribbentrop spent much of his time brooding unhappily in the corners. Ribbentrop told the head of Hitler&#x27;s Press Office, Fritz Hesse, that the Munich Agreement was &quot;first-class stupidity... All it means is that we have to fight the English in a year, when they will be better armed... It would have been much better if war had come now&quot;. Like Hitler, Ribbentrop was determined that in the next crisis, Germany would not have its professed demands met in another Munich-type summit and that the next crisis to be caused by Germany would result in the war that Chamberlain had &quot;cheated&quot; the Germans out of at Munich.

In the aftermath of Munich, Hitler was in a violently anti-British mood caused in part by his rage over being &quot;cheated&quot; out of the war to &quot;annihilate&quot; Czechoslovakia that he very much wanted to have in 1938 and in part by his realisation that Britain would neither ally itself nor stand aside in regard to Germany&#x27;s ambition to dominate Europe. As a consequence, Britain was considered after Munich to be the main enemy of the &quot;Reich&quot;, and as a result, the influence of ardently Anglophobic Ribbentrop correspondingly rose with Hitler.

Partly for economic reasons, and partly out of fury over being &quot;cheated&quot; out of war in 1938, Hitler decided to destroy the rump state of Czecho-Slovakia, as Czechoslovakia had been renamed in October 1938, early in 1939. Ribbentrop played an important role in setting in motion the crisis that was to result in the end of Czecho-Slovakia by ordering German diplomats in Bratislava to contact Father Jozef Tiso, the premier of the Slovak regional government, and pressure him to declare independence from Prague. When Tiso proved reluctant to do so on the grounds that the autonomy that had existed since October 1938 was sufficient for him and that to completely sever links with the Czechs would leave Slovakia open to being annexed by Hungary, Ribbentrop had the German embassy in Budapest contact the regent, Admiral Miklós Horthy. Horthy was advised that the Germans might be open to having more of Hungary restored to its former borders and that the Hungarians should best start concentrating troops on their northern border at once if they were serious about changing their frontiers. Upon hearing of the Hungarian mobilization, Tiso was presented with the choice of either declaring independence, with the understanding that the new state would be in the German sphere of influence, or seeing all of Slovakia absorbed into Hungary. As a result, Tiso had the Slovak regional government issue a declaration of independence on 14 March 1939; the ensuing crisis in Czech-Slovak relations was used as a pretext to summon Czecho-Slovak President Emil Hácha to Berlin over his &quot;failure&quot; to keep order in his country. On the night of 14–15 March 1939, Ribbentrop played a key role in the German occupation of the Czech part of Czecho-Slovakia by bullying Hácha into transforming his country into a German protectorate at a meeting in the Reich Chancellery in Berlin. On 15 March 1939, German troops occupied the Czech areas of Czecho-Slovakia, which then became the &quot;Reich&quot; Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.

On 20 March 1939, Ribbentrop summoned Lithuanian Foreign Minister Juozas Urbšys to Berlin and informed him that if a Lithuanian plenipotentiary did not arrive at once to negotiate to turn over the Memelland to Germany the Luftwaffe would raze Kaunas to the ground. As a result of Ribbentrop&#x27;s ultimatum on 23 March, the Lithuanians agreed to return Memel (modern Klaipėda, Lithuania) to Germany.

In March 1939, Ribbentrop assigned the largely ethnically Ukrainian Sub-Carpathian Ruthenia region of Czecho-Slovakia, which had just proclaimed its independence as the Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine, to Hungary, which then proceeded to annex it after a short war. This was significant as there had been many fears in the Soviet Union in the 1930s that the Germans would use Ukrainian nationalism as a tool to break up the Soviet Union. The establishment of an autonomous Ukrainian region in Czecho-Slovakia in October 1938 had prompted a major Soviet media campaign against its existence on the grounds that this was part of a Western plot to support separatism in Soviet Ukraine. By allowing the Hungarians to destroy Europe&#x27;s only Ukrainian state, Ribbentrop had signified that Germany was not interested, at least for now, in sponsoring Ukrainian nationalism. That, in turn, helped to improve German-Soviet relations by demonstrating that German foreign policy was now primarily anti-Western rather than anti-Soviet.

===French-German non-aggression pact, December 1938===

In December 1938, during Ribbentrop&#x27;s visit to Paris to sign the largely-meaningless French-German non-aggression pact, he had conversations with French Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet, which Ribbentrop later claimed included a promise that France would recognize all of Eastern Europe as Germany&#x27;s exclusive sphere of influence.

===German threat to Poland and British guarantee===
Initially, Germany hoped to transform Poland into a satellite state, with Ribbentrop and Japanese military attache Hiroshi Ōshima trying to convince Poland to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. By March 1939, German demands had been rejected by the Poles three times, which led Hitler to decide, with enthusiastic support from Ribbentrop, upon the destruction of Poland as the main German foreign policy goal of 1939. On 21 March 1939, Hitler first went public with his demand that Danzig rejoin the &quot;Reich&quot; and for &quot;extra-territorial&quot; roads across the Polish Corridor. That marked a significant escalation of the German pressure on Poland, which until then had been confined to private meetings between German and Polish diplomats. The same day, on 21 March 1939, Ribbentrop presented a set of demands to the Polish Ambassador Józef Lipski about Poland allowing the Free City of Danzig to return to Germany in such violent and extreme language that it led the Poles to fear their country was on the verge of an immediate German attack. Ribbentrop had used such extreme language, particularly his remark that if Germany had a different policy towards the Soviet Union then Poland would cease to exist, that it led to the Poles ordering partial mobilisation and placing their armed forces on the highest state of alert on 23 March 1939. In a protest note at Ribbentrop&#x27;s behaviour, Poland&#x27;s Foreign Minister Józef Beck reminded him that Poland was an independent country and not some sort of German protectorate that Ribbentrop could bully at will. Ribbentrop, in turn, sent out instructions to the German Ambassador in Warsaw, Count Hans-Adolf von Moltke, that if Poland agreed to the German demands, Germany would ensure that Poland could partition Slovakia with Hungary and be ensured of German support for annexing Ukraine. If the Poles rejected his offer, Poland would be considered an enemy of the &quot;Reich&quot;. On 26 March, in an extremely stormy meeting with the Polish Ambassador Józef Lipski, Ribbentrop accused the Poles of attempting to bully Germany by their partial mobilisation and violently attacked them for offering consideration only of the German demand about the &quot;extra-territorial&quot; roads. The meeting ended with Ribbentrop screaming that if Poland invaded the Free City of Danzig, Germany would go to war to destroy Poland. When the news of Ribbentrop&#x27;s remarks was leaked to the Polish press, despite Beck&#x27;s order to the censors on 27 March, it caused anti-German riots in Poland with the local Nazi Party headquarters in the mixed town of Lininco destroyed by a mob. On 28 March, Beck told Moltke that any attempt to change the status of Danzig unilaterally would be regarded by Poland as a &quot;casus belli&quot;. Though the Germans were not planning an attack on Poland in March 1939, Ribbentrop&#x27;s bullying behaviour towards the Poles destroyed any faint chance of Poland allowing Danzig to return to Germany.

The German occupation of the Czech areas of Czecho-Slovakia on 15 March, in total contravention of the Munich Agreement, which had been signed less than six months before, infuriated British and French public opinion and lost Germany any sympathy. Such was the state of public fury that it appeared possible for several days afterwards that the Chamberlain government might fall because of a backbench rebellion. Even Ribbentrop&#x27;s standard line that Germany was only reacting to an unjust Versailles Treaty and wanted peace with everyone, which had worked so well in the past, failed to carry weight. Reflecting the changed mood, Conservative MP Duff Cooper wrote in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot;:

Some of us are getting rather tired of the sanctimonious attitude which seeks to take upon our shoulders the blame for every crime committed in Europe. If Germany had been left stronger in 1919 she would sooner have been in a position to do what she is doing today.

Moreover, the British government had genuinely believed in the German claim that it was only the Sudetenland that concerned it and that Germany was not seeking to dominate Europe. By occupying the Czech parts of Czecho-Slovakia, Germany lost all credibility for its claim to be only righting the alleged wrongs of Versailles.

Shortly afterwards, false reports spread in mid-March 1939 by the Romanian minister in London, Virgil Tilea, that his country was on the verge of an immediate German attack, led to a dramatic U-turn in the British policy of resisting commitments in Eastern Europe. Ribbentrop truthfully denied that Germany was going to invade Romania. But his denials were expressed in almost identical language to the denials that he had issued in early March, when he had denied that anything was being planned against the Czechs; thus they actually increased the &quot;Romanian war scare&quot; of March 1939. From the British point of view, it was regarded as highly desirable to keep Romania and its oil out of German hands. Since Germany itself had hardly any sources of oil, the ability of the Royal Navy to impose a blockade represented a British trump card to deter and, if necessary, win a war. If Germany were to occupy oil-rich Romania, that would undercut all of the British strategic assumptions on Germany&#x27;s need to import oil from the Americas. Since Poland was regarded as the East European state with the most powerful army, Poland had to be tied to Britain as the best way of ensuring Polish support for Romania; it was the obvious &quot;quid pro quo&quot; that Britain would have to do something for Polish security if the Poles were to be induced to do something for Romanian security.

On 31 March 1939, Chamberlain announced before the House of Commons the British &quot;guarantee&quot; of Poland, which committed Britain to go to war to defend Polish independence, though pointedly the &quot;guarantee&quot; excluded Polish frontiers. As a result of the &quot;guarantee&quot; of Poland, Hitler began to speak with increasing frequency of a British &quot;encirclement&quot; policy, which he used as the excuse for denouncing, in a speech before the &quot;Reichstag&quot; on 28 April 1939, the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the Non-Aggression Pact with Poland.

===Turkey===
In late March, Ribbentrop had the German &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; in Turkey, Hans Kroll, start pressuring Turkey into an alliance with Germany. The Turks assured Kroll that they had no objection to Germany making the Balkans its economic sphere of influence but would regard any move to make the Balkans into a sphere of German political influence as most unwelcome.

In April 1939, when Ribbentrop announced at a secret meeting of the senior staff of the Foreign Office that Germany was ending talks with Poland and was instead going to destroy it in an operation late that year, the news was greeted joyfully by those present. Anti-Polish feelings had long been rampant in the agency and so, in marked contrast to their cool attitude about attacking Czechoslovakia in 1938, diplomats such as Weizsäcker were highly enthusiastic about the prospect of war with Poland in 1939. Professional diplomats such as Weizsäcker who had never accepted the legitimacy of Poland, which they saw as an &quot;abomination&quot; created by the Versailles Treaty, were wholehearted in their support of a war to wipe Poland off the map. The degree of unity within the German government with both the diplomats and the military united in their support of Hitler&#x27;s anti-Polish policy, which stood in contrast to their views the previous year about destroying Czechoslovakia, very much encouraged Hitler and Ribbentrop with their chosen course of action.

In April 1939, Ribbentrop received intelligence that Britain and Turkey were negotiating an alliance intended to keep Germany out of the Balkans. On 23 April 1939, Turkish Foreign Minister Şükrü Saracoğlu told the British ambassador of Turkish fears of Italian claims of the Mediterranean as &quot;Mare Nostrum&quot; and German control of the Balkans, and he suggested an Anglo-Soviet-Turkish alliance as the best way of countering the Axis. As the Germans had broken the Turkish diplomatic codes, Ribbentrop was well aware as he warned in a circular to German embassies that Anglo-Turkish talks had gone much further &quot;than what the Turks would care to tell us&quot;. Ribbentrop appointed Franz von Papen Germany&#x27;s ambassador in Turkey with instructions to win it to an alliance with Germany. Ribbentrop had been attempting to appoint Papen as an ambassador to Turkey since April 1938. His first attempt ended in failure when Turkish President Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who remembered Papen well with considerable distaste from World War I, refused to accept him as ambassador and complained in private the nomination of Papen must have been meant as some sort of sick German joke. The German embassy in Ankara had been vacant ever since the retirement of the previous ambassador Friedrich von Keller in November 1938, and Ribbentrop was able to get the Turks to accept Papen as ambassador only when Saracoğlu complained to Kroll in April 1939 about when the Germans were ever going to send a new ambassador. Papen&#x27;s attempt to address Turkish fears of Italian expansionism by getting Ribbentrop to have Count Galeazzo Ciano promise the Turks that they had nothing to fear from Italy backfired when the Turks found the Italo-German effort to have been patronising and insulting.

Instead of focusing on talking to the Turks, Ribbentrop and Papen became entangled in a feud over Papen&#x27;s demand to bypass Ribbentrop and to send his dispatches straight to Hitler. As a former chancellor, Papen had been granted the privilege of bypassing the Foreign Minister while he was ambassador to Austria. Ribbentrop&#x27;s friendship with Papen, which went back to 1918, ended over that issue. At the same time, Ribbentrop took to shouting at the Turkish Ambassador in Berlin, Mehemet Hamdi Arpag, as part of the effort to win Turkey over as a German ally. Ribbentrop believed that Turks were so stupid that one had to shout at them to make them understand. One of the consequences of Ribbentrop&#x27;s heavyhanded behaviour was the signing of the Anglo-Turkish alliance on 12 May 1939.

From early 1939 onwards, Ribbentrop had become the leading advocate within the German government of reaching an understanding with the Soviet Union as the best way of pursuing both the short-term anti-Polish and long-term anti-British foreign policy goals. Ribbentrop first seems to have considered the idea of a pact with the Soviet Union after an unsuccessful visit to Warsaw in January 1939, when the Poles again refused Ribbentrop&#x27;s demands about Danzig, the &quot;extra-territorial&quot; roads across the Polish Corridor and the Anti-Comintern Pact. During the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact negotiations, Ribbentrop was overjoyed by a report from his ambassador in Moscow, Count Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg, of a speech by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin before the 18th Party Congress in March 1939 that was strongly anti-Western, which Schulenburg reported meant that the Soviet Union might be seeking an accord with Germany. Ribbentrop followed up Schulenburg&#x27;s report by sending Dr. Julius Schnurre of the Foreign Office&#x27;s trade department to negotiate a German-Soviet economic agreement. At the same time, Ribbentrop&#x27;s efforts to convert the Anti-Comintern Pact into an anti-British alliance met with considerable hostility from the Japanese in late 1938 and early 1939, but with the Italians, Ribbentrop enjoyed some apparent success. Because of Japanese opposition to participation in an anti-British alliance, Ribbentrop decided to settle for a bilateral German-Italian anti-British treaty. Ribbentrop&#x27;s efforts were crowned with success with the signing of the Pact of Steel in May 1939, but it was accomplished only by falsely assuring Mussolini that there would be no war for the next three years.

===Pact with Soviet Union and outbreak of World War II===
Ribbentrop played a key role in the conclusion of a Soviet-German non-aggression pact, the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, in 1939 and in the diplomatic action surrounding the attack on Poland. In public, Ribbentrop expressed great fury at the Polish refusal to allow for Danzig&#x27;s return to the &quot;Reich&quot; or to grant Polish permission for the &quot;extra-territorial&quot; highways, but since the matters were intended after March 1939 to be only a pretext for German aggression, Ribbentrop always refused privately to allow for any talks between German and Polish diplomats about those matters. Ribbentrop feared that if German–Polish talks took place, there was the danger that the Poles might back down and agree to the German demands, as the Czechoslovaks had done in 1938 under Anglo-French pressure, depriving the Germans of their excuse for aggression. To block German–Polish diplomatic talks further, Ribbentrop had the German Ambassador to Poland, Count Hans-Adolf von Moltke, recalled, and he refused to see the Polish ambassador, Józef Lipski. On 25 May 1939, Ribbentrop sent a secret message to Moscow to tell the Soviet Foreign Commissar, Vyacheslav Molotov, that if Germany attacked Poland &quot;Russia&#x27;s special interests would be taken into consideration&quot;.

Throughout 1939, Hitler always privately referred to Britain as his main opponent but portrayed the coming destruction of Poland as a necessary prelude to any war with Britain. Ribbentrop informed Hitler that any war with Poland would last for only 24 hours and that the British would be so stunned with this display of German power that they would not honour their commitments. Along the same lines, Ribbentrop told Ciano on 5 May 1939, &quot;It is certain that within a few months not one Frenchman nor a single Englishman will go to war for Poland&quot;.

Ribbentrop supported his analysis of the situation by showing Hitler only the diplomatic dispatches that supported his view that neither Britain nor France would honour their commitments to Poland. In that, Ribbentrop was particularly supported by the German Ambassador in London, Herbert von Dirksen, who reported that Chamberlain knew &quot;the social structure of Britain, even the conception of the British Empire, would not survive the chaos of even a victorious war&quot; and so would back down over Poland. Furthermore, Ribbentrop had the German embassy in London provide translations from pro-appeasement newspapers such as the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and the &quot;Daily Express&quot; for Hitler&#x27;s benefit, which had the effect of making it seem that British public opinion was more strongly against going to war for Poland than it actually was. The British historian Victor Rothwell wrote that the newspapers used by Ribbentrop to provide his press summaries for Hitler were out of touch not only with British public opinion but also with British government policy in regard to Poland. The press summaries Ribbentrop provided were particularly important, as Ribbentrop had managed to convince Hitler that the British government secretly controlled the British press, and just as in Germany, nothing appeared in the British press that the British government did not want to appear. Furthermore, the Germans had broken the British diplomatic codes and were reading the messages between the Foreign Office in London to and from the Embassy in Warsaw. The decrypts showed that there was much tension in Anglo-Polish relations, with the British pressuring the Poles to allow Danzig to rejoin the &quot;Reich&quot; and the Poles staunchly resisting all efforts to pressure them into concessions to Germany. On the basis of such decrypts, Hitler and Ribbentrop believed that the British were bluffing with their warnings that they would go to war to defend Polish independence. In mid-1939, Ribbentrop sabotaged all efforts at a peaceful solution to the Danzig dispute, leading the American historian Gerhard Weinberg to comment that &quot;perhaps Chamberlain&#x27;s haggard appearance did him more credit than Ribbentrop&#x27;s beaming smile&quot;, as the countdown to a war that would kill tens of millions inexorably gathered pace.

Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s European Policy in 1939 was based upon creating a &quot;peace front&quot; of alliances linking Western and Eastern European states to serve as a &quot;tripwire&quot; meant to deter any act of German aggression. The new &quot;containment&quot; strategy adopted in March 1939 was to give firm warnings to Berlin, increase the pace of British re-armament and attempt to form an interlocking network of alliances that would block German aggression anywhere in Europe by creating such a formidable deterrence to aggression that Hitler could not rationally choose that option. Underlying the basis of the &quot;containment&quot; of Germany were the so-called &quot;X documents&quot;, provided by Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, in 1938–1939. They suggested that the German economy, under the strain of massive military spending, was on the verge of collapse and led British policy-makers to the conclusion that if Hitler could be deterred from war and that if his regime was &quot;contained&quot; long enough, the German economy would collapse, and, with it, presumably the Nazi regime. At the same time, British policymakers were afraid that if Hitler were &quot;contained&quot; and faced with a collapsing economy, he would commit a desperate &quot;mad dog act&quot; of aggression as a way of lashing out. Hence, emphasis was put on pressuring the Poles to allow the return of Danzig to Germany as a way of resolving the crisis peacefully by allowing Hitler to back down without him losing face. As part of a dual strategy to avoid war via deterrence and appeasement of Germany, British leaders warned that they would go to war if Germany attacked Poland, but at the same time, they tried to avoid war by holding unofficial talks with would-be peacemakers such as the British newspaper proprietor Lord Kemsley, the Swedish businessman Axel Wenner-Gren and another Swedish businessman Birger Dahlerus, who attempted to work out the basis for a peaceful return of Danzig.

In May 1939, as part of his efforts to bully Turkey into joining the Axis, Ribbentrop had arranged for the cancellation of the delivery of 60 heavy howitzers from the Škoda Works, which the Turks had paid for in advance. The German refusal either to deliver the artillery pieces or refund the 125 million &quot;Reichsmarks&quot; that the Turks had paid for them was to be a major strain on German-Turkish relations in 1939 and had the effect of causing Turkey&#x27;s politically powerful army to resist Ribbentrop&#x27;s entreaties to join the Axis. As part of the fierce diplomatic competition in Ankara in the first half of 1939 between von Papen and French Ambassador René Massigli with British Ambassador, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen to win the allegiance of Turkey to either the Axis or the Allies, Ribbentrop suffered a major reversal in July 1939 when Massigli was able to arrange for major French arms shipments to Turkey on credit to replace the weapons that the Germans had refused to deliver to the Turks.

In June 1939, Franco-German relations were strained when the head of the French section of the &quot;Dienststelle Ribbentrop&quot;, Otto Abetz, was expelled from France following allegations that he had bribed two French newspaper editors to print pro-German articles. Ribbentrop was enraged by Abetz&#x27;s expulsion and attacked Count Johannes von Welczeck, the German Ambassador in Paris, over his failure to have the French readmit him. In July 1939, Ribbentrop&#x27;s claims about an alleged statement of December 1938 made by French Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet were to lead to a lengthy war of words via a series of letters to the French newspapers between Ribbentrop and Bonnet over precisely what Bonnet had said to Ribbentrop.

On 11 August 1939, Ribbentrop met the Italian Foreign Minister, Count Galeazzo Ciano, and the Italian Ambassador to Germany, Count Bernardo Attolico, in Salzburg. During that meeting, both Ciano and Attolico were horrified to learn from Ribbentrop that Germany planned to attack Poland and that the Danzig issue was just a pretext for aggression. When Ciano asked if there was anything Italy could do to broker a Polish-German settlement that would avert a war, he was told by Ribbentrop, &quot;We want war!&quot; Ribbentrop expressed his firmly held belief that neither Britain nor France would go to war for Poland, but if that occurred, he fully expected the Italians to honour the terms of the Pact of Steel, which was both an offensive and defensive treaty, and to declare war not only on Poland but on the Western powers if necessary. Ribbentrop told his Italian guests that &quot;the localisation of the conflict is certain&quot; and &quot;the probability of victory is infinite&quot;. Ribbentrop brushed away Ciano&#x27;s fears of a general war. He claimed, &quot;France and England cannot intervene because they are insufficiently prepared militarily and because they have no means of injuring Germany&quot;. Ciano complained furiously that Ribbentrop had violated his promise given earlier that year, when Italy signed the Pact of Steel, that there would be no war for the next three years. Ciano said that it was absurd to believe that the &quot;Reich&quot; could attack Poland without triggering a wider war and that now the Italians were left with the choice of going to war when they needed three more years to rearm or being forced into the humiliation of having to violate the terms of the Pact of Steel by declaring neutrality, which would make the Italians appear cowardly. Ciano complained in his diary that his arguments &quot;had no effect&quot; on Ribbentrop, who simply refused to believe any information that did not fit in with his preconceived notions. Despite Ciano&#x27;s efforts to persuade Ribbentrop to put off the attack on Poland until 1942 to allow the Italians time to get ready for war, Ribbentrop was adamant that Germany had no interest in a diplomatic solution of the Danzig question but wanted a war to wipe Poland off the map. The Salzburg meeting marked the moment when Ciano&#x27;s dislike of Ribbentrop was transformed into outright hatred and of the beginning of his disillusionment with the pro-German foreign policy that he had championed.

On 21 August 1939, Hitler received a message from Stalin: &quot;The Soviet Government has instructed me to say they agree to Herr von Ribbentrop&#x27;s arrival on 23 August&quot;. The same day, Hitler ordered German mobilisation. The extent that Hitler was influenced by Ribbentrop&#x27;s advice can be seen in Hitler&#x27;s orders for a limited mobilisation against Poland alone. Weizsäcker recorded in his diary throughout the first half of 1939 repeated statements from Hitler that any German–Polish war would be a localized conflict and that there was no danger of a general war if the Soviet Union could be persuaded to stay neutral. Hitler believed that British policy was based upon securing Soviet support for Poland, which led him to perform a diplomatic U-turn and support Ribbentrop&#x27;s policy of rapprochement with the Soviet Union as the best way of ensuring a local war. That was especially the case as decrypts showed the British military attaché to Poland arguing that Britain could not save Poland in the event of a German attack and that only Soviet support offered the prospect of Poland holding out.
The signing of the Non-Aggression Pact in Moscow on 23 August 1939 was the crowning achievement of Ribbentrop&#x27;s career. He flew to Moscow, where, over the course of a 13-hour visit, Ribbentrop signed both the Non-Aggression Pact and the secret protocols, which partitioned much of Eastern Europe between the Soviets and the Germans. Ribbentrop had expected to see only the Soviet Foreign Commissar Vyacheslav Molotov and was most surprised to be holding talks with Joseph Stalin himself. During his trip to Moscow, Ribbentrop&#x27;s talks with Stalin and Molotov proceeded very cordially and efficiently with the exception of the question of Latvia, which Hitler had instructed Ribbentrop to try to claim for Germany. Ribbentrop had been instructed to claim the Daugava as the future boundary between the Greater Germanic Reich and the Soviet Union, but had also been ordered to grant extensive concessions to Stalin. When Stalin claimed Latvia for the Soviet Union, Ribbentrop was forced to telephone Berlin for permission from Hitler to concede Latvia to the Soviets. After finishing his talks with Stalin and Molotov, Ribbentrop, at a dinner with the Soviet leaders, launched into a lengthy diatribe against the British Empire, with frequent interjections of approval from Stalin, and exchanged toasts with Stalin in honour of German-Soviet friendship. For a brief moment in August 1939, Ribbentrop convinced Hitler that the Non-Aggression Pact with the Soviet Union would cause the fall of the Chamberlain government and lead to a new British government that would abandon the Poles to their fate. Ribbentrop argued that with Soviet economic support, especially in the form of oil, Germany was now immune to the effects of a British naval blockade and so the British would never take on Germany. On 23 August 1939, at a secret meeting of the &quot;Reich&quot;&#x27;s top military leadership at the Berghof, Hitler argued that neither Britain nor France would go to war for Poland without the Soviet Union, and fixed &quot;X-Day&quot;, the date for the invasion of Poland, for 26 August. Hitler added, &quot;My only fear is that at the last moment some &quot;Schweinehund&quot; will make a proposal for mediation&quot;. Unlike Hitler, who saw the Non-Aggression Pact as merely a pragmatic device forced on him by circumstances, the refusal of Britain or Poland to play the roles that Hitler had allocated to them, Ribbentrop regarded the Non-Aggression Pact as integral to his anti-British policy.

The signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact on 23 August 1939 not only won Germany an informal alliance with the Soviet Union but also neutralized Anglo-French attempts to win Turkey to the &quot;peace front&quot;. The Turks always believed that it was essential to have the Soviet Union as an ally to counter Germany, and the signing of the pact undercut completely the assumptions behind Turkish security policy. The Anglo-French effort to include the Balkans into the &quot;peace front&quot; had always rested on the assumption that the cornerstone of the &quot;peace front&quot; in the Balkans was to be Turkey, the regional superpower. Because the Balkans were rich in raw materials such as iron, zinc and Romanian oil, which could help Germany survive a British blockade, it was viewed as highly important by the Allies to keep German influence in the Balkans to a minimum. That was the principal motivation behind efforts to link British promises to support Turkey in the event of an Italian attack, in exchange for Turkish promises to help defend Romania from a German attack. British and French leaders believed that the deterrent value of the &quot;peace front&quot; could be increased if Turkey were a member, and the Turkish Straits were open to Allied ships. That would allow the Allies to send troops and supplies to Romania over the Black Sea and through Romania to Poland.

On 25 August 1939, Ribbentrop&#x27;s influence with Hitler wavered for a moment when the news reached Berlin of the ratification of the Anglo-Polish military alliance and a personal message from Mussolini that told Hitler that Italy would dishonour the Pact of Steel if Germany attacked Poland. This was especially damaging to Ribbentrop, as he always assured Hitler, &quot;Italy&#x27;s attitude is determined by the Rome-Berlin Axis&quot;. As a result of the message from Rome and the ratification of the Anglo-Polish treaty, Hitler cancelled the invasion of Poland planned for 26 August but ordered it held back until 1 September to give Germany some time to break up the unfavourable international alignment. Though Ribbentrop continued to argue that Britain and France were bluffing, both he and Hitler were prepared, as a last resort, to risk a general war by invading Poland. Because of Ribbentrop&#x27;s firmly-held views that Britain was Germany&#x27;s most dangerous enemy and that an Anglo-German war was inevitable, it scarcely mattered to him when his much-desired war with Britain came. The Greek historian Aristotle Kaillis wrote that it was Ribbentrop&#x27;s influence with Hitler and his insistence that the Western powers would fail to go to war for Poland that was the most important reason that Hitler did not cancel &quot;Fall Weiß&quot;, the German invasion of Poland, altogether, instead of only postponing &quot;X-day&quot; for six days. Ribbentrop told Hitler that his sources showed that Britain would not be militarily prepared to take on Germany at the earliest until 1940 or more probably 1941, so that meant that the British were bluffing. Even if the British were serious in their warnings of war, Ribbentrop took the view that since a war with Britain was inevitable, the risk of a war with Britain was acceptable and so he argued that Germany should not shy away from such challenges.

On 27 August 1939, Chamberlain sent a letter to Hitler that was intended to counteract reports Chamberlain had heard from intelligence sources in Berlin that Ribbentrop had convinced Hitler that the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact would ensure that Britain would abandon Poland. In his letter, Chamberlain wrote:

Ribbentrop told Hitler that Chamberlain&#x27;s letter was just a bluff and urged his master to call it.

On the night of 30–31 August 1939, Ribbentrop had an extremely heated exchange with British Ambassador Sir Nevile Henderson, who objected to Ribbentrop&#x27;s demand, given at about midnight, that if a Polish plenipotentiary did not arrive in Berlin that night to discuss the German &quot;final offer&quot;, the responsibility for the outbreak of war would not rest on the &quot;Reich&quot;. Henderson stated that the terms of the German &quot;final offer&quot; were very reasonable but argued that Ribbentrop&#x27;s time limit for Polish acceptance of the &quot;final offer&quot; was most unreasonable, and he also demanded to know why Ribbentrop insisted upon seeing a special Polish plenipotentiary and could not present the &quot;final offer&quot; to Ambassador Józef Lipski or provide a written copy of the &quot;final offer&quot;. The Henderson–Ribbentrop meeting became so tense that the two men almost came to blows. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg described the Henderson–Ribbentrop meeting:

When Joachim von Ribbentrop refused to give a copy of the German demands to the British Ambassador [Henderson] at midnight of 30–31 August 1939, the two almost came to blows. Ambassador Henderson, who had long advocated concessions to Germany, recognized that here was a deliberately conceived alibi the German government had prepared for a war it was determined to start. No wonder Henderson was angry; von Ribbentrop on the other hand could see war ahead and went home beaming.

As intended by Ribbentrop, the narrow time limit for acceptance of the &quot;final offer&quot; made it impossible for the British government to contact the Polish government in time about the German offer, let alone for the Poles to arrange for a Polish plenipotentiary envoy to arrive in Berlin that night, thereby allowing Ribbentrop to claim that the Poles had rejected the German &quot;final offer&quot;. As it was, a special meeting of the British cabinet called to consider the &quot;final offer&quot; and declined to pass on the message to Warsaw under the grounds that it was not a serious proposal on the part of Berlin. The &quot;rejection&quot; of the German proposal was one of the pretexts used for the German aggression against Poland on 1 September 1939. The British historian D.C. Watt wrote, &quot;Two hours later, Berlin Radio broadcast the sixteen points, adding that Poland had rejected them. Thanks to Ribbentrop, they had never even seen them&quot;. On 31 August, Ribbentrop met with Ambassador Attolico to tell him that Poland&#x27;s &quot;rejection&quot; of the &quot;generous&quot; German 16-point peace plan meant that Germany had no interest in Mussolini&#x27;s offer to call a conference about the status of Danzig. Besides the Polish &quot;rejection&quot; of the German &quot;final offer&quot;, the aggression against Poland was justified with the Gleiwitz incident and other SS-staged incidents on the German–Polish border.

As soon as the news broke in the morning of 1 September 1939 that Germany had invaded Poland, Mussolini launched another desperate peace mediation plan intended to stop the German–Polish war from becoming a world war. Mussolini&#x27;s motives were in no way altruistic. Instead, he was motivated entirely by a wish to escape the self-imposed trap of the Pact of Steel, which obliged Italy to go to war while the country was entirely unprepared. If he suffered the humiliation of having to declare neutrality, it would make him appear cowardly. French Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet, acting on his own initiative, told the Italian Ambassador to France, Baron Raffaele Guariglia, that France had accepted Mussolini&#x27;s peace plan. Bonnet had Havas issue a statement at midnight on 1 September: &quot;The French government has today, as have several other Governments, received an Italian proposal looking to the resolution of Europe&#x27;s difficulties. After due consideration, the French government has given a &#x27;positive response&#x27;&quot;. Though the French and the Italians were serious about Mussolini&#x27;s peace plan, which called for an immediate ceasefire and a four-power conference in the manner of the Munich conference of 1938 to consider Poland&#x27;s borders, British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax stated that unless the Germans withdrew from Poland immediately, Britain would not attend the proposed conference. Ribbentrop finally scuttled Mussolini&#x27;s peace plan by stating that Germany had no interest in a ceasefire, a withdrawal from Poland or attending the proposed peace conference.

On the morning of 3 September 1939, when Chamberlain followed through with his threat of a British declaration of war if Germany attacked Poland, a visibly-shocked Hitler asked Ribbentrop &quot;Now what?&quot;, a question to which Ribbentrop had no answer except to state that there would be a &quot;similar message&quot; forthcoming from French Ambassador Robert Coulondre, who arrived later that afternoon to present the French declaration of war. Weizsäcker later recalled, &quot;On 3 Sept., when the British and French declared war, Hitler was surprised, after all, and was to begin with, at a loss&quot;. The British historian Richard Overy wrote that what Hitler thought he was starting in September 1939 was only a local war between Germany and Poland and that his decision to do so was largely based on a vast underestimate of the risks of a general war. In effect, Ribbentrop&#x27;s influence made Hitler go to war in 1939 with the country he wanted as his ally, the United Kingdom, and ally with the country he wanted as his enemy, the Soviet Union.

After the outbreak of World War II, Ribbentrop spent most of the Polish campaign travelling with Hitler. On 27 September 1939, Ribbentrop made a second visit to Moscow. There, at meetings with the Soviet Foreign Commissar Vyacheslav Molotov and Joseph Stalin, he was forced to agree to revising the Secret Protocols of the Non-Aggression Pact in the Soviet Union&#x27;s favour, most notably agreeing to Stalin&#x27;s demand for Lithuania to go to the Soviet Union. The imposition of the British blockade had made the &quot;Reich&quot; highly dependent upon Soviet economic support, which placed Stalin in a strong negotiating position with Ribbentrop. On 1 March 1940, Ribbentrop received Sumner Welles, the American Under-Secretary of State, who was on a peace mission for US President Franklin Roosevelt, and did his best to abuse his American guest. Welles asked Ribbentrop under what terms Germany might be willing to negotiate a compromise peace, before the Phoney War became a real war. Ribbentrop told Welles that only a total German victory &quot;could give us the peace we want&quot;. Welles reported to Roosevelt that Ribbentrop had a &quot;completely closed and very stupid mind&quot;. On 10 March 1940, Ribbentrop visited Rome to meet with Mussolini, who promised him that Italy would soon enter the war. For his one-day Italian trip, Ribbentrop was accompanied by a staff of 35, including a gymnastics coach, a masseur, a doctor, two hairdressers and various legal and economic experts from the Foreign Office. After the Italo-German summit at the Brenner Pass on 18 March 1940, which was attended by Hitler and Mussolini, Count Ciano wrote in his diary: &quot;Everyone in Rome dislikes Ribbentrop&quot;. On 7 May 1940, Ribbentrop founded a new section of the Foreign Office, the &quot;Abteilung Deutschland&quot; (Department of Internal German Affairs), under Martin Luther, to which was assigned the responsibility for all antisemitic affairs. On 10 May 1940, Ribbentrop summoned the Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourg ambassadors to present them with notes justifying the German invasion of their countries several hours after the Germans had invaded those nations. Much to Ribbentrop&#x27;s fury, someone leaked the plans for the German invasion to the Dutch embassy in Berlin, which led Ribbentrop to devote the next several months to an investigation aimed at identifying the leaker. The investigation tore apart the agency, as colleagues were encouraged to denounce each other, and was ultimately unsuccessful.

In early June 1940, when Mussolini informed Hitler that he would finally enter the war on 10 June 1940, Hitler was most dismissive, in private calling Mussolini a cowardly opportunist who broke the terms of the Pact of Steel in September 1939 when the going looked rough, and was entering the war in June 1940 only after it was clear that France was beaten and it appeared that Britain would soon make peace. Ribbentrop shared Hitler&#x27;s assessment of the Italians but welcomed Italy coming into war. In part, that seemed to affirm the importance of the Pact of Steel, which Ribbentrop had negotiated, and in addition, with Italy now an ally, the Foreign Office had more to do. Ribbentrop championed the so-called Madagascar Plan in June 1940 to deport all of Europe&#x27;s Jews to Madagascar after the presumed imminent defeat of Britain.

===Relations with wartime allies===
Ribbentrop, a Francophile, argued that Germany should allow Vichy France a limited degree of independence within a binding Franco-German partnership. To that end, Ribbentrop appointed a colleague from the &quot;Dienststelle&quot;, Otto Abetz, as Ambassador to France with instructions to promote the political career of Pierre Laval, whom Ribbentrop had decided to be the French politician most favourable to Germany. The Foreign Office&#x27;s influence in France varied, as there were many other agencies competing for power there. But in general, from late 1943 to mid-1944, the Foreign Office was second only to the SS in terms of power in France.

From the latter half of 1937, Ribbentrop had championed the idea of an alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan that would partition the British Empire among them. After signing the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact, Ribbentrop expanded on this idea for an Axis alliance to include the Soviet Union to form a Eurasian bloc that would destroy maritime states such as Britain. The German historian Klaus Hildebrand argued that besides Hitler&#x27;s foreign policy programme, there were three other factions within the Nazi Party who had alternative foreign policy programmes, whom Hildebrand designated the agrarians, the revolutionary socialists, and the Wilhelmine Imperialists. Another German diplomatic historian, Wolfgang Michalka argued that there was a fourth alternative to the Nazi foreign policy programme, and that was Ribbentrop&#x27;s concept of a Eurasian bloc comprising the four totalitarian states of Germany, the Soviet Union, Italy and Japan. Unlike the other factions, Ribbentrop&#x27;s foreign policy programme was the only one that Hitler allowed to be executed during the years 1939–41, though it was more due to the temporary bankruptcy of Hitler&#x27;s own foreign policy programme that he had laid down in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; and &quot;Zweites Buch&quot; following the failure to achieve an alliance with Britain, than to a genuine change of mind. Ribbentrop&#x27;s foreign policy conceptions differed from Hitler&#x27;s in that Ribbentrop&#x27;s concept of international relations owed more to the traditional Wilhelmine &quot;Machtpolitik&quot; than to Hitler&#x27;s racist and Social Darwinist vision of different &quot;races&quot; locked in a merciless and endless struggle over &quot;Lebensraum&quot;. The different foreign-policy conceptions held by Hitler and Ribbentrop were illustrated in their reaction to the Fall of Singapore in 1942: Ribbentrop wanted this great British defeat to be a day of celebration in Germany, whereas Hitler forbade any celebrations on the grounds that Singapore represented a sad day for the principles of white supremacy. Another area of difference was Ribbentrop&#x27;s obsessive hatred for Britain—which he saw as the main enemy—and view of the Soviet Union as an important ally in the anti-British struggle. Hitler saw the alliance with the Soviet Union as only tactical, and was nowhere as anti-British as his Foreign Minister.

In August 1940, Ribbentrop oversaw the Second Vienna Award, which saw about 40 per cent of the Transylvania region of Romania returned to Hungary. The decision to award so much of Romania to the Hungarians was Hitler&#x27;s, as Ribbentrop himself spent most of the Vienna conference loudly attacking the Hungarian delegation for their coolness towards attacking Czechoslovakia in 1938 and then demanding more than their fair share of the spoils. When Ribbentrop finally got around to announcing his decision, the Hungarian delegation, which had expected Ribbentrop to rule in favour of Romania, broke out in cheers, while the Romanian foreign minister Mihail Manoilescu fainted.

In late 1940, Ribbentrop made a sustained but unsuccessful effort to have Francoist Spain enter the war on the Axis side. During his talks with the Spanish foreign minister, Ramón Serrano Suñer, Ribbentrop affronted Suñer with his tactless behaviour, especially his suggestion that Spain cede the Canary Islands to Germany. An angry Suñer replied that he would rather see the Canaries sink into the Atlantic than cede an inch of Spanish territory. An area in which Ribbentrop enjoyed more success arose in September 1940, when he had the Far Eastern agent of the &quot;Dienststelle Ribbentrop&quot;, Heinrich Georg Stahmer, start negotiations with the Japanese foreign minister, Yōsuke Matsuoka, for an anti-American alliance. The result of these talks was the signing in Berlin on 27 September 1940 of the Tripartite Pact by Ribbentrop, Count Ciano, and Japanese Ambassador Saburō Kurusu.

In October 1940, &quot;Gauleiters&quot; Josef Bürckel and Robert Wagner oversaw the near total expulsion of the Jews into the unoccupied zone libre of Vichy France; they deported them not only from the parts of Alsace-Lorraine that had been annexed to the &quot;Reich&quot;, but also from their &quot;Gaue&quot; as well. Ribbentrop treated in a &quot;most dilatory fashion&quot; the ensuing complaints by the Vichy French government over the expulsions.

In November 1940, during the visit of the Soviet Foreign Commissar Vyacheslav Molotov to Berlin, Ribbentrop tried hard to get the Soviet Union to sign the Tripartite Pact. Ribbentrop argued that the Soviets and Germans shared a common enemy in the form of the British Empire, and as such, it was in the best interests of the Kremlin to enter the war on the Axis side. He proposed that, after the defeat of Britain, they could carve up the territory in the following way: the Soviet Union would have India and the Middle East, Italy the Mediterranean area, Japan the British possessions in the Far East (presuming of course that Japan would enter the war), and Germany would take central Africa and Britain. Molotov was open to the idea of the Soviet Union entering the war on the Axis side, but demanded as the price of entry into the war that Germany recognise Finland, Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Hungary and Yugoslavia as within the exclusive Soviet sphere of influence. Ribbentrop&#x27;s efforts to persuade Molotov to abandon his demands about Europe as the price of a Soviet alliance with Germany were entirely unsuccessful. After Molotov left Berlin, the Soviet Union indicated that it wished to sign the Tripartite Pact and enter the war on the Axis side. Though Ribbentrop was all for taking Stalin&#x27;s offer, Hitler by this point had decided that he wanted to attack the Soviet Union. The German–Soviet Axis talks led nowhere.

As World War II continued, Ribbentrop&#x27;s once-friendly relations with the SS became increasingly strained. In January 1941, the nadir of the relations between the SS and the Foreign Office was reached when the Iron Guard attempted a coup in Romania. Ribbentrop supported Marshal Ion Antonescu&#x27;s government and Heinrich Himmler supported the Iron Guard. In the aftermath of the failed coup in Bucharest, the Foreign Office assembled evidence that the SD had backed the coup, which led Ribbentrop to restrict sharply the powers of the SD police attachés. Since October 1939 they had operated largely independently of the German embassies at which they had been stationed. In early 1941, Ribbentrop appointed an assemblage of SA men to German embassies in eastern Europe, with Manfred Freiherr von Killinger dispatched to Romania, Siegfried Kasche to Croatia, Adolf-Heinz Beckerle to Bulgaria, Dietrich von Jagow to Hungary, and Hans Ludin to Slovakia. The major qualifications of all these men, none of whom had previously held a diplomatic position before, were that they were close friends of Luther and helped to enable a split in the SS (the traditional rivalry between the SS and SA was still running strong).

In March 1941, Japan&#x27;s Foreign Minister Yōsuke Matsuoka, a Germanophile, visited Berlin. On 29 March 1941, during a conversation with Matsuoka, Ribbentrop, as instructed by Hitler, told the Japanese nothing about the upcoming Operation Barbarossa, as Hitler believed that he could defeat the Soviet Union on his own and preferred that the Japanese attack Britain instead. Hitler did not wish for any information that might lead the Japanese into attacking the Soviet Union to reach their ears. Ribbentrop tried to convince Matsuoka to urge the government in Tokyo to attack the great British naval base at Singapore, claiming the Royal Navy was too weak to retaliate due to its involvement in the Battle of the Atlantic. Matsuoka responded that preparations to occupy Singapore were under way.

In late 1940 and early 1941, Ribbentrop strongly pressured the Kingdom of Yugoslavia to sign the Tripartite Pact, despite advice from the German Legation in Belgrade that such an action would probably lead to the overthrow of Crown Prince Paul, the Yugoslav Regent. Ribbentrop&#x27;s intention was to gain transit rights through the country that would allow the Germans to invade Greece. On 25 March 1941, Yugoslavia reluctantly signed the Tripartite Pact; the next day the Yugoslav military overthrew Prince Paul in a bloodless coup. When Hitler ordered the invasion of Yugoslavia, Ribbentrop was opposed, because he thought the Foreign Office was likely to be excluded from ruling occupied Yugoslavia. As Hitler was displeased with Ribbentrop over his opposition to the invasion, the minister took to his bed for the next couple of days. When Ribbentrop recovered, he sought a chance to increase his agency&#x27;s influence by giving Croatia independence. Ribbentrop chose the Ustaše to rule Croatia. He had Edmund Veesenmayer successfully conclude talks in April 1941 with General Slavko Kvaternik of the Ustaše on having his party rule Croatia after the German invasion. Reflecting his displeasure with the German Legation in Belgrade, which had advised against pushing Yugoslavia to sign the Tripartite Pact, Ribbentrop refused to have the German Legation withdrawn in advance before Germany bombed Belgrade on 6 April 1941. The staff was left to survive the fire-bombing as best it could.

Ribbentrop liked and admired Joseph Stalin and was opposed to the attack on the Soviet Union in 1941. He passed a word to a Soviet diplomat: &quot;Please tell Stalin I was against this war, and that I know it will bring great misfortune to Germany.&quot; When it came to time for Ribbentrop to present the German declaration of war on 22 June 1941 to the Soviet Ambassador, General Vladimir Dekanozov, the interpreter Paul Schmidt described the scene:

When Dekanozov finally appeared, Ribbentrop read out a short statement saying that the Reich had been forced into &quot;military countermeasures&quot; because of an alleged Soviet plan to attack Germany in July 1941. Ribbentrop did not present a declaration of war to General Dekanozov, confining himself to reading the statement about Germany being forced to take &quot;military countermeasures&quot;.

Despite his opposition to Operation Barbarossa and a preference to concentrate against Britain, Ribbentrop began a sustained effort on 28 June 1941, without consulting Hitler, to have Japan attack the Soviet Union. But Ribbentrop&#x27;s motives in seeking to have Japan enter the war were more anti-British than anti-Soviet. On 10 July 1941 Ribbentrop ordered General Eugen Ott, the German Ambassador to Japan to:

As part of his efforts to bring Japan into Barbarossa, on 1 July 1941, Ribbentrop had Germany break off diplomatic relations with Chiang Kai-shek and recognized the Japanese-puppet government of Wang Jingwei as China&#x27;s legitimate rulers. Ribbentrop hoped that recognizing Wang would be seen as a coup that might add to the prestige of the pro-German Japanese Foreign Minister Yōsuke Matsuoka, who was opposed to opening American-Japanese talks. Despite Ribbentrop&#x27;s best efforts, Matsuoka was sacked as foreign minister later in July 1941, and the Japanese-American talks began.

After the war, Ribbentrop was found to have had culpability in the Holocaust based on his efforts to persuade the leaders of Nazi puppet states and other Axis powers to deport Jews to the Nazi extermination camps. In August 1941, when the question of whether to deport foreign Jews living in Germany arose, Ribbentrop argued against deportation as a way of maximizing the Foreign Office&#x27;s influence. To deport foreign Jews living in the Reich, Ribbentrop had Luther negotiate agreements with the governments of Romania, Slovakia and Croatia to allow Jews holding citizenship of those states to be deported. In September 1941, the Reich Plenipotentiary for Nazi-occupied Serbia, Felix Benzler, reported to Ribbentrop that the SS had arrested 8,000 Serbian Jews, whom they were planning to execute en masse. He asked for permission to try to stop the massacre. Ribbentrop assigned the question to Luther, who ordered Benzler to co-operate fully in the massacre.

In late 1941, Ribbentrop worked for the failure of the Japanese-American talks in Washington and for Japan to attack the United States. In October 1941 Ribbentrop ordered Eugen Ott, the German ambassador to Japan, to start applying pressure on the Japanese to attack the Americans as soon as possible. Ribbentrop argued to Hitler that a war between the United States and Germany was inevitable given the extent of American aid to Britain and the increasingly frequent &quot;incidents&quot; in the North Atlantic between U-boats and American warships guarding convoys to Britain. He said that having such a war start with a Japanese attack on the United States was the best way to begin it. Ribbentrop told Hitler that because of his four years in Canada and the United States before 1914, he was an expert on all things American; he thought that the United States was not a serious military power. On 4 December 1941, the Japanese Ambassador General Hiroshi Ōshima told Ribbentrop that Japan was on the verge of war with the United States. In turn, Ribbentrop promised that Germany would join the war against the Americans. On 7 December 1941, Ribbentrop was jubilant at the news of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and did his utmost to support a declaration of war on the United States. He delivered the official declaration to the American &quot;Chargé d&#x27;Affaires&quot; Leland B. Morris on 11 December 1941. In early 1942, following American entry into war, the United States successfully pressured all of the Latin American states, except for Argentina and Chile, to declare war on Germany. Ribbentrop considered the acceptance of declarations of war from small states such as Costa Rica and Ecuador to be deeply humiliating, and he refused to see any of the Latin American ambassadors. He had Weizsäcker accept their declarations of war instead.

In April 1942, as part of a diplomatic counterpart to Case Blue, a military operation in southern Russia, Ribbentrop assembled a collection of anti-Soviet émigrés from the Caucasus in the Hotel Adlon in Berlin with the intention to have them declared leaders of governments-in-exile. From Ribbentrop&#x27;s point of view, this had the dual benefit of ensuring popular support for the German Army as it advanced into the Caucasus and of ensuring that it was the Foreign Office that ruled the Caucasus once the Germans occupied the area. Alfred Rosenberg, the German Minister of the East, saw this as an intrusion into his area of authority, and told Hitler that the émigrés at the Hotel Adlon were &quot;a nest of Allied agents&quot;. To Ribbentrop&#x27;s disappointment, Hitler sided with Rosenberg.

Despite the often fierce rivalry with the SS, the Foreign Office played a key role in arranging the deportations of Jews to the death camps from France (1942–44), Hungary (1944–45), Slovakia, Italy (after 1943), and the Balkans. Ribbentrop assigned all of the Holocaust-related work to Martin Luther, an old crony from the &quot;Dienststelle&quot; who represented the Foreign Ministry at the Wannsee Conference. In 1942, Ambassador Otto Abetz secured the deportation of 25,000 French Jews, and Ambassador Hans Ludin secured the deportation of 50,000 Slovak Jews to the death camps. Only once, in August 1942, did Ribbentrop try to restrict the deportations, but only because of jurisdictional disputes with the SS. Ribbentrop halted deportations from Romania and Croatia; in the case of the former, he was insulted because the SS were negotiating with the Romanians directly, and in the case of the latter, he learned that the SS and Luther had pressured the Italians in their zone of occupation to deport their Jews without first informing Ribbentrop. He had required being kept updated on all developments in Italo-German relations. In September 1942, after a meeting with Hitler, who was unhappy with his foreign minister&#x27;s actions, Ribbentrop changed course and ordered the deportations to be resumed immediately.

In November 1942, following Operation Torch (the British-American invasion of North Africa), Ribbentrop met French Chief of the Government Pierre Laval in Munich. He presented Laval with an ultimatum for Germany&#x27;s occupation of the French unoccupied zone and Tunisia. Ribbentrop tried unsuccessfully to arrange for the Vichy French Armistice Army in North Africa to be formally placed under German command. In December 1942, he met the Italian Foreign Minister Count Galeazzo Ciano, who carried Mussolini&#x27;s request urging the Germans to go on the defensive in the Soviet Union in order to focus on attacking North Africa. Ribbentrop joined Hitler in belittling Italy&#x27;s war effort. During the same meeting in East Prussia with Count Ciano, Pierre Laval arrived. He quickly agreed to Hitler&#x27;s and Ribbentrop&#x27;s demands that he place French police under the command of more radical antisemites and transport hundreds of thousands of French workers to labour in Germany&#x27;s war industry.

Another low point in Ribbentrop&#x27;s relations with the SS occurred in February 1943, when the SD backed a Luther-led internal &quot;putsch&quot; to oust Ribbentrop as foreign minister. Luther had become estranged from Ribbentrop because the latter&#x27;s wife treated the former as a household servant. She pushed her husband into ordering an investigation into allegations of corruption on Luther&#x27;s part. Luther&#x27;s &quot;putsch&quot; failed largely because Himmler decided that a foreign ministry headed by Luther would be a more dangerous opponent than the current one under Ribbentrop. At the last minute, he withdrew his support from Luther. In the aftermath of the &quot;putsch&quot;, Luther was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp.

In April 1943, during a summit meeting with Hungary&#x27;s Regent Miklós Horthy, Ribbentrop strongly pressed the Hungarians to deport their Jewish population to the death camps, but was unsuccessful. During their meeting, Ribbentrop declared &quot;the Jews must either be exterminated or taken to the concentration camps. There is no other possibility&quot;.

===Declining influence===
As the war went on, Ribbentrop&#x27;s influence waned. Because most of the world was at war with Germany, the Foreign Ministry&#x27;s importance diminished as the value of diplomacy became limited. By January 1944, Germany had diplomatic relations only with Argentina, Ireland, Vichy France, the Italian Social Republic in Italy, Occupied Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Croatia, Bulgaria, Switzerland, the Holy See, Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Thailand, Japan, and the Japanese puppet states of Manchukuo and the Wang Jingwei regime in China. Later that year, Argentina and Turkey severed ties with Germany; Romania and Bulgaria joined the Allies and Finland made a separate peace with the Soviet Union and declared war on Germany.

Hitler found Ribbentrop increasingly tiresome and started to avoid him. The Foreign Minister&#x27;s pleas for permission to seek peace with at least some of Germany&#x27;s enemies—the Soviet Union in particular—played a role in their estrangement. As his influence declined, Ribbentrop spent his time feuding with other Nazi leaders over control of antisemitic policies to curry Hitler&#x27;s favour.

Ribbentrop suffered a major blow when many old Foreign Office diplomats participated in the 20 July 1944 &quot;putsch&quot; and assassination attempt on Hitler. Ribbentrop had not known of the plot, but the participation of so many current and former Foreign Ministry members reflected badly on him. Hitler felt that Ribbentrop&#x27;s &quot;bloated administration&quot; prevented him from keeping proper tabs on his diplomats&#x27; activities. Ribbentrop worked closely with the SS, with which he had reconciled, to purge the Foreign Office of those involved in the &quot;putsch&quot;. In the hours immediately following the assassination attempt on Hitler, Ribbentrop, Göring, Dönitz, and Mussolini were having tea with Hitler in Rastenberg when Dönitz began to rail against the failures of the Luftwaffe. Göring immediately turned the direction of the conversation to Ribbentrop, and the bankruptcy of Germany&#x27;s foreign policy. &quot;You dirty little champagne salesman! Shut your mouth!&quot; Göring shouted, threatening to smack Ribbentrop with his marshal&#x27;s baton. But Ribbentrop refused to remain silent at this disrespect. &quot;I am still the Foreign Minister,&quot; he shouted, &quot;and my name is &quot;von&quot; Ribbentrop!&quot;

On 20 April 1945, Ribbentrop attended Hitler&#x27;s 56th, and last, birthday party in Berlin. Three days later, Ribbentrop attempted to meet Hitler, but was rejected with the explanation the Führer had more important things to do.

===Arrest===
After Hitler&#x27;s suicide, Ribbentrop attempted to find a role under the new president, Karl Dönitz, but was rebuffed. He went into hiding under an assumed name (Herr Reiser) in the port city of Hamburg. On 14 June, after Germany&#x27;s surrender, Ribbentrop was arrested by Sergeant Jacques Goffinet, a French citizen who had joined the 5th Special Air Service, the Belgian SAS, and was working with the British Army near Hamburg. He was found with a rambling letter written in English addressed to the British Prime Minister Vincent [sic] Churchill and Foreign Minister Anthony Eden criticizing British foreign policy for anti-German sentiments, and blaming Britain&#x27;s failure to ally with Germany before the war for the Soviet occupation of eastern Germany and the advancement of Bolshevism into central Europe. In it Ribbentrop said it was Hitler&#x27;s &quot;last political will&quot; and a friendship appeal and claimed to have met with Hitler shortly before his death who &quot;having suddenly turned around to me and said: &#x27;You will see, my spirit will arise from my grave and one will see that I have been right.


==Trial and execution==

Ribbentrop was a defendant at the Nuremberg trials. The Allies&#x27; International Military Tribunal convicted him on four counts: crimes against peace, deliberately planning a war of aggression, committing war crimes, and crimes against humanity. According to the judgment, Ribbentrop was actively involved in planning the Anschluss, as well as the invasions of Czechoslovakia and Poland. He was also deeply involved in the &quot;final solution&quot;; as early as 1942 he had ordered German diplomats in Axis countries to hasten the process of sending Jews to death camps in the east. He supported the lynching of Allied airmen shot down over Germany, and helped to cover up the 1945 murder of Major-General Gustave Mesny, a French officer being held as a prisoner-of-war. He was held directly responsible for atrocities which took place in Denmark and Vichy France, since the top officials in those two occupied countries reported to him. Ribbentrop claimed that Hitler made all the important decisions himself, and that he had been deceived by Hitler&#x27;s repeated claims of only wanting peace. The Tribunal rejected this argument, saying that given how closely involved Ribbentrop was with the execution of the war, &quot;he could not have remained unaware of the aggressive nature of Hitler&#x27;s actions.&quot; Even in prison, Ribbentrop still remained loyal to Hitler: &quot;Even with all I know, if in this cell Hitler should come to me and say &#x27;do this!&#x27;, I would still do it.&quot;


Gustave Gilbert, an American Army psychologist, was allowed to examine the Nazi leaders who stood trial. Among other tests, he administered a German version of the Wechsler–Bellevue IQ test. Ribbentrop scored 129, the 10th highest among the Nazi leaders tested. At one point during the trial, a US Army interpreter asked Ernst &quot;Freiherr&quot; von Weizsäcker how Hitler could have promoted Ribbentrop to high office. Von Weizsäcker responded, &quot;Hitler never noticed Ribbentrop&#x27;s babbling because Hitler always did all the talking.&quot;

On 16 October 1946, Ribbentrop became the first of those sentenced to death at Nuremberg to be hanged, after Göring committed suicide just before his scheduled execution. The hangman was U.S. Master Sergeant John C. Woods. Ribbentrop was escorted up the 13 steps of the gallows and asked if he had any final words. He said: &quot;God protect Germany. God have mercy on my soul. My final wish is that Germany should recover her unity and that, for the sake of peace, there should be understanding between East and West. I wish peace to the world.&quot; Nuremberg Prison Commandant Burton C. Andrus later recalled that Ribbentrop turned to the prison&#x27;s Lutheran chaplain, Henry F. Gerecke, immediately before the hood was placed over his head and then he whispered, &quot;I&#x27;ll see you again.&quot; His execution was botched and it took 14 minutes for Ribbentrop to die. His body, like those of the other nine executed men and of the suicide Hermann Göring, was cremated at Ostfriedhof (Munich) and his ashes were scattered in the river Isar.

==In popular culture==
In &quot;Famous Last Words&quot;, a novel by Timothy Findley, Ribbentrop conspires with the Duke of Windsor to kill Hitler, take over the Nazi Party and Europe. The Robert Harris novel &quot;Fatherland&quot; (1992) explores an alternate history where the Nazis won the war, and Ribbentrop is still the foreign minister in 1964. In Philip Roth&#x27;s alternative history &quot;The Plot Against America,&quot; Charles Lindbergh wins the presidential election of 1940 and allies the United States with Nazi Germany; Ribbentrop visits the White House as part of the two countries&#x27; new friendship. In Guy Walters&#x27; &quot;The Leader&quot; (2003), Oswald Mosley becomes Prime Minister in 1937, allying the United Kingdom with the Axis Powers, Ribbentrop is seen talking to Diana Mitford in London after the creation of the new alliance. In Harry Turtledove&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1996) imagining an alien invasion of Earth during World War II, Ribbentrop represents Nazi Germany in negotiation of an armistice between the Allied and Axis powers.

== Honours ==

During his life, Ribbentrop received many orders, decorations and medals. His role as chief diplomat of the Reich meant he was a natural recipient for diplomatic honours given out by various nations. It is theorised that many of the honours bestowed on Ribbentrop were actually intended for Hitler, who only ever wore at most his WWI Iron Cross 1st Class, his wound badge and his NSDAP Party badge. Hitler refused to accept any foreign decorations and so it is thought that many of the decorations conferred on Ribbentrop were intended for Hitler.

Ribbentrop&#x27;s full collection of honours were recovered and sold off after the war. He had taken great care to make sure his decorations and other valuable items were kept safe and easily accessible for a potential escape after the defeat of Nazi Germany. Shortly before the end of the war, he hid his decorations and other valuables on the second floor of the Hotel Krone in Umhausen, Tyrol, Austria. He intended to recover them and other valuables before his eventual escape into Switzerland. On 5 May 1945, the 44th Infantry Division entered Umhausen. Shortly after, a captain in the Division, Howard Goldsmith, entered the Hotel Krone intending to stay the night, something he and his men were greatly looking forward to after months of sleeping rough in the winter of the Alpine region. The proprietor of the hotel refused them entry, but they forced their way in, and on reaching the second floor they uncovered trunks filled with clothing and personal items, confidential government documents and looted art from across occupied Europe. Also in the room was a chest which Captain Goldsmith discovered was filled with Ribbentrop&#x27;s personal orders and decorations.

According to army rules, official and sensitive documents were to be passed on to the relevant authorities, while looted art was to be handed over to the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program for restitution. However, personal items were considered legitimate war souvenirs and after asking for permission, Goldsmith was allowed to keep the items. He had Ribbentrop&#x27;s decorations shipped back to his home in College Station, Texas. Upon arriving back home he had the items appraised and found that the value at that time was around $40,000 (1945 US Dollars). For years afterwards they were exhibited across the United States, and a few years later the collection was broken up and sold.
