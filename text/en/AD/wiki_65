<text>Transport in Luxembourg is ensured principally by road, rail and air. There are also services along the river Moselle which forms the border with Germany. The road network has been significantly modernised in recent years with motorways to adjacent countries. The advent of the high-speed TGV link to Paris has led to renovation of the capital&#x27;s main railway station while a new Schengen-only passenger terminal at Luxembourg Airport opened in 2017. Trams in the capital were reintroduced in December 2017 and there are plans for light-rail and/or tram-train lines in adjacent areas.

All public transport in Luxembourg (buses, trams, and trains) has been free to use since 29 February 2020, as part of a larger mobility experiment with goals to increase walking for short trips, increase bicycling, and increase the transit ridership sharply as the network is enlarged and service frequency is increased.

== Railways ==

Operated by Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois (CFL), Luxembourg&#x27;s railways form the backbone of the country&#x27;s public transport network, linking the most important towns. The total length of operational (standard gauge) track is , though it was some at the end of the Second World War. There are regular services from Luxembourg City to Ettelbruck, Esch-sur-Alzette, Wasserbillig and Kleinbettingen while international routes extend to Trier, Koblenz, Brussels, Liège, Metz and Nancy.

The railway network links into Belgium, Germany and France. Some of the cross-border services are run by CFL, others by SNCF, NMBS/SNCB and DB.

There is now a frequent high-speed connection to Paris via the LGV Est line. EuroCap-Rail is a proposed high-speed axis connecting Brussels, Luxembourg (city), and Strasbourg.

== Roads ==
===Road network===

The six Luxembourg motorways cover a total distance of , linking the capital with Trier (Germany), Thionville (France) and Arlon (Belgium) as well as with Esch-sur-Alzette and Ettelbruck in Luxembourg. Luxembourg&#x27;s motorways are toll free. The speed limit is normally , in rainy weather. With of motorway per , Luxembourg probably now has the highest density of motorways in Europe.

Luxembourg City is a major business and financial center. Many workers prefer to live in the three neighboring countries and drive to work each day. This creates huge traffic jams during peak commuting hours. Tailbacks on the E411 motorway can extend five or more kilometers into Belgium and can take an hour or more to navigate.

The remaining road network in Luxembourg accounts for a total length of , consisting of of trunk roads (RN or &quot;routes nationales&quot;) and of secondary roads (CR or &quot;chemins repris&quot;).
===Bus services===

Comprehensive bus services linking the towns and villages of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are contracted out to private operators by the RGTR (Régime général des transports routiers) under the Ministry of Transport.

Luxembourg City is served by 250 of its own AVL (Autobus de la Ville de Luxembourg) buses transporting some 40 million passengers per year (2018). 170 of these are, as with the RGTR, contracted out to private operators. Most of these buses are in AVL colors but the owner&#x27;s name is often mentioned on them in small print. Also, the letters on the license plate can give ownership away to those that know how that system works. There are 31 regular bus routes plus special bus services through the night.

The TICE or Syndicat des Tramways Intercommunaux dans le Canton d’Esch/Alzette operates several bus routes. They are centered on the city of Esch-sur-Alzette in the southeast of the country. Most are urban and suburban routes but some extend into the surrounding countryside.

CFL, the Luxembourg railway company, operates some 17 bus routes, mainly serving towns and villages that are no longer served by rail.

A number of smaller cities like Ettelbruck and Wiltz have started their own local services, some of which reach out to nearby villages. These services are not part of the RGTR and national tickets are not always honored.

All transport companies work together under the &quot;Verkéiersverbond&quot;, which covers all bus, tram, and train routes. Starting from 29 Feb 2020, all public transport was made free throughout the territory of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, funded through general taxation. However first class tickets can still be purchased for use on the trains: a ticket valid for 2 hours is €3, whilst a one-day ticket is €6.

=== Cycling ===

In the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the EV5 Via Romea Francigena runs and follows a network of dedicated cycle paths from the Belgian border, through to its cliff-top capital city, and towards the French and German borders at Schengen. The EV5 follows the following national routes in Luxembourg: PC18, PC17, PC12, PC13, the Luxembourg-City route no. 10, PC1, PC11, PC7 and PC3.

In Luxembourg, the EV5 goes through Strassen, Luxembourg, Hesperange and Schengen. It then passes through back to France.

==Trams==

Luxembourg&#x27;s historic tramway network closed in 1964 as part of a general decline of trams across Europe but the city reintroduced trams at the end of 2017 as part of the renaissance of tramways. The phased approach initially saw trams running through the Kirchberg quarter to the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge, and later to the stop &quot;Stäreplaz&quot; in Limpertsberg, before the line was eventually extended to the old town in Ville Haute and on towards Luxembourg railway station. In June 2024, the newly constructed extensions to the Cloche d&#x27;Or business district in the south of the city in Gasperich was opened, and a connection to Luxembourg Airport and Senningerberg is estimated to open in 2025. A funicular line was also opened allowing connections between trams running along the Kirchberg approach to the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge and a station serving a CFL rail line located in the Pfaffenthal valley below. In the &quot;PNM 2035&quot; (National Mobility Plan for 2035), plans were revealed for the tram going to the south of Luxembourg connecting, Esch and Belvaux to the quarter of Merl.
== Water ==
The river Moselle forms a natural border between Luxembourg and Germany in the southeast of the country. In the summer months, the Princess Marie-Astrid and a few other tourist boats operate regular services along the river.

Mertert near Grevenmacher on the Moselle is Luxembourg&#x27;s only commercial port. With two quays covering a total length of , it offers facilities connecting river, road and rail transport. It is used principally for coal, steel, oil, agricultural goods and building materials. In 2016, the port handled 1.2 million tonnes of cargo.

== Air ==
Luxembourg Airport at Findel, some to the north of the city, is Luxembourg&#x27;s only commercial airport. Thanks to its long runway (4,000 m), even large types of aircraft are able to use its facilities.

Luxair, Luxembourg&#x27;s international airline, and Cargolux, a cargo-only airline, operates out of the airport. In 2008, the airport ranked as Europe&#x27;s 5th largest and the world&#x27;s 23rd by cargo tonnage.

Luxair has regular passenger services to 20 European destinations and operates tourist flights to 17 more. Other airlines operating flights to and from Luxembourg include British Airways, KLM, Scandinavian Airlines, Swiss Global Air Lines, and TAP Portugal.

A large new airport terminal building was opened in 2008 with more modern facilities, including an underground carpark. In order to accommodate anticipated growth in travel within the Schengen Area, in 2016 an abandoned terminal was renovated to handle low-capacity and regional flights.

== Pipelines ==
The trunk natural gas pipelines in Luxembourg have a total length of (2007).

Russia and Norway are the main producers. The Luxembourg network is connected to Germany, France and Belgium.

== Merchant navy ==
Luxembourg has 150 vessels in its merchant navy. These include 4 bulk carriers, 1 container ship, 21 general cargo ships, 3 oil tankers, and 121 others.

On 8 January 1817, William I, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, published a constitutional law governing the organization of a militia, the main provisions of which were to remain in force until the militia was abolished in 1881. The law fixed the militia&#x27;s strength at 3,000 men. Until 1840, Luxembourg&#x27;s militiamen served in units of the Royal Netherlands Army. Enlisted men served for five years: the first year consisted of active service, but during each of the subsequent four years of service they were mobilised only three times per year.

=== Federal Contingent (1841–1867) ===
In 1839, William I became a party to the Treaty of London by which the Grand-Duchy lost its western, francophone territories to the Belgian province of Luxembourg. Due to the country&#x27;s population having been halved, with the loss of 160,000 inhabitants, the militia lost half its strength. Under the terms of the treaty, Luxembourg and the newly formed Duchy of Limburg, both members of the German Confederation, were together required to provide a federal contingent consisting of a light infantry battalion garrisoned in Echternach, a cavalry squadron in Diekirch, and an artillery detachment in Ettelbruck. In 1846, the cavalry and artillery units were disbanded and the Luxembourg contingent was separated from that of Limburg. The Luxembourg contingent now consisted of two light infantry battalions, one in Echternach and the second in Diekirch; two reserve companies; and a depot company.

In 1866, the Austro-Prussian war resulted in the dissolution of the German Confederation. Luxembourg was declared neutral in perpetuity by the 1867 Treaty of London, and in accordance, its fortress was demolished in the following years. In 1867, the Prussian garrison left the fortress, and the two battalions of Luxembourg light infantry entered the city of Luxembourg that September.

A new military organization was established in 1867, consisting of two battalions, known as the , having a total strength of 1,568 officers and men. In 1868, the contingent came to consist of one light infantry battalion of four companies, with a strength of 500 men. On 16 February 1881, the light infantry battalion was disbanded with the abolition of the militia-based system.

=== Gendarmes and Volunteers Corps ===

On 16 February 1881, the (Corps of Gendarmes and Volunteers) was established. It was composed of two companies, a company of gendarmes and one of volunteers. In 1939, a corps of auxiliary volunteers was established and attached to the company of volunteers. Following the occupation of Luxembourg by Germany in May 1940, recruitment for the company of volunteers continued until 4 December 1940, when they were moved to Weimar, Germany, to be trained as German police.

In November 1918 Luxembourg faced two small communist rebellions in Luxembourg City and Esch-sur-Alzette. Both were quickly suppressed by police. In December 1918 a group of soldiers attempted a mutiny in the Luxembourg City barracks.

On 9 January 1919, a group of socialist and liberal deputies, tabled a motion to make Luxembourg a republic. A crowd gathered at the barracks of the Corps of Volunteers, close to the Chamber. Then Émile Servais, a left-wing politician, walked out the Chamber, addressed the crowd and demanded a republic. The crowd then rushed the Chamber and the deputies called in the Corps of Volunteers but the soldiers refused the orders to disperse the crowd. Part of the deputies then fled the Chamber. The remaining deputies, mainly left-wing, formed the Committee of Public Safety with Servais as its leader. The committee had no public support and the French Army under the command of General de La Tour soon quelled the turmoil. 

=== Luxembourg Battery ===


In 1944 during World War II, the Luxembourg Government, while exiled in London, made agreements for a group of seventy Luxembourg volunteers to be assigned to the Artillery Group of the 1st Belgian Infantry Brigade, commonly known as Brigade Piron, Jean-Baptiste Piron being the chief of this unit. This contingent was named the Luxembourg Battery. Initially, it was built up and trained by two Belgian officers. Later, from August 1944, these were joined by Luxembourg officers, who had received training in Britain.

Several Luxembourg NCOs and half of the country&#x27;s troops had fought in North Africa in the French Foreign Legion. The rest were people who had escaped from Luxembourg, and young men evading forcible conscription into the Wehrmacht by fleeing to Britain. The Luxembourg unit landed in Normandy on 6 August 1944—at approximately the same time as the Dutch Princess Irene Brigade and the French 2nd DB (&quot;division blindée&quot;) commanded by General Leclerc—two months after the D-Day landings.

The Luxembourg Battery was equipped with four Ordnance QF 25 pounder howitzers, which were named after the four daughters of Grand Duchess Charlotte: Princesses Elisabeth, Marie Adelaide, Marie Gabriele and Alix.

=== Post-liberation ===
Conscription was introduced in Luxembourg for the first time in November 1944. In 1945, the (Grand Ducal Guard Corps) garrisoned in the Saint-Esprit barracks in Luxembourg City and the 1st and 2nd infantry battalions were established, one in Walferdange and the other in Dudelange. The Luxembourg Armed Forces took charge of part of the French occupation zone in Germany, the 2nd Battalion occupying part of the Bitburg district and a detachment from the 1st Battalion part of the Saarburg district. The 2nd Battalion remained in Bitburg until 1955. The strength of the army rose to 2,150 men. Luxembourg signed the Treaty of Brussels in March 1948, and the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949.

Setting up an army after the war proved more difficult than predicted. To a certain extent, the authorities could rely on escaped German conscripts and Luxembourgers who had joined Allied armies; however, they had to find a way to train officers. Initially, British military advisers came to Luxembourg, where training was carried out by British officers and NCOs. But officer training, in the long term, would have to be done in military schools abroad. Belgium and France were both interested in helping and offered solutions. In the end, the government opted for a compromise solution, by sending some officer cadets to the in France and others to the Royal Military Academy in Belgium. This eventually led to disunity within the Luxembourg officer corps due to differences in training and promotion.

In 1951, the Grand Ducal Guard relocated to Walferdange and integrated with the . The Guard had special units for reconnaissance, radiac reconnaissance, and anti-air warfare. From 1955, it was organised into a headquarters company, a garrison platoon, a reconnaissance company and two training companies. In 1959, the was disbanded and the Grand Ducal Guard was integrated into the (Territorial Command). The force was reduced to a single company, a corporals&#x27; training school, and a weapons platoon. In 1960, the Grand Ducal Guard was again reorganised into four platoons, temporarily grouped into intervention and reinforcement detachments. In 1964, the Grand Ducal Guard was organized into a HQ, three platoons, a reinforcement platoon, and the NCO school. On 28 February 1966, the Grand Ducal Guard was officially disbanded.

=== Korean War ===

In 1950, seventeen countries, including Luxembourg, decided to send armed forces to assist the Republic of Korea. The Luxembourg contingent was incorporated into the Belgian United Nations Command or the Korean Volunteer Corps. The Belgo-Luxembourgish battalion arrived in Korea in 1951, and was attached to the US 3rd Infantry Division. Two Luxembourger soldiers were killed and 17 were wounded in the war. The Belgo-Luxembourg battalion was disbanded in 1955.

=== Groupement Tactique Régimentaire and Home Command ===
In 1954, the (GTR) (Regimental Tactical Group) was established as Luxembourg&#x27;s contribution to NATO. It consisted of three infantry battalions, an artillery battalion, and support, medical, transport, signals, engineering, heavy mortar, reconnaissance, and headquarters companies. By 1954, its overall strength had risen to 5,200 men. The GTR was disbanded in 1959.

In addition to the GTR, the Army also included the Territorial Command, composed of headquarters, military police, movement and transportation companies, a static guard battalion, and a mobile battalion. By 1954, it numbered some 2,500 men. At the same date, some 2.45 percent of the country&#x27;s population was serving in the military.

=== 1st Artillery Battalion ===
In 1961, the 1st Artillery Battalion was placed at NATO&#x27;s disposal. The battalion was organised into three batteries, each with six field howitzers (British 25 pounder guns converted to 105 mm caliber) from the former GTR artillery battalion, an HQ battery, and a service battery. In 1963, the battalion was attached to the US 8th Infantry Division. In 1966, the Grand Ducal Guard was disbanded and its tasks were transferred to and performed by the 1st Artillery Battalion until it too was disbanded, in 1967.

=== 1st Infantry Battalion ===
Compulsory military service was abolished in 1967 by which time some 34,700 men had served at some point in the Luxembourg Army. As part of a major reorganisation of the military, the 1st Infantry Battalion was established, consisting of a headquarters and services unit, two motorized infantry companies, and a reconnaissance company with two reconnaissance (recce) platoons and an anti-tank platoon. From 1968 onwards, it formed a part of NATO&#x27;s ACE Mobile Force (Land) (AMF(L)). In 1985, a reinforced company—consisting of an AMF Company with two recce platoons and an anti-tank platoon, a forward air-control team, a national support element for logistics, and a medical support element—replaced the battalion. In 2002 the AMF(L) was dissolved.

=== Recent international operations ===
Luxembourg started financially supporting international peacekeeping missions in 1991, citing the Persian Gulf War, Rwanda and in Albania. Luxembourg has been deploying military personnel for peacekeeping missions since 1992.

Luxembourg has contributed troops to the UNPROFOR from April 1992 to August 1993, deploying in total 40 military personnel in a Belgian bataillon. In 1996 Luxembourg contributed to IFOR missions in former Yugoslavia in a multinational transport company. This was followed by a small contingent in the NATO SFOR mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, completing 9 personnel rotations. The Luxembourg Armed Forces were integrated into the Multinational Beluga Force under Belgian command.

Luxembourg has contributed over 18 years in NATO KFOR, totalling 1200 military personnel. Luxembourg deployed a reconnaissance platoon first from 2000 to 2006 under Belgian command and from 2007 to 2011 under a French detachment. From 2011 to 2017 Luxembourg was subordinated to the headquarters in Pristina, collaborating with an Austrian reconnaissance company.

Together with Belgium, Luxembourg contributed military personnel to UNIFIL in Lebanon from 2006 to 2014.

Over 35 rotations, Luxembourg troops have been deployed to Afghanistan from 2003 to 2014 to support ISAF in Kabul and Kandahar. The army has also participated in humanitarian relief missions such as setting up refugee camps for Kurds and providing emergency supplies to Albania. Furthermore, Luxembourg participated in the RSM in Mazar-i-Sharif from 2015 to 2021 and prodived evacuation support during the August 2021 Taliban offensive in Kabul.

The Luxembourg Armed Forces have also been active in Africa, supporting the EU Security Reform Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (EUSEC RDC), the EU Military Operation in Eastern Chad and North Eastern Central African Republic (EUFOR Chad/CAR), following with the MINURCAT. From 2013 to 2022 Luxembourg provided support to EUTM in Mali.

Luxembourg is also active in the NATO eFP, contributing logistical and satellite transmission support in Lithuania since 2017.

== Luxembourg Armed Forces Organization ==

The army is under civilian control, with the Grand Duke as Commander-in-Chief. The Minister for Defence oversees army operations. The professional head of the army is the Chief of Defence, currently Steve Thull, who answers to the minister. The Grand Duke and the Chief of Defence are the only generals, with colonels as Deputy Chief of Defence and head of the Military Training Centre.

Until 1999, the army was integrated into the (Public Force), which included the Gendarmerie and the Police, until the Gendarmerie was merged with the Grand Ducal Police under a different minister in 2000. The army has been an all-volunteer force since 1967. It has a strength of around 900 professional soldiers and 200 civilians with a total budget of approximately $389 million, or 0.57% of GDP in 2021.

The Luxembourg Army is a battalion-sized formation with four separate (companies) under the control of the (Military Centre), located in the Caserne Grand-Duc Jean barracks on Herrenberg hill near the town of Diekirch. Luxembourg has no navy, as the country is landlocked. It has an air force since 2021 and aircraft.

=== Compagnie A ===
Compagnie A, the first of two rifle companies that forms the Luxembourg contingent of the Eurocorps, is normally integrated into the Belgian contribution during operations. As such, it participates in Eurocorps&#x27; contribution to the NATO Response Force (entire company) and the EU Battlegroups (one platoon). The company consists of a command element and three reconnaissance platoons of four sections each, plus a command section. Each section is equipped with two armoured M1114 HMMWVs, each armed with a .50 caliber M2 Browning machine gun. The command section has a MAN X40 truck in addition to its pair of HMMWVs.

=== Compagnie B ===
Compagnie B, currently known as the Reconversion Service, is the educational unit of the Army, providing various educational courses for personnel to take in preparation for advancement. On 19 May 2011, Company B was redesignated as the (Reconversion Service) with the mission to prepare volunteer soldiers for the return to civilian life. The service includes the (Army School). In order to attend this school a soldier must have at least eighteen months of service. The school is divided into two sections:
* Level B - is open to all soldiers at the end of their first eighteen months of service. Soldiers follow two six-month periods of tuition in both general and military-based subjects prior to taking examinations. Upon gaining 75% pass marks, they can proceed to the next level.
* Level A - is open to soldiers who have achieved the required passes at Level B, or who have attained the equivalent in civilian life prior to their enlistment. Soldiers do a single six-month period of tuition in the same subjects as Level B, but for a longer period each week.

=== Compagnie C ===
Compagnie C, better known as the (Staff &amp; Instruction Company), is the main military training unit of the Luxembourg Armed Forces, with instruction given in:
* Basic soldiering
* Driving
* Physical training

This company is also responsible for the army&#x27;s Elite Sports Section, reserved for sportsmen in the Army. Following their basic training, these soldiers join the (SSEA).

=== Compagnie D ===
Compagnie D is the second rifle company – it provided Luxembourg&#x27;s contribution to NATO&#x27;s ACE Mobile Force (Land) (disbanded in 2002) as the Luxembourg Reconnaissance Company. Luxembourg&#x27;s participation in various UN, EU, and NATO missions is drawn from Compagnie D, which mirrors Compagnie A in organisation, with a command element and three reconnaissance platoons.

== Equipment ==


== Luxembourg Air Wing ==
Luxembourg has a small air wing. All NATO AWACS planes are registered to the LAF and sport the Luxembourg Armed Forces roundel.
=== Aircraft ===
=== Retired aircraft ===
Previous aircraft operated were 3 Piper PA-18 Super Cub&#x27;s from 1952 to 1968.

== Uniform ==
Luxembourg military uniforms consist of dress, service (or garrison) and field uniforms, often worn with a black beret. Dress uniforms are worn mostly on formal occasions, while service uniforms are worn for daily duty. Luxembourg Armed Forces uniforms consist of service and field attire for summer and winter, as well as a dress uniform and mess jacket for officers. The winter service dress uniform, of olive drab wool, consists of a single-breasted coat having patch pockets with flaps, a khaki shirt and tie, and trousers that are usually cuffless. The summer uniform is similar, but made of light tan material.

Combat uniforms use either a temperate or desert camouflage pattern. These patterns were adopted in 2010–11 to replace the U.S. Woodland pattern used since 1985.

== Grades ==

=== Officers ===
Those who have completed high school will enter a special thirteen-week basic training in the Army as warrant officers, then attend the military officer school for five years (normally in Brussels, Belgium), before becoming a lieutenant in the Luxembourg Armed Forces.

Aspiring officers are sent to the Belgian École Royale Militaire in Brussels, or the Ecole Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr in France. After the first two years at these schools, officer-cadets receive the title of lieutenant.

After leaving military academy, officer candidates become probationary officers for a period of twenty-four months. The probation period consists of specialised military-branch training at a school abroad, and practical service within one of the Army&#x27;s units. If they succeed during this probation, their appointment as lieutenants is made permanent.

=== NCOs ===
Those who have completed five years of high school and have served four months as voluntary soldiers, will do a nine-month stage at the Infantry Training Department of the Belgian Army in Arlon, before becoming sergeants in the Luxembourg Armed Forces.

=== Career Corporals ===
Those who have not completed five years of high school may, after three years of service, become career corporals in the Luxembourg Armed Forces, if they pass physical and mental tests. They also have to pass a part of the NCO School in Belgium.

<text>The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has long been a prominent supporter of European political and economic integration. In 1921, Luxembourg and Belgium formed the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union (BLEU) to create an inter-exchangeable currency and a common customs regime. Post-war, Luxembourg became a founding member state of the United Nations, and dropped its policy of neutrality to become a founding member state of NATO. Luxembourg expanded its support for European integration, becoming a founding member state of the Benelux Economic Union (today&#x27;s Benelux Union), and one of the &quot;inner six&quot; founding member states of the three European Communities; the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), and the European Economic Community (EEC). Subsequently, Luxembourg became a founding member state of the European Union (EU) when the EEC and ECSC were incorporated into it in 1993. Luxembourg is a founding member of the Schengen Area, abolishing internal borders amongst its member states, named after the Luxembourg village where the original agreement — since incorporated into EU law — was signed in 1985. At the same time, the majority of Luxembourgers have consistently believed that European unity makes sense only in the context of a dynamic transatlantic relationship, and thus have traditionally pursued a pro-NATO, pro-US foreign policy.

Luxembourg is the site of the European Court of Justice, the European Investment Bank, the European Court of Auditors, the secretariat of the European Parliament, the Statistical Office of the European Commission (Eurostat), and other EU bodies.

<doc id="17839" wikidata="Q20075" url="?curid=17839" title="London Underground">
<text>The London Underground (also known simply as the Underground or as the Tube) is a rapid transit system serving Greater London and some parts of the adjacent home counties of Buckinghamshire, Essex and Hertfordshire in England.

The Underground has its origins in the Metropolitan Railway, opening on 10 January 1863 as the world&#x27;s first underground passenger railway. The Metropolitan is now part of the Circle, District, Hammersmith &amp; City and Metropolitan lines. The first line to operate underground electric traction trains, the City &amp; South London Railway in 1890, is now part of the Northern line.

The network has expanded to 11 lines with of track. However, the Underground does not cover most southern parts of Greater London; there are only 33 Underground stations south of the River Thames. The system&#x27;s 272 stations collectively accommodate up to 5million passenger journeys a day. In 2023/24 it was used for 1.181 billion passenger journeys.

The system&#x27;s first tunnels were built just below the ground, using the cut-and-cover method; later, smaller, roughly circular tunnels—which gave rise to its nickname, the Tube—were dug through at a deeper level. Despite its name, only 45% of the system is under the ground: much of the network in the outer environs of London is on the surface.

The early tube lines, originally owned by several private companies, were brought together under the Underground brand in the early 20th century, and eventually merged along with the sub-surface lines and bus services in 1933 to form &quot;London Transport&quot; under the control of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB). The current operator, London Underground Limited (LUL), is a wholly owned subsidiary of Transport for London (TfL), the statutory corporation responsible for the transport network in London. , 92% of operational expenditure is covered by passenger fares. The Travelcard ticket was introduced in 1983 and Oyster card, a contactless ticketing system, in 2003. Contactless bank card payments were introduced in 2014, the first such use on a public transport system.

The LPTB commissioned many new station buildings, posters and public artworks in a modernist style. The schematic Tube map, designed by Harry Beck in 1931, was voted a national design icon in 2006 and now includes other transport systems besides the Underground, such as the Docklands Light Railway, London Overground, Thameslink, the Elizabeth line, and Tramlink. Other famous London Underground branding includes the roundel and the Johnston typeface, created by Edward Johnston in 1916.

==History==
===Early years===
==== Sub-surface lines ====
The idea of an underground railway linking the City of London with the urban centre was proposed in the 1830s, and the Metropolitan Railway was granted permission to build such a line in 1854. To prepare construction, a short test tunnel was built in 1855 in Kibblesworth, a small town with geological properties similar to London. This test tunnel was used for two years in the development of the first underground train, and was later, in 1861, filled up. The world&#x27;s first underground railway, it opened in January 1863 between Paddington and Farringdon using gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives. It was hailed as a success, carrying 38,000 passengers on the opening day, and borrowing trains from other railways to supplement the service. The Metropolitan District Railway (commonly known as the District Railway) opened in December 1868 from South Kensington to Westminster as part of a plan for an underground &quot;inner circle&quot; connecting London&#x27;s main-line stations. The Metropolitan and District railways completed the Circle line in 1884, built using the cut and cover method. Both railways expanded, the District building five branches to the west reaching Ealing, Hounslow, Uxbridge, Richmond and Wimbledon and the Metropolitan eventually extended as far as in Buckinghamshire – more than from Baker Street and the centre of London.

==== Deep-level lines ====
For the first deep-level tube line, the City and South London Railway, two diameter circular tunnels were dug between King William Street (close to today&#x27;s Monument station) and Stockwell, under the roads to avoid the need for agreement with owners of property on the surface. This opened in 1890 with electric locomotives that hauled carriages with small opaque windows, nicknamed &quot;padded cells&quot;. The Waterloo and City Railway opened in 1898, followed by the Central London Railway in 1900, known as the &quot;twopenny tube&quot;. These two ran electric trains in circular tunnels having diameters between and , whereas the Great Northern and City Railway, which opened in 1904, was built to take main line trains from Finsbury Park to a Moorgate terminus in the City and had diameter tunnels.

While steam locomotives were in use on the Underground there were contrasting health reports. There were many instances of passengers collapsing whilst travelling, due to heat and pollution, leading for calls to clean the air through the installation of garden plants. The Metropolitan even encouraged beards for staff to act as an air filter. There were other reports claiming beneficial outcomes of using the Underground, including the designation of Great Portland Street as a &quot;sanatorium for [sufferers of ...] asthma and bronchial complaints&quot;, tonsillitis could be cured with acid gas and the Twopenny Tube cured anorexia.

==== Electrification ====
With the advent of electric Tube services (the Waterloo and City Railway and the Great Northern and City Railway), the Volks Electric Railway, in Brighton, and competition from electric trams, the pioneering Underground companies needed modernising. In the early 20th century, the District and Metropolitan railways needed to electrify and a joint committee recommended an AC system, the two companies co-operating because of the shared ownership of the inner circle. The District, needing to raise the finance necessary, found an investor in the American Charles Yerkes who favoured a DC system similar to that in use on the City &amp; South London and Central London railways. The Metropolitan Railway protested about the change of plan, but after arbitration by the Board of Trade, the DC system was adopted.

===Underground Electric Railways Company era===

Yerkes soon had control of the District Railway and established the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) in 1902 to finance and operate three tube lines, the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (Bakerloo), the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (Hampstead) and the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway, (Piccadilly), which all opened between 1906 and 1907. When the &quot;Bakerloo&quot; was so named in July 1906, &quot;The Railway Magazine&quot; called it an undignified &quot;gutter title&quot;. By 1907 the District and Metropolitan Railways had electrified the underground sections of their lines.

In January 1913, the UERL acquired the Central London Railway and the City &amp; South London Railway, as well as many of London&#x27;s bus and tram operators. Only the Metropolitan Railway, along with its subsidiaries the Great Northern &amp; City Railway and the East London Railway, and the Waterloo &amp; City Railway, by then owned by the main line London and South Western Railway, remained outside the Underground Group&#x27;s control.

A joint marketing agreement between most of the companies in the early years of the 20th century included maps, joint publicity, through ticketing and UD signs, incorporating the first bullseye symbol, outside stations in Central London. At the time, the term Underground was selected from three other proposed names; &#x27;Tube&#x27; and &#x27;Electric&#x27; were both officially rejected. Ironically, the term Tube was later adopted alongside the Underground. The Bakerloo line was extended north to Queen&#x27;s Park to join a new electric line from Euston to Watford, but the First World War delayed construction and trains reached in 1917. During air raids in 1915 people used the tube stations as shelters. An extension of the Central line west to Ealing was also delayed by the war and was completed in 1920. After the war, government-backed financial guarantees were used to expand the network and the tunnels of the City and South London and Hampstead railways were linked at Euston and Kennington; the combined service was not named the Northern line until later. The Metropolitan promoted housing estates near the railway with the &quot;Metro-land&quot; brand and nine housing estates were built near stations on the line. Electrification was extended north from Harrow to Rickmansworth, and branches opened from Rickmansworth to Watford in 1925 and from Wembley Park to Stanmore in 1932. The Piccadilly line was extended north to Cockfosters and took over District line branches to Harrow (later Uxbridge) and Hounslow.

===London Passenger Transport Board era===

In 1933, most of London&#x27;s underground railways, tramway and bus services were merged to form the London Passenger Transport Board, which used the London Transport brand. The Waterloo &amp; City Railway, which was by then in the ownership of the main line Southern Railway, remained with its existing owners. In the same year that the London Passenger Transport Board was formed, Harry Beck&#x27;s diagrammatic tube map first appeared.

In the following years, the outlying lines of the former Metropolitan Railway closed, the Brill Tramway in 1935, and the line from Quainton Road to Verney Junction in 1936. The 1935–40 New Works Programme included the extension of the Central and Northern lines and the Bakerloo line to take over the Metropolitan&#x27;s Stanmore branch. The Second World War suspended these plans after the Bakerloo line had reached Stanmore and the Northern line High Barnet and Mill Hill East in 1941. Following bombing in 1940, passenger services over the West London line were suspended, leaving Olympia exhibition centre without a railway service until a District line shuttle from Earl&#x27;s Court began after the war. After work restarted on the Central line extensions in east and west London, these were completed in 1949.

During the war many tube stations were used as air-raid shelters. They were not always a guarantee of safety however; on 11 January 1941 during the London Blitz, a bomb penetrated the booking hall of Bank Station, the blast from which killed 111 people, many of whom were sleeping in passageways and on platforms. On 3 March 1943, a test of the air-raid warning sirens, together with the firing of a new type of anti-aircraft rocket, resulted in a crush of people attempting to take shelter in Bethnal Green Underground station. A total of 173 people, including 62 children, died, making this both the worst civilian disaster in Britain during the Second World War, and the largest loss of life in a single incident on the London Underground network.

===London Transport Executive and Board era===

On 1 January 1948, under the provisions of the Transport Act 1947, the London Passenger Transport Board was nationalised and renamed the London Transport Executive, becoming a subsidiary transport organisation of the British Transport Commission, which was formed on the same day. Under the same act, the country&#x27;s main line railways were also nationalised, and their reconstruction was given priority over the maintenance of the Underground and most of the unfinished plans of the pre-war New Works Programme were shelved or postponed.

The District line needed new trains and an unpainted aluminium train entered service in 1953, this becoming the standard for new trains. In the early 1960s, the Metropolitan line was electrified as far as Amersham, British Railways providing services for the former Metropolitan line stations between Amersham and Aylesbury. In 1962, the British Transport Commission was abolished, and the London Transport Executive was renamed the London Transport Board, reporting directly to the Minister of Transport. Also during the 1960s, the Victoria line was dug under central London and, unlike the earlier tunnels, did not follow the roads above. The line opened in 1968–71 with the trains being driven automatically and magnetically encoded tickets collected by automatic gates gave access to the platforms.

===Greater London Council era===
On 1 January 1970, responsibility for public transport within Greater London passed from central government to local government, in the form of the Greater London Council (GLC), and the London Transport Board was abolished. The London Transport brand continued to be used by the GLC.

On 28 February 1975, a southbound train on the Northern City Line failed to stop at its Moorgate terminus and crashed into the wall at the end of the tunnel, in the Moorgate tube crash. There were 43 deaths and 74 injuries, the greatest loss of life during peacetime on the London Underground. In 1976, the Northern City Line was taken over by British Rail and linked up with the main line railway at Finsbury Park, a transfer that had already been planned prior to the accident.

In 1979, another new tube, the Jubilee line, named in honour of the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II, took over the Stanmore branch from the Bakerloo line, linking it to a newly constructed line between Baker Street and Charing Cross stations. Under the control of the GLC, London Transport introduced a system of fare zones for buses and underground trains that cut the average fare in 1981. Fares increased following a legal challenge but the fare zones were retained, and in the mid-1980s the Travelcard and the Capitalcard were introduced.

===London Regional Transport era===

In 1984, control of London Buses and the London Underground passed back to central government with the creation of London Regional Transport (LRT), which reported directly to the Secretary of State for Transport, still retaining the London Transport brand. One person operation had been planned in 1968, but conflict with the trade unions delayed introduction until the 1980s.

On 18 November 1987, fire broke out in an escalator at King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras tube station. The resulting fire cost the lives of 31 people and injured a further 100. London Underground was strongly criticised in the aftermath for its attitude to fires underground, and publication of the report into the fire led to the resignation of senior management of both London Underground and London Regional Transport. Following the fire, substantial improvements to safety on the Tube were implemented – including the banning of smoking, removal of wooden escalators, installation of CCTV and fire detectors, as well as comprehensive radio coverage for the emergency services.

In April 1994, the Waterloo &amp; City Railway, by then owned by British Rail and known as the Waterloo &amp; City line, was transferred to the London Underground. In 1999, the Jubilee Line Extension project extended the Jubilee line from Green Park station through the growing Docklands to Stratford station. This resulted in the closure of the short section of tunnel between Green Park and Charing Cross stations. The 11 new stations were designed to be &quot;future-proof&quot;, with wide passageways, large quantities of escalators and lifts, and emergency exits. The stations were the first on the Underground to have platform edge doors, and were built to have step-free access throughout. The stations have subsequently been praised as exemplary pieces of 20th-century architecture.

===Transport for London era===
In 2000, Transport for London (TfL) was created as an integrated body responsible for London&#x27;s transport system. Part of the Greater London Authority, the TfL Board is appointed by the Mayor of London, who also sets the structure and level of public transport fares in London. The day-to-day running of the corporation is left to the Commissioner of Transport for London.

TfL eventually replaced London Regional Transport, and discontinued the use of the London Transport brand in favour of its own brand. The transfer of responsibility was staged, with transfer of control of London Underground delayed until July 2003, when London Underground Limited became an indirect subsidiary of TfL.

In the early 2000s, London Underground was reorganised in a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) as part of a project to upgrade and modernise the system. Private infrastructure companies (infracos) would upgrade and maintain the railway, and London Underground would run the train service. One infraco – Metronet – went into administration in 2007, and TfL took over the other – Tube Lines – in 2010. Despite this, substantial investment to upgrade and modernise the Tube has taken place - with new trains (such as London Underground S7 and S8 Stock), new signalling, upgraded stations (such as King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras) and improved accessibility (such as at Green Park). Small changes to the Tube network occurred in the 2000s, with extensions to Heathrow Terminal 5, new station at Wood Lane and the Circle line changed from serving a closed loop around the centre of London to a spiral also serving Hammersmith in 2009.

In July 2005, four coordinated terrorist attacks took place, three of them occurring on the Tube network. It was the UK&#x27;s deadliest terrorist incident since 1988.

Electronic ticketing in the form of the contactless Oyster card was first introduced in 2003, with payment using contactless banks cards introduced in September 2014. In , over 12million Oyster cards and 35million contactless cards were used, generating around £5billion in ticketing revenue.

During the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Underground saw record passenger numbers, with over 4.3million people using the Tube on some days. This record was subsequently beaten in later years, with 4.82million passengers in December 2015. In 2013, the Underground celebrated its 150th anniversary, with celebratory events such as steam trains and installation of a unique Labyrinth artwork at each station.

Under TfL, London&#x27;s public transport network became more unified, with existing suburban rail lines across London upgraded and rebranded as London Overground from 2007, with the former East London line becoming part of the Overground network in 2010. Many Overground stations interchange with Underground ones, and Overground lines were added onto the Tube map.

In the 2010s, the £18.8billion Crossrail project built a new east–west railway tunnel under central London. The project involved rebuilding and expanding several central Underground stations including Tottenham Court Road and Whitechapel. By increasing rail capacity, the line aims to reduce overcrowding on the Tube and cut cross-London journey times. The railway opened as the Elizabeth line in May 2022. Although not part of the Underground, the line connects with several Underground stations.

In 2020, passenger numbers fell significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic and 40 stations were temporarily closed. The Northern Line Extension opened in September 2021, extending the Northern line from Kennington to Battersea Power Station via Nine Elms. The extension was privately funded, with contributions from developments across the Battersea Power Station, Vauxhall and Nine Elms areas.

==Infrastructure==
===Railway===
As of 2021, the Underground serves 272 stations. Sixteen stations (eight on each of the Metropolitan and Central lines) are outside the London region, with five of those beyond the M25 London Orbital motorway (Amersham, Chalfont &amp; Latimer, Chesham, and Chorleywood on the Metropolitan line and Epping on the Central).

Of the thirty-two London boroughs, six (Bexley, Bromley, Croydon, Kingston, Lewisham and Sutton) are not served by the Underground network, while Hackney has Old Street (on the Northern line Bank branch) and Manor House (on the Piccadilly line) just inside its boundaries. Lewisham was served by the East London line (with stations at New Cross and New Cross Gate) until 2010 when the line and the stations were transferred to the London Overground network.

London Underground&#x27;s eleven lines total in length, making it the eleventh longest metro system in the world. These are made up of the sub-surface network and the deep-tube lines.

The Circle, District, Hammersmith &amp; City, and Metropolitan lines form the sub-surface network, with cut-and-cover railway tunnels just below the surface and of a similar size to those on British main lines They converged on a bi-directional loop in central London, sharing tracks and stations with each other at various places along their respective routes.

The Bakerloo, Central, Jubilee, Northern, Piccadilly, Victoria and Waterloo &amp; City lines are deep-level tubes, with smaller trains that run in circular tunnels (&quot;tubes&quot;) with a diameter of about , with one tube for each direction. The seven deep-level lines have the exclusive use of tracks and stations along their routes with the exceptions of the Piccadilly line, which shares track with the District line, between Acton Town and Hanger Lane Junction, and with the Metropolitan line, between Rayners Lane and Uxbridge; and the Bakerloo line, which shares track with London Overground&#x27;s Watford DC Line for its above-ground section north of Queen&#x27;s Park.

Fifty-five per cent of the system runs on the surface. There are of sub-surface tunnels and of tube tunnels. Many of the central London Underground stations on deep-level tube routes are higher than the running lines to assist deceleration when arriving and acceleration when departing. Trains generally run on the left-hand track. In some places, the tunnels are above each other (for example, the Central line east of St Paul&#x27;s station); or trains run on the right (for example on the Victoria line between Warren Street and King&#x27;s Cross St. Pancras, to allow cross-platform interchange with the Northern line at Euston).

The lines are electrified with a four-rail DC system: a conductor rail between the rails is energised at and a rail outside the running rails at , giving a potential difference of . On the sections of line shared with mainline trains, such as the District line from East Putney to Wimbledon and Gunnersbury to Richmond, and the Bakerloo line north of Queen&#x27;s Park, the centre rail is bonded to the running rails.

The average speed on the Underground is . Outside the tunnels of central London, many lines&#x27; trains tend to travel at over in the suburban and countryside areas. The Metropolitan line can reach speeds of .

===Lines===

The London Underground was used for 1.181billion journeys in the year 20232024.


===Services using former and current main lines===

The Underground uses several railways and alignments that were built by main-line railway companies.
;Bakerloo line
:Between Queen&#x27;s Park and Harrow &amp; Wealdstone this runs over the Watford DC Line also used by London Overground, alongside the London &amp; North Western Railway (LNWR) main line that opened in 1837. The route was laid out by the LNWR in 1912–15 and is part of the Network Rail system.
;Central line
:The railway from just south of Leyton to just south of Loughton was built by Eastern Counties Railway in 1856 on the same alignment in use today. The Underground also uses the line built in 1865 by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) between Loughton to Ongar via Epping. The connection to the main line south of Leyton was closed in 1970 and removed in 1972. The line from Epping to Ongar was closed in 1994; most of the line is in use today by the heritage Epping Ongar Railway. The line between Newbury Park and Woodford junction (west of Roding Valley) via Hainault was built by the GER in 1903, the connections to the main line south of Newbury Park closing in 1947 (in the Ilford direction) and 1956 (in the Seven Kings direction).
;Central line
:The line from just north of White City to Ealing Broadway was built in 1917 by the Great Western Railway (GWR) and passenger service introduced by the Underground in 1920. North Acton to West Ruislip was built by GWR on behalf of the Underground in 1947–8 alongside the pre-existing tracks from Old Oak Common junction towards and beyond, which date from 1904. , the original Old Oak Common junction to route has one main-line train a day to and from Paddington.
;District line
:South of Kensington (Olympia) short sections of the 1862 West London Railway (WLR) and its 1863 West London Extension Railway (WLER) were used when District extended from Earl&#x27;s Court in 1872. The District had its own bay platform at Olympia built in 1958 along with track on the bed of the 1862–3 WLR/WLER northbound. The southbound WLR/WLER became the new northbound main line at that time, and a new southbound main-line track was built through the site of former goods yard. The 1872 junction closed in 1958, and a further connection to the WLR just south of Olympia closed in 1992. The branch is now segregated.
:The line between Campbell Road junction (now closed), near Bromley-by-Bow, and Barking was built by the London, Tilbury &amp; Southend Railway (LTSR) in 1858. The slow tracks were built 1903–05, when District services were extended from Bow Road (though there were no District services east of East Ham from 1905 to 1932). The slow tracks were shared with LTSR stopping and goods trains until segregated by 1962, when main-line trains stopped serving intermediate stations.
:The railway from Barking to Upminster was built by LTSR in 1885 and the District extended over the route in 1902. District withdrew between 1905 and 1932, when the route was quadrupled. Main-line trains ceased serving intermediate stations in 1962, and the District line today only uses the 1932 slow tracks.
:The westbound track between east of Ravenscourt Park and Turnham Green and Turnham Green to Richmond (also used by London Overground) follows the alignment of a railway built by the London &amp; South Western Railway (LSWR) in 1869. The eastbound track between Turnham Green and east of Ravenscourt Park follows the alignment built in 1911; this was closed 1916 but was re-used when the Piccadilly line was extended in 1932. The section between Turnham Green and Richmond still belongs to Network Rail now.
:The line between East Putney and Wimbledon was built by the LSWR in 1889. The last scheduled main-line service ran in 1941 but it still sees a few through Waterloo passenger services at the start and end of the daily timetable. The route is also used for scheduled ECS movements to/from Wimbledon Park depot and for Waterloo services diverted during disruptions and track closures elsewhere. This section is now owned by London Underground but the signalling is still operated by Network Rail.
;Hammersmith &amp; City
:Between Paddington and Westbourne Park Underground station, the line runs alongside the main line. The Great Western main line opened in 1838, serving a temporary terminus the other side of Bishop&#x27;s Road. When the current Paddington station opened in 1854, the line passed to the south of the old station. On opening in 1864, the Hammersmith &amp; City Railway (then part of the Metropolitan Railway) ran via the main line to a junction at Westbourne Park, until 1867 when two tracks opened to the south of the main line, with a crossing near Westbourne Bridge, Paddington. The current two tracks to the north of the main line and the subway east of Westbourne Park opened in 1878. The Hammersmith &amp; City route is now completely segregated from the main line.
;Jubilee line
:The rail route between Canning Town and Stratford was built by the GER in 1846, with passenger services starting in 1847. The original alignment was quadrupled &quot;in stages between 1860 and 1892&quot; for freight services before the extra (western) tracks were lifted as traffic declined during the 20th century, and were re-laid for Jubilee line services that started in 1999. The current Docklands Light Railway (ex-North London line) uses the original eastern alignment and the Jubilee uses the western alignment.
;Northern line
:The line from East Finchley to Mill Hill East was opened in 1867, and from Finchley Central to High Barnet in 1872, both by the Great Northern Railway.
;Piccadilly line
:The westbound track between east of Ravenscourt Park and Turnham Green was built by LSWR in 1869, and originally used for eastbound main-line and District services. The eastbound track was built in 1911; it closed in 1916 but was re-used when the Piccadilly line was extended in 1932.

===Main line services using LU tracks===
Chiltern Railways shares track with the Metropolitan Line between Harrow-on-the-Hill and Amersham. Three South Western Railway passenger trains a day use District Line tracks between Wimbledon and East Putney.

===Trains===
London Underground trains come in two sizes, larger sub-surface trains and smaller deep-tube trains. Since the early 1960s all passenger trains have been electric multiple units with sliding doors and a train last ran with a guard in 2000. All lines use fixed-length trains with between six and eight cars, except for the Waterloo &amp; City line that uses four cars. New trains are designed for maximum number of standing passengers and for speed of access to the cars and have regenerative braking and public address systems. Since 1999 all new stock has had to comply with accessibility regulations that require such things as access and room for wheelchairs, and the size and location of door controls. All underground trains are required to comply with The Rail Vehicle Accessibility (Non Interoperable Rail System) Regulations 2010 (RVAR 2010) by 2020.

Stock on sub-surface lines is identified by a letter (such as S Stock, used on the Metropolitan line), while tube stock is identified by the year of intended introduction (for example, 1996 Stock, used on the Jubilee line).

===Depots===
The Underground is served by the following depots:
* Bakerloo: Stonebridge Park, Queen&#x27;s Park, London Road
* Central: Hainault, Ruislip, White City
* Circle: Hammersmith
* District: Ealing Common, Lillie Bridge, Upminster
* Hammersmith &amp; City: Hammersmith
* Jubilee: Neasden, Stratford Market
* Metropolitan: Neasden
* Northern: Edgware, Golders Green, Highgate, Morden
* Piccadilly: Cockfosters, Northfields
* Victoria: Northumberland Park
* Waterloo &amp; City: Waterloo
*London Underground: Acton Works

===Disused and abandoned stations===

In the years since the first parts of the London Underground opened, many stations and routes have been closed. Some stations were closed because of low passenger numbers rendering them uneconomical; some became redundant after lines were re-routed or replacements were constructed; and others are no longer served by the Underground but remain open to National Rail main line services. In some cases, such as Aldwych and Ongar, the buildings remain and are used for other purposes. In others, such as British Museum, all evidence of the station has been lost through demolition.

London Transport Museum runs guided tours of several disused stations including Down Street and Aldwych through its &quot;Hidden London&quot; programme. The tours look at the history of the network and feature historical details drawn from the museum&#x27;s own archives and collections.

=== Proposed line extensions ===
====Bakerloo line extension to Lewisham====

A southern extension of the Bakerloo line from Elephant &amp; Castle has been proposed multiple times since the line opened. In the 2010s, consultation events and preliminary design work took place on an extension. A route from Elephant &amp; Castle to Lewisham via the Old Kent Road and was chosen by Transport for London in 2019. The line could be extended further on the Hayes National Rail line in future. Estimated to cost between £4.7billion to £7.9billion (in 2017 prices), the extension would take around 7 years to construct. Due to financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, work to implement the extension is currently on hold.

==== Other proposed extensions and lines ====
Several other extensions have been proposed in recent years, including a further extension of the Northern line to Clapham Junction. The long proposed Croxley Rail Link (an extension of the Metropolitan line) was cancelled in 2018 due to higher than expected costs and lack of funding.

In 2019, the Canary Wharf Group suggested the construction of a new rail line between Euston and Canary Wharf, to improve connections to the future High Speed 2 railway.

In 2021, Harlow District Council proposed extending the Central line from its eastern terminus in Epping to Harlow. They argued this would reduce travel times to Epping and London, and help with efforts to add 19,000 new homes to the town and expand the population to 130,000. However, no funding has been allocated for this proposed extension.

===Line improvements===
====Bakerloo line====
The thirty-six 1972-stock trains on the Bakerloo line have already exceeded their original design life of 40 years. London Underground is therefore extending their operational life by making major repairs to many of the trains to maintain reliability. The Bakerloo line will receive new trains as part of the New Tube for London project. This will replace the existing fleet with new air-cooled articulated trains and a new signalling system to allow Automatic Train Operation. The line is predicted to run a maximum of 27 trains per hour, a 25% increase on the current 21 trains per hour during peak periods.

====Central line====

The Central line was the first line to be modernised in the 1990s, with 85 new 1992-stock trains and a new automatic signalling system installed to allow Automatic Train Operation. The line runs 34 trains per hour for half an hour in the morning peak but is unable to operate more frequently because of a lack of additional trains. The 85 existing 1992-stock trains are the most unreliable on the London Underground as they are equipped with the first generation of solid-state direct-current thyristor-control traction equipment. The trains often break down, have to be withdrawn from service at short notice and at times are not available when required, leading to gaps in service at peak times. Although relatively modern and well within their design life, the trains need work in the medium term to ensure the continued reliability of the traction control equipment and maintain fleet serviceability until renewal, which is expected between 2028 and 2032. Major work is to be undertaken on the fleet to ensure their continued reliability with brakes, traction control systems, doors, automatic control systems being repaired or replaced, among other components. The Central line will be part of the New Tube for London Project. This will replace the existing fleet with new air-cooled walkthrough trains and a new automatic signalling system. The line is predicted to run 36 trains per hour, a 25% increase compared to the present service of 34 trains for the busiest 30 minutes in the morning and evening peaks and 27–30 trains per hour during the rest of the peak.

====Jubilee line====
The signalling system on the Jubilee line has been replaced to increase capacity on the line by 20%—the line now runs 30 trains per hour at peak times, compared to the previous 24 trains per hour. As with the Victoria line, the service frequency is planned to increase to 36 trains per hour. To enable this, ventilation, power supply and control and signalling systems will be adapted and modified to allow the increase in frequency. London Underground also plans to add up to an additional 18 trains to the current fleet of 63 trains of 1996 stock.

====Northern line====
The signalling system on the Northern line has been replaced to increase capacity on the line by 20%, as the line now runs 24 trains per hour at peak times, compared to 20 previously. Capacity can be increased further if the operation of the Charing Cross and Bank branches is separated. To enable this up to 50 additional trains will be built in addition to the current 106 1995 stock. Five trains will be required for the Northern line extension and 45 to increase frequencies on the rest of the line. This, combined with segregation of trains at Camden Town junction, will allow 30–36 trains per hour compared to 24 trains per hour currently.

====Piccadilly line====
The eighty-six 1973 stock trains that operate on the Piccadilly line are some of the most reliable trains on the London Underground. The trains have exceeded their design life of around 40 years and are in need of replacement. The Piccadilly line will be part of the New Tube for London Project. This will replace the existing fleet with new air-cooled walk-through trains and a new signalling system to allow Automatic Train Operation. The line is predicted to run 30–36 trains per hour, up to a 50% increase compared to the 24–25 train per hour service provided today. The line will be the first to be upgraded as part of the New Tube for London Project, as passenger numbers have increased over recent years and are expected to increase further. This line is important in this project because it currently provides a less frequent service than other lines.

====Victoria line====
The signalling system on the Victoria line has been replaced to increase capacity on the line by around 25%; the line now runs up to 36 trains per hour compared to 27–28 previously. The trains have been replaced with 47 new higher-capacity 2009-stock trains. The peak frequency was increased to 36 trains per hour in 2016 after track works were completed to the layout of the points at Walthamstow Central crossover, which transfers northbound trains to the southbound line for their return journey. This resulted in a 40% increase in capacity between Seven Sisters and Walthamstow Central.

====Waterloo &amp; City line====
The line was upgraded with five new 1992-stock trains in the early 1990s, at the same time as the Central line was upgraded. The line operates under traditional signalling and does not use Automatic Train Operation. The line will be part of the New Tube for London Project. This will replace the existing fleet with new air-cooled walk-through trains and a new signalling system to allow Automatic Train Operation. The line is predicted to run 30 trains per hour, an increase of up to 50% on the current 21 trains per hour. The line may also be one of the first to be upgraded, alongside the Piccadilly line, with new trains, systems and platform-edge doors to test the systems before the Central and Bakerloo lines are upgraded.

====Sub-surface lines (District, Metropolitan, Hammersmith &amp; City and Circle)====
New S Stock trains have been introduced on the sub-surface (District, Metropolitan, Hammersmith &amp; City and Circle) lines. These were all delivered by 2017. 191 trains have been introduced: 58 for the Metropolitan line and 133 for the Circle, District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines. The track, electrical supply and signalling systems are also being upgraded in a programme to increase peak-hour capacity. The replacement of the signalling system and the introduction of Automatic Train Operation and Control is scheduled for 2019–22. A control room for the sub-surface network has been built in Hammersmith and an automatic train control (ATC) system is to replace ageing signalling equipment dating from between the mid-1920s and late 1980s, including the signal cabin at Edgware Road, the control room at Earl&#x27;s Court, and the signalling centre at Baker Street. Bombardier won the contract in June 2011 but was released by agreement in December 2013, and London Underground has now issued another signalling contract, with Thales.

===New trains for deep-level lines===

In mid-2014, Transport for London issued a tender for up to 18 trains for the Jubilee line and up to 50 trains for the Northern line. These would be used to increase frequencies and cover the Battersea extension on the Northern line.

In early 2014, the Bakerloo, Central, Piccadilly and Waterloo &amp; City line rolling-stock replacement project was renamed &quot;New Tube for London&quot; (NTfL) and moved from the feasibility stage to the design and specification stage. The study had showed that, with new generation trains and re-signalling:
* Piccadilly line capacity could be increased by 60% with 33 trains per hour (tph) at peak times by 2025.
* Central line capacity increased by 25% with 33 tph at peak times by 2030.
* Waterloo &amp; City line capacity increased by 50% by 2032, after the track at Waterloo station is remodelled.
* Bakerloo line capacity could be increased by 25% with 27 tph at peak times by 2033.
The project is estimated to cost £16.42billion (£9.86billion at 2013 prices). A notice was published on 28 February 2014 in the Official Journal of the European Union asking for expressions of interest in building the trains. On 9 October 2014, TFL published a shortlist of those (Alstom, Siemens, Hitachi, CAF and Bombardier) who had expressed an interest in supplying 250 trains for between £1.0billion and £2.5billion, and on the same day opened an exhibition with a design by PriestmanGoode. The fully automated trains may be able to run without drivers, but the ASLEF and RMT trade unions that represent the drivers strongly oppose this, saying it would affect safety. The invitation to tender for the trains was issued in January 2016; the specifications for the Piccadilly line infrastructure are expected in 2016, and the first train is due to run on the Piccadilly line in 2023. Siemens Mobility&#x27;s Inspiro design was selected in June 2018 in a £1.5billion contract.

===Ventilation and cooling===

When the Bakerloo line opened in 1906, it was advertised with a maximum temperature of , but over time the tube tunnels have warmed up. In 1938 approval was given for a ventilation improvement programme, and a refrigeration unit was installed in a lift shaft at Tottenham Court Road. Temperatures of were reported in the 2006 European heat wave. It was claimed in 2002 that, if animals were being transported, temperatures on the Tube would break European Commission animal welfare laws. A 2000 study reported that air quality was 73 times worse than at street level, with a passenger inhaling the same mass of particulates during a twenty-minute journey on the Northern line as when smoking a cigarette. The main purpose of the London Underground&#x27;s ventilation fans is to extract hot air from the tunnels, and fans across the network are being refurbished, although complaints of noise from local residents preclude their use at full power at night.

In June 2006 a groundwater cooling system was installed at Victoria station. In 2012, air-cooling units were installed on platforms at Green Park station using cool deep groundwater and at Oxford Circus using chiller units at the top of an adjacent building. New air-conditioned trains have been introduced on the sub-surface lines, but were initially ruled out for the tube trains due to space being considered limited on tube trains for air-conditioning units and that these would heat the tunnels even more. The New Tube for London, which will replace the trains for the Bakerloo, Central, Waterloo and City and Piccadilly lines, is planned to have air conditioning for the new trains along with better energy conservation and regenerative braking.

In the original Tube design, trains passing through close fitting tunnels act as pistons to create air pressure gradients between stations. This pressure difference drives ventilation between platforms and the surface exits through the passenger foot network. This system depends on adequate cross-sectional area of the airspace above the passengers&#x27; heads in the foot tunnels and escalators, where laminar airflow is proportional to the fourth power of the radius, the Hagen–Poiseuille equation. It also depends on an absence of turbulence in the tunnel headspace. In many stations the ventilation system is now ineffective because of alterations that reduce tunnel diameters and increase turbulence. An example is Green Park tube station, where false ceiling panels attached to metal frames have been installed that reduce the above-head airspace diameter by more than half in many parts. This has the effect of reducing laminar airflow by 94%.

Originally, air turbulence was kept to a minimum by keeping all signage flat to the tunnel walls. Now, the ventilation space above head height is crowded with ducting, conduits, cameras, speakers and equipment acting as a baffle plates with predictable reductions in flow. Often, electronic signs have their flat surface at right angles to the main air flow, causing choked flow. Temporary sign boards that stand at the top of escalators also maximise turbulence. The alterations to the ventilation system are important, not only to heat exchange.

==== Air quality ====
The Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP) has reported on the relative risks of breathing air pollution in different situations. In January 2019, for example, it reported that pollution from particulates is up to 30 times higher on the London Underground than on streets in the roads above, with the Northern Line having the worst air quality.

===Lifts and escalators===
Originally access to the deep-tube platforms was by a lift. Each lift was staffed, and at some quiet stations in the 1920s the ticket office was moved into the lift, or it was arranged that the lift could be controlled from the ticket office. The first escalator on the London Underground was installed in 1911 between the District and Piccadilly platforms at Earl&#x27;s Court and from the following year new deep-level stations were provided with escalators instead of lifts. The escalators had a diagonal shunt at the top landing. In 1921 a recorded voice instructed passengers to stand on the right and signs followed in the Second World War. Travellers were asked to stand on the right so that anyone wishing to overtake them would have a clear passage on the left side of the escalator. The first &#x27;comb&#x27; type escalator was installed in 1924 at Clapham Common. In the 1920s and 1930s many lifts were replaced by escalators. After the fatal 1987 King&#x27;s Cross fire, all wooden escalators were replaced with metal ones and the mechanisms are regularly degreased to lower the potential for fires. The only wooden escalator not to be replaced was at Greenford station, which remained until March 2014 when TfL replaced it with the first incline lift on the UK transport network in October 2015.

There are 426 escalators on the London Underground system and the longest, at , is at Angel. The shortest, at Stratford, gives a vertical rise of . There are 184 lifts, and numbers have increased in recent years because of investment in making tube stations accessible. Over 28 stations will have lifts installed over the next 10 years, bringing the total of step-free stations to over 100. Lift and escalators are abundant with advertising posters which can be used for artistic purposes due to the nature of their layout.
===Wi-Fi and mobile phone reception===
In mid-2012, London Underground, in partnership with Virgin Media, trialled Wi-Fi hotspots in many stations, but not in the tunnels, that allowed passengers free internet access. The free trial proved successful and was extended to the end of 2012, whereupon it switched to a service freely available to subscribers to Virgin Media and others, or as a paid-for service. It was not previously possible to use mobile phones on most parts of the Underground (excluding services running overground or occasionally sub-surface, depending on the phone and carrier) using native 2G, 3G or 4G networks, and a project to extend coverage before the 2012 Olympics was abandoned because of commercial and technical difficulties.

In March 2020, 2G, 3G and 4G signal was made available on parts of the Jubilee line, between Westminster and Canning Town, throughout the stations and tunnels as part of an initial trial.

In June 2021, Vodafone dropped London Underground Wi-Fi connectivity across the entire network. This was restored in April 2023 after control of the Wi-Fi connectivity moved from Virgin Media to Boldyn Networks as part of their 20-year concession deal with Transport for London, providing data connectivity across the entire network.

In December 2022, additional mobile coverage, including 5G connectivity, launched at a small subset of stations and tunnel segments on the Central line, with a view to expand to the full set of sub-surface stations and tunnels on the London Underground, and also the Elizabeth Line, by the end of 2024. Further stations on the Northern line were launched from January 2023, with additional Northern line stations also being added in June 2023. Not all stations have identical coverage solutions, with some not having 5G connectivity present. As of June 2023, testing has begun on sections of the Bakerloo, Piccadilly and Victoria lines.

In November and December 2023, more mobile data coverage was launched on more stations on the Northern and Central Lines. On the Northern line: all stations from Tottenham Court Road to Euston. on the Central line: from Oxford Circus to Chancery Lane.

== Travelling ==

===Ticketing===
The Underground received £2.669billion in fares in 2016/17 and uses Transport for London&#x27;s zonal fare system to calculate fares. There are nine zones with zone 1 being the central zone, which includes the loop of the Circle line with a few stations to the south of River Thames. The only London Underground stations in Zones 7 to 9 are on the Metropolitan line beyond Moor Park, outside London region. Some stations are in two zones, and the cheapest fare applies. Paper tickets, the contactless Oyster cards, contactless debit or credit cards and Apple Pay and Android Pay smartphones and watches can be used for travel. Single and return tickets are available in either format, but Travelcards (season tickets) for longer than a day are available only on Oyster cards.

TfL introduced the Oyster card in 2003; this is a pre-payment smartcard with an embedded contactless RFID chip. It can be loaded with Travelcards and used on the Underground, the Overground, buses, trams, the Docklands Light Railway, and National Rail services within London. Fares for single journeys are cheaper than paper tickets, and a daily cap limits the total cost in a day to the price of a Day Travelcard. The Oyster card must be &#x27;touched in&#x27; at the start and end of a journey, otherwise it is regarded as &#x27;incomplete&#x27; and the maximum fare is charged. In March 2012 the cost of this in the previous year to travellers was £66.5million.

In 2014, TfL became the first public transport provider in the world to accept payment from contactless bank cards. The Underground first started accepting contactless debit and credit cards in September 2014. This was followed by the adoption of Apple Pay in 2015 and Android Pay in 2016, allowing payment using a contactless-enabled phone or smartwatch. Over 500million journeys have taken place using contactless payments, and TfL has become one of Europe&#x27;s largest contactless merchants, with around 1 in 10 contactless transactions in the UK taking place on the TfL network. This technology, developed in-house by TfL, has been licensed to other major cities like New York City and Boston.

A concessionary fare scheme is operated by London Councils for residents who are disabled or meet certain age criteria. Residents born before 1951 were eligible after their 60th birthday, whereas those born in 1955 will need to wait until they are 66. Called a &quot;Freedom Pass&quot;, it allows free travel on TfL-operated routes at all times and is valid on some National Rail services within London at weekends and after 09:30 on Monday to Friday. Since 2010, the Freedom Pass has included an embedded holder&#x27;s photograph; it lasts five years between renewals.

In addition to automatic and staffed faregates at stations, the Underground also operates on a proof-of-payment system. The system is patrolled by both uniformed and plain-clothes fare inspectors with hand-held Oyster card readers. Passengers travelling without a valid ticket must pay a penalty fare of £80 (£40 if paid within 21days) and can be prosecuted for fare evasion under the Regulation of Railways Act 1889 and Transport for London Byelaws.

===Hours of operation===
The tube closes overnight during the week, but since 2016, the Central, Jubilee, Northern, Piccadilly, and Victoria lines, as well as a short section of the London Overground have operated all night on Friday and Saturday nights. The first trains run from about 05:00 and the last trains until just after 01:00, with later starting times on Sunday mornings. The nightly closures are used for maintenance, but some lines stay open on New Year&#x27;s Eve and run for longer hours during major public events such as the 2012 London Olympics. Some lines are occasionally closed for scheduled engineering work at weekends.

The Underground runs a limited service on Christmas Eve with some lines closing early, and does not operate on Christmas Day. Since 2010 a dispute between London Underground and trade unions over holiday pay has resulted in a limited service on Boxing Day.

====Night Tube====

On 19 August 2016, London Underground launched a 24-hour service on the Victoria and Central lines with plans in place to extend this to the Piccadilly, Northern and Jubilee lines starting on Friday morning and continuing right through until Sunday evening. The Night Tube proposal was originally scheduled to start on 12 September 2015, following completion of upgrades, but in August 2015 it was announced that the start date for the Night Tube had been pushed back because of ongoing talks about contract terms between trade unions and London Underground. On 23 May 2016 it was announced that the night service would launch on 19 August 2016 for the Central and Victoria lines. The service operates on the following lines:

;Central line
:between Ealing Broadway and Hainault via Newbury Park or Loughton. No service on the West Ruislip Branch, between Woodford and Hainault via Grange Hill or between Loughton and Epping.
;Northern line
:between Morden and Edgware / High Barnet via Charing Cross. No service on Mill Hill East, Battersea or Bank branches.
;Piccadilly line
:between Cockfosters and Heathrow Terminals 1, 2, 3 and 5. No service to Terminal 4 or between Acton Town and Uxbridge.
;Jubilee line
:Full line – Stratford to Stanmore.
;Victoria line
:Full line – Walthamstow Central to Brixton.

The Jubilee, Piccadilly and Victoria lines, and the Central line between White City and Leytonstone, operate at 10-minute intervals. The Central line operates at 20-minute intervals between Leytonstone and Hainault, between Leytonstone and Loughton, and between White City and Ealing Broadway. The Northern line operates at roughly 8-minute intervals between Morden and Camden Town via Charing Cross, and at 15-minute intervals between Camden Town and Edgware and between Camden Town and High Barnet.

Night Tube services were suspended in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. They were reinstated partially in November 2021 and fully in July 2022.

===Accessibility===

Accessibility for people with limited mobility was not considered when most of the system was built, and before 1993 fire regulations prohibited wheelchairs on the Underground. The stations on the Jubilee Line Extension, opened in 1999, were the first stations on the system designed with accessibility in mind, but retrofitting accessibility features to the older stations is a major investment that is planned to take over twenty years. A 2010 London Assembly report concluded that over 10% of people in London had reduced mobility and, with an ageing population, numbers will increase in the future.

The standard issue tube map indicates stations that are step-free from street to platforms. There can also be a step from platform to train as large as and a gap between the train and curved platforms, and these distances are marked on the map. Access from platform to train at some stations can be assisted using a boarding ramp operated by staff, and a section has been raised on some platforms to reduce the step.

, there are 90 stations with step-free access from platform to train, and there are plans to provide step-free access at another 11 stations by 2024. By 2016 a third of stations had platform humps that reduce the step from platform to train. New trains, such as those being introduced on the sub-surface network, have access and room for wheelchairs, improved audio and visual information systems and accessible door controls.

===Delays and overcrowding===

During peak hours, stations can get so crowded that they need to be closed. Passengers may not get on the first train and the majority of passengers do not find a seat on their trains, some trains having more than four passengers every square metre. When asked, passengers report overcrowding as the aspect of the network that they are least satisfied with, and overcrowding has been linked to poor productivity and potential poor heart health. Capacity increases have been overtaken by increased demand, and peak overcrowding has increased by 16 percent since 2004–05.

Compared with 2003–04, the reliability of the network had increased in 2010–11, with lost customer hours reduced from 54million to 40million. Passengers are entitled to a refund if their journey is delayed by 15minutes or more due to circumstances within the control of TfL, and in 2010, 330,000 passengers out of a potential 11million Tube passengers claimed compensation for delays. Mobile phone apps and services have been developed to help passengers claim their refund more efficiently.

===Safety===

London Underground is authorised to operate trains by the Office of Rail and Road. there had been 310 days since the last major incident, when a passenger had died after falling on the track. there have been nine consecutive years in which no employee fatalities have occurred. A special staff training facility was opened at West Ashfield tube station in TFL&#x27;s Ashfield House, West Kensington in 2010 at a cost of £800,000. Meanwhile, Mayor of London Boris Johnson decided it should be demolished along with the Earls Court Exhibition Centre as part of Europe&#x27;s biggest regeneration scheme.

In November 2011 it was reported that 80 people had died by suicide in the previous year on the London Underground, up from 46 in 2000. Most platforms at deep tube stations have pits, often referred to as &#x27;suicide pits&#x27;, beneath the track. These were constructed in 1926 to aid drainage of water from the platforms, but also halve the likelihood of a fatality when a passenger falls or jumps in front of a train.

=== Tube Challenge ===
The Tube Challenge is the competition for the fastest time to travel to all London Underground stations, tracked by Guinness World Records since 1960. The goal is to visit all the stations on the system, but not necessarily using all the lines; participants may connect between stations on foot, or by using other forms of public transport.

As of 2021, the record for fastest completion was held by Steve Wilson (UK) and Andi James (Finland), who completed the challenge in 15 hours, 45 minutes and 38 seconds on 21 May 2015.

==Design and the arts==

===Map===

Early maps of the Metropolitan and District railways were city maps with the lines superimposed, and the District published a pocket map in 1897. A Central London Railway route diagram appears on a 1904 postcard and 1905 poster, similar maps appearing in District Railway cars in 1908. In the same year, following a marketing agreement between the operators, a joint central area map that included all the lines was published. A new map was published in 1921 without any background details, but the central area was squashed, requiring smaller letters and arrows. Although Fred H. Stingemore enlarged the central area of the map, it was Harry Beck who took this further by distorting geography and simplifying the map so that the railways appeared as straight lines with equally spaced stations. He presented his original draft in 1931, and after initial rejection it was first printed in 1933. Today&#x27;s tube map is an evolution of that original design, and the ideas are used by many metro systems around the world.

The current standard Tube map shows the Docklands Light Railway, London Overground, IFS Cloud Cable Car, London Tramlink and the London Underground; a more detailed map covering a larger area, published by National Rail and Transport for London, includes suburban railway services. The tube map came second in a BBC and London Transport Museum poll asking for a favourite UK design icon of the 20th century and the underground&#x27;s 150th anniversary was celebrated by a Google Doodle on the search engine.

Commissioned by Art on the Underground, the cover of the pocket map is designed by various British and international artists, one of the largest public art commissions in the UK.

===Roundel===

While the first use of a roundel in a London transport context was the trademark of the London General Omnibus Company registered in 1905, it was first used on the Underground in 1908 when the UERL placed a solid red circle behind station nameboards on platforms to highlight the name. The word &quot;UD&quot; was placed in a roundel instead of a station name on posters in 1912 by Charles Sharland and Alfred France, as well as on undated and possibly earlier posters from the same period.

Transport administrator Frank Pick, wanting to establish a strong corporate identity and visual brand for the Underground, thought the solid red disc cumbersome and took a version where the disc became a ring from a 1915 Sharland poster and gave it to Edward Johnston to develop, and registered the symbol as a trademark in 1917. The roundel was first printed on a map cover using the Johnston typeface in June 1919, and printed in colour the following October.

After the UERL was absorbed into the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933, it used forms of the roundel for buses, trams and coaches, as well as the Underground. The words &quot;London Transport&quot; were added inside the ring, above and below the bar. The Carr-Edwards report, published in 1938 as possibly the first attempt at a graphics standards manual, introduced stricter guidelines. Between 1948 and 1957 the word &quot;Underground&quot; in the bar was replaced by &quot;London Transport&quot;. , forms of the roundel, with differing colours for the ring and bar, are used for other TfL services, such as London Buses, Tramlink, London Overground, London River Services and Docklands Light Railway. Crossrail will also be identified with a roundel. The 100th anniversary of the roundel was celebrated in 2008 by TfL commissioning 100 artists to produce works that celebrate the design. Roundels are featured outside many underground stations; they are commonly mounted on a white pole known as a &quot;Venetian mast&quot;.

In 2016, Tate Modern commissioned conceptual artist Michael Craig-Martin to &quot;reimagine&quot; the roundel, changing its colours for the first time since the sign was introduced. His design was displayed at Southwark Station in collaboration with Art on the Underground to mark the opening weekend of the new Tate Modern gallery situated near the station.

===Architecture===

Seventy of the 272 London Underground stations use buildings that are on the Statutory List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest, and five have entrances in listed buildings. The Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s original seven stations were inspired by Italianate designs, with the platforms lit by daylight from above and by gas lights in large glass globes. Early District Railway stations were similar and on both railways the further from central London the station the simpler the construction. The City &amp; South London Railway opened with red-brick buildings, designed by Thomas Phillips Figgis, topped with a lead-covered dome that contained the lift mechanism and weather vane (still visible at many stations, such as Clapham Common). The Central London Railway appointed Harry Bell Measures as architect, who designed its pinkish-brown steel-framed buildings with larger entrances.

In the first decade of the 20th century Leslie Green established a house style for the tube stations built by the UERL, which were clad in ox-blood faience blocks. Green pioneered using building design to guide passengers with direction signs on tiled walls, with the stations given a unique identity with patterns on the platform walls. Many of these tile patterns survive, though a significant number of these are now replicas. Harry W. Ford was responsible for the design of at least 17 UERL and District Railway stations, including Barons Court and Embankment, and claimed to have first thought of enlarging the U and D in the UD wordmark. The Met&#x27;s architect Charles Walter Clark had used a neo-classical design for rebuilding Baker Street and Paddington Praed Street stations before the First World War and, although the fashion had changed, continued with Farringdon in 1923. The buildings had metal lettering attached to pale walls. Clark would later design &quot;Chiltern Court&quot;, the large, luxurious block of apartments at Baker Street, that opened in 1929. In the 1920s and 1930s, Charles Holden designed a series of modernist and art-deco stations some of which he described as his &#x27;brick boxes with concrete lids&#x27;. Holden&#x27;s design for the Underground&#x27;s headquarters building at 55 Broadway included avant-garde sculptures by Jacob Epstein, Eric Gill and Henry Moore.

When the Central line was extended east, the stations were simplified Holden proto-Brutalist designs, and a cavernous concourse built at Gants Hill in honour of early Moscow Metro stations. Few new stations were built in the 50 years after 1948, but Misha Black was appointed design consultant for the 1960s Victoria line, contributing to the line&#x27;s uniform look, with each station having an individual tile motif. Notable stations from this period include Moor Park, the stations of the Piccadilly line extension to Heathrow and Hillingdon.

In recent years, the stations of the 1990s Jubilee Line Extension were designed in a high-tech style by architects such as Norman Foster and Michael Hopkins. The project was critically acclaimed, with the Royal Fine Arts Commission describing the project as &quot;an example of patronage at its best and most enlightened&quot;, and two stations shortlisted for the Stirling Prize. Stations were built to the latest standards, future proofed for growth, with innovations such as Platform screen doors. West Ham station was built as a homage to the red brick tube stations of the 1930s, using brick, concrete and glass.

Many platforms have unique interior designs to help passenger identification. The tiling at Baker Street incorporates repetitions of Sherlock Holmes&#x27;s silhouette; at Tottenham Court Road semi-abstract mosaics by Eduardo Paolozzi feature musical instruments, tape machines and butterflies; and at Charing Cross, David Gentleman designed the mural depicting the construction of the Eleanor Cross. Robyn Denny designed the murals on the Northern line platforms at Embankment.

===Johnston typeface===

The first posters used various typefaces, as was contemporary practice, and station signs used sans serif block capitals. The Johnston typeface was developed in upper and lower case in 1916, and a complete set of blocks, marked Johnston Sans, was made by the printers the following year. A bold version of the capitals was developed by Johnston in 1929. The Metropolitan Railway changed to a serif letterform for its signs in the 1920s, used on the stations rebuilt by Clark. Johnston was adopted systemwide after the formation of the LPTB in 1933 and the LT wordmark was applied to locomotives and carriages. Johnston was redesigned, becoming New Johnston, for photo-typesetting in the early 1980s when Elichi Kono designed a range that included Light, Medium and Bold, each with its italic version. The typesetters P22 developed today&#x27;s electronic version, sometimes called TfL Johnston, in 1997.

===Posters and patronage of the arts===

Early advertising posters used various typefaces. Graphic posters first appeared in the 1890s, and it became possible to print colour images economically in the early 20th century. The Central London Railway used colour illustrations in their 1905 poster, and from 1908 the Underground Group, under Pick&#x27;s direction, used images of country scenes, shopping and major events on posters to encourage use of the tube. Pick found he was limited by the commercial artists the printers used, and so commissioned work from artists and designers such as Dora Batty, Edward McKnight Kauffer, the cartoonist George Morrow, Herry (Heather) Perry, Graham Sutherland, Charles Sharland and the sisters Anna and Doris Zinkeisen. According to Ruth Artmonsky, over 150 women artists were commissioned by Pick and latterly Christian Barman to design posters for London Underground, London Transport and London County Council Tramways.

The Johnston Sans letter font began appearing on posters from 1917. The Met, strongly independent, used images on timetables and on the cover of its &quot;Metro-land&quot; guide that promoted the country it served for the walker, visitor and later the house-hunter. By the time London Transport was formed in 1933 the UERL was considered a patron of the arts and over 1000 works were commissioned in the 1930s, such as the cartoon images of Charles Burton and Kauffer&#x27;s later abstract cubist and surrealist images. Harold Hutchison became London Transport publicity officer in 1947, after the Second World War and nationalisation, and introduced the &quot;pair poster&quot;, where an image on a poster was paired with text on another. Numbers of commissions dropped, to eight a year in the 1950s and just four a year in the 1970s, with images from artists such Harry Stevens and Tom Eckersley.
Art on the Underground was launched in 2000 to revive London Underground as a patron of the arts. Today, commissions range from the pocket Tube map cover, to temporary artworks, to large-scale permanent installations in stations. Major commissions by Art on the Underground in recent years have included &quot;Labyrinth&quot; by the Turner Prize–winning artist Mark Wallinger, to mark the 150th anniversary of the Underground; &quot;Diamonds and Circles&quot;, permanent works &quot;in situ&quot; by the French artist Daniel Buren at Tottenham Court Road; and &quot;Beauty &lt; Immortality&quot;, a memorial to Frank Pick by Langlands &amp; Bell at Piccadilly Circus.

Similarly, since 1986 Poems on the Underground has commissioned poetry that is displayed in trains.

===In popular culture===

The Underground (including several fictitious stations) has appeared in many movies and television shows, including &quot;Skyfall&quot;, &quot;Death Line&quot;, &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, &quot;Sliding Doors&quot;, &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;, &quot;Creep&quot;, &quot;Tube Tales, Sherlock&quot; and &quot;Neverwhere&quot;. The London Underground Film Office received over 200 requests to film in 2000. The Underground has also featured in music such as the Jam&#x27;s &quot;Down in the Tube Station at Midnight&quot; and in literature such as the graphic novel &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;. Popular legends about the Underground being haunted persist to this day. In 2016, British composer Daniel Liam Glyn released his concept album Changing Stations based on the 11 main tube lines of the London Underground network.

&quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3&quot; has a single-player level named &quot;Mind The Gap&quot; where most of the level takes place between the dockyards and Westminster while the player and a team of SAS attempt to take down terrorists attempting to escape using the London Underground via a hijacked train. The game also features the multiplayer map &quot;Underground&quot;, in which players are combating in a fictitious Underground station. The London Underground map serves as a playing field for the conceptual game of Mornington Crescent (which is named after a station on the Northern line) and the board game &quot;The London Game&quot;.

In 1999, Carlton Television premiered a regional game show (Greater London area only) also called &quot;Mind the Gap&quot;.

=== Busking ===
The London Underground provides busking permits for up to 39 pitches across 25 central London stations, with over 100,000 hours of live music performed each year. Performers are chosen by audition, with previous buskers including Ed Sheeran, George Michael and Rod Stewart.

== Research ==
The London Underground is frequently studied by academics because it is one of the largest, oldest, and most widely used systems of public transit in the world. Therefore, the transportation and complex network literatures include extensive information about the Tube system.

For London Underground passengers, research suggests that transfers are highly costly in terms of walk and wait times. Because these costs are unevenly distributed across stations and platforms, path choice analyses may be helpful in guiding upgrades and choice of new stations. Routes on the Underground can also be optimized using a global network optimization approach, akin to routing algorithms for Internet applications. Analysis of the Underground as a network may also be helpful for setting safety priorities, since the stations targeted in the 2005 London bombings were amongst the most effective for disrupting the transportation system.

A study in March 2023, showed that over £1.3million worth of mobile phones were stolen on the London Underground in 2022, more than the entire UK rail network combined.

<text>Lund University () is a public research university in Sweden and one of Northern Europe&#x27;s oldest universities. The university is located in the city of Lund in the Swedish province of Scania. It traces its roots back to 1425, when a Franciscan &quot;studium generale&quot; was founded in Lund. After Sweden won Scania from Denmark in the 1658 Treaty of Roskilde, the university was officially founded in 1666 on the location of the old &quot;studium generale&quot; next to Lund Cathedral.

Lund University has nine faculties, with additional campuses in the cities of Malmö and Helsingborg, with around 47,000 students in 241 different programmes and 1,450 freestanding courses. The university has 560 partner universities in approximately 70 countries. It belongs to the League of European Research Universities as well as the global Universitas 21 network. Among those associated with the university are five Nobel Prize winners, a Fields Medal winner, prime ministers and business leaders.

Two major facilities for materials research have been recent strategic priorities in Lund: MAX IV, a synchrotron radiation laboratory – inaugurated in June 2016, and European Spallation Source (ESS), a new European facility that will provide up to 100 times brighter neutron beams than existing facilities today, to be operational by the end of 2027.

The university centres on the Lundagård park adjacent to the Lund Cathedral, with various departments spread in different locations in town, but mostly concentrated in a belt stretching north from the park connecting to the university hospital area and continuing out to the northeastern periphery of the town, where one finds the large campus of the Faculty of Engineering.

== History ==
=== Medieval origins ===
The city of Lund has a long history as a centre for learning and was the ecclesiastical centre and seat of the archbishop of Denmark. A cathedral school (the &quot;Katedralskolan&quot;) for the training of clergy was established in 1085 and is today Scandinavia&#x27;s oldest school.

In 1425, a Franciscan &quot;studium generale&quot; (a medieval university) was founded in Lund next to the Lund Cathedral (with baccalaureate degree started in 1438), making it the oldest institution of higher education in Scandinavia followed by &quot;studia generalia&quot; in Uppsala in 1477 and Copenhagen in 1479. After Sweden won Scania from Denmark in the 1658 Treaty of Roskilde, the university was founded in 1666 on the location of the old &quot;studium generale&quot; next to Lund Cathedral. The &quot;studium generale&quot; had not survived the Lutheran Reformation of 1536, which is why the university is considered a separate institution when founded in 1666.

=== 17th–19th centuries ===
After the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, the Scanian lands came under the possession of the Swedish Crown, which founded the university in 1666 as a means of making Scania Swedish by educating teachers in Swedish and culturally integrate the Scania region with Sweden. The university was named &quot;Academia Carolina&quot; after Charles X Gustav of Sweden until the late 19th century when Lund University became the widespread denomination. It was the fifth university under the Swedish king, after Uppsala University (1477), the University of Tartu (1632, now in Estonia), the Academy of Åbo (1640, now in Finland), and the University of Greifswald (founded 1456; Swedish 1648–1815, now in Germany).

The university was at its founding granted four faculties: Law, Theological, Medicine and Philosophy. They were the cornerstones, and for more than 200 years this system was in effect. Towards the end of the 17th century, the number of students hovered around 100. Some notable professors in the early days were Samuel Pufendorf, a juridical historian; and Canutus Hahn and Kristian Papke in philosophy.

The Scanian War in 1676 led to a shut-down, which lasted until 1682. The university was re-opened largely due to regional patriots, but the university was not to enjoy a high status until well into the 19th century. Lecturing rooms were few, and lectures were held in the Lund Cathedral and its adjacent chapel. The professors were underpaid.
In 1716, Charles XII of Sweden entered Lund. He stayed in Lund for two years, in between his warlike expeditions. Lund and the university attracted a temporary attention boost. The most notable lecturer during this time was Andreas Rydelius.

Peace was finally restored with the death of Charles XII in 1718, and during the first half of the 18th century, the university was granted added funds. The number of students was now around 500. Despite not being on par with Uppsala University, it had built a solid reputation and managed to attract prominent professors.

Around 1760 the university&#x27;s reputation dropped as the number of students fell below 200, most of whom hailed from around the province. However, by 1780 its reputation was largely restored and continued to rise through the 1820s. This was largely owing to popular and well-educated lecturers particularly in philology; the prominent professor Esaias Tegnér was a particularly notable character with widespread authority. He, in turn, attracted others towards Lund. One of these was the young theological student C. G. Brunius, who studied ancient languages under Tegnér and was later to become a professor of Greek. With time he was to devote himself to architecture and he redesigned several of Lund&#x27;s buildings, as well as churches of the province.

In 1829, the murder at Locus Peccatorum occurred in the Locus Peccatorum residence at the university. Jacob Wilhelm Blomdahl, a theology student, beat his fellow student Anders Landén to death in the night. Blomdahl was later executed for the murder, and the controversy the murder created around the conditions of student life were a factor in the creation of Akademiska Föreningen in the 1830s.

In 1845 and 1862 Lund co-hosted Nordic student meetings together with the University of Copenhagen.

A student called Elsa Collin was the first woman in the whole of Sweden to take part in a spex (a student comedy show).

=== 20th century – present ===

In the early 20th century, the university had a student population as small as one thousand, consisting largely of upper-class pupils training to become civil servants, lawyers and doctors. In the coming decades, it started to grow significantly until it became one of the country&#x27;s largest. In 1964 the social sciences were split from the Faculty of Humanities. Lund Institute of Technology was established in 1961 but was merged with Lund University eight years later.

In recent years, Lund University has been very popular among applicants to Swedish higher education institutions, both nationally and internationally. For studies starting in autumn 2012, Lund received 11,160 foreign master&#x27;s applications from 152 countries, which was roughly one third of all international applications to Swedish universities.

===Women at the university===
The first woman to study in Lund was Hildegard Björck (spring of 1880) who had previously studied in Uppsala and had been the first Swedish woman ever to get an academic degree. Her tenure in Lund was however very brief and the medical student Hedda Andersson who entered the university later in 1880 (two years before the next woman to do so) is usually mentioned as the first woman at Lund University. Hilma Borelius was the first woman who finished a doctorate in Lund, in 1910. The first woman to be appointed to a professor&#x27;s chair was the historian Birgitta Odén in 1965, though Carin Boalt was made a professor at the Faculty of Engineering, which at the time was a separate institution, in 1964. In 1992 Boel Flodgren, Professor of Business Law, was appointed rector magnificus (or, strictly speaking, &quot;rectrix magnifica&quot;) of Lund University. As such, she was the first woman to be the head of a European university.

===Campus===

The university&#x27;s facilities are mainly located in the small city of Lund in Scania, about 15 km away from central Malmö and 50 km from Copenhagen. The large student and staff population makes an impact on the city, effectively making it a university town. Over a hundred university buildings scatter around town, most of them in an area covering more than 1 km2, stretching towards the north-east from Lundagård park in the very centre of town. Buildings in and around Lundagård include the main building, Kungshuset, the Historical Museum and the Academic Society&#x27;s headquarters. The main library building is located in a park 400 meters to the north, followed by the large hospital complex.

Lund University has a satellite campus in nearby Malmö, Sweden&#x27;s third-largest city. The Faculty of Fine and Performing Arts&#x27; three academies: Malmö Art Academy, Malmö Academy of Music and Malmö Theatre Academy, are all located in Malmö. The city is also the location of Skåne University Hospital, where Lund University performs a considerable amount of research and medical training.

Campus Helsingborg is, as the name suggests, located in the city of Helsingborg, almost 50 km from Lund. Opened in 2000, it consists of a building in the city center, right next to the central train station and the harbor. Nearly 3,000 students are based on the campus. The Department of Service Management and the Department of Communication and Media are among those located at the campus in Helsingborg.

Teaching and training at the School of Aviation (LUSA) take place at an airfield next to the town of Ljungbyhed, about 40 km away from Lund.

===Museums===

The Biological Museum is a research collection, not having public exhibitions. It possesses between 10 and 13 million specimens of plants and animals. The museum was founded by Kilian Stobaeus, a teacher of Carl Linnaeus, in 1735. It is divided into three sections: the herbarium, the entomological collections and the zoological collections. The collections are particularly rich in specimens from Sweden and the other Nordic countries, and hold approximately 10,000 type specimens The collections were previously known as the Botanical Museum and Museum of Zoology. These were merged into the Biological Museum in 2005. The museum is a part of the Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences. It holds the historically important collections of Johan Wilhelm Zetterstedt, Carl Gustaf Thomson, Carl Adolph Agardh, Anders Jahan Retzius, Erik Acharius, Axel Gustaf Gyllenkrok and Sven Nilsson.

=== Library ===

Lund University library was established in 1668 at the same time as the university and is one of Sweden&#x27;s oldest and largest libraries. Since 1698 it has received legal deposit copies of everything printed in the country. Today six Swedish libraries receive legal deposit copies, but only Lund and the Royal Library in Stockholm are required to keep everything for posterity. Swedish imprints make up half of the collections, which amount to 170,000 linear meters of shelving (2006). The library serves 620,000 loans per year, the staff is 200 full-time equivalents, and the 33 branch libraries house 2600 reading room desks.
The current main building at Helgonabacken, designed by architect Alfred Hellerström, opened in 1907. It was named Sweden&#x27;s most beautiful building in 2019.

== Student life ==

Lund student life is based on three central structures: the student nations, the Academic Society (AF) and the student unions. Until 1 July 2010, students were required to enroll in a student union, nation and AF in order to receive grades at the university, but this is no longer compulsory. Students may still enroll in these organizations if they wish.

=== Student nations ===

The nations in Lund are a central part of the university&#x27;s history, initially serving as residential colleges for students, organized by geographic origin. Östgöta Nation, the oldest nation, was established in 1668, two years after the university was founded. While the nations still offer limited housing, today they are best described as student societies.

Today students may enroll in any nation, although the nations still preserve their geographic names. In most cases, it does not matter what nation one enrolls in, but different nations offer different activities for interested students.

Each nation has student housing, but the accommodations in no way meet demand, and they are usually appointed according to a queue system. Most nations tend to have at least one pub evening per week, with a following night club. The solemn peak event in the course of an activity year is the organization of student balls once a year. Most well known of the nation balls (as opposed to balls organized by student unions) is the ball hosted by Göteborgs Nation - called the &quot;Gustaf II Adolf Ball&quot; (also known as the &quot;GA-Ball&quot;). Most nations also host at least one banquet per week, where a three-course dinner is served. Each nation also has different activities based on students&#x27; interests. All activities within the nations are run by volunteer workers.

=== The Academic Society ===
In 1830, Professor Carl Adolph Agardh formed &quot;Akademiska Föreningen&quot; (The Academic Society), commonly referred to as AF, with the goal of &quot;developing and cultivating the academic life&quot; by bringing students and faculty from all departments and student nations together in one organization. Prince Oscar, then Sweden&#x27;s Chancellor of Education, donated 2000 Kronor to help found the society. In 1848, construction began on &quot;AF-borgen&quot; (the AF Fortress), which is located opposite the Main Building in Lundagård. To this day, AF is the center of student life in Lund, featuring many theater companies, mainly spexes and Lund&#x27;s Student Theater, a prize-winning student radio (Radio AF), and organizing the enormous &quot;Lundakarnevalen&quot; (the Lund Carnival) every four years. &quot;AF Bostäder&quot;, an independent foundation with close ties to Akademiska Föreningen, maintains over 5,700 student residences in Lund.

=== Student unions ===

The student unions represent students in various decision-making boards within the university and counsel students regarding their rights, housing and career options. There are nine student unions, one for each faculty and an additional union for doctoral students. Lund&#x27;s Doctoral Student Union is further divided into councils, one for each faculty except for the faculties of engineering and fine and performing arts.

The unions are incorporated into the Association of Lund University Student Unions (LUS). It has two full-time representatives who go to weekly meetings with the vice-chancellor and other organizational university bodies. The student union association runs services such as a loan institute, a day-care center and a website with housing information. It also publishes the monthly Lundagård magazine.

<text>Lord Peter Death Bredon Wimsey (later 17th [[Duke of Denver]]) is the fictional protagonist in a series of detective novels and short stories by Dorothy L. Sayers (and their continuation by Jill Paton Walsh). A dilettante who solves mysteries for his own amusement, Wimsey is an archetype for the British gentleman detective. He is often assisted by his valet and former batman, Mervyn Bunter; by his good friend and later brother-in-law, police detective Charles Parker; and, in a few books, by Harriet Vane, who becomes his wife.

==Biography==

===Background===
Born in 1890 and ageing in real time, Wimsey is described as being of average height, with straw-coloured hair, a beaked nose, and a vaguely foolish face. Reputedly his looks are patterned after those of academic and poet Roy Ridley, whom Sayers briefly met after witnessing him read his Newdigate Prize-winning poem &quot;Oxford&quot; at the Encaenia ceremony in July 1913. 

Twice in the novels (in &quot;Murder Must Advertise&quot; and &quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot;) his looks are compared to those of the actor Ralph Lynn. Wimsey also possesses considerable intelligence and athletic ability, evidenced by his playing cricket for Oxford University while taking a First in history (referred to in &quot;Gaudy Night&quot;). He creates a spectacularly successful publicity campaign for Whifflet cigarettes while working for Pym&#x27;s Publicity Ltd, and at age 40 is able to turn three cartwheels in the office corridor, stopping just short of the boss&#x27;s open office door (&quot;Murder Must Advertise&quot;).

Among Lord Peter&#x27;s hobbies, in addition to criminology, is collecting incunabula, books from the earliest days of printing. He is an expert on matters of food (and especially wine), male fashion, and classical music. He excels at the piano, including Bach&#x27;s works for keyboard instruments. Lord Peter likes driving fast and keeps a powerful Daimler (for example, a 12-cylinder or &quot;double-six&quot; 1927 Daimler four-seater); he calls these cars &quot;Mrs Merdle&quot; after a character in Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; who &quot;hated fuss&quot;. In the eleventh novel, &quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot;, we are told he has owned nine Daimlers with this name. 

Lord Peter Wimsey&#x27;s ancestry begins with the 12th-century knight Gerald de Wimsey, who went with King Richard the Lionheart on the Third Crusade and took part in the Siege of Acre. This makes the Wimseys an unusually ancient family, since &quot;Very few English noble families go that far in the first creation; rebellions and monarchic head choppings had seen to that&quot;, as reviewer Janet Hitchman noted in the introduction to &quot;Striding Folly&quot;. The family coat of arms, first mentioned in &quot;Gaudy Night&quot;, is &quot;Sable, 3 mice courant, argent; crest, a domestic cat couched as to spring, proper&quot;. The family motto, displayed under its coat of arms, is &quot;As my Whimsy takes me.&quot;

===Early life===
Lord Peter is the second of the three children of Mortimer Wimsey, 15th Duke of Denver, and Honoria Lucasta Delagardie, who lives on throughout the novels as the Dowager Duchess of Denver. She is witty and intelligent, and strongly supports her younger son, whom she plainly prefers over her less intelligent, more conventional older son Gerald, the 16th Duke. Gerald&#x27;s snobbish wife, Helen, detests Peter. Gerald&#x27;s son and heir is the devil-may-care Viscount St George. Lady Mary, the younger sister of the 16th Duke, and of Lord Peter, leans strongly to the political left. At one time she planned to elope with a radical left agitator, and though this did not come about she did scandalise Helen by marrying a policeman of working-class origins.

Lord Peter Wimsey is called &quot;Lord&quot; as he is the younger son of a duke. This is a courtesy title; he is not a peer and has no right to sit in the House of Lords, nor does the courtesy title pass on to any offspring he may have.

As a boy, Peter was, to the great distress of his father, strongly attached to an old, smelly poacher living at the edge of the family estate. In his youth, Peter was influenced by his maternal uncle, Paul Delagardie, who took it upon himself to instruct his nephew in the facts of life – how to conduct various love affairs and treat his lovers. Lord Peter was educated at Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford, graduating with a first-class degree in history. He was also an outstanding cricketer, whose performance was still well remembered decades later. Though not taking up an academic career, he was left with an enduring and deep love for Oxford.

===Great War and aftermath===
To his uncle&#x27;s disappointment, Wimsey fell deeply in love with a young woman named Barbara and became engaged to her. When the First World War broke out, he hastened to join the British Army, releasing Barbara from her engagement in case he was killed or mutilated. The girl later married another, less principled officer.

Wimsey served on the Western Front from 1914 to 1918, reaching the rank of major in the Rifle Brigade. He was appointed an intelligence officer, and on one occasion he infiltrated the staff room of a German officer. Though not explicitly stated, that feat implies that Wimsey spoke a fluent and unaccented German. As noted in &quot;Have His Carcase&quot;, he communicated at that time with British Intelligence using the Playfair cipher and became proficient in its use.

For reasons never clarified, after the end of his spy mission, Wimsey in the later part of the war moved from Intelligence and resumed the role of a regular line officer. He was a conscientious and effective commanding officer, popular with the men under his command—an affection still retained by Wimsey&#x27;s former soldiers many years after the war, as is evident from a short passage in &quot;Clouds of Witness&quot; and an extensive reminiscence in &quot;Gaudy Night&quot;.

In particular, while in the army he met Sergeant Mervyn Bunter, who had previously been in domestic service. In 1918, Wimsey was wounded by artillery fire near Caudry in France. He suffered a breakdown due to shell shock (which we now call post-traumatic stress disorder but which was then often thought, by those without first-hand experience of it, to be a species of malingering) and was eventually sent home. While sharing this experience, which the Dowager Duchess referred to as &quot;a jam&quot;, Wimsey and Bunter arranged that if they were both to survive the war, Bunter would become Wimsey&#x27;s valet. Throughout the books, Bunter takes care to address Wimsey as &quot;My Lord&quot;. Nevertheless, he is a friend as well as a servant, and Wimsey again and again expresses amazement at Bunter&#x27;s high efficiency and competence in virtually every sphere of life.

After the war, Wimsey was ill for many months, recovering at the family&#x27;s ancestral home in Duke&#x27;s Denver, a fictional setting—as is the Dukedom of Denver—about 15 miles (24 km) beyond the real Denver in Norfolk, on the A10 near Downham Market. Wimsey was for a time unable to give servants any orders whatsoever, since his wartime experience made him associate the giving of an order with causing the death of the person to whom the order was given. Bunter arrived and, with the approval of the Dowager Duchess, took up his post as valet. Bunter moved Wimsey to a London flat at 110A Piccadilly, W1, while Wimsey recovered. Even much later, however, Wimsey would have relapses—especially when his actions caused a murderer to be hanged. As noted in &quot;Whose Body?&quot;, on such occasions Bunter would take care of Wimsey and tenderly put him to bed, and they would revert to being &quot;Major Wimsey&quot; and &quot;Sergeant Bunter&quot;.

In the reissue of &quot;The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club&quot; (1935), the biography of Wimsey is &quot;brought up to date&quot; by his uncle, Paul Austin Delagardie, purportedly at the request of Sayers herself, further giving the illusion that he is a real person. At this point, Wimsey is claimed to be 45 years old and &quot;time he was settled&quot;. The biography takes up the last eight pages of the book and concludes with the statement that Wimsey &quot;has always had everything except the things he really wanted, and I suppose he is luckier than most.&quot;

===Detective work===
Wimsey begins his hobby of investigation by recovering &quot;The Attenbury Emeralds&quot; in 1921. At the beginning of &quot;Whose Body?&quot;, there appears the unpleasant Inspector Sugg, who is extremely hostile to Wimsey and tries to exclude him from the investigation (reminiscent of the relations between Sherlock Holmes and Inspector Lestrade). However, Wimsey is able to bypass Sugg through his friendship with Scotland Yard detective Charles Parker, a sergeant in 1921. At the end of &quot;Whose Body?&quot;, Wimsey generously allows Sugg to take completely undeserved credit for the solution; the grateful Sugg cannot go on with his hostility to Wimsey. In later books, Sugg fades away and Wimsey&#x27;s relations with the police become dominated by his amicable partnership with Parker, who eventually rises to the rank of Commander (and becomes Wimsey&#x27;s brother-in-law).

Bunter, a man of many talents himself, not least photography, often proves instrumental in Wimsey&#x27;s investigations. However, Wimsey is not entirely well. At the end of the investigation in &quot;Whose Body?&quot; (1923), Wimsey hallucinates that he is back in the trenches. He soon recovers his senses and goes on a long holiday.

In &quot;Clouds of Witness&quot; (1926), Wimsey travels to the fictional Riddlesdale in North Yorkshire to assist his elder brother Gerald, who has been accused of murdering Captain Denis Cathcart, their sister&#x27;s fiancé. As Gerald is the Duke of Denver, he is tried by the entire House of Lords, as required by the law at that time, to much scandal and the distress of his wife Helen. Their sister, Lady Mary, also falls under suspicion. Lord Peter clears the Duke and Lady Mary, to whom Parker is attracted.

As a result of the slaughter of men in the First World War, there was in the UK a considerable imbalance between the sexes. It is not exactly known when Wimsey recruited Miss Climpson to run an undercover employment agency for women, a means to garner information from the otherwise inaccessible world of spinsters and widows, but it is prior to &quot;Unnatural Death&quot; (1927), in which Miss Climpson assists Wimsey&#x27;s investigation of the suspicious death of an elderly cancer patient. Wimsey&#x27;s highly effective idea is that a male detective going around and asking questions is likely to arouse suspicion, while a middle-aged woman doing it would be dismissed as a gossip and people would speak openly to her.

As recounted in the short story &quot;The Adventurous Exploit of the Cave of Ali Baba&quot;, in December 1927 Wimsey fakes his own death, supposedly while hunting big game in Tanganyika, to penetrate and break up a particularly dangerous and well-organised criminal gang. Only Wimsey&#x27;s mother and sister and the loyal Bunter know that he remains alive. Emerging victorious after more than a year masquerading as &quot;the disgruntled sacked servant Rogers&quot;, Wimsey remarks that &quot;We shall have an awful time with the lawyers, proving that I am me.&quot; In fact, he returns smoothly to his old life, and the interlude is never referred to in later books.

During the 1920s, Wimsey has affairs with various women, which are the subject of much gossip in Britain and Europe. This part of his life remains hazy: it is hardly ever mentioned in the books set in the same period; most of the scant information on the subject is given in flashbacks from later times, after he meets Harriet Vane and relations with other women become a closed chapter. In &quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot; Wimsey facetiously refers to a gentleman&#x27;s duty &quot;to remember whom he had taken to bed&quot; so as not to embarrass his bedmate by calling her by the wrong name.

There are several references to a relationship with a famous Viennese opera singer, and Bunter—who evidently was involved with this, as with other parts of his master&#x27;s life—recalls Wimsey being very angry with a French mistress who mistreated her own servant.

The only one of Wimsey&#x27;s earlier women to appear in person is the artist Marjorie Phelps, who plays an important role in &quot;The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club&quot;. She has known Wimsey for years and is attracted to him, though it is not explicitly stated whether they were lovers. Wimsey likes her, respects her, and enjoys her company—but that is not enough. In &quot;Strong Poison&quot;, she is the first person other than Wimsey himself to realise that he has fallen in love with Harriet.

Reviewer Barbara Stanton noted that &quot;Dorothy Sayers had created Peter Wimsey as a womanizer - though a rather gentlemanly and sensitive one. It would have been out of character for him to return Marjorie Phelps&#x27; love, and inevitable that he would break her heart - as he must have done to many other women before. But Sayers - a woman writer who had herself experienced disappointments and frustrations in relations with men - evidently decided to take revenge on her character and educate him. Sayers took the conscious decision to turn the tables on Wimsey and make him fall deeply in love with a woman who would make him sweat and wait very very long before she finally accepted him&quot;.

In &quot;Strong Poison&quot; Lord Peter encounters Harriet Vane, a cerebral, Oxford-educated mystery writer, while she is on trial for the murder of her former lover in December 1929. He falls in love with her at first sight. He saves Harriet from the gallows, but she believes that gratitude is not a good foundation for marriage, and politely but firmly declines his frequent proposals. Lord Peter encourages his friend and foil, Chief Inspector Charles Parker, to propose to his sister, Lady Mary Wimsey, despite the great difference in their rank and wealth. They marry and have a son, named Charles Peter (&quot;Peterkin&quot;), and a daughter, Mary Lucasta (&quot;Polly&quot;). Visiting the Fen country in Easter 1930 (in &quot;The Nine Tailors&quot;) Wimsey must unravel a 20-year-old case of missing jewels, an unknown corpse, a missing World War I soldier believed alive, a murderous escaped convict believed dead, and a mysterious code concerning church bells.

While on a fishing holiday in Scotland later in 1930, Wimsey takes part in the investigation of the murder of an artist, related in &quot;Five Red Herrings&quot;. Despite her rejection of his marriage proposals, he continues to court Miss Vane. In &quot;Have His Carcase&quot;, in 1931, he finds Harriet is not in London, but learns from a reporter that she has discovered a corpse while on a walking holiday on England&#x27;s south coast. Wimsey is at her hotel the next morning. He not only investigates the death and offers proposals of marriage, but also acts as Harriet&#x27;s patron and protector from press and police. Despite a prickly relationship, they work together to identify the murderer.

Back in London in 1932, Wimsey goes undercover as &quot;Death Bredon&quot; at an advertising firm, working as a copywriter (&quot;Murder Must Advertise&quot;). Bredon is framed for murder, leading Charles Parker to &quot;arrest&quot; Bredon for murder in front of numerous witnesses. To distinguish Death Bredon from Lord Peter Wimsey, Parker smuggles Wimsey out of the police station and urges him to get into the papers. Accordingly, Wimsey accompanies &quot;a Royal personage&quot; to a public event, leading the press to carry pictures of both &quot;Bredon&quot; and Wimsey.

By 1935 Lord Peter is in continental Europe, acting as an unofficial attaché to the British Foreign Office (at the time of writing, British diplomacy was much concerned with the impending Italian invasion of Ethiopia). Harriet Vane contacts him about a problem she has been asked to investigate in her college at Oxford (&quot;Gaudy Night&quot;). At the end of their investigation, Vane finally accepts Wimsey&#x27;s proposal of marriage.

The couple marry on 8 October 1935, at St Cross Church, Oxford, as depicted in the opening collection of letters and diary entries in &quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot;. The Wimseys honeymoon at Talboys, a house in east Hertfordshire near Harriet&#x27;s childhood home, which Peter has bought for her as a wedding present. There they find the body of the previous owner, and spend their honeymoon solving the case, thus having the aphoristic &quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot;.

Over the next five years, according to Sayers&#x27; short stories, the Wimseys have three sons: Bredon Delagardie Peter Wimsey (born in October 1936 in the story &quot;The Haunted Policeman&quot;); Roger Wimsey (born 1938), and Paul Wimsey (born 1940). However, according to the wartime publications of &quot;The Wimsey Papers&quot;, published in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, the second son was called Paul. In &quot;The Attenbury Emeralds&quot;, Paul is again the second son and Roger is the third son. In the subsequent &quot;The Late Scholar&quot;, Roger is not mentioned at all. It may be presumed that Paul is named after Lord Peter&#x27;s maternal uncle Paul Delagardie. &quot;Roger&quot; is an ancestral Wimsey name.

In Sayers&#x27;s final Wimsey story, the 1942 short story &quot;Talboys&quot;, Peter and Harriet are enjoying rural domestic bliss with their three sons when Bredon, their first-born, is accused of the theft of prize peaches from the neighbour&#x27;s tree. Peter and the accused set off to investigate and, of course, prove Bredon&#x27;s innocence.

==Fictional bibliophilia and bibliography==

Lord Peter has a noted collection of early editions of Dante: it includes, besides the famous Aldine octavo of 1502, the Naples incunabulum of 1477 sine typographo and the Florence incunabulum of 1481 printed by Niccolò di Lorenzo, which in &quot;Whose Body?&quot; Bunter bought for him at Sir Ralph Brocklebury&#x27;s auction sale.

Wimsey is described as having authored numerous books, among them the following fictitious works:
*&quot;Notes on the Collecting of Incunabula&quot;
*&quot;The Murderer&#x27;s Vade-Mecum&quot;

==The stories==
Dorothy Sayers wrote 11 Wimsey novels and a number of short stories featuring Wimsey and his family. Other recurring characters include Inspector Charles Parker, the family solicitor Mr Murbles, barrister Sir Impey Biggs, journalist Salcombe Hardy, and family friend and financial whiz the Honourable Freddy Arbuthnot, who finds himself entangled in the case in the first of the Wimsey books, &quot;Whose Body?&quot; (1923).

Sayers wrote no more Wimsey murder mysteries, and only one story involving him, after the outbreak of World War II. In &quot;The Wimsey Papers&quot;, a series of fictionalised commentaries in the form of mock letters between members of the Wimsey family published in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, there is a reference to Harriet&#x27;s difficulty in continuing to write murder mysteries at a time when European dictators were openly committing mass murders with impunity; this seems to have reflected Sayers&#x27; own wartime feeling.

&quot;The Wimsey Papers&quot; included a reference to Wimsey and Bunter setting out during the war on a secret mission of espionage in Europe, and provide the ironic epitaph Wimsey writes for himself: &quot;Here lies an anachronism in the vague expectation of eternity&quot;. The papers also incidentally show that in addition to his thorough knowledge of the classics of English literature, Wimsey is familiar — though in fundamental disagreement — with the works of Karl Marx, and well able to debate with Marxists on their home ground.

The only occasion when Sayers returned to Wimsey was the 1942 short story &quot;Talboys&quot;. The story is set in a quiet rural environment, the war at that time devastating Europe received only a single oblique reference, and the case Wimsey undertakes is just to clear his young son of the false accusation of stealing fruit from the neighbour&#x27;s tree. Though Sayers lived until 1957, she never again took up the Wimsey books after this final effort.

Jill Paton Walsh wrote about Wimsey&#x27;s career through and beyond the Second World War. In the continuations &quot;Thrones, Dominations&quot; (1998), &quot;A Presumption of Death&quot; (2002), &quot;The Attenbury Emeralds&quot; (2010), and &quot;The Late Scholar&quot; (2014), Harriet lives with the children at Talboys, Wimsey and Bunter have returned successfully from their secret mission in 1940, and his nephew Lord St. George is killed while serving as an RAF pilot in the Battle of Britain. Consequently, when Wimsey&#x27;s brother dies of a heart attack in 1951 during a fire in Bredon Hall, Wimsey becomes — very reluctantly — the Duke of Denver. Their Graces are then drawn into a mystery at a fictional Oxford college.

==Origins==
In &quot;How I Came to Invent the Character of Lord Peter Wimsey,&quot; Sayers wrote:

Janet Hitchman, in the preface to &quot;Striding Folly&quot;, remarks that &quot;Wimsey may have been the sad ghost of a wartime lover(...). Oxford, as everywhere in the country, was filled with bereaved women, but it may have been more noticeable in university towns where a whole year&#x27;s intake could be wiped out in France in less than an hour.&quot; There is, however, no verifiable evidence of any such World War I lover of Sayers on whom the character of Wimsey might be based.

Another theory is that Wimsey was based, at least in part, on Eric Whelpton, who was a close friend of Sayers at Oxford. Ian Carmichael, who played the part of Wimsey in the first BBC television adaptation and studied the character and the books thoroughly, said that the character was Sayers&#x27; conception of the &#x27;ideal man&#x27;, based in part on her earlier romantic misfortunes.

Another theory is that Wimsey was based, at least in part, on Philip Trent, created by E. C. Bentley in the novel &quot;Trent&#x27;s Last Case&quot;, a book which Sayers greatly admired.

==Social satire==
Many episodes in the Wimsey books express a mild satire on the British class system, in particular in depicting the relationship between Wimsey and Bunter. The two of them seem to be the best and closest of friends, yet Sayers states in the narration of &quot;The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club&quot; that Charles Parker is &quot;in some ways [Peter&#x27;s] only intimate friend.&quot; 

Bunter is invariably punctilious in using &quot;my lord&quot; even when they are alone, and &quot;his lordship&quot; in company. In a brief passage written from Bunter&#x27;s point of view in &quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot;, Bunter is seen, even in the privacy of his own mind, to think of his employer as &quot;His Lordship&quot;. However, in the first book, &quot;Whose Body?&quot;, when Wimsey experiences a severe First World War flashback, Bunter takes care of him and, once Wimsey is asleep, affectionately calls him a &quot;bloody little fool.&quot;

In &quot;The Vindictive Story of the Footsteps That Ran&quot;, the staunchly democratic Dr. Hartman invites Bunter to sit down to eat together with himself and Wimsey, at the doctor&#x27;s modest apartment. Wimsey does not object, but Bunter strongly does: &quot;If I may state my own preference, sir, it would be to wait upon you and his lordship in the usual manner&quot;. Whereupon Wimsey remarks: &quot;Bunter likes me to know my place&quot;.

At the conclusion of &quot;Strong Poison&quot;, Inspector Parker asks &quot;What would one naturally do if one found one&#x27;s water-bottle empty?&quot; (a point of crucial importance in solving the book&#x27;s mystery). Wimsey promptly answers, &quot;Ring the bell&quot;, whereupon Miss Murchison, the indefatigable investigator employed by Wimsey for much of this book, comments &quot;Or, if one wasn&#x27;t accustomed to be waited on, one might use the water from the bedroom jug.&quot;

George Orwell was highly critical of this aspect of the Wimsey books: &quot;... Even she [Sayers] is not so far removed from &quot;Peg&#x27;s Paper&quot; as might appear at a casual glance. It is, after all, a very ancient trick to write novels with a lord for a hero. Where Miss Sayers has shown more astuteness than most is in perceiving that you can carry that kind of thing off a great deal better if you pretend to treat it as a joke. By being, on the surface, a little ironical about Lord Peter Wimsey and his noble ancestors, she is enabled to lay on the snobbishness (&#x27;his lordship&#x27; etc.) much thicker than any overt snob would dare to do&quot;.

==Dramatic adaptations==
===Film===
In 1935, the British film &quot;The Silent Passenger&quot; was released, in which Lord Peter, played by well-known comic actor Peter Haddon, solved a mystery on the boat train crossing the English Channel. Sayers disliked the film and James Brabazon describes it as an &quot;oddity, in which Dorothy&#x27;s contribution was altered out of all recognition.&quot;

The novel &quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot; was originally a stage play by Sayers and her friend Muriel St. Clare Byrne. A 1940 film of &quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot; (US: &quot;The Haunted Honeymoon&quot;), stars Robert Montgomery and Constance Cummings as Lord and Lady Peter and Seymour Hicks as Bunter.

===Television===
A BBC television version of the play &quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot; with Harold Warrender as Lord Peter, was transmitted live on the BBC Television Service on 2 October 1947. A second live BBC version was broadcast on 3 October 1957, with Peter Gray as Wimsey.

Several other Lord Peter Wimsey novels were made into television productions by the BBC, in two separate series. Wimsey was played by Ian Carmichael, with Bunter being played by Glyn Houston (with Derek Newark stepping in for &quot;The Unpleasantness at The Bellona Club&quot;), in a series of separate serials under the umbrella title &quot;Lord Peter Wimsey&quot;, that ran between 1972 and 1975, adapting five novels (&quot;Clouds of Witness&quot;, &quot;The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club&quot;, &quot;Five Red Herrings&quot;, &quot;Murder Must Advertise&quot; and &quot;The Nine Tailors&quot;).

Edward Petherbridge played Lord Peter for BBC Television in 1987, in which three of the four major Wimsey/Vane novels (&quot;Strong Poison&quot;, &quot;Have His Carcase&quot; and &quot;Gaudy Night&quot;) were dramatised under the umbrella title &quot;A Dorothy L. Sayers Mystery&quot;. Harriet Vane was played by Harriet Walter and Bunter was played by Richard Morant. The BBC was unable to secure the rights to turn &quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot; into a proposed fourth and last part of the planned 13-episode series, so the series was produced as ten episodes. (Edward Petherbridge later played Wimsey in the UK production of the &quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot; play staged at the Lyric Hammersmith and on tour in 1988, with the role of Harriet being taken by his real-life spouse, Emily Richard.)

Both the 1970s productions and the 1987 series are now available on videotape and DVD.

===Radio===
Adaptations of the Lord Peter Wimsey novels appeared on BBC Radio from the 1930s onwards. An adaptation of the short story &quot;The Footsteps That Ran&quot; dramatised by John Cheatle appeared on the BBC Home Service in November 1939 with Cecil Trouncer as Wimsey. Rex Harrison took on the role in an adaptation of &quot;Absolutely Everywhere&quot; on the Home Service on 5 March 1940. The short story &quot;The Man with No Face&quot; was dramatised by Audrey Lucas for the Home Service &quot;Saturday-Night Theatre&quot; play, broadcast on 3 April 1943 with Robert Holmes in the lead role.

A four-part adaptation of &quot;The Nine Tailors&quot; adapted by Giles Cooper and starring Alan Wheatley as Wimsey was broadcast on the BBC Light Programme in August 1954.

Ian Carmichael reprised his television role as Lord Peter in ten radio adaptations for BBC Radio 4 of Sayers&#x27;s Wimsey novels between 1973 and 1983, all of which have been available on cassette and CD from the BBC Radio Collection. These co-starred Peter Jones as Bunter. In the original series no adaptation was made of the seminal &quot;Gaudy Night&quot;, perhaps because the leading character in this novel is Harriet and not Peter; this was corrected in 2005 when a version specially recorded for the BBC Radio Collection was released starring Carmichael and Joanna David. The CD also includes a panel discussion on the novel, the major participants in which are P. D. James and Jill Paton Walsh. &quot;Gaudy Night&quot; was released as an unabridged audio book read by Ian Carmichael in 1993.

Gary Bond starred as Lord Peter Wimsey and John Cater as Bunter in two single-episode BBC Radio 4 adaptations: &quot;The Nine Tailors&quot; on 25 December 1986 and &quot;Whose Body&quot; on 26 December 1987. Simon Russell Beale played Wimsey in an adaptation of &quot;Strong Poison&quot; dramatised by Michael Bakewell in 1999.

<text>A letter is a written message conveyed from one person (or group of people) to another through a medium. Something epistolary means that it is a form of letter writing. The term usually excludes written material intended to be read in its original form by large numbers of people, such as newspapers and placards, although even these may include material in the form of an &quot;open letter&quot;. The typical form of a letter for many centuries, and the archetypal concept even today, is a sheet (or several sheets) of paper that is sent to a correspondent through a postal system. A letter can be formal or informal, depending on its audience and purpose. Besides being a means of communication and a store of information, letter writing has played a role in the reproduction of writing as an art throughout history. Letters have been sent since antiquity and are mentioned in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. Historians Herodotus and Thucydides mention and use letters in their writings.

==History of letter writing==

Historically, letters have existed from ancient India, ancient Egypt and Sumer, through Rome, Greece and China, up to the present day. During the 17th and 18th centuries, letters were used to self-educate. The main purposes of letters were to send information, news and greetings. For some, letters were a way to practice critical reading, self-expressive writing, polemical writing and also exchange ideas with like-minded others. For some people, letters were seen as a written performance. Letters make up several of the books of the Bible. Archives of correspondence, whether for personal, diplomatic, or business reasons, serve as primary sources for historians. At certain times, the writing of letters was thought to be an art form and a genre of literature, for instance in Byzantine epistolography.

In the ancient world letters might be written on various different materials, including metal, lead, wax-coated wooden tablets, pottery fragments, animal skin, and papyrus. From Ovid, we learn that Acontius used an apple for his letter to Cydippe. More recently, letters have mainly been written on paper: handwritten and more recently typed. 

There is a wealth of letters and instructional materials (for example, manuals, as in the medieval ars dictaminis) on letter writing throughout history. The study of letter writing usually involves both the study of rhetoric and grammar.

Historians of the medieval period often study family letter collections, which gather the personal and business correspondence of a group of related people and shed light on their daily life. The Paston Letters (1425 – 1520 CE) are widely studied for insight into life in Britain during the Wars of the Roses. Other major medieval family letter collections include the Stonor Letters (1420 – 1483 CE), Plumpton letters (1416 – 1552 CE), and Cely Letters (1472-1488 CE).

Letters were a chief form of communication, in both personal and business communications, for many centuries before telegraphy, telephony, and Internet communications reduced their primacy. Even in times and places where literacy was lower, illiterate people could pay literate ones to write letters to, and to read letters from, distant correspondents. Even in the era of telegrams and telephones, letters remained quite important until fax and email further eroded their primacy, especially since the turn of the 21st century. As communication technology has developed in recent history, posted letters on paper have become less important as a routine form of communication. For example, the development of the telegraph drastically shortened the time taken to send a communication, by sending it between distant points as an electrical signal. At the telegraph office closest to the destination, the signal was converted back into writing on paper and delivered to the recipient. The next step was the telex which avoided the need for local delivery. Then followed the fax (facsimile) machine: a letter could be transferred from the sender to the receiver through the telephone network as an image. These technologies did not displace physical letters as the primary route for communication; however today, the Internet, by means of email, plays the main role in written communications, together with text messages; however, these email communications are not generally referred to as letters but rather as e-mail (or email) messages, messages or simply emails or e-mails, with the term &quot;letter&quot; generally being reserved for communications on paper.

== Letters as historical source material ==
Due to the timelessness and universality of letter writing, letters from earlier eras constitute an important category of source material in historiography (the methodology of historians).

Letters were often subject to state censorship and confiscation. Private letters preserved in state archives tell us not only what the author intended but also how the letter&#x27;s purported content was interpreted by state officials. In some cases, the confiscation of letters led to increased censorship like ban on correspondence and migration.

== Importance of letters in the 18th century ==
During the 18th century, called the &quot;Great Age of Letter Writing,&quot; the epistolary novel became a hugely popular genre and came from the format of letters. The novel also debuted in the 17th century with &quot;Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister&quot;. Letter writers used this to communicate and explore their identity and daily life at the time. As a medium of writing that lies ambiguously between the public and private worlds, letters provide an appealing peek into other people&#x27;s thoughts, feelings, and lives. During this historical period, publishing these &quot;private&quot; letters so they could build and preserve literary prominence became common for the first time. Just as social media streams now allow modern celebrities to present versions of their intimate lives for the public to see and read all about, so did early modern and 18th-century figures carefully build themselves in their letters for audiences to be excited to read these works of literature. In the 18th century, readers frequently associated personal letters with the ideals of honesty and truth. Writing in the 18th-century was a rough process that required a lot of materials, many of which were difficult or expensive to get. Researchers interested in the links and connections between migrants, settlers, and refugees have increasingly concentrated on letters and their purposes. Surprisingly, academics only began examining letters as artifacts in the late twentieth century; most studies continue to focus on the national course of epistolary novels.

Letters also offer information on changing conceptions of privacy, secrecy, and trust during a period of widespread censorship, especially in war. Lastly, study on letter writing and mail services culture exposes the economic and technical roots of letter writing, as well as how links required resources ranging from writing tables and ink to postal employees and ships to carry letters over the world. A lot of letters that were written in this time also showed up in a popular magazine called &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. People were also charged for postage during this time. They either had to pay before or during transit. Writers took great caution in their number of pages so they did not have to pay so much. These writers were considered very clever in their way to avoid the overcharge. Letter writing also became a really important pastime for some. Women were among these people to write letters and express themselves. A lot of female friendships were formed from women being encouraged to write letters. In fact, the most popular character who wrote in this period was named Clarissa Harlowe. This was also a chance for women to express their intelligence. They used letters also to separate themselves from their husbands and have their own voice to enter more into society. Even when the epistolary novel lost its popularity, people did not stop writing letters. It gave everyone a voice when they did not think they had one and it is incredibly important to people to have that, especially the women of this time.

Alexander Pope was the first English writer to publish from his own letters during his lifetime, putting out a new example for authors and other important people&#x27;s epistolary works. Pope recognized that writings may reflect both personal religious devotion and cleverness. Pope&#x27;s works are lacking in formality and informality. He had written his letters all about his life and what he did. Pope also wrote about his friends and the health and work of them. &quot;All the pleasure of using familiar letters is to give us the assurance of a friend&#x27;s welfare,&quot; Pope said. He had also taken to describing himself as &quot;a mortal enemy and despiser of what they call fine letters.&quot; There was a letter addressed to Pope&#x27;s father that ended up being used as writing paper for the &quot;Iliad&quot;. When Alexander Pope&#x27;s letters were published, they were widely read by a number of people.

==Comparison with electronic mail==


Despite email&#x27;s widespread use, letters are still popular, particularly in business and for official communications. At the same time, many &quot;letters&quot; are sent in electronic form. The following advantages of paper letters over e-mails and text messages are put forward:
*No special device is needed to receive a letter, just a postal address, and the letter can be read immediately on receipt.
*An e-mail may sit in a recipient&#x27;s inbox for some time before being read, or may not be read at all; a paper letter is more likely to receive prompt attention once it arrives.
*An advertising mailing can reach every address in a particular area.
*A letter provides an immediate, and in principle permanent, physical record of communication, without the need for printing. Letters, especially those with a signature and/or on an organization&#x27;s own notepaper, are more difficult to falsify than is an email, and thus provide much better evidence of the contents of the communication.
*A letter in the sender&#x27;s own handwriting is more personal than an e-mail and shows that the sender has taken the effort to write it.
*If required, small physical objects can be enclosed in the envelope with the letter.
*Letters are unable to transmit malware or other harmful files that can be transmitted by e-mail.
*E-mails are insecure and may be intercepted en route. For this reason, letters are often preferred for confidential correspondence.
*Letter writing leads to the mastery of the technique of good writing.
*Letter writing can provide an extension of the face-to-face therapeutic encounter.
*Since at least a small fee is required, sending a large number of irrelevant letters becomes more expensive (and therefore less likely) than e-mail (spam).

The following advantages are put forward for e-mails and text messages over traditional letters:
*They can be transmitted instantly.
*They can be sent to a number of recipients in one operation.
*They do not require a postage fee.
*They do not require materials such as paper and ink.
*Often an e-mail would require a less formal style than a letter to the same recipient, and thus may take less time to write. It is also easier to make amendments to a draft than it is with a handwritten letter.
*E-mails may be composed using spell checkers and other devices, and thus may conceal the ignorance (inability to spell or compose prose etc.) of the sender.
*During an epidemic, e-mails cannot transmit diseases.
*Emails do not take up physical space and cannot be damaged in a natural disaster.

==Delivery process==
Here is how a letter gets from the sender to the recipient:
# Sender composes and writes letter and may fold the letter so that it fits in an envelope. For bulk mailings, a folding machine may be employed.
# Sender places the letter in an envelope on which the recipient&#x27;s address is written on the front of the envelope, or often is visible through a transparent window of the envelope. Sender ensures that the recipient&#x27;s address includes the ZIP or Postal Code (if applicable) and historically often included their return address on the envelope.
# For small volume private letters, the sender buys a postage stamp and attaches it to the top right corner on the front of the envelope. (For most commercial letters, postage stamps are not used: a franking machine or other methods are used to pay for postage.)
# Sender puts the letter in a postbox.
# The national postal service of the sender&#x27;s country (e.g. Royal Mail, UK; USPS, United States; Australia Post in Australia; or Canada Post in Canada) empties the postbox and transports all the contents to the local sorting office.
# The sorting office then sorts each letter by address and postcode and sends the letters destined for a particular area to that area&#x27;s local sorting office (sometimes called a delivery office). Letters addressed to a different region may go through more than one stage of transmission and sorting.
# The local delivery personnel collect the letters from the delivery office and deliver them to the proper addresses. In some areas, recipients may need to collect the letters from the local office.

This process, depending on how far the sender is from the recipient, can take anywhere from a day to 3–4 weeks. International mail is sent via trains and airplanes to other countries.

In 2008, Janet Barrett in the UK received an RSVP to a party invitation addressed to &#x27;Percy Bateman&#x27;, from &#x27;Buffy&#x27;, allegedly originally posted on 29 November 1919. It had taken 89 years to be delivered by the Royal Mail. However, Royal Mail denied this, saying that it would be impossible for a letter to have remained in their system for so long, as checks are carried out regularly. Instead, the letter dated 1919 may have &quot;been a collector&#x27;s item which was being sent in another envelope and somehow came free of the outer packaging&quot;.

==Forms of letters==
The forms (conformations) of letters have usually followed traditional norms of the times and places where correspondence took place. Aspects such as where to place the elements (salutation, body of letter, valediction/closing, sender&#x27;s address, recipient&#x27;s address, date, and so on) were somewhat standardized albeit also usually flexible in practice. The form often varied by kind of letter. For any kind, though, factors of cost—such as that each sheet/leaf of paper cost money to buy and to post, and the fact of who paid for the posting (sender or recipient)—placed constraints on the forms of letters that varied from negligible in some times and places to crucial in others. These factors of cost drove norms on whether to write on both sides of the leaf, whether to cross the leaf with lines written in both directions (horizontally and vertically), whether to allow margins and how big or small to make them, how much to abbreviate to save space, and whether to have a separate envelope and thus how to fold the letter and where on the leaf to put the addresses. 

Business encyclopedias and textbooks of the 19th and 20th centuries show that businesspeople of those eras sometimes took the standardization of the forms of business letters to extremes. Typists were required to follow dozens or hundreds of rules about element placement and sizing, some of them with rather arbitrary and even counterproductive (wastefully expensive) strictness. However, the effort to standardize (on where to put the information and how to represent it) did have various valid motivations, as in some respects it presaged the concept of data normalization, helping with the extensive manual indexing, cataloguing, and filing that characterized the clerking duties of the era. 

Over the centuries, a lexicon of abbreviations, metonymic short forms, and conventional valedictions developed for frequent use in letters. For example, &quot;yours of the 12th &quot; meant &quot;your letter of the 12th of this month&quot;; &quot;do&quot; meant &quot;ditto&quot;; and forms like &quot;Yr Obdt Srvt&quot; for &quot;Your Obedient Servant&quot; were common.

==Kinds of letters==

There are a number of different types of letter:
==Security methods==
Cryptography (secret writing) sometimes played a role in letters in centuries past, as correspondents would use previously agreed code to try to shield the plaintext from the comprehension of prying eyes during the letter&#x27;s transit. This could be done in business letters to lessen spying by competitors on prices and methods and in personal letters to try to evade postal censorship (either of wartime censors or of peacetime authoritarian censors) or the gossip of townsfolk. It could be in either cryptic form (for example, &quot;AEDFX GHSTR HTFXV&quot;) or in deceptively readable form (for example, &quot;the dog will run at sunset unless the rains come&quot;). By the standards of modern digital applied cryptography, the security was often not especially high (that is, the codebreaking was not necessarily difficult), but it was usually high enough to meet the demands of the context (that is, the degree of risk, the likelihood or stakes of any codebreaking efforts, and the state of the codebreaking art in each era). 

Various forms or precursors of tamper-evident technology were developed over the centuries to enable the sending and receiving of letters whereby it would be evident to the recipient if anyone else had opened the letter before they received it. The principal class of these methods was sealing wax. Another method was to apply a small thin disc of adhesive material known as a wafer. A more elaborate class was letterlocking, including a type called spiral locking, which was especially relevant to government ministers, royal courts, judicial courts, and legislators. 

Envelopes are available in plain types as well as types with somewhat higher privacy protection in which a pattern of ink is printed on the inner side, making it more difficult for anyone trying to candle a sealed letter (that is, examine it translucently via ). Such envelopes are usually called privacy envelopes or security envelopes. Another sense of the term &quot;security envelope&quot; refers to security bags. 

Diplomatic mail pouch systems are special, small, closed postal systems run by each country&#x27;s ministry of foreign affairs or department of state. A general theme of the diplomatic mail pouch is that outsiders never have physical access to it during the entire chain of custody; it never gets sent off out of sight of authorized persons, which would otherwise be the weak link in the chain where intelligence agencies could surreptitiously examine it in non-evident ways. The mail pouch itself in a diplomatic mail pouch system is often a security bag instead of merely any cloth pouch or sack.

<text>A lesbian is a homosexual woman or girl. The word is also used for women in relation to their sexual identity or sexual behavior, regardless of sexual orientation, or as an adjective to characterize or associate nouns with female homosexuality or same-sex attraction. The concept of &quot;lesbian&quot; to differentiate women with a shared sexual orientation evolved in the 20th century. Throughout history, women have not had the same freedom or independence as men to pursue homosexual relationships, but neither have they met the same harsh punishment as gay men in some societies. Instead, lesbian relationships have often been regarded as harmless, unless a participant attempts to assert privileges traditionally enjoyed by men. As a result, little in history was documented to give an accurate description of how female homosexuality was expressed. When early sexologists in the late 19th century began to categorize and describe homosexual behavior, hampered by a lack of knowledge about homosexuality or women&#x27;s sexuality, they distinguished lesbians as women who did not adhere to female gender roles. They classified them as mentally ill—a designation which has been reversed since the late 20th century in the global scientific community.

Women in homosexual relationships in Europe and the United States responded to the discrimination and repression either by hiding their personal lives, or accepting the label of outcast and creating a subculture and identity. Following World War II, during a period of social repression when governments actively persecuted homosexuals, women developed networks to socialize with and educate each other. Gaining greater economic and social freedom allowed them to determine how they could form relationships and families. With second-wave feminism and the growth of scholarship in women&#x27;s history and sexuality in the late 20th century, the definition of &quot;lesbian&quot; broadened, leading to debate about the term&#x27;s use. While research by Lisa M. Diamond identified sexual desire as the core component for defining lesbians, some women who engage in same-sex sexual activity may reject not only identifying as lesbians but as bisexual as well. Other women&#x27;s self-identification as lesbian may not align with their sexual orientation or sexual behavior. Sexual identity is not necessarily the same as one&#x27;s sexual orientation or sexual behavior, due to various reasons, such as the fear of identifying their sexual orientation in a homophobic setting.

Portrayals of lesbians in the media suggest that society at large has been simultaneously intrigued and threatened by women who challenge feminine gender roles, as well as fascinated and appalled with women who are romantically involved with other women. Women who adopt a lesbian identity share experiences that form an outlook similar to an ethnic identity: as homosexuals, they are unified by the heterosexist discrimination and potential rejection they face from their families, friends, and others as a result of homophobia. As women, they face concerns separate from men. Lesbians may encounter distinct physical or mental health concerns arising from discrimination, prejudice, and minority stress. Political conditions and social attitudes also affect the formation of lesbian relationships and families in the open.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;lesbian&quot; is the demonym of the Greek island of Lesbos, home to the 6th-century BCE poet Sappho. From various ancient writings, historians gathered that a group of young women were left in Sappho&#x27;s charge for their instruction or cultural edification. Little of Sappho&#x27;s poetry survives, but her remaining poetry reflects the topics she wrote about: women&#x27;s daily lives, their relationships, and rituals. She focused on the beauty of women and proclaimed her love for girls. Before the mid-19th century, the word &quot;lesbian&quot; referred to any derivative or aspect of Lesbos, including a type of wine.

In Algernon Charles Swinburne&#x27;s 1866 poem &quot;Sapphics&quot;, the term &quot;lesbian&quot; appears twice but capitalized both times after twice mentioning the island of Lesbos, and so could be construed to mean . In 1875, George Saintsbury, in writing about Baudelaire&#x27;s poetry, refers to his &quot;Lesbian studies&quot; in which he includes his poem about &quot;the passion of Delphine&quot; which is a poem simply about love between two women which does not mention the island of Lesbos, though the other poem alluded to, entitled &quot;Lesbos&quot;, does. Use of the word &quot;lesbianism&quot; to describe erotic relationships between women had been documented in 1870. In 1890, the term &quot;lesbian&quot; was used in a medical dictionary as an adjective to describe tribadism (as &quot;lesbian love&quot;). The terms &quot;lesbian&quot;, &quot;invert&quot; and &quot;homosexual&quot; were interchangeable with &quot;sapphist&quot; and &quot;sapphism&quot; around the turn of the 20th century. The use of &quot;lesbian&quot; in medical literature became prominent; by 1925, the word was recorded as a noun to mean the female equivalent of a sodomite.

The development of medical knowledge was a significant factor in further connotations of the term &quot;lesbian.&quot; In the middle of the 19th century, medical writers attempted to establish ways to identify male homosexuality, which was considered a significant social problem in most Western societies. In categorizing behavior that indicated what was referred to as &quot;inversion&quot; by German sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld, researchers categorized what was normal sexual behavior for men and women, and therefore to what extent men and women varied from the &quot;perfect male sexual type&quot; and the &quot;perfect female sexual type&quot;.

Far less literature focused on female homosexual behavior than on male homosexuality, as medical professionals did not consider it a significant problem. In some cases, it was not acknowledged to exist. Sexologists Richard von Krafft-Ebing from Germany and Britain&#x27;s Havelock Ellis wrote some of the earliest and more enduring categorizations of female same-sex attraction, approaching it as a form of insanity (Ellis&#x27; categorization of &quot;lesbianism&quot; as a medical problem is now discredited). Krafft-Ebing, who considered lesbianism a neurological disease, and Ellis, who was influenced by Krafft-Ebing&#x27;s writings, disagreed about whether sexual inversion was generally a lifelong condition. Ellis believed that many women who professed love for other women changed their feelings about such relationships after they had experienced marriage and a &quot;practical life&quot;.

Ellis conceded that there were &quot;true inverts&quot; who would spend their lives pursuing erotic relationships with women. These were members of the &quot;third sex&quot; who rejected the roles of women to be subservient, feminine, and domestic. &quot;Invert&quot; described the opposite gender roles, and also the related attraction to women instead of men; since women in the Victorian period were considered unable to initiate sexual encounters, women who did so with other women were thought of as possessing masculine sexual desires.

The work of Krafft-Ebing and Ellis was widely read and helped to create public consciousness of female homosexuality. The sexologists&#x27; claims that homosexuality was a congenital anomaly were generally well-accepted by homosexual men; it indicated that their behavior was not inspired by nor should be considered a criminal vice, as was widely acknowledged. In the absence of any other material to describe their emotions, homosexuals accepted the designation of different or perverted, and used their outlaw status to form social circles in Paris and Berlin. &quot;Lesbian&quot; began to describe elements of a subculture.

Lesbians in Western cultures in particular often classify themselves as having an identity that defines their individual sexuality, as well as their membership to a group that shares common traits. Women in many cultures throughout history have had sexual relations with other women, but they rarely were designated as part of a group of people based on whom they had physical relations with. As women have generally been political minorities in Western cultures, the added medical designation of homosexuality has been cause for the development of a subcultural identity.

=== Sexuality and identity ===


The notion that sexual activity between women is necessary to define a lesbian or lesbian relationship continues to be debated. According to feminist writer Naomi McCormick, women&#x27;s sexuality is constructed by men, whose primary indicator of lesbian sexual orientation is sexual experience with other women. The same indicator is not necessary to identify a woman as heterosexual. McCormick states that emotional, mental, and ideological connections between women are as important or more so than the genital. Nonetheless, in the 1980s, a significant movement rejected the desexualization of lesbianism by cultural feminists, causing a heated controversy called the feminist sex wars. Butch and femme roles returned, although not as strictly followed as they were in the 1950s. They became a mode of chosen sexual self-expression for some women in the 1990s. Once again, women felt safer claiming to be more sexually adventurous, and sexual flexibility became more accepted.

The focus of the debate often centers on a phenomenon named by sexologist Pepper Schwartz in 1983. Schwartz found that long-term lesbian couples report having less sexual contact than heterosexual or homosexual male couples, calling this lesbian bed death. Some lesbians dispute the study&#x27;s definition of sexual contact, and introduced other factors such as deeper connections existing between women that make frequent sexual relations redundant, greater sexual fluidity in women causing them to move from heterosexual to bisexual to lesbian numerous times through their lives—or reject the labels entirely. Further arguments attested that the study was flawed and misrepresented accurate sexual contact between women, or sexual contact between women has increased since 1983 as many lesbians find themselves freer to sexually express themselves.

More discussion on gender and sexual orientation identity has affected how many women label or view themselves. Most people in western culture are taught that heterosexuality is an innate quality in all people. When a woman realizes her romantic and sexual attraction to another woman, it may cause an &quot;existential crisis&quot;; many who go through this adopt the identity of a lesbian, challenging what society has offered in stereotypes about homosexuals, to learn how to function within a homosexual subculture. Lesbians in western cultures generally share an identity that parallels those built on ethnicity; they have a shared history and subculture, and similar experiences with discrimination which has caused many lesbians to reject heterosexual principles. This identity is unique from gay men and heterosexual women, and often creates tension with bisexual women. One point of contention are lesbians who have had sex with men, while lesbians who have never had sex with men may be referred to as &quot;gold star lesbians&quot;. Those who have had sex with men may face ridicule from other lesbians or identity challenges with regard to defining what it means to be a lesbian.

Researchers, including social scientists, state that often behavior and identity do not match: women may label themselves heterosexual but have sexual relations with women, self-identified lesbians may have sex with men, or women may find that what they considered an immutable sexual identity has changed over time. Research by Lisa M. Diamond et al. reported that &quot;lesbian and fluid women were more exclusive than bisexual women in their sexual behaviors&quot; and that &quot;lesbian women appeared to lean toward exclusively same-sex attractions and behaviors.&quot; It reported that lesbians &quot;appeared to demonstrate a &#x27;core&#x27; lesbian orientation.&quot;

A 2001 article on differentiating lesbians for medical studies and health research suggested identifying lesbians using the three characteristics of identity only, sexual behavior only, or both combined. The article declined to include desire or attraction as it rarely has bearing on measurable health or psychosocial issues. Researchers state that there is no standard definition of &quot;lesbian&quot; because &quot;The term has been used to describe women who have sex with women, either exclusively or in addition to sex with men (i.e., &quot;behavior&quot;); women who self-identify as lesbian (i.e., &quot;identity&quot;); and women whose sexual preference is for women (i.e., &quot;desire&quot; or &quot;attraction&quot;)&quot; ... &quot;The lack of a standard definition of lesbian and of standard questions to assess who is lesbian has made it difficult to clearly define a population of lesbian women.&quot; How and where study samples were obtained can also affect the definition.

== Female homosexuality without identity in western culture ==
The varied meanings of &quot;lesbian&quot; since the early 20th century have prompted some historians to revisit historic relationships between women before the wide usage of the word was defined by erotic proclivities. Discussion from historians caused further questioning of what qualifies as a lesbian relationship. As lesbian-feminists asserted, a sexual component was unnecessary in declaring oneself a lesbian if the primary and closest relationships were with women. When considering past relationships within appropriate historic context, there were times when love and sex were separate and unrelated notions. In 1989, an academic cohort named the Lesbian History Group wrote: Because of society&#x27;s reluctance to admit that lesbians exist, a high degree of certainty is expected before historians or biographers are allowed to use the label. Evidence that would suffice in any other situation is inadequate here... A woman who never married, who lived with another woman, whose friends were mostly women, or who moved in known lesbian or mixed gay circles, may well have been a lesbian. ... But this sort of evidence is not &#x27;proof&#x27;. What our critics want is incontrovertible evidence of sexual activity between women. This is almost impossible to find.

Female sexuality is often not adequately represented in texts and documents. Until very recently, much of what has been documented about women&#x27;s sexuality has been written by men, in the context of male understanding, and relevant to women&#x27;s associations to men—as their wives, daughters, or mothers, for example. Often artistic representations of female sexuality suggest trends or ideas on broad scales, giving historians clues as to how widespread or accepted erotic relationships between women were.

=== Ancient Greece and Rome ===
Women in ancient Greece were sequestered with one another, and men were segregated likewise. In this homosocial environment, erotic and sexual relationships between males were common and recorded in literature, art, and philosophy. Very little was recorded about homosexual activity between Greek women. There is some speculation that similar relationships existed between women and girls — the poet Alcman used the term &quot;aitis,&quot; as the feminine form of &quot;aites&quot; — which was the official term for the younger participant in a pederastic relationship. Aristophanes, in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;, mentions women who are romantically attracted to other women, but uses the term &quot;trepesthai&quot; (to be focused on) instead of &quot;eros&quot;, which was applied to other erotic relationships between men, and between men and women.

Historian Nancy Rabinowitz argues that ancient Greek red vase images which portray women with their arms around another woman&#x27;s waist, or leaning on a woman&#x27;s shoulders can be construed as expressions of romantic desire. Much of the daily lives of women in ancient Greece is unknown, in particular their expressions of sexuality. Although men participated in pederastic relationships outside marriage, there is no clear evidence that women were allowed or encouraged to have same-sex relationships before or during marriage as long as their marital obligations were met. Women who appear on Greek pottery are depicted with affection, and in instances where women appear only with other women, their images are eroticized: bathing, touching one another, with dildos placed in and around such scenes, and sometimes with imagery also seen in depictions of heterosexual marriage or pederastic seduction. Whether this eroticism is for the viewer or an accurate representation of life is unknown. Rabinowitz writes that the lack of interest from 19th-century historians who specialized in Greek studies regarding the daily lives and sexual inclinations of women in Greece was due to their social priorities. She postulates that this lack of interest led the field to become over male-centric and was partially responsible for the limited information available on female topics in ancient Greece.

Women in ancient Rome were similarly subject to men&#x27;s definitions of sexuality. Modern scholarship indicates that men viewed female homosexuality with hostility. They considered women who engaged in sexual relations with other women to be biological oddities that would attempt to penetrate women—and sometimes men—with &quot;monstrously enlarged&quot; clitorises. According to scholar James Butrica, lesbianism &quot;challenged not only the Roman male&#x27;s view of himself as the exclusive giver of sexual pleasure but also the most basic foundations of Rome&#x27;s male-dominated culture&quot;. No historical documentation exists of women who had other women as sex partners.

=== Early modern Europe ===
Female homosexuality did not receive the same negative response from religious or criminal authorities as male homosexuality or adultery did throughout history. Whereas sodomy between men, men and women, and men and animals was punishable by death in England, acknowledgment of sexual contact between women was nonexistent in medical and legal texts. The earliest law against female homosexuality appeared in France in 1270. In Spain, Italy, and the Holy Roman Empire, sodomy between women was included in acts considered unnatural and punishable by burning to death, although few instances are recorded of this taking place.

The earliest such execution occurred in Speier, Germany, in 1477. Forty days&#x27; penance was demanded of nuns who &quot;rode&quot; each other or were discovered to have touched each other&#x27;s breasts. An Italian nun named Sister Benedetta Carlini was documented to have seduced many of her sisters when possessed by a Divine spirit named &quot;Splenditello&quot;; to end her relationships with other women, she was placed in solitary confinement for the last 40 years of her life. Female homoeroticism was so common in English literature and theater that historians suggest it was fashionable for a period during the Renaissance. Englishwoman Mary Frith has been described as lesbian in academic study.

Ideas about women&#x27;s sexuality were linked to contemporary understanding of female physiology. The vagina was considered an inward version of the penis; where nature&#x27;s perfection created a man, often nature was thought to be trying to right itself by prolapsing the vagina to form a penis in some women. These sex changes were later thought to be cases of hermaphrodites, and hermaphroditism became synonymous with female same-sex desire. Medical consideration of hermaphroditism depended upon measurements of the clitoris; a longer, engorged clitoris was thought to be used by women to penetrate other women. Penetration was the focus of concern in all sexual acts, and a woman who was thought to have uncontrollable desires because of her engorged clitoris was called a &quot;tribade&quot; (literally, one who rubs). Not only was an abnormally engorged clitoris thought to create lusts in some women that led them to masturbate, but pamphlets warning women about masturbation leading to such oversized organs were written as cautionary tales. For a while, masturbation and lesbian sex carried the same meaning.

Class distinction became linked as the fashion of female homoeroticism passed. Tribades were simultaneously considered members of the lower class trying to ruin virtuous women, and representatives of an aristocracy corrupt with debauchery. Satirical writers began to suggest that political rivals (or more often, their wives) engaged in tribadism in order to harm their reputations. Queen Anne was rumored to have a passionate relationship with Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, her closest adviser and confidante. When Churchill was ousted as the queen&#x27;s favorite, she purportedly spread allegations of the queen having affairs with her bedchamberwomen. Marie Antoinette was also the subject of such speculation for some months between 1795 and 1796.

=== Female husbands ===
Hermaphroditism appeared in medical literature enough to be considered common knowledge, although cases were rare. Homoerotic elements in literature were pervasive, specifically the masquerade of one gender for another to fool an unsuspecting woman into being seduced. Such plot devices were used in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; (1601), &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; by Edmund Spenser in 1590, and James Shirley&#x27;s &quot;The Bird in a Cage&quot; (1633). Cases during the Renaissance of women taking on male personae and going undetected for years or decades have been recorded, though whether these cases would be described as transvestism by homosexual women, or in contemporary sociology characterised as transgender, is debated and depends on the individual details of each case.

If discovered, punishments ranged from death, to time in the pillory, to being ordered never to dress as a man again. Henry Fielding wrote a pamphlet titled &quot;The Female Husband&quot; in 1746, based on the life of Mary Hamilton, who was arrested after marrying a woman while masquerading as a man, and was sentenced to public whipping and six months in jail. Similar examples were procured of Catharine Linck in Prussia in 1717, executed in 1721; Swiss Anne Grandjean married and relocated with her wife to Lyons, but was exposed by a woman with whom she had had a previous affair and sentenced to time in the stocks and prison.

Queen Christina of Sweden&#x27;s tendency to dress as a man was well known during her time and excused because of her noble birth. She was brought up as a male and there was speculation at the time that she was a hermaphrodite. Even after Christina abdicated the throne in 1654 to avoid marriage, she was known to pursue romantic relationships with women.

Some historians view cases of cross-dressing women to be manifestations of women seizing power they would naturally be unable to enjoy in feminine attire, or their way of making sense out of their desire for women. Lillian Faderman argues that Western society was threatened by women who rejected their feminine roles. Catharine Linck and other women who were accused of using dildos, such as two nuns in 16th century Spain executed for using &quot;material instruments&quot;, were punished more severely than those who did not. Two marriages between women were recorded in Cheshire, England, in 1707 (between Hannah Wright and Anne Gaskill) and 1708 (between Ane Norton and Alice Pickford) with no comment about both parties being female. Reports of clergymen with lax standards who performed weddings—and wrote their suspicions about one member of the wedding party—continued to appear for the next century.

Outside Europe, women were able to dress as men and go undetected. Deborah Sampson fought in the American Revolution under the name Robert Shurtlieff, and pursued relationships with women. Edward De Lacy Evans was born female in Ireland, but took a male name during the voyage to Australia and lived as a man for 23 years in Victoria, marrying three times. Percy Redwood created a scandal in New Zealand in 1909 when she was found to be Amy Bock, who had married a woman from Port Molyneaux; newspapers argued whether it was a sign of insanity or an inherent character flaw.

=== Re-examining romantic friendships ===
During the 17th through 19th centuries, a woman expressing passionate love for another woman was fashionable, accepted, and encouraged. These relationships were termed romantic friendships, Boston marriages, or &quot;sentimental friends&quot;, and were common in the U.S., Europe, and especially in England. Documentation of these relationships is possible by a large volume of letters written between women. Whether the relationship included any genital component was not a matter for public discourse, but women could form strong and exclusive bonds with each other and still be considered virtuous, innocent, and chaste; a similar relationship with a man would have destroyed a woman&#x27;s reputation. In fact, these relationships were promoted as alternatives to and practice for a woman&#x27;s marriage to a man.

One such relationship was between Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who wrote to Anne Wortley in 1709: &quot;Nobody was so entirely, so faithfully yours ... I put in your lovers, for I don&#x27;t allow it possible for a man to be so sincere as I am.&quot; Similarly, English poet Anna Seward had a devoted friendship to Honora Sneyd, who was the subject of many of Seward&#x27;s sonnets and poems. When Sneyd married despite Seward&#x27;s protest, Seward&#x27;s poems became angry. Seward continued to write about Sneyd long after her death, extolling Sneyd&#x27;s beauty and their affection and friendship. As a young woman, writer and philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft was attached to a woman named Fanny Blood. Writing to another woman by whom she had recently felt betrayed, Wollstonecraft declared, &quot;The roses will bloom when there&#x27;s peace in the breast, and the prospect of living with my Fanny gladdens my heart:—You know not how I love her.&quot;

Perhaps the most famous of these romantic friendships was between Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby, nicknamed the Ladies of Llangollen. Butler and Ponsonby eloped in 1778, to the relief of Ponsonby&#x27;s family (concerned about their reputation had she run away with a man) to live together in Wales for 51 years and be thought of as eccentrics. Their story was considered &quot;the epitome of virtuous romantic friendship&quot; and inspired poetry by Anna Seward and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Diarist Anne Lister, captivated by Butler and Ponsonby, recorded her affairs with women between 1817 and 1840. Some of it was written in code, detailing her sexual relationships with Marianna Belcombe and Maria Barlow. Both Lister and Eleanor Butler were considered masculine by contemporary news reports, and though there were suspicions that these relationships were sapphist in nature, they were nonetheless praised in literature.

Romantic friendships were also popular in the U.S. Enigmatic poet Emily Dickinson wrote over 300 letters and poems to Susan Gilbert, who later became her sister-in-law, and engaged in another romantic correspondence with Kate Scott Anthon. Anthon broke off their relationship the same month Dickinson entered self-imposed lifelong seclusion. Nearby in Hartford, Connecticut, African American freeborn women Addie Brown and Rebecca Primus left evidence of their passion in letters: &quot;No &quot;kisses&quot; is like youres&quot;. In Georgia, Alice Baldy wrote to Josie Varner in 1870, &quot;Do you know that if you touch me, or speak to me there is not a nerve of fibre in my body that does not respond with a thrill of delight?&quot;

Around the turn of the 20th century, the development of higher education provided opportunities for women. In all-female surroundings, a culture of romantic pursuit was fostered in women&#x27;s colleges. Older students mentored younger ones, called on them socially, took them to all-women dances, and sent them flowers, cards, and poems that declared their undying love for each other. These were called &quot;smashes&quot; or &quot;spoons&quot;, and they were written about quite frankly in stories for girls aspiring to attend college in publications such as &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot;, a children&#x27;s magazine titled &quot;St. Nicholas&quot;, and a collection called &quot;Smith College Stories&quot;, without negative views. Enduring loyalty, devotion, and love were major components to these stories, and sexual acts beyond kissing were consistently absent.

Women who had the option of a career instead of marriage labeled themselves New Women and took their new opportunities very seriously. Faderman calls this period &quot;the last breath of innocence&quot; before 1920 when characterizations of female affection were connected to sexuality, marking lesbians as a unique and often unflatteringly portrayed group. Specifically, Faderman connects the growth of women&#x27;s independence and their beginning to reject strictly prescribed roles in the Victorian era to the scientific designation of lesbianism as a type of aberrant sexual behavior.

== Identity and gender role in western culture ==
=== Construction ===
For some women, the realization that they participated in behavior or relationships that could be categorized as lesbian caused them to deny or conceal it, such as professor Jeannette Augustus Marks at Mount Holyoke College, who lived with the college president, Mary Woolley, for 36 years. Marks discouraged young women from &quot;abnormal&quot; friendships and insisted happiness could only be attained with a man. Other women embraced the distinction and used their uniqueness to set themselves apart from heterosexual women and gay men.

From the 1890s to the 1930s, American heiress Natalie Clifford Barney held a weekly salon in Paris to which major artistic celebrities were invited and where lesbian topics were the focus. Combining Greek influences with contemporary French eroticism, she attempted to create an updated and idealized version of Lesbos in her salon. Her contemporaries included artist Romaine Brooks, who painted others in her circle; writers Colette, Djuna Barnes, social host Gertrude Stein, and novelist Radclyffe Hall.

Berlin had a vibrant homosexual culture in the 1920s, and about 50 clubs catered to lesbians. (&quot;The Girlfriend&quot;) magazine, published between 1924 and 1933, targeted lesbians. &quot;Garçonne&quot; (aka (&quot;Woman Love&quot;)) was aimed at lesbians and male transvestites. These publications were controlled by men as owners, publishers, and writers. Around 1926, Selli Engler founded &quot;Die BIF – Blätter Idealer Frauenfreundschaften&quot; (&quot;The BIF – Papers on Ideal Women Friendships&quot;), the first lesbian publication owned, published and written by women. In 1928, the lesbian bar and nightclub guide &quot;Berlins lesbische Frauen&quot; (&quot;The Lesbians of Berlin&quot;) by Ruth Margarite Röllig further popularized the German capital as a center of lesbian activity. Clubs varied between large establishments that became tourist attractions, to small neighborhood cafes where local women went to meet other women. The cabaret song (&quot;The Lavender Song&quot;) became an anthem to the lesbians of Berlin. Although it was sometimes tolerated, homosexuality was illegal in Germany and law enforcement used permitted gatherings as an opportunity to register the names of homosexuals for future reference. Magnus Hirschfeld&#x27;s Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, which promoted tolerance for homosexuals in Germany, welcomed lesbian participation, and a surge of lesbian-themed writing and political activism in the German feminist movement became evident.

In 1928, Radclyffe Hall published a novel titled &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot;. The novel&#x27;s plot centers around Stephen Gordon, a woman who identifies herself as an invert after reading Krafft-Ebing&#x27;s &quot;Psychopathia Sexualis&quot;, and lives within the homosexual subculture of Paris. The novel included a foreword by Havelock Ellis and was intended to be a call for tolerance for inverts by publicizing their disadvantages and accidents of being born inverted. Hall subscribed to Ellis and Krafft-Ebing&#x27;s theories and rejected Freud&#x27;s theory that same-sex attraction was caused by childhood trauma and was curable. The publicity Hall received was due to unintended consequences; the novel was tried for obscenity in London, a spectacularly scandalous event described as &quot;&quot;the&quot; crystallizing moment in the construction of a visible modern English lesbian subculture&quot; by professor Laura Doan.

Newspaper stories frankly divulged that the book&#x27;s content includes &quot;sexual relations between Lesbian women&quot;, and photographs of Hall often accompanied details about lesbians in most major print outlets within a span of six months. Hall reflected the appearance of a &quot;mannish&quot; woman in the 1920s: short cropped hair, tailored suits (often with pants), and monocle that became widely recognized as a &quot;uniform&quot;. When British women supported the war effort during the First World War, they became familiar with masculine clothing, and were considered patriotic for wearing uniforms and pants. Postwar masculinization of women&#x27;s clothing became associated primarily with lesbianism.

In the United States, the 1920s was a decade of social experimentation, particularly with sex. This was heavily influenced by the writings of Sigmund Freud, who theorized that sexual desire would be sated unconsciously, despite an individual&#x27;s wish to ignore it. Freud&#x27;s theories were much more pervasive in the U.S. than in Europe. With the well-publicized notion that sexual acts were a part of lesbianism and their relationships, sexual experimentation was widespread. Large cities that provided a nightlife were immensely popular, and women began to seek out sexual adventure. Bisexuality became chic, particularly in America&#x27;s first gay neighborhoods.

No location saw more visitors for its possibilities of homosexual nightlife than Harlem, the predominantly African American section of New York City. White &quot;slummers&quot; enjoyed jazz, nightclubs, and anything else they wished. Blues singers Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, Ethel Waters, and Gladys Bentley sang about affairs with women to visitors such as Tallulah Bankhead, Beatrice Lillie, and the soon-to-be-named Joan Crawford. Homosexuals began to draw comparisons between their newly recognized minority status and that of African Americans. Among African American residents of Harlem, lesbian relationships were common and tolerated, though not overtly embraced. Some women staged lavish wedding ceremonies, even filing licenses using masculine names with New York City. Most homosexual women were married to men and participated in affairs with women regularly.

Across town, Greenwich Village also saw a growing homosexual community; both Harlem and Greenwich Village provided furnished rooms for single men and women, which was a major factor in their development as centers for homosexual communities. The tenor was different in Greenwich Village than Harlem. Bohemians—intellectuals who rejected Victorian ideals—gathered in the Village. Homosexuals were predominantly male, although figures such as poet Edna St. Vincent Millay and social host Mabel Dodge were known for their affairs with women and promotion of tolerance of homosexuality. Women in the U.S. who could not visit Harlem or live in Greenwich Village for the first time were able to visit saloons in the 1920s without being considered prostitutes. The existence of a public space for women to socialize in bars that were known to cater to lesbians &quot;became the single most important public manifestation of the subculture for many decades&quot;, according to historian Lillian Faderman.

=== Great Depression ===
The primary component necessary to encourage lesbians to be public and seek other women was economic independence, which virtually disappeared in the 1930s with the Great Depression. Most women in the U.S. found it necessary to marry to a &quot;front&quot; such as a gay man where both could pursue homosexual relationships with public discretion, or to a man who expected a traditional wife. Independent women in the 1930s were generally seen as holding jobs that men should have.

The social attitude made very small and close-knit communities in large cities that centered around bars, while simultaneously isolating women in other locales. Speaking of homosexuality in any context was socially forbidden, and women rarely discussed lesbianism even amongst themselves; they referred to openly gay people as &quot;in the Life&quot;. Freudian psychoanalytic theory was pervasive in influencing doctors to consider homosexuality as a neurosis afflicting immature women. Homosexual subculture disappeared in Germany with the rise of the Nazis in 1933.

=== World War II ===


The onset of World War II caused a massive upheaval in people&#x27;s lives as military mobilization engaged millions of men. Women were also accepted into the military in the U.S. Women&#x27;s Army Corps (WACs) and U.S. Navy&#x27;s Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES). Unlike processes to screen out male homosexuals, which had been in place since the creation of the American military, there were no methods to identify or screen for lesbians; they were put into place gradually during World War II. Despite common attitudes regarding women&#x27;s traditional roles in the 1930s, independent and masculine women were directly recruited by the military in the 1940s, and frailty discouraged.

Some women arrived at the recruiting station in a man&#x27;s suit, denied ever being in love with another woman, and were easily inducted. Sexual activity was forbidden and blue discharge was almost certain if one identified oneself as a lesbian. As women found each other, they formed into tight groups on base, socialized at service clubs, and began to use code words. Historian Allan Bérubé documented that homosexuals in the armed forces either consciously or subconsciously refused to identify themselves as homosexual or lesbian, and also never spoke about others&#x27; orientation.

The most masculine women were not necessarily common, though they were visible, so they tended to attract women interested in finding other lesbians. Women had to broach the subject about their interest in other women carefully, sometimes taking days to develop a common understanding without asking or stating anything outright. Women who did not enter the military were aggressively called upon to take industrial jobs left by men, in order to continue national productivity. The increased mobility, sophistication, and independence of many women during and after the war made it possible for women to live without husbands, something that would not have been feasible under different economic and social circumstances, further shaping lesbian networks and environments.

Lesbians were not included under Paragraph 175 of the German Criminal Code, which made homosexual acts between males a crime. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) stipulates that this is because women were seen as subordinate to men, and the Nazi state feared lesbians less than gay men. Many lesbians were arrested and imprisoned for &quot;asocial&quot; behaviour, a label which was applied to women who did not conform to the ideal Nazi image of a woman (child raising, kitchen work, churchgoing and passivity). These women were identified with an inverted black triangle. Although lesbianism was not specifically criminalized by Paragraph 175, some lesbians reclaimed the black triangle symbol as gay men reclaimed the pink triangle, and many lesbians also reclaimed the pink triangle.

=== Postwar ===
Following World War II, a nationwide movement pressed to return to pre-war society as quickly as possible in the U.S. When combined with the increasing national paranoia about communism and psychoanalytic theory that had become pervasive in medical knowledge, homosexuality became an undesired characteristic of employees working for the U.S. government in 1950. Homosexuals were thought to be vulnerable targets to blackmail, and the government purged its employment ranks of open homosexuals, beginning a widespread effort to gather intelligence about employees&#x27; private lives. State and local governments followed suit, arresting people for congregating in bars and parks, and enacting laws against cross-dressing for men and women.

The U.S. military and government conducted many interrogations, asking if women had ever had sexual relations with another woman and essentially equating even a one-time experience to a criminal identity, thereby severely delineating heterosexuals from homosexuals. In 1952, homosexuality was listed as a pathological emotional disturbance in the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual&quot;. The view that homosexuality was a curable sickness was widely believed in the medical community, general population, and among many lesbians themselves.

Attitudes and practices to ferret out homosexuals in public service positions extended to Australia and Canada. A section to create an offence of &quot;gross indecency&quot; between females was added to a bill in the United Kingdom House of Commons and passed there in 1921, but was rejected in the House of Lords, apparently because they were concerned any attention paid to sexual misconduct would also promote it.

==== Underground socializing ====
Very little information was available about homosexuality beyond medical and psychiatric texts. Community meeting places consisted of bars that were commonly raided by police once a month on average, with those arrested exposed in newspapers. In response, eight women in San Francisco met in their living rooms in 1955 to socialize and have a safe place to dance. When they decided to make it a regular meeting, they became the first organization for lesbians in the U.S., titled the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB). The DOB began publishing a magazine titled &quot;The Ladder&quot; in 1956. Inside the front cover of every issue was their mission statement, the first of which stated was &quot;Education of the variant&quot;. It was intended to provide women with knowledge about homosexuality—specifically relating to women and famous lesbians in history. By 1956, the term &quot;lesbian&quot; had such a negative meaning that the DOB refused to use it as a descriptor, choosing &quot;variant&quot; instead.

The DOB spread to Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, and &quot;The Ladder&quot; was mailed to hundreds—eventually thousands—of DOB members discussing the nature of homosexuality, sometimes challenging the idea that it was a sickness, with readers offering their own reasons why they were lesbians and suggesting ways to cope with the condition or society&#x27;s response to it. British lesbians followed with the publication of &quot;Arena Three&quot; beginning in 1964, with a similar mission.

==== Butch and femme dichotomy ====
As a reflection of categories of sexuality so sharply defined by the government and society at large, early lesbian subculture developed rigid gender roles between women, particularly among the working class in the United States and Canada. For working class lesbians who wanted to live as homosexuals, &quot;A functioning couple ... meant dichotomous individuals, if not male and female, then butch and femme&quot;, and the only models they had to go by were &quot;those of the traditional female-male [roles]&quot;. Although many municipalities enacted laws against cross-dressing, some women would socialize in bars as butches: dressed in men&#x27;s clothing and mirroring traditional masculine behavior. Others wore traditionally feminine clothing and assumed the role of femmes. Butch and femme modes of socialization were so integral within lesbian bars that women who refused to choose between the two would be ignored, or at least unable to date anyone, and butch women becoming romantically involved with other butch women or femmes with other femmes was unacceptable.

Butch women were not a novelty in the 1950s; even in Harlem and Greenwich Village in the 1920s some women assumed these personae. In the 1950s and 1960s, the roles were pervasive and not limited to North America: from 1940 to 1970, butch/femme bar culture flourished in Britain, though there were fewer class distinctions. They further identified members of a group that had been marginalized; women who had been rejected by most of society had an inside view of an exclusive group of people that took a high amount of knowledge to function in. Butch and femme were considered coarse by American lesbians of higher social standing during this period. Many wealthier women married men to satisfy their familial obligations, and others left North America to live as expatriates in Europe.

==== Fiction ====

Regardless of the lack of information about homosexuality in scholarly texts, another forum for learning about lesbianism was growing. A paperback book titled &quot;Women&#x27;s Barracks&quot; describing a woman&#x27;s experiences in the Free French Forces was published in 1950. It told of a lesbian relationship the author had witnessed. After 4.5 million copies were sold, it was consequently named in the House Select Committee on Current Pornographic Materials in 1952. Its publisher, Gold Medal Books, followed with the novel &quot;Spring Fire&quot; in 1952, which sold 1.5 million copies. Gold Medal Books was overwhelmed with mail from women writing about the subject matter, and followed with more books, creating the genre of lesbian pulp fiction.

Between 1955 and 1969, over 2,000 books were published using lesbianism as a topic, and they were sold in corner drugstores, train stations, bus stops, and newsstands all over the U.S. and Canada. Literary scholar, Yvonne Keller created several subclasses for lesbian pulp fiction, to help highlight the differences between the types of pulp fiction being released. Virile adventures were written by authors using male pseudonyms, and almost all were marketed to heterosexual men. During this time, another subclass emerged called &quot;Pro-Lesbian&quot;. The emergence of pro-lesbian fiction began with authors seeing the voyeuristic and homophobic nature of virile adventures. With only a handful of lesbian pulp fiction authors were women writing for lesbians, including Ann Bannon, Valerie Taylor, Paula Christian, and Vin Packer/Ann Aldrich. These authors deliberately defied the standard of virile adventures by focusing on the relationship between the pair, instead of writing sexually explicit material like virile adventures.

The differences between virile adventures and pro-lesbian covers and titles were distinct enough that Bannon, who also purchased lesbian pulp fiction, later stated that women identified the material iconically by the cover art. Pro-lesbian covers were innocuous and hinted at their lesbian themes, and virile adventures ranged from having one woman partially undressed to sexually explicit covers, to demonstrate the invariably salacious material inside. In addition to this, coded words and images were used on the covers. Instead of &quot;lesbian&quot;, terms such as &quot;strange&quot;, &quot;twilight&quot;, &quot;queer&quot;, and &quot;third sex&quot;, were used in the titles, and cover art was invariably salacious. Many of the books used cultural references: naming places, terms, describing modes of dress and other codes to isolated women. As a result, pulp fiction helped to proliferate a lesbian identity simultaneously to lesbians and heterosexual readers.

===Second-wave feminism===
The social rigidity of the 1950s and early 1960s encountered a backlash as social movements to improve the standing of African Americans, the poor, women, and gays all became prominent. Of the latter two, the gay rights movement and the feminist movement connected after a violent confrontation occurred in New York City in the 1969 Stonewall riots. What followed was a movement characterized by a surge of gay activism and feminist consciousness that further transformed the definition of lesbian.

The sexual revolution in the 1970s introduced the differentiation between identity and sexual behavior for women. Many women took advantage of their new social freedom to try new experiences. Women who previously identified as heterosexual tried sex with women, though many maintained their heterosexual identity. With the advent of second-wave feminism, lesbian as a political identity grew to describe a social philosophy among women, often overshadowing sexual desire as a defining trait. A militant feminist organization named Radicalesbians published a manifesto in 1970 entitled &quot;The Woman-Identified Woman&quot; that declared &quot;A lesbian is the rage of all women condensed to the point of explosion&quot;.

Militant feminists expressed their disdain with an inherently sexist and patriarchal society, and concluded the most effective way to overcome sexism and attain the equality of women would be to deny men any power or pleasure from women. For women who subscribed to this philosophy—dubbing themselves lesbian-feminists—lesbian was a term chosen by women to describe any woman who dedicated her approach to social interaction and political motivation to the welfare of women. Sexual desire was not the defining characteristic of a lesbian-feminist, but rather her focus on politics. Independence from men as oppressors was a central tenet of lesbian-feminism, and many believers strove to separate themselves physically and economically from traditional male-centered culture. In the ideal society, named Lesbian Nation, &quot;woman&quot; and &quot;lesbian&quot; were interchangeable.

Although lesbian-feminism was a significant shift, not all lesbians agreed with it. Lesbian-feminism was a youth-oriented movement: its members were primarily college educated, with experience in New Left and radical causes, but they had not seen any success in persuading radical organizations to take up women&#x27;s issues. Many older lesbians who had acknowledged their sexuality in more conservative times felt maintaining their ways of coping in a homophobic world was more appropriate. The Daughters of Bilitis folded in 1970 over which direction to focus on: feminism or gay rights issues.

As equality was a priority for lesbian-feminists, disparity of roles between men and women or butch and femme were viewed as patriarchal. Lesbian-feminists eschewed gender role play that had been pervasive in bars, as well as the perceived chauvinism of gay men; many lesbian-feminists refused to work with gay men, or take up their causes. Lesbians who held more essentialist views that they were born homosexual, and used the descriptor &quot;lesbian&quot; to define sexual attraction, often considered the separatist, angry opinions of lesbian-feminists to be detrimental to the cause of gay rights.

In 1980, poet and essayist Adrienne Rich expanded upon the political meaning of lesbian by proposing a continuum of lesbian existence based on &quot;woman-identified experience&quot; in her essay &quot;Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence&quot;. All relationships between women, Rich proposed, have some lesbian element, regardless if they claim a lesbian identity: mothers and daughters, women who work together, and women who nurse each other, for example. Such a perception of women relating to each other connects them through time and across cultures, and Rich considered heterosexuality a condition forced upon women by men. Several years earlier, DOB founders Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon similarly relegated sexual acts as unnecessary in determining what a lesbian is, by providing their definition: &quot;a woman whose primary erotic, psychological, emotional and social interest is in a member of her own sex, even though that interest may not be overtly expressed&quot;.

==Outside western culture==
===Middle East===
Arabic-language historical records have used various terms to describe sexual practices between women. A common one is &quot;sahq&quot;, which refers to rubbing. Lesbian practices and identities are largely absent from the historical record. The common term to describe lesbianism in Arabic today is essentially the same term used to describe men, and thus the distinction between male and female homosexuality is to a certain extent linguistically obscured in contemporary queer discourse. Overall, the study of contemporary lesbian experience in the region is complicated by power dynamics in the postcolonial context, shaped even by what some scholars refer to as &quot;homonationalism&quot;, the use of politicized understanding of sexual categories to advance specific national interests on the domestic and international stage.

Female homosexual behavior may be present in every culture, although the concept of a lesbian as a woman who pairs exclusively with other women is not. Attitudes about female homosexual behavior are dependent upon women&#x27;s roles in each society and each culture&#x27;s definition of sex. Women in the Middle East have been historically segregated from men. In the 7th and 8th centuries, some extraordinary women dressed in male attire when gender roles were less strict, but the sexual roles that accompanied European women were not associated with Islamic women. The Caliphal court in Baghdad featured women who dressed as men, including false facial hair, but they competed with other women for the attentions of men.

According to the 12th-century writings of Sharif al-Idrisi, highly intelligent women were more likely to be lesbians; their intellectual prowess put them on a more even par with men. Relations between women who lived in harems and fears of women being sexually intimate in the hammam, the so-called &quot;Turkish&quot; bath, were expressed in writings by men. Women were mostly silent, and men likewise rarely wrote about lesbian relationships. It is unclear to historians if the rare instances of lesbianism mentioned in literature are an accurate historical record, or if they were only intended to serve as fantasies for men. A 1978 treatise about repression in Iran asserted that women were completely silenced: &quot;In the whole of Iranian history, [no woman] has been allowed to speak out for such tendencies ... To attest to lesbian desires would be an unforgivable crime.&quot;

Although the authors of &quot;Islamic Homosexualities&quot; argued this did not mean women could not engage in lesbian relationships, a lesbian anthropologist in 1991 visited Yemen and reported that women in the town she visited were unable to comprehend her romantic relationship to another woman. Women in Pakistan are expected to marry men; those who do not are ostracized. Women may have intimate relations with other women as long as their wifely duties are met, their private matters are kept quiet, and the woman with whom they are involved is somehow related by family or logical interest to her lover.

Individuals identifying with or otherwise engaging in lesbian practices in the region can face family violence and societal persecution, including what are commonly referred to as &quot;honor killings&quot;. The justifications provided by murderers relate to a person&#x27;s perceived sexual immorality, loss of virginity (outside of acceptable frames of marriage), and target female victims primarily.

===Americas===
Both male and female homosexuality were known in Aztec culture. Although both were generally disapproved of, there is no evidence that homosexuality was actively suppressed until after the Spanish Conquest. Female homosexuality is described in the Florentine Codex, a 16th-century study of the Aztec world written by the Spanish Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagún. It describes Aztec lesbians as masculine in appearance and behavior and never wishing to be married. The book &quot;Monarquía indiana&quot; by Fray Juan de Torquemada, published in 1615, briefly mentions the persecution of Aztec lesbians: &quot;The woman, who with another woman had carnal pleasures, for which they were called &quot;Patlache&quot;, which means: female incubus, they both died for it.&quot;

In Latin America, lesbian consciousness and associations appeared in the 1970s, increasing while several countries transitioned to or reformed democratic governments. Harassment and intimidation have been common even in places where homosexuality is legal, and laws against child corruption, morality, or &quot;the good ways&quot; (&quot;faltas a la moral o las buenas costumbres&quot;), have been used to persecute homosexuals. From the Hispanic perspective, the conflict between the lesbophobia of some feminists and the misogyny from gay men has created a difficult path for lesbians and associated groups.

Argentina was the first Latin American country with a gay rights group, &quot;Nuestro Mundo&quot; (NM, or Our World), created in 1969. Six mostly secret organizations concentrating on gay or lesbian issues were founded around this time, but persecution and harassment were continuous and grew worse with the dictatorship of Jorge Rafael Videla in 1976, when all groups were dissolved in the Dirty War. Lesbian rights groups have gradually formed since 1986 to build a cohesive community that works to overcome philosophical differences with heterosexual women.

The Latin American lesbian movement has been the most active in Mexico but has encountered similar problems in effectiveness and cohesion. While groups try to promote lesbian issues and concerns, they also face misogynistic attitudes from gay men and homophobic views from heterosexual women. In 1977, &quot;Lesbos&quot;, the first lesbian organization for Mexicans, was formed. Several incarnations of political groups promoting lesbian issues have evolved; 13 lesbian organizations were active in Mexico City in 1997. Ultimately, lesbian associations had little influence on the homosexual and feminist movements.

In Chile, the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet forbade the creation of lesbian groups until 1984, when &quot;Ayuquelén&quot; (&quot;joy of being&quot; in Mapuche) was first founded, prompted by the very public beating death of a woman amid shouts of &quot;Damned lesbian!&quot; from her attacker. The lesbian movement has been closely associated with the feminist movement in Chile, although the relationship has been sometimes strained. &quot;Ayuquelén&quot; worked with the International Lesbian Information Service, the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, and the Chilean gay rights group &quot;Movimiento de Integración y Liberación Homosexual&quot; (Movement to Integrate and Liberate Homosexuals) to remove the sodomy law still in force in Chile.

Lesbian consciousness became more visible in Nicaragua in 1986, when the Sandinista National Liberation Front expelled gay men and lesbians from its midst. State persecution prevented the formation of associations until AIDS became a concern, when educational efforts forced sexual minorities to band together. The first lesbian organization was &quot;Nosotras&quot;, founded in 1989. An effort to promote visibility from 1991 to 1992 provoked the government to declare homosexuality illegal in 1994, effectively ending the movement, until 2004, when &quot;Grupo Safo – Grupo de Mujeres Lesbianas de Nicaragua&quot; was created, four years before homosexuality became legal again.

The meetings of feminist lesbians of Latin America and the Caribbean, sometimes shortened to &quot;Lesbian meetings&quot;, have been an important forum for the exchange of ideas for Latin American lesbians since the late 1980s. With rotating hosts and biannual gatherings, its main aims are the creation of communication networks, to change the situation of lesbians in Latin America (both legally and socially), to increase solidarity between lesbians and to destroy the existing myths about them.

Some Indigenous peoples of the Americas conceptualize a third gender for women who dress as, and fulfill the roles usually filled by, men in their cultures. In other cases they may see gender as a spectrum, and use different terms for feminine women and masculine women. These identities are rooted in the context of the ceremonial and cultural lives of the particular Indigenous cultures, and &quot;simply being gay and Indian does not make someone a Two-Spirit.&quot; These ceremonial and social roles, which are conferred and confirmed by the person&#x27;s elders, &quot;do not make sense&quot; when defined by non-Native concepts of sexual orientation and gender identity. Rather, they must be understood in an Indigenous context, as traditional spiritual and social roles held by the person in their Indigenous community.

===Africa===
Cross-gender roles and marriage between women has also been recorded in over 30 African societies. Women may marry other women, raise their children, and be generally thought of as men in societies in Nigeria, Cameroon, and Kenya. The Hausa people of Sudan have a term equivalent to lesbian, &quot;kifi&quot;, that may also be applied to males to mean &quot;neither party insists on a particular sexual role&quot;.

Near the Congo River, a female who participates in strong emotional or sexual relationships with another female among the Nkundo people is known as &quot;yaikya bonsángo&quot; (a woman who presses against another woman). Lesbian relationships are also known in matrilineal societies in Ghana among the Akan people. In Lesotho, females engage in what is commonly considered sexual behavior to the Western world: they kiss, sleep together, rub genitals, participate in cunnilingus, and maintain their relationships with other females vigilantly. Since the people of Lesotho believe sex requires a penis, they do not consider their behavior sexual, nor label themselves lesbians.

In Tanzania, lesbians are known as or called &quot;Msagaji&quot; (singular), &quot;Wasagaji&quot; (plural), which in Swahili means grinder or grinding because of the perceived nature of lesbian sex that would involve the mutual rubbing of vulvas.

In South Africa, lesbians are sometimes raped by heterosexual men with a goal of punishment of &quot;abnormal&quot; behavior and reinforcement of societal norms. The crime was first identified in South Africa where it is sometimes supervised by members of the woman&#x27;s family or local community, and is a major contributor to HIV infection in South African lesbians. &quot;Corrective rape&quot; is not recognized by the South African legal system as a hate crime despite the fact that the South African Constitution states that no person shall be discriminated against based on their social status and identity, including sexual orientation. Legally, South Africa protects gay rights extensively, but the government has not taken proactive action to prevent corrective rape, and women do not have much faith in the police and their investigations.

Corrective rape is reported to be on the rise in South Africa. The South African nonprofit &quot;Luleki Sizwe&quot; estimates that more than 10 lesbians are raped or gang-raped on a weekly basis. As made public by the Triangle Project in 2008, at least 500 lesbians become victims of corrective rape every year and 86% of black lesbians in the Western Cape live in fear of being sexually assaulted. Victims of corrective rape are less likely to report the crime because of their society&#x27;s negative beliefs about homosexuality.

===Asia===
China before westernization was another society that segregated men from women. Historical Chinese culture has not recognized a concept of sexual orientation, or a framework to divide people based on their same-sex or opposite-sex attractions. Although there was a significant culture surrounding homosexual men, there was none for women. Outside their duties to bear sons to their husbands, women were perceived as having no sexuality at all.

This did not mean that women could not pursue sexual relationships with other women, but that such associations could not impose upon women&#x27;s relationships to men. Rare references to lesbianism were written by Ying Shao, who identified same-sex relationships between women in imperial courts who behaved as husband and wife as &quot;dui shi&quot; (paired eating). &quot;Golden Orchid Associations&quot; in Southern China existed into the 20th century and promoted formal marriages between women, who were then allowed to adopt children. Westernization brought new ideas that all sexual behavior not resulting in reproduction was aberrant.

The liberty of being employed in silk factories starting in 1865 allowed some women to style themselves &quot;tzu-shu nii&quot; (never to marry) and live in communes with other women. Other Chinese called them &quot;sou-hei&quot; (self-combers) for adopting hairstyles of married women. These communes passed because of the Great Depression and were subsequently discouraged by the communist government for being a relic of feudal China. In contemporary Chinese society, &quot;tongzhi&quot; (same goal or spirit) is the term used to refer to homosexuals; most Chinese are reluctant to divide this classification further to identify lesbians.

In Japan, the term , a Japanese pronunciation of &quot;lesbian&quot;, was used during the 1920s. Westernization brought more independence for women and allowed some Japanese women to wear pants. The cognate tomboy is used in the Philippines, and particularly in Manila, to denote women who are more masculine. Virtuous women in Korea prioritize motherhood, chastity, and virginity; outside this scope, very few women are free to express themselves through sexuality, although there is a growing organization for lesbians named . The term &quot;pondan&quot; is used in Malaysia to refer to gay men, but since there is no historical context to reference lesbians, the term is used for female homosexuals as well. As in many Asian countries, open homosexuality is discouraged in many social levels, so many Malaysians lead double lives.

In India, a 14th-century Indian text mentioning a lesbian couple who had a child as a result of their lovemaking is an exception to the general silence about female homosexuality. According to Ruth Vanita, this invisibility disappeared with the release of a film titled &quot;Fire&quot; in 1996, prompting some theaters in India to be attacked by religious extremists. Terms used to label homosexuals are often rejected by Indian activists for being the result of imperialist influence, but most discourse on homosexuality centers on men. Women&#x27;s rights groups in India continue to debate the legitimacy of including lesbian issues in their platforms, as lesbians and material focusing on female homosexuality are frequently suppressed.

==Demographics==
===Kinsey Report===
The most extensive early study of female homosexuality was provided by the Institute for Sex Research, who published an in-depth report of the sexual experiences of American women in 1953. More than 8,000 women were interviewed by Alfred Kinsey and the staff of the Institute for Sex Research in a book titled &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Female&quot;, popularly known as part of the Kinsey Report. The Kinsey Report&#x27;s dispassionate discussion of homosexuality as a form of human sexual behavior was revolutionary. Up to this study, only physicians and psychiatrists studied sexual behavior, and almost always the results were interpreted with a moral view.

Kinsey and his staff reported that 28% of women had been aroused by another female, and 19% had a sexual contact with another female. Of women who had sexual contact with another female, half to two-thirds of them had orgasmed. Single women had the highest prevalence of homosexual activity, followed by women who were widowed, divorced, or separated. The lowest occurrence of sexual activity was among married women; those with previous homosexual experience reported they married to stop homosexual activity.

Most of the women who reported homosexual activity had not experienced it more than ten times. Fifty-one percent of women reporting homosexual experience had only one partner. Women with post-graduate education had a higher prevalence of homosexual experience, followed by women with a college education; the smallest occurrence was among women with education no higher than eighth grade. Some criticized Kinsey&#x27;s methodology.

Based on Kinsey&#x27;s scale where 0 represents a person with an exclusively heterosexual response and 6 represents a person with an exclusively homosexual one, and numbers in between represent a gradient of responses with both sexes, 6% of those interviewed ranked as a 6: exclusively homosexual. Apart from those who ranked 0 (71%), the largest percentage in between 0 and 6 was 1 at approximately 15%. The Kinsey Report remarked that the ranking described a period in a person&#x27;s life, and that a person&#x27;s orientation may change. Among the criticisms the Kinsey Report received, a particular one addressed the Institute for Sex Research&#x27;s tendency to use statistical sampling, which facilitated an over-representation of same-sex relationships by other researchers who did not adhere to Kinsey&#x27;s qualifications of data.

===Hite Report===
In 1976, sexologist Shere Hite published a report on the sexual encounters of 3,019 women who had responded to questionnaires, under the title &quot;The Hite Report&quot;. Hite&#x27;s questions differed from Kinsey&#x27;s, focusing more on how women identified, or what they preferred rather than experience. Respondents to Hite&#x27;s questions indicated that 8% preferred sex with women and 9% answered that they identified as bisexual or had sexual experiences with men and women, though they refused to indicate preference.

Hite&#x27;s conclusions are more based on respondents&#x27; comments than quantifiable data. She found it &quot;striking&quot; that many women who had no lesbian experiences indicated they were interested in sex with women, particularly because the question was not asked. Hite found the two most significant differences between respondents&#x27; experience with men and women were the focus on clitoral stimulation, and more emotional involvement and orgasmic responses. Since Hite performed her study during the popularity of feminism in the 1970s, she also acknowledged that women may have chosen the political identity of a lesbian.

===Population estimates===
Lesbians in the U.S. are estimated to be about 2.6% of the population, according to a National Opinion Research Center survey of sexually active adults who had had same-sex experiences within the past year, completed in 2000. A survey of same-sex couples in the United States showed that between 2000 and 2005, the number of people claiming to be in same-sex relationships increased by 30%—five times the rate of population growth in the U.S. The study attributed the jump to people being more comfortable self-identifying as homosexual to the federal government.

The government of the United Kingdom does not ask citizens to define their sexuality. A survey by the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) in 2010 found that 1.5% of Britons identified themselves as gay or bisexual, and the ONS suggests that this is in line with other surveys showing the number between 0.3% and 3%. Estimates of lesbians are sometimes not differentiated in studies of same-sex households, such as those performed by the U.S. census, and estimates of total gay, lesbian, or bisexual population by the UK government. Polls in Australia recorded a range of self-identified lesbian or bisexual women from 1.3% to 2.2% of the total population.

==Health==
===Physical===
In terms of medical issues, lesbians are referred to as women who have sex with women (WSW) because of the misconceptions and assumptions about women&#x27;s sexuality and some women&#x27;s hesitancy to disclose their accurate sexual histories even to a physician. Many self-identified lesbians neglect to see a physician because they do not participate in heterosexual activity and require no birth control, which is the initiating factor for most women to seek consultation with a gynecologist when they become sexually active. As a result, many lesbians are not screened regularly with Pap smears. The U.S. government reports that some lesbians neglect seeking medical screening in the U.S.; they lack health insurance because many employers do not offer health benefits to domestic partners.

The result of the lack of medical information on WSW is that medical professionals and some lesbians perceive lesbians as having lower risks of acquiring sexually transmitted infections or types of cancer. When women do seek medical attention, medical professionals often fail to take a complete medical history. In a 2006 study of 2,345 lesbian and bisexual women, only 9.3% had claimed they had ever been asked their sexual orientation by a physician. A third of the respondents believed disclosing their sexual history would result in a negative reaction, and 30% had received a negative reaction from a medical professional after identifying themselves as lesbian or bisexual. A patient&#x27;s complete history helps medical professionals identify higher risk areas and corrects assumptions about the personal histories of women. In a similar survey of 6,935 lesbians, 77% had had sexual contact with one or more male partners, and 6% had that contact within the previous year.

Heart disease is listed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as the number one cause of death for all women. Factors that add to risk of heart disease include obesity and smoking, both of which are more prevalent among lesbians. Studies show that lesbians have a higher body mass and are generally less concerned about weight issues than heterosexual women; and lesbians consider women with higher body masses to be more attractive than heterosexual women do. Lesbians are more likely to exercise regularly than heterosexual women, and lesbians do not generally exercise for aesthetic reasons, although heterosexual women do. Research is needed to determine specific causes of obesity in lesbians.

Lack of differentiation between homosexual and heterosexual women in medical studies that concentrate on health issues for women skews results for lesbians and non-lesbian women. Reports are inconclusive about occurrence of breast cancer in lesbians. It has been determined that the lower rate of lesbians tested by regular Pap smears makes it more difficult to detect cervical cancer at early stages in lesbians. The risk factors for developing ovarian cancer rates are higher in lesbians than heterosexual women, perhaps because many lesbians lack protective factors of pregnancy, abortion, contraceptives, breast feeding, and miscarriages.

Some sexually transmitted infections are communicable between women, including human papillomavirus (HPV)—specifically genital warts—squamous intraepithelial lesions, trichomoniasis, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Transmission of specific sexually transmitted infections among women who have sex with women depends on the sexual practices women engage in. Any object that comes in contact with cervical secretions, vaginal mucosa, or menstrual blood, including fingers or penetrative objects may transmit sexually transmitted infections. Orogenital contact may indicate a higher risk of acquiring HSV, even among women who have had no prior sex with men.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) occurs more often in lesbians, but it is unclear if BV is transmitted by sexual contact; it occurs in celibate as well as sexually active women. BV often occurs in both partners in a lesbian relationship; a recent study of women with BV found that 81% had partners with BV. Lesbians are not included in a category of frequency of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission, although transmission is possible through vaginal and cervical secretions. The highest rate of transmission of HIV to lesbians is among women who participate in intravenous drug use or have sexual intercourse with bisexual men.

=== Mental ===
Since medical literature began to describe homosexuality, it has often been approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause, influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud. Although he considered bisexuality inherent in all people and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts. Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual&quot; in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.

Women who identify as lesbian report feeling significantly different and isolated during adolescence. These emotions have been cited as appearing on average at 15 years old in lesbians and 18 years old in women who identify as bisexual. On the whole, women tend to work through developing a self-concept internally, or with other women with whom they are intimate. Women also limit who they divulge their sexual identities to, and more often see being lesbian as a choice, as opposed to gay men, who work more externally and see being gay as outside their control.

Anxiety disorders and depression are the most common mental health issues for women. Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women, although generalized anxiety disorder is more likely to appear among lesbian and bisexual women than heterosexual women. Depression is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family, or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or endure relationship difficulties with no support system. Men&#x27;s shaping of women&#x27;s sexuality has proven to have an effect on how lesbians see their own bodies. Studies have shown that heterosexual men and lesbians have different standards for what they consider attractive in women. Lesbians who view themselves with male standards of female beauty may experience lower self-esteem, eating disorders, and higher incidence of depression. More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts, and 18% had attempted suicide.

A population-based study completed by the National Alcohol Research Center found that women who identify as lesbian or bisexual are less likely to abstain from alcohol. Lesbians and bisexual women have a higher likelihood of reporting problems with alcohol, as well as not being satisfied with treatment for substance abuse programs. Many lesbian communities are centered in bars, and drinking is an activity that correlates to community participation for lesbians and bisexual women.

==Media representation==
Lesbians portrayed in literature, film, and television often shape contemporary thought about women&#x27;s sexuality. The majority of media about lesbians is produced by men; women&#x27;s publishing companies did not develop until the 1970s, films about lesbians made by women did not appear until the 1980s, and television shows portraying lesbians written by women only began to be created in the 21st century. As a result, homosexuality—particularly dealing with women—has been excluded because of symbolic annihilation. When depictions of lesbians began to surface, they were often one-dimensional, simplified stereotypes.

===Literature===
In addition to Sappho&#x27;s accomplishments, Literary historians Jeannette Howard Foster and Terry Castle include the Book of Ruth, and ancient mythological tradition as examples of lesbianism in classical literature. Greek stories of the heavens often included a female figure whose virtue and virginity were unspoiled, who pursued more masculine interests, and who was followed by a dedicated group of maidens. Foster cites Camilla and Diana, Artemis and Callisto, and Iphis and Ianthe as examples of female mythological figures who showed remarkable devotion to each other, or defied gender expectations. The Greeks are also given credit with spreading the story of a mythological race of women warriors named Amazons.

For ten centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire, lesbianism disappeared from literature. Foster points to the particularly strict view that Eve—representative of all women—caused the downfall of mankind; original sin among women was a particular concern, especially because women were perceived as creating life. During this time, women were largely illiterate and not encouraged to engage in intellectual pursuit, so men were responsible for shaping ideas about sexuality.

In the 15th and 16th centuries, French and English depictions of relationships between women (&quot;Lives of Gallant Ladies&quot; by Brantôme in 1665, John Cleland&#x27;s 1749 erotica &quot;Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Espion Anglais&quot; by various authors in 1778), writers&#x27; attitudes spanned from amused tolerance to arousal, whereupon a male character would participate to complete the act. Physical relationships between women were often encouraged; men felt no threat as they viewed sexual acts between women to be accepted when men were not available, and not comparable to fulfillment that could be achieved by sexual acts between men and women. At worst, if a woman became enamored of another woman, she became a tragic figure. Physical and therefore emotional satisfaction was considered impossible without a natural phallus. Male intervention into relationships between women was necessary only when women acted as men and demanded the same social privileges.

Lesbianism became almost exclusive to French literature in the 19th century, based on male fantasy and the desire to shock bourgeois moral values. Honoré de Balzac, in &quot;The Girl with the Golden Eyes&quot; (1835), employed lesbianism in his story about three people living amongst the moral degeneration of Paris, and again in &quot;Cousin Bette&quot; and &quot;Séraphîta&quot;. His work influenced novelist Théophile Gautier&#x27;s &quot;Mademoiselle de Maupin&quot;, which provided the first description of a physical type that became associated with lesbians: tall, wide-shouldered, slim-hipped, and athletically inclined. Charles Baudelaire repeatedly used lesbianism as a theme in his poems &quot;Lesbos&quot;, (&quot;Damned Women&quot;), and .

Reflecting French society, as well as employing stock character associations, many of the lesbian characters in 19th-century French literature were prostitutes or courtesans: personifications of vice who died early, violent deaths in moral endings. Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s 1816 poem &quot;Christabel&quot; and the novella &quot;Carmilla&quot; (1872) by Sheridan Le Fanu both present lesbianism associated with vampirism. Portrayals of female homosexuality not only formed European consciousness about lesbianism, but Krafft-Ebing cited the characters in Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s &quot;Salammbô&quot; (1862) and Ernest Feydeau&#x27;s &quot;La comtesse de Chalis&quot; (1867) as examples of lesbians because both novels feature female protagonists who do not adhere to social norms and express &quot;contrary sexual feeling&quot;, although neither participated in same-sex desire or sexual behavior. Havelock Ellis used literary examples from Balzac and several French poets and writers to develop his framework to identify sexual inversion in women.

Gradually, women began to author their own thoughts and literary works about lesbian relationships. Until the publication of &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot;, most major works involving lesbianism were penned by men. Foster suggests that women would have encountered suspicion about their own lives had they used same-sex love as a topic, and that some writers including Louise Labé, Charlotte Charke, and Margaret Fuller either changed the pronouns in their literary works to male, or made them ambiguous. Author George Sand was portrayed as a character in several works in the 19th century; writer Mario Praz credited the popularity of lesbianism as a theme to Sand&#x27;s appearance in Paris society in the 1830s.

In the 20th century, Katherine Mansfield, Amy Lowell, Gertrude Stein, H.D., Vita Sackville-West, Virginia Woolf, and Gale Wilhelm wrote popular works that had same-sex relationships as themes. Some women, such as Marguerite Yourcenar and Mary Renault, wrote or translated works of fiction that focused on homosexual men, like some of the writings of Carson McCullers. All three were involved in same-sex relationships, but their primary friendships were with gay men. Foster further asserts 1928 was a &quot;peak year&quot; for lesbian-themed literature; in addition to &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot;, three other novels with lesbian themes were published in England: Elizabeth Bowen&#x27;s &quot;The Hotel&quot;, Woolf&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, and Compton Mackenzie&#x27;s satirical novel &quot;Extraordinary Women&quot;. Unlike &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot;, none of these novels were banned.

As the paperback book came into fashion, lesbian themes were relegated to pulp fiction. Many of the pulp novels typically presented very unhappy women, or relationships that ended tragically. Marijane Meaker later wrote that she was told to make the relationship end badly in &quot;Spring Fire&quot; because the publishers were concerned about the books being confiscated by the U.S. Postal Service. Patricia Highsmith, writing as Claire Morgan, wrote &quot;The Price of Salt&quot; in 1951 and refused to follow this directive, but instead used a pseudonym.

Following the Stonewall riots, lesbian themes in literature became much more diverse and complex, and shifted the focus of lesbianism from erotica for heterosexual men to works written by and for lesbians. Feminist magazines such as &quot;The Furies&quot;, and &quot;Sinister Wisdom&quot; replaced &quot;The Ladder&quot;. Serious writers who used lesbian characters and plots included Rita Mae Brown&#x27;s &quot;Rubyfruit Jungle&quot; (1973), which presents a feminist heroine who chooses to be a lesbian. Poet Audre Lorde confronts homophobia and racism in her works, and Cherríe Moraga is credited with being primarily responsible for bringing Latina perspectives to lesbian literature. Further changing values are evident in the writings of Dorothy Allison, who focuses on child sexual abuse and deliberately provocative lesbian sadomasochism themes.

===Film===
Lesbianism, or the suggestion of it, began early in filmmaking. The same constructs of how lesbians were portrayed—or for what reasons—as what had appeared in literature were placed on women in the films. Women challenging their feminine roles was a device more easily accepted than men challenging masculine ones. Actresses appeared as men in male roles because of plot devices as early as 1914 in &quot;A Florida Enchantment&quot; featuring Edith Storey. In &quot;Morocco&quot; (1930) Marlene Dietrich kisses another woman on the lips, and Katharine Hepburn plays a man in &quot;Christopher Strong&quot; in 1933 and again in &quot;Sylvia Scarlett&quot; (1936). Hollywood films followed the same trend set by audiences who flocked to Harlem to see edgy shows that suggested bisexuality.

Overt female homosexuality was introduced in 1929&#x27;s &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; between Louise Brooks and Alice Roberts. After the Hays Code in 1930, most references to homosexuality in films were censored under the umbrella term &quot;sex perversion&quot;. German films depicted homosexuality and were distributed throughout Europe, but 1931&#x27;s &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot; was not distributed in the U.S. because of the depiction of an adolescent&#x27;s love for a female teacher in boarding school.

Because of the Hays Code, lesbianism after 1930 was absent from most films, even those adapted with overt lesbian characters or plot devices. Lillian Hellman&#x27;s play &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; was converted into a heterosexual love triangle and retitled &quot;These Three&quot;. Biopic &quot;Queen Christina&quot; in 1933, starring Greta Garbo, veiled most of the speculation about Christina of Sweden&#x27;s affairs with women. Homosexuality or lesbianism was never mentioned outright in the films while the Hays Code was enforced. The reason censors stated for removing a lesbian scene in 1954&#x27;s &quot;The Pit of Loneliness&quot; was that it was, &quot;Immoral, would tend to corrupt morals&quot;. The code was relaxed somewhat after 1961, and the next year William Wyler remade &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; with Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine. After MacLaine&#x27;s character admits her love for Hepburn&#x27;s, she hangs herself; this set a precedent for miserable endings in films addressing homosexuality.

Gay characters also were often killed off at the end, such as the death of Sandy Dennis&#x27; character at the end of &quot;The Fox&quot; in 1968. If not victims, lesbians were depicted as villains or morally corrupt, such as portrayals of brothel madames by Barbara Stanwyck in &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; from 1962 and Shelley Winters in &quot;The Balcony&quot; in 1963. Lesbians as predators were presented in &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1940), women&#x27;s prison films like &quot;Caged&quot; (1950), or in the character Rosa Klebb in &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; (1963). Lesbian vampire themes have reappeared in &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1936), &quot;Blood and Roses&quot; (1960), &quot;Vampyros Lesbos&quot; (1971), and &quot;The Hunger&quot; (1983). &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; (1992) featured a bisexual murderer played by Sharon Stone; it was one of several films that set off a storm of protests about the depiction of gay people as predators.

The first film to address lesbianism with significant depth was &quot;The Killing of Sister George&quot; in 1968, which was filmed in The Gateways Club, a longstanding lesbian pub in London. It is the first to claim a film character who identifies as a lesbian, and film historian Vito Russo considers the film a complex treatment of a multifaceted character who is forced into silence about her openness by other lesbians. &quot;Personal Best&quot; in 1982, and &quot;Lianna&quot; in 1983 treat the lesbian relationships more sympathetically and show lesbian sex scenes, though in neither film are the relationships happy ones. &quot;Personal Best&quot; was criticized for engaging in the clichéd plot device of one woman returning to a relationship with a man, implying that lesbianism is a phase, as well as treating the lesbian relationship with &quot;undisguised voyeurism&quot;. More ambiguous portrayals of lesbian characters were seen in &quot;Silkwood&quot; (1983), &quot;The Color Purple&quot; (1985), and &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot; (1991), despite explicit lesbianism in the source material.

An era of independent filmmaking brought different stories, writers, and directors to films. &quot;Desert Hearts&quot; arrived in 1985, to be one of the most successful. Directed by lesbian Donna Deitch, it is loosely based on Jane Rule&#x27;s novel &quot;Desert of the Heart&quot;. It received mixed critical commentary, but earned positive reviews from the gay press. The late 1980s and early 1990s ushered in a series of films treating gay and lesbian issues seriously, made by gays and lesbians, nicknamed New Queer Cinema. Films using lesbians as a subject included Rose Troche&#x27;s avant garde romantic comedy &quot;Go Fish&quot; (1994) and the first film about African American lesbians, Cheryl Dunye&#x27;s &quot;The Watermelon Woman&quot;, in 1995.

Realism in films depicting lesbians developed further to include romance stories such as &quot;The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love&quot; and &quot;When Night Is Falling&quot;, both in 1995, &quot;Better Than Chocolate&quot; (1999), and the social satire &quot;But I&#x27;m a Cheerleader&quot; (also in 1999). A twist on the lesbian-as-predator theme was the added complexity of motivations of some lesbian characters in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; (1994), the Oscar-winning biopic of Aileen Wuornos, &quot;Monster&quot; (2003), and the exploration of fluid sexuality and gender in &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; (1997), &quot;Kissing Jessica Stein&quot; (2001), and &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; (1999). The film &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; shows a dictatorship in future Britain that forces lesbians, homosexuals, and other &quot;unwanted&quot; people in society to be systematically slaughtered in Nazi concentration camps. In the film, a lesbian actress named Valerie, who was killed in such a manner, serves as inspiration for the masked rebel V and his ally Evey Hammond, who set out to overthrow the dictatorship.

=== Theatre ===
The first stage production to feature a lesbian kiss and open depiction of two women in love is the 1907 Yiddish play &quot;God of Vengeance&quot; (&quot;Got fun nekome&quot;) by Sholem Asch. Rivkele, a young woman, and Manke, a prostitute in her father&#x27;s brothel, fall in love. On March 6, 1923, during a performance of the play in a New York City theatre, producers and cast were informed that they had been indicted by a Grand Jury for violating the Penal Code that defined the presentation of &quot;an obscene, indecent, immoral and impure theatrical production.&quot; They were arrested the following day when they appeared before a judge. Two months later, they were found guilty in a jury trial. The producers were fined $200 and the cast received suspended sentences. The play is considered by some to be &quot;the greatest drama of the Yiddish theater&quot;. &quot;God of Vengeance&quot; was the inspiration for the 2015 play &quot;Indecent&quot; by Paula Vogel, which features lesbian characters Rifkele and Manke. &quot;Indecent&quot; was nominated for the 2017 Tony Award for Best Play and Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play.

Broadway musical &quot;The Prom&quot; featured lesbian characters Emma Nolan and Alyssa Greene. In 2019, the production was nominated for six Tony Awards, including Best Musical, and received the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Musical. A performance from &quot;The Prom&quot; was included in the 2018 Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade and made history by showing the first same-sex kiss in the parade&#x27;s broadcast. &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; featured lesbian character Jo, who is dealing with her religious mother&#x27;s disapproval.

===Television===
Television began to address homosexuality much later than film. Local talk shows in the late 1950s first addressed homosexuality by inviting panels of experts (usually not gay themselves) to discuss the problems of gay men in society. Lesbianism was rarely included. The first time a lesbian was portrayed on network television was the NBC drama &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot; in the early 1960s, in a teleplay about an actress who feels she is persecuted by her female director, and in distress, calls a psychiatrist who explains she is a latent lesbian who has deep-rooted guilt about her feelings for women. When she realizes this, she is able to pursue heterosexual relationships, which are portrayed as &quot;healthy&quot;.

Invisibility for lesbians continued in the 1970s when homosexuality became the subject of dramatic portrayals, first with medical dramas (&quot;The Bold Ones&quot;, &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Medical Center&quot;) featuring primarily male patients coming out to doctors, or staff members coming out to other staff members. These shows allowed homosexuality to be discussed clinically, with the main characters guiding troubled gay characters or correcting homophobic antagonists, while simultaneously comparing homosexuality to psychosis, criminal behavior, or drug use.

Another stock plot device in the 1970s was the gay character in a police drama. They served as victims of blackmail or anti-gay violence, but more often as criminals. Beginning in the late 1960s with &quot;N.Y.P.D.&quot;, &quot;Police Story&quot;, and &quot;Police Woman&quot;, the use of homosexuals in stories became much more prevalent, according to Vito Russo, as a response to their higher profiles in gay activism. Lesbians were included as villains, motivated to murder by their desires, internalized homophobia, or fear of being exposed as homosexual. One episode of &quot;Police Woman&quot; earned protests by the National Gay Task Force before it aired for portraying a trio of murderous lesbians who killed retirement home patients for their money. NBC edited the episode because of the protests, but a sit-in was staged in the head of NBC&#x27;s offices.

In the middle of the 1970s, gay men and lesbians began to appear as police officers or detectives facing coming out issues. This did not extend to CBS&#x27; groundbreaking show &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; in 1982, starring two female police detectives. CBS production made conscious attempts to soften the characters so they would not appear to be lesbians. In 1991, a bisexual lawyer portrayed by Amanda Donohoe on &quot;L.A. Law&quot; shared the first significant lesbian kiss on primetime television with Michele Greene, stirring a controversy despite being labeled &quot;chaste&quot; by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;.

Though television did not begin to use recurring homosexual characters until the late 1980s, some early situation comedies used a stock character that author Stephen Tropiano calls &quot;gay-straight&quot;: supporting characters who were quirky, did not comply with gender norms, or had ambiguous personal lives, that &quot;for all purposes &quot;should&quot; be gay&quot;. These included Zelda from &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;, Miss Hathaway from &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, and Jo from &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;. In the mid-1980s through the 1990s, sitcoms frequently employed a &quot;coming out&quot; episode, where a friend of one of the stars admits she is a lesbian, forcing the cast to deal with the issue. &quot;Designing Women&quot;, &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, and &quot;Friends&quot; used this device with women in particular.

Recurring lesbian characters who came out were seen on &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, &quot;Mad About You&quot;, and &quot;Roseanne&quot;, in which a highly publicized episode had ABC executives afraid a televised kiss between Roseanne and Mariel Hemingway would destroy ratings and ruin advertising. The episode was instead the week&#x27;s highest rated. By far the sitcom with the most significant impact to the image of lesbians was &quot;Ellen&quot;. Publicity surrounding Ellen&#x27;s coming out episode in 1997 was enormous; Ellen DeGeneres appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine the week before the airing of &quot;The Puppy Episode&quot; with the headline &quot;Yep, I&#x27;m Gay&quot;. Parties were held in many U.S. cities to watch the episode, and the opposition from conservative organizations was intense. WBMA-LP, the ABC affiliate in Birmingham, Alabama, even refused to air the first run of the episode, citing conservative values of the local viewing audience, which earned the station some infamy and ire in the LGBT community. Even still, &quot;The Puppy Episode&quot; won an Emmy for writing, but as the show began to deal with Ellen Morgan&#x27;s sexuality each week, network executives grew uncomfortable with the direction the show took and canceled it.

Dramas following &quot;L.A. Law&quot; began incorporating homosexual themes, particularly with continuing storylines on &quot;Relativity&quot;, &quot;Picket Fences&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, both of which tested the boundaries of sexuality and gender. A show directed at adolescents that had a particularly strong cult following was &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. In the fourth season of &quot;Buffy&quot;, Tara and Willow admit their love for each other without any special fanfare and the relationship is treated as are the other romantic relationships on the show.

What followed was a series devoted solely to gay characters from network television. Showtime&#x27;s American rendition of &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; ran for five years, from 2000 to 2005; two of the main characters were a lesbian couple. Showtime promoted the series as &quot;No Limits&quot;, and &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; addressed homosexuality graphically. The aggressive advertising paid off as the show became the network&#x27;s highest rated, doubling the numbers of other Showtime programs after the first season. In 2004, Showtime introduced &quot;The L Word&quot;, a dramatic series devoted to a group of lesbian and bisexual women, running its final season in 2009.

==Chic and popular culture==
Lesbian visibility has improved since the early 1980s. This is in part due to public figures who have drawn speculation from the public and comment in the press about their sexuality and lesbianism in general. The primary figure earning this attention was Martina Navratilova, who served as tabloid fodder for years as she denied being lesbian, admitted to being bisexual, had very public relationships with Rita Mae Brown and Judy Nelson, and acquired as much press about her sexuality as she did her athletic achievements. Navratilova spurred what scholar Diane Hamer termed &quot;constant preoccupation&quot; in the press with determining the root of same-sex desire.

Other public figures acknowledged their homosexuality and bisexuality, notably musicians k.d. lang and Melissa Etheridge, and Madonna&#x27;s pushing of sexual boundaries in her performances and publications. In 1993, heterosexual supermodel Cindy Crawford posed for the August cover of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in a provocative arrangement that showed Crawford pretending to shave lang&#x27;s face, as lang lounged in a barber&#x27;s chair wearing a pinstripe suit. The image &quot;became an internationally recognized symbol of the phenomenon of lesbian chic&quot;, according to Hamer. The year 1994 marked a rise in lesbian visibility, particularly appealing to women with feminine appearances. Between 1992 and 1994, &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, and &quot;New York&quot; magazines featured stories about women who admitted sexual histories with other women.

One analyst reasoned the recurrence of lesbian chic was due to the often-used homoerotic subtexts of gay male subculture being considered off-limits because of AIDS in the late 1980s and 1990s, joined with the distant memory of lesbians as they appeared in the 1970s: unattractive and militant. In short, lesbians became more attractive to general audiences when they ceased having political convictions. All the attention on feminine and glamorous women created what culture analyst Rodger Streitmatter characterizes as an unrealistic image of lesbians packaged by heterosexual men; the trend influenced an increase in the inclusion of lesbian material in pornography aimed at men.

A resurgence of lesbian visibility was noted in 2009 when sexually fluid female celebrities, such as Cynthia Nixon and Lindsay Lohan, commented openly about their relationships with women, and reality television addressed same-sex relationships. Psychiatrists and feminist philosophers wrote that the rise in women acknowledging same-sex relationships was due to growing social acceptance, but also conceded that &quot;only a certain kind of lesbian—slim and elegant or butch in just the right androgynous way—is acceptable to mainstream culture.&quot;

==Family and politics==
Although homosexuality among females has taken place in many cultures in history, a recent phenomenon is the development of family among same-sex partners. Before the 1970s, the idea that same-sex adults formed long-term committed relationships was unknown to many people. The majority of lesbians (between 60% and 80%) report being in a long-term relationship. Sociologists credit the high number of paired women to gender role socialization: the inclination for women to commit to relationships doubles in a lesbian union. Unlike heterosexual relationships that tend to divide work based on sex roles, lesbian relationships divide chores evenly between both members. Studies have also reported that emotional bonds are closer in lesbian and gay relationships than heterosexual ones.

Family issues were significant concerns for lesbians when gay activism became more vocal in the 1960s and 1970s. Custody issues in particular were of interest since often courts would not award custody to mothers who were openly homosexual, even though the general procedure acknowledged children were awarded to the biological mother. Several studies performed as a result of custody disputes viewed how children grow up with same-sex parents compared to single mothers who did not identify as lesbians. They found that children&#x27;s mental health, happiness, and overall adjustment is similar to children of divorced women who are not lesbians. Sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex roles of children who grow up with lesbian mothers are unaffected. Differences that were found include the fact that divorced lesbians tend to be living with a partner, fathers visit divorced lesbian mothers more often than divorced nonlesbian mothers, and lesbian mothers report a greater fear of losing their children through legal means.

Improving opportunities for growing families of same-sex couples has shaped the political landscape within the past ten years. A push for same-sex marriage or civil unions in western countries has replaced other political objectives. , ten countries and six U.S. states offer same-sex marriage; civil unions are offered as an option in some European countries, U.S. states and individual municipalities. The ability to adopt domestically or internationally children or provide a home as a foster parent is also a political and family priority for many lesbians, as is improving access to artificial insemination.

==Lesbians of color==
Lesbians of color have often been a marginalized group, including Black, Latina, Asian, Arab, and other non-white lesbians; and experienced racism in addition to homophobia and misogyny.

Some scholars have noted that in the past the predominant lesbian community was largely composed of white women and influenced by American culture, leading some lesbians of color to experience difficulties integrating into the community at large. Many lesbians of color have stated that they were often systematically excluded from lesbian spaces based on the fact that they are women of color. Additionally, these women face a unique set of challenges within their respective racial communities. Many feel abandoned, as communities of color often view homosexual identity as a &quot;white&quot; lifestyle and see the acceptance of homosexuality as a setback in achieving equality.

Lesbians of color, especially those of immigrant populations, often hold the sentiment that their sexual orientation identity adversely affects assimilation into the dominant culture. Historically, women of color were often excluded from participating in lesbian and gay movements. Scholars have stated that this exclusion came as a result of the majority of whites dismissing the intersections of gender, race, and sexuality that are a core part of the lesbian of color identity. Lesbians that organized events were mostly white and middle-class, and largely focused their political movements on the issues of sexism and homophobia, rather than class or race issues. The early lesbian feminist movement was criticized for excluding race and class issues from their spaces and for a lack of focus on issues that did not benefit white women. Audre Lorde, Barbara Smith, and Cherrie Moraga are cited as major theorists within the various lesbians of color movements for their insistence on inclusion and equality, from both racial communities and white lesbian communities.

The many intersections surrounding lesbians of color can often contribute to an increased need for mental health resources. Lesbians of color are more likely to experience a number of psychological issues due to the various experiences of sexism, racism, and homophobia as a part of their existence. Mental health providers, such as therapists, often use heteronormative standards to gauge the health of lesbian relationships, and the relationships of lesbian women of color are often subjects of judgment because they are seen as the most deviant.

Within racial communities, the decision to come out can be costly, as the threat of loss of support from family, friends, and the community at large is probable. Lesbians of color are often exposed to a range of adverse consequences, including microaggression, discrimination, menace, and violence.

<text>Lambda (; uppercase &#x27;, lowercase &#x27;; , &quot;lám(b)da&quot;) is the eleventh letter of the Greek alphabet, representing the voiced alveolar lateral approximant . In the system of Greek numerals, lambda has a value of 30. Lambda is derived from the Phoenician Lamed. Lambda gave rise to the Latin L and the Cyrillic El (Л). The ancient grammarians and dramatists give evidence to the pronunciation as () in Classical Greek times. In Modern Greek, the name of the letter, Λάμδα, is pronounced .

In early Greek alphabets, the shape and orientation of lambda varied. Most variants consisted of two straight strokes, one longer than the other, connected at their ends. The angle might be in the upper-left, lower-left (&quot;Western&quot; alphabets) or top (&quot;Eastern&quot; alphabets). Other variants had a vertical line with a horizontal or sloped stroke running to the right. With the general adoption of the Ionic alphabet, Greek settled on an angle at the top; the Romans put the angle at the lower-left.

==Symbol==

===Upper-case letter Λ===
Examples of the symbolic use of uppercase lambda include:
* The lambda particle is a type of subatomic particle in subatomic particle physics.
* Lambda is the set of logical axioms in the axiomatic method of logical deduction in first-order logic.
* There is a poetical allusion to the use of Lambda as a shield blazon by the Spartans.
* Lambda is the von Mangoldt function in mathematical number theory.
* Lambda denotes the de Bruijn–Newman constant which is closely connected with Riemann&#x27;s hypothesis.
* In statistics, lambda is used for the likelihood ratio.
* In statistics, Wilks&#x27;s lambda is used in multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA analysis) to compare group means on a combination of dependent variables.
* In the spectral decomposition of matrices, lambda indicates the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues of the matrix.
* In computer science, lambda is the time window over which a process is observed for determining the working memory set for a digital computer&#x27;s virtual memory management.
* In astrophysics, lambda represents the likelihood that a small body will encounter a planet or a dwarf planet leading to a deflection of a significant magnitude. An object with a large value of lambda is expected to have cleared its neighbourhood, satisfying the current definition of a planet.
* In crystal optics, lambda is used to represent a lattice period.
* In electrochemistry, lambda denotes the &quot;equivalent conductance&quot; of an electrolyte solution.
* In cosmology, lambda is the symbol for the cosmological constant, a term added to some dynamical equations to account for the accelerating expansion of the universe.
* In optics, lambda denotes the grating pitch of a Bragg reflector. 
* In politics, the lambda is the symbol of Identitarianism, a white nationalist movement that originated in France before spreading out to the rest of Europe and later on to North America, Australia and New Zealand. The Identitarian lambda represents the Battle of Thermopylae.

===Lower-case letter λ===
Examples of the symbolic use of lowercase lambda include:
* λ indicates the wavelength of any wave, especially in physics, electrical engineering, and mathematics.
* In evolutionary algorithms, λ indicates the number of offspring that would be generated from μ current population in each generation. The terms μ and λ are originated from Evolution strategy notation.
* λ indicates the radioactivity decay constant in nuclear physics and radioactivity. This constant is very simply related (by a multiplicative constant) to the half-life of any radioactive material.
* In probability theory, λ represents the density of occurrences within a time interval, as modelled by the Poisson distribution.
* In mathematical logic and computer science, λ is used to introduce anonymous functions expressed with the concepts of lambda calculus.
* λ indicates an eigenvalue in the mathematics of linear algebra.
* In the physics of particles, lambda indicates the thermal de Broglie wavelength
* In the physics of electric fields, lambda sometimes indicates the linear charge density of a uniform line of electric charge (measured in coulombs per meter).
* Lambda denotes a Lagrange multiplier in multi-dimensional calculus.
* In solid-state electronics, lambda indicates the channel length modulation parameter of a MOSFET.
* In ecology, lambda denotes the long-term intrinsic growth rate of a population. This value is often calculated as the dominant eigenvalue of the age/size class matrix.
* In formal language theory and in computer science, lambda denotes the empty string.
* Lambda is a nonstandard symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet for the voiced alveolar lateral affricate .
* Lambda denotes the Lebesgue measure in mathematical set theory.
* The Goodman and Kruskal&#x27;s lambda in statistics indicates the proportional reduction in error when one variable&#x27;s values are used to predict the values of another variable.
* Lambda denotes the oxygen sensor in a vehicle that measures the air-to-fuel ratio in the exhaust gases of an internal-combustion engine.
* A Lambda 4S solid-fuel rocket was used to launch Japan&#x27;s first orbital satellite in 1970.
* Lambda denotes the failure rate of devices and systems in reliability theory, and it is measured in failure events per hour. Numerically, this lambda is also the reciprocal of the mean time between failures.
* In criminology, lambda denotes an individual&#x27;s frequency of offences.
* In electrochemistry, lambda also denotes the ionic conductance of a given ion (the composition of the ion is generally shown as a subscript to the lambda character).
* In neurobiology, lambda denotes the length constant (or exponential rate of decay) of the electric potential across the cell membrane along a length of a nerve cell&#x27;s axon.
* In the science and technology of heat transfer, lambda denotes the heat of vaporization per mole of material (a.k.a. its &quot;latent heat&quot;).
* In the technology and science of celestial navigation, lambda denotes the longitude as opposed to the Roman letter &quot;L&quot;, which denotes the latitude.
* A block style lambda is used as a recurring symbol in the Valve computer game series &quot;Half-Life&quot;, referring to the Lambda Complex of the fictional Black Mesa Research Facility, as well as making appearances in the sequel &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, and its subsequent prequel &quot;Half-Life: Alyx&quot; as an in-universe symbol of resistance.
* In 1970, a lowercase lambda was chosen by Tom Doerr as the symbol of the New York chapter of the Gay Activists Alliance. The lambda symbol became associated with gay liberation and recognized as an LGBTQ symbol for some time afterwards, being used as such by the International Gay Rights Congress in Edinburgh.
* Golomb–Dickman constant

===Litra symbol===
The Roman and Byzantine (), which served as both the pound mass unit and liter volume unit, were abbreviated in Greek using lambda with modified forms of the iota subscript ⟨λͅ⟩. These are variously encoded in Unicode. The Ancient Greek Numbers Unicode block includes 10183 (𐆃) as well as 𐅢, which is described as 10162 but was much more common as a form of the litra sign. A variant of the sign can be formed from 0338 and either 039B (Λ̸) or 03BB (λ̸).

==Unicode==
Unicode uses the (Modern Greek-based) spelling &quot;lamda&quot; in character names, instead of &quot;lambda&quot;, due to &quot;the pre-existing names in ISO 8859-7, as well as preferences expressed by the Greek National Body&quot;. Latin versions of lambda were added to Unicode in 2024 for the Salishan and Wakashan languages in Canada.

<text>The Lamiaceae ( )
or Labiatae are a family of flowering plants commonly known as the mint, deadnettle, or sage family. Many of the plants are aromatic in all parts and include widely used culinary herbs like basil, mint, rosemary, sage, savory, marjoram, oregano, hyssop, thyme, lavender, and perilla, as well as other medicinal herbs such as catnip, salvia, bee balm, wild dagga, and oriental motherwort.

Some species are shrubs, trees (such as teak), or, rarely, vines. Many members of the family are widely cultivated, not only for their aromatic qualities, but also their ease of cultivation, since they are readily propagated by stem cuttings. Besides those grown for their edible leaves, some are grown for decorative foliage. Others are grown for seed, such as &quot;Salvia hispanica&quot; (chia), or for their edible tubers, such as &quot;Plectranthus edulis&quot;, &quot;P. esculentus&quot;, &quot;P. rotundifolius&quot;, and &quot;Stachys affinis&quot; (Chinese artichoke). Many are also grown ornamentally, notably coleus, &quot;Plectranthus&quot;, and many &quot;Salvia&quot; species and hybrids.

The family has a cosmopolitan distribution. The enlarged Lamiaceae contain about 236 genera and have been stated to contain 6,900 to 7,200 species, but the World Checklist lists 7,534. The largest genera are &quot;Salvia&quot; (900), &quot;Scutellaria&quot; (360), &quot;Stachys&quot; (300), &quot;Plectranthus&quot; (300), &quot;Hyptis&quot; (280), &quot;Teucrium&quot; (250), &quot;Vitex&quot; (250), &quot;Thymus&quot; (220), and &quot;Nepeta&quot; (200). &quot;Clerodendrum&quot; was once a genus of over 400 species, but by 2010, it had been narrowed to about 150.

The family has traditionally been considered closely related to the Verbenaceae; in the 1990s, phylogenetic studies suggested that many genera classified in the Verbenaceae should be classified in the Lamiaceae or to other families in the order Lamiales.

The alternative family name Labiatae refers to the flowers typically having petals fused into an upper lip and a lower lip (&quot;&quot; in Latin). Although this is still considered an acceptable alternative name, most botanists now use the name Lamiaceae in referring to this family. The flowers are bilaterally symmetrical with five united petals and five united sepals. They are usually bisexual and verticillastrate (a flower cluster that looks like a whorl of flowers, but actually consists of two crowded clusters). The leaves emerge oppositely, each pair at right angles to the previous one (decussate) or whorled. The stems are frequently square in cross section, but this is not found in all members of the family, and is sometimes found in other plant families.

== Genera ==

The last revision of the entire family was published in 2004. It described and provided keys to 236 genera. These are marked with an asterisk (*) in the list below. A few genera have been established or resurrected since 2004. These are marked with a plus sign (+). Other genera have been synonymised. These are marked with a minus sign (-). The remaining genera in the list are mostly of historical interest only and are from a source that includes such genera without explanation. Few of these are recognized in modern treatments of the family.

Kew Gardens provides a list of genera that includes additional information. A list at the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website is frequently updated. &quot;Plants of the World Online&quot; currently accepts 227 genera.

== Recent changes ==

The circumscription of several genera has changed since 2004. &quot;Tsoongia&quot;, &quot;Paravitex&quot;, and &quot;Viticipremna&quot; have been sunk into synonymy with &quot;Vitex&quot;. &quot;Huxleya&quot; has been sunk into &quot;Volkameria&quot;. &quot;Kalaharia&quot;, &quot;Volkameria&quot;, &quot;Ovieda&quot;, and &quot;Tetraclea&quot; have been segregated from a formerly polyphyletic &quot;Clerodendrum&quot;. &quot;Rydingia&quot; has been separated from &quot;Leucas&quot;. The remaining &quot;Leucas&quot; is paraphyletic over four other genera.

== Subfamilies and tribes ==

In 2004, the Lamiaceae were divided into seven subfamilies, plus 10 genera not placed in any of the subfamilies. The unplaced genera are: &quot;Tectona&quot;, &quot;Callicarpa&quot;, &quot;Hymenopyramis&quot;, &quot;Petraeovitex&quot;, &quot;Peronema&quot;, &quot;Garrettia&quot;, &quot;Cymaria&quot;, &quot;Acrymia&quot;, &quot;Holocheila&quot;, and &quot;Ombrocharis&quot;. The subfamilies are the Symphorematoideae, Viticoideae, Ajugoideae, Prostantheroideae, Nepetoideae, Scutellarioideae, and Lamioideae. The subfamily Viticoideae is probably not monophyletic. The Prostantheroideae and Nepetoideae are divided into tribes. These are shown in the phylogenetic tree below.

== Phylogeny ==

Most of the genera of Lamiaceae have never been sampled for DNA for molecular phylogenetic studies. Most of those that have been are included in the following phylogenetic tree. The phylogeny depicted below is based on seven different sources.

<doc id="17859" wikidata="Q3294287" url="?curid=17859" title="Wide shot">
<text>In photography, filmmaking and video production, a wide shot (sometimes referred to as a full shot or long shot) is a shot that typically shows the entire object or human figure and is usually intended to place it in some relation to its surroundings. These are typically shot now using wide-angle lenses (an approximately 25 mm lens in 35 mm photography and 10 mm lens in 16 mm photography). However, due to sheer distance, establishing shots and extremely wide shots can use almost any camera type.

==History==

This type of filmmaking was a result of filmmakers trying to retain the sense of the viewer watching a play in front of them, as opposed to just a series of pictures.

The wide shot has been used since films have been made as it is a very basic type of cinematography. In 1878, one of the first true motion pictures, &quot;Sallie Gardner at a Gallop&quot;, was released. Even though this wouldn&#x27;t be considered a film in the current motion picture industry, it was a huge step towards complete motion pictures. It is arguable that it is very basic but it still remains that it was displayed as a wide angle as both the rider and horse are fully visible in the frame.

In the 1880s, celluloid photographic film and motion picture cameras became available so more motion pictures could be created in the form of Kinetoscope or through projectors. These early films also maintained a wide angle layout as it was the best way to keep everything visible for the viewer. Once motion pictures became more available in the 1890s, there were public screenings of many different films only being around a minute long, or even less. These films again adhered to the wide shot style. One of the first competitive filming techniques came in the form of the close-up, as George Albert Smith incorporated them into his film &quot;Hove&quot;. Though unconfirmed as the first usage of this method, it is one of the earliest recorded examples. Once the introduction of new framing techniques were introduced, more and more styles were developed and used for the benefits they could provide that wide shots couldn&#x27;t.

In the early 1900s, motion pictures evolved from short, minute long, screenings to becoming full-length motion pictures. More and more cinematic techniques appeared, resulting in the wide shot being less commonly used. However, it still remained as it is almost irreplaceable in what it can achieve. When television entered the home in the 1960s, it was seen as a massive hit to the cinema industry and many saw it as the decline in cinema popularity. This in turn resulted in films having to stay ahead of television by incorporating superior quality than that of a television. This was done by adding color, but importantly it implemented the use of widescreen. This would allow a massive increase in space usable by the director, thus allowing an even wider shot for the viewer to witness more of any given shot.

Modern films will now frequently use the different types of wide shots as they are a staple in filmmaking and are almost impossible to avoid unless deliberately chosen to. In the current climate of films, the technical quality of any given shot will appear with much better clarity which has given life to some incredible shots from modern cinema. Also, given the quality of modern home entertainment mediums such as Blu-ray, 3D and Ultra HD Blu Rays, this has allowed the scope and size of any given frame to encompass more of the scene and environment in greater detail.

==Types==
There are a variety of ways of framing that are considered as being wide shots; these include:
;Wide shot (WS): The subject comfortably takes up the whole frame. In the case of a person, head to toe. This usually achieves a clear physical representation of a character and can describe the surroundings as it is usually visible within the frame. This results in the audience having a desired (by the director) view/opinion of the character or location. 
;Very wide shot (VWS): The subject is only just visible in the location. This can find a balance between a &quot;wide shot&quot; and an &quot;extreme wide shot&quot; by keeping an emphasis on both the characters and the environment, almost finding a harmony between the two of them. This enables the ability to use the benefits of both types, by allowing the scale of the environment but also maintaining an element of focus on the character(s) or object(s) in frame.
;Extreme wide shot (EWS): The shot is so far away from the subject that they are no longer visible. This is used to create a sense of a character being lost or almost engulfed by the sheer size of their surroundings. This can result in a character being made small or insignificant due to their situation and/or surroundings.
;Establishing shot (ES): A shot typically used to display a location and is usually the first shot in a new scene. These establish the setting of a film, whether that is the physical location or the time period. Mainly it gives a sense of place to the film and brings the viewer to wherever the story requires them to be.
;Master shot (MS): This shot can be commonly mistaken for an establishing shot as it displays key characters and locations. However, it is actually a shot in which all relevant characters are in frame (usually for the whole duration of the scene), with inter-cut shots of other characters to shift focus. This is a very useful method for retaining audience focus as most shots in this style refrain from using cuts and therefore will keep the performances and the dialogue in the forefront of what is going on for the duration of the scene.

==Notable examples==
Many directors are known for their use of the variety of wide shots. A key example of them is the frequent use of establishing shots and very wide shots in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, showing the vast New Zealand landscape to instil awe in the audience.

In the 1993 film &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, there is a running image of a small girl trapped within a concentration camp wearing a red coat (the only colour in the film). She is frequently pictured in a wide shot format as a way to display both her and the horrific surroundings to build a disturbing contrast.

In the 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, a very wide shot is used that keeps all the protagonists on screen with the Wizard&#x27;s palace in clear view. &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; was also one of the first mainstream motion pictures to include colour.

The 1962 &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; contains an enormous number of extreme wide shots which successfully induced the feeling of scale of the lead in his surrounding and aesthetically dwarfed him due to his surroundings making him seem more vulnerable and weak.

The 1981 film &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; contains the use of a wide shot to show the dangerous scale of a boulder that is chasing the protagonist.

The 2008 film &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; featured a practical stunt in which a large truck and trailer are flipped nose first. This is shot very far back to give the shot more clarity and to see the flip through its entirety as opposed to cutting midway through.

In the 2015 Ridley Scott film &quot;The Martian&quot;, the protagonist Mark Watney is stranded on Mars and the film contains many wide shots. These are used to show the Martian landscape and give the character the sense of isolation that the film would want.

<text>In mathematics, the logarithm of a number is the exponent by which another fixed value, the base, must be raised to produce that number. For example, the logarithm of to base is , because is to the rd power: . More generally, if , then is the logarithm of to base , written , so . As a single-variable function, the logarithm to base is the inverse of exponentiation with base .

The logarithm base is called the &quot;decimal&quot; or &quot;common&quot; logarithm and is commonly used in science and engineering. The &quot;natural&quot; logarithm has the number  as its base; its use is widespread in mathematics and physics because of its very simple derivative. The &quot;binary&quot; logarithm uses base and is widely used in computer science, information theory, music theory, and photography. When the base is unambiguous from the context or irrelevant it is often omitted, and the logarithm is written .

Logarithms were introduced by John Napier in 1614 as a means of simplifying calculations. They were rapidly adopted by navigators, scientists, engineers, surveyors, and others to perform high-accuracy computations more easily. Using logarithm tables, tedious multi-digit multiplication steps can be replaced by table look-ups and simpler addition. This is possible because the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the factors:
formula_1
provided that , and are all positive and . The slide rule, also based on logarithms, allows quick calculations without tables, but at lower precision. The present-day notion of logarithms comes from Leonhard Euler, who connected them to the exponential function in the 18th century, and who also introduced the letter as the base of natural logarithms.

Logarithmic scales reduce wide-ranging quantities to smaller scopes. For example, the decibel (dB) is a unit used to express ratio as logarithms, mostly for signal power and amplitude (of which sound pressure is a common example). In chemistry, pH is a logarithmic measure for the acidity of an aqueous solution. Logarithms are commonplace in scientific formulae, and in measurements of the complexity of algorithms and of geometric objects called fractals. They help to describe frequency ratios of musical intervals, appear in formulas counting prime numbers or approximating factorials, inform some models in psychophysics, and can aid in forensic accounting.

The concept of logarithm as the inverse of exponentiation extends to other mathematical structures as well. However, in general settings, the logarithm tends to be a multi-valued function. For example, the complex logarithm is the multi-valued inverse of the complex exponential function. Similarly, the discrete logarithm is the multi-valued inverse of the exponential function in finite groups; it has uses in public-key cryptography.

==Motivation==

Addition, multiplication, and exponentiation are three of the most fundamental arithmetic operations. The inverse of addition is subtraction, and the inverse of multiplication is division. Similarly, a logarithm is the inverse operation of exponentiation. Exponentiation is when a number , the &quot;base&quot;, is raised to a certain power , the &quot;exponent&quot;, to give a value ; this is denoted
formula_2
For example, raising to the power of gives : formula_3

The logarithm of base is the inverse operation, that provides the output from the input . That is, formula_4 is equivalent to formula_5 if is a positive real number. (If is not a positive real number, both exponentiation and logarithm can be defined but may take several values, which makes definitions much more complicated.)

One of the main historical motivations of introducing logarithms is the formula 
formula_6
by which tables of logarithms allow multiplication and division to be reduced to addition and subtraction, a great aid to calculations before the invention of computers.

==Definition==
Given a positive real number such that , the &quot;logarithm&quot; of a positive real number with respect to base  is the exponent by which must be raised to yield . In other words, the logarithm of to base  is the unique real number  such that formula_7.

The logarithm is denoted &quot;&quot; (pronounced as &quot;the logarithm of to base &quot;, &quot;the logarithm of &quot;, or most commonly &quot;the log, base , of &quot;).

An equivalent and more succinct definition is that the function is the inverse function to the function formula_8.

===Examples===
* , since .
* Logarithms can also be negative: formula_9 since formula_10
* is approximately 2.176, which lies between 2 and 3, just as 150 lies between and .
* For any base , and , since and , respectively.

==Logarithmic identities==
Several important formulas, sometimes called &quot;logarithmic identities&quot; or &quot;logarithmic laws&quot;, relate logarithms to one another.

===Product, quotient, power, and root===
The logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the numbers being multiplied; the logarithm of the ratio of two numbers is the difference of the logarithms. The logarithm of the -th power of a number is  times the logarithm of the number itself; the logarithm of a -th root is the logarithm of the number divided by . The following table lists these identities with examples. Each of the identities can be derived after substitution of the logarithm definitions formula_11 or formula_12 in the left hand sides.

===Change of base===
The logarithm can be computed from the logarithms of and with respect to an arbitrary base  using the following formula:
formula_13

Typical scientific calculators calculate the logarithms to bases 10 and . Logarithms with respect to any base  can be determined using either of these two logarithms by the previous formula:
formula_14

Given a number and its logarithm to an unknown base , the base is given by:

formula_15

which can be seen from taking the defining equation formula_16 to the power of formula_17

==Particular bases==
Among all choices for the base, three are particularly common. These are , (the irrational mathematical constant and (the binary logarithm). In mathematical analysis, the logarithm base is widespread because of analytical properties explained below. On the other hand, logarithms (the common logarithm) are easy to use for manual calculations in the decimal number system:

formula_18

Thus, is related to the number of decimal digits of a positive integer : The number of digits is the smallest integer strictly bigger than 
For example, is approximately 3.78 . The next integer above it is 4, which is the number of digits of 5986. Both the natural logarithm and the binary logarithm are used in information theory, corresponding to the use of nats or bits as the fundamental units of information, respectively.
Binary logarithms are also used in computer science, where the binary system is ubiquitous; in music theory, where a pitch ratio of two (the octave) is ubiquitous and the number of cents between any two pitches is a scaled version of the binary logarithm, or log 2 times 1200, of the pitch ratio (that is, 100 cents per semitone in conventional equal temperament), or equivalently the log base and in photography rescaled base 2 logarithms are used to measure exposure values, light levels, exposure times, lens apertures, and film speeds in &quot;stops&quot;.

The abbreviation is often used when the intended base can be inferred based on the context or discipline, or when the base is indeterminate or immaterial. Common logarithms (base 10), historically used in logarithm tables and slide rules, are a basic tool for measurement and computation in many areas of science and engineering; in these contexts still often means the base ten logarithm. In mathematics usually refers to the natural logarithm (base ).
In computer science and information theory, often refers to binary logarithms (base 2). The following table lists common notations for logarithms to these bases. The &quot;ISO notation&quot; column lists designations suggested by the International Organization for Standardization.

==History==

The history of logarithms in seventeenth-century Europe saw the discovery of a new function that extended the realm of analysis beyond the scope of algebraic methods. The method of logarithms was publicly propounded by John Napier in 1614, in a book titled &quot;Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio&quot; (&quot;Description of the Wonderful Canon of Logarithms&quot;). Prior to Napier&#x27;s invention, there had been other techniques of similar scopes, such as the prosthaphaeresis or the use of tables of progressions, extensively developed by Jost Bürgi around 1600. Napier coined the term for logarithm in Middle Latin, , literally meaning , derived from the Greek + .

The common logarithm of a number is the index of that power of ten which equals the number. Speaking of a number as requiring so many figures is a rough allusion to common logarithm, and was referred to by Archimedes as the &quot;order of a number&quot;. The first real logarithms were heuristic methods to turn multiplication into addition, thus facilitating rapid computation. Some of these methods used tables derived from trigonometric identities. Such methods are called prosthaphaeresis.

Invention of the function now known as the natural logarithm began as an attempt to perform a quadrature of a rectangular hyperbola by Grégoire de Saint-Vincent, a Belgian Jesuit residing in Prague. Archimedes had written &quot;The Quadrature of the Parabola&quot; in the third century BC, but a quadrature for the hyperbola eluded all efforts until Saint-Vincent published his results in 1647. The relation that the logarithm provides between a geometric progression in its argument and an arithmetic progression of values, prompted A. A. de Sarasa to make the connection of Saint-Vincent&#x27;s quadrature and the tradition of logarithms in prosthaphaeresis, leading to the term &quot;hyperbolic logarithm&quot;, a synonym for natural logarithm. Soon the new function was appreciated by Christiaan Huygens, and James Gregory. The notation was adopted by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1675, and the next year he connected it to the integral formula_19

Before Euler developed his modern conception of complex natural logarithms, Roger Cotes had a nearly equivalent result when he showed in 1714 that
formula_20

==Logarithm tables, slide rules, and historical applications==
By simplifying difficult calculations before calculators and computers became available, logarithms contributed to the advance of science, especially astronomy. They were critical to advances in surveying, celestial navigation, and other domains. Pierre-Simon Laplace called logarithms

::&quot;...[a]n admirable artifice which, by reducing to a few days the labour of many months, doubles the life of the astronomer, and spares him the errors and disgust inseparable from long calculations.&quot;

As the function is the inverse function of , it has been called an antilogarithm. Nowadays, this function is more commonly called an exponential function. 

===Log tables===
A key tool that enabled the practical use of logarithms was the &quot;table of logarithms&quot;. The first such table was compiled by Henry Briggs in 1617, immediately after Napier&#x27;s invention but with the innovation of using 10 as the base. Briggs&#x27; first table contained the common logarithms of all integers in the range from 1 to 1000, with a precision of 14 digits. Subsequently, tables with increasing scope were written. These tables listed the values of for any number  in a certain range, at a certain precision. Base-10 logarithms were universally used for computation, hence the name common logarithm, since numbers that differ by factors of 10 have logarithms that differ by integers. The common logarithm of can be separated into an integer part and a fractional part, known as the characteristic and mantissa. Tables of logarithms need only include the mantissa, as the characteristic can be easily determined by counting digits from the decimal point. The characteristic of is one plus the characteristic of , and their mantissas are the same. Thus using a three-digit log table, the logarithm of 3542 is approximated by

formula_21

Greater accuracy can be obtained by interpolation:

formula_22

The value of can be determined by reverse look up in the same table, since the logarithm is a monotonic function.

===Computations===
The product and quotient of two positive numbers and &quot;&quot; were routinely calculated as the sum and difference of their logarithms. The product  or quotient  came from looking up the antilogarithm of the sum or difference, via the same table:

formula_23
and
formula_24

For manual calculations that demand any appreciable precision, performing the lookups of the two logarithms, calculating their sum or difference, and looking up the antilogarithm is much faster than performing the multiplication by earlier methods such as prosthaphaeresis, which relies on trigonometric identities.

Calculations of powers and roots are reduced to multiplications or divisions and lookups by
formula_25

and
formula_26

Trigonometric calculations were facilitated by tables that contained the common logarithms of trigonometric functions.

===Slide rules===

Another critical application was the slide rule, a pair of logarithmically divided scales used for calculation. The non-sliding logarithmic scale, Gunter&#x27;s rule, was invented shortly after Napier&#x27;s invention. William Oughtred enhanced it to create the slide rule—a pair of logarithmic scales movable with respect to each other. Numbers are placed on sliding scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms. Sliding the upper scale appropriately amounts to mechanically adding logarithms, as illustrated here:

For example, adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower scale to the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale yields a product of 6, which is read off at the lower part. The slide rule was an essential calculating tool for engineers and scientists until the 1970s, because it allows, at the expense of precision, much faster computation than techniques based on tables.

==Analytic properties==
A deeper study of logarithms requires the concept of a &quot;function&quot;. A function is a rule that, given one number, produces another number. An example is the function producing the -th power of from any real number , where the base  is a fixed number. This function is written as . When is positive and unequal to 1, we show below that is invertible when considered as a function from the reals to the positive reals.

===Existence===
Let be a positive real number not equal to 1 and let .

It is a standard result in real analysis that any continuous strictly monotonic function is bijective between its domain and range. This fact follows from the intermediate value theorem. Now, is strictly increasing (for ), or strictly decreasing (for ), is continuous, has domain formula_27, and has range formula_28. Therefore, is a bijection from formula_27 to formula_30. In other words, for each positive real number , there is exactly one real number such that formula_31.

We let formula_32 denote the inverse of . That is, is the unique real number such that formula_31. This function is called the base- &quot;logarithm function&quot; or &quot;logarithmic function&quot; (or just &quot;logarithm&quot;).

=== Characterization by the product formula ===
The function can also be essentially characterized by the product formula
formula_34
More precisely, the logarithm to any base is the only increasing function &quot;f&quot; from the positive reals to the reals satisfying andformula_35

===Graph of the logarithm function===

As discussed above, the function is the inverse to the exponential function formula_8. Therefore, their graphs correspond to each other upon exchanging the - and the -coordinates (or upon reflection at the diagonal line ), as shown at the right: a point on the graph of yields a point on the graph of the logarithm and vice versa. As a consequence, diverges to infinity (gets bigger than any given number) if grows to infinity, provided that is greater than one. In that case, is an increasing function. For , tends to minus infinity instead. When approaches zero, goes to minus infinity for (plus infinity for , respectively).

===Derivative and antiderivative===

Analytic properties of functions pass to their inverses. Thus, as is a continuous and differentiable function, so is . Roughly, a continuous function is differentiable if its graph has no sharp &quot;corners&quot;. Moreover, as the derivative of evaluates to by the properties of the exponential function, the chain rule implies that the derivative of is given by
formula_37
That is, the slope of the tangent touching the graph of the logarithm at the point equals .

The derivative of is ; this implies that is the unique antiderivative of that has the value 0 for . It is this very simple formula that motivated to qualify as &quot;natural&quot; the natural logarithm; this is also one of the main reasons of the importance of the constant.

The derivative with a generalized functional argument is
formula_38
The quotient at the right hand side is called the logarithmic derivative of &quot;&quot;. Computing by means of the derivative of is known as logarithmic differentiation. The antiderivative of the natural logarithm is:
formula_39
Related formulas, such as antiderivatives of logarithms to other bases can be derived from this equation using the change of bases.

===Integral representation of the natural logarithm===

The natural logarithm of can be defined as the definite integral:

formula_40
This definition has the advantage that it does not rely on the exponential function or any trigonometric functions; the definition is in terms of an integral of a simple reciprocal. As an integral, equals the area between the -axis and the graph of the function , ranging from to . This is a consequence of the fundamental theorem of calculus and the fact that the derivative of is . Product and power logarithm formulas can be derived from this definition. For example, the product formula is deduced as:

formula_41

The equality (1) splits the integral into two parts, while the equality (2) is a change of variable (). In the illustration below, the splitting corresponds to dividing the area into the yellow and blue parts. Rescaling the left hand blue area vertically by the factor  and shrinking it by the same factor horizontally does not change its size. Moving it appropriately, the area fits the graph of the function again. Therefore, the left hand blue area, which is the integral of from to is the same as the integral from 1 to . This justifies the equality (2) with a more geometric proof.

The power formula may be derived in a similar way:

formula_42
The second equality uses a change of variables (integration by substitution), .

The sum over the reciprocals of natural numbers,
formula_43
is called the harmonic series. It is closely tied to the natural logarithm: as tends to infinity, the difference,
formula_44
converges (i.e. gets arbitrarily close) to a number known as the Euler–Mascheroni constant . This relation aids in analyzing the performance of algorithms such as quicksort.

===Transcendence of the logarithm===
Real numbers that are not algebraic are called transcendental; for example,  and &quot;e&quot; are such numbers, but formula_45 is not. Almost all real numbers are transcendental. The logarithm is an example of a transcendental function. The Gelfond–Schneider theorem asserts that logarithms usually take transcendental, i.e. &quot;difficult&quot; values.

==Calculation==

Logarithms are easy to compute in some cases, such as . In general, logarithms can be calculated using power series or the arithmetic–geometric mean, or be retrieved from a precalculated logarithm table that provides a fixed precision. Newton&#x27;s method, an iterative method to solve equations approximately, can also be used to calculate the logarithm, because its inverse function, the exponential function, can be computed efficiently. Using look-up tables, CORDIC-like methods can be used to compute logarithms by using only the operations of addition and bit shifts. Moreover, the binary logarithm algorithm calculates recursively, based on repeated squarings of , taking advantage of the relation
formula_46

===Power series===
====Taylor series====
For any real number that satisfies , the following formula holds:

formula_47

Equating the function to this infinite sum (series) is shorthand for saying that the function can be approximated to a more and more accurate value by the following expressions (known as partial sums):

formula_48

For example, with the third approximation yields , which is about greater than , and the ninth approximation yields , which is only about greater. The th partial sum can approximate with arbitrary precision, provided the number of summands is large enough.

In elementary calculus, the series is said to converge to the function , and the function is the limit of the series. It is the Taylor series of the natural logarithm at . The Taylor series of provides a particularly useful approximation to when is small, , since then
formula_49

For example, with the first-order approximation gives , which is less than off the correct value .

====Inverse hyperbolic tangent====
Another series is based on the inverse hyperbolic tangent function:
formula_50
for any real number . Using sigma notation, this is also written as
formula_51
This series can be derived from the above Taylor series. It converges quicker than the Taylor series, especially if is close to 1. For example, for , the first three terms of the second series approximate with an error of about . The quick convergence for close to 1 can be taken advantage of in the following way: given a low-accuracy approximation and putting
formula_52
the logarithm of is:
formula_53
The better the initial approximation is, the closer is to 1, so its logarithm can be calculated efficiently. can be calculated using the exponential series, which converges quickly provided is not too large. Calculating the logarithm of larger can be reduced to smaller values of by writing , so that .

A closely related method can be used to compute the logarithm of integers. Putting formula_54 in the above series, it follows that:
formula_55
If the logarithm of a large integer  is known, then this series yields a fast converging series for , with a rate of convergence of formula_56.

===Arithmetic–geometric mean approximation===
The arithmetic–geometric mean yields high-precision approximations of the natural logarithm. Sasaki and Kanada showed in 1982 that it was particularly fast for precisions between 400 and 1000 decimal places, while Taylor series methods were typically faster when less precision was needed. In their work is approximated to a precision of (or  precise bits) by the following formula (due to Carl Friedrich Gauss):

formula_57

Here denotes the arithmetic–geometric mean of and . It is obtained by repeatedly calculating the average (arithmetic mean) and formula_58 (geometric mean) of and then let those two numbers become the next and . The two numbers quickly converge to a common limit which is the value of . is chosen such that

formula_59

to ensure the required precision. A larger makes the calculation take more steps (the initial and are farther apart so it takes more steps to converge) but gives more precision. The constants and can be calculated with quickly converging series.

===Feynman&#x27;s algorithm===
While at Los Alamos National Laboratory working on the Manhattan Project, Richard Feynman developed a bit-processing algorithm to compute the logarithm that is similar to long division and was later used in the Connection Machine. The algorithm relies on the fact that every real number where can be represented as a product of distinct factors of the form . The algorithm sequentially builds that product , starting with and : if , then it changes to . It then increases formula_60 by one regardless. The algorithm stops when is large enough to give the desired accuracy. Because is the sum of the terms of the form corresponding to those for which the factor was included in the product , may be computed by simple addition, using a table of for all . Any base may be used for the logarithm table.

==Applications==

Logarithms have many applications inside and outside mathematics. Some of these occurrences are related to the notion of scale invariance. For example, each chamber of the shell of a nautilus is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor. This gives rise to a logarithmic spiral. Benford&#x27;s law on the distribution of leading digits can also be explained by scale invariance. Logarithms are also linked to self-similarity. For example, logarithms appear in the analysis of algorithms that solve a problem by dividing it into two similar smaller problems and patching their solutions. The dimensions of self-similar geometric shapes, that is, shapes whose parts resemble the overall picture are also based on logarithms. Logarithmic scales are useful for quantifying the relative change of a value as opposed to its absolute difference. Moreover, because the logarithmic function grows very slowly for large , logarithmic scales are used to compress large-scale scientific data. Logarithms also occur in numerous scientific formulas, such as the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, the Fenske equation, or the Nernst equation.

===Logarithmic scale===
Scientific quantities are often expressed as logarithms of other quantities, using a &quot;logarithmic scale&quot;. For example, the decibel is a unit of measurement associated with logarithmic-scale quantities. It is based on the common logarithm of ratios—10 times the common logarithm of a power ratio or 20 times the common logarithm of a voltage ratio. It is used to quantify the attenuation or amplification of electrical signals, to describe power levels of sounds in acoustics, and the absorbance of light in the fields of spectrometry and optics. The signal-to-noise ratio describing the amount of unwanted noise in relation to a (meaningful) signal is also measured in decibels. In a similar vein, the peak signal-to-noise ratio is commonly used to assess the quality of sound and image compression methods using the logarithm.

The strength of an earthquake is measured by taking the common logarithm of the energy emitted at the quake. This is used in the moment magnitude scale or the Richter magnitude scale. For example, a 5.0 earthquake releases 32 times and a 6.0 releases 1000 times the energy of a 4.0. Apparent magnitude measures the brightness of stars logarithmically. In chemistry the negative of the decimal logarithm, the decimal , is indicated by the letter p. For instance, pH is the decimal cologarithm of the activity of hydronium ions (the form hydrogen ions take in water). The activity of hydronium ions in neutral water is 10−7 mol·L−1, hence a pH of 7. Vinegar typically has a pH of about 3. The difference of 4 corresponds to a ratio of 104 of the activity, that is, vinegar&#x27;s hydronium ion activity is about .

Semilog (log–linear) graphs use the logarithmic scale concept for visualization: one axis, typically the vertical one, is scaled logarithmically. For example, the chart at the right compresses the steep increase from 1 million to 1 trillion to the same space (on the vertical axis) as the increase from 1 to 1 million. In such graphs, exponential functions of the form appear as straight lines with slope equal to the logarithm of . Log-log graphs scale both axes logarithmically, which causes functions of the form to be depicted as straight lines with slope equal to the exponent . This is applied in visualizing and analyzing power laws.

===Psychology===
Logarithms occur in several laws describing human perception: Hick&#x27;s law proposes a logarithmic relation between the time individuals take to choose an alternative and the number of choices they have. Fitts&#x27;s law predicts that the time required to rapidly move to a target area is a logarithmic function of the ratio between the distance to a target and the size of the target. In psychophysics, the Weber–Fechner law proposes a logarithmic relationship between stimulus and sensation such as the actual vs. the perceived weight of an item a person is carrying. (This &quot;law&quot;, however, is less realistic than more recent models, such as Stevens&#x27;s power law.)

Psychological studies found that individuals with little mathematics education tend to estimate quantities logarithmically, that is, they position a number on an unmarked line according to its logarithm, so that 10 is positioned as close to 100 as 100 is to 1000. Increasing education shifts this to a linear estimate (positioning 1000 10 times as far away) in some circumstances, while logarithms are used when the numbers to be plotted are difficult to plot linearly.

===Probability theory and statistics===

Logarithms arise in probability theory: the law of large numbers dictates that, for a fair coin, as the number of coin-tosses increases to infinity, the observed proportion of heads approaches one-half. The fluctuations of this proportion about one-half are described by the law of the iterated logarithm.

Logarithms also occur in log-normal distributions. When the logarithm of a random variable has a normal distribution, the variable is said to have a log-normal distribution. Log-normal distributions are encountered in many fields, wherever a variable is formed as the product of many independent positive random variables, for example in the study of turbulence.

Logarithms are used for maximum-likelihood estimation of parametric statistical models. For such a model, the likelihood function depends on at least one parameter that must be estimated. A maximum of the likelihood function occurs at the same parameter-value as a maximum of the logarithm of the likelihood (the &quot;log likelihood&quot;), because the logarithm is an increasing function. The log-likelihood is easier to maximize, especially for the multiplied likelihoods for independent random variables.

Benford&#x27;s law describes the occurrence of digits in many data sets, such as heights of buildings. According to Benford&#x27;s law, the probability that the first decimal-digit of an item in the data sample is (from 1 to 9) equals , &quot;regardless&quot; of the unit of measurement. Thus, about 30% of the data can be expected to have 1 as first digit, 18% start with 2, etc. Auditors examine deviations from Benford&#x27;s law to detect fraudulent accounting.

The logarithm transformation is a type of data transformation used to bring the empirical distribution closer to the assumed one.

===Computational complexity===
Analysis of algorithms is a branch of computer science that studies the performance of algorithms (computer programs solving a certain problem). Logarithms are valuable for describing algorithms that divide a problem into smaller ones, and join the solutions of the subproblems.

For example, to find a number in a sorted list, the binary search algorithm checks the middle entry and proceeds with the half before or after the middle entry if the number is still not found. This algorithm requires, on average, comparisons, where is the list&#x27;s length. Similarly, the merge sort algorithm sorts an unsorted list by dividing the list into halves and sorting these first before merging the results. Merge sort algorithms typically require a time approximately proportional to . The base of the logarithm is not specified here, because the result only changes by a constant factor when another base is used. A constant factor is usually disregarded in the analysis of algorithms under the standard uniform cost model.

A function  is said to grow logarithmically if is (exactly or approximately) proportional to the logarithm of . (Biological descriptions of organism growth, however, use this term for an exponential function.) For example, any natural number  can be represented in binary form in no more than  bits. In other words, the amount of memory needed to store grows logarithmically with .

===Entropy and chaos===
Entropy is broadly a measure of the disorder of some system. In statistical thermodynamics, the entropy  of some physical system is defined as
formula_61
The sum is over all possible states  of the system in question, such as the positions of gas particles in a container. Moreover, is the probability that the state  is attained and is the Boltzmann constant. Similarly, entropy in information theory measures the quantity of information. If a message recipient may expect any one of possible messages with equal likelihood, then the amount of information conveyed by any one such message is quantified as bits.

Lyapunov exponents use logarithms to gauge the degree of chaoticity of a dynamical system. For example, for a particle moving on an oval billiard table, even small changes of the initial conditions result in very different paths of the particle. Such systems are chaotic in a deterministic way, because small measurement errors of the initial state predictably lead to largely different final states. At least one Lyapunov exponent of a deterministically chaotic system is positive.

===Fractals===
Logarithms occur in definitions of the dimension of fractals. Fractals are geometric objects that are self-similar in the sense that small parts reproduce, at least roughly, the entire global structure. The Sierpinski triangle (pictured) can be covered by three copies of itself, each having sides half the original length. This makes the Hausdorff dimension of this structure . Another logarithm-based notion of dimension is obtained by counting the number of boxes needed to cover the fractal in question.

===Music===
Logarithms are related to musical tones and intervals. In equal temperament tunings, the frequency ratio depends only on the interval between two tones, not on the specific frequency, or pitch, of the individual tones. In the 12-tone equal temperament tuning common in modern Western music, each octave (doubling of frequency) is broken into twelve equally spaced intervals called semitones. For example, if the note &quot;A&quot; has a frequency of 440 Hz then the note &quot;B-flat&quot; has a frequency of 466 Hz. The interval between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B-flat&quot; is a semitone, as is the one between &quot;B-flat&quot; and &quot;B&quot; (frequency 493 Hz). Accordingly, the frequency ratios agree:
formula_62

Intervals between arbitrary pitches can be measured in octaves by taking the logarithm of the frequency ratio, can be measured in equally tempered semitones by taking the logarithm ( times the logarithm), or can be measured in cents, hundredths of a semitone, by taking the logarithm ( times the logarithm). The latter is used for finer encoding, as it is needed for finer measurements or non-equal temperaments.

===Number theory===
Natural logarithms are closely linked to counting prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...), an important topic in number theory. For any integer , the quantity of prime numbers less than or equal to is denoted . The prime number theorem asserts that is approximately given by
formula_63
in the sense that the ratio of and that fraction approaches 1 when tends to infinity. As a consequence, the probability that a randomly chosen number between 1 and is prime is inversely proportional to the number of decimal digits of . A far better estimate of is given by the offset logarithmic integral function , defined by
formula_64
The Riemann hypothesis, one of the oldest open mathematical conjectures, can be stated in terms of comparing and . The Erdős–Kac theorem describing the number of distinct prime factors also involves the natural logarithm.

The logarithm of &quot;n&quot; factorial, , is given by
formula_65
This can be used to obtain Stirling&#x27;s formula, an approximation of for large .

==Generalizations==

===Complex logarithm===

All the complex numbers that solve the equation

formula_66

are called &quot;complex logarithms&quot; of , when is (considered as) a complex number. A complex number is commonly represented as , where and are real numbers and is an imaginary unit, the square of which is −1. Such a number can be visualized by a point in the complex plane, as shown at the right. The polar form encodes a non-zero complex number  by its absolute value, that is, the (positive, real) distance  to the origin, and an angle between the real () axis&quot; &quot; and the line passing through both the origin and . This angle is called the argument of .

The absolute value of is given by

formula_67

Using the geometrical interpretation of sine and cosine and their periodicity in , any complex number  may be denoted as

formula_68

for any integer number . Evidently the argument of is not uniquely specified: both and are valid arguments of for all integers , because adding  radians or &quot;k&quot;⋅360° to corresponds to &quot;winding&quot; around the origin counter-clock-wise by  turns. The resulting complex number is always , as illustrated at the right for . One may select exactly one of the possible arguments of as the so-called &quot;principal argument&quot;, denoted , with a capital , by requiring to belong to one, conveniently selected turn, e.g. or . These regions, where the argument of is uniquely determined are called &quot;branches&quot; of the argument function.

Euler&#x27;s formula connects the trigonometric functions sine and cosine to the complex exponential:
formula_69

Using this formula, and again the periodicity, the following identities hold:

formula_70

where is the unique real natural logarithm, denote the complex logarithms of , and is an arbitrary integer. Therefore, the complex logarithms of , which are all those complex values for which the  power of equals , are the infinitely many values
formula_71
for arbitrary integers .

Taking such that is within the defined interval for the principal arguments, then is called the &quot;principal value&quot; of the logarithm, denoted , again with a capital . The principal argument of any positive real number  is 0; hence is a real number and equals the real (natural) logarithm. However, the above formulas for logarithms of products and powers do generalize to the principal value of the complex logarithm.

The illustration at the right depicts , confining the arguments of to the interval . This way the corresponding branch of the complex logarithm has discontinuities all along the negative real  axis, which can be seen in the jump in the hue there. This discontinuity arises from jumping to the other boundary in the same branch, when crossing a boundary, i.e. not changing to the corresponding -value of the continuously neighboring branch. Such a locus is called a branch cut. Dropping the range restrictions on the argument makes the relations &quot;argument of &quot;, and consequently the &quot;logarithm of &quot;, multi-valued functions.

===Inverses of other exponential functions===
Exponentiation occurs in many areas of mathematics and its inverse function is often referred to as the logarithm. For example, the logarithm of a matrix is the (multi-valued) inverse function of the matrix exponential. Another example is the &quot;p&quot;-adic logarithm, the inverse function of the &quot;p&quot;-adic exponential. Both are defined via Taylor series analogous to the real case. In the context of differential geometry, the exponential map maps the tangent space at a point of a manifold to a neighborhood of that point. Its inverse is also called the logarithmic (or log) map.

In the context of finite groups exponentiation is given by repeatedly multiplying one group element  with itself. The discrete logarithm is the integer &quot;&quot; solving the equation
formula_72
where is an element of the group. Carrying out the exponentiation can be done efficiently, but the discrete logarithm is believed to be very hard to calculate in some groups. This asymmetry has important applications in public key cryptography, such as for example in the Diffie–Hellman key exchange, a routine that allows secure exchanges of cryptographic keys over unsecured information channels. Zech&#x27;s logarithm is related to the discrete logarithm in the multiplicative group of non-zero elements of a finite field.

Further logarithm-like inverse functions include the &quot;double logarithm&quot; , the &quot;super- or hyper-4-logarithm&quot; (a slight variation of which is called iterated logarithm in computer science), the Lambert W function, and the logit. They are the inverse functions of the double exponential function, tetration, of , and of the logistic function, respectively.

===Related concepts===
From the perspective of group theory, the identity expresses a group isomorphism between positive reals under multiplication and reals under addition. Logarithmic functions are the only continuous isomorphisms between these groups. By means of that isomorphism, the Haar measure (Lebesgue measure)  on the reals corresponds to the Haar measure  on the positive reals. The non-negative reals not only have a multiplication, but also have addition, and form a semiring, called the probability semiring; this is in fact a semifield. The logarithm then takes multiplication to addition (log multiplication), and takes addition to log addition (LogSumExp), giving an isomorphism of semirings between the probability semiring and the log semiring.

Logarithmic one-forms appear in complex analysis and algebraic geometry as differential forms with logarithmic poles.

The polylogarithm is the function defined by
formula_73
It is related to the natural logarithm by . Moreover, equals the Riemann zeta function .

<text>Lafayette Ronald Hubbard (March 13, 1911 – January 24, 1986) was an American author and the founder of Scientology. A prolific writer of pulp science fiction and fantasy novels in his early career, in 1950 he authored &quot;&quot; and established organizations to promote and practice Dianetics techniques. Hubbard created Scientology in 1952 after losing the intellectual rights to his literature on Dianetics in bankruptcy. He would lead the Church of Scientologyvariously described as a cult, a new religious movement, or a businessuntil his death in 1986.

Born in Tilden, Nebraska, in 1911, Hubbard spent much of his childhood in Helena, Montana. While his father was posted to the U.S. naval base on Guam in the late 1920s, Hubbard traveled to Asia and the South Pacific. In 1930, Hubbard enrolled at George Washington University to study civil engineering but dropped out in his second year. He began his career as an author of pulp fiction and married Margaret Grubb, who shared his interest in aviation.

Hubbard was an officer in the Navy during World War II, where he briefly commanded two ships but was removed from command both times. The last few months of his active service were spent in a hospital, being treated for a variety of complaints. In 1953, the first churches of Scientology were founded by Hubbard. In 1954 a Scientology church in Los Angeles was founded, which became the Church of Scientology International. Hubbard added organizational management strategies, principles of pedagogy, a theory of communication and prevention strategies for healthy living to the teachings of Scientology. As Scientology came under increasing media attention and legal pressure in a number of countries during the late 1960s and early 1970s, Hubbard spent much of his time at sea as &quot;commodore&quot; of the Sea Organization, a private, quasi-paramilitary Scientologist fleet.

Hubbard returned to the United States in 1975 and went into seclusion in the California desert after an unsuccessful attempt to take over the town of Clearwater, Florida. In 1978, Hubbard was convicted of fraud &quot;in absentia&quot; by France. In the same year, 11 high-ranking members of Scientology were indicted on 28 charges for their role in the Church&#x27;s Snow White Program, a systematic program of espionage against the United States government. One of the indicted was Hubbard&#x27;s wife Mary Sue Hubbard; he himself was named an unindicted co-conspirator. Hubbard spent the remaining years of his life in seclusion, attended to by a small group of Scientology officials.

Following his 1986 death, Scientology leaders announced that Hubbard&#x27;s body had become an impediment to his work and that he had decided to &quot;drop his body&quot; to continue his research on another plane of existence. The Church of Scientology describes Hubbard in hagiographic terms, though many of his autobiographical statements were fictitious. Sociologist Stephen Kent has observed that Hubbard &quot;likely presented a personality disorder known as malignant narcissism.&quot;

==Life==
===Before Dianetics===
Lafayette Ronald Hubbard was born on March 13, 1911, the only child of Ledora May Waterbury, who had trained as a teacher, and Harry Ross Hubbard, a low-ranking United States Navy officer. Like many military families of the era, the Hubbards repeatedly relocated around the United States and overseas. After moving to Kalispell, Montana, they settled in Helena in 1913. Hubbard&#x27;s father rejoined the Navy in April 1917, during World War I, while his mother worked as a clerk for the state government. After his father was posted to Guam, Hubbard and his mother traveled there with brief stop-overs in a couple of Chinese ports. In high school, Hubbard contributed to the school paper, but was dropped from enrollment due to failing grades. After he failed the Naval Academy entrance examination, Hubbard was enrolled in a Virginia Preparatory School to prepare him for a second attempt. However, after complaining of eye strain, Hubbard was diagnosed with myopia, precluding any future enrollment in the Naval Academy. As an adult, Hubbard would privately write to himself that his eyes had gone bad when he &quot;used them as an excuse to escape the naval academy&quot;.

Hubbard was sent to the Woodward School in D.C., as graduates qualified for admission to George Washington University without having to take the entrance exam. Hubbard graduated in June 1930 and entered GWU. Academically, Hubbard did poorly and was repeatedly warned about bad grades, but he contributed to the student newspaper and was active in the glider club. In 1932, Hubbard organized a student trip to the Caribbean, but amid multiple misfortunes and insufficient funding, the passengers took to burning Hubbard in effigy and the trip was canceled by the ship&#x27;s owners. Hubbard did not return to GWU the following year.
For much of the 1920s and 1930s, Hubbard lived in Washington D.C., and he would later claim to have interacted with multiple psychiatrists in the city. Hubbard described encounters in 1923 and 1930 with navy psychiatrist Joseph Thompson. Thompson was controversial within the American psychiatric community for his support of lay analysis, the practice of psychoanalysis by those without medical degrees. Hubbard also recalled interacting with William Alanson White, supervisor of the D.C. psychiatric hospital St. Elizabeth&#x27;s. According to Hubbard, both White and Thompson had regarded his athleticism and lack of interest in psychology as signs of a good prognosis. Hubbard later claimed to have been trained by both Thompson and White. Hubbard also discussed his interactions at Chestnut Lodge, a D.C.-area facility specializing in schizophrenia, repeatedly complaining that their staff misdiagnosed an unnamed individual with the condition:

====Pre-war fiction====

In 1933, Hubbard renewed a relationship with a fellow glider pilot, Margaret &quot;Polly&quot; Grubb and the two were quickly married on April 13.
The following year, she gave birth to a son who was named Lafayette Ronald Hubbard, Jr., later nicknamed &quot;Nibs&quot;. A second child, Katherine May, was born two years later. The Hubbards lived for a while in Laytonsville, Maryland, but were chronically short of money. In the spring of 1936, they moved to Bremerton, Washington. They lived there for a time with Hubbard&#x27;s aunts and grandmother before finding a place of their own at nearby South Colby. According to one of his friends at the time, Robert MacDonald Ford, the Hubbards were &quot;in fairly dire straits for money&quot; but sustained themselves on the income from Hubbard&#x27;s writing.

Hubbard began a writing career and tried to write for mainstream publications. Hubbard soon found his niche in the pulp fiction magazines, becoming a prolific and prominent writer in the medium. From 1934 until 1940, Hubbard produced hundreds of short stories and novels. Hubbard is remembered for his &quot;prodigious output&quot; across a variety of genres, including adventure fiction, aviation, travel, mysteries, westerns, romance, and science fiction. His first full-length novel, &quot;Buckskin Brigades&quot;, was published in 1937. The novel told the story of &quot;Yellow Hair&quot;, a white man adopted into the Blackfeet tribe, with promotional material claiming the author had been a &quot;bloodbrother&quot; of the Blackfeet. &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; praised the book, writing &quot;Mr. Hubbard has reversed a time-honored formula and has given a thriller to which, at the end of every chapter or so, another paleface bites the dust.&quot;

On New Year&#x27;s Day, 1938, Hubbard reportedly underwent a dental procedure and reacted to the anesthetic gas used in the procedure. According to his account, this triggered a revelatory near-death experience. Allegedly inspired by this experience, Hubbard composed a manuscript, which was never published, with working titles of &quot;The One Command&quot; and &quot;Excalibur&quot;. Hubbard sent telegrams to several book publishers, but nobody bought the manuscript. Hubbard wrote to his wife:

Hubbard found greater success after being taken under the supervision of editor John W. Campbell, who published many of Hubbard&#x27;s short stories and serialized novelettes in his magazines &quot;Unknown&quot; and &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;. Hubbard&#x27;s novel &quot;Final Blackout&quot; told the story of a low-ranking British army officer who rises to become dictator of the United Kingdom. In July 1940, Campbell magazine &quot;Unknown&quot; published a psychological horror by Hubbard titled &quot;Fear&quot; about an ethnologist who becomes paranoid that demons are out to get him—the work was well-received, drawing praise from Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov, and others. In November and December 1940, &quot;Unknown&quot; serialized Hubbard&#x27;s novel &quot;Typewriter in the Sky&quot; about a pulp fiction writer whose friend becomes trapped inside one of his stories.

====Military career====
In 1941, Hubbard applied to join the United States Navy. His application was accepted, and he was commissioned as a lieutenant junior grade in the United States Naval Reserve on July 19, 1941. By November, he was posted to New York for training as an intelligence officer. The day after Pearl Harbor, Hubbard was posted to the Philippines and departed the US bound for Australia. But while in Australia awaiting transport to the Philippines, Hubbard was suddenly ordered back to the United States after being accused by the US Naval Attaché to Australia of sending blockade-runner &quot;Don Isidro&quot; &quot;three thousand miles out of her way&quot;.
In June 1942, Hubbard was given command of a patrol boat at the Boston Navy Yard, but he was relieved after the yard commandant wrote that Hubbard was &quot;not temperamentally fitted for independent command&quot;. In 1943, Hubbard was given command of a submarine chaser, but only five hours into the shakedown cruise, Hubbard believed he had detected an enemy submarine. Hubbard and crew spent the next 68 hours engaged in combat. An investigation concluded that Hubbard had likely mistaken a &quot;known magnetic deposit&quot; for an enemy sub. The following month, Hubbard unwittingly fired upon Mexican territory and was relieved of command. In 1944, Hubbard served aboard the before being transferred. The night before his departure, Hubbard reported the discovery of an attempted sabotage.

In June 1942, Navy records indicate that Hubbard suffered &quot;active conjunctivitis&quot; and later &quot;urethral discharges&quot;. After being relieved of command of the sub-chaser, Hubbard began reporting sick, citing a variety of ailments, including ulcers, malaria, and back pains. In July 1943, Hubbard was admitted to the San Diego naval hospital for observation—he would remain there for months. Years later, Hubbard would privately write to himself: &quot;Your stomach trouble you used as an excuse to keep the Navy from punishing you.&quot; On April 9, 1945, Hubbard again reported sick and was re-admitted to Oak Knoll Naval Hospital, Oakland. He was discharged from the hospital on December 4, 1945.

====After the war====
After Hubbard chose to stay in California rather than return to his family in Washington state, he moved into the Pasadena mansion of John &quot;Jack&quot; Whiteside Parsons, a rocket propulsion engineer and a leading follower of the English occultist Aleister Crowley. Hubbard befriended Parsons and soon became sexually involved with Parsons&#x27;s 21-year-old girlfriend, Sara &quot;Betty&quot; Northrup. Hubbard and Parsons collaborated on &quot;Babalon Working&quot;, a sex magic ritual intended to summon an incarnation of Babalon, the supreme Goddess in Crowley&#x27;s pantheon.

During this period, Hubbard authored a document which has been called the &quot;Affirmations&quot;, a series of statements relating to various physical, sexual, psychological and social issues that he was encountering in his life. The Affirmations appear to have been intended to be used as a form of self-hypnosis with the intention of resolving the author&#x27;s psychological problems and instilling a positive mental attitude.

Parsons, Hubbard and Sara invested nearly their entire savings — the vast majority contributed by Parsons and Sara — in a plan for Hubbard and Sara to buy yachts on the East Coast and sail them to the West Coast to sell. Hubbard had a different idea, writing to the U.S. Navy requesting permission to undertake a world cruise. Parsons attempted to recover his money by obtaining an injunction to prevent Hubbard and Sara leaving the country or disposing of the remnants of his assets, but ultimately only received a $2,900 promissory note from Hubbard. Parsons returned home &quot;shattered&quot; and was forced to sell his mansion.
On August 10, 1946, Hubbard married Sara, though he was still married to his first wife Polly. Hubbard resumed his fiction writing to supplement his small disability allowance. In August 1947, Hubbard returned to the pages of &quot;Astounding&quot; with a serialized novel &quot;The End is Not Yet&quot;, about a young nuclear physicist who tries to stop a world takeover by building a new philosophical system. In October 1947, the magazine began serializing &quot;Ole Doc Methuselah&quot;, the first in a series about the &quot;Soldiers of Light&quot;, supremely skilled, extremely long-lived physicians. In February and March 1950, Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Astounding&quot; serialized the Hubbard novel &quot;To the Stars&quot; about a young engineer on an interstellar trading starship who learns that months aboard ship amounts to centuries on Earth, making the ship his only remaining home after his first voyage. During his time in California, Hubbard began acting as a sort of amateur stage hypnotist or &quot;swami&quot;.

Hubbard repeatedly wrote to the Veterans Administration (VA) asking for an increase in his war pension. Finally, in October 1947, he wrote to request psychiatric treatment:

The VA eventually did increase his pension, but his money problems continued. In the summer of 1948, Hubbard was arrested by the San Luis Obispo sheriff on a charge of petty theft for passing a fraudulent check. Beginning in June 1948, the nationally-syndicated wire service United Press ran a story on an American Legion-sponsored psychiatric ward in Savannah, Georgia, which sought to keep mentally-ill war veterans out of jail. In late 1948, Hubbard and his second wife Sara moved from California to Savannah, Georgia, where he would later claim to have worked as a volunteer in a psychiatric clinic. Hubbard claimed he had &quot;processed an awful lot of Negroes&quot; and wrote of having observed a psychiatrist using the threat of institutionalization in a state hospital to solicit funds from a patient&#x27;s husband. In letters to friends sent from Savannah, Hubbard began to make the first public mentions of what was to become Dianetics.

===In the Dianetics era===

Inspired by science-fiction of his friend Robert Heinlein, Hubbard announced plans to write a book which would claim to &quot;make supermen&quot;. Hubbard announced to the public that there existed a superhuman condition which he called the state of &quot;Clear&quot;. He claimed people in that state would have a perfectly functioning mind with an improved intelligence quotient (IQ) and photographic memory. The &quot;Clear&quot; would be cured of physical ailments ranging from poor eyesight to the common cold, which Hubbard asserted were purely psychosomatic.

To promote his upcoming book, Hubbard enlisted his longtime-editor John Campbell, who had a fascination with fringe psychologies and psychic powers. Campbell invited Hubbard and Sara to move into a New Jersey cottage. Campbell, in turn, recruited an acquaintance, medical doctor Joseph Winter, to help promote the book. Campbell wrote Winter to extol Hubbard, claiming that Hubbard had worked with nearly 1000 cases and cured every single one. The birth of Hubbard&#x27;s second daughter Alexis Valerie, delivered by Winter on March 8, 1950, came in the middle of the preparations to launch Dianetics.

The basic content of Dianetics was a retelling of Psychoanalytic theory geared for a mass market English-speaking audience. Like Freud, Hubbard taught that the brain recorded memories (or &quot;engrams&quot;) which were stored in the unconscious mind (which Hubbard restyled &quot;the reactive mind&quot;). Past memories could be triggered later in life, causing psychological, emotional, or even physical problems. By sharing their memories with a friendly listener (or &quot;auditor&quot;), a person could overcome their past pain and thus cure themselves. Through Dianetics, Hubbard claimed that most illnesses were psychosomatic and caused by engrams, including arthritis, dermatitis, allergies, asthma, coronary difficulties, eye trouble, bursitis, ulcers, sinusitis and migraine headaches. He further claimed that dianetic therapy could treat these illnesses, and also included cancer and diabetes as conditions that Dianetic research was focused on.

Accompanied by an article in &quot;Astounding&#x27;s&quot; May 1950 issue, &quot;&quot; was released on May 9. Although Dianetics was poorly received by the press and the scientific and medical professions, the book was an immediate commercial success and sparked &quot;a nationwide cult of incredible proportions&quot;. Five hundred Dianetic auditing groups were set up across the United States, and Hubbard established the &quot;Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation&quot;. Financial controls were lax, and Hubbard himself took large sums with no explanation of what he was doing with it.

Dianetics lost public credibility on August 10 when a presentation by Hubbard before an audience of 6,000 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles failed disastrously. He introduced a woman named Sonya Bianca and told the audience that as a result of undergoing Dianetic therapy she now possessed perfect recall, only for her to forget the color of Hubbard&#x27;s necktie. A large part of the audience walked out, and the debacle was publicized by popular science writer Martin Gardner. On September 3, psychologist Erich Fromm publicly derided &quot;Dianetics&quot; as a &quot;mixture of some oversimplified truths, half truths and plain absurdities&quot;; Fromm criticized the writing as &quot;propagandistic&quot; and likened it to the quack field of patent medicines. By late-1950, Hubbard&#x27;s foundations were in financial crisis. Hubbard&#x27;s publisher Arthur Ceppos, his longtime promoter Joseph Campbell, and medical doctor-turned-Dianetics endorser Joseph Winter all resigned under acrimonious circumstances.

In late-1950, Hubbard began an affair with employee Barbara Klowden, prompting Sara to start her own affair with Miles Hollister. On February 23, 1951, Sara and her lover consulted with a psychiatrist about Hubbard, who advised that Sara was in grave danger and Hubbard should be institutionalized. The trio telephoned Jack Maloney, the head of the Hubbard&#x27;s foundation in Elizabeth, New Jersey, to request funding for the hospitalization. Maloney informed Hubbard of the plans to institutionalize him. That night, 
Hubbard and two trusted aides kidnapped Hubbard&#x27;s one-year-old daughter Alexis and wife Sara and attempted unsuccessfully to find a doctor to examine Sara and declare her insane. He let Sara go but took Alexis to Cuba. Hubbard denounced Sara and her lover to the FBI, portraying them in a letter as communist infiltrators. An agent annotated his correspondence with Hubbard with the comment, &quot;Appears mental&quot;.

On April 12, Sara&#x27;s story was published in the press, leading to headlines such as &quot;Ron Hubbard Insane, Says His Wife&quot;. Hubbard&#x27;s first wife evidently saw the headlines and wrote to Sara on May 2 offering her support. &quot;Ron is not normal... Your charges probably sound fantastic to the average person—but I&#x27;ve been through it—the beatings, threats on my life, all the sadistic traits you charge—twelve years of it.&quot; In June, Sara finally secured the return of her daughter by agreeing to a settlement in which she signed a statement, written by Hubbard, declaring that she had been misrepresented in the press and that she had always believed he was a &quot;fine and brilliant man&quot;.

The Dianetics craze &quot;burned itself out as quickly as it caught fire&quot;, and the movement appeared to be on the edge of total collapse. However, it was temporarily saved by Don Purcell, a millionaire who agreed to support a new Foundation in Wichita, Kansas. In August 1951, Hubbard published &quot;Science of Survival&quot;. In that book, Hubbard introduced such concepts as the immortal soul (or &quot;Thetan&quot;) and past-life regressions (or &quot;Whole Track Auditing&quot;). The Wichita Foundation underwrote the costs of printing the book, but it recorded poor sales when first published, with only 1,250 copies of the first edition being printed. The Wichita Foundation became financially nonviable after a court ruled that it was liable for the unpaid debts of its defunct predecessor in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The ruling prompted Purcell and the other directors of the Wichita Foundation to file for voluntary bankruptcy in February 1952. Hubbard resigned immediately and accused Purcell of having been bribed by the American Medical Association to destroy Dianetics. Hubbard emptied the Wichita foundation&#x27;s bank accounts, in part through forgery.

===Pivot to Scientology===

Having lost the rights to Dianetics, Hubbard created Scientology. At a convention in Wichita, Hubbard announced that he had discovered a new science beyond Dianetics which he called &quot;Scientology&quot;. Whereas the goal of Dianetics had been to reach a superhuman state of &quot;Clear&quot;, Scientology promised a chance to achieve god-like powers in a state called Operating Thetan. Hubbard introduced a device called an &quot;electropsychometer&quot; (or e-meter), which called for users to hold two metal cans in their hands to measure changes in skin conductivity due to variance in sweat or grip. In 1906, Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung had famously used such a device in a study of word association. Rather than a mundane biofeedback device, Hubbard presented the e-meter as having &quot;an almost mystical power to reveal an individual&#x27;s innermost thoughts&quot;.

Hubbard married a staff member, 20-year-old Mary Sue Whipp, and the pair moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Hubbard was joined by his 18-year-old son Nibs, who had become a Scientology staff member and &quot;professor&quot;. Scientology was organized in a different way from the decentralized Dianetics movement — The Hubbard Association of Scientologists (HAS) was the only official Scientology organization. Branches or &quot;orgs&quot; were organized as franchises, rather like a fast food restaurant chain. Each franchise holder was required to pay ten percent of income to Hubbard&#x27;s central organization. In July, Hubbard published &quot;What to Audit&quot; (later re-titled &quot;&quot;), which taught everyone has subconscious traumatic memories of their past lives as clams, sloths, and cavemen which cause neuroses and health problems. In November 1952, Hubbard published &quot;Scientology 8-80&quot;, followed up in December with &quot;Scientology 8-8008&quot;, which argued that the physical universe is the creation of the mind.

In December, Hubbard gave a seventy-hour series of lectures in Philadelphia that was attended by 38 people in which he delved into the occult. In the lectures, Hubbard connects rituals and the practice of Scientology to the magickal practices of Aleister Crowley, recommending Crowley&#x27;s book &quot;The Master Therion&quot;. During the Philadelphia course, Hubbard joked that he was &quot;the prince of darkness&quot;, which was met with laughter from the audience. On December 16, 1952, Hubbard was arrested in the middle of a lecture for failing to return $9,000 withdrawn from the Wichita Foundation. He eventually settled the debt by paying $1,000 and returning a car belonging to Wichita financier Don Purcell.

In April 1953, Hubbard proposed setting up a chain of &quot;Spiritual Guidance Centers&quot; as part of what he called &quot;the religion angle&quot;. On December 18, 1953, Hubbard incorporated the Church of Scientology in Camden, New Jersey. The religious transformation was explained as a way to protect Scientologists from charges of practicing medicine without a license. The idea may not have been new; Hubbard has been quoted as telling a science fiction convention in 1948: &quot;Writing for a penny a word is ridiculous. If a man really wants to make a million dollars, the best way would be to start his own religion.&quot;

===In the Church of Scientology era===
By 1954, the IRS recognized the Church of Scientology of California as a tax-exempt organization and by 1966, the Washington, D.C. Founding Church of Scientology received tax-exempt status nationwide. The Church of Scientology became a highly profitable enterprise for Hubbard, as he was paid a percentage of the Church&#x27;s gross income. By 1957 he was being paid about $250,000 (). His family grew, too, with Mary Sue giving birth to three more children—Quentin on January 6, 1954; Suzette on February 13, 1955; and Arthur on June 6, 1958.
Hubbard was notorious for his policies of attacking his perceived enemies. Nibs recalled that Hubbard &quot;only knew how to do one thing and that was to destroy people.&quot; Hubbard told Scientologists to &quot;Don&#x27;t ever defend, always attack&quot;, encouraging them to find or manufacture evidence and to file harassing lawsuits against enemies. Any individual breaking away from Scientology and setting up his own group was to be shut down. Most of the formerly independent Scientology and Dianetics groups were either driven out of business or were absorbed into Hubbard&#x27;s organizations. Hubbard finally achieved victory over Don Purcell in 1954 when the latter, worn out by constant litigation, handed the copyrights of Dianetics back to Hubbard.

After dealing with Purcell, Hubbard turned his attention to attacking psychiatrists, who he blamed for the backlash against Dianetics and Scientology. In 1955, Hubbard authored a text titled: &quot;Brain-Washing: A Synthesis of the Russian Textbook on Psychopolitics&quot; which purported to be a secret manual linking Psychiatry and Communism written by a Soviet secret police chief. Hubbard founded the &quot;National Academy of American Psychology&quot; which sought to issue a &quot;loyalty oath&quot; to psychologists and psychiatrists. Those who opposed the oath were to be labeled &quot;Subversive psychiatrists&quot;, while those who merely refused to sign the oath would be labeled &quot;Potentially Subversive&quot;. Hubbard denounced psychiatric abuses, writing that psychoanalysis had been &quot;superseded by tyrannous sadism, practiced by unprincipled men&quot;. Wrote Hubbard:

Today men who call themselves analysts are merrily sawing out patients&#x27; brains, shocking them with murderous drugs, striking them with high voltages, burying them underneath mounds of ice, placing them in restraints, &#x27;sterilizing&#x27; them sexually and generally conducting themselves much as their patients would were they given the chance. 
In 1956, Hubbard released &quot;Fundamentals of Thought&quot;, which teaches that life is a game and divides people into pieces, players, and game-makers. 
The following year, Hubbard published &quot;All About Radiation&quot;, which falsely claimed that radiation poisoning and even cancer can be cured by vitamins. In 1958, amid widespread interest in the Bridey Murphy case, Hubbard authored &quot;Have You Lived Before This Life?&quot;, a collection of past life regressions.

In 1958, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service withdrew the Washington, D.C., Church of Scientology&#x27;s tax exemption after it found that Hubbard and his family were profiting unreasonably from Scientology&#x27;s ostensibly non-profit income. In the spring of 1959, Hubbard purchased Saint Hill Manor, an 18th-century English country house formerly owned by the Maharaja of Jaipur. The house became Hubbard&#x27;s permanent residence and an international training center for Scientologists.

That year Hubbard learned his son Nibs had resigned from the organization, citing financial difficulties. Hubbard regarded the departure as a betrayal. Hubbard introduced &quot;security checking&quot;, a structured interrogation using the e-meter, to identify those he termed &quot;potential trouble sources&quot; and &quot;suppressive persons&quot;. Members of the Church of Scientology were interrogated with the aid of E-meters and were asked questions such as &quot;Have you ever practiced homosexuality?&quot; and &quot;Have you ever had unkind thoughts about L. Ron Hubbard?&quot;

Since its inception, Hubbard marketed Dianetics and Scientology through false medical claims. On January 4, 1963, US Food and Drug Administration agents raided American offices of the Church of Scientology, seizing over a hundred E-meters as illegal medical devices, thousands of pills being marketed as &quot;radiation cures&quot;, and tons of literature that they accused of making false medical claims. 
In November 1963 Victoria, Australia, the government opened an inquiry into the Church, which was accused of brainwashing, blackmail, extortion and damaging the mental health of its members. Its report, published in October 1965, condemned every aspect of Scientology and Hubbard himself. The report led to Scientology being banned in Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia, and led to more negative publicity around the world. Public perceptions of Scientology changed from &quot;relatively harmless, if cranky&quot; to an &quot;evil, dangerous&quot; group that performs hypnosis and brainwashing. Scientology attracted increasingly unfavorable publicity across the English-speaking world.

Hubbard took major new initiatives in the face of these challenges. By 1965, &quot;Ethics Technology&quot; was introduced to tighten internal discipline within Scientology. It required Scientologists to &quot;disconnect&quot; from any organization or individual—including family members—deemed to be disruptive or &quot;suppressive&quot;. Scientologists were also required to write &quot;Knowledge Reports&quot; on each other, reporting transgressions or misapplications of Scientology methods. Hubbard promulgated a long list of punishable &quot;Misdemeanors&quot;, &quot;Crimes&quot;, and &quot;High Crimes&quot;. At the start of March 1966, Hubbard created the Guardian&#x27;s Office (GO), a new agency within the Church of Scientology that was headed by his wife Mary Sue. It dealt with Scientology&#x27;s external affairs, including public relations, legal actions and the gathering of intelligence on perceived threats. 
As Scientology faced increasingly negative media attention, the GO retaliated with hundreds of writs for libel and slander; it issued more than forty on a single day. Hubbard ordered his staff to find &quot;lurid, blood sex crime actual evidence on [Scientology&#x27;s] attackers&quot;. The &quot;fair game&quot; policy was codified in 1967, which was applicable to anyone deemed an &quot;enemy&quot; of Scientology: &quot;May be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed.&quot;
Newspapers and politicians in the UK pressed the British government for action against Scientology. In April 1966, hoping to form a remote &quot;safe haven&quot; for Scientology, Hubbard traveled to the southern African country Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). Despite his attempts to curry favor with the local government, Rhodesia promptly refused to renew Hubbard&#x27;s visa, compelling him to leave the country. Finally, at the end of 1966, Hubbard acquired his own fleet of three ships. In July 1968, the British Minister of Health announced that foreign Scientologists would no longer be permitted to enter the UK and Hubbard himself was excluded from the country as an &quot;undesirable alien&quot;. Further inquiries were launched in Canada, New Zealand and South Africa.

===In the Sea Org era===

Hubbard purchased a ship in Las Palmas and founded the &quot;Sea Org&quot;, a private navy of elite Scientologists. Hubbard set out to take command of the ship. Enroute, he wrote OT III, the esoteric story of Xenu. In a letter to his wife Mary Sue, Hubbard said that, in order to assist his research, he was drinking alcohol and taking stimulants and depressants. In OT III, Hubbard wrote of alleged secrets of an immense disaster that had occurred &quot;on this planet, and on the other seventy-five planets which form this Confederacy, seventy-five million years ago&quot;. It teaches that Xenu, the leader of the Galactic Confederacy, had shipped billions of people to Earth and blown them up with hydrogen bombs, following which their traumatized spirits were stuck together at &quot;implant stations&quot;, brainwashed with false memories and eventually became contained within human beings.

When Hubbard established the Sea Org he publicly declared that he had relinquished his management responsibilities over the Church of Scientology. In fact, he received daily telex messages from Scientology organizations around the world reporting their statistics and income. The Church of Scientology sent him $15,000 a week along with millions of dollars that were transferred to bank accounts. Church of Scientology couriers arrived regularly, conveying luxury food for Hubbard and his family or cash that had been smuggled from England to avoid currency export restrictions. Hubbard&#x27;s fleet began sailing from port to port in the Mediterranean Sea and eastern North Atlantic, rarely staying anywhere for longer than six weeks, as Hubbard claimed he was being pursued by enemies whose interference could lead to global chaos or nuclear war.

Though Scientologists around the world were presented with a glamorous picture of life in the Sea Org and many applied to join Hubbard aboard the fleet, the reality was rather different. Most of those joining had no nautical experience at all. Mechanical difficulties and blunders by the crews led to a series of embarrassing incidents and near-disasters. Following one incident in which the rudder of the &quot;Royal Scotman&quot; was damaged during a storm, Hubbard ordered the ship&#x27;s entire crew to be reduced to a &quot;condition of liability&quot; and wear gray rags tied to their arms. The ship itself was treated the same way, with dirty tarpaulins tied around its funnel to symbolize its lower status. According to those aboard, conditions were appalling; the crew was worked to the point of exhaustion, given meager rations and forbidden to wash or change their clothes for several weeks. Hubbard maintained a harsh disciplinary regime aboard the fleet, punishing mistakes by confining people in the &quot;Royal Scotman&quot; bilge tanks without toilet facilities and with food provided in buckets. At other times erring crew members or students were thrown overboard with Hubbard looking on and, occasionally, filming. One member of the Sea Org recalled Hubbard punishing a little boy by confining him to the ship&#x27;s chain locker.

Aboard ship, Hubbard began dispatching teams of Sea Org members to search for historic evidence of his past lives; In 1973, he published &quot;Mission into Time&quot; about those searches. Now having his own paramilitary force, orders to use R2-45 (killing someone with a .45 pistol) on specific individuals were published. From about 1970, Hubbard was attended aboard ship by the children of Sea Org members, organized as the Commodore&#x27;s Messenger Organization (CMO). They were mainly young girls dressed in hot pants and halter tops, who were responsible for running errands for Hubbard such as lighting his cigarettes, dressing him or relaying his verbal commands to other members of the crew. In addition to his wife Mary Sue, he was accompanied by all four of his children by her, who were all members of the Sea Org and shared its rigors.

After his prior failure in Rhodesia, Hubbard again tried to establish a safe haven in a friendly country, this time Greece. The fleet stayed at the Greek island of Corfu for several months in 1968–1969. Hubbard, recently expelled from Britain, renamed the ships after Greek gods—the &quot;Royal Scotman&quot; was rechristened &quot;Apollo&quot;—and he praised the recently established military dictatorship. Despite Hubbard&#x27;s hopes, in March 1969 Hubbard and his ships were ordered to leave.
The practice of prominently displaying the cross in Scientology centers was instituted in 1969 following hostile press coverage where Scientology&#x27;s status as a legitimate religion was being questioned. In October 1969, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; published an exposé by Australian journalist Alex Mitchell detailing Hubbard&#x27;s occult experiences with Parsons and Aleister Crowley&#x27;s teachings. The Church responded with a statement, claiming without evidence Hubbard was sent in by the US Government to &quot;break up Black Magic in America&quot; and succeeded.

In mid-1972, Hubbard again tried to find a safe haven, this time in Morocco, establishing contacts with the country&#x27;s secret police and training senior policemen and intelligence agents in techniques for detecting subversives. The program ended in failure when it became caught up in internal Moroccan politics, and Hubbard left the country hastily in December 1972. After French prosecutors charged Hubbard with fraud and customs violations, Hubbard risked extradition to France. In response, at the end of 1972, Hubbard left the Sea Org fleet temporarily, living incognito in Queens, New York. Hubbard&#x27;s health deteriorated significantly during this period, as he was an overweight chain-smoker, suffered from bursitis and had a prominent growth on his forehead. In September 1973 when the threat of extradition had abated, Hubbard left New York, returning to his flagship.

Hubbard suffered serious injuries in a motorcycle accident on the island of Tenerife in December 1973. In 1974, Hubbard established the Rehabilitation Project Force, a punishment program for Sea Org members who displeased him. Hubbard&#x27;s son Quentin reportedly found it difficult to adjust and attempted suicide in mid-1974. Also in 1974, L. Ron Hubbard confessed to two top executives that &quot;People do not [leave Scientology] because of [their unconfessed sins], they leave because [they stop liking Scientology or stop believing in it]&quot;. Hubbard warned &quot;If any of this information ever became public, I would lose all control of the orgs and eventually Scientology as a whole.&quot;
Throughout this period, Hubbard was heavily involved in directing the activities of the Guardian&#x27;s Office (GO), the legal bureau/intelligence agency. In 1973, he instigated the &quot;Snow White Program&quot; and directed the GO to remove negative reports about Scientology from government files and track down their sources. The GO carried out covert campaigns on his behalf such as Operation Bulldozer Leak, designed to convince authorities that Hubbard had no legal liability for the actions of the church. Hubbard was kept informed of these operations, including as the theft of medical records from a hospital, harassment of psychiatrists, and infiltrations of organizations such as the Better Business Bureau, American Medical Association, American Psychiatric Association, U.S. Department of Justice, and Internal Revenue Service. Paulette Cooper, a freelance journalist and Scientology critic, was subjected to at least at least 19 lawsuits, framed for sending bomb threats, and was urged to climb onto a dangerous 33rd-floor ledge by a roommate later believed to be a Guardian&#x27;s Office agent.

===In hiding===

After suffering a heart attack, Hubbard decided to relocate back to the United States. In October 1975, Hubbard moved into a hotel suite in Daytona Beach while the Fort Harrison Hotel in Clearwater, Florida, was secretly acquired as the location for the Sea Org &quot;land base&quot;. According to a former member of the Sea Organization pseudonymously named &quot;Heidi Forrester&quot;, in late 1975 she met with a man fitting Hubbard&#x27;s description who apparently performed a Crowleyite sex magick ritual called Dianism using her.

On June 11, 1976, the FBI apprehended two Guardian&#x27;s Office agents inside the US Courthouse in D.C., prompting Hubbard to move cross country to a safe house in California, and later a nearby ranch. On October 28, 1976, Las Vegas police discovered Hubbard&#x27;s son Quentin Hubbard unconscious in his car with a hose connected to the tailpipe. L. Ron Hubbard was furious at the news, shouting, &quot;That stupid fucking kid! Look what he&#x27;s done to me!&quot; Scientologists were told that Quentin had died from encephalitis.

On July 8, 1977, the FBI carried out simultaneous raids on Guardian&#x27;s Office locations in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. They retrieved wiretap equipment, burglary tools and some 90,000 pages of incriminating documents. On July 15, a week after the raid, Hubbard fled with Pat Broeker to Sparks, Nevada. On August 18, 1978, Hubbard suffered from a pulmonary embolism and fell into a coma, but recovered. Hubbard summoned his personal auditor, David Mayo, to heal him.

In August 1979, Hubbard saw his wife for the last time. Hubbard was facing a possible indictment for his role in Operation Freakout, a campaign of attacks against journalist Paulette Cooper. In February 1980, Hubbard disappeared into deep cover in the company of two trusted messengers, Pat and Annie Broeker. For the first few years of the 1980s, Hubbard and the Broekers toured the Pacific Northwest in a recreational vehicle, later residing in Southern California. Hubbard returned to Science-Fiction, writing &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; (1982) and &quot;Mission Earth&quot;, a ten-volume series published between 1985 and 1987.
In OT VIII, dated 1980, Hubbard explains the document is intended for circulation only after his death. In the document, Hubbard denounces the historic Jesus as &quot;a lover of young boys&quot; given to &quot;uncontrollable bursts of temper&quot;. Hubbard explains that &quot;My mission could be said to fulfill the Biblical promise represented by this brief anti-Christ period.&quot; This was corroborated by a 1983 interview where Hubbard&#x27;s son Nibs explained that his father believed he was the Anti-Christ.
 In December 1985, Hubbard allegedly attempted suicide by custom e-meter. On January 17, 1986, Hubbard suffered a stroke; he died a week later. His body was cremated and the ashes were scattered at sea.

==Sources and doctrines==
Hubbard has been described as an &quot;eclectic and ingenious&quot; religious innovator who cobbled together ideas from a diverse array of sources and traditions. Hubbard explicitly cited Freud&#x27;s psychoanalysis as a source for Dianetics and Scientology, renaming some terms. Hubbard&#x27;s wife Sara recalled him discussing biologist Richard Semon, who had coined the term &quot;engram&quot; which became a centerpiece of Dianetics. Hubbard incorporated the 1920s psychoanalytic theory of birth trauma and taught his followers to maintain total silence during the birth process. Hubbard explicitly credited Social Darwinism pioneer Herbert Spencer who coined the phrase &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;, and taught that the &#x27;one command&#x27; given to all life is to &quot;survive&quot; and later authored a book called &quot;Science of Survival&quot;.

Hubbard cited author Alfred Korzybski as an influence; after two years observing patients at St. Elizabeth&#x27;s psychiatric hospital in D.C. in collaboration with superintendent William Alanson White, Korzybski published a tome titled &quot;Science and Sanity&quot; outlining a doctrine he called &quot;General Semantics&quot;. After Korzybski founded an &quot;Institute&quot; to promote his teachings and began offering seminars, his ideas were incorporated into the science-fiction of Hubbard-associates Van Vogt and Heinlein, who envisioned futures where research into General Semantics had transformed some individuals into superhumans; Hubbard cited this fiction in a letter announcing the central principles of Dianetics: a book that promises to &quot;make supermen&quot;.

Through his exposure to both psychoanalysts and occultists, Hubbard drew inspiration from Eastern religions. Hubbard cited psychiatrist Joseph Thompson as teaching him the adage &quot;If it&#x27;s not true for you, it&#x27;s not true&quot;, a purportedly-Buddhist maxim which was later incorporated into Scientology. Reincarnation, originally a dharmic doctrine, entered Western occultism through the works of Blavatsky and numerous others. Fifteen years after Blavatsky followers unveiled &quot;The Bridge to Freedom&quot;, Hubbard announced &quot;The Bridge to &quot;Total&quot; Freedom&quot;.

Hubbard&#x27;s son Nibs said that Aleister Crowley was his father&#x27;s most important source of inspiration, and scholar Hugh Urban has written extensively about the occult roots of Scientology. Nibs Hubbard said in an interview in 1983: Like Crowley, Hubbard identified himself with diabolical figures from the Book of Revelation. Just as Aleister Crowley taught a soul could temporarily leave its body through astral projection, Hubbard taught a thetan could journey outside the body by &quot;going exterior&quot;.

Hubbard also taught extensively about hypnosis and recommended a 1949 book on the subject. Hubbard told of hypnotic implants, privately teaching human religions are the product of such implants. The use of hypnosis or trance to remember past lives was an extant practice in occult circles prior to Dianetics. Hubbard incorporated a range of hypnotic techniques into Scientology auditing and courses. They are employed as a means to create dependency and obedience in his followers. Crowley and Hubbard both placed emphasis on a Goddess figure, variously called Babalon, Hathor, or Diana—a name Hubbard gave to a ship and a daughter; the term Dianetics may have been inspired by the Goddess. Crowley taught a sex magic ritual called karezza or Dianism which Hubbard is believed to have practiced.

The e-meter was constructed by inventor Volney Mathison, who introduced it to Hubbard. Similar devices had been in use by psychiatrists and law enforcement for decades. Hubbard likened his own teachings about interstellar empires and invader forces to the early 20th-century fiction genre Space Opera. Hubbard drew upon US Navy traditions in creating the Sea Org, and he once said the Commodore&#x27;s Messenger Organization had been inspired by the Hitler Youth.

==False biographical claims==
Throughout his life, Hubbard made grossly exaggerated or outright false claims about himself. His estranged son Nibs reported that &quot;Ninety-nine percent of what my father ever wrote or said about himself&quot; was false. An acquaintance who knew Hubbard in Pasadena recalled recognizing Hubbard&#x27;s epic autobiographical tales as being adapted from the writings of others. In October 1984, an American judge issued a ruling, writing of Hubbard that &quot;the evidence portrays a man who has been virtually a pathological liar when it comes to his history, background and achievements.&quot; In his private &quot;Affirmations&quot;, Hubbard wrote to himself: 

Hubbard described his grandfather as a &quot;wealthy Western cattleman&quot;, but contemporary records show that Hubbard&#x27;s grandfather, Lafayette Waterbury, was a veterinarian, not a rancher, and was not wealthy. Hubbard claimed to be a &quot;blood brother&quot; of the Native American Blackfeet tribe, but Hubbard lived over a hundred miles from the Blackfeet reservation and the tribe did not practice blood brotherhood. Hubbard claimed to have been the youngest Eagle Scout in Boy Scouts history, but in fact the organization kept no records of the ages of Eagle Scouts.

Hubbard claimed to have traveled to Manchuria, but his diary did not record it. Hubbard claimed to be a graduate engineer, but in fact he earned poor grades at university, was placed on probation in September 1931 and dropped out altogether in the fall of 1932. Hubbard used the title &quot;Doctor&quot;, but his only doctorate was from a diploma mill. Hubbard claimed to have been crippled and blinded in combat, but records show he was never wounded and never received a Purple Heart (a decoration given to all US servicemen wounded in action). Hubbard&#x27;s Navy service records indicate that he received only four campaign medals rather than the twenty-one claimed by Church biographies.

==Legacy==

Hubbard was survived by his wife Mary Sue and all of his children except his second son Quentin. His will provided a trust fund to support Mary Sue; her children Arthur, Diana and Suzette; and Katherine, the daughter of his first wife Polly. He disinherited two of his other children. L. Ron Hubbard, Jr. had become estranged, changed his name to &quot;Ronald DeWolf&quot; and, in 1982, sued unsuccessfully for control of his father&#x27;s estate. Alexis Valerie, Hubbard&#x27;s daughter by his second wife Sara, had attempted to contact her father in 1971. She was rebuffed with the implied claim that her real father was Jack Parsons rather than Hubbard, and that her mother had been a Nazi spy during the war. Both later accepted settlements when litigation was threatened. In 2001, Diana and Suzette were reported to still be Church members, while Arthur had left and become an artist. Hubbard&#x27;s great-grandson, Jamie DeWolf, is a noted slam poet.

Opinions are divided about Hubbard&#x27;s literary legacy. One sociologist argued that even at Hubbard&#x27;s peak in the late 1930s, he was regarded as merely &quot;a passable, familiar author but not one of the best&quot;, while by the late-1970s &quot;the [science fiction] subculture wishes it could forget him&quot; and fans gave him a worse rating than any other of the &quot;Golden Age&quot; writers. &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; argues that while Hubbard could not be considered a peer of the &quot;prime movers&quot; like Asimov, Heinlein, and Sprague de Camp, Hubbard could be classed with Van Vogt as &quot;rogue members of the early Campbell pantheon&quot;. Hubbard received various posthumous awards, having a street named after in him in Los Angeles and recognition of his birthday in Utah and New Jersey.
Hubbard&#x27;s teachings led to numerous offshoots and splinter groups. In 1966, two former Scientologists founded the Process Church of the Final Judgment which mixed Hubbard&#x27;s teachings with Satanism. In 1969, a group led by former Scientologists Charles Manson and Bruce M. Davis was arrested and later convicted for their role in a series of high-profile murders. In 1971, former Scientologist Werner Erhard founded EST, a notable large group awareness training. In 1998, Keith Raniere drew upon Hubbard&#x27;s writings and Erhard&#x27;s techinques to create the large group awareness training ESP, a forerunner to the group NXIVM. Raniere offered students a chance to reach a superhuman state called &quot;Unified&quot; and taught Hubbard&#x27;s doctrine of &quot;suppressive persons&quot;; Raniere was ultimately sentenced to 120 years for a pattern of crimes, including the sexual exploitation of a child, sex trafficking of women, and conspiracy to commit forced labor. In 2010, the Nation of Islam began introducing its followers to Hubbard&#x27;s teachings, with leader Louis Farrakhan proclaiming &quot;I thank God for Mr. L. Ron Hubbard!&quot;

===In Scientology===
After his death, Scientology leaders announced that Hubbard&#x27;s body had become an impediment to his work and that he had decided to &quot;drop his body&quot; to continue his research. The copyrights of his works and much of his estate were willed to the Church of Scientology. According to the church, Hubbard&#x27;s entire corpus of Scientology and Dianetics texts are etched onto steel tablets in a vault under a mountain, on top of which a Hubbard-designed logo has been bulldozed, intended to be visible from space.

Hubbard&#x27;s presence pervades Scientology, and his birthday is celebrated annually. Every Church of Scientology maintains an office reserved for Hubbard, with a desk, chair and writing equipment, ready to be used. Hubbard is regarded as the ultimate source of Scientology, and is often referred to as simply &quot;Source&quot;, and he has no successor. Scientology has been described as &quot;a movement focused on the figure of Hubbard&quot;. Hubbard is presented as &quot;the master of a multitude of disciplines&quot; who performed extraordinary feats as a photographer, composer, scientist, therapist, explorer, navigator, philosopher, poet, artist, humanitarian, adventurer, soldier, scout, musician and many other fields of endeavor. Busts and portraits of Hubbard are commonplace throughout Scientology organizations, and meetings involve a round of applause to Hubbard&#x27;s portrait. In 2009, the American Religious Identification Survey found that 25,000 Americans identified as Scientologists.

Scientology&#x27;s sacred texts are inextricably linked to L. Ron Hubbard. According to Scientology&#x27;s official doctrine, &quot;Hubbard is the sole author or narrator of each and every one of the religion&#x27;s sacred books; indeed he is considered to be the single orchestrating genrius behind everything Scientological.&quot; Scientologists consider everything Hubbard ever said in verbal or written terms as &quot;scripture&quot;.

===In popular culture===

In the mid-1980s, the church began to promote Dianetics with a radio and television advertising blitz that was &quot;virtually unprecedented in book circles&quot;. In March 1988, Dianetics topped the best-seller lists nationwide through an organized campaign of mass bookbuying. Booksellers reported patrons buying hundreds of copies at once and later receiving ostensibly-new books from the publisher with store price stickers already attached. Hubbard&#x27;s number of followers peaked in the early 1990s with roughly 100,000 scientologists worldwide.

On November 21, 1997, the Fox network aired an episode of X-Files spinoff &quot;Millennium&quot; titled &quot;Jose Chung&#x27;s Doomsday Defense&quot; which satirized Lafayette Ronald Hubbard&#x27;s biography in an brief opening narration about a character named &quot;Juggernaut Onan Goopta&quot; who dreamt of becoming a neuroscientist only to discover that &quot;his own brain could not comprehend basic biology&quot;. The character switches to philosophy, but &quot;while reading Kirkegaard&#x27;s &#x27;The Sickness unto Death&#x27;, he became sick and nearly died&quot;; After writing an entire book in a &quot;single, feverish night&quot; that changed the course of human history, the character began lecturing to standing room only crowds, &quot;for he shrewdly refrained from providing chairs&quot;. In a satire of both Hubbard and George Santayana, the character explains that painful memories must be exterminated, saying &quot;those who cannot forget their past, are condemned to repeat it&quot;. The character establishes an institute where patients are called &#x27;doctors&#x27; and founds a religious order called Selfosophy staffed by an elite paramilitary inspired by the US Postal Service. We are told the character died of cancer or &quot;molted his earthly encumbrance to pursue his Selfosophical research in another dimension&quot;.

On February 8, 1998, Fox comedy &quot;The Simpsons&quot; broadcast &quot;The Joy of Sect&quot;, satirizing Hubbard and Scientology when the family joins a group called the Movementarians ruled over by a figure called &quot;The Leader&quot; who physically resembles L. Ron Hubbard. The Movementarians&#x27; use of a 10-trillion-year commitment for its members alludes to the billion-year contract and both groups make extensive use of litigation.
In 2000, Hubbard&#x27;s novel was adapted into a film called &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot;, starring long-time Scientology celebrity John Travolta. In 2001, a film titled &quot;The Profit&quot; parodied Scientology and Hubbard. In 2005, animated comedy &quot;South Park&quot; aired the episode &quot;Trapped in the Closet&quot; in which protagonist Stan is believed to be the reincarnation of Hubbard. The episode broadcast the great secret behind the church—a condensed version of the Xenu story while an on-screen caption reads &quot;This is what Scientologists actually believe&quot;. Prior to the episode, the story was almost completely unknown in mainstream culture.

Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;The Master&quot; features a religious leader named Lancaster Dodd, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, who is based on Hubbard and shares a physical resemblance to him. The film depicts a Navy washout with psychological issues who is unable to hold down steady employment after the war. Facing potential legal troubles, he flees California by stowing away on a ship captained by self-proclaimed nuclear physicist and philosopher Lancaster Dodd, leader of a movement called &quot;The Cause&quot;.

On December 5, 2013, The Eric Andre Show aired a comedy sketch titled &quot;Black Scientologists&quot; where André&#x27;s character proclaims &quot;Not a lot of people know this, but L. Ron Hubbard was a black man. His real name was L. Ron Hoyabembe!&quot;, while revealing an artist&#x27;s conception of Hubbard wearing an afro.
In April 2015, following the recent release of &quot;Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; aired a music video featuring the &quot;Church of Neurotology&quot;, a parody of Scientology&#x27;s 1990 music video &quot;We Stand Tall&quot;. Bobby Moynihan played a Hubbard-lookalike in the video. From 2018 to 2019, the show &quot;Strange Angel&quot; dramatized the life of Jack Parsons. In the season 2 finale, actor Daniel Abeles played Hubbard.

According to Hugh B. Urban in the book &quot;Handbook of Scientology&quot;, the nature of popular media accounts of Scientology is largely due to its culture of secrecy. An example of Scientology being &quot;America&#x27;s most secretive religion&quot; is the documentary &quot;The Secrets of Scientology&quot;. Urban states, &quot;However, while these popular accounts are often sensational and not particularly balanced, they do highlight the fact that secrecy has in fact been a pervasive aspect of the church from its inception.&quot;

<text>The Luddites were members of a 19th-century movement of English textile workers who opposed the use of certain types of automated machinery due to concerns relating to worker pay and output quality. They often destroyed the machines in organised raids. Members of the group referred to themselves as Luddites, self-described followers of &quot;Ned Ludd&quot;, a legendary weaver whose name was used as a pseudonym in threatening letters to mill owners and government officials.

The Luddite movement began in Nottingham, England, and spread to the North West and Yorkshire between 1811 and 1816. Mill and factory owners took to shooting protesters and eventually the movement was suppressed by legal and military force, which included execution and penal transportation of accused and convicted Luddites.

Over time, the term has been used to refer to those opposed to the introduction of new technologies.

== Etymology ==
The name Luddite () occurs in the movement&#x27;s writings as early as 1811. The movement utilised the eponym of Ned Ludd, an apocryphal apprentice who allegedly smashed two stocking frames in 1779 after being criticized and instructed to change his method. The name often appears as captain, General, or King Ludd. Different versions of the legends place his residence in Anstey, near Leicester, or Sherwood Forest like Robin Hood.

== Historical precedents ==
The machine-breaking of the Luddites followed from previous outbreaks of sabotage in the English textile industry, especially in the hosiery and woolen trades. Organized action by stockingers had occurred at various times since 1675. In Lancashire, new cotton spinning technologies were met with violent resistance in 1768 and 1779. These new inventions produced textiles faster and cheaper because they could be operated by less-skilled, low-wage labourers. These struggles sometimes resulted in government suppression, via Parliamentary acts such as the Protection of Stocking Frames, etc. Act 1788.

Periodic uprisings relating to asset prices also occurred in other contexts in the century before Luddism. Irregular rises in food prices provoked the Keelmen to riot in the port of Tyne in 1710 and tin miners to steal from granaries at Falmouth in 1727. There was a rebellion in Northumberland and Durham in 1740, and an assault on Quaker corn dealers in 1756.

Malcolm L. Thomas argued in his 1970 history &quot;The Luddites&quot; that machine-breaking was one of the very few tactics that workers could use to increase pressure on employers, undermine lower-paid competing workers, and create solidarity among workers. &quot;These attacks on machines did not imply any necessary hostility to machinery as such; machinery was just a conveniently exposed target against which an attack could be made.&quot; Historian Eric Hobsbawm has called their machine wrecking &quot;collective bargaining by riot&quot;, which had been a tactic used in Britain since the Restoration because manufactories were scattered throughout the country, and that made it impractical to hold large-scale strikes. An agricultural variant of Luddism occurred during the widespread Swing Riots of 1830 in southern and eastern England, centring on breaking threshing machines.

== Peak activity: 1811–1817 ==

The Luddite movement emerged during the harsh economic climate of the Napoleonic Wars, which saw a rise in difficult working conditions in the new textile factories. Luddites objected primarily to the rising popularity of automated textile equipment, threatening the jobs and livelihoods of skilled workers as this technology allowed them to be replaced by cheaper and less skilled workers. The movement began in Arnold, Nottinghamshire, on 11 March 1811 and spread rapidly throughout England over the following two years. The British economy suffered greatly in 1810 to 1812, especially in terms of high unemployment and inflation. The causes included the high cost of the wars with Napoleon, Napoleon&#x27;s Continental System of economic warfare, and escalating conflict with the United States. The crisis led to widespread protest and violence, but the middle classes and upper classes strongly supported the government, which used the army to suppress all working-class unrest, especially the Luddite movement.

The Luddites met at night on the moors surrounding industrial towns to practice military-like drills and manoeuvres. Their main areas of operation began in Nottinghamshire in November 1811, followed by the West Riding of Yorkshire in early 1812, and then Lancashire by March 1813. They wrecked specific types of machinery that posed a threat to the particular industrial interests in each region. In the Midlands, these were the &quot;wide&quot; knitting frames used to make cheap and inferior lace articles. In the North West, weavers sought to eliminate the steam-powered looms threatening wages in the cotton trade. In Yorkshire, workers opposed the use of shearing frames and gig mills to finish woolen cloth.

Many Luddite groups were highly organized and pursued machine-breaking as one of several tools for achieving specific political ends. In addition to the raids, Luddites coordinated public demonstrations and the mailing of letters to local industrialists and government officials. These letters explained their reasons for destroying the machinery and threatened further action if the use of &quot;obnoxious&quot; machines continued. The writings of Midlands Luddites often justified their demands through the legitimacy of the Company of Framework Knitters, a recognized public body that already openly negotiated with masters through named representatives. In North West England, textile workers lacked these long-standing trade institutions and their letters composed an attempt to achieve recognition as a united body of tradespeople. As such, they were more likely to include petitions for governmental reforms, such as increased minimum wages and the cessation of child labor. Northwestern Luddites were also more likely to use radical language linking their movement to that of American and French revolutionaries. In Yorkshire, the letter-writing campaign shifted to more violent threats against local authorities viewed as complicit in the use of offensive machinery to exert greater commercial control over the labor market.

In Yorkshire, the croppers (who were highly skilled and highly paid) faced mass unemployment due to the introduction of cropping machines by Enoch Taylor of Marsden. This sparked the Luddite movement among the croppers of Yorkshire, who used a power hammer dubbed &quot;Enoch&quot; to break the frames of the cropping machines. They called it Enoch to mock Enoch Taylor, and when they broke the frames they purportedly shouted &quot;Enoch made them, and Enoch shall break them.&quot;

Luddites clashed with government troops at Burton&#x27;s Mill in Middleton and at Westhoughton Mill, both in Lancashire. The Luddites and their supporters anonymously sent death threats to, and possibly attacked, magistrates and food merchants. Activists smashed Heathcote&#x27;s lace making machine in Loughborough in 1816. He and other industrialists had secret chambers constructed in their buildings that could be used as hiding places during an attack.

In 1817 Jeremiah Brandreth, an unemployed Nottingham stockinger and probable ex-Luddite, led the Pentrich Rising. While this was a general uprising unrelated to machinery, it can be viewed as the last major Luddite act.

== Government response ==

12,000 government troops, most of them belonging to militia or yeomanry units, were involved in suppression of Luddite activity, which historian Eric Hobsbawm claimed was a larger number than the British army which the Duke of Wellington led during the Peninsular War. Four Luddites, led by a man named George Mellor, ambushed and assassinated mill owner William Horsfall of Ottiwells Mill in Marsden, West Yorkshire, at Crosland Moor in Huddersfield. Horsfall had remarked that he would &quot;Ride up to his saddle in Luddite blood&quot;. Mellor fired the fatal shot to Horsfall&#x27;s groin, and all four men were arrested. One of the men, Benjamin Walker, turned informant, and the other three were hanged. Lord Byron denounced what he considered to be the plight of the working class, the government&#x27;s inane policies and ruthless repression in the House of Lords on 27 February 1812:

Government officials sought to suppress the Luddite movement with a mass trial at York in January 1813, following the attack on Cartwrights Mill at Rawfolds near Cleckheaton. The government charged over 60 men, including Mellor and his companions, with various crimes in connection with Luddite activities. While some of those charged were actual Luddites, many had no connection to the movement. Although the proceedings were legitimate jury trials, many were abandoned due to lack of evidence and 30 men were acquitted. These trials were certainly intended to act as show trials to deter other Luddites from continuing their activities. The harsh sentences of those found guilty, which included execution and penal transportation, quickly ended the movement. Parliament made &quot;machine breaking&quot; (i.e. industrial sabotage) a capital crime with the Destruction of Stocking Frames, etc. Act 1812. Lord Byron opposed this legislation, becoming one of the few prominent defenders of the Luddites after the treatment of the defendants at the York trials.

== Legacy ==
The Luddites (specifically the croppers, those who operated cropping machinery) are memorialized in the Yorkshire-area folk song &quot;The Cropper Lads,&quot; which has been recorded by artists such as Lou Killen and Maddy Prior. The croppers were very highly skilled and highly paid before the introduction of cropping machinery, and thus had more to lose and more reason to rebel against the factory owners&#x27; use of machinery. Another traditional song which celebrates the Luddites is the song &quot;The Triumph of General Ludd,&quot; which was recorded by Chumbawamba for their 1988 album English Rebel Songs.

In the 19th century, occupations that arose from the growth of trade and shipping in ports, also as &quot;domestic&quot; manufacturers, were notorious for precarious employment prospects. Underemployment was chronic during this period, and it was common practice to retain a larger workforce than was typically necessary for insurance against labour shortages in boom times.

Moreover, the organization of manufacture by merchant capitalists in the textile industry was inherently unstable. While the financiers&#x27; capital was still largely invested in raw materials, it was easy to increase commitment when trade was good and almost as easy to cut back when times were bad. Merchant capitalists lacked the incentive of later factory owners, whose capital was invested in buildings and plants, to maintain a steady rate of production and return on fixed capital. The combination of seasonal variations in wage rates and violent short-term fluctuations springing from harvests and war produced periodic outbreaks of violence.

== Modern usage ==
Nowadays, the term &quot;Luddite&quot; often is used to describe someone who is opposed or resistant to new technologies.

In 1956, during a British Parliamentary debate, a Labour spokesman said that &quot;organised workers were by no means wedded to a &#x27;Luddite Philosophy&#x27;.&quot; By 2006, the term &quot;neo-Luddism&quot; had emerged to describe opposition to many forms of technology. According to a manifesto drawn up by the Second Luddite Congress (April 1996; Barnesville, Ohio), neo-Luddism is &quot;a leaderless movement of passive resistance to consumerism and the increasingly bizarre and frightening technologies of the Computer Age&quot;.

The term &quot;Luddite fallacy&quot; is used by economists about the fear that technological unemployment inevitably generates structural unemployment and is consequently macroeconomically injurious. If a technological innovation reduces necessary labour inputs in a given sector, then the industry-wide cost of production falls, which lowers the competitive price and increases the equilibrium supply point that, theoretically, will require an increase in aggregate labour inputs. During the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century, the dominant view among economists has been that belief in long-term technological unemployment was indeed a fallacy. More recently, there has been increased support for the view that the benefits of automation are not equally distributed.

<text>Anarchist communism is a far-left political ideology and anarchist school of thought that advocates communism. It calls for the abolition of private property but retention of personal property and collectively-owned items, goods, and services. It supports social ownership of property and the distribution of resources (i.e. from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs).

Anarchist communism was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association. The theoretical work of Peter Kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro-organizationalist and insurrectionary anti-organizationalist section. Examples of anarchist communist societies are the anarchist territories of the Makhnovshchina during the Russian Revolution, and those of the Spanish Revolution, most notably revolutionary Catalonia.

== History ==
=== Forerunners ===
The modern current of communism was founded by the Neo-Babouvists
of the journal (published in mid-1841),
who drew from the &quot;anti-political and anarchist ideas&quot; of Sylvain Maréchal (1750–1803).
The foundations of anarcho-communism were laid by Théodore Dézamy in his 1843 work &quot;Code de la Communauté&quot;,
which he formulated as a critique of Étienne Cabet&#x27;s utopian socialism. In his &quot;Code&quot;, Dézamy advocated the abolition of money, of the division of labour and of the state.
He also championed the introduction of common ownership of property and the distribution of resources &quot;from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs&quot;. In anticipation of anarchist communism, Dézamy rejected the need for a transitional stage between capitalism and communism, instead calling for immediate communisation through the direct cessation of commerce.

Following the French Revolution of 1848, Joseph Déjacque (1821-1865) formulated a radical form of communism that opposed both the revolutionary republicanism of Auguste Blanqui and the mutualism of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. Déjacque opposed the authoritarian conception of a &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; as discussed by Joseph Weydemeyer and by Karl Marx from 1852 onwards; he regarded it as inherently reactionary and counter-revolutionary. Instead, he upheld the autonomy and self-organisation of workers, which he saw expressed during the 1848 June Days uprising in Paris against the representative politics of governmentalism. Opposed not just to government, but to all forms of oppression, Déjacque advocated for a social revolution to abolish the state, as well as religion, what would become known as the nuclear family, and private property. In their place, Déjacque upheld a form of anarchy based on the free distribution of resources.

Déjacque particularly focused his critique on private commerce, such as that espoused by Proudhon and by the Ricardian socialists of the 1820s and 1830s. He advocated workers&#x27; right to the satisfaction of their needs, rather than to keep the product of their own labour, as he felt the latter would inevitably lead to capital accumulation. He thus advocated for all property to be held under common ownership and for &quot;unlimited freedom of production and consumption&quot;, subordinated only to the authority of the &quot;statistics book&quot;. In order to guarantee the universal satisfaction of needs, Déjacque saw the need for the abolition of forced labour through workers&#x27; self-management, and the abolition of the division of labour through integrating the proletariat and the intelligentsia into a single class. In order to achieve this vision of a communist society, he proposed a transitionary period of in which direct democracy and direct exchange would be upheld, positions of state would undergo democratization, and the police and military would be abolished. 

Déjacque&#x27;s communist platform, outlined in his &quot;Humanisphere&quot; (1859), preceded the program of the 1871 Paris Commune, and anticipated the anarcho-communism later elaborated by Errico Malatesta (1853-1932), Peter Kropotkin (1842-1921) and Luigi Galleani (1862-1931).

=== Formulation in the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association ===
The International Workingmen&#x27;s Association (IWA) was established in 1864, at a time when a formalised anarchist movement did not yet exist. Of the few individual anarchists who were influential at this time, it was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, with his conception of federalism and his advocacy of abstentionism, who inspired many of the French delegates who founded the IWA and laid the groundwork for the growth of anarchism. Among the French delegates were a more radical minority that opposed Proudhon&#x27;s mutualism, which held the nuclear family as its base social unit. Led by the trade-unionist Eugène Varlin, the radicals advocated for a &quot;non-authoritarian communism&quot;, which upheld the commune as the base social unit and advocated for the universal access to education. The entry of Mikhail Bakunin (1814-1876) into the IWA in 1868 first infused the federalists with a programme of revolutionary socialism and anti-statism, which agitated for workers&#x27; self-management and direct action against capitalism and the state.

By this time, the Marxists of the IWA had begun to denounce their anti-authoritarian opponents as &quot;anarchists&quot;, a label previously adopted by Proudhon and Déjacque and later accepted by the anti-authoritarians themselves. Following the defeat of the Paris Commune in 1871, the IWA split over questions of socialist economics and the means of bringing about a classless society. Karl Marx, who favoured the conquest of state power by political parties, banned the anarchists from the IWA. The anarchist faction around the Jura Federation resolved to reconstitute as their own Anti-Authoritarian International, which they constructed as a more decentralised and federal organisation. Two of the IWA&#x27;s largest branches, in Italy and Spain, repudiated Marxism and adopted the anti-authoritarian platform.
As a collectivist, Bakunin had himself opposed communism, which he regarded as an inherently authoritarian ideology. But with Bakunin&#x27;s death in 1876, the anarchists began to shift away from his theory of collectivism and towards an anarchist communism. The term &quot;anarchist communism&quot; was first printed in François Dumartheray&#x27;s February 1876 pamphlet, &quot;To manual workers, supporters of political action&quot;. Élisée Reclus was quick to express his support for anarchist communism, at a meeting of the Anti-Authoritarian International in Lausanne the following month. James Guillaume&#x27;s August 1876 pamphlet, &quot;Ideas on Social Organisation&quot;, outlined a proposal by which the collective ownership of the means of production could be used in order to transition towards a communist society. Guillaume considered a necessary prerequisite for communism would be a general condition of abundance, which could set the foundation for the abandonment of exchange value and the free distribution of resources. This program for anarcho-communism was adopted by the Italian anarchists, who had already begun to question collectivism.
Although Guillaume had himself remained neutral throughout the debate, in September 1877, the Italian anarcho-communists clashed with the Spanish collectivists in Verviers at what would be the Anti-Authoritarian International&#x27;s final congress. Alongside the economic question, the two factions were also divided by the question of organisation. While the collectivists upheld trade unions as a means for achieving anarchy, the communists considered them to be inherently reformist and counter-revolutionary organisations, prone to bureaucracy and corruption. Instead, the communists preferred small, loosely-organised affinity groups, which they believed closer conformed to anti-authoritarian principles. 

In October 1880, a Congress of the defunct International&#x27;s Jura Federation adopted Carlo Cafiero&#x27;s programme of &quot;Anarchy and Communism&quot;, which outlined a clear break with Guillaume&#x27;s collectivist programme. Cafiero rejected the use of an exchange value and the collective ownership of industry, which he believed would lead to capital accumulation and consequently to social stratification. Instead, Cafiero called for the abolition of all wage labour (which he saw as a relic of capitalism) and for the distribution of resources &quot;from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs&quot;.

=== Organizationalism vs. insurrectionarism and expansion ===

As anarcho-communism emerged in the mid-19th century, it had an intense debate with Bakuninist collectivism and, within the anarchist movement, over participation in the workers&#x27; movement, as well as on other issues. So in Kropotkin&#x27;s anarcho-communist theory of evolution, the risen people themselves are meant to be the rational industrial manager rather than a working class organized as enterprise.

Between 1880 and 1890, with the &quot;perspective of an immanent revolution&quot;, which was &quot;opposed to the official workers&#x27; movement, which was then in the process of formation (general Social Democratisation) [anarchist communists] were opposed not only to political (statist) struggles but also to strikes which put forward wage or other claims, or which were organised by trade unions.&quot; However, &quot;[w]hile they were not opposed to strikes as such, they were opposed to trade unions and the struggle for the eight-hour day. This anti-reformist tendency was accompanied by an anti-organisational tendency, and its partisans declared themselves in favor of agitation amongst the unemployed for the expropriation of foodstuffs and other articles, for the expropriatory strike and, in some cases, for &#x27;individual recuperation&#x27; or acts of terrorism.&quot;

Even after Peter Kropotkin and others overcame their initial reservations and decided to enter labor unions, anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists remained, such as Sébastien Faure&#x27;s &quot;Le Libertaire&quot; group and Russian partisans of economic terrorism and s. 

Most anarchist publications in the United States appeared in Yiddish, German, or Russian. However, the American anarcho-communist journal &quot;The Firebrand&quot; was published in English, permitting the dissemination of anarchist communist thought to English-speaking populations in the United States.

According to the anarchist historian Max Nettlau, the first use of the term &quot;libertarian communism&quot; came with the 1880 Le Havre anarchist congress used the phrase to identify its doctrines more clearly.
The French anarchist journalist Sébastien Faure, later founder and editor of the four-volume &quot;Anarchist Encyclopedia,&quot; started the weekly paper (&quot;The Libertarian&quot;) in 1895.

=== Methods of organizing: platformism vs. synthesism ===

In Ukraine, the anarcho-communist guerrilla leader Nestor Makhno led an independent anarchist army from 1918 to 1921 during the Russian Civil War of 1917-1923. A commander of the Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine, Makhno led a guerrilla campaign opposing both the Bolshevik &quot;Reds&quot; and monarchist &quot;Whites&quot;. The Makhnovist movement made various tactical military pacts while fighting various reactionary forces and organizing an anarchist society committed to resisting state authority, whether capitalist or Bolshevik.

The Dielo Truda platform in Spain also met with strong criticism. Miguel Jimenez, a founding member of the Iberian Anarchist Federation (FAI, founded in 1927), summarized this as follows: too much influence in it of Marxism, it erroneously divided and reduced anarchists between individualist anarchists and anarcho-communist sections, and it wanted to unify the anarchist movement along the lines of the anarcho-communists. Jimenez saw anarchism as more complex than that, that anarchist tendencies are not mutually exclusive as the platformists saw it and that both individualist and communist views could accommodate  anarcho-syndicalism. Sébastian Faure had strong contacts in Spain, so his proposal had more impact on Spanish anarchists than the Dielo Truda platform, even though individualist anarchist influence in Spain was less intense than it was in France. The main goal there was reconciling anarcho-communism with anarcho-syndicalism.

=== Spanish Revolution of 1936 ===
The most extensive application of anarcho-communist ideas happened in the anarchist territories during the Spanish Revolution of 1936.
In Spain, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) initially refused to join a popular-front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right-wing election victory. In 1936, the CNT changed its policy, and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup, which led to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939. In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and industrial workers, supported by armed militias, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain, where they collectivized the land. However, even before the fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the Stalinists, who controlled the distribution of military aid from the Soviet Union to the Republican cause. The events known as the &quot;Spanish Revolution&quot; was a workers&#x27; social revolution that began during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and, more broadly, libertarian socialist organizational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily in Catalonia, Aragon, Andalusia, and parts of the Levante. Much of Spain&#x27;s economy was put under worker control; in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia, the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy Communist Party of Spain influence, as the Soviet-allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivization-enactment. Factories were run through worker committees, and agrarian areas became collectivized and ran as libertarian communes. 

Anarchist Gaston Leval estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution, which historian Sam Dolgoff claimed was the closest any revolution had come to realizing a free, stateless mass society. Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident Marxists and anarchists.

=== Post-war years ===
Anarcho-communism entered into internal debates over the organization issue in the post-World War II era. Founded in October 1935, the Anarcho-Communist Federation of Argentina (FACA, Federación Anarco-Comunista Argentina) in 1955 renamed itself the Argentine Libertarian Federation. The Fédération Anarchiste (FA), founded in Paris on 2 December 1945, elected the platformist anarcho-communist George Fontenis as its first secretary the following year. It was composed of a majority of activists from the former FA (which supported Volin&#x27;s Synthesis) and some members of the former Union Anarchiste (which supported the CNT-FAI support to the Republican government during the Spanish Civil War), as well as some young Resistants.
In 1950 a clandestine group formed within the FA called Organisation Pensée Bataille (OPB), led by George Fontenis. 

The new decision-making process was founded on unanimity: each person has a right of veto on the orientations of the federation. The FCL published the same year . Several groups quit the FCL in December 1955, disagreeing with the decision to present &quot;revolutionary candidates&quot; to the legislative elections. On 15–20 August 1954, the Ve intercontinental plenum of the CNT took place. A group called appeared, which was formed of militants who did not like the new ideological orientation that the OPB was giving the FCL seeing it was authoritarian and almost Marxist. The FCL lasted until 1956, just after participating in state legislative elections with ten candidates. This move alienated some members of the FCL and thus produced the end of the organization. A group of militants who disagreed with the FA turning into FCL reorganized a new Federation Anarchiste established in December 1953. This included those who formed &quot;L&#x27;Entente anarchiste,&quot; who joined the new FA and then dissolved L&#x27;Entente. The new base principles of the FA were written by the individualist anarchist Charles-Auguste Bontemps and the non-platformist anarcho-communist Maurice Joyeux which established an organization with a plurality of tendencies and autonomy of groups organized around synthesist principles. According to historian Cédric Guérin, the new Federation Anarchiste identity included the unconditional rejection of Marxism, motivated in significant part by the previous conflict with George Fontenis and his OPB. In the 1970s, the French Fédération Anarchiste evolved into a joining of the principles of synthesis anarchism and platformism.

== Philosophical debates ==

Anarchist communism supports social ownership of property.

Rob Sparrow outlined four main reasons why anarcho-communists oppose patriotism:

* The belief in equality for all people
* The use of patriotism to subjugate the working class
* The association between patriotism and militarism
* The use of patriotism to encourage loyalty to the state

<text>London is the capital and largest city of both England and the United Kingdom, with a population of in . Its wider metropolitan area is the largest in Western Europe, with a population of 14.9 million. London stands on the River Thames in southeast England, at the head of a tidal estuary down to the North Sea, and has been a major settlement for nearly 2,000 years. Its ancient core and financial centre, the City of London, was founded by the Romans as Londinium and has retained its medieval boundaries. The City of Westminster, to the west of the City of London, has been the centuries-long host of the national government and parliament. London grew rapidly in the 19th century, becoming the world&#x27;s largest city at the time. Since the 19th century, the name &quot;London&quot; has referred to the metropolis around the City of London, historically split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which since 1965 has largely comprised the administrative area of Greater London, governed by 33 local authorities and the Greater London Authority. 

As one of the world&#x27;s major global cities, London exerts a strong influence on world art, entertainment, fashion, commerce, finance, education, healthcare, media, science, technology, tourism, transport, and communications. Despite a post-Brexit exodus of stock listings from the London Stock Exchange, London remains a European economic powerhouse, and one of the world&#x27;s major financial centres. It hosts Europe&#x27;s largest concentration of higher education institutions, some of which are the highest-ranked academic institutions in the world: Imperial College London in natural and applied sciences, the London School of Economics in social sciences, and the comprehensive University College London. It is the most visited city in Europe and has the world&#x27;s busiest city airport system. The London Underground is the world&#x27;s oldest rapid transit system.

London&#x27;s diverse cultures encompass over 300 languages. The 2023 population of Greater London of just under 10 million made it Europe&#x27;s third-most populous city, accounting for 13.4% of the United Kingdom&#x27;s population and over 16% of England&#x27;s population. The Greater London Built-up Area is the fourth-most populous in Europe, with about 9.8 million inhabitants as of 2011. The London metropolitan area is the third-most populous in Europe, with about 14 million inhabitants as of 2016, making London a megacity.

Four World Heritage Sites are located in London: Kew Gardens; the Tower of London; the site featuring the Palace of Westminster, Church of St. Margaret, and Westminster Abbey; and the historic settlement in Greenwich where the Royal Observatory defines the prime meridian (0° longitude) and Greenwich Mean Time. Other landmarks include Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Piccadilly Circus, St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Tower Bridge, and Trafalgar Square. The city has the most museums, art galleries, libraries, and cultural venues in the UK, including the British Museum, National Gallery, Natural History Museum, Tate Modern, British Library, and numerous West End theatres. Important sporting events held in London include the FA Cup Final, the Wimbledon Tennis Championships, and the London Marathon. It became the first city to host three Summer Olympic Games upon hosting the 2012 Summer Olympics.
==Toponymy==
&quot;London&quot; is an ancient name, attested in the first century AD, usually in the Latinised form . Modern scientific analyses of the name must account for the origins of the different forms found in early sources: Latin (usually ), Old English (usually ), and Welsh (usually ), with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages. It is agreed that the name came into these languages from Common Brythonic; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as or something similar. This was then adapted into Latin as and borrowed into Old English.

Until 1889, the name &quot;London&quot; applied officially only to the City of London, but since then it has also referred to the County of London and to Greater London.

==History==

===Prehistory===
In 1993, remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the south River Thames foreshore, upstream from Vauxhall Bridge. Two of the timbers were radiocarbon dated to 1750–1285 BC. In 2010, foundations of a large timber structure, dated to 4800–4500 BC, were found on the Thames&#x27; south foreshore downstream from Vauxhall Bridge. Both structures are on the south bank of the Thames, where the now-underground River Effra flows into the Thames.

===Roman London===
Despite the evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the Romans around 47 AD, about 4 years after their invasion of 43 AD. This only lasted until about 61 AD, when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it and burnt it to the ground.

The next planned incarnation of Londinium prospered, superseding Colchester as the principal city of the Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its height in the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of about 60,000.

===Anglo-Saxon and Viking-period London===
With the early 5th-century collapse of Roman rule, the walled city of Londinium was effectively abandoned, although Roman civilisation continued around St Martin-in-the-Fields until about 450. From about 500, an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed slightly west of the old Roman city. By about 680 the city had become a major port again, but there is little evidence of large-scale production. From the 820s repeated Viking assaults brought decline. Three are recorded; those in 851 and 886 succeeded, while the last, in 994, was rebuffed.

The Vikings applied Danelaw over much of eastern and northern England, its boundary running roughly from London to Chester as an area of political and geographical control imposed by the Viking incursions formally agreed by the Danish warlord, Guthrum and the West Saxon king Alfred the Great in 886. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records that Alfred &quot;refounded&quot; London in 886. Archaeological research shows this involved abandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman walls. London then grew slowly until a dramatic increase in about 950.

By the 11th century, London was clearly the largest town in England. Westminster Abbey, rebuilt in Romanesque style by King Edward the Confessor, was one of the grandest churches in Europe. Winchester had been the capital of Anglo-Saxon England, but from this time London became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war. In the view of Frank Stenton: &quot;It had the resources, and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self-consciousness appropriate to a national capital.&quot;

===Middle Ages===

After winning the Battle of Hastings, William, Duke of Normandy was crowned King of England in the newly completed Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066. William built the Tower of London, the first of many such in England rebuilt in stone in the south-eastern corner of the city, to intimidate the inhabitants. In 1097, William II began building Westminster Hall, near the abbey. It became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster.

In the 12th century, the institutions of central government, which had hitherto followed the royal English court around the country, grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed, for most purposes at Westminster, although the royal treasury came to rest in the Tower. While the City of Westminster developed into a true governmental capital, its distinct neighbour, the City of London, remained England&#x27;s largest city and principal commercial centre and flourished under its own unique administration, the Corporation of London. In 1100, its population was some 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000. With the Black Death in the mid-14th century, London lost nearly a third of its population. London was the focus of the Peasants&#x27; Revolt in 1381.

London was a centre of England&#x27;s Jewish population before their expulsion by Edward I in 1290. Violence against Jews occurred in 1190, when it was rumoured that the new king had ordered their massacre after they had presented themselves at his coronation. In 1264 during the Second Barons&#x27; War, Simon de Montfort&#x27;s rebels killed 500 Jews while attempting to seize records of debts.

===Early modern===
During the Tudor period, the Reformation produced a gradual shift to Protestantism. Much of London property passed from church to private ownership, which accelerated trade and business in the city. In 1475, the Hanseatic League set up a main trading base (&quot;kontor&quot;) of England in London, called the &quot;Stalhof&quot; or &quot;Steelyard&quot;. It remained until 1853, when the Hanseatic cities of Lübeck, Bremen and Hamburg sold the property to South Eastern Railway. Woollen cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from 14th/15th century London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries.

Yet English maritime enterprise hardly reached beyond the seas of north-west Europe. The commercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean was normally through Antwerp and over the Alps; any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from England were likely to be Italian or Ragusan. The reopening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565 spurred a burst of commercial activity. The Royal Exchange was founded. Mercantilism grew and monopoly traders such as the East India Company were founded as trade expanded to the New World. London became the main North Sea port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from about 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.
In the 16th century, William Shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in London during English Renaissance theatre. Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe Theatre was constructed in 1599 in Southwark. Stage performances came to a halt in London when Puritan authorities shut down the theatres in the 1640s. The ban on theatre was lifted during the Restoration in 1660, and London&#x27;s oldest operating theatre, Drury Lane, opened in 1663 in what is now the West End theatre district.

By the end of the Tudor period in 1603, London was still compact. There was an assassination attempt on James I in Westminster, in the Gunpowder Plot of 5 November 1605. In 1637, the government of Charles I attempted to reform administration in the London area. This called for the Corporation of the city to extend its jurisdiction and administration over expanding areas around the city. Fearing an attempt by the Crown to diminish the Liberties of London, coupled with a lack of interest in administering these additional areas or concern by city guilds of having to share power, caused the Corporation&#x27;s &quot;The Great Refusal&quot;, a decision which largely continues to account for the unique governmental status of the City.
In the English Civil War, the majority of Londoners supported the Parliamentary cause. After an initial advance by the Royalists in 1642, culminating in the battles of Brentford and Turnham Green, London was surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall known as the Lines of Communication. The lines were built by up to 20,000 people, and were completed in under two months. The fortifications failed their only test when the New Model Army entered London in 1647, and they were levelled by Parliament the same year. London was plagued by disease in the early 17th century, culminating in the Great Plague of 1665–1666, which killed up to 100,000 people, or a fifth of the population. The Great Fire of London broke out in 1666 in Pudding Lane in the city and quickly swept through the wooden buildings. Rebuilding took over 10 years and was supervised by polymath Robert Hooke. 

In 1710, Christopher Wren&#x27;s masterpiece, St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, was completed, replacing its medieval predecessor that burned in the Great Fire of 1666. The dome of St Paul&#x27;s dominated the London skyline for centuries, inspiring the artworks and writing of William Blake, with his 1789 poem &quot;Holy Thursday&quot; referring to &#x27;the high dome of Pauls&#x27;. During the Georgian era, new districts such as Mayfair were formed in the west; new bridges over the Thames encouraged development in South London. In the east, the Port of London expanded downstream. London&#x27;s development as an international financial centre matured for much of the 18th century.

In 1762, George III acquired Buckingham House, which was enlarged over the next 75 years. During the 18th century, London was said to be dogged by crime, and the Bow Street Runners were established in 1750 as a professional police force. Epidemics during the 1720s and 30s saw most children born in the city die before reaching their fifth birthday.

Coffee-houses became a popular place to debate ideas, as growing literacy and development of the printing press made news widely available, with Fleet Street becoming the centre of the British press. The invasion of Amsterdam by Napoleonic armies led many financiers to relocate to London and the first London international issue was arranged in 1817. Around the same time, the Royal Navy became the world&#x27;s leading war fleet, acting as a major deterrent to potential economic adversaries. Following a fire in 1838, the Royal Exchange was redesigned by William Tite and rebuilt in 1844. The repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 was specifically aimed at weakening Dutch economic power. London then overtook Amsterdam as the leading international financial centre.

===Late modern and contemporary===
With the onset of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, an unprecedented growth in urbanisation took place, and the number of High Streets (the primary street for retail in Britain) rapidly grew. London was the world&#x27;s largest city from about 1831 to 1925, with a population density of 802 per acre (325 per hectare). In addition to the growing number of stores selling goods, such as Harding, Howell &amp; Co.—one of the first department stores—located on Pall Mall, the streets had scores of street sellers. London&#x27;s overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics, claiming 14,000 lives in 1848, and 6,000 in 1866. Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the London Underground, the world&#x27;s first urban rail network. The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889 when the London County Council was created out of county areas surrounding the capital.

From the early years of the 20th century onwards, teashops were found on High Streets across London and the rest of Britain, with Lyons, who opened the first of their chain of teashops in Piccadilly in 1894, leading the way. The tearooms, such as the Criterion in Piccadilly, became a popular meeting place for women from the suffrage movement. The city was the target of many attacks during the suffragette bombing and arson campaign, between 1912 and 1914, which saw historic landmarks such as Westminster Abbey and St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral bombed.

London was bombed by the Germans in the First World War, and during the Second World War, the Blitz and other bombings by the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; killed over 30,000 Londoners, destroying large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city. The tomb of the Unknown Warrior, an unidentified member of the British armed forces killed during the First World War, was buried in Westminster Abbey on 11 November 1920. The Cenotaph, located in Whitehall, was unveiled on the same day, and is the focal point for the National Service of Remembrance held annually on Remembrance Sunday, the closest Sunday to 11 November.

The 1948 Summer Olympics were held at the original Wembley Stadium, while London was still recovering from the war. From the 1940s, London became home to many immigrants, primarily from Commonwealth countries such as Jamaica, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, making London one of the most diverse cities in the world. In 1951, the Festival of Britain was held on the South Bank. The Great Smog of 1952 led to the Clean Air Act 1956, which ended the &quot;pea soup fogs&quot; for which London had been notorious, and had earned it the nickname the &quot;Big Smoke&quot;.

Starting mainly in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for worldwide youth culture, exemplified by the Swinging London sub-culture associated with the King&#x27;s Road, Chelsea and Carnaby Street. The role of trendsetter revived in the punk era. In 1965 London&#x27;s political boundaries were expanded in response to the growth of the urban area and a new Greater London Council was created. During The Troubles in Northern Ireland, London was hit from 1973 by bomb attacks by the Provisional Irish Republican Army. These attacks lasted for two decades, starting with the Old Bailey bombing. Racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 Brixton riot.

Greater London&#x27;s population declined in the decades after the Second World War, from an estimated peak of 8.6 million in 1939 to around 6.8 million in the 1980s. The principal ports for London moved downstream to Felixstowe and Tilbury, with the London Docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration, including the Canary Wharf development. This was born out of London&#x27;s increasing role as an international financial centre in the 1980s. Located about 2 miles (3 km) east of central London, the Thames Barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the North Sea.

The Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, leaving London with no central administration until 2000 and the creation of the Greater London Authority. To mark the 21st century, the Millennium Dome, London Eye and Millennium Bridge were constructed. On 6 July 2005 London was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics, as the first city to stage the Olympic Games three times. On 7 July 2005, three London Underground trains and a double-decker bus were bombed in a series of terrorist attacks.

In 2008, &quot;Time&quot; named London alongside New York City and Hong Kong as Nylonkong, hailing them as the world&#x27;s three most influential global cities. In January 2015, Greater London&#x27;s population was estimated to be 8.63 million, its highest since 1939. During the Brexit referendum in 2016, the UK as a whole decided to leave the European Union, but most London constituencies voted for remaining. However, Britain&#x27;s exit from the EU in early 2020 only marginally weakened London&#x27;s position as an international financial centre.

==Administration==
===Local government===
The administration of London is formed of two tiers: a citywide, strategic tier and a local tier. Citywide administration is coordinated by the Greater London Authority (GLA), while local administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities. The GLA consists of two elected components: the mayor of London, who has executive powers, and the London Assembly, which scrutinises the mayor&#x27;s decisions and can accept or reject the mayor&#x27;s budget proposals each year. The GLA has responsibility for the majority of London&#x27;s transport system through its functional arm Transport for London (TfL), it is responsible for overseeing the city&#x27;s police and fire services, and also for setting a strategic vision for London on a range of issues. The headquarters of the GLA is City Hall, Newham. The mayor since 2016 has been Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a major Western capital. The mayor&#x27;s statutory planning strategy is published as the London Plan, which was most recently revised in 2011.

The local authorities are the councils of the 32 London boroughs and the City of London Corporation. They are responsible for most local services, such as local planning, schools, libraries, leisure and recreation, social services, local roads and refuse collection. Certain functions, such as waste management, are provided through joint arrangements. In 2009–2010 the combined revenue expenditure by London councils and the GLA amounted to just over £22 billion (£14.7 billion for the boroughs and £7.4 billion for the GLA).

The London Fire Brigade is the statutory fire and rescue service for Greater London, run by the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority. It is the third largest fire service in the world. National Health Service ambulance services are provided by the London Ambulance Service (LAS) NHS Trust, the largest free-at-the-point-of-use emergency ambulance service in the world. The London Air Ambulance charity operates in conjunction with the LAS where required. Her Majesty&#x27;s Coastguard and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution operate on the River Thames, which is under the jurisdiction of the Port of London Authority from Teddington Lock to the sea.

===National government===

London is the seat of the Government of the United Kingdom. Many government departments, as well as the prime minister&#x27;s residence at 10 Downing Street, are based close to the Palace of Westminster, particularly along Whitehall. There are 75 members of Parliament (MPs) from London; As of June 2024, 59 are from the Labour Party, 9 are Conservatives, 6 are Liberal Democrats and one constituency is held by an independent. The ministerial post of minister for London was created in 1994, however as of 2024, the post has been vacant.

===Policing and crime===

Policing in Greater London, with the exception of the City of London, is provided by the Metropolitan Police (&quot;The Met&quot;), overseen by the mayor through the Mayor&#x27;s Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC). The Met is also referred to as Scotland Yard after the location of its original headquarters in a road called Great Scotland Yard in Whitehall. The City of London has its own police force – the City of London Police. First worn by Met police officers in 1863, the custodian helmet has been called a &quot;cultural icon&quot; and a &quot;symbol of British law enforcement&quot;. Introduced by the Met in 1929, the blue police telephone box (basis for the TARDIS in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;) was once a common sight throughout London and regional cities in the UK.
The British Transport Police are responsible for police services on National Rail, London Underground, Docklands Light Railway and Tramlink services.
The Ministry of Defence Police is a special police force in London, which does not generally become involved with policing the general public. The UK&#x27;s domestic counter-intelligence service (MI5) is headquartered in Thames House on the north bank of the River Thames and the foreign intelligence service (MI6) is headquartered in the SIS Building on the south bank.

Crime rates vary widely across different areas of London. Crime figures are made available nationally at Local Authority and Ward level. In 2015, there were 118 homicides, a 25.5% increase over 2014.
Recorded crime has been rising in London, notably violent crime and murder by stabbing and other means have risen. There were 50 murders from the start of 2018 to mid April 2018. Funding cuts to police in London are likely to have contributed to this, though other factors are involved. However, homicide figures fell in 2022 with 109 recorded for the year, and the murder rate in London is much lower than other major cities around the world.

==Geography==
===Scope===
London, also known as Greater London, is one of nine regions of England and the top subdivision covering most of the city&#x27;s metropolis. The City of London at its core once comprised the whole settlement, but as its urban area grew, the Corporation of London resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with its suburbs, causing &quot;London&quot; to be defined several ways.

Forty percent of Greater London is covered by the London post town, in which &#x27;London&#x27; forms part of postal addresses. The London telephone area code (020) covers a larger area, similar in size to Greater London, although some outer districts are excluded and some just outside included. The Greater London boundary has been aligned to the M25 motorway in places.

Further urban expansion is now prevented by the Metropolitan Green Belt, although the built-up area extends beyond the boundary in places, producing a separately defined Greater London Urban Area. Beyond this is the vast London commuter belt. Greater London is split for some purposes into Inner London and Outer London, and by the River Thames into North and South, with an informal central London area. The coordinates of the nominal centre of London, traditionally the original Eleanor Cross at Charing Cross near the junction of Trafalgar Square and Whitehall, are about .

===Status===
Within London, both the City of London and the City of Westminster have city status. The City of London and the remainder of Greater London are both counties for the purposes of lieutenancies. The area of Greater London includes areas that are part of the historic counties of Middlesex, Kent, Surrey, Essex and Hertfordshire. More recently, Greater London has been defined as a region of England and in this context is known as &quot;London&quot;.

It is the capital of the United Kingdom and of England by convention rather than statute. The capital of England was moved to London from Winchester as the Palace of Westminster developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court, and thus the political capital of the nation.

===Topography===

Greater London encompasses a total area of an area which had a population of 7,172,036 in 2001 and a population density of . The extended area known as the London Metropolitan Region or the London Metropolitan Agglomeration, comprises a total area of has a population of 13,709,000 and a population density of .

Modern London stands on the Thames, its primary geographical feature, a navigable river which crosses the city from the south-west to the east. The Thames Valley is a flood plain surrounded by gently rolling hills including Parliament Hill, Addington Hills, and Primrose Hill. Historically London grew up at the lowest bridging point on the Thames. The Thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive marshlands; at high tide, its shores reached five times their present width.

Since the Victorian era the Thames has been extensively embanked, and many of its London tributaries now flow underground. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding. The threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level caused by climate change and by the slow &#x27;tilting&#x27; of the British Isles as a result of post-glacial rebound.

===Climate===

London has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;). Rainfall records have been kept in the city since at least 1697, when records began at Kew. At Kew, the most rainfall in one month is in November 1755 and the least is in both December 1788 and July 1800. Mile End also had in April 1893. The wettest year on record is 1903, with a total fall of and the driest is 1921, with a total fall of . The average annual precipitation amounts to about 600mm, which is half the annual rainfall of New York City. Despite relatively low annual precipitation, London receives 109.6 rainy days on the 1.0mm threshold annually. London is vulnerable to climate change, and there is concern among hydrological experts that households may run out of water before 2050.

Temperature extremes in London range from at Heathrow on 19 July 2022 down to at Northolt on 13 December 1981. Records for atmospheric pressure have been kept at London since 1692. The highest pressure ever reported is on 20 January 2020.

Summers are generally warm, sometimes hot. London&#x27;s average July high is 23.5 °C (74.3 °F). On average each year, London experiences 31 days above and 4.2 days above . During the 2003 European heat wave, prolonged heat led to hundreds of heat-related deaths. A previous spell of 15 consecutive days above in England in 1976 also caused many heat related deaths. A previous temperature of in August 1911 at the Greenwich station was later disregarded as non-standard. Droughts can also, occasionally, be a problem, especially in summer, most recently in summer 2018, and with much drier than average conditions prevailing from May to December. However, the most consecutive days without rain was 73 days in the spring of 1893.

Winters are generally cool with little temperature variation. Heavy snow is rare but snow usually falls at least once each winter. Spring and autumn can be pleasant. As a large city, London has a considerable urban heat island effect, making the centre of London at times warmer than the suburbs and outskirts.

===Areas===

Places within London&#x27;s vast urban area are identified using area names, such as Mayfair, Southwark, Wembley, and Whitechapel. These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or former boroughs.
Such names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries. Since 1965, Greater London has been divided into 32 London boroughs in addition to the ancient City of London. The City of London is the main financial district, and Canary Wharf has recently developed into a new financial and commercial hub in the Docklands to the east.

The West End is London&#x27;s main entertainment and shopping district, attracting tourists. West London includes expensive residential areas where properties can sell for tens of millions of pounds. The average price for properties in Kensington and Chelsea is over £2 million with a similarly high outlay in most of central London.

The East End is the area closest to the original Port of London, known for its high immigrant population, as well as for being one of the poorest areas in London. The surrounding East London area saw much of London&#x27;s early industrial development; now, brownfield sites throughout the area are being redeveloped as part of the Thames Gateway including the London Riverside and Lower Lea Valley, which was developed into the Olympic Park for the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics.

===Architecture===
London&#x27;s buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, partly because of their varying ages. Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the National Gallery, are constructed from Portland stone. Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed buildings. Few structures in central London pre-date the Great Fire of 1666, these being a few trace Roman remains, the Tower of London and a few scattered Tudor survivors in the city. Further out is, for example, the Tudor-period Hampton Court Palace.

Part of the varied architectural heritage are the 17th-century churches by Christopher Wren, neoclassical financial institutions such as the Royal Exchange and the Bank of England, to the early 20th century Old Bailey courthouse and the 1960s Barbican Estate. The 1939 Battersea Power Station by the river in the south-west is a local landmark, while some railway termini are excellent examples of Victorian architecture, most notably St. Pancras and Paddington. The density of London varies, with high employment density in the central area and Canary Wharf, high residential densities in inner London, and lower densities in Outer London.


The Monument in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the Great Fire of London, which originated nearby. Marble Arch and Wellington Arch, at the north and south ends of Park Lane, respectively, have royal connections, as do the Albert Memorial and Royal Albert Hall in Kensington. Nelson&#x27;s Column (built to commemorate Admiral Horatio Nelson) is a nationally recognised monument in Trafalgar Square, one of the focal points of central London. Older buildings are mainly brick, commonly the yellow London stock brick.

In the dense areas, most of the concentration is via medium- and high-rise buildings. London&#x27;s skyscrapers, such as 30 St Mary Axe (dubbed &quot;The Gherkin&quot;), Tower 42, the Broadgate Tower and One Canada Square, are mostly in the two financial districts, the City of London and Canary Wharf. High-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and other historic buildings. This protective policy, known as &#x27;St Paul&#x27;s Heights&#x27;, has been in operation by the City of London since 1937. Nevertheless, there are a number of tall skyscrapers in central London, including the 95-storey Shard London Bridge, the tallest building in the United Kingdom and Western Europe.

Other notable modern buildings include The Scalpel, 20 Fenchurch Street (dubbed &#x27;The Walkie-Talkie&#x27;), the former City Hall in Southwark, the Art Deco BBC Broadcasting House plus the Postmodernist British Library in Somers Town/Kings Cross and No 1 Poultry by James Stirling. The BT Tower stands at and has a 360 degree coloured LED screen near the top. What was formerly the Millennium Dome, by the Thames to the east of Canary Wharf, is now an entertainment venue called the O2 Arena.

===Natural history===

The London Natural History Society suggests that London is &quot;one of the World&#x27;s Greenest Cities&quot; with more than 40% green space or open water. They indicate that 2000 species of flowering plant have been found growing there and that the tidal Thames supports 120 species of fish. They state that over 60 species of bird nest in central London and that their members have recorded 47 species of butterfly, 1,173 moths and more than 270 kinds of spider around London. London&#x27;s wetland areas support nationally important populations of many water birds. London has 38 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), two national nature reserves and 76 local nature reserves.

Amphibians are common in the capital, including smooth newts living by the Tate Modern, and common frogs, common toads, palmate newts, and great crested newts. On the other hand, native reptiles such as slowworms, common lizards, barred grass snakes, and adders, are mostly only seen in Outer London.
Among other inhabitants of London are 10,000 red foxes, so that there are now 16 foxes for every square mile (6 per square km) of London. Other mammals found in Greater London are hedgehog, brown rat, mice, rabbit, shrew, vole, and grey squirrel. In wilder areas of Outer London, such as Epping Forest, a wide variety of mammals are found, including European hare, badger, field, bank and water vole, wood mouse, yellow-necked mouse, mole, shrew, and weasel, in addition to red fox, grey squirrel and hedgehog. A dead otter was found at The Highway, in Wapping, about 1 mile (1.6 km) from the Tower Bridge, which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city. Ten of England&#x27;s eighteen species of bats have been recorded in Epping Forest: soprano, Nathusius&#x27; and common pipistrelles, common noctule, serotine, barbastelle, Daubenton&#x27;s, brown long-eared, Natterer&#x27;s, and Leisler&#x27;s.

Herds of red and fallow deer roam freely within much of Richmond and Bushy Park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained. Epping Forest is also known for its fallow deer, which can frequently be seen in herds to the north of the Forest. A rare population of melanistic, black fallow deer is also maintained at the Deer Sanctuary near Theydon Bois. Muntjac deer are also found in the forest. While Londoners are accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city, more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature, and whole herds of fallow deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of London&#x27;s green spaces.

==Demography==

London&#x27;s continuous urban area extends beyond Greater London and numbered 9,787,426 people in 2011, while its wider metropolitan area had a population of 12–14 million, depending on the definition used. According to Eurostat, London is the second most populous metropolitan area in Europe. A net 726,000 immigrants arrived there in the period 1991–2001.

The region covers , giving a population density of more than ten times that of any other British region. In population terms, London is the 19th largest city and the 18th largest metropolitan region.

In tenure, 23.1% socially rent within London, 46.8% either own their house outright or with a mortgage or loan and 30% privately rent at the 2021 census. Many Londoner&#x27;s work from home, 42.9% did so at the 2021 census while 20.6% drive a car to work. The biggest decrease in method of transportation was seen within those who take the train and underground, declining from 22.6% in 2011 to 9.6% in 2021. In qualifications, 46.7% of London had census classified Level 4 qualifications or higher, which is predominately university degrees. 16.2% had no qualifications at all.

===Age structure and median age===
London&#x27;s median age is one of the youngest regions in the UK. It was recorded in 2018 that London&#x27;s residents were 36.5 years old, which was younger than the UK median of 40.3.

Children younger than 14 constituted 20.6% of the population in Outer London in 2018, and 18% in Inner London. The 15–24 age group was 11.1% in Outer and 10.2% in Inner London, those aged 25–44 years 30.6% in Outer London and 39.7% in Inner London, those aged 45–64 years 24% and 20.7% in Outer and Inner London respectively. Those aged 65 and over are 13.6% in Outer London, but only 9.3% in Inner London.

=== Country of birth ===
The 2021 census recorded that 3,575,739 people or 40.6% of London&#x27;s population were foreign-born, making it among the cities with the largest immigrant population in terms of absolute numbers and a growth of roughly 3 million since 1971 when the foreign born population was 668,373. 13% of the total population were Asian born (32.1% of the total foreign born population), 7.1% are African born (17.5%), 15.5% are Other European born (38.2%), and 4.2% were born in the Americas and Caribbean (10.3%). The 5 largest single countries of origin were respectively India, Romania, Poland, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

About 56.8% of children born in London in 2021 were born to a mother who was born abroad. This trend has been increasing in the past two decades when foreign born mothers made up 43.3% of births in 2001 in London, becoming the majority in the middle of the 2000s by 2006 comprising 52.5%.

A large degree of the foreign born population who were present at the 2021 census had arrived relatively recently. Of the total population, those that arrived between the years of 2011 and 2021 account for 16.6% of London. Those who arrived between 2001 and 2010 are 10.4%, between 1991 and 2001, 5.7%, and prior to 1990, 7.3%.

===Ethnic groups===

According to the Office for National Statistics, based on the 2021 census, 53.8% of the 8,173,941 inhabitants of London were White, with 36.8% White British, 1.8% White Irish, 0.1% Gypsy/Irish Traveller, 0.4 Roma and 14.7% classified as Other White. Meanwhile, 22.2% of Londoners were of Asian or mixed-Asian descent, with 20.8% being of full Asian descents and 1.4% being of mixed-Asian heritage. Indians accounted for 7.5% of the population, followed by Bangladeshis and Pakistanis at 3.7% and 3.3% respectively. Chinese people accounted for 1.7%, and Arabs for 1.6%. A further 4.6% were classified as &quot;Other Asian&quot;. 15.9% of London&#x27;s population were of Black or mixed-Black descent. 13.5% were of full Black descent, with persons of mixed-Black heritage comprising 2.4%. Black Africans accounted for 7.9% of London&#x27;s population; 3.9% identified as Black Caribbean, and 1.7% as &quot;Other Black&quot;. 5.7% were of mixed race. This ethnic structure has changed considerably since the 1960s. Estimates for 1961 put the total non-White ethnic minority population at 179,109 comprising 2.3% of the population at the time, having risen since then to 1,346,119 and 20.2% in 1991 and 4,068,553 and 46.2% in 2021. Of those of a White British background, estimates for 1971 put the population at 6,500,000 and 87% of the total population, of since fell to 3,239,281 and 36.8% in 2021.

As of 2021, the majority of London&#x27;s school pupils come from ethnic minority backgrounds. 23.9% were White British, 14% Other White, 23.2% Asian, 17.9% Black, 11.3% Mixed, 6.3% Other and 2.3% unclassified. Altogether at the 2021 census, of London&#x27;s 1,695,741 population aged 0 to 15, 42% were White in total, splitting it down into 30.9% who were White British, 0.5% Irish, 10.6% Other White, 23% Asian, 16.4% Black, 12% Mixed and 6.6% another ethnic group.

=== Languages ===
In January 2005, a survey of London&#x27;s ethnic and religious diversity claimed that more than 300 languages were spoken in London and more than 50 non-indigenous communities had populations of more than 10,000. At the 2021 census, 78.4% of Londoners spoke English as their first language. The 5 biggest languages outside of English were Romanian, Spanish, Polish, Bengali, and Portuguese.

===Religion===

According to the 2021 Census, the largest religious groupings were Christians (40.66%), followed by those of no religion (20.7%), Muslims (15%), no response (8.5%), Hindus (5.15%), Jews (1.65%), Sikhs (1.64%), Buddhists (1.0%) and other (0.8%).

London has traditionally been Christian, and has a large number of churches, particularly in the City of London. The well-known St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in the City and Southwark Cathedral south of the river are Anglican administrative centres, while the Archbishop of Canterbury, principal bishop of the Church of England and worldwide Anglican Communion, has his main residence at Lambeth Palace in the London Borough of Lambeth.

Important national and royal ceremonies are shared between St Paul&#x27;s and Westminster Abbey. The Abbey is not to be confused with nearby Westminster Cathedral, the largest Roman Catholic cathedral in England and Wales. Despite the prevalence of Anglican churches, observance is low within the denomination. Anglican Church attendance continues a long, steady decline, according to Church of England statistics.

Notable mosques include the East London Mosque in Tower Hamlets, which is allowed to give the Islamic call to prayer through loudspeakers, the London Central Mosque on the edge of Regent&#x27;s Park and the Baitul Futuh of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. After the oil boom, increasing numbers of wealthy Middle-Eastern Arab Muslims based themselves around Mayfair, Kensington and Knightsbridge in West London. There are large Bengali Muslim communities in the eastern boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Newham.

Large Hindu communities are found in the north-western boroughs of Harrow and Brent, the latter hosting what was until 2006 Europe&#x27;s largest Hindu temple, Neasden Temple. London is home to 44 Hindu temples, including the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir London. There are Sikh communities in East and West London, particularly in Southall, home to one of the largest Sikh populations and the largest Sikh temple outside India.

The majority of British Jews live in London, with notable Jewish communities in Stamford Hill, Stanmore, Golders Green, Finchley, Hampstead, Hendon, and Edgware, all in North London. Bevis Marks Synagogue in the City of London is affiliated to London&#x27;s historic Sephardic Jewish community. It is the only synagogue in Europe to have held regular services continually for over 300 years. Stanmore and Canons Park Synagogue has the largest membership of any Orthodox synagogue in Europe. The London Jewish Forum was set up in 2006 in response to the growing significance of devolved London Government.

===Accents===

Cockney is an accent heard across London, mainly spoken by working-class and lower-middle-class Londoners. It is mainly attributed to the East End and wider East London, having originated there in the 18th century, although it has been suggested that the Cockney style of speech is much older. Some features of Cockney include &quot;Th&quot;-fronting (pronouncing &quot;th&quot; as &quot;f&quot;), &quot;th&quot; inside a word is pronounced with a &quot;v&quot;, &quot;H&quot;-dropping, and, like most English accents, a Cockney accent drops the &quot;r&quot; after a vowel. John Camden Hotten, in his &quot;Slang Dictionary&quot; of 1859, makes reference to Cockney &quot;use of a peculiar slang language&quot; (Cockney rhyming slang) when describing the costermongers of the East End. Since the start of the 21st century the extreme form of the Cockney dialect is less common in parts of the East End itself, with modern strongholds including other parts of London and suburbs in the home counties. This is particularly pronounced in areas like Romford (in the London Borough of Havering) and Southend (in Essex), which have received significant inflows of older East End residents in recent decades.

Estuary English is an intermediate accent between Cockney and Received Pronunciation. It is widely spoken by people of all classes.

Multicultural London English (MLE) is a multiethnolect becoming increasingly common in multicultural areas amongst young, working-class people from diverse backgrounds. It is a fusion of an array of ethnic accents, in particular Afro-Caribbean and South Asian, with a significant Cockney influence.

Received Pronunciation (RP) is the accent traditionally regarded as the standard for British English. It has no specific geographical correlate, although it is also traditionally defined as the standard speech used in London and south-eastern England. It is mainly spoken by upper-class and upper-middle class Londoners. Standard Southern British English (SSBE) has been considered as an evolution of RP that is now common and widely spoken in London and the south-east of England by a wide variety of people, but is distinct from Estuary English and MLE.

==Economy==
London&#x27;s gross regional product in 2019 was £503 billion, around a quarter of UK GDP. London has five major business districts: the city, Westminster, Canary Wharf, Camden &amp; Islington, and Lambeth &amp; Southwark. One way to get an idea of their relative importance is to look at relative amounts of office space: Greater London had 27 million m2 of office space in 2001, and the City contains the most space, with 8 million m2 of office space. London has some of the highest real estate prices in the world.

===City of London===
London&#x27;s finance industry is based in the City of London and Canary Wharf, the two major business districts. London took over as a major financial centre shortly after 1795 when the Dutch Republic collapsed before the Napoleonic armies. This caused many bankers established in Amsterdam (e.g. Hope, Baring I&#x27;m), to move to London. Also, London&#x27;s market-centred system (as opposed to the bank-centred one in Amsterdam) grew more dominant in the 18th century. The London financial elite was strengthened by a strong Jewish community from all over Europe capable of mastering the most sophisticated financial tools of the time. This economic strength of the city was attributed to its diversity.

By the mid-19th century, London was the leading financial centre, and at the end of the century over half the world&#x27;s trade was financed in British currency. , London ranks second in the world rankings on the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI), and it ranked second in A.T. Kearney&#x27;s 2018 Global Cities Index.

London&#x27;s largest industry is finance, and its financial exports make it a large contributor to the UK&#x27;s balance of payments. Notwithstanding a post-Brexit exodus of stock listings from the London Stock Exchange, London is still one of Europe&#x27;s most economically powerful cities, and it remains one of the major financial centres of the world. It is the world&#x27;s biggest currency trading centre, accounting for some 37% of the $5.1 trillion average daily volume, according to the BIS. Over 85% (3.2 million) of the employed population of greater London works in the services industries. Because of its prominent global role, London&#x27;s economy had been affected by the financial crisis of 2007–2008. However, by 2010 the city had recovered, put in place new regulatory powers, proceeded to regain lost ground and re-established London&#x27;s economic dominance. Along with professional services headquarters, the City of London is home to the Bank of England, London Stock Exchange, and Lloyd&#x27;s of London insurance market. Founded in 1690, Barclays, whose branch in Enfield, north London installed the first cash machine (ATM) in 1967, is one of the oldest banks in continuous operation.

Over half the UK&#x27;s top 100 listed companies (the FTSE 100) and over 100 of Europe&#x27;s 500 largest companies have their headquarters in central London. Over 70% of the FTSE 100 are within London&#x27;s metropolitan area, and 75% of Fortune 500 companies have offices in London. In a 1992 report commissioned by the London Stock Exchange, Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of his family&#x27;s confectionery company Cadbury, produced the Cadbury Report, a code of best practice which served as a basis for reform of corporate governance around the world.

===Media and technology===

Media companies are concentrated in London, and the media distribution industry is London&#x27;s second most competitive sector. The BBC, the world&#x27;s oldest national broadcaster, is a significant employer, while other broadcasters, including ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, and Sky, also have headquarters around the city. Many national newspapers, including &quot;The Times&quot;, founded in 1785, are edited in London; the term Fleet Street (where most national newspapers operated) remains a metonym for the British national press. The communications company WPP is the world&#x27;s largest advertising agency.

A large number of technology companies are based in London, notably in East London Tech City, also known as Silicon Roundabout. In 2014 the city was among the first to receive a geoTLD. In February 2014 London was ranked as the European City of the Future in the 2014/15 list by &quot;fDi Intelligence&quot;. A museum in Bletchley Park, where Alan Turing was based during World War II, is in Bletchley, north of central London, as is The National Museum of Computing.

The gas and electricity distribution networks that manage and operate the towers, cables and pressure systems that deliver energy to consumers across the city are managed by National Grid plc, SGN and UK Power Networks.

===Tourism===
London is one of the leading tourist destinations in the world. It is also the top city in the world by visitor cross-border spending, estimated at US$20.23 billion in 2015. Tourism is one of London&#x27;s prime industries, employing 700,000 full-time workers in 2016, and contributes £36 billion a year to the economy. The city accounts for 54% of all inbound visitor spending in the UK.

In 2015, the top ten most-visited attractions in the UK were all in London (shown with visits per venue):
#British Museum: 6,820,686
#National Gallery: 5,908,254
#Natural History Museum (South Kensington): 5,284,023
#Southbank Centre: 5,102,883
#Tate Modern: 4,712,581
#Victoria and Albert Museum (South Kensington): 3,432,325
#Science Museum: 3,356,212
#Somerset House: 3,235,104
#Tower of London: 2,785,249
#National Portrait Gallery: 2,145,486

The number of hotel rooms in London in 2023 stood at 155,700 and is expected to grow to 183,600 rooms, the most of any city outside China. Luxury hotels in London include the Savoy (opened in 1889), Claridge&#x27;s (opened in 1812 and rebuilt in 1898), the Ritz (opened in 1906) and the Dorchester (opened in 1931), while budget hotel chains include Premier Inn and Travelodge.

==Transport==

Transport is one of the four main areas of policy administered by the Mayor of London, but the mayor&#x27;s financial control does not extend to the longer-distance rail network that enters London. In 2007, the Mayor of London assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the London Overground network, adding to the existing responsibility for the London Underground, trams and buses. The public transport network is administered by Transport for London (TfL).

The lines that formed the London Underground, as well as trams and buses, became part of an integrated transport system in 1933 when the London Passenger Transport Board or &quot;London Transport&quot; was created. Transport for London is now the statutory corporation responsible for most aspects of the transport system in Greater London, and is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the Mayor of London.

===Aviation===
London is a major international air transport hub with the busiest city airspace in the world. Eight airports use the word &quot;London&quot; in their name, but most traffic passes through six of these. Additionally, various other airports also serve London, catering primarily to general aviation flights.
*Heathrow Airport, in Hillingdon, West London, was for many years the busiest airport in the world for international traffic, and is the major hub of the nation&#x27;s flag carrier, British Airways. In March 2008 its fifth terminal was opened.
*Gatwick Airport, south of London in West Sussex, handles flights to more destinations than any other UK airport and is the main base of easyJet, the UK&#x27;s largest airline by number of passengers.
*London Stansted Airport, north-east of London in Essex, has flights that serve the greatest number of European destinations of any UK airport and is the main base of Ryanair, the world&#x27;s largest international airline by number of international passengers.
*Luton Airport, to the north of London in Bedfordshire, is used by several budget airlines (especially easyJet and Wizz Air) for short-haul flights.
*London City Airport, the most central airport and the one with the shortest runway, in Newham, East London, is focused on business travellers, with a mixture of full-service short-haul scheduled flights and considerable business jet traffic.
*London Southend Airport, east of London in Essex, is a smaller, regional airport that caters for short-haul flights on a limited, though growing, number of airlines. In 2017, international passengers made up over 95% of the total at Southend, the highest proportion of any London airport.

===Rail===
====Underground and DLR====

Opened in 1863, the London Underground, commonly referred to as the Tube or just the Underground, is the oldest and third longest metro system in the world. The system serves 272 stations, and was formed from several private companies, including the world&#x27;s first underground electric line, the City and South London Railway, which opened in 1890.

Over 4 million journeys are made every day on the Underground network, over 1 billion each year. An investment programme is attempting to reduce congestion and improve reliability, including £6.5 billion (€7.7 billion) spent before the 2012 Summer Olympics. The Docklands Light Railway (DLR), which opened in 1987, is a second, more local metro system using smaller and lighter tram-type vehicles that serve the Docklands, Greenwich and Lewisham.

====Suburban====
There are 368 railway stations in the London Travelcard Zones on an extensive above-ground suburban railway network. South London, particularly, has a high concentration of railways as it has fewer Underground lines. Most rail lines terminate around the centre of London, running into eighteen terminal stations, with the exception of the Thameslink trains connecting Bedford in the north and Brighton in the south via Luton and Gatwick airports. London has Britain&#x27;s busiest station by number of passengers—Waterloo, with over 184 million people using the interchange station complex (which includes Waterloo East station) each year. is one of Europe&#x27;s busiest rail interchanges.

With the need for more rail capacity, the Elizabeth Line (also known as Crossrail) opened in May 2022. It is a new railway line running east to west through London and into the Home Counties with a branch to Heathrow Airport. It was Europe&#x27;s biggest construction project, with a £15 billion projected cost.

====Inter-city and international====
London is the centre of the National Rail network, with 70% of rail journeys starting or ending in London. King&#x27;s Cross station and Euston station, both in London, are the starting points of the East Coast Main Line and the West Coast Main Line – the two main railway lines in Britain. Like suburban rail services, regional and inter-city trains depart from several termini around the city centre, directly linking London with most of Great Britain&#x27;s major cities and towns. &quot;The Flying Scotsman&quot; is an express passenger train service that has operated between London and Edinburgh since 1862; the world famous steam locomotive named after this service, &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot;, was the first locomotive to reach the officially authenticated speed of 100 miles per hour (161 km/h) in 1934.

Some international railway services to Continental Europe were operated during the 20th century as boat trains. The opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 connected London directly to the continental rail network, allowing Eurostar services to begin. Since 2007, high-speed trains link St. Pancras International with Lille, Calais, Paris, Disneyland Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and other European tourist destinations via the High Speed 1 rail link and the Channel Tunnel. The first high-speed domestic trains started in June 2009, linking Kent to London. There are plans for a second high speed line linking London to the Midlands, North West England, and Yorkshire.

===Buses, coaches and trams===
London&#x27;s bus network runs 24 hours a day with about 9,300 vehicles, over 675 bus routes and about 19,000 bus stops. In 2019 the network had over 2 billion commuter trips per year. Since 2010 an average of £1.2 billion is taken in revenue each year. London has one of the largest wheelchair-accessible networks in the world and from the third quarter of 2007, became more accessible to hearing and visually impaired passengers as audio-visual announcements were introduced.

An emblem of London, the red double-decker bus first appeared in the city in 1947 with the AEC Regent III RT (predecessor to the AEC Routemaster). London&#x27;s coach hub is Victoria Coach Station, opened in 1932. Nationalised in 1970 and then purchased by London Transport (now Transport for London), Victoria Coach Station has over 14 million passengers a year and provides services across the UK and continental Europe.
There is a modern tram network serving South London, known as Tramlink. It has 39 stops and four routes, and carried over 29 million people in 2017. Since June 2008, Transport for London has completely owned and operated Tramlink.

===Cable car===
London&#x27;s first and to date only cable car is the London Cable Car, which opened in June 2012. The cable car crosses the Thames and links Greenwich Peninsula with the Royal Docks in the east of the city. It is able to carry up to 2,500 passengers per hour in each direction at peak times.

===Cycling===
In the Greater London Area, around 670,000 people use a bike every day, meaning around 7% of the total population of around 8.8 million use a bike on an average day. Cycling has become an increasingly popular way to get around London. The launch of a bicycle hire scheme in July 2010 was successful and generally well received.

===Port and river boats===
The Port of London, once the largest in the world, is now only the second-largest in the United Kingdom, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year as of 2009. Most of this cargo passes through the Port of Tilbury, outside the boundary of Greater London.

London has river boat services on the Thames known as Thames Clippers, which offer both commuter and tourist boat services. At major piers including Canary Wharf, London Bridge City, Battersea Power Station and London Eye (Waterloo), services depart at least every 20 minutes during commuter times. The Woolwich Ferry, with 2.5 million passengers every year, is a frequent service linking the North and South Circular Roads.

===Roads===
Although the majority of journeys in central London are made by public transport, car travel is common in the suburbs. The inner ring road (around the city centre), the North and South Circular roads (just within the suburbs), and the outer orbital motorway (the M25, just outside the built-up area in most places) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of busy radial routes—but very few motorways penetrate into inner London. The M25 is the second-longest ring-road motorway in Europe at long. The A1 and M1 connect London to Leeds, and Newcastle and Edinburgh.
The Austin Motor Company began making hackney carriages (London taxis) in 1929, and models include Austin FX3 from 1948, Austin FX4 from 1958, with more recent models TXII and TX4 manufactured by London Taxis International. The BBC states, &quot;ubiquitous black cabs and red double-decker buses all have long and tangled stories that are deeply embedded in London&#x27;s traditions&quot;.
Although traditionally black, some are painted in other colours or bear advertising.

London is notorious for its traffic congestion; in 2009, the average speed of a car in the rush hour was recorded at . In 2003, a congestion charge was introduced to reduce traffic volumes in the city centre. With a few exceptions, motorists are required to pay to drive within a defined zone encompassing much of central London. Motorists who are residents of the defined zone can buy a greatly reduced season pass. Over the course of several years, the average number of cars entering the centre of London on a weekday was reduced from 195,000 to 125,000.

Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTN) were widely introduced in London, but in 2023 the Department for Transport stopped funding them, even though the benefits outweighed the costs by approximately 100 times in the first 20 years and the difference is growing over time.

==Education==
===Tertiary education===

London is a major global centre of higher education teaching and research and has the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe. According to the QS World University Rankings 2015/16, London has the greatest concentration of top class universities in the world and its international student population of around 110,000 is larger than any other city in the world. A 2014 PricewaterhouseCoopers report termed London the global capital of higher education.
A number of world-leading education institutions are based in London. In the 2022 &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot;, Imperial College London is ranked No. 6 in the world, University College London (UCL) is ranked 8th, and King&#x27;s College London (KCL) is ranked 37th. All are regularly ranked highly, with Imperial College being the UK&#x27;s leading university in the Research Excellence Framework ranking 2021. The London School of Economics (LSE) has been described as the world&#x27;s leading social science institution for both teaching and research. The London Business School is considered one of the world&#x27;s leading business schools and in 2015 its MBA programme was ranked second-best in the world by the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. The city is also home to three of the world&#x27;s top ten performing arts schools (as ranked by the 2020 QS World University Rankings): the Royal College of Music (ranking 2nd in the world), the Royal Academy of Music (ranking 4th) and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama (ranking 6th).

With students in London and around 48,000 in University of London Worldwide, the federal University of London is the largest contact teaching university in the UK. It includes five multi-faculty universities – City, King&#x27;s College London, Queen Mary, Royal Holloway and UCL – and a number of smaller and more specialised institutions including Birkbeck, the Courtauld Institute of Art, Goldsmiths, the London Business School, the London School of Economics, the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, the Royal Academy of Music, the Central School of Speech and Drama, the Royal Veterinary College and the School of Oriental and African Studies.

Universities in London outside the University of London system include Brunel University, Imperial College London, Kingston University, London Metropolitan University, University of East London, University of West London, University of Westminster, London South Bank University, Middlesex University, and University of the Arts London (the largest university of art, design, fashion, communication and the performing arts in Europe). In addition, there are three international universities – Regent&#x27;s University London, Richmond, The American International University in London and Schiller International University.
London is home to five major medical schools – Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry (part of Queen Mary), King&#x27;s College London School of Medicine (the largest medical school in Europe), Imperial College School of Medicine, UCL Medical School and St George&#x27;s, University of London – and has many affiliated teaching hospitals. It is also a major centre for biomedical research, and three of the UK&#x27;s eight academic health science centres are based in the city – Imperial College Healthcare, King&#x27;s Health Partners and UCL Partners (the largest such centre in Europe). Additionally, many biomedical and biotechnology spin out companies from these research institutions are based around the city, most prominently in White City. Founded by pioneering nurse Florence Nightingale at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital in 1860, the first nursing school is now part of King&#x27;s College London. It was at King&#x27;s in 1952 where a team led by Rosalind Franklin captured &quot;Photo 51&quot;, the critical evidence in identifying the structure of DNA. There are a number of business schools in London, including the London School of Business and Finance, Cass Business School (part of City University London), Hult International Business School, ESCP Europe, European Business School London, Imperial College Business School, the London Business School and the UCL School of Management.
London is also home to many specialist arts education institutions, including esteemed drama schools such as RADA (Royal Academy of Dramatic Art), the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), Drama Studio London, Sylvia Young Theatre School, the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, as well as the London College of Contemporary Arts (LCCA), Central School of Ballet, London Contemporary Dance School, National Centre for Circus Arts, Rambert School of Ballet and Contemporary Dance, the Royal College of Art, and Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance. The BRIT School in the London borough of Croydon provides training for the performing arts and technologies.

===Primary and secondary education===

The majority of primary and secondary schools and further-education colleges in London are controlled by the London boroughs or otherwise state-funded; leading examples include Ashbourne College, Bethnal Green Academy, Brampton Manor Academy, City and Islington College, City of Westminster College, David Game College, Ealing, Hammersmith and West London College, Leyton Sixth Form College, London Academy of Excellence, Tower Hamlets College, and Newham Collegiate Sixth Form Centre. There are also a number of private schools and colleges in London, some old and famous, such as City of London School, Harrow (alumni includes seven former British prime ministers), St Paul&#x27;s School, Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Boys&#x27; School, University College School, The John Lyon School, Highgate School and Westminster School.

===Royal Observatory, Greenwich and learned societies===

Founded in 1675, the Royal Observatory in Greenwich was established to address the problem of calculating longitude for navigational purposes. This pioneering work in solving longitude featured in astronomer royal Nevil Maskelyne&#x27;s &quot;Nautical Almanac&quot; which made the Greenwich meridian the universal reference point, and helped lead to the international adoption of Greenwich as the prime meridian (0° longitude) in 1884.

Important scientific learned societies based in London include the Royal Society—the UK&#x27;s national academy of sciences and the oldest national scientific institution in the world—founded in 1660, and the Royal Institution, founded in 1799. Since 1825, the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures have presented scientific subjects to a general audience, and speakers have included physicist and inventor Michael Faraday, aerospace engineer Frank Whittle, naturalist David Attenborough and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins.

==Culture==
===Leisure and entertainment===

Leisure is a major part of the London economy. A 2003 report attributed a quarter of the entire UK leisure economy to London at 25.6 events per 1000 people. The city is one of the four fashion capitals of the world, and, according to official statistics, is the world&#x27;s third-busiest film production centre, presents more live comedy than any other city, and has the biggest theatre audience of any city in the world.
Within the City of Westminster, the entertainment district of the West End has its focus around Leicester Square, where London and world film premieres are held, and Piccadilly Circus, with its giant electronic advertisements. London&#x27;s theatre district is here, as are many cinemas, bars, clubs, and restaurants, including the city&#x27;s Chinatown district (in Soho), and just to the east is Covent Garden, an area housing speciality shops. In 1881, the West End&#x27;s Savoy Theatre, which was built to showcase the plays of Gilbert and Sullivan, was fitted with the incandescent light bulb developed by Sir Joseph Swan to become the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electricity. The city is the home of Andrew Lloyd Webber, whose musicals have dominated West End theatre since the late 20th century. Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;, the world&#x27;s longest-running play, has been performed in the West End since 1952. The Laurence Olivier Awards–named after Laurence Olivier–are given annually by the Society of London Theatre. The Royal Ballet, English National Ballet, Royal Opera, and English National Opera are based in London and perform at the Royal Opera House, the London Coliseum, Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre, and the Royal Albert Hall, as well as touring the country. London was the centre of music hall, with the Hackney Empire, host to many music hall stars, among the best-surviving Edwardian era variety theatres.
Islington&#x27;s long Upper Street, extending northwards from Angel, has more bars and restaurants than any other street in the UK. Europe&#x27;s busiest shopping area is Oxford Street, a shopping street nearly long, making it the longest shopping street in the UK. It is home to vast numbers of retailers and department stores, including Selfridges flagship store. Knightsbridge, home to the equally renowned Harrods department store, lies to the south-west. One of the world&#x27;s largest retail destinations, London frequently ranks at or near the top of retail sales of any city. Opened in 1760 with its flagship store on Regent Street since 1881, Hamleys is the oldest toy store in the world. The Camden Town shoe retailer of Dr. Martens footwear was a favourite haunt of punk musicians. Madame Tussauds wax museum opened in Baker Street in 1835, an era viewed as being when London&#x27;s tourism industry began.
London is home to designers John Galliano, Stella McCartney, Manolo Blahnik, and Jimmy Choo, among others; its renowned art and fashion schools make it one of the four international centres of fashion. Mary Quant designed the miniskirt in her King&#x27;s Road boutique in Swinging Sixties London. In 2017, London was ranked the top city for luxury store openings. London Fashion Week takes place twice a year, in February and September; exhibitions have included &quot;Jack the Ripper Stalks His Victims&quot;, the first collection by Alexander McQueen. Londoners on the catwalk have included Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne.

London offers a great variety of cuisine as a result of its ethnically diverse population. Gastronomic centres include the Bangladeshi restaurants of Brick Lane and the Chinese restaurants of Chinatown. There are Chinese takeaways throughout London, as are Indian restaurants which provide Indian and Anglo-Indian cuisine. Around 1860, the first fish and chips shop in London was opened by Joseph Malin, a Jewish immigrant, in Bow. The full English breakfast dates from the Victorian era, and many cafes in London serve a full English throughout the day. London has five 3-Michelin star restaurants, including Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in Chelsea. Many hotels in London provide a traditional afternoon tea service, such as the Oscar Wilde Lounge at the Hotel Café Royal in Piccadilly, and a themed tea service is also available, for example an &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; themed afternoon tea served at the Egerton House Hotel, and &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; themed afternoon tea at One Aldwych in Covent Garden. The nation&#x27;s most popular biscuit to dunk in tea, chocolate digestives have been manufactured by McVitie&#x27;s at their Harlesden factory in north-west London since 1925.
There is a variety of annual events, beginning with the relatively new New Year&#x27;s Day Parade, a fireworks display at the London Eye; the world&#x27;s second largest street party, the Notting Hill Carnival, is held on the late August Bank Holiday each year. Traditional parades include November&#x27;s Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show, a centuries-old event celebrating the annual appointment of a new Lord Mayor of the City of London with a procession along the streets of the city, and June&#x27;s Trooping the Colour, a formal military pageant performed by regiments of the Commonwealth and British armies to celebrate the King&#x27;s Official Birthday. The Boishakhi Mela is a Bengali New Year festival celebrated by the British Bangladeshi community. It is the largest open-air Asian festival in Europe. After the Notting Hill Carnival, it is the second-largest street festival in the United Kingdom attracting over 80,000 visitors. First held in 1862, the RHS Chelsea Flower Show (run by the Royal Horticultural Society) takes place in May every year.

The first gay bar in London in the modern sense was The Cave of the Golden Calf, established as a night club in an underground location at 9 Heddon Street, just off Regent Street, in 1912 and &quot;which developed a reputation for sexual freedom and tolerance of same-sex relations&quot;. 

While London has been an LGBT tourism destination, after homosexuality was decriminalised in England in 1967 gay bar culture became more visible, and from the early 1970s Soho (and in particular Old Compton Street) became the centre of the London LGBT community. G-A-Y, previously based at the Astoria, and now Heaven, is a long-running night club.

Wider British cultural movements have influenced LGBT culture: for example, the emergence of glam rock in the UK in the early 1970s, via Marc Bolan and David Bowie, saw a generation of teenagers begin playing with the idea of androgyny, and the West End musical &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;, which debuted in London in 1973, is also widely said to have been an influence on countercultural and sexual liberation movements. The Blitz Kids (which included Boy George) frequented the Tuesday club-night at Blitz in Covent Garden, helping launch the New Romantic subcultural movement in the late 1970s. Today, the annual London Pride Parade and the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival are held in the city.

===Literature, film and television===

London has been the setting for many works of literature. The pilgrims in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s late 14th-century &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; set out for Canterbury from London. William Shakespeare spent a large part of his life living and working in London; his contemporary Ben Jonson was also based there, and some of his work, most notably his play &quot;The Alchemist&quot;, was set in the city. &quot;A Journal of the Plague Year&quot; (1722) by Daniel Defoe is a fictionalisation of the events of the 1665 Great Plague.

The literary centres of London have traditionally been hilly Hampstead and (since the early 20th century) Bloomsbury. Writers closely associated with the city are the diarist Samuel Pepys, noted for his eyewitness account of the Great Fire; Charles Dickens, whose representation of a foggy, snowy, grimy London of street sweepers and pickpockets has influenced people&#x27;s vision of early Victorian London; and Virginia Woolf, regarded as one of the foremost modernist literary figures of the 20th century. Later important depictions of London from the 19th and early 20th centuries are Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes stories. Robert Louis Stevenson mixed in London literary circles, and in 1886 he wrote the &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;, a gothic novella set in Victorian London. In 1898, H. G. Wells&#x27; sci-fi novel &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; sees London (and southern England) invaded by Martians. Letitia Elizabeth Landon wrote &quot;Calendar of the London Seasons&quot; in 1834. Modern writers influenced by the city include Peter Ackroyd, author of &quot;&quot;, and Iain Sinclair, who writes in the genre of psychogeography. In the 1940s, George Orwell wrote essays in the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot;, including &quot;A Nice Cup of Tea&quot; (method for making tea) and &quot;The Moon Under Water&quot; (an ideal pub). The WWII evacuation of children from London is depicted in C. S. Lewis&#x27; first Narnia book &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; (1950). On Christmas Eve 1925, Winnie-the-Pooh debuted in London&#x27;s &quot;Evening News&quot;, with the character based on a stuffed toy A. A. Milne bought for his son Christopher Robin in Harrods. In 1958, author Michael Bond created Paddington Bear, a refugee found in Paddington station. A screen adaptation, &quot;Paddington&quot; (2014), features the calypso song &quot;London is the Place for Me&quot;. Buckingham Palace features in Roald Dahl&#x27;s 1982 novel &quot;The BFG&quot;.


London has played a significant role in the film industry. Major studios within or bordering London include Pinewood, Elstree, Ealing, Shepperton, Twickenham, and Leavesden, with the &quot;James Bond&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series among many notable films produced here. Working Title Films has its headquarters in London. A post-production community is centred in Soho, and London houses six of the world&#x27;s largest visual effects companies, such as Framestore. The Imaginarium, a digital performance-capture studio, was founded by Andy Serkis. London has been the setting for films including &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1948), &quot;Scrooge&quot; (1951), &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1953), &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; (1961), &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1964), &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964), &quot;Blowup&quot; (1966), &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971), &quot;The Long Good Friday&quot; (1980), &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; (1986), &quot;Notting Hill&quot; (1999), &quot;Love Actually&quot; (2003), &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; (2005), &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; (2008), and &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot; (2010). Notable actors and filmmakers from London include Charlie Chaplin, Alfred Hitchcock, Michael Caine, Julie Andrews, Peter Sellers, David Lean, Julie Christie, Gary Oldman, Emma Thompson, Guy Ritchie, Christopher Nolan, Alan Rickman, Jude Law, Helena Bonham Carter, Idris Elba, Tom Hardy, Daniel Radcliffe, Keira Knightley, Riz Ahmed, Dev Patel, Daniel Kaluuya, Tom Holland, and Daniel Day-Lewis. Post-war Ealing comedies featured Alec Guinness, from the 1950s Hammer Horrors starred Christopher Lee, films directed by Michael Powell included the London-set early slasher &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; (1960), the 1970s comedy troupe Monty Python had film editing suites in Covent Garden, while since the 1990s Richard Curtis&#x27;s rom-coms have featured Hugh Grant. The largest cinema chain in the country, Odeon Cinemas was founded in London in 1928 by Oscar Deutsch. The BFI IMAX on the South Bank is the largest cinema screen in the UK. The British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs) have been held in London since 1949, with the BAFTA Fellowship the Academy&#x27;s highest accolade. Founded in 1957, the BFI London Film Festival takes place over two weeks every October.

London is a major centre for television production, with studios including Television Centre, ITV Studios, Sky Campus, and Fountain Studios; the latter hosted the original talent shows, &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, &quot;The X Factor&quot;, and &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; (the latter two created by TV personality Simon Cowell who starred as a judge in all three shows), before each format was exported around the world. Formerly a franchise of ITV, Thames Television featured comedians such as Benny Hill and Rowan Atkinson (&quot;Mr. Bean&quot; was first screened by Thames), while Talkback produced &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot; which featured Sacha Baron Cohen as Ali G. Many television shows have been set in London, including the popular television soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;.

===Museums, art galleries and libraries===
London is home to many museums, galleries, and other institutions, many of which are free of admission charges and are major tourist attractions as well as playing a research role. The first of these to be established was the British Museum in Bloomsbury, in 1753. Originally containing antiquities, natural history specimens, and the national library, the museum now has 7 million artefacts from around the globe. In 1824, the National Gallery was founded to house the British national collection of Western paintings; this now occupies a prominent position in Trafalgar Square.

The British Library is the second largest library in the world, and the national library of the United Kingdom. There are many other research libraries, including the Wellcome Library and Dana Centre, as well as university libraries, including the British Library of Political and Economic Science at LSE, the Abdus Salam Library at Imperial, the Maughan Library at King&#x27;s, and the Senate House Libraries at the University of London.

In the latter half of the 19th century the locale of South Kensington was developed as &quot;Albertopolis&quot;, a cultural and scientific quarter. Three major national museums are there: the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Natural History Museum, and the Science Museum. The National Portrait Gallery was founded in 1856 to house depictions of figures from British history; its holdings now comprise the world&#x27;s most extensive collection of portraits. The national gallery of British art is at Tate Britain, originally established as an annexe of the National Gallery in 1897. The Tate Gallery, as it was formerly known, also became a major centre for modern art. In 2000, this collection moved to Tate Modern, a new gallery housed in the former Bankside Power Station which is accessed by pedestrians north of the Thames via the Millennium Bridge.

===Music===

London is one of the major classical and popular music capitals of the world and hosts major music corporations, such as Universal Music Group International and Warner Music Group, and countless bands, musicians and industry professionals. The city is also home to many orchestras and concert halls, such as the Barbican Arts Centre (principal base of the London Symphony Orchestra and the London Symphony Chorus), the Southbank Centre (London Philharmonic Orchestra and the Philharmonia Orchestra), Cadogan Hall (Royal Philharmonic Orchestra), and the Royal Albert Hall (The Proms). The Proms, an eight-week summer season of daily orchestral classical music first held in 1895, ends with the Last Night of the Proms. London&#x27;s two main opera houses are the Royal Opera House and the London Coliseum (home to the English National Opera). The UK&#x27;s largest pipe organ is at the Royal Albert Hall. Other significant instruments are in cathedrals and major churches—the church bells of St Clement Danes feature in the 1744 nursery rhyme &quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot;. Several conservatoires are within the city: Royal Academy of Music, Royal College of Music, Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and Trinity Laban. The record label EMI was formed in the city in 1931, and an early employee for the company, Alan Blumlein, created stereo sound that year. Guitar amp engineer Jim Marshall founded Marshall Amplification in London in 1962.
London has numerous venues for rock and pop concerts, including the world&#x27;s busiest indoor venue, the O2 Arena, and Wembley Arena, as well as many mid-sized venues, such as Brixton Academy, the Hammersmith Apollo and the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire. Several music festivals, including the Wireless Festival, Lovebox, and Hyde Park&#x27;s British Summer Time, are held in London. 

The city is home to the original Hard Rock Cafe and the Abbey Road Studios, where the Beatles recorded many of their hits. In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, musicians and groups like Elton John, Pink Floyd, David Bowie, the Rolling Stones, Queen, Eric Clapton, the Who, the Kinks, Cliff Richard, Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, Deep Purple, T. Rex, the Police, Elvis Costello, Dire Straits, Cat Stevens, Fleetwood Mac, the Cure, Madness, Culture Club, Dusty Springfield, Phil Collins, Rod Stewart, Status Quo, and Sade, derived their sound from the streets and rhythms of London.

London was instrumental in the development of punk music, with groups such as the Sex Pistols, the Clash, and fashion designer Vivienne Westwood all based in the city. Other artists to emerge from the London music scene include George Michael, Kate Bush, Seal, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Bush, the Spice Girls, Jamiroquai, Blur, the Prodigy, Gorillaz, Mumford &amp; Sons, Coldplay, Dido, Amy Winehouse, Adele, Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran, Leona Lewis, Ellie Goulding, Dua Lipa, and Florence and the Machine. Artists from London played a prominent role in the development of synth-pop, including Gary Numan, Depeche Mode, the Pet Shop Boys, and Eurythmics; the latter&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot; was recorded in the attic of their north London home, heralding a trend for home recording methods. Artists from London with a Caribbean influence include Hot Chocolate, Billy Ocean, Soul II Soul, and Eddy Grant, with the latter fusing reggae, soul and samba with rock and pop. London is also a centre for urban music. In particular the genres UK garage, drum and bass, dubstep, and grime evolved in the city from the foreign genres of house, hip hop, and reggae, alongside local drum and bass. Urban acts from London include Stormzy, M.I.A., Jay Sean, and Rita Ora. Music station BBC Radio 1Xtra was set up to support the rise of local urban contemporary music both in London and in the rest of the United Kingdom. The British Phonographic Industry&#x27;s annual popular music awards, the Brit Awards, are held in London.

==Recreation==
===Parks and open spaces===


A 2013 report by the City of London Corporation said that London is the &quot;greenest city&quot; in Europe with 35,000 acres (14,164 hectares) of public parks, woodlands and gardens. The largest parks in the central area of London are three of the eight Royal Parks, namely Hyde Park and its neighbour Kensington Gardens in the west, and Regent&#x27;s Park to the north. Hyde Park in particular is popular for sports and sometimes hosts open-air concerts. Regent&#x27;s Park contains London Zoo, the world&#x27;s oldest scientific zoo, and is near Madame Tussauds wax museum. Primrose Hill is a popular spot from which to view the city skyline.

Close to Hyde Park are smaller Royal Parks, Green Park and St. James&#x27;s Park. A number of large parks lie outside the city centre, including Hampstead Heath and the remaining Royal Parks of Greenwich Park to the southeast, and Bushy Park and Richmond Park (the largest) to the southwest. Hampton Court Park is also a royal park, but, because it contains a palace, it is administered by the Historic Royal Palaces, unlike the eight Royal Parks. Crystal Palace Park in south-east London was laid out as a pleasure ground, and, reflecting the public enthusiasm for dinosaurs that first developed in Victorian England, it contains the first-ever life-sized models of dinosaurs.

Close to Richmond Park is Kew Gardens, which has the world&#x27;s largest collection of living plants. In 2003, the gardens were put on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. There are also parks administered by London&#x27;s borough Councils, including Victoria Park in the East End and Battersea Park in the centre. Some more informal, semi-natural open spaces also exist, including Hampstead Heath and Epping Forest, both controlled by the City of London Corporation. Hampstead Heath incorporates Kenwood House, a former stately home and a popular location in the summer months when classical musical concerts are held by the lake. Epping Forest is a popular venue for various outdoor activities, including mountain biking, walking, horse riding, golf, angling, and orienteering. Three of the UK&#x27;s most-visited theme parks, Thorpe Park near Staines-upon-Thames, Chessington World of Adventures in Chessington and Legoland Windsor, are located within of London.

===Walking===

Walking is a popular recreational activity in London. Areas that provide for walks include Wimbledon Common, Epping Forest, Hampton Court Park, Hampstead Heath, the eight Royal Parks, Regents Canal Walk, canals, and disused railway tracks. Access to canals and rivers has improved recently, including the creation of the Thames Path, some of which is within Greater London, and The Wandle Trail along the River Wandle.

Other long-distance paths, linking green spaces, have also been created, including the Capital Ring, the Green Chain Walk, London Outer Orbital Path (&quot;Loop&quot;), Jubilee Walkway, Lea Valley Walk, and the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Walk.

==Sport==

London has hosted the Summer Olympics three times: in 1908, 1948, and 2012, making it the first city to host the modern Games three times. The city was also the host of the British Empire Games in 1934. In 2017, London hosted the World Championships in Athletics for the first time.

London&#x27;s most popular sport is football, and it has seven clubs in the Premier League in the 2024–25 season: Arsenal, Brentford, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Tottenham Hotspur, and West Ham United. Other professional men&#x27;s teams in London are AFC Wimbledon, Barnet, Bromley, Charlton Athletic, Dagenham &amp; Redbridge, Leyton Orient, Millwall, Queens Park Rangers, and Sutton United. Four London-based teams are in the Women&#x27;s Super League: Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham, and West Ham United.

Two Premiership Rugby union teams are based in Greater London: Harlequins and Saracens. Ealing Trailfinders and London Scottish play in the RFU Championship; other rugby union clubs in the city include Richmond, Rosslyn Park, Westcombe Park, and Blackheath. Twickenham Stadium in south-west London hosts home matches for the England national rugby union team. While rugby league is more popular in the north of England, the sport has one professional club in London – the London Broncos, while the Challenge Cup final often takes place in the city.

One of London&#x27;s best-known annual sports competitions is the Wimbledon Tennis Championships, held at the All England Club in the south-western suburb of Wimbledon since 1877. Played in late June to early July, it is the oldest tennis tournament in the world and widely considered the most prestigious. Founded in London in 1881, Slazenger has provided tennis balls for Wimbledon since 1902, the oldest sponsorship in sport.

London has two Test cricket grounds which host the England cricket team, Lord&#x27;s (home of Middlesex C.C.C.) and the Oval (home of Surrey C.C.C.). Lord&#x27;s has hosted four finals of the Cricket World Cup and is known as the &quot;Home of Cricket&quot;. In golf, the Wentworth Club is located in Virginia Water, Surrey on the south-west fringes of London, while the closest venue to London that is used as one of the courses for the Open Championship, the oldest major and tournament in golf, is Royal St George&#x27;s in Sandwich, Kent. The rules of modern boxing, the Queensberry Rules, were formulated in London in 1867, and since then fights have taken place at York Hall (the spiritual home of British boxing), and larger arenas and stadiums across the city. Alexandra Palace in north London hosts the PDC World Darts Championship and the Masters snooker tournament. Other key annual events are the mass-participation London Marathon and the University Boat Race on the Thames contested between Oxford and Cambridge.
