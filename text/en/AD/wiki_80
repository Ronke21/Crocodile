<text>Leukemia (also spelled leukaemia; pronounced ) is a group of blood cancers that usually begin in the bone marrow and produce high numbers of abnormal blood cells. These blood cells are not fully developed and are called &quot;blasts&quot; or &quot;leukemia cells&quot;. Symptoms may include bleeding and bruising, bone pain, fatigue, fever, and an increased risk of infections. These symptoms occur due to a lack of normal blood cells. Diagnosis is typically made by blood tests or bone marrow biopsy.

The exact cause of leukemia is unknown. A combination of genetic factors and environmental (non-inherited) factors are believed to play a role. Risk factors include smoking, ionizing radiation, petrochemicals (such as benzene), prior chemotherapy, and Down syndrome. People with a family history of leukemia are also at higher risk. There are four main types of leukemia—acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)—and a number of less common types. Leukemias and lymphomas both belong to a broader group of tumors that affect the blood, bone marrow, and lymphoid system, known as tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues.

Treatment may involve some combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and bone marrow transplant, with supportive and palliative care provided as needed. Certain types of leukemia may be managed with watchful waiting. The success of treatment depends on the type of leukemia and the age of the person. Outcomes have improved in the developed world. Five-year survival rate was 67% in the United States in the period from 2014 to 2020. In children under 15 in first-world countries, the five-year survival rate is greater than 60% or even 90%, depending on the type of leukemia. For infants (those diagnosed under the age of 1), the survival rate is around 40%. In children who are cancer-free five years after diagnosis of acute leukemia, the cancer is unlikely to return.

In 2015, leukemia was present in 2.3 million people worldwide and caused 353,500 deaths. In 2012, it had newly developed in 352,000 people. It is the most common type of cancer in children, with three-quarters of leukemia cases in children being the acute lymphoblastic type. However, over 90% of all leukemias are diagnosed in adults, CLL and AML being most common. It occurs more commonly in the developed world.
==Classification==


===General classification===
Clinically and pathologically, leukemia is subdivided into a variety of large groups. The first division is between its &quot;acute&quot; and &quot;chronic&quot; forms:
* Acute leukemia is characterized by a rapid increase in the number of immature blood cells. The crowding that results from such cells makes the bone marrow unable to produce healthy blood cells resulting in low hemoglobin and low platelets. Immediate treatment is required in acute leukemia because of the rapid progression and accumulation of the malignant cells, which then spill over into the bloodstream and spread to other organs of the body. Acute forms of leukemia are the most common forms of leukemia in children.
* Chronic leukemia is characterized by the excessive buildup of relatively mature, but still abnormal, white blood cells (or, more rarely, red blood cells). Typically taking months or years to progress, the cells are produced at a much higher rate than normal, resulting in many abnormal white blood cells. Whereas acute leukemia must be treated immediately, chronic forms are sometimes monitored for some time before treatment to ensure maximum effectiveness of therapy. Chronic leukemia mostly occurs in older people but can occur in any age group.

Additionally, the diseases are subdivided according to which kind of blood cell is affected. This divides leukemias into lymphoblastic or &quot;lymphocytic leukemias&quot; and myeloid or &quot;myelogenous leukemias&quot;:
* In lymphoblastic or lymphocytic leukemias, the cancerous change takes place in a type of marrow cell that normally goes on to form lymphocytes, which are infection-fighting immune system cells. Most lymphocytic leukemias involve a specific subtype of lymphocyte, the B cell.
* In myeloid or myelogenous leukemias, the cancerous change takes place in a type of marrow cell that normally goes on to form red blood cells, some other types of white cells, and platelets.

Combining these two classifications provides a total of four main categories. Within each of these main categories, there are typically several subcategories. Finally, some rarer types are usually considered to be outside of this classification scheme.

===Specific types===
* Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of leukemia in young children. It also affects adults, especially those 65 and older. Standard treatments involve chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Subtypes include precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia, precursor T acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Burkitt&#x27;s leukemia, and acute biphenotypic leukemia. While most cases of ALL occur in children, 80% of deaths from ALL occur in adults.
* Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) most often affects adults over the age of 55. It sometimes occurs in younger adults, but it almost never affects children. Two-thirds of affected people are men. The five-year survival rate is 85%. It is incurable, but there are many effective treatments. One subtype is B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, a more aggressive disease.
* Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) occurs far more commonly in adults than in children, and more commonly in men than women. It is treated with chemotherapy. The five-year survival rate is 20%. Subtypes of AML include acute promyelocytic leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.
* Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) occurs mainly in adults; a very small number of children also develop this disease. It is treated with imatinib (Gleevec in United States, Glivec in Europe) or other drugs. The five-year survival rate is 90%. One subtype is chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.
* Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is sometimes considered a subset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but does not fit neatly into this category. About 80% of affected people are adult men. No cases in children have been reported. HCL is incurable but easily treatable. Survival is 96% to 100% at ten years.
* T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a very rare and aggressive leukemia affecting adults; somewhat more men than women are diagnosed with this disease. Despite its overall rarity, it is the most common type of mature T cell leukemia; nearly all other leukemias involve B cells. It is difficult to treat, and the median survival is measured in months.
* Large granular lymphocytic leukemia may involve either T-cells or NK cells; like hairy cell leukemia, which involves solely B cells, it is a rare and indolent (not aggressive) leukemia.
* Adult T-cell leukemia is caused by human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), a virus similar to HIV. Like HIV, HTLV infects CD4+ T-cells and replicates within them; however, unlike HIV, it does not destroy them. Instead, HTLV &quot;immortalizes&quot; the infected T-cells, giving them the ability to proliferate abnormally. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus types I and II (HTLV-I/II) are endemic in certain areas of the world.
* Clonal eosinophilias (also called &quot;clonal hypereosinophilias&quot;) are a group of blood disorders characterized by the growth of eosinophils in the bone marrow, blood, and/or other tissues. They may be pre-cancerous or cancerous. Clonal eosinophilias involve a &quot;clone&quot; of eosinophils, i.e., a group of genetically identical eosinophils that all grew from the same mutated ancestor cell. These disorders may evolve into chronic eosinophilic leukemia or may be associated with various forms of myeloid neoplasms, lymphoid neoplasms, myelofibrosis, or the myelodysplastic syndrome.

===Pre-leukemia===
* Transient myeloproliferative disease, also termed transient leukemia, involves the abnormal proliferation of a clone of non-cancerous megakaryoblasts. The disease is restricted to individuals with Down syndrome or genetic changes similar to those in Down syndrome, develops in a baby during pregnancy or shortly after birth, and resolves within 3 months or, in ~10% of cases, progresses to acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Transient myeloid leukemia is a pre-leukemic condition.
* Clonal hematopoiesis is a common age-related phenomenon with a low risk of progression to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and leukemia. Once MDS has developed, the risk of progression to acute leukemia can be assessed using the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS).
* Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis has a low risk of progression to B-cell leukemia.

==Signs and symptoms==
The most common symptoms in children are easy bruising, pale skin, fever, and an enlarged spleen or liver.

Damage to the bone marrow, by way of displacing the normal bone marrow cells with higher numbers of immature white blood cells, results in a lack of blood platelets, which are important in the blood clotting process. This means people with leukemia may easily become bruised, bleed excessively, or develop pinprick bleeds (petechiae).

White blood cells, which are involved in fighting pathogens, may be suppressed or dysfunctional. This could cause the person&#x27;s immune system to be unable to fight off a simple infection or to start attacking other body cells. Because leukemia prevents the immune system from working normally, some people experience frequent infection, ranging from infected tonsils, sores in the mouth, or diarrhea to life-threatening pneumonia or opportunistic infections.

Finally, the red blood cell deficiency leads to anemia, which may cause dyspnea and pallor.

Some people experience other symptoms, such as fevers, chills, night sweats, weakness in the limbs, feeling fatigued and other common flu-like symptoms. Some people experience nausea or a feeling of fullness due to an enlarged liver and spleen; this can result in unintentional weight loss. Blasts affected by the disease may come together and become swollen in the liver or in the lymph nodes causing pain and leading to nausea.

If the leukemic cells invade the central nervous system, then neurological symptoms (notably headaches) can occur. Uncommon neurological symptoms like migraines, seizures, or coma can occur as a result of brain stem pressure. All symptoms associated with leukemia can be attributed to other diseases. Consequently, leukemia is always diagnosed through medical tests.

The word &quot;leukemia&quot;, which means &#x27;white blood&#x27;, is derived from the characteristic high white blood cell count that presents in most affected people before treatment. The high number of white blood cells is apparent when a blood sample is viewed under a microscope, with the extra white blood cells frequently being immature or dysfunctional. The excessive number of cells can also interfere with the level of other cells, causing further harmful imbalance in the blood count.

Some people diagnosed with leukemia do not have high white blood cell counts visible during a regular blood count. This less-common condition is called &quot;aleukemia&quot;. The bone marrow still contains cancerous white blood cells that disrupt the normal production of blood cells, but they remain in the marrow instead of entering the bloodstream, where they would be visible in a blood test. For a person with aleukemia, the white blood cell counts in the bloodstream can be normal or low. Aleukemia can occur in any of the four major types of leukemia, and is particularly common in hairy cell leukemia.

==Causes==

Studies in 2009 and 2010 have shown a positive correlation between exposure to formaldehyde and the development of leukemia, particularly myeloid leukemia. The different leukemias likely have different causes.

Leukemia, like other cancers, results from mutations in the DNA. Certain mutations can trigger leukemia by activating oncogenes or deactivating tumor suppressor genes, and thereby disrupting the regulation of cell death, differentiation or division. These mutations may occur spontaneously or as a result of exposure to radiation or carcinogenic substances.

Among adults, the known causes are natural and artificial ionizing radiation and petrochemicals, notably benzene and alkylating chemotherapy agents for previous malignancies. Use of tobacco is associated with a small increase in the risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia in adults. Cohort and case-control studies have linked exposure to some petrochemicals and hair dyes to the development of some forms of leukemia. Diet has very limited or no effect, although eating more vegetables may confer a small protective benefit.

Viruses have also been linked to some forms of leukemia. For example, human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1) causes adult T-cell leukemia.

A few cases of maternal-fetal transmission (a baby acquires leukemia because its mother had leukemia during the pregnancy) have been reported. Children born to mothers who use fertility drugs to induce ovulation are more than twice as likely to develop leukemia during their childhoods than other children.

In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of any type of leukemia in neonates using phototherapy, typically to treat neonatal jaundice, a statistically significant association was detected between using phototherapy and myeloid leukemia. However, it is still questionable whether phototherapy is genuinely the cause of cancer or simply a result of the same underlying factors that gave rise to cancer. 

===Radiation===
Large doses of Sr-90 (called a bone seeking radioisotope) from nuclear reactor accidents, increases the risk of bone cancer and leukemia in animals and is presumed to do so in people.

===Genetic conditions===
Some people have a genetic predisposition towards developing leukemia. This predisposition is demonstrated by family histories and twin studies. The affected people may have a single gene or multiple genes in common. In some cases, families tend to develop the same kinds of leukemia as other members; in other families, affected people may develop different forms of leukemia or related blood cancers.

In addition to these genetic issues, people with chromosomal abnormalities or certain other genetic conditions have a greater risk of leukemia. For example, people with Down syndrome have a significantly increased risk of developing forms of acute leukemia (especially acute myeloid leukemia), and Fanconi anemia is a risk factor for developing acute myeloid leukemia. Mutation in SPRED1 gene has been associated with a predisposition to childhood leukemia.

Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes represent a kind of premature aging of the bone marrow. In people with these syndromes and in older adults, mutations associated with clonal hematopoiesis may arise as an adaptive response to a progressively deteriorating hematopoietic niche, i.e., a depleting pool of Hematopoietic stem cells. The mutated stem cells then acquire a self-renewal advantage.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia is associated with a genetic abnormality called the Philadelphia translocation; 95% of people with CML carry the Philadelphia mutation, although this is not exclusive to CML and can be observed in people with other types of leukemia.

===Non-ionizing radiation===
Whether or not non-ionizing radiation causes leukemia has been studied for several decades. The International Agency for Research on Cancer expert working group undertook a detailed review of all data on static and extremely low frequency electromagnetic energy, which occurs naturally and in association with the generation, transmission, and use of electrical power. They concluded that there is limited evidence that high levels of ELF magnetic (but not electric) fields might cause some cases of childhood leukemia. No evidence for a relationship to leukemia or another form of malignancy in adults has been demonstrated. Since exposure to such levels of ELFs is relatively uncommon, the World Health Organization concludes that ELF exposure, if later proven to be causative, would account for just 100 to 2400 cases worldwide each year, representing 0.2 to 4.9% of the total incidence of childhood leukemia for that year (about 0.03 to 0.9% of all leukemias).

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis is usually based on repeated complete blood counts and a bone marrow examination following observations of the symptoms. Sometimes, blood tests may not show that a person has leukemia, especially in the early stages of the disease or during remission. A lymph node biopsy can be performed to diagnose certain types of leukemia in certain situations.

Following diagnosis, blood chemistry tests can be used to determine the degree of liver and kidney damage or the effects of chemotherapy on the person. When concerns arise about other damages due to leukemia, doctors may use an X-ray, MRI, or ultrasound. These can potentially show leukemia&#x27;s effects on such body parts as bones (X-ray), the brain (MRI), or the kidneys, spleen, and liver (ultrasound). CT scans can be used to check lymph nodes in the chest, though this is uncommon.

Despite the use of these methods to diagnose whether or not a person has leukemia, many people have not been diagnosed because many of the symptoms are vague, non-specific, and can refer to other diseases. For this reason, the American Cancer Society estimates that at least one-fifth of the people with leukemia have not yet been diagnosed.

==Treatment==
Most forms of leukemia are treated with pharmaceutical medication, typically combined into a multi-drug chemotherapy regimen. Some are also treated with radiation therapy. In some cases, a bone marrow transplant is effective.

===Acute lymphoblastic===

Management of ALL is directed towards control of bone marrow and systemic (whole-body) disease. Additionally, treatment must prevent leukemic cells from spreading to other sites, particularly the central nervous system (CNS); periodic lumbar punctures are used for diagnostic purposes and to administer intrathecal prophylactic methotrexate. In general, ALL treatment is divided into several phases:
* &quot;Induction chemotherapy&quot; to bring about bone marrow remission. For adults, standard induction plans include prednisone, vincristine, and an anthracycline drug; other drug plans may include L-asparaginase or cyclophosphamide. For children with low-risk ALL, standard therapy usually consists of three drugs (prednisone, L-asparaginase, and vincristine) for the first month of treatment.
* &quot;Consolidation therapy&quot; or &quot;intensification therapy&quot; to eliminate any remaining leukemia cells. There are many different approaches to consolidation, but it is typically a high-dose, multi-drug treatment that is undertaken for a few months. People with low- to average-risk ALL receive therapy with antimetabolite drugs such as methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). People who are high-risk receive higher drug doses of these drugs, plus additional drugs.
* &quot;CNS prophylaxis&quot; (preventive therapy) to stop cancer from spreading to the brain and nervous system in high-risk people. Standard prophylaxis may include radiation of the head and/or drugs delivered directly into the spine.
* &quot;Maintenance treatments&quot; with chemotherapeutic drugs to prevent disease recurrence once remission has been achieved. Maintenance therapy usually involves lower drug doses and may continue for up to three years.
* Alternatively, &quot;allogeneic bone marrow transplantation&quot; may be appropriate for high-risk or relapsed people.

===Chronic lymphocytic===
====Decision to treat====
Hematologists base CLL treatment on both the stage and symptoms of the individual person. A large group of people with CLL have low-grade disease, which does not benefit from treatment. Individuals with CLL-related complications or more advanced disease often benefit from treatment. In general, the indications for treatment are:
* Falling hemoglobin or platelet count
* Progression to a later stage of disease
* Painful, disease-related overgrowth of lymph nodes or spleen
* An increase in the rate of lymphocyte production

====Treatment approach====
Most CLL cases are incurable by present treatments, so treatment is directed towards suppressing the disease for many years, rather than curing it. The primary chemotherapeutic plan is combination chemotherapy with chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide, plus a corticosteroid such as prednisone or prednisolone. The use of a corticosteroid has the additional benefit of suppressing some related autoimmune diseases, such as immunohemolytic anemia or immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. In resistant cases, single-agent treatments with nucleoside drugs such as fludarabine, pentostatin, or cladribine may be successful. Younger and healthier people may choose allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation in the hope of a permanent cure.

===Acute myelogenous===
Many different anti-cancer drugs are effective for the treatment of AML. Treatments vary somewhat according to the age of the person and according to the specific subtype of AML. Overall, the strategy is to control bone marrow and systemic (whole-body) disease, while offering specific treatment for the central nervous system (CNS), if involved.

In general, most oncologists rely on combinations of drugs for the initial, &quot;induction phase&quot; of chemotherapy. Such combination chemotherapy usually offers the benefits of early remission and a lower risk of disease resistance. &quot;Consolidation&quot; and &quot;maintenance&quot; treatments are intended to prevent disease recurrence. Consolidation treatment often entails a repetition of induction chemotherapy or the intensification of chemotherapy with additional drugs. By contrast, maintenance treatment involves drug doses that are lower than those administered during the induction phase.

===Chronic myelogenous===
There are many possible treatments for CML, but the standard of care for newly diagnosed people is imatinib (Gleevec) therapy. Compared to most anti-cancer drugs, it has relatively few side effects and can be taken orally at home. With this drug, more than 90% of people will be able to keep the disease in check for at least five years, so that CML becomes a chronic, manageable condition.

In a more advanced, uncontrolled state, when the person cannot tolerate imatinib, or if the person wishes to attempt a permanent cure, then an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may be performed. This procedure involves high-dose chemotherapy and radiation followed by infusion of bone marrow from a compatible donor. Approximately 30% of people die from this procedure.

===Hairy cell===
Decision to treat
People with hairy cell leukemia who are symptom-free typically do not receive immediate treatment. Treatment is generally considered necessary when the person shows signs and symptoms such as low blood cell counts (e.g., infection-fighting neutrophil count below 1.0 K/μL), frequent infections, unexplained bruises, anemia, or fatigue that is significant enough to disrupt the person&#x27;s everyday life.

Typical treatment approach
People who need treatment usually receive either one week of cladribine, given daily by intravenous infusion or a simple injection under the skin, or six months of pentostatin, given every four weeks by intravenous infusion. In most cases, one round of treatment will produce a prolonged remission.

Other treatments include rituximab infusion or self-injection with Interferon-alpha. In limited cases, the person may benefit from &quot;splenectomy&quot; (removal of the spleen). These treatments are not typically given as the first treatment because their success rates are lower than cladribine or pentostatin.

===T-cell prolymphocytic===
Most people with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, a rare and aggressive leukemia with a median survival of less than one year, require immediate treatment.

T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia is difficult to treat, and it does not respond to most available chemotherapeutic drugs. Many different treatments have been attempted, with limited success in certain people: purine analogues (pentostatin, fludarabine, cladribine), chlorambucil, and various forms of combination chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone CHOP, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone [COP], vincristine, doxorubicin, prednisone, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, bleomycin VAPEC-B). Alemtuzumab (Campath), a monoclonal antibody that attacks white blood cells, has been used in treatment with greater success than previous options.

Some people who successfully respond to treatment also undergo stem cell transplantation to consolidate the response.

===Juvenile myelomonocytic===
Treatment for juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia can include splenectomy, chemotherapy, and bone marrow transplantation.

==Prognosis==
The success of treatment depends on the type of leukemia and the age of the person. Outcomes have improved in the developed world. The average five-year survival rate is 65% in the United States. In children under 15, the five-year survival rate is greater (60 to 85%), depending on the type of leukemia. In children with acute leukemia who are cancer-free after five years, the cancer is unlikely to return.

Outcomes depend on whether it is acute or chronic, the specific abnormal white blood cell type, the presence and severity of anemia or thrombocytopenia, the degree of tissue abnormality, the presence of metastasis and lymph node and bone marrow infiltration, the availability of therapies and the skills of the health care team. Treatment outcomes may be better when people are treated at larger centers with greater experience.

==Epidemiology==

In 2010, globally, approximately 281,500 people died of leukemia. In 2000, approximately 256,000 children and adults around the world developed a form of leukemia, and 209,000 died from it. This represents about 3% of the almost seven million deaths due to cancer that year, and about 0.35% of all deaths from any cause. Of the sixteen separate sites the body compared, leukemia was the 12th most common class of neoplastic disease and the 11th most common cause of cancer-related death. Leukemia occurs more commonly in the developed world.

===United States===
About 245,000 people in the United States are affected with some form of leukemia, including those that have achieved remission or cure. Rates from 1975 to 2011 have increased by 0.7% per year among children. Approximately 44,270 new cases of leukemia were diagnosed in the year 2008 in the US. This represents 2.9% of all cancers (excluding simple basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers) in the United States, and 30.4% of all blood cancers.

Among children with some form of cancer, about a third have a type of leukemia, most commonly acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A type of leukemia is the second most common form of cancer in infants (under the age of 12 months) and the most common form of cancer in older children. Boys are somewhat more likely to develop leukemia than girls, and white American children are almost twice as likely to develop leukemia than black American children. Only about 3% cancer diagnoses among adults are for leukemias, but because cancer is much more common among adults, more than 90% of all leukemias are diagnosed in adults.

Race is a risk factor in the United States. Hispanics, especially those under the age of 20, are at the highest risk for leukemia, while whites, Native Americans, Asian Americans, and Alaska Natives are at higher risk than African Americans.

More men than women are diagnosed with leukemia and die from the disease. Around 30 percent more men than women have leukemia.

===Australia===
In Australia, leukemia is the eleventh most common cancer. In 2014–2018, Australians diagnosed with leukemia had a 64% chance (65% for males and 64% for females) of surviving for five years compared to the rest of the Australian population–there was a 21% increase in survival rates between 1989–1993.

===UK===
Overall, leukemia is the eleventh most common cancer in the UK (around 8,600 people were diagnosed with the disease in 2011), and it is the ninth most common cause of cancer death (around 4,800 people died in 2012).

==History==

Leukemia was first described by anatomist and surgeon Alfred-Armand-Louis-Marie Velpeau in 1827. A more complete description was given by pathologist Rudolf Virchow in 1845. Around ten years after Virchow&#x27;s findings, pathologist Franz Ernst Christian Neumann found that the bone marrow of a deceased person with leukemia was colored &quot;dirty green-yellow&quot; as opposed to the normal red. This finding allowed Neumann to conclude that a bone marrow problem was responsible for the abnormal blood of people with leukemia.

By 1900, leukemia was viewed as a family of diseases as opposed to a single disease. By 1947, Boston pathologist Sidney Farber believed from past experiments that aminopterin, a folic acid mimic, could potentially cure leukemia in children. The majority of the children with ALL who were tested showed signs of improvement in their bone marrow, but none of them were actually cured. Nevertheless, this result did lead to further experiments.

In 1962, researchers Emil J. Freireich, Jr. and Emil Frei III used combination chemotherapy to attempt to cure leukemia. The tests were successful with some people surviving long after the tests.

===Etymology===
Observing an abnormally large number of white blood cells in a blood sample from a person, Virchow called the condition &quot;Leukämie&quot; in German, which he formed from the two Greek words &quot;leukos&quot; (), meaning &#x27;white&#x27;, and &quot;haima&quot; (), meaning &#x27;blood&#x27;. It was formerly also called &quot;leucemia&quot;.

==Society and culture==
According to Susan Sontag, leukemia was often romanticized in 20th-century fiction, portrayed as a joy-ending, clean disease whose fair, innocent and gentle victims die young or at the wrong time. As such, it was the cultural successor to tuberculosis, which held this cultural position until it was discovered to be an infectious disease. The 1970 romance novel &quot;Love Story&quot; is an example of this romanticization of leukemia.

In the United States, around $5.4 billion is spent on treatment a year.

==Research directions==
Significant research into the causes, prevalence, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of leukemia is being performed. Hundreds of clinical trials are being planned or conducted at any given time. Studies may focus on effective means of treatment, better ways of treating the disease, improving the quality of life for people, or appropriate care in remission or after cures.

In general, there are two types of leukemia research: clinical or translational research and basic research. Clinical/translational research focuses on studying the disease in a defined and generally immediately applicable way, such as testing a new drug in people. By contrast, basic science research studies the disease process at a distance, such as seeing whether a suspected carcinogen can cause leukemic changes in isolated cells in the laboratory or how the DNA changes inside leukemia cells as the disease progresses. The results from basic research studies are generally less immediately useful to people with the disease.

Treatment through gene therapy is currently being pursued. One such approach used genetically modified T cells, known as chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells), to attack cancer cells. In 2011, a year after treatment, two of the three people with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia were reported to be cancer-free and in 2013, three of five subjects who had acute lymphocytic leukemia were reported to be in remission for five months to two years. Subsequent studies with a variety of CAR-T types continue to be promising. As of 2018, two CAR-T therapies have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. CAR-T treatment has significant side effects, and loss of the antigen targeted by the CAR-T cells is a common mechanism for relapse. The stem cells that cause different types of leukemia are also being researched.

==Pregnancy==
Leukemia is rarely associated with pregnancy, affecting only about 1 in 10,000 pregnant women. How it is handled depends primarily on the type of leukemia. Nearly all leukemias appearing in pregnant women are acute leukemias. Acute leukemias normally require prompt, aggressive treatment, despite significant risks of pregnancy loss and birth defects, especially if chemotherapy is given during the developmentally sensitive first trimester. Chronic myelogenous leukemia can be treated with relative safety at any time during pregnancy with Interferon-alpha hormones. Treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemias, which are rare in pregnant women, can often be postponed until after the end of the pregnancy.

<doc id="18542" wikidata="Q36253" url="?curid=18542" title="Length">
<text>Length is a measure of distance. In the International System of Quantities, length is a quantity with dimension distance. In most systems of measurement a base unit for length is chosen, from which all other units are derived. In the International System of Units (SI) system the base unit for length is the metre.
Length is commonly understood to mean the most extended dimension of a fixed object. However, this is not always the case and may depend on the position the object is in.

Various terms for the length of a fixed object are used, and these include height, which is vertical length or vertical extent, width, breadth, and depth. &quot;Height&quot; is used when there is a base from which vertical measurements can be taken. &quot;Width&quot; and &quot;breadth&quot; usually refer to a shorter dimension than &quot;length&quot;. &quot;Depth&quot; is used for the measure of a third dimension.

Length is the measure of one spatial dimension, whereas area is a measure of two dimensions (length squared) and volume is a measure of three dimensions (length cubed).

== History ==
Measurement has been important ever since humans settled from nomadic lifestyles and started using building materials, occupying land and trading with neighbours. As trade between different places increased, the need for standard units of length increased. And later, as society has become more technologically oriented, much higher accuracy of measurement is required in an increasingly diverse set of fields, from micro-electronics to interplanetary ranging.

Under Einstein&#x27;s special relativity, length can no longer be thought of as being constant in all reference frames. Thus a ruler that is one metre long in one frame of reference will not be one metre long in a reference frame that is moving relative to the first frame. This means the length of an object varies depending on the speed of the observer.

== Use in mathematics ==
=== Euclidean geometry ===

In Euclidean geometry, length is measured along straight lines unless otherwise specified and refers to segments on them. Pythagoras&#x27;s theorem relating the length of the sides of a right triangle is one of many applications in Euclidean geometry. Length may also be measured along other types of curves and is referred to as arclength.

In a triangle, the length of an altitude, a line segment drawn from a vertex perpendicular to the side not passing through the vertex (referred to as a base of the triangle), is called the height of the triangle.

The area of a rectangle is defined to be length × width of the rectangle. If a long thin rectangle is stood up on its short side then its area could also be described as its height × width.

The volume of a solid rectangular box (such as a plank of wood) is often described as length × height × depth.

The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of its sides.

The circumference of a circular disk is the length of the boundary (a circle) of that disk.

=== Other geometries ===

In other geometries, length may be measured along possibly curved paths, called geodesics. The Riemannian geometry used in general relativity is an example of such a geometry. In spherical geometry, length is measured along the great circles on the sphere and the distance between two points on the sphere is the shorter of the two lengths on the great circle, which is determined by the plane through the two points and the center of the sphere.

=== Graph theory ===
In an unweighted graph, the length of a cycle, path, or walk is the number of edges it uses. In a weighted graph, it may instead be the sum of the weights of the edges that it uses.

Length is used to define the shortest path, girth (shortest cycle length), and longest path between two vertices in a graph.

=== Measure theory ===

In measure theory, length is most often generalized to general sets of formula_1 via the Lebesgue measure. In the one-dimensional case, the Lebesgue outer measure of a set is defined in terms of the lengths of open intervals. Concretely, the length of an open interval is first defined as
: formula_2 of a general set formula_3 may then be defined as
: formula_4

== Units ==

In the physical sciences and engineering, when one speaks of , the word is synonymous with distance. There are several units that are used to measure length. Historically, units of length may have been derived from the lengths of human body parts, the distance travelled in a number of paces, the distance between landmarks or places on the Earth, or arbitrarily on the length of some common object.

In the International System of Units (SI), the base unit of length is the metre (symbol, m), now defined in terms of the speed of light (about 300 million metres per second). The millimetre (mm), centimetre (cm) and the kilometre (km), derived from the metre, are also commonly used units. In U.S. customary units, English or imperial system of units, commonly used units of length are the inch (in), the foot (ft), the yard (yd), and the mile (mi). A unit of length used in navigation is the nautical mile (nmi).

 km = 
 miles 

Units used to denote distances in the vastness of space, as in astronomy, are much longer than those typically used on Earth (metre or kilometre) and include the astronomical unit (au), the light-year, and the parsec (pc).

Units used to denote sub-atomic distances, as in nuclear physics, are much smaller than the millimetre. Examples include the fermi (fm).

<text>Louis Ginzberg (, &quot;Levy Gintzburg&quot;; , &quot;Levy Ginzberg&quot;; November 28, 1873 – November 11, 1953) was a Russian-born American rabbi and Talmudic scholar of Lithuanian-Jewish descent, contributing editor to numerous articles of &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; (1906), and leading figure in the Conservative movement of Judaism during the early 20th century.

==Early life==
Ginzberg was born in Kaunas, Vilna Governorate (then called Kovno). His religious Lithuanian-Jewish family&#x27;s piety and erudition were renowned, seeing that they traced their lineage back to the Gaon of Vilna&#x27;s brother. Ginzberg received a traditional Jewish education, and later studied in German universities.

==Career==
Ginzberg first arrived in the United States in 1899. He began teaching the Talmud at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS) from its reorganization in 1902 until his death in 1953. During this time, he trained two generations of future Conservative rabbis, influencing almost every rabbi of the Conservative movement in a personal way. Ginzberg was highly praised by his colleagues; JTS leader Louis Finkelstein described him as a &quot;living symbol of love for Torah&quot;. Leading Israeli Conservative posek David Golinkin has written prolifically on Ginzberg and published a collection of his responsa.

Ginzberg&#x27;s knowledge made him the expert to defend Judaism both in national and international affairs. In 1906, he defended the Jewish community against anti-Semitic accusations that Jews ritually slaughtered Gentiles. In 1913, Louis Marshall requested that Ginzberg refute the Beilis blood libel charge in Kyiv. On account of his impressive scholarship in Jewish studies, Ginzberg was one of 66 scholars honored with a doctorate by Harvard University in celebration of its tercentenary in 1936.

==Views==
In his opening address to students, Ginzberg spoke of the need to keep Conservative Jewry under the rubric of &quot;halakha&quot;. 

Ginzberg&#x27;s initiative to base &quot;halakhic&quot; decisions on law committees and not laymen is the method the Conservative movement describes as its present one till today.

In 1918, at the Sixth Annual Convention, Ginzberg, as the acting president, declared that United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism stood for &#x27;historical Judaism&#x27; and thus elaborates:

Ginzberg sought to emulate the Vilna Gaon&#x27;s intermingling of &quot;academic knowledge&quot; in Torah studies under the label &quot;historical Judaism&quot;; for example, in his book &quot;Students, Scholars and Saints&quot;, Ginzberg quotes the Vilna Gaon&#x27;s instruction, &quot;Do not regard the views of the Shulchan Aruch as binding if you think that they are not in agreement with those of the Talmud.&quot;

In 1943, Ginzberg predicted that after the war, only two centers of Jewish culture would remain in the world: The United States and Palestine—with the latter depending upon the former for support. He foresaw problems for the Jews remaining in Europe due to their being perceived as those who caused Germany to lose the war.

==Responsa==
One of Ginzberg&#x27;s responsa concerns the use of wine in the Jewish community during the Prohibition Era. The Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified on January 16, 1920, declared that &quot;the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within ... the United States ... for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited.&quot; The subsequent Volstead Act defined &quot;intoxicating liquors&quot; and provided for several exceptions, one of which as for sacramental use. The Christian Church was able to successfully regulate the use of ceremonial wine. The clergy could easily monitor the nominal amount of sacramental wine that each worshipper drank, especially because it was usually drunk only in Church and only on Sundays (for the communion or Eucharist ceremony). This was not the case for the Jews, who needed a greater quantity of wine per person. Furthermore, the wine was drunk in the privacy of the home on Shabbat, Jewish holidays, weddings, and &quot;brit milah&quot; (circumcision) ceremonies. This alone would have made the regulation of ceremonial wine complicated. It was not difficult for crooks to rig illegal &quot;wine synagogues&quot; to trick the government to receive their wine which would then be bootlegged.

While contemporary Orthodox Jewish authorities are generally permissive of grape juice as a wine substitute, Orthodox rabbis of the 1920s soundly rejected its use. The Reform movement in 1920 proclaimed that grape juice be used instead of wine to eliminate future complaints. Shortly afterwards, on January 24, 1922, the Conservative movement publicized the 71-page response written by Ginzberg tackling the &quot;halakhic&quot; aspects of drinking grape juice instead of wine in light of the historical circumstances. Besides Ginzberg&#x27;s well-grounded decision to permit grape juice, he includes meta-&quot;halakhic&quot; reasoning:

At the time of Ginzburg&#x27;s responsum, the Orthodox rabbinate had exclusive authority to sanction sacramental wine for Jews, and the responsum was thought by the Orthodox community to be tainted by self-interest.

==Works==

Ginzberg was the author of a number of scholarly Jewish works, including a commentary on the Jerusalem Talmud and his six-volume (plus a one-volume index) &quot;The Legends of the Jews,&quot; (1909) which combined hundreds of legends and parables from a lifetime of midrash research.
&quot;The Legends of the Jews&quot; is an original synthesis of a vast amount of &quot;aggadah&quot; from all of classical rabbinic literature, as well as apocryphal, pseudopigraphical and even early Christian literature, with legends ranging from the creation of the world and the fall of Adam, through a huge collection of legends on Moses, and ending with the story of Esther and the Jews in Persia.

Ginzberg also write &quot;Geonica&quot; (1909), an account of the Babylonian Geonim containing lengthy extracts from their responsa, as discovered in the form of fragments in the Cairo Genizah. He continued this work in the similar collection entitled &quot;Ginze Schechter&quot; (1929).

Ginzberg wrote 406 articles and several monograph-length entries for the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; (Levy 2002), some later collected in his &quot;Legend and Lore.&quot; He was also founder and president of the American Academy of Jewish Research.

Many of his &quot;halakhic&quot; responsa are collected in &quot;The Responsa of Professor Louis Ginzberg,&quot; edited by David Golinkin.

==Personal life==
Ginzberg had a long term platonic relationship with Henrietta Szold, who was his editor at the Jewish Publication Society. She was in love with him, but was 13 years older than him.

Ginzberg visited Berlin in 1908 and became engaged to Adele Katzenstein while he was there. Katzenstein was about 22 at the time. They had two children. Son Eli Ginzberg (1911–2002) was a professor of economics at Columbia University. The second child was a daughter, Sophie Ginzberg Gould (1914–1985).

<doc id="18544" wikidata="Q1812306" url="?curid=18544" title="Left-arm unorthodox spin">
<text>Left-arm unorthodox spin, also known as slow left-arm wrist spin, is a type of spin bowling in the sport of cricket. Left-arm unorthodox spin bowlers use wrist spin to spin the ball, and make it deviate, or &#x27;turn&#x27; from left to right after pitching. The direction of turn is the same as that of a traditional right-handed off spin bowler, although the ball will usually turn more sharply due to the spin being imparted predominantly by the wrist.

Some left-arm unorthodox bowlers also bowl what has historically been referred to as a chinaman, the equivalent of a googly, or &#x27;wrong&#x27;un&#x27;, which turns from right to left on the pitch. The ball turns away from the right-handed batsman, as if the bowler were an orthodox left-arm spinner.

==Notable left-arm unorthodox spin bowlers==
The first cricketer known to bowl the style of delivery was 19th-century South African bowler Charlie Llewellyn. Llewellyn toured North America with Bernard Bosanquet, the originator of the googly delivery, and it is likely that Llewellyn learned the googly-style of delivery from him, bowling it with his left-arm.

Among noted players who have bowled the delivery are Denis Compton, who originally bowled orthodox slow-left arm deliveries but developed left-arm wrist spin, taking most of his 622 first-class wickets using the delivery. Chuck Fleetwood-Smith used the delivery in the 1930s, including in his 10 Test matches. Although better known for fast bowling and orthodox slow left-arm, Garfield Sobers could also use it to good effect. In cricket&#x27;s modern era, Australian Brad Hogg brought the delivery to wider notice and had one of the most well-disguised wrong&#x27;uns. Kuldeep Yadav, who debuted for India in March 2017, bowls left-arm wrist spin, and Paul Adams played 45 Test matches and 24 One-day internationals for South Africa between 1995 and 2004 using the delivery. Michael Bevan and Dave Mohammed are also considered to be &quot;among the better known&quot; bowlers to use the style.

In 2021 &quot;The Guardian&quot; claimed that Kuldeep, Tabraiz Shamsi of South Africa and the Afghan bowler Noor Ahmad were &quot;probably the foremost left-arm wrist-spinners in world cricket&quot;, while in 2022 Michael Rippon was reported as &quot;the first specialist left-arm wristspinner&quot; to play for New Zealand. In the women&#x27;s game, Kary Chan of Hong Kong uses left-arm wrist spin deliveries.

Instances of left-arm unorthodox spinners taking a ten-wicket haul in a Test match are rare. Examples include Chuck Fleetwood-Smith against England in 1936–37, Michael Bevan against the West Indies in 1996–97, and Paul Adams against Bangladesh in 2002–03.

In 2007 CricInfo suggested that left-arm wrist-spin bowlers are uncommon because it is &quot;difficult to control left-arm wrist spin. And [...] the ball coming in to a right-hander is considered less dangerous than the one leaving him&quot;. A left-arm wrist spin bowler&#x27;s standard delivery will turn towards a right-handed batsman, as opposed to a right-arm leg spin bowler who will turn the ball away from them. In 2024 Cameron Ponsonby reiterated this view on The Final Word podcast, stating in jest of the success of Kuldeep Yadav,

&quot;The hardest thing in the world, in this sport, is to bowl wrist spin. The reason why right arm leg spin works and is effective is because it spins the ball away from the bat. That&#x27;s the positive. The negative side of that is you have less control. [...] What&#x27;s bad about off spin? You spin the ball into the right-hander. What&#x27;s good about off spin? You have control. Left arm wrist spin: what&#x27;s good about it? Nothing, because you spin the ball into the right-hander without control.&quot;

==Historical use of the term &#x27;chinaman&#x27;==
Historically the term &quot;chinaman&quot; was sometimes used to describe the googly delivery or other unusual deliveries, whether bowled by right or left-arm bowlers. The left-arm wrist spinner&#x27;s delivery that is the equivalent of the googly eventually became known as the &quot;chinaman&quot;.

The origin of the term is unclear, although it is known to have been in use in Yorkshire during the 1920s and may have been first used in reference to Roy Kilner. It is possible that it is a guarded reference to Charlie Llewellyn, the first left-arm bowler to bowl the equivalent of the googly. It is first known to have been used in print in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1926 in reference to the possibility of Yorkshire bowler George Macaulay bowling a googly, but the term became more widely used after a Test match between England and West Indies at Old Trafford in 1933. Ellis Achong, a player of Chinese origin who bowled slow left-arm orthodox spin, had Walter Robins stumped off an orthodox delivery. As he walked back to the pavilion, had Walter Robins stumped off a surprise delivery that spun into the right-hander from outside the off stump. As he walked back to the pavilion, Robins reportedly said to the umpire, &quot;fancy being done by a bloody Chinaman!&quot;, leading to the more widespread use of the term.

In 2017, Australian journalist Andrew Wu, who is of Chinese descent, raised concerns about the use of the term as &quot;racially offensive&quot;, arguing the term itself &quot;has historically been used in a contemptuous manner to describe the Chinese&quot;. &quot;Wisden&quot; formally changed their wording of the term to slow left-arm wrist-spin in the 2018 edition of the Almanack, describing chinaman as &quot;no longer appropriate&quot;. CricInfo followed suit in 2021, noting that although some argued that its use in cricket &quot;was not meant to be derogatory&quot;, that its continued use was inappropriate. Some writers continue to use the term.

<doc id="18549" wikidata="Q346" url="?curid=18549" title="Louis IX of France">
<text>Louis IX (25 April 1214 – 25 August 1270), also known as Saint Louis, was King of France from 1226 until his death in 1270. He is widely recognized as the most distinguished of the Direct Capetians. Following the death of his father, Louis VIII, he was crowned in Reims at the age of 12. His mother, Blanche of Castile, effectively ruled the kingdom as regent until he came of age, and continued to serve as his trusted adviser until her death. During his formative years, Blanche successfully confronted rebellious vassals and championed the Capetian cause in the Albigensian Crusade, which had been ongoing for the past two decades.

As an adult, Louis IX grappled with persistent conflicts involving some of the most influential nobles in his kingdom, including Hugh X of Lusignan and Peter I of Brittany. Concurrently, England&#x27;s Henry III sought to reclaim the Angevin continental holdings, only to be decisively defeated at the Battle of Taillebourg. Louis expanded his territory by annexing several provinces, including parts of Aquitaine, Maine, and Provence. Keeping a promise he made while praying for recovery from a grave illness, Louis led the ill-fated Seventh and Eighth Crusades against the Muslim dynasties that controlled North Africa, Egypt, and the Holy Land. He was captured and ransomed during the Seventh Crusade, and later succumbed to dysentery during the Eighth Crusade. His son, Philip III, succeeded him.

Louis instigated significant reforms in the French legal system, creating a royal justice mechanism that allowed petitioners to appeal judgments directly to the monarch. He abolished trials by ordeal, endeavored to terminate private wars, and incorporated the presumption of innocence into criminal proceedings. To implement his new legal framework, he established the offices of provosts and bailiffs. Louis IX&#x27;s reign is often marked as an economic and political zenith for medieval France, and he held immense respect throughout Christendom. His reputation as a fair and judicious ruler led to his being solicited to mediate disputes beyond his own kingdom.

Louis&#x27;s admirers through the centuries have celebrated him as the quintessential Christian monarch. His skill as a knight and engaging manner with the public contributed to his popularity. Saint Louis was extremely pious, earning the moniker of a &quot;monk king&quot;. Louis was a staunch Christian and rigorously enforced Catholic orthodoxy. He enacted harsh laws against blasphemy, and he also launched actions against France&#x27;s Jewish population, including ordering them to wear a yellow badge of shame, as well as the notorious burning of the Talmud following the Disputation of Paris. Louis IX holds the distinction of being the sole canonized king of France.

==Sources==
Much of what is known of Louis&#x27;s life comes from Jean de Joinville&#x27;s famous &quot;Life of Saint Louis&quot;. Joinville was a close friend, confidant, and counselor to the king. He participated as a witness in the papal inquest into Louis&#x27;s life that resulted in his canonization in 1297 by Pope Boniface VIII. Two other important biographies were written by the king&#x27;s confessor, Geoffrey of Beaulieu, and his chaplain, William of Chartres. While several individuals wrote biographies in the decades following the king&#x27;s death, only Jean of Joinville, Geoffrey of Beaulieu, and William of Chartres wrote from personal knowledge of the king and of the events they describe, and all three are biased favorably to the king. The fourth important source of information is William of Saint-Parthus&#x27;s 19th-century biography, which he wrote using material from the papal inquest mentioned above.

==Early life==
Louis was born on 25 April 1214 at Poissy, near Paris, the son of Louis the Lion and Blanche of Castile, and was baptized there in &quot;La Collégiale Notre-Dame&quot; church. His paternal grandfather was King Philip II of France, and his maternal grandfather was King Alfonso VIII of Castile. Tutors of Blanche&#x27;s choosing taught him Latin, public speaking, writing, military arts, and government. He was nine years old when his grandfather Philip II died and his father became King Louis VIII.

== Minority (1226–1234) ==
Louis was 12 years old when his father died on 8 November 1226. He was crowned king on 29 November 1226 at Reims Cathedral, officiated by the bishop of Soissons. His mother, Blanche, ruled France as regent during his minority. Louis&#x27;s mother instilled in him her devout Christianity. She is once recorded to have said:

His younger brother Charles I of Sicily (1227–85) was created count of Anjou, thus founding the Capetian Angevin dynasty.

In 1229, when Louis was 15, his mother ended the Albigensian Crusade by signing an agreement with Raymond VII of Toulouse. Raymond VI of Toulouse had been suspected of ordering the assassination of Pierre de Castelnau, a Roman Catholic preacher who attempted to convert the Cathars.

On 27 May 1234, Louis married Margaret of Provence (1221–1295); she was crowned in the cathedral of Sens the next day. Margaret was the sister of Eleanor of Provence, who later married Henry III of England. The new queen&#x27;s religious zeal made her a well-suited partner for the king, and they are attested to have gotten along well, enjoying riding together, reading, and listening to music. His closeness to Margaret aroused jealousy in his mother, who tried to keep the couple apart as much as she could.

While his contemporaries viewed his reign as co-rule between the king and his mother, historians generally believe Louis began ruling personally in 1234, with his mother assuming a more advisory role. She continued to have a strong influence on the king until her death in 1252.

== Louis as king ==

=== Arts ===
Louis&#x27;s patronage of the arts inspired much innovation in Gothic art and architecture. The style of his court was influential throughout Europe, both because of artwork purchased from Parisian masters for export, and by the marriage of the king&#x27;s daughters and other female relatives to foreigners. They became emissaries of Parisian models and styles elsewhere. Louis&#x27;s personal chapel, the &quot;Sainte-Chapelle&quot; in Paris, which was known for its intricate stained-glass windows, was copied more than once by his descendants elsewhere. Louis is believed to have ordered the production of the Morgan Bible and the Arsenal Bible, both deluxe illuminated manuscripts.

During the so-called &quot;golden century of Saint Louis&quot;, the kingdom of France was at its height in Europe, both politically and economically. Saint Louis was regarded as &quot;&quot;primus inter pares&quot;,&quot; first among equals, among the kings and rulers of the continent. He commanded the largest army and ruled the largest and wealthiest kingdom, the European centre of arts and intellectual thought at the time. The foundations for the notable college of theology, later known as the Sorbonne, were laid in Paris about the year 1257.

=== Arbitration ===

The prestige and respect felt by Europeans for King Louis IX were due more to the appeal of his personality than to military domination. For his contemporaries, he was the quintessential example of the Christian prince and embodied the whole of Christendom in his person. His reputation for fairness and even saintliness was already well established while he was alive, and on many occasions he was chosen as an arbiter in quarrels among the rulers of Europe.

Shortly before 1256, Enguerrand IV, Lord of Coucy, arrested and without trial hanged three young squires of Laon, whom he accused of poaching in his forest. In 1256 Louis had the lord arrested and brought to the Louvre by his sergeants. Enguerrand demanded judgment by his peers and trial by battle, which the king refused because he thought it obsolete. Enguerrand was tried, sentenced, and ordered to pay 12,000 livres. Part of the money was to pay for masses to be said in perpetuity for the souls of the men he had hanged.

In 1258, Louis and James I of Aragon signed the Treaty of Corbeil to end areas of contention between them. By this treaty, Louis renounced his feudal overlordship over the County of Barcelona and Roussillon, which was held by the King of Aragon. James in turn renounced his feudal overlordship over several counties in southern France, including Provence and Languedoc. In 1259 Louis signed the Treaty of Paris, by which Henry III of England was confirmed in his possession of territories in southwestern France, and Louis received the provinces of Anjou, Normandy (Normandie), Poitou, Maine, and Touraine.

=== Religion ===

The perception of Louis IX by his contemporaries as the exemplary Christian prince was reinforced by his religious zeal. Louis was an extremely devout Catholic, and he built the &quot;Sainte-Chapelle&quot; (&quot;Holy Chapel&quot;), located within the royal palace complex (now the Paris Hall of Justice), on the &quot;Île de la Cité&quot; in the centre of Paris. The &quot;Sainte Chapelle&quot;, a prime example of the Rayonnant style of Gothic architecture, was erected as a shrine for the crown of thorns and a fragment of the True Cross, precious relics of the Passion of Christ. He acquired these in 1239–41 from Emperor Baldwin II of the Latin Empire of Constantinople by agreeing to pay off Baldwin&#x27;s debt to the Venetian merchant Niccolo Quirino, for which Baldwin had pledged the Crown of Thorns as collateral. Louis IX paid the exorbitant sum of 135,000 livres to clear the debt.

In 1230, the King forbade all forms of usury, defined at the time as any taking of interest and therefore covering most banking activities. Louis used these anti-usury laws to extract funds from Jewish and Lombard moneylenders, with the hopes that it would help pay for a future crusade. Louis also oversaw the Disputation of Paris in 1240, in which Paris&#x27;s Jewish leaders were imprisoned and forced to admit to anti-Christian passages in the Talmud, the major source of Jewish commentaries on the Bible and religious law. As a result of the disputation, Pope Gregory IX declared that all copies of the Talmud should be seized and destroyed. In 1242, Louis ordered the burning of 12,000 Talmudim, along with other important Jewish books and scripture. The edict against the Talmud was eventually overturned by Gregory IX&#x27;s successor, Innocent IV.

Louis also expanded the scope of the Inquisition in France. He set the punishment for blasphemy to mutilation of the tongue and lips. The area most affected by this expansion was southern France, where the Cathar sect had been strongest. The rate of confiscation of property from the Cathars and others reached its highest levels in the years before his first crusade and slowed upon his return to France in 1254.

In 1250, Louis headed a crusade to Egypt and was taken prisoner. During his captivity, he recited the Divine Office every day. After his release against ransom, he visited the Holy Land before returning to France. In these deeds, Louis IX tried to fulfill what he considered the duty of France as &quot;the eldest daughter of the Church&quot; (&quot;la fille aînée de l&#x27;Église&quot;), a tradition of protector of the Church going back to the Franks and Charlemagne, who had been crowned by Pope Leo III in Rome in 800. The kings of France were known in the Church by the title &quot;most Christian king&quot; (&quot;Rex Christianissimus&quot;).

Louis founded many hospitals and houses: the House of the Filles-Dieu for reformed prostitutes; the Quinze-Vingt for 300 blind men (1254), and hospitals at Pontoise, Vernon, and Compiègne.

St. Louis installed a house of the Trinitarian Order at Fontainebleau, his chateau and estate near Paris. He chose Trinitarians as his chaplains and was accompanied by them on his crusades. In his spiritual testament he wrote, &quot;My dearest son, you should permit yourself to be tormented by every kind of martyrdom before you would allow yourself to commit a mortal sin.&quot;
Louis authored and sent the &quot;Enseignements&quot;, or teachings, to his son Philip III. The letter outlined how Philip should follow the example of Jesus Christ in order to be a moral leader. The letter is estimated to have been written in 1267, three years before Louis&#x27;s death.

== Personal reign (1235–1266) ==

===Seventh Crusade===
Louis and his followers landed in Egypt on 4 or 5 June 1249 and began their campaign with the capture of the port of Damietta. This attack caused some disruption in the Muslim Ayyubid empire, especially as the current sultan, Al-Malik as-Salih Najm al-Din Ayyub, was on his deathbed. However, the march of Europeans from Damietta toward Cairo through the Nile River Delta went slowly. The seasonal rising of the Nile and the summer heat made it impossible for them to advance. During this time, the Ayyubid sultan died, and the sultan&#x27;s wife Shajar al-Durr set in motion a shift in power that would make her Queen and eventually result in the rule of the Egyptian army of the Mamluks.

On 8 February 1250, Louis lost his army at the Battle of Fariskur and was captured by the Egyptians. His release was eventually negotiated in return for a ransom of 400,000 &quot;livres tournois&quot; (roughly US$80 million today) and the surrender of the city of Damietta.

===Four years in the Kingdom of Jerusalem===
Upon his liberation from captivity in Egypt, Louis IX devoted four years to fortifying the Kingdom of Jerusalem, focusing his efforts in Acre, Caesarea, and Jaffa. He used his resources to aid the Crusaders in reconstructing their defenses and actively engaged in diplomatic endeavors with the Ayyubid dynasty. In the spring of 1254, Louis and his remaining forces made their return to France.

Louis maintained regular correspondence and envoy exchanges with the Mongol rulers of his era. During his first crusade in 1248, he received envoys from Eljigidei, the Mongol military leader stationed in Armenia and Persia. Eljigidei proposed that Louis should launch an offensive in Egypt while he targeted Baghdad to prevent the unification of the Muslim forces in Egypt and Syria. In response, Louis sent André de Longjumeau, a Dominican priest, as a delegate to the Khangan Güyük Khan () in Mongolia. However, Güyük&#x27;s death preceded the arrival of the emissary, and his widow and acting regent, Oghul Qaimish, rejected the diplomatic proposition.

Louis sent another representative, the Franciscan missionary and explorer William of Rubruck, to the Mongol court. Rubruck visited the Khagan Möngke () in Mongolia and spent several years there. In 1259, Berke, the leader of the Golden Horde, demanded Louis&#x27;s submission. In contrast, Mongol emperors Möngke and Khubilai&#x27;s brother, the Ilkhan Hulegu, sent a letter to the French king, soliciting his military aid; this letter, however, never reached France.

== Later reign (1267–1270) ==

===Eighth Crusade and death===
In a parliament held at Paris, 24 March 1267, Louis and his three sons &quot;took the cross.&quot; On hearing the reports of the missionaries, Louis resolved to land at Tunis, and he ordered his younger brother, Charles of Anjou, to join him there. The crusaders, among whom was the English prince Edward Longshanks, landed at Carthage 17 July 1270, but disease broke out in the camp.

Louis died at Tunis on 25 August 1270, during an epidemic of dysentery that swept through his army. According to European custom, his body was subjected to the process known as &quot;mos Teutonicus&quot; prior to most of his remains being returned to France. Louis was succeeded as King of France by his son, Philip III.

Louis&#x27;s younger brother, Charles I of Naples, preserved his heart and intestines, and conveyed them for burial in the Cathedral of Monreale near Palermo.Louis&#x27;s bones were carried overland in a lengthy processional across Sicily, Italy, the Alps, and France, until they were interred in the royal necropolis at Saint-Denis in May 1271. Charles and Philip III later dispersed a number of relics to promote Louis&#x27;s veneration.

Louis and Margaret&#x27;s two children who died in infancy were first buried at the Cistercian abbey of Royaumont. In 1820 they were transferred and reinterred to Saint-Denis Basilica.

==Ancestry==


==Veneration as a saint==
Pope Boniface VIII proclaimed the canonization of Louis in 1297; he is the only French king to be declared a saint. Louis IX is often considered the model of the ideal Christian monarch.

Named in his honour, the Sisters of Charity of St. Louis is a Roman Catholic religious order founded in Vannes, France, in 1803. A similar order, the Sisters of St Louis, was founded in Juilly in 1842.

He is honoured as co-patron of the Third Order of St. Francis, which claims him as a member of the Order. When he became king, over a hundred poor people were served meals in his house on ordinary days. Often the king served these guests himself. His acts of charity, coupled with his devout religious practices, gave rise to the legend that he joined the Third Order of St. Francis, though it is unlikely that he ever actually joined the order.

The Catholic Church and Episcopal Church honor him with a feast day on 25 August.

This is a trinitarian representation to oppose to the analogous representation of his nephew Philip IV the Fair, as the Beast from the Sea. The idea came to Dante from the transposition of the Revelation of St. John in the history, studied from the abbot and theologian Joachim of Fiore.

<doc id="18551" wikidata="Q190102" url="?curid=18551" title="Linear B">
<text>Linear B is a syllabic script that was used for writing in Mycenaean Greek, the earliest attested form of the Greek language. The script predates the Greek alphabet by several centuries, the earliest known examples dating to around 1450 BC. It is adapted from the earlier Linear A, an undeciphered script perhaps used for writing the Minoan language, as is the later Cypriot syllabary, which also recorded Greek. Linear B, found mainly in the palace archives at Knossos, Kydonia, Pylos, Thebes and Mycenae, disappeared with the fall of Mycenaean civilization during the Late Bronze Age collapse. The succeeding period, known as the Greek Dark Ages, provides no evidence of the use of writing.

Linear B was deciphered in 1952 by English architect and self-taught linguist Michael Ventris based on the research of American classicist Alice Kober. It is the only Bronze Age Aegean script to have been deciphered, with Linear A, Cypro-Minoan, and Cretan hieroglyphic remaining unreadable.

Linear B consists of around 87 syllabic signs and over 100 ideographic signs. These ideograms or &quot;signifying&quot; signs symbolize objects or commodities. They have no phonetic value and are never used as word signs in writing a sentence.

The application of Linear B texts appear to have been mostly confined to administrative contexts, mainly at Mycenaean palatial sites. In the handwriting of all the thousands of clay tablets, a relatively small number of scribes have been detected: 45 in Pylos (west coast of the Peloponnese, in Southern Greece) and 66 in Knossos (Crete). The use of Linear B signs on trade objects like amphora was more widespread. Once the palaces were destroyed, the script disappeared.

==Script==
Linear B has roughly 200 signs, divided into syllabic signs with phonetic values and ideograms with semantic values. The representations and naming of these signs have been standardized by a series of international colloquia starting in Paris in 1956. After the third meeting in 1961 at the Wingspread Conference Center in Racine, Wisconsin, a standard proposed primarily by Emmett L. Bennett, Jr. became known as the Wingspread Convention, which was adopted by a new organization, the &quot;Comité International Permanent des Études Mycéniennes&quot; (CIPEM: Permanent International Committee of Mycenaean Studies), affiliated in 1970 by the fifth colloquium with UNESCO. Colloquia continue: the 13th occurred in 2010 in Paris.

Many of the signs are identical or similar to those in Linear A; however, Linear A encodes an as yet unknown language, and it is uncertain whether similar signs had the same phonetic values.

===Syllabic signs===
The grid developed during decipherment by Michael Ventris and John Chadwick of phonetic values for syllabic signs is shown below. (Note that &quot;q&quot; represents the labialized velar stops , not the uvular stop of the IPA.)

Initial consonants are in the leftmost column; vowels are in the top row beneath the title. The transcription of the syllable, which may not have been pronounced that way, is listed next to the sign along with Bennett&#x27;s identifying number for the sign preceded by an asterisk (as was Ventris&#x27; and Chadwick&#x27;s convention). If the transcription of the sign remains uncertain, Bennett&#x27;s number serves to identify the sign. The signs on the tablets and sealings often show considerable variation from each other and from the representations below. Discovery of the reasons for the variation and possible semantic differences is a topic of ongoing debate in Mycenaean studies.

=== Special and unknown signs ===

In addition to the grid, the first edition of &quot;Documents in Mycenaean Greek&quot; contained a number of other signs termed &quot;homophones&quot; because they appeared at that time to resemble the sounds of other syllables and were transcribed accordingly: &quot;pa2&quot; and &quot;pa3&quot; were presumed homophonous to &quot;pa&quot;. Many of these were identified by the second edition and are shown in the &quot;special values&quot; below. The second edition relates: &quot;It may be taken as axiomatic that there are no true homophones.&quot; The unconfirmed identifications of &quot;*34&quot; and &quot;*35&quot; as &quot;ai2&quot; and &quot;ai3&quot; were removed. &quot;pa2&quot; became &quot;qa&quot;.

Other values remain unknown, mainly because of scarcity of evidence concerning them. Note that *34 and *35 are mirror images of each other, but whether this graphic relationship indicates a phonetic one remains unconfirmed.

CIPEM inherited the former authority of Bennett and the Wingspread convention in deciding what signs are &quot;confirmed&quot; and how to officially represent the various sign categories. In editions of Mycenaean texts, the signs whose values have not been confirmed by CIPEM are always transcribed as numbers preceded by an asterisk (e.g., &quot;*64&quot;). CIPEM also allocates the numerical identifiers, and until such allocation, new signs (or obscured or mutilated signs) are transcribed as a bullet-point enclosed in square brackets: [•].

=== Spelling and pronunciation ===

The signs are approximations, since each may be used to represent a variety of about 70 distinct combinations of sounds within rules and conventions. The grid presents a system of monosyllabic signs of the type V/CV. Clarification of the 14 or so special values tested the limits of the grid model, but Chadwick eventually concluded that even with the ramifications, the syllabic signs can unexceptionally be considered monosyllabic.

Possible exceptions, Chadwick goes on to explain, include the two diphthongs,  (&quot;ai&quot;) and  (&quot;au&quot;), as in , &quot;ai-ku-pi-ti-jo&quot;, for &quot;Aiguptios&quot; (, &quot;Egyptian&quot;) and , &quot;au-ke-wa&quot;, for &quot;Augewās&quot; ( &quot;Augeas&quot;). However, a diphthong is by definition two vowels united into a single sound and therefore might be typed as just V. Thus  (&quot;rai&quot;), as in , &quot;e-rai-wo&quot;, for &quot;elaiwon&quot; (), is of the type CV. Diphthongs are otherwise treated as two monosyllables: , &quot;a-ro-u-ra&quot;, for &quot;arourans&quot; (accusative plural of , &quot;tamarisk trees&quot;), of the types CV and V. Lengths of vowels and accents are not marked.

 (&quot;Twe&quot;),  (&quot;two&quot;),  (&quot;dwe&quot;),  (&quot;dwo&quot;),  (&quot;nwa&quot;) and the more doubtful  (&quot;swi&quot;) and  (&quot;swa&quot;) may be regarded as beginning with labialized consonants, rather than two consonants, even though they may alternate with a two-sign form: &quot;o-da-twe-ta&quot; and &quot;o-da-tu-we-ta&quot; for &quot;Odatwenta&quot;; &quot;a-si-wi-jo&quot; and &quot;a-swi-jo&quot; for &quot;Aswios&quot; (). Similarly,  (&quot;rya&quot;),  (&quot;ryo&quot;) and  (&quot;tya&quot;) begin with palatalized consonants rather than two consonants: &quot;-ti-ri-ja&quot; for &quot;-trja&quot; (-).

The one sign Chadwick tags as the exception to the monosyllabic rule is  (&quot;pte&quot;), but this he attributes to a development &quot;pte&quot;&lt;&quot;*pje&quot; as in &quot;kleptei&quot;&lt;&quot;*klep-jei&quot;.

Linear B does not consistently distinguish between voiced and unvoiced stop consonants or between aspirated and unaspirated stops, even though these distinctions are phonemic in Mycenaean Greek. (The exception is the dental series, where syllables starting with the voiced dental stop are written differently from syllables starting with the voiceless unaspirated or voiceless aspirated dental stop.) For example, &quot;pa-te&quot; is &quot;patēr&quot; (), &quot;pa-si&quot; is &quot;phāsi&quot; (), &quot;ko-ru&quot; is &quot;korus&quot; (, &quot;helmet&quot;), &quot;ka-ra-we&quot; is &quot;grāwes&quot; (plural of ), &quot;ko-no&quot; is &quot;skhoinos&quot; (&quot;rope&quot;), &quot;to-so&quot; is &quot;tosos&quot; ( or ), &quot;to-ra-ke&quot; is &quot;thōrākes&quot; (plural of , &quot;breastplate&quot;). The exceptional &quot;d&quot;-series for voiced dentals is illustrated by &quot;do-ra&quot; for &quot;dōra&quot; (plural of , &quot;gift&quot;).

In some cases aspiration may be marked, but this is optional: &quot;pu-te&quot; for &quot;phutēr&quot; (&quot;planter&quot;, from ), but &quot;phu-te-re&quot; for &quot;phutēres&quot; (&quot;planters&quot;). Initial /h/ may be marked only when followed by &quot;a&quot;, and only rarely: &quot;ha-te-ro&quot; for &quot;hateron&quot; (masculine ), and yet &quot;a-ni-ja&quot; for &quot;hāniai&quot; ().

The &quot;q&quot;-series is used for syllables beginning with labialized velar consonants (see under Mycenaean Greek), a class of consonants that disappeared from classical Greek by regular phonetic change (becoming in various circumstances , , , or , , ). These consonants had various sources: inheritance from Proto-Indo-European, assimilation, borrowing of foreign words, especially names. In Mycenaean they are /kʷ/, /gʷ/, and rarely /kʷh/ in names and a few words: &quot;a-pi-qo-ro&quot; for &quot;amphiquoloi&quot; (); &quot;qo-u-ko-ro&quot; for &quot;guoukoloi&quot; (, &quot;cowherders&quot;); &quot;qa-si-re-u&quot; for &quot;guasileus&quot; (, &quot;basileus&quot;, meaning in this period &quot;court official or local chieftain&quot;), &quot;-qo-i-ta&quot; for -.

The &quot;j&quot;-series represents the semivowel equivalent to English &quot;y&quot;, and is used word-initially and as an intervocalic glide after a syllable ending in &quot;i&quot;: &quot;-a-jo&quot; for (&quot;-aios&quot;); &quot;a-te-mi-ti-jo&quot; for (&quot;Artemitios&quot;). The &quot;w&quot;-series similarly are semivowels used word-initially and intervocalically after a syllable ending in &quot;u&quot;: &quot;ku-wa-no&quot; for &quot;kuanos&quot; (, &quot;blue&quot;).

The &quot;r&quot;-series includes both the /r/ and /l/ phonemes: &quot;ti-ri-po&quot; for &quot;tripos&quot; (, i.e. ) and &quot;tu-ri-so&quot; for &quot;Tulisos&quot; ().

Some consonants in some contexts are not written (but are understood to be present), such as word-initial &quot;s-&quot; and &quot;-w&quot; before a consonant, as in &quot;pe-ma&quot; for &quot;sperma&quot; (, &quot;seed&quot;). The &quot;pe-&quot;, which was primarily used as its value &quot;pe&quot; of grid class CV, is here being used for &quot;sper-&quot;. This was not an innovative or exceptional use, but followed the stated rules. Syllable-final &quot;-l&quot;, &quot;-m&quot;, &quot;-n&quot;, &quot;-r&quot; and &quot;-s&quot; are also not written out, and only word-final velars are notated by plene writing: &quot;a-to-ro-qo&quot; for &quot;anthrōquos&quot; (, &quot;human being, person&quot;). Here &quot;a&quot;, being primarily of grid class V, is being used as &quot;an-&quot; and could be used for &quot;al&quot;, &quot;am&quot;, &quot;ar&quot;, and so on.

In the case of clusters of two or three consonants that do not follow the initial &quot;s-&quot; and &quot;-w&quot; rule or the double consonants:  (&quot;ks&quot; or &quot;x&quot;),  (&quot;ps&quot;) and &quot;qus&quot; (which later did not exist in classical Greek), each consonant in the cluster is represented by a type CV sign that shares its consonant value: &quot;ko-no-so&quot; for &quot;Knōsos&quot;, or &quot;ku-ru-so&quot; for &quot;khrusos&quot; (, &quot;gold&quot;). The vowels of these signs have been called &quot;empty&quot;, &quot;null&quot;, &quot;extra&quot;, &quot;dead&quot; and other terms by various writers as they represent no sound. There were rules though, that governed the selection of the &quot;empty&quot; vowel and therefore determined which sign was to be used. The vowel had to be the same as the one of the first syllable following the cluster or, if at the end of the word, preceding: &quot;ti-ri-po&quot; with &quot;ti-&quot; (instead of &quot;ta-&quot;, &quot;te-&quot; and so on) to match &quot;-ri-&quot;. A rare exception occurs in words formed from &quot;wa-na-ka&quot;, &quot;wanax&quot; (ϝάναξ, Homeric and Classical ἄναξ): &quot;wa-na-ka-te&quot; for &quot;wanaktei&quot; (dative), and &quot;wa-na-ka-te-ro&quot; for &quot;wanakteros&quot;, the adjectival form. This exception may not have applied to all contexts, as an example of &quot;wa-na-ka&quot; that follows standard rules has emerged in Agios Vasileios in Laconia. The text reads &quot;wa-na-ko-to&quot; (genitive) and is written on a sealing nodule dating to the late 14th or early 13th century, slightly earlier than other Linear B texts found on mainland Greece.

=== Ideograms ===

Linear B also uses a large number of ideograms. They express:
* the type of object concerned (e.g. a cow, wool, a spear),
* a unit of measure.

They have no phonetic value and are never used as word signs in writing a sentence, unlike Japanese kanji or Hittite cuneiform. Ideograms are typically at the end of a line before a number and appear to signify to which object the number applies. Many of the values remain unknown or disputed. Some commodities such as cloth and containers are divided into many different categories represented by distinct ideograms. Livestock may be marked with respect to sex.

The numerical references for the ideograms were originally devised by Ventris and Bennett and divided into functional groups corresponding to the breakdown of Bennett&#x27;s index. The groups are numbered beginning 100, 110, 120 etc., with some provision of spare numbers for future additions; the official CIPEM numberings used today are based on Ventris and Bennett&#x27;s numbering, with the provision that three or four letter codes (written in small capitals), based on Latin words that seemed relevant at the time, are used where the meanings are known and agreed. Unicode (as of version 5.0) encodes 123 Linear B ideograms.

The ideograms are symbols, not pictures of the objects in question; for example, one tablet records a tripod with missing legs, but the ideogram used is of a tripod with three legs. In modern transcriptions of Linear B tablets, it is typically convenient to represent an ideogram by its Latin or English name or by an abbreviation of the Latin name. Ventris and Chadwick generally used English; Bennett, Latin. Neither the English nor the Latin can be relied upon as an accurate name of the object; in fact, the identification of some of the more obscure objects is a matter of exegesis.

=== Corpus ===
Inscriptions in Linear B have been found on tablets, stirrup jars and other objects; they are catalogued and classified by, inter alia, the location of the excavation they were found in.

Another 170 inscriptions in Linear B have been found on various vessels, for a total of some 6,058 known inscriptions. The primary source of vessel markings are on Inscribed Stirrup Jars, with most found at Thebes, Mycenae, Tiryns, and Khania.

For several decades scholars have worked to join tablet fragments together, thus making the tablets and their information more complete while reducing their numbers as a whole.

The oldest Linear B tablets are probably those from the Room of Chariot Tablets at Knossos, and date to the latter half of the 15th century BC. The Kafkania pebble, though from an earlier context, is not genuine. The earliest inscription from the mainland is an inscribed clay tablet found at Iklaina dating to between 1400 and 1350 BC.

An amber seal incised with Linear B signs was found in 2000 by amateur archaeologists at Bernstorf near Kranzberg, southern Germany, and is of much debated authenticity.

=== Chronology ===
==== Timeline of Bronze Age eastern Mediterranean scripts ====
The Aegean is responsible for many of the early Greek language words that have to do with daily life such as words for tools and items that are seen every day. The sequence and the geographical spread of Cretan hieroglyphs, Linear A, and Linear B, the three overlapping, but distinct, writing systems on Bronze Age Crete, the Aegean islands, and mainland Greece are summarized as follows:
====Timeline of Linear B====
The main archives for Linear B are associated with these stages of Late Minoan and Helladic pottery:
Sixteen tablets found at the Megaron at Pylos are also thought to be dated to LHIIIA.

==== Controversy on the date of the Knossos tablets ====
The Knossos archive was dated by Arthur Evans to the destruction by conflagration of about 1400 BC, which would have baked and preserved the clay tablets. He dated this event to the LM II period. This view stood until Carl Blegen excavated the site of ancient Pylos in 1939 and uncovered tablets inscribed in Linear B. They were fired in the conflagration that destroyed Pylos about 1200 BC, at the end of LHIIIB. With the decipherment of Linear B by Michael Ventris in 1952, serious questions about Evans&#x27;s date began to be considered. Most notably, Blegen said that the inscribed stirrup jars, which are oil flasks with stirrup-shaped handles imported from Crete around 1200, were of the same type as those dated by Evans to the destruction of 1400. Blegen found a number of similarities between 1200 BC Pylos and 1400 BC Knossos and suggested the Knossian evidence be reexamined, as he was sure of the 1200 Pylian date.

The examination uncovered a number of difficulties. The Knossos tablets had been found at various locations in the palace. Evans had not kept exact records. Recourse was had to the day books of Evans&#x27;s assistant, Duncan Mackenzie, who had conducted the day-to-day excavations. There were discrepancies between the notes in the day books and Evans&#x27;s excavation reports. Moreover, the two men had disagreed over the location and strata of the tablets. The results of the reinvestigation were eventually published by Palmer and Boardman, &quot;On the Knossos Tablets&quot;. It contains two works, Leonard Robert Palmer&#x27;s &quot;The Find-Places of the Knossos Tablets&quot; and John Boardman&#x27;s &quot;The Date of the Knossos Tablets,&quot; representing Blegen&#x27;s and Evans&#x27;s views respectively. Consequently, the dispute was known for a time as &quot;the Palmer–Boardman dispute&quot;. There has been no generally accepted resolution to it yet.

=== Contents ===

The major cities and palaces used Linear B for records of disbursements of goods. Wool, sheep, and grain were some common items, often given to groups of religious people. A number of tablets also deal with military matters.

As is often the case with cuneiform tablets, when the buildings they were housed in were destroyed by fire many of the tablets were baked which preserved them.

== Discovery and decipherment ==

=== Ancient Greece ===
The Greeks of the historical era were unable to decipher Linear B, but its ideograms are sometimes mentioned by ancient authors. For example, Plutarch gives an account of the Spartan king Agesilaus II (r. 400–360 BC) sending a bronze tablet with &quot;many letters marvellously old, for nothing could be made of them&quot; to Egyptian priests in the hope they could understand them.

=== Arthur Evans&#x27;s classification of scripts ===
The British archaeologist Arthur Evans, keeper of the Ashmolean Museum, was presented by Greville Chester in 1886 with a sealstone from Crete engraved with a writing he took to be Mycenaean. Heinrich Schliemann had encountered signs similar to these, but had never identified the signs clearly as writing, relating in his major work on Mycenae that &quot;of combinations of signs resembling inscriptions I have hitherto only found three or four ...&quot; In 1893 Evans purchased more sealstones in Athens, verifying from the antiquarian dealers that the stones came from Crete. During the next year he noticed the script on other artefacts in the Ashmolean. In 1894 he embarked for Crete in search of the script. Soon after arrival, at Knossos he saw the sign of the double axe on an excavated wall, considering this the source of the script. Subsequently, he found more stones from the various ruins being worn by Cretan women as amulets called &quot;milk-stones&quot;, thought to encourage the production of breast milk.

Starting in 1894, Evans published his theories that the signs evidenced various phases in the development of a writing system in &quot;The Journal of Hellenic Studies&quot;, the first article being &quot;Primitive Pictographs and a Prae-Phoenician Script from Crete&quot;. In these articles Evans distinguished between &quot;pictographic writing&quot; and &quot;a linear system of writing&quot;. He did not explicitly define these terms, causing some confusion among subsequent writers concerning what he meant, but in 1898 he wrote &quot;These linear forms indeed consist of simple geometrical figures which unlike the more complicated pictorial class were little susceptible to modification,&quot; and &quot;That the linear or quasi-alphabetic signs ... were in the main ultimately derived from the rudely scratched line pictures belonging to the infancy of art can hardly be doubted.&quot;

Meanwhile, Evans began to negotiate for the land purchase of the Knossos site. He established the Cretan Exploration Fund, with only his own money at first, and by 1896 the fund had purchased one-fourth of Kephala Hill, on which the ruins were located, with first option to buy the rest. However, he could not obtain a firman excavation permit from the Ottoman government. He returned to Britain. In January 1897, the Christian population of Crete staged its final insurrection against the Ottoman Empire. The last Ottoman troops were ferried off the island by the British fleet on 5 December 1898. In that year also, Evans and his friends returned to complete purchase of the site. By this time, the Fund had other contributors as well. In 1899, the Constitution of a new Cretan Republic went into effect. Once Evans had received permission to excavate from the local authorities, excavation on the hill began on 23 March 1900.

According to Evans&#x27;s report to the British School at Athens for that year, on 5 April, the excavators discovered the first large cache ever of Linear B tablets among the remains of a wooden box in a disused terracotta bathtub. Subsequently, caches turned up at multiple locations, including the Room of the Chariot Tablets, where over 350 pieces from four boxes were found. The tablets were to long by to wide and were scored with horizontal lines over which text was written in about 70 characters. Even in this earliest excavation report, Evans could tell that &quot;a certain number of quasi-pictorial characters also occur which seem to have an ideographic or determinative meaning.&quot;

The excavation was over for that year by 2 June. Evans reported: &quot;only a comparatively small proportion of the tablets were preserved in their entirety,&quot; the causes of destruction being rainfall through the roof of the storage room, crumbling of small pieces, and being thrown away by workmen who failed to identify them. A report on 6 September to the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland began to use some of the concepts characteristic of Evans&#x27;s later thought: &quot;palace of Knossos&quot; and &quot;palace of Minos&quot;. &quot;Appletons&#x27; Cyclopædia of American Biography&quot;, 1900, notes that Evans took up Stillman&#x27;s theme that the palace was the labyrinth of mythology in which the half-bovine son of King Minos lurked. In the report, the tablets are now called a &quot;linear script&quot; as opposed to the &quot;hieroglyphic or conventionalized pictographic script&quot;. The linear script has characters that are &quot;of a free, upright, European character&quot; and &quot;seem to have been for the most part syllabic&quot;. Evans reasserts the ideographic idea: &quot;a certain number are unquestionably ideographic or determinative.&quot;

The years after 1900 were consumed by excavations at Knossos and the discovery and study by Evans of tablets, with a projected comprehensive work on Cretan scripts to be called &quot;Scripta Minoa&quot;. A year before the publication of volume I, he began to drop hints that he now believed the linear script was two scripts, to be presented in the forthcoming book.

In &quot;Scripta Minoa I&quot;, which appeared in 1909, he explained that the discovery of the Phaistos Disc in July 1908 had caused him to pull the book from the presses so that he could include the disk by permission, as it had not yet been published. On the next page he mentioned that he was also including by permission of Federico Halbherr of the Italian Mission in Crete unpublished tablets from Hagia Triada written in a linear script of &quot;Class A&quot;. To what degree if any Halbherr was responsible for Evans&#x27;s division of the &quot;linear script&quot; into &quot;Class A&quot; and &quot;Class B&quot; is not stated. The Knossos tablets were of Class B, so that Evans could have perceived Class A only in tablets from elsewhere, and so recently that he needed permission to include the examples.

Evans summarized the differences between the two scripts as &quot;type&quot; or &quot;form of script;&#x27; that is, varieties in the formation and arrangement of the characters. For example, he says &quot;the clay documents belonging to Class A show a certain approximation in their forms to those presenting the hieroglyphic inscriptions ... the system of numerals is also in some respects intermediate between that of the hieroglyphic documents and that of the linear Class B.&quot;

The first volume covered &quot;the Hieroglyphic and Primitive Linear Classes&quot; in three parts: the &quot;pre-Phoenician Scripts of Crete&quot;, the &quot;Pictorial Script&quot; and &quot;the Phaistos Disk&quot;. One or two more volumes publishing the Linear A and Linear B tablets were planned, but Evans ran out of time; the project required more than one man could bring to it. For a good many of the years left to him, he was deeply enmeshed in war and politics in the Balkans. When he did return to Knossos, completion and publication of the palace excavations took priority. His greatest work, &quot;Palace of Minos&quot;, came out in 1935. It did include scattered descriptions of tablets. He died in 1941, soon after Nazi forces invaded Crete.

The Knossos tablets had remained in the museum at Irakleion, Crete, where many of them now were missing. The unpublished second volume consisted of notes by Evans and plates and fonts created by Clarendon Press. In 1939, Carl Blegen had uncovered the Pylos Tablets; pressure was mounting to finish &quot;Scripta Minoa II.&quot; After Evans&#x27;s death, Alice Kober, assistant to John Myres and a major transcriber of the Knossos tablets, prompted Myres to come back from retirement and finish the work. Emmett L. Bennett, Jr. added more transcriptions. The second volume came out in 1952 with Evans cited as author and Myres as editor, just before the discovery that Linear B writes an early form of Greek. An impatient Ventris and Chadwick declared: &quot;Two generations of scholars had been cheated of the opportunity to work constructively on the problem.&quot;

===Early attempts===

Despite the limited source materials, during this time there were efforts to decipher the newly discovered Cretan script. Australian classicist Florence Stawell published an interpretation of the Phaistos Disc in the April 1911 issue of &quot;The Burlington Magazine&quot;. She followed this with the book &quot;A Clue to the Cretan Scripts&quot;, published in 1931. Stawell declared all three Cretan script forms to represent early Homeric Greek, and offered her attempts at translations. Also in 1931, F. G. Gordon&#x27;s &quot;Through Basque to Minoan&quot; was published by the Oxford University Press. Gordon attempted to prove a close link between the Basque language and Linear B, without lasting success.

In 1949, Bedřich Hrozný published &quot;Les Inscriptions Crétoises, Essai de déchiffrement&quot;, a proposed decipherment of the Cretan scripts. Hrozny was internationally renowned as the translator of Hittite cuneiform decades previously. His Minoan translations into academic French, though, proved to be considerably subjective, and incorrect.

From the 1930s to 1950s there was correspondence between, and papers published by, various international academic figures. These included Johannes Sundwall, K. D. Ktistopoulos, Ernst Sittig and V. I. Georgiev. None of them succeeded with decipherment, yet they added to knowledge and debate.

=== Alice Kober&#x27;s triplets ===

About the same time, Alice Kober studied Linear B and managed to construct grids, linking similar symbols in groups of threes. Kober noticed that a number of Linear B words had common roots and suffixes. This led her to believe that Linear B represented an inflected language, with nouns changing their endings depending on their case. However, some characters in the middle of the words seemed to correspond with neither a root nor a suffix. Because this effect was found in other known languages, Kober surmised that the odd characters were bridging syllables, with the beginning of the syllable belonging to the root and the end belonging to the suffix. This was a reasonable assumption, since Linear B had far too many characters to be considered alphabetic and too few to be logographic; therefore, each character should represent a syllable. Kober&#x27;s systematic approach allowed her to demonstrate the existence of three grammatical cases and identify several pairs of signs that shared vowels or consonants with one another.

Kober also showed that the two-symbol word for &#x27;total&#x27; at the end of livestock and personnel lists, had a different symbol for gender. This gender change with one letter, usually a vowel, is most frequent in Indo-European languages. Kober had rejected any speculation on the language represented, preferring painstaking cataloguing and analysis of the actual symbols, though she did believe it likely that Linear A and Linear B represented different languages.

=== Emmett L. Bennett&#x27;s transcription conventions ===

The convention for numbering the symbols still in use today was first devised by Emmett L. Bennett Jr. Working alongside fellow academic Alice Kober, by 1950 Bennett had deciphered the metrical system, based on his intensive study of Linear B tablets unearthed at Pylos. He concluded that those tablets contained exactly the same script as the Linear B found at Knossos, and he classified and assigned identification numbers to the Linear B signs as he prepared a publication on the Pylos tablets. Like Kober, Bennett was also an early proponent of the idea that Linear A and B represented different languages. His book &quot;The Pylos Tablets&quot; became a crucial resource for Michael Ventris, who later described it as &quot;a wonderful piece of work&quot;.

=== Michael Ventris&#x27; identification as Greek ===

In 1935, the British School at Athens was celebrating its fiftieth anniversary with an exhibition at Burlington House, London. Among the speakers was Arthur Evans, then 84 years old; a teenage Michael Ventris was present in the audience. In 1940, the 18-year-old Ventris had an article &quot;Introducing the Minoan Language&quot; published in the &quot;American Journal of Archaeology&quot;. After wartime service as a navigator with RAF Bomber Command, and a post-war year in Occupied Germany, he returned to civilian life, and completed qualification as an architect. Ventris continued with his interest in Linear B, corresponding with known scholars, who usually but not always replied.

Ventris and John Chadwick, a university lecturer in Ancient Greek philology, performed the bulk of the decipherment of Linear B between 1951 and 1953. At first Ventris chose his own numbering method, but later switched to Bennett&#x27;s system. His initial decipherment was achieved using Kober&#x27;s classification tables, to which he applied his own theories. Some Linear B tablets had been discovered on the Greek mainland. Noticing that certain symbol combinations appeared only on the tablets found in Crete, he conjectured that these might be names of places on the island. This proved to be correct. Working with the symbols he could decipher from this, Ventris soon unlocked much text and determined that the underlying language of Linear B was in fact Greek. This contradicted general scientific views of the time, and indeed Ventris himself had previously agreed with Evans&#x27;s hypothesis that Linear B was not Greek. Ventris&#x27;s first public announcement of his breakthrough came on 1 July 1952, on BBC Radio, with Ventris describing the language of Linear B as &quot;A difficult and archaic Greek, seeing that it&#x27;s five hundred years older than Homer, and written in a rather abbreviated form, but Greek nevertheless.&quot; Ventris&#x27; discovery was of significance in demonstrating a Greek-speaking Minoan-Mycenaean culture on Crete, and thus presenting Greek in writing centuries earlier than had been previously accepted. Chadwick, who helped Ventris develop his decipherment of the text and discover the vocabulary and grammar of Mycenaean Greek, noted:That any Linear B tablets are written in a language other than Greek still remains to be demonstrated; but that words and usages not exactly paralleled in later Greek occur is both certain and to be expected. But we must not resort to &quot;non-Greek&quot; whenever we come up against an insoluble problem.
The first edition of their book, &quot;Documents in Mycenaean Greek&quot;, was published in 1956, shortly after Ventris&#x27;s death in an automobile accident. 

The Ventris decipherment did not immediately meet with universal approval, and was initially viewed with some scepticism. Professor A. J. Beattie of Edinburgh published his doubts in the later 1950s. Saul Levin of the State University of New York considered that Linear B was partly Greek but with an earlier substrate, in his 1964 book &quot;The Linear B controversy reexamined&quot;. Nevertheless, starting from the mid-50s onward the Ventris discovery came to be viewed favourably by scholars, such as professors Carl Blegen and Sterling Dow, which along with Ventris&#x27; 1954 article, resulted to the discovery&#x27;s wide acceptance.

== Unicode ==
Linear B was added to the Unicode Standard in April 2003 with the release of version 4.0.

The Linear B Syllabary block is U+10000–U+1007F.
The Linear B Ideograms block is U+10080–U+100FF.
The Unicode block for the related Aegean Numbers is U+10100–U+1013F.

A variety of fonts encode Linear B.

<doc id="18552" wikidata="Q2102359" url="?curid=18552" title="Larousse Gastronomique">
<text>() is an encyclopedia of gastronomy first published by Éditions Larousse in Paris in 1938. The majority of the book is about French cuisine, and contains recipes for French dishes and cooking techniques. The first edition included few non-French dishes and ingredients; later editions include many more.

==Background==
The first edition (1938) was edited by Prosper Montagné, with the collaboration of Dr Alfred Gottschalk, with prefaces by each of the author-chefs Georges Auguste Escoffier and (1857–1942). Gilbert was a collaborator in the creation of this book as well as &quot;Le Guide Culinaire&quot; (1903) with Escoffier, leading to some cross-over with the two books. It caused Escoffier to note when he was asked to write the preface that he could &quot;see with my own eyes&quot;, and &quot;Montagné cannot hide from me the fact that he has used &quot;Le Guide&quot; as a basis for his new book, and certainly used numerous recipes.&quot;

The third English edition (2001), which runs to approximately 1,350 pages, has been modernized and includes additional material on other cuisines. It is also available in a concise edition (2003). A new, updated and revised edition was released in October 2009, published by Hamlyn in the UK.

<doc id="18553" wikidata="Q7742" url="?curid=18553" title="Louis XIV">
<text>LouisXIV (Louis-Dieudonné; 5 September 16381 September 1715), also known as Louis the Great () or the Sun King (), was King of France from 1643 until his death in 1715. His verified reign of 72 years and 110 days is the longest of any sovereign. An emblem of the age of absolutism in Europe, Louis XIV&#x27;s legacy includes French colonial expansion, the conclusion of the Eighty Years&#x27; War involving the Habsburgs, a controlling influence on the style of fine arts and architecture in France, including the transformation of the Palace of Versailles into a center of royal power and politics. Louis XIV&#x27;s pageantry and opulence helped define the French Baroque style of art and architecture and promoted his image as absolute ruler of France in the early modern period. 

Louis XIV began his personal rule of France in 1661 after the death of his chief minister Cardinal Mazarin. A believer in the divine right of kings, Louis XIV continued Louis XIII&#x27;s work of creating a centralized state governed from a capital. Louis XIV sought to eliminate the remnants of feudalism persisting in parts of France by compelling many members of the nobility to reside at his lavish Palace of Versailles. In doing so, he succeeded in pacifying the aristocracy, many of whom had participated in the Fronde rebellions during his minority. He consolidated a system of absolute monarchy in France that endured until the French Revolution. 

Louis XIV enforced uniformity of religion under the Catholic Church. His revocation of the Edict of Nantes abolished the rights of the Huguenot Protestant minority and subjected them to a wave of dragonnades, effectively forcing Huguenots to emigrate or convert, virtually destroying the French Protestant community.

During Louis&#x27;s long reign, France emerged as the leading European power and regularly made war. A conflict with Spain marked his entire childhood, while during his personal rule, Louis fought three major continental conflicts, each against powerful foreign alliances: the Franco-Dutch War, the Nine Years&#x27; War, and the War of the Spanish Succession. In addition, France contested shorter wars such as the War of Devolution and the War of the Reunions. Warfare defined Louis&#x27;s foreign policy, impelled by his personal ambition for glory and power: &quot;a mix of commerce, revenge, and pique&quot;. His wars strained France&#x27;s resources to the utmost, while in peacetime he concentrated on preparing for the next war. He taught his diplomats that their job was to create tactical and strategic advantages for the French military. Upon his death in 1715, LouisXIV left his great-grandson and successor, Louis XV, a powerful but war-weary kingdom, in major debt after the War of the Spanish Succession that had raged on since 1701. 

Some of his other notable achievements include the construction of the Canal du Midi, the patronage of artists, and the founding of the French Academy of Sciences.

==Early years==

LouisXIV was born on 5 September 1638 in the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, to Louis XIII and Anne of Austria. He was named Louis Dieudonné (Louis the God-given) and bore the traditional title of French heirs apparent: &quot;Dauphin&quot;. At the time of his birth, his parents had been married for 23 years. His mother had experienced four stillbirths between 1619 and 1631. Leading contemporaries thus regarded him as a divine gift and his birth a miracle of God.

Louis&#x27;s relationship with his mother was uncommonly affectionate for the time. Contemporaries and eyewitnesses claimed that the Queen would spend all her time with Louis. Both were greatly interested in food and theatre, and it is highly likely that Louis developed these interests through his close relationship with his mother. This long-lasting and loving relationship can be evidenced by excerpts in Louis&#x27;s journal entries, such as:
&quot;Nature was responsible for the first knots which tied me to my mother. But attachments formed later by shared qualities of the spirit are far more difficult to break than those formed merely by blood.&quot;
It was his mother who gave Louis his belief in the absolute and divine power of his monarchical rule.

During his childhood, he was taken care of by the governesses Françoise de Lansac and Marie-Catherine de Senecey. In 1646, Nicolas V de Villeroy became the young king&#x27;s tutor. LouisXIV became friends with Villeroy&#x27;s young children, particularly François de Villeroy, and divided his time between the Palais-Royal and the nearby Hotel de Villeroy.

==Minority and the &quot;Fronde&quot;==
===Accession===
Sensing imminent death in the spring of 1643, King Louis XIII decided to put his affairs in order for his four-year-old son LouisXIV. Not trusting the judgement of his Spanish wife Queen Anne, who would normally have become the sole regent of France, the king decreed that a regency council would rule on his son&#x27;s behalf, with Anne at its head.

Louis XIII died on 14 May 1643. On 18 May Queen Anne had her husband&#x27;s will annulled by the &quot;Parlement de Paris&quot;, a judicial body of nobles and high-ranking clergy, and she became sole regent. She exiled her husband&#x27;s ministers Chavigny and Bouthilier and appointed the Count of Brienne as her minister of foreign affairs. Anne kept the direction of religious policy strongly in hand until her son&#x27;s majority in 1661.

She appointed Cardinal Mazarin as chief minister, giving him the daily administration of policy. She continued the policies of her late husband and Cardinal Richelieu, despite their persecution of her, in order to win absolute authority in France and victory abroad for her son. Anne protected Mazarin by exiling her followers the Duke of Beaufort and Marie de Rohan, who conspired against him in 1643.

The best example of Anne&#x27;s loyalty to France was her treatment of one of Richelieu&#x27;s men, the Chancellor Pierre Séguier. Séguier had brusquely interrogated Anne in 1637 (like a &quot;common criminal&quot;, as she recalled) following the discovery that she was giving military secrets to her father in Spain, and Anne was virtually under house arrest for years. By keeping the effective Séguier in his post, Anne sacrificed her own feelings for the interests of France and her son Louis.

The Queen sought a lasting peace between Catholic nations, but only after a French victory over her native Spain. She also gave a partial Catholic orientation to French foreign policy. This was felt by the Netherlands, France&#x27;s Protestant ally, which negotiated a separate peace with Spain in 1648.

In 1648, Anne and Mazarin successfully negotiated the Peace of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Its terms ensured Dutch independence from Spain, awarded some autonomy to the various German princes of the Holy Roman Empire, and granted Sweden seats on the Imperial Diet and territories controlling the mouths of the Oder, Elbe, and Weser Rivers. France, however, profited most from the settlement. Austria, ruled by the Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand III, ceded all Habsburg lands and claims in Alsace to France and acknowledged her &quot;de facto&quot; sovereignty over the Three Bishoprics of Metz, Verdun, and Toul. Moreover, many petty German states sought French protection, eager to emancipate themselves from Habsburg domination. This anticipated the formation of the 1658 League of the Rhine, which further diminished Imperial power.

===Early acts===
As the Thirty Years&#x27; War came to an end, a civil war known as the Fronde erupted in France. It effectively checked France&#x27;s ability to exploit the Peace of Westphalia. Anne and Mazarin had largely pursued the policies of Cardinal Richelieu, augmenting the Crown&#x27;s power at the expense of the nobility and the &quot;&quot;. Anne was more concerned with internal policy than foreign affairs; she was a very proud queen who insisted on the divine rights of the King of France.

All this led her to advocate a forceful policy in all matters relating to the King&#x27;s authority, in a manner that was much more radical than the one proposed by Mazarin. The Cardinal depended totally on Anne&#x27;s support and had to use all his influence on the Queen to temper some of her radical actions. Anne imprisoned any aristocrat or member of parliament who challenged her will; her main aim was to transfer to her son an absolute authority in the matters of finance and justice. One of the leaders of the Parlement of Paris, whom she had jailed, died in prison.

The &#x27;, political heirs of the disaffected feudal aristocracy, sought to protect their traditional feudal privileges from the increasingly centralized royal government. Furthermore, they believed their traditional influence and authority was being usurped by the recently ennobled bureaucrats (the &#x27;, or &quot;nobility of the robe&quot;), who administered the kingdom and on whom the monarchy increasingly began to rely. This belief intensified the nobles&#x27; resentment.

In 1648, Anne and Mazarin attempted to tax members of the &#x27;. The members refused to comply and ordered all of the king&#x27;s earlier financial edicts burned. Buoyed by the victory of (later known as &#x27;) at the Battle of Lens, Mazarin, on Queen Anne&#x27;s insistence, arrested certain members in a show of force. The most important arrest, from Anne&#x27;s point of view, concerned Pierre Broussel, one of the most important leaders in the &quot;&quot;.

People in France were complaining about the expansion of royal authority, the high rate of taxation, and the reduction of the authority of the Parlement de Paris and other regional representative entities. Paris erupted in rioting as a result, and Anne was forced, under intense pressure, to free Broussel. Moreover, on the night of 9–10 February 1651, when Louis was twelve, a mob of angry Parisians broke into the royal palace and demanded to see their king. Led into the royal bed-chamber, they gazed upon Louis, who was feigning sleep, were appeased, and then quietly departed. The threat to the royal family prompted Anne to flee Paris with the king and his courtiers.

Shortly thereafter, the conclusion of the Peace of Westphalia allowed Condé&#x27;s army to return to aid Louis and his court. Condé&#x27;s family was close to Anne at that time, and he agreed to help her attempt to restore the king&#x27;s authority. The queen&#x27;s army, headed by Condé, attacked the rebels in Paris; the rebels were under the political control of Anne&#x27;s old friend Marie de Rohan. Beaufort, who had escaped from the prison where Anne had incarcerated him five years before, was the military leader in Paris, under the nominal control of Conti. After a few battles, a political compromise was reached; the Peace of Rueil was signed, and the court returned to Paris.

Unfortunately for Anne, her partial victory depended on Condé, who wanted to control the queen and destroy Mazarin&#x27;s influence. It was Condé&#x27;s sister who pushed him to turn against the queen. After striking a deal with her old friend Marie de Rohan, who was able to impose the nomination of as minister of justice, Anne arrested Condé, his brother Armand de Bourbon, Prince of Conti, and the husband of their sister Anne Genevieve de Bourbon, duchess of Longueville. This situation did not last long, and Mazarin&#x27;s unpopularity led to the creation of a coalition headed mainly by Marie de Rohan and the duchess of Longueville. This aristocratic coalition was strong enough to liberate the princes, exile Mazarin, and impose a condition of virtual house arrest on Queen Anne.

All these events were witnessed by Louis and largely explained his later distrust of Paris and the higher aristocracy. &quot;In one sense, Louis&#x27;s childhood came to an end with the outbreak of the Fronde. It was not only that life became insecure and unpleasant – a fate meted out to many children in all ages – but that Louis had to be taken into the confidence of his mother and Mazarin on political and military matters of which he could have no deep understanding&quot;. &quot;The family home became at times a near-prison when Paris had to be abandoned, not in carefree outings to other chateaux but in humiliating flights&quot;. The royal family was driven out of Paris twice in this manner, and at one point LouisXIV and Anne were held under virtual arrest in the royal palace in Paris. The Fronde years planted in Louis a hatred of Paris and a consequent determination to move out of the ancient capital as soon as possible, never to return.

Just as the first &#x27; (the &#x27; of 1648–1649) ended, a second one (the &#x27; of 1650–1653) began. Unlike that which preceded it, tales of sordid intrigue and half-hearted warfare characterized this second phase of upper-class insurrection. To the aristocracy, this rebellion represented a protest for the reversal of their political demotion from vassals to courtiers. It was headed by the highest-ranking French nobles, among them Louis&#x27;s uncle Gaston, Duke of Orléans and first cousin Anne Marie Louise d&#x27;Orléans, Duchess of Montpensier, known as &#x27;; Princes of the Blood such as Condé, his brother Armand de Bourbon, Prince of Conti, and their sister the Duchess of Longueville; dukes of legitimised royal descent, such as Henri, Duke of Longueville, and François, Duke of Beaufort; so-called &quot;foreign princes&quot; such as Frédéric Maurice, Duke of Bouillon, his brother Marshal Turenne, and Marie de Rohan, Duchess of Chevreuse; and scions of France&#x27;s oldest families, such as François de La Rochefoucauld.

Queen Anne played the most important role in defeating the Fronde because she wanted to transfer absolute authority to her son. In addition, most of the princes refused to deal with Mazarin, who went into exile for a number of years. The &quot;&quot; claimed to act on Louis&#x27;s behalf, and in his real interest, against his mother and Mazarin.

Queen Anne had a very close relationship with the Cardinal, and many observers believed that Mazarin became LouisXIV&#x27;s stepfather by a secret marriage to Queen Anne. However, Louis&#x27;s coming-of-age and subsequent coronation deprived them of the &#x27;″ pretext for revolt. The &#x27; thus gradually lost steam and ended in 1653, when Mazarin returned triumphantly from exile. From that time until his death, Mazarin was in charge of foreign and financial policy without the daily supervision of Anne, who was no longer regent.

During this period, Louis fell in love with Mazarin&#x27;s niece Marie Mancini, but Anne and Mazarin ended the king&#x27;s infatuation by sending Mancini away from court to be married in Italy. While Mazarin might have been tempted for a short time to marry his niece to the King of France, Queen Anne was absolutely against this; she wanted to marry her son to the daughter of her brother, Philip IV of Spain, for both dynastic and political reasons. Mazarin soon supported the Queen&#x27;s position because he knew that her support for his power and his foreign policy depended on making peace with Spain from a strong position and on the Spanish marriage. Additionally, Mazarin&#x27;s relations with Marie Mancini were not good, and he did not trust her to support his position. All of Louis&#x27;s tears and his supplications to his mother did not make her change her mind. The Spanish marriage would be very important both for its role in ending the war between France and Spain, because many of the claims and objectives of Louis&#x27;s foreign policy for the next 50 years would be based upon this marriage, and because it was through this marriage that the Spanish throne would ultimately be delivered to the House of Bourbon.

Louis XIV was declared to have reached the age of majority on the 7th of September 1651. On the death of Mazarin, in March 1661, Louis personally took the reins of government and astonished his court by declaring that he would rule without a chief minister: &quot;Up to this moment I have been pleased to entrust the government of my affairs to the late Cardinal. It is now time that I govern them myself. You [secretaries and ministers] will assist me with your counsels when I ask for them. I request and order you to seal no orders except by my command . . . I order you not to sign anything, not even a passport . . . without my command; to render account to me personally each day and to favor no one&quot;. Capitalizing on the widespread public yearning for peace and order after decades of foreign and civil strife, the young king consolidated central political authority at the expense of the feudal aristocracy. Praising his ability to choose and encourage men of talent, the historian Chateaubriand noted: &quot;it is the voice of genius of all kinds which sounds from the tomb of Louis&quot;.

Louis began his personal reign with administrative and fiscal reforms. In 1661, the treasury verged on bankruptcy. To rectify the situation, Louis chose Jean-Baptiste Colbert as Controller-General of Finances in 1665. However, Louis first had to neutralize Nicolas Fouquet, the powerful Superintendent of Finances. Although Fouquet&#x27;s financial indiscretions were not very different from Mazarin&#x27;s before him or Colbert&#x27;s after him, his ambition worried Louis. He lavishly entertained the king at the opulent château of Vaux-le-Vicomte, flaunting a wealth which could hardly have accumulated except through embezzlement of government funds.

Fouquet appeared eager to succeed Mazarin and Richelieu in power, and he indiscreetly purchased and privately fortified the remote island of Belle Île. These acts sealed his doom. Fouquet was charged with embezzlement; the &quot;Parlement&quot; found him guilty and sentenced him to exile; and finally Louis altered the sentence to life imprisonment.

Fouquet&#x27;s downfall gave Colbert a free hand to reduce the national debt through more efficient taxation. The principal taxes included the &quot;aides&quot; and &quot;douanes&quot; (both customs duties), the &quot;gabelle&quot; (salt tax), and the &quot;taille&quot; (land tax). The &quot;taille&quot; was reduced at first, and certain tax-collection contracts were auctioned instead of being sold privately to a favoured few. Financial officials were required to keep regular accounts, revising inventories and removing unauthorized exemptions: up to 1661 only 10 per cent of income from the royal domain reached the king. Reform had to overcome vested interests: the &quot;taille&quot; was collected by officers of the Crown who had purchased their post at a high price, and punishment of abuses necessarily lowered the value of the purchase. Nevertheless, Colbert achieved excellent results, with the deficit of 1661 turning into a surplus by 1666, with interest on the debt decreasing from 52 million to 24 million livres. The &quot;taille&quot; was reduced to 42 million in 1661 and 35 million in 1665, while revenue from indirect taxation progressed from 26 million to 55 million. The revenues of the royal domain were raised from 80,000 livres in 1661 to 5.5 million in 1671. In 1661, the receipts were equivalent to 26 million British pounds, of which 10 million reached the treasury. The expenditure was around 18 million pounds, leaving a deficit of 8 million. In 1667, the net receipts had risen to 20 million pounds sterling, while expenditure had fallen to 11 million, leaving a surplus of 9 million pounds.

Money was the essential support of the reorganized and enlarged army, the panoply of Versailles, and the growing civil administration. Finance had always been the weakness of the French monarchy: tax collection was costly and inefficient; direct taxes dwindled as they passed through the hands of many intermediate officials; and indirect taxes were collected by private contractors called tax farmers who made a handsome profit. The state coffers leaked at every joint.

The main weakness arose from an old bargain between the French crown and nobility: the king might raise taxes on the nation without consent if only he exempted the nobility. Only the &quot;unprivileged&quot; classes paid direct taxes, which came to mean the peasants only, as most bourgeois finagled exemptions in one way or another. The system laid the whole burden of state expenses on the backs of the poor and powerless. After 1700, with the support of Louis&#x27;s pious secret wife Madame de Maintenon, the king was persuaded to change his fiscal policy. Though willing enough to tax the nobles, Louis feared the political concessions which they would demand in return. Only towards the close of his reign under the extreme exigency of war, was he able, for the first time in French history, to impose direct taxes on the aristocracy. This was a step toward equality before the law and toward sound public finance, though it was predictably diminished by concessions and exemptions won by the insistent efforts of nobles and bourgeois.

Louis and Colbert also had wide-ranging plans to grow French commerce and trade. Colbert&#x27;s mercantilist administration established new industries and encouraged manufacturers and inventors, such as the Lyon silk manufacturers and the Gobelins tapestry manufactory. He invited manufacturers and artisans from all over Europe to France, such as Murano glassmakers, Swedish ironworkers, and Dutch shipbuilders. He aimed to decrease imports while increasing French exports, hence reducing the net outflow of precious metals from France.

Louis instituted reforms in military administration through Michel le Tellier and his son François-Michel le Tellier, successive Marquis de Louvois. They helped to curb the independent spirit of the nobility, imposing order on them at court and in the army. Gone were the days when generals protracted war at the frontiers while bickering over precedence and ignoring orders from the capital and the larger strategic picture, with the old military aristocracy (&quot;noblesse d&#x27;épée&quot;, nobility of the sword) monopolizing senior military positions and the higher ranks. Louvois modernized the army and reorganised it into a professional, disciplined, well-trained force. He was devoted to the soldiers&#x27; material well-being and morale, and even tried to direct campaigns.

===Relations with the major colonies===
Louis&#x27;s legal reforms were enacted in his numerous Great Ordinances. Prior to that, France was a patchwork of legal systems, with as many traditional legal regimes as there were provinces, and two co-existing legal systems—customary law in the north and Roman civil law in the south. The &quot;Grande Ordonnance de Procédure Civile&quot; of 1667, the &quot;Code Louis&quot;, was a comprehensive legal code imposing a uniform regulation of civil procedure throughout the kingdom. Among other things, it prescribed baptismal, marriage and death records in the state&#x27;s registers, not the church&#x27;s, and it strictly regulated the right of the &quot;Parlements&quot; to remonstrate. The &quot;Code Louis&quot; later became the basis for the Napoleonic code, which in turn inspired many modern legal codes.

One of Louis&#x27;s more infamous decrees was the &quot;Grande Ordonnance sur les Colonies&quot; of 1685, the &quot;Code Noir&quot; (black code). Although it sanctioned slavery, it attempted to humanise the practice by prohibiting the separation of families. Additionally, in the colonies, only Roman Catholics could own slaves, and these had to be baptised.

Louis ruled through a number of councils:
* Conseil d&#x27;en haut (&quot;High Council&quot;, concerning the most important matters of state)—composed of the king, the crown prince, the controller-general of finances, and the secretaries of state in charge of various departments. The members of that council were called ministers of state.
* Conseil des dépêches (&quot;Council of Messages&quot;, concerning notices and administrative reports from the provinces).
* Conseil de Conscience (&quot;Council of Conscience&quot;, concerning religious affairs and episcopal appointments).
* Conseil royal des finances (&quot;Royal Council of Finances&quot;) headed by the &quot;chef du conseil des finances&quot; (an honorary post in most cases)—this was one of the few posts in the council available to the high aristocracy.

==Early wars in the Low Countries==
===Spain===

The death of Louis&#x27;s maternal uncle King Philip IV of Spain in 1665 precipitated the War of Devolution. In 1660, Louis had married PhilipIV&#x27;s eldest daughter, Maria Theresa, as one of the provisions of the 1659 Treaty of the Pyrenees. The marriage treaty specified that Maria Theresa was to renounce all claims to Spanish territory for herself and all her descendants. Mazarin and Lionne, however, made the renunciation conditional on the full payment of a Spanish dowry of 500,000 écus. The dowry was never paid and would later play a part persuading his maternal first cousin Charles II of Spain to leave his empire to Philip, Duke of Anjou (later Philip V of Spain), the grandson of LouisXIV and Maria Theresa.

The War of Devolution did not focus on the payment of the dowry; rather, the lack of payment was what LouisXIV used as a pretext for nullifying Maria Theresa&#x27;s renunciation of her claims, allowing the land to &quot;devolve&quot; to him. In Brabant (the location of the land in dispute), children of first marriages traditionally were not disadvantaged by their parents&#x27; remarriages and still inherited property. Louis&#x27;s wife was PhilipIV&#x27;s daughter by his first marriage, while the new king of Spain, CharlesII, was his son by a subsequent marriage. Thus, Brabant allegedly &quot;devolved&quot; to Maria Theresa, justifying France to attack the Spanish Netherlands.

===Relations with the Dutch===

During the Eighty Years&#x27; War with Spain, France supported the Dutch Republic as part of a general policy of opposing Habsburg power. Johan de Witt, Dutch Grand Pensionary from 1653 to 1672, viewed this as crucial for Dutch security and a counterweight against his domestic Orangist opponents. Louis provided support in the 1665-1667 Second Anglo-Dutch War but used the opportunity to launch the War of Devolution in 1667. This captured Franche-Comté and much of the Spanish Netherlands; French expansion in this area was a direct threat to Dutch economic interests.

The Dutch opened talks with Charles II of England on a common diplomatic front against France, leading to the Triple Alliance, between England, the Dutch and Sweden. The threat of an escalation and a secret treaty to divide Spanish possessions with Emperor Leopold, the other major claimant to the throne of Spain, led Louis to relinquish many of his gains in the 1668 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.

Louis placed little reliance on his agreement with Leopold and as it was now clear French and Dutch aims were in direct conflict, he decided to first defeat the Republic, then seize the Spanish Netherlands. This required breaking up the Triple Alliance; he paid Sweden to remain neutral and signed the 1670 Secret Treaty of Dover with Charles, an Anglo-French alliance against the Dutch Republic. In May 1672, France invaded the Republic, supported by Münster and the Electorate of Cologne.

Rapid French advance led to a coup that toppled De Witt and brought William III to power. Leopold viewed French expansion into the Rhineland as an increasing threat, especially after they seized the strategic Duchy of Lorraine in 1670. The prospect of Dutch defeat led Leopold to an alliance with Brandenburg-Prussia on 23 June, followed by another with the Republic on 25th. Although Brandenburg was forced out of the war by the June 1673 Treaty of Vossem, in August an anti-French alliance was formed by the Dutch, Spain, Emperor Leopold and the Duke of Lorraine.

The French alliance was deeply unpopular in England, and only more so after the disappointing battles against Michiel de Ruyter&#x27;s fleet. CharlesII of England made peace with the Dutch in the February 1674 Treaty of Westminster. However, French armies held significant advantages over their opponents; an undivided command, talented generals like Turenne, Condé and Luxembourg and vastly superior logistics. Reforms introduced by Louvois, the Secretary of War, helped maintain large field armies that could be mobilised much more quickly, allowing them to mount offensives in early spring before their opponents were ready.

The French were nevertheless forced to retreat from most of the Dutch Republic, which deeply shocked Louis; he retreated to St Germain for a time, where no one, except a few intimates, was allowed to disturb him. French military advantages allowed them however to hold their ground in Alsace and the Spanish Netherlands while retaking Franche-Comté. By 1678, mutual exhaustion led to the Treaty of Nijmegen, which was generally settled in France&#x27;s favour and allowed Louis to intervene in the Scanian War. Despite the military defeat, his ally Sweden regained much of what it had lost under the 1679 treaties of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Fontainebleau and Lund imposed on Denmark–Norway and Brandenburg. Yet Louis&#x27;s two primary goals, the destruction of the Dutch Republic and the conquest of the Spanish Netherlands, had failed.

Louis was at the height of his power, but at the cost of uniting his opponents; this increased as he continued his expansion. In 1679, he dismissed his foreign minister Simon Arnauld, marquis de Pomponne, because he was seen as having compromised too much with the allies. Louis maintained the strength of his army, but in his next series of territorial claims avoided using military force alone. Rather, he combined it with legal pretexts in his efforts to augment the boundaries of his kingdom. Contemporary treaties were intentionally phrased ambiguously. Louis established the Chambers of Reunion to determine the full extent of his rights and obligations under those treaties.

Cities and territories, such as Luxembourg and Casale, were prized for their strategic positions on the frontier and access to important waterways. Louis also sought Strasbourg, an important strategic crossing on the left bank of the Rhine and theretofore a Free Imperial City of the Holy Roman Empire, annexing it and other territories in 1681. Although a part of Alsace, Strasbourg was not part of Habsburg-ruled Alsace and was thus not ceded to France in the Peace of Westphalia.

Following these annexations, Spain declared war, precipitating the War of the Reunions. However, the Spanish were rapidly defeated because the Emperor (distracted by the Great Turkish War) abandoned them, and the Dutch only supported them minimally. By the Truce of Ratisbon, in 1684, Spain was forced to acquiesce in the French occupation of most of the conquered territories, for 20 years.

Louis&#x27;s policy of the &quot;Réunions&quot; may have raised France to its greatest size and power during his reign, but it alienated much of Europe. This poor public opinion was compounded by French actions off the Barbary Coast and at Genoa. First, Louis had Algiers and Tripoli, two Barbary pirate strongholds, bombarded to obtain a favourable treaty and the liberation of Christian slaves. Next, in 1684, a punitive mission was launched against Genoa in retaliation for its support for Spain in previous wars. Although the Genoese submitted, and the Doge led an official mission of apology to Versailles, France gained a reputation for brutality and arrogance. European apprehension at growing French might and the realisation of the extent of the dragonnades&#x27; effect (discussed below) led many states to abandon their alliances with France. Accordingly, by the late 1680s, France became increasingly isolated in Europe.

===Non-European relations and the colonies===

French colonies multiplied in Africa, the Americas, and Asia during Louis&#x27;s reign, and French explorers made important discoveries in North America. In 1673, Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette discovered the Mississippi River. In 1682, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, followed the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico and claimed the vast Mississippi basin in Louis&#x27;s name, calling it &quot;Louisiane&quot;. French trading posts were also established in India, at Chandernagore and Pondicherry, and in the Indian Ocean at Île Bourbon. Throughout these regions, Louis and Colbert embarked on an extensive program of architecture and urbanism meant to reflect the styles of Versailles and Paris and the &#x27;gloire&#x27; of the realm.

Meanwhile, diplomatic relations were initiated with distant countries. In 1669, Suleiman Aga led an Ottoman embassy to revive the old Franco-Ottoman alliance. Then, in 1682, after the reception of the Moroccan embassy of Mohammed Tenim in France, Moulay Ismail, Sultan of Morocco, allowed French consular and commercial establishments in his country. In 1699, Louis once again received a Moroccan ambassador, Abdallah bin Aisha, and in 1715, he received a Persian embassy led by Mohammad Reza Beg.

From farther afield, Siam dispatched an embassy in 1684, reciprocated by the French magnificently the next year under Alexandre, Chevalier de Chaumont. This, in turn, was succeeded by another Siamese embassy under Kosa Pan, superbly received at Versailles in 1686. Louis then sent another embassy in 1687, under Simon de la Loubère, and French influence grew at the Siamese court, which granted Mergui as a naval base to France. However, the death of Narai, King of Ayutthaya, the execution of his pro-French minister Constantine Phaulkon, and the siege of Bangkok in 1688 ended this era of French influence.

France also attempted to participate actively in Jesuit missions to China. To break the Portuguese dominance there, Louis sent Jesuit missionaries to the court of the Kangxi Emperor in 1685: Jean de Fontaney, Joachim Bouvet, Jean-François Gerbillon, Louis Le Comte, and Claude de Visdelou. Louis also received a Chinese Jesuit, Michael Shen Fu-Tsung, at Versailles in 1684. Furthermore, Louis&#x27;s librarian and translator Arcadio Huang was Chinese.

==Height of power==

===Centralisation of power===

By the early 1680s, Louis had greatly augmented French influence in the world. Domestically, he successfully increased the influence of the crown and its authority over the church and aristocracy, thus consolidating absolute monarchy in France.

Louis initially supported traditional Gallicanism, which limited papal authority in France, and convened an Assembly of the French clergy in November 1681. Before its dissolution eight months later, the Assembly had accepted the Declaration of the Clergy of France, which increased royal authority at the expense of papal power. Without royal approval, bishops could not leave France, and appeals could not be made to the pope. Additionally, government officials could not be excommunicated for acts committed in pursuance of their duties. Although the king could not make ecclesiastical law, all papal regulations without royal assent were invalid in France. Unsurprisingly, the Pope repudiated the Declaration.

By attaching nobles to his court at Versailles, Louis achieved increased control over the French aristocracy. According to historian Philip Mansel, the king turned the palace into:
:an irresistible combination of marriage market, employment agency and entertainment capital of aristocratic Europe, boasting the best theatre, opera, music, gambling, sex and (most important) hunting.
Apartments were built to house those willing to pay court to the king. However, the pensions and privileges necessary to live in a style appropriate to their rank were only possible by waiting constantly on Louis. For this purpose, an elaborate court ritual was created wherein the king became the centre of attention and was observed throughout the day by the public. With his excellent memory, Louis could then see who attended him at court and who was absent, facilitating the subsequent distribution of favours and positions. Another tool Louis used to control his nobility was censorship, which often involved the opening of letters to discern their author&#x27;s opinion of the government and king. Moreover, by entertaining, impressing, and domesticating them with extravagant luxury and other distractions, Louis not only cultivated public opinion of him, but he also ensured the aristocracy remained under his scrutiny.

Louis&#x27;s extravagance at Versailles extended far beyond the scope of elaborate court rituals. He took delivery of an African elephant as a gift from the king of Portugal. He encouraged leading nobles to live at Versailles. This, along with the prohibition of private armies, prevented them from passing time on their own estates and in their regional power bases, from which they historically waged local wars and plotted resistance to royal authority. Louis thus compelled and seduced the old military aristocracy (the &quot;nobility of the sword&quot;) into becoming his ceremonial courtiers, further weakening their power. In their place, he raised commoners or the more recently ennobled bureaucratic aristocracy (the &quot;nobility of the robe&quot;). He judged that royal authority thrived more surely by filling high executive and administrative positions with these men because they could be more easily dismissed than nobles of ancient lineage and entrenched influence. It is believed that Louis&#x27;s policies were rooted in his experiences during the &quot;Fronde&quot;, when men of high birth readily took up the rebel cause against their king, who was actually the kinsman of some. This victory over the nobility may thus have ensured the end of major civil wars in France until the French Revolution about a century later.

===France as the pivot of warfare===
Under Louis, France was the leading European power, and most wars pivoted around its aggressiveness. No European state exceeded it in population, and no one could match its wealth, central location, and very strong professional army. It had largely avoided the devastation of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Its weaknesses included an inefficient financial system that was hard-pressed to pay for its military adventures, and the tendency of most other powers to gang up against it.

During Louis&#x27;s reign, France fought three major wars: the Franco-Dutch War, the Nine Years&#x27; War, and the War of the Spanish Succession. There were also two lesser conflicts: the War of Devolution and the War of the Reunions. The wars were very expensive but defined LouisXIV&#x27;s foreign policy, and his personality shaped his approach. Impelled &quot;by a mix of commerce, revenge, and pique&quot;, Louis sensed that war was the ideal way to enhance his glory. In peacetime, he concentrated on preparing for the next war. He taught his diplomats that their job was to create tactical and strategic advantages for the French military. By 1695, France retained much of its dominance but had lost control of the seas to England and Holland, and most countries, both Protestant and Catholic, were in alliance against it. Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban, France&#x27;s leading military strategist, warned Louis in 1689 that a hostile &quot;Alliance&quot; was too powerful at sea. He recommended that France fight back by licensing French merchant ships to privateer and seize enemy merchant ships while avoiding its navies:
:France has its declared enemies Germany and all the states that it embraces; Spain with all its dependencies in Europe, Asia, Africa and America; the Duke of Savoy [in Italy], England, Scotland, Ireland, and all their colonies in the East and West Indies; and Holland with all its possessions in the four corners of the world where it has great establishments. France has ... undeclared enemies, indirectly hostile, hostile, and envious of its greatness, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Portugal, Venice, Genoa, and part of the Swiss Confederation, all of which states secretly aid France&#x27;s enemies by the troops that they hire to them, the money they lend them and by protecting and covering their trade.

Vauban was pessimistic about France&#x27;s so-called friends and allies:
:For lukewarm, useless, or impotent friends, France has the Pope, who is indifferent; the King of England [JamesII] expelled from his country; the Grand Duke of Tuscany; the Dukes of Mantua, Modena, and Parma [all in Italy]; and the other faction of the Swiss. Some of these are sunk in the softness that comes of years of peace, the others are cool in their affections...The English and Dutch are the main pillars of the Alliance; they support it by making war against us in concert with the other powers, and they keep it going by means of the money that they pay every year to... Allies... We must therefore fall back on privateering as the method of conducting war which is most feasible, simple, cheap, and safe, and which will cost least to the state, the more so since any losses will not be felt by the King, who risks virtually nothing...It will enrich the country, train many good officers for the King, and in a short time force his enemies to sue for peace.

==Edict of Fontainebleau==

Louis decided to persecute Protestants and revoke the 1598 Edict of Nantes, which awarded Huguenots political and religious freedom. He saw the persistence of Protestantism as a disgraceful reminder of royal powerlessness. After all, the Edict was the pragmatic concession of his grandfather Henry IV to end the longstanding French Wars of Religion. An additional factor in Louis&#x27;s thinking was the prevailing contemporary European principle to assure socio-political stability, &quot;cuius regio, eius religio&quot; (&quot;whose realm, his religion&quot;), the idea that the religion of the ruler should be the religion of the realm (as originally confirmed in central Europe in the Peace of Augsburg of 1555).

Responding to petitions, Louis initially excluded Protestants from office, constrained the meeting of synods, closed churches outside of Edict-stipulated areas, banned Protestant outdoor preachers, and prohibited domestic Protestant migration. He also disallowed Protestant-Catholic intermarriages to which third parties objected, encouraged missions to the Protestants, and rewarded converts to Catholicism. This discrimination did not encounter much Protestant resistance, and a steady conversion of Protestants occurred, especially among the noble elites.

In 1681, Louis dramatically increased his persecution of Protestants. The principle of &quot;cuius regio, eius religio&quot; generally also meant that subjects who refused to convert could emigrate, but Louis banned emigration and effectively insisted that all Protestants must be converted. Secondly, following the proposal of René de Marillac and the Marquis of Louvois, he began quartering dragoons in Protestant homes. Although this was within his legal rights, the &quot;dragonnades&quot; inflicted severe financial strain on Protestants and atrocious abuse. Between 300,000 and 400,000 Huguenots converted, as this entailed financial rewards and exemption from the &quot;dragonnades&quot;.

On 15 October 1685, Louis issued the Edict of Fontainebleau, which cited the redundancy of privileges for Protestants given their scarcity after the extensive conversions. The Edict of Fontainebleau revoked the Edict of Nantes and repealed all the privileges that arose therefrom. By his edict, Louis no longer tolerated the existence of Protestant groups, pastors, or churches in France. No further churches were to be constructed, and those already existing were to be demolished. Pastors could choose either exile or secular life. Those Protestants who had resisted conversion were now to be baptised forcibly into the established church.

Historians have debated Louis&#x27;s reasons for issuing the Edict of Fontainebleau. He may have been seeking to placate Pope Innocent XI, with whom relations were tense and whose aid was necessary to determine the outcome of a succession crisis in the Electorate of Cologne. He may also have acted to upstage Emperor Leopold I and regain international prestige after the latter defeated the Turks without Louis&#x27;s help. Otherwise, he may simply have desired to end the remaining divisions in French society dating to the Wars of Religion by fulfilling his coronation oath to eradicate heresy.

Many historians have condemned the Edict of Fontainebleau as gravely harmful to France. In support, they cite the emigration of about 200,000 highly skilled Huguenots (roughly one quarter of the Protestant population, or 1% of the French population) who defied royal decrees and fled France for various Protestant states, weakening the French economy and enriching that of Protestant states. On the other hand, some historians view this as an exaggeration. They argue that most of France&#x27;s preeminent Protestant businessmen and industrialists converted to Catholicism and remained.

What is certain is that the reaction to the Edict was mixed. Even while French Catholic leaders exulted, Pope InnocentXI still argued with Louis over Gallicanism and criticized the use of violence. Protestants across Europe were horrified at the treatment of their co-religionists, but most Catholics in France applauded the move. Nonetheless, it is indisputable that Louis&#x27;s public image in most of Europe, especially in Protestant regions, was dealt a severe blow.

In the end, however, despite renewed tensions with the Camisards of south-central France at the end of his reign, Louis may have helped ensure that his successor would experience fewer instances of the religion-based disturbances that had plagued his forebears. French society would sufficiently change by the time of his descendant, Louis XVI, to welcome tolerance in the form of the 1787 Edict of Versailles, also known as the Edict of Tolerance. This restored to non-Catholics their civil rights and the freedom to worship openly. With the advent of the French Revolution in 1789, Protestants were granted equal rights with their Roman Catholic counterparts.

==Nine Years&#x27; War==
===Causes and conduct of the war===

The Nine Years&#x27; War, which lasted from 1688 to 1697, initiated a period of decline in Louis&#x27;s political and diplomatic fortunes. It arose from two events in the Rhineland. First, in 1685, the Elector Palatine Charles II died. All that remained of his immediate family was Louis&#x27;s sister-in-law, Elizabeth Charlotte. German law ostensibly barred her from succeeding to her brother&#x27;s lands and electoral dignity, but it was unclear enough for arguments in favour of Elizabeth Charlotte to have a chance of success. Conversely, the princess was demonstrably entitled to a division of the family&#x27;s personal property. Louis pressed her claims to land and chattels, hoping the latter, at least, would be given to her. Then, in 1688, Maximilian Henry of Bavaria, Archbishop of Cologne, an ally of France, died. The archbishopric had traditionally been held by the Wittelsbachs of Bavaria, but the Bavarian claimant to replace Maximilian Henry, Prince Joseph Clemens of Bavaria, was at that time not more than 17 years old and not even ordained. Louis sought instead to install his own candidate, Wilhelm Egon von Fürstenberg, to ensure the key Rhenish state remained an ally.

In light of his foreign and domestic policies during the early 1680s, which were perceived as aggressive, Louis&#x27;s actions, fostered by the succession crises of the late 1680s, created concern and alarm in much of Europe. This led to the formation of the 1686 League of Augsburg by the Holy Roman Emperor, Spain, Sweden, Saxony, and Bavaria. Their stated intention was to return France to at least the borders agreed to in the Treaty of Nijmegen. Emperor LeopoldI&#x27;s persistent refusal to convert the Truce of Ratisbon into a permanent treaty fed Louis&#x27;s fears that the Emperor would turn on France and attack the Reunions after settling his affairs in the Balkans.

Another event Louis found threatening was England&#x27;s Glorious Revolution of 1688. Although King James II was Catholic, his two Anglican daughters, Mary and Anne, ensured the English people a Protestant succession. But when JamesII&#x27;s son James Francis Edward Stuart was born, he took precedence in succession over his sisters. This seemed to herald an era of Catholic monarchs in England. Protestant lords called on the Dutch Prince William III of Orange, grandson of Charles I of England, to come to their aid. He sailed for England with troops despite Louis&#x27;s warning that France would regard it as a provocation. Witnessing numerous desertions and defections, even among those closest to him, JamesII fled England. Parliament declared the throne vacant, and offered it to James&#x27;s daughter MaryII and his son-in-law and nephew William. Vehemently anti-French, William (now WilliamIII of England) pushed his new kingdoms into war, thus transforming the League of Augsburg into the Grand Alliance. Before this happened, Louis expected William&#x27;s expedition to England to absorb his energies and those of his allies, so he dispatched troops to the Rhineland after the expiry of his ultimatum to the German princes requiring confirmation of the Truce of Ratisbon and acceptance of his demands about the succession crises. This military manoeuvre was also intended to protect his eastern provinces from Imperial invasion by depriving the enemy army of sustenance, thus explaining the preemptive scorched earth policy pursued in much of southwestern Germany (the &quot;Devastation of the Palatinate&quot;).

French armies were generally victorious throughout the war because of Imperial commitments in the Balkans, French logistical superiority, and the quality of French generals such as Condé&#x27;s famous pupil, François Henri de Montmorency-Bouteville, duc de Luxembourg. He triumphed at the Battles of Fleurus in 1690, Steenkerque in 1692, and Landen in 1693, although, the battles proved to be of little of strategic consequence, mostly due to the nature of late 17th-century warfare.

Although an attempt to restore James II failed at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, France accumulated a string of victories from Flanders in the north, Germany in the east, and Italy and Spain in the south, to the high seas and the colonies. Louis personally supervised the captures of Mons in 1691 and Namur in 1692. Luxembourg gave France the defensive line of the Sambre by capturing Charleroi in 1693. France also overran most of the Duchy of Savoy after the battles of Marsaglia and Staffarde in 1693. While naval stalemate ensued after the French victory at the Battle of Beachy Head in 1690 and the Allied victory at Barfleur-La Hougue in 1692, the Battle of Torroella in 1694 exposed Catalonia to French invasion, culminating in the capture of Barcelona. The Dutch captured Pondichéry in 1693, but a 1697 French raid on the Spanish treasure port of Cartagena, Spain, yielded a fortune of 10,000,000 livres.

In July 1695, the city of Namur, occupied for three years by the French, was besieged by an allied army led by WilliamIII. LouisXIV ordered the surprise destruction of a Flemish city to divert the attention of these troops. This led to the bombardment of Brussels, in which more than 4,000 buildings were destroyed, including the entire city centre. The strategy failed, as Namur fell three weeks later, but harmed LouisXIV&#x27;s reputation: a century later, Napoleon deemed the bombardment &quot;as barbarous as it was useless&quot;.

Peace was broached by Sweden in 1690. By 1692, both sides evidently wanted peace, and secret bilateral talks began, but to no avail. Louis tried to break up the alliance against him by dealing with individual opponents but did not achieve his aim until 1696 when the Savoyards agreed to the Treaty of Turin and switched sides. Thereafter, members of the League of Augsburg rushed to the peace table, and negotiations for a general peace began in earnest, culminating in the Peace of Ryswick of 1697.

===Peace of Ryswick===

The Peace of Ryswick ended the War of the League of Augsburg and disbanded the Grand Alliance. By manipulating their rivalries and suspicions, Louis divided his enemies and broke their power.

The treaty yielded many benefits for France. Louis secured permanent French sovereignty over all of Alsace, including Strasbourg, and established the Rhine as the Franco-German border (as it is to this day). Pondichéry and Acadia were returned to France, and Louis&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; possession of Saint-Domingue was recognised as lawful. However, he returned Catalonia and most of the Reunions.

French military superiority might have allowed him to press for more advantageous terms. Thus, his generosity to Spain with regard to Catalonia has been read as a concession to foster pro-French sentiment and may ultimately have induced King Charles II to name Louis&#x27;s grandson Philip, Duke of Anjou, heir to the Spanish throne. In exchange for financial compensation, France renounced its interests in the Electorate of Cologne and the Palatinate. Lorraine, which had been occupied by the French since 1670, was returned to its rightful Duke Leopold, albeit with a right of way to the French military. William and Mary were recognised as joint sovereigns of the British Isles, and Louis withdrew support for JamesII. The Dutch were given the right to garrison forts in the Spanish Netherlands that acted as a protective barrier against possible French aggression. Though in some respects the Treaty of Ryswick may appear a diplomatic defeat for Louis since he failed to place client rulers in control of the Palatinate or the Electorate of Cologne, he did fulfil many of the aims laid down in his 1688 ultimatum. In any case, peace in 1697 was desirable to Louis, since France was exhausted from the costs of the war.

==War of the Spanish Succession==
===Causes and build-up to the war===

By the time of the Peace of Ryswick, the Spanish succession had been a source of concern to European leaders for well over forty years. King Charles II ruled a vast empire comprising Spain, Naples, Sicily, Milan, the Spanish Netherlands, and numerous Spanish colonies. He produced no children, however, and consequently had no direct heirs.

The principal claimants to the throne of Spain belonged to the ruling families of France and Austria. The French claim derived from LouisXIV&#x27;s mother Anne of Austria (the older sister of Philip IV of Spain) and his wife Maria Theresa (PhilipIV&#x27;s eldest daughter). Based on the laws of primogeniture, France had the better claim as it originated from the eldest daughters in two generations. However, their renunciation of succession rights complicated matters. In the case of Maria Theresa, nonetheless, the renunciation was considered null and void owing to Spain&#x27;s breach of her marriage contract with Louis. In contrast, no renunciations tainted the claims of Emperor LeopoldI&#x27;s son Charles, Archduke of Austria, who was a grandson of Philip III&#x27;s youngest daughter Maria Anna. The English and Dutch feared that a French or Austrian-born Spanish king would threaten the balance of power and thus preferred the Bavarian Prince Joseph Ferdinand, a grandson of LeopoldI through his first wife Margaret Theresa of Spain (the younger daughter of PhilipIV).

In an attempt to avoid war, Louis signed the Treaty of the Hague with WilliamIII of England in 1698. This agreement divided Spain&#x27;s Italian territories between Louis&#x27;s son &quot;le Grand Dauphin&quot; and Archduke Charles, with the rest of the empire awarded to Joseph Ferdinand. WilliamIII consented to permitting the Dauphin&#x27;s new territories to become part of France when the latter succeeded to his father&#x27;s throne. The signatories, however, omitted to consult the ruler of these lands, and CharlesII was passionately opposed to the dismemberment of his empire. In 1699, he re-confirmed his 1693 will that named Joseph Ferdinand as his sole successor.

Six months later, Joseph Ferdinand died. Therefore, in 1700, Louis and WilliamIII concluded a fresh partitioning agreement, the Treaty of London. This allocated Spain, the Low Countries, and the Spanish colonies to the Archduke. The Dauphin would receive all of Spain&#x27;s Italian territories. CharlesII acknowledged that his empire could only remain undivided by bequeathing it entirely to a Frenchman or an Austrian. Under pressure from his German wife, Maria Anna of Neuburg, CharlesII named Archduke Charles as his sole heir.

===Acceptance of the will of Charles II and consequences===

On his deathbed in 1700, CharlesII of Spain unexpectedly changed his will. The clear demonstration of French military superiority for many decades before this time, the pro-French faction at the court of Spain, and even Pope Innocent XII convinced him that France was more likely to preserve his empire intact. He thus offered the entire empire to the Dauphin&#x27;s second son Philip, Duke of Anjou, provided it remained undivided. Anjou was not in the direct line of French succession, thus his accession would not cause a Franco-Spanish union. If Anjou refused, the throne would be offered to his younger brother Charles, Duke of Berry. If the Duke of Berry declined it, it would go to Archduke Charles, then to the distantly related House of Savoy if Charles declined it.

Louis was confronted with a difficult choice. He could agree to a partition of the Spanish possessions and avoid a general war, or accept CharlesII&#x27;s will and alienate much of Europe. He may initially have been inclined to abide by the partition treaties, but the Dauphin&#x27;s insistence persuaded him otherwise. Moreover, Louis&#x27;s foreign minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, marquis de Torcy, pointed out that war with the Emperor would almost certainly ensue whether Louis accepted the partition treaties or CharlesII&#x27;s will. He emphasised that, should it come to war, WilliamIII was unlikely to stand by France since he &quot;made a treaty to avoid war and did not intend to go to war to implement the treaty&quot;. Indeed, in the event of war, it might be preferable to be already in control of the disputed lands. Eventually, therefore, Louis decided to accept CharlesII&#x27;s will. Philip, Duke of Anjou, thus became PhilipV, King of Spain.

Most European rulers accepted Philip as king, some reluctantly. Depending on one&#x27;s views of the war&#x27;s inevitability, Louis acted reasonably or arrogantly. He confirmed that PhilipV retained his French rights despite his new Spanish position. Admittedly, he may only have been hypothesising a theoretical eventuality and not attempting a Franco-Spanish union. But his actions were certainly not read as disinterested. Moreover, Louis sent troops to the Spanish Netherlands to evict Dutch garrisons and secure Dutch recognition of PhilipV. In 1701, Philip transferred the &quot;asiento&quot; (the right to supply slaves to Spanish colonies) to France, as a sign of the two nations&#x27; growing connections. As tensions mounted, Louis decided to acknowledge James Stuart, the son of JamesII, as King of England, Scotland and Ireland on the latter&#x27;s death, infuriating WilliamIII. These actions enraged Britain and the Dutch Republic. With the Holy Roman Emperor and the petty German states, they formed another Grand Alliance and declared war on France in 1702. French diplomacy secured Bavaria, Portugal, and Savoy as Franco-Spanish allies.

===Commencement of fighting===
Even before war was officially declared, hostilities began with Imperial aggression in Italy. Once finally declared, the War of the Spanish Succession lasted almost until Louis&#x27;s death, at great cost to him and France.

The war began with French successes, but the talents of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, and Eugene of Savoy checked these victories and broke the myth of French invincibility. The duo allowed the Palatinate and Austria to occupy Bavaria after their victory at the Battle of Blenheim. Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria, had to flee to the Spanish Netherlands. The impact of this victory won the support of Portugal and Savoy. Later, the Battle of Ramillies delivered the Low Countries to the Allies, and the Battle of Turin forced Louis to evacuate Italy, leaving it open to Allied forces. Marlborough and Eugene met again at the Battle of Oudenarde, which enabled them to invade France.

France established contact with Francis II Rákóczi and promised support if he took up the cause of Hungarian independence.

Defeats, famine, and mounting debt greatly weakened France. Between 1693 and 1710, over two million people died in two famines, made worse as foraging armies seized food supplies from the villages. In desperation, Louis ordered a disastrous invasion of the English island of Guernsey in the autumn of 1704 with the aim of raiding their successful harvest. By the winter of 1708–09, he was willing to accept peace at nearly any cost. He agreed that the entire Spanish empire should be surrendered to Archduke Charles, and also consented to return to the frontiers of the Peace of Westphalia, giving up all the territories he had acquired over 60 years. But he could not promise that PhilipV would accept these terms, so the Allies demanded that Louis single-handedly attack his grandson to force these terms on him. If he could not achieve this within the year, the war would resume. Louis would not accept these terms.

===Turning point===
The final phases of the War of the Spanish Succession demonstrated that the Allies could not maintain Archduke Charles in Spain just as surely as France could not retain the entire Spanish inheritance for PhilipV. The Allies were definitively expelled from central Spain by the Franco-Spanish victories at the Battles of Villaviciosa and Brihuega in 1710. French forces elsewhere remained obdurate despite their defeats. The Allies suffered a Pyrrhic victory at the Battle of Malplaquet with 21,000 casualties, twice that of the French. Eventually, France recovered its military pride with the decisive victory at Denain in 1712.

French military successes near the end of the war took place against the background of a changed political situation in Austria. In 1705, Emperor LeopoldI died. His elder son and successor, Joseph I, followed him in 1711. His heir was none other than Archduke Charles, who secured control of all of his brother&#x27;s Austrian landholdings. If the Spanish empire then fell to him, it would have resurrected a domain as vast as Holy Roman Emperor Charles V&#x27;s in the 16th century. To the maritime powers of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, this would have been as undesirable as a Franco-Spanish union.

===Conclusion of peace===

As a result of the fresh British perspective on the European balance of power, Anglo-French talks began, culminating in the 1713 Peace of Utrecht between Louis, Philip V of Spain, Anne of Great Britain, and the Dutch Republic. In 1714, after losing Landau and Freiburg, the Holy Roman Emperor also made peace with France in the Treaties of Rastatt and Baden.

In the general settlement, PhilipV retained Spain and its colonies, while Austria received the Spanish Netherlands and divided Spanish Italy with Savoy. Britain kept Gibraltar and Menorca. Louis agreed to withdraw his support for James Stuart, son of JamesII and pretender to the thrones of Great Britain and Ireland, and ceded Newfoundland, Rupert&#x27;s Land, and Acadia in the Americas to Anne. Britain gained the most from the treaty, but the final terms were much more favourable to France than those being discussed in peace negotiations in 1709 and 1710. France retained Île-Saint-Jean and Île Royale, and Louis acquired a few minor European territories, such as the Principality of Orange and the Ubaye Valley, which covered transalpine passes into Italy. Thanks to Louis, his allies the Electors of Bavaria and Cologne were restored to their prewar status and returned their lands.

==Personal life==

===Marriages and children===
Louis and his wife Maria Theresa of Spain had six children from the marriage contracted for them in 1660. However, only one child, the eldest, survived to adulthood: Louis, &quot;le Grand Dauphin&quot;, known as &quot;Monseigneur&quot;. Maria Theresa died in 1683, whereupon Louis remarked that she had never caused him unease on any other occasion.

Despite evidence of affection early on in their marriage, Louis was never faithful to Maria Theresa. He took a series of mistresses, both official and unofficial. Among the better documented are Louise de La Vallière (with whom he had five children; 1661–1667), Bonne de Pons d&#x27;Heudicourt (1665), Catherine Charlotte de Gramont (1665), Françoise-Athénaïs, Marquise de Montespan (with whom he had seven children; 1667–1680), Anne de Rohan-Chabot (1669–1675), Claude de Vin des Œillets (one child born in 1676), Isabelle de Ludres (1675–1678), and Marie Angélique de Scorailles (1679–1681), who died at age 19 in childbirth. Through these liaisons, he produced numerous illegitimate children, most of whom he married to members of cadet branches of the royal family.

Louis proved relatively more faithful to his second wife, Françoise d&#x27;Aubigné, Marquise de Maintenon. He first met her through her work caring for his children by Madame de Montespan, noting the care she gave to his favourite, Louis Auguste, Duke of Maine. The king was, at first, put off by her strict religious practice, but he warmed to her through her care for his children.

When he legitimized his children by Madame de Montespan on 20 December 1673, Françoise d&#x27;Aubigné became the royal governess at Saint-Germain. As governess, she was one of very few people permitted to speak to him as an equal, without limits. It is believed that they were married secretly at Versailles on or around 10 October 1683 or January 1684. This marriage, though never announced or publicly discussed, was an open secret and lasted until his death.

===Piety and religion===

Louis was a pious and devout king who saw himself as the head and protector of the Catholic Church in France. He made his devotions daily regardless of where he was, following the liturgical calendar regularly. Under the influence of his very religious second wife, he became much stronger in the practice of his Catholic faith. This included banning opera and comedy performances during Lent.

Towards the middle and the end of his reign, the centre for the King&#x27;s religious observances was usually the Chapelle Royale at Versailles. Ostentation was a distinguishing feature of his daily Mass, annual celebrations (such as those of Holy Week), and special ceremonies. Louis established the Paris Foreign Missions Society, but his informal alliance with the Ottoman Empire was criticised for undermining Christendom.

===Patronage of the arts===

Louis generously supported the royal court of France and those who worked under him. He brought the under his patronage and became its &quot;Protector&quot;. He allowed Classical French literature to flourish by protecting such writers as Molière, Racine, and La Fontaine, whose works remain influential to this day. Louis also patronised the visual arts by funding and commissioning artists such as Charles Le Brun, Pierre Mignard, Antoine Coysevox, and Hyacinthe Rigaud, whose works became famous throughout Europe. Composers and musicians such as Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jacques Champion de Chambonnières, and François Couperin thrived. In 1661, Louis founded the Académie Royale de Danse, and in 1669, the Académie d&#x27;Opéra, important driving events in the evolution of ballet. He also attracted, supported and patronized such artists as André Charles Boulle, who revolutionised marquetry with his art of inlay, today known as &quot;Boulle work&quot;. Always on the lookout for new talent, the king launched music competitions: in 1683, Michel-Richard de Lalande thus became deputy master of the Royal Chapel, composing his &quot;Symphonies for the Soupers du Roy&quot; along with 77 large scale &quot;Grand Motets&quot;.

Over the course of four building campaigns, Louis converted a hunting lodge commissioned by LouisXIII into the spectacular Palace of Versailles. Except for the current Royal Chapel (built near the end of his reign), the palace achieved much of its current appearance after the third building campaign, which was followed by an official move of the royal court to Versailles on 6 May 1682. Versailles became a dazzling, awe-inspiring setting for state affairs and the reception of foreign dignitaries. At Versailles, the king alone commanded attention.

Several reasons have been suggested for the creation of the extravagant and stately palace, as well as the relocation of the monarchy&#x27;s seat. The memoirist Saint-Simon speculated that Louis viewed Versailles as an isolated power centre where treasonous cabals could be more readily discovered and foiled. There has also been speculation that the revolt of the &quot;Fronde&quot; caused Louis to hate Paris, which he abandoned for a country retreat, but his sponsorship of many public works in Paris, such as the establishment of a police force and of street-lighting, lend little credence to this theory. As a further example of his continued care for the capital, Louis constructed the , a military complex and home to this day for officers and soldiers rendered infirm either by injury or old age. While pharmacology was still quite rudimentary in his day, the &quot;Invalides&quot; pioneered new treatments and set new standards for hospice treatment. The conclusion of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1668 also induced Louis to demolish Paris&#x27;s northern walls in 1670 and replace them with wide tree-lined boulevards.

Louis also renovated and improved the Louvre and other royal residences. Gian Lorenzo Bernini was originally to plan additions to the Louvre; however, his plans would have meant the destruction of much of the existing structure, replacing it with an Italian summer villa in the centre of Paris. Bernini&#x27;s plans were eventually shelved in favour of the elegant Louvre Colonnade designed by three Frenchmen: Louis Le Vau, Charles Le Brun, and Claude Perrault. With the relocation of the court to Versailles, the Louvre was given over to the arts and the public.
During his visit from Rome, Bernini also executed a renowned portrait bust of the king.

==Image and depiction==

Few rulers in world history have commemorated themselves in as grand a manner as Louis. He cultivated his image as the Sun King (&quot;le Roi Soleil&quot;), the centre of the universe &quot;without equal&quot;. Louis used court ritual and the arts to validate and augment his control over France. With his support, Colbert established from the beginning of Louis&#x27;s personal reign a centralised and institutionalised system for creating and perpetuating the royal image. The King was thus portrayed largely in majesty or at war, notably against Spain. This portrayal of the monarch was to be found in numerous media of artistic expression, such as painting, sculpture, theatre, dance, music, and the almanacs that diffused royal propaganda to the population at large.

===Evolution of royal portraiture===

Over his lifetime, Louis commissioned numerous works of art to portray himself, among them over 300 formal portraits. The earliest portrayals of Louis already followed the pictorial conventions of the day in depicting the child king as the majestically royal incarnation of France. This idealisation of the monarch continued in later works, which avoided depictions of the effect of smallpox that Louis contracted in 1647. In the 1660s, Louis began to be shown as a Roman emperor, the god Apollo, or Alexander the Great, as can be seen in many works of Charles Le Brun, such as sculpture, paintings, and the decor of major monuments.

The depiction of the king in this manner focused on allegorical or mythological attributes, instead of attempting to produce a true likeness. As Louis aged, so too did the manner in which he was depicted. Nonetheless, there was still a disparity between realistic representation and the demands of royal propaganda. There is no better illustration of this than in Hyacinthe Rigaud&#x27;s frequently-reproduced &quot;Portrait of LouisXIV of 1701&quot;, in which a 63-year-old Louis appears to stand on a set of unnaturally young legs.

Rigaud&#x27;s portrait exemplified the height of royal portraiture during Louis&#x27;s reign. Although Rigaud crafted a credible likeness of Louis, the portrait was neither meant as an exercise in realism nor to explore Louis&#x27;s character. Certainly, Rigaud was concerned with detail and depicted the king&#x27;s costume with great precision, down to his shoe buckle.

However, Rigaud intended to glorify the monarchy. Rigaud&#x27;s original, now housed in the Louvre, was originally meant as a gift to Louis&#x27;s grandson, Philip V of Spain. However, Louis was so pleased with the work that he kept the original and commissioned a copy to be sent to his grandson. That became the first of many copies, both in full and half-length formats, to be made by Rigaud, often with the help of his assistants. The portrait also became a model for French royal and imperial portraiture down to the time of Charles X over a century later. In his work, Rigaud proclaims Louis&#x27;s exalted royal status through his elegant stance and haughty expression, the royal regalia and throne, rich ceremonial fleur-de-lys robes, as well as the upright column in the background, which, together with the draperies, serves to frame this image of majesty.

===Other works of art===
In addition to portraits, Louis commissioned at least 20 statues of himself in the 1680s, to stand in Paris and provincial towns as physical manifestations of his rule. He also commissioned &quot;war artists&quot; to follow him on campaigns to document his military triumphs. To remind the people of these triumphs, Louis erected permanent triumphal arches in Paris and the provinces for the first time since the decline of the Roman Empire.

Louis&#x27;s reign marked the birth and infancy of the art of medallions. Sixteenth-century rulers had often issued medals in small numbers to commemorate the major events of their reigns. Louis, however, struck more than 300 to celebrate the story of the king in bronze, that were enshrined in thousands of households throughout France.

He also used tapestries as a medium of exalting the monarchy. Tapestries could be allegorical, depicting the elements or seasons, or realist, portraying royal residences or historical events. They were among the most significant means to spread royal propaganda prior to the construction of the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles.

===Ballet===
Louis loved ballet and frequently danced in court ballets during the early half of his reign. In general, Louis was an eager dancer who performed 80 roles in 40 major ballets. This approaches the career of a professional ballet dancer.

His choices were strategic and varied. He danced four parts in three of Molière&#x27;s comédies-ballets, which are plays accompanied by music and dance. Louis played an Egyptian in &quot;Le Mariage forcé&quot; in 1664, a Moorish gentleman in &quot;Le Sicilien&quot; in 1667, and both Neptune and Apollo in &quot;Les Amants magnifiques&quot; in 1670.

He sometimes danced leading roles that were suitably royal or godlike (such as Neptune, Apollo, or the Sun). At other times, he would adopt mundane roles before appearing at the end in the lead role. It is considered that, at all times, he provided his roles with sufficient majesty and drew the limelight with his flair for dancing. For Louis, ballet may not have merely been a tool for manipulation in his propaganda machinery. The sheer number of performances he gave as well as the diversity of roles he played may serve to indicate a deeper understanding and interest in the art form.

Ballet dancing was used by Louis as a political tool to hold power over his state. He integrated ballet deeply into court social functions and fixated his nobles&#x27; attention on upholding standards in ballet dancing, effectively distracting them from political activities. In 1661, the Royal Academy of Dance was founded by Louis to further his ambition. Pierre Beauchamp, his private dance instructor, was ordered by Louis to come up with a notation system to record ballet performances, which he did with great success. His work was adopted and published by Feuillet in 1700 as &quot;Choregraphie&quot;. This major development in ballet played an important role in promoting French culture and ballet throughout Europe during Louis&#x27;s time.

Louis greatly emphasized etiquettes in ballet dancing, evidently seen in &quot;La belle danse&quot; (the French noble style). More challenging skills were required to perform this dance with movements very much resembling court behaviours, as a way to remind the nobles of the king&#x27;s absolute power and their own status. All the details and rules were compressed in five positions of the bodies codified by Beauchamp.

===Unofficial image===
Besides the official depiction and image of Louis, his subjects also followed a non-official discourse consisting mainly of clandestine publications, popular songs, and rumours that provided an alternative interpretation of Louis and his government. They often focused on the miseries arising from poor government, but also carried the hope for a better future when Louis escaped the malignant influence of his ministers and mistresses, and took the government into his own hands. On the other hand, petitions addressed either directly to Louis or to his ministers exploited the traditional imagery and language of monarchy. These varying interpretations of Louis abounded in self-contradictions that reflected the people&#x27;s amalgamation of their everyday experiences with the idea of monarchy.

==Health and death==
Despite the image of a healthy and virile king that Louis sought to project, evidence exists to suggest that his health was not very good. He had many ailments: for example, symptoms of diabetes, as confirmed in reports of suppurating periostitis in 1678, dental abscesses in 1696, along with recurring boils, fainting spells, gout, dizziness, hot flushes, and headaches.

From 1647 to 1711, the three chief physicians to the king (Antoine Vallot, Antoine d&#x27;Aquin, and Guy-Crescent Fagon) recorded all of his health problems in the &quot;Journal de Santé du Roi&quot; (&quot;Journal of the King&#x27;s Health&quot;), a daily report of his health. On 18 November 1686, Louis underwent a painful operation for an anal fistula that was performed by the surgeon Charles Felix de Tassy, who prepared a specially shaped curved scalpel for the occasion. The wound took more than two months to heal.

Louis died of gangrene at Versailles on 1 September 1715, four days before his 77th birthday, after 72 years on the throne. Enduring much pain in his last days, he finally &quot;yielded up his soul without any effort, like a candle going out&quot;, while reciting the psalm &quot;Deus, in adjutorium me festina&quot; (&quot;O Lord, make haste to help me&quot;). His body was laid to rest in Saint-Denis Basilica outside Paris. It remained there undisturbed for about 80 years until revolutionaries exhumed and destroyed all of the remains found in the Basilica. In 1848, at Nuneham House, a piece of Louis&#x27;s mummified heart, taken from his tomb and kept in a silver locket by Lord Harcourt, Archbishop of York, was shown to the Dean of Westminster, William Buckland, who ate a part of it.

Cardinal Armand Gaston Maximilien de Rohan gave Last Rites (confession, viaticum, and unction) to king LouisXIV.

===Succession===
Louis outlived most of his immediate legitimate family. His last surviving legitimate son, Louis, Dauphin of France, died in 1711 and barely a year later, the Duke of Burgundy, the eldest of the Dauphin&#x27;s three sons and then heir-apparent to Louis, also died. Burgundy&#x27;s elder son, Louis, Duke of Brittany, died a few weeks later. Thus, on his deathbed, Louis&#x27;s heir-apparent was his five-year-old great-grandson, Louis, Duke of Anjou, Burgundy&#x27;s younger son.

Louis foresaw that his successor would not yet be mature and sought to restrict the power of his nephew Philip II, Duke of Orléans, who, as his closest surviving legitimate relative in France, would probably become regent to the prospective Louis XV. Accordingly, the king created a regency council as LouisXIII had in anticipation of LouisXIV&#x27;s own minority, with some power vested in his illegitimate son Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, Duke of Maine. Orléans, however, had Louis&#x27;s will annulled by the Parlement of Paris after his death and made himself sole regent. He stripped Maine and his brother, Louis-Alexandre, Count of Toulouse, of the rank of Prince of the Blood that Louis had granted them and significantly reduced Maine&#x27;s power and privileges.

====Line of succession in 1715====
Below is the line of succession to the French throne at the time of the death of LouisXIV in 1715. LouisXIV&#x27;s only surviving legitimate grandson, PhilipV, was not included in the line of succession because he had renounced the French throne after the war of the Spanish Succession, a 14-year conflict following the death of Charles II of Spain in 1700.
* &quot;Louis XIII (1601–1643)&quot;

Further down the French line of succession in 1715 was the House of Condé, followed by the House of Conti (a cadet branch of the House of Condé). Both of these royal houses were descended in the male line from Henri II, Prince of Condé, a second cousin of French King LouisXIII (the father of LouisXIV) in the male line.

===Reputation===
According to Philippe de Courcillon&#x27;s &quot;Journal&quot;, Louis on his deathbed advised his heir with these words: Do not follow the bad example which I have set you; I have often undertaken war too lightly and have sustained it for vanity. Do not imitate me, but be a peaceful prince, and may you apply yourself principally to the alleviation of the burdens of your subjects.

Some historians point out that it was a customary demonstration of piety in those days to exaggerate one&#x27;s sins. Thus they do not place much emphasis on Louis&#x27;s deathbed declarations in assessing his accomplishments. Rather, they focus on military and diplomatic successes, such as how he placed a French prince on the Spanish throne. This, they contend, ended the threat of an aggressive Spain that historically interfered in domestic French politics. These historians also emphasise the effect of Louis&#x27;s wars in expanding France&#x27;s boundaries and creating more defensible frontiers that preserved France from invasion until the Revolution.

Arguably, Louis also applied himself indirectly to &quot;the alleviation of the burdens of [his] subjects.&quot; For example, he patronised the arts, encouraged industry, fostered trade and commerce, and sponsored the founding of an overseas empire. Moreover, the significant reduction in civil wars and aristocratic rebellions during his reign are seen by these historians as the result of Louis&#x27;s consolidation of royal authority over feudal elites. In their analysis, his early reforms centralised France and marked the birth of the modern French state. They regard the political and military victories as well as numerous cultural achievements as how Louis helped raise France to a preeminent position in Europe. Europe came to admire France for its military and cultural successes, power, and sophistication. Europeans generally began to emulate French manners, values, goods, and deportment. French became the universal language of the European elite.

Louis&#x27;s detractors have argued that his considerable foreign, military and domestic expenditure impoverished and bankrupted France. His supporters, however, distinguish the state, which was impoverished, from France, which was not. As supporting evidence, they cite the literature of the time, such as the social commentary in Montesquieu&#x27;s &quot;Persian Letters&quot;.

Alternatively, Louis&#x27;s critics attribute the social upheaval culminating in the French Revolution to his failure to reform French institutions while the monarchy was still secure. Other scholars counter that there was little reason to reform institutions that largely worked well under Louis. They also maintain that events occurring almost 80 years after his death were not reasonably foreseeable to Louis and that in any case, his successors had sufficient time to initiate reforms of their own.

Louis has often been criticised for his vanity. The memoirist Saint-Simon, who claimed that Louis slighted him, criticised him thus: There was nothing he liked so much as flattery, or, to put it more plainly, adulation; the coarser and clumsier it was, the more he relished it. For his part, Voltaire saw Louis&#x27;s vanity as the cause for his bellicosity:It is certain that he passionately wanted glory, rather than the conquests themselves. In the acquisition of Alsace and half of Flanders, and of all of Franche-Comté, what he really liked was the name he made for himself.

Nonetheless, Louis has also received praise. The anti-Bourbon Napoleon described him not only as &quot;a great king&quot;, but also as &quot;the only King of France worthy of the name&quot;. Leibniz, the German Protestant philosopher, commended him as &quot;one of the greatest kings that ever was&quot;. And Lord Acton admired him as &quot;by far the ablest man who was born in modern times on the steps of a throne&quot;. The historian and philosopher Voltaire wrote: &quot;His name can never be pronounced without respect and without summoning the image of an eternally memorable age&quot;. Voltaire&#x27;s history, &quot;The Age of Louis XIV&quot;, named Louis&#x27;s reign as not only one of the four great ages in which reason and culture flourished, but the greatest ever.

===Quotes===
Numerous quotes have been attributed to LouisXIV by legend.

The well-known &quot;I am the state&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;État, c&#x27;est moi.&quot;) was reported from at least the late 18th century. It was widely repeated but also denounced as apocryphal by the early 19th century.

He did say, &quot;Every time I appoint someone to a vacant position, I make a hundred unhappy and one ungrateful.&quot; Louis is recorded by numerous eyewitnesses as having said on his deathbed: &quot;&quot; (&quot;I depart, but the State shall always remain.&quot;)

==Arms==
==Order of Saint Louis==
On 5 April 1693, Louis also founded the Royal and Military Order of Saint Louis (), a military order of chivalry. He named it after Louis IX and intended it as a reward for outstanding officers. It is notable as the first decoration that could be granted to non-nobles and is roughly the forerunner of the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;, with which it shares the red ribbon (though the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; is awarded to military personnel and civilians alike).

=== Ancestry ===
==== Patrilineal descent ====

Louis&#x27; patriline is the line from which he is descended from father to son.

Patrilineal descent is the principle behind membership in royal houses, as it can be traced back through the generations - which means that if King Louis were to choose a historically accurate house name it would be Robertian, as all his male-line ancestors have been of that house.

Louis is a member of the House of Bourbon, a branch of the Capetian dynasty and of the Robertians.

Louis&#x27; patriline is the line from which he is descended from father to son. It follows the Bourbon kings of France, and the Counts of Paris and Worms. This line can be traced back more than 1,200 years from Robert of Hesbaye to the present day, through Kings of France &amp; Navarre, Spain and Two-Sicilies, Dukes of Parma and Grand-Dukes of Luxembourg, Princes of Orléans and Emperors of Brazil. It is one of the oldest in Europe.

This is an incomplete list of LouisXIV&#x27;s illegitimate children. He reputedly had more, but the difficulty in fully documenting all such births restricts the list only to the better-known and/or legitimised.

<text>Ludwig [[Ritter|Ritter von]] Köchel (; born Ludwig Alois Friedrich Köchel; 14 January 1800 – 3 June 1877) was an Austrian musicologist, writer, composer, botanist, and publisher. He is best known for cataloguing the works of Mozart and originating the &#x27;KV-numbers&#x27; by which they are known (&quot;KV&quot; for &quot;Köchel-Verzeichnis&quot;).

==Life==
Ludwig Alois Friedrich Köchel was born in the town of Stein, Lower Austria. He studied law in Vienna and graduated with a PhD in 1827. For fifteen years, he was tutor to the four sons of Archduke Charles of Austria. Köchel was rewarded with a knighthood and a generous financial settlement, permitting him to spend the rest of his life as a private scholar. Contemporary scientists were greatly impressed by his botanical researches in North Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, the United Kingdom, the North Cape, and Russia. In addition to botany, he was interested in geology and mineralogy, but also loved music, and was a member of the Mozarteum Salzburg. He died of cancer at age 77 in Vienna.

==Köchel catalogue==

In 1862 he published the Köchel catalogue, a chronological and thematic register of the works of Mozart. This catalogue was the first on such a scale and with such a level of scholarship behind it; it has since undergone revisions. Mozart&#x27;s works are often referred to by their KV-numbers (&quot;cf.&quot; opus number); for example, the &quot;Jupiter&quot; symphony, &quot;Symphony No. 41&quot;, KV. 551. At the same time that Köchel was writing his catalogue Otto Jahn was making a comprehensive collection of Mozart works and writing a scholarly biography of Mozart. When Jahn learned of Köchel&#x27;s work he turned over his collection to him. Köchel dedicated his catalogue to Jahn.

==Other works==
Moreover, Köchel arranged Mozart&#x27;s works into twenty-four categories, which were used by Breitkopf &amp; Härtel when they published the first complete edition of Mozart&#x27;s works from 1877 to 1910, a venture partly funded by Köchel.

He also catalogued the works of Johann Fux.

<text>The LEO (Lyons Electronic Office) was a series of early computer systems created by J. Lyons and Co. The first in the series, the LEO I, was the first computer used for commercial business applications.

The prototype LEO I was modelled closely on the Cambridge EDSAC. Its construction was overseen by Oliver Standingford, Raymond Thompson and David Caminer of J. Lyons and Co. LEO I ran its first business application in 1951. In 1954 Lyons formed LEO Computers Ltd to market LEO I and its successors LEO II and LEO III to other companies. LEO Computers eventually became part of English Electric Company (EEL), (EELM), then English Electric Computers (EEC), where the same team developed the faster LEO 360 and even faster LEO 326 models. It then passed to International Computers Limited (ICL) and ultimately Fujitsu.

LEO series computers were still in use until 1981.

== Origins and initial design ==

J. Lyons and Co. was one of the UK&#x27;s leading catering and food manufacturing companies in the first half of the 20th century. In 1947, two of its senior managers, Oliver Standingford and Raymond Thompson, were sent to the United States to look at new business methods developed during World War II. During the visit, they met Herman Goldstine who was one of the original developers of ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic computer. Standingford and Thompson saw the potential of computers to help solve the problem of administering a major business enterprise. They also learned from Goldstine that, back in the UK, Douglas Hartree and Maurice Wilkes were actually building another such machine, the pioneering EDSAC computer, at the University of Cambridge.

On their return to the UK, Standingford and Thompson visited Hartree and Wilkes in Cambridge and were favourably impressed with their technical expertise and vision. Hartree and Wilkes estimated that EDSAC was 12–18 months from completion, but said that this interval could be shortened by additional funding. Standingford and Thompson wrote a report to the Lyons&#x27; board recommending that Lyons should acquire or build a computer to meet their business needs. The board agreed that, as a first step, Lyons would provide Hartree and Wilkes with £2,500 for the EDSAC project, and would also provide them with the services of a Lyons electrical engineer, Ernest Lenaerts. EDSAC was completed and ran its first program in May 1949.

Following the successful completion of EDSAC, the Lyons board agreed to start the construction of their own machine, expanding on the EDSAC design. The LEO computer room, which took up around 2,500 square feet of floor space, was at Cadby Hall in Hammersmith.

The Lyons machine was christened Lyons Electronic Office, or LEO. On the recommendation of Wilkes, Lyons recruited John Pinkerton, a radar engineer and research student at Cambridge, as team leader for the project. Lenaerts returned to Lyons to work on the project, and Wilkes provided training for Lyons&#x27; engineer Derek Hemy, who would be responsible for writing LEO&#x27;s programs. On 15 February 1951 the computer, carrying out a simple test program, was shown to HRH Princess Elizabeth. The first business application to be run on LEO was Bakery Valuations, which computed the costs of ingredients used in bread and cakes. This was successfully run on 5 September 1951, and LEO took over Bakery Valuations calculations completely on 29–30 November 1951.

Mary Coombs was employed in 1952 as the first female programmer to work on LEO, and as such she is recognized as the first female commercial programmer.

Five files of archive material on the LEO Computer patent are held at the British Library and can be accessed through the British Library Archives catalogue.

== Design ==

LEO I&#x27;s clock speed was 500 kHz, with most instructions taking about 1.5 ms to execute. To be useful for business applications, the computer had to be able to handle a number of data streams, input and output, simultaneously. Therefore, its chief designer, John Pinkerton, designed the machine to have multiple input/output buffers. In the first instance, these were linked to fast paper tape readers and punches, fast punched card readers and punches, and a 100-line-per-minute tabulator. Later, other devices, including magnetic tape, were added. Its ultrasonic delay-line memory based on tanks of mercury, with 2K (2048) 35-bit words (i.e., 8 kilobytes), was four times as large as that of EDSAC. The systems analysis was carried out by David Caminer.

== Applications and successors ==
Lyons used LEO I initially for valuation jobs, but its role was extended to include payroll, inventory, and so on. One of its early tasks was the elaboration of daily orders, which were phoned in every afternoon by the shops and used to calculate the overnight production requirements, assembly instructions, delivery schedules, invoices, costings, and management reports. This was the first instance of an integrated management information system. The LEO project was also a pioneer in outsourcing: in 1956, Lyons started doing the payroll calculations for Ford UK and others on the LEO I machine. The success of this led to the company dedicating one of its LEO II machines to bureau services. Later, the system was used for scientific computations as well. Met Office staff used a LEO I before the Met Office bought its own computer, a Ferranti Mercury, in 1959.

In 1954, with the decision to proceed with LEO II and interest from other commercial companies, Lyons formed LEO Computers Ltd.

The first LEO III was completed in 1961; it was a solid-state machine with a 13.2 μs cycle time ferrite core memory. It was microprogrammed and was controlled by a multitasking &quot;Master program&quot; operating system, which allowed concurrent running of as many as 12 application programs.

Users of LEO computers programmed in two coding languages: Intercode, a low-level assembler type language; and CLEO (acronym: Clear Language for Expressing Orders), the COBOL equivalent.

One of the features that LEO III shared with many computers of the day was a loudspeaker connected to the central processor via a divide-by-100 circuit and an amplifier which enabled operators to tell whether a program was looping by the distinctive sound it made. Another quirk was that many intermittent faults were due to faulty connectors and could be temporarily fixed by briskly strumming the card handles.

Some LEO III machines purchased in the mid-to-late 1960s remained in commercial use at GPO Telephones, the forerunner of British Telecom, until 1981, primarily producing telephone bills. They were kept running using parts from redundant LEOs purchased by the GPO.

== Fate and legacy ==

In 1963, LEO Computers Ltd was merged into English Electric Company and this led to the breaking up of the team that had inspired LEO computers. The company continued to build the LEO III, and went on to build the faster LEO 360 and even faster LEO 326 models, which had been designed by the LEO team before the takeover.

English Electric LEO Computers (EEL) (1963), then English Electric Leo Marconi (EELM) (1964), later English Electric Computers (EEC) (1967), eventually merged with International Computers and Tabulators (ICT) and others to form International Computers Limited (ICL) in 1968. In the 1980s, there were still ICL 2900 mainframes running LEO programs, using an emulator written in ICL 2960 microcode at the Dalkeith development centre. At least one modern emulator has been developed which can run some original LEO III software on a modern server. ICL was bought by Fujitsu in 1990.

Whether its investment in LEO actually benefited J. Lyons is unclear. Nick Pelling notes that before LEO I the company already had a proven, industry-leading system using clerks that gave it &quot;near-real-time management information on more or less all aspects of its business&quot;, and that no jobs were lost when the system was computerized. In addition, LEO Computers lost money on many of its sales because of unrealistically low prices.

In 2018, the Centre for Computing History along with LEO Computers Society were awarded funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund for their project aiming to bring together, preserve, archive and digitise a range of LEO Computers artefacts, and documents. The Centre&#x27;s museum gallery has an area dedicated to LEO, and they are also working on a LEO virtual reality project. In November 2021, to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the first successful full program run on LEO I, the project released a film about the history of LEO, which went on to win Video of the Year in the Association of British Science Writers Awards in July 2022.

<doc id="18557" wikidata="Q347940" url="?curid=18557" title="Laurence of Canterbury">
<text>Laurence (died 2 February 619) was the second Archbishop of Canterbury, serving from about 604 to 619. He was a member of the Gregorian mission sent from Italy to England to Christianise the Anglo-Saxons from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism, although the date of his arrival is disputed. He was consecrated archbishop by his predecessor, Augustine of Canterbury, during Augustine&#x27;s lifetime, to ensure continuity in the office. While archbishop, he attempted unsuccessfully to resolve differences with the native British bishops by corresponding with them about points of dispute. Laurence faced a crisis following the death of King Æthelberht of Kent, when the king&#x27;s successor abandoned Christianity; he eventually reconverted. Laurence was revered as a saint after his death in 619.

==Early life==
Laurence was part of the Gregorian mission originally dispatched from Rome in 595 to convert the Anglo-Saxons from their native paganism to Christianity; he landed at Thanet, Kent, with Augustine in 597, or, as some sources state, first arrived in 601 and was not a part of the first group of missionaries. He had been a monk in Rome before his travels to England, but nothing else is known of his history or background. The medieval chronicler Bede says that Augustine sent Laurence back to Pope Gregory I to report on the success of converting King Æthelberht of Kent and to carry a letter with questions for the pope. Accompanied by Peter of Canterbury, another missionary, he set off sometime after July 598, and returned by June 601. He brought back with him Gregory&#x27;s replies to Augustine&#x27;s questions, a document commonly known as the &quot;Libellus responsionum&quot;, that Bede incorporated in his &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot;. Laurence is probably the Laurence referred to in the letter from Gregory to Bertha, queen of Kent. In that letter, Gregory praises Bertha for her part in the conversion of her husband, details of which Gregory says he received from Laurence the priest. It is known that Laurence returned to England with Mellitus and others of the second group of missionaries in the summer of 601, but there is no record of Peter being with them.

==Archbishop==

Laurence succeeded Augustine to the see of Canterbury in about 604, and ruled until his death on 2 February 619. To secure the succession, Augustine had consecrated Laurence before he died, even though that was prohibited by canon law. Augustine was afraid though that if someone did not step into the office immediately, it would damage the missionary efforts in Britain. However, Laurence never received a pallium from Rome, so he may have been considered uncanonical by the papacy. Bede makes a point of comparing Augustine&#x27;s action in consecrating Laurence to Saint Peter&#x27;s action of consecrating Clement as Bishop of Rome during Peter&#x27;s lifetime, which the theologian J. Robert Wright believes may be Bede&#x27;s way of criticising the practices of the church in his day.

In 610 Laurence received letters from Pope Boniface IV, addressed to him as archbishop and Augustine&#x27;s successor. The correspondence was in response to Laurence having sent Mellitus to Rome earlier in 610, to solicit advice from the papacy on matters concerning the English Church. While in Rome Mellitus attended a synod and brought the synodical decrees back with him to Laurence.

In 613 Laurence consecrated the monastery church built by Augustine in Canterbury, and dedicated it to saints Peter and Paul; it was later re-consecrated as St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey, Canterbury. Laurence also wrote to the bishops in the lands held by the Scots and by the Britons, urging them to hold Easter on the day that the Roman church celebrated it, instead of their traditional date, as part of the Easter controversy. The letter is also preserved in Bede&#x27;s history. Laurence in 609 stated that Dagan, a native bishop, would not eat with Laurence or share a roof with the archbishop, due to the differences between the two Churches.

==Pagan reaction==

Æthelberht died in 616, during Laurence&#x27;s tenure; his son Eadbald abandoned Christianity in favour of Anglo-Saxon paganism, forcing many of the Gregorian missionaries to flee the pagan backlash that followed Æthelberht&#x27;s death. Among them in Gaul were Mellitus, who was Bishop of London, and Justus, who was Bishop of Rochester. Remaining in Britain, Laurence succeeded in reconverting Eadbald to Christianity. Bede relates the story that Laurence had been prepared to give up when he was visited by St Peter in a dream or vision. St Peter chastised Laurence and whipped him, and the marks of the whipping remained after the vision or dream ended. Laurence then displayed them to Eadbald, and the king was converted on the spot. Bede, however, hints that it was the death of some of the leaders of the pagan party in battle that really persuaded Laurence to stay. According to Benedicta Ward, a historian of Christianity, Bede uses the story of the whipping as an example of how suffering was a reminder of Christ&#x27;s suffering for humans, and how that example could lead to conversion. Wright argues that another point Bede is making is that it is because of the intercession of St Peter himself that the mission continued. David Farmer, in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Saints&quot;, suggests that the whipping story may have been a blending of the &quot;Quo vadis&quot; story with some information given by Jerome in a letter.

Modern historians have seen political overtones in the pagan reaction. The historian D. P. Kirby sees Eadbald&#x27;s actions as a repudiation of his father&#x27;s pro-Frankish policies. Alcuin, a later medieval writer, wrote that Laurence was &quot;censured by apostolic authority&quot;. This may have been a letter from Pope Adeodatus I, commanding Laurence to stay in Kent. Kirby goes on to argue that it was Justus, not Laurence, who converted Eadbald, and this while Justus was archbishop, sometime around 624. Not all historians agree with this argument, however. Nicholas Brooks states that the king was converted during Laurence&#x27;s archiepiscopate, within a year of him succeeding his father. The historian Barbara Yorke argues that there were two co-rulers of Kent after Æthelberht&#x27;s death, Eadbald and a Æthelwald, and that Eadbald was converted by Laurence while Æthelwald was converted by Justus after his return to Rochester. Another factor in the pagan reaction was Laurence&#x27;s objection to Eadbald&#x27;s marriage to his father&#x27;s widow, something that Christians considered to be unlawful.

All efforts to extend the church beyond Kent encountered difficulties due to the attitude of King Rædwald of East Anglia, who had become the leading king in the south after Æthelberht&#x27;s death. Rædwald was converted before the death of Æthelberht, perhaps at the urging of Æthelberht, but his kingdom was not, and Rædwald seems to have converted only to the extent of placing a Christian altar in his pagan temple. It proved impossible for Mellitus to return to London as bishop, although Justus did resume his duties at Rochester.

==Death and legacy==

Laurence died on 2 February 619, and was buried in the abbey of St Peter and Paul in Canterbury, later renamed St Augustine&#x27;s; his relics, or remains, were moved, or translated, to the new church of St Augustine&#x27;s in 1091. His shrine was in the axial chapel of the abbey church, flanking the shrine of Augustine, his predecessor. Laurence came to be regarded as a saint, and was given the feast day of 3 February. The ninth century Stowe Missal commemorates his feast day, along with Mellitus and Justus. A &quot;Vita&quot; (or &quot;Life&quot;) was written about the time of his translation, by Goscelin, but it is mainly based on information in Bede. His tomb was opened in 1915. Besides his feast day, the date of his translation, 13 September, was also celebrated after his death. Laurence&#x27;s tenure as archbishop is mainly remembered for his failure to secure a settlement with the Celtic church and for his reconversion of Eadbald following Æthelbert&#x27;s death. He was succeeded as archbishop by Mellitus, the Bishop of London.

<text>&quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot; is a short story written by J. R. R. Tolkien in 1938–39 and first published in the &quot;Dublin Review&quot; in January 1945. It was reprinted in Tolkien&#x27;s book &quot;Tree and Leaf&quot;, and in several later collections. Contrary to Tolkien&#x27;s claim that he despised allegory in any form, the story is an allegory of Tolkien&#x27;s own creative process, and, to an extent, of his own life, following the structure of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Purgatorio&quot;. It also expresses his philosophy of divine creation and human sub-creation. The story came to him in a dream.

== Context ==

J. R. R. Tolkien was a scholar of English literature, a philologist and medievalist interested in language and poetry from the Middle Ages, especially that of Anglo-Saxon England and Northern Europe. His professional knowledge of works such as &quot;Beowulf&quot; shaped his fictional world of Middle-earth, including his high fantasy novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

== Plot summary ==

In this story, an artist named Niggle lives in a society that does not value art. Working only to please himself, he paints a canvas of a great tree with a forest in the distance. He invests each and every leaf of his tree with obsessive attention to detail, making every leaf uniquely beautiful. Niggle ends up discarding all his other artworks, or tacks them onto the main canvas, which becomes a single vast embodiment of his vision.

However, mundane duties constantly prevent Niggle from giving his work the attention it deserves, so it remains incomplete and is not fully realised. At the back of his head, Niggle knows that he has a great trip looming, and he must prepare for it, but Niggle&#x27;s next door neighbour, a gardener named Parish, frequently drops by asking for assistance. Parish is lame, has a sick wife, and genuinely needs help. Niggle, having a good heart, takes time out to help—but he is also reluctant because he would rather work on his painting. Niggle has other pressing work duties as well that require his attention. Then Niggle himself catches a chill doing errands for Parish in the rain.

Eventually, Niggle is forced to take his trip, and cannot get out of it. He has not prepared, and as a result the trip goes wrong, and he ends up in a kind of institution, in which he must perform menial labour each day. Back at the home to which he cannot return, Niggle&#x27;s painting is abandoned, used to patch a damaged roof, and all but destroyed (except for the one perfect leaf of the story&#x27;s title, which is placed in the local museum).

In time, Niggle is paroled from the institution, and he is sent to a place &quot;for a little gentle treatment&quot;. He discovers that this new place is the country of the tree and forest of his great painting. This place is the true realisation of his vision, not the flawed and incomplete version in his painting.

Niggle is reunited with his old neighbour, Parish, who now proves his worth as a gardener, and together they make the tree and forest even more beautiful. Finally, Niggle journeys farther and deeper into the Forest, and beyond into the great mountains that he only faintly glimpsed in his painting.

Long after both Niggle and Parish have taken their journeys, the place that they created together becomes a destination for many travellers to visit before their final voyage into the mountains, and it earns the name &quot;Niggle&#x27;s Parish&quot;.

== Publication history ==

&quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot; was first published in the &quot;Dublin Review&quot; in 1945. It first appeared in a book in 1964 alongside &quot;On Fairy-Stories&quot; in &quot;Tree and Leaf&quot;. It has been republished in the collections &quot;The Tolkien Reader&quot; (1966), &quot;Poems &amp; Stories&quot; (1980), &quot;A Tolkien Miscellany&quot; (2002), and &quot;Tales from the Perilous Realm&quot; (2021).

== Analysis ==

=== Allegory ===

Tolkien made the general statement &quot;I dislike allegory&quot; in one of his letters, but in specific references to &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot;, he wrote that &quot;It is not really or properly an &#x27;allegory&#x27; so much as &#x27;mythical&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;I tried to show allegorically how might come to be taken up into Creation in some plane in my &#x27;purgatorial&#x27; story &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot;.&quot;

==== Of the journey of death ====

The Tolkien scholar and fellow-philologist Tom Shippey states categorically that the story is &quot;quite certainly&quot; an allegory, and that its first words recall &quot;to any Anglo-Saxonist&quot; the opening lines of the Old Northumbrian poem &quot;Bede&#x27;s Death Song&quot;. Those lines, he states, equate death to a journey, hinting to the reader to continue making such &quot;equations&quot; of things in the world to elements of the story; and further, that the reader of the story is meant to interpret the story in this way, every tiny detail exactly and entertainingly fitting the pattern.

A religious reading could lead to the conclusion that the allegory of &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot; is life, death, purgatory and paradise. Niggle is not prepared for his unavoidable trip, as humans often are not prepared for death. His time in the institution and subsequent discovery of his Tree represent purgatory and heaven; Sebastian Knowles writes that the story &quot;follows Dante&#x27;s &#x27;Purgatorio&#x27; in its general structure and in its smallest detail.&quot;

Michael Milburn argues that Charles Williams&#x27;s view of Dante as romantic theology – which Milburn glosses as the serious theology of romantic experiences, including romantic love – can be applied to Tolkien&#x27;s story. Dante, he writes, has a &quot;glorious vision&quot; of Beatrice that is &quot;as real&quot; as the actual Beatrice. She dies, leaving Dante with the inspiration to &quot;&quot;be&quot; love&quot;, to stay faithful to his vision of her. This can be applied to art with &quot;a source text that not only takes art for its subject but locates the vision of great art in the afterlife with Beatrice, includes an experience analogous to the death of Beatrice, and explores the relationship between artistic beauty and &quot;caritas&quot;. Milburn states that Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot; is just such a text, because Niggle&#x27;s allegorical &quot;journey&quot; signifies death, the &quot;Workhouse&quot; signifies purgatory, and the place Niggle reaches after that is the Earthly Paradise, the place for Tolkien as for Dante of final purification before heaven, Niggle&#x27;s &quot;mountains&quot;. Tolkien had met Williams, as they were both members of the Inklings literary group. Further, Milburn notes, Tolkien, despite denying that Williams had been an influence, wrote a poem about him, in which he praises William&#x27;s understanding of Dante, his romantic theology: &quot;But heavenly footsteps, too, can Williams trace, / and after Dante, plunging, soaring, race / up to the threshold of Eternal Grace&quot;.

==== Of Tolkien&#x27;s life ====

An autobiographical interpretation places Tolkien himself as Niggle—in mundane matters as well as spiritual ones. Tolkien was compulsive in his writing, his endless revisions, his desire for perfection in form and in the &quot;reality&quot; of his invented world, its languages, its chronologies, its existence. Like Niggle, Tolkien came to abandon other projects or graft them onto his &quot;Tree&quot;, Middle-earth. Like Niggle, Tolkien faced many chores and duties that kept him from the work he loved; and like Niggle, Tolkien was a confirmed procrastinator. Shippey comments that whereas Tolkien had once felt that one could return to Faërie in some way, later in his life he came to doubt that he would &quot;[rejoin] his own creations after death, like Niggle; he felt they were lost, like the Silmarils.&quot; He adds that when Tolkien presents images of himself in his writings, as with Niggle and Smith, there is &quot;a persistent streak of alienation&quot;. Shippey lists several elements of the allegory in &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot;.

==== Of creation and sub-creation ====

&quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot; can be interpreted, too, as an illustration of Tolkien&#x27;s religious philosophy of creation and sub-creation. In this philosophy, true creation is the exclusive province of God, and those who aspire to creation can only make echoes (good) or mockeries (evil) of truth. The sub-creation of works that echo the true creations of God is one way that mortals honour God. This philosophy is evident in Tolkien&#x27;s other works, especially &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;—one Vala, Morgoth, creates the Orc race as a foul mockery of the Elves. Another Vala, Aulë, creates the Dwarf race as an act of subcreation that honoured Eru Ilúvatar (the analogue of God in Tolkien&#x27;s writings), and which Eru accepted and made real, just as Niggle&#x27;s Tree was made real. Niggle&#x27;s yearnings after truth and beauty (God&#x27;s creations) are echoed in his great painting. After death, Niggle is rewarded with the realisation (the making-real) of his yearning; or, alternatively, Niggle&#x27;s Tree always existed and he simply echoed it in his art. From a metanarrative viewpoint, Tolkien&#x27;s Arda is itself a subcreation designed to honour the true stories of the real world. Thus, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, despite its lack of overt religious elements, can be interpreted as a profoundly religious work.

=== Surrealistic dream memory ===

Michael Organ, writing in the &quot;Journal of Tolkien Research&quot;, notes that Tolkien stated in a letter that the story came to him one morning in 1939, shortly before the start of the Second World War, when he woke up with the story, which he called &quot;that odd thing&quot;, in his mind &quot;virtually&quot; complete. Tolkien stated in another letter that he then wrote it out &quot;almost in a sitting and very nearly in the form in which it now appears&quot;, commenting that looking back at the story, he thought it &quot;arose&quot; from a combination of his love of trees and his concern that &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; would never be finished. Organ describes the birth of &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot; as &quot;a frenzy of activity&quot; resembling the automatic writing &quot;popularised by proponents of Dada and Surrealism&quot; in the early 20th century. He notes, too, that Tolkien knew that dreams had an irrational side, and had commented that it was &quot;exceptional&quot; for fantasy to appear in dreams, as &quot;Fantasy is a rational, not an irrational, activity&quot;. Organ comments that Tolkien may have resisted &quot;what he saw as the morbidity of surrealism&quot; in connection with his story, precisely because &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot;&#x27;s message is so positive.

=== Visual imagery ===

Jeffrey MacLeod and Anna Smol write in &quot;Mythlore&quot; that while Tolkien defines sub-creation &quot;in linguistic terms&quot;, he often links such verbal creation to visual images. For instance, in his poem &quot;Mythopoeia&quot;, he mentions &quot;script and limning packed of various hue&quot;, which they gloss as &quot;writing and drawing, alphabet and image, the linguistic and the visual ... side by side.&quot; Similarly, they comment, in &quot;Leaf by Niggle&quot;, the allegory uses the image of a painter. In his own life, Tolkien combined the writing of fiction with his artwork, while he defined imagination visually as the &quot;mental power of image-making&quot;.

<text>Leet (or &quot;1337&quot;), also known as eleet or leetspeak, or simply hacker speech, is a system of modified spellings used primarily on the Internet. It often uses character replacements in ways that play on the similarity of their glyphs via reflection or other resemblance. Additionally, it modifies certain words on the basis of a system of suffixes and alternative meanings. There are many dialects or linguistic varieties in different online communities.

The term &quot;leet&quot; is derived from the word &quot;elite&quot;, used as an adjective to describe skill or accomplishment, especially in the fields of online gaming and computer hacking. The leet lexicon includes spellings of the word as &quot;1337&quot; or &quot;leet&quot;.

==History==
Leet originated within bulletin board systems (BBS) in the 1980s, where having &quot;elite&quot; status on a BBS allowed a user access to file folders, games, and special chat rooms. The Cult of the Dead Cow hacker collective has been credited with the original coining of the term, in their text-files of that era. One theory is that it was developed to defeat text filters created by BBS or Internet Relay Chat system operators for message boards to discourage the discussion of forbidden topics, like cracking and hacking. Creative misspellings and ASCII-art-derived words were also a way to attempt to indicate one was knowledgeable about the culture of computer users. 

Once reserved for hackers, crackers, and script kiddies, leet later entered the mainstream. Some consider emoticons and ASCII art, like smiley faces, to be leet, while others maintain that leet consists of only symbolic word obfuscation. More obscure forms of leet, involving the use of symbol combinations and almost no letters or numbers, continue to be used for its original purpose of obfuscated communication. It is also sometimes used as a scripting language. Variants of leet have been used to evade censorship for many years; for instance &quot;@$$&quot; (ass) and &quot;$#!+&quot; (shit) are frequently seen to make a word appear censored to the untrained eye but obvious to a person familiar with leet. This enables coders and programmers especially to circumvent filters and speak about topics that would usually get banned. &quot;Hacker&quot; would end up as &quot;H4x0r&quot;, for example.

Leet symbols, especially the number 1337, are Internet memes that have spilled over into some culture. Signs that show the numbers &quot;1337&quot; are popular motifs for pictures and are shared widely across the Internet.

=== Algospeak ===

Algospeak shares conceptual similarities with leet, albeit with its primary purpose to circumvent algorithmic censorship online, &quot;algospeak&quot; deriving from &quot;algo&quot; of &quot;algorithm&quot; and &quot;speak&quot;. These are euphemisms that aim to evade automated online moderation techniques, especially those that are considered unfair or hindering free speech. One prominent example is using the term &quot;unalive&quot; as opposed to the verb &quot;kill&quot; or even &quot;suicide&quot;. Other examples include using &quot;restarted&quot; or &quot;regarded&quot; instead of &quot;retarded&quot; and &quot;seggs&quot; in place of &quot;sex&quot;. These phrases are easily understandable to humans, providing either the same general meaning, pronunciation, or shape of the original word. It is furthermore often employed as a more contemporary alternative to leet. The approach has gained more popularity in 2023 and 2024 due to the rise in conflict between Israel and Gaza with the topic&#x27;s contentious nature on the Internet, especially on Meta and TikTok platforms.

==Orthography==
One of the hallmarks of leet is its unique approach to orthography, using substitutions of other letters, or indeed of characters other than letters, to represent letters in a word. For more casual use of leet, the primary strategy is to use quasi-homoglyphs, symbols that closely resemble (to varying degrees) the letters for which they stand. 

The choice of symbol is not fixed: anything the reader can make sense of is valid in leet-speak. Sometimes, a gamer would work around a nickname being already taken (and maybe abandoned as well) by replacing a letter with a similar-looking digit.

* However, leet is also seen in situations where the argot (e.g. secret language) characteristics of the system are required, either to exclude newbies or outsiders in general, i.e., anything that the &quot;average&quot; reader &quot;cannot&quot; make sense of is valid; a valid reader should themselves try to make sense, if deserving of the underlying message.
* Mild leet can be used to mess with frequency analysis &quot;as is&quot;.

Another use for leet orthographic substitutions is the creation of paraphrased passwords. Limitations imposed by websites on password length (usually no more than 36) and the characters permitted (e.g. alphanumeric and symbols) require less extensive forms when used in this application.

Some examples of leet include:
* &quot;B1ff&quot;.
* &quot;n00b&quot; -- a term for &quot;noob&quot;, the stereotypical newbie.
* The l33t programming language.
* &quot;E5C4P3&quot;: stylized cover of Journey&#x27;s Escape album.
* &quot;k3w1&quot; deciphers as &quot;kewl&quot; (which is derived from &quot;cool&quot;).
* The web-comics &quot;Megatokyo&quot; and &quot;Homestuck&quot;, which contain characters who speak variations of leet.
* The digit &quot;5&quot; in Deadmau5 nickname.
* Upside-down &quot;1337&quot; (with a bar under &quot;1&quot;) also reads as &quot;LEET&quot; (see example on the photo).
* &quot;DEF 4L7&quot; plates are used by Defalt (&quot;sic!&quot;), a hacker from the Watch Dogs videogame (the first in the series). 
* &quot;1 (4/\/&quot;7 |_|/\/[)3|2574/\/[) &#x27;/0|_||2 \/\/|2171/\/9.17’5 (0/\/|=|_|51/\/9&quot; is heavily leet-styled &quot;I can’t understand your writing. It’s confusing&quot;.
* Sometimes, a word can be typed in leet with digits only:
** &quot;360&quot; codes word &quot;EGO&quot; in leet.
** &quot;1687&quot; or &quot;1987&quot; can be used to hint to IGBTs, e.g. insulated-gate bipolar transistors.
** &quot;2007 2008&quot; deciphers as &quot;qoot qoob&quot; (which is derived from &quot;cute cube&quot;).
** &quot;2077&quot; (as a hint to Cyberpunk 2077) can be jokingly used towards &quot;ZOTT&quot; dairy brand;
** &quot;11363015&quot; means &quot;LIEGEOIS&quot;, e.g. Liège. 
** &quot;12314734813&quot; happens to cover &quot;RELATEABLE&quot; word.
** &quot;137 17 83 137 17 60&quot; hides &quot;let it be, let it go&quot; phrase
** &quot;4150&quot; may stand for &quot;ALSO&quot;
** &quot;33571 - 18124&quot; unravels as &quot;Eesti - Ibiza&quot;.
* Alternatively, sometimes 3 or 6 letters can be leet-ified into a valid hexadecimal color code:
** █ &quot;614D05&quot; is a valid HEX-code for a dark shade of gold color, referencing GLaDOS;
** █ &quot;572E55&quot; (or █ &quot;572355&quot;) is a dark purple color, coming from the word &quot;STRESS&quot;;
** █ &quot;1C373A&quot; is a dark cyan (&quot;icy&quot;) color, derived from &quot;ICE TEA&quot;;
** █ &quot;C47C47&quot; is a peach-orange color related to cats;
** █ &quot;C01025&quot; is a pink-ish shade of red, derived from the word &quot;COLORS&quot;;
** █ &quot;D35327&quot; is a dark orange color, produced from &quot;DESERT&quot; word.
** █ &quot;80771E&quot; is a yellowish-orange color, produced from &quot;BOTTLE&quot; word.
** █ &quot;B00B15&quot; is a redish color, derived from the misspelled &quot;BOOBIES&quot; word.

* Spelling given names in Leet in a way the output would reference to something is also possible. 
** For example, the female name &quot;Marisa&quot; can be spelled as /\/\AR15/\ - with a reference to the AR-15 platform. 
** 834-613 means BEA-GLE all while also referencing to the Beagle Boys and their 6-digit IDs in particular.
** VA-11 HALL-A reads as modified &quot;Valhalla&quot;.

However, leetspeak should not be confused with SMS-speak, characterized by using &quot;4&quot; as &quot;for&quot;, &quot;2&quot; as &quot;to&quot;, &quot;b&amp;&quot; as &quot;ban&#x27;d&quot; (e.g. &quot;banned&quot;), &quot;gr8 b8, m8, appreci8, no h8&quot; as &quot;great bait, mate, appreciate, no hate&quot;, and so on.

==Morphology==

Text rendered in leet is often characterized by distinctive, recurring forms.
;&quot;-xor&quot; suffix
:The meaning of this suffix is parallel with the English &quot;-er&quot; and &quot;-or&quot; suffixes (seen in &quot;hacker&quot; and &quot;lesser&quot;) in that it derives agent nouns from a verb stem. It is realized in two different forms: &quot;-xor&quot; and &quot;-zor&quot;, and , respectively. For example, the first may be seen in the word &quot;hax(x)or&quot; (&quot;H4x0r&quot; in leet) and the second in &quot;pwnzor&quot; . Additionally, this nominalization may also be inflected with all of the suffixes of regular English verbs. The letter &#x27;o&#x27; is often replaced with the numeral 0.
;&quot;-age&quot; suffix
:Derivation of a noun from a verb stem is possible by attaching &quot;-age&quot; to the base form of any verb. Attested derivations are &quot;pwnage&quot;, &quot;skillage&quot;, and &quot;speakage&quot;. However, leet provides exceptions; the word &quot;leetage&quot; is acceptable, referring to actively being &quot;leet&quot;. These nouns are often used with a form of &quot;to be&quot; rather than &quot;to have,&quot; e.g., &quot;that was pwnage&quot; rather than &quot;he has pwnage&quot;. Either is a more emphatic way of expressing the simpler &quot;he pwns,&quot; but the former implies that the person is &quot;embodying&quot; the trait rather than merely possessing it.
;&quot;-ness&quot; suffix
:Derivation of a noun from an adjective stem is done by attaching &quot;-ness&quot; to any adjective. This is entirely the same as the English form, except it is used much more often in Leet. Nouns such as &quot;lulzness&quot; and &quot;leetness&quot; are derivations using this suffix.
;Words ending in &quot;-ed&quot;
:When forming a past participle ending in &quot;-ed&quot;, the Leet user may replace the &quot;-e&quot; with an apostrophe, as was common in poetry of previous centuries, (e.g. &quot;pwned&quot; becomes &quot;pwn&#x27;d&quot;). Sometimes, the apostrophe is removed as well (e.g. &quot;pwned&quot; becomes &quot;pwnd&quot;). The word ending may also be substituted by &quot;-t&quot; (e.g. &quot;pwned&quot; becomes &quot;pwnt&quot;).
;Use of the &quot;-&amp;&quot; suffix
:Words ending in &quot;-and&quot;, &quot;-anned&quot;, &quot;-ant&quot;, or a similar sound can sometimes be spelled with an ampersand (&quot;&amp;&quot;) to express the ending sound (e.g. &quot;This is the s&amp;box&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, you&#x27;ve been b&amp;&quot;, &quot;&amp;hill/&amp;farm&quot;). It is most commonly used with the word &quot;banned&quot;. An alternative form of &quot;B&amp;&quot; is &quot;B7&quot;, as the ampersand is with the &quot;7&quot; key on the standard US keyboard. It is often seen in the abbreviation &quot;IBB7&quot; (in before banned), which indicates that the poster believes that a previous poster will soon be banned from the site, channel, or board on which they are posting.

==Grammar==

Leet can be pronounced as a single syllable, , rhyming with &quot;eat,&quot; by way of apheresis of the initial vowel of &quot;elite&quot;. It may also be pronounced as two syllables, . Like hacker slang, leet enjoys a looser grammar than standard English. The loose grammar, just like loose spelling, encodes some level of emphasis, ironic or otherwise. A reader must rely more on intuitive parsing of leet to determine the meaning of a sentence rather than the actual sentence structure. In particular, speakers of leet are fond of verbing nouns, turning verbs into nouns (and back again) as forms of emphasis, e.g. &quot;Austin rocks&quot; is weaker than &quot;Austin roxxorz&quot; (note spelling), which is weaker than &quot;Au5t1N is t3h r0xx0rz&quot; (note grammar), which is weaker than something like &quot;0MFG D00D /\Ü571N 15 T3H l_l83Я 1337 Я0XX0ЯZ&quot; (OMG, dude, Austin is the über-elite rocks-er!). In essence, all of these mean &quot;Austin rocks,&quot; not necessarily the other options. Added words and misspellings add to the speaker&#x27;s enjoyment. Leet, like hacker slang, employs analogy in construction of new words. For example, if &quot;haxored&quot; is the past tense of the verb &quot;to hack&quot; (hack → haxor → haxored), then &quot;winzored&quot; would be easily understood to be the past tense conjugation of &quot;to win,&quot; even if the reader had not seen that particular word before.
Leet has its own colloquialisms, many of which originated as jokes based on common typing errors, habits of new computer users, or knowledge of cyberculture and history. Leet is not solely based upon one language or character set. Greek, Russian, and other languages have leet forms, and leet in one language may use characters from another where they are available. As such, while it may be referred to as a &quot;cipher&quot;, a &quot;dialect&quot;, or a &quot;language&quot;, leet does not fit squarely into any of these categories. The term &quot;leet&quot; itself is often written &quot;31337&quot;, or &quot;1337&quot;, and many other variations. After the meaning of these became widely familiar, &quot;10100111001&quot; came to be used in its place, because it is the binary form of &quot;1337&quot; decimal, making it more of a puzzle to interpret. An increasingly common characteristic of leet is the changing of grammatical usage so as to be deliberately incorrect. The widespread popularity of deliberate misspelling is similar to the cult following of the &quot;All your base are belong to us&quot; phrase. Indeed, the online and computer communities have been international from their inception, so spellings and phrases typical of non-native speakers are quite common.

==Vocabulary==

Many words originally derived from leet have now become part of modern Internet slang, such as &quot;pwned&quot;. The original driving forces of new vocabulary in leet were common misspellings and typing errors such as &quot;teh&quot; (generally considered lolspeak), and intentional misspellings, especially the &quot;z&quot; at the end of words (&quot;skillz&quot;). Another prominent example of a surviving leet expression is &quot;w00t&quot;, an exclamation of joy. w00t is sometimes used as a backronym for &quot;We owned the other team.&quot;

New words (or corruptions thereof) may arise from a need to make one&#x27;s username unique. As any given Internet service reaches more people, the number of names available to a given user is drastically reduced. While many users may wish to have the username &quot;CatLover,&quot; for example, in many cases it is only possible for one user to have the moniker. As such, degradations of the name may evolve, such as &quot;C@7L0vr.&quot; As the leet cipher is highly dynamic, there is a wider possibility for multiple users to share the &quot;same&quot; name, through combinations of spelling and transliterations.

Additionally, &quot;leet&quot;—the word itself—can be found in the screen-names and gamertags of many Internet and video games. Use of the term in such a manner announces a high level of skill, though such an announcement may be seen as baseless hubris. 
===Terminology and common misspellings===
&quot;Warez&quot; (nominally ) is a plural shortening of &quot;software&quot;, typically referring to cracked and redistributed software. &quot;Phreaking&quot; refers to the hacking of telephone systems and other non-Internet equipment. &quot;Teh&quot; originated as a typographical error of &quot;the&quot;, and is sometimes spelled &quot;t3h&quot;. &quot;j00&quot; takes the place of &quot;you&quot;, originating from the affricate sound that occurs in place of the palatal approximant, , when &quot;you&quot; follows a word ending in an alveolar plosive consonant, such as or . Also, from German, is &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;over&quot; or &quot;above&quot;; it usually appears as a prefix attached to adjectives, and is frequently written without the umlaut over the &quot;u&quot;.

====Haxor and suxxor (suxorz)====
&quot;Haxor&quot;, and derivations thereof, is leet for &quot;hacker&quot;, and it is one of the most commonplace examples of the use of the &quot;-xor&quot; suffix. &quot;Suxxor&quot; (pronounced suck-zor) is a derogatory term which originated in warez culture and is currently used in multi-user environments such as multiplayer video games and instant messaging; it, like &quot;haxor&quot;, is one of the early leet words to use the &quot;-xor&quot; suffix. &quot;Suxxor&quot; is a modified version of &quot;sucks&quot; (the phrase &quot;to suck&quot;), and the meaning is the same as the English slang. &quot;Suxxor&quot; can be mistaken with &quot;Succer/Succker&quot; if used in the wrong context. Its negative definition essentially makes it the opposite of &quot;roxxor&quot;, and both can be used as a verb or a noun. The letters &quot;ck&quot; are often replaced with the Greek Χ (chi) in other words as well.

====n00b====
Within leet, the term &quot;n00b&quot; (and derivations thereof) is used extensively. The term is derived from &quot;newbie&quot; (as in new and inexperienced, or uninformed), and is used to differentiate &quot;n00bs&quot; from the &quot;elite&quot; (or even &quot;normal&quot;) members of a group.

====Owned and pwned====

&quot;Owned&quot; and &quot;pwned&quot; (generally pronounced &quot;poned&quot; [pʰo͡ʊnd]) both refer to the domination of a player in a video game or argument (rather than just a win), or the successful hacking of a website or computer. It is a slang term derived from the verb &quot;own&quot;, meaning to appropriate or to conquer to gain ownership. As is a common characteristic of leet, the terms have also been adapted into noun and adjective forms, &quot;ownage&quot; and &quot;pwnage&quot;, which can refer to the situation of &quot;pwning&quot; or to the superiority of its subject (e.g., &quot;He is a very good player. He is pwnage.&quot;).

The term was created accidentally by the misspelling of &quot;own&quot; due to the keyboard proximity of the &quot;O&quot; and &quot;P&quot; keys. It implies domination or humiliation of a rival, used primarily in the Internet-based video game culture to taunt an opponent who has just been soundly defeated (e.g., &quot;You just got pwned!&quot;). In 2015 Scrabble added pwn to their Official Scrabble Words list.

====Pr0n====

&quot;Pr0n&quot; is slang for &quot;pornography&quot;. This is a deliberately inaccurate spelling/pronunciation for &quot;porn&quot;, where a zero is often used to replace the letter O. It is sometimes used in legitimate communications (such as email discussion groups, Usenet, chat rooms, and Internet web pages) to circumvent language and content filters, which may reject messages as offensive or spam. The word also helps prevent search engines from associating commercial sites with pornography, which might result in unwelcome traffic. &quot;Pr0n&quot; is also sometimes spelled backwards (n0rp) to further obscure the meaning to potentially uninformed readers. It can also refer to ASCII art depicting pornographic images, or to photos of the internals of consumer and industrial hardware. &quot;Prawn&quot;, a spoof of the misspelling, has started to come into use, as well; in &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;, a pornographer films his movies on &quot;Prawn Island&quot;. Conversely, in the RPG &quot;Kingdom of Loathing&quot;, &quot;prawn&quot;, referring to a kind of crustacean, is spelled &quot;pr0n&quot;, leading to the creation of food items such as &quot;pr0n chow mein&quot;.

<doc id="18564" wikidata="Q845922" url="?curid=18564" title="Lois Lane">
<text>Lois Lane is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, she first appeared in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 (June 1938). Lois is an award-winning journalist for the Metropolis newspaper the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; and the primary love interest of the superhero Superman and his alter ego, Clark Kent. In DC continuity, she is also his wife and the mother of their son, Jon Kent, the newest Superboy in the DC Universe.

Lois&#x27;s physical appearance was originally based on Joanne Carter, a model hired by Joe Shuster. Jerry Siegel took her name from actress Lola Lane, while her character was inspired by actress Glenda Farrell&#x27;s portrayal of the fictional reporter Torchy Blane in a series of 1930s self-titled films.

Depictions of the character have varied spanning the comics and other media adaptations. The original Golden Age version of Lois Lane, as well as versions of her from the 1970s onwards, portrays Lois as a dauntless journalist and intellectually equal to Superman. During the Silver Age of Comics, she was the star of &quot;Superman&#x27;s Girl Friend, Lois Lane&quot;, a comic book series that had a light and humorous tone. 

Lois has appeared in various media adaptations and is among the best-known female comic book characters. Actress Noel Neill first portrayed Lois Lane in the 1940s &quot;Superman&quot; film series and later reprised her role in the 1950s television series &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;, replacing Phyllis Coates from season two. Margot Kidder played the character in four Superman films in the 1970s and 1980s, Kate Bosworth in the 2006 film &quot;Superman Returns&quot; and Amy Adams in the DC Extended Universe. Teri Hatcher portrayed Lois in the 1990s television series &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; and Erica Durance in the 2000s series &quot;Smallville&quot;. Elizabeth Tulloch played the character in the television series &quot;Superman &amp; Lois&quot;. Rachel Brosnahan will play Lois Lane in the upcoming film &quot;Superman&quot; (2025).

==Creation==
Writer Jerry Siegel first conceived Lois Lane in 1934, when Siegel and Joe Shuster were still developing Superman. A major influence on Lois&#x27;s characterization was actress Glenda Farrell and her portrayal of the fictional reporter Torchy Blane in a series of Warner Bros. films. The Torchy Blane movies were popular second features during the later 1930s. On the conception of Lois Lane, Siegel stated in the 1988 &quot;Time&quot; magazine:


Artist Joe Shuster based Lois&#x27;s physical appearance on a model named Joanne Carter. Carter had placed an ad in the &quot;Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot; newspaper in the Situation Wanted column, advertising herself as a model. Shuster corresponded with her and hired her as the model for Lois Lane. Shuster&#x27;s depiction of Lois was modeled on her hairstyle and facial features. &quot;To me she was Lois Lane. She was a great inspiration for me, though. She encouraged me, she was very enthusiastic about the strip; it meant a lot to me.&quot; Shuster said about Joanne Carter.

Joanne Carter married co-creator Jerry Siegel in 1948. On working with Joe Shuster for Lois Lane, Carter said in the 1983 &quot;Nemo&quot; magazine interview: &quot;Joe was redrawing the strip, and it was going to be more realistic, rather than cartoony. I used to model for him every Saturday until he had enough drawings. He made so many stock drawings that it got to a point where he didn&#x27;t need any more. We became such good friends by that time we decided we would always stay friends.&quot;

==Publication history==
Lois Lane made her debut in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 (June 1938), the first published Superman story. Lois is the daughter of Ella and Sam Lane, in earlier comics, her parents were farmers in a town called Pittsdale. The modern comics depicts Lois as a former Army brat, born at Ramstein Air Base with Lois having been trained by her father, a US Army General, in areas such as hand-to-hand combat and the use of firearms. She has one younger sibling, her sister Lucy Lane. Lois is a journalist for the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;, one of the best investigative reporters and the best at the newspaper she works at. Lois has shown obtaining superpowers and becoming a superhero, some of her superhero identities are Superwoman and Red Tornado of Earth 2.

Aspects of Lois&#x27;s personality have varied over the years, depending on the comic book writers handling of the character and American social attitudes toward women at the time. In most incarnations, she is shown to be an independent person who is smart, determined and strong-willed. Her physical appearance has varied over the years, depending either on contemporary fashion or media adaptations. In the 1990s, when the television series &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; began airing Lois received a haircut that made her look more like actress Teri Hatcher, and her eyes were typically violet to match her character on &quot;&quot;. From the late 1980s through the 1990s she was depicted with auburn hair in the comic books.
In the 1940s, Lois had a newspaper comic strip, &quot;Lois Lane, Girl Reporter&quot;, a direct spin-off of the Superman comic strip running at the time. A similarly titled comic series began appearing in the &quot;Superman&quot; comic book in 1944, starting with &quot;Superman&quot; #28. In 1958, DC Comics gave Lois a comic book series, &quot;Superman&#x27;s Girl Friend, Lois Lane&quot;. The series focuses on her solo adventures and start publication in April 1958. In the 1960s, the series was one of DC&#x27;s most popular titles and was the top ten best-selling comic books in America. She had a series featured in &quot;The Superman Family&quot; comic book from 1974 to 1982. Released in 2019, &quot;Lois Lane&quot;, a 12-issue series by writer Greg Rucka and artist Mike Perkins investigates threats and conspiracies in the DC Universe. 

Lois is the character most commonly associated with Superman, and throughout their long history, she has always been the most prominent love interest in Clark Kent/Superman&#x27;s life. In the 1990s, after Clark proposes to Lois and reveals to her that he is Superman, she married him in the comic book &quot;&quot; (December 1996). The couple&#x27;s biological child in DC Comics canon was born in &quot;Convergence: Superman&quot; #2 (July 2015) a son named Jonathan Samuel Kent, who eventually becomes Superboy.

==Fictional character biography==

===Golden Age===

In the Golden Age comics, Lois was an aggressive, career-minded reporter for the &quot;Daily Star&quot; (the newspaper&#x27;s name was changed to the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #23 in 1940). After Clark Kent joined the paper and Superman debuted around the same time, Lois found herself attracted to Superman but displeased with her new journalistic competition in the form of Kent.

Starting early as the 1940s, Lois began to suspect that Clark Kent was Superman, and started to make various attempts at uncovering his secret identity, all of which backfired because of Superman&#x27;s efforts. The first such story appears in &quot;Superman&quot; #17 (July–August 1942). This theme became particularly pronounced in the 1950s and 1960s Silver Age comic books.

Lois gained her first series of stories (without Superman) starting with &quot;Superman&quot; #28 (May–June 1944), &quot;Lois Lane, Girl Reporter&quot;, running in the &quot;Superman&quot; comic book for a number of years, had Lois defeating bad guys and getting front-page stories on her own, without any help from Superman.

In the Golden Age comics, Lois had a niece named Susie Tompkins, whose main trait was getting into trouble by telling exaggerated tall tales and fibs to adults. Susie&#x27;s last appearance was in &quot;Superman&quot; #95 (February 1955). Subsequent comics presented Lois&#x27; only sibling, Lucy, as single and childless.

===Silver Age and Bronze Age===
When the reading audience of superhero comic books became predominately young boys in the mid to late 1950s, the focus of Superman stories shifted toward science fiction inspired plots involving extraterrestrials, fantasy creatures, and bizarre plots.

Lois&#x27;s main interests in various late 1950s and 1960s stories became vying with her rival Lana Lang for Superman&#x27;s affections, attempting to prove Clark Kent and Superman were one and the same or otherwise getting Superman into marriage. Superman&#x27;s rationale for resisting her matrimonial desires was that marrying her would put her in increased danger from his enemies and that she could not keep his secret identity hidden. Regardless, Lois married several times in the Superman stories of this era, including to a Superman impostor from Kandor, the villainous Zak-Kul and a man from the future. All these marriages were either annulled or otherwise forgotten.
Lois became more and more popular during the 1950s, and after appearing as the lead character in two issues of DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Showcase&quot; in 1957, DC created an ongoing series for Lois, titled &quot;Superman&#x27;s Girl Friend, Lois Lane&quot;. The series ran for 137 issues, beginning in April 1958 to October 1974. Most stories were about Lois&#x27; romance with Superman, and were drawn by artist Kurt Schaffenberger. Schaffenberger&#x27;s rendition of Lois became cited by many as the &quot;definitive&quot; version of Lois, and he was often asked by DC editor Mort Weisinger to redraw other artists&#x27; depictions of Lois Lane in other DC titles where she appeared. So many stories depicted Lois and marriage that the cover of a 1968 80-Page Giant that reprinted several such stories, the &quot;All-Wedding Issue&quot;, described the magazine as &quot;featuring Lois&#x27; schemes and dreams to marry Superman!&quot;.

The series &quot;Superman&#x27;s Girl Friend, Lois Lane&quot; became one of DC&#x27;s most popular titles, the third best-selling comic in 1962 and 1965. The title featured the first appearance of the Silver Age Catwoman, after an absence from the comics for over a decade.

While Lois is suspicious of Superman&#x27;s secret identity as early as &quot;Superman&quot; #7 (1940), her suspicions grew during the early Silver Age, with many stories in her series focusing on her attempts to prove Superman and Clark Kent were one and the same. Stories showed Superman using various means to protect his secret identity from Lois, including his Superman robots or Batman disguising himself as Clark/Superman.

By the end of the 1960s, as attitudes toward women&#x27;s role in American society changed, Lois&#x27; character changed as well. In &quot;Superman&#x27;s Girl Friend, Lois Lane&quot; #80 (Jan. 1968), the character&#x27;s fashions were updated to a then more contemporary look. Stories in the 1970s depicted Lois again as fully capable and less reliant on Superman. She engaged in more adventures without Superman being involved and was much less interested in discovering Superman&#x27;s secret identity.

Lois had a series featured in &quot;The Superman Family&quot; (an anthology title started in the mid-1970s after the cancellation of &quot;Superman&#x27;s Girl Friend, Lois Lane&quot; and &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal, Jimmy Olsen&quot;) from 1974 to 1982. In her series, Lois regularly battled criminals and often defeated them using her quick wits and considerable skill in the Kryptonian martial art of Klurkor, taught to her by Kryptonian survivors in the bottle city of Kandor. There were several cameos of the New Gods, including Desaad and Darkseid. Lois Lane was the backup series in &quot;The Daring New Adventures of Supergirl&quot; in 1982 to 1983.

During the Silver and Bronze Age, Lois&#x27; backstory became more fully fleshed out, with various stories explaining her life before becoming employed at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. This backstory was attributed to the Lois Lane of Earth-One.

As summarized in various stories, Lois was born to Sam and Ella Lane and grew up on their farm in the small town of Pittsdale. At the age of two, Lois suffered measles, and at the age of three, whooping cough. At an unspecified time during Lois&#x27; childhood, her younger sister Lucy Lane was born. While Lois was a toddler, she encountered a rattlesnake in the woods near the Lane family farm. The snake was scared away by one of Kal-El&#x27;s baby toys which had landed nearby in one of Jor-El&#x27;s experimental rockets.

During Lois&#x27; adolescence, she won a youth contest run by the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;, with the prize being a trip to Metropolis to spend a week working as a cub reporter for the newspaper. There, she first met Clark Kent of Smallville, who was the other winner of the contest. Lois found Clark dull and became more interested in asking him for information about Superboy after learning Clark came from Smallville. During the week in Metropolis, Lois made a bet with Clark to see who would get the most scoops, which turned out to be Lois, as Clark was forced to constantly go into action as Superboy. Lois met Superboy for the first time while uncovering a criminal enterprise for one of her stories. At the end of the week, Clark paid off Lois&#x27; bet (an ice cream sundae), and the two returned to their respective hometowns. Lois would meet Superboy (but not Clark Kent) again during her adolescence while attending an all-girls summer camp near Smallville. There, Lois met Lana Lang, a fellow camper, for the first time. Lois would make further attempts at landing a job with the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; during her teenage years and spent time writing for her hometown&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;Pittsdale Star&quot;.

Upon finishing high school, Lois left Pittsdale and attended Raleigh College to study journalism. While in college, Lois worked for the student newspaper, the &quot;Raleigh Review&quot;, as a reporter and eventually its co-editor. After graduating from college, Lois became permanently employed at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. Clark Kent and Jimmy Olsen later joined the &quot;Planet&quot;″s staff but Lois remained the newspaper&#x27;s star reporter, winning the Pulitzer Prize. She was very dependent on Superman, however; he told her that having to rescue her so often from problems she caused prevented him from helping others. For example, when late for a deadline Lois jumped off a cliff expecting Superman to catch her &quot;as he has done a thousand times&quot;, and fly her to her destination. When asked on a Sunday morning talk show what she would do if trapped in an underground mine with rescue impossible before the air ran out, Lois admitted that she would impatiently await Superman because &quot;I&#x27;ve got a deadline to meet.&quot;

Eventually, Lois realized that she had wasted a good part of her career by staying in Metropolis for Superman&#x27;s sake and left. As both a journalist and as a woman, she had to get on with her life.

After the 1985–1986 miniseries &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; writer John Byrne revised the Superman legend and eliminated the Silver Age version of Lois from continuity. Before this happened, a final non-canonical imaginary story &quot;Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?&quot; was written by Alan Moore, meant as a send-off for the pre-Crisis versions of the characters, including Lois. Published at the same time but in Earth-One continuity was a two-issue miniseries, &quot;Lois Lane&quot;, in which she investigates missing children.

===Modern Age===

Lois underwent a character alteration beginning with John Byrne&#x27;s &quot;The Man of Steel&quot; miniseries, which significantly rewrote Superman&#x27;s origin and history. In this modern version of events, Lois was portrayed as a tough-as-nails reporter who rarely needed rescuing. She was depicted as strong, opinionated, yet sensitive.

Lois&#x27;s first real relationship in this version was with Jose Delgado, who she later discovered acted as a vigilante. José&#x27;s legs are shattered in a battle with a Lexcorp cyborg/human hybrid gone amok. Delgado eventually recovered. He and Lois would have several on and off experiences together before the relationship completely disintegrated, due to Delgado accepting help from a Lexcorp subsidiary ARL.

Another major change made was that Lois did not fall in love with just Superman, although she was attracted to him. One reason was the revised nature of the Superman/Clark Kent relationship. In the original Silver Age stories, Superman had been the man who disguised himself as Clark Kent. In this newly revised concept, it was Clark Kent who lived a life in which his activity as Superman was decidedly secondary. Lois initially resented the rookie Clark Kent getting the story on Superman as his first piece when she had spent ages trying to get an interview. This sometimes ill-tempered rivalry remained the case until &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; #460–463 and &quot;Action Comics&quot; #650.

Following Clark&#x27;s brief rampage under the influence of the Eradicator, Lois was hesitant to forgive Clark for &quot;selling out&quot; to Collin Thornton and running &quot;Newstime&quot; Magazine, but forgave him in a span of mere minutes when he returned to ask for his job back. Clark elected to repay Lois by finally letting go of his self-imposed inhibitions and passionately kissed her. The two became a couple, and eventually, Lois accepted a proposal of marriage. Clark shortly after revealed to her that he was Superman.

DC Comics had planned on Lois and Clark being married in 1993&#x27;s &quot;Superman vol. 2&quot; #75. With the then-upcoming television show &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, DC decided they did not want to have the two married in the comics and not married on TV. Partially as a result of this, Superman was killed in &quot;Superman&quot; #75 instead, dying in Lois&#x27; arms after a battle royal with the monster Doomsday. After a period of time, Superman returned to life, and both he and Lois resumed their relationship, though not without a few problems (such as a brief reappearance of Clark&#x27;s former college girlfriend, the mermaid Lori Lemaris). Lois eventually decided to take an overseas assignment to assert her independence and not be dependent on Clark, who had begun to overprotect her. When Clark became convinced Lois was in danger, he and her father Sam allied to aid her secretly.

When Lois returned to Metropolis, she had been through several life-threatening exploits and was slightly amused when Clark informed her his powers had been depleted, and that he was her editor (due to Perry White&#x27;s cancer). Upon discovering Clark still had her wedding ring within a handkerchief, Lois warmly broke down, teasing Clark and finally agreeing to become his wife.

Lois and Clark were finally married in the comic book &quot;&quot; (December 1996), which featured the work of nearly every living artist who had ever worked on Superman. The issue was published during the week of October 6, 1996, coinciding with an episode of the television series &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, which featured the wedding of the two characters. &quot;The Wedding Album&quot; itself spent part of its opening pages accommodating and reconciling the then-current comic storyline of Lois and Clark having broken off their engagement.

Since their marriage, Clark and Lois continue to be one of the strongest relationships in comics. In 2006, the couple took the next step in adopting a newly arrived Kryptonian boy, who they named Chris Kent. The boy is later discovered to be the son of Jor-El&#x27;s foe, General Zod. Although initially uneasy about raising a super-powered child, Lois has shown immense aptitude of being &#x27;Mommy Lois.&#x27; Following a devastating battle with Zod, Chris sacrificed himself to seal the Phantom Zone rift, trapping himself inside with Zod&#x27;s forces, leaving Lois without her son.

In the second issue of &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, Lois and Perry are caught in an explosion triggered by Clayface destroying the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; and Lois is critically injured. In the third issue, it is revealed that only Clark&#x27;s heat vision is keeping her heart beating. Clark is visited by a mysterious phantom who insists that he must depart Earth immediately if he is to save his wife&#x27;s life. The story is continued in the 3D tie-in comic &quot;Superman Beyond&quot;, where the female Monitor Zillo Valla stops time around Lois, allowing Superman to leave her side for a while, recruiting him and several of his multiversal doppelgangers in a mission to save the entire Multiverse, promising care for Lois. After defeating the dark Monitor Mandrakk, Superman brings back a distilled drop of The Bleed and administers it to Lois through a kiss, restoring her to full health. Lois is later seen in &quot;Final Crisis&quot; #6, one of the few still free humans.

After the events of &quot;&quot; Superman must leave Earth for an undetermined amount of time swearing off his Earthly connections in the eyes of his fellow Kryptonians to keep an eye on General Zod the New Kryptonian military commander, but he secretly tells Lois he still considers her his wife and will come back to her. In the issues of &quot;Action Comics&quot; Lois has reunited with Christopher Kent who has aged to adulthood in the past months and became the new Metropolis hero Nightwing. Supergirl and Lana visit Lois&#x27; apartment to tell her the bad news that her sister Lucy Lane was killed during a battle with Supergirl. Lois does not believe that her sister is dead and refuses to accept the news until she has irrefutable proof. Lois asks Supergirl for a recovered piece of Superwoman&#x27;s costume.

Lois hands her exposé in and the government is after her for treason. With agents on her tail, she makes a mad dash for it. When Lois is in custody, her father Sam Lane is there to greet her in an interview room in an unnamed facility. Sam tells Lois the only reason he has been lenient with her is because she is his daughter, while he does love her the planet will always come first over his family and threatens to make her disappear forever if she continues. Lois returns to the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; under cover of night and explains all to Perry. She points out the whole paper is at risk and everyone connected to it if her exposé runs. Perry understands and though he must protect the paper he is first and foremost a good journalist and nudges Lois in the right direction; he will not run the story but noted it must get out to the people somehow. Enlightened, she quits the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;, as Lois gets her edge back. It was later revealed she never really quit the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;.

Lois learns her father&#x27;s forces destroyed New Krypton. She is kidnapped by Lucy and taken to Sam&#x27;s secret base. There, Lois argues with her father, countering his insistence on regarding the Kryptonians as &quot;rabid dogs&quot; by pointing out that they naturally regard &quot;him&quot; as a genocidal maniac after he destroyed their planet. In the war between New Krypton and Earth, Supergirl finds them and threatens to kill Sam. Lois stops her, saying her father will be judged for his war crimes. Refusing to go to trial, Sam takes a gun and commits suicide. Later, Lois visits the imprisoned Lucy. She expresses disbelief on what her sister has become. Lois says while she will not miss her father, she will miss her sister.

In &quot;&quot;, Superman begins a journey through America to reconnect with the American people, and Lois, though confused at first, supports his choice. Lois later travels to Rushmark and finds an old college friend Brian, who invites her to have dinner with him and his wife. When Lois leaves Brian&#x27;s home she is met by Superman. The two reaffirm their love to each other and go to Chicago. There, Lois helps Superman arrest a violent father who has been attacking his wife and son. Later, Lois and Superman investigate a factory in Des Moines. Lois wants to publish an article, which would reveal the workers&#x27; illegal activities, but Superman forces her not to. Feeling betrayed, Lois returns to Metropolis and does not speak to Superman for a while. When Lois is kidnapped by Lisa Jennings, a woman who wants to destroy Superman, he rescues her. With the danger over. Superman apologizes to Lois about what happened in Des Moines. Lois replies that she wrote the article anyway, saying that she was a reporter before she was his wife. Knowing that his wife did the right thing, Superman kisses her. The two then return home.

===The New 52===
In 2011, DC Comics relaunched its titles and its main continuity was rebooted with the New 52. Lois now works for Morgan Edge heading up the media division of the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. She views Clark as a friend and is unaware that he is Superman.

Lois investigates the story of twenty people who developed metahuman powers after being kidnapped by Brainiac. Her search leads her to a U.S. senator, who revealed to be one of the Twenty. The senator dies, but not before transferring his powers to Lois, who falls into a coma. Lois later awakes from her coma at the hospital, with Jonathan Carroll at her side. Lois manifests psychic powers and helps Superman fight the Psychic Pirate. During the fight, Lois learns that Clark is Superman but falls back into a coma. After defeating the Psychic Pirate, Superman brings Lois back to the hospital. Later, the Parasite attacks the hospital and attempts to steal Lois&#x27; powers. Superman tricks the Parasite into absorbing Lois&#x27; psionic energy. The power overwhelms the Parasite, causing him to collapse. Lois awakens from her coma but she does not seem to remember Superman&#x27;s identity.

Lois is the main character in the &quot;Superman: Lois Lane&quot; #1 one-shot. In this story, Lois&#x27; sister, Lucy, asks for her help in finding her roommate Amanda Suresh, who had been kidnapped by a mysterious group called &quot;the Cartel.&quot; According to Lucy, Amanda had been taking a drug that transformed her into a monster. As Lois investigates the Cartel, she gets captured and taken to the Cartel&#x27;s headquarters. There, Lois finds out the Cartel had been capturing people who had been mutated by the drug. Lois escapes and rescues Amanda when the captured monsters cause a riot. As she returns home, Lois finds out Lucy had been taking the drug. As Lucy apologizes for putting all three in danger, Lois chooses to publish her story about the Cartel.

Some time after this, an organisation led by the mysterious &#x27;HODOR-ROOT&#x27; learn Superman&#x27;s secret identity, prompting him to share that information with Lois. When HODOR-ROOT try to analyse Clark&#x27;s new &#x27;Super-Flare&#x27; power, Lois reveals his identity to the public in the hope of removing their blackmail card, but this forces Clark to go on the run, hunted by criminals and law enforcement as some apparent side-effect of his Super-Flare has depleted his powers. Superman eventually learns that his depleted powers are due to Vandal Savage infecting him with a form of radiation that inhibits his cells&#x27; ability to absorb solar radiation, subjecting himself to kryptonite as a form of chemotherapy. With his powers restored, Clark reconciles with Lois, accepting that she exposed his identity for good reasons.

In the &quot;New 52: Futures End&quot;, set five years in the possible future of the New 52-verse. Lois is considered the most successful freelance reporter on the planet and her blog &quot;The Fast Lane&quot; is one of the most read and well-respected sources of news in the world.
In the miniseries &quot;Convergence&quot;, which featured many Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; DC Universe characters, including a married Superman and his pregnant wife Lois Lane, deal with the impending birth of their child, as Superman is called to protect the city. &quot;Convergence&quot; shows the birth of their son, Jon Kent.

Following &quot;Convergence&quot;, DC announced the spin-off comic book series &quot;&quot;, debuting in October 2015 by Dan Jurgens and Lee Weeks. The eight-issue series is set several years after the &quot;Convergence&quot; event, where Clark and Lois and their son Jon have been living and working in the New 52 universe. The couple now lives in California and has changed their last name to White (a tribute to Perry White). Lois has become an anonymous author, publishing several critically acclaimed books under the alias name &quot;Author X.&quot; While Clark continues his superhero duty, protecting cities and civilians quietly behind the scenes. Their son, Jonathan, eventually began to develop superpowers of his own (similar to those of his father Superman) and learned the truth about his parents&#x27; true origin.

In &quot;The Final Days of Superman&quot;, the pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; Superman helps his &quot;New 52&quot; counterpart defeat a man who has become convinced that he is the &#x27;true&#x27; Superman after exposure to some of Superman&#x27;s excess energy. &quot;New 52&quot;-Lois is present when &#x27;her&#x27; Superman expires as recent energy exposures catch up with him, after he tells her his life story for posterity.

===DC Rebirth===
In June 2016, DC Comics relaunched its entire line of comic book titles with DC Rebirth. The publisher once again re-established the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; Superman as the principal Superman in DC comics, along with his wife, Lois Lane, and their son, Jonathan.

Lois began to investigate the disappearance of her New 52 counterpart, and after learning the apparent death of her other-self, she returns to the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; posing as her counterpart. Following a confrontation with Mister Mxyzptlk, Lois and Superman&#x27;s essence is merged with their New 52 counterpart, creating a new DC Universe.

Released in July 2019 to July 2020, Lois stars in a 12-issue limited series &quot;Lois Lane&quot; written by Greg Rucka and art by Mike Perkins. The series sees Lois as she investigates stories of conspiracy, intrigue and murder in the DC Universe. Writer Greg Rucka intended for the series to focus on Lois&#x27; legacy as a hard-boiled journalist and the investigative world which she inhabits, with the series reflecting the state of modern journalism in the world today.

==Superhero identities==
Lois Lane has become a superhero and gained superpowers several times in the comics, animation, and live-action series.

===Superwoman===

Lois was the first person to assume the Superwoman persona and has become the superheroine on several occasions. Her first appearance as Superwoman (as well as Superwoman&#x27;s first appearance in DC Comics) was in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #60 (May 1943). The story is set in a dream sequence, where, after Lois is hit by a truck, she dreams a transfusion of Superman&#x27;s blood gives her superpowers and she becomes Superwoman. In &quot;Superman&quot; #45, Lois believes Hocus and Pocus—a pair of fraudulent magicians—have given her superpowers, and with Superman&#x27;s help and intervention, Lois once again becomes Superwoman. In &quot;Action Comics&quot; #156, Lois actually gains superpowers from one of Lex Luthor&#x27;s inventions, which launches a short-lived career as &quot;Superwoman.&quot; In &quot;The Superman Family&quot; #207, the Earth-Two Lois gained superpowers from her husband, after Superman brought an extraterrestrial plant into their home, with Lois losing the powers after the death of the plant. Other stories have Lois transformed into Superwoman when Superman transfers some of his powers to Lois, or due to Mr. Mxyzptlk&#x27;s interference. On &quot;Smallville&quot; in the episode &quot;Prophecy,&quot; Jor-El gives Lois all of Clark&#x27;s powers for one day.

In the original Crime Syndicate of America on Earth-Three, Lois Lane and Superwoman were two separate individual characters. Superwoman is a supervillain and Lois married Earth-Three&#x27;s greatest champion, Alexander Luthor. The pre-Crisis version of the characters perished when Earth-Three was destroyed during the events of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. In the graphic novel &quot;&quot;, Superwoman, a member of the Crime Syndicate is the alternate version of Lois Lane. She is an Amazon by birth and the chief editor of the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. She inhabits the same antimatter universe which contains the planet Qward. The New 52 version of Superwoman of Earth-3 is also named Lois Lane and is part of the Crime Syndicate.

In &quot;All-Star Superman&quot;, the 12-issue comic book series by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely, Lois becomes a Kryptonian Superwoman for 24 hours. In the story, Superman (who believed he was dying) revealed his secret identity to her and takes Lois to his Fortress of Solitude to spend her birthday. While at his Arctic sanctuary, he presents Lois with her birthday present, a formula called &quot;Exo-Genes&quot; created by Superman from his own DNA, that allows Lois to have his powers for twenty-four hours. With her new Kryptonian powers and new Superwoman costume (made by Superman), the two spend the whole day together on different adventures and shared a kiss on the moon. At the end of the story, Superman proclaims his love for Lois, before he flies off into the sun to repair it. Lois later appeared as Superwoman in the animated All-Star Superman film, voiced by Christina Hendricks.

In DC Rebirth, the &quot;New 52&quot; Lois and Lana gained superpowers due to the solar energy explosion caused by the death of the New 52 Superman. This results in both Lois and Lana becoming Superwoman, with Lois possessing all of Superman&#x27;s traditional powers, while Lana has the ability to absorb solar energy and release it in other forms. Lois later dies at the hands of a female Bizarro, being overloaded with solar energy the same way Superman was killed.

In 2024, Lois returned as Superwoman in DC Comics in the DC All In initiative. She first appeared as Superwoman in &quot;Superman&quot; vol 6 #19. During the &quot;Absolute Power&quot; storyline, Amanda Waller&#x27;s Amazo robots steal the powers of Earth&#x27;s metahumans, among others. In &quot;Superwoman Special&quot; #1, it was revealed that General Zod is among those affected, and Lois gains his powers and becomes Superwoman again.

===Red Tornado===

Following the DC relaunch, the series &quot;Earth 2&quot; debuted in 2012, set on the parallel world of that name. It depicts a modern take on the Golden Age world, starring the Justice Society of America and superheroes of that period.

In &quot;Earth 2&quot;, Lois Lane is married to Superman. When Clark&#x27;s cousin Kara arrived on earth, she stayed with Clark&#x27;s parents, before moving in and living with Clark and Lois. Lois considers Kara as her daughter and Kara calls Lois mom. Five years prior to the start of the story, during the first Apokoliptian invasion of Earth 2, Lois was killed by one of Darkseid&#x27;s assassins at the Daily Planet, she died in her husband&#x27;s arms. Superman and many other heroes of Earth 2 perished in the war.

Five years later, as various heroes begin to rise and various gods from Apokolips begin to wreak havoc again. Lois&#x27; consciousness is revealed to have survived and was downloaded into the robot body of Red Tornado by her father Sam Lane and Robert Crane. Lois, now as Red Tornado, possessed the power of wind manipulation and cyclone generation abilities. Lois bands together with Green Lantern (Alan Scott), Batman (Thomas Wayne), Accountable (Jimmy Olsen) and the other gathered heroes to fight against the forces of Apokolips. After a protracted battle with what was thought to be a surviving brainwashed Superman, Lois realizes he is, in fact, a Bizarro, and takes advantage of his deteriorating form to disintegrate him with a cyclone blast. In the story, Lois is referred to by Doctor Fate as the &quot;Resurrection hope&quot;.

During Superman&#x27;s rampage and destruction on Earth 2, Lois is among a group that discovers Val-Zod, a Kryptonian, hidden in a cell beneath Arkham. Lois helps Val feel accepted and welcomed on Earth 2, learn to control his superpower, and overcome his agoraphobia (due to his prolonged travel in space to Earth). Val-Zod eventually becomes the new Superman of Earth 2.

In the second Apokoliptian invasion of Earth 2, Lois and Kara are reunited, after Kara and Huntress return to Earth 2 from Prime Earth. Lois, along with Kara, Val, Huntress, Batman and other heroes, fights against the armies of Apokolips and new villains appearing across Earth 2. While searching for Huntress beneath the fire pits of Earth 2 in DeSaad&#x27;s cloning facility, Lois, Val, Kara and Batman found the real Superman who has been held captive for five years. He was revived by DeSaad and was used as the genetic source for the Kryptonian clones. The extraction of his DNA corrupted his body leaving him without any powers. Lois and Superman reunite briefly, before he sacrificed himself one last time, destroying the Parademon facilities using his corrupt DNA. After Superman&#x27;s death, Lois gave Kara the symbol from his uniform, which was then worn by Kara in remembrance.

In the final days of Earth 2, Lois&#x27; instincts as a journalist lead her to attempt to preserve and record the history and stories of Earth 2 in her large memory bank in the hope that someday, someone will read the data and rebuild this world. After the destruction of Earth 2, Lois and the remaining civilians and heroes of Earth 2 relocated to a new world.

The writer of &quot;Earth 2&quot;, Tom Taylor, specifically resurrected Lois Lane on Earth 2 after he was told to kill off the character in the &quot;Injustice&quot; comic series. Taylor stated &quot;bringing Lois in was quite a personal thing, because having to do such horrible, horrible things to her in Injustice, the first thing I asked when I got on the book was if I could bring back Lois. Then it was just a matter of working out exactly how.&quot; Taylor received &quot;Women in Refrigerators&quot; criticism for his &quot;Injustice&quot; comic stories. Bringing back Lois as Red Tornado was Taylor&#x27;s way to &quot;unfridge&quot; Lois. As Taylor noted, in Lois&#x27; first appearance as Red Tornado, Lois literally came out of a blue refrigerator. Other reasons for bringing back Lois involve Superman, Taylor commented &quot;While evil bastard Superman is out there killing and maiming and destroying, I wanted Lois to exist as the counterpoint to this. She&#x27;s the beating heart at the center. She&#x27;s the good Ying to Superman&#x27;s evil Yang. Where there&#x27;s Lois, there&#x27;s hope.&quot;

Nicola Scott, the long-time artist on Earth 2, on drawing Red Tornado Lois, &quot;I wanted Lois to be Lois, despite the fact that she&#x27;s metal. I wanted to make sure she looked really feminine and really beautiful, so all she&#x27;d need is a flesh coating and a wig and she&#x27;d be good to go.&quot;

==Earth-Two version==
DC Comics instituted its multiverse system in the early 1960s for organizing its continuity and introduced the Earth-Two Superman in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #73 (August 1969). This retcon declared the Golden Age Superman and Lois Lane stories (i.e. comics published from 1938 through the early 1950s) as having taken place on the parallel world of &quot;Earth-Two&quot; versus the then mainstream (Silver Age) universe of &quot;Earth-One&quot;.
In &quot;Action Comics&quot; #484 (June 1978), a flashback story reveals Earth-Two&#x27;s Lois became infatuated with Clark Kent after the latter lost his memory of his superheroic identity (thanks to a spell cast by the old Justice Society of America enemy Wizard working for Colonel Future), with the result of Clark acting more aggressive and extroverted. Clark and Lois began to date each other and were soon married. During the honeymoon, Lois discovered that Clark was indeed Superman. After recruiting the aid of Wizard, Lois restored Clark&#x27;s memory and Wizard surrendered to the authorities.

The now-married Lois and Clark appeared in a series of stories in &quot;The Superman Family&quot; #195–199 and #201–222 titled &quot;Mr and Mrs Superman&quot;, which presented their further adventures early in their marriage. Susie Tompkins made a return as a recurring character. Years later, Lois and Clark acted as parental figures for Power Girl, Superman&#x27;s cousin, after she arrived on Earth.

During the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; miniseries, the Earth-Two Lois Lane was seemingly seen for the final time, as Lois, the Earth-Two Superman, and the Superboy of Earth-Prime are, at the end of the story, taken by Earth-Three&#x27;s Alexander Luthor Jr. into a paradise-like dimension. Following the events of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths,&quot; this version of Lois was retroactively removed from DC&#x27;s continuity.

In 2005&#x27;s &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; miniseries, it was revealed that the Earth-Two Lois Lane Kent, along with Superboy, Alexander Luthor Jr., and Superman, have been watching the events of the post-Crisis DC Universe from their pocket dimension. Out of the four observers, she is the only one who still believes that the new universe is just going through a rough patch; Superboy-Prime and Alexander Luthor Jr. are convinced that Earth is utterly corrupt, and Kal-L is slowly becoming swayed to their way of thinking. This version of Lois is frail, and dying for reasons not explicitly revealed, though possibly connected to her octogenarian status. This was the main reason for Kal-L&#x27;s determination to restore Earth-Two, as he believed that Lois&#x27; health would recover once back on her proper Earth. Despite the restoration of Earth-Two, Lois Lane Kent died in the arms of her husband Superman regardless of Kal-L&#x27;s protests that he could not let her die. After Kal-L died at the hands of Superboy-Prime, he commented that he finally understood Lois&#x27; final words &quot;It&#x27;s... not... going...&quot; as meaning that it would never end for them, and one day it would be understood that even the heroes who had been lost in the original Crisis were still out there somewhere. After his demise, they are shown reunited in the stars, while their bodies are buried on Earth alongside Kon-El&#x27;s, who gave his life to stop Superboy-Prime&#x27;s attempts to restore his Earth.

Lois later returns as a sinister Black Lantern with her husband in the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; crossover. Her first task is to kidnap Martha Kent with her spouse and stating that she and Kal-L wish for Kal-El, Conner Kent, and Martha, to be reunited with Jonathan Kent in death. She proved unable to deal with the resourcefulness of Martha Kent, and was set ablaze by the widow, but kept regenerating until Krypto intervened, ripping the black ring out of her hand and preventing regeneration for long enough to allow Superman and Conner Kent to destroy the Black Lantern powerhouses attacking Smallville, and reaching town to aid others unhindered. Black Lantern Lois later appears to Power Girl, claiming that she has escaped the ring&#x27;s corrupting influence, and needs her help. This was just a ploy to get close enough to her husband&#x27;s body, which was being held in the JSA headquarters after his black ring had been removed. Black Lantern Lois &quot;sacrifices&quot; herself by removing her ring and giving it to Kal-L, restoring him to full undead status, and causing her own body to become inert.

==In other versions==

Jimmy is finally defeated by Kal-El, who was here raised by an Amish couple until their deaths at Olsen&#x27;s hands, with Lois writing about how Kal-El&#x27;s time with the Kents helped him accept his abilities and grow into the Superman he should have been. In the sequel, &quot;&quot; Lois helps the Kents create Kal-El&#x27;s &#x27;Clark&#x27; disguise- albeit naming him &#x27;Carl&#x27; on impulse- to give him a chance at a normal life outside of his role as Superman, reasoning that the simplicity of the glasses will stop people paying too much attention to him, while their original plan to completely cover him with a false beard would make people suspect that Kal-El had something to hide.

<text>A linker or link editor is a computer program that combines intermediate software build files such as object and library files into a single executable file such a program or library. A linker is often part of a toolchain that includes a compiler and/or assembler that generates intermediate files that the linker processes. The linker may be integrated with other toolchain tools such that the user does not interact with the linker directly.

A simpler version that writes its output directly to memory is called the &quot;loader&quot;, though loading is typically considered a separate process.

== Overview ==
Computer programs typically are composed of several parts or modules; these parts/modules do not need to be contained within a single object file, and in such cases refer to each other using symbols as addresses into other modules, which are mapped into memory addresses when linked for execution.

While the process of linking is meant to ultimately combine these independent parts, there are many good reasons to develop those separately at the source-level. Among these reasons are the ease of organizing several smaller pieces over a monolithic whole and the ability to better define the purpose and responsibilities of each individual piece, which is essential for managing complexity and increasing long-term maintainability in software architecture. 

Typically, an object file can contain three kinds of symbols:

* defined &quot;external&quot; symbols, sometimes called &quot;public&quot; or &quot;entry&quot; symbols, which allow it to be called by other modules,
* undefined &quot;external&quot; symbols, which reference other modules where these symbols are defined, and
* local symbols, used internally within the object file to facilitate relocation.

For most compilers, each object file is the result of compiling one input source code file. When a program comprises multiple object files, the linker combines these files into a unified executable program, resolving the symbols as it goes along.

Linkers can take objects from a collection called a library or runtime library. Most linkers do not include all the object files in a static library in the output executable; they include only those object files from the library that are referenced by other object files or libraries directly or indirectly. But for a shared library, the entire library has to be loaded during runtime as it is not known which functions or methods will be called during runtime. Library linking may thus be an iterative process, with some referenced modules requiring additional modules to be linked, and so on. Libraries exist for diverse purposes, and one or more system libraries are usually linked in by default.

The linker also takes care of arranging the objects in a program&#x27;s address space. This may involve &quot;relocating&quot; code that assumes a specific base address into another base. Since a compiler seldom knows where an object will reside, it often assumes a fixed base location (for example, zero). Relocating machine code may involve re-targeting absolute jumps, loads, and stores.

The executable output by the linker may need another relocation pass when it is finally loaded into memory (just before execution). This pass is usually omitted on hardware offering virtual memory: every program is put into its own address space, so there is no conflict even if all programs load at the same base address. This pass may also be omitted if the executable is a position independent executable.

Additionally, in some operating systems, the same program handles both the jobs of linking and loading a program (dynamic linking).

== Dynamic linking ==
Many operating system environments allow dynamic linking, deferring the resolution of some undefined symbols until a program is run. That means that the executable code still contains undefined symbols, plus a list of objects or libraries that will provide definitions for these. Loading the program will load these objects/libraries as well, and perform a final linking.

This approach offers two advantages:

* Often-used libraries (for example the standard system libraries) need to be stored in only one location, not duplicated in every single executable file, thus saving limited memory and disk space.
* If a bug in a library function is corrected by replacing the library or performance is improved, all programs using it dynamically will benefit from the correction after restarting them. Programs that included this function by static linking would have to be re-linked first.

There are also disadvantages:

* Known on the Windows platform as &quot;DLL hell&quot;, an incompatible updated library will break executables that depended on the behavior of the previous version of the library if the newer version is not correctly backward compatible.
* A program, together with the libraries it uses, might be certified (e.g. as to correctness, documentation requirements, or performance) as a package, but not if components can be replaced (this also argues against automatic OS updates in critical systems; in both cases, the OS and libraries form part of a &quot;qualified&quot; environment).
Contained or virtual environments may further allow system administrators to mitigate or trade-off these individual pros and cons.

== Static linking ==
Static linking is the result of the linker copying all library routines used in the program into the executable image. This may require more disk space and memory than dynamic linking, but is more portable, since it does not require the presence of the library on the system where it runs. Static linking also prevents &quot;DLL hell&quot;, since each program includes exactly the versions of library routines that it requires, with no conflict with other programs. A program using just a few routines from a library does not require the entire library to be installed.

== Relocation ==
As the compiler has no information on the layout of objects in the final output, it cannot take advantage of shorter or more efficient instructions that place a requirement on the address of another object. For example, a jump instruction can reference an absolute address or an offset from the current location, and the offset could be expressed with different lengths depending on the distance to the target. By first generating the most conservative instruction (usually the largest relative or absolute variant, depending on platform) and adding &quot;relaxation hints&quot;, it is possible to substitute shorter or more efficient instructions during the final link. In regard to jump optimizations this is also called &quot;automatic jump-sizing&quot;. This step can be performed only after all input objects have been read and assigned temporary addresses; the linker relaxation pass subsequently reassigns addresses, which may in turn allow more potential relaxations to occur. In general, the substituted sequences are shorter, which allows this process to always converge on the best solution given a fixed order of objects; if this is not the case, relaxations can conflict, and the linker needs to weigh the advantages of either option.

While instruction relaxation typically occurs at link-time, inner-module relaxation can already take place as part of the optimizing process at compile-time. In some cases, relaxation can also occur at load-time as part of the relocation process or combined with dynamic dead-code elimination techniques.

== Linkage editor ==
In IBM System/360 through IBM Z mainframe operating systems such as OS/360 and its successors, this type of program is known as a &quot;linkage editor&quot;. As the name implies a linkage &quot;editor&quot; has the additional capability of allowing the addition, replacement, and/or deletion of individual program sections. Operating systems such as OS/360 have format for executable load-modules containing supplementary data about the component sections of a program, so that an individual program section can be replaced, and other parts of the program updated so that relocatable addresses and other references can be corrected by the linkage editor, as part of the process.

One advantage of this is that it allows a program to be maintained without having to keep all of the intermediate object files, or without having to re-compile program sections that haven&#x27;t changed. It also permits program updates to be distributed in the form of small files (originally card decks), containing only the object module to be replaced. In such systems, object code is in the form and format of 80-byte punched-card images, so that updates can be introduced into a system using that medium. In later releases of OS/360 and in subsequent systems, load-modules contain additional data about versions of components modules, to create a traceable record of updates. It also allows one to add, change, or remove an overlay structure from an already linked load module.

The term &quot;linkage editor&quot; should not be construed as implying that the program operates in a user-interactive mode like a text editor. It is intended for batch-mode execution, with the editing commands being supplied by the user in sequentially organized files, such as punched cards, DASD, or magnetic tape.

&quot;Linkage editing&quot; (IBM nomenclature) or &quot;consolidation&quot; or &quot;collection&quot; (ICL nomenclature) refers to the &quot;linkage editor&#x27;s&quot; or &quot;consolidator&#x27;s&quot; act of combining the various pieces into a relocatable binary, whereas the loading and relocation into an absolute binary at the target address is normally considered a separate step.

== Linker control scripts ==
In the beginning linkers gave users very limited control over the arrangement of generated output object files. As the target systems became complex with different memory requirements such as embedded systems, it became necessary to give users control to generate output object files with their specific requirements such as defining base addresses&#x27; of segments. Linkers control scripts were used for this.

== Implementations ==

Notable implementations:

=== Unix &amp; Unix-like ===
On Unix and Unix-like systems, the static linker is usually invoked via the command codice_1 which is an abbreviation of &quot;LoaDer&quot; or &quot;Link eDitor&quot;. The term &quot;loader&quot; was used to describe the process of loading external symbols from other programs during the process of linking.

For example, on SINTRAN III, linking (assembling object files into a program) was called &quot;loading&quot; as in loading executable code onto a file. 

=== GNU ===
GNU ld, part of the GNU Binary Utilities (binutils), is the GNU Project version of the Unix static linker. A &quot;linker script&quot; may be passed to GNU ld to exercise fine grain control of the linking process. Two versions of ld are provided in binutils: the traditional GNU ld based on bfd, and a streamlined ELF-only version called gold.

The LLVM project&#x27;s linker, &quot;&quot;, is designed to be drop-in compatible, and may be used directly with the GNU compiler. Another drop-in replacement, mold, is a highly parallelized and faster alternative which is also supported by GNU tools.

<doc id="18567" wikidata="Q748339" url="?curid=18567" title="Legendre symbol">
<text>In number theory, the Legendre symbol is a multiplicative function with values 1, −1, 0 that is a quadratic character modulo of an odd prime number &quot;p&quot;: its value at a (nonzero) quadratic residue mod &quot;p&quot; is 1 and at a non-quadratic residue (&quot;non-residue&quot;) is −1. Its value at zero is 0.

The Legendre symbol was introduced by Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1797 or 1798 in the course of his attempts at proving the law of quadratic reciprocity. Generalizations of the symbol include the Jacobi symbol and Dirichlet characters of higher order. The notational convenience of the Legendre symbol inspired introduction of several other &quot;symbols&quot; used in algebraic number theory, such as the Hilbert symbol and the Artin symbol.

== Definition ==
Let formula_1 be an odd prime number. An integer formula_2 is a quadratic residue modulo formula_1 if it is congruent to a perfect square modulo formula_1 and is a quadratic nonresidue modulo formula_1 otherwise. The Legendre symbol is a function of formula_2 and formula_1 defined as
:formula_8

Legendre&#x27;s original definition was by means of the explicit formula
:formula_9

By Euler&#x27;s criterion, which had been discovered earlier and was known to Legendre, these two definitions are equivalent. Thus Legendre&#x27;s contribution lay in introducing a convenient &quot;notation&quot; that recorded quadratic residuosity of &quot;a&quot; mod &quot;p&quot;. For the sake of comparison, Gauss used the notation &quot;a&quot;R&quot;p&quot;, &quot;a&quot;N&quot;p&quot; according to whether &quot;a&quot; is a residue or a non-residue modulo &quot;p&quot;. For typographical convenience, the Legendre symbol is sometimes written as (&quot;a&quot; | &quot;p&quot;) or (&quot;a&quot;/&quot;p&quot;). For fixed &quot;p&quot;, the sequence formula_10 is periodic with period &quot;p&quot; and is sometimes called the Legendre sequence. Each row in the following table exhibits periodicity, just as described.

== Table of values ==
The following is a table of values of Legendre symbol formula_11 with &quot;p&quot; ≤ 127, &quot;a&quot; ≤ 30, &quot;p&quot; odd prime.

== Properties of the Legendre symbol ==
There are a number of useful properties of the Legendre symbol which, together with the law of quadratic reciprocity, can be used to compute it efficiently.

* Given a generator formula_12, if formula_13, then formula_14 is a quadratic residue if and only if formula_15 is even. This shows that half of the elements in formula_16 are quadratic residues.
* If formula_17 then the fact that 
*:formula_18 gives us that formula_19 is a square root of the quadratic residue formula_14.
* The Legendre symbol is periodic in its first (or top) argument: if &quot;a&quot; ≡ &quot;b&quot; (mod &quot;p&quot;), then 
*:formula_21
* The Legendre symbol is a completely multiplicative function of its top argument:
*:formula_22 
* In particular, the product of two numbers that are both quadratic residues or quadratic non-residues modulo &quot;p&quot; is a residue, whereas the product of a residue with a non-residue is a non-residue. A special case is the Legendre symbol of a square:
*:formula_23
* When viewed as a function of &quot;a&quot;, the Legendre symbol formula_24 is the unique quadratic (or order 2) Dirichlet character modulo &quot;p&quot;.
* The first supplement to the law of quadratic reciprocity:
*:formula_25
* The second supplement to the law of quadratic reciprocity:
*:formula_26
* Special formulas for the Legendre symbol formula_24 for small values of &quot;a&quot;:
** For an odd prime &quot;p&quot; ≠ 3, 
**:formula_28
** For an odd prime &quot;p&quot; ≠ 5, 
**:formula_29
* The Fibonacci numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ... are defined by the recurrence If &quot;p&quot; is a prime number then
*:formula_30 
:For example, 
::formula_31 
* This result comes from the theory of Lucas sequences, which are used in primality testing. See Wall–Sun–Sun prime.

== Legendre symbol and quadratic reciprocity ==
Let &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; be distinct odd primes. Using the Legendre symbol, the quadratic reciprocity law can be stated concisely:

: formula_32

Many proofs of quadratic reciprocity are based on Euler&#x27;s criterion

:formula_33

In addition, several alternative expressions for the Legendre symbol were devised in order to produce various proofs of the quadratic reciprocity law.

* Gauss introduced the quadratic Gauss sum and used the formula

::formula_34

:in his fourth and sixth proofs of quadratic reciprocity.

* Kronecker&#x27;s proof first establishes that

::formula_35

: Reversing the roles of &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;, he obtains the relation between () and ().

* One of Eisenstein&#x27;s proofs begins by showing that

::formula_36

: Using certain elliptic functions instead of the sine function, Eisenstein was able to prove cubic and quartic reciprocity as well.

== Related functions ==
* The Jacobi symbol () is a generalization of the Legendre symbol that allows for a composite second (bottom) argument &quot;n&quot;, although &quot;n&quot; must still be odd and positive. This generalization provides an efficient way to compute all Legendre symbols without performing factorization along the way.
* A further extension is the Kronecker symbol, in which the bottom argument may be any integer.
* The power residue symbol () generalizes the Legendre symbol to higher power &quot;n&quot;. The Legendre symbol represents the power residue symbol for &quot;n&quot; = 2.

== Computational example ==
The above properties, including the law of quadratic reciprocity, can be used to evaluate any Legendre symbol. For example:

:formula_37

Or using a more efficient computation:
:formula_38
The article Jacobi symbol has more examples of Legendre symbol manipulation.

Since no efficient factorization algorithm is known, but efficient modular exponentiation algorithms are, in general it is more efficient to use Legendre&#x27;s original definition, e.g.

:formula_39

using repeated squaring modulo 331, reducing every value using the modulus after every operation to avoid computation with large integers.

<text>The &quot;Laconia&quot; incident was a series of events surrounding the sinking of a British passenger ship in the Atlantic Ocean on 12 September 1942, during World War II, and a subsequent aerial attack on German and Italian submarines involved in rescue attempts. , carrying 2,732 crew, passengers, soldiers, and prisoners of war, was torpedoed and sunk by , a German U-boat, off the West African coast. Operating partly under the dictates of the old prize rules, the U-boat&#x27;s commander, Werner Hartenstein, immediately commenced rescue operations. &quot;U-156&quot; broadcast her position on open radio channels to all Allied powers nearby, and was joined by several other U-boats in the vicinity.

After surfacing and picking up survivors, who were accommodated on the foredeck, &quot;U-156&quot; headed on the surface under Red Cross banners to rendezvous with Vichy French ships and transfer the survivors. En route, the U-boat was spotted by a B-24 Liberator bomber of the US Army Air Forces. The aircrew, having reported the U-boat&#x27;s location, declared intentions, and the presence of survivors, were then ordered to attack the sub. The B-24 killed dozens of &quot;Laconia&quot;″s survivors with bombs and strafing attacks, forcing &quot;U-156&quot; to cast into the sea the remaining survivors that she had rescued and crash dive to avoid being destroyed.

Rescue operations were continued by other vessels. Another U-boat, , was also attacked by US aircraft and forced to dive. A total of 976 to 1,083 people were eventually rescued; however, 1,658 to 1,757 were killed, mostly Italian POWs. The event changed the general attitude of Germany&#x27;s naval personnel towards rescuing stranded Allied seamen. The commanders of the were quickly issued the Laconia Order by Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, which specifically forbade any such attempt and ushered in unrestricted submarine warfare for the remainder of the war.

The B-24 pilots mistakenly reported they had sunk , and were awarded medals for bravery. Neither the US pilots nor their commander were punished or investigated, and the matter was quietly forgotten by the US military. During the later Nuremberg trials, a prosecutor attempted to cite the Laconia Order as proof of war crimes by Dönitz and his submariners. The ploy backfired, causing much embarrassment to the United States after the incident&#x27;s full report had emerged to the public and the reason for the &quot;Laconia order&quot; was known.

== RMS &quot;Laconia&quot; ==
 was built in 1921 as a civilian ocean liner by Swan, Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson Ltd, Wallsend, Northumberland. In January 1923 Laconia began the first around-the-world cruise, which lasted 130 days and called at 22 ports. On 8 September 1925, Laconia collided with the British schooner Lucia P. Dow in the Atlantic Ocean east of Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States. Laconia towed the schooner for before handing the tow over to the American tug Resolute. In 1934, her code letters were changed to GJCD.[5] On 24 September 1934 Laconia was involved in a collision off the US coast, while travelling from Boston to New York in dense fog. It rammed into the port side of Pan Royal, a US freighter. [6] Both ships suffered serious damage but were able to proceed under their own steam. Laconia returned to New York for repairs, and resumed cruising in 1935. During World War II she was requisitioned for the war effort, and by 1942 had been converted into a troopship. At the time of the incident she was transporting mostly Italian prisoners of war from Cape Town to Freetown, under the command of Captain Rudolph Sharp. The ship was carrying 463 officers and crew, 87 civilians, 286 British soldiers, 1,793 Italian prisoners and 103 Polish soldiers acting as guards of the prisoners.

Sharp had previously commanded , which had been sunk by German bombs on 17 June 1940, off the French port of Saint-Nazaire, while taking part in Operation Aerial, the evacuation of British nationals and troops from France, two weeks after the Dunkirk evacuation.

== Events ==
=== Attack on &quot;Laconia&quot; ===

At 10 p.m., on 12 September 1942, was on patrol off the coast of western Africa, midway between Liberia and Ascension Island. The submarine&#x27;s commanding officer, Werner Hartenstein, spotted the large British ship sailing alone and attacked it. Armed ships, which meant most merchantmen and troop transport, constituted legitimate targets for attack without warning. Armed as such, the &quot;Laconia&quot; fell into this category, and at 10:22 p.m. she transmitted a message on the 600 m (500 kHz) band: &quot;SSS SSS 0434 South / 1125 West Laconia torpedoed.&quot; &quot;SSS&quot; was the code signifying &quot;under attack by submarine&quot;. Additional messages were transmitted, but there is no record these were received by any other vessel or station.

Although there were sufficient lifeboats for the entire ship&#x27;s complement, including the Italian prisoners, heavy listing prevented half from being launched until the vessel had settled. The prisoners were abandoned in the locked cargo holds as the ship sank, but most managed to escape by breaking down hatches or climbing up ventilation shafts. Several were shot when a group of prisoners rushed a lifeboat, and a large number were bayoneted to death to prevent their boarding of one of the few lifeboats available. The Polish guards were armed with rifles with fixed bayonets; however, they were not loaded and the guards carried no ammunition. Witnesses indicate that few of the prisoners were shot. Instead, most of the casualties were bayoneted.

By the time the last lifeboats were launched most survivors had already entered the water, so some lifeboats had few passengers. Only one life raft left the ship with prisoners on board; the rest jumped into the ocean. Survivors later recounted how Italians in the water were either shot or had their hands severed by axes if they tried to climb into a lifeboat. The blood soon attracted sharks. Corporal Dino Monte, one of the few Italian survivors, stated &quot;… sharks darted among us. Grabbing an arm, biting a leg. Other larger beasts swallowed entire bodies.&quot; As &quot;Laconia&quot; was going under, bow first, &quot;U-156&quot; surfaced to capture the ship&#x27;s surviving senior officers. To their surprise, they saw over 2,000 people struggling in the water.

=== Rescue operation ===
Realising that the passengers were primarily POWs and civilians, Hartenstein immediately began rescue operations whilst flying the Red Cross flag. &quot;Laconia&quot; sank at 11:23 p.m., over an hour after the attack. At 1:25 a.m. on 13 September, Hartenstein sent a coded radio message to the alerting them to the situation. It read: &quot;Sunk by Hartenstein, British Laconia, Qu FF7721, 310 deg. Unfortunately with 1,500 Italian POWs; 90 fished out of the water so far. Request orders.&quot;

The head of submarine operations, Admiral Karl Dönitz, immediately ordered seven U-boats from the wolfpack Eisbär, which had been gathering to take part in a planned surprise attack on Cape Town, to divert to the scene to pick up survivors. Dönitz then informed Berlin of the situation and actions he had taken. Hitler was furious and ordered that the rescue be abandoned. Admiral Erich Raeder ordered Dönitz to disengage the Eisbär boats, which included Hartenstein&#x27;s &quot;U-156&quot;, and send them to Cape Town as per the original plan. Raeder then ordered , commanded by Erich Würdemann, , under &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; Harro Schacht, and the Italian submarine to intercept Hartenstein to take on his survivors and then to proceed to the &quot;Laconia&quot; site and rescue any Italians they could find. Raeder also requested the Vichy French to send warships from Dakar and Ivory Coast to collect the Italian survivors from the three submarines.

The Vichy French, in response, sent the 7,600-ton cruiser from Dakar, and two sloops, the fast 660-ton &quot;Annamite&quot; and the slower 2,000-ton , from Conakry, French Guinea, and Cotonou, Dahomey, respectively. Dönitz disengaged the Eisbär boats and informed Hartenstein of Raeder&#x27;s orders, but he substituted &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Helmut Witte&#x27;s for &quot;U-156&quot; in the Eisbär group and sent the order: &quot;All boats, including Hartenstein, only take as many men into the boat as will allow it to be fully ready for action when submerged.&quot;

&quot;U-156&quot; was soon crammed above and below decks with nearly 200 survivors, including five women, and had another 200 in tow aboard four lifeboats. At 6 a.m. on 13 September, Hartenstein broadcast an uncoded message in English on the band to all shipping in the area, giving his position, requesting assistance with the rescue effort, and promising not to attack. It read: &quot;If any ship will assist the shipwrecked Laconia crew I will not attack her, providing I am not being attacked by ship or air force. I picked up 193 men. 4°-53” South, 11°-26” West. – German submarine.&quot;

The British in Freetown intercepted this message but, believing it might be a ruse of war, refused to credit it. Two days later, on 15 September, a message was passed to the Americans that &quot;Laconia&quot; had been torpedoed and the British merchant ship was en route to pick up survivors. The &quot;poorly composed message&quot; implied that &quot;Laconia&quot; had only been sunk that day and made no mention that the Germans were involved in a rescue attempt under a cease-fire or that neutral French ships were also en route.

&quot;U-156&quot; remained on the surface at the scene for the next two-and-a-half days. At 11:30 a.m. on 15 September, she was joined by &quot;U-506&quot;, and a few hours later by both and the &quot;Comandante Cappellini&quot;. The four submarines, with lifeboats in tow and hundreds of survivors standing on their decks, headed for the African coastline and a rendezvous with the Vichy French surface warships that had set out from Senegal and Dahomey.

=== First American attack ===
During the night the submarines became separated. On 16 September at 11:25 a.m., &quot;U-156&quot; was spotted by an American B-24 Liberator bomber flying from a secret airbase on Ascension. The submarine was travelling with a Red Cross flag draped across her gun deck. Hartenstein signalled to the pilot in both Morse code and English requesting assistance. A British officer also messaged the aircraft: &quot;RAF officer speaking from German submarine, &quot;Laconia&quot; survivors on board, soldiers, civilians, women, children.&quot;

Lieutenant James D. Harden of the US Army Air Forces did not respond to the messages; turning away, he notified his base of the situation. The senior officer on duty that day, Captain Robert C. Richardson III, who claimed that he did not know that this was a Red Cross-sanctioned German rescue operation, ordered the B-24 to &quot;sink the sub&quot;. Richardson later claimed he believed that the rules of war at the time did not permit a combat ship to fly Red Cross flags. He feared that the German submarine would attack the two Allied freighters diverted by the British to the site. He assumed that the German submarine was rescuing only the Italian POWs. In his tactical assessment, he believed that the submarine might discover and shell the secret Ascension airfield and fuel tanks, thus cutting off a critical Allied resupply air route to British forces in Egypt and Soviet forces in Russia.

Harden flew back to the scene of the rescue effort and, at 12:32 p.m., attacked with bombs and depth charges. One landed among the lifeboats in tow behind &quot;U-156&quot;, killing dozens of survivors, while others straddled the submarine itself, causing minor damage. Hartenstein cast adrift those lifeboats still afloat and ordered the survivors on his deck into the water. The submarine submerged slowly to give those still on the deck a chance to get into the water and escape. According to Harden&#x27;s report, he made four runs at the submarine. On the first three the depth charges and bombs failed to release, on the fourth he dropped two bombs. The crew of the Liberator were later awarded medals for the alleged sinking of &quot;U-156&quot;, when they had in fact only sunk two lifeboats.

Ignoring Hartenstein&#x27;s request that they stay in the area to be rescued by the Vichy French, two lifeboats decided to head for Africa. One, which began the journey with 68 people on board, reached the African coast 27 days later with only 16 survivors. The other was rescued by a British trawler after 40 days at sea. Only four of its 52 occupants were still alive.

Unaware of the attack, &quot;U-507&quot;, &quot;U-506&quot;, and &quot;Cappellini&quot; continued to pick up survivors. The following morning Commander Revedin of &quot;Cappellini&quot; found that he was rescuing survivors who had been set adrift by &quot;U-156.&quot; At 11:30 a.m. Revedin received the following message: &quot;Bordeaux to Cappellini: Reporting attack already undergone by other submarines. Be ready to submerge for action against the enemy. Put shipwrecked on rafts except women, children, and Italians, and make for minor grid-square 56 of grid-square 0971 where you will land remainder shipwrecked on to French ships. Keep British prisoners. Keep strictest watch enemy planes and submarines. End of message.&quot;

&quot;U-507&quot; and &quot;U-506&quot; received confirmation from headquarters of the attack on &quot;U-156&quot; and were asked for the number of survivors rescued. Commander Schacht of &quot;U-507&quot; replied that he had 491, of whom 15 were women and 16 were children. Commander Wurdemann of &quot;U-506&quot; confirmed 151, including nine women and children. The next message from headquarters ordered them to cast adrift all the British and Polish survivors, mark their positions and instruct them to remain exactly where they were, then proceed with all haste to the rescue rendezvous. The respective commanders chose not to cast any survivors adrift.

The order given by Richardson and the resulting attack by Harden have been called Allied war crimes. Under the conventions of war at sea, ships—including submarines—engaged in rescue operations are held to be immune from attack.

=== Second American attack ===
Five B-25s from Ascension&#x27;s permanent squadron and Hardin&#x27;s B-24 continued to search for submarines from dawn till dusk. On 17 September, one B-25 sighted &quot;Laconia&quot;″s lifeboats and informed &quot;Empire Haven&quot; of their position. Hardin&#x27;s B-24 sighted &quot;U-506&quot;, which had 151 survivors on board including nine women and children, and attacked. On the first run the bombs failed to drop, &quot;U-506&quot; crash dived and on the second run the B-24 dropped two bombs and two depth charges but they caused no damage.

That same day, the British at Freetown sent an ambiguous message to Ascension informing them that three French ships from Dakar were en route. Captain Richardson assumed the French intended to invade Ascension so the submarine hunting was cancelled in order to prepare for an invasion.

The French cruiser picked up 52 survivors, all British, while still from the rendezvous point. &quot;Gloire&quot; then met with the sloop &quot;Annamite&quot; with both meeting &quot;U-507&quot; and &quot;U-506&quot; at the rendezvous point at a little after 2 p.m. on 17 September. With the exception of two British officers kept aboard &quot;U-507,&quot; the survivors were all transferred to the rescue ships. &quot;Gloire&quot; sailed off on her own and within four hours rescued another 11 lifeboats. At 10 p.m., &quot;Gloire&quot; found another lifeboat and proceeded to a planned rendezvous with &quot;Annamite&quot;.

At 1 a.m., a lookout spotted a light on the horizon, which was investigated despite this meaning &quot;Gloire&quot; would not be able to make the rendezvous, and a further 84 survivors were rescued. A new rendezvous was arranged, the ships meeting at 9:30 a.m. with &quot;Annamite&quot; transferring her survivors to &quot;Gloire&quot;. A count was then taken: 373 Italians, 70 Poles and 597 British who included 48 women and children. &quot;Gloire&quot; arrived at Dakar on 21 September to resupply before sailing for Casablanca, arriving there on 25 September. On arrival, Colonel Baldwin, on behalf of all the British survivors, presented the captain of &quot;Cappellini&quot; with a letter that read as follows:

The submarine &quot;Cappellini&quot; had been unable to find the French warships so radioed for instructions and awaited a response. The French sloop &quot;Dumont-d’Urville&quot; was sent to rendezvous with &quot;Cappellini&quot; and by chance rescued a lifeboat from the British cargo ship &quot;Trevilley&quot;, which had been torpedoed on 12 September. After searching for other &quot;Trevilley&quot; survivors without luck, &quot;Dumont-d’Urville&quot; met &quot;Cappellini&quot; on 20 September. With the exception of six Italians and two British officers, the remaining survivors were transferred to &quot;Dumont-d’Urville&quot;, which later transferred the Italians to &quot;Annamite&quot;, which transported them to Dakar on 24 September. Of &quot;Laconia&quot;’s original complement of 2,741, only 1,083 survived. Of the 1,658 who died, 1,420 were Italian POWs. Some estimates put the death toll as 1757.

=== Conclusion ===
From Casablanca, most of the survivors were taken to Mediouna to await transport to a prison camp in Germany. On 8 November, the Allied invasion of North Africa began liberating the survivors, who were taken aboard the ship &quot;Anton&quot; which landed them in the United States.

Doris Hawkins, a missionary nurse, survived the &quot;Laconia&quot; incident and spent 27 days adrift in Lifeboat Nine, finally coming ashore on the coast of Liberia. She was returning to England after five years in Palestine with 14-month-old Sally Kay Readman, who was lost to the sea as they were transferred into the lifeboat.

Doris Hawkins wrote a pamphlet titled &quot;Atlantic Torpedo&quot; after her eventual return to England, published by Victor Gollancz in 1943. In it she writes of the moments when Sally was lost: &quot;We found ourselves on top of the arms and legs of a panic-stricken mass of humanity. The lifeboat, filled to capacity with men, women and children, was leaking badly and rapidly filling with water; at the same time it was crashing against the ship’s side. Just as Sally was passed over to me, the boat filled completely and capsized, flinging us all into the water. I lost her. I did not hear her cry even then, and I am sure that God took her immediately to Himself without suffering. I never saw her again.&quot;

Doris Hawkins was one of 16 survivors (out of 69 in the lifeboat when it was cast adrift from the U-boat). She spent the remaining war years personally visiting the families of people who perished in the lifeboat, returning mementos entrusted to her by them in their dying moments. In Doris&#x27;s words, &quot;It is impossible to imagine why I should have been chosen to survive when so many did not. I have been reluctant to write the story of our experiences, but in answer to many requests I have done so; and if it strengthens someone’s faith, if it is an inspiration to any, if it brings home to others, hitherto untouched, all that &#x27;those who go down to the sea in ships&#x27; face for our sakes, hour by hour, day by day, year in and year out—it will not have been written in vain&quot;.

Survivor Jim McLoughlin states in &quot;One Common Enemy&quot; that after the incident Hartenstein asked him if he was in the Royal Navy, which he was, then why a passenger ship was armed, stating, &quot;If it wasn&#x27;t armed, I would not have attacked.&quot; McLoughlin believes this indicates Hartenstein had thought it was a troop transport rather than a passenger ship; by signalling to the Royal Navy, &quot;Laconia&quot; was acting as a auxiliary ship.

== Aftermath ==

The &quot;Laconia&quot; incident had far-reaching consequences. Up until that point, it was common for U-boats to assist torpedoed survivors with food, water, simple medical care for the wounded, and a compass bearing to the nearest landmass. It was extremely rare for survivors to be brought on board, as space on a U-boat was barely enough for its own crew. On 17 September 1942, in response to the incident, Admiral Karl Dönitz issued an order named &quot;Triton Null&quot;, later known as the Laconia Order. In it, Dönitz prohibited U-boat crews from attempting rescues; survivors were to be left in the sea. Even afterwards, U-boats still occasionally provided aid for survivors.

At the Nuremberg trials held by the Allies in 1946, Dönitz was indicted for war crimes. The issuance of the Laconia Order was the centrepiece of the prosecution case, a decision that backfired badly. Its introduction allowed the defence to recount at length the numerous instances in which German submariners acted with humanity where in similar situations the Allies behaved callously. Dönitz pointed out that the order itself was a direct result of this callousness and the attack by US aircraft on a rescue operation.

The Americans had also practised unrestricted submarine warfare, under their own equivalent to the Laconia Order, which had been in force since they entered the war. Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, the wartime commander-in-chief of the US Pacific Fleet, provided unapologetic written testimony on Dönitz&#x27;s behalf at his trial that the US Navy had waged unrestricted submarine warfare in the Pacific from the very first day the United States entered the war. This testimony led the Nuremberg Tribunal not to impose a sentence upon Dönitz for this breach of law, even though he was convicted of the count.

The Naval War College series International Law Studies covers interpretations of international law during armed conflicts and how these laws were applied by each party. In volume 65, &quot;Targeting Enemy Merchant Shipping&quot;, chapter three contains an examination of the &quot;Laconia&quot; incident in the context of the application of international law to World War II submarine warfare:
Another consequence of the incident was an order by Churchill that in future transports, there were to be no more than 500 prisoners on any one ship.

<doc id="18571" wikidata="Q333265" url="?curid=18571" title="Leon Theremin">
<text>Lev Sergeyevich Termen ( 18963 November 1993), better known as Leon Theremin was a Russian inventor, most famous for his invention of the theremin, one of the first electronic musical instruments and the first to be mass-produced. He also worked on early television research. His secret listening device, &quot;The Thing&quot;, hung for seven years in plain view in the United States ambassador&#x27;s Moscow office and enabled Soviet agents to eavesdrop on secret conversations.

==Early life==
Leon Theremin was born in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire in 1896. His father was Sergei Emilievich Theremin, of French Huguenot descent. His mother was Yevgenia Antonova Orzhinskaya and of German ancestry. He had a sister named Helena.

In the seventh grade of his high school, in front of an audience of students and parents, he demonstrated various optical effects using electricity.

By the age of 17 he was in his last year of high school, had his own laboratory at home for experimenting with high-frequency circuits, optics and magnetic fields. His cousin, Kirill Fedorovich Nesturkh, then a young physicist, invited him to attend the defense of the dissertation of Abram Fedorovich Ioffe. Physics lecturer Vladimir Konstantinovich Lebedinskiy had explained to Theremin the dispute over Ioffe&#x27;s work on the electron. On 9 May 1913 Theremin and his cousin attended Ioffe&#x27;s dissertation defense. Ioffe&#x27;s subject was on the elementary photoelectric effect, the magnetic field of cathode rays and related investigations. In 1917 Theremin wrote that Ioffe talked of electrons, the photoelectric effect and magnetic fields as parts of an objective reality that surrounds us every day, unlike others that talked more of somewhat abstract formulae and symbols. Theremin wrote that he found this explanation revelatory and that it fit a scientific – not abstract – view of the world, different scales of magnitude, and matter. From then on Theremin endeavoured to study the microcosm, in the same way he had studied the macrocosm with his hand-built telescope. Later, Kyrill introduced Theremin to Ioffe as a young experimenter and physicist, and future student of the university.

Theremin recalled that while still in his last year of school, he had built a million-volt Tesla coil and noticed a strong glow associated with his attempts to ionize the air. He then wished to further investigate the effects using university resources. A chance meeting with Abram Fedorovich Ioffe led to a recommendation to see Karl Karlovich Baumgart, who was in charge of the physics laboratory equipment. Karl then reserved a room and equipment for Theremin&#x27;s experiments. Abram Fedorovich suggested Theremin also look at methods of creating gas fluorescence under different conditions and of examining the resulting light&#x27;s spectrum. However, during these investigations Theremin was called up for World War I military service.

==World War I and Russian Civil War==
Although only in his second academic year, the deanery of the Faculty of Physics and Astronomy recommended that Theremin go to the Nikolayevska Military Engineering School in Petrograd (previously Saint Petersburg), which usually only accepted students in their fourth year. Theremin recalled that Ioffe reassured him that the war would not last long and that military experience would be useful for scientific applications.

Beginning his military service in 1916, Theremin finished the Military Engineering School in six months, progressed through the Graduate Electronic School for Officers, and attained the military radio-engineer diploma in the same year. In the course of the next three and a half years he oversaw the construction of a radio station in Saratov to connect the Volga area with Moscow, graduated from Petrograd University, became deputy leader of the new Military Radiotechnical Laboratory in Moscow, and finished as the broadcast supervisor of the radio transmitter at &quot;Tsarskoye Selo&quot; near Petrograd (then renamed &quot;Detskoye Selo&quot;).

During the Russian Civil War, in October 1919 White Army commander Nikolai Nikolayevich Yudenich advanced on Petrograd from the side of &quot;Detskoye Selo&quot;, apparently intending to capture the radio station to announce a victory over the Bolsheviks. Theremin and others evacuated the station, sending equipment east on rail cars. Theremin then detonated explosives to destroy the 120-meter-high antenna mast before traveling to Petrograd to set up an international listening station. There he also trained radio specialists but reported difficulties obtaining food and working with foreign experts whom he described as narrow-minded pessimists.

Theremin recalled that on an evening when his hopes of overcoming these obstructing experts reached a low ebb, Abram Fedorovich Ioffe telephoned him. Ioffe asked Theremin to come to his newly founded Physical Technical Institute in Petrograd, and the next day he invited him to start work at developing measuring methods for high-frequency electrical oscillations.

==Under Ioffe==
The day after Ioffe&#x27;s invitation, Theremin started at the institute. He worked in diverse fields: applying the Laue effect to the new field of X-ray analysis of crystals, using hypnosis to improve measurement-reading accuracy, working with Ivan Pavlov&#x27;s laboratory, and using gas-filled lamps as measuring devices. He built a high-frequency oscillator to measure the dielectric constant of gases with high precision; Ioffe then urged him to look for other applications using this method, and shortly made the first motion detector for use as a &quot;radio watchman&quot;.

While adapting the dielectric device by adding circuitry to generate an audio tone, Theremin noticed that the pitch changed when his hand moved around. In October 1920 he first demonstrated this to Ioffe who called in other professors and students to hear. Theremin recalled trying to find the notes for tunes he remembered from when he played the cello, such as The Swan, by Saint-Saëns. By November 1920, Theremin had given his first public concert with the instrument, now modified with a horizontal volume antenna replacing the earlier foot-operated volume control. He named it the &quot;etherphone&quot;, but it was known in the Soviet Union as the or , in Germany as the and later, in the USA, as the &quot;theremin.&quot;

On 24 May 1924 Theremin married 20-year-old Katia () Konstantinova, and they lived together in his parents&#x27; apartment on Marat street. In 1925 Theremin went to Germany to sell both the radio watchman and Termenvox patents to the German firm Goldberg and Sons. According to Glinsky, this was the Soviet&#x27;s &quot;decoy for capitalists&quot; to obtain both Western profits from sales and technical knowledge.

During that time Theremin was also working on a wireless television with 16 scan lines in 1925, improving to 32 scan lines and then 64 using interlacing in 1926, and he demonstrated moving, if blurry, images on 7 June 1927. His device was the first functioning television apparatus in Russia.

==United States==

After being sent on a lengthy tour of Europe starting 1927–including London, Paris, and towns in Germany – during which he demonstrated his invention to full audiences, Theremin went to the United States arriving on 30 December 1927 with his first wife Katia. He performed the theremin with the New York Philharmonic in 1928. He patented his invention in the United States in 1928 and then granted commercial production rights to RCA.

Theremin set up a laboratory in New York in the 1930s, where he further refined the theremin and experimented with other inventions and new electronic musical instruments. These included the Rhythmicon commissioned by the composer Henry Cowell.

In 1930, ten thereminists performed on stage at Carnegie Hall. Two years later, Theremin conducted the first-ever electronic orchestra, featuring the theremin and other electronic instruments including a &quot;fingerboard&quot; theremin which resembled a cello in use (Theremin was a cellist). In 1931, he worked with composer Henry Cowell to build an instrument called the rhythmicon. They were lucky to have gotten it to market as quickly as they did as brothers Otto and Benjamin Miessner had almost completed a similar instrument with the same name.

Theremin&#x27;s mentors during this time were some of society&#x27;s foremost scientists, composers, and musical theorists including composer Joseph Schillinger and physicist (and amateur violinist) Albert Einstein. At the time, Theremin worked closely with fellow Soviet émigré and theremin virtuoso Clara Rockmore (née Reisenberg). Theremin had several times 
proposed to her, but she chose to marry attorney Robert Rockmore, and thereafter used his name professionally.

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons hired Theremin to build a metal detector for Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary. He was interested in a role for the theremin in dance music. He developed performance locations that could automatically react to dancers&#x27; movements with varied patterns of sound and light.

The Soviet consulate had apparently demanded he divorce Katia. Afterwards, while working with the American Negro Ballet Company, the inventor married a young African-American prima ballerina Lavinia Williams. Their marriage caused shock and disapproval in his social circles, but the ostracized couple remained together.

==Return to the Soviet Union==
Theremin abruptly returned to the Soviet Union in 1938. At the time, the reasons for his return were unclear; some claimed that he was homesick, while others believed that he had been kidnapped by Soviet officials. Beryl Campbell, one of Theremin&#x27;s dancers, said his wife Lavinia &quot;called to say that he had been kidnapped from his studio&quot; and that &quot;some Russians had come in&quot; and that she felt that he was going to be spirited out of the country.

Many years later, it was revealed that Theremin had returned to his native land due to tax and financial difficulties in the United States. However, Theremin himself once told Bulat Galeyev that he decided to leave himself because he was anxious about the approaching war. Shortly after he returned he was imprisoned in the Butyrka prison and later sent to work in the Kolyma gold mines. Although rumors of his execution were widely circulated and published, Theremin was put to work in a &quot;sharashka&quot; (a secret laboratory in the Gulag camp system), together with Andrei Tupolev, Sergei Korolev and other well-known scientists and engineers. The Soviet Union said he was rehabilitated, closing its case against him in 1956.

==Espionage==

During his work at the &quot;sharashka&quot;, where he was put in charge of other workers, Theremin created the Buran eavesdropping system. A precursor to the modern laser microphone, it worked by using a low-power infrared beam from a distance to detect sound vibrations in glass windows. Lavrentiy Beria, the head of the secret police organization NKVD (the predecessor of the KGB), used the Buran device to spy on the British, French and US embassies in Moscow. According to Galeyev, Beria also spied on Stalin; Theremin kept some of the tapes in his flat. In 1947, Theremin was awarded the Stalin prize for inventing this advance in Soviet espionage technology.

Theremin invented another listening device called The Thing, hidden in a replica of the Great Seal of the United States carved in wood. In 1945, Soviet school children presented the concealed bug to the U.S. Ambassador as a &quot;gesture of friendship&quot; to the USSR&#x27;s World War II ally. It hung in the ambassador’s residential office in Moscow and intercepted confidential conversations there during the first seven years of the Cold War, until it was accidentally discovered in 1952.

==Later life==

After his release from the &quot;sharashka&quot; in 1947, Theremin volunteered to remain working with the KGB until 1966. By 1947 he had remarried, to Maria Guschina, his third wife, and they had two children: Lena and Natalia.

Theremin worked at the Moscow Conservatory of Music for 10 years where he taught, and built theremins, electronic cellos and some terpsitones (another invention of Theremin). There he was discovered by Harold Schonberg, the chief music critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who was visiting the Conservatory. But when an article by Schonberg appeared mentioning Theremin, the Conservatory&#x27;s Managing Director declared that &quot;electricity is not good for music; electricity is to be used for electrocution&quot; and had his instruments removed from the Conservatory. Further electronic music projects were banned, and Theremin was summarily dismissed.

In the 1970s, Leon Theremin was a Professor of Physics at Moscow State University (Department of Acoustics) developing his inventions and supervising graduate students.

After 51 years in the Soviet Union, Theremin started traveling, first visiting France in June 1989 and then the United States in 1991, each time accompanied by his daughter Natalia. Theremin was brought to New York by filmmaker Steven M. Martin where he was reunited with Clara Rockmore. He also made a demonstration concert at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague in early 1993 before dying in Moscow on Wednesday 3 November 1993 at the age of 97.

<text>Linear prediction is a mathematical operation where future values of a discrete-time signal are estimated as a linear function of previous samples.

In digital signal processing, linear prediction is often called linear predictive coding (LPC) and can thus be viewed as a subset of filter theory. In system analysis, a subfield of mathematics, linear prediction can be viewed as a part of mathematical modelling or optimization.

== The prediction model ==
The most common representation is

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the predicted signal value, formula_3 the previous observed values, with formula_4, and formula_5 the predictor coefficients. The error generated by this estimate is

:formula_6

where formula_7 is the true signal value.

These equations are valid for all types of (one-dimensional) linear prediction. The differences are found in the way the predictor coefficients formula_5 are chosen.

For multi-dimensional signals the error metric is often defined as

:formula_9

where formula_10 is a suitable chosen vector norm. Predictions such as formula_2 are routinely used within Kalman filters and smoothers to estimate current and past signal values, respectively, from noisy measurements.

=== Estimating the parameters ===
The most common choice in optimization of parameters formula_5 is the root mean square criterion which is also called the autocorrelation criterion. In this method we minimize the expected value of the squared error formula_13, which yields the equation

:formula_14

for 1 ≤ &quot;j&quot; ≤ &quot;p&quot;, where &quot;R&quot; is the autocorrelation of signal &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;, defined as

:formula_15,

and &quot;E&quot; is the expected value. In the multi-dimensional case this corresponds to minimizing the L2 norm.

The above equations are called the normal equations or Yule-Walker equations. In matrix form the equations can be equivalently written as

:formula_16

where the autocorrelation matrix formula_17 is a symmetric, formula_18 Toeplitz matrix with elements formula_19 is the autocorrelation vector formula_20, and formula_21, the parameter vector.

Another, more general, approach is to minimize the sum of squares of the errors defined in the form

:formula_22

where the optimisation problem searching over all formula_5 must now be constrained with formula_24.

On the other hand, if the mean square prediction error is constrained to be unity and the prediction error equation is included on top of the normal equations, the augmented set of equations is obtained as

:formula_25

where the index formula_26 ranges from 0 to formula_27, and formula_17 is a formula_29 matrix.

Specification of the parameters of the linear predictor is a wide topic and a large number of other approaches have been proposed. In fact, the autocorrelation method is the most common and it is used, for example, for speech coding in the GSM standard.

Solution of the matrix equation formula_16 is computationally a relatively expensive process. The Gaussian elimination for matrix inversion is probably the oldest solution but this approach does not efficiently use the symmetry of formula_17. A faster algorithm is the Levinson recursion proposed by Norman Levinson in 1947, which recursively calculates the solution. In particular, the autocorrelation equations above may be more efficiently solved by the Durbin algorithm.

In 1986, Philippe Delsarte and Y.V. Genin proposed an improvement to this algorithm called the split Levinson recursion, which requires about half the number of multiplications and divisions. It uses a special symmetrical property of parameter vectors on subsequent recursion levels. That is, calculations for the optimal predictor containing formula_27 terms make use of similar calculations for the optimal predictor containing formula_33 terms.

Another way of identifying model parameters is to iteratively calculate state estimates using Kalman filters and obtaining maximum likelihood estimates within expectation–maximization algorithms.

For equally-spaced values, a polynomial interpolation is a linear combination of the known values. If the discrete time signal is estimated to obey a polynomial of degree formula_34 then the predictor coefficients formula_5 are given by the corresponding row of the triangle of binomial transform coefficients. This estimate might be suitable for a slowly varying signal with low noise. The predictions for the first few values of formula_27 are

: formula_37

<doc id="18574" wikidata="Q103107" url="?curid=18574" title="Leto">
<text>In ancient Greek mythology and religion, Leto (; ) is a goddess and the mother of Apollo and Artemis. She is the daughter of the Titans Coeus and Phoebe, and the sister of Asteria.

In the Olympian scheme, the king of gods Zeus is the father of her twins, Apollo and Artemis, whom Leto conceived after her hidden beauty accidentally caught the eye of Zeus. Classical Greek myths record little about Leto other than her pregnancy and search for a place where she could give birth to Apollo and Artemis, since Hera, the wife of Zeus, in her jealousy ordered all lands to shun her and deny her shelter. 

Hera is also the one to have sent the monstrous Python, a giant serpent, against Leto to pursue and harm her. Leto eventually found an island, Delos, that was not joined to the mainland or attached to the ocean floor, therefore it was not considered land or island and she could give birth. In some stories, Hera further tormented Leto by delaying her labour, leaving Leto in agony for days before she could deliver the twins, especially Apollo. Once Apollo and Artemis are born and grown, Leto withdraws, to remain a matronly figure upon Olympus, her part already played.

Besides the myth of the birth of Artemis and Apollo, Leto appears in other notable myths, usually where she punishes mortals for their hubris against her. After some Lycian peasants prevented her and her infants from drinking from a fountain, Leto transformed them all into frogs inhabiting the fountain. 

In the story of Niobe, Queen Niobe boasts of being a better mother than Leto due to having given birth to a greater number of children than the goddess. Leto then asks her twin children to avenge her, and they respond by shooting all of Niobe&#x27;s sons and daughters dead as punishment. In another myth, the gigantic Tityos attempts to violate Leto, only for him to be slain by Artemis and Apollo. Usually, Leto is found at Olympus among the other gods, having gained her seat next to Zeus, or accompanying and helping her son and daughter in their various endeavors.

In antiquity, Leto was usually worshipped in conjunction with her twin children, particularly in the sacred island of Delos, as a &quot;kourotrophic&quot; deity, the goddess of motherhood; in Lycia she was a mother goddess. In Roman mythology, Leto&#x27;s Roman equivalent is Latona, a Latinization of her name, influenced by the Etruscan &quot;Letun&quot;. In ancient art, she is presented as a modest, veiled woman in the presence of her children and Zeus, or in the process of being carried off by Tityos.

== Etymology ==
&#x27;Leto&#x27; is Attic Greek; in the Doric Greek dialect, spoken in Sparta and the surrounding areas her name was spelled Lato with an alpha instead (; ).

There are several explanations for the origin of the goddess and the meaning of her name. Older sources speculated that the name is related to the Greek &quot;lḗthē&quot; (lethe, oblivion) and &quot;lotus&quot; (the fruit that brings oblivion to those who eat it). It would thus mean &quot;the hidden one&quot;.

In 20th century sources &quot;Leto&quot; is traditionally derived from Lycian &quot;lada&quot;, &quot;wife&quot;, as her earliest cult was centered in Lycia. Lycian &quot;lada&quot; may also be the origin of the Greek name &quot;Leda&quot;. Other scholars (Kretschmer, Bethe, Chantraine, and Beekes) have suggested a pre-Greek origin.

In Mycenaean Greek her name has been attested through the form &quot;Latios&quot;, meaning &quot;son of Leto&quot; or &quot;related to Leto&quot; (Linear B: , &quot;ra-ti-jo&quot;), and &quot;Lato&quot; (Linear B: , &quot;ra-to&quot;).

== Origins ==
Leto was identified from the fourth century onwards as the principal local mother goddess of Anatolian Lycia, as the region became Hellenized. In Greek inscriptions, the children of Leto are referred to as the &quot;national gods&quot; of the country. Her sanctuary, the Letoon near Xanthos, predated Hellenic influence in the region, however, united the Lycian confederacy of city-states. The Hellenes of Kos also claimed Leto as their own. Another sanctuary, more recently identified, was at Oenoanda in the north of Lycia. There was a further Letoon at Delos.

Leto is exceptional among Zeus&#x27; divine lovers for being the only one who was tormented by Hera, who otherwise only directs her anger toward mortal women and nymphs, but not goddesses, thus being treated more in line with mortal women than divine beings in mythology. Zeus had various affairs with goddesses like Themis, Nemesis, Dione, Thetis, Selene, Persephone, and more, which were never harmed by Hera; the sole exception (besides Leto) is found in the &quot;Suda&quot;, a late Byzantine lexicon which recounts the story of Hera cursing a pregnant Aphrodite&#x27;s belly, leading to the birth of Priapus. 

Moreover, Leto&#x27;s troubled childbirth bears resemblance to Alcmene&#x27;s, as both suffered painful extended labours due to Hera not allowing Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, to help them, and both stories overall are also thematically linked to the myth of Semele and her son Dionysus, another story of a mortal woman who bore an important son for Zeus and was punished by Hera for that. Yet at the same time Hesiodic tradition makes her the daughter of two Titans, elder gods, and one of Zeus&#x27; first seven wives. Leto&#x27;s peculiar mythology and ontology has led to suggestions that she might be a composite of two figures, an immortal goddess who bore Artemis, and a mortal woman who gave birth to Apollo.

== Family and attributes ==
Leto is the daughter of the Titans Phoebe and Coeus. Her sister is Asteria, who is, by the Titan Perses, the mother of Hecate.
Leto is also sometimes called the daughter of Coeus with no mother specified. The island of Kos, in the southeast Aegean Sea, is claimed to be her birthplace. However, Diodorus Siculus states clearly that Leto was born in Hyperborea and not in Kos. 

Both sisters captured Zeus&#x27;s heart; first Leto, and then Asteria, who caught his attention after Leto had already been impregnated with his twins. Unlike Leto, Asteria did not reciprocate his love. In Homeric texts, Leto is shown standing next to Zeus in the absence of Hera almost in the manner of a married wife, and not just one mistress among the many.

Hesiod describes Leto as &quot;always mild, kind to men and to the deathless gods, mild from the beginning,&quot; the gentlest goddess in all Olympus. Plato also makes references to Leto&#x27;s softness when trying to link etymologically her name to the word &quot;ἐθελήμονα&quot; (&quot;willing&quot;, i.e. to assist those asking for her help), as well as &quot;λεῖον&quot; (&quot;mild&quot;). Next to Demeter, Leto was the most celebrated mother of the ancient world.

Hesiod describes Leto as &quot;dark-gowned&quot; and the &quot;Orphic Hymn&quot; 35 &quot;to Leto&quot; describes her as &quot;dark-veiled&quot; and &quot;goddess who gave birth to twins&quot; (&quot;θεός διδυματόκος&quot;). In the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Apollo&quot;, she is described as golden-haired.

Hesiod makes her the sixth out of the seven wives of Zeus, who bore his children before his marriage to Hera, however this element is absent in later accounts, all of which speak of a liaison between the two, that ended up in Leto falling pregnant. When Hera, the goddess of marriage and family, queen of the gods and the wife of Zeus, figured it out, she pursued her relentlessly.

The &quot;Homeric Hymn 3 to Apollo&quot; is the oldest extant account of Leto&#x27;s wandering and birth of her children, but it is only concerned with the birth of Apollo, and treats Artemis as an afterthought; in fact the hymn does not even state that Leto&#x27;s children are twins, and they are given different birthplaces (he in Delos, she in Ortygia). The first to speak of Leto&#x27;s children being twins is a slightly later poet, Pindar. The two earliest poets, Homer and Hesiod, confirm Artemis and Apollo&#x27;s status as full siblings born to Leto by Zeus, but neither explicitly makes them twins.

According to the &quot;Homeric Hymn&quot; 3 &quot;to Delian Apollo&quot;, Leto travelled far and wide to find a place to give birth, but none of them dared be the birthplace of Apollo. After having arrived at Delos, she labored for nine nights and nine days, in the presence of Dione, Rhea, Ichnaea, Themis and the sea-goddess Amphitrite. Only Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, was not present; she, unaware of the situation, was with jealous Hera on Olympus. 

Her absence, which was preventing Leto from giving birth, kept her in labor for nine days. According to the Homeric hymn, the goddesses who assembled to witness the birth of Apollo were responding to a public occasion in the rites of a dynasty, where the authenticity of the child must be established beyond doubt from the first moment.

The dynastic rite of the witnessed birth must have been familiar to the hymn&#x27;s hearers. The dynasty that is so concerned about being authenticated in this myth is the new dynasty of Zeus and the Olympian Pantheon, and the goddesses at Delos who bear witness to the rightness of the birth are the great goddesses of the old order. 

Demeter was not present and Aphrodite was not either, but Rhea attended. The goddess Dione (her name simply means &quot;divine&quot; or &quot;she-Zeus&quot;) is sometimes taken by later mythographers as a mere feminine form of Zeus (see entry Dodona). If that was the case, she would not have assembled there. Then, on the ninth day, Eileithyia was sent for by the messenger goddess Iris, who persuaded her with a necklace and brought her to Delos. 

As soon as Eileithyia arrived, Apollo was finally allowed to be born, and was given ambrosia and nectar by Themis, rather than breastmilk. Preceding the myth of Apollo&#x27;s birth, the preface of the hymn begins with the status quo that was then established, namely that Leto is now by the side of Zeus in Olympus, both proudly watching Apollo exercise his archery skills, and she is ever glad for having borne the king of gods such a splendid son and archer.

==== Later accounts ====
According to the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, &quot;But Latona for her intrigue with Zeus was hunted by Hera over the whole earth, till she came to Delos and brought forth first Artemis, by the help of whose midwifery she afterwards gave birth to Apollo.&quot;

Antoninus Liberalis hints that Leto came down from Hyperborea in the guise of a she-wolf, or that she sought out the &quot;wolf-country&quot; of Lycia, formerly called Tremilis, which she renamed to honour wolves that had befriended her. Another late source, Aelian, also links Leto with wolves and Hyperboreans:

Wolves are not easily delivered of their young, only after twelve days and twelve nights, for the people of Delos maintain that this was the length of time that it took Leto to travel from the Hyperboreoi to Delos.

Leto found the barren floating island of Delos, still bearing its archaic name of Asterios, which was neither mainland nor a real island and gave birth there, promising the island wealth from the worshippers who would flock to the obscure birthplace of the splendid god who was to come. As a gesture of gratitude, Delos was secured with four pillars and later became sacred to Apollo.

Callimachus states that not only did every place on earth refuse to give sanctuary to Leto out of fear of Hera, but the queen of gods had also deployed Ares and Iris to drive Leto away from anywhere she tried to settle in, so she would not give birth to her twins. Leto considered the island of Kos for a birthplace, but Apollo, still in the womb, advised his mother against giving birth to him there, saying Kos was fated to be the birthplace of someone else. He later urged his mother to go to Delos. Callimachus wrote that it is remarkable that Leto brought forth Artemis, the elder twin, without travail.

Libanius wrote that neither land nor visible islands would receive Leto, but by the will of Zeus Delos then became visible, and thus received Leto and the children.

According to Hyginus, when Hera discovered that Leto was pregnant by Zeus, she banned Leto from giving birth on &quot;terra firma&quot;, the mainland, any island at sea, or any place under the sun. But Zeus then sent Boreas, the god of the north wind, to Leto, who brought her to Poseidon. Poseidon then raised high waves above Ortygia, shielding it from the light of the sun with a water dome; it was later called the island of Delos. There Leto, clinging to an olive tree, bore Apollo and Artemis after four days.

According to the Homeric Hymn and the &quot;Orphic Hymn&quot; 35 &quot;to Leto&quot;, Artemis was born on the island of Ortygia before Apollo was on Delos. Stephanus of Byzantium also states that Artemis was born before Apollo, however he claims that she was born at Coressus.

According to a local tradition, Apollo was not born on Delos at all, but in Tegyra, a town in Boeotia, where he was worshipped as Apollo Tegyraeus.

Servius, a grammarian who lived during the late 300s AD and early 400s AD, wrote that Artemis was born first because first came the night, whose instrument is the moon, which Artemis represents, and then the day, whose instrument is the sun, which Apollo represents. Pindar however writes that both twins shone like the sun when they came into the bright light.

=== Chthonic assailants ===
Leto was threatened and assailed in her wanderings by ancient earth creatures that had to be overcome, chthonic monsters of the ancient earth and old ways, and these became the enemies of Apollo and Artemis for attempting to cause harm to their mother.

One of the monsters that came across Leto was the dragon Python, which lived in a cleft of the mother-rock beneath Delphi and beside the Castalian Spring. Once Python knew that Leto was pregnant to Zeus, he hunted her down with the intention to harm her, and once he could not find her, he returned to Parnassus. 

An epigram from 159 BC seems to imply that Python in particular wanted to rape Leto. According to some, Python was sent by Hera herself to attack Leto, out of jealousy for having been preferred by Zeus and he knew of a prophecy that he would find death at the hands of Leto&#x27;s unborn son. 

According to Clearchus of Soli, while Python was pursuing them, Leto stepped on a stone and, holding her son in her hands, cried (&quot;híe paî&quot;, meaning &quot;shoot, child&quot;) to Apollo, who was holding a bow and arrows. Apollo slew it but had to do penance and be cleansed afterward, since though Python was a child of Gaia, it was necessary that the ancient Delphic Oracle passed to the protection of the new god.

Another one was the giant Tityos, a phallic being who grew so vast that he split his mother&#x27;s womb and had to be carried to term by Gaia (the Earth) herself. He attempted to rape Leto near Delphi under the orders of Hera, like Python was, for having slept with Zeus, or alternatively he was simply overwhelmed with lust when he saw her. 

Tityos took hold of Leto and attempted to force himself on her, but she called out for her children, and Tityos was laid low by the arrows of Apollo and/or Artemis, as Pindar recalled in a Pythian ode. As he laid dying, his mother Gaia moaned over her slain son; Leto only laughed. For the crime of having tried to rape Leto, one of Zeus&#x27; mistresses, he was punished by having his liver being constantly eaten by two vultures in the Underworld.

=== Involvement in wars ===
Leto fought alongside the other gods during the Gigantomachy, as evidenced from her depiction on the east frieze of the Pergamon Altar, fighting a Giant between her children Artemis and Apollo; None of the other Gigantomachy depictions includes Leto, although her presence is conjectured in one of the missing sections of the Siphnian frieze from Delphi, another relief depiction of the battle of the gods against the Giants.

When the gigantic Typhon attacked Olympus, all the gods transformed into animals and fled to Egypt terrified, or alternatively Typhon attacked them once they had assembled in Egypt in great numbers. Leto turned into a shrew mouse. Leto was equated with the Egyptian goddess Wadjet, a cobra goddess, however other Egyptian gods and goddesses were also connected to shrew mice. Additionally, the Egyptians would embalm small animals like ichneumons and shrew mice and put their mummies in bronze containers.

Leto also took part in the Trojan War, on the Trojans&#x27; side, along with her children Apollo and Artemis. When Apollo saved Aeneas from the battlefield, he brought him to one of his own temples in nearby Pergamus, where he was healed by Artemis and Leto. Later, when the gods battle each other, Leto supports the Trojans, standing opposite of Hermes, who supports the Achaeans. 

After witnessing Hera defeat Artemis and beating her with her own bow, and Artemis fleeing in tears, Hermes refuses to challenge Leto, encouraging her to simply tell everyone she beat him fair and square. Leto picks up Artemis&#x27;s discarded bow and arrows and runs after her crying daughter. According to a scholium on the &quot;Iliad&quot; that claims to report Theagenes&#x27;s interpretation of the gods&#x27; battle, Hermes here represents reason and rationality (&#x27;, &quot;logos&quot;) as opposed to Leto, who stands in for forgetfulness (&#x27;, &quot;lethe&quot;, perhaps a wordplay on Leto&#x27;s name).

=== Favour myths ===
After Orion&#x27;s sight was restored, he met with Artemis and Leto and joined them in hunting, where he bragged about being such a great hunter he could kill every animal on earth, angering Gaia who sent a giant scorpion to kill him. In one version, Orion dies after pushing Leto out of the scorpion&#x27;s way. Afterwards, Leto (and Artemis) placed Orion among the stars (the constellation Orion).

Clinis was a rich Babylonian man who deeply respected Apollo. Having witnessed the Hyperboreans sacrifice donkeys to Apollo, he attempted to do the same, only to be prohibited by the god himself under pain of death. Clinis obeyed and sent the donkeys away, but two of his sons proceeded with the sacrifice anyway. Apollo, enraged, drove the donkeys mad which then began to devour the entire family. Leto and Artemis felt sorry for Clinis, his third son and his daughter, who had done nothing to deserve such fate. Apollo allowed his mother and sister to save those three, and the goddesses changed them into birds before they could be killed by the donkeys.

In Crete lived a poor couple, Galatea and Lamprus. When Galatea fell pregnant, Lamprus warned her that if the child turned out to be female, he would expose it. Galatea gave birth while Lamprus was away, and the infant proved indeed to be a girl. Galatea, fearing her husband, lied to him and told him it was a boy instead whom she named Leucippus (&quot;white horse&quot;). But as the years passed, Leucippus grew to be an exceptionally beautiful girl, and her true sex could no longer be concealed. Galatea fled to the temple of Leto, and prayed to the goddess to change Leucippus into an actual boy. Leto took pity in mother and child, and fulfilled Galatea&#x27;s wish, changing Leucippus&#x27;s sex into that of a boy&#x27;s. To celebrate this, the people at Phaistos sacrificed to Leto Phytia during the Ecdysia (&quot;stripping naked&quot;) festival in her honour.

In one version, Leto, along with her daughter Artemis, stood before Zeus with tearful eyes while her son Apollo pleaded with him to release Prometheus (the god who had stolen fire from the gods, give them to humans, and was subsequently chained in the Caucasus with an eagle feasting on his liver each day for punishment) from his eternal torment. Zeus, moved by Artemis and Leto&#x27;s tears and Apollo&#x27;s words, agreed instantly and commanded Heracles to free Prometheus.

When Apollo killed the Cyclopes in revenge for Zeus slaying his son Asclepius, a gifted healer who could bring the dead back to life, with a thunderbolt, Zeus was about to punish Apollo by throwing him into Tartarus, but Leto interceded for him, and Apollo became bondman to a mortal king named Admetus instead. Apollo happily served Admetus, and enthusiastically undertook several domestic chores during his servitude with him. Leto is said to have despaired at the sight of his unkempt and disheveled locks, which had been admired by even Hera. Praxilla wrote that Carneus was a son of Zeus and Europa, and that he was brought up by Apollo and Leto.

=== Wrath myths ===
Leto&#x27;s introduction into Lycia was met with resistance. There, according to Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, when Leto was wandering the earth after giving birth to Apollo and Artemis, she attempted to drink water from a pond in Lycia. The peasants there refused to allow her to do so by stirring the mud at the bottom of the pond. Leto turned them into frogs for their inhospitality, forever doomed to swim in the murky waters of ponds and rivers.

Niobe was a queen of Thebes and wife of Amphion of whom Sappho wrote that &quot;Lato and Niobe were most dear friends&quot;, although she is most famous for boasting of her superiority to Leto because she had fourteen children (Niobids), seven sons and seven daughters, while Leto had only two. For her hubris, Apollo killed her sons as they practiced athletics, and Artemis killed her daughters. Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions a number of the Niobids were spared. Other sources say that Artemis spared one of the girls (Chloris, usually). Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Zeus after swearing revenge. A devastated Niobe fled to Mount Sipylus in Asia Minor and either turned to stone as she wept or killed herself. Her tears formed the river Achelous. Zeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone so no one buried the Niobids until the ninth day after their death when the gods themselves entombed them.

The Niobe narrative appears in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; where Leto has demanded the women of Thebes to go to her temple and burn incense. Niobe, queen of Thebes, enters in the midst of the worship and insults the goddess, claiming that having beauty, better parentage and more children than Leto, she is more fit to be worshipped than the goddess. To punish this insolence, Leto begs Apollo and Artemis to avenge her against Niobe and to uphold her honor. Obedient to their mother, the twins slay Niobe&#x27;s seven sons and seven daughters, leaving her childless, and her husband Amphion kills himself. Niobe is unable to move from grief and seemingly turns to marble, though she continues to weep, and her body is transported to a high mountain peak in her native land.

=== Other works ===
Aelian writes that the rooster is Leto&#x27;s sacred animal as he was by her side when she gave birth to her twins; this is why ancient women would have a rooster at hand while delivering their children, believing the bird to promote an easy childbirth. He also wrote that the ichneumon (mongoose) is also sacred to her.

Satirical author Lucian of Samosata featured Leto in one of his &quot;Dialogues of the Gods&quot;. There, Hera mocks Leto over the children she gave Zeus, downplaying Artemis and Apollo&#x27;s importance while bringing up their flaws (such as the flaying of Marsyas, or the killing of the Niobids). Leto sarcastically says that not all goddesses can be blessed to be the mother of gods like Hephaestus, and calmly tells Hera that she might feel confident belittling everyone due to her status as queen of the gods as the wife of Zeus, but she will cry and sob all the same the next time he shall abandon her for the love of some mortal woman.

In one of his &quot;Idylls&quot;, poet Theocritus asks Leto to bless the newlyweds Menelaus and Helen with children.

In Orphism, there were several &quot;theogonies&quot; which, similar to Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, told myths explaining and describing the origin of the world and the gods.
These texts, though now no longer extant in their entirety, survive in fragments.
One of these works, the &quot;Rhapsodic Theogony&quot;, or Rhapsodies, (first century BC/AD) apparently called Leto the mother of Hecate.

A fragment of Aeschylus possibly has Leto as the mother of the moon goddess Selene, as does a scholium on Euripides&#x27;s tragedy &quot;The Phoenician Women&quot; which adds Zeus as the father. In Virgil&#x27;s epic the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, when Nisus addresses the Moon/Luna, he calls her &quot;daughter of Latona.&quot;

== Worship ==

=== Lycian Letoon and wider Asia Minor ===
Leto was intensely worshipped in Lycia, Asia Minor, where worship was particularly strong and widespread. In Delos and Athens she was worshipped primarily as an adjunct to her children. Herodotus reported a temple to her in Egypt supposedly attached to a floating island called &quot;Khemmis&quot; in Buto, which also included a temple to an Egyptian god Greeks identified by &quot;interpretatio graeca&quot; as Apollo. There, Herodotus was given to understand, the goddess whom Greeks recognised as Leto was worshipped in the form of Wadjet, the cobra-headed goddess of Lower Egypt.

The ancient Greek colony of Physcus on the western coast of Asia Minor also contained a magnificent harbour and a grove sacred to Leto.

=== Mainland Greece ===
Leto also had a temple in Attica as well as an altar, along with her children Apollo and Artemis in the village Zoster. Pausanias also described statues of Leto and her twins in Megara. Leto was worshipped in Boeotia in her children&#x27;s temples. In Phocis, she was revered in Delphi, sacred to her son Apollo. She also had a temple in Cirrha. In Argolis, Leto had a sanctuary with statues made by Praxiteles in Argos, and images of her were also found on the sanctuary of Artemis Orthia, near Argos. Leto had a sanctuary near Lete, Macedonia. According to Stephanus of Byzantium, Theagenes in his &quot;Macedonica&quot; stated that the town had been named after the goddess. Leto was also revered in Sparta and the rest of Laconia. Leto also had a sanctuary in Mantineia, Arcadia.

=== Aegean Islands ===
Leto was usually not worshipped on her own account, but in conjunction with her children, especially in the island Delos, her chief center of worship and birthplace of her son Apollo as well as his sacred island, where she was represented in temple by a shapeless wooden image, in a Letoum situated in a plain. Sacrifices to Artemis and Apollo were also made in Leto&#x27;s name as well. Poseidon agreed with Leto that she would have Delos, while he got to keep the island of Kelauria. Leto was also worshipped in the island of Rhodes. She might have had a cult center in Lesbos as well. Leto was also worshipped in Crete, whether one of &quot;certain Cretan goddesses, or Greek goddesses in their Cretan form, influenced by the Minoan goddess&quot;. Veneration of a local Leto is attested at Phaistos (where it is purported that she gave birth to Apollo and Artemis at the islands known today as the Paximadia (also known as Letoai in ancient Crete) and at Lato, which bore her name. As &quot;Leto Phytia&quot; she was a mother-deity.

=== Epithets ===
Pindar calls the goddess &quot;Leto Chryselakatos&quot;, an epithet that was attached to her daughter Artemis as early as Homer. &quot;The conception of a goddess enthroned like a queen and equipped with a spindle seems to have originated in Asiatic worship of the Great Mother&quot;, O. Brendel notes, but a lucky survival of an inscribed inventory of her temple on Delos, where she was the central figures of the Delian trinity, records her cult image as sitting on a wooden throne, clothed in a linen &quot;chiton&quot; and a linen &quot;himation&quot;.

== Art ==

In ancient Greek and Roman art, Leto was a common subject in vase painting, but she was hard to distinguish due to her not having any special or unique attributes. Her capture by Tityus and subsequent rescue by Artemis and Apollo was also a very popular subject. Ancient representations of Leto holding her infant children however are rare. A lost vase, now known only through a drawing of Wilhelm Tischbein in his &quot;Collection of Engravings&quot; (published in 1795, volume III), shows Leto running away from the enormous Python in terror while holding her two young children in her arms; this is the only known classical representation of Leto escaping Python.

The myth of Leto transforming the mortals into frogs of the pond became very popular in post-antiquity art. This scene, usually called Latona and the Lycian Peasants or Latona and the Frogs, was popular in Northern Mannerist art, allowing a combination of mythology with landscape painting and peasant scenes, thus combining history painting and genre painting. It is represented in the central fountain, the &quot;Bassin de Latone&quot;, in the garden terrace of the Palace of Versailles. In later art, this scene with the Lycian frogs is exclusively the one Leto appeared in.

In Crete, at the city of Dreros, Spyridon Marinatos uncovered an eighth-century post-Minoan hearth house temple in which there were found three unique figures of Apollo, Artemis and Leto made of brass sheeting hammered over a shaped core (&quot;sphyrelata&quot;). Walter Burkert notes that in Phaistos she appears in connection with an initiation cult.

== Legacy ==
The asteroid 68 Leto and the minor planet 639 Latona were both named after this Greek goddess.

<doc id="18576" wikidata="Q230314" url="?curid=18576" title="La Malinche">
<text>Marina () or Malintzin (; 1500 – 1529), more popularly known as La Malinche (), a Nahua woman from the Mexican Gulf Coast, became known for contributing to the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire (1519–1521), by acting as an interpreter, advisor, and intermediary for the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés. She was one of 20 enslaved women given to the Spaniards in 1519 by the natives of Tabasco. Cortés chose her as a consort, and she later gave birth to their first son, Martín – one of the first &quot;Mestizos&quot; (people of mixed European and Indigenous American ancestry) in New Spain. 

La Malinche&#x27;s reputation has shifted over the centuries, as various peoples evaluate her role against their own societies&#x27; changing social and political perspectives. Especially after the Mexican War of Independence, which led to Mexico&#x27;s independence from Spain in 1821, dramas, novels, and paintings portrayed her as an evil or scheming temptress. In Mexico today, La Malinche remains a powerful icon – understood in various and often conflicting aspects as the embodiment of treachery, the quintessential victim, or the symbolic mother of the new Mexican people. The term &quot;malinchista&quot; refers to a disloyal compatriot, especially in Mexico.

==Name==
Malinche is known by many names, though her birth name is unknown. Malinche was baptized in the Roman Catholic Church and given the Christian name &quot;Marina&quot;, often preceded by the honorific . The Nahua called her Malintzin, derived from &quot;Malina&quot;, a Nahuatl rendering of her Spanish name, and the honorific suffix . According to historian Camilla Townsend, the vocative suffix is sometimes added at the end of the name, giving the form &quot;Malintzine&quot;, which would be shortened to &quot;Malintze&quot;, and heard by the Spaniards as &quot;Malinche&quot;. Another possibility is that the Spaniards simply did not hear the “whispered” of the name &quot;Malintzin&quot;.

The title Tenepal was often assumed to be part of her name. In the annotation made by Nahua historian Chimalpahin on his copy of Gómara&#x27;s biography of Cortés, &quot;Malintzin Tenepal&quot; is used repeatedly about Malinche. According to linguist and historian Frances Karttunen, &quot;Tenepal&quot; is probably derived from the Nahuatl root &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;lip-possessor, one who speaks vigorously&quot;, or &quot;one who has a facility with words&quot;, and postposition , which means &quot;through&quot;. Historian James Lockhart, however, suggests that &quot;Tenepal&quot; might be derived from , &quot;somebody’s tongue&quot;. In any case, &quot;Malintzin Tenepal&quot; appears to have been a literal translation of Spanish , with , &quot;the interpreter&quot;, literally meaning &quot;the tongue&quot;, being her Spanish sobriquet.

Since at least the 19th century, she was believed to have originally been named Malinalli, (Nahuatl for &quot;grass&quot;), after the day sign on which she was supposedly born. 
If so, Marina would have been chosen as her baptismal name because of its phonetic similarity. Modern historians have rejected such mythic suggestions, noting that the Nahua associate the day sign &quot;Malinalli&quot; with bad or &quot;evil&quot; connotations, and they are known to avoid using such day signs as personal names. Moreover, there would be little reason for the Spaniards to ask the natives what their names were before they were christened with new names after Catholic saints.

==Life==

===Background===
Malinche&#x27;s birthdate is unknown, but it is estimated to be around 1500, and likely no later than 1505. She was born in an that was either a part of or a tributary of a Mesoamerican state whose center was located on the bank of the Coatzacoalcos River to the east of the Aztec Empire. Records disagree about the exact name of the where she was born. In three unrelated legal proceedings that occurred not long after her death, various witnesses who claimed to have known her personally, including her daughter, said that she was born in Olutla. The of her grandson also mentioned Olutla as her birthplace. Her daughter added that the of Olutla was related to Tetiquipaque, although the nature of this relationship is unclear. In the &quot;Florentine Codex&quot;, Malinche&#x27;s homeland is mentioned as &quot;Teticpac&quot;, which is most likely the singular form of Tetiquipaque. Gómara writes that she came from &quot;Uiluta&quot; (presumably a variant of &quot;Olutla&quot;). He departs from other sources by writing that it was in the region of Jalisco. Díaz, on the other hand, gives &quot;Painalla&quot; as her birthplace.

Her family is reported to have been of noble background; Gómara writes that her father was related to a local ruler, while Díaz recounts that her parents were rulers. Townsend notes that while Olutla at the time probably had a Popoluca-speaking majority, the ruling elite, which Malinche supposedly belonged to, would have been Nahuatl-speaking. Another hint that supports her noble origin is her apparent ability to understand the courtly language of (&quot;lordly speech&quot;), a Nahuatl register that is significantly different from the commoner&#x27;s speech and has to be learned. The fact that she was often referred to as a , at the time a term in Spain not commonly used when referring to someone outside of the aristocracy, indicates that she was viewed as a noblewoman. But she may have been given this honorific by the Spanish because of recognition of her important role in the conquest.

Malinche was probably between the ages of 8 and 12 when she was either sold or kidnapped into slavery. Díaz wrote that after her father&#x27;s death, she was given away to merchants by her mother and stepfather so that their son (Malinche&#x27;s halfbrother) would have the rights of an heir. Scholars, historians, and literary critics alike have cast doubt upon Díaz&#x27;s account of her origin, in large part due to his strong emphasis on Catholicism throughout his narration of the events. 

In particular, historian Sonia Rose de Fuggle analyzes Díaz&#x27;s over-reliance on polysyndeton (which mimics the sentence structure of many Biblical stories) as well as his overarching portrayal of Malinche as an ideal Christian woman. But Townsend believes that it was likely that some of her people were complicit in trafficking her, regardless of the reason. Malinche was taken to Xicalango, a major port city in the region. She was later purchased by a group of Chontal Maya who brought her to the town of Potonchán. It was here that Malinche started to learn the Chontal Maya language, and perhaps also Yucatec Maya. Her acquisition of the language later enabled her to communicate with Jerónimo de Aguilar, another interpreter for Cortes who also spoke Yucatec Maya, as well as his native Spanish.

===The conquest of Mexico===
Early in his expedition to Mexico, Cortés was confronted by the Maya at Potonchán. In the ensuing battle, the Mayas suffered significant loss of lives and asked for peace. In the following days, they presented the Spaniards with gifts of food and gold, as well as twenty enslaved women, including Malinche. The women were baptized and distributed among Cortés&#x27;s men, who expected to use them as servants and sexual objects. Malinche was given to Alonso Hernández Puertocarrero, one of Cortés&#x27; captains. He was a first cousin to the count of Cortés&#x27;s hometown, Medellín.

Malinche&#x27;s language skills were discovered when the Spaniards encountered the Nahuatl-speaking people at San Juan de Ulúa. Moctezuma&#x27;s emissaries had come to inspect the peoples, but Aguilar could not understand them. Historian Gómara wrote that, when Cortés realized that Malinche could talk with the emissaries, he promised her &quot;more than liberty&quot; if she would help him find and communicate with Moctezuma. Cortés took Malinche from Puertocarrero. He was later given another Indigenous woman before he returned to Spain. 

Aided by Aguilar and Malinche, Cortés talked with Moctezuma&#x27;s emissaries. The emissaries also brought artists to make paintings of Malinche, Cortés, and the rest of the group, as well as their ships and weapons, to be sent as records for Moctezuma. Díaz later said that the Nahua addressed Cortés as &quot;Malinche&quot;; they took her as a point of reference for the group.

From then on, Malinche worked with Aguilar to bridge communication between the Spaniards and the Nahua; Cortés would speak Spanish with Aguilar, who translated into Yucatec Maya for Malinche, who in turn translated into Nahuatl, before reversing the process. The translation chain grew even longer when, after the emissaries left, the Spaniards met the Totonac, whose language was not understood by either Malinche or Aguilar. There, Malinche asked for Nahuatl interpreters. Karttunen remarks that &quot;it is a wonder any communication was accomplished at all&quot;, for Cortés&#x27; Spanish words had to be translated into Maya, Nahuatl, and Totonac before reaching the locals, whose answers went back through the same chain. Meeting with the Totonac was how the Spaniards first learned of opponents to Moctezuma. 

After founding the town of Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz to be freed from the legal restriction of what was supposed to be an exploratory mission, the Spaniards stayed for two months in a nearby Totonac settlement. They secured a formal alliance with the Totonac and prepared for a march toward Tenochtitlan.

The first major polity that they encountered on the way to Tenochtitlan was Tlaxcala. Although the Tlaxcaltec were initially hostile to the Spaniards and their allies, they later permitted the Spaniards to enter the city. The Tlaxcalans negotiated an alliance with the Spaniards through Malinche and Aguilar. Later Tlaxcalan visual records of this meeting feature Malinche as a prominent figure. She appears to bridge communication between the two sides, as the Tlaxcalan presented the Spaniards with gifts of food and noblewomen to cement the alliance. After several days in Tlaxcala, Cortés continued the journey to Tenochtitlan by the way of Cholula. By then he was accompanied by a large number of Tlaxcalan soldiers.

The Spaniards were received at Cholula and housed for several days. The explorers claimed that the Cholulans stopped giving them food, dug secret pits, built a barricade around the city, and hid a large Aztec army in the outskirts to prepare for an attack against the Spaniards. Somehow, the Europeans learned of this and, in a preemptive strike, assembled and massacred the Cholulans. Later accounts claimed that Malinche had uncovered the plot. According to Díaz, she was approached by a Cholulan noblewoman who promised her a marriage to the woman&#x27;s son if she were to switch sides. Pretending to go along with the suggestion, Malinche was told about the plot and later reported all the details to Cortés. 

In later centuries, this story has often been cited as an example of Malinche&#x27;s &quot;betrayal&quot; of her people. But modern historians such as Hassig and Townsend have suggested that Malinche&#x27;s &quot;heroic&quot; discovery of the purported plot was likely already a fabricated story intended to provide Cortés with political justification for his actions, to distant Spanish authorities. In particular, Hassig suggests that Cortés, seeking stronger native alliances leading to the invasion of Tenochtitlan, worked with the Tlaxcalans to coordinate the massacre. Cholula had supported Tlaxcala before joining the Aztec Empire one or two years prior, and losing them as an ally had been a severe blow to the Tlaxcalans. Their state was now completely encircled by the Aztecs. Hassig and other historians assert that Tlaxcalans considered the attack on the Cholulans as a &quot;litmus test&quot; of the Spanish commitment to them. 

The combined forces reached Tenochtitlan in early November 1519, where they were met by Moctezuma on a causeway leading to the city. Malinche was in the middle of this event, translating the conversation between Cortés and Moctezuma. Gomara writes that Moctezuma was &quot;speaking through Malinche and Aguilar&quot;, although other records indicate that Malinche was already translating directly, as she had quickly learned some Spanish herself. Moctezuma&#x27;s flowery speech, delivered through Malinche at the meeting, has been claimed by the Spaniards to represent a submission, but this interpretation is not followed by modern historians. The deferential nature of the speech can be explained by Moctezuma&#x27;s usage of , a Nahuatl register known for its indirection and complex set of reverential affixes. Despite Malinche&#x27;s apparent ability to understand , it is possible that some nuances were lost in translation. The Spaniards, deliberately or not, may have misinterpreted Moctezuma&#x27;s words.

Tenochtitlán fell in late 1521 and Marina&#x27;s son by Cortes, Martín Cortés was born in 1522. During this time Malinche or Marina stayed in a house Cortés built for her in the town of Coyoacán, eight miles south of Tenochtitlán. The Aztec capital city was being redeveloped to serve as Spanish-controlled Mexico City. Cortés took Marina to help quell a rebellion in Honduras in 1524–1526 when she again served as interpreter (she may have known Mayan languages beyond Chontal and Yucatec). While in the mountain town of Orizaba in central Mexico, she married Juan Jaramillo, a Spanish hidalgo. Some contemporary scholars have estimated that she died less than a decade after the conquest of Mexico-Tenochtitlan, at some point before February 1529. She was survived by her son Don Martín, who would be raised primarily by his father&#x27;s family, and a daughter Doña María, who would be raised by Jaramillo and his second wife Doña Beatriz de Andrada. 

Although Martín was Cortés&#x27;s first-born son and eventual heir, his relation to Marina was poorly documented by prominent Spanish historians such as Francisco López de Gómara. He never referred to Marina by name, even in her work as Cortés&#x27;s translator. Even during Marina&#x27;s lifetime, she spent little time with Martín. But many scholars and historians have marked her multiracial child with Cortés as the symbolic beginning of the large mestizo population that developed in Mesoamerica.

==Debates about influence and importance in the conquest of Mexico==
For the conquistadores, having a reliable interpreter was important enough, but there is evidence that Marina&#x27;s role and influence were larger still. Bernal Díaz del Castillo, a soldier who, as an old man, produced the most comprehensive of the eye-witness accounts, the &quot;Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España&quot; (&quot;True Story of the Conquest of New Spain&quot;), speaks repeatedly and reverentially of the &quot;great lady&quot; Doña Marina (always using the honorific title Doña). &quot;Without the help of Doña Marina&quot;, he writes, &quot;we would not have understood the language of New Spain and Mexico.&quot; Rodríguez de Ocaña, another conquistador, relates Cortés&#x27; assertion that after God, Marina was the main reason for his success.

The evidence from Indigenous sources is even more interesting, both in the commentaries about her role, and in her prominence in the codex drawings made of conquest events. Although to some Marina may be known as a traitor, she was not viewed as such by all the Tlaxcalan. In some depictions they portrayed her as &quot;larger than life,&quot; sometimes larger than Cortés, in rich clothing, and an alliance is shown between her and the Tlaxcalan instead of them and the Spaniards. They respected and trusted her and portrayed her in this light generations after the Spanish conquest.

In the &quot;Lienzo de Tlaxcala (History of Tlaxcala)&quot;, for example, not only is Cortés rarely portrayed without Marina poised by his side, but she is shown at times on her own, seemingly directing events as an independent authority. If she had been trained for court life, as in Díaz&#x27;s account, her relationship with Cortés may have followed the familiar pattern of marriage among native elite classes. The role of the Nahua wife acquired through an alliance would have been to assist her husband achieve his military and diplomatic objectives.

Today&#x27;s historians give great credit to Marina&#x27;s diplomatic skills, with some &quot;almost tempted to think of her as the real conqueror of Mexico.&quot; Old conquistadors on various occasions recalled that one of her greatest skills had been her ability to convince other natives of what she could perceive, that it was useless in the long run to stand against Spanish metal (arms) and Spanish ships. In contrast to earlier parts of Díaz del Castillo&#x27;s account, after Marina began assisting Cortés, the Spanish were forced into combat on one more occasion.

Had La Malinche not been part of the Conquest of Mexico for her language skills, communication between the Spanish and the Indigenous peoples would have been much harder. La Malinche knew how to speak in different registers and tones among certain Indigenous tribes and classes of people. For the Nahua audiences, she spoke rhetorically, formally, and high-handedly. This shift into formality gave the Nahua the impression that she was a noblewoman who knew what she was talking about.

==Image in contemporary Mexico==
Malinche&#x27;s image has become a mythical archetype that artists have represented in various forms of art. Her figure permeates historical, cultural, and social dimensions of Mexican cultures. In modern times and several genres, she is compared with La Llorona (folklore story of the woman weeping for lost children), and the Mexican soldaderas (women who fought beside men during the Mexican Revolution) for their brave actions.

La Malinche&#x27;s legacy is one of myth mixed with legend and the opposing opinions of the Mexican people about the legendary woman. Some see her as a founding figure of the Mexican nation, while others continue to see her as a traitor—as may be assumed from a legend that she had a twin sister who went North, and from the pejorative nickname &quot;La Chingada&quot; associated with her twin.

Feminist interventions into the figure of Malinche began in the 1960s. The work of Rosario Castellanos was particularly significant; Chicanas began to refer to her as a &quot;mother&quot; as they adopted her as symbolism for duality and complex identity. Castellanos&#x27;s subsequent poem &quot;La Mallinche&quot; recast her not as a traitor but as a victim. Mexican feminists defended Malinche as a woman caught between cultures, forced to make complex decisions, who ultimately served as a mother of a new race.

Today in Mexican Spanish, the words &quot;malinchismo&quot; and &quot;malinchista&quot; are used to denounce Mexicans who are perceived as denying their cultural heritage by preferring foreign cultural expressions.

Some historians believe that La Malinche saved her people from the Aztecs, who held a hegemony throughout the territory and demanded tribute from its inhabitants. Some Mexicans also credit her with having brought Christianity to the New World from Europe, and for having influenced Cortés to be more humane than he would otherwise have been. It is argued, however, that without her help, Cortés would not have been successful in conquering the Aztecs as quickly, giving the Aztec people enough time to adapt to new technology and methods of warfare. From that viewpoint, she is seen as one who betrayed the Indigenous people by siding with the Spaniards. Recently several feminist have decried such categorization as scapegoating.

President José López Portillo commissioned a sculpture of Cortés, Doña Marina, and their son Martín, which was placed in front of Cortés&#x27; house in the Coyoacán section of Mexico City. Once López Portillo left office, the sculpture was removed to an obscure park in the capital.

<doc id="18577" wikidata="Q188650" url="?curid=18577" title="Lusitania">
<text>Lusitania (; ) was an ancient Iberian Roman province encompassing most of modern-day Portugal (south of the Douro River) and a large portion of western Spain (the present Extremadura and Province of Salamanca). Romans named the region after the Lusitanians, an Indo-European tribe inhabiting the lands.

The capital Emerita Augusta was initially part of the Roman Republic province of Hispania Ulterior before becoming a province of its own during the Roman Empire. 

After Romans arrived in the territory during the 2nd century BC, a war with Lusitanian tribes ensued between 155 and 139 BC, with the Roman province eventually established in 27 BC.

In modern parlance, &quot;Lusitania&quot; is often synonymous with Portugal, despite the province&#x27;s capital being located in modern Mérida, Spain.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of the name of the Lusitani (who gave the Roman province its name) remains unclear. Popular etymology connected the name to a supposed Roman demigod Lusus, whereas some early-modern scholars suggested that &quot;Lus&quot; was a form of the Celtic Lugus followed by another (unattested) root &quot;*tan-&quot;, supposed to mean &quot;tribe&quot;, while others derived the name from &quot;Lucis&quot;, an ancient people mentioned in Avienius&#x27; &quot;Ora Maritima&quot; (4th century AD) and from &quot;tan&quot; (-stan in Iranian), or from &quot;tain&quot;, meaning &quot;a region&quot; or implying &quot;a country of waters&quot;, a root word that formerly meant a prince or sovereign governor of a region.

Ancient Romans, such as Pliny the Elder (&quot;Natural History&quot;, 3.5) and Varro (116 – 27 BC, cited by Pliny), speculated that the name &quot;Lusitania&quot; had Roman origins, as when Pliny says &quot;lusum enim Liberi Patris aut lyssam cum eo bacchantium nomen dedisse Lusitaniae et Pana praefectum eius universae&quot; [Lusitania takes its name from the &quot;Lusus&quot; associated with Bacchus and the &quot;Lyssa&quot; of his Bacchantes, and Pan is its governor].

&quot;Lusus&quot; is usually translated as &quot;game&quot; or &quot;play&quot;, while &quot;lyssa&quot; is a borrowing from the Greek λυσσα, &quot;frenzy&quot; or &quot;rage&quot;, and sometimes Rage personified; for later poets, Lusus and Lyssa become flesh-and-blood companions (even children) of Bacchus. Luís de Camões&#x27; epic &quot;Os Lusíadas&quot; (1572), which portrays Lusus as the founder of Lusitania, extends these ideas, which have no connection with modern etymology.

In his work, &quot;Geography&quot;, the classical geographer Strabo (died ca. 24 AD) suggests a change had occurred in the use of the name &quot;Lusitanian&quot;. He mentions a group who had once been called &quot;Lusitanians&quot; living north of the Douro river but were called in his day &quot;Callacans&quot;.

==Lusitanians==
The Lusitani established themselves in the region in the 6th century BC, but historians and archeologists are still undecided about their ethnogenesis. Some modern authors consider them to be an indigenous people who were Celticized culturally and possibly also through intermarriage.

The archeologist Scarlat Lambrino defended the position that the Lusitanians were a tribal group of Celtic origin related to the Lusones (a tribe that inhabited the east of Iberia). Some have claimed that both tribes came from the Swiss mountains. Others argue that the evidence points to the Lusitanians being a native Iberian tribe, resulting from intermarriage between different local tribes. 

The first area colonized by the Lusitani was probably the Douro valley and the region of Beira Alta (present day Portugal); in Beira, they stayed until they defeated the Celtici and other tribes, then they expanded to cover a territory that reached Estremadura before the arrival of the Romans.

==War against Rome==


The Lusitani are mentioned for the first time in Livy who describes them as fighting for the Carthaginians in 218 BCE; they are reported as fighting against Rome in 194 BC, sometimes allied with Celtiberian tribes.

In 179 BC, the &quot;praetor&quot; Lucius Postumius Albinus celebrated a triumph over the Lusitani, but in 155 BC, on the command of Punicus (Πουνίκου, perhaps a Carthaginian) first and Caesarus (Καίσαρος) after, the Lusitani reached Gibraltar. Here they were defeated by the &quot;praetor&quot; Lucius Mummius.

From 152 BC onwards, the Roman Republic had difficulties in recruiting soldiers for the wars in Hispania, deemed particularly brutal. In 150 BC, Servius Sulpicius Galba organised a false armistice. While the Lusitani celebrated this new alliance, he massacred them, selling the survivors as slaves; this caused a new rebellion led by Viriathus, who was after many attempts killed by traitors paid by the Romans in 139 BC, after having led a successful guerrilla campaign against Rome and their local allies. Two years after, in 137 BC Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus led a successful campaign against the Lusitani, reaching as far north as the Minho river.

Romans scored other victories with &quot;proconsul&quot; Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus and Gaius Marius (elected in 113 BC), but still the Lusitani resisted with a long guerilla war; they later joined Sertorius&#x27; (a renegade Roman General) troops (around 80 BC) and Julius Caesar conducted a successful campaign against them in 61-60 BC, but they were not finally defeated until the reign of Augustus (around 28–24 BC).

== Roman province ==
=== Territory ===
==== Under Augustus ====
With Lusitania (and Asturia and Gallaecia), Rome had completed the conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, which was then divided by Augustus (25–20 BC or 16–13 BC) into the eastern and northern &quot;Hispania Tarraconensis,&quot; the southwestern &quot;Hispania Baetica&quot; and the western &quot;Provincia Lusitana&quot;. Originally, Lusitania included the territories of Asturia and Gallaecia, but these were later ceded to the jurisdiction of the new &quot;Provincia Tarraconensis&quot; and the former remained as &quot;Provincia Lusitania et Vettones&quot;. Its northern border was along the Douro River, while on its eastern side its border passed through &quot;Salmantica&quot; (Salamanca) and &quot;Caesarobriga&quot; (Talavera de la Reina) to the &quot;Anas&quot; (Guadiana) river.

Between 28 and 24 BC Augustus&#x27; military campaigns pacified all Hispania under Roman rule, with the foundation of Roman cities like &quot;Asturica Augusta&quot; (Astorga) and &quot;Bracara Augusta&quot; (Braga) to the north, and to the south &quot;Emerita Augusta&quot; (Mérida) (settled with the emeriti of the Legio V Alaudae and Legio X Gemina legions).

==== &quot;Conventus Iuridicus&quot; ====
Between the time of Augustus and Claudius, the province was divided into three conventus iuridicus, territorial units presided by capital cities with a court of justice and joint Roman/indigenous people assemblies (conventus), that counseled the Governor:

*&quot;Conventus Emeritensis&quot;, with capital in &quot;Emerita Augusta&quot; (Mérida, Spain)
*&quot;Conventus Scalabitanus&quot;, with capital in &quot;Scalabis Iulia&quot; (Santarém, Portugal)
*&quot;Conventus Pacensis&quot;, with capital in &quot;Pax Iulia&quot; (Beja, Portugal)

The &quot;conventus&quot; ruled of a total of forty-six populis. Five were Roman colonies: &quot;Emerita Augusta&quot; (Mérida, Spain), &quot;Pax Iulia&quot; (Beja), &quot;Scalabis&quot; (Santarém), &quot;Norba Caesarina&quot; (Cáceres) and &quot;Metellinum&quot; (Medellín). &quot;Felicitas Iulia Olisipo&quot; (Lisbon, which was a Roman law municipality) and three other towns had the old Latin status: &quot;Ebora&quot; (Évora), &quot;Myrtilis Iulia&quot; (Mértola) and &quot;Salacia&quot; (Alcácer do Sal). The other thirty-seven were of &quot;stipendiarii&quot; class, among which &quot;Aeminium&quot; (Coimbra), &quot;Balsa&quot; (Tavira), or &quot;Mirobriga&quot; (Santiago do Cacém). Other cities include &quot;Ossonoba&quot; (Faro), &quot;Cetobriga&quot; (Setúbal), &quot;Collippo&quot; (Leiria) or &quot;Arabriga&quot; (Alenquer).

==== Under Diocletian ====
Under Diocletian, Lusitania kept its borders and was ruled by a &quot;praeses&quot;, later by a &quot;consularis.&quot;

==== Roman diocese ====
Finally, in 298 AD, Lusitania was united with the other provinces to form the &quot;Diocesis Hispaniarum&quot; (&quot;Diocese of the Hispanias&quot;).

==Legacy of the name==

As with the Roman names of many European countries, &quot;Lusitania&quot; was and is often used as an alternative name for Portugal, especially in formal or literary and poetic contexts. The 16th-century colony that would eventually become Brazil was initially founded as &quot;New Lusitania&quot;. In common use are such terms as Lusophone, meaning Portuguese-speaking, and Lusitanic, referring to the Community of Portuguese Language Countries—once Portugal&#x27;s colonies and presently independent countries still sharing some common heritage. Prior to his invasion in 1807, Napoleon Bonaparte proposed the establishment of a French-backed puppet Kingdom of Northern Lusitania as one of the successor states to Portugal under the assumption that such a campaign would result in an easy French victory.

The province was also the namesake of the North Atlantic Ocean liner RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; infamous for being torpedoed by a German U-boat in 1915. The ship&#x27;s owners, the Cunard Line, commonly named their vessels after Roman provinces with the &quot;Lusitania&quot; so being called after the Roman Iberian province to the north of the Strait of Gibraltar while her sister ship RMS &quot;Mauretania&quot; was named after the Roman North African province on the south side of the strait.

<text>In public transit, particularly bus, tram, or train transportation, a limited-stop (or sometimes referred to as semi-fast) service is a trip pattern that stops less frequently than a local service. Many limited-stop or semi-fast services are a combination of commuter rail and express train.

The term is normally used on routes with a mixture of fast and slow services, and can differ in meaning, depending on how it is used by different transit agencies. The main benefits of limited-stop or semi-fast services is the ability to utilise skip-stop calling pattern to maximise capacity along the line, as opposed to a commuter service stopping at every station which slows trailing express trains down.

==Railways==

On railways, the layout of the tracks and number and length of platforms at stations normally limit the extent to which a blend of fast/semi-fast/slow services can be operated.

===Australia===
In Australia, particularly in Brisbane and Sydney, limited stop services are formed by commuter trains that run as limited stops or express services from the city centre to the edge of the suburban area and then as all stops in the interurban area (an example of such an express pattern can be seen on the Gold Coast line and the East Hills line).

=== Finland ===
In Helsinki, Finland, VR commuter rail services are formed by trains that run as limited stops or express from the city centre and then stop all stations in the interurban area. The Y train is one such example.

=== Japan ===
In Japan, the limited stops train is known as a semi-express train ( &quot;Junkyū&quot;). An example is applied to Nankai Railway&#x27;s Koya Line.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, some railway stations have tracks for which there are no platforms, allowing a larger number of fast trains to pass them without stopping. They may go down the middle of the station or down the side such as at , , and (the middle track at Totnes is used only in the summer by Great Western Railway services between and ).

===United States===
In the United States, some railway stations have tracks for which there are no platforms. For instance, various commuter rail services run along the same tracks as Amtrak&#x27;s Acela Express and Northeast Corridor routes with four rails, two in the middle for Amtrak, and two on either side for the commuter rail. There are also Express services within those, as at many smaller stations, the Northeast Corridor trains will split off onto the commuter rail tracks to make a stop, and the Acela trains will continue.

====Subways====

The United States also uniquely has subways that use this method. In New York City, they are numbered as separate lines, which are often part-express, part-local, while others are only express at certain times of day, for example the J and Z services. In Philadelphia, they are considered the same line, but with a few different types of services. The Broad Street Line has the local, which makes all stops; the express, which has an early Southern terminus in the city center; the spur, which makes a few more stops than the express but less than the local, and then branches out to service two other stations), and the special, which is run only during sporting events, and runs as the express but then continues nonstop down to the southern terminus of the local, sharing tracks with the local.

==Buses==
Traditionally, limited-stop bus services usually operate on an identical or similar route to one or more local bus routes, only serving primary stops, and skipping the others served by local routes. Typically, the stops that are served by limited stop routes are chosen so that stops are evenly spaced or are transfer points, major intersections, or popular destinations. Within downtowns, limited-stop services may stop more frequently. Depending on the transit agency, this can sometimes be referred to as express service. For example, Chicago Transit Authority refers to both this type and non-stop services as express.

Limited-stop bus service is a core component of bus rapid transit (BRT), but differs by not sharing most of the common features of bus rapid transit such as unique route branding, off-vehicle fare collection, signal preemption, frequent all-day service, and dedicated right-of-way. For example, the RapidRide lines in Seattle, Washington are existing local King County Metro routes but with fewer stops and some BRT features being adopted at some stations. In other cities, such as Hong Kong, limited stop bus service currently uses the same branding and has the same features (except stopping less frequently) as regular bus routes.

Other forms of limited-stop bus service other than the traditional type characterized by serving only some of the stops. Some bus routes with portions of the route are non-stop are referred to as limited stop by the transit agency that operates the route.

One form is a route that operates partially on a highway. It is more similar to an express bus route than the traditional limited stop route. However, the non-stop portion of the route is typically shorter than that of an express route, and the fare structure of the transit agency cause a limited stop route to have a lower fare than an express route.

One example of this type of route would be Metro Transit Route 114 in Minneapolis, MN. The route originates at the University of Minnesota campus in Minneapolis, then it travels several miles on Interstates 35W and 94, before it begins to operate as local service through the Uptown area of Minneapolis.

Another form of limited stop bus service includes local routes that may operate certain trips with limited or non-stop sections. For example, to aid commute times for downtown workers, Metro Transit Route 12 in Minneapolis operates during peak hours as non-stop for approximately eight blocks between Franklin Avenue and Uptown Transit Station, but the route serves all stops along that section at other times.
