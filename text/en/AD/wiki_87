<text>Mormons are a religious and cultural group related to Mormonism, the principal branch of the Latter Day Saint movement started by Joseph Smith in upstate New York during the 1820s. After Smith&#x27;s death in 1844, the movement split into several groups following different leaders; the majority followed Brigham Young, while smaller groups followed Joseph Smith III, Sidney Rigdon, and James Strang. Most of these smaller groups eventually merged into the Community of Christ, and the term &quot;Mormon&quot; typically refers to members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), as today, this branch is far larger than all the others combined. People who identify as Mormons may also be independently religious, secular, and non-practicing or belong to other denominations. Since 2018, the LDS Church has emphasized a desire for its members be referred to as &quot;members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&quot;, or more simply as &quot;Latter-day Saints&quot;.

Mormons have developed a strong sense of community that stems from their doctrine and history. One of the central doctrinal issues that defined Mormonism in the 19th century was the practice of plural marriage, a form of religious polygamy. From 1852 until 1904, when the LDS Church banned the practice, many Mormons who had followed Brigham Young to the Utah Territory openly practiced polygamy. Mormons dedicate significant time and resources to serving in their churches. A prominent practice among young and retired members of the LDS Church is to serve a full-time proselytizing mission. Mormons have a health code that eschews alcoholic beverages, tobacco, tea, coffee, and addictive substances. They tend to be very family-oriented and have strong connections across generations and with extended family, reflecting their belief that families can be sealed together beyond death. They also have a strict law of chastity, requiring abstention from sexual relations outside heterosexual marriage and fidelity within marriage.

Mormons self-identify as Christian, but some non-Mormons consider Mormons non-Christian because some of their beliefs differ from those of Nicene Christianity. Mormons believe that Christ&#x27;s church was restored through Joseph Smith and is guided by living prophets and apostles. Mormons believe in the Bible and other books of scripture, such as the Book of Mormon. They have a unique view of cosmology and believe that all people are literal spirit children of God. Mormons believe that returning to God requires following the example of Jesus Christ and accepting his atonement through repentance and ordinances such as baptism.

During the 19th century, Mormon converts tended to gather in a central geographic location, a trend that reversed somewhat in the 1920s and 1930s. The center of Mormon cultural influence is in Utah, and North America has more Mormons than any other continent, although about 60% of Mormons live outside the United States. As of December 31, 2021, the LDS Church reported a membership of 16,805,400.

== Terminology ==

The terminology preferred by the church itself has varied over time. At various points, the church has embraced the term &quot;Mormon&quot; and stated that other sects within the shared faith tradition should not be called Mormon.

The word Mormon was initially coined to describe any person who believes in the Book of Mormon as a scripture volume. Mormonite and Mormon were originally descriptive terms used both by outsiders to the faith, church members, and occasionally church leaders. The term Mormon later was sometimes used derogatorily; such use may have developed during the 1838 Mormon War, although church members and leaders &quot;embraced the term&quot;, according to church historian Matthew Bowman, and by the end of the 1800s it was broadly used.

The LDS Church has made efforts, including in 1982, in 2001 prior to the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics, in 2011 after &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot; appeared on Broadway, and again in 2018, to encourage the use of the church&#x27;s full name, rather than the terms Mormon or LDS. According to Patrick Mason, chair of Mormon studies at Claremont Graduate University and Richard Bennett, a professor of church history at Brigham Young University, this is because non-church members have historically been confused about whether it represents a Christian faith, which concerns church leaders, who want to emphasize that the church is a Christian church. The term Mormon also causes concern for church leaders because it has been used to include splinter groups such as Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints, who practice polygamy, which the LDS Church does not; Mason said &quot;For more than 100 years, the mainstream LDS Church has gone to great pains to distance itself from those who practice polygamy. It doesn&#x27;t want to have any confusion there between those two groups.&quot;

In 2018, the LDS Church published a style guide that encourages the use of the terms &quot;the Church&quot;, the &quot;Church of Jesus Christ&quot; or the &quot;restored Church of Jesus Christ&quot; as shortened versions after an initial use of the full name. According to church historian Bowman, &#x27;the term &quot;restored&quot; refers to the idea that the original Christian religion is obsolete, and Mormons alone are practicing true Christianity.&#x27;

The 2018 style guide rejects the term Mormons along with &quot;Mormon Church&quot;, &quot;Mormonism&quot;, and the abbreviation LDS. The second-largest sect, the Community of Christ, also rejects the term Mormon due to its association with the practice of polygamy among Brighamite sects. Other sects, including several fundamentalist branches of the Brighamite tradition, embrace the term &quot;Mormon&quot;.

== History ==
The history of the Mormons has shaped them into a people with a strong sense of unity and commonality. From the start, Mormons have tried to establish what they call &quot;Zion&quot;, a utopian society of the righteous.
Mormon history can be divided into three broad periods: (1) the early history during the lifetime of Joseph Smith, (2) a &quot;pioneer era&quot; under the leadership of Brigham Young and his successors, and (3) a modern era beginning around the turn of the 20th century. In the first period, Smith attempted to build a city called Zion, where converts could gather. Zion became a &quot;landscape of villages&quot; in Utah during the pioneer era. In modern times, Zion is still an ideal, though Mormons gather together in their individual congregations rather than in a central geographic location.

=== Beginnings ===


The Mormon movement began with the publishing of the Book of Mormon in March 1830, which Smith claimed was a translation of golden plates containing the religious history of an ancient American civilization that the ancient prophet-historian Mormon had compiled. Smith stated that an angel had directed him to the golden plates buried in the Hill Cumorah. On April 6, 1830, Smith founded the Church of Christ. In 1832, Smith added an account of a vision he had sometime in the early 1820s while living in Upstate New York. Some Mormons regarded this vision as the most important event in human history after the birth, ministry, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

The early church grew westward as Smith sent missionaries to proselytize. In 1831, the church moved to Kirtland, Ohio, where missionaries had made a large number of converts and Smith began establishing an outpost in Jackson County, Missouri, where he planned to eventually build the city of Zion (or the New Jerusalem). In 1833, Missouri settlers, alarmed by the rapid influx of Mormons, expelled them from Jackson County into the nearby Clay County, where local residents were more welcoming.
After Smith led a mission, known as Zion&#x27;s Camp, to recover the land, he began building Kirtland Temple in Lake County, Ohio, where the church flourished. When the Missouri Mormons were later asked to leave Clay County in 1836, they secured land in what would become Caldwell County.

The Kirtland era ended in 1838 after the failure of a church-sponsored anti-bank caused widespread defections, and Smith regrouped with the remaining church in Far West, Missouri. During the fall of 1838, tensions escalated into the Mormon War with the old Missouri settlers. On October 27, the governor of Missouri ordered that the Mormons &quot;must be treated as enemies&quot; and be exterminated or driven from the state. Between November and April, some eight thousand displaced Mormons migrated east into Illinois.

In 1839, the Mormons purchased the small town of Commerce, converted swampland on the banks of the Mississippi River, renamed the area Nauvoo, Illinois, and began constructing the Nauvoo Temple. The city became the church&#x27;s new headquarters and gathering place, and it grew rapidly, fueled in part by converts immigrating from Europe. Meanwhile, Smith introduced temple ceremonies meant to seal families together for eternity, as well as the doctrines of eternal progression or exaltation and plural marriage.
Smith created a service organization for women called the Relief Society and the Council of Fifty, representing a future theodemocratic &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; on the earth. Smith also published the story of his First Vision, in which the Father and the Son appeared to him when he was about 14 years old. This vision would come to be regarded by some Mormons as the most important event in human history after the birth, ministry, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

In 1844, local prejudices and political tensions, fueled by Mormon peculiarity, internal dissent, and reports of polygamy, escalated into conflicts between Mormons and &quot;anti-Mormons&quot; in Illinois and Missouri. Smith was arrested, and on June 27, 1844, he and his brother Hyrum were killed by a mob in Carthage, Illinois. Because Hyrum was Smith&#x27;s logical successor, their deaths caused a succession crisis, and Brigham Young assumed leadership over most Latter Day Saints. Young had been a close associate of Smith&#x27;s and was the senior apostle of the Quorum of the Twelve. Smaller groups of Latter-Day Saints followed other leaders to form other denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement.

=== Pioneer era ===

For two years after Joseph Smith&#x27;s death, conflicts escalated between Mormons and other Illinois residents. To prevent war, Brigham Young led the Mormon pioneers (constituting most of the Latter Day Saints) to a temporary winter quarters in Nebraska and then, eventually (beginning in 1847), to what became the Utah Territory. Having failed to build Zion within the confines of American society, the Mormons began to construct a society in isolation based on their beliefs and values. The cooperative ethic that Mormons had developed over the last decade and a half became important as settlers branched out and colonized a large desert region now known as the Mormon Corridor. Colonizing efforts were seen as religious duties, and the new villages were governed by the Mormon bishops (local lay religious leaders). The Mormons viewed land as a commonwealth, devising and maintaining a cooperative system of irrigation that allowed them to build a farming community in the desert.

From 1849 to 1852, the Mormons greatly expanded their missionary efforts, establishing several missions in Europe, Latin America, and the South Pacific. Converts were expected to &quot;gather&quot; to Zion, and during Young&#x27;s presidency (1847–77), over seventy thousand Mormon converts immigrated to America. Many of the converts came from England and Scandinavia and were quickly assimilated into the Mormon community. Many of these immigrants crossed the Great Plains in wagons drawn by oxen, while some later groups pulled their possessions in small handcarts. During the 1860s, newcomers began using the new railroad that was under construction.

In 1852, church leaders publicized the previously secret practice of plural marriage, a form of polygamy. Over the next 50 years, many Mormons (between 20 and 30 percent of Mormon families) entered into plural marriages as a religious duty, with the number of plural marriages reaching a peak around 1860 and then declining through the rest of the century. Besides the doctrinal reasons for plural marriage, the practice made some economic sense, as many of the plural wives were single women who arrived in Utah without brothers or fathers to offer them societal support.

By 1857, tensions had again escalated between Mormons and other Americans, primarily due to accusations involving polygamy and the theocratic rule of the Utah Territory by Brigham Young. In 1857, U.S. President James Buchanan sent an army to Utah, which Mormons interpreted as open aggression against them. Fearing a repeat of Missouri and Illinois, the Mormons prepared to defend themselves, determined to torch their own homes if they were invaded. The Utah War ensued from 1857 to 1858, in which the most notable instance of violence was the Mountain Meadows massacre when leaders of a local Mormon militia ordered the killing of a civilian emigrant party that was traveling through Utah during the escalating tensions. In 1858, Young agreed to step down from his position as governor and was replaced by a non-Mormon, Alfred Cumming. Nevertheless, the LDS Church still wielded significant political power in the Utah Territory.

At Young&#x27;s death in 1877, he was followed by other LDS Church presidents, who resisted efforts by the United States Congress to outlaw Mormon polygamous marriages. In 1878, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Reynolds v. United States&quot; that religious duty was not a suitable defense for practicing polygamy. Many Mormon polygamists went into hiding; later, Congress began seizing church assets. In September 1890, church president Wilford Woodruff issued a Manifesto that officially suspended the practice of polygamy. Although this Manifesto did not dissolve existing plural marriages, relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a U.S. state in 1896. After the Manifesto, some Mormons continued to enter into polygamous marriages, but these eventually stopped in 1904 when church president Joseph F. Smith disavowed polygamy before Congress and issued a &quot;Second Manifesto&quot; calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease. Eventually, the church adopted a policy of excommunicating members found practicing polygamy, and today actively seeks to distance itself from &quot;fundamentalist&quot; groups that continue the practice.

=== Modern times ===
During the early 20th century, Mormons began reintegrating into the American mainstream. In 1929, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir began broadcasting a weekly performance on national radio, becoming an asset for public relations. Mormons emphasized patriotism and industry, rising in socioeconomic status from the bottom among American religious denominations to the middle class.
In the 1920s and 1930s, Mormons began migrating out of Utah, a trend hurried by the Great Depression, as Mormons looked for work wherever they could find it. As Mormons spread out, church leaders created programs to help preserve the tight-knit community feel of Mormon culture. In addition to weekly worship services, Mormons began participating in numerous programs such as Boy Scouting, a Young Women organization, church-sponsored dances, ward basketball, camping trips, plays, and religious education programs for youth and college students. During the Great Depression, the church started a welfare program to meet the needs of poor members, which has since grown to include a humanitarian branch that provides relief to disaster victims.

During the later half of the 20th century, there was a retrenchment movement in Mormonism in which Mormons became more conservative, attempting to regain their status as a &quot;peculiar people&quot;.
Though the 1960s and 1970s brought changes such as Women&#x27;s Liberation and the civil rights movement, Mormon leaders were alarmed by the erosion of traditional values, the sexual revolution, the widespread use of recreational drugs, moral relativism, and other forces they saw as damaging to the family.
Partly to counter this, Mormons put an even greater emphasis on family life, religious education, and missionary work, becoming more conservative in the process. As a result, Mormons today are probably less integrated with mainstream society than they were in the early 1960s.

Although black people have been members of Mormon congregations since Joseph Smith&#x27;s time, before 1978, black membership was small. From 1852 to 1978, the LDS Church enforced a policy restricting men of black African descent from being ordained to the church&#x27;s lay priesthood. The church was sharply criticized for its policy during the civil rights movement, but the policy remained in force until a 1978 reversal that was prompted in part by questions about mixed-race converts in Brazil. In general, Mormons greeted the change with joy and relief. Since 1978, black membership has grown, and in 1997 there were approximately 500,000 black church members (about 5 percent of the total membership), mostly in Africa, Brazil, and the Caribbean. Black membership has continued to grow substantially, especially in West Africa, where two temples have been built. Some black Mormons are members of the Genesis Group, an organization of black members that predates the priesthood ban and is endorsed by the church.

The LDS Church grew rapidly after World War II and became a worldwide organization as missionaries were sent across the globe. The church doubled in size every 15 to 20 years, and by 1996, there were more Mormons outside the United States than inside. In 2012, there were an estimated 14.8 million Mormons, with roughly 57 percent living outside the United States. It is estimated that approximately 4.5 million Mormons – approximately 30% of the total membership – regularly attend services. A majority of U.S. Mormons are white and non-Hispanic (84 percent). Most Mormons are distributed in North and South America, the South Pacific, and Western Europe. The global distribution of Mormons resembles a contact diffusion model, radiating out from the organization&#x27;s headquarters in Utah. The church enforces general doctrinal uniformity, congregations on all continents teach the same doctrines, and international Mormons tend to absorb a good deal of Mormon culture, possibly because of the church&#x27;s top-down hierarchy and missionary presence. However, international Mormons often bring pieces of their own heritage into the church, adapting church practices to local cultures.

As of December 2019, the LDS Church reported having 16,565,036 members worldwide. Chile, Uruguay, and several areas in the South Pacific have a higher percentage of Mormons than the United States (which is at about 2 percent). South Pacific countries and dependencies that are more than 10 percent Mormon include American Samoa, the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Niue, Samoa, and Tonga.

== Culture and practices ==
Isolation in Utah had allowed Mormons to create a culture of their own. As the faith spread worldwide, many of its more distinctive practices followed. Mormon converts are urged to undergo lifestyle changes, repent of sins, and adopt sometimes atypical standards of conduct. Practices common to Mormons include studying scriptures, praying daily, fasting regularly, attending Sunday worship services, participating in church programs and activities on weekdays, and refraining from work on Sundays when possible. The most important part of the church services is considered to be the Lord&#x27;s Supper (commonly called sacrament), in which church members renew covenants made at baptism. Mormons also emphasize standards they believe were taught by Jesus Christ, including personal honesty, integrity, obedience to the law, chastity outside marriage, and fidelity within marriage.

In 2010, around 13–14 percent of Mormons lived in Utah, the center of cultural influence for Mormonism. Utah Mormons (as well as Mormons living in the Intermountain West) are on average more culturally and politically conservative than those living in some cosmopolitan centers elsewhere in the U.S. Utahns self-identifying as Mormon also attend church somewhat more on average than Mormons living in other states. (Nonetheless, whether they live in Utah or elsewhere in the U.S., Mormons tend to be more culturally and politically conservative than members of other U.S. religious groups.) Utah Mormons often emphasize pioneer heritage more than international Mormons, who generally are not descendants of the Mormon pioneers.

Mormons have a strong sense of communality that stems from their doctrine and history. LDS Church members have a responsibility to dedicate their time and talents to helping the poor and building the church. The church is divided by locality into congregations called &quot;wards&quot;, with several wards or branches to create a &quot;stake&quot;. Most church leadership positions are lay positions, and church leaders may work 10 to 15 hours a week in unpaid church service. Observant Mormons also contribute 10 percent of their income to the church as tithing. Paying tithing is one of the prerequisites for entrance into Mormon temples. Many LDS young men, women, and elderly couples choose to serve a proselytizing mission, during which they dedicate all of their time to the church without pay. Members are often involved in humanitarian efforts.

Mormons adhere to the Word of Wisdom, a health law or code that is interpreted as prohibiting the consumption of tobacco, alcohol, coffee and tea, while encouraging the use of herbs, grains, fruits, and a moderate consumption of meat. The Word of Wisdom is also understood to forbid other harmful and addictive substances and practices, such as the use of illegal drugs and abuse of prescription drugs. Mormons are encouraged to keep a year&#x27;s supplies, including food and financial reserves. Mormons also oppose behaviors such as viewing pornography and gambling.

The concept of a united family that lives and progresses forever is at the core of Latter-day Saint doctrine, and Mormons place a high importance on family life. Many Mormons hold weekly Family Home Evenings, in which an evening is set aside for family bonding, study, prayer, and other activities they consider to be wholesome. Latter-day Saint fathers who hold the priesthood typically name and bless their children shortly after birth to formally give the child a name. Mormon parents hope and pray that their children will gain testimonies of the &quot;gospel&quot; so they can grow up and marry in temples.

Mormons have a strict law of chastity, requiring abstention from sexual relations outside opposite-sex marriage and strict fidelity within marriage. All sexual activity (heterosexual and homosexual) outside marriage is considered a grave sin, with marriage recognized as only between a man and a woman. Same-sex marriages are not performed or supported by the LDS Church. Church members are encouraged to marry and have children, and Latter-day Saint families tend to be larger than average. Mormons are opposed to abortion, except in some exceptional circumstances, such as when pregnancy is the result of incest or rape or when the life or health of the mother is in serious jeopardy. Many practicing adult Mormons wear religious undergarments that remind them of covenants and encourage them to dress modestly. Latter-day Saints are counseled not to partake in any form of media that is obscene or pornographic in any way, including media that depicts graphic representations of sex or violence. Tattoos and body piercings are generally discouraged.

LGBTQ Mormons remain in good standing in the church if they abstain from homosexual relations and obey the law of chastity. While there are no official numbers, LDS Family Services estimates that, on average, four or five members per LDS ward experience same-sex attraction. Gary Watts, former president of Family Fellowship, estimates that only 10 percent of homosexuals stay in the church. Many of these individuals have come forward through different support groups or websites discussing their homosexual attractions and concurrent church membership.

== Groups within Mormonism ==
Note that the categories below are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

=== Latter-day Saints (&quot;LDS&quot;) ===
Members of the LDS Church, also known as Latter-day Saints, constitute over 95 percent of Mormons. The beliefs and practices of LDS Mormons are generally guided by the teachings of LDS Church leaders. However, several smaller groups substantially differ from &quot;mainstream&quot; Mormonism in various ways.

LDS Church members who do not actively participate in worship services or church callings are often called &quot;less-active&quot; or &quot;inactive&quot; (akin to the qualifying expressions &quot;non-observant&quot; or &quot;non-practicing&quot; used in relation to members of other religious groups). The LDS Church does not release statistics on church activity, but it is likely that about 40 percent of Mormons in the United States and 30 percent worldwide regularly attend worship services. Reasons for inactivity can include rejection of the fundamental beliefs, history of the church, lifestyle incongruities with doctrinal teachings or problems with social integration. Activity rates tend to vary with age, and disengagement occurs most frequently between age 16 and 25. In 1998, the church reported that most less active members returned to church activity later in life. As of 2017, the LDS Church was losing millennial-age members, a phenomenon not unique to the LDS Church. Former Latter-day Saints who seek to disassociate themselves from the religion are often referred to as ex-Mormons.

=== Fundamentalist Mormons ===

Members of sects that broke with the LDS Church over the issue of polygamy have become known as fundamentalist Mormons; these groups differ from mainstream Mormonism primarily in their belief in and practice of plural marriage. There are thought to be between 20,000 and 60,000 members of fundamentalist sects (0.1–0.4 percent of Mormons), with roughly half of them practicing polygamy. There are many fundamentalist sects, the largest two being the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church) and the Apostolic United Brethren (AUB). In addition to plural marriage, some of these groups also practice a form of Christian communalism known as the law of consecration or the United Order. The LDS Church seeks to distance itself from all such polygamous groups, excommunicating their members if discovered practicing or teaching it, and today, a majority of Mormon fundamentalists have never been members of the LDS Church.

=== Liberal Mormons ===
Liberal Mormons, also known as Progressive Mormons, take an interpretive approach to LDS teachings and scripture. They look to the scriptures for spiritual guidance, but may not necessarily believe the teachings to be literally or uniquely true. For liberal Mormons, revelation is a process through which God gradually brings fallible human beings to greater understanding. A person in this group is sometimes mistakenly regarded by others within the mainstream church as a Jack Mormon, although this term is more commonly used to describe a different group with distinct motives to live the gospel in a non-traditional manner. Liberal Mormons place doing good and loving fellow human beings above the importance of believing correctly. In a separate context, members of small progressive breakaway groups have also adopted the label.

=== Cultural Mormons ===

Cultural Mormons are individuals who may not believe in certain doctrines or practices of the institutional LDS Church yet identify as members of the Mormon ethnic identity. Usually, this is a result of having been raised in the LDS faith or having converted and spent a large portion of one&#x27;s life as an active member of the LDS Church. Cultural Mormons may or may not be actively involved with the LDS Church. In some cases, they may not be members of the LDS Church.

== Beliefs ==
Mormons have a scriptural canon consisting of the Bible (both Old and New Testaments), the Book of Mormon, and a collection of revelations and writings by Joseph Smith known as the Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price. Mormons, however, have a relatively open definition of scripture. As a general rule, anything spoken or written by a prophet, while under inspiration, is considered to be the word of God. Thus, the Bible, written by prophets and apostles, is the word of God, so far as it is translated correctly. The Book of Mormon is also believed to have been written by ancient prophets and is viewed as a companion to the Bible. By this definition, the teachings of Smith&#x27;s successors are also accepted as scripture, though they are always measured against and draw heavily from the scriptural canon.

Mormons believe in &quot;a friendly universe&quot; governed by a God whose aim is to bring his children to immortality and eternal life. Mormons have a unique perspective on the nature of God, the origin of man, and the purpose of life. For instance, Mormons believe in a pre-mortal existence where people were literal spirit children of God and that God presented a plan of salvation that would allow his children to progress and become more like him. The plan involved the spirits receiving bodies on earth and going through trials in order to learn, progress, and receive a &quot;fullness of joy&quot;. The most important part of the plan involved Jesus, the eldest of God&#x27;s children, coming to earth as the literal Son of God to conquer sin and death so that God&#x27;s other children could return. According to Mormons, every person who lives on earth will be resurrected, and nearly all of them will be received into various kingdoms of glory. To be accepted into the highest kingdom, a person must fully accept Christ through faith, repentance, and through ordinances such as baptism and the laying on of hands.

According to Mormons, a deviation from the original principles of Christianity, referred to by them as The Great Apostasy, occurred after the ascension of Jesus Christ, marked by the corruption of Christian doctrine by Greek and other philosophies, Mormons claim the martyrdom of the apostles led to a loss of priesthood authority to administer the church and its ordinances.
Mormons believe that God restored the early Christian church through Joseph Smith. In particular, Mormons believe that angels such as Peter, James, John, John the Baptist, Moses, and Elijah appeared to Smith and others and bestowed various priesthood authorities on them. Mormons believe that their church is the &quot;only true and living church&quot; because of the divine authority restored through Smith. Mormons self-identify as being Christian, while many Christians, particularly evangelical Protestants, disagree with this view. Mormons view other religions as having portions of the truth, doing good works, and having genuine value.

The LDS Church has a top-down hierarchical structure with a president–prophet dictating revelations for the entire church. Lay Mormons are also believed to have access to inspiration and are encouraged to seek their own personal revelations. Mormons see Joseph Smith&#x27;s First Vision as proof that the heavens are open and that God answers prayers. They place considerable emphasis on &quot;asking God&quot; to find out if something is true. Most Mormons do not claim to have had heavenly visions like Smith&#x27;s in response to prayers but feel that God talks to them in their hearts and minds through the Holy Ghost. Though Mormons have some beliefs that are considered strange in a modernized world, they continue to hold onto their beliefs because they feel God has spoken to them.

<text>Manitoba is a province of Canada at the longitudinal centre of the country. It is Canada&#x27;s fifth-most populous province, with a population of 1,342,153 as of 2021. Manitoba has a widely varied landscape, from arctic tundra and the Hudson Bay coastline in the north to dense boreal forest, large freshwater lakes, and prairie grassland in the central and southern regions.

Indigenous peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years. In the early 17th century, English and French fur traders began arriving in the area and establishing settlements. The Kingdom of England secured control of the region in 1673 and created a territory named Rupert&#x27;s Land, which was placed under the administration of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Rupert&#x27;s Land, which included all of present-day Manitoba, grew and evolved from 1673 until 1869 with significant settlements of Indigenous and Métis people in the Red River Colony. Negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba commenced in 1869, but deep disagreements over the right to self-determination led to an armed conflict, known as the Red River Rebellion, between the federal government and the people (particularly Métis) of the Red River Colony. The resolution of the conflict and further negotiations led to Manitoba becoming the fifth province to join Canadian Confederation, when the Parliament of Canada passed the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot; on 15 July 1870.

Manitoba&#x27;s capital and largest city is Winnipeg, the sixth most populous municipality in Canada. Winnipeg is the seat of government, home to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba and the Provincial Court. Four of the province&#x27;s five universities, all four of its professional sports teams, and most of its cultural activities (including Festival du Voyageur and Folklorama) are located in Winnipeg. The city has an international airport as well as train and bus stations; a Canadian Forces base, CFB Winnipeg, operates from the airport and is the regional headquarters of the North American Aerospace Defense Command.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Manitoba&quot; possibly derives from either Cree or Ojibwe , both meaning . Alternatively, it may be from the Assiniboine , meaning (the lake was known to French explorers as ). The name was chosen by Thomas Spence for the new republic he proposed for the area south of the lake. Métis leader Louis Riel preferred the name over the proposed alternative of &quot;Assiniboia&quot;. It was accepted in Ottawa under the &quot;Manitoba Act, 1870&quot;.

== History ==
===Indigenous societies and European settlement===

Modern-day Manitoba was inhabited by the First Nations people shortly after the last ice age glaciers retreated in the southwest about 10,000 years ago; the first exposed land was the Turtle Mountain area. The Ojibwe, Cree, Dene, Sioux, Mandan, and Assiniboine peoples founded settlements, and other tribes entered the area to trade. In Northern Manitoba, quartz was mined to make arrowheads. The first farming in Manitoba was along the Red River, where corn and other seed crops were planted before contact with Europeans.

In 1611, Henry Hudson was one of the first Europeans to sail into what is now known as Hudson Bay, where he was abandoned by his crew. Thomas Button travelled this area in 1612 in an unsuccessful attempt to find and rescue Hudson. When the British ship &quot;Nonsuch&quot; sailed into Hudson Bay in 1668–1669, she became the first trading vessel to reach the area; that voyage led to the formation of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, to which the British government gave absolute control of the entire Hudson Bay watershed. This watershed was named Rupert&#x27;s Land, after Prince Rupert, who helped to subsidize the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. York Factory was founded in 1684 after the original fort of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, Fort Nelson (built in 1682), was destroyed by rival French traders.

Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La Vérendrye, visited the Red River Valley in the 1730s to help open the area for French exploration and trade. As French explorers entered the area, a Montreal-based company, the North West Company, began trading with the local Indigenous people. Both the North West Company and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company built fur-trading forts; the two companies competed in southern Manitoba, occasionally resulting in violence, until they merged in 1821 (the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company Archives in Winnipeg preserve the history of this era).

Great Britain secured the territory in 1763 after their victory over France in the North American theatre of the Seven Years&#x27; War, better known as the French and Indian War in North America; lasting from 1754 to 1763. The founding of the first agricultural community and settlements in 1812 by Lord Selkirk, north of the area which is now downtown Winnipeg, led to conflict between British colonists and the Métis. Twenty colonists, including the governor, and one Métis were killed in the Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816.

=== Confederation ===
Rupert&#x27;s Land was ceded to Canada by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in 1869 and incorporated into the Northwest Territories; a lack of attention to Métis concerns caused Métis leader Louis Riel to establish a local provisional government which formed into the Convention of Forty and the subsequent elected Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia on 9 March 1870. This assembly subsequently sent three delegates to Ottawa to negotiate with the Canadian government. This resulted in the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot; and that province&#x27;s entry into Confederation. Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald introduced the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot; in the House of Commons of Canada, the bill was given Royal Assent and Manitoba was brought into Canada as a province in 1870. Louis Riel was pursued by British army officer Garnet Wolseley because of the rebellion, and Riel fled into exile. The Canadian government blocked the Métis&#x27; attempts to obtain land promised to them as part of Manitoba&#x27;s entry into confederation. Facing racism from the new flood of white settlers from Ontario, large numbers of Métis moved to what would become Saskatchewan and Alberta.

Numbered Treaties were signed in the late 19th century with the chiefs of First Nations that lived in the area. They made specific promises of land for every family. As a result, a reserve system was established under the jurisdiction of the federal government. The prescribed amount of land promised to the native peoples was not always given; this led Indigenous groups to assert rights to the land through land claims, many of which are still ongoing.

The original province of Manitoba was a square one-eighteenth of its current size, and was known colloquially as the &quot;postage stamp province&quot;. Its borders were expanded in 1881, taking land from the Northwest Territories and the District of Keewatin, but Ontario claimed a large portion of the land; the disputed portion was awarded to Ontario in 1889. Manitoba grew to its current size in 1912, absorbing land from the Northwest Territories to reach 60°N, uniform with the northern reach of its western neighbours Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia.

The Manitoba Schools Question showed the deep divergence of cultural values in the territory. The Catholic Franco-Manitobans had been guaranteed a state-supported separate school system in the original constitution of Manitoba, but a grassroots political movement among English Protestants from 1888 to 1890 demanded the end of French schools. In 1890, the Manitoba legislature passed a law removing funding for French Catholic schools. The French Catholic minority asked the federal government for support; however, the Orange Order and other anti-Catholic forces mobilized nationwide to oppose them. The federal Conservatives proposed remedial legislation to override Manitoba, but they were blocked by the Liberals, led by Wilfrid Laurier. Once elected Prime Minister in 1896, Laurier implemented a compromise stating Catholics in Manitoba could have their own religious instruction for 30 minutes at the end of the day if there were enough students to warrant it, implemented on a school-by-school basis.

=== Contemporary era ===
By 1911, Winnipeg was the third largest city in Canada, and remained so until overtaken by Vancouver in the 1920s. A boomtown, it grew quickly around the start of the 20th century, with outside investors and immigrants contributing to its success. The drop in growth in the second half of the decade was a result of the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, which reduced reliance on transcontinental railways for trade, as well as a decrease in immigration due to the outbreak of the First World War. Over 18,000 Manitoba residents enlisted in the first year of the war; by the end of the war, 14 Manitobans had received the Victoria Cross.

During the First World War, Nellie McClung started the campaign for women&#x27;s votes. On January 28, 1916, the vote for women was legalized. Manitoba was the first province to allow women to vote in provincial elections. This was two years before Canada as a country granted women the right to vote.

After the First World War ended, severe discontent among farmers (over wheat prices) and union members (over wage rates) resulted in an upsurge of radicalism, coupled with a polarization over the rise of Bolshevism in Russia. The most dramatic result was the Winnipeg general strike of 1919. It began on 15 May and collapsed on 25 June 1919; as the workers gradually returned to their jobs, the Central Strike Committee decided to end the movement. Government efforts to violently crush the strike, including a Royal North-West Mounted Police charge into a crowd of protesters that resulted in multiple casualties and one death, had led to the arrest of the movement&#x27;s leaders. In the aftermath, eight leaders went on trial, and most were convicted on charges of seditious conspiracy, illegal combinations, and seditious libel; four were deported under the &quot;Canadian Immigration Act&quot;.

The Great Depression (1929–) hit especially hard in Western Canada, including Manitoba. The collapse of the world market combined with a steep drop in agricultural production due to drought led to economic diversification, moving away from a reliance on wheat production. The Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, forerunner to the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), was founded in 1932.

Canada entered the Second World War in 1939. Winnipeg was one of the major commands for the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan to train fighter pilots, and there were air training schools throughout Manitoba. Several Manitoba-based regiments were deployed overseas, including Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry. In an effort to raise money for the war effort, the Victory Loan campaign organized &quot;If Day&quot; in 1942. The event featured a simulated Nazi invasion and occupation of Manitoba, and eventually raised over C$65 million.
Winnipeg was inundated during the 1950 Red River Flood and had to be partially evacuated. In that year, the Red River reached its highest level since 1861 and flooded most of the Red River Valley. The damage caused by the flood led then-Premier Duff Roblin to advocate for the construction of the Red River Floodway; it was completed in 1968 after six years of excavation. Permanent dikes were erected in eight towns south of Winnipeg, and clay dikes and diversion dams were built in the Winnipeg area. In 1997, the &quot;Flood of the Century&quot; caused over in damages in Manitoba, but the floodway prevented Winnipeg from flooding.

In 1990, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney attempted to pass the Meech Lake Accord, a series of constitutional amendments to persuade Quebec to endorse the &quot;Canada Act 1982&quot;. Unanimous support in the legislature was needed to bypass public consultation. Cree politician Elijah Harper opposed because he did not believe First Nations had been adequately involved in the Accord&#x27;s process, and thus the Accord failed.

Glen Murray, elected in Winnipeg in 1998, became the first openly gay mayor of a large North American city. The province was impacted by major flooding in 2009 and 2011. In 2004, Manitoba became the first province in Canada to ban indoor smoking in public places. In 2013, Manitoba was the second province to introduce accessibility legislation, protecting the rights of persons with disabilities.

== Geography ==

Manitoba is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west, the territory of Nunavut to the north, and the US states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south. Manitoba is at the centre of the Hudson Bay drainage basin, with a high volume of the water draining into Lake Winnipeg and then north down the Nelson River into Hudson Bay. This basin&#x27;s rivers reach far west to the mountains, far south into the United States, and east into Ontario. Major watercourses include the Red, Assiniboine, Nelson, Winnipeg, Hayes, Whiteshell and Churchill rivers. Most of Manitoba&#x27;s inhabited south has developed in the prehistoric bed of Glacial Lake Agassiz. This region, particularly the Red River Valley, is flat and fertile; receding glaciers left hilly and rocky areas throughout the province.

The province has a saltwater coastline bordering Hudson Bay and more than 110,000 lakes, covering approximately 15.6 percent or of its surface area. Manitoba&#x27;s major lakes are Lake Manitoba, Lake Winnipegosis, and Lake Winnipeg, the tenth-largest freshwater lake in the world. A total of of traditional First Nations lands and boreal forest on Lake Winnipeg&#x27;s east side were officially designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site known as Pimachiowin Aki in 2018.

Baldy Mountain is the province&#x27;s highest point at above sea level, and the Hudson Bay coast is the lowest at sea level. Riding Mountain, the Pembina Hills, Sandilands Provincial Forest, and the Canadian Shield are also upland regions. Much of the province&#x27;s sparsely inhabited north and east lie on the irregular granite Canadian Shield, including Whiteshell, Atikaki, and Nopiming Provincial Parks.

Extensive agriculture is found only in the province&#x27;s southern areas, although there is grain farming in the Carrot Valley Region (near The Pas). Around 11 per cent of Canada&#x27;s farmland is in Manitoba.

=== Climate ===
Manitoba has an extreme continental climate. Temperatures and precipitation generally decrease from south to north and increase from east to west. Manitoba is far from the moderating influences of mountain ranges or large bodies of water. Because of the generally flat landscape, it is exposed to cold Arctic high-pressure air masses from the northwest during January and February. In the summer, air masses sometimes come out of the Southern United States, as warm humid air is drawn northward from the Gulf of Mexico. Temperatures exceed numerous times each summer, and the combination of heat and humidity can bring the humidex value to the mid-40s. Carman, Manitoba, recorded the second-highest humidex ever in Canada in 2007, with 53.0. According to Environment Canada, Manitoba ranked first for clearest skies year round and ranked second for clearest skies in the summer and for the sunniest province in the winter and spring.

Southern Manitoba (including the city of Winnipeg), falls into the humid continental climate zone (Köppen Dfb). This area is cold and windy in the winter and often has blizzards because of the open landscape. Summers are warm with a moderate length. This region is the most humid area in the prairie provinces, with moderate precipitation. Southwestern Manitoba, though under the same climate classification as the rest of Southern Manitoba, is closer to the semi-arid interior of Palliser&#x27;s Triangle. The area is drier and more prone to droughts than other parts of southern Manitoba. This area is cold and windy in the winter and has frequent blizzards due to the openness of the Canadian Prairie landscape. Summers are generally warm to hot, with low to moderate humidity.

Southern parts of the province, just north of Tornado Alley, experience tornadoes, with 16 confirmed touchdowns in 2016. In 2007, on 22 and 23 June, numerous tornadoes touched down, the largest an F5 tornado that devastated parts of Elie (the strongest recorded tornado in Canada).

The province&#x27;s northern sections (including the city of Thompson) fall in the subarctic climate zone (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfc&quot;). This region features long and extremely cold winters and brief, warm summers with little precipitation. Overnight temperatures as low as occur on several days each winter.

=== Flora and fauna ===

Manitoba natural communities may be grouped within five ecozones: boreal plains, prairie, taiga shield, boreal shield and Hudson plains. Three of these—taiga shield, boreal shield and Hudson plain—contain part of the Boreal forest of Canada which covers the province&#x27;s eastern, southeastern, and northern reaches.

Forests make up about , or 48 percent, of the province&#x27;s land area. The forests consist of pines (Jack Pine, Red Pine, Eastern White Pine), spruces (White Spruce, Black Spruce), Balsam Fir, Tamarack (larch), poplars (Trembling Aspen, Balsam Poplar), birches (White Birch, Swamp Birch) and small pockets of Eastern White Cedar.

Two sections of the province are not dominated by forest. The province&#x27;s northeast corner bordering Hudson Bay is above the treeline and considered tundra. The tallgrass prairie once dominated the south-central and southeastern regions, including the Red River Valley. Mixed grass prairie is found in the southwestern region. Agriculture has replaced much of the natural vegetation but prairie can still be found in parks and protected areas; some are notable for the presence of the endangered western prairie fringed orchid.

Manitoba is especially noted for its northern polar bear population; Churchill is commonly referred to as the &quot;Polar Bear Capital&quot;. In the waters off the northern coast of the province are numerous marine species, including the beluga whale. Other populations of animals, including moose, white-tailed deer, mule deer, black and brown bears, coyote, cougar, red fox, Canada lynx, and grey wolf, are distributed throughout the province, especially in the provincial and national parks. There is a large population of red-sided garter snakes near Narcisse; the overwintering dens there are seasonally home to the world&#x27;s largest concentration of snakes.

Manitoba&#x27;s bird diversity is enhanced by its position on two major migration routes, with 392 confirmed identified species; 287 of these nesting within the province. These include the great grey owl, the province&#x27;s official bird, and the endangered peregrine falcon.

Manitoba&#x27;s lakes host 18 species of game fish, particularly species of trout, pike, and goldeye, as well as many smaller fish.

== Demography ==


At the 2021 census, Manitoba had a population of 1,342,153, more than half of which is in Winnipeg. Although initial colonization of the province revolved mostly around homesteading, the last century has seen a shift towards urbanization; Manitoba is the only Canadian province with over fifty-five percent of its population in a single city.

The largest ethnic group in Manitoba is English (16.1%), followed by Scottish (14.5%), German (13.6%), Ukrainian (12.6%), Irish (11.0%), French (9.3%), Canadian (8.4%), Filipino (7.0%), Métis (6.8%), Polish (6.0%), First Nations (4.5%), Mennonite (3.9%), Russian (3.7%), Dutch (3.3%), Indian (3.0%), and Icelandic (2.4%). Indigenous peoples (including Métis) are Manitoba&#x27;s fastest-growing ethnic group, representing 13.6 percent of Manitoba&#x27;s population as of 2001 (some reserves refused to allow census-takers to enumerate their populations or were otherwise incompletely counted). Gimli, Manitoba is home to the largest Icelandic community outside of Iceland.

As of the 2021 Canadian Census, the ten most spoken languages in the province included English (1,288,950 or 98.6%), French (111,790 or 8.55%), Tagalog (73,440 or 5.62%), Punjabi (42,820 or 3.28%), German (41,980 or 3.21%), Hindi (26,980 or 2.06%), Spanish (23,435 or 1.79%), Mandarin (16,765 or 1.28%), Cree (16,115 or 1.23%), and Plautdietsch (15,055 or 1.15%). The question on knowledge of languages allows for multiple responses.

Most Manitobans belong to a Christian denomination: on the 2021 census, 54.2% reported being Christian, followed by 2.7% Sikh, 2.0% Muslim, 1.4% Hindu, 0.9% Jewish, and 0.8% Indigenous spirituality. 36.7% reported no religious affiliation. The largest Christian denominations by number of adherents were the Roman Catholic Church with 21.2%; the United Church of Canada with 5.8%; and the Anglican Church of Canada with 3.3%.

== Economy ==

Manitoba has a moderately strong economy based largely on natural resources. Its Gross Domestic Product was C$50.834 billion in 2008. The province&#x27;s economy grew 2.4 percent in 2008, the third consecutive year of growth. The average individual income in Manitoba in 2006 was C$25,100 (compared to a national average of C$26,500), ranking fifth-highest among the provinces. As of October 2009, Manitoba&#x27;s unemployment rate was 5.8 percent.

Manitoba&#x27;s economy relies heavily on agriculture, tourism, electricity, oil, mining, and forestry. Agriculture is vital and is found mostly in the southern half of the province, although grain farming occurs as far north as The Pas. The most common agricultural activity is cattle husbandry, followed by assorted grains and oilseed. Manitoba is the nation&#x27;s largest producer of sunflower seed and dry beans, and one of the leading sources of potatoes. Portage la Prairie is a major potato processing centre. Richardson International, one of the largest oat mills in the world, also has a plant in the municipality.

Manitoba&#x27;s largest employers are government and government-funded institutions, including crown corporations and services like hospitals and universities. Major private-sector employers are The Great-West Life Assurance Company, Cargill Ltd., and Richardson International. Manitoba also has large manufacturing and tourism sectors. Churchill&#x27;s Arctic wildlife is a major tourist attraction; the town is a world capital for polar bear and beluga whale watchers. Manitoba is the only province with an Arctic deep-water seaport, at Churchill.

In January 2018, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business claimed Manitoba was the most improved province for tackling red tape.

=== Economic history ===

Manitoba&#x27;s early economy depended on mobility and living off the land. Indigenous Nations (Cree, Ojibwa, Dene, Sioux and Assiniboine) followed herds of bison and congregated to trade among themselves at key meeting places throughout the province. After the arrival of the first European traders in the 17th century, the economy centred on the trade of beaver pelts and other furs. Diversification of the economy came when Lord Selkirk brought the first agricultural settlers in 1811, though the triumph of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) over its competitors ensured the primacy of the fur trade over widespread agricultural colonization.

HBC control of Rupert&#x27;s Land ended in 1868; when Manitoba became a province in 1870, all land became the property of the federal government, with homesteads granted to settlers for farming. Transcontinental railways were constructed to simplify trade. Manitoba&#x27;s economy depended mainly on farming, which persisted until drought and the Great Depression led to further diversification.

== Military bases ==
CFB Winnipeg is a Canadian Forces Base at the Winnipeg International Airport. The base is home to flight operations support divisions and several training schools, as well as the 1 Canadian Air Division and Canadian NORAD Region Headquarters. 17 Wing of the Canadian Forces is based at CFB Winnipeg; the Wing has three squadrons and six schools. It supports 113 units from Thunder Bay to the Saskatchewan/Alberta border, and from the 49th parallel north to the high Arctic. 17 Wing acts as a deployed operating base for CF-18 Hornet fighter–bombers assigned to the Canadian NORAD Region.

The two 17 Wing squadrons based in the city are: the 402 (&quot;City of Winnipeg&quot; Squadron), which flies the Canadian designed and produced de Havilland Canada CT-142 Dash 8 navigation trainer in support of the 1 Canadian Forces Flight Training School&#x27;s Air Combat Systems Officer and Airborne Electronic Sensor Operator training programs (which trains all Canadian Air Combat Systems Officer); and the 435 (&quot;Chinthe&quot; Transport and Rescue Squadron), which flies the Lockheed C-130 Hercules tanker/transport in airlift search and rescue roles, and is the only Air Force squadron equipped and trained to conduct air-to-air refuelling of fighter aircraft.

Canadian Forces Base Shilo (CFB Shilo) is an Operations and Training base of the Canadian Forces east of Brandon. During the 1990s, Canadian Forces Base Shilo was designated as an Area Support Unit, acting as a local base of operations for Southwest Manitoba in times of military and civil emergency. CFB Shilo is the home of the 1st Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, both battalions of the 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group, and the Royal Canadian Artillery. The Second Battalion of Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI), which was originally stationed in Winnipeg (first at Fort Osborne, then in Kapyong Barracks), has operated out of CFB Shilo since 2004. CFB Shilo hosts a training unit, 3rd Canadian Division Training Centre. It serves as a base for support units of 3rd Canadian Division, also including 3 CDSG Signals Squadron, Shared Services Unit (West), 11 CF Health Services Centre, 1 Dental Unit, 1 Military Police Regiment, and an Integrated Personnel Support Centre. The base houses 1,700 soldiers.

== Government and politics ==
After the control of Rupert&#x27;s Land was passed from Great Britain to the Government of Canada in 1869, Manitoba attained full-fledged rights and responsibilities of self-government as the first Canadian province carved out of Rupert&#x27;s Land. The Legislative Assembly of Manitoba was established on 14 July 1870. Political parties first emerged between 1878 and 1883, with a two-party system (Liberals and Conservatives). The United Farmers of Manitoba appeared in 1922, and later merged with the Liberals in 1932. Other parties, including the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), appeared during the Great Depression; in the 1950s, Manitoban politics became a three-party system, and the Liberals gradually declined in power. The CCF became the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), which came to power in 1969. Since then, the Progressive Conservatives and the NDP have been the dominant parties.

Like all Canadian provinces, Manitoba is governed by a unicameral legislative assembly. The executive branch is formed by the governing party; the party leader is the premier of Manitoba, the head of the executive branch. The head of state, King Charles III, is represented by the lieutenant governor of Manitoba, who is appointed by the governor general of Canada on advice of the prime minister. The head of state is primarily a ceremonial role, although the lieutenant governor has the official responsibility of ensuring Manitoba has a duly constituted government.

The Legislative Assembly consists of the 57 Members elected to represent the people of Manitoba. The premier of Manitoba is Wab Kinew, who was elected in the 2023 provincial election. The province is represented in federal politics by 14 Members of Parliament and six Senators.

Manitoba&#x27;s judiciary consists of the Court of Appeal, the Court of King&#x27;s Bench, and the Provincial Court. The Provincial Court is primarily for criminal law; 95 per cent of criminal cases in Manitoba are heard here. The Court of King&#x27;s Bench is the highest trial court in the province. It has four jurisdictions: family law (child and family services cases), civil law, criminal law (for indictable offences), and appeals. The Court of Appeal hears appeals from both benches; its decisions can only be appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.

=== Official languages ===

Both English and French are official languages of the legislature and courts of Manitoba, according to section 23 of the &quot;Manitoba Act, 1870&quot; (part of the Constitution of Canada). In April 1890, the Manitoba legislature attempted to abolish the official status of French and ceased to publish bilingual legislation. However, in 1985, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in the Reference re Manitoba Language Rights that section 23 still applied, and that legislation published only in English was invalid (unilingual legislation was declared valid for a temporary period to allow time for translation).

Although French is an official language for the purposes of the legislature, legislation, and the courts, the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot; does not require it to be an official language for the purpose of the executive branch (except when performing legislative or judicial functions). Hence, Manitoba&#x27;s government is not completely bilingual. The Manitoba French Language Services Policy of 1999 is intended to provide a comparable level of provincial government services in both official languages. According to the 2006 Census, 82.8 percent of Manitoba&#x27;s population spoke only English, 3.2 percent spoke only French, 15.1 percent spoke both, and 0.9 percent spoke neither.

In 2010, the provincial government of Manitoba passed the &quot;Aboriginal Languages Recognition Act&quot;, which gives official recognition to seven indigenous languages: Cree, Dakota, Dene, Inuktitut, Michif, Ojibway and Oji-Cree.

==Transportation==
Manitoba has two Class I railways: Canadian National Railway (CN) and Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). Winnipeg is centrally located on the main lines of both carriers, and both maintain large inter-modal terminals in the city. Via Rail offers transcontinental and Northern Manitoba passenger service from Winnipeg&#x27;s Union Station. Numerous small regional and short-line railways also run trains within Manitoba: the Hudson Bay Railway, the Southern Manitoba Railway, Burlington Northern Santa Fe Manitoba, Greater Winnipeg Water District Railway, and Central Manitoba Railway.

Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport, Manitoba&#x27;s largest airport, is one of only a few 24-hour unrestricted airports in Canada and is part of the National Airports System. A new, larger terminal opened in October 2011. It is the seventh busiest airport in Canada by passenger traffic, serving 4,484,343 passengers in 2018, and the 11th busiest airport by aircraft movements. The airport handles approximately of cargo annually, making it the third largest cargo airport in the country. Winnipeg is a major sorting facility for both FedEx and Purolator, and receives daily trans-border service from UPS.

The Port of Churchill is the only Arctic deep-water port in Canada. It is nautically closer to ports in Northern Europe and Russia than any other port in Canada. It has four deep-sea berths for the loading and unloading of grain, general cargo and tanker vessels. The port is served by the Hudson Bay Railway. The port and railway came under complete community and Indigenous ownership in 2021, after AGT Food and Ingredients and Fairfax Financial transferred their shares in Arctic Gateway to OneNorth – a consortium of community and Indigenous partners which owned the other fifty percent of Arctic Gateway&#x27;s shares.

== Education ==

Public schools follow a provincially mandated curriculum in either French or English. There are sixty-five funded independent schools in Manitoba, including three boarding schools. These schools must follow the Manitoban curriculum and meet other provincial requirements. There are forty-four non-funded independent schools, which are not required to meet those standards. Public schools in Manitoba fall under the regulation of one of thirty-seven school divisions within the provincial education system (except for the Manitoba Band Operated Schools, which are administered by the federal government). In 2021, the provincial government announced a plan to merge all English-language school divisions into 15 regional catchment areas, overseen by a provincial education authority.

There are five universities in Manitoba, regulated by the Ministry of Advanced Education and Literacy. Four of these universities are in Winnipeg: the University of Manitoba, the largest and most comprehensive; the University of Winnipeg, a liberal arts school primarily focused on undergrad studies downtown; Université de Saint-Boniface, the province&#x27;s only French-language university; and the Canadian Mennonite University, a religious-based institution. The Université de Saint-Boniface, established in 1818 and now affiliated with the University of Manitoba, is the oldest university in Western Canada. Brandon University, formed in 1899 and in Brandon, is the province&#x27;s only university not in Winnipeg.

Manitoba has fifty-four public library systems. Of these, Winnipeg Public Library has the largest collections, at 1.1 million items as of 2020.

== Culture ==
=== Arts ===

The Minister of Culture, Heritage, Tourism and Sport is responsible for promoting and, to some extent, financing Manitoban culture. Manitoba is the birthplace of the Red River Jig, a combination of Indigenous pow-wows and European reels popular among early settlers. Manitoba&#x27;s traditional music has strong roots in Métis and First Nations culture, in particular the old-time fiddling of the Métis. Manitoba&#x27;s cultural scene also incorporates classical European traditions. The Winnipeg-based Royal Winnipeg Ballet (RWB), is Canada&#x27;s oldest ballet and North America&#x27;s longest continuously operating ballet company; it was granted its royal title in 1953 under Queen Elizabeth II. The Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra (WSO) performs classical music and new compositions at the Centennial Concert Hall. Manitoba Opera, founded in 1969, also performs out of the Centennial Concert Hall.
Le Cercle Molière (founded 1925) is the oldest French-language theatre in Canada, and Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre (founded 1958) is Canada&#x27;s oldest English-language regional theatre. Manitoba Theatre for Young People was the first English-language theatre to win the Canadian Institute of the Arts for Young Audiences Award, and offers plays for children and teenagers as well as a theatre school. The Winnipeg Art Gallery (WAG), Manitoba&#x27;s largest art gallery and the sixth largest in the country, hosts an art school for children; the WAG&#x27;s permanent collection comprises over twenty thousand works, with a particular emphasis on Manitoban and Canadian art.

The 1960s pop group the Guess Who was formed in Manitoba, and later became the first Canadian band to have a No. 1 hit in the United States; Guess Who guitarist Randy Bachman later created Bachman–Turner Overdrive (BTO) with fellow Winnipeg-based musician Fred Turner. Fellow rocker Neil Young, grew up in Manitoba, and later played in Buffalo Springfield, and Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. Folk rock band Crash Test Dummies formed in the late 1980s in Winnipeg and were the 1992 Juno Awards Group of the Year.

Several prominent Canadian films were produced in Manitoba, such as &quot;The Stone Angel&quot;, based on the Margaret Laurence book of the same title, &quot;The Saddest Music in the World&quot;, &quot;Foodland&quot;, &quot;For Angela&quot;, and &quot;My Winnipeg&quot;. Major films shot in Manitoba include &quot;The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford&quot; and &quot;Capote&quot;, both of which received Academy Award nominations. &quot;Falcon Beach&quot;, an internationally broadcast television drama, was filmed at Winnipeg Beach, Manitoba.

Manitoba has a strong literary tradition. Bertram Brooker won the first-ever Governor General&#x27;s Award for Fiction in 1936. Cartoonist Lynn Johnston, author of the comic strip &quot;For Better or For Worse&quot;, was a finalist for a 1994 Pulitzer Prize and inducted into the Canadian Cartoonist Hall of Fame. Margaret Laurence&#x27;s &quot;The Stone Angel&quot; and &quot;A Jest of God&quot; were set in Manawaka, a fictional town representing Neepawa; the latter title won the Governor General&#x27;s Award in 1966. Carol Shields won both the Governor General&#x27;s Award and the Pulitzer Prize for &quot;The Stone Diaries&quot;. Gabrielle Roy, a Franco-Manitoban writer, won the Governor General&#x27;s Award three times. A quote from her writings is featured on the Canadian $20 bill. Joan Thomas was nominated for the Governor General&#x27;s Award twice and won in 2019 for &quot;Five Wives&quot;. The province has also been home to many of the key figures in Mennonite literature, including Governor General Award-winning Miriam Toews, Giller winner David Bergen, Armin Wiebe and many others. Sandra Birdsell, whose fiction focusses on her Métis and Mennonite heritage, was thrice nominated for the Governor General&#x27;s Literary Award for English Language Fiction, and also for the Scotiabank Giller Prize in 2001.

=== Festivals ===

Festivals take place throughout the province, with the largest centred in Winnipeg. The Winnipeg Folk Festival has an annual attendance of over 70,000. The Festival du Voyageur is an annual ten-day event held in Winnipeg&#x27;s French Quarter, and is Western Canada&#x27;s largest winter festival. It celebrates Canada&#x27;s fur-trading past and French-Canadian heritage and culture. Folklorama, a multicultural festival run by the Folk Arts Council, receives around 400,000 pavilion visits each year, of which about thirty percent are from non-Winnipeg residents. The Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival is an annual alternative theatre festival, the second-largest festival of its kind in North America (after the Edmonton International Fringe Festival).

===Museums===
Manitoban museums document different aspects of the province&#x27;s heritage. The Manitoba Museum is the largest museum in Manitoba and focuses on Manitoban history from prehistory to the 1920s. The full-size replica of the Nonsuch is the museum&#x27;s showcase piece. The Manitoba Children&#x27;s Museum at The Forks presents exhibits for children. There are two museums dedicated to the native flora and fauna of Manitoba: the Living Prairie Museum, a tall grass prairie preserve featuring 160 species of grasses and wildflowers, and FortWhyte Alive, a park encompassing prairie, lake, forest and wetland habitats, home to a large herd of bison. The Canadian Fossil Discovery Centre houses the largest collection of marine reptile fossils in Canada. Other museums feature the history of aviation, marine transport, and railways in the area. The Canadian Museum for Human Rights is the first Canadian national museum outside of the National Capital Region.

=== Media ===

Winnipeg has two daily newspapers: the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot;, a broadsheet with the highest circulation numbers in Manitoba, as well as the &quot;Winnipeg Sun&quot;, a smaller tabloid-style paper. There are several ethnic weekly newspapers, including the weekly French-language &quot;La Liberté&quot;, and regional and national magazines based in the city. Brandon has two newspapers: the daily &quot;Brandon Sun&quot; and the weekly &quot;Wheat City Journal&quot;. Many small towns have local newspapers.

There are five English-language television stations and one French-language station based in Winnipeg. The Global Television Network (owned by Canwest) is headquartered in the city. Winnipeg is home to twenty-one AM and FM radio stations, two of which are French-language stations. Brandon&#x27;s five local radio stations are provided by Astral Media and Westman Communications Group. In addition to the Brandon and Winnipeg stations, radio service is provided in rural areas and smaller towns by Golden West Broadcasting, Corus Entertainment, and local broadcasters. CBC Radio broadcasts local and national programming throughout the province. Native Communications is devoted to indigenous programming and broadcasts to many of the isolated native communities as well as to larger cities.
== Sports ==
Manitoba has six professional sports teams: the Winnipeg Sea Bears (Canadian Elite Basketball League) the Winnipeg Blue Bombers (Canadian Football League), the Winnipeg Jets (National Hockey League) and Manitoba Moose (American Hockey League), the Winnipeg Goldeyes (American Association), and Valour FC (Canadian Premier League). The province was previously home to another team called the Winnipeg Jets, which played in the World Hockey Association and National Hockey League from 1972 until 1996, when financial troubles prompted a sale and move of the team to Arizona, where they became the Phoenix Coyotes. A second incarnation of the Winnipeg Jets returned after True North Sports &amp; Entertainment bought the Atlanta Thrashers and moved the team to Winnipeg in time for the 2011 hockey season. Manitoba has one major junior-level ice hockey team, the Western Hockey League&#x27;s Brandon Wheat Kings, and one junior football team, the Winnipeg Rifles of the Canadian Junior Football League. It is also home to two teams in the Western Women&#x27;s Canadian Football League: the Manitoba Fearless and Winnipeg Wolfpack. The Manitoba Herd, meanwhile, compete in the National Ringette League.

The province is represented in university athletics by the university of Manitoba Bisons, the university of Winnipeg Wesmen, and the Brandon University Bobcats. All three teams compete in the Canada West Universities Athletic Association, a regional division of U Sports.

Curling is an important winter sport in the province with Manitoba producing more men&#x27;s national champions than any other province, while additionally in the top 3 women&#x27;s national champions, as well as multiple world champions in the sport. The province also hosts the world&#x27;s largest curling tournament in the MCA Bonspiel.

Although not as prominent as ice hockey and curling, long track speed skating also features as a notable and top winter sport in Manitoba. The province has produced some of the world&#x27;s best female speed skaters including Susan Auch and the country&#x27;s top Olympic medal earners Cindy Klassen and Clara Hughes.

The mountain was named after Sir William Edmond Logan, a Canadian geologist and founder of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC). Mount Logan is located within Kluane National Park Reserve in southwestern Yukon, less than north of the Yukon–Alaska border. Mount Logan is the source of the Hubbard and Logan glaciers. Although many shield volcanoes are much larger in size and mass, Mount Logan is believed to have the largest base circumference of any non-volcanic mountain on Earth, including a massif with eleven peaks over . Mount Logan is the 6th most topographically prominent peak on Earth.

Due to active tectonic uplifting, Mount Logan is still rising in height (approximately per year). Before 1992, the exact elevation of Mount Logan was unknown and measurements ranged from . In May 1992, a GSC expedition climbed Mount Logan and fixed the current height of using GPS.

Temperatures are extremely low on and near Mount Logan. On the plateau, air temperature hovers around in the winter and reaches near freezing in summer with the median temperature for the year around . Minimal snow melt leads to a significant ice cap, almost thick in certain spots.

==Peaks of the massif==
The Mount Logan massif is considered to contain all the surrounding peaks with less than of prominence, as listed below:

== Discovery and naming ==
Mount Logan is not readily visible from the surrounding lowlands or the coast, due to its position in the heart of the Saint Elias Mountains, although it can be seen from out to sea. Pictures taken across Yakutat Bay to the south southeast suggest it is visible from near Yakutat. Its first reported sighting was in 1890 by Israel C. Russell, during an expedition to nearby Mount Saint Elias, from the crest of the Pinnacle Pass Hills (). He wrote: &quot;The clouds parting toward the northeast revealed several giant peaks not before seen... One stranger, rising in three white domes far above the clouds, was especially magnificent&quot;. Russell gave the mountain its present name.

In 1894, Mount Logan&#x27;s elevation was determined to be about , making it the highest known peak in North America at the time. In 1898, Denali was determined to be higher.

==Ascent attempts==

===First ascent===

In 1922, a geologist approached the Alpine Club of Canada with the suggestion that the club send a team to the mountain to reach the summit for the first time. An international team of Canadian, British and American climbers was assembled the following year, initially planning an attempt in 1924 but forced by funding and preparation delays to postpone the trip until 1925. The international team of climbers began their journey in early May, crossing the mainland from the Pacific coast by train. They then walked the remaining to within of the Logan Glacier where they established base camp. In the early evening of June 23, 1925, Albert H. MacCarthy (leader), H.F. Lambart, Allen Carpé, Norman H. Read, W.W. Foster, and Andy Taylor stood on top for the first time. It had taken them 65 days to approach the mountain from the nearest town (McCarthy across the border in Alaska), reach the summit, and return, with all climbers intact, although some of them suffered severe frostbite.

===Subsequent notable ascents and attempts===

* 1957 &quot;East Ridge&quot;. Don Monk, Gil Roberts and three others (US) reached the East Peak on July 19 after a 24-day climb.
*1959 &quot;East Ridge&quot;, second ascent and first alpine-style ascent, Hans Gmoser and five others (Canada). Starting from Kluane Lake, they hiked and skied to reach the base of the mountain. They climbed the ridge in six days and summited the East Peak on June 12.
* 1965 &quot;Hummingbird Ridge&quot; (South Ridge). Dick Long, Allen Steck, John Evans, Jim Wilson, Franklin Coale Sr., and Paul Bacon (US) over 30 days, mid-July to Mid-August. Fred Beckey remarked: &quot;When they got back we just couldn&#x27;t believe that they had climbed that thing. We didn&#x27;t think they had a chance&quot;. This climb is featured in &quot;Fifty Classic Climbs of North America&quot;. As of 2023 the climb remains unrepeated.
* 1967, July, the first traverse of Mt. Logan was made by Vin Hoemann and Will Harrison, starting at the &quot;HubSew&quot; ridge over the main summit. Team members Alexander Bittenbinder, David Shaw, and Edward Ward joined them via the East Ridge.
* 1967, August, the first ski descent of the mountain was made in two stages by Daniel C. Taylor main summit to the Kluane glacier 
* 1977 &quot;Warbler Ridge&quot;. Dave Jones, Frank Baumann, Fred Thiessen, Jay Page (all from Canada) and Rene Bucher (Swiss) in 22 days.
* 1978 &quot; West Ridge&quot;. Steve Davis (WA), Jon Waterman, George Sievewright, Roger Hurt (NH). Climbed ridge in 27 days &quot;capsule-style&quot;.
* 1979 &quot;Northwest Ridge&quot; Michael Down (CA), Paul Kindree, John Howe, Reid Carter and John Wittmayer climbed to the summit over 22 days, topping out on June 19.
* 1979 &quot;South-Southwest Ridge&quot;. Raymond Jotterand (CA), Alan Burgess, Jim Elzinga and John Lauchlan reached the summit after 15 days of climbing on June 30 and July 1.
* 1986 First winter ascent by Todd Frankiewicz, Willy Hersman, Steve Koslow, George Rooney, Vernon Tejas and John Bauman via the &quot;King’s Trench Route&quot; on March 16.
* 1987 David Cheesmond and Catherine Freer disappeared while attempting to repeat the &quot;Hummingbird Ridge&quot;.
* 1992 June 6, an expedition sponsored by the Royal Canadian Geographic Society confirmed the height of Mount Logan using GPS. The leader was Michael Schmidt, with Lisel Currie, Leo Nadeay, Charlie Roots, J-C. Lavergne, Roger Laurilla, Patrick Morrow, Karl Nagy, Sue Gould, Alan Björn, Lloyd Freese, Kevin McLaughlin and Rick Staley.
* 2005 late May. Three climbers from the Vancouver-based North Shore Rescue team became stranded on the mountain. A joint operation by Canadian and American forces rescued the three climbers and took them to Anchorage, Alaska for treatment of frostbite.
* 2017 May 23. 15-year-old Naomi Prohaska reached the summit, the youngest person to do so. She was part of a team led by her father.
* 2018 June 14. The first all US veteran team reached the summit. The six-person team was unguided and part of the US non-profit organization Veterans Expeditions.

== Climbing rules ==
In January 2020, due to the cost of search and rescue operations in recent years, Parks Canada announced new rules for climbing Mount Logan:
* No solo expeditions
* No winter expeditions (which also includes all of Kluane National Park)
* Climbers must have insurance to cover the cost of search and rescue.
There had been eight rescue missions in the previous seven years in Kluane National Park. Each mission typically cost between $60,000 to $100,000 CAD which is paid for by Canadian taxpayers. A Parks Canada spokesperson said the new rules are to help reduce the financial burden to taxpayers.

==Proposed renaming==
Following the death of Pierre Trudeau, former Prime Minister of Canada, in 2000, then Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, a close friend of Trudeau, proposed renaming the mountain Mount Trudeau.
However opposition from Yukoners, mountaineers, geologists, Trudeau&#x27;s political critics, and many other Canadians forced the plan to be dropped. A mountain in the Premier Range of British Columbia was named Mount Pierre Elliott Trudeau instead.

==In popular culture==
&quot;X-Men&quot; writer Chris Claremont was inspired by Mount Logan for the adopted name of the superhero Wolverine; Claremont said in an interview that &quot;the idea was the tallest mountain being the name of the shortest character&quot;.

<doc id="18932" wikidata="Q11118951" url="?curid=18932" title="Media bias">
<text>Media bias occurs when journalists and news producers show bias in how they report and cover news. The term &quot;media bias&quot; implies a pervasive or widespread bias contravening of the standards of journalism, rather than the perspective of an individual journalist or article. The direction and degree of media bias in various countries is widely disputed.

Practical limitations to media neutrality include the inability of journalists to report all available stories and facts, and the requirement that selected facts be linked into a coherent narrative. Government influence, including overt and covert censorship, biases the media in some countries, for example China, North Korea, Syria and Myanmar. Politics and media bias may interact with each other; the media has the ability to influence politicians, and politicians may have the power to influence the media. This can change the distribution of power in society. Market forces may also cause bias. Examples include bias introduced by the ownership of media, including a concentration of media ownership, the subjective selection of staff, or the perceived preferences of an intended audience.

Assessing possible bias is one aspect of media literacy, which is studied at schools of journalism, university departments (including media studies, cultural studies, and peace studies). Other focuses beyond political bias include international differences in reporting, as well as bias in reporting of particular issues such as economic class or environmental interests. Academic findings around bias can also differ significantly from public discourse and understanding of the term.

== Types ==
In the 2017 Oxford Handbook of Political Communication, S. Robert Lichter described how in academic circles, media bias is more of a hypothesis to explain various patterns in news coverage than any fully-elaborated theory, and that a variety of potentially overlapping types of bias have been proposed that remain widely debated.

Various proposed hypotheses of media bias have included:
* Advertising bias, when stories are selected or slanted to please advertisers.
* Anti-science bias, when stories promote superstition or other non-scientific ideas.
* Concision bias, a tendency to report views that can be summarized succinctly, crowding out more unconventional views that take time to explain.
* Content bias, differential treatment of the parties in political conflicts, where biased news presents only one side of the conflict.
* Corporate bias, when stories are selected or slanted to please corporate owners of media.
* Coverage bias when media choose to report only negative news about one party or ideology
* Decision-making bias, means that the motivation, frame of mind, or beliefs of the journalists will have an impact on their writing. It is generally pejorative.
* Demand-driven bias.
* Demographic bias, where factors such as gender, race, and social and economic status influence reporting and can be a factor in different coverage of various demographic groups.
* Distortion bias, when the fact or reality is distorted or fabricated in the news.
* Episodic framing of television, for example, can lead people to ascribe blame to individuals instead of society, in contrast to thematic framing that leads people to look more at societal causes.
* False balance and false equivalence occur when an issue is presented as having equally-compelling reasons on both sides, despite disproportionate amounts of evidence favoring one (also known as undue weight).
* False timeliness, implying that an event is a new event, and thus deriving notability, without addressing past events of the same kind.
* Gatekeeping bias (also known as selectivity or selection bias), when stories are selected or deselected, sometimes on ideological grounds (see spike). It is sometimes also referred to as agenda bias, when the focus is on political actors and whether they are covered based on their preferred policy issues.
* Mainstream bias, a tendency to report what everyone else is reporting, and to avoid stories that will offend anyone. This type of bias can result in the homogenization of information, diminishing diversity in media content and negatively impacting both media consumption and the overall user experience.
* Negativity bias (or bad news bias), a tendency to show negative events and portray politics as less of a debate on policy and more of a zero-sum struggle for power. Excessive criticism or negativity can lead to cynicism and disengagement from politics.
* Partisan bias, a tendency to report to serve particular political party leaning.
* Sensationalism, bias in favor of the exceptional over the ordinary, giving the impression that rare events, such as airplane crashes, are more common than common events, such as automobile crashes. &quot;Hierarchy of death&quot; and &quot;missing white woman syndrome&quot; are examples of this phenomenon.
* Speculative content, when stories focus not on what has occurred, but primarily on what might occur, using words like &quot;could&quot;, &quot;might&quot;, or &quot;what if&quot;, without labeling the article as analysis or opinion.
* Statement bias (also known as tonality bias or presentation bias), when media coverage is slanted towards or against particular actors or issues.
* Structural bias, when an actor or issue receives more or less favorable coverage as a result of newsworthiness and media routines, not as the result of ideological decisions (e.g. incumbency bonus).
* Supply-driven bias
* Tuchman&#x27;s Law suggests how people overestimate the risk from dangers that are disproportionately discussed in media.
* Ventriloquism, when experts or witnesses are quoted in a way that intentionally voices the author&#x27;s own opinion.

An ongoing and unpublished research project named &quot;The Media Bias Taxonomy&quot; is attempting to assess the various definitions and meanings of media bias. While still ongoing, it attempts to summarize the domain as the distinct subcategories linguistic bias (encompassing linguistic intergroup bias, framing bias, epistemological bias, bias by semantic properties, and connotation bias), text-level context bias (featuring statement bias, phrasing bias, and spin bias), reporting-level context bias (highlighting selection bias, coverage bias, and proximity bias), cognitive biases (such as selective exposure and partisan bias), and related concepts like framing effects, hate speech, sentiment analysis, and group biases (encompassing gender bias, racial bias, and religion bias). The authors emphasize the complex nature of detecting and mitigating bias across different media content and contexts.

== History ==

John Milton&#x27;s 1644 pamphlet &quot;Areopagitica, a Speech for the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing&quot; was one of the first publications advocating freedom of the press.

In the 19th century, journalists began to recognize the concept of unbiased reporting as an integral part of journalistic ethics. This coincided with the rise of journalism as a powerful social force. Even today, the most conscientiously objective journalists cannot avoid accusations of bias.

Like newspapers, the broadcast media (radio and television) have been used as a mechanism for propaganda from their earliest days, a tendency made more pronounced by the initial ownership of broadcast spectrum by national governments. Although a process of media deregulation has placed the majority of the western broadcast media in private hands, there still exists a strong government presence, or even monopoly, in the broadcast media of many countries across the globe. At the same time, the concentration of media ownership in private hands, and frequently amongst a comparatively small number of individuals, has also led to accusations of media bias.

There are many examples of accusations of bias being used as a political tool, sometimes resulting in government censorship.
* In the United States, in 1798, Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, which prohibited newspapers from publishing &quot;false, scandalous, or malicious writing&quot; against the government, including any public opposition to any law or presidential act. This act was in effect until 1801.
* During the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln accused newspapers in the border states of bias in favor of the Southern cause, and ordered many newspapers closed.
* Antisemitic politicians who favored the United States entering World War II on the Nazi side asserted that the international media were controlled by Jews, and that reports of German mistreatment of Jews were biased and without foundation. Hollywood was accused of Jewish bias, and films such as Charlie Chaplin’s &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; were offered as alleged proof.
* In the US during the labor union movement and the civil rights movement, newspapers supporting liberal social reform were accused by conservative newspapers of communist bias. Film and television media were accused of bias in favor of mixing of the races, and many television programs with racially mixed casts, such as &quot;I Spy&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot;, were not aired on Southern stations.
* During the war between the United States and North Vietnam, Vice President Spiro Agnew accused newspapers of anti-American bias, and in a famous speech delivered in San Diego in 1970, called anti-war protesters &quot;the nattering nabobs of negativism.&quot;

Not all accusations of bias are political. Science writer Martin Gardner has accused the entertainment media of anti-science bias. He claimed that television programs such as &quot;The X-Files&quot; promote superstition. In contrast, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which is funded by businesses, accuses the media of being biased in favor of science and against business interests, and of credulously reporting science that shows that greenhouse gasses cause global warming.

== Structural (Non-ideological) biases ==
While most accusations of bias tend to revolve around ideological disagreements, other forms of bias are cast as structural in nature. There is little agreement on how they operate or originate but some involve economics, government policies, norms, and the individual creating the news. Some examples, according to Cline (2009) include commercial bias, temporal bias, visual bias, bad news bias, narrative bias, status quo bias, fairness bias, expediency bias, class bias and glory bias (or the tendency to glorify the reporter).

There is also a growing economics literature on mass media bias, both on the theoretical and the empirical side. On the theoretical side the focus is on understanding to what extent the political positioning of mass media outlets is mainly driven by demand or supply factors. This literature was surveyed by Andrea Prat of Columbia University and David Stromberg of Stockholm University in 2013.

=== Supply-driven bias ===
When an organization prefers consumers to take particular actions, this would be supply-driven bias.

Implications of supply-driven bias:
* Supply-side incentives are able to control and affect consumers. Strong persuasive incentives can even be more powerful than profit motivation.
* Competition leads to decreased bias and hinders the impact of persuasive incentives. And it tends to make the results more responsive to consumer demand.
* Competition can improve consumer treatment, but it may affect the total surplus due to the ideological payoff of the owners.

An example of supply-driven bias is Zinman and Zitzewitz&#x27;s study of snowfall reporting. Ski attractions tend to be biased in snowfall reporting, reporting higher snowfall than official forecasts.

David Baron suggests a game-theoretic model of mass media behaviour in which, given that the pool of journalists systematically leans towards the left or the right, mass media outlets maximise their profits by providing content that is biased in the same direction as their employees.

Herman and Chomsky (1988) cite supply-driven bias including around the use of official sources, funding from advertising, efforts to discredit independent media (&quot;flak&quot;), and &quot;anti-communist&quot; ideology, resulting in news in favor of U.S. corporate interests.

=== Demand-driven bias ===
Demand from media consumer for a particular type of bias is known as demand-driven bias. Consumers tend to favor a biased media based on their preferences, an example of confirmation bias.

There are three major factors that make this choice for consumers:
* Delegation, which takes a filtering approach to bias.
* Psychological utility, &quot;consumers get direct utility from news whose bias matches their own prior beliefs.&quot;
* Reputation, consumers will make choices based on their prior beliefs and the reputation of the media companies.

Demand-side incentives are often not related to distortion. Competition can still affect the welfare and treatment of consumers, but it is not very effective in changing bias compared to the supply side.

In demand-driven bias, preferences and attitudes of readers can be monitored on social media, and mass media write news that caters to readers based on them. Mass media skew news driven by viewership and profits, leading to the media bias. And readers are also easily attracted to lurid news, although they may be biased and not true enough.

Dong, Ren, and Nickerson investigated Chinese stock-related news and weibos in 20132014 from Sina Weibo and Sina Finance (4.27 million pieces of news and 43.17 million weibos) and found that news that aligns with Weibo users&#x27; beliefs are more likely to attract readers. Also, the information in biased reports also influences the decision-making of the readers.

In Raymond and Taylor&#x27;s test of weather forecast bias, they investigated weather reports of the New York Times during the games of the baseball team the Giants from 1890 to 1899. Their findings suggest that the New York Times produce biased weather forecast results depending on the region in which the Giants play. When they played at home in Manhattan, reports of sunny days predicting increased. From this study, Raymond and Taylor found that bias pattern in New York Times weather forecasts was consistent with demand-driven bias.

Sendhil Mullainathan and Andrei Shleifer of Harvard University constructed a behavioural model in 2005, which is built around the assumption that readers and viewers hold beliefs that they would like to see confirmed by news providers, which they argue the market then provides.

Demand-driven models evaluate to what extent media bias stems from companies providing consumers what they want. Stromberg posits that because wealthier viewers result in more advertising revenue, the media as a result ends up targeted to whiter and more conservative consumers while wealthier urban markets may be more liberal and produce an opposite effect in newspapers in particular.

=== Social media ===
Perceptions of media bias may also be related to the rise of social media. The rise of social media has undermined the economic model of traditional media. The number of people who rely upon social media has increased and the number who rely on print news has decreased.
Studies of social media and disinformation suggest that the political economy of social media platforms has led to a commodification of information on social media. Messages are prioritized and rewarded based on their virality and shareability rather than their truth, promoting radical, shocking click-bait content. 
Social media influences people in part because of psychological tendencies to accept incoming information, to take feelings as evidence of truth, and to not check assertions against facts and memories.

Media bias in social media is also reflected in hostile media effect. Social media has a place in disseminating news in modern society, where viewers are exposed to other people&#x27;s comments while reading news articles. In their 2020 study, Gearhart and her team showed that viewers&#x27; perceptions of bias increased and perceptions of credibility decreased after seeing comments with which they held different opinions.

Within the United States, Pew Research Center reported that 64% of Americans believed that social media had a toxic effect on U.S. society and culture in July 2020. Only 10% of Americans believed that it had a positive effect on society. Some of the main concerns with social media lie with the spread of deliberately false information and the spread of hate and extremism. Social scientist experts explain the growth of misinformation and hate as a result of the increase in echo chambers.

Fueled by confirmation bias, online echo chambers allow users to be steeped within their own ideology. Because social media is tailored to your interests and your selected friends, it is an easy outlet for political echo chambers. Another Pew Research poll in 2019 showed that 28% of US adults &quot;often&quot; find their news through social media, and 55% of US adults get their news from social media either &quot;often&quot; or &quot;sometimes&quot;. Additionally, more people are reported as going to social media for their news as the COVID-19 pandemic has restricted politicians to online campaigns and social media live streams. GCF Global encourages online users to avoid echo chambers by interacting with different people and perspectives along with avoiding the temptation of confirmation bias.

Yu-Ru and Wen-Ting&#x27;s research looks into how liberals and conservatives conduct themselves on Twitter after three mass shooting events. Although they would both show negative emotions towards the incidents they differed in the narratives they were pushing. Both sides would often contrast in what the root cause was along with who is deemed the victims, heroes, and villain/s. There was also a decrease in any conversation that was considered proactive.

Media scholar Siva Vaidhyanathan, in his book &quot;Anti-Social Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy&quot; (2018), argues that on social media networks, the most emotionally charged and polarizing topics usually predominate, and that &quot;If you wanted to build a machine that would distribute propaganda to millions of people, distract them from important issues, energize hatred and bigotry, erode social trust, undermine journalism, foster doubts about science, and engage in massive surveillance all at once, you would make something a lot like Facebook.&quot;

In a 2021 report, researchers at the New York University&#x27;s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights found that Republicans&#x27; frequent argument that social media companies like Facebook and Twitter have an &quot;anti-conservative&quot; bias is false and lacks any reliable evidence supporting it; the report found that right-wing voices are in fact dominant on social media and that the claim that these platforms have an anti-conservative lean &quot;is itself a form of disinformation.&quot;

A 2021 study in &quot;Nature Communications&quot; examined political bias on social media by assessing the degree to which Twitter users were exposed to content on the left and rightspecifically, exposure on the home timeline (the &quot;news feed&quot;). The study found that conservative Twitter accounts are exposed to content on the right, whereas liberal accounts are exposed to moderate content, shifting those users&#x27; experiences toward the political center. The study determined: &quot;Both in terms of information to which they are exposed and content they produce, drifters initialized with Right-leaning sources stay on the conservative side of the political spectrum. Those initialized with Left-leaning sources, on the other hand, tend to drift toward the political center: they are exposed to more conservative content and even start spreading it.&quot; These findings held true for both hashtags and links. The study also found that conservative accounts are exposed to substantially more low-credibility content than other accounts.

A 2022 study in &quot;PNAS,&quot; using a long-running massive-scale randomized experiment, found that the political right enjoys higher algorithmic amplification than the political left in six out of seven countries studied. In the US, algorithmic amplification favored right-leaning news sources.

Media bias is also reflected in search systems in social media. Kulshrestha and her team found through research in 2018 that the top-ranked results returned by these search engines can influence users&#x27; perceptions when they conduct searches for events or people, which is particularly reflected in political bias and polarizing topics.

=== Language ===
Tanya Pamplone warns that since much of international journalism takes place in English, there can be instances where stories and journalists from countries where English is not taught have difficulty entering the global conversation.

Language may also introduce a more subtle form of bias. The selection of metaphors and analogies, or the inclusion of personal information in one situation but not another can introduce bias, such as a gender bias.

== Religion ==
The Satanic panic, a moral panic and episode of national hysteria that emerged in the U.S. in the 1980s (and thereafter to Canada, Britain, and Australia), was reinforced by tabloid media and infotainment. Scholar Sarah Hughes, in a study published in 2016, argued that the panic &quot;both reflected and shaped a cultural climate dominated by the overlapping worldviews of politically active conservatives&quot; whose ideology &quot;was incorporated into the panic and reinforced through&quot; tabloid media, sensationalist television and magazine reporting, and local news. Although the panic dissipated in the 1990s after it was discredited by journalists and the courts, Hughes argues that the panic has had an enduring influence in American culture and politics even decades later.

In 2012, &quot;Huffington Post&quot;, columnist Jacques Berlinerblau argued that secularism has often been misinterpreted in the media as another word for atheism.

According to Stuart A. Wright in 1997, there are six factors that contribute to media bias against minority religions: first, the knowledge and familiarity of journalists with the subject matter; second, the degree of cultural accommodation of the targeted religious group; third, limited economic resources available to journalists; fourth, time constraints; fifth, sources of information used by journalists; and finally, the front-end/back-end disproportionality of reporting. According to Yale Law professor Stephen Carter, &quot;it has long been the American habit to be more suspicious ofand more repressive towardreligions that stand outside the mainline Protestant-Roman Catholic-Jewish troika that dominates America&#x27;s spiritual life.&quot; As for front-end/back-end disproportionality, Wright says: &quot;news stories on unpopular or marginal religions frequently are predicated on unsubstantiated allegations or government actions based on faulty or weak evidence occurring at the front-end of an event. As the charges weighed in against material evidence, these cases often disintegrate. Yet rarely is there equal space and attention in the mass media given to the resolution or outcome of the incident. If the accused are innocent, often the public is not made aware.&quot;

== Politics ==
Academic studies tend not to confirm a popular media narrative of liberal journalists producing a left-leaning media bias in the U.S., though some studies suggest economic incentives may have that effect. Instead, the studies reviewed by S. Robert Lichter generally found the media to be a conservative force in politics.

== Impacts of bias ==
Critics of media bias tend to point out how a particular bias benefits existing power structures, undermines democratic outcomes and fails to inform people with the information they need to make decisions around public policy.

Experiments have shown that media bias affects behavior and more specifically influences the readership&#x27;s political ideology. A study found higher politicization rates with increased exposure to the Fox News channel, while a 2009 study found a weakly-linked decrease in support for the Bush administration when given a free subscription to the right-leaning &quot;The Washington Times&quot; or left-leaning &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

== Trust in media ==
Perceptions of media bias and trust in the media have changed significantly from 1985-2011 in the US. Pew studies reported that the percentage of Americans who trusted that news media “get their facts straight” dropped from 55% in 1985, to 25% in 2011. Similarly, the percentage of Americans who trusted that news organizations would deal fairly with all sides when dealing with political and social issues dropped from 34% in 1985 to 16% in 2011. By 2011 almost two-thirds of respondents considered news organizations to be “politically biased in their reporting”, up from 45% in 1985. Similar decreases in trust have been reported by Gallup, with In 2022, half of Americans responded that they believed that news organizations would deliberately attempt to mislead them.

Jonathan M. Ladd (2012), who has conducted intensive studies of media trust and media bias, concluded that the primary cause of belief in media bias is telling people that particular media are biased. People who are told that a medium is biased tend to believe that it is biased, and this belief is unrelated to whether that medium is actually biased or not. The only other factor with as strong an influence on belief that media is biased, he found, was extensive coverage of celebrities. A majority of people see such media as biased, while at the same time preferring media with extensive coverage of celebrities.

== Efforts to correct bias ==
NPR&#x27;s ombudsman wrote a 2011 article about how to note the political leanings of think tanks or other groups that the average listener might not know much about before citing a study or statistic from an organization.

=== Algorithms ===

Polis (or Pol.is) is a social media website that allows people to share their opinions and ideas while elevating ideas that have more consensus. By September 2020, it had helped to form the core of dozens of pieces of legislation passed in Taiwan. Proponents had sought out a way to inform the government with the opinions of citizens between elections while also providing an online outlet for citizens that was less divisive and more informative than social media and other large websites.

Attempts have also been made to utilize machine-learning to analyze the bias of text. For example, person-oriented framing analysis attempts to identify frames, i.e., &quot;perspectives&quot;, in news coverage on a topic by determining how each person mentioned in the topic&#x27;s coverage is portrayed.

Another approach, matrix-based news aggregation can help to reveal differences in media coverage between different countries, for example.

=== Giving time to both sides ===
A technique used to avoid bias is the &quot;point/counterpoint&quot; or &quot;round table&quot;, an adversarial format in which representatives of opposing views comment on an issue. This approach theoretically allows diverse views to appear in the media. However, the person organizing the report still has the responsibility to choose reporters or journalists that represent a diverse or balanced set of opinions, to ask them non-prejudicial questions, and to edit or arbitrate their comments fairly. When done carelessly, a point/counterpoint can be as unfair as a simple biased report, by suggesting that the &quot;losing&quot; side lost on its merits. Besides these challenges, exposing news consumers to differing viewpoints seems to be beneficial for a balanced understanding and more critical assessment of current events and latent topics. Using this format can also lead to accusations that the reporter has created a misleading appearance that viewpoints have equal validity (sometimes called &quot;false balance&quot;). This may happen when a taboo exists around one of the viewpoints, or when one of the representatives habitually makes claims that are easily shown to be inaccurate.

The CBC and Radio Canada, its French language counterpart, are governed by the 1991 Broadcasting Act, which states programming should be &quot;varied and comprehensive, providing balance of information...provide a reasonable opportunity for the public to be exposed to the expression of differing views on matters of public concern.&quot;

<doc id="18934" wikidata="Q9458" url="?curid=18934" title="Muhammad">
<text>Muhammad (8 June 632 CE) was an Arab religious and political leader and the founder of Islam. According to Islam, he was a prophet who was divinely inspired to preach and confirm the monotheistic teachings of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets. He is believed to be the Seal of the Prophets in Islam, and along with the Quran, his teachings and normative examples form the basis for Islamic religious belief.

Muhammad was born in Mecca. He was the son of Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib and Amina bint Wahb. His father, Abdullah, the son of Quraysh tribal leader Abd al-Muttalib ibn Hashim, died around the time Muhammad was born. His mother Amina died when he was six, leaving Muhammad an orphan. He was raised under the care of his grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib, and paternal uncle, Abu Talib. In later years, he would periodically seclude himself in a mountain cave named Hira for several nights of prayer. When he was 40, , Muhammad reported being visited by Gabriel in the cave and receiving his first revelation from God. In 613, Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly, proclaiming that &#x27;God is One&#x27;, that complete &#x27;submission&#x27; () to God () is the right way of life (), and that he was a prophet and messenger of God, similar to the other prophets in Islam.

Muhammad&#x27;s followers were initially few in number, and experienced persecution by Meccan polytheists for 13 years. To escape ongoing persecution, he sent some of his followers to Abyssinia in 615, before he and his followers migrated from Mecca to Medina (then known as Yathrib) later in 622. This event, the , marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar, also known as the Hijri calendar. In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina. In December 629, after eight years of intermittent fighting with Meccan tribes, Muhammad gathered an army of 10,000 Muslim converts and marched on the city of Mecca. The conquest went largely uncontested, and Muhammad seized the city with minimal casualties. In 632, a few months after returning from the Farewell Pilgrimage, he fell ill and died. By the time of his death, most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam.

The revelations () that Muhammad reported receiving until his death form the verses () of the Quran, upon which Islam is based, are regarded by Muslims as the verbatim word of God and his final revelation. Besides the Quran, Muhammad&#x27;s teachings and practices, found in transmitted reports, known as hadith, and in his biography (), are also upheld and used as sources of Islamic law. Apart from Islam, Muhammad is regarded as one of the prophets in the Druze faith and a Manifestation of God in the Baháʼí Faith.

==Biographical sources==

===Quran===

The Quran is the central religious text of Islam. Muslims believe it represents the words of God revealed by the archangel Gabriel to Muhammad. The Quran is mainly addressed to a single &quot;Messenger of God&quot; who is referred to as Muhammad in a number of verses. The Quranic text also describes the settlement of his followers in Yathrib after their expulsion by the Quraysh, and briefly mentions military encounters such as the Muslim victory at Badr.

The Quran, however, provides minimal assistance for Muhammad&#x27;s chronological biography; most Quranic verses do not provide significant historical context and timeline. Almost none of Muhammad&#x27;s companions are mentioned by name in the Quran, hence not providing sufficient information for a concise biography. The Birmingham Quran manuscript has been radiocarbon dated to between 568 and 645, though the manuscript&#x27;s discoverer has asserted that the text on the parchment is from a later date.

===Early biographies===
Important sources regarding Muhammad&#x27;s life may be found in the historic works by writers of the 2nd and 3rd centuries of the Hijri era (mostly overlapping with the 8th and 9th centuries CE respectively). These include traditional Muslim biographies of Muhammad, which provide additional information about his life.

The earliest written (biographies of Muhammad and quotes attributed to him) is Ibn Ishaq&#x27;s &quot;Life of God&#x27;s Messenger&quot; written (150 AH). Although the original work was lost, this survives as extensive excerpts in works by Ibn Hisham and to a lesser extent by Al-Tabari. However, Ibn Hisham wrote in the preface to his biography of Muhammad that he omitted matters from Ibn Ishaq&#x27;s biography that &quot;would distress certain people&quot;. Another early historical source is the history of Muhammad&#x27;s campaigns by al-Waqidi ( AH), and the work of Waqidi&#x27;s secretary Ibn Sa&#x27;d al-Baghdadi ( AH). Due to these early biographical efforts, more is known about Muhammad than almost any other founder of a major religion. Many scholars accept these early biographies as authentic. However, Waqidi&#x27;s biography has been widely criticized by Islamic scholars for his methods, in particular his decision to omit his sources. Recent studies have led scholars to distinguish between traditions touching legal matters and purely historical events. In the legal group, traditions could have been subject to invention while historic events, aside from exceptional cases, may have been subject only to &quot;tendential shaping&quot;. Other scholars have criticized the reliability of this method, suggesting that one cannot neatly divide traditions into purely legal and historical categories. Western historians describe the purpose of these early biographies as largely to convey a message, rather than to strictly and accurately record history.

===Hadith===
Other important sources include the hadith collections, accounts of verbal and physical teachings and traditions attributed to Muhammad. Hadiths were compiled several generations after his death by Muslims including Muhammad al-Bukhari, Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj, Muhammad ibn Isa at-Tirmidhi, Abd ar-Rahman al-Nasai, Abu Dawood, Ibn Majah, Malik ibn Anas, al-Daraqutni.

Muslim scholars have typically placed a greater emphasis on the hadith instead of the biographical literature, since hadith maintain a traditional chain of transmission (); the lack of such a chain for the biographical literature makes it unverifiable in their eyes. The hadiths generally present an idealized view of Muhammad. Western scholars have expressed skepticism regarding the verifiability of these chains of transmission. It is widely believed by Western scholars that there was widespread fabrication of hadith during the early centuries of Islam to support certain theological and legal positions, and it has been suggested that it is &quot;very likely that a considerable number of that can be found in the collections did not actually originate with the Prophet&quot;. In addition, the meaning of a hadith may have drifted from its original telling to when it was finally written down, even if the chain of transmission is authentic. Overall, some Western academics have cautiously viewed the hadith collections as accurate historical sources, while the &quot;dominant paradigm&quot; in Western scholarship is to consider their reliability suspect. Scholars such as Wilferd Madelung do not reject the hadith which have been compiled in later periods, but judge them in their historical context.

== Meccan years ==
=== Early life ===

Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib ibn Hashim was born in Mecca , and his birthday is believed to be in the month of Rabi&#x27; al-Awwal. He belonged to the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe, which was a dominant force in western Arabia. While his clan was one of the more distinguished in the tribe, it seems to have experienced a lack of prosperity during his early years.
According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad was a , someone who professed monotheism in pre-Islamic Arabia. He is also claimed to have been a descendant of Ishmael, son of Abraham.

The name Muhammad means &quot;praiseworthy&quot; in Arabic and it appears four times in the Quran. He was also known as &quot;al-Amin&quot; () when he was young; however, historians differ as to whether it was given by people as a reflection of his nature or was simply a given name from his parents, i.e., a masculine form of his mother&#x27;s name &quot;Amina&quot;. Muhammad acquired the of Abu al-Qasim later in his life after the birth of his son Qasim, who died two years afterwards.

Islamic tradition states that Muhammad&#x27;s birth year coincided with the Year of the Elephant, when Abraha, the Aksumite viceroy in the former Himyarite Kingdom, unsuccessfully attempted to conquer Mecca. Recent studies, however, challenge this notion, as other evidence suggests that the expedition, if it had occurred, would have transpired substantially before Muhammad&#x27;s birth. Later Muslim scholars presumably linked Abraha&#x27;s renowned name to the narrative of Muhammad&#x27;s birth to elucidate the unclear passage about &quot;the men of elephants&quot; in Quran 105:1–5. &quot;The Oxford Handbook of Late Antiquity&quot; deems the tale of Abraha&#x27;s war elephant expedition as a myth.
Muhammad&#x27;s father, Abdullah, died almost six months before he was born. Muhammad then stayed with his foster mother, Halima bint Abi Dhu&#x27;ayb, and her husband until he was two years old. At the age of six, Muhammad lost his biological mother Amina to illness and became an orphan. For the next two years, until he was eight years old, Muhammad was under the guardianship of his paternal grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib, until the latter&#x27;s death. He then came under the care of his uncle, Abu Talib, the new leader of the Banu Hashim. Abu Talib&#x27;s brothers assisted with Muhammad&#x27;s learningHamza, the youngest, trained Muhammad in archery, swordsmanship, and martial arts. Another uncle, Abbas, provided Muhammad with a job leading caravans on the northern segment of the route to Syria.

The historical record of Mecca during Muhammad&#x27;s early life is limited and fragmentary, making it difficult to distinguish between fact and legend. Several Islamic narratives relate that Muhammad, as a child, went on a trading trip to Syria with his uncle Abu Talib and met a monk named Bahira, who is said to have then foretold his prophethood. There are multiple versions of the story with details that contradict each other. All accounts of Bahira and his meeting with Muhammad have been considered fictitious by modern historians as well as by some medieval Muslim scholars such as al-Dhahabi.

Sometime later in his life, Muhammad proposed marriage to his cousin and first love, Fakhitah bint Abi Talib. But likely owing to his poverty, his proposal was rejected by her father, Abu Talib, who chose a more illustrious suitor. When Muhammad was 25, his fortunes turned around; his business reputation caught the attention of his 40-year-old distant relative Khadija, a wealthy businesswoman who had staked out a successful career as a merchant in the caravan trade industry. She asked him to take one of her caravans into Syria, after which she was so impressed by his competence in the expedition that she proposed marriage to him; Muhammad accepted her offer and remained monogamous with her until her death.

In 605, the Quraysh decided to roof the Kaaba, which had previously consisted only of walls. A complete rebuild was needed to accommodate the new weight. Amid concerns about upsetting the deities, a man stepped forth with a pickaxe and exclaimed, &quot;O goddess! Fear not! Our intentions are only for the best.&quot; With that, he began demolishing it. The anxious Meccans awaited divine retribution overnight, but his unharmed continuation the next day was seen as a sign of heavenly approval. According to a narrative collected by Ibn Ishaq, when it was time to reattach the Black Stone, a dispute arose over which clan should have the privilege. It was determined that the first person to step into the Kaaba&#x27;s court would arbitrate. Muhammad took on this role, asking for a cloak. He placed the stone on it, guiding clan representatives to jointly elevate it to its position. He then personally secured it within the wall.

=== Beginnings of the Quran ===
The financial security Muhammad enjoyed from Khadija, his wealthy wife, gave him plenty of free time to spend in solitude in the cave of Hira. According to Islamic tradition, in 610, when he was 40 years old, the angel Gabriel appeared to him during his visit to the cave. The angel showed him a cloth with Quranic verses on it and instructed him to read. When Muhammad confessed his illiteracy, Gabriel choked him forcefully, nearly suffocating him, and repeated the command. As Muhammad reiterated his inability to read, Gabriel choked him again in a similar manner. This sequence took place once more before Gabriel finally recited the verses, allowing Muhammad to memorize them. These verses later constituted Quran 96:1-5.

When Muhammad came to his senses, he felt scared; he started to think that after all of this spiritual struggle, he had been visited by a jinn, which made him no longer want to live. In desperation, Muhammad fled from the cave and began climbing up towards the top of the mountain to jump to his death. But when he reached the summit, he experienced another vision, this time seeing a mighty being that engulfed the horizon and stared back at Muhammad even when he turned to face a different direction. This was the spirit of revelation (), which Muhammad later referred to as Gabriel; it was not a naturalistic angel, but rather a transcendent presence that resisted the ordinary limits of humanity and space.

Frightened and unable to understand the experience, Muhammad hurriedly staggered down the mountain to his wife Khadija. By the time he got to her, he was already crawling on his hands and knees, shaking wildly and crying &quot;Cover me!&quot;, as he thrust himself onto her lap. Khadija wrapped him in a cloak and tucked him in her arms until his fears dissipated. She had absolutely no doubts about his revelation; she insisted it was real and not a jinn. Muhammad was also reassured by Khadija&#x27;s Christian cousin Waraqah ibn Nawfal, who jubilantly exclaimed &quot;Holy! Holy! If you have spoken the truth to me, O Khadijah, there has come to him the great divinity who came to Moses aforetime, and lo, he is the prophet of his people.&quot; Khadija instructed Muhammad to let her know if Gabriel returned. When he appeared during their private time, Khadija conducted tests by having Muhammad sit on her left thigh, right thigh, and lap, inquiring Muhammad if the being was still present each time. After Khadija removed her clothes with Muhammad on her lap, he reported that Gabriel left at that moment. Khadija thus told him to rejoice as she concluded it was not Satan but an angel visiting him.

Muhammad&#x27;s demeanor during his moments of inspiration frequently led to allegations from his contemporaries that he was under the influence of a jinn, a soothsayer, or a magician, suggesting that his experiences during these events bore resemblance to those associated with such figures widely recognized in ancient Arabia. Nonetheless, these enigmatic seizure events might have served as persuasive evidence for his followers regarding the divine origin of his revelations. Some historians posit that the graphic descriptions of Muhammad&#x27;s condition in these instances are likely genuine, as they are improbable to have been concocted by later Muslims.

Shortly after Waraqa&#x27;s death, the revelations ceased for a period, causing Muhammad great distress and thoughts of suicide. On one occasion, he reportedly climbed a mountain intending to jump off. However, upon reaching the peak, Gabriel appeared to him, affirming his status as the true Messenger of God. This encounter soothed Muhammad, and he returned home. Later, when there was another long break between revelations, he repeated this action, but Gabriel intervened similarly, calming him and causing him to return home.

Muhammad was confident that he could distinguish his own thoughts from these messages. The early Quranic revelations utilized approaches of cautioning non-believers with divine punishment, while promising rewards to believers. They conveyed potential consequences like famine and killing for those who rejected Muhammad&#x27;s God and alluded to past and future calamities. The verses also stressed the imminent final judgment and the threat of hellfire for skeptics. Due to the complexity of the experience, Muhammad was initially very reluctant to tell others about his revelations; at first, he confided in only a few select family members and friends. According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad&#x27;s wife Khadija was the first to believe he was a prophet. She was followed by Muhammad&#x27;s ten-year-old cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib, close friend Abu Bakr, and adopted son Zayd. As word of Muhammad&#x27;s revelations continued to spread throughout the rest of his family, they became increasingly divided on the matter, with the youth and women generally believing in him, while most of the men in the elder generations were staunchly opposed.

=== Opposition in Mecca ===

Around 613, Muhammad began to preach to the public; many of his first followers were women, freedmen, servants, slaves, and other members of the lower social class. These converts keenly awaited each new revelation from Muhammad; when he recited it, they all would repeat after him and memorize it, and the literate ones recorded it in writing. Muhammad also introduced rituals to his group which included prayer () with physical postures that embodied complete surrender () to God, and almsgiving () as a requirement of the Muslim community (). By this point, Muhammad&#x27;s religious movement was known as (&#x27;purification&#x27;).

Initially, he had no serious opposition from the inhabitants of Mecca, who were indifferent to his proselytizing activities, but when he started to attack their beliefs, tensions arose. The Quraysh challenged him to perform miracles, such as bringing forth springs of water, yet he declined, reasoning that the regularities of nature already served as sufficient proof of God&#x27;s majesty. Some satirized his lack of success by wondering why God had not bestowed treasure upon him. Others called on him to visit Paradise and return with tangible parchment scrolls of the Quran. But Muhammad asserted that the Quran, in the form he conveyed it, was already an extraordinary proof.

According to Amr ibn al-As, several of the Quraysh gathered at Hijr and discussed how they had never faced such serious problems as they were facing from Muhammad. They said that he had derided their culture, denigrated their ancestors, scorned their faith, shattered their community, and cursed their gods. Sometime later, Muhammad came, kissing the Black Stone and performing the ritual . As Muhammad passed by them, they reportedly said hurtful things to him. The same happened when he passed by them a second time. On his third pass, Muhammad stopped and said, &quot;Will you listen to me, O Quraysh? By Him (God), who holds my life in His hand, I bring you slaughter.&quot; They fell silent and told him to go home, saying that he was not a violent man. The next day, a number of Quraysh approached him, asking if he had said what they had heard from their companions. He answered yes, and one of them seized him by his cloak. Abu Bakr intervened, tearfully saying, &quot;Would you kill a man for saying God is my Lord?&quot; And they left him.

The Quraysh attempted to entice Muhammad to quit preaching by giving him admission to the merchants&#x27; inner circle as well as an advantageous marriage, but he refused both of the offers. A delegation of them then, led by the leader of the Makhzum clan, known by the Muslims as Abu Jahl, went to Muhammad&#x27;s uncle Abu Talib, head of the Hashim clan and Muhammad&#x27;s caretaker, giving him an ultimatum to disown Muhammad:

Abu Talib politely dismissed them at first, thinking it was just a heated talk. But as Muhammad grew more vocal, Abu Talib requested Muhammad to not burden him beyond what he could bear, to which Muhammad wept and replied that he would not stop even if they put the sun in his right hand and the moon in his left. When he turned around, Abu Talib called him and said, &quot;Come back nephew, say what you please, for by God I will never give you up on any account.&quot;

===Quraysh delegation to Yathrib===

The leaders of the Quraysh sent Nadr ibn al-Harith and Uqba ibn Abi Mu&#x27;ayt to Yathrib to seek the opinions of the Jewish rabbis regarding Muhammad. The rabbis advised them to ask Muhammad three questions: recount the tale of young men who ventured forth in the first age; narrate the story of a traveler who reached both the eastern and western ends of the earth; and provide details about the spirit. If Muhammad answered correctly, they stated, he would be a Prophet; otherwise, he would be a liar. When they returned to Mecca and asked Muhammad the questions, he told them he would provide the answers the next day. However, 15 days passed without a response from his God, leading to gossip among the Meccans and causing Muhammad distress. At some point later, the angel Gabriel came to Muhammad and provided him with the answers.

In response to the first query, the Quran tells a story about a group of men sleeping in a cave (Quran 18:9–25), which scholars generally link to the legend of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus. For the second query, the Quran speaks of Dhu al-Qarnayn, literally &#x27;he of the two horns&#x27; (Quran 18:93–99), a tale that academics widely associate with the Alexander Romance. As for the third query, concerning the nature of the spirit, the Quranic revelation asserted that it was beyond human comprehension. Neither the Jews who devised the questions nor the Quraysh who posed them to Muhammad converted to Islam upon receiving the answers. Nadr and Uqba were later executed on Muhammad&#x27;s orders after the Battle of Badr, while other captives were held for ransom. As Uqba pleaded, &quot;But who will take care of my children, Muhammad?&quot; Muhammad responded, &quot;Hell!&quot;

=== Migration to Abyssinia and the incident of Satanic Verses ===
In 615, Muhammad sent some of his followers to emigrate to the Abyssinian Kingdom of Aksum and found a small colony under the protection of the Christian Ethiopian emperor Aṣḥama ibn Abjar. Among those who departed were Umm Habiba, the daughter of one of the Quraysh chiefs, Abu Sufyan, and her husband. The Quraysh then sent two men to retrieve them. Because leatherwork at the time was highly prized in Abyssinia, they gathered a lot of skins and transported them there so they could distribute some to each of the kingdom&#x27;s generals. But the king firmly rejected their request.

While Tabari and Ibn Hisham mentioned only one migration to Abyssinia, there were two sets according to Ibn Sa&#x27;d. Of these two, the majority of the first group returned to Mecca before the event of , while the majority of the second group remained in Abyssinia at the time and went directly to Medina after the event of . These accounts agree that persecution played a major role in Muhammad sending them there. According to W. Montgomery Watt, the episodes were more complex than the traditional accounts suggest; he proposes that there were divisions within the embryonic Muslim community, and that they likely went there to trade in competition with the prominent merchant families of Mecca. In Urwa&#x27;s letter preserved by Tabari, these emigrants returned after the conversion to Islam of a number of individuals in positions such as Hamza and Umar.

Along with many others, Tabari recorded that Muhammad was desperate, hoping for an accommodation with his tribe. So, while he was in the presence of a number of Quraysh, after delivering verses mentioning three of their favorite deities (Quran 53:19–20), Satan put upon his tongue two short verses: &quot;These are the high flying ones / whose intercession is to be hoped for.&quot; This led to a general reconciliation between Muhammad and the Meccans, and the Muslims in Abyssinia began to return home. However, the next day, Muhammad retracted these verses at the behest of Gabriel, claiming that they had been cast by Satan to his tongue and God had abrogated them. Instead, verses that revile those goddesses were then revealed. The returning Muslims thus had to make arrangements for clan protection before they could re-enter Mecca.

This Satanic Verses incident was reported en masse and documented by nearly all of the major biographers of Muhammad in Islam&#x27;s first two centuries, which according to them corresponds to Quran 22:52. But since the rise of the hadith movement and systematic theology with its new doctrines, including the , which claimed that Muhammad was infallible and thus could not be fooled by Satan, the historical memory of the early community has been reevaluated. By the 20th century, Muslim scholars unanimously rejected this incident. On the other hand, most European biographers of Muhammad recognize the veracity of this incident of satanic verses on the basis of the criterion of embarrassment. Historian Alfred T. Welch proposes that the period of Muhammad&#x27;s turning away from strict monotheism was likely far longer but was later encapsulated in a story that made it much shorter and implicated Satan as the culprit.

In 616, an agreement was established whereby all other Quraysh clans were to enforce a ban on the Banu Hashim, prohibiting trade and marriage with them. Nevertheless, Banu Hashim members could still move around Mecca freely. Despite facing increasing verbal abuse, Muhammad continued to navigate the streets and engage in public debates without being physically harmed. At a later point, a faction within Quraysh, sympathizing with Banu Hashim, initiated efforts to end the sanctions, resulting in a general consensus in 619 to lift the ban.

=== Attempt to establish himself in Ta&#x27;if ===

In 619, Muhammad faced a period of sorrow. His wife, Khadija, a crucial source of his financial and emotional support, died. In the same year, his uncle and guardian, Abu Talib, also died. Despite Muhammad&#x27;s persuasions to Abu Talib to embrace Islam on his deathbed, he clung to his polytheistic beliefs until the end. Muhammad&#x27;s other uncle, Abu Lahab, who succeeded the Banu Hashim clan leadership, was initially willing to provide Muhammad with protection. However, upon hearing from Muhammad that Abu Talib and Abd al-Muttalib were destined for hell due to not believing in Islam, he withdrew his support.

Muhammad then went to Ta&#x27;if to try to establish himself in the city and gain aid and protection against the Meccans, but he was met with a response: &quot;If you are truly a prophet, what need do you have of our help? If God sent you as his messenger, why doesn&#x27;t He protect you? And if Allah wished to send a prophet, couldn&#x27;t He have found a better person than you, a weak and fatherless orphan?&quot; Realizing his efforts were in vain, Muhammad asked the people of Ta&#x27;if to keep the matter a secret, fearing that this would embolden the hostility of the Quraysh against him. However, instead of accepting his request, they pelted him with stones, injuring his limbs. He eventually evaded this chaos and persecution by escaping to the garden of Utbah ibn Rabi&#x27;ah, a Meccan chief with a summer residence in Ta&#x27;if. Muhammad felt despair due to the unexpected rejection and hostility he received in the city; at this point, he realized he had no security or protection except from God, so he began praying. Shortly thereafter, Utbah&#x27;s Christian slave Addas stopped by and offered grapes, which Muhammad accepted. By the end of the encounter, Addas felt overwhelmed and kissed Muhammad&#x27;s head, hands, and feet in recognition of his prophethood.

On Muhammad&#x27;s return journey to Mecca, news of the events in Ta&#x27;if had reached the ears of Abu Jahl, and he said, &quot;They did not allow him to enter Ta&#x27;if, so let us deny him entry to Mecca as well.&quot; Knowing the gravity of the situation, Muhammad asked a passing horseman to deliver a message to Akhnas ibn Shariq, a member of his mother&#x27;s clan, requesting his protection so that he could enter in safety. But Akhnas declined, saying that he was only a confederate of the house of Quraysh. Muhammad then sent a message to Suhayl ibn Amir, who similarly declined on the basis of tribal principle. Finally, Muhammad dispatched someone to ask Mut&#x27;im ibn &#x27;Adiy, the chief of the Banu Nawfal. Mut&#x27;im agreed, and after equipping himself, he rode out in the morning with his sons and nephews to accompany Muhammad to the city. When Abu Jahl saw him, he asked if Mut&#x27;im was simply giving him protection or if he had already converted to his religion. Mut&#x27;im replied, &quot;Granting him protection, of course.&quot; Then Abu Jahl said, &quot;We will protect whomever you protect.&quot;

=== Isra&#x27; and Mi&#x27;raj ===

It is at this low point in Muhammad&#x27;s life that the accounts in the lay out the famous Isra&#x27; and Mi&#x27;raj. Nowadays, Isra&#x27; is believed by Muslims to be the journey of Muhammad from Mecca to Jerusalem, while Mi&#x27;raj is from Jerusalem to the heavens. There is considered no substantial basis for the Mi&#x27;raj in the Quran, as the Quran does not address it directly.

Verse 17:1 of the Quran recounts Muhammad&#x27;s night journey from a revered place of prayer to the most distant place of worship. The Kaaba, holy enclosure in Mecca, is widely accepted as the starting point, but there is disagreement among Islamic traditions as to what constitutes &quot;the farthest place of worship&quot;. Some modern scholars maintain that the earliest tradition saw this faraway site as a celestial twin of the Kaaba, so that Muhammad&#x27;s journey took him directly from Mecca through the heavens. A later tradition, however, refers to it as , which is generally associated with Jerusalem. Over time, these different traditions merged to present the journey as one that began in Mecca, passed through Jerusalem, and then ascended to heaven.

The dating of the events also differs from account to account. Ibn Sa&#x27;d recorded that Muhammad&#x27;s Mi&#x27;raj took place first, from near the Kaaba to the heavens, on the 27th of Ramadan, 18 months before the , while the Isra&#x27; from Mecca to took place on the 17th night of the Last Rabi’ul before the . As is well known, these two stories were later combined into one. In Ibn Hisham&#x27;s account, the Isra&#x27; came first and then the Mi&#x27;raj, and he put these stories before the deaths of Khadija and Abu Talib. In contrast, al-Tabari included only the story of Muhammad&#x27;s ascension from the sanctuary in Mecca to &quot;the earthly heaven&quot;. Tabari placed this story at the beginning of Muhammad&#x27;s public ministry, between his account of Khadija becoming &quot;the first to believe in the Messenger of God&quot; and his account of &quot;the first male to believe in the Messenger of God&quot;.

=== Migration to Medina ===
As resistance to his proselytism in Mecca grew, Muhammad began to limit his efforts to non-Meccans who attended fairs or made pilgrimages. During this period, Muhammad had an encounter with six individuals from the Banu Khazraj. These men had a history of raiding Jews in their locality, who in turn would warn them that a prophet would be sent to punish them. On hearing Muhammad&#x27;s religious message, they said to each other, &quot;This is the very prophet of whom the Jews warned us. Don&#x27;t let them get to him before us!&quot; Upon embracing Islam, they returned to Medina and shared their encounter, hoping that by having their people—the Khazraj and the Aws, who had been at odds for so long—accept Islam and adopt Muhammad as their leader, unity could be achieved between them.

The next year, five of the earlier converts revisited Muhammad, bringing with them seven newcomers, three of whom were from the Banu Aws. At Aqaba, near Mecca, they pledged their loyalty to him. Muhammad then entrusted Mus&#x27;ab ibn Umayr to join them on their return to Medina to promote Islam. Come June 622, a significant clandestine meeting was convened, again at Aqaba. In this gathering, seventy-five individuals from Medina (then Yathrib) attended, including two women, representing all the converts of the oases. Muhammad asked them to protect him as they would protect their wives and children. They concurred and gave him their oath, commonly referred to as the second pledge at al-Aqabah or the pledge of war. Paradise was Muhammad&#x27;s promise to them in exchange for their loyalty.

Subsequently, Muhammad called upon the Meccan Muslims to relocate to Medina. This event is known as the , literally meaning &#x27;severing of kinship ties&#x27;. The departures spanned approximately three months. To avoid arriving in Medina by himself with his followers remaining in Mecca, Muhammad chose not to go ahead and instead stayed back to watch over them and persuade those who were reluctant. Some were held back by their families from leaving, but in the end, there were no Muslims left in Mecca.

Islamic tradition recounts that in light of the unfolding events, Abu Jahl proposed a joint assassination of Muhammad by representatives of each clan. Having been informed about this by the angel Gabriel, Muhammad asked his cousin Ali to lie in his bed covered with his green hadrami mantle, assuring that it would safeguard him. That night, the group of planned assassins approached Muhammad&#x27;s home to carry out the attack but changed their minds upon hearing the voices of Sawdah and some of Muhammad&#x27;s daughters, since it was considered shameful to kill a man in front of the women in his family. They instead chose to wait until Muhammad left the house the next morning; one of the men peeked into a window and saw what he believed to be Muhammad (but was actually Ali dressed in Muhammad&#x27;s cloak), though unbeknownst to them, Muhammad had previously escaped from the back of the residence. When Ali went outside to go for a walk the following morning, the men realized they had been fooled, and the Quraysh consequently offered a 100-camel bounty for the return of Muhammad&#x27;s body, dead or alive. After staying hidden for three days, Muhammad subsequently departed with Abu Bakr for Medina, which at the time was still named Yathrib; the two men arrived in Medina on 4 September 622. The Meccan Muslims who undertook the migration were then called the Muhajirun, while the Medinan Muslims were dubbed the Ansar.

==Medinan years==
===Building the religious community in Medina===
A few days after settling in Medina, Muhammad negotiated for the purchase of a piece of land; upon this plot, the Muslims began constructing a building that would become Muhammad&#x27;s residence as well as a community gathering place () for prayer (). Tree trunks were used as pillars to hold up the roof, and there was no fancy pulpit; instead, Muhammad stood on top of a small stool to speak to the congregation. The structure was completed after about seven months in April 623, becoming the first Muslim building and mosque; its northern wall had a stone marking the direction of prayer () which was Jerusalem at that time. Muhammad used the building to host public and political meetings, as well as a place for the poor to gather to receive alms, food, and care. Christians and Jews were also allowed to participate in community worship at the mosque. Initially, Muhammad&#x27;s religion had no organized way to call the community to prayer in a coordinated manner. To resolve this, Muhammad had considered using a ram&#x27;s horn () like the Jews or a wooden clapper like the Christians, but one of the Muslims in the community had a dream where a man in a green cloak told him that someone with a loud booming voice should announce the service by crying out &quot;allahu akbar&quot; (&#x27;God is greater&#x27;) to remind Muslims of their top priority; when Muhammad heard about this dream, he agreed with the idea and selected Bilal, a former Abyssinian slave known for his loud voice.

===Constitution of Medina===
The Constitution of Medina was a legal covenant written by Muhammad. In the constitution, Medina&#x27;s Arab and Jewish tribes promised to live peacefully alongside the Muslims and to refrain from making a separate treaty with Mecca. It also guaranteed the Jews freedom of religion. In the agreement, everyone under its jurisdiction was required to defend and protect the oasis if attacked. Politically, the agreement helped Muhammad better understand which people were on his side. Ibn Ishaq, following his narration of the , maintains that Muhammad penned the text and divulges its assumed content without supplying any or corroboration. The appellation is generally deemed imprecise, as the text neither established a state nor enacted Quranic statutes, but rather addressed tribal matters. While scholars from both the West and the Muslim world agree on the text&#x27;s authenticity, disagreements persist on whether it was a treaty or a unilateral proclamation by Muhammad, the number of documents it comprised, the primary parties, the specific timing of its creation (or that of its constituent parts), whether it was drafted before or after Muhammad&#x27;s removal of the three leading Jewish tribes of Medina, and the proper approach to translating it.

===Beginning of armed conflict===

Following the emigration, the people of Mecca seized property of Muslim emigrants to Medina. War would later break out between the people of Mecca and the Muslims. Muhammad delivered Quranic verses permitting Muslims to fight the Meccans. According to the traditional account, on 11 February 624, while praying in the Masjid al-Qiblatayn in Medina, Muhammad received revelations from God that he should be facing Mecca rather than Jerusalem during prayer. Muhammad adjusted to the new direction, and his companions praying with him followed his lead, beginning the tradition of facing Mecca during prayer.

Muhammad ordered a number of raids to capture Meccan caravans, but only the 8th of them, the Raid on Nakhla, resulted in actual fighting and capture of booty and prisoners. In March 624, Muhammad led some three hundred warriors in a raid on a Meccan merchant caravan. The Muslims set an ambush for the caravan at Badr. Aware of the plan, the Meccan caravan eluded the Muslims. A Meccan force was sent to protect the caravan and went on to confront the Muslims upon receiving word that the caravan was safe. Due to being outnumbered more than three to one, a spirit of fear ran throughout the Muslim camp; Muhammad tried to boost their morale by telling them he had a dream in which God promised to send 1,000 angels to fight with them. From a tactical standpoint, Muhammad placed troops in front of all of the wells so the Quraysh would have to fight for water, and positioned other troops in such a way that would require the Quraysh to fight uphill while also facing the sun. The Battle of Badr commenced, and the Muslims ultimately won, killing at least forty-five Meccans with fourteen Muslims dead. They also succeeded in killing many Meccan leaders, including Abu Jahl. Seventy prisoners had been acquired, many of whom were ransomed. Muhammad and his followers saw the victory as confirmation of their faith and Muhammad ascribed the victory to the assistance of an invisible host of angels. The Quranic verses of this period, unlike the Meccan verses, dealt with practical problems of government and issues like the distribution of spoils.

The victory strengthened Muhammad&#x27;s position in Medina and dispelled earlier doubts among his followers. As a result, the opposition to him became less vocal. Pagans who had not yet converted were very bitter about the advance of Islam. Two pagans, Asma bint Marwan of the Aws Manat tribe and Abu &#x27;Afak of the &#x27;Amr b. &#x27;Awf tribe, had composed verses taunting and insulting the Muslims. They were killed by people belonging to their own or related clans, and Muhammad did not disapprove of the killings. This report, however, is considered by some to be a fabrication. Most members of those tribes converted to Islam, and little pagan opposition remained.

Muhammad expelled from Medina the Banu Qaynuqa, one of three main Jewish tribes, but some historians contend that the expulsion happened after Muhammad&#x27;s death. According to al-Waqidi, after Abd Allah ibn Ubayy spoke for them, Muhammad refrained from executing them and commanded that they be exiled from Medina. Following the Battle of Badr, Muhammad also made mutual-aid alliances with a number of Bedouin tribes to protect his community from attacks from the northern part of Hejaz.

=== Conflicts with Jewish tribes ===
Once the ransom arrangements for the Meccan captives were finalized, he initiated a siege on the Banu Qaynuqa, regarded as the weakest and wealthiest of Medina&#x27;s three main Jewish tribes. Muslim sources provide different reasons for the siege, including an altercation involving Hamza and Ali in the Banu Qaynuqa market, and another version by Ibn Ishaq, which tells the story of a Muslim woman being pranked by a Qaynuqa goldsmith. Regardless of the cause, the Banu Qaynuqa sought refuge in their fort, where Muhammad blockaded them, cutting off their access to food supplies. The Banu Qaynuqa requested help from their Arab allies, but the Arabs refused since they were supporters of Muhammad. After roughly two weeks, the Banu Qaynuqa capitulated without engaging in combat.

Following the surrender of the Qaynuqa, Muhammad was moving to execute the men of the tribe when Abdullah ibn Ubayy, a Muslim Khazraj chieftain who had been aided by the Qaynuqa in the past encouraged Muhammad to show leniency. In a narrated incident, Muhammad turned away from Ibn Ubayy, but undeterred, the chieftain grasped Muhammad&#x27;s cloak, and refused to let go until Muhammad agreed to treat the tribe leniently. Despite being angered by the incident, Muhammad spared the Qaynuqa, stipulating that they must depart Medina within three days and relinquish their property to the Muslims, with a fifth () being retained by Muhammad.

Back in Medina, Ka&#x27;b ibn al-Ashraf, a wealthy half-Jewish man from Banu Nadir and staunch critic of Muhammad, had just returned from Mecca after producing poetry that mourned the death of the Quraysh at Badr and aroused them to retaliate. When Muhammad learned of this incitement against the Muslims, he asked his followers, &quot;Who is ready to kill Ka&#x27;b, who has hurt God and His apostle?&quot; Ibn Maslamah offered his services, explaining that the task would require deception. Muhammad did not contest this. He then gathered accomplices, including Ka&#x27;b&#x27;s foster brother, Abu Naila. They pretended to complain about their post-conversion hardships, persuading Ka&#x27;b to lend them food. On the night of their meeting with Ka&#x27;b, they murdered him when he was caught off-guard.

===Meccan retaliation===

In 625, the Quraysh, wearied by Muhammad&#x27;s continuous attacks on their caravans, decided to take decisive action. Led by Abu Sufyan, they assembled an army to oppose Muhammad. Upon being alerted by his scout about the impending threat, Muhammad convened a war council. Initially, he considered defending from the city center, but later decided to meet the enemy in open battle at Mount Uhud, following the insistence of the younger faction of his followers. As they prepared to depart, the remaining Jewish allies of Abdullah ibn Ubayy offered their help, which Muhammad declined. Despite being outnumbered, the Muslims initially held their ground but lost advantage when some archers disobeyed orders. As rumors of Muhammad&#x27;s death spread, the Muslims started to flee, but he had only been injured and managed to escape with a group of loyal adherents. Satisfied they had restored their honor, the Meccans returned to Mecca. Mass casualties suffered by the Muslims in the Battle of Uhud resulted in many wives and daughters being left without a male protector, so after the battle, Muhammad received revelation allowing Muslim men to have up to four wives each, marking the beginning of polygyny in Islam.

Sometime later, Muhammad found himself needing to pay blood money to Banu Amir. He sought monetary help from the Jewish tribe of Banu Nadir, and they agreed to his request. However, while waiting, he departed from his companions and disappeared. When they found him at his home, according to Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad disclosed that he had received a divine revelation of a planned assassination attempt on him by the Banu Nadir, which involved dropping a boulder from a rooftop. Muhammad then initiated a siege on the tribe; during this time he also commanded the felling and burning of their palm groves, which was an unambiguous symbol of declaring war in Arabia. After a fortnight or so, the Banu Nadir capitulated. They were directed to vacate their land and permitted to carry only one camel-load of goods for every three people. From the spoils, Muhammad claimed a fertile piece of land where barley sprouted amongst palm trees.

=== Raid on the Banu Mustaliq ===
Upon receiving a report that the Banu Mustaliq were planning an attack on Medina, Muhammad&#x27;s troops executed a surprise attack on them at their watering place, causing them to flee rapidly. In the confrontation, the Muslims lost one man, while the enemy suffered ten casualties. As part of their triumph, the Muslims seized 2,000 camels, 500 sheep and goats, and 200 women from the tribe. The Muslim soldiers desired the captive women, but they also sought ransom money. They asked Muhammad about using to prevent pregnancy, to which Muhammad replied, &quot;You are not under any obligation to forbear from that...&quot; Later, envoys arrived in Medina to negotiate the ransom for the women and children. Despite having the choice, all of them chose to return to their country instead of staying.

===Battle of the Trench===

With the help of the exiled Banu Nadir, the Quraysh military leader Abu Sufyan mustered a force of 10,000 men. Muhammad prepared a force of about 3,000 men and adopted a form of defense unknown in Arabia at that time; the Muslims dug a trench wherever Medina lay open to cavalry attack. The idea is credited to a Persian convert to Islam, Salman the Persian. The siege of Medina began on 31 March 627 and lasted two weeks. Abu Sufyan&#x27;s troops were unprepared for the fortifications, and after an ineffectual siege, the coalition decided to return home. The Quran discusses this battle in sura Al-Ahzab, in verses 33:9–27.
During the battle, the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza, located to the south of Medina, entered into negotiations with Meccan forces to revolt against Muhammad. Although the Meccan forces were swayed by suggestions that Muhammad was sure to be overwhelmed, they desired reassurance in case the confederacy was unable to destroy him. No agreement was reached after prolonged negotiations, partly due to sabotage attempts by Muhammad&#x27;s scouts. After the coalition&#x27;s retreat, the Muslims accused the Banu Qurayza of treachery and besieged them in their forts for 25 days. The Banu Qurayza eventually surrendered; according to Ibn Ishaq, all the men apart from a few converts to Islam were beheaded, while the women and children were enslaved. Walid N. Arafat and Barakat Ahmad have disputed the accuracy of Ibn Ishaq&#x27;s narrative. Arafat believes that Ibn Ishaq&#x27;s Jewish sources, speaking over 100 years after the event, conflated this account with memories of earlier massacres in Jewish history; he notes that Ibn Ishaq was considered an unreliable historian by his contemporary Malik ibn Anas, and a transmitter of &quot;odd tales&quot; by the later Ibn Hajar. Ahmad argues that only some of the tribe were killed, while some of the fighters were merely enslaved. Watt finds Arafat&#x27;s arguments &quot;not entirely convincing&quot;, while Meir J. Kister has refuted the arguments of Arafat and Ahmad.

In the siege of Medina, the Meccans exerted the available strength to destroy the Muslim community. The failure resulted in a significant loss of prestige; their trade with Syria vanished. Following the Battle of the Trench, Muhammad made two expeditions to the north, both ended without any fighting. While returning from one of these journeys (or some years earlier according to other early accounts), an accusation of adultery was made against Aisha, Muhammad&#x27;s wife. Aisha was exonerated from accusations when Muhammad announced he had received a revelation confirming Aisha&#x27;s innocence and directing that charges of adultery be supported by four eyewitnesses (sura 24, An-Nur).

=== Invasion of the Banu Qurayza ===

On the day the Quraysh forces and their allies withdrew, Muhammad, while bathing at his wife&#x27;s abode, received a visit from the angel Gabriel, who instructed him to attack the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza. Islamic sources recount that during the preceding Meccan siege, the Quraysh leader Abu Sufyan incited the Qurayza to attack the Muslims from their compound, but the Qurayza demanded the Quraysh to provide 70 hostages from among themselves to ascertain their commitment to their plans, as proposed by Muhammad&#x27;s secret agent Nuaym ibn Masud. Abu Sufyan refused their requirement. Nevertheless, later accounts claim that 11 Jewish individuals from the Qurayza were indeed agitated and acted against Muhammad, though the course of event may have been dramatized within the tradition.

Citing the intrigue of the Qurayza, Muhammad besieged the tribe, though the tribe denied the charges. However, there are sources that say the Banu Qurayza broke the treaty with Muhammad and assisted the enemies of Muslims during the Battle of the Trench. As the situation turned against the Qurayza, the tribe proposed to leave their land with one loaded camel each, but Muhammad refused. They then offered to leave without taking anything, but this was rejected as well, with Muhammad insisting on their unconditional surrender. The Qurayza subsequently requested to confer with one of their Aws allies who had embraced Islam, leading to the arrival of Abu Lubaba. When asked about Muhammad&#x27;s intentions, he gestured towards his throat, indicating an imminent massacre. He immediately regretted his indiscretion and tied himself to one of the Mosque pillars as a form of penance.

After a 25-day siege, the Banu Qurayza surrendered. The Muslims of Banu Aws entreated Muhammad for leniency, prompting him to suggest that one of their own should serve as the judge, which they accepted. Muhammad assigned the role to Sa&#x27;d ibn Mu&#x27;adh, a man nearing death from an infection in his wounds from the previous Meccan siege. He pronounced that all the men should be put to death, their possessions to be distributed among Muslims, and their women and children to be taken as captives. Muhammad approved this pronouncement saying it aligned with the God&#x27;s judgement. Consequently, 600–900 men of Banu Qurayza were executed. The women and children were distributed as slaves, with some being transported to Najd to be sold. The proceeds were then utilized to purchase weapons and horses for the Muslims.

=== Incidents with the Banu Fazara ===
A few months after the conflict with the Banu Qurayza, Muhammad organized a caravan to conduct trade in Syria. Zayd ibn Haritha was tasked with guarding the convoy. When they journeyed through the territory of Banu Fazara, whom Zayd had raided in the past, the tribe seized the opportunity for revenge, attacking the caravan and injuring him. Upon his return to Medina, Muhammad ordered Zayd to lead a punitive operation against the Fazara in which their matriarch Umm Qirfa was captured and brutally executed.

=== Treaty of Hudaybiyya ===
Early in 628, following a dream of making an unopposed pilgrimage to Mecca, Muhammad embarked on the journey. He was dressed in his customary pilgrim attire and was accompanied by a group of followers. Upon reaching Hudaybiyya, they encountered Quraysh emissaries who questioned their intentions. Muhammad explained they had come to venerate the Kaaba, not to fight. He then sent Uthman, Abu Sufyan&#x27;s second cousin, to negotiate with the Quraysh. As the negotiations were prolonged, rumors of Uthman&#x27;s death began to spark, prompting Muhammad to call his followers to renew their oaths of loyalty. Uthman returned with news of a negotiation impasse. Muhammad remained persistent. In the end, the Quraysh sent Suhayl ibn Amr, an envoy with full negotiation powers. Following lengthy discussions, a treaty was finally enacted, with terms:

# A ten-year truce was established between both parties.
# If a Qurayshite came to Muhammad&#x27;s side without his guardian&#x27;s allowance, he was to be returned to the Quraysh; yet, if a Muslim came to the Quraysh, he would not be surrendered to Muhammad.
# Any tribes interested in forming alliances with Muhammad or the Quraysh were free to do so. These alliances were also protected by the ten-year truce.
# Muslims were then required to depart back to Medina, however, they were permitted to make the Umrah pilgrimage in the coming year.

=== Invasion of Khaybar ===

Roughly ten weeks subsequent to his return from Hudaybiyya, Muhammad expressed his plan to invade Khaybar, a flourishing oasis about north of Medina. The city was populated by Jews, including those from the Banu Nadir, who had previously been expelled by Muhammad from Medina. With the prospect of rich spoils from the mission, numerous volunteers answered his call. To keep their movements hidden, the Muslim military chose to march during the nighttime. As dawn arrived and the city folks stepped out of their fortifications to harvest their dates, they were taken aback by the sight of the advancing Muslim forces. Muhammad cried out, &quot;Allahu Akbar! Khaybar is destroyed. For when we approach a people&#x27;s land, a terrible morning awaits the warned ones.&quot; After a strenuous battle lasting more than a month, the Muslims successfully captured the city.

The spoils, inclusive of the wives of the slain warriors, were distributed among the Muslims. The chief of the Jews, Kenana ibn al-Rabi, to whom the treasure of Banu al-Nadir was entrusted, denied knowing its whereabouts. After a Jew disclosed his habitual presence around a particular ruin, Muhammad ordered excavations, and the treasure was found. When questioned about the remaining wealth, Kenana refused to divulge it. Kinana was then put through torture by Muhammad&#x27;s decree and subsequently beheaded by Muhammad ibn Maslamah in revenge for his brother. Muhammad took Kinana&#x27;s wife, Safiyya bint Huyayy, as his own slave and later advised her to convert to Islam. She accepted and agreed to become Muhammad&#x27;s wife.

Following their defeat by the Muslims, some of the Jews proposed to Muhammad that they stay and serve as tenant farmers, given the Muslims&#x27; lack of expertise and labor force for date palm cultivation. They agreed to give half of the annual produce to the Muslims. Muhammad consented to this arrangement with the caveat that he could displace them at any time. While they were allowed to farm, he demanded the surrender of all gold or silver, executing those who secreted away their wealth. Taking a cue from what transpired in Khaybar, the Jews in Fadak immediately sent an envoy to Muhammad and agreed to the same terms of relinquishing 50% of their annual harvest. However, since no combat occurred, the rank and file had no claim to a portion of the spoils. Consequently, all the loot became Muhammad&#x27;s exclusive wealth.

At the feast following the battle, the meal served to Muhammad was reportedly poisoned. His companion, Bishr, fell dead after consuming it, while Muhammad himself managed to vomit it out after tasting it. The perpetrator was Zaynab bint al-Harith, a Jewish woman whose father, uncle, and husband had been killed by the Muslims. When asked why she did it, she replied, &quot;You know what you&#x27;ve done to my people... I said to myself: If he is truly a prophet, he will know about the poison. If he&#x27;s merely a king, I&#x27;ll be rid of him.&quot; Muhammad suffered illness for a period due to the poison he ingested, and he endured sporadic pain from it until his death.

==Final years==

===Conquest of Mecca===


The truce of Hudaybiyyah was enforced for two years. The tribe of Banu Khuza&#x27;ah had good relations with Muhammad, whereas their enemies, the Banu Bakr, had allied with the Meccans. A clan of the Bakr made a night raid against the Khuza&#x27;ah, killing a few of them. The Meccans helped the Banu Bakr with weapons and, according to some sources, a few Meccans also took part in the fighting. After this event, Muhammad sent a message to Mecca with three conditions, asking them to accept one of them. These were: either the Meccans would pay blood money for the slain among the Khuza&#x27;ah tribe, they disavow themselves of the Banu Bakr, or they should declare the truce of Hudaybiyyah null.

The Meccans replied that they accepted the last condition. Soon they realized their mistake and sent Abu Sufyan to renew the Hudaybiyyah treaty, a request that was declined by Muhammad.

Muhammad began to prepare for a campaign. In 630, Muhammad marched on Mecca with 10,000 Muslim converts. With minimal casualties, Muhammad seized control of Mecca. He declared an amnesty for past offences, except for ten men and women who were &quot;guilty of murder or other offences or had sparked off the war and disrupted the peace&quot;. Some of these were later pardoned Most Meccans converted to Islam and Muhammad proceeded to destroy all the statues of Arabian gods in and around the Kaaba. According to reports collected by Ibn Ishaq and al-Azraqi, Muhammad personally spared paintings or frescos of Mary and Jesus, but other traditions suggest that all pictures were erased. The Quran discusses the conquest of Mecca.

=== Subduing the Hawazin and Thaqif and the expedition to Tabuk ===

Upon learning that Mecca had fallen to the Muslims, the Banu Hawazin gathered their entire tribe, including their families, to fight. They are estimated to have around 4,000 warriors. Muhammad led 12,000 soldiers to raid them, but they surprised him at the valley of Hunayn. The Muslims overpowered them and took their women, children and animals. Muhammad then turned his attention to Taif, a city that was famous for its vineyards and gardens. He ordered them to be destroyed and besieged the city, which was surrounded by walls. After 15–20 days of failing to breach their defenses, he abandoned the attempts.

When he divided the plentiful loot acquired at Hunayn among his soldiers, the rest of the Hawazin converted to Islam and implored Muhammad to release their children and women, reminding him that he had been nursed by some of those women when he was a baby. He complied but held on to the rest of the plunder. Some of his men opposed giving away their portions, so he compensated them with six camels each from subsequent raids. Muhammad distributed a big portion of the booty to the new converts from the Quraysh. Abu Sufyan and two of his sons, Mu&#x27;awiya and Yazid, got 100 camels individually. The Ansar, who had fought bravely in the battle, but received close to nothing, were unhappy with this. One of them remarked, &quot;It is not with such gifts that one seeks God&#x27;s face.&quot; Disturbed by this utterance, Muhammad retorted, &quot;He changed color.&quot;

Roughly 10 months after he captured Mecca, Muhammad took his army to attack the wealthy border provinces of Byzantine Syria. Several motives are proposed, including avenging the defeat at Mu&#x27;tah and earning vast booty. Because of the drought and severe heat at that time, some of the Muslims refrained from participating. This led to the revelation of Quran 9:38 which rebuked those slackers. When Muhammad and his army reached Tabuk, there were no hostile forces present. However, he was able to force some of the local chiefs to accept his rule and pay . A group under Khalid ibn Walid that he sent for a raid also managed to acquire some booty including 2,000 camels and 800 cattle.

The Hawazin&#x27;s acceptance of Islam resulted in Taif losing its last major ally. After enduring a year of unrelenting thefts and terror attacks from the Muslims following the siege, the people of Taif, known as the Banu Thaqif, finally reached a tipping point and acknowledged that embracing Islam was the most sensible path for them.

===Farewell pilgrimage===

On February 631, Muhammad received a revelation granting idolaters four months of grace, after which the Muslims would attack, kill, and plunder them wherever they met.

During the 632 pilgrimage season, Muhammad personally led the ceremonies and gave a sermon. Among the key points highlighted are said to have been the prohibition of usury and vendettas related to past murders from the pre-Islamic era; the brotherhood of all Muslims; and the adoption of twelve lunar months without intercalation.

==Death==
After praying at the burial site in June 632, Muhammad suffered a dreadful headache that made him cry in pain. He continued to spend the night with each of his wives one by one, but he fainted in Maymunah&#x27;s hut. He requested his wives to allow him to stay in Aisha&#x27;s hut. He could not walk there without leaning on Ali and Fadl ibn Abbas, as his legs were trembling. His wives and his uncle al-Abbas fed him an Abyssinian remedy when he was unconscious. When he came to, he inquired about it, and they explained they were afraid he had pleurisy. He replied that God would not afflict him with such a vile disease, and ordered all the women to also take the remedy. According to various sources, including , Muhammad said that he felt his aorta being severed because of the food he ate at Khaybar. On 8 June 632, Muhammad died. In his last moments, he reportedly uttered:

Historian Alfred T. Welch speculates that Muhammad&#x27;s death was caused by Medinan fever, which was aggravated by physical and mental fatigue.

==Tomb==

Muhammad was buried where he died in Aisha&#x27;s house. During the reign of the Umayyad caliph al-Walid I, the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque was expanded to include the site of Muhammad&#x27;s tomb. The Green Dome above the tomb was built by the Mamluk sultan Al Mansur Qalawun in the 13th century, although the green color was added in the 16th century, under the reign of Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. Among tombs adjacent to that of Muhammad are those of his companions (), the first two Muslim caliphs Abu Bakr and Umar, and an empty one that Muslims believe awaits Jesus.

When Saud bin Abdul-Aziz took Medina in 1805, Muhammad&#x27;s tomb was stripped of its gold and jewel ornamentation. Adherents to Wahhabism, Saud&#x27;s followers, destroyed nearly every tomb dome in Medina in order to prevent their veneration, and the one of Muhammad is reported to have narrowly escaped. Similar events took place in 1925, when the Saudi militias retook—and this time managed to keep—the city. In the Wahhabi interpretation of Islam, burial is to take place in unmarked graves. Although the practice is frowned upon by the Saudis, many pilgrims continue to practice a —a ritual visit—to the tomb.

==Succession==

With Muhammad&#x27;s death, disagreement broke out over who his successor would be. Umar ibn al-Khattab, a prominent companion of Muhammad, nominated Abu Bakr, Muhammad&#x27;s friend and collaborator. With additional support, Abu Bakr was confirmed as the first caliph. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad&#x27;s companions, who held that Ali ibn Abi Talib, his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated the successor by Muhammad at Ghadir Khumm. Abu Bakr immediately moved to strike against the forces of the Byzantine Empire because of the previous defeat, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an event that Muslim historians later referred to as the Ridda wars, or &quot;Wars of Apostasy&quot;.

The pre-Islamic Middle East was dominated by the Byzantine and Sasanian empires. The Roman–Persian Wars between the two had devastated the region, making the empires unpopular amongst local tribes. Furthermore, in the lands that would be conquered by Muslims, many Christians (Nestorians, Monophysites, Jacobites and Copts) were disaffected from the Eastern Orthodox Church which deemed them heretics. Within a decade Muslims conquered Mesopotamia, Byzantine Syria, Byzantine Egypt, large parts of Persia, and established the Rashidun Caliphate.

==Household==

Muhammad&#x27;s life is traditionally defined into two periods: pre-hijra in Mecca (570–622), and post-hijra in Medina (622–632). Muhammad is said to have had thirteen wives in total (although two have ambiguous accounts, Rayhana bint Zayd and Maria al-Qibtiyya, as wife or concubine).

At the age of 25, Muhammad married the wealthy Khadija who was 40 years old. The marriage lasted for 25 years and was a happy one. Muhammad did not enter into marriage with another woman during this marriage. After Khadija&#x27;s death, Khawla bint Hakim suggested to Muhammad that he should marry Sawdah bint Zam&#x27;ah, a Muslim widow, or Aisha, daughter of Umm Ruman and Abu Bakr of Mecca. Muhammad is said to have asked for arrangements to marry both. According to classical sources, Muhammad married Aisha when she was 6–7 years old; the marriage was consummated later, when she was 9 years old and he was 53 years old.

Muhammad performed household chores such as preparing food, sewing clothes, and repairing shoes. He is also said to have had accustomed his wives to dialogue; he listened to their advice, and the wives debated and even argued with him.

Khadija is said to have had four daughters with Muhammad (Ruqayya bint Muhammad, Umm Kulthum bint Muhammad, Zainab bint Muhammad, Fatimah Zahra) and two sons (Abd Allah ibn Muhammad and Qasim ibn Muhammad, who both died in childhood). All but one of his daughters, Fatimah, died before him. Some Shia scholars contend that Fatimah was Muhammad&#x27;s only daughter. Maria al-Qibtiyya bore him a son named Ibrahim ibn Muhammad, who died at two years old.

Nine of Muhammad&#x27;s wives survived him. Aisha, who became known as Muhammad&#x27;s favorite wife in Sunni tradition, survived him by decades and was instrumental in helping assemble the scattered sayings of Muhammad that form the hadith literature for the Sunni branch of Islam.

Zayd ibn Haritha was a slave that Khadija gave to Muhammad. He was bought by her nephew Hakim ibn Hizam at the market in Ukaz. Zayd then became the couple&#x27;s adopted son, but was later disowned when Muhammad was about to marry Zayd&#x27;s ex-wife, Zaynab bint Jahsh. According to a BBC summary, &quot;the Prophet Muhammad did not try to abolish slavery, and bought, sold, captured, and owned slaves himself. But he insisted that slave owners treat their slaves well and stressed the virtue of freeing slaves. Muhammad treated slaves as human beings and clearly held some in the highest esteem&quot;.

==Legacy==

===Islamic tradition===
Following the attestation to the oneness of God, the belief in Muhammad&#x27;s prophethood is the main aspect of the Islamic faith. Every Muslim proclaims in the : &quot;I testify that there is no god but God, and I testify that Muhammad is a Messenger of God&quot;. The is the basic creed or tenet of Islam. Islamic belief is that ideally the is the first words a newborn will hear; children are taught it immediately and it will be recited upon death. Muslims repeat the shahadah in the call to prayer () and the prayer itself. Non-Muslims wishing to convert to Islam are required to recite the creed.

In Islamic belief, Muhammad is regarded as the last prophet sent by God. Writings such as hadith and attribute several miracles or supernatural events to Muhammad. One of these is the splitting of the Moon, which according to earliest available compilations is a literal splitting of the Moon.

The sunnah represents the actions and sayings of Muhammad preserved in hadith and covers a broad array of activities and beliefs ranging from religious rituals, personal hygiene, and burial of the dead to the mystical questions involving the love between humans and God. The sunnah is considered a model of emulation for pious Muslims and has to a great degree influenced the Muslim culture. Many details of major Islamic rituals such as daily prayers, the fasting and the annual pilgrimage are only found in the sunnah and not the Quran.

Muslims have traditionally expressed love and veneration for Muhammad. Stories of Muhammad&#x27;s life, his intercession and of his miracles have permeated popular Muslim thought and poetry (). Among Arabic odes to Muhammad, (&quot;Poem of the Mantle&quot;) by the Egyptian Sufi al-Busiri (1211–1294) is particularly well-known, and widely held to possess a healing, spiritual power. The Quran refers to Muhammad as &quot;a mercy () to the worlds&quot;. The association of rain with mercy in Oriental countries has led to imagining Muhammad as a rain cloud dispensing blessings and stretching over lands, reviving the dead hearts, just as rain revives the seemingly dead earth. Muhammad&#x27;s birthday is celebrated as a major feast throughout the Muslim world, excluding Wahhabi-dominated Saudi Arabia where these public celebrations are discouraged. When Muslims say or write the name of Muhammad, they usually follow it with the Arabic phrase (&quot;may God honor him and grant him peace&quot;) or the English phrase &quot;peace be upon him&quot;. In casual writing, the abbreviations SAW (for the Arabic phrase) or PBUH (for the English phrase) are sometimes used; in printed matter, a small calligraphic rendition is commonly used ().

==== Appearance and depictions====

Various sources present a probable description of Muhammad in the prime of his life. He was slightly above average in height, with a sturdy frame and wide chest. His neck was long, bearing a large head with a broad forehead. His eyes were described as dark and intense, accentuated by long, dark eyelashes. His hair, black and not entirely curly, hung over his ears. His long, dense beard stood out against his neatly trimmed mustache. His nose was long and aquiline, ending in a fine point. His teeth were well-spaced. His face was described as intelligent, and his clear skin had a line of hair from his neck to his navel. Despite a slight stoop, his stride was brisk and purposeful. Muhammad&#x27;s lip and cheek were ripped by a slingstone during the Battle of Uhud. The wound was later cauterized, leaving a scar on his face.

However, since the hadith prohibits the creation of images of sentient living beings, Islamic religious art mainly focuses on the word. Muslims generally avoid depictions of Muhammad, and instead decorate mosques with calligraphy, Quranic inscriptions, or geometrical designs. Today, the interdiction against images of Muhammad—designed to prevent worship of Muhammad, rather than God—is much more strictly observed in Sunni Islam (85–90% of Muslims) and Ahmadiyya Islam (1%) than among Shias (10–15%). While both Sunnis and Shias have created images of Muhammad in the past, Islamic depictions of Muhammad are rare. They have mostly been limited to the private and elite medium of the miniature, and since about 1500 most depictions show Muhammad with his face veiled, or symbolically represent him as a flame.

The earliest extant depictions come from 13th century Anatolian Seljuk and Ilkhanid Persian miniatures, typically in literary genres describing the life and deeds of Muhammad. During the Ilkhanid period, when Persia&#x27;s Mongol rulers converted to Islam, competing Sunni and Shia groups used visual imagery, including images of Muhammad, to promote their particular interpretation of Islam&#x27;s key events. Influenced by the Buddhist tradition of representational religious art predating the Mongol elite&#x27;s conversion, this innovation was unprecedented in the Islamic world, and accompanied by a &quot;broader shift in Islamic artistic culture away from abstraction toward representation&quot; in &quot;mosques, on tapestries, silks, ceramics, and in glass and metalwork&quot; besides books. In the Persian lands, this tradition of realistic depictions lasted through the Timurid dynasty until the Safavids took power in the early 16th century. The Safavaids, who made Shia Islam the state religion, initiated a departure from the traditional Ilkhanid and Timurid artistic style by covering Muhammad&#x27;s face with a veil to obscure his features and at the same time represent his luminous essence. Concomitantly, some of the unveiled images from earlier periods were defaced. Later images were produced in Ottoman Turkey and elsewhere, but mosques were never decorated with images of Muhammad. Illustrated accounts of the night journey () were particularly popular from the Ilkhanid period through the Safavid era. During the 19th century, Iran saw a boom of printed and illustrated books, with Muhammad&#x27;s face veiled, aimed in particular at illiterates and children in the manner of graphic novels. Reproduced through lithography, these were essentially &quot;printed manuscripts&quot;. Today, millions of historical reproductions and modern images are available in some Muslim-majority countries, especially Turkey and Iran, on posters, postcards, and even in coffee-table books, but are unknown in most other parts of the Islamic world, and when encountered by Muslims from other countries, they can cause considerable consternation and offense.

=== Islamic social reforms ===
According to W. Montgomery Watt, religion for Muhammad was not a private and individual matter but &quot;the total response of his personality to the total situation in which he found himself. He was responding [not only]... to the religious and intellectual aspects of the situation but also to the economic, social, and political pressures to which contemporary Mecca was subject.&quot; Bernard Lewis says there are two important political traditions in Islam—Muhammad as a statesman in Medina, and Muhammad as a rebel in Mecca. In his view, Islam is a great change, akin to a revolution, when introduced to new societies.

Historians generally agree that Islamic social changes in areas such as social security, family structure, slavery and the rights of women and children improved on the status quo of Arab society. For example, according to Lewis, Islam &quot;from the first denounced aristocratic privilege, rejected hierarchy, and adopted a formula of the career open to the talents&quot;. Muhammad&#x27;s message transformed society and moral orders of life in the Arabian Peninsula; society focused on the changes to perceived identity, worldview, and the hierarchy of values.
Economic reforms addressed the plight of the poor, which was becoming an issue in pre-Islamic Mecca. The Quran requires payment of an alms tax () for the benefit of the poor; as Muhammad&#x27;s power grew he demanded that tribes who wished to ally with him implement the zakat in particular.

===European appreciation===


Guillaume Postel was among the first to present a more positive view of Muhammad when he argued that Muhammad should be esteemed by Christians as a valid prophet. Gottfried Leibniz praised Muhammad because &quot;he did not deviate from the natural religion&quot;. Henri de Boulainvilliers, in his which was published posthumously in 1730, described Muhammad as a gifted political leader and a just lawmaker. He presents him as a divinely inspired messenger whom God employed to confound the bickering Oriental Christians, to liberate the Orient from the despotic rule of the Romans and Persians, and to spread the knowledge of the unity of God from India to Spain. Voltaire had a mixed opinion on Muhammad: in his play he vilifies Muhammad as a symbol of fanaticism, and in an essay in 1748 he calls him &quot;a sublime and hearty charlatan&quot;. But in Voltaire&#x27;s historical survey , he presents Mohammed as a legislator and conqueror and calls him an &quot;enthusiast&quot;. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in his &quot;Social Contract&quot; (1762), &quot;brushing aside hostile legends of Muhammad as a trickster and impostor, presents him as a sage legislator who wisely fused religious and political powers&quot;. In Emmanuel Pastoret&#x27;s 1787 &quot;Zoroaster, Confucius and Muhammad&quot;, he presents the lives of these three &quot;great men&quot;, &quot;the greatest legislators of the universe&quot;, and compares their careers as religious reformers and lawgivers. Pastoret rejects the common view that Muhammad is an impostor and argues that the Quran proffers &quot;the most sublime truths of cult and morals&quot;; it defines the unity of God with an &quot;admirable concision&quot;. Pastoret writes that the common accusations of his immorality are unfounded: on the contrary, his law enjoins sobriety, generosity, and compassion on his followers: the &quot;legislator of Arabia&quot; was &quot;a great man&quot;. Napoleon Bonaparte admired Muhammad and Islam, and described him as a model lawmaker and conqueror. Thomas Carlyle in his book &quot;On Heroes, Hero-Worship, &amp; the Heroic in History&quot; 1841 describes &quot;Mahomet&quot; as &quot;A silent great soul; he was one of those who cannot but be in earnest&quot;. Carlyle&#x27;s interpretation has been widely cited by Muslim scholars as a demonstration that Western scholarship validates Muhammad&#x27;s status as a great man in history.

Ian Almond says that German Romantic writers generally held positive views of Muhammad: &quot;Goethe&#x27;s &#x27;extraordinary&#x27; poet-prophet, Herder&#x27;s nation builder (...) Schlegel&#x27;s admiration for Islam as an aesthetic product, enviably authentic, radiantly holistic, played such a central role in his view of Mohammed as an exemplary world-fashioner that he even used it as a scale of judgement for the classical (the dithyramb, we are told, has to radiate pure beauty if it is to resemble &#x27;a Koran of poetry&#x27;)&quot;. After quoting Heinrich Heine, who said in a letter to some friend that &quot;I must admit that you, the great prophet of Mecca, are the greatest poet and that your Quran... will not easily escape my memory&quot;, John Tolan goes on to show how Jews in Europe in particular held more nuanced views about Muhammad and Islam, being an ethnoreligious minority feeling discriminated, they specifically lauded Al-Andalus, and thus, &quot;writing about Islam was for Jews a way of indulging in a fantasy world, far from the persecution and pogroms of nineteenth-century Europe, where Jews could live in harmony with their non-Jewish neighbors&quot;.

Recent writers such as William Montgomery Watt and Richard Bell dismiss the idea that Muhammad deliberately deceived his followers, arguing that Muhammad &quot;was absolutely sincere and acted in complete good faith&quot; and Muhammad&#x27;s readiness to endure hardship for his cause, with what seemed to be no rational basis for hope, shows his sincerity. Watt, however, says that sincerity does not directly imply correctness: in contemporary terms, Muhammad might have mistaken his subconscious for divine revelation. Watt and Bernard Lewis argue that viewing Muhammad as a self-seeking impostor makes it impossible to understand Islam&#x27;s development. Alford T. Welch holds that Muhammad was able to be so influential and successful because of his firm belief in his vocation.

===Criticism===
Criticism of Muhammad has existed since the 7th century, when Muhammad was decried by his non-Muslim Arab contemporaries for preaching monotheism, and by the Jewish tribes of Arabia for his perceived appropriation of Biblical narratives and figures and proclamation of himself as the &quot;Seal of the Prophets&quot;. In the Middle Ages, Western and Byzantine Christians labeled him a false prophet, the Antichrist, or portrayed him as a heretic. Contemporary criticism involves questioning Muhammad&#x27;s legitimacy as a prophet, his moral conduct, marriages, ownership of slaves, treatment of enemies, approach to doctrinal matters, and psychological well-being.

===Sufism===
The sunnah contributed much to the development of Islamic law, particularly from the end of the first Islamic century. Muslim mystics, known as Sufis, who were seeking for the inner meaning of the Quran and the inner nature of Muhammad, viewed the prophet of Islam not only as a prophet but also as a perfect human being. All Sufi orders trace their chain of spiritual descent back to Muhammad.

===Other religions===

Followers of the Baháʼí Faith venerate Muhammad as one of a number of prophets or &quot;Manifestations of God&quot;. He is thought to be the final manifestation, or seal of the Adamic cycle, but consider his teachings to have been superseded by those of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí faith, and the first manifestation of the current cycle.

Druze tradition honors several &quot;mentors&quot; and &quot;prophets&quot;, and Muhammad is considered an important prophet of God in the Druze faith, being among the seven prophets who appeared in different periods of history.

<text>Morse code is a telecommunications method which encodes text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called &quot;dots&quot; and &quot;dashes&quot;, or &quot;dits&quot; and &quot;dahs&quot;. Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, one of the early developers of the system adopted for electrical telegraphy.

International Morse code encodes the 26 basic Latin letters &#x27; to &#x27;, one accented Latin letter (), the Arabic numerals, and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals (prosigns). There is no distinction between upper and lower case letters. Each Morse code symbol is formed by a sequence of &quot;dits&quot; and &quot;dahs&quot;. The &quot;dit&quot; duration can vary for signal clarity and operator skill, but for any one message, once established it is the basic unit of time measurement in Morse code. The duration of a &quot;dah&quot; is three times the duration of a &quot;dit&quot; (although some telegraphers deliberately exaggerate the length of a &quot;dah&quot; for clearer signalling). Each &quot;dit&quot; or &quot;dah&quot; within an encoded character is followed by a period of signal absence, called a &quot;space&quot;, equal to the &quot;dit&quot; duration. The letters of a word are separated by a space of duration equal to three &quot;dits&quot;, and words are separated by a space equal to seven &quot;dits&quot;.

Morse code can be memorized and sent in a form perceptible to the human senses, e.g. via sound waves or visible light, such that it can be directly interpreted by persons trained in the skill. Morse code is usually transmitted by on-off keying of an information-carrying medium such as electric current, radio waves, visible light, or sound waves. The current or wave is present during the time period of the &quot;dit&quot; or &quot;dah&quot; and absent during the time between &quot;dits&quot; and &quot;dahs&quot;.

Since many natural languages use more than the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet, Morse alphabets have been developed for those languages, largely by transliteration of existing codes.

To increase the efficiency of transmission, Morse code was originally designed so that the duration of each symbol is approximately inverse to the frequency of occurrence of the character that it represents in text of the English language. Thus the most common letter in English, the letter , has the shortest code – a single &quot;dit&quot;. Because the Morse code elements are specified by proportion rather than specific time durations, the code is usually transmitted at the highest rate that the receiver is capable of decoding. Morse code transmission rate (&quot;speed&quot;) is specified in &quot;groups per minute&quot;, commonly referred to as &quot;words per minute&quot;.

==Development and history==
===Pre-Morse telegraphs and codes===

Early in the nineteenth century, European experimenters made progress with electrical signaling systems, using a variety of techniques including static electricity and electricity from Voltaic piles producing electrochemical and electromagnetic changes. These experimental designs were precursors to practical telegraphic applications.

Following the discovery of electromagnetism by Hans Christian Ørsted in 1820 and the invention of the electromagnet by William Sturgeon in 1824, there were developments in electromagnetic telegraphy in Europe and America. Pulses of electric current were sent along wires to control an electromagnet in the receiving instrument. Many of the earliest telegraph systems used a single-needle system which gave a very simple and robust instrument. However, it was slow, as the receiving operator had to alternate between looking at the needle and writing down the message. In Morse code, a deflection of the needle to the left corresponded to a &quot;dit&quot; and a deflection to the right to a &quot;dah&quot;. The needle clicked each time it moved to the right or left. By making the two clicks sound different (by installing one ivory and one metal stop), transmissions on the single needle device became audible as well as visible, which led in turn to the &quot;Double Plate Sounder&quot; System.

William Cooke and Charles Wheatstone in Britain developed an electrical telegraph that used electromagnets in its receivers. They obtained an English patent in June 1837 and demonstrated it on the London and Birmingham Railway, making it the first commercial telegraph. Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Eduard Weber (1833) as well as Carl August von Steinheil (1837) used codes with varying word lengths for their telegraph systems. In 1841, Cooke and Wheatstone built a telegraph that printed the letters from a wheel of typefaces struck by a hammer.

===Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail===

The American artist Samuel Morse, the American physicist Joseph Henry, and mechanical engineer Alfred Vail developed an electrical telegraph system. The simple &quot;on or off&quot; nature of its signals made it desirable to find a method of transmitting natural language using only electrical pulses and the silence between them. Around 1837, Morse therefore developed such a method, an early forerunner to the modern International Morse code.

The Morse system for telegraphy, which was first used in about 1844, was designed to make indentations on a paper tape when electric currents were received. Morse&#x27;s original telegraph receiver used a mechanical clockwork to move a paper tape. When an electrical current was received, an electromagnet engaged an armature that pushed a stylus onto the moving paper tape, making an indentation on the tape. When the current was interrupted, a spring retracted the stylus and that portion of the moving tape remained unmarked. Morse code was developed so that operators could translate the indentations marked on the paper tape into text messages.

In his earliest design for a code, Morse had planned to transmit only numerals, and to use a codebook to look up each word according to the number which had been sent. However, the code was soon expanded by Alfred Vail in 1840 to include letters and special characters, so it could be used more generally. Vail estimated the frequency of use of letters in the English language by counting the movable type he found in the type-cases of a local newspaper in Morristown, New Jersey. The shorter marks were called &quot;dots&quot; and the longer ones &quot;dashes&quot;, and the letters most commonly used were assigned the shortest sequences of dots and dashes. This code, first used in 1844, was what later became known as &quot;Morse landline code&quot;, &quot;American Morse code&quot;, or &quot;Railroad Morse&quot;, until the end of railroad telegraphy in the U.S. in the 1970s.

===Operator-led change from graphical to audible code===
In the original Morse telegraph system, the receiver&#x27;s armature made a clicking noise as it moved in and out of position to mark the paper tape. Early telegraph operators soon learned that they could translate the clicks directly into dots and dashes, and write these down by hand, thus making the paper tape unnecessary. When Morse code was adapted to radio communication, the dots and dashes were sent as short and long tone pulses.

Later telegraphy training found that people become more proficient at receiving Morse code when it is taught &quot;like a language&quot;, with each code perceived as a whole &quot;word&quot; instead of a sequence of separate dots and dashes, such as might be shown on a page.

With the advent of tones produced by radiotelegraph receivers, the operators began to vocalize a dot as &quot;dit&quot;, and a dash as &quot;dah&quot;, to reflect the sounds of Morse code they heard. To conform to normal sending speed, &quot;dits&quot; which are not the last element of a code became voiced as &quot;di&quot;. For example, the () is voiced as . Morse code was sometimes facetiously known as &quot;iddy-umpty&quot;, a &quot;dit&quot; lampooned as &quot;iddy&quot; and a &quot;dah&quot; as &quot;umpty&quot;, leading to the word &quot;umpteen&quot;.
===Gerke&#x27;s refinement of Morse&#x27;s code ===
The Morse code, as specified in the current international standard, &quot;International Morse Code Recommendation&quot;, ITU-R M.1677-1, was derived from a much-improved proposal by Friedrich Gerke in 1848 that became known as the &quot;Hamburg alphabet&quot;, its only real defect being the use of an excessively long code ( and later the equal duration code ) for the frequently used vowel .

Gerke changed many of the codepoints, in the process doing away with the different length dashes and different inter-element spaces of American Morse, leaving only two coding elements, the dot and the dash. Codes for German umlauted vowels and were introduced. Gerke&#x27;s code was adopted in Germany and Austria in 1851.

This finally led to the International Morse code in 1865. The International Morse code adopted most of Gerke&#x27;s codepoints. The codes for &#x27; and &#x27; were taken from a code system developed by Steinheil. A new codepoint was added for &#x27; since Gerke did not distinguish between &#x27; and &#x27;. Changes were also made to &#x27;, &#x27;, and &#x27;. This left only four codepoints identical to the original Morse code, namely &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27; and &#x27;, and the latter two had their &quot;dahs&quot; extended to full length. The original American code being compared dates to 1838; the later American code shown in the table was developed in 1844.

===Radiotelegraphy and aviation===
In the 1890s, Morse code began to be used extensively for early radio communication before it was possible to transmit voice. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most high-speed international communication used Morse code on telegraph lines, undersea cables, and radio circuits.

Although previous transmitters were bulky and the spark gap system of transmission was dangerous and difficult to use, there had been some early attempts: In 1910, the U.S. Navy experimented with sending Morse from an airplane. However the first regular aviation radiotelegraphy was on airships, which had space to accommodate the large, heavy radio equipment then in use. The same year, 1910, a radio on the airship &quot;America&quot; was instrumental in coordinating the rescue of its crew.

During World War I, Zeppelin airships equipped with radio were used for bombing and naval scouting, and ground-based radio direction finders were used for airship navigation. Allied airships and military aircraft also made some use of radiotelegraphy.

However, there was little aeronautical radio in general use during World War I, and in the 1920s, there was no radio system used by such important flights as that of Charles Lindbergh from New York to Paris in 1927. Once he and the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; were off the ground, Lindbergh was truly incommunicado and alone. Morse code in aviation began regular use in the mid-1920s. By 1928, when the first airplane flight was made by the &quot;Southern Cross&quot; from California to Australia, one of its four crewmen was a radio operator who communicated with ground stations via radio telegraph.

Beginning in the 1930s, both civilian and military pilots were required to be able to use Morse code, both for use with early communications systems and for identification of navigational beacons that transmitted continuous two- or three-letter identifiers in Morse code. Aeronautical charts show the identifier of each navigational aid next to its location on the map.

In addition, rapidly moving field armies could not have fought effectively without radiotelegraphy; they moved more quickly than their communications services could put up new telegraph and telephone lines. This was seen especially in the blitzkrieg offensives of the Nazi German Wehrmacht in Poland, Belgium, France (in 1940), the Soviet Union, and in North Africa; by the British Army in North Africa, Italy, and the Netherlands; and by the U.S. Army in France and Belgium (in 1944), and in southern Germany in 1945.

=== Maritime flash telegraphy and radio telegraphy ===

Radiotelegraphy using Morse code was vital during World War II, especially in carrying messages between the warships and the naval bases of the belligerents. Long-range ship-to-ship communication was by radio telegraphy, using encrypted messages because the voice radio systems on ships then were quite limited in both their range and their security. Radiotelegraphy was also extensively used by warplanes, especially by long-range patrol planes that were sent out by navies to scout for enemy warships, cargo ships, and troop ships.

Morse code was used as an international standard for maritime distress until 1999 when it was replaced by the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System. When the French Navy ceased using Morse code on January 31, 1997, the final message transmitted was &quot;Calling all. This is our last call before our eternal silence.&quot;

===Demise of commercial telegraphy===
In the United States the final commercial Morse code transmission was on July 12, 1999, signing off with Samuel Morse&#x27;s original 1844 message, , and the prosign (&quot;end of contact&quot;).

, the United States Air Force still trains ten people a year in Morse.

The United States Coast Guard has ceased all use of Morse code on the radio, and no longer monitors any radio frequencies for Morse code transmissions, including the international medium frequency (MF) distress frequency of However, the Federal Communications Commission still grants commercial radiotelegraph operator licenses to applicants who pass its code and written tests. Licensees have reactivated the old California coastal Morse station KPH and regularly transmit from the site under either this call sign or as KSM. Similarly, a few U.S. museum ship stations are operated by Morse enthusiasts.

== Operator proficiency ==
Morse code speed is measured in words per minute () or characters per minute (). Characters have differing lengths because they contain differing numbers of &quot;dits&quot; and &quot;dahs&quot;. Consequently, words also have different lengths in terms of dot duration, even when they contain the same number of characters. For this reason, some standard word is adopted for measuring operators&#x27; transmission speeds: Two such standard words in common use are &#x27; and &#x27;. Operators skilled in Morse code can often understand (&quot;copy&quot;) code in their heads at rates in excess of 40 .

In addition to knowing, understanding, and being able to copy the standard written alpha-numeric and punctuation characters or symbols at high speeds, skilled high-speed operators must also be fully knowledgeable of all of the special unwritten Morse code symbols for the standard Prosigns for Morse code and the meanings of these special procedural signals in standard Morse code communications protocol.

International contests in code copying are still occasionally held. In July 1939 at a contest in Asheville, North Carolina in the United States, Theodore Roosevelt McElroy (&#x27;) set a still-standing record for Morse copying, 75.2 . Pierpont (2004) also notes that some operators may have passed 100 . By this time, they are &quot;hearing&quot; phrases and sentences rather than words. The fastest speed ever sent by a straight key was achieved in 1942 by Harry Turner (&#x27;) (d. 1992) who reached 35  in a demonstration at a U.S. Army base. To accurately compare code copying speed records of different eras it is useful to keep in mind that different standard words (50 dit durations versus 60 dit durations) and different interword gaps (5 dit durations versus 7 dit durations) may have been used when determining such speed records. For example, speeds run with the &#x27; standard word and the &#x27; standard may differ by up to 20%.

Today among amateur operators there are several organizations that recognize high-speed code ability, one group consisting of those who can copy Morse at 60 . Also, Certificates of Code Proficiency are issued by several amateur radio societies, including the American Radio Relay League. Their basic award starts at 10  with endorsements as high as 40 , and are available to anyone who can copy the transmitted text. Members of the Boy Scouts of America may put a Morse interpreter&#x27;s strip on their uniforms if they meet the standards for translating code at 5 .

Through May 2013, the First, Second, and Third Class (commercial) Radiotelegraph Licenses using code tests based upon the standard word were still being issued in the United States by the Federal Communications Commission. The First Class license required 20  code group and 25  text code proficiency, the others 16  code group test (five letter blocks sent as simulation of receiving encrypted text) and 20  code text (plain language) test. It was also necessary to pass written tests on operating practice and electronics theory. A unique additional demand for the First Class was a requirement of a year of experience for operators of shipboard and coast stations using Morse. This allowed the holder to be chief operator on board a passenger ship. However, since 1999 the use of satellite and very high-frequency maritime communications systems (GMDSS) has made them obsolete. (By that point meeting experience requirement for the First was very difficult.)

Currently, only one class of license, the Radiotelegraph Operator License, is issued. This is granted either when the tests are passed or as the Second and First are renewed and become this lifetime license. For new applicants, it requires passing a written examination on electronic theory and radiotelegraphy practices, as well as 16  code-group and 20  text tests. However, the code exams are currently waived for holders of Amateur Extra Class licenses who obtained their operating privileges under the old 20  test requirement.

== International Morse code ==
Morse codes of one version or another have been in use for more than 160 years — longer than any other electrical message encoding system. What is called Morse code today is actually somewhat different from what was originally developed by Vail and Morse. The Modern International Morse code, or &quot;continental code&quot;, was created by Friedrich Clemens Gerke in 1848 and initially used for telegraphy between Hamburg and Cuxhaven in Germany. Gerke changed nearly half of the alphabet and all of the numerals, providing the foundation for the modern form of the code. After some minor changes to the letters and a complete revision of the numerals, International Morse Code was standardized by the International Telegraphy Congress in 1865 in Paris, and later became the standard adopted by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Morse and Vail&#x27;s final code specification, however, was only really used only for land-line telegraphy in the United States and Canada, with the International code used everywhere else, including all ships at sea and sailing in North American waters. Morse&#x27;s version became known as &quot;American Morse code&quot; or &quot;railroad code&quot;, and is now almost never used, with the possible exception of historical re-enactments.

===Aviation===

In aviation, pilots use radio navigation aids. To allow pilots to ensure that the stations they intend to use are serviceable, the stations transmit a set of identification letters (usually a two-to-five-letter version of the station name) in Morse code. Station identification letters are shown on air navigation charts. For example, the VOR-DME based at Vilo Acuña Airport in Cayo Largo del Sur, Cuba is identified by &quot;UCL&quot;, and Morse code is repeatedly transmitted on its radio frequency.

In some countries, during periods of maintenance, the facility may instead transmit the signal (), or the identification may be removed, which tells pilots and navigators that the station is unreliable. In Canada, the identification is removed entirely to signify the navigation aid is not to be used.

In the aviation service, Morse is typically sent at a very slow speed of about 5 words per minute. In the U.S., pilots do not actually have to know Morse to identify the transmitter because the dot/dash sequence is written out next to the transmitter&#x27;s symbol on aeronautical charts. Some modern navigation receivers automatically translate the code into displayed letters.

===Amateur radio===

International Morse code today is most popular among amateur radio operators, in the mode commonly referred to as &quot;continuous wave&quot; or &quot;CW&quot;.
Other, faster keying methods are available in radio telegraphy, such as frequency-shift keying (FSK).

The original amateur radio operators used Morse code exclusively since voice-capable radio transmitters did not become commonly available until around 1920. Until 2003, the International Telecommunication Union mandated Morse code proficiency as part of the amateur radio licensing procedure worldwide. However, the World Radiocommunication Conference of 2003 made the Morse code requirement for amateur radio licensing optional. Many countries subsequently removed the Morse requirement from their license requirements.

Until 1991, a demonstration of the ability to send and receive Morse code at a minimum of five words per minute () was required to receive an amateur radio license for use in the United States from the Federal Communications Commission. Demonstration of this ability was still required for the privilege to use the shortwave bands. Until 2000, proficiency at the 20  level was required to receive the highest level of amateur license (Amateur Extra Class); effective April 15, 2000, in the FCC reduced the Extra Class requirement to 5 . Finally, effective on February 23, 2007, the FCC eliminated the Morse code proficiency requirements from all amateur radio licenses.

While voice and data transmissions are limited to specific amateur radio bands under U.S. rules, Morse code is permitted on all amateur bands: LF, MF low, MF high, HF, VHF, and UHF. In some countries, certain portions of the amateur radio bands are reserved for transmission of Morse code signals only.

Because Morse code transmissions employ an on-off keyed radio signal, it requires less complex equipment than other radio transmission modes. Morse code also uses less bandwidth (typically only 100–150 Hz wide, although only for a slow data rate) than voice communication (roughly 2,400~2,800 Hz used by SSB voice).

Morse code is usually received as a high-pitched audio tone, so transmissions are easier to copy than voice through the noise on congested frequencies, and it can be used in very high noise / low signal environments. The fact that the transmitted power is concentrated into a very limited bandwidth makes it possible to use narrow receiver filters, which suppress or eliminate interference on nearby frequencies. The narrow signal bandwidth also takes advantage of the natural aural selectivity of the human brain, further enhancing weak signal readability. This efficiency makes CW extremely useful for DX (long distance) transmissions, as well as for low-power transmissions (commonly called &quot;QRP operation&quot;, from the Q-code for &quot;reduce power&quot;). There are several amateur clubs that require solid high speed copy, the highest of these has a standard of 60 . The American Radio Relay League offers a code proficiency certification program that starts at 10 .

The relatively limited speed at which Morse code can be sent led to the development of an extensive number of abbreviations to speed communication. These include prosigns, Q codes, and a set of Morse code abbreviations for typical message components. For example, &#x27; is broadcast to be interpreted as &quot;seek you&quot; (I&#x27;d like to converse with anyone who can hear my signal). The abbreviations &#x27; (old man), &#x27; (young lady), and &#x27; (&quot;ex-young lady&quot; – wife) are common. &#x27; or &#x27; is used by an operator when referring to the other operator (regardless of their actual age), and &#x27; or &#x27; (rather than the expected &#x27;) is used by an operator when referring to his or her spouse. &#x27; is &quot;transmitting location&quot; (spoken &quot;my Q.T.H.&quot; is &quot;my location&quot;). The use of abbreviations for common terms permits conversation even when the operators speak different languages.

Although the traditional telegraph key (straight key) is still used by some amateurs, the use of mechanical semi-automatic keyers
(informally called &quot;bugs&quot;), and of fully automatic electronic keyers (called &quot;single paddle&quot; and either &quot;double-paddle&quot; or &quot;iambic&quot; keys) is prevalent today. Software is also frequently employed to produce and decode Morse code radio signals. The ARRL has a readability standard for robot encoders called &quot;ARRL Farnsworth spacing&quot; that is supposed to have higher readability for both robot and human decoders. Some programs like WinMorse have implemented the standard.

===Other uses===
Radio navigation aids such as VORs and NDBs for aeronautical use broadcast identifying information in the form of Morse Code, though many VOR stations now also provide voice identification. Warships, including those of the U.S. Navy, have long used signal lamps to exchange messages in Morse code. Modern use continues, in part, as a way to communicate while maintaining radio silence.

Automatic Transmitter Identification System (ATIS) uses Morse code to identify uplink sources of analog satellite transmissions.
Many amateur radio repeaters identify with Morse, even though they are used for voice communications.

===Applications for the general public===

An important application is signalling for help through SOS, &quot;&quot;. This can be sent many ways: keying a radio on and off, flashing a mirror, toggling a flashlight, and similar methods. The SOS signal is not sent as three separate characters; rather, it is a prosign , and is keyed without gaps between characters.

===Morse code as an assistive technology===
Morse code has been employed as an assistive technology, helping people with a variety of disabilities to communicate. For example, the Android operating system versions 5.0 and higher allow users to input text using Morse Code as an alternative to a keypad or handwriting recognition.

Morse can be sent by persons with severe motion disabilities, as long as they have some minimal motor control. An original solution to the problem that caretakers have to learn to decode has been an electronic typewriter with the codes written on the keys. Codes were sung by users; see the voice typewriter employing Morse or votem.

Morse code can also be translated by computer and used in a speaking communication aid. In some cases, this means alternately blowing into and sucking on a plastic tube (&quot;sip-and-puff&quot; interface). An important advantage of Morse code over row column scanning is that once learned, it does not require looking at a display. Also, it appears faster than scanning.

In one case reported in the radio amateur magazine &quot;QST&quot;, an old shipboard radio operator who had a stroke and lost the ability to speak or write could communicate with his physician (a radio amateur) by blinking his eyes in Morse. Two examples of communication in intensive care units were also published in &quot;QST magazine&quot;. Another example occurred in 1966 when prisoner of war Jeremiah Denton, brought on television by his North Vietnamese captors, Morse-blinked the word . In these two cases, interpreters were available to understand those series of eye-blinks.

==Representation, timing, and speeds==


International Morse code is composed of five elements:

# short mark, dot or &quot;dit&quot; (): &quot;dit duration&quot; is one time unit long
# long mark, dash or &quot;dah&quot; (): three time units long
# inter-element gap between the &quot;dits&quot; and &quot;dahs&quot; within a character: one dot duration or one unit long
# short gap (between letters): three time units long
# medium gap (between words): seven time units long (formerly five)

===Transmission===
Morse code can be transmitted in a number of ways: Originally as electrical pulses along a telegraph wire, but later extended to an audio tone, a radio signal with short and long tones, or high and low tones, or as a mechanical, audible, or visual signal (e.g. a flashing light) using devices like an Aldis lamp or a heliograph, a common flashlight, or even a car horn. Some mine rescues have used pulling on a rope - a short pull for a dot and a long pull for a &quot;dah&quot;. Ground forces send messages to aircraft with panel signalling, where a horizontal panel is a dah and a vertical panel a dit.

Morse messages are generally transmitted by a hand-operated device such as a telegraph key, so there are variations introduced by the skill of the sender and receiver — more experienced operators can send and receive at faster speeds. In addition, individual operators differ slightly, for example, using slightly longer or shorter &quot;dahs&quot; or gaps, perhaps only for particular characters. This is called their &quot;fist&quot;, and experienced operators can recognize specific individuals by it alone. A good operator who sends clearly and is easy to copy is said to have a &quot;good fist&quot;. A &quot;poor fist&quot; is a characteristic of sloppy or hard to copy Morse code.

==== Digital storage ====
Morse code is transmitted using just two states (on and off). Morse code may be represented as a binary code, and that is what telegraph operators do when transmitting messages. Working from the above ITU definition and further defining a bit as a dot time, a Morse code sequence may be crudely represented a combination of the following five bit-strings:

# short mark, dot or &quot;dit&quot; (): &#x27;1&#x27;b
# longer mark, dash or &quot;dah&quot; (): &#x27;111&#x27;b
# intra-character gap (between the &quot;dits&quot; and &quot;dahs&quot; within a character): 0
# short gap (between letters): &#x27;000&#x27;b
# medium gap (between words): &#x27;0000000&#x27;b

The marks and gaps alternate: &quot;Dits&quot; and &quot;dahs&quot; are always separated by one of the gaps, and that the gaps are always separated by a &quot;dit&quot; or a &quot;dah&quot;.

A more efficient binary encoding uses only two-bits for each &quot;dit&quot; or &quot;dah&quot; element, with the 1 &quot;dit&quot;-length pause that must follow after each automatically included for every 2 bit code. One possible coding is by number value for the length of signal tone sent one could use &#x27;01&#x27;b for a &quot;dit&quot; and the automatic single-dit pause after it, and &#x27;11&#x27;b for a &quot;dah&quot; and the automatic single-&quot;dit&quot; following pause, and &#x27;00&#x27;b for the &quot;extra&quot; pause between letters (in effect, an end-of-letter mark). That leaves the code &#x27;10&#x27;b available for some other purpose, such as an escape character, or to more compactly represent the &quot;extra&quot; space between words (an end-of-word mark) instead of &#x27;00 00 00&#x27;b (only 6 &quot;dit&quot; lengths, since the 7th is automatically inserted as part of the prior &quot;dit&quot; or &quot;dah&quot;). Although the &quot;dit&quot; and inter-letter pauses work out to be the same, for any letter containing a &quot;dah&quot;, the two-bit encoding uses digital memory more compactly than the direct-conversion bit strings mentioned above. Including the letter-separating spaces, all International Morse letter codes pack into 12 bits or less (5 symbols), and most fit into 10 bits or less (4 symbols); most of the procedural signs fit into 14 bits, with a few only needing 12 bits (5 symbols); and all digits require exactly 12 bits.

For example, Morse ( + 2 &quot;extra&quot; empty dits for &quot;end of letter&quot;) would binary-encode as &#x27;11&#x27;b, &#x27;11&#x27;b, &#x27;01&#x27;b, &#x27;00&#x27;b; when packed it is &#x27;1111 0100&#x27;b = &#x27;F4&#x27;x, which stores into only one byte (two nibbles) (as does every three-element code). The bit encoding for the longer method mentioned earlier the same letter would encode as &#x27;1110&#x27;b, &#x27;1110&#x27;b, &#x27;1000&#x27;b = &#x27;1110 1110 1000&#x27;b = &#x27;EE8&#x27;x, or one-and-a-half bytes (three nibbles). The space saving allows small devices, like portable memory keyers, to have more and longer International Morse code sequences in small, conventional device-driver microprocessors&#x27; RAM chips.

===Cable code===
The very long time constants of 19th and early 20th century submarine communications cables required a different form of Morse signalling. Instead of keying a voltage on and off for varying times, the dits and dahs were represented by two polarities of voltage impressed on the cable, for a uniform time.

===Timing===
Below is an illustration of timing conventions. The phrase , in Morse code format, would normally be written something like this, where represents &quot;dahs&quot; and represents &quot;dits&quot;:
 −− −−− ·−· ··· · −·−· −−− −·· ·
 M O R S E C O D E
Next is the exact conventional timing for this phrase, with representing &quot;signal on&quot;, and representing &quot;signal off&quot;, each for the time length of exactly one dit:


===Spoken representation===
Morse code is often spoken or written with &quot;dah&quot; for dashes, &quot;dit&quot; for dots located at the end of a character, and &quot;di&quot; for dots located at the beginning or internally within the character. Thus, the following Morse code sequence:

is spoken (or sung):

For use on radio, there is little point in learning to read &quot;written&quot; Morse as above; rather, the &quot;sounds&quot; of all of the letters and symbols need to be learned, for both sending and receiving.

===Speed in words per minute===
All Morse code elements depend on the dot / &quot;dit&quot; length. A &quot;dah&quot; is the length of 3 dits (with no gaps between), and spacings are specified in number of &quot;dit&quot; lengths. An unambiguous method of specifying the transmission speed is to specify the &quot;dit&quot; duration as, for example, 50 milliseconds.

Specifying the &quot;dit&quot; duration is, however, not the common practice. Usually, speeds are stated in words per minute. That introduces ambiguity because words have different numbers of characters, and characters have different &quot;dit&quot; lengths. It is not immediately clear how a specific word rate determines the &quot;dit&quot; duration in milliseconds.

Some method to standardize the transformation of a word rate to a &quot;dit&quot; duration is useful. A simple way to do this is to choose a &quot;dit&quot; duration that would send a typical word the desired number of times in one minute. If, for example, the operator wanted a character speed of 13 words per minute, the operator would choose a &quot;dit&quot; rate that would send the typical word 13 times in exactly one minute.

The typical word thus determines the &quot;dit&quot; length. It is common to assume that a word is 5 characters long. There are two common typical words: &#x27; and &#x27;. &#x27; mimics a word rate that is typical of natural language words and reflects the benefits of Morse code&#x27;s shorter code durations for common characters such as &#x27; and &#x27;. &#x27; offers a word rate that is typical of 5 letter code groups (sequences of random letters). Using the word &#x27; as a standard, the number of &quot;dit&quot; units is 50 and a simple calculation shows that the &quot;dit&quot; length at 20 words per minute is 60 milliseconds. Using the word &#x27; with 60 dit units, the &quot;dit&quot; length at 20 words per minute is 50 milliseconds.

Because Morse code is usually sent by hand, it is unlikely that an operator could be that precise with the &quot;dit&quot; length, and the individual characteristics and preferences of the operators usually override the standards.

For commercial radiotelegraph licenses in the United States, the Federal Communications Commission specifies tests for Morse code proficiency in words per minute and in code groups per minute. The FCC specifies that a &quot;word&quot; is 5 characters long. The Commission specifies Morse code test elements at 16 code groups per minute, 20 words per minute, 20 code groups per minute, and 25 words per minute. The word per minute rate would be close to the &#x27; standard, and the code groups per minute would be close to the &#x27; standard.

While the Federal Communications Commission no longer requires Morse code for amateur radio licenses, the old requirements were similar to the requirements for commercial radiotelegraph licenses.

A difference between amateur radio licenses and commercial radiotelegraph licenses is that commercial operators must be able to receive code groups of random characters along with plain language text. For each class of license, the code group speed requirement is slower than the plain language text requirement. For example, for the Radiotelegraph Operator License, the examinee must pass a 20 word per minute plain text test and a 16 word per minute code group test.

Based upon a 50 dit duration standard word such as , the time for one &quot;dit&quot; duration or one unit can be computed by the formula:

:formula_1

where: is the unit time, or &quot;dit&quot; duration in milliseconds, and is the speed in .

High-speed telegraphy contests are held; according to the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; in June 2005 at the International Amateur Radio Union&#x27;s 6th World Championship in High Speed Telegraphy in Primorsko, Bulgaria, Andrei Bindasov of Belarus transmitted 230 Morse code marks of mixed text in one minute.

===Farnsworth speed===
Sometimes, especially while teaching Morse code, the timing rules above are changed so two different speeds are used: A character speed and a text speed. The character speed is how fast each individual letter is sent. The text speed is how fast the entire message is sent. For example, individual characters may be sent at a 13 words-per-minute rate, but the intercharacter and interword gaps may be lengthened so the word rate is only 5 words per minute.

Using different character and text speeds is, in fact, a common practice, and is used in the Farnsworth method of learning Morse code.

===Alternative display of common characters in International Morse code===

Some methods of teaching Morse code use a dichotomic search table.
== Learning methods ==
People learning Morse code using the &quot;Farnsworth method&quot; are taught to send and receive letters and other symbols at their full target speed, that is with normal relative timing of the &quot;dits&quot;, &quot;dahs&quot;, and spaces within each symbol for that speed. The Farnsworth method is named for Donald R. &quot;Russ&quot; Farnsworth, also known by his call sign, W6TTB. However, initially exaggerated spaces between symbols and words are used, to give &quot;thinking time&quot; to make the sound &quot;shape&quot; of the letters and symbols easier to learn. The spacing can then be reduced with practice and familiarity.

Another popular teaching method is the Koch method, invented in 1935 by the German engineer and former stormtrooper Ludwig Koch, which uses the full target speed from the outset but begins with just two characters. Once strings containing those two characters can be copied with 90% accuracy, an additional character is added, and so on until the full character set is mastered.

In North America, many thousands of individuals have increased their code recognition speed (after initial memorization of the characters) by listening to the regularly scheduled code practice transmissions broadcast by W1AW, the American Radio Relay League&#x27;s headquarters station. the United States military taught Morse code as an 81-day self-paced course, having phased out more traditional classes.

=== Mnemonics ===
Visual mnemonic charts have been devised over the ages. Baden-Powell included one in the Girl Guides handbook in 1918.

In the United Kingdom, many people learned the Morse code by means of a series of words or phrases that have the same rhythm as a Morse character. For instance, &#x27; in Morse is which can be memorized by the phrase &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, and the Morse for &#x27; is which can be memorized as &quot;Did she like it?&quot;

==Letters, numbers, punctuation, prosigns for Morse code and non-Latin variants==
=== Cut numbers ===
Most numbers have an unofficial short-form, given in the table below. They are only used when both the sender and the receiver understand that numbers, and not letters, are intended; for example, one often sees the most common R-S-T signal report rendered as 5 instead of 599.

Table notes
=== Prosigns ===

Prosigns for Morse code are special (usually) unwritten procedural signals or symbols that are used to indicate changes in communications protocol status or white space text formatting actions.

=== Symbol representations ===
The symbols [!], [$], and [&amp;] are not defined inside the official ITU-R &quot;International Morse Code Recommendation&quot;, but informal conventions for them exist. (The [@] symbol was formally added in 2004.)

; Exclamation mark : There is no standard representation for the exclamation mark [!], although the digraph () was proposed in the 1980s by the Heathkit Company. While Morse code translation software prefers the Heathkit version, on-air use is not yet universal as some amateur radio operators in North America and the Caribbean continue to use the older digraph () copied over from American Morse landline code.
; Currency symbols : The ITU has never formally codified any currency symbols into Morse code: The unambiguous ISO 4217 currency codes are preferred for transmission.
: The [$] sign code was represented in the Phillips Code as two characters &quot;&quot;, which became merged into ().
; Ampersand [&amp;] : The suggested unofficial encoding of the ampersand [&amp;] sign listed above, often shown as , is also the official Morse prosign for &quot;wait&quot;. In addition, the American Morse encoding for an ampersand () was similar to &#x27; () and hams have nearly universally carried over this use as an abbreviation for &quot;and&quot; (e.g. &#x27; &quot;the weather here is cold and rainy&quot;).
; Keyboard &quot;at&quot; sign [@] : On 24 May 2004 – the 160th anniversary of the first public Morse telegraph transmission – the Radiocommunication Bureau of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-R) formally added the [@] (&quot;commercial at&quot; or &quot;commat&quot;) character to the official Morse character set, using the sequence denoted by the digraph:  .
: This sequence was reported to have been chosen to represent &quot;A[t] C[ommercial]&quot;, or a letter &quot;a&quot; inside a swirl represented by a letter &quot;C&quot;. The new character facilitates sending e‑mail addresses by Morse code, and is notable since it is the first official addition to the Morse set of characters since World War I.

===Diacritics and non-Latin extensions ===

The typical tactic for creating Morse codes for diacritics and non-Latin alphabetic scripts has been to begin by simply using the International Morse codes used for letters whose sound matches the sound of the local alphabet. Because Gerke code (the predecessor to International Morse) was in official use in central Europe, and included four characters not included in the International Morse standard (&#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, and &#x27;) it has served as a beginning-point for other languages that use an alphabetic script, but require codes for letters not accommodated by International Morse.

The usual method has been to first transliterate the sounds represented by the International code and the four unique Gerke codes into the local alphabet, hence Greek, Hebrew, Russian, and Ukrainian Morse codes. If more codes are needed, one can either invent a new code or convert an otherwise unused code from either code set to the non-Latin letter. For example:
* in Spanish Morse is , a language-specific code not used in either International or Gerke Morse.
* For the Greek letter , Greek Morse code uses the International Morse code for , , which has no corresponding letter in modern Greek; and have no historical, phonetic, or shape relationship.

For Russian and Bulgarian, Russian Morse code is used to map the Cyrillic characters to four-element codes. Many of the characters are encoded the same as their latin-alphabet look-alikes or sound-alikes (&#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, etc.). The Bulgarian alphabet contains 30 characters, which exactly match all possible combinations of 1, 2, 3, and 4 &quot;dits&quot; and &quot;dahs&quot; (Russian &#x27; is used as Bulgarian &#x27;, Russian &#x27; is used as Bulgarian &#x27;). Russian requires two more codes, for letters &#x27; and which are each encoded with 5 elements.

Non-alphabetic scripts require more radical adaption. Japanese Morse code (Wabun code) has a separate encoding for kana script; although many of the codes are used for International Morse, the sounds they represent are mostly unrelated. The Japanese / Wabun code includes special prosigns for switching back-and-forth from International Morse: signals a switch from International Morse to Wabun, and to return from Wabun to International Morse.

For Chinese, Chinese telegraph code is used to map Chinese characters to four-digit codes and send these digits out using standard Morse code. Korean Morse code uses the SKATS mapping, originally developed to allow Korean to be typed on western typewriters. SKATS maps hangul characters to arbitrary letters of the Latin script and has no relationship to pronunciation in Korean.

=== Unusual variants ===
During early World War I (1914–1916), Germany briefly experimented with &#x27;dotty&#x27; and &#x27;dashy&#x27; Morse, in essence adding a dot or a dash at the end of each Morse symbol. Each one was quickly broken by Allied SIGINT, and standard Morse was resumed by Spring 1916. Only a small percentage of Western Front (North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea) traffic was in &#x27;dotty&#x27; or &#x27;dashy&#x27; Morse during the entire war. In popular culture, this is mostly remembered in the book &quot;The Codebreakers&quot; by David Kahn and in the national archives of the UK and Australia (whose SIGINT operators copied most of this Morse variant). Kahn&#x27;s cited sources come from the popular press and wireless magazines of the time.

Other variations include forms of &quot;fractional Morse&quot; or &quot;fractionated Morse&quot;, which recombine the characters of the Morse codeencoded message and then encrypt them using a cipher in order to disguise the text.

==Decoding software==
Decoding software for Morse code ranges from software-defined wide-band radio receivers, coupled to the Reverse Beacon Network, which decodes signals and detects messages on ham bands, to smartphone applications.

<text>Emergency contraception (EC) is a birth control measure, used after sexual intercourse to prevent pregnancy.

There are different forms of EC. Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs), sometimes simply referred to as emergency contraceptives (ECs), or the morning-after pill, are medications intended to disrupt or delay ovulation or fertilization, which are necessary for pregnancy.

Intrauterine devices (IUDs)usually used as a primary contraceptive methodare sometimes used as the most effective form of emergency contraception. However, the use of IUDs for emergency contraception is relatively rare.
==Definition==
Emergency contraception is a birth control measure taken to reduce the risk of pregnancy following unprotected sexual intercourse or when other regular contraceptive measures have not worked properly or have not been used correctly. It is intended to be used occasionally and is not the same as medical abortion. Emergency contraception is offered to women who do not wish to conceive but have had unprotected sex on any day of the menstrual cycle, from day 21 after giving birth, or from day five after abortion or miscarriage. Emergency contraception measures include tablets taken by mouth or the insertion of a copper intrauterine device.

Emergency contraception is not related to medical abortion, which is a drug regimen administered to terminate pregnancies in any trimester.

==Emergency contraceptive pills==
Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) are sometimes referred to as emergency hormonal contraception (EHC). They are taken after unprotected sexual intercourse or the breakage of a condom.

===Types===
A variety of emergency contraceptive pills are available, including combined estrogen and progestin pills; progestin-only (levonorgestrel, LNG) pills; and antiprogestin (ulipristal acetate or mifepristone) pills. Progestin-only and anti-progestin pills are available as specifically packaged pills for use as emergency contraceptive pills. Emergency contraceptive pills originally contained higher doses of the same hormones (estrogens, progestins, or both) found in regular combined oral contraceptive pills. Combined estrogen and progestin pills are no longer recommended as dedicated emergency contraceptive pills (because this regimen is less effective and caused more nausea), but certain regular combined oral contraceptive pills (taken 2–5 at a time in what was called &quot;the Yuzpe regimen&quot;) have also been shown to be effective as emergency contraceptive pills.

Progestin-only emergency contraceptive pills contain levonorgestrel, either as a single tablet (or historically, as a split dose of two tablets taken 12 hours apart), effective up to 72 hours after intercourse. Progestin-only ECPs are sold under many different brand names. Progestin-only ECPs are available over-the-counter (OTC) in many countries (e.g. Australia, Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Canada, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, India, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, South Africa, Sweden, United States), from a pharmacist without a prescription, and available with a prescription in some other countries.

The antiprogestin ulipristal acetate is available as a micronized emergency contraceptive tablet, effective up to 120 hours after intercourse. Ulipristal acetate ECPs developed by HRA Pharma are available over the counter in Europe and by prescription in over 50 countries under the brand names ellaOne, ella (marketed by Watson Pharmaceuticals in the United States), Duprisal 30, Ulipristal 30, and UPRIS.

The antiprogestin mifepristone (also known as RU-486) is available in five countries as a low-dose or mid-dose emergency contraceptive tablet, effective up to 120 hours after intercourse. Low-dose mifepristone ECPs are available by prescription in Armenia, Russia, Ukraine, and Vietnam and from a pharmacist without a prescription in China. Mid-dose mifepristone ECPs are available by prescription in China and Vietnam.

Combined estrogen (ethinylestradiol) and progestin (levonorgestrel or norgestrel) pills used to be available as dedicated emergency contraceptive pills under several brand names: &quot;Schering PC4&quot;, &quot;Tetragynon&quot;, &quot;Neoprimavlar&quot;, and &quot;Preven&quot; (in the United States) but were withdrawn after more effective dedicated progestin-only (levonorgestrel) emergency contraceptive pills with fewer side effects became available. If other more effective dedicated emergency contraceptive pills (levonorgestrel, ulipristal acetate, or mifepristone) are not available, specific combinations of regular combined oral contraceptive pills can be taken in split doses 12 hours apart (the Yuzpe regimen), effective up to 72 hours after intercourse.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved this off-label use of certain brands of regular combined oral contraceptive pills in 1997. As of 2014, there are 26 brands of regular combined oral contraceptive pills containing levonorgestrel or norgestrel available in the United States that can be used in the emergency contraceptive Yuzpe regimen, when none of the more effective and better-tolerated options are available.

===Effectiveness===
Ulipristal acetate, and mid-dose mifepristone are both more effective than levonorgestrel, which is more effective than the Yuzpe method.

The effectiveness of emergency contraception is expressed as a percentage reduction in pregnancy rate for a single use of EC. Using an example of &quot;75% effective&quot;, the effectiveness calculation thus: 

The progestin-only regimen (using levonorgestrel) has an 89% effectiveness. , the labeling on the U.S. brand Plan B explained this effectiveness rate by stating, &quot;Seven out of every eight women who would have gotten pregnant will not become pregnant.&quot;

In 1999, a meta-analysis of eight studies of the combined (Yuzpe) regimen concluded that the best point estimate of effectiveness was 74%. A 2003 analysis of two of the largest combined (Yuzpe) regimen studies, using a different calculation method, found effectiveness estimates of 47% and 53%.

For both the progestin-only and Yuzpe regimens, the effectiveness of emergency contraception is highest when taken within 12 hours of intercourse and declines over time.
The World Health Organization (WHO) suggested that reasonable effectiveness may continue for up to 120 hours (5 days) after intercourse.

For 10 mg of mifepristone taken up to 120 hours (5 days) after intercourse, the combined estimate from three trials was an effectiveness of 83%. A review found that a moderate dose of mifepristone is better than LNG or Yuzpe, with delayed return of menstruation being the main adverse effect of most regimes.

HRA Pharma changed its packaging information for Norlevo (levonorgestrel 1.5 mg, which is identical to many other EHCs) in November 2013 warning that according to studies the drug loses effectiveness in women who weigh more than 75 kg (165 lb) and is completely ineffective for women who weigh over 80 kg (176 lb). After a review by European Medicines Agency, the statement was deleted from the leaflet. The agency communicated that levonorgestrel is safe and effective method of emergency contraception, regardless of body weight.

===Safety===
The most common side effect reported by users of emergency contraceptive pills was nausea, reported by 14 to 23% of levonorgestrel-only users and 50.5% of Yuzpe regimen users. Vomiting is much less common and unusual with levonorgestrel-only ECPs (5.6% of levonorgestrel-only users vs 18.8% of 979 Yuzpe regimen users in 1998 WHO trial; 1.4% of 2,720 levonorgestrel-only users in the 2002 WHO trial). Anti-emetics are not routinely recommended with levonorgestrel-only ECPs. If a woman vomits within 2 hours of taking a levonorgestrel-only ECP, she should take a further dose as soon as possible.

Other common side effects (each reported by less than 20% of levonorgestrel-only users in both the 1998 and 2002 WHO trials) were abdominal pain, fatigue, headache, dizziness, and breast tenderness. Side effects generally resolve within 24 hours, although temporary disruption of the menstrual cycle is commonly experienced. If taken before ovulation, the high doses of progestogen in levonorgestrel treatments may induce progestogen withdrawal bleeding a few days after the pills are taken.

One study found that about half of women who used levonorgestrel ECPs experienced bleeding within 7 days of taking the pills. If levonorgestrel is taken after ovulation, it may increase the length of the luteal phase, thus delaying menstruation by a few days. Mifepristone, if taken before ovulation, may delay ovulation by 3–4 days (delayed ovulation may result in a delayed menstruation). These disruptions only occur in the cycle in which ECPs were taken; subsequent cycle length is not significantly affected. If a woman&#x27;s menstrual period is delayed by two weeks or more, it is advised that she take a pregnancy test. (Earlier testing may not give accurate results.)

Existing pregnancy is not a contraindication in terms of safety, as there is no known harm to the woman, the course of her pregnancy, or the fetus if progestin-only or combined emergency contraception pills are accidentally used, but EC is not indicated for a woman with a known or suspected pregnancy because it is not effective in women who are already pregnant.

The World Health Organization (WHO) lists no medical condition for which the risks of emergency contraceptive pills outweigh the benefits. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and experts on emergency contraception have concluded that progestin-only ECPs are preferable to combined ECPs containing estrogen for all women, and particularly those with a history of blood clots, stroke, or migraine.

There are no medical conditions in which progestin-only ECPs are contraindicated. Current venous thromboembolism, current or history of breast cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and acute intermittent porphyria are conditions where the advantages of using emergency contraceptive pills generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks.

ECPs, like all other contraceptives, reduce the absolute risk of ectopic pregnancy by preventing pregnancies and there is no increase in the relative risk of ectopic pregnancy in women who become pregnant after using progestin-only ECPs.

==Interactions==
The herbal preparation of St John&#x27;s wort and some enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g. anticonvulsants or rifampicin) may reduce the effectiveness of ECP, and a larger dose may be required, especially in women who weigh more than 165 lbs.

==Intrauterine device==
An effective emergency contraception measure is the copper-T intrauterine device (IUD) which is generally recommended up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse or up to 5 days after probable ovulation. Some studies have found it to be effective up to 10 days after unprotected intercourse to prevent pregnancy. A 2021 study found that the hormonal IUD was as effective at emergency contraception as the copper IUD, though it is not offered by clinicians at the moment due to the lack of research done into the subject.

Insertion of an IUD is more effective than the use of emergency contraceptive pillspregnancy rates when used as emergency contraception are the same as with normal IUD use. Unlike emergency contraceptive pills, which work by delaying ovulation, the copper-T IUD works by interfering with sperm motility. Therefore, the copper IUD is equally effective as emergency contraception at all weight ranges. IUDs may be left in place following the subsequent menstruation to provide ongoing contraception for as long as desired (12+ years).

==As regular contraception==
One brand of levonorgestrel pills was marketed as an ongoing method of postcoital contraception. However, with typical use, failure rates are expected to be higher than with the use of other birth control methods.

Like all hormonal methods, postcoital high-dose progestin-only oral contraceptive pills do not protect against sexually transmitted infections.

ECPs are generally recommended for backup or &quot;emergency&quot; usefor example, if a woman has forgotten to take a birth control pill or when a condom is torn during sex. However, for women facing reproductive coercion, who are not able to use regular birth control, repeated use of EC pills may be the most viable option available.

==High-risk sex and abortion==
Making ECPs more widely available does not increase sexual risk-taking. While they are effective for individuals who use them in a timely fashion, the availability of EC pills does not appear to decrease abortion rates at the population level.

In 2012 the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) stated: &quot;Despite multiple studies showing no increased risk behaviour and evidence that hormonal emergency contraception will not disrupt an established pregnancy, public and medical discourse reflects that personal values of physicians and pharmacists continue to affect emergency-contraception access, particularly for adolescents.&quot;

==EC and sexual assault==

Beginning in the 1960s, women who had been sexually assaulted were offered diethylstilbestrol (DES). Currently, the standard of care is to offer ulipristal or prompt placement of a copper IUD which is the most effective form of EC. However, adherence to these best practices varies by the emergency department. Before these EC options were available (in 1996), pregnancy rates among females of child-bearing age who had been raped were around 5%. Although EC is recommended following sexual assault, room for improvement in clinical practice remains.

==Mechanism of action==
The primary mechanism of action of progestogen-only emergency contraceptive pills is to prevent fertilization by inhibition of ovulation. The best available evidence is that they do not have any post-fertilization effects such as the prevention of implantation. The U.S. FDA-approved labels and European EMA-approved labels (except for HRA Pharma&#x27;s &quot;NorLevo&quot;) levonorgestrel emergency contraceptive pills (based on labels for regular oral contraceptive pills) say they may cause endometrial changes that discourage implantation. Daily use of regular oral contraceptive pills can alter the endometrium (although this has not been proven to interfere with implantation), but the isolated use of a levonorgestrel emergency contraceptive pill does not have time to alter the endometrium.

In March 2011, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) issued a statement that: &quot;review of the evidence suggests that LNG [levonorgestreol] ECPs cannot prevent implantation of a fertilized egg. Language on implantation should not be included in LNG ECP product labeling.&quot; In June 2012, a &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial called on the FDA to remove from the label the unsupported suggestion that levonorgestrel emergency contraceptive pills inhibit implantation. In November 2013, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved a change to the label for HRA Pharma&#x27;s &quot;NorLevo&quot; saying it cannot prevent implantation of a fertilized egg.

Progestogen-only emergency contraceptive does not appear to affect the function of the fallopian tubes or increase the rate of ectopic pregnancies.

The primary mechanism of action of progesterone receptor modulator emergency contraceptive pills like low-dose and mid-dose mifepristone and ulipristal acetate is to prevent fertilization by inhibition or delay of ovulation. One clinical study found that post-ovulatory administration of ulipristal acetate altered the endometrium, but whether the changes would inhibit implantation is unknown. The European EMA-approved labels for ulipristal acetate emergency contraceptive pills do not mention an effect on implantation, but the U.S. FDA-approved label says: &quot;alterations to the endometrium that may affect implantation may also contribute to efficacy.&quot;

The primary mechanism of action of copper-releasing intrauterine devices (IUDs) as emergency contraceptives is to prevent fertilization because of copper toxicity to sperm and ova. The very high effectiveness of copper-releasing IUDs as emergency contraceptives implies that they must also prevent some pregnancies by post-fertilization effects such as prevention of implantation.

==History==
In 1966, gynecologist John McLean Morris and biologist Gertrude Van Wagenen at the Yale School of Medicine, reported the successful use of oral high-dose estrogen pills as post-coital contraceptives in women and rhesus macaque monkeys, respectively. A few different drugs were studied, with a focus on high-dose estrogens, and it was originally hoped that postcoital contraception would prove viable as an ongoing contraceptive method.

The first widely used methods were five-day treatments with high-dose estrogens, using diethylstilbestrol (DES) in the US and ethinylestradiol in the Netherlands by Haspels.

In the early 1970s, the Yuzpe regimen was developed by A. Albert Yuzpe in 1974; progestin-only postcoital contraception was investigated (1975); and the copper IUD was first studied for use as emergency contraception (1975). Danazol was tested in the early 1980s in the hopes that it would have fewer side effects than Yuzpe, but was found to be ineffective.

The Yuzpe regimen became the standard course of treatment for postcoital contraception in many countries in the 1980s. The first prescription-only combined estrogen-progestin dedicated product, Schering PC4 (ethinylestradiol and norgestrel), was approved in the UK in January 1984 and first marketed in October 1984. Schering introduced a second prescription-only combined product, Tetragynon (ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel) in Germany in 1985. By 1997, Schering AG dedicated prescription-only combined products had been approved in only 9 countries: the UK (Schering PC4), New Zealand (Schering PC4), South Africa (E-Gen-C), Germany (Tetragynon), Switzerland (Tetragynon), Denmark (Tetragynon), Norway (Tetragynon), Sweden (Tetragynon) and Finland (Neoprimavlar); and had been withdrawn from marketing in New Zealand in 1997 to prevent it being sold over-the-counter. Regular combined oral contraceptive pills (which were less expensive and more widely available) were more commonly used for the Yuzpe regimen even in countries where dedicated products were available.

Over time, interest in progestin-only treatments increased. The Special Program on Human Reproduction (HRP), an international organization whose members include the World Bank and World Health Organization, &quot;played a pioneering role in emergency contraception&quot; by &quot;confirming the effectiveness of levonorgestrel.&quot; After the WHO conducted a large trial comparing Yuzpe and levonorgestrel in 1998, combined estrogen-progestin products were gradually withdrawn from some markets (&quot;Preven&quot; in the United States discontinued May 2004, &quot;Schering PC4&quot; in the UK discontinued October 2001, and &quot;Tetragynon&quot; in France) in favor of progestin-only EC, although prescription-only dedicated Yuzpe regimen products are still available in some countries.

In 2002, China became the first country in which mifepristone was registered for use as EC.

In 2020, Japan announced it would consider easing regulations on the sale of emergency contraceptive pills without a prescription. Non-profit groups submitted a petition to the health ministry calling for prescription-free access to the pill. They had collected more than 100,000 signatures.

===Calculating effectiveness===
Early studies of emergency contraceptives did not attempt to calculate a failure rate; they simply reported the number of women who became pregnant after using an emergency contraceptive. Since 1980, clinical trials of emergency contraception have first calculated probable pregnancies in the study group if no treatment were given. The effectiveness is calculated by dividing observed pregnancies by the estimated number of pregnancies without treatment.

Placebo-controlled trials that could give a precise measure of the pregnancy rate without treatment would be unethical, so the effectiveness percentage is based on estimated pregnancy rates. These are currently estimated using variants of the calendar method.
Women with irregular cycles for any reason (including recent hormone use such as oral contraceptives and breastfeeding) must be excluded from such calculations. Even for women included in the calculation, the limitations of calendar methods of fertility determination have long been recognized. In their February 2014 emergency review article, Trussell and Raymond note:
In 1999, hormonal assay was suggested as a more accurate method of estimating fertility for EC studies.

====DES====
* In 1971, a &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; editorial calling attention to previously published studies on the use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive at Yale University, and a large study published in &quot;JAMA&quot; on the use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive at the University of Michigan, led to off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive becoming prevalent at many university health services.
* In May 1973, in an attempt to restrict off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive to emergency situations such as rape, a &quot;FDA Drug Bulletin&quot; was sent to all U.S. physicians and pharmacists that said the FDA had approved, under restricted conditions, postcoital contraceptive use of DES. (In February 1975, the FDA Commissioner testified that the only error in the May 1973 &quot;FDA Drug Bulletin&quot; was that the FDA had not approved postcoital contraceptive use of DES).
* In September 1973, the FDA published a proposed rule specifying patient labeling and special packaging requirements for any manufacturer seeking FDA approval to market DES as a postcoital contraceptive, inviting manufacturers to submit abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) for that indication, and notifying manufacturers that the FDA intended to order the withdrawal of DES 25 mg tablets (which were being used off-label as postcoital contraceptives).
* In late 1973, Eli Lilly, the largest U.S. manufacturer of DES, discontinued its DES 25 mg tablets and in March 1974 sent a letter to all U.S. physicians and pharmacists telling them it did not recommend use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive.
* Only one pharmaceutical company, Tablicaps, Inc., a small manufacturer of generic drugs, ever submitted (in January 1974) an ANDA for use of DES as an emergency postcoital contraceptive, and the FDA never approved it.
* In February 1975, the FDA said it had not yet approved DES as a postcoital contraceptive, but would after March 8, 1975, permit marketing of DES for that indication in emergency situations such as rape or incest &quot;if&quot; a manufacturer obtained an approved ANDA that provided patient labeling and special packaging as set out in a FDA final rule published in February 1975. To discourage off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive, in February 1975 the FDA ordered DES 25 mg (and higher) tablets removed from the market and ordered the labeling of lower doses (5 mg and lower) of DES still approved for other indications be changed to state: &quot;THIS DRUG PRODUCT SHOULD &quot;not&quot; BE USED AS A POSTCOITAL CONTRACEPTIVE&quot; in block capital letters on the first line of the physician prescribing information package insert and in a prominent and conspicuous location of the container and carton label.
* In March 1978, a &quot;FDA Drug Bulletin&quot; was sent to all U.S. physicians and pharmacists which said: &quot;FDA has not yet given approval for any manufacturer to market DES as a postcoital contraceptive. The Agency, however, will approve this indication for emergency situations such as rape or incest if a manufacturer provides patient labeling and special packaging. To discourage &#x27;morning after&#x27; use of DES without patient labeling, FDA has removed from the market the 25 mg tablets of DES, formerly used for this purpose.&quot;
* In the 1980s, off-label use of the Yuzpe regimen superseded off-label use of DES for postcoital contraception.
** DES is no longer commercially available in the U.S.; Eli Lilly, the last U.S. manufacturer, ceased production in spring 1997.

====Preven====
* On February 25, 1997, the FDA posted a notice in the &quot;Federal Register&quot; saying it had concluded that the Yuzpe regimen was safe and effective for off-label use as postcoital EC, was prepared to accept NDAs for COCPs labeled as ECPs, and listed 6 then available COCPs (there are now 22) that could be used as ECPs.
* On September 1, 1998, the FDA approved the prescription Yuzpe regimen Preven Emergency Contraception Kit (which contained a urine pregnancy test and 4 COCPs). Preven was discontinued in May 2004.

====Plan B====
* On July 28, 1999, the FDA approved the prescription progestin-only Plan B (two 750 μg levonorgestrel pills) emergency contraceptive.
* On August 24, 2006, the FDA approved nonprescription behind-the-counter access to Plan B from pharmacies staffed by a licensed pharmacist for women 18 or older; a prescription-only form of Plan B was made available for younger females aged 17 and younger.
* On November 6, 2006, Barr Pharmaceuticals announced that its subsidiary, Duramed Pharmaceuticals, had initiated shipment of dual-label Plan B OTC/Rx and it would be available in pharmacies across the U.S. by mid-November 2006.
* On March 23, 2009, a US judge ordered the FDA to allow 17-year-olds to acquire Plan B without a prescription. This now changes the August 24, 2006, ruling and Plan B is now available &quot;behind the counter&quot; for men and women. There is a prescription method available for girls under 17.
* On April 30, 2013, the FDA approved (with three-year marketing exclusivity) Teva Pharmaceutical Industries&#x27; Plan B One-Step for sale without a prescription to anyone age 15 or over who can show proof of age such as a driver&#x27;s license, birth certificate, or passport to a drug store retail clerk. Generic one-pill levonorgestrel emergency contraceptives and all two-pill levonorgestrel emergency contraceptives will remain restricted to sale from a pharmacist—without a prescription to anyone age 17 or over who can show proof of age.
* On June 10, 2013, the Obama administration ceased trying to block over-the-counter availability of the pill. With this reversal it means that any person will be able to purchase the Plan B One-Step without a prescription.

==Availability==
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom was reported to have caused &quot;significant disruption&quot; to contraceptive services in the United Kingdom.

===United States===
After &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and &quot;Doe v. Bolton&quot; resulted in the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s 1973 ruling to legalize abortion, both Federal and State laws were created to allow medical professionals and institutions the right to deny reproductive health services without financial, professional, or legal penalty. &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; caused a historical survey to be conducted and concluded that right to privacy cases such as &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; allowed women to have parental control over childrearing, including the use of contraception for reproductive autonomy. After this, women became more informed about contraceptives and began requesting them more often.

Almost all 50 states have implemented policies on sterilization, contraceptives, and abortion services. Since the late 1990s, due to rights given by specific policies, the dispensation of emergency contraceptives on issues of religious and moral objections of providing care has extended from doctors, nurses, and hospitals to pharmacies and individual pharmacists. Furthermore, many states have insurance policies that cover contraceptives alongside all other prescription drugs, but may have exemptions for employers or private insurers on religious grounds. Different state legislatures have taken different routes in broadening access to emergency contraceptives. In some states, if a woman has been sexually assaulted, it is mandatory to provide her access to EC. In other states, women have been allowed various amounts of access, including the ability to access EC without a prescription from a physician, creation of policies limiting the ability of pharmacists to deny EC on religious and moral grounds, and creation of policies discouraging pharmacists from denying to fill contraceptive prescriptions. One state even requires all pharmacies to stock and fill every method of contraception. However, other states have restricted access of emergency contraception from state Medicaid family planning eligibility expansions or contraceptive coverage mandates, or by allowing the refusal of providing contraceptive services by healthcare professionals.

Under federal law, a provision of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 has guaranteed coverage of contraceptives, applying to most private health plans nationwide. The provision has also specifically required coverage for 18 methods of contraception used by women, related counselling and services, and requires the coverage provided not to be an out-of-pocket cost to the people. In October 2017, however, the Trump administration made it easier for employers that offer health care plans to exclude contraceptive coverage. The two regulations that allow employers to reject contraceptive coverage are religious and moral objection, but the courts have blocked the enforcement of these regulations. As of today, 29 states require that if insurance covers prescription drugs, it has to provide FDA-approved prescription contraceptive drugs and devices. 10 states prohibit the restriction and delay by insurers or medical management techniques to access contraceptives, and 8 states do not permit refusal on religious or moral grounds by any employers or insurerers. However, 21 states do allow the refusal to comply with the contraceptive coverage mandates, and 14 states prohibit cost sharing for contraceptives.

Emergency contraceptives are the most common prescription drug denied by a pharmacist due to their religious or moral beliefs. There have been cases where hormones, drugs and devices used to treat human immunodeficiency virus and diabetic medication have also been denied. This topic continues to be fought upon on different levels; for example, Stormans, Inc v Wiesman challenged Washington state regulations on providing all lawfully prescribed pharmaceuticals, including EC. They were challenging Washington state regulations on providing all lawfully prescribed pharmaceuticals. Courts have been warned that if pharmacists are allowed to deny EC prescriptions on religious or moral beliefs, it can affect public health and set a dangerous precedent with respect to &quot;critical, life-saving preventative care&quot;. The court denied the claim, stating that all pharmacies, even if the owner has a religious objection, must provide all prescribed medication, including EC. The pharmacy in question tried to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, but the appeal was rejected, leaving the lower court&#x27;s ruling in place. Wal-Mart, the third largest U.S. pharmacy chain, refused to carry EC from 1997 to 2006, which shows that accessibility may still be an issue in areas dependent on single pharmacies with no alternatives.

<text>Meat is animal tissue, often muscle, that is eaten as food. Humans have hunted and farmed other animals for meat since prehistory. The Neolithic Revolution allowed the domestication of vertebrates, including chickens, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, and cattle, starting around 11,000 years ago. Since then, selective breeding has enabled farmers to produce meat with the qualities desired by producers and consumers.

Meat is mainly composed of water, protein, and fat. Its quality is affected by many factors, including the genetics, health, and nutritional status of the animal involved. Without preservation, bacteria and fungi decompose and spoil unprocessed meat within hours or days. Meat is edible raw, but it is mostly eaten cooked, such as by stewing or roasting, or processed, such as by smoking or salting. 

The consumption of meat (especially red and processed meat, as opposed to fish and poultry) increases the risk of certain negative health outcomes including cancer, coronary heart disease, and diabetes. Meat production is a major contributor to environmental issues including global warming, pollution, and biodiversity loss, at local and global scales, but meat is important to economies and cultures around the world. Some people (vegetarians and vegans) choose not to eat meat for ethical, environmental, health or religious reasons.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;meat&quot; comes from the Old English word , meaning food in general. In modern usage, &quot;meat&quot; primarily means skeletal muscle with its associated fat and connective tissue, but it can include offal, other edible organs such as liver and kidney. The term is sometimes used in a more restrictive sense to mean the flesh of mammalian species (pigs, cattle, sheep, goats, etc.) raised and prepared for human consumption, to the exclusion of fish, other seafood, insects, poultry, or other animals.

== History ==

=== Domestication ===

Paleontological evidence suggests that meat constituted a substantial proportion of the diet of the earliest humans. Early hunter-gatherers depended on the organized hunting of large animals such as bison and deer. Animals were domesticated in the Neolithic, enabling the systematic production of meat and the breeding of animals to improve meat production.

=== Intensive animal farming ===

In the postwar period, governments gave farmers guaranteed prices to increase animal production. The effect was to raise output at the cost of increased inputs such as of animal feed and veterinary medicines, as well as of animal disease and environmental pollution. In 1966, the United States, the United Kingdom and other industrialized nations, began factory farming of beef and dairy cattle and domestic pigs. Intensive animal farming became globalized in the later years of the 20th century, replacing traditional stock rearing in countries around the world. In 1990 intensive animal farming accounted for 30% of world meat production and by 2005, this had risen to 40%.

=== Selective breeding ===

Modern agriculture employs techniques such as progeny testing to speed selective breeding, allowing the rapid acquisition of the qualities desired by meat producers. For instance, in the wake of well-publicized health concerns associated with saturated fats in the 1980s, the fat content of United Kingdom beef, pork and lamb fell from 20–26 percent to 4–8 percent within a few decades, due to both selective breeding for leanness and changed methods of butchery. Methods of genetic engineering that could improve the meat-producing qualities of animals are becoming available.

Meat production continues to be shaped by the demands of customers. The trend towards selling meat in pre-packaged cuts has increased the demand for larger breeds of cattle, better suited to producing such cuts. Animals not previously exploited for their meat are now being farmed, including mammals such as antelope, zebra, water buffalo and camel, as well as non-mammals, such as crocodile, emu and ostrich. Organic farming supports an increasing demand for meat produced to that standard.

== Animal growth and development ==

Several factors affect the growth and development of meat.

=== Genetics ===

Some economically important traits in meat animals are heritable to some degree, and can thus be selected for by animal breeding. In cattle, certain growth features are controlled by recessive genes which have not so far been excluded, complicating breeding. One such trait is dwarfism; another is the doppelender or &quot;double muscling&quot; condition, which causes muscle hypertrophy and thereby increases the animal&#x27;s commercial value. Genetic analysis continues to reveal the mechanisms that control numerous aspects of the endocrine system and, through it, meat growth and quality.

Genetic engineering can shorten breeding programs significantly because they allow for the identification and isolation of genes coding for desired traits, and for the reincorporation of these genes into the animal genome. To enable this, the genomes of many animals are being mapped. Some research has already seen commercial application. For instance, a recombinant bacterium has been developed which improves the digestion of grass in the rumen of cattle, and some features of muscle fibers have been genetically altered. Experimental reproductive cloning of commercially important meat animals such as sheep, pig or cattle has been successful. Asexual reproduction of animals bearing desirable traits is anticipated.

=== Environment ===

Heat regulation in livestock is of economic significance, as mammals attempt to maintain a constant optimal body temperature. Low temperatures tend to prolong animal development and high temperatures tend to delay it. Depending on their size, body shape and insulation through tissue and fur, some animals have a relatively narrow zone of temperature tolerance and others (e.g. cattle) a broad one. Static magnetic fields, for reasons still unknown, retard animal development.

=== Animal nutrition ===

The quality and quantity of usable meat depends on the animal&#x27;s &quot;plane of nutrition&quot;, i.e., whether it is over- or underfed. Scientists disagree about how exactly the plane of nutrition influences carcase composition.

The composition of the diet, especially the amount of protein provided, is an important factor regulating animal growth. Ruminants, which may digest cellulose, are better adapted to poor-quality diets, but their ruminal microorganisms degrade high-quality protein if supplied in excess. Because producing high-quality protein animal feed is expensive, several techniques are employed or experimented with to ensure maximum utilization of protein. These include the treatment of feed with formalin to protect amino acids during their passage through the rumen, the recycling of manure by feeding it back to cattle mixed with feed concentrates, or the conversion of petroleum hydrocarbons to protein through microbial action.

In plant feed, environmental factors influence the availability of crucial nutrients or micronutrients, a lack or excess of which can cause a great many ailments. In Australia, where the soil contains limited phosphate, cattle are fed additional phosphate to increase the efficiency of beef production. Also in Australia, cattle and sheep in certain areas were often found losing their appetite and dying in the midst of rich pasture; this was found to be a result of cobalt deficiency in the soil. Plant toxins are a risk to grazing animals; for instance, sodium fluoroacetate, found in some African and Australian plants, kills by disrupting the cellular metabolism. Some man-made pollutants such as methylmercury and some pesticide residues present a particular hazard as they bioaccumulate in meat, potentially poisoning consumers.

=== Animal welfare ===

Practices such as confinement in factory farming have generated concerns for animal welfare. Animals have abnormal behaviors such as tail-biting, cannibalism, and feather pecking. Invasive procedures such as beak trimming, castration, and ear notching have similarly been questioned. Breeding for high productivity may affect welfare, as when broiler chickens are bred to be very large and to grow rapidly. Broilers often have leg deformities and become lame, and many die from the stress of handling and transport.

=== Human intervention ===

Meat producers may seek to improve the fertility of female animals through the administration of gonadotrophic or ovulation-inducing hormones. In pig production, sow infertility is a common problem – possibly due to excessive fatness. No methods currently exist to augment the fertility of male animals. Artificial insemination is now routinely used to produce animals of the best possible genetic quality, and the efficiency of this method is improved through the administration of hormones that synchronize the ovulation cycles within groups of females.

Growth hormones, particularly anabolic agents such as steroids, are used in some countries to accelerate muscle growth in animals. This practice has given rise to the beef hormone controversy, an international trade dispute. It may decrease the tenderness of meat, although research on this is inconclusive, and have other effects on the composition of the muscle flesh. Where castration is used to improve control over male animals, its side effects can be counteracted by the administration of hormones. Myostatin has been used to produce muscle hypertrophy.

Sedatives may be administered to animals to counteract stress factors and increase weight gain. The feeding of antibiotics to certain animals increases growth rates. This practice is particularly prevalent in the US, but has been banned in the EU, partly because it causes antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic microorganisms.

== Composition ==

=== Biochemical ===

The biochemical composition of meat varies in complex ways depending on the species, breed, sex, age, plane of nutrition, training and exercise of the animal, as well as on the anatomical location of the musculature involved. Even between animals of the same litter and sex there are considerable differences in such parameters as the percentage of intramuscular fat.

Adult mammalian muscle consists of roughly 75 percent water, 19 percent protein, 2.5 percent intramuscular fat, 1.2 percent carbohydrates and 2.3 percent other soluble substances. These include organic compounds, especially amino acids, and inorganic substances such as minerals. Muscle proteins are either soluble in water (sarcoplasmic proteins, about 11.5 percent of total muscle mass) or in concentrated salt solutions (myofibrillar proteins, about 5.5 percent of mass). There are several hundred sarcoplasmic proteins. Most of them – the glycolytic enzymes – are involved in glycolysis, the conversion of sugars into high-energy molecules, especially adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The two most abundant myofibrillar proteins, myosin and actin, form the muscle&#x27;s overall structure and enable it to deliver power, consuming ATP in the process. The remaining protein mass includes connective tissue (collagen and elastin). Fat in meat can be either adipose tissue, used by the animal to store energy and consisting of &quot;true fats&quot; (esters of glycerol with fatty acids), or intramuscular fat, which contains phospholipids and cholesterol.

Meat can be broadly classified as &quot;red&quot; or &quot;white&quot; depending on the concentration of myoglobin in muscle fiber. When myoglobin is exposed to oxygen, reddish oxymyoglobin develops, making myoglobin-rich meat appear red. The redness of meat depends on species, animal age, and fiber type: Red meat contains more narrow muscle fibers that tend to operate over long periods without rest, while white meat contains more broad fibers that tend to work in short fast bursts, such as the brief flight of the chicken. The meat of adult mammals such as cows, sheep, and horses is considered red, while chicken and turkey breast meat is considered white.

=== Nutritional ===

Muscle tissue is high in protein, containing all of the essential amino acids, and in most cases is a good source of zinc, vitamin B12, selenium, phosphorus, niacin, vitamin B6, choline, riboflavin and iron. Several forms of meat are high in vitamin K. Muscle tissue is very low in carbohydrates and does not contain dietary fiber.

The fat content of meat varies widely with the species and breed of animal, the way in which the animal was raised, what it was fed, the part of the body, and the methods of butchering and cooking. Wild animals such as deer are leaner than farm animals, leading those concerned about fat content to choose game such as venison. Decades of breeding meat animals for fatness is being reversed by consumer demand for leaner meat. The fatty deposits near the muscle fibers in meats soften meat when it is cooked, improve its flavor, and make the meat seem juicier. Fat around meat further contains cholesterol. The increase in meat consumption after 1960 is associated with significant imbalances of fat and cholesterol in the human diet.

== Production ==



=== Transport ===

Upon reaching a predetermined age or weight, livestock are usually transported &quot;en masse&quot; to the slaughterhouse. Depending on its length and circumstances, this may exert stress and injuries on the animals, and some may die &quot;en route&quot;. Unnecessary stress in transport may adversely affect the quality of the meat. In particular, the muscles of stressed animals are low in water and glycogen, and their pH fails to attain acidic values, all of which results in poor meat quality.

=== Slaughter ===

Animals are usually slaughtered by being first stunned and then exsanguinated (bled out). Death results from the one or the other procedure, depending on the methods employed. Stunning can be effected through asphyxiating the animals with carbon dioxide, shooting them with a gun or a captive bolt pistol, or shocking them with electric current. The exsanguination is accomplished by severing the carotid artery and the jugular vein in cattle and sheep, and the anterior vena cava in pigs. Draining as much blood as possible from the carcass is necessary because blood causes the meat to have an unappealing appearance and is a breeding ground for microorganisms.

=== Dressing and cutting ===

After exsanguination, the carcass is dressed; that is, the head, feet, hide (except hogs and some veal), excess fat, viscera and offal are removed, leaving only bones and edible muscle. Cattle and pig carcases, but not those of sheep, are then split in half along the mid ventral axis, and the carcase is cut into wholesale pieces. The dressing and cutting sequence, long a province of manual labor, is being progressively automated.

=== Conditioning ===

Under hygienic conditions and without other treatment, meat can be stored at above its freezing point (−1.5 °C) for about six weeks without spoilage, during which time it undergoes an aging process that increases its tenderness and flavor. During the first day after death, glycolysis continues until the accumulation of lactic acid causes the pH to reach about 5.5. The remaining glycogen, about 18 g per kg, increases the water-holding capacity and tenderness of cooked meat.

&quot;Rigor mortis&quot; sets in a few hours after death as adenosine triphosphate is used up. This causes the muscle proteins actin and myosin to combine into rigid actomyosin. This in turn lowers the meat&#x27;s water-holding capacity, so the meat loses water or &quot;weeps&quot;. In muscles that enter &quot;rigor&quot; in a contracted position, actin and myosin filaments overlap and cross-bond, resulting in meat that becomes tough when cooked. Over time, muscle proteins denature in varying degree, with the exception of the collagen and elastin of connective tissue, and &quot;rigor mortis&quot; resolves. These changes mean that meat is tender and pliable when cooked just after death or after the resolution of &quot;rigor&quot;, but tough when cooked during &quot;rigor.&quot;

As the muscle pigment myoglobin denatures, its iron oxidizes, which may cause a brown discoloration near the surface of the meat. Ongoing proteolysis contributes to conditioning: hypoxanthine, a breakdown product of ATP, contributes to meat&#x27;s flavor and odor, as do other products of the decomposition of muscle fat and protein.

=== Additives ===

When meat is industrially processed, additives are used to protect or modify its flavor or color, to improve its tenderness, juiciness or cohesiveness, or to aid with its preservation.

== Consumption ==

=== Historical ===

A bioarchaeological (specifically, isotopic analysis) study of early medieval England found, based on the funerary record, that high-meat protein diets were extremely rare, and that (contrary to previously held assumptions) elites did not consume more meat than non-elites, and men did not consume more meat than women.

In the nineteenth century, meat consumption in Britain was the highest in Europe, exceeded only by that in British colonies. In the 1830s consumption per head in Britain was about a year, rising to in 1912. In 1904, laborers consumed a year while aristocrats ate . There were some 43,000 butcher&#x27;s shops in Britain in 1910, with &quot;possibly more money invested in the meat industry than in any other British business&quot; except finance. The US was a meat importing country by 1926.

Truncated lifespan as a result of intensive breeding allows more meat to be produced from fewer animals. The world cattle population was about 600 million in 1929, with 700 million sheep and goats and 300 million pigs.

=== Trends ===



According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the overall consumption for white meat has increased from the 20th to the 21st centuries. Poultry meat has increased by 76.6% per kilo per capita and pig meat by 19.7%. Bovine meat has decreased from per capita in 1990 to per capita in 2009. FAO analysis found that 357 million tonnes of meat were produced in 2021, 53% more than in 2000, with chicken meat representing more than half the increase.

Overall, diets that include meat are the most common worldwide according to the results of a 2018 Ipsos MORI study of 16–64 years olds in 28 countries. Ipsos states &quot;An omnivorous diet is the most common diet globally, with non-meat diets (which can include fish) followed by over a tenth of the global population.&quot; Approximately 87% of people include meat in their diet in some frequency. 73% of meat eaters included it in their diet regularly and 14% consumed meat only occasionally or infrequently.

The type of meat consumed varies between different cultures. The amount and kind of meat consumed varies by income, both between countries and within a given country. Horses are commonly eaten in countries such as France, Italy, Germany and Japan. Horses and other large mammals such as reindeer were hunted during the late Paleolithic in western Europe. Dogs are consumed in China, South Korea and Vietnam. Dogs are occasionally eaten in the Arctic regions. Historically, dog meat has been consumed in various parts of the world, such as Hawaii, Japan, Switzerland and Mexico. Cats are sometimes eaten, such as in Peru. Guinea pigs are raised for their flesh in the Andes. Whales and dolphins are hunted, partly for their flesh, in several countries. Misidentification is a risk; in 2013, products in Europe labelled as beef actually contained horse meat.

=== Methods of preparation ===

Meat can be cooked in many ways, including braising, broiling, frying, grilling, and roasting. Meat can be cured by smoking, which preserves and flavors food by exposing it to smoke from burning or smoldering wood. Other methods of curing include pickling, salting, and air-drying. Some recipes call for raw meat; steak tartare is made from minced raw beef. Pâtés are made with ground meat and fat, often including liver.

== Health effects ==

Meat, in particular red and processed meat, is linked to a variety of health risks. The &quot;2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans&quot; asked men and teenage boys to increase their consumption of vegetables or other underconsumed foods (fruits, whole grains, and dairy) while reducing intake of protein foods (meats, poultry, and eggs) that they currently overconsume.

=== Contamination ===

Toxic compounds including heavy metals, mycotoxins, pesticide residues, dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyl can contaminate meat. Processed, smoked and cooked meat may contain carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Toxins may be introduced to meat as part of animal feed, as veterinary drug residues, or during processing and cooking. Such compounds are often metabolized in the body to form harmful by-products. Negative effects depend on the individual genome, diet, and history of the consumer.

=== Cancer ===

The consumption of processed and red meat carries an increased risk of cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a specialized agency of the World Health Organization (WHO), classified processed meat (e.g., bacon, ham, hot dogs, sausages) as, &quot;carcinogenic to humans (Group 1), based on sufficient evidence in humans that the consumption of processed meat causes colorectal cancer.&quot; IARC classified red meat as &quot;probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A), based on limited evidence that the consumption of red meat causes cancer in humans and strong mechanistic evidence supporting a carcinogenic effect.&quot;

Cancer Research UK, National Health Service (NHS) and the National Cancer Institute have stated that red and processed meat intake increases risk of bowel cancer. The American Cancer Society in their &quot;Diet and Physical Activity Guideline&quot;, stated &quot;evidence that red and processed meats increase cancer risk has existed for decades, and many health organizations recommend limiting or avoiding these foods.&quot; The Canadian Cancer Society have stated that &quot;eating red and processed meat increases cancer risk&quot;.

A 2021 review found an increase of 11–51% risk of multiple cancer per 100g/d increment of red meat, and an increase of 8–72% risk of multiple cancer per 50g/d increment of processed meat.

Cooking muscle meat creates heterocyclic amines (HCAs), which are thought to increase cancer risk in humans. Researchers at the National Cancer Institute published results of a study which found that human subjects who ate beef rare or medium-rare had less than one third the risk of stomach cancer than those who ate beef medium-well or well-done. While eating muscle meat raw may be the only way to avoid HCAs fully, the National Cancer Institute states that cooking meat below creates &quot;negligible amounts&quot; of HCAs. Microwaving meat before cooking may reduce HCAs by 90%. Nitrosamines, present in processed and cooked foods, are carcinogenic, being linked to colon cancer. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, present in processed, smoked and cooked foods, are similarly carcinogenic.

=== Bacterial contamination ===

Bacterial contamination has been seen with meat products. A 2011 study by the Translational Genomics Research Institute showed that nearly half (47%) of the meat and poultry in U.S. grocery stores were contaminated with &quot;S. aureus&quot;, with more than half (52%) of those bacteria resistant to antibiotics. A 2018 investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and &quot;The Guardian&quot; found that around 15 percent of the US population suffers from foodborne illnesses every year. The investigation highlighted unsanitary conditions in US-based meat plants, which included meat products covered in excrement and abscesses &quot;filled with pus&quot;.

Complete cooking and the careful avoidance of recontamination reduce the risk of bacterial infections from meat.

=== Diabetes ===

Consumption of 100 g/day of red meat and 50 g/day of processed meat is associated with an increased risk of diabetes.

Diabetes UK advises people to limit their intake of red and processed meat.

=== Infectious diseases ===

Meat production and trade substantially increase risks for infectious diseases (zoonosis), including of pandemics, whether though contact with wild and farmed animals, or via husbandry&#x27;s environmental impact.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/j.foodres.2020.109341&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For example, avian influenza from poultry meat production is a threat to human health. Furthermore, the use of antibiotics in meat production contributes to antimicrobial resistance – which contributes to millions of deaths – and makes it harder to control infectious diseases.

=== Changes in consumer behavior ===

In response to changing meat prices as well as health concerns about saturated fat and cholesterol, consumers have altered their consumption of various meats. Consumption of beef in the United States between 1970 and 1974 and 1990–1994 dropped by 21%, while consumption of chicken increased by 90%.

=== Heart disease ===

Except for poultry, at 50 g/day unprocessed red and processed meat are risk factors for ischemic heart disease, increasing the risk by about 9 and 18% respectively.

== Environmental impact ==

A multitude of serious negative environmental effects are associated with meat production. Among these are greenhouse gas emissions, fossil energy use, water use, water quality changes, and effects on grazed ecosystems. They are so significant that according to University of Oxford researchers, &quot;a vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth... far bigger than cutting down on your flights or buying an electric car&quot;. However, this is often ignored in the public consciousness and in plans to tackle serious environmental issues such as the climate crisis.

The livestock sector may be the largest source of water pollution (due to animal wastes, fertilizers, pesticides), and it contributes to emergence of antibiotic resistance. It accounts for over 8% of global human water use. It is a significant driver of biodiversity loss and ecosystems, as it causes deforestation, ocean dead zones, species extinction, land degradation, pollution, overfishing and global warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/s43016-021-00358-x&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Cattle farming was estimated to be responsible for 80 per cent of Amazon deforestation in 2008 due to the clearing of forests to grow animal feed (especially soya) and cattle ranching.

Environmental effects vary among livestock production systems. Grazing of livestock can be beneficial for some wildlife species, but not for others. Targeted grazing of livestock is used as a food-producing alternative to herbicide use in some vegetation management.

=== Land use ===

Meat production is by far the biggest user of land, as it accounts for nearly 40% of the global land surface. Just in the contiguous United States, 34% of its land area () are used as pasture and rangeland, mostly feeding livestock, not counting of cropland (20%), some of which is used for producing feed for livestock. Roughly 75% of deforested land around the globe is used for livestock pasture. Deforestation from practices like slash-and-burn releases and removes the carbon sink of grown tropical forest ecosystems which substantially mitigate climate change. Land use is a major pressure on pressure on fertile soils which is important for global food security.

=== Climate change ===

The rising global consumption of carbon-intensive meat products has &quot;exploded the global carbon footprint of agriculture,&quot; according to some top scientists. Meat production is responsible for some 35% of global emissions of greenhouse gases, and 60% of the greenhouse gases attributable to food production.

Some nations show very different impacts to counterparts within the same group, with Brazil and Australia having emissions over 200% higher than the average of their respective income groups, driven by meat consumption.

According to the &quot;Assessing the Environmental Impacts of Consumption and Production&quot; report produced by United Nations Environment Programme&#x27;s (UNEP) international panel for sustainable resource management, a worldwide transition in the direction of a meat and dairy free diet is indispensable if adverse global climate change were to be prevented. A 2019 report in &quot;The Lancet&quot; recommended that global meat (and sugar) consumption be reduced by 50 percent to mitigate climate change. Meat consumption in Western societies needs to be reduced by up to 90% according to a 2018 study published in &quot;Nature&quot;. The 2019 special report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change called for significantly reducing meat consumption, particularly in wealthy countries, in order to mitigate and adapt to climate change.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/d41586-019-02409-7&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biodiversity loss ===

Meat consumption is a primary contributor to the sixth mass extinction. A 2017 study by the World Wildlife Fund found that 60% of global biodiversity loss is attributable to meat-based diets, in particular from the use of land for feed crops, resulting in large-scale loss of habitats and species. Livestock make up 60% of the biomass of all mammals on earth, followed by humans (36%) and wild mammals (4%). In November 2017, 15,364 world scientists signed a Warning to Humanity calling for a drastic reduction in per capita consumption of meat and &quot;dietary shifts towards mostly plant-based foods&quot;. The 2019 &quot;Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services&quot; recommended a reduction in meat consumption to mitigate biodiversity loss. A 2021 Chatham House report asserted that a shift towards plant-based diets would free up land for the restoration of ecosystems and biodiversity.

Meat consumption is predicted to rise as the human population increases and becomes more affluent; this in turn would increase greenhouse gas emissions and further reduce biodiversity.

=== Reducing environmental impact ===

The environmental impact of meat production can be reduced on the farm by conversion of human-inedible residues of food crops. Manure from meat-producing livestock is used as fertilizer. Substitution of animal manures for synthetic fertilizers in crop production can be environmentally significant, as between 43 and 88 MJ of fossil fuel energy are used per kg of nitrogen in manufacture of synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers.

=== Reducing meat consumption ===

The IPCC and others have stated that meat production has to be reduced substantially for any sufficient mitigation of climate change and, at least initially, largely through shifts towards plant-based diets where meat consumption is high.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/s43016-021-00431-5&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Personal carbon allowances that allow a certain amount of free meat consumption per person would be a form of restriction, meat taxes would be a type of fiscal mechanism. Meat can be replaced by, for example, high-protein iron-rich low-emission legumes and common fungi, dietary supplements (e.g. of vitamin B12) and fortified foods, cultured meat, microbial foods, mycoprotein, meat substitutes, and other alternatives, such as those based on mushrooms, legumes (pulses), and other food sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/j.appet.2020.105058&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Land previously used for meat production can be rewilded. The biologists Rodolfo Dirzo, Gerardo Ceballos, and Paul R. Ehrlich state that it is the &quot;massive planetary monopoly of industrial meat production that needs to be curbed&quot; while respecting the cultural traditions of indigenous peoples, for whom meat is an important source of protein.

== Cultural aspects ==

Meat is part of the human diet in most cultures, where it often has symbolic meaning and important social functions. Some people choose not to eat meat (vegetarianism) or any food made from animals (veganism). The reasons for not eating all or some meat may include ethical objections to killing animals for food, health concerns, environmental concerns or religious dietary laws.

=== Ethical issues ===

Ethical issues regarding the consumption of meat include objecting to the act of killing animals or to the agricultural practices used in meat production. Reasons for objecting to killing animals for consumption may include animal rights, environmental ethics, or an aversion to inflicting pain or harm on sentient animals. Some people, while not vegetarians, refuse to eat the flesh of certain animals for cultural or religious reasons.

The founders of Western philosophy disagreed about the ethics of eating meat. Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; has Socrates describe the ideal state as vegetarian. Pythagoras believed that humans and animals were equal and therefore disapproved of meat consumption, as did Plutarch, whereas Zeno and Epicurus were vegetarian but allowed meat-eating in their philosophy. Conversely, Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Politics&quot; assert that animals, as inferior beings, exist to serve humans, including as food. Augustine drew on Aristotle to argue that the universe&#x27;s natural hierarchy allows humans to eat animals, and animals to eat plants. Enlightenment philosophers were likewise divided. Descartes wrote that animals were merely animated machines, while Kant considered them inferior beings for lack of discernment: means rather than ends. But Voltaire and Rousseau disagreed; Rousseau argued that meat-eating is a social rather than a natural act, because children are not interested in meat.

Later philosophers examined the changing practices of eating meat in the modern age as part of a process of detachment from animals as living beings. Norbert Elias, for instance, noted that in medieval times cooked animals were brought to the table whole, but that since the Renaissance only the edible parts are served, which are no longer recognizably part of an animal. Modern eaters, according to Noëlie Vialles, demand an &quot;ellipsis&quot; between meat and dead animals. Fernand Braudel wrote that since the European diet of the 15th and 16th century was particularly heavy in meat, European colonialism helped export meat-eating across the globe, as colonized peoples took up the culinary habits of their colonizers.

=== Religious traditions ===

Among the Indian religions, Jainism opposes the eating of meat, while some schools of Buddhism and Hinduism advocate but do not mandate vegetarianism. Some Sikh groups oppose eating any meat. Jewish &quot;Kashrut&quot; dietary rules allow certain (&quot;kosher&quot;) meat and forbid other (&quot;treif&quot;) meat. Similar rules apply in Islamic dietary laws: The Quran explicitly forbids meat from animals that die naturally, blood, and the meat of pigs, which are &quot;haram&quot;, forbidden, as opposed to &quot;halal&quot;, allowed.

===Psychology===

Research in applied psychology has investigated meat eating in relation to morality, emotions, cognition, and personality. Psychological research suggests meat eating is correlated with masculinity, and reduced openness to experience. Research into the consumer psychology of meat is relevant both to meat industry marketing and to those advocating eating less meat.

=== Gender ===

Unlike most other foods, meat is not perceived as gender-neutral; it is associated with men and masculinity. Sociological research, ranging from African tribal societies to contemporary barbecue, indicates that men are much more likely to participate in preparing meat than other food. This has been attributed to the influence of traditional male gender roles, in view of what Jack Goody calls a &quot;male familiarity with killing&quot;, or as Claude Lévi-Strauss suggests, that roasting (meat) is more violent than boiling (grains and vegetables). In modern societies, men tend to consume more meat than women, and men often prefer red meat whereas women tend to prefer chicken and fish.

<doc id="18942" wikidata="Q16402" url="?curid=18942" title="Monty Python">
<text>Monty Python (also collectively known as the Pythons) were a British comedy troupe formed in 1969 consisting of Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin. The group came to prominence for the sketch comedy series &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, which aired on the BBC from 1969 to 1974. Their work then developed into a larger collection that included live shows, films, albums, books, and musicals; their influence on comedy has been compared to the Beatles&#x27; influence on music. Their sketch show has been called &quot;an important moment in the evolution of television comedy&quot;.

&quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; was loosely structured as a sketch show, but its innovative stream-of-consciousness approach and Gilliam&#x27;s animation skills pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable in style and content. A self-contained comedy unit, the Pythons had creative control that allowed them to experiment with form and content, discarding rules of television comedy. They followed their television work by making the films &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; (1975), &quot;Life of Brian&quot; (1979), and &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; (1983). Their influence on British comedy has been apparent for years, while it has coloured the work of the early editions of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; through to absurdist trends in television comedy.

At the 41st British Academy Film Awards in 1988, Monty Python received the BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema. In 1998, they were awarded the AFI Star Award by the American Film Institute. &quot;Holy Grail&quot; and &quot;Life of Brian&quot; are frequently ranked on lists of the greatest comedy films. A 2005 poll asked more than 300 comedians, comedy writers, producers, and directors to name the greatest comedians of all time, and half of Monty Python&#x27;s members made the top 50.

==History==
===Before &quot;Flying Circus&quot;===
Jones and Palin met at Oxford University, where they performed together with the Oxford Revue. Chapman and Cleese met at Cambridge University. Idle was also at Cambridge, but started a year after Chapman and Cleese. Cleese met Gilliam in New York City while on tour with the Cambridge University Footlights revue &quot;Cambridge Circus&quot; (originally entitled &quot;A Clump of Plinths&quot;). Chapman, Cleese, and Idle were members of the Footlights, which at that time also included the future Goodies (Tim Brooke-Taylor, Bill Oddie, and Graeme Garden), and Jonathan Lynn (co-writer of &quot;Yes Minister&quot; and &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;). During Idle&#x27;s presidency of the club, feminist writer Germaine Greer and broadcaster Clive James were members. Recordings of Footlights&#x27; revues (called &quot;Smokers&quot;) at Pembroke College include sketches and performances by Cleese and Idle, which, along with tapes of Idle&#x27;s performances in some of the drama society&#x27;s theatrical productions, are kept in the archives of the Pembroke Players.

The six Python members appeared in or wrote these shows before &quot;Flying Circus&quot;:
* &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;ll Read That Again&quot; (radio) (1964–1973): Cleese (cast member and writer), Idle and Chapman (writers)
* &quot;The Frost Report&quot; (1966–1967): Cleese (cast member and writer), Idle (writer of David Frost&#x27;s monologues), Chapman, Palin and Jones (writers)
* &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot; (1967): Chapman and Cleese (writers and cast members), Idle (guest star and writer)
* &quot;Twice a Fortnight&quot; (1967): Palin and Jones (cast members and writers)
* &quot;Do Not Adjust Your Set&quot; (1967–1969): Idle, Jones, and Palin (cast members and writers), Gilliam (animation) 
* &quot;We Have Ways of Making You Laugh&quot; (1968): Idle (cast member and writer), Gilliam (animation)
* &quot;How to Irritate People&quot; (1968): Cleese and Chapman (cast members and writers), Palin (cast member)
* &quot;The Complete and Utter History of Britain&quot; (1969): Palin and Jones (cast members and writers)
* &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; (1969), Cleese and Chapman (writers)

The BBC&#x27;s satirical television show &quot;The Frost Report&quot;, broadcast from March 1966 to December 1967, is credited as first uniting the British Pythons and providing an environment in which they could develop their particular styles.
Following the success of &quot;Do Not Adjust Your Set&quot; (which was broadcast on ITV from December 1967 to May 1969), Thames Television offered Gilliam, Idle, Jones, and Palin their own late-night adult comedy series together. At the same time, Chapman and Cleese were offered a show by the BBC, which had been impressed by their work on &quot;The Frost Report&quot; and &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot;. Cleese was reluctant to do a two-man show for various reasons, including Chapman&#x27;s supposedly difficult and erratic personality. Cleese had fond memories of working with Palin on &quot;How to Irritate People&quot; and invited him to join the team. With no studio available at Thames until summer 1970 for the late-night show, Palin agreed to join Cleese and Chapman, and suggested the involvement of his writing partner Jones and colleague Idle—who in turn wanted Gilliam to provide animations for the projected series. Much has been made of the fact that the Monty Python troupe is the result of Cleese&#x27;s desire to work with Palin and the chance circumstances that brought the other four members into the fold.

By contrast, according to John Cleese&#x27;s autobiography, the origins of &quot;Monty Python&quot; lay in the admiration that writing partners Cleese and Chapman had for the new type of comedy being done on &quot;Do Not Adjust Your Set&quot;; as a result, a meeting was initiated by Cleese between Chapman, Idle, Jones, Palin, and himself at which it was agreed to pool their writing and performing efforts and jointly seek production sponsorship. According to their official website, the group was born from a Kashmir tandoori restaurant in Hampstead on 11 May 1969, following a taping of &quot;Do Not Adjust Your Set&quot; which Cleese and Chapman attended. It was the first time all six got together, reportedly going back to Cleese&#x27;s apartment on nearby Basil Street afterwards to continue discussions.

===&quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;===
====Development of the series====
According to show director Ian MacNaughton, the first discussion over the idea for the show, &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, was a result of BBC&#x27;s comedy advisor, Barry Took, bringing the Pythons along with John Howard Davies (director of the first four episodes) and MacNaughton together into one conference room at the BBC Television Centre. The Pythons had a definite idea about what they wanted to do with the series. They were admirers of the work of Peter Cook, Alan Bennett, Jonathan Miller, and Dudley Moore on &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot;—seminal to the British &quot;satire boom&quot;—and had worked on &quot;Frost&quot;, which was similar in style.
They enjoyed Cook and Moore&#x27;s sketch show &quot;Not Only... But Also&quot;. One problem the Pythons perceived with these programmes was that though the body of the sketch would be strong, the writers would often struggle to then find a punchline funny enough to end on, and this would detract from the overall sketch quality. They decided that they would simply not bother to &quot;cap&quot; their sketches in the traditional manner, and early episodes of the &quot;Flying Circus&quot; series make great play of this abandonment of the punchline (one scene has Cleese turn to Idle, as the sketch descends into chaos, and remark that &quot;This is the silliest sketch I&#x27;ve ever been in&quot;—they all resolve not to carry on and simply walk off the set). However, as they began assembling material for the show, the Pythons watched one of their collective heroes, Spike Milligan, whom they had admired on &quot;The Goon Show&quot; (a show the Pythons regard as their biggest influence, which also featured Peter Sellers, whom Cleese called &quot;the greatest voice man of all time&quot;) recording his groundbreaking BBC series &quot;Q...&quot; (1969). Not only was &quot;Q...&quot; more irreverent and anarchic than any previous television comedy, but Milligan also would often &quot;give up&quot; on sketches halfway through and wander off set (often muttering &quot;Did I write this?&quot;). It was clear that their new series would now seem less original, and Jones in particular became determined the Pythons should innovate. Michael Palin recalls &quot;Terry Jones and I adored the &quot;Q...&quot; shows...[Milligan] was the first writer to play with the conventions of television.&quot; Charles Isherwood writes that the Pythons &quot;derived their sketch formats in part from the rowdy tradition of the music hall.&quot;
After much debate, Jones remembered an animation Gilliam had created for &quot;Do Not Adjust Your Set&quot; called &quot;Beware of the Elephants&quot;, which had intrigued him with its stream-of-consciousness style. Jones felt it would be a good concept to apply to the series: allowing sketches to blend into one another. Palin had been equally fascinated by another of Gilliam&#x27;s efforts, entitled &quot;Christmas Cards&quot;, and agreed that it represented &quot;a way of doing things differently&quot;. Since Cleese, Chapman, and Idle were less concerned with the overall flow of the programme, Jones, Palin, and Gilliam became largely responsible for the presentation style of the &quot;Flying Circus&quot; series, in which disparate sketches are linked to give each episode the appearance of a single stream-of-consciousness (often using a Gilliam animation to move from the closing image of one sketch to the opening scene of another). The BBC states, &quot;Gilliam&#x27;s unique animation style became crucial, segueing seamlessly between any two completely unrelated ideas and making the stream-of-consciousness work.&quot;

Writing started at 9:00AM and finished at 5:00PM. Typically, Cleese and Chapman worked as one pair isolated from the others, as did Jones and Palin, while Idle wrote alone. After a few days, they would join with Gilliam, critique their scripts, and exchange ideas. Their approach to writing was democratic. If the majority found an idea humorous, it was included in the show. The casting of roles for the sketches was a similarly unselfish process, since each member viewed himself primarily as a &quot;writer&quot;, rather than an actor eager for screen time. When the themes for sketches were chosen, Gilliam had a free hand in bridging them with animations, using a camera, scissors, and airbrush.
While the show was a collaborative process, different factions within Python were responsible for elements of the team&#x27;s humour. In general, the work of the Oxford-educated members (Jones and Palin) was more visual, and more fanciful conceptually (e.g., the arrival of the Spanish Inquisition in a suburban front room), while the Cambridge graduates&#x27; sketches tended to be more verbal and more aggressive (for example, Cleese and Chapman&#x27;s many &quot;confrontation&quot; sketches, where one character intimidates or hurls abuse, or Idle&#x27;s characters with bizarre verbal quirks, such as &quot;The Man Who Speaks In Anagrams&quot;). Cleese confirmed that &quot;most of the sketches with heavy abuse were Graham&#x27;s and mine, anything that started with a slow pan across countryside and impressive music was Mike and Terry&#x27;s, and anything that got utterly involved with words and disappeared up any personal orifice was Eric&#x27;s&quot;. Gilliam&#x27;s animations ranged from the whimsical to the savage (the cartoon format allowing him to create some astonishingly violent scenes without fear of censorship).

Several names for the show were considered before &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; was settled upon. Some were &quot;Owl Stretching Time&quot;, &quot;The Toad Elevating Moment&quot;, &quot;A Horse, a Spoon and a Basin&quot;, &quot;Vaseline Review&quot;, and &quot;Bun, Wackett, Buzzard, Stubble and Boot&quot;. Reportedly, these names were considered for the show because the group members found it funny that the show name would have nothing to do with the actual content of the series. &quot;Flying Circus&quot; stuck when the BBC explained it had printed that name in its schedules and was not prepared to amend it. &quot;Gwen Dibley&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; was named after a woman Palin had read about in the newspaper, thinking it would be amusing if she were to discover she had her own TV show. &quot;Baron Von Took&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; was considered as an affectionate tribute to Barry Took, the man who had brought them together. &quot;Arthur Megapode&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; was suggested, then discarded. The name &quot;Baron Von Took&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; had the form of &quot;Baron Manfred von Richthofen&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; of WWI fame, and the new group was forming in a time when the Royal Guardsmen&#x27;s 1966 song &quot;Snoopy vs. the Red Baron&quot; had peaked. The term &#x27;flying circus&#x27; was also another name for the popular entertainment of the 1920s known as barnstorming, where multiple performers collaborated with their stunts to perform a combined set of acts.

Differing, somewhat confusing accounts are given of the origins of the Python name, although the members agree that its only &quot;significance&quot; was that they thought it sounded funny. In the 1998 documentary &quot;Live at Aspen&quot; during the US Comedy Arts Festival, where the troupe was awarded the AFI Star Award by the American Film Institute, the group implied that &quot;Monty&quot; was selected (Eric Idle&#x27;s idea) as a gently mocking tribute to Field Marshal Lord Montgomery, a British general of World War II; requiring a &quot;slippery-sounding&quot; surname, they settled on &quot;Python&quot;. On other occasions, Idle has claimed that the name &quot;Monty&quot; was that of a popular and rotund fellow who drank in his local pub; people would often walk in and ask the barman, &quot;Has Monty been in yet?&quot;, forcing the name to become stuck in his mind. The name Monty Python was later described by the BBC as being &quot;envisaged by the team as the perfect name for a sleazy entertainment agent&quot;.

====Style of the show====
&quot;Flying Circus&quot; popularised innovative formal techniques, such as the cold open, in which an episode began without the traditional opening titles or announcements. An example of this is the &quot;It&#x27;s&quot; man: Palin, outfitted in Robinson Crusoe garb, making a tortuous journey across various terrains, before finally approaching the camera to state, &quot;It&#x27;s ...&quot;, to be then interrupted by the title sequence and theme music. On several occasions, the cold open lasted until mid-show, after which the regular opening titles ran. Occasionally, the Pythons tricked viewers by rolling the closing credits halfway through the show, usually continuing the joke by fading to the familiar globe logo used for BBC continuity, over which Cleese would parody the clipped tones of a BBC announcer. On one occasion, the credits ran directly after the opening titles. On the subversive nature of the show (and their subsequent films), Cleese states &quot;anti-authoritarianism was deeply ingrained in Python&quot;.
Because of their dislike of finishing with punchlines, they experimented with ending the sketches by cutting abruptly to another scene or animation, walking offstage, addressing the camera (breaking the fourth wall), or introducing a totally unrelated event or character. A classic example of this approach was the use of Chapman&#x27;s &quot;anti-silliness&quot; character of &quot;the Colonel&quot;, who walked into several sketches and ordered them to be stopped because things were becoming &quot;far too silly&quot;.

Another favourite way of ending sketches was to drop a cartoonish &quot;16-ton weight&quot; prop on one of the characters when the sketch seemed to be losing momentum, or a knight in full armour (played by Terry Gilliam) would wander on-set and hit characters over the head with a rubber chicken, before cutting to the next scene. Yet another way of changing scenes was when John Cleese, usually outfitted in a dinner suit, would come in as a radio commentator and, in a rather pompous manner, make the formal and determined announcement &quot;And now for something completely different.&quot;, which later became the title of the first Monty Python film.

The Python theme music is the Band of the Grenadier Guards&#x27; rendition of John Philip Sousa&#x27;s &quot;The Liberty Bell&quot; which was first published in 1893. Under the Berne Convention&#x27;s &quot;country of origin&quot; concept, the composition was subject to United States copyright law which states that any work first published prior to 1924 was in the public domain, owing to copyright expiration. This enabled Gilliam to co-opt the march for the series without having to make any royalty payments.
The use of Gilliam&#x27;s surreal, collage stop motion animations was another innovative intertextual element of the Python style. Many of the images Gilliam used were lifted from famous works of art, and from Victorian illustrations and engravings. The giant foot that crushes the show&#x27;s title at the end of the opening credits is the foot of Cupid, cut from a reproduction of the Renaissance masterpiece &quot;Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time&quot; by Bronzino. This foot, and Gilliam&#x27;s style in general, are visual trademarks of the programme.

The Pythons used the British tradition of cross-dressing comedy by donning frocks and makeup and playing female roles themselves while speaking in falsetto. Jones specialised in playing the working-class housewife, or &quot;ratbag old women&quot; as termed by the BBC. Palin and Idle generally played the role more posh, with Idle playing more feminine women. Cleese played female roles more sparsely, while Chapman was frequently paired with Jones as a ratbag woman or with Idle portraying middle-class women commenting upon TV. Generally speaking, female roles were played by women only when the scene specifically required that the character be sexually attractive (although sometimes they used Idle for this). The troupe later turned to Carol Cleveland—often described as the unofficial seventh member—who co-starred in numerous episodes after 1970. In some episodes, and later in the stoning scene in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot;, they took the idea one step further by playing women who impersonated men.

Many sketches are well-known and widely quoted. &quot;Dead Parrot sketch&quot;, &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot;, &quot;Spam&quot; (which led to the coining of the term email spam), &quot;Nudge Nudge&quot;, &quot;The Spanish Inquisition&quot;, &quot;Upper Class Twit of the Year&quot;, &quot;Cheese Shop&quot;, &quot;The Ministry of Silly Walks&quot;, &quot;Argument Clinic&quot;, &quot;The Funniest Joke in the World&quot; (a sketch referenced in Google Translate), and &quot;Four Yorkshiremen&quot; are just a few examples. Most of the show&#x27;s sketches satirise areas of public life, such as: Dead Parrot (poor customer service), Silly Walks (bureaucratic inefficiency), Spam (ubiquity of Spam post World War II), and Four Yorkshiremen (nostalgic conversations). Featuring regularly in skits, Gumbys (characters of limited intelligence and vocabulary) were part of the Pythons&#x27; satirical view of television of the 1970s which condescendingly encouraged more involvement from the &quot;man on the street&quot;.

====Introduction to North America and the world====
The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) added &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; to its national September 1970 fall line-up. They aired the 13 episodes of series 1, which had first run on the BBC the previous autumn (October 1969 to January 1970), as well as the first six episodes of series 2 only a few weeks after they first appeared on the BBC (September to November 1970). The CBC dropped the show when it returned to regular programming after the Christmas 1970 break, choosing to not place the remaining seven episodes of series 2 on the January 1971 CBC schedule. Within a week, the CBC received hundreds of calls complaining of the cancellation, and more than 100 people staged a demonstration at the CBC&#x27;s Montreal studios. The show eventually returned, becoming a fixture on the network during the first half of the 1970s.
Sketches from &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; were introduced to American audiences in August 1972, with the release of the Python film &quot;And Now for Something Completely Different&quot;, featuring sketches from series 1 and 2 of the television show. This 1972 release met with limited box office success.

The ability to show &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; under the American NTSC standard had been made possible by the commercial actions of American television producer Greg Garrison. Garrison produced the NBC series &quot;The Dean Martin Comedy World&quot;, which ran during the summer of 1974. The concept was to show clips from comedy shows produced in other countries, including tape of the Python sketches &quot;Bicycle Repairman&quot; and &quot;The Dull Life of a Stockbroker&quot;.
Through the efforts of Python&#x27;s American manager Nancy Lewis, during the summer of 1974, Ron Devillier, the programming director for nonprofit PBS television station KERA in Dallas, Texas, started airing episodes of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;. Ratings shot through the roof, prompting other PBS affiliates to pick up the show. Devillier states, &quot;We got the Nielsens in and started looking at the Saturday ratings. The first night, it was a 6 rating. We couldn&#x27;t believe it. We didn&#x27;t know what a 6 looked like. The next week, it was a 7 and it may have taken a month but it stayed there and we started getting 8s, 9s and 10s.&quot; There was also cross-promotion from FM radio stations across the US, whose airing of tracks from the Python LPs had already introduced American audiences to this bizarre brand of comedy. The popularity on PBS resulted in the 1974 re-release of the 1972 &quot;...Completely Different&quot; film, with much greater box office success. The success of the show was captured by a March 1975 article headline in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus Is Barnstorming Here&quot;. Asked what challenges were left, now that they had made TV shows, films, written books, and produced records, Chapman responded, &quot;Well, actually world supremacy would be very nice&quot;, before Idle cautioned, &quot;Yes, but that sort of thing has got to be done properly&quot;.

In 1975 ABC broadcast two 90-minute &quot;Monty Python&quot; specials, each with three shows, but cut out a total of 24 minutes from each, in part to make time for commercials, and in part to avoid upsetting their audience. As the judge observed in &quot;Gilliam v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.&quot;, where Monty Python sued for damages caused by broadcast of the mutilated version, &quot;According to the network, appellants should have anticipated that most of the excised material contained scatological references inappropriate for American television and that these scenes would be replaced with commercials, which presumably are more palatable to the American public.&quot; Monty Python won the case.

With the popularity of Python throughout the rest of the 1970s and through most of the 1980s, PBS stations looked at other British comedies, leading to UK shows such as &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; gaining a US audience, and leading, over time, to many PBS stations having a &quot;British Comedy Night&quot; which airs many popular UK comedies.

In 1976, Monty Python became the top rated show in Japan. The popularity of the show in the Netherlands saw the town of Spijkenisse near Rotterdam open a &#x27;silly walks&#x27; road crossing in 2018. Believed to be a world first, the official sign asks pedestrians to cross the road in a comical manner.

====Departure of Cleese====
Having considered the possibility at the end of the second series, Cleese left the &quot;Flying Circus&quot; at the end of the third. He later explained that he felt he no longer had anything fresh to offer the show, and claimed that only two sketches penned by Cleese and Chapman in the third series (&quot;Dennis Moore&quot; and the &quot;Cheese Shop&quot;) were truly original, and that the others were bits and pieces from previous work cobbled together in slightly different contexts. He was also finding Chapman, who was at that point in the full throes of alcoholism, difficult to work with. According to an interview with Idle, &quot;It was on an Air Canada flight on the way to Toronto, when John (Cleese) turned to all of us and said &#x27;I want out.&#x27; Why? I don&#x27;t know. He gets bored more easily than the rest of us. He&#x27;s a difficult man, not easy to be friendly with. He&#x27;s so funny because he never wanted to be liked. That gives him a certain fascinating, arrogant freedom.&quot; In 2012, Jones spoke on Cleese&#x27;s work in the third series and subsequent departure, &quot;He was good at it, when he did it he was professional, but he&#x27;d rather not have done it. The others all loved it, but he got more and more pissed off about having to come out and do filming, and the one that really swung it, in my view, was when we had to do the day on the Newhaven lifeboat.&quot;

The rest of the group carried on for one more &quot;half&quot; season before calling a halt to the programme in 1974. While the first three seasons contained 13 episodes each, the fourth ended after just six. The name &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; appears in the opening animation for season four, but in the end credits, the show is listed as simply &quot;Monty Python&quot;. Although Cleese left the show, he was credited as a writer for three of the six episodes, largely concentrated in the &quot;Michael Ellis&quot; episode, which had begun life as one of the many drafts of the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; motion picture. When a new direction for &quot;Grail&quot; was decided upon, the subplot of Arthur and his knights wandering around a strange department store in modern times was lifted out and recycled as the aforementioned TV episode. Songwriter Neil Innes contributed to some sketches, including &quot;Appeal on Behalf of Very Rich People&quot;.

==Life beyond the &quot;Flying Circus&quot;==

===Filmography===

====&quot;And Now for Something Completely Different&quot; (1971)====

The Pythons&#x27; first feature film was directed by Ian MacNaughton, reprising his role from the television series. It consisted of sketches from the first two seasons of the &quot;Flying Circus&quot;, reshot on a low budget (and often slightly edited) for cinema release. Material selected for the film includes: &quot;Dead Parrot&quot;, &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot;, &quot;Upper Class Twit of the Year&quot;, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Grannies&quot;, &quot;Self-Defence Class&quot;, &quot;How Not to Be Seen&quot;, and &quot;Nudge Nudge&quot;. Financed by &quot;Playboy&quot;″s UK executive Victor Lownes, it was intended as a way of breaking Monty Python into America, and although it was ultimately unsuccessful in this, the film did good business in the UK, and later in the US on the &quot;Midnight movie&quot; circuit after their breakthrough television and film success, this being in the era before home video would make the original material much more accessible. The group did not consider the film a success.

====&quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; (1975)====

In 1974, between production on the third and fourth series, the group decided to embark on their first &quot;proper&quot; feature film, containing entirely new material. &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; was based on Arthurian legend and was directed by Jones and Gilliam. Again, the latter also contributed linking animations (and put together the opening credits). Along with the rest of the Pythons, Jones and Gilliam performed several roles in the film, but Chapman took the lead as King Arthur. Cleese returned to the group for the film, feeling that they were once again breaking new ground. &quot;Holy Grail&quot; was filmed on location, in picturesque rural areas of Scotland, with a budget of only £229,000; the money was raised in part with investments from rock groups such as Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, and Led Zeppelin, as well as UK music industry entrepreneur Tony Stratton Smith (founder and owner of the Charisma Records label, for which the Pythons recorded their comedy albums).

The backers of the film wanted to cut the famous Black Knight scene (a Sam Peckinpah send-up in which the Black Knight loses his limbs in a duel), but it was eventually kept in the film. &quot;Tis but a scratch&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s just a flesh wound…&quot; are often quoted. &quot;Holy Grail&quot; was selected as the second-best comedy of all time in the ABC special &quot;Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time&quot;. and viewers in a Channel 4 poll placed it sixth.

====&quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot; (1979)====

Following the success of &quot;Holy Grail&quot;, reporters asked for the title of the next Python film, though the team had not even begun to consider a third one. Eventually, Idle flippantly replied &quot;Jesus Christ – Lust for Glory&quot;, which became the group&#x27;s stock answer to such questions. However, they soon began to seriously consider a film lampooning the New Testament era in the same way &quot;Holy Grail&quot; had lampooned Arthurian legend. Despite sharing a distrust of organised religion, they agreed not to mock Jesus or his teachings directly. They also mentioned that they could not think of anything legitimate to make fun of about him. Instead, they decided to write a satire on credulity and hypocrisy among the followers of someone [Brian] who had been mistaken for the &quot;Messiah&quot;, but who had no desire to be followed as such. Terry Jones adds it was a satire on those who for the next 2,000 years &quot;couldn&#x27;t agree on what Jesus was saying about peace and love&quot;.
The focus therefore shifted to a separate individual, Brian Cohen, born at the same time, and in a neighbouring stable. When Jesus appears in the film (first, as a baby in the stable, and then later on the Mount, speaking the Beatitudes), he is played straight (by actor Kenneth Colley) and portrayed with respect. The comedy begins when members of the crowd mishear his statements of peace, love, and tolerance (&quot;I think he said, &#x27;Blessed are the cheesemakers).

Directing duties were handled solely by Jones, having amicably agreed with Gilliam that Jones&#x27; approach to film-making was better suited for Python&#x27;s general performing style. &quot;Holy Grail&#x27;s&quot; production had often been stilted by their differences behind the camera. Gilliam again contributed two animated sequences (one being the opening credits) and took charge of set design. The film was shot on location in Tunisia, the finances being provided this time by The Beatles&#x27; George Harrison, who together with Denis O&#x27;Brien formed the production company Hand-Made Films for the movie. Harrison had a cameo role as the &quot;owner of the Mount&quot;.

Despite its subject matter attracting controversy, particularly upon its initial release, it has (together with its predecessor) been ranked among the greatest comedy films. In 2006, it was ranked first on a Channel 4 list of the 50 Greatest Comedy Films. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine called it &quot;an unrivalled satire on religion&quot;. In 2013, Richard Burridge, a theologian decorated by Pope Francis, called &quot;Life of Brian&quot; an &quot;extraordinary tribute to the life and work and teaching of Jesus—that they couldn&#x27;t actually blaspheme or make a joke out of it. They did a great satire on closed minds and people who follow blindly. Then you have them splitting into factions...it is a wonderful satire on the way that Jesus&#x27;s own teaching has been used to persecute others. They were satirising fundamentalism and persecution of others and at the same time saying the one person who rises above all this was Jesus&quot;.

====&quot;Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot; (1982)====

Monty Python performed four consecutive dates at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles in September 1980 during preparations for &quot;Meaning of Life&quot;. The performances were filmed and released in the concert film, &quot;Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot; (directed by Terry Hughes), with the Pythons performing sketches from the television series in front of an audience. The released film also incorporated footage from the German television specials (the inclusion of which gives Ian MacNaughton his first on-screen credit for Python since the end of &quot;Flying Circus&quot;) and live performances of several songs from the troupe&#x27;s then-current &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Contractual Obligation Album&quot;. Monty Python&#x27;s four-night stint as headliners at the Hollywood Bowl set a record for a comedy act at the venue; it has since been equalled by Dave Chappelle in May 2022.

====&quot;Monty Python&#x27;s The Meaning of Life&quot; (1983)====
The Pythons&#x27; final film returned to something structurally closer to the style of &quot;Flying Circus&quot;: a series of sketches loosely follows the ages of man from birth to death. Directed again by Jones solo, &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; is embellished with some of the group&#x27;s most bizarre and disturbing moments, as well as various elaborate musical numbers, which include &quot;Galaxy Song&quot; (performed by Idle) and &quot;Every Sperm Is Sacred&quot; (performed by Palin and Jones). The film is by far their darkest work, containing a great deal of black humour, garnished by some spectacular violence (including an operation to remove a liver from a living patient without anaesthetic and the morbidly obese Mr. Creosote exploding over several restaurant patrons after finally giving in to the smooth maître d&#x27; telling him to eat a mint – &quot;It&#x27;s only a wafer-thin mint...&quot;). At the time of its release, the Pythons confessed their aim was to offend &quot;absolutely everyone&quot;, adding &quot;It is guaranteed to offend&quot;.

The Liver Donor scene (in which a paramedic appears at the door of a living man to take his liver) is a satire on bureaucracy, a common Python trope. Besides the opening credits and the fish sequence, Gilliam, by now an established live-action director, no longer wanted to produce any linking cartoons, offering instead to direct one sketch, &quot;The Crimson Permanent Assurance&quot;. Under his helm, though, the segment grew so ambitious and tangential that it was cut from the movie and used as a supporting feature in its own right. (Television screenings also use it as a prologue.) This was the last project on which all six Pythons collaborated, except for the 1989 compilation &quot;Parrot Sketch Not Included,&quot; where they are all seen sitting in a closet for four seconds. This was the last time Chapman appeared on screen with the Pythons.

Although not as acclaimed as its two predecessors (&quot;Holy Grail&quot; and &quot;Life of Brian&quot;), &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; was still well received critically and was screened at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival where it won the Grand Prix.

===&quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; benefit shows===
Members of Python contributed their services to charitable endeavours and causes—sometimes as an ensemble, at other times as individuals. The cause that has been the most frequent and consistent beneficiary has been the human rights work of Amnesty International. Between 1976 and 1981, the troupe or its members appeared in four major fund-raisers for Amnesty—known collectively as the &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; shows—which were turned into multiple films, TV shows, videos, record albums, and books. The brainchild of John Cleese, these benefit shows in London and their many spin-offs raised considerable sums of money for Amnesty, raised public and media awareness of the human rights cause, and influenced many other members of the entertainment community (especially rock musicians) to become involved in political and social issues. Among the many musicians who have publicly attributed their activism—and the organisation of their own benefit events—to the inspiration of the work in this field of Monty Python are Bob Geldof (organiser of Live Aid), U2, Pete Townshend, and Sting. Bono told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1986, &quot;I saw &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; and it became a part of me. It sowed a seed...&quot; Sting states, &quot;before [the Ball] I did not know about Amnesty, I did not know about its work, I did not know about torture in the world.&quot; On the impact of the Ball on Geldof, Sting states, &quot;he took the &#x27;Ball&#x27; and ran with it.&quot;

&quot;Ball&quot; co-founder Cleese and Jones had an involvement (as performer, writer or director) in all four Amnesty benefit shows, Palin in three, Chapman in two, and Gilliam in one. Idle did not participate in the Amnesty shows. Notwithstanding Idle&#x27;s lack of participation, the other five members (together with &quot;Associate Pythons&quot; Carol Cleveland and Neil Innes) all appeared together in the first &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; benefit—the 1976 &quot;A Poke in the Eye&quot; held at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in London&#x27;s West End—where they performed several Python sketches. In this first show, they were collectively billed as &quot;Monty Python&quot;. Peter Cook deputised for the absent Idle in a courtroom sketch. In the next three shows, the participating Python members performed many Python sketches, but were billed under their individual names rather than under the collective Python banner. The second show featured newcomer Rowan Atkinson and Scottish comedian Billy Connolly. The &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; were the first stage shows in the UK to present comedic performers (such as Monty Python and Rowan Atkinson) in the same setting and shows as their contemporaries in rock music (which included Eric Clapton, Sting and Phil Collins). After a six-year break, Amnesty resumed producing &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; benefit shows which were held at the London Palladium in 1987 (sometimes with, and sometimes without, variants of the title) and by 2006 had presented a total of twelve shows. Since 1987, the Balls featured newer generations of British comedic performers, such as Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, and puppets from the satirical TV show &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, with many attributing their participation in the show to their desire to emulate the Python&#x27;s pioneering work for Amnesty. Cleese and Palin made a brief cameo appearance in the 1989 Amnesty show; apart from that, the Pythons have not appeared in shows after the first four.

===Going solo===
Each member has pursued various film, television, and stage projects since the break-up of the group, but often continued to work with one another. Many of these collaborations were very successful, most notably &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot; (1988), written by Cleese, in which he starred along with Palin. The pair also appeared in &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (1981), a film directed by Gilliam, who wrote it together with Palin. Gilliam directed &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; (1977), and also directed and co-wrote &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985), which featured Palin, &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot; (1988), which featured Idle; he followed these with writing and directing an additional six (as of 2021) films.

HandMade Films, the film studio that George Harrison co-founded to produce &quot;Life of Brian&quot;, contributed to British cinema in the 1980s, producing classics of the period including &quot;The Long Good Friday&quot; and &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; (both starring Bob Hoskins), &quot;Time Bandits&quot;, and &quot;Withnail and I&quot;, with the studio also launching Terry Gilliam&#x27;s directorial career. &quot;Yellowbeard&quot; (1983) was co-written by Chapman and starred Chapman, Idle, and Cleese, as well as many other English comedians including Peter Cook, Spike Milligan, and Marty Feldman.

Palin and Jones wrote the comedic TV series &quot;Ripping Yarns&quot; (1976–79), starring Palin. Jones also appeared in the pilot episode and Cleese appeared in a nonspeaking part in the episode &quot;Golden Gordon&quot;. Jones&#x27; film &quot;Erik the Viking&quot; also has Cleese playing a small part. In 1996 Terry Jones wrote and directed an adaptation of Kenneth Grahame&#x27;s novel &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;. It featured four members of Monty Python: Jones as Mr. Toad, Idle as Ratty, Cleese as Mr. Toad&#x27;s lawyer, and Palin as the Sun. Gilliam was considered for the voice of the river. The film included Steve Coogan who played Mole.

Cleese has the most prolific solo career, appearing in dozens of films, several TV shows or series (including &quot;Cheers&quot;, &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot;, Q&#x27;s assistant in the James Bond movies, and &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;), many direct-to-video productions, some video games and a number of commercials. His BBC sitcom &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; (written by and starring Cleese together with his wife Connie Booth) is the only comedy series to rank higher than the &quot;Flying Circus&quot; on the BFI TV 100&#x27;s list, topping the whole poll. Cleese&#x27;s character, Basil Fawlty, was ranked second (to Homer Simpson) on Channel 4&#x27;s 2001 list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters.

Idle enjoyed critical success with &quot;Rutland Weekend Television&quot; in the mid-1970s, out of which came the Beatles parody the Rutles (responsible for the cult mockumentary &quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot;), and as an actor in &quot;Nuns on the Run&quot; (1990) with Robbie Coltrane. In 1976 Idle directed music videos for George Harrison songs &quot;This Song&quot; and &quot;Crackerbox Palace&quot;, the latter of which also featured cameo appearances from Neil Innes and John Cleese. Idle has had success with Python songs: &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot; went to no. 3 in the UK singles chart in 1991. The song had been revived by Simon Mayo on BBC Radio 1, and was consequently released as a single that year. The theatrical phenomenon of the Python musical &quot;Spamalot&quot; has made Idle the most financially successful of the troupe after Python. Written by Idle (and featuring a pre-recorded cameo of Cleese as the voice of God), it has proved to be an enormous hit on Broadway, London&#x27;s West End and Las Vegas. This was followed by &quot;Not the Messiah&quot;, which revises &quot;The Life of Brian&quot; as an oratorio. For the work&#x27;s 2007 premiere at the Luminato festival in Toronto (which commissioned the work), Idle himself sang the &quot;baritone-ish&quot; part.

===After &quot;Python&quot; reunions===
Since &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;, their last project as a team, the Pythons have often been the subject of reunion rumours. In 1988 Monty Python won the BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Contribution To Cinema, with four of the six Pythons (Jones, Palin, Gilliam and Chapman) collecting the award. The final appearance of all six together occurred during the 1989 &quot;Parrot Sketch Not Included – 20 Years of Monty Python&quot; TV special. The death of Chapman in October 1989 put an end to the speculation of any further reunions. However, there were several occasions after 1989 when the remaining five members gathered together for appearances — albeit not formal reunions. In 1996 Jones, Idle, Cleese, and Palin were featured in a film adaptation of &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;, which was later renamed &quot;Mr. Toad&#x27;s Wild Ride&quot;. In 1997, Palin and Cleese rolled out a new version of the &quot;Dead Parrot sketch&quot; for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

Monty Python were the inaugural recipients of the Empire Inspiration Award in 1997. Palin, Jones and Gilliam received the award on stage in London from Elton John while Cleese and Idle appeared via satellite from Los Angeles. In 1998, during the US Comedy Arts Festival, where the troupe were awarded the AFI Star Award by the American Film Institute, the five remaining members, along with what was purported to be Chapman&#x27;s ashes, were reunited on stage for the first time in 18 years. The occasion was in the form of an interview called &quot;Monty Python Live at Aspen&quot;, (hosted by Robert Klein, with an appearance by Eddie Izzard) in which the team looked back at some of their work and performed a few new sketches. On 9 October 1999, to commemorate 30 years since the first &quot;Flying Circus&quot; television broadcast, BBC2 devoted an evening to Python programmes, including a documentary charting the history of the team, interspersed with new sketches by the Monty Python team filmed especially for the event.

The surviving Pythons had agreed in principle to perform a live tour of America in 1999. Several shows were to be linked with Q&amp;A meetings in various cities. Although all had said yes, Palin later changed his mind, much to the annoyance of Idle, who had begun work organising the tour. This led to Idle refusing to take part in the new material shot for the BBC anniversary evening. In 2002, four of the surviving members, bar Cleese, performed &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot; and &quot;Sit on My Face&quot; for George Harrison&#x27;s memorial concert. The reunion also included regular supporting contributors Neil Innes and Carol Cleveland, with a special appearance from Tom Hanks. In an interview to publicise the DVD release of &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;, Cleese said a further reunion was unlikely. &quot;It is absolutely impossible to get even a majority of us together in a room, and I&#x27;m not joking,&quot; Cleese said. He said that the problem was one of busyness rather than one of bad feelings. A sketch appears on the same DVD spoofing the impossibility of a full reunion, bringing the members &quot;together&quot; in a deliberately unconvincing fashion with modern bluescreen/greenscreen techniques.

Idle responded to queries about a Python reunion by adapting a line used by George Harrison in response to queries about a possible Beatles reunion. When asked about such a possibility in November 1989, Harrison responded: &quot;As far as I&#x27;m concerned, there won&#x27;t be a Beatles reunion as long as John Lennon remains dead.&quot; Idle&#x27;s version of this was that he expected to see a proper Python reunion, &quot;just as soon as Graham Chapman comes back from the dead&quot;, but added, &quot;we&#x27;re talking to his agent about terms.&quot;
&quot;The Pythons Autobiography by The Pythons&quot; (2003), compiled from interviews with the surviving members, reveals that a series of disputes in 1998, over a possible sequel to &quot;Holy Grail&quot; that had been conceived by Idle, may have resulted in the group&#x27;s split. Cleese&#x27;s feeling was that &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; had been personally difficult and ultimately mediocre, and did not wish to be involved in another Python project for a variety of reasons (not least amongst them was the absence of Chapman, whose straight man-like central roles in the &quot;Grail&quot; and &quot;Brian&quot; films had been considered to be an essential anchoring performance). The book also reveals that Cleese saw Chapman as his &quot;greatest sounding board. If Graham thought something was funny, then it almost certainly was funny. You cannot believe how invaluable that is.&#x27; Ultimately it was Cleese who ended the possibility of another Python movie.

A full, if nonperforming, reunion of the surviving Python members appeared at the March 2005 premiere of Idle&#x27;s musical &quot;Spamalot&quot;. Based on &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;, it also spoofs popular musicals, including those of Andrew Lloyd Webber. It opened in Chicago and has since played in New York on Broadway, London, and numerous other major cities across the world. In 2004, &quot;Spamalot&quot; was nominated for 14 Tony Awards and won three: Best Musical, Best Direction of a Musical for Mike Nichols, and Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical for Sara Ramirez, who played the Lady of the Lake, a character specially added for the musical. The original Broadway cast included Tim Curry as King Arthur, Michael McGrath as Patsy, David Hyde Pierce as Sir Robin, Hank Azaria as Sir Lancelot and other roles (e.g., the French Taunter, Knight of Ni, and Tim the Enchanter), Christopher Sieber as Sir Galahad and other roles (e.g., the Black Knight and Prince Herbert&#x27;s Father). Cleese played the voice of God, a role played in the film by Chapman.

Owing in part to the success of &quot;Spamalot&quot;, PBS announced on 13 July 2005 that it would begin to re-air the entire run of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; and new one-hour specials focusing on each member of the group, called &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Personal Best&quot;. Each episode was written and produced by the individual being honoured, with the five remaining Pythons collaborating on Chapman&#x27;s programme, the only one of the editions to take on a serious tone with its new material.
In 2009, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the first episode of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, a six-part documentary entitled &quot;Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)&quot; was released, featuring interviews with the surviving members of the team, as well as archive interviews with Graham Chapman and numerous excerpts from the television series and films. Each episode opens with a different re-recording of the theme song from &quot;Life of Brian&quot;, with Iron Maiden vocalist and Python fan Bruce Dickinson performing the sixth.

Also in commemoration of the 40th anniversary, Idle, Palin, Jones, and Gilliam appeared in a production of &quot;Not the Messiah&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall. The European premiere was held on 23 October 2009. An official 40th anniversary Monty Python reunion event took place in New York City on 15 October 2009, where the team received a Special Award from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.

In June 2011, it was announced that &quot;A Liar&#x27;s Autobiography: The Untrue Story of Monty Python&#x27;s Graham Chapman&quot;, an animated 3D movie based on the memoir of Graham Chapman, was in the making. The memoir &quot;A Liar&#x27;s Autobiography&quot; was published in 1980 and details Chapman&#x27;s journey through medical school, alcoholism, acknowledgement of his gay identity, and the tolls of surreal comedy. Asked what was true in a deliberately fanciful account by Chapman of his life, Terry Jones joked: &quot;Nothing ... it&#x27;s all a downright, absolute, blackguardly lie.&quot; The film uses Chapman&#x27;s own voice—from a reading of his autobiography shortly before he died of cancer—and entertainment channel Epix announced the film&#x27;s release in early 2012 in both 2D and 3D formats. Produced and directed by London-based Bill Jones, Ben Timlett, and Jeff Simpson, the new film has 15 animation companies working on chapters that will range from three to 12 minutes in length, each in a different style. John Cleese recorded dialogue which was matched with Chapman&#x27;s voice. Michael Palin voiced Chapman&#x27;s father and Terry Jones voiced his mother. Terry Gilliam voiced Graham&#x27;s psychiatrist. They all play various other roles. Among the original Python group, only Eric Idle was not involved.

On 26 January 2012, Terry Jones announced that the five surviving Pythons would reunite in a sci-fi comedy film called &quot;Absolutely Anything&quot;. The film would combine computer-generated imagery and live action. It would be directed by Jones based on a script by Jones and Gavin Scott, and in addition to the Python members it would also star Simon Pegg, Kate Beckinsale and Robin Williams (in his final film role). The plot revolves around a teacher who discovers aliens (voiced by the Pythons) have given him magical powers to do &quot;absolutely anything&quot;. Eric Idle responded via Twitter that he would not, in fact, be participating, although he was later added to the cast.

===&quot;Monty Python Live (Mostly): One Down, Five to Go&quot;===

In 2013, the Pythons lost a legal case to Mark Forstater, the film producer of &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;, over royalties for the derivative work &quot;Spamalot&quot;. They owed a combined £800,000 in legal fees and back royalties to Forstater. They proposed a reunion show to pay their legal bill.

On 19 November 2013, a new reunion was reported, following months of &quot;secret talks&quot;. The original plan was for a live, one-off stage show at the O2 Arena in London on 1 July 2014, with &quot;some of Monty Python&#x27;s greatest hits, with modern, topical, Pythonesque twists&quot; according to a press release. The tickets for this show went on sale in November 2013 and sold out in just 43 seconds. Nine additional shows were added, all of them at the O2, the last on 20 July. They have said that their reunion was inspired by &quot;South Park&quot; creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who are massive Monty Python fans.

Mick Jagger and Charlie Watts featured in a promotional video for the shows: &quot;Who wants to see that again, really? It&#x27;s a bunch of wrinkly old men trying to relive their youth and make a load of money—the best one died years ago!&quot; Michael Palin stated that the final reunion show on 20 July 2014 would be the last time that the troupe would perform together. It was screened to 2,000 cinemas around the world. Prior to the final night, Idle stated, &quot;It is a world event and that&#x27;s really quite exciting. It means we&#x27;re actually going to say goodbye publicly on one show. Nobody ever has the chance to do that. The Beatles didn&#x27;t get a last good night.&quot; The last show was broadcast in the UK on Gold TV and internationally in cinemas by Fathom Events through a Dish Network satellite link.

In April 2015, the five surviving Pythons participated in a reunion event moderated by John Oliver as part of the Tribeca Festival at the Beacon Theatre in New York City following a 40th anniversary screening of &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;.

==Broadcast rights==
Netflix secured the global streaming rights for the Monty Python catalogue in 2018. Shout Factory picked up American and Canadian distribution rights from Netflix in 2024.

==Python members==
=== Graham Chapman ===
Graham Chapman was originally a medical student, joining the Footlights at Cambridge. He completed his medical training and was legally entitled to practise as a doctor. Chapman is best remembered for the lead roles in &quot;Holy Grail&quot;, as King Arthur, and &quot;Life of Brian&quot;, as Brian Cohen. He died of metastatic throat cancer on 4 October 1989. At Chapman&#x27;s memorial service, Cleese delivered an irreverent eulogy that included all the euphemisms for being dead from the &quot;Dead Parrot&quot; sketch, which they had written. Chapman&#x27;s comedic fictional memoir, &quot;A Liar&#x27;s Autobiography: Volume VI&quot;, was adapted into an animated 3D film in 2012.

=== John Cleese ===

John Cleese is the oldest Python. He met his future Python writing partner, Chapman, in Cambridge. Outside of Python, he is best known for setting up the Video Arts group and for the sitcom &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; (co-written with Connie Booth, whom Cleese met during work on Python and to whom he was married for a decade). In &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; Cleese starred as hotel owner Basil Fawlty, and received the 1980 British Academy Television Award for Best Entertainment Performance. Cleese has also co-authored several books on psychology and wrote the screenplay for the award-winning &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot;, in which he starred with Michael Palin, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. In &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot;, Cleese went against type, with &quot;PopMatters&quot; magazine stating: &quot;For a generation of fans who grew up with Cleese doing silly walks and mock Hitler salutes with Monty Python, this was something completely different indeed. For the first time, Cleese was being romantic in his role in A Fish Called Wanda.&quot;

=== Terry Gilliam ===
Terry Gilliam, an American by birth, is the only member of the troupe of non-British origin. He started off as an animator and strip cartoonist for Harvey Kurtzman&#x27;s &quot;Help!&quot; magazine, one issue of which featured Cleese. Moving from the US to England, he animated features for &quot;Do Not Adjust Your Set&quot; and was then asked by its makers to join them on their next project: &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;. He co-directed &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; and directed short segments of other Python films (for instance &quot;The Crimson Permanent Assurance&quot;, the short film that appears before &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;). Gilliam has directed thirteen films in total, and collaborated with Palin on three of them, which included Palin starring in &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985).

=== Eric Idle ===

When Monty Python was first formed, two writing partnerships were already in place: Cleese and Chapman, as well as Jones and Palin. That left two in their own corners: Gilliam, operating solo due to the nature of his work, and Eric Idle. Regular themes in Idle&#x27;s contributions were elaborate wordplay and musical numbers. After &quot;Flying Circus&quot;, he hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; four times in the first five seasons. Idle&#x27;s initially successful solo career faltered in the 1990s with the failures of his 1993 film &quot;Splitting Heirs&quot; (written, produced by, and starring him) and 1998&#x27;s &quot;An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn&quot; (in which he starred). He revived his career by returning to the source of his worldwide fame, adapting Monty Python material for other media. Idle wrote the Tony Award-winning musical &quot;Spamalot&quot;, based on &quot;Holy Grail&quot;. Following the success of the musical he wrote &quot;Not the Messiah&quot;, an oratorio derived from the &quot;Life of Brian&quot;. Representing Monty Python, Idle featured in a one-hour symphony of British Music when he performed at the London 2012 Olympic Games closing ceremony.

=== Terry Jones ===
Terry Jones has been described by other members of the team as the &quot;heart&quot; of the operation. Jones had a lead role in maintaining the group&#x27;s unity and creative independence. Python biographer George Perry has commented that should &quot;[you] speak to him on subjects as diverse as fossil fuels, or Rupert Bear, or mercenaries in the Middle Ages or Modern China ... in a moment you will find yourself hopelessly out of your depth, floored by his knowledge.&quot; Many others agree that Jones is characterised by his irrepressible, good-natured enthusiasm. However, Jones&#x27; passion often led to prolonged arguments with other group members—in particular Cleese—with Jones often unwilling to back down. Since his major contributions were largely behind the scenes (direction, writing), and he often deferred to the other members of the group as an actor, Jones&#x27; importance to Python was often under-rated. However, he does have the legacy of delivering possibly the most famous line in all of Python, as Brian&#x27;s mother Mandy in &quot;Life of Brian&quot;, &quot;He&#x27;s not the Messiah, he&#x27;s a very naughty boy!&quot;, a line voted the funniest in film history on two occasions. Jones died on 21 January 2020 from complications of dementia.

=== Michael Palin ===
Sir Michael Palin attended Oxford, where he met his Python writing partner Jones. The two also wrote the series &quot;Ripping Yarns&quot; together. Palin and Jones originally wrote face-to-face, but soon found it was more productive to write apart and then come together to review what the other had written. Therefore, Jones and Palin&#x27;s sketches tended to be more focused than that of the others, taking one bizarre situation, sticking to it, and building on it. After &quot;Flying Circus&quot;, Palin hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; four times in the first 10 seasons. His comedy output began to decrease in amount following the increasing success of his travel documentaries for the BBC. Palin released a book of diaries from the Python years entitled &quot;Michael Palin Diaries 1969–1979&quot;, published in 2007. Palin was awarded a knighthood in the 2019 New Year Honours, which was announced by Buckingham Palace in December 2018.

===Associate Pythons===
Several people have been accorded unofficial &quot;associate Python&quot; status over the years. Occasionally, such people have been referred to as the &#x27;seventh Python&#x27;, in a style reminiscent of George Martin (or other associates of the Beatles) being dubbed &quot;the Fifth Beatle&quot;. The two collaborators with the most meaningful and plentiful contributions have been Neil Innes and Carol Cleveland. Both were present and presented as Associate Pythons at the official Monty Python 25th-anniversary celebrations held in Los Angeles in July 1994.

Neil Innes is the only non-Python besides Douglas Adams to be credited with writing material for &quot;Flying Circus&quot;. He appeared in sketches and the Python films, as well as performing some of his songs in &quot;Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot;. He was also a regular stand-in for absent team members on the rare occasions when they recreated sketches. For example, he took the place of Cleese at the Concert for George. Gilliam once noted that if anyone qualified for the title of the seventh Python, it would be Innes. He was one of the creative talents in the off-beat Bonzo Dog Band. He would later portray Ron Nasty of the Rutles and write all of the Rutles&#x27; compositions for &quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot; (1978), a mockumentary film co-directed by Idle. By 2005, a falling out had occurred between Idle and Innes over additional Rutles projects, the results being Innes&#x27; critically acclaimed Rutles &quot;reunion&quot; album &quot;The Rutles: Archaeology&quot; and Idle&#x27;s straight-to-DVD &quot;The Rutles 2: Can&#x27;t Buy Me Lunch&quot;, each undertaken without the other&#x27;s participation. According to an interview with Idle in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in May 2005, his attitude is that Innes and he go back &quot;too far. And no further.&quot; Innes died of a heart attack on 29 December 2019 near Toulouse, where he had lived for several years.

Carol Cleveland was the most important female performer in the Monty Python ensemble, commonly referred to as &quot;the female Python&quot;. She was originally hired by producer/director John Howard Davies for just the first five episodes of the &quot;Flying Circus&quot;. The Pythons then pushed to make Cleveland a permanent recurring performer after producer/director Ian MacNaughton brought in several other actresses who were not as good as she was. Cleveland went on to appear in about two-thirds of the episodes, as well as in all of the Python films, and in most of their stage shows, as well. According to &quot;Time&quot;, her most recognisable film roles are playing Zoot and Dingo, two maidens in the Castle Anthrax in &quot;Holy Grail&quot;.

===Other contributors===
Cleese&#x27;s first wife, Connie Booth, appeared as various characters in all four series of &quot;Flying Circus&quot;. Her most significant role was the &quot;best girl&quot; of the eponymous Lumberjack in &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot;, though this role was sometimes played by Carol Cleveland. Booth appeared in a total of six sketches and also played one-off characters in Python feature films &quot;And Now for Something Completely Different&quot; and &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;.

Douglas Adams was &quot;discovered&quot; by Chapman when a version of &quot;Footlights Revue&quot; (a 1974 BBC2 television show featuring some of Adams&#x27; early work) was performed live in London&#x27;s West End. In Cleese&#x27;s absence from the final TV series, the two formed a brief writing partnership, with Adams earning a writing credit in one episode for a sketch called &quot;Patient Abuse&quot;. In the sketch—a satire on mind-boggling bureaucracy—a man who had been stabbed by a nurse arrives at his doctor&#x27;s office bleeding profusely from the stomach, when the doctor makes him fill in numerous senseless forms before he can administer treatment. He also had two cameo appearances in this season. Firstly, in the episode &quot;The Light Entertainment War&quot;, Adams shows up in a surgeon&#x27;s mask (as Dr. Emile Koning, according to the on-screen captions), pulling on gloves, while Palin narrates a sketch that introduces one person after another, and never actually gets started. Secondly, at the beginning of &quot;Mr. Neutron&quot;, Adams is dressed in a &quot;pepperpot&quot; outfit and loads a missile onto a cart being driven by Terry Jones, who is calling out for scrap metal (&quot;Any old iron ...&quot;). Adams and Chapman also subsequently attempted a few non-Python projects, including &quot;Out of the Trees&quot;. He also contributed to a sketch on the soundtrack album for &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;.

Other than Carol Cleveland, the only other non-Python to make a significant number of appearances in the &quot;Flying Circus&quot; was Ian Davidson. He appeared in the first two series of the show, and played over 10 roles. While Davidson is primarily known as a scriptwriter, it is not known if he had any contribution toward the writing of the sketches, as he is only credited as a performer. In total, Davidson is credited as appearing in eight episodes of the show, which is more than any other male actor who was not a Python. Despite this, Davidson did not appear in any Python-related media subsequent to series 2, though footage of him was shown on the documentary &quot;Python Night – 30 Years of Monty Python&quot;.

Stand-up comedian Eddie Izzard, a devoted fan of the group, has occasionally stood in for absent members. When the BBC held a &quot;Python Night&quot; in 1999 to celebrate 30 years of the first broadcast of &quot;Flying Circus&quot;, the Pythons recorded some new material with Izzard standing in for Idle, who had declined to partake in person (he taped a solo contribution from the US). Izzard hosted &quot;The Life of Python&quot; (1999), a history of the group that was part of Python Night and appeared with them at a festival/tribute in Aspen, Colorado, in 1998 (released on DVD as &quot;Live at Aspen&quot;). Izzard has said that Monty Python was a significant influence on her style of comedy and Cleese has referred to her as &quot;the lost Python&quot;.

Series director of &quot;Flying Circus&quot;, Ian MacNaughton, is also regularly associated with the group and made a few on-screen appearances in the show and in the film &quot;And Now for Something Completely Different&quot;. Apart from Neil Innes, others to contribute musically included Fred Tomlinson and the Fred Tomlinson Singers. They made appearances in songs such as &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot; as a backup choir. Other contributors and performers for the Pythons included John Howard Davies, John Hughman, Lyn Ashley, Bob Raymond, John Young, Rita Davies, Stanley Mason, Maureen Flanagan, and David Ballantyne.

==Cultural influence and legacy==

By the time of Monty Python&#x27;s 25th anniversary, in 1994, the point was already being made that &quot;the five surviving members had with the passing years begun to occupy an institutional position in the edifice of British social culture that they had once had so much fun trying to demolish&quot;. A similar point is made in a 2006 book on the relationship between Python and philosophy: &quot;It is remarkable, after all, not only that the utterly bizarre &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; was sponsored by the BBC in the first place, but that Monty Python itself grew into an institution of enormous cultural influence.&quot;

Ron Devillier, the PBS programming director who put &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; on American television, states, &quot;they brought through a kind of phony baloney surface ethic that we all lived under and shot right through it and split it in half. If you really let it happen, you could laugh at yourself. All the things that they were doing were really funny like playing on our sensibilities and making fun of them in a very funny way, pointing out how pompous we can be and making fun of themselves at the same time.&quot; Danny Gallagher of the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; writes, &quot;Monty Python has also been good to American comedy. If America&#x27;s television viewing public had never seen &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot; or &quot;The Dead Parrot&quot; sketch, we might still be holding up &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot; as a supreme example of cutting-edge TV comedy.&quot; &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;, featuring the slapstick and innuendo of Benny Hill, which contrasted with Python&#x27;s more absurdist style, was also a hugely successful British comedy on US television, with Charles Isherwood writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: “Benny” and “Monty” were essential poles of British television comedy as imported to America in the 1970s.&quot;

A self-contained comedy unit responsible for both writing and performing their work, Monty Python&#x27;s influence on comedy has been compared to the Beatles&#x27; influence on music. Author Neil Gaiman writes, &quot;A strange combination of individuals gave us Python. And you needed those people, just in the same way that with the Beatles you had four talented people, but together you had the Beatles. And I think that&#x27;s so incredibly true when it comes to Python.&quot;

===Comedy stylists===

Monty Python have been named as being influential to the comedy stylings of a great many people including: Sacha Baron Cohen, David Cross, Rowan Atkinson, Seth MacFarlane, Seth Meyers, Trey Parker, Matt Stone, Vic and Bob, Mike Myers, Russell Brand, Robin Williams, Jerry Seinfeld, Eddie Izzard, and &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic. Matt Groening, creator of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, was influenced by Python&#x27;s &quot;high velocity sense of the absurd and not stopping to explain yourself&quot;, and pays tribute through a couch gag used in seasons five and six. Appearing on &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Best Bits (Mostly)&quot;, Jim Carrey—who refers to Monty Python as the &quot;Super Justice League of comedy&quot;—recalled the effect on him of Ernest Scribbler (played by Palin) laughing himself to death in &quot;The Funniest Joke in the World&quot; sketch. Nick Park, creator of &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit&quot;, was inspired by Gilliam&#x27;s animation in Monty Python &quot;to be a bit wacky and off the wall&quot;. Simon Pegg, co-writer of the &quot;Three Flavours Cornetto&quot; trilogy of British comedy films (from &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; to &quot;The World&#x27;s End&quot;), stated his &quot;love of comedy was hugely informed by Monty Python&quot;. Jerry Seinfeld told &quot;Parade&quot;, &quot;Monty Python was a gigantic influence on me. They were just about silly, funny things that meant nothing, and that&#x27;s the stuff I love. There&#x27;s a wonderful childlike freedom in those kinds of things.&quot; &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; served as an inspiration for voice actor Rob Paulsen in voicing Pinky from the animated television series &quot;Animaniacs&quot; and &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot;, giving the character &quot;a goofy whack job&quot; of a British accent. Graham Linehan, co-creator of the sitcom &quot;Father Ted&quot;, cited the ineffectual protest of &quot;Life of Brian&quot; upon its release as an influence for the &quot;Father Ted&quot; episode &quot;The Passion of Saint Tibulus&quot;.

Comedian John Oliver states, &quot;Writing about the importance of Monty Python is basically pointless. Citing them as an influence is almost redundant. It&#x27;s assumed. This strange group of wildly talented, appropriately disrespectful, hugely imaginative and massively inspirational idiots changed what comedy could be for their generation and for those that followed.&quot; On how Python&#x27;s freeform style influenced sketch comedy, Tina Fey of the American television show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; states, &quot;Sketch endings are overrated. Their key was to do something as long as it was funny and then just stop and do something else.&quot; Stephen Merchant, co-creator of &quot;The Office&quot; with Ricky Gervais, stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t remember where I got this grand idea that I could somehow be John Cleese. That was my overriding passion from my mid-teens. Cleese had grown up in Weston-Super-Mare, not far from Bristol where I grew up, and he was tall and he was very funny and very British and it&#x27;s almost like I thought &#x27;well if they want tall people from the west country I can do that.&#x27;&quot;

===Places===
; In space
* Seven asteroids are named after Monty Python or its members: 9617 Grahamchapman, 9618 Johncleese, 9619 Terrygilliam, 9620 Ericidle, 9621 Michaelpalin, 9622 Terryjones, and 13681 Monty Python.
* In 2010, the commercial space company SpaceX launched a wheel of cheese into low Earth orbit and returned it safely to Earth on COTS Demo Flight 1. Elon Musk, CEO and CTO of SpaceX, said this was done as a tribute to Monty Python.
;Terrestrial
* After John Cleese spoke negatively about the town of Palmerston North in New Zealand, recommending it as a good place to commit suicide, the town renamed a compost heap &quot;Mt. Cleese&quot;.

===&quot;Pythonesque&quot;===
Among the more visible cultural influences of Monty Python is the inclusion of terms either directly from, or derived from, Monty Python, into the lexicon of the English language.
* The most obvious of these is the term &quot;&quot;, which has become a byword in surreal humour, and is included in standard dictionaries. Terry Jones commented on his disappointment at the existence of such a term, claiming the initial aim of Monty Python was to create something new and impossible to categorise, and &quot;the fact that Pythonesque is now a word in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; shows the extent to which we failed&quot;.
* The term has been applied to animations similar to those constructed by Gilliam (e.g., the cut-out style of &quot;South Park&quot;, whose creators have often acknowledged a debt to Python, including contributing material to the aforementioned 30th-anniversary theme night).
* &quot;Good Eats&quot; creator Alton Brown cited Python as one of the influences that shaped how he created the series, as well as how he authors the script for each episode. Later episodes included Gilliam-style animations to illustrate key points.
* Film critic Robbie Collin writes, &quot;You can find the Pythonesque everywhere in cinema. Most successful Hollywood comedies bear some kind of Python-print. The &quot;Austin Powers&quot; series chugs along on Pythonisms. Then there are Christopher Guest&#x27;s mockumentaries, such as &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot; and &quot;Best in Show&quot;, which revel in the quiet absurdity of the everyday—well-staked-out Python territory. And there&#x27;s a tensile weirdness in the films of Will Ferrell that&#x27;s also deeply Pythonesque.&quot;

===TV===
The Japanese anime series &quot;Girls und Panzer&quot; featured the special episode &quot;Survival War!&quot;, which referenced the &quot;Spam&quot; sketch, but the word &quot;spam&quot; was censored to avoid legal issue with the Pythons.

===Things named after Monty Python===
Beyond a dictionary definition, Python terms have entered the lexicon in other ways.

* The term &quot;spam&quot; in reference to bulk, unsolicited email is derived from the show&#x27;s 1970 &quot;Spam&quot; sketch. As the waitress recites the Spam-filled menu, a chorus of Viking patrons drown out all conversations with a song, repeating &quot;Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam… Spammity Spam! Wonderful Spam!&quot;
* The Python programming language by Guido van Rossum is named after the troupe, and Monty Python references are often found in sample code created for that language. The default integrated development environment of the programming language is named IDLE, an alternative one is named eric, both in honour of Eric Idle. Additionally, a 2001 April Fool&#x27;s Day joke by van Rossum and Larry Wall involving the merger of Python with Perl was dubbed &quot;Parrot&quot; after the Dead Parrot sketch. The name &quot;Parrot&quot; was later used for a project to develop a virtual machine for running bytecode for interpreted languages such as Perl and Python. Its package index is also known as the &quot;Cheese Shop&quot; after the sketch of the same name. There is also a python refactoring tool called bicyclerepair named after Bicycle Repair Man sketch.
* In 1985, a fossil of a previously unknown species of gigantic prehistoric snake from the Miocene was discovered in Riversleigh, Queensland, Australia. The Australian palaeontologist who discovered the fossil snake was a Monty Python fan, and he gave the snake the taxonomic name of &quot;Montypythonoides riversleighensis&quot; in honour of the Monty Python team.
* In 2006, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s, known for their &quot;celebrity flavours&quot;, introduced to the line-up &quot;Vermonty Python&quot;, a coffee liqueur ice cream with a chocolate cookie crumb swirl and fudge cows. The name &quot;Minty Python&quot; had been suggested before in 1996 in a contest to select the quintessential British ice cream flavour.
* In 1999, in connection with the group&#x27;s 30th anniversary, a beer named &quot;Holy Grail Ale&quot; was released by the Black Sheep Brewery in North Yorkshire.
* The endangered Bemaraha woolly lemur (&quot;Avahi cleesei&quot;) is named after John Cleese.
* Geneticists discovered a mutant gene which caused mutant flies to live twice as long as normal ones. They dubbed the gene &quot;Indy,&quot; which is an acronym for the line of dialogue: &quot;I&#x27;m not dead yet!&quot;, from the film &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;.
* The band Toad the Wet Sprocket took its name from the Rock Notes sketch on the comedy album, &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Contractual Obligation Album&quot;.

===World records===

On St George&#x27;s Day, 23 April 2007, the cast and creators of &quot;Spamalot&quot; gathered in Trafalgar Square under the tutelage of the two Terrys (Jones and Gilliam) to set a new record for the world&#x27;s largest coconut orchestra. They led 5,567 people &quot;clip-clopping&quot; in time to the Python classic, &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot;, for the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; attempt.

On 5 October 2019, to mark the 50th anniversary of Monty Python&#x27;s first show, the &quot;first official Monty Python Guinness world record attempt&quot; tried to break the record for &quot;the largest gathering of people dressed as Gumbys.&quot; A recurring character on the show, a Gumby wears a handkerchief on their head, has spectacles, braces, a knitted tank top, and wellington boots. The shirt sleeves and trouser legs are always rolled up, exposing their socks and knees. Dimwitted, their most famous catchphrases are &quot;My brain hurts!&quot; and repeated shouts of &quot;Hello!&quot; and &quot;Sorry!&quot;

===Theatre===
*&quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;: Between 1974 and 1980 (&quot;Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot; was released in 1982, but was performed in 1980), the Pythons made three sketch-based stage shows, comprising mainly material from the original television series.
*&quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Spamalot&quot;: Written by Idle and directed by Mike Nichols, with music and lyrics by John Du Prez and Idle, it starred Hank Azaria, Tim Curry, and David Hyde Pierce; &quot;Spamalot&quot; is a musical adaptation of the film &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;. It ran in Chicago from 21 December 2004 to 23 January 2005, and began performances on Broadway on 17 March 2005. It won three Tony Awards. It was one of eight UK musicals commemorated on Royal Mail stamps, issued in February 2011.
*&quot;Not the Messiah&quot;: the Toronto Symphony Orchestra commissioned Idle and John Du Prez to write the music and lyrics of an oratorio based on &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot;. Entitled &quot;Not the Messiah&quot;, it had its world premiere as part of Luminato, a &quot;festival of arts and creativity&quot; taking place 1–10 June 2007 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. &quot;Not the Messiah&quot; was conducted by Peter Oundjian, music director of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, who is Idle&#x27;s cousin. It was performed by a narrator, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, with guest soloists and choir. According to Idle, &quot;I promise it will be funnier than Handel, though probably not as good&quot;.
* &quot;Monty Python Live&quot;: One Down, Five to Go: (1–5, 15–16, 18–20 July 2014). The Pythons have stated this is the last live reunion of the remaining members of Monty Python.

<text>Married... with Children is an American television sitcom created by Michael G. Moye and Ron Leavitt for the Fox Broadcasting Company, broadcast from April 5, 1987, to June 9, 1997. It is the longest-running live-action sitcom ever aired on Fox. &quot;Married... with Children&quot; was the first primetime series broadcast on the new Fox network. The series&#x27; run ended with the episode broadcast on May 5, 1997. Two previously unaired episodes were broadcast on June 9, 1997, and June 18, 2002.

The show is set in Chicago and follows the lives of Al Bundy, a former high school football player turned hard-luck women&#x27;s shoe salesman; his lazy wife Peggy; their pretty but dim-witted daughter Kelly; and their smart-aleck son Bud. The show also features their neighbors Steve and Marcy Rhoades, both of whom Al finds annoying, but they likewise feel the same way about him. Later in the series, Marcy marries Jefferson D&#x27;Arcy, a white-collar criminal who becomes her &quot;trophy husband&quot; and Al&#x27;s sidekick.

The series is one of the longest-running sitcoms in American television history, covering 11 seasons with 259 episodes in its run. Its theme song is &quot;Love and Marriage&quot; by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen, performed by Frank Sinatra. Critical reception was mixed during its original run, and the show&#x27;s sexually charged humor and depiction of a dysfunctional family were in stark contrast to family sitcoms of the era.

The first two seasons were videotaped in front of a studio audience at ABC Television Center in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles, with seasons 3 through 8 recorded at Sunset Gower Studios in Hollywood, and seasons 9 through 11 at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City. The series was initially produced by Embassy Communications. Starting halfway through the second season, it was produced by ELP Communications under the studio Columbia Pictures Television.

In 2008, the show made the top 100 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; &quot;New TV Classics&quot; list, placing number 94. In May 2022, an animated revival was in the works.

== Cast and characters ==


* Al Bundy (Ed O&#x27;Neill) – A misanthrope, afflicted by the so-called &quot;Bundy curse&quot; that consigns him to an unrewarding career selling women&#x27;s shoes and a life with a family that mocks and disrespects him, who still enjoys the simple things in life. He constantly attempts to relive his high-school football days, when he was an &quot;All State Fullback&quot;. His most noted achievement was having scored four touchdowns in a single game for Polk High. His favorite things in life are the local nudie bar, his collection of &quot;BigUns&quot; magazine, his Dodge car with more than on the odometer, and a television show called &quot;Psycho Dad&quot;. Despite his family&#x27;s antipathy for him, and his for them, Al is always ready to defend his family and the Bundy honor.
* Peggy Bundy (née Wanker) (Katey Sagal) – Al&#x27;s wife who is always pestering him about money and refuses to do any housework or get a job. Peggy is a lazy redhead who spends most of her time watching talk shows such as &quot;Oprah&quot; or stealing Al&#x27;s limited funds to go shopping; she frequently mocks Al about his unglamourous job, his meager earnings, his hygiene, and his poor sexual abilities. Her careless spending on things like clothes and male strip clubs has run Al into debt on numerous occasions. A recurring joke in the series is Al&#x27;s and Peggy&#x27;s regrets of having married each other, although on occasion they will show affection towards one another. Peggy&#x27;s best friend is Marcy, with whom Peggy occasionally leads into trouble. Peggy&#x27;s side of the family is a backwoods clan of hillbillies whom she often forces the other Bundys to endure, especially her morbidly obese mother, whom Al finds intolerable.
* Kelly Bundy (Christina Applegate) – the Bundys&#x27; firstborn; a dumb blonde who is often derided as promiscuous and dates guys who irritate Al to the point that he wants to physically assault them. Her stupidity manifests in many ways, from forgetting ideas on the spot to mispronouncing or misspelling simple words. She and her brother Bud generally get along, but enjoy belittling one another.
* Budrick &quot;Bud&quot; Franklin Bundy (David Faustino) – the younger Bundy offspring, and sometimes the more level-headed family member, although his preoccupation with sex sometimes leads to inevitable failures with women. He and older sister Kelly constantly taunt each other, but when Kelly is in a legitimate bind he will support her, much like Kelly does for him under similar circumstances.
* Marcy Rhoades, later Marcy D&#x27;Arcy (Amanda Bearse) – the Bundys&#x27; next-door neighbor, Al&#x27;s nemesis and Peggy&#x27;s best friend; an educated banker, but also a feminist and environmentalist who often protests Al&#x27;s schemes with his NO MA&#x27;AM (National Organization of Men Against Amazonian Masterhood) group. Marcy is the founder and leader of an anti-man support group called &quot;FANG&quot; (Feminists Against Neanderthal Guys). Marcy and Al constantly bicker and do not get along. For the first few seasons of the show, Marcy is married to Steve Rhoades. After Marcy and Steve divorce and he leaves during the fourth season, Marcy meets and marries Jefferson D&#x27;Arcy, giving her the name Marcy D&#x27;Arcy.
* Steven &quot;Steve&quot; Bartholomew Rhoades (David Garrison) is Marcy&#x27;s first husband, a stuffy banker who finds himself frequently entangled in Al&#x27;s schemes. Steve&#x27;s most prized possession is his Mercedes-Benz, which he does not even let Marcy drive. Although very much in love at the beginning of the series, Steve and Marcy grow apart and he leaves her during the fourth season to become a forest ranger at Yosemite National Park. He later comes back in &quot;The Egg and I&quot; episode to try and reclaim his old life with Marcy, but finds trouble with Jefferson, Marcy&#x27;s second husband. Steve later has another job as the dean of Bud&#x27;s college, after blackmailing the previous one he worked under as a chauffeur.
* Jefferson Milhouse D&#x27;Arcy (Ted McGinley), a pretty-boy scammer to whom Marcy wakes up one morning and discovers she has married. Unlike Steve, Jefferson is more of a free spirit, likes to have fun, is constantly unemployed, has no money of his own, and uses Marcy for financial purposes. Marcy is aware of this, but whenever Jefferson gets into trouble with her, he distracts her by working his charm and resorting to sexual bartering. In several episodes, Jefferson is implied, but never confirmed, to have had a past life as a former spy/CIA operative.

=== Pilot episode ===
In the show&#x27;s pilot episode, actors Tina Caspary and Hunter Carson played the roles of Kelly and Bud Bundy, respectively. Before the series aired publicly the roles for the two Bundy children were re-cast. Ed O&#x27;Neill and the show&#x27;s producers worried about a lack of chemistry with the parents and the original actors cast as the children. A re-casting was done and all of the scenes in the pilot with Carson and Caspary were re-shot with David Faustino and Christina Applegate playing Bud and Kelly Bundy.

=== Recurring characters ===
==Development==

The working title of &quot;Married... with Children&quot; was &quot;Not the Cosbys&quot;, as a mockery of family sitcoms that were common on primetime television in the mid-1980s such as &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. Creators Ron Leavitt and Michael G. Moye were told by Garth Ancier and other Fox executives &quot;to be as outrageous as they could be, doing the sort of material the Big Three would never allow on the air&quot;, wrote Daniel M. Kimmel in 2004. However, Fox CEO Barry Diller had initial doubts that &quot;Married... with Children&quot; would be successful.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
For season 1, Metacritic calculated an average of 58 out of 100 based on 5 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Reviews of the debut episode were mixed. In 1987, Howard Rosenberg of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the casting of the Bundys, found the character development of the D&#x27;Arcys lacking, and warned viewers: &quot;The satire is heavy-handed.&quot; Conversely, also in 1987, Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the debut episode &quot;nasty-minded, overacted and poorly cast&quot;. For &quot;The New York Times&quot;, John J. O&#x27;Connor described it as &quot;loud, coarse and life-of-the-party vulgar&quot;. O&#x27;Connor also compared &quot;Married...&quot; unfavorably to other family shows like &quot;The Life of Riley&quot; and &quot;All in the Family&quot;, describing the show as &quot;pure blue-collar shtick, dressed up with the usual sexual-potency and bathroom jokes&quot;.

===Ratings===

Despite the show&#x27;s enduring popularity and fanbase, &quot;Married... with Children&quot; was never a major ratings success. Part of the reason was that Fox, a startup network, did not have the affiliate base of the Big Three television networks, thus preventing the series from reaching the entire country. In an interview for a special commemorating the series&#x27; 20-year anniversary in 2007, Katey Sagal stated that part of the problem the series faced was that many areas of the country were able to get Fox only through low-quality UHF channels well into the early 1990s, while some areas of the country did not receive the new network at all, a problem not largely rectified until the launch of Foxnet in June 1991 and later the network&#x27;s acquisition of National Football League rights which led to several stations across the United States changing affiliations. For instance, Ed O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s hometown of Youngstown, Ohio did not have its own Fox affiliate until CBS affiliate WKBN-TV signed on WFXI-CA/WYFX-LP in 1998, one year after the show went off the air (the area was served by WPGH-TV in Pittsburgh and Cleveland&#x27;s Fox affiliates—initially WOIO, then WJW—as default affiliates on cable), so many of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s friends and family mistakenly thought he was famous for beer commercials during this time.

Another problem lay in the fact that many of the newly developed series on Fox were unsuccessful, which kept the network from building a popular lineup to draw in a larger audience. In its original airing debut, &quot;Married... with Children&quot; was part of a Sunday lineup that competed with the popular &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; and Sunday-night movie on CBS. Fellow freshman series included &quot;Duet&quot;, cancelled in 1989, along with &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot; and &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, both of which were canceled in 1990. The success of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, which debuted on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; in 1987, helped draw some viewers over to Fox, allowing &quot;Married... with Children&quot; to rank in the Nielsen Top 50 from Season 4 through Season 8, peaking at No. 37 in Season 6. Although these ratings were somewhat small in comparison with the other three networks, they were good enough for Fox to keep renewing the show. In its prime in the early 1990s, the show was averaging over 20 million viewers each week.

While the series did not end on a cliffhanger, it was expected to be renewed for a 12th season (which would have been the final season) and thus did not have a proper series finale when Fox decided to cancel it in 1997. With Fox announcing the cancellation publicly before informing the cast and crew, most if not all of them found out about the series cancellation from fans and low-level employees instead of from network executives. Katey Sagal stated that she constantly felt that the series was neglected by Fox despite helping bring the fledgling network on the map (&quot;Married... with Children&quot; having been on even before &quot;The Simpsons&quot;); for his part, Ed O&#x27;Neill attributed possible neglect of the series by Fox to constant turnover of some of the top positions at the network. In a 2013 interview, O&#x27;Neill stated that he felt TV stations who owned syndication rights to the series put pressure on Fox and Sony Pictures Television to end the series since the show had nearly three times the episodes needed for syndication and the production of more episodes would have resulted in higher rights fees.

=== Controversy and legacy ===
The sexual humor and depiction of family life on &quot;Married... with Children&quot; were controversial from its debut. Daniel M. Kimmel reflected on the show in 2004: &quot;It had achieved a cult status as a somewhat tasteless family sitcom that was so well written and acted that some actually saw it as dark satire of modern suburban life rather than simply an unending stream of sex jokes.&quot; In 2007, &quot;Time&quot; TV critic James Poniewozik, in ranking the show among the 100 greatest of all time, called it &quot;a twisted mirror of TV&#x27;s instant-gratification culture...suitable for a medieval morality play.&quot; Poniewozik concluded about the characterization of the show: &quot;Zestily lowbrow and sex-obsessed, &quot;Married&quot; was dedicated to the classical ideal that unhappy families were more interesting than happy ones... and a lot funnier.&quot; Reviewing Sony&#x27;s original DVD release of the first season in 2003, Aaron Belerle of DVD Talk reflected that the show&#x27;s humor &quot;doesn&#x27;t seem so edgy anymore&quot;.

In 1989, Terry Rakolta from Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, attempted to lead a boycott of the show after viewing the episode &quot;Her Cups Runneth Over&quot;. Offended by the images of an old man wearing a woman&#x27;s garter and stockings, the scene in which Steve touches the pasties of a mannequin dressed in S&amp;M gear, a homosexual man wearing a tiara on his head (and Al&#x27;s line &quot;...and they wonder why we call them &#x27;queens), and a half-nude woman who takes off her bra in front of Al (and is shown with her arms covering her bare chest in the next shot), Rakolta began a letter-writing campaign to advertisers, demanding they boycott the show.

Rakolta&#x27;s campaign resulted in Gillette, Warner–Lambert, and Coca-Cola ending sponsorships; ironically, Coca-Cola owned the studio that produced the show, Columbia Pictures Television. Fox pulled the episode titled &quot;I&#x27;ll See You in Court&quot; (in which the Bundys attempt to improve their love life by having marital relations in a different setting). This episode became known as the &quot;Lost Episode&quot; and was aired on FX on June 18, 2002, with some parts cut. The episode was packaged with the rest of the third season in the January 2005 DVD release (and in the first volume of the &quot;Married ... With Children Most Outrageous Episodes&quot; DVD set) with the parts cut from syndication restored.

Viewers&#x27; curiosity over the boycott and over the show itself led to a drastic ratings boost. Rakolta has been alluded to twice on the show: &quot;Rock and Roll Girl&quot;, in which a newscaster mentions the city Bloomfield Hills, and &quot;No Pot to Pease In&quot;, in which a television show is made about the Bundy family and then cancelled because, as Marcy stated, &quot;some woman in Michigan didn&#x27;t like it.&quot;

Socially conservative criticisms of the show were not limited to Rakolta. The Media Research Center named &quot;Married... with Children&quot; the worst show of the 1995–96 television season, calling it the &quot;crudest comedy on prime time television&quot; for &quot;lewd punch lines&quot;. Republican U.S. Senator Jesse Helms called the show &quot;trash&quot;. Fellow Senator Joe Lieberman (D-CT) also strongly criticized the sitcom, after having walked in on his stepson and young daughter watching an episode one evening in late 1993. In an interview many years later, Lieberman would specifically cite &quot;Married...With Children&quot; as the impetus for his becoming a vocal opponent of pop culture and the entertainment industry throughout his Senate career.

However, the show was recognized for giving women prominent roles behind the scenes. Producers decided to rewrite the sixth season storyline of Peggy&#x27;s pregnancy, which coincided with Sagal&#x27;s actual pregnancy, as a dream that Al had. This was done to prevent Sagal from suffering further trauma by having her character Peggy interact with a new baby, when Sagal&#x27;s pregnancy ended with her going into premature labor and the baby being stillborn. Bearse showed she was a talented director as well as an actress by moving to the director&#x27;s chair and directing her co-stars for over 30 episodes of the series between 1991 and 1997. Bearse also became one of the first mainstream actresses to publicly come out as lesbian, which she did during the series run and received positive recognition for doing so. In 2024, Ed O’Neill said that his misconceptions about Bearse&#x27;s lesbianism was one of the reasons behind the casts&#x27; later breakup.

On April 22, 2012, Fox re-aired the series premiere in commemoration of its 25th anniversary.

== Episodes ==


During its 11-season run on the Fox network, &quot;Married... with Children&quot; aired 258 episodes. A 259th episode, &quot;I&#x27;ll See You in Court&quot; from season 3, never aired on Fox, but premiered on FX and has since been included on DVD and in syndication packages. Three specials also aired following the series&#x27; cancellation, including a cast reunion.

== Home media ==
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has released all 11 seasons of &quot;Married... with Children&quot; on DVD in Regions 1, 2, &amp; 4. On December 12, 2010, Sony released a complete series set on DVD in Region 1.

In December 2007, the Big Bundy Box—a special collection box with all seasons plus new interviews with Sagal and David Faustino—was released. This boxset was released in Australia (Region 4) on November 23, 2009.

The Sony DVD box sets from season 3 onward do not feature the original &quot;Love and Marriage&quot; theme song in the opening sequence. This was done because Sony was unable to obtain the licensing rights to the song for later sets. Despite this, the end credits on the DVDs for season 3 still include a credit for &quot;Love and Marriage.&quot;

On August 27, 2013, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the home media rights to various television series from the Sony Pictures library including &quot;Married... with Children&quot; with the original theme song &quot;Love and Marriage&quot; sung by Frank Sinatra. They have subsequently re-released the 11 seasons on DVD. The Mill Creek Entertainment version (along with the versions available for streaming and downloading) include scenes that are normally edited in syndication and most of the licensed music that&#x27;s dubbed over or deleted due to copyright issues. A Complete Series DVD set was re-released on July 7, 2015, in Region 1. All seasons of &quot;Married... with Children&quot; are now available for online download and streaming through Amazon, Apple iTunes, Peacock, Hulu, and Vudu.

== International remakes ==
;Armenia
An Armenian remake was made in 2016, called &quot;The Azizyans&quot;. The Azizyans is an Armenian sitcom television series developed by Robert Martirosyan and Van Grigoryan. The series premiered on Armenia TV on October 31, 2016. However, the series was not available to the public until Armenia TV started airing the sitcom from October 10, 2017. The series takes place in Yerevan, Armenia. The Azizyans sitcom is starred by Hayk Marutyan. He embodies the character of Garnik Azizyan – a clothes store seller, who is the only one working in the family. Mrs. Ruzan Azizyan is lazy enough to perform the duties of a housewife.

The problems of the father of the family do not bother his 3 children – his daughter, who is internet-addicted and is active in all social networks; his unemployed eldest son, who is a complete loser, and his youngest son, who is a schoolboy. The roles in this sitcom, created for family watching, are played by Ani Lupe, Satenik Hazaryan, Ishkhan Gharibyan, Suren Arustamyan and other popular Armenian actors. The project is directed by Arman Marutyan. In the second season of the sitcom, the Azizyan family continues to survive thanks to the meager salary of Garnik.

The wife of Garnik – Ruzan, remains in the status of a housewife, without even thinking about finding a job. The elder son of Garnik and Ruzan – Azat, continues to look for a new job, a young man appears in the life of Marie, who is trying to win the girl&#x27;s heart. Their younger son Levon, continues to live his own life and does not understand what he has in common with this family. And their neighbors Irina and Alik continue to be friends with the family, which Azizyans do not quite approve. The only bright spot in the life of the family is their house, which Garnik inherited from his grandfather.

;Argentina
An Argentine remake was made by Telefe in 2005, called &quot;Casados con Hijos&quot;. Two seasons were made (2005 and 2006), totaling 215 episodes and it became a smashing success during the replaying. More than fifteen years after the release, it is still aired on Saturdays at 7:30 pm. The series has been also shown by local channels in Uruguay, Paraguay, and Peru.

The character names are: José &quot;Pepe&quot; Argento (based on Al, played by Guillermo Francella), Mónica &quot;Moni&quot; Argento (based on Peggy, played by Florencia Peña), Paola Argento (based on Kelly, played by Luisana Lopilato), Alfio &quot;Coqui&quot; Argento (based on Bud, played by Darío Lopilato), Dardo and María Elena Fuseneco (based on Jefferson D&#x27;Arcy, Steve Rhoades and Marcy; played by Marcelo de Bellis and Érica Rivas).

;Brazil
In Brazil Rede Bandeirantes made a remake in 1999 with the name &quot;A Guerra dos Pintos&quot; (The War of The Pintos). 52 episodes were recorded but only 22 aired before cancelation.

;Bulgaria
In Bulgaria a remake is aired from March 26, 2012, with the name &quot;Женени с деца в България&quot; (Zheneni s detsa v Bulgaria) (Married with children in Bulgaria).

;Croatia
In Croatia a remake called &quot;Bračne vode&quot; was broadcast from September 2008 until November 2009 on Nova TV channel. The characters based on the Bundys were called Zvonimir, Sunčica, Kristina and Boris Bandić while the ones based on Marcy and Steve were called Marica and Ivan Kumarica.

;Germany
In Germany, the 1992 remake &quot;Hilfe, meine Familie spinnt&quot;, broadcast in the prime time, reached double the audience of the original (broadcast in the early fringe time). This, however, was not enough to maintain the series, so it was cancelled after one season with 26 episodes. The remake used the exact translated scripts of the original series (which already substituted localised humour and in-jokes for incomprehensible references to American TV shows not shown in Germany, as well as some totally different jokes) and just renamed places and people according to the new setting. It had a rerun twice on Super RTL in 1996 and 1997.

&quot; was aired from March to December 1993 for 26 episodes.

;Hungary
In 2006, Hungarian TV network TV2 purchased the license rights including scripts and hired the original producers from Sony Pictures for a remake of the show placed in a Hungarian environment. It was entitled &quot; (in English: &quot;Married with children in Budapest&quot;, loan translation: &quot;A gruesomely decent family in Budapest&quot;). The main story began with the new family called the Bándis inheriting an outskirt house from their American relatives the Bundys. They filmed a whole season of 26 episodes, all of them being remade versions of the plots of the original first seasons. It was the highest budget sitcom ever made in Hungary. First it was aired on Tuesday nights, but was beaten by a new season of &quot;ER&quot;, then placed to Wednesday nights. The remake lost its viewers, but stayed on the air due to the contract between Sony and TV2. Also the Hungarian critics have strongly condemned the copyright infringement of the original series. They also criticized the lack of quality and the dilettante forcing of the American cliches in Eastern European (Hungarian) environment.

;Israel
The complete American series aired in Israel in the 1990s, with reruns of it ever since. There has also been an Israeli remake to the show titled &quot;Nesuim Plus&quot; (Married Plus) that aired its two seasons from 2012 to 2017.

;Mexico

In May 2023, Sony Pictures Television announced a Mexican remake for Sony Channel. The series premiered on 8 May 2024 and stars Adrián Uribe and Sandra Echeverría.

;Russia

The Original &quot;Married... With Children&quot; ran on TV-6 Russia in the late 1990s and early 2000s (before the closing of the channel) in prime-time basis, broadcasting the episodes from seasons 1–11. The show later aired on DTV and Domashniy TV. A Russian adaptation, titled &quot;Happy Together&quot; (Schastlivy Vmeste; &quot;Happy Together&quot;), was broadcast on TNT across the country in 2006.

The character names are: Gena Bukin (based on Al, played by Viktor Loginov), Dasha Bukina (based on Peggy, played by Natalya Bochkareva), Sveta Bukina (based on Kelly, played by Darya Sagalova), Roma Bukin (based on Bud, played by Alexander Yakin), Elena and Anatoliy Poleno (based on Marcy and Jefferson D&#x27;Arcy, played by Yulia Zaharova and Pavel Savinkov), Evgeniy Stepanov (based on Steve Rhoades, played by Aleksey Sekirin), Sema Bukin (based on Seven, played by Ilya Butkovskiy), and Baron Bukin (based on Buck and Lucky, played by Bayra).

;Turkey
A remake was aired in Turkey in 2004 for one season under the name &quot;Evli ve Çocuklu&quot; (Married and with Children), featuring Ege Aydan and Yıldız Kaplan in the roles of Niyazi (based on Al) and Jale (based on Peg) Tonguç. The producer, Med Yapım, has published 10 episodes on YouTube in 2018.

;United Kingdom

ITV had been screening the original &quot;Married... with Children&quot; since 1988. In 1996, the British production company Central Television and Columbia Pictures Television (Columbia TriStar Central Productions) produced a British version called Married for Life, which lasted for one series with seven episodes.

== Spin-offs ==
&quot;Top of the Heap&quot; was a sitcom starring Matt LeBlanc. The show was about Vinnie Verducci (played by LeBlanc) and his father Charlie (played by Joseph Bologna) always trying get rich quick schemes. The Verduccis were introduced in an earlier episode where Vinnie dated Kelly Bundy, and Charlie was introduced as an old friend of Al Bundy&#x27;s. The end of the pilot episode shows Al breaking into their apartment and stealing their TV to replace the one he lost betting on Vinnie in a boxing match. However, the show did not last long and was ultimately cancelled. It had its own spin-off/sequel called &quot;Vinnie &amp; Bobby&quot; a year later, which was also cancelled.

Also, an attempt was made to make a spin-off out of David Garrison&#x27;s Steve Rhoades character which took place on Bud&#x27;s Trumaine University. The spin-off was called &quot;Radio Free Trumaine&quot; where Garrison played the Dean. &quot;Enemies&quot; was another spin-off, but played to be a spoof on the TV series &quot;Friends&quot;. Meanwhile, a proposed series focusing on the NO MA&#x27;AM group without Al Bundy was outright rejected by Fox over fears of misogyny.

On September 11, 2014, it was announced that a spin-off was in the works, centered on the character of Bud Bundy. Ed O&#x27;Neill revealed plot details for the proposed spin-off in 2016: &quot;Bud is now grown up and living in the old house with some of his buddies, but they&#x27;re all bust-outs, they aren&#x27;t working. His ex-wife is living in one of the bedrooms with Bud&#x27;s best friend [...] Peg and Al are retired and living in Vegas; they won the lottery.&quot;

== Animated revival ==
On May 13, 2022, &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that an animated revival of the series was currently in the works with the original cast attached to return. It was further revealed that Sony Pictures Television had been working on the animated series for over a year and waited until they had closed deals with the cast before presenting it to networks and streamers. It was felt that an animated revival worked best due to the original cast&#x27;s busy schedule as well as Applegate being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2021, making an animated revival more feasible due to the cast&#x27;s schedules and Applegate&#x27;s physical limitations. Applegate confirmed in a 2023 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; interview that she, O&#x27;Neill, Sagal, and Faustino remained attached to the revival and were just waiting.

A sample clip of the animated series leaked onto the internet on May 14, 2024, along with a synopsis and presentation web site.

== Memoir ==
In April 2024, a memoir, &quot;Married... with Children vs. the World&quot;, written by &quot;Married... with Children&quot; writer and producer Richard Gurman, was published by Permuted Press. In it, Gurman gives a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of the show and his time working on it. The show&#x27;s cast also contributed to the book.

== U.S. syndication and international airings ==

Distributed by Columbia Pictures Television Distribution, later Sony Pictures Television since 2002, &quot;Married... with Children&quot; debuted in off-network syndication in the fall of 1991. The series later began airing on cable on FX from September 1999 until September 2008. In June 2002, FX became the first television network to air the controversial, previously banned episode &quot;I&#x27;ll See You in Court&quot;, albeit in an edited format. The full version of &quot;I&#x27;ll See You in Court&quot; can only be seen on the DVD release &quot;Married... with Children: The Most Outrageous Episodes Volume 1&quot; and the Mill Creek Entertainment complete series collection. The version found on the Third Season DVD set under Sony is the edited-for-TV version. In 2008, the Spike network reportedly paid US$12 million for broadcast rights to every episode including the unedited version of the infamous episode &quot;I&#x27;ll See You in Court&quot;.

Following its acquisition by Nexstar Media Group and rebrand to NewsNation, the network indicated it would start rolling off its non-news programming as those contracts expire to expand news coverage. In November 2018, the entire 11-season run became available to watch through Hulu. On September 17, 2018, GetTV began airing the show and continued until around 2020 or 2021. In July 2024, Cozi TV acquired the rights to the show along with &quot;The King of Queens&quot; and began airing on August 5, 2024.

&quot;Married...with Children&quot; has also been a ratings success in other countries around the world.
== Locations ==
The opening footage comprises views of Chicago, opening with a shot of Buckingham Fountain in Grant Park. The aerial downtown shot was taken from the Lake Shore Drive section north of the Loop. The expressway entrance shot was taken from the 1983 movie &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; featuring the Griswolds&#x27; green family truckster with a northeastward view of the Dan Ryan/Stevenson junction southwest of the Loop. The exterior shot used for the Bundys&#x27; house was taken in a subdivision in Deerfield, Illinois. Non-English versions might differ, e.g. the dubbed German version always includes the expressway shot.

<text>The metre (or meter in US spelling; symbol: m) is the base unit of length in the International System of Units (SI). Since 2019, the metre has been defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of of a second, where the second is defined by a hyperfine transition frequency of caesium.

The metre was originally defined in 1791 by the French National Assembly as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole along a great circle, so the Earth&#x27;s polar circumference is approximately .

In 1799, the metre was redefined in terms of a prototype metre bar. The bar used was changed in 1889, and in 1960 the metre was redefined in terms of a certain number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of krypton-86. The current definition was adopted in 1983 and modified slightly in 2002 to clarify that the metre is a measure of proper length. From 1983 until 2019, the metre was formally defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum in of a second. After the 2019 revision of the SI, this definition was rephrased to include the definition of a second in terms of the caesium frequency . This series of amendments did not alter the size of the metre significantly – today Earth&#x27;s polar circumference measures , a change of about 200 parts per million from the original value of exactly , which also includes improvements in the accuracy of measuring the circumference.

== Spelling ==

&quot;Metre&quot; is the standard spelling of the metric unit for length in nearly all English-speaking nations, the exceptions being the United States and the Philippines which use &quot;meter&quot;.

Measuring devices (such as ammeter, speedometer) are spelled &quot;-meter&quot; in all variants of English. The suffix &quot;-meter&quot; has the same Greek origin as the unit of length.

== Etymology ==
The etymological roots of &quot;metre&quot; can be traced to the Greek verb () ((I) measure, count or compare) and noun () (a measure), which were used for physical measurement, for poetic metre and by extension for moderation or avoiding extremism (as in &quot;be measured in your response&quot;). This range of uses is also found in Latin (), French (), English and other languages. The Greek word is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;&quot; &#x27;to measure&#x27;. The motto () in the seal of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), was approuved by Adolphe Hirsch on 11 July 1875 and may be translated as &quot;Keep the measure&quot;, thus calls for both measurement and moderation. The use of the word &quot;metre&quot; (for the French unit ) in English began at least as early as 1797.

== History of definition ==
== Early adoptions of the metre internationally ==

In France, the metre was adopted as an exclusive measure in 1801 under the Consulate. This continued under the First French Empire until 1812, when Napoleon decreed the introduction of the non-decimal &quot;mesures usuelles&quot;, which remained in use in France up to 1840 in the reign of Louis Philippe. Meanwhile, the metre was adopted by the Republic of Geneva. After the joining of the canton of Geneva to Switzerland in 1815, Guillaume Henri Dufour published the first official Swiss map, for which the metre was adopted as the unit of length.

=== Adoption dates by country ===
* France: 1801–1812, then 1840
* Republic of Geneva, Switzerland: 1813
* Kingdom of the Netherlands: 1820
* Kingdom of Belgium: 1830
* Chile: 1848
* Kingdom of Sardinia, Italy: 1850
* Spain: 1852
* Portugal: 1852
* Colombia: 1853
* Ecuador: 1856
* Mexico: 1857
* Brazil: 1862
* Argentina: 1863
* Italy: 1863
* United States: 1866
* German Empire, Germany: 1872
* Austria, 1875
* Switzerland: 1877

== SI prefixed forms of metre ==

SI prefixes can be used to denote decimal multiples and submultiples of the metre, as shown in the table below. Long distances are usually expressed in km, astronomical units (149.6 Gm), light-years (10 Pm), or parsecs (31 Pm), rather than in Mm or larger multiples; &quot;30 cm&quot;, &quot;30 m&quot;, and &quot;300 m&quot; are more common than &quot;3 dm&quot;, &quot;3 dam&quot;, and &quot;3 hm&quot;, respectively.

The terms &quot;micron&quot; and &quot;millimicron&quot; have been used instead of &quot;micrometre&quot; (μm) and &quot;nanometre&quot; (nm), respectively, but this practice is discouraged.

== Equivalents in other units ==

Within this table, &quot;inch&quot; and &quot;yard&quot; mean &quot;international inch&quot; and &quot;international yard&quot; respectively, though approximate conversions in the left column hold for both international and survey units.
: &quot;≈&quot; means &quot;is approximately equal to&quot;;
: &quot;=&quot; means &quot;is exactly equal to&quot;.

One metre is exactly equivalent to  inches and to  yards.
A simple mnemonic to assist with conversion is &quot;three 3s&quot;: 1 metre is nearly equivalent to 3 feet  inches. This gives an overestimate of 0.125 mm.

The ancient Egyptian cubit was about 0.5 m (surviving rods are 523–529 mm). Scottish and English definitions of the ell (2 cubits) were 941 mm (0.941 m) and 1143 mm (1.143 m) respectively. The ancient Parisian &quot;toise&quot; (fathom) was slightly shorter than 2 m and was standardised at exactly 2 m in the mesures usuelles system, such that 1 m was exactly  toise. The Russian verst was 1.0668 km. The Swedish mil was 10.688 km, but was changed to 10 km when Sweden converted to metric units.

<text>Mentha, also known as mint (from Greek , Linear B &quot;mi-ta&quot;), is a genus of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is estimated that 13 to 24 species exist, but the exact distinction between species is unclear. Hybridization occurs naturally where some species&#x27; ranges overlap. Many hybrids and cultivars are known.

The genus has a subcosmopolitan distribution, growing best in wet environments and moist soils.

==Description==

Mints are aromatic, almost exclusively perennial herbs. They have wide-spreading underground and overground stolons and erect, square, branched stems. Mints will grow 10–120 cm (4–48 inches) tall and can spread over an indeterminate area. Due to their tendency to spread unchecked, some mints are considered invasive.

The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, from oblong to lanceolate, often downy, and with a serrated margin. Leaf colors range from dark green and gray-green to purple, blue, and sometimes pale yellow.

The flowers are produced in long bracts from leaf axils. They are white to purple and produced in false whorls called verticillasters. The corolla is two-lipped with four subequal lobes, the upper lobe usually the largest. The fruit is a nutlet, containing one to four seeds.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Mentha&quot; is a member of the tribe Mentheae in the subfamily Nepetoideae. The tribe contains about 65 genera, and relationships within it remain obscure. Authors have disagreed on the circumscription of &quot;Mentha&quot;. For example, &quot;M. cervina&quot; has been placed in &quot;Pulegium&quot; and &quot;Preslia&quot;, and &quot;M. cunninghamii&quot; has been placed in &quot;Micromeria&quot;. In 2004, a molecular phylogenetic study indicated that both &quot;M. cervina&quot; and &quot;M. cunninghamii&quot; should be included in &quot;Mentha&quot;. However, &quot;M. cunninghamii&quot; was excluded in a 2007 treatment of the genus.

More than 3,000 names have been published in the genus &quot;Mentha&quot;, at ranks from species to forms, the majority of which are regarded as synonyms or illegitimate names. The taxonomy of the genus is made difficult because many species hybridize readily, or are themselves derived from possibly ancient hybridization events. Seeds from hybrids give rise to variable offspring, which may spread through vegetative propagation. The variability has led to what has been described as &quot;paroxysms of species and subspecific taxa&quot;; for example, one taxonomist published 434 new mint taxa for central Europe alone between 1911 and 1916. Recent sources recognize between 18 and 24 species.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The genus has a subcosmopolitan distribution across Europe, Africa – (Southern Africa), Asia, Australia – Oceania, North America and South America. Its species can be found in many environments, but most grow best in wet environments and moist soils.

== Ecology ==
Mints are used as food by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including buff ermine moths, and by beetles, such as &quot;Chrysolina coerulans&quot; (blue mint beetle) and &quot;C. herbacea&quot; (mint leaf beetle).

=== Diseases ===
== Cultivation ==
All mints thrive near pools of water, lakes, rivers, and cool moist spots in partial shade. In general, mints tolerate a wide range of conditions, and can also be grown in full sun. Mint grows all year round.

They are fast-growing, extending their reach along surfaces through a network of runners. Due to their speedy growth, one plant of each desired mint, along with a little care, will provide more than enough mint for home use. Some mint species are more invasive than others. Even with the less invasive mints, care should be taken when mixing any mint with any other plants, lest the mint take over. To control mints in an open environment, they should be planted in deep, bottomless containers sunk in the ground, or planted above ground in tubs and barrels.

Some mints can be propagated by seed, but growth from seed can be an unreliable method for raising mint for two reasons: mint seeds are highly variable (i.e. one might not end up with what was supposedly planted) and some mint varieties are sterile. It is more effective to take and plant cuttings from the runners of healthy mints.

The most common and popular mints for commercial cultivation are peppermint (&quot;Mentha × piperita&quot;), native spearmint (&quot;Mentha spicata&quot;), Scotch spearmint (&quot;Mentha x gracilis&quot;), and cornmint (&quot;Mentha arvensis&quot;); also (more recently) apple mint (&quot;Mentha suaveolens&quot;).

Mints are supposed to make good companion plants, repelling insect pests and attracting beneficial ones. They are susceptible to whitefly and aphids.

Harvesting of mint leaves can be done at any time. Fresh leaves should be used immediately or stored up to a few days in plastic bags in a refrigerator. Optionally, leaves can be frozen in ice cube trays. Dried mint leaves should be stored in an airtight container placed in a cool, dark, dry area.

==Uses==
===Culinary===

The leaf, fresh or dried, is the culinary source of mint. Fresh mint is usually preferred over dried mint when storage of the mint is not a problem. The leaves have a warm, fresh, aromatic, sweet flavor with a cool aftertaste, and are used in teas, beverages, jellies, syrups, candies, and ice creams. In Middle Eastern cuisine, mint is used in lamb dishes, while in British cuisine and American cuisine, mint sauce and mint jelly are used, respectively. Mint (pudina) is a staple in Indian cuisine, used for flavouring curries and other dishes.

Mint is a necessary ingredient in Touareg tea, a popular tea in northern African and Arab countries. Alcoholic drinks sometimes feature mint for flavor or garnish, such as the mint julep and the mojito. &quot;Crème de menthe&quot; is a mint-flavored liqueur used in drinks such as the grasshopper.

Mint essential oil and menthol are extensively used as flavorings in breath fresheners, drinks, antiseptic mouth rinses, toothpaste, chewing gum, desserts, and candies, such as mint (candy) and mint chocolate. The substances that give the mints their characteristic aromas and flavors are menthol (the main aroma of peppermint and Japanese peppermint) and pulegone (in pennyroyal and Corsican mint). The compound primarily responsible for the aroma and flavor of spearmint is -carvone.

===Traditional medicine and cosmetics===
The ancient Greeks rubbed mint on their arms, believing it would make them stronger. Mint was originally used as a medicinal herb to treat stomach ache and chest pains. There are several uses in traditional medicine and preliminary research for possible use of peppermint in treating irritable bowel syndrome.

Menthol from mint essential oil (40–90%) is an ingredient of many cosmetics and some perfumes. Menthol and mint essential oil are also used in aromatherapy which may have clinical use to alleviate post-surgery nausea.

====Allergic reaction====
Although it is used in many consumer products, mint may cause allergic reactions in some people, inducing symptoms such as abdominal cramps, diarrhea, headaches, heartburn, tingling or numbing around the mouth, anaphylaxis, or contact dermatitis.

===Insecticides===
Mint oil is also used as an environmentally friendly insecticide for its ability to kill some common pests such as wasps, hornets, ants, and cockroaches.

===Room scent and aromatherapy===
Known in Greek mythology as the herb of hospitality, one of mint&#x27;s first known uses in Europe was as a room deodorizer. The herb was strewn across floors to cover the smell of the hard-packed soil. Stepping on the mint helped to spread its scent through the room. Today, it is more commonly used for aromatherapy through the use of essential oils.

== Etymology of &quot;mint&quot; ==
The word &quot;mint&quot; descends from the Latin word &quot;mentha&quot; or &quot;menta&quot;, which is rooted in the Greek words &quot;mintha&quot;, &quot;minthē&quot; or  &quot;mintē&quot; meaning &quot;spearmint&quot;. The plant was personified in Greek mythology as Minthe, a nymph who was beloved by Hades and was transformed into a mint plant by either Persephone or Demeter. This, in turn, ultimately derived from a proto-Indo-European root that is also the origin of the Sanskrit &quot;-mantha, mathana&quot; (&quot;premna serratifolia&quot;).

References to &quot;mint leaves&quot;, without a qualifier like &quot;peppermint&quot; or &quot;apple mint&quot;, generally refer to spearmint leaves.

In Spain and Central and South America, mint is known as &quot;menta&quot;. In Lusophone countries, especially in Portugal, mint species are popularly known as &quot;hortelã&quot;. In many Indo-Aryan languages, it is called &quot;pudīna&quot;: , , , borrowed from Persian &quot;pudna&quot; or &quot;puna&quot; meaning &quot;pennyroyal&quot;.

The taxonomic family Lamiaceae is known as the mint family. It includes many other aromatic herbs, including most of the more common cooking herbs, such as basil, rosemary, sage, oregano, and catnip.

As an English colloquial term, any small mint-flavored confectionery item can be called a mint.

In common usage, other plants with fragrant leaves may be called &quot;mint&quot;, although they are not in the mint family:
* Vietnamese mint, commonly used in Southeast Asian cuisine is &quot;Persicaria odorata&quot; in the family Polygonaceae, collectively known as smartweeds or pinkweeds.
* Mexican mint marigold is &quot;Tagetes lucida&quot; in the sunflower family (Asteraceae).

==Fossil record==
&quot;Mentha pliocenica&quot; fossil seeds have been excavated in Pliocene deposits of Dvorets on the right bank of the Dnieper river between the cities of Rechitsa and Loyew, in south-eastern Belarus. The fossil seeds are similar to the seeds of &quot;Mentha aquatica&quot; and &quot;Mentha arvensis&quot;.

<text>Marjoram (, Origanum majorana) is a cold-sensitive perennial herb or undershrub with sweet pine and citrus flavours. In some Middle Eastern countries, marjoram is synonymous with oregano, and there the names sweet marjoram and knotted marjoram are used to distinguish it from other plants of the genus &quot;Origanum&quot;. It is also called pot marjoram, although this name is also used for other cultivated species of &quot;Origanum&quot;.

==History==
Marjoram is indigenous to Cyprus, the Mediterranean, Turkey, Western Asia, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Levant, and was known to the ancient Greeks and Romans as a symbol of happiness. It may have spread to the British Isles during the Middle Ages. Marjoram was not widely used in the United States until after World War II.

The name marjoram (Old French: &quot;majorane&quot;; ) does not directly derive from the Latin word (major).

Marjoram is related to Samhain, the Celtic pagan holiday that would eventually become Halloween. It has also been used in Sephardi Jewish tradition as a ritual medical practice. Ancient Greeks believed the plant was created by Aphrodite. In one myth, the royal perfumer of Cyprus, Amaracus, was transformed into marjoram. To the Romans the herb was known as the herb of happiness, and was believed to increase lifespan. Marjoram is mentioned in De Materia Medica by Pedanius Dioscorides, and was used by Hippocrates as an antiseptic.

==Description==

Leaves are smooth, simple, petiolated, ovate to oblong-ovate, long, wide, with obtuse apex, entire margin, symmetrical but tapering base, and reticulate venation. The texture of the leaf is extremely smooth due to the presence of numerous hairs.

==Cultivation==

Considered a tender perennial (USDA Zones 7–9), marjoram can sometimes prove hardy even in zone 5. Under proper conditions it spreads prolifically, and so is usually grown in pots to prevent it from taking over a garden.

Marjoram is cultivated for its aromatic leaves, either green or dry, for culinary purposes; the tops are cut as the plants begin to flower and are dried slowly in the shade. It is often used in herb combinations such as &quot;herbes de Provence&quot; and &quot;za&#x27;atar&quot;. The flowering leaves and tops of marjoram are steam-distilled to produce an essential oil that is yellowish (darkening to brown as it ages). It has many chemical components, some of which are borneol, camphor, and pinene.
==Related species==
Oregano (&quot;Origanum vulgare&quot;), sometimes listed with marjoram as &quot;O. majorana&quot;, is also called wild marjoram. It is a perennial common in southern Europe and north to Sweden in dry copses and on hedge-banks, with many stout stems high, bearing short-stalked, somewhat ovate leaves and clusters of purple flowers. It has a stronger flavor than marjoram.

Pot marjoram or Cretan oregano (&quot;O. onites&quot;) has similar uses to marjoram.

Hardy marjoram or French/Italian/Sicilian marjoram (&quot;O. × majoricum&quot;), a cross of marjoram with oregano, is much more resistant to cold, but is slightly less sweet.

&quot;O. × hybridum&quot; is known as showy marjoram or showy oregano.
==Uses==
Marjoram is used for seasoning soups, stews, salad dressings, sauces, herbal teas and sausages.

Marjoram has long been used as a medicinal herb. Marjoram or marjoram oil has been used to treat cancer, colds, coughs, cramps, depression, as a diuretic, ear infections, gastrointestinal problems, headaches, and paralysis, as well as arthritis, chest congestion, and muscle aches. It has also been used as an aphrodisiac, mouthwash, tea, and in poultices, tinctures, and infusions. Though not all of its historic uses are scientifically backed, the plant has verifiable medical use. For example, it contains the phenol carvacrol, which is antibacterial, antifungal and antimicrobial. Ethanol extract is cytotoxic against fibrosarcoma cell lines, ethyl acetate extract has antiproliferative properties against PER.C6 and HeLa cells, as have hesperetin and hydroquinone, which can be isolated from marjoram extract. Cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, antiulcerogenetic, anticholinesterase, anti-polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and anti-inflammatory effects were also found in dried marjoram, marjoram tea, or in compounds extracted from marjoram. Marjoram is generally not toxic, but should not be used by pregnant or lactating women. However, it is always important to be cautious and consult a doctor when using medical herbs.

==Symbolism==
It is used by the clown Lavatch in &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; (IV.5) to describe Helena and his regret at her apparent death: 

:&quot;she was the sweet marjoram of the salad, or rather, the herb of grace.&quot;

<text>Medicine is the science and practice of caring for patients, managing the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, treatment, palliation of their injury or disease, and promoting their health. Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.

Medicine has been practiced since prehistoric times, and for most of this time it was an art (an area of creativity and skill), frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries, since the advent of modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied, under the umbrella of medical science). For example, while stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice, knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science.

Prescientific forms of medicine, now known as traditional medicine or &quot;folk medicine&quot;, remain commonly used in the absence of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine. Alternative treatments outside of scientific medicine with ethical, safety and efficacy concerns are termed quackery.
== Etymology ==

Medicine (, ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. The word &quot;&quot; is derived from Latin , meaning &quot;a physician&quot;. The word &quot;&quot; itself, from which &quot;&quot; derives, was the old word for what is now called a medicine, and also the field of medicine.

== Clinical practice ==
Medical availability and clinical practice vary across the world due to regional differences in culture and technology. Modern scientific medicine is highly developed in the Western world, while in developing countries such as parts of Africa or Asia, the population may rely more heavily on traditional medicine with limited evidence and efficacy and no required formal training for practitioners.

In the developed world, evidence-based medicine is not universally used in clinical practice; for example, a 2007 survey of literature reviews found that about 49% of the interventions lacked sufficient evidence to support either benefit or harm.

In modern clinical practice, physicians and physician assistants personally assess patients to diagnose, prognose, treat, and prevent disease using clinical judgment. The doctor-patient relationship typically begins with an interaction with an examination of the patient&#x27;s medical history and medical record, followed by a medical interview and a physical examination. Basic diagnostic medical devices (e.g., stethoscope, tongue depressor) are typically used. After examining for signs and interviewing for symptoms, the doctor may order medical tests (e.g., blood tests), take a biopsy, or prescribe pharmaceutical drugs or other therapies. Differential diagnosis methods help to rule out conditions based on the information provided. During the encounter, properly informing the patient of all relevant facts is an important part of the relationship and the development of trust. The medical encounter is then documented in the medical record, which is a legal document in many jurisdictions. Follow-ups may be shorter but follow the same general procedure, and specialists follow a similar process. The diagnosis and treatment may take only a few minutes or a few weeks, depending on the complexity of the issue.

The components of the medical interview and encounter are:
* Chief complaint (CC): the reason for the current medical visit. These are the &quot;symptoms&quot;. They are in the patient&#x27;s own words and are recorded along with the duration of each one. Also called &quot;chief concern&quot; or &quot;presenting complaint&quot;.
* Current activity: occupation, hobbies, what the patient actually does.
* Family history (FH): listing of diseases in the family that may impact the patient. A family tree is sometimes used.
* History of present illness (HPI): the chronological order of events of symptoms and further clarification of each symptom. Distinguishable from history of previous illness, often called past medical history (PMH). Medical history comprises HPI and PMH.
* Medications (Rx): what drugs the patient takes including prescribed, over-the-counter, and home remedies, as well as alternative and herbal medicines or remedies. Allergies are also recorded.
* Past medical history (PMH/PMHx): concurrent medical problems, past hospitalizations and operations, injuries, past infectious diseases or vaccinations, history of known allergies.
* Review of systems (ROS) or &quot;systems inquiry&quot;: a set of additional questions to ask, which may be missed on HPI: a general enquiry (have you noticed any weight loss, change in sleep quality, fevers, lumps and bumps? etc.), followed by questions on the body&#x27;s main organ systems (heart, lungs, digestive tract, urinary tract, etc.).
* Social history (SH): birthplace, residences, marital history, social and economic status, habits (including diet, medications, tobacco, alcohol).

The physical examination is the examination of the patient for medical signs of disease that are objective and observable, in contrast to symptoms that are volunteered by the patient and are not necessarily objectively observable. The healthcare provider uses sight, hearing, touch, and sometimes smell (e.g., in infection, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis). Four actions are the basis of physical examination: inspection, palpation (feel), percussion (tap to determine resonance characteristics), and auscultation (listen), generally in that order, although auscultation occurs prior to percussion and palpation for abdominal assessments.

The clinical examination involves the study of:
* Abdomen and rectum
* Cardiovascular (heart and blood vessels)
* General appearance of the patient and specific indicators of disease (nutritional status, presence of jaundice, pallor or clubbing)
* Genitalia (and pregnancy if the patient is or could be pregnant)
* Head, eye, ear, nose, and throat (HEENT)
* Musculoskeletal (including spine and extremities)
* Neurological (consciousness, awareness, brain, vision, cranial nerves, spinal cord and peripheral nerves)
* Psychiatric (orientation, mental state, mood, evidence of abnormal perception or thought).
* Respiratory (large airways and lungs)
* Skin
* Vital signs including height, weight, body temperature, blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and hemoglobin oxygen saturation

It is to likely focus on areas of interest highlighted in the medical history and may not include everything listed above.

The treatment plan may include ordering additional medical laboratory tests and medical imaging studies, starting therapy, referral to a specialist, or watchful observation. A follow-up may be advised. Depending upon the health insurance plan and the managed care system, various forms of &quot;utilization review&quot;, such as prior authorization of tests, may place barriers on accessing expensive services.

The medical decision-making (MDM) process includes the analysis and synthesis of all the above data to come up with a list of possible diagnoses (the differential diagnoses), along with an idea of what needs to be done to obtain a definitive diagnosis that would explain the patient&#x27;s problem.

On subsequent visits, the process may be repeated in an abbreviated manner to obtain any new history, symptoms, physical findings, lab or imaging results, or specialist consultations.

== Institutions ==

Contemporary medicine is, in general, conducted within health care systems. Legal, credentialing, and financing frameworks are established by individual governments, augmented on occasion by international organizations, such as churches. The characteristics of any given health care system have a significant impact on the way medical care is provided.

From ancient times, Christian emphasis on practical charity gave rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals, and the Catholic Church today remains the largest non-government provider of medical services in the world. Advanced industrial countries (with the exception of the United States) and many developing countries provide medical services through a system of universal health care that aims to guarantee care for all through a single-payer health care system or compulsory private or cooperative health insurance. This is intended to ensure that the entire population has access to medical care on the basis of need rather than ability to pay. Delivery may be via private medical practices, state-owned hospitals and clinics, or charities, most commonly a combination of all three.

Most tribal societies provide no guarantee of healthcare for the population as a whole. In such societies, healthcare is available to those who can afford to pay for it, have self-insured it (either directly or as part of an employment contract), or may be covered by care financed directly by the government or tribe.

Transparency of information is another factor defining a delivery system. Access to information on conditions, treatments, quality, and pricing greatly affects the choice of patients/consumers and, therefore, the incentives of medical professionals. While the US healthcare system has come under fire for its lack of openness, new legislation may encourage greater openness. There is a perceived tension between the need for transparency on the one hand and such issues as patient confidentiality and the possible exploitation of information for commercial gain on the other.

The health professionals who provide care in medicine comprise multiple professions, such as medics, nurses, physiotherapists, and psychologists. These professions will have their own ethical standards, professional education, and bodies. The medical profession has been conceptualized from a sociological perspective.

=== Delivery ===
Provision of medical care is classified into primary, secondary, and tertiary care categories.
Primary care medical services are provided by physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or other health professionals who have first contact with a patient seeking medical treatment or care. These occur in physician offices, clinics, nursing homes, schools, home visits, and other places close to patients. About 90% of medical visits can be treated by the primary care provider. These include treatment of acute and chronic illnesses, preventive care and health education for all ages and both sexes.

Secondary care medical services are provided by medical specialists in their offices or clinics or at local community hospitals for a patient referred by a primary care provider who first diagnosed or treated the patient. Referrals are made for those patients who required the expertise or procedures performed by specialists. These include both ambulatory care and inpatient services, emergency departments, intensive care medicine, surgery services, physical therapy, labor and delivery, endoscopy units, diagnostic laboratory and medical imaging services, hospice centers, etc. Some primary care providers may also take care of hospitalized patients and deliver babies in a secondary care setting.

Tertiary care medical services are provided by specialist hospitals or regional centers equipped with diagnostic and treatment facilities not generally available at local hospitals. These include trauma centers, burn treatment centers, advanced neonatology unit services, organ transplants, high-risk pregnancy, radiation oncology, etc.

Modern medical care also depends on information – still delivered in many health care settings on paper records, but increasingly nowadays by electronic means.

In low-income countries, modern healthcare is often too expensive for the average person. International healthcare policy researchers have advocated that &quot;user fees&quot; be removed in these areas to ensure access, although even after removal, significant costs and barriers remain.

Separation of prescribing and dispensing is a practice in medicine and pharmacy in which the physician who provides a medical prescription is independent from the pharmacist who provides the prescription drug. In the Western world there are centuries of tradition for separating pharmacists from physicians. In Asian countries, it is traditional for physicians to also provide drugs.

== Branches ==

Working together as an interdisciplinary team, many highly trained health professionals besides medical practitioners are involved in the delivery of modern health care. Examples include: nurses, emergency medical technicians and paramedics, laboratory scientists, pharmacists, podiatrists, physiotherapists, respiratory therapists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, radiographers, dietitians, and bioengineers, medical physicists, surgeons, surgeon&#x27;s assistant, surgical technologist.

The scope and sciences underpinning human medicine overlap many other fields. A patient admitted to the hospital is usually under the care of a specific team based on their main presenting problem, e.g., the cardiology team, who then may interact with other specialties, e.g., surgical, radiology, to help diagnose or treat the main problem or any subsequent complications/developments.

Physicians have many specializations and subspecializations into certain branches of medicine, which are listed below. There are variations from country to country regarding which specialties certain subspecialties are in.

The main branches of medicine are:
* Basic sciences of medicine; this is what every physician is educated in, and some return to in biomedical research.
* Interdisciplinary fields, where different medical specialties are mixed to function in certain occasions.
* Medical specialties

=== Basic sciences ===
* &quot;Anatomy&quot; is the study of the physical structure of organisms. In contrast to &quot;macroscopic&quot; or &quot;gross anatomy&quot;, &quot;cytology&quot; and &quot;histology&quot; are concerned with microscopic structures.
* &quot;Biochemistry&quot; is the study of the chemistry taking place in living organisms, especially the structure and function of their chemical components.
* &quot;Biomechanics&quot; is the study of the structure and function of biological systems by means of the methods of Mechanics.
* &quot;Biophysics&quot; is an interdisciplinary science that uses the methods of physics and physical chemistry to study biological systems.
* &quot;Biostatistics&quot; is the application of statistics to biological fields in the broadest sense. A knowledge of biostatistics is essential in the planning, evaluation, and interpretation of medical research. It is also fundamental to epidemiology and evidence-based medicine.
* &quot;Cytology&quot; is the microscopic study of individual cells.
* &quot;Embryology&quot; is the study of the early development of organisms.
* &quot;Endocrinology&quot; is the study of hormones and their effect throughout the body of animals.
* &quot;Epidemiology&quot; is the study of the demographics of disease processes, and includes, but is not limited to, the study of epidemics.
* &quot;Genetics&quot; is the study of genes, and their role in biological inheritance.
* &quot;Gynecology&quot; is the study of female reproductive system.
* &quot;Histology&quot; is the study of the structures of biological tissues by light microscopy, electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry.
* &quot;Immunology&quot; is the study of the immune system, which includes the innate and adaptive immune system in humans, for example.
* &quot;Lifestyle medicine&quot; is the study of the chronic conditions, and how to prevent, treat and reverse them.
* &quot;Medical physics&quot; is the study of the applications of physics principles in medicine.
* &quot;Microbiology&quot; is the study of microorganisms, including protozoa, bacteria, fungi, and viruses.
* &quot;Molecular biology&quot; is the study of molecular underpinnings of the process of replication, transcription and translation of the genetic material.
* &quot;Neuroscience&quot; includes those disciplines of science that are related to the study of the nervous system. A main focus of neuroscience is the biology and physiology of the human brain and spinal cord. Some related clinical specialties include neurology, neurosurgery and psychiatry.
* &quot;Nutrition science&quot; (theoretical focus) and &quot;dietetics&quot; (practical focus) is the study of the relationship of food and drink to health and disease, especially in determining an optimal diet. Medical nutrition therapy is done by dietitians and is prescribed for diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, weight and eating disorders, allergies, malnutrition, and neoplastic diseases.
* &quot;Pathology as a science&quot; is the study of diseasethe causes, course, progression and resolution thereof.
* &quot;Pharmacology&quot; is the study of drugs and their actions.
* &quot;Photobiology&quot; is the study of the interactions between non-ionizing radiation and living organisms.
* &quot;Physiology&quot; is the study of the normal functioning of the body and the underlying regulatory mechanisms.
* &quot;Radiobiology&quot; is the study of the interactions between ionizing radiation and living organisms.
* &quot;Toxicology&quot; is the study of hazardous effects of drugs and poisons.

=== Specialties ===

In the broadest meaning of &quot;medicine&quot;, there are many different specialties. In the UK, most specialities have their own body or college, which has its own entrance examination. These are collectively known as the Royal Colleges, although not all currently use the term &quot;Royal&quot;. The development of a speciality is often driven by new technology (such as the development of effective anaesthetics) or ways of working (such as emergency departments); the new specialty leads to the formation of a unifying body of doctors and the prestige of administering their own examination.

Within medical circles, specialities usually fit into one of two broad categories: &quot;Medicine&quot; and &quot;Surgery&quot;. &quot;Medicine&quot; refers to the practice of non-operative medicine, and most of its subspecialties require preliminary training in Internal Medicine. In the UK, this was traditionally evidenced by passing the examination for the Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (MRCP) or the equivalent college in Scotland or Ireland. &quot;Surgery&quot; refers to the practice of operative medicine, and most subspecialties in this area require preliminary training in General Surgery, which in the UK leads to membership of the Royal College of Surgeons of England (MRCS). At present, some specialties of medicine do not fit easily into either of these categories, such as radiology, pathology, or anesthesia. Most of these have branched from one or other of the two camps above; for example anaesthesia developed first as a faculty of the Royal College of Surgeons (for which MRCS/FRCS would have been required) before becoming the Royal College of Anaesthetists and membership of the college is attained by sitting for the examination of the Fellowship of the Royal College of Anesthetists (FRCA).

==== Surgical specialty ====
&quot;Surgery&quot; is an ancient medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate or treat a pathological condition such as disease or injury, to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas (for example, a perforated ear drum). Surgeons must also manage pre-operative, post-operative, and potential surgical candidates on the hospital wards. In some centers, anesthesiology is part of the division of surgery (for historical and logistical reasons), although it is not a surgical discipline. Other medical specialties may employ surgical procedures, such as ophthalmology and dermatology, but are not considered surgical sub-specialties per se.

Surgical training in the U.S. requires a minimum of five years of residency after medical school. Sub-specialties of surgery often require seven or more years. In addition, fellowships can last an additional one to three years. Because post-residency fellowships can be competitive, many trainees devote two additional years to research. Thus in some cases surgical training will not finish until more than a decade after medical school. Furthermore, surgical training can be very difficult and time-consuming.

Surgical subspecialties include those a physician may specialize in after undergoing general surgery residency training as well as several surgical fields with separate residency training. Surgical subspecialties that one may pursue following general surgery residency training: &quot;&quot;
* Bariatric surgery
* Cardiovascular surgery – may also be pursued through a separate cardiovascular surgery residency track
* Colorectal surgery
* Endocrine surgery
* General surgery
* Hand surgery
* Hepatico-Pancreatico-Biliary Surgery
* Minimally invasive surgery
* Pediatric surgery
* Plastic surgery – may also be pursued through a separate plastic surgery residency track
* Surgical critical care
* Surgical oncology
* Transplant surgery
* Trauma surgery
* Vascular surgery – may also be pursued through a separate vascular surgery residency track

Other surgical specialties within medicine with their own individual residency training:
* Dermatology
* Neurosurgery
* Ophthalmology
* Oral and maxillofacial surgery
* Orthopedic surgery
* Otorhinolaryngology
* Podiatric surgery – do not undergo medical school training, but rather separate training in podiatry school
* Urology

==== Internal medicine specialty ====

Internal medicine is the medical specialty dealing with the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of adult diseases. According to some sources, an emphasis on internal structures is implied. In North America, specialists in internal medicine are commonly called &quot;internists&quot;. Elsewhere, especially in Commonwealth nations, such specialists are often called physicians. These terms, &quot;internist&quot; or &quot;physician&quot; (in the narrow sense, common outside North America), generally exclude practitioners of gynecology and obstetrics, pathology, psychiatry, and especially surgery and its subspecialities.

Because their patients are often seriously ill or require complex investigations, internists do much of their work in hospitals. Formerly, many internists were not subspecialized; such &quot;general physicians&quot; would see any complex nonsurgical problem; this style of practice has become much less common. In modern urban practice, most internists are subspecialists: that is, they generally limit their medical practice to problems of one organ system or to one particular area of medical knowledge. For example, gastroenterologists and nephrologists specialize respectively in diseases of the gut and the kidneys.

In the Commonwealth of Nations and some other countries, specialist pediatricians and geriatricians are also described as &quot;specialist physicians&quot; (or internists) who have subspecialized by age of patient rather than by organ system. Elsewhere, especially in North America, general pediatrics is often a form of primary care.

There are many subspecialities (or subdisciplines) of internal medicine:

:*&quot;Angiology/Vascular Medicine&quot;
:*&quot;Bariatrics&quot;
:*&quot;Cardiology&quot;
:*&quot;Critical care medicine&quot;
:*&quot;Endocrinology&quot;
:*&quot;Gastroenterology&quot;
:*&quot;Geriatrics&quot;
:*&quot;Hematology&quot;
:*&quot;Hepatology&quot;
:*&quot;Infectious disease&quot;
:*&quot;Nephrology&quot;
:*&quot;Neurology&quot;
:*&quot;Oncology&quot;
:*&quot;Pediatrics&quot;
:*&quot;Pulmonology/Pneumology/Respirology/chest medicine&quot;
:*&quot;Rheumatology&quot;
:*&quot;Sports Medicine&quot;

Training in internal medicine (as opposed to surgical training), varies considerably across the world: see the articles on &quot;medical education&quot; for more details. In North America, it requires at least three years of residency training after medical school, which can then be followed by a one- to three-year fellowship in the subspecialties listed above. In general, resident work hours in medicine are less than those in surgery, averaging about 60 hours per week in the US. This difference does not apply in the UK where all doctors are now required by law to work less than 48 hours per week on average.

==== Diagnostic specialties ====
* &quot;Clinical laboratory sciences&quot; are the clinical diagnostic services that apply laboratory techniques to diagnosis and management of patients. In the United States, these services are supervised by a pathologist. The personnel that work in these medical laboratory departments are technically trained staff who do not hold medical degrees, but who usually hold an undergraduate medical technology degree, who actually perform the tests, assays, and procedures needed for providing the specific services. Subspecialties include transfusion medicine, cellular pathology, clinical chemistry, hematology, clinical microbiology and clinical immunology.
* &quot;Clinical neurophysiology&quot; is concerned with testing the physiology or function of the central and peripheral aspects of the nervous system. These kinds of tests can be divided into recordings of: (1) spontaneous or continuously running electrical activity, or (2) stimulus evoked responses. Subspecialties include electroencephalography, electromyography, evoked potential, nerve conduction study and polysomnography. Sometimes these tests are performed by techs without a medical degree, but the interpretation of these tests is done by a medical professional.
* &quot;Diagnostic radiology&quot; is concerned with imaging of the body, e.g. by x-rays, x-ray computed tomography, ultrasonography, and nuclear magnetic resonance tomography. Interventional radiologists can access areas in the body under imaging for an intervention or diagnostic sampling.
* &quot;Nuclear medicine&quot; is concerned with studying human organ systems by administering radiolabelled substances (radiopharmaceuticals) to the body, which can then be imaged outside the body by a gamma camera or a PET scanner. Each radiopharmaceutical consists of two parts: a tracer that is specific for the function under study (e.g., neurotransmitter pathway, metabolic pathway, blood flow, or other), and a radionuclide (usually either a gamma-emitter or a positron emitter). There is a degree of overlap between nuclear medicine and radiology, as evidenced by the emergence of combined devices such as the PET/CT scanner.
* &quot;Pathology as a medical specialty&quot; is the branch of medicine that deals with the study of diseases and the morphologic, physiologic changes produced by them. As a diagnostic specialty, pathology can be considered the basis of modern scientific medical knowledge and plays a large role in evidence-based medicine. Many modern molecular tests such as flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemistry, cytogenetics, gene rearrangements studies and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) fall within the territory of pathology.

==== Other major specialties ====
The following are some major medical specialties that do not directly fit into any of the above-mentioned groups:
* &quot;Anesthesiology&quot; (also known as &quot;anaesthetics&quot;): concerned with the perioperative management of the surgical patient. The anesthesiologist&#x27;s role during surgery is to prevent derangement in the vital organs&#x27; (i.e. brain, heart, kidneys) functions and postoperative pain. Outside of the operating room, the anesthesiology physician also serves the same function in the labor and delivery ward, and some are specialized in critical medicine.
* &quot;Emergency medicine&quot; is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of acute or life-threatening conditions, including trauma, surgical, medical, pediatric, and psychiatric emergencies.
* &quot;Family medicine&quot;, &quot;family practice&quot;, &quot;general practice&quot; or &quot;primary care&quot; is, in many countries, the first port-of-call for patients with non-emergency medical problems. Family physicians often provide services across a broad range of settings including office based practices, emergency department coverage, inpatient care, and nursing home care.

* &quot;Medical genetics&quot; is concerned with the diagnosis and management of hereditary disorders.
* &quot;Neurology&quot; is concerned with diseases of the nervous system. In the UK, neurology is a subspecialty of general medicine.
* &quot;Obstetrics and gynecology&quot; (often abbreviated as &quot;OB/GYN&quot; (American English) or &quot;Obs &amp; Gynae&quot; (British English)) are concerned respectively with childbirth and the female reproductive and associated organs. Reproductive medicine and fertility medicine are generally practiced by gynecological specialists.
* &quot;Pediatrics&quot; (AE) or &quot;paediatrics&quot; (BE) is devoted to the care of infants, children, and adolescents. Like internal medicine, there are many pediatric subspecialties for specific age ranges, organ systems, disease classes, and sites of care delivery.
* &quot;Pharmaceutical medicine&quot; is the medical scientific discipline concerned with the discovery, development, evaluation, registration, monitoring and medical aspects of marketing of medicines for the benefit of patients and public health.
* &quot;Physical medicine and rehabilitation&quot; (or &quot;physiatry&quot;) is concerned with functional improvement after injury, illness, or congenital disorders.
* &quot;Podiatric medicine&quot; is the study of, diagnosis, and medical and surgical treatment of disorders of the foot, ankle, lower limb, hip and lower back.
* &quot;Preventive medicine&quot; is the branch of medicine concerned with preventing disease.
** &quot;Community health&quot; or &quot;public health&quot; is an aspect of health services concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on population health analysis.
* &quot;Psychiatry&quot; is the branch of medicine concerned with the bio-psycho-social study of the etiology, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of cognitive, perceptual, emotional and behavioral disorders. Related fields include psychotherapy and clinical psychology.

===Interdisciplinary fields=== 
Some interdisciplinary sub-specialties of medicine include:
* &quot;Addiction medicine&quot; deals with the treatment of addiction.
* &quot;Aerospace medicine&quot; deals with medical problems related to flying and space travel.
* &quot;Biomedical Engineering&quot; is a field dealing with the application of engineering principles to medical practice.
* &quot;Clinical pharmacology&quot; is concerned with how systems of therapeutics interact with patients.
* &quot;Conservation medicine&quot; studies the relationship between human and non-human animal health, and environmental conditions. Also known as ecological medicine, environmental medicine, or medical geology.
* &quot;Disaster medicine&quot; deals with medical aspects of emergency preparedness, disaster mitigation and management.
* &quot;Diving medicine&quot; (or hyperbaric medicine) is the prevention and treatment of diving-related problems.
* &quot;Evolutionary medicine&quot; is a perspective on medicine derived through applying evolutionary theory.
* &quot;Forensic medicine&quot; deals with medical questions in legal context, such as determination of the time and cause of death, type of weapon used to inflict trauma, reconstruction of the facial features using remains of deceased (skull) thus aiding identification.
* &quot;Gender-based medicine&quot; studies the biological and physiological differences between the human sexes and how that affects differences in disease.
* &quot;Health informatics&quot; is a relatively recent field that deal with the application of computers and information technology to medicine.
* &quot;Hospice and Palliative Medicine&quot; is a relatively modern branch of clinical medicine that deals with pain and symptom relief and emotional support in patients with terminal illnesses including cancer and heart failure.
* &quot;Hospital medicine&quot; is the general medical care of hospitalized patients. Physicians whose primary professional focus is hospital medicine are called hospitalists in the United States and Canada. The term Most Responsible Physician (MRP) or attending physician is also used interchangeably to describe this role.
* &quot;Laser medicine&quot; involves the use of lasers in the diagnostics or treatment of various conditions.
* Many other health science fields, e.g. dietetics
* &quot;Medical ethics&quot; deals with ethical and moral principles that apply values and judgments to the practice of medicine.
* &quot;Medical humanities&quot; includes the humanities (literature, philosophy, ethics, history and religion), social science (anthropology, cultural studies, psychology, sociology), and the arts (literature, theater, film, and visual arts) and their application to medical education and practice.
* &quot;Nosokinetics&quot; is the science/subject of measuring and modelling the process of care in health and social care systems.
* &quot;Nosology&quot; is the classification of diseases for various purposes.
* &quot;Occupational medicine&quot; is the provision of health advice to organizations and individuals to ensure that the highest standards of health and safety at work can be achieved and maintained.
* &quot;Pain management&quot; (also called &quot;pain medicine&quot;, or &quot;algiatry&quot;) is the medical discipline concerned with the relief of pain.
* &quot;Pharmacogenomics&quot; is a form of &quot;individualized medicine&quot;.
* &quot;Podiatric medicine&quot; is the study of, diagnosis, and medical treatment of disorders of the foot, ankle, lower limb, hip and lower back.
* &quot;Sexual medicine&quot; is concerned with diagnosing, assessing and treating all disorders related to sexuality.
* &quot;Sports medicine&quot; deals with the treatment and prevention and rehabilitation of sports/exercise injuries such as muscle spasms, muscle tears, injuries to ligaments (ligament tears or ruptures) and their repair in athletes, amateur and professional.
* &quot;Therapeutics&quot; is the field, more commonly referenced in earlier periods of history, of the various remedies that can be used to treat disease and promote health.
* &quot;Travel medicine&quot; or &quot;emporiatrics&quot; deals with health problems of international travelers or travelers across highly different environments.
* &quot;Tropical medicine&quot; deals with the prevention and treatment of tropical diseases. It is studied separately in temperate climates where those diseases are quite unfamiliar to medical practitioners and their local clinical needs.
* &quot;Urgent care&quot; focuses on delivery of unscheduled, walk-in care outside of the hospital emergency department for injuries and illnesses that are not severe enough to require care in an emergency department. In some jurisdictions this function is combined with the emergency department.
* Veterinary medicine; veterinarians apply similar techniques as physicians to the care of non-human animals.
* &quot;Wilderness medicine&quot; entails the practice of medicine in the wild, where conventional medical facilities may not be available.

== Education and legal controls ==

Medical education and training varies around the world. It typically involves entry level education at a university medical school, followed by a period of supervised practice or internship, or residency. This can be followed by postgraduate vocational training. A variety of teaching methods have been employed in medical education, still itself a focus of active research. In Canada and the United States of America, a Doctor of Medicine degree, often abbreviated M.D., or a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree, often abbreviated as D.O. and unique to the United States, must be completed in and delivered from a recognized university.

Since knowledge, techniques, and medical technology continue to evolve at a rapid rate, many regulatory authorities require continuing medical education. Medical practitioners upgrade their knowledge in various ways, including medical journals, seminars, conferences, and online programs. A database of objectives covering medical knowledge, as suggested by national societies across the United States, can be searched at http://data.medobjectives.marian.edu/ .
In most countries, it is a legal requirement for a medical doctor to be licensed or registered. In general, this entails a medical degree from a university and accreditation by a medical board or an equivalent national organization, which may ask the applicant to pass exams. This restricts the considerable legal authority of the medical profession to physicians that are trained and qualified by national standards. It is also intended as an assurance to patients and as a safeguard against charlatans that practice inadequate medicine for personal gain. While the laws generally require medical doctors to be trained in &quot;evidence based&quot;, Western, or Hippocratic Medicine, they are not intended to discourage different paradigms of health.

In the European Union, the profession of doctor of medicine is regulated. A profession is said to be regulated when access and exercise is subject to the possession of a specific professional qualification. The regulated professions database contains a list of regulated professions for doctor of medicine in the EU member states, EEA countries and Switzerland. This list is covered by the Directive 2005/36/EC.

Doctors who are negligent or intentionally harmful in their care of patients can face charges of medical malpractice and be subject to civil, criminal, or professional sanctions.

== Medical ethics ==
Medical ethics is a system of moral principles that apply values and judgments to the practice of medicine. As a scholarly discipline, medical ethics encompasses its practical application in clinical settings as well as work on its history, philosophy, theology, and sociology. Six of the values that commonly apply to medical ethics discussions are:
* autonomy – the patient has the right to refuse or choose their treatment. (.)
* beneficence – a practitioner should act in the best interest of the patient. (.)
* justice – concerns the distribution of scarce health resources, and the decision of who gets what treatment (fairness and equality).
* non-maleficence – &quot;first, do no harm&quot; ().
* respect for persons – the patient (and the person treating the patient) have the right to be treated with dignity.
* truthfulness and honesty – the concept of informed consent has increased in importance since the historical events of the Doctors&#x27; Trial of the Nuremberg trials, Tuskegee syphilis experiment, and others.

Values such as these do not give answers as to how to handle a particular situation, but provide a useful framework for understanding conflicts. When moral values are in conflict, the result may be an ethical dilemma or crisis. Sometimes, no good solution to a dilemma in medical ethics exists, and occasionally, the values of the medical community (i.e., the hospital and its staff) conflict with the values of the individual patient, family, or larger non-medical community. Conflicts can also arise between health care providers, or among family members. For example, some argue that the principles of autonomy and beneficence clash when patients refuse blood transfusions, considering them life-saving; and truth-telling was not emphasized to a large extent before the HIV era.

== History ==


=== Ancient world ===
Prehistoric medicine incorporated plants (herbalism), animal parts, and minerals. In many cases these materials were used ritually as magical substances by priests, shamans, or medicine men. Well-known spiritual systems include animism (the notion of inanimate objects having spirits), spiritualism (an appeal to gods or communion with ancestor spirits); shamanism (the vesting of an individual with mystic powers); and divination (magically obtaining the truth). The field of medical anthropology examines the ways in which culture and society are organized around or impacted by issues of health, health care and related issues.

The earliest known medical texts in the world were found in the ancient Syrian city of Ebla and date back to 2500 BCE. Other early records on medicine have been discovered from ancient Egyptian medicine, Babylonian Medicine, Ayurvedic medicine (in the Indian subcontinent), classical Chinese medicine (Alternative medicine) predecessor to the modern traditional Chinese medicine), and ancient Greek medicine and Roman medicine.

In Egypt, Imhotep (3rd millennium BCE) is the first physician in history known by name. The oldest Egyptian medical text is the &quot;Kahun Gynaecological Papyrus&quot; from around 2000 BCE, which describes gynaecological diseases. The &quot;Edwin Smith Papyrus&quot; dating back to 1600 BCE is an early work on surgery, while the &quot;Ebers Papyrus&quot; dating back to 1500 BCE is akin to a textbook on medicine.

In China, archaeological evidence of medicine in Chinese dates back to the Bronze Age Shang dynasty, based on seeds for herbalism and tools presumed to have been used for surgery. The &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot;, the progenitor of Chinese medicine, is a medical text written beginning in the 2nd century BCE and compiled in the 3rd century.

In India, the surgeon Sushruta described numerous surgical operations, including the earliest forms of plastic surgery.Earliest records of dedicated hospitals come from Mihintale in Sri Lanka where evidence of dedicated medicinal treatment facilities for patients are found.

In Greece, the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates, the &quot;father of modern medicine&quot;, laid the foundation for a rational approach to medicine. Hippocrates introduced the Hippocratic Oath for physicians, which is still relevant and in use today, and was the first to categorize illnesses as acute, chronic, endemic and epidemic, and use terms such as, &quot;exacerbation, relapse, resolution, crisis, paroxysm, peak, and convalescence&quot;. The Greek physician Galen was also one of the greatest surgeons of the ancient world and performed many audacious operations, including brain and eye surgeries. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the onset of the Early Middle Ages, the Greek tradition of medicine went into decline in Western Europe, although it continued uninterrupted in the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire.

Most of our knowledge of ancient Hebrew medicine during the 1st millennium BC comes from the Torah, i.e. the Five Books of Moses, which contain various health related laws and rituals. The Hebrew contribution to the development of modern medicine started in the Byzantine Era, with the physician Asaph the Jew.

=== Middle Ages ===
The concept of hospital as institution to offer medical care and possibility of a cure for the patients due to the ideals of Christian charity, rather than just merely a place to die, appeared in the Byzantine Empire.

Although the concept of uroscopy was known to Galen, he did not see the importance of using it to localize the disease. It was under the Byzantines with physicians such of Theophilus Protospatharius that they realized the potential in uroscopy to determine disease in a time when no microscope or stethoscope existed. That practice eventually spread to the rest of Europe.

After 750 CE, the Muslim world had the works of Hippocrates, Galen and Sushruta translated into Arabic, and Islamic physicians engaged in some significant medical research. Notable Islamic medical pioneers include the Persian polymath, Avicenna, who, along with Imhotep and Hippocrates, has also been called the &quot;father of medicine&quot;. He wrote &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot; which became a standard medical text at many medieval European universities, considered one of the most famous books in the history of medicine. Others include Abulcasis, Avenzoar, Ibn al-Nafis, and Averroes. Persian physician Rhazes was one of the first to question the Greek theory of humorism, which nevertheless remained influential in both medieval Western and medieval Islamic medicine. Some volumes of Rhazes&#x27;s work &quot;Al-Mansuri&quot;, namely &quot;On Surgery&quot; and &quot;A General Book on Therapy&quot;, became part of the medical curriculum in European universities. Additionally, he has been described as a doctor&#x27;s doctor, the father of pediatrics, and a pioneer of ophthalmology. For example, he was the first to recognize the reaction of the eye&#x27;s pupil to light. The Persian Bimaristan hospitals were an early example of public hospitals.

In Europe, Charlemagne decreed that a hospital should be attached to each cathedral and monastery and the historian Geoffrey Blainey likened the activities of the Catholic Church in health care during the Middle Ages to an early version of a welfare state: &quot;It conducted hospitals for the old and orphanages for the young; hospices for the sick of all ages; places for the lepers; and hostels or inns where pilgrims could buy a cheap bed and meal&quot;. It supplied food to the population during famine and distributed food to the poor. This welfare system the church funded through collecting taxes on a large scale and possessing large farmlands and estates. The Benedictine order was noted for setting up hospitals and infirmaries in their monasteries, growing medical herbs and becoming the chief medical care givers of their districts, as at the great Abbey of Cluny. The Church also established a network of cathedral schools and universities where medicine was studied. The Schola Medica Salernitana in Salerno, looking to the learning of Greek and Arab physicians, grew to be the finest medical school in medieval Europe.

However, the fourteenth and fifteenth century Black Death devastated both the Middle East and Europe, and it has even been argued that Western Europe was generally more effective in recovering from the pandemic than the Middle East. In the early modern period, important early figures in medicine and anatomy emerged in Europe, including Gabriele Falloppio and William Harvey.

The major shift in medical thinking was the gradual rejection, especially during the Black Death in the 14th and 15th centuries, of what may be called the &quot;traditional authority&quot; approach to science and medicine. This was the notion that because some prominent person in the past said something must be so, then that was the way it was, and anything one observed to the contrary was an anomaly (which was paralleled by a similar shift in European society in general – see Copernicus&#x27;s rejection of Ptolemy&#x27;s theories on astronomy). Physicians like Vesalius improved upon or disproved some of the theories from the past. The main tomes used both by medicine students and expert physicians were Materia Medica and Pharmacopoeia.

Andreas Vesalius was the author of &quot;De humani corporis fabrica&quot;, an important book on human anatomy. Bacteria and microorganisms were first observed with a microscope by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1676, initiating the scientific field microbiology. Independently from Ibn al-Nafis, Michael Servetus rediscovered the pulmonary circulation, but this discovery did not reach the public because it was written down for the first time in the &quot;Manuscript of Paris&quot; in 1546, and later published in the theological work for which he paid with his life in 1553. Later this was described by Renaldus Columbus and Andrea Cesalpino. Herman Boerhaave is sometimes referred to as a &quot;father of physiology&quot; due to his exemplary teaching in Leiden and textbook &#x27;Institutiones medicae&#x27; (1708). Pierre Fauchard has been called &quot;the father of modern dentistry&quot;.

=== Modern ===
Veterinary medicine was, for the first time, truly separated from human medicine in 1761, when the French veterinarian Claude Bourgelat founded the world&#x27;s first veterinary school in Lyon, France. Before this, medical doctors treated both humans and other animals.

Modern scientific biomedical research (where results are testable and reproducible) began to replace early Western traditions based on herbalism, the Greek &quot;four humours&quot; and other such pre-modern notions. The modern era really began with Edward Jenner&#x27;s discovery of the smallpox vaccine at the end of the 18th century (inspired by the method of variolation originated in ancient China), Robert Koch&#x27;s discoveries around 1880 of the transmission of disease by bacteria, and then the discovery of antibiotics around 1900.

The post-18th century modernity period brought more groundbreaking researchers from Europe. From Germany and Austria, doctors Rudolf Virchow, Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, Karl Landsteiner and Otto Loewi made notable contributions. In the United Kingdom, Alexander Fleming, Joseph Lister, Francis Crick and Florence Nightingale are considered important. Spanish doctor Santiago Ramón y Cajal is considered the father of modern neuroscience.

From New Zealand and Australia came Maurice Wilkins, Howard Florey, and Frank Macfarlane Burnet.

Others that did significant work include William Williams Keen, William Coley, James D. Watson (United States); Salvador Luria (Italy); Alexandre Yersin (Switzerland); Kitasato Shibasaburō (Japan); Jean-Martin Charcot, Claude Bernard, Paul Broca (France); Adolfo Lutz (Brazil); Nikolai Korotkov (Russia); Sir William Osler (Canada); and Harvey Cushing (United States).

As science and technology developed, medicine became more reliant upon medications. Throughout history and in Europe right until the late 18th century, not only plant products were used as medicine, but also animal (including human) body parts and fluids. Pharmacology developed in part from herbalism and some drugs are still derived from plants (atropine, ephedrine, warfarin, aspirin, digoxin, &quot;vinca&quot; alkaloids, taxol, hyoscine, etc.). Vaccines were discovered by Edward Jenner and Louis Pasteur.

The first antibiotic was arsphenamine (Salvarsan) discovered by Paul Ehrlich in 1908 after he observed that bacteria took up toxic dyes that human cells did not. The first major class of antibiotics was the sulfa drugs, derived by German chemists originally from azo dyes.
Pharmacology has become increasingly sophisticated; modern biotechnology allows drugs targeted towards specific physiological processes to be developed, sometimes designed for compatibility with the body to reduce side-effects. Genomics and knowledge of human genetics and human evolution is having increasingly significant influence on medicine, as the causative genes of most monogenic genetic disorders have now been identified, and the development of techniques in molecular biology, evolution, and genetics are influencing medical technology, practice and decision-making.

Evidence-based medicine is a contemporary movement to establish the most effective algorithms of practice (ways of doing things) through the use of systematic reviews and meta-analysis. The movement is facilitated by modern global information science, which allows as much of the available evidence as possible to be collected and analyzed according to standard protocols that are then disseminated to healthcare providers. The Cochrane Collaboration leads this movement. A 2001 review of 160 Cochrane systematic reviews revealed that, according to two readers, 21.3% of the reviews concluded insufficient evidence, 20% concluded evidence of no effect, and 22.5% concluded positive effect.

== Quality, efficiency, and access ==
Evidence-based medicine, prevention of medical error (and other &quot;iatrogenesis&quot;), and avoidance of unnecessary health care are a priority in modern medical systems. These topics generate significant political and public policy attention, particularly in the United States where healthcare is regarded as excessively costly but population health metrics lag similar nations.

Globally, many developing countries lack access to care and access to medicines. , most wealthy developed countries provide health care to all citizens, with a few exceptions such as the United States where lack of health insurance coverage may limit access.

<doc id="18959" wikidata="Q207164" url="?curid=18959" title="2001 Mars Odyssey">
<text>2001 Mars Odyssey is a robotic spacecraft orbiting the planet Mars. The project was developed by NASA, and contracted out to Lockheed Martin, with an expected cost for the entire mission of US$297 million. Its mission is to use spectrometers and a thermal imager to detect evidence of past or present water and ice, as well as study the planet&#x27;s geology and radiation environment. The data &quot;Odyssey&quot; obtains is intended to help answer the question of whether life once existed on Mars and create a risk-assessment of the radiation that future astronauts on Mars might experience. It also acts as a relay for communications between the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover, and previously the Mars Exploration Rovers and &quot;Phoenix&quot; lander, to Earth. The mission was named as a tribute to Arthur C. Clarke, evoking the name of his and Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1968 film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;.

&quot;Odyssey&quot; was launched April 7, 2001, on a Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and reached Mars orbit on October 24, 2001, at 02:30 UTC (October 23, 19:30 PDT, 22:30 EDT).

On May 28, 2002 (sol ), NASA reported that &quot;Odyssey&quot;″s GRS instrument had detected large amounts of hydrogen, a sign that there must be ice lying within a meter of the planet&#x27;s surface, and proceeded to map the distribution of water below the shallow surface. The orbiter also discovered vast deposits of bulk water ice near the surface of equatorial regions.

By December 15, 2010, it broke the record for longest serving spacecraft at Mars, with 3,340 days of operation. &quot;Odyssey&quot; has also served as the primary means of communications for NASA&#x27;s Mars surface explorers in the past decade, up to the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover. It currently holds the record for the longest-surviving continually active spacecraft in orbit around a planet other than Earth, ahead of the Pioneer Venus Orbiter (served 14 years) and the &quot;Mars Express&quot; (serving over 20 years), at . it is in a polar orbit around Mars with a semi-major axis of about 3,800 km or 2,400 miles. It is estimated to have enough propellant to function until the end of 2025.

== Naming ==
In August 2000, NASA solicited candidate names for the mission. Out of 200 names submitted, the committee chose Astrobiological Reconnaissance and Elemental Surveyor, abbreviated ARES (a tribute to Ares, the Greek god of war). Faced with criticism that this name was not very compelling, and too aggressive, the naming committee reconvened. The candidate name &quot;2001 Mars Odyssey&quot; had earlier been rejected because of copyright and trademark concerns. However, NASA e-mailed Arthur C. Clarke in Sri Lanka, who responded that he would be delighted to have the mission named after his books, and he had no objections. On September 20, NASA associate administrator Ed Weiler wrote to the associate administrator for public affairs recommending a name change from ARES to &quot;2001 Mars Odyssey&quot;. Peggy Wilhide then approved the name change.

== Mission objectives ==

* Mapping the levels of elements across the entire Martian surface 
* Determine how much hydrogen exists within the &quot;shallow subsurface&quot; 
* Develop a library of high-resolution images and spectroscopy for the mineral composition of the Martian surface 
* Provide information on the morphology of the Martian surface 
* Identify the &quot;radiation-induced risk to human explorers&quot; through a characterization of the &quot;near-space radiation environment&quot; on the Martian surface

== Scientific instruments ==

The three primary instruments &quot;Odyssey&quot; uses are the:

* Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS). It is an onboard camera that provides visible and infrared imaging to characterize how minerals are distributed on the surface of Mars.
* Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS), including the High Energy Neutron Detector (HEND), provided by Russia. GRS is a collaboration between University of Arizona&#x27;s Lunar and Planetary Lab., the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Russia&#x27;s Space Research Institute. It is a spectrometer focussed on the gamma-ray portion of the spectrum in order to search for various elements in the Martian atmosphere, including carbon, silicon, iron and magnesium.
* Mars Radiation Environment Experiment (MARIE). An &quot;energetic particle spectrometer&quot;, measuring the radiation levels around Mars.

== Mission ==

&quot;Mars Odyssey&quot; launched from Cape Canaveral on April 7, 2001, and arrived at Mars about 200 days later on October 24. Upon arrival, the spacecraft&#x27;s main engine fired in order to decelerate, which allowed it to be captured into orbit around Mars. &quot;Odyssey&quot; then spent about 76 days aerobraking, using aerodynamic drag from the upper reaches of the Martian atmosphere to gradually slow down and reduce and circularize its orbit. By planning to use the atmosphere of Mars to slow the spacecraft in its orbit rather than firing its engine or thrusters, &quot;Odyssey&quot; did not need an additional 200 kilograms (440 lb) of propellant on board. This reduction in spacecraft weight allowed the mission to be launched on a Delta II 7925 launch vehicle, rather than a larger, more expensive launcher.

Aerobraking ended in January 2002, and Odyssey began its science mapping mission on February 19, 2002. &quot;Odyssey&quot;″s original, nominal mission lasted until August 2004, but repeated mission extensions have kept the mission active.

The payload&#x27;s MARIE radiation experiment stopped taking measurements after a large solar event bombarded the &quot;Odyssey&quot; spacecraft on October 28, 2003. Engineers believe the most likely cause is that a computer chip was damaged by a solar particle smashing into the MARIE computer board.

About 85% of images and other data from NASA&#x27;s twin Mars Exploration Rovers, &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot;, have reached Earth via communications relay by &quot;Odyssey&quot;. The orbiter helped analyze potential landing sites for the rovers and performed the same task for NASA&#x27;s Phoenix mission, which landed on Mars in May 2008. &quot;Odyssey&quot; aided NASA&#x27;s &quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&quot;, which reached Mars in March 2006, by monitoring atmospheric conditions during months when the newly arrived orbiter used aerobraking to alter its orbit into the desired shape.

&quot;Odyssey&quot; is in a Sun-synchronous orbit, which provides consistent lighting for its photographs. On September 30, 2008 (sol ) the spacecraft altered its orbit to gain better sensitivity for its infrared mapping of Martian minerals. The new orbit eliminated the use of the gamma ray detector, due to the potential for overheating the instrument at the new orbit.

The orbiter&#x27;s orientation is controlled by a set of three reaction wheels and a spare. When one failed in June 2012, the fourth was spun up and successfully brought into service. Since July 2012, &quot;Odyssey&quot; has been back in full, nominal operation mode following three weeks of &#x27;safe&#x27; mode on remote maintenance.

&quot;Mars Odyssey&quot;″s THEMIS instrument was used to help select a landing site for the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL). Several days before MSL&#x27;s landing in August 2012, &quot;Odyssey&quot;″s orbit was altered to ensure that it would be able to capture signals from the rover during its first few minutes on the Martian surface. &quot;Odyssey&quot; also acted as a relay for UHF radio signals from the (MSL) rover &quot;Curiosity&quot;. Because &quot;Odyssey&quot; is in a Sun-synchronous orbit, it passes over &quot;Curiosity&quot;″s location twice per day, enabling regular contact with Earth.

On February 11, 2014, mission control accelerated &quot;Odyssey&quot;″s drift toward a morning-daylight orbit to &quot;enable observation of changing ground temperatures after sunrise and after sunset in thousands of places on Mars&quot;. The orbital change occurred gradually until November 2015. Those observations could yield insight about the composition of the ground and about temperature-driven processes, such as warm seasonal flows observed on some slopes, and geysers fed by spring thawing of carbon dioxide (CO2) ice near Mars&#x27; poles.

On October 19, 2014, NASA reported that the &quot;Mars Odyssey&quot; Orbiter, as well as the &quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&quot; and &quot;MAVEN&quot;, were healthy after the Comet Siding Spring flyby.

In 2010, a spokesman for NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory stated that &quot;Odyssey&quot; could continue operating until at least 2016. This estimate has since been extended to the end of 2025.

=== Major discoveries ===
By 2008, &quot;Mars Odyssey&quot; had mapped the basic distribution of water below the shallow surface. The ground truth for its measurements came on July 31, 2008, when NASA announced that the Phoenix lander confirmed the presence of water on Mars, as predicted in 2002 based on data from the &quot;Odyssey&quot; orbiter. The science team is trying to determine whether the water ice ever thaws enough to be available for microscopic life, and if carbon-containing chemicals and other raw materials for life are present.

The orbiter also discovered vast deposits of bulk water ice near the surface of equatorial regions. Evidence for equatorial hydration is both morphological and compositional and is seen at both the Medusae Fossae formation and the Tharsis Montes.
