<text>In mathematics, a Lie group (pronounced ) is a group that is also a differentiable manifold, such that group multiplication and taking inverses are both differentiable.

A manifold is a space that locally resembles Euclidean space, whereas groups define the abstract concept of a binary operation along with the additional properties it must have to be thought of as a &quot;transformation&quot; in the abstract sense, for instance multiplication and the taking of inverses (to allow division), or equivalently, the concept of addition and subtraction. Combining these two ideas, one obtains a continuous group where multiplying points and their inverses is continuous. If the multiplication and taking of inverses are smooth (differentiable) as well, one obtains a Lie group.

Lie groups provide a natural model for the concept of continuous symmetry, a celebrated example of which is the circle group. Rotating a circle is an example of a continuous symmetry. For any rotation of the circle, there exists the same symmetry, and concatenation of such rotations makes them into the circle group, an archetypal example of a Lie group. Lie groups are widely used in many parts of modern mathematics and physics.

Lie groups were first found by studying matrix subgroups formula_1 contained in formula_2 or , the groups of formula_3 invertible matrices over formula_4 or . These are now called the classical groups, as the concept has been extended far beyond these origins. Lie groups are named after Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie (1842–1899), who laid the foundations of the theory of continuous transformation groups. Lie&#x27;s original motivation for introducing Lie groups was to model the continuous symmetries of differential equations, in much the same way that finite groups are used in Galois theory to model the discrete symmetries of algebraic equations.

== History ==
Sophus Lie considered the winter of 1873–1874 as the birth date of his theory of continuous groups. Thomas Hawkins, however, suggests that it was &quot;Lie&#x27;s prodigious research activity during the four-year period from the fall of 1869 to the fall of 1873&quot; that led to the theory&#x27;s creation. Some of Lie&#x27;s early ideas were developed in close collaboration with Felix Klein. Lie met with Klein every day from October 1869 through 1872: in Berlin from the end of October 1869 to the end of February 1870, and in Paris, Göttingen and Erlangen in the subsequent two years. Lie stated that all of the principal results were obtained by 1884. But during the 1870s all his papers (except the very first note) were published in Norwegian journals, which impeded recognition of the work throughout the rest of Europe. In 1884 a young German mathematician, Friedrich Engel, came to work with Lie on a systematic treatise to expose his theory of continuous groups. From this effort resulted the three-volume &quot;Theorie der Transformationsgruppen&quot;, published in 1888, 1890, and 1893. The term &quot;groupes de Lie&quot; first appeared in French in 1893 in the thesis of Lie&#x27;s student Arthur Tresse.

Lie&#x27;s ideas did not stand in isolation from the rest of mathematics. In fact, his interest in the geometry of differential equations was first motivated by the work of Carl Gustav Jacobi, on the theory of partial differential equations of first order and on the equations of classical mechanics. Much of Jacobi&#x27;s work was published posthumously in the 1860s, generating enormous interest in France and Germany. Lie&#x27;s &quot;idée fixe&quot; was to develop a theory of symmetries of differential equations that would accomplish for them what Évariste Galois had done for algebraic equations: namely, to classify them in terms of group theory. Lie and other mathematicians showed that the most important equations for special functions and orthogonal polynomials tend to arise from group theoretical symmetries. In Lie&#x27;s early work, the idea was to construct a theory of &quot;continuous groups&quot;, to complement the theory of discrete groups that had developed in the theory of modular forms, in the hands of Felix Klein and Henri Poincaré. The initial application that Lie had in mind was to the theory of differential equations. On the model of Galois theory and polynomial equations, the driving conception was of a theory capable of unifying, by the study of symmetry, the whole area of ordinary differential equations. However, the hope that Lie theory would unify the entire field of ordinary differential equations was not fulfilled. Symmetry methods for ODEs continue to be studied, but do not dominate the subject. There is a differential Galois theory, but it was developed by others, such as Picard and Vessiot, and it provides a theory of quadratures, the indefinite integrals required to express solutions.

Additional impetus to consider continuous groups came from ideas of Bernhard Riemann, on the foundations of geometry, and their further development in the hands of Klein. Thus three major themes in 19th century mathematics were combined by Lie in creating his new theory:
* The idea of symmetry, as exemplified by Galois through the algebraic notion of a group;
* Geometric theory and the explicit solutions of differential equations of mechanics, worked out by Poisson and Jacobi;
* The new understanding of geometry that emerged in the works of Plücker, Möbius, Grassmann and others, and culminated in Riemann&#x27;s revolutionary vision of the subject.

Although today Sophus Lie is rightfully recognized as the creator of the theory of continuous groups, a major stride in the development of their structure theory, which was to have a profound influence on subsequent development of mathematics, was made by Wilhelm Killing, who in 1888 published the first paper in a series entitled &quot;Die Zusammensetzung der stetigen endlichen Transformationsgruppen&quot; (&quot;The composition of continuous finite transformation groups&quot;). The work of Killing, later refined and generalized by Élie Cartan, led to classification of semisimple Lie algebras, Cartan&#x27;s theory of symmetric spaces, and Hermann Weyl&#x27;s description of representations of compact and semisimple Lie groups using highest weights.

In 1900 David Hilbert challenged Lie theorists with his Fifth Problem presented at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris.

Weyl brought the early period of the development of the theory of Lie groups to fruition, for not only did he classify irreducible representations of semisimple Lie groups and connect the theory of groups with quantum mechanics, but he also put Lie&#x27;s theory itself on firmer footing by clearly enunciating the distinction between Lie&#x27;s &quot;infinitesimal groups&quot; (i.e., Lie algebras) and the Lie groups proper, and began investigations of topology of Lie groups. The theory of Lie groups was systematically reworked in modern mathematical language in a monograph by Claude Chevalley.
== Overview ==

Lie groups are smooth differentiable manifolds and as such can be studied using differential calculus, in contrast with the case of more general topological groups. One of the key ideas in the theory of Lie groups is to replace the &quot;global&quot; object, the group, with its &quot;local&quot; or linearized version, which Lie himself called its &quot;infinitesimal group&quot; and which has since become known as its Lie algebra.

Lie groups play an enormous role in modern geometry, on several different levels. Felix Klein argued in his Erlangen program that one can consider various &quot;geometries&quot; by specifying an appropriate transformation group that leaves certain geometric properties invariant. Thus Euclidean geometry corresponds to the choice of the group E(3) of distance-preserving transformations of the Euclidean space , conformal geometry corresponds to enlarging the group to the conformal group, whereas in projective geometry one is interested in the properties invariant under the projective group. This idea later led to the notion of a &quot;G&quot;-structure, where &quot;G&quot; is a Lie group of &quot;local&quot; symmetries of a manifold.

Lie groups (and their associated Lie algebras) play a major role in modern physics, with the Lie group typically playing the role of a symmetry of a physical system. Here, the representations of the Lie group (or of its Lie algebra) are especially important. Representation theory is used extensively in particle physics. Groups whose representations are of particular importance include the rotation group SO(3) (or its double cover SU(2)), the special unitary group SU(3) and the Poincaré group.

On a &quot;global&quot; level, whenever a Lie group acts on a geometric object, such as a Riemannian or a symplectic manifold, this action provides a measure of rigidity and yields a rich algebraic structure. The presence of continuous symmetries expressed via a Lie group action on a manifold places strong constraints on its geometry and facilitates analysis on the manifold. Linear actions of Lie groups are especially important, and are studied in representation theory.

In the 1940s–1950s, Ellis Kolchin, Armand Borel, and Claude Chevalley realised that many foundational results concerning Lie groups can be developed completely algebraically, giving rise to the theory of algebraic groups defined over an arbitrary field. This insight opened new possibilities in pure algebra, by providing a uniform construction for most finite simple groups, as well as in algebraic geometry. The theory of automorphic forms, an important branch of modern number theory, deals extensively with analogues of Lie groups over adele rings; &quot;p&quot;-adic Lie groups play an important role, via their connections with Galois representations in number theory.

== Definitions and examples ==
A real Lie group is a group that is also a finite-dimensional real smooth manifold, in which the group operations of multiplication and inversion are smooth maps. Smoothness of the group multiplication
: formula_5

means that &quot;μ&quot; is a smooth mapping of the product manifold into &quot;G&quot;. The two requirements can be combined to the single requirement that the mapping
: formula_6
be a smooth mapping of the product manifold into &quot;G&quot;.

=== First examples ===
* The 2×2 real invertible matrices form a group under multiplication, called general linear group of degree 2 and denoted by formula_7 or by : formula_8 This is a four-dimensional noncompact real Lie group; it is an open subset of . This group is disconnected; it has two connected components corresponding to the positive and negative values of the determinant.
* The rotation matrices form a subgroup of , denoted by . It is a Lie group in its own right: specifically, a one-dimensional compact connected Lie group which is diffeomorphic to the circle. Using the rotation angle formula_9 as a parameter, this group can be parametrized as follows: formula_10 Addition of the angles corresponds to multiplication of the elements of , and taking the opposite angle corresponds to inversion. Thus both multiplication and inversion are differentiable maps.
* The affine group of one dimension is a two-dimensional matrix Lie group, consisting of formula_11 real, upper-triangular matrices, with the first diagonal entry being positive and the second diagonal entry being 1. Thus, the group consists of matrices of the form formula_12

=== Non-example ===

We now present an example of a group with an uncountable number of elements that is not a Lie group under a certain topology. The group given by 
: formula_13
with formula_14 a &quot;fixed&quot; irrational number, is a subgroup of the torus formula_15 that is not a Lie group when given the subspace topology. If we take any small neighborhood formula_16 of a point formula_17 in , for example, the portion of formula_18 in formula_16 is disconnected. The group formula_18 winds repeatedly around the torus without ever reaching a previous point of the spiral and thus forms a dense subgroup of .

The group formula_18 can, however, be given a different topology, in which the distance between two points formula_22 is defined as the length of the shortest path &quot;in the group&quot; formula_18 joining formula_24 to . In this topology, formula_18 is identified homeomorphically with the real line by identifying each element with the number formula_26 in the definition of . With this topology, formula_18 is just the group of real numbers under addition and is therefore a Lie group.

The group formula_18 is an example of a &quot;Lie subgroup&quot; of a Lie group that is not closed. See the discussion below of Lie subgroups in the section on basic concepts.

=== Matrix Lie groups ===

Let formula_29 denote the group of formula_3 invertible matrices with entries in . Any closed subgroup of formula_29 is a Lie group; Lie groups of this sort are called matrix Lie groups. Since most of the interesting examples of Lie groups can be realized as matrix Lie groups, some textbooks restrict attention to this class, including those of Hall, Rossmann, and Stillwell. 
Restricting attention to matrix Lie groups simplifies the definition of the Lie algebra and the exponential map. The following are standard examples of matrix Lie groups.
* The special linear groups over formula_4 and , formula_33 and , consisting of formula_3 matrices with determinant one and entries in formula_4 or formula_36
* The unitary groups and special unitary groups, formula_37 and , consisting of formula_3 complex matrices satisfying formula_39 (and also formula_40 in the case of formula_41)
* The orthogonal groups and special orthogonal groups, formula_42 and , consisting of formula_3 real matrices satisfying formula_44 (and also formula_45 in the case of formula_46)
All of the preceding examples fall under the heading of the classical groups.

=== Related concepts ===
A complex Lie group is defined in the same way using complex manifolds rather than real ones (example: formula_47), and holomorphic maps. Similarly, using an alternate metric completion of , one can define a &quot;p&quot;-adic Lie group over the &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers, a topological group which is also an analytic &quot;p&quot;-adic manifold, such that the group operations are analytic. In particular, each point has a &quot;p&quot;-adic neighborhood.

Hilbert&#x27;s fifth problem asked whether replacing differentiable manifolds with topological or analytic ones can yield new examples. The answer to this question turned out to be negative: in 1952, Gleason, Montgomery and Zippin showed that if &quot;G&quot; is a topological manifold with continuous group operations, then there exists exactly one analytic structure on &quot;G&quot; which turns it into a Lie group (see also Hilbert–Smith conjecture). If the underlying manifold is allowed to be infinite-dimensional (for example, a Hilbert manifold), then one arrives at the notion of an infinite-dimensional Lie group. It is possible to define analogues of many Lie groups over finite fields, and these give most of the examples of finite simple groups.

The language of category theory provides a concise definition for Lie groups: a Lie group is a group object in the category of smooth manifolds. This is important, because it allows generalization of the notion of a Lie group to Lie supergroups. This categorical point of view leads also to a different generalization of Lie groups, namely Lie groupoids, which are groupoid objects in the category of smooth manifolds with a further requirement.

=== Topological definition ===
A Lie group can be defined as a (Hausdorff) topological group that, near the identity element, looks like a transformation group, with no reference to differentiable manifolds. First, we define an immersely linear Lie group to be a subgroup &quot;G&quot; of the general linear group formula_29 such that
# for some neighborhood &quot;V&quot; of the identity element &quot;e&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, the topology on &quot;V&quot; is the subspace topology of formula_29 and &quot;V&quot; is closed in .
# &quot;G&quot; has at most countably many connected components.
(For example, a closed subgroup of ; that is, a matrix Lie group satisfies the above conditions.)

Then a &quot;Lie group&quot; is defined as a topological group that (1) is locally isomorphic near the identities to an immersely linear Lie group and (2) has at most countably many connected components. Showing the topological definition is equivalent to the usual one is technical (and the beginning readers should skip the following) but is done roughly as follows:
# Given a Lie group &quot;G&quot; in the usual manifold sense, the Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence (or a version of Lie&#x27;s third theorem) constructs an immersed Lie subgroup formula_50 such that formula_51 share the same Lie algebra; thus, they are locally isomorphic. Hence, formula_1 satisfies the above topological definition.
# Conversely, let formula_1 be a topological group that is a Lie group in the above topological sense and choose an immersely linear Lie group formula_54 that is locally isomorphic to . Then, by a version of the closed subgroup theorem, formula_54 is a real-analytic manifold and then, through the local isomorphism, &quot;G&quot; acquires a structure of a manifold near the identity element. One then shows that the group law on &quot;G&quot; can be given by formal power series; so the group operations are real-analytic and formula_1 itself is a real-analytic manifold.

The topological definition implies the statement that if two Lie groups are isomorphic as topological groups, then they are isomorphic as Lie groups. In fact, it states the general principle that, to a large extent, &quot;the topology of a Lie group&quot; together with the group law determines the geometry of the group.

== More examples of Lie groups ==
Lie groups occur in abundance throughout mathematics and physics. Matrix groups or algebraic groups are (roughly) groups of matrices (for example, orthogonal and symplectic groups), and these give most of the more common examples of Lie groups.

=== Dimensions one and two ===
The only connected Lie groups with dimension one are the real line formula_4 (with the group operation being addition) and the circle group formula_58 of complex numbers with absolute value one (with the group operation being multiplication). The formula_58 group is often denoted as , the group of formula_60 unitary matrices.

In two dimensions, if we restrict attention to simply connected groups, then they are classified by their Lie algebras. There are (up to isomorphism) only two Lie algebras of dimension two. The associated simply connected Lie groups are formula_61 (with the group operation being vector addition) and the affine group in dimension one, described in the previous subsection under &quot;first examples&quot;.

=== Additional examples ===
* The group SU(2) is the group of formula_62 unitary matrices with determinant . Topologically, formula_63 is the -sphere ; as a group, it may be identified with the group of unit quaternions.
* The Heisenberg group is a connected nilpotent Lie group of dimension , playing a key role in quantum mechanics.
* The Lorentz group is a 6-dimensional Lie group of linear isometries of the Minkowski space.
* The Poincaré group is a 10-dimensional Lie group of affine isometries of the Minkowski space.
* The exceptional Lie groups of types G2, F4, E6, E7, E8 have dimensions 14, 52, 78, 133, and 248. Along with the A–B–C–D series of simple Lie groups, the exceptional groups complete the list of simple Lie groups. 
*The symplectic group formula_64 consists of all formula_65 matrices preserving a &quot;symplectic form&quot; on . It is a connected Lie group of dimension .

=== Constructions ===
There are several standard ways to form new Lie groups from old ones:
* The product of two Lie groups is a Lie group.
* Any topologically closed subgroup of a Lie group is a Lie group. This is known as the closed subgroup theorem or Cartan&#x27;s theorem.
* The quotient of a Lie group by a closed normal subgroup is a Lie group.
* The universal cover of a connected Lie group is a Lie group. For example, the group formula_4 is the universal cover of the circle group . In fact any covering of a differentiable manifold is also a differentiable manifold, but by specifying &quot;universal&quot; cover, one guarantees a group structure (compatible with its other structures).

=== Related notions ===
Some examples of groups that are &quot;not&quot; Lie groups (except in the trivial sense that any group having at most countably many elements can be viewed as a 0-dimensional Lie group, with the discrete topology), are:
* Infinite-dimensional groups, such as the additive group of an infinite-dimensional real vector space, or the space of smooth functions from a manifold formula_67 to a Lie group , . These are not Lie groups as they are not &quot;finite-dimensional&quot; manifolds.
* Some totally disconnected groups, such as the Galois group of an infinite extension of fields, or the additive group of the &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers. These are not Lie groups because their underlying spaces are not real manifolds. (Some of these groups are &quot;&quot;p&quot;-adic Lie groups&quot;.) In general, only topological groups having similar local properties to R&quot;n&quot; for some positive integer &quot;n&quot; can be Lie groups (of course they must also have a differentiable structure).

== Basic concepts ==

=== The Lie algebra associated with a Lie group ===

To every Lie group we can associate a Lie algebra whose underlying vector space is the tangent space of the Lie group at the identity element and which completely captures the local structure of the group. Informally we can think of elements of the Lie algebra as elements of the group that are &quot;infinitesimally close&quot; to the identity, and the Lie bracket of the Lie algebra is related to the commutator of two such infinitesimal elements. Before giving the abstract definition we give a few examples:
* The Lie algebra of the vector space R&quot;n&quot; is just R&quot;n&quot; with the Lie bracket given by     [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;] = 0. (In general the Lie bracket of a connected Lie group is always 0 if and only if the Lie group is abelian.)
* The Lie algebra of the general linear group GL(&quot;n&quot;, C) of invertible matrices is the vector space M(&quot;n&quot;, C) of square matrices with the Lie bracket given by     [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;] = &quot;AB&quot; − &quot;BA&quot;.
* If &quot;G&quot; is a closed subgroup of GL(&quot;n&quot;, C) then the Lie algebra of &quot;G&quot; can be thought of informally as the matrices &quot;m&quot; of M(&quot;n&quot;, C) such that 1 + ε&quot;m&quot; is in &quot;G&quot;, where ε is an infinitesimal positive number with ε2 = 0 (of course, no such real number ε exists). For example, the orthogonal group O(&quot;n&quot;, R) consists of matrices &quot;A&quot; with &quot;AA&quot;T = 1, so the Lie algebra consists of the matrices &quot;m&quot; with (1 + ε&quot;m&quot;)(1 + ε&quot;m&quot;)T = 1, which is equivalent to &quot;m&quot; + &quot;m&quot;T = 0 because ε2 = 0.
* The preceding description can be made more rigorous as follows. The Lie algebra of a closed subgroup &quot;G&quot; of GL(&quot;n&quot;, C), may be computed as
: formula_68 where exp(&quot;tX&quot;) is defined using the matrix exponential. It can then be shown that the Lie algebra of &quot;G&quot; is a real vector space that is closed under the bracket operation, .

The concrete definition given above for matrix groups is easy to work with, but has some minor problems: to use it we first need to represent a Lie group as a group of matrices, but not all Lie groups can be represented in this way, and it is not even obvious that the Lie algebra is independent of the representation we use. To get around these problems we give 
the general definition of the Lie algebra of a Lie group (in 4 steps):
# Vector fields on any smooth manifold &quot;M&quot; can be thought of as derivations &quot;X&quot; of the ring of smooth functions on the manifold, and therefore form a Lie algebra under the Lie bracket [&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;] = &quot;XY&quot; − &quot;YX&quot;, because the Lie bracket of any two derivations is a derivation.
# If &quot;G&quot; is any group acting smoothly on the manifold &quot;M&quot;, then it acts on the vector fields, and the vector space of vector fields fixed by the group is closed under the Lie bracket and therefore also forms a Lie algebra.
# We apply this construction to the case when the manifold &quot;M&quot; is the underlying space of a Lie group &quot;G&quot;, with &quot;G&quot; acting on &quot;G&quot; = &quot;M&quot; by left translations &quot;Lg&quot;(&quot;h&quot;) = &quot;gh&quot;. This shows that the space of left invariant vector fields (vector fields satisfying &quot;Lg&quot;*&quot;Xh&quot; = &quot;Xgh&quot; for every &quot;h&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, where &quot;Lg&quot;* denotes the differential of &quot;Lg&quot;) on a Lie group is a Lie algebra under the Lie bracket of vector fields.
# Any tangent vector at the identity of a Lie group can be extended to a left invariant vector field by left translating the tangent vector to other points of the manifold. Specifically, the left invariant extension of an element &quot;v&quot; of the tangent space at the identity is the vector field defined by &quot;v&quot;^&quot;g&quot; = &quot;Lg&quot;*&quot;v&quot;. This identifies the tangent space &quot;TeG&quot; at the identity with the space of left invariant vector fields, and therefore makes the tangent space at the identity into a Lie algebra, called the Lie algebra of &quot;G&quot;, usually denoted by a Fraktur formula_69 Thus the Lie bracket on formula_70 is given explicitly by [&quot;v&quot;, &quot;w&quot;] = [&quot;v&quot;^, &quot;w&quot;^]&quot;e&quot;.

This Lie algebra formula_70 is finite-dimensional and it has the same dimension as the manifold &quot;G&quot;. The Lie algebra of &quot;G&quot; determines &quot;G&quot; up to &quot;local isomorphism&quot;, where two Lie groups are called locally isomorphic if they look the same near the identity element.
Problems about Lie groups are often solved by first solving the corresponding problem for the Lie algebras, and the result for groups then usually follows easily. 
For example, simple Lie groups are usually classified by first classifying the corresponding Lie algebras.

We could also define a Lie algebra structure on &quot;Te&quot; using right invariant vector fields instead of left invariant vector fields. This leads to the same Lie algebra, because the inverse map on &quot;G&quot; can be used to identify left invariant vector fields with right invariant vector fields, and acts as −1 on the tangent space &quot;Te&quot;.

The Lie algebra structure on &quot;Te&quot; can also be described as follows:
the commutator operation
: (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) → &quot;xyx&quot;−1&quot;y&quot;−1
on &quot;G&quot; × &quot;G&quot; sends (&quot;e&quot;, &quot;e&quot;) to &quot;e&quot;, so its derivative yields a bilinear operation on &quot;TeG&quot;. This bilinear operation is actually the zero map, but the second derivative, under the proper identification of tangent spaces, yields an operation that satisfies the axioms of a Lie bracket, and it is equal to twice the one defined through left-invariant vector fields.

=== Homomorphisms and isomorphisms ===
If &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; are Lie groups, then a Lie group homomorphism &quot;f&quot; : &quot;G&quot; → &quot;H&quot; is a smooth group homomorphism. In the case of complex Lie groups, such a homomorphism is required to be a holomorphic map. However, these requirements are a bit stringent; every continuous homomorphism between real Lie groups turns out to be (real) analytic.

The composition of two Lie homomorphisms is again a homomorphism, and the class of all Lie groups, together with these morphisms, forms a category. Moreover, every Lie group homomorphism induces a homomorphism between the corresponding Lie algebras. Let formula_72 be a Lie group homomorphism and let formula_73 be its derivative at the identity. If we identify the Lie algebras of &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; with their tangent spaces at the identity elements, then formula_73 is a map between the corresponding Lie algebras:
: formula_75
which turns out to be a Lie algebra homomorphism (meaning that it is a linear map which preserves the Lie bracket). In the language of category theory, we then have a covariant functor from the category of Lie groups to the category of Lie algebras which sends a Lie group to its Lie algebra and a Lie group homomorphism to its derivative at the identity.

Two Lie groups are called &quot;isomorphic&quot; if there exists a bijective homomorphism between them whose inverse is also a Lie group homomorphism. Equivalently, it is a diffeomorphism which is also a group homomorphism. Observe that, by the above, a continuous homomorphism from a Lie group formula_1 to a Lie group formula_18 is an isomorphism of Lie groups if and only if it is bijective.

=== Lie group versus Lie algebra isomorphisms ===
Isomorphic Lie groups necessarily have isomorphic Lie algebras; it is then reasonable to ask how isomorphism classes of Lie groups relate to isomorphism classes of Lie algebras.

The first result in this direction is Lie&#x27;s third theorem, which states that every finite-dimensional, real Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of some (linear) Lie group. One way to prove Lie&#x27;s third theorem is to use Ado&#x27;s theorem, which says every finite-dimensional real Lie algebra is isomorphic to a matrix Lie algebra. Meanwhile, for every finite-dimensional matrix Lie algebra, there is a linear group (matrix Lie group) with this algebra as its Lie algebra.

On the other hand, Lie groups with isomorphic Lie algebras need not be isomorphic. Furthermore, this result remains true even if we assume the groups are connected. To put it differently, the &quot;global&quot; structure of a Lie group is not determined by its Lie algebra; for example, if &quot;Z&quot; is any discrete subgroup of the center of &quot;G&quot; then &quot;G&quot; and &quot;G&quot;/&quot;Z&quot; have the same Lie algebra (see the table of Lie groups for examples). An example of importance in physics are the groups SU(2) and SO(3). These two groups have isomorphic Lie algebras, but the groups themselves are not isomorphic, because SU(2) is simply connected but SO(3) is not.

On the other hand, if we require that the Lie group be simply connected, then the global structure is determined by its Lie algebra: two simply connected Lie groups with isomorphic Lie algebras are isomorphic. (See the next subsection for more information about simply connected Lie groups.) In light of Lie&#x27;s third theorem, we may therefore say that there is a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphism classes of finite-dimensional real Lie algebras and isomorphism classes of simply connected Lie groups.

=== Simply connected Lie groups ===

A Lie group formula_1 is said to be simply connected if every loop in formula_1 can be shrunk continuously to a point in . This notion is important because of the following result that has simple connectedness as a hypothesis:
: Theorem: Suppose formula_1 and formula_18 are Lie groups with Lie algebras formula_82 and formula_83 and that formula_84 is a Lie algebra homomorphism. If formula_1 is simply connected, then there is a unique Lie group homomorphism formula_86 such that , where formula_87 is the differential of formula_88 at the identity.
Lie&#x27;s third theorem says that every finite-dimensional real Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of a Lie group. It follows from Lie&#x27;s third theorem and the preceding result that every finite-dimensional real Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of a &quot;unique&quot; simply connected Lie group.

An example of a simply connected group is the special unitary group SU(2), which as a manifold is the 3-sphere. The rotation group SO(3), on the other hand, is not simply connected. (See &quot;Topology of SO(3)&quot;.) The failure of SO(3) to be simply connected is intimately connected to the distinction between integer spin and half-integer spin in quantum mechanics. Other examples of simply connected Lie groups include the special unitary group SU(n), the spin group (double cover of rotation group) Spin(&quot;n&quot;) for , and the compact symplectic group Sp(n).

Methods for determining whether a Lie group is simply connected or not are discussed in the article on fundamental groups of Lie groups.

=== Exponential map ===

The exponential map from the Lie algebra formula_89 of the general linear group formula_90 to formula_90 is defined by the matrix exponential, given by the usual power series:
: formula_92
for matrices . If formula_1 is a closed subgroup of , then the exponential map takes the Lie algebra of formula_1 into ; thus, we have an exponential map for all matrix groups. Every element of formula_1 that is sufficiently close to the identity is the exponential of a matrix in the Lie algebra.

The definition above is easy to use, but it is not defined for Lie groups that are not matrix groups, and it is not clear that the exponential map of a Lie group does not depend on its representation as a matrix group. We can solve both problems using a more abstract definition of the exponential map that works for all Lie groups, as follows.

For each vector formula_67 in the Lie algebra formula_70 of formula_1 (i.e., the tangent space to formula_1 at the identity), one proves that there is a unique one-parameter subgroup formula_100 such that . Saying that formula_101 is a one-parameter subgroup means simply that formula_101 is a smooth map into formula_1 and that 
: formula_104
for all formula_105 and . The operation on the right hand side is the group multiplication in . The formal similarity of this formula with the one valid for the exponential function justifies the definition
: formula_106

This is called the exponential map, and it maps the Lie algebra formula_70 into the Lie group . It provides a diffeomorphism between a neighborhood of 0 in formula_70 and a neighborhood of formula_109 in . This exponential map is a generalization of the exponential function for real numbers (because formula_4 is the Lie algebra of the Lie group of positive real numbers with multiplication), for complex numbers (because formula_36 is the Lie algebra of the Lie group of non-zero complex numbers with multiplication) and for matrices (because formula_112 with the regular commutator is the Lie algebra of the Lie group formula_113 of all invertible matrices).

Because the exponential map is surjective on some neighbourhood formula_114 of , it is common to call elements of the Lie algebra infinitesimal generators of the group . The subgroup of formula_1 generated by formula_114 is the identity component of .

The exponential map and the Lie algebra determine the &quot;local group structure&quot; of every connected Lie group, because of the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula: there exists a neighborhood formula_16 of the zero element of , such that for formula_118 we have
: formula_119
where the omitted terms are known and involve Lie brackets of four or more elements. In case formula_67 and formula_121 commute, this formula reduces to the familiar exponential law .

The exponential map relates Lie group homomorphisms. That is, if formula_72 is a Lie group homomorphism and formula_123 the induced map on the corresponding Lie algebras, then for all formula_124 we have
: formula_125
In other words, the following diagram commutes,
(In short, exp is a natural transformation from the functor Lie to the identity functor on the category of Lie groups.)

The exponential map from the Lie algebra to the Lie group is not always onto, even if the group is connected (though it does map onto the Lie group for connected groups that are either compact or nilpotent). For example, the exponential map of is not surjective. Also, the exponential map is neither surjective nor injective for infinite-dimensional (see below) Lie groups modelled on &quot;C&quot;∞ Fréchet space, even from arbitrary small neighborhood of 0 to corresponding neighborhood of 1.

=== Lie subgroup ===
A Lie subgroup formula_18 of a Lie group formula_1 is a Lie group that is a subset of formula_1 and such that the inclusion map from formula_18 to formula_1 is an injective immersion and group homomorphism. According to Cartan&#x27;s theorem, a closed subgroup of formula_1 admits a unique smooth structure which makes it an embedded Lie subgroup of formula_1—i.e. a Lie subgroup such that the inclusion map is a smooth embedding.

Examples of non-closed subgroups are plentiful; for example take formula_1 to be a torus of dimension 2 or greater, and let formula_18 be a one-parameter subgroup of &quot;irrational slope&quot;, i.e. one that winds around in &quot;G&quot;. Then there is a Lie group homomorphism formula_135 with . The closure of formula_18 will be a sub-torus in .

The exponential map gives a one-to-one correspondence between the connected Lie subgroups of a connected Lie group formula_1 and the subalgebras of the Lie algebra of . Typically, the subgroup corresponding to a subalgebra is not a closed subgroup. There is no criterion solely based on the structure of formula_1 which determines which subalgebras correspond to closed subgroups.

== Representations ==
One important aspect of the study of Lie groups is their representations, that is, the way they can act (linearly) on vector spaces. In physics, Lie groups often encode the symmetries of a physical system. The way one makes use of this symmetry to help analyze the system is often through representation theory. Consider, for example, the time-independent Schrödinger equation in quantum mechanics, . Assume the system in question has the rotation group SO(3) as a symmetry, meaning that the Hamiltonian operator formula_139 commutes with the action of SO(3) on the wave function . (One important example of such a system is the hydrogen atom, which has a spherically symmetric potential.) This assumption does not necessarily mean that the solutions formula_140 are rotationally invariant functions. Rather, it means that the &quot;space&quot; of solutions to formula_141 is invariant under rotations (for each fixed value of formula_142). This space, therefore, constitutes a representation of SO(3). These representations have been classified and the classification leads to a substantial simplification of the problem, essentially converting a three-dimensional partial differential equation to a one-dimensional ordinary differential equation.

The case of a connected compact Lie group &quot;K&quot; (including the just-mentioned case of SO(3)) is particularly tractable. In that case, every finite-dimensional representation of &quot;K&quot; decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations. The irreducible representations, in turn, were classified by Hermann Weyl. The classification is in terms of the &quot;highest weight&quot; of the representation. The classification is closely related to the classification of representations of a semisimple Lie algebra.

One can also study (in general infinite-dimensional) unitary representations of an arbitrary Lie group (not necessarily compact). For example, it is possible to give a relatively simple explicit description of the representations of the group SL(2, R) and the representations of the Poincaré group.

== Classification ==
Lie groups may be thought of as smoothly varying families of symmetries. Examples of symmetries include rotation about an axis. What must be understood is the nature of &#x27;small&#x27; transformations, for example, rotations through tiny angles, that link nearby transformations. The mathematical object capturing this structure is called a Lie algebra (Lie himself called them &quot;infinitesimal groups&quot;). It can be defined because Lie groups are smooth manifolds, so have tangent spaces at each point.

The Lie algebra of any compact Lie group (very roughly: one for which the symmetries form a bounded set) can be decomposed as a direct sum of an abelian Lie algebra and some number of simple ones. The structure of an abelian Lie algebra is mathematically uninteresting (since the Lie bracket is identically zero); the interest is in the simple summands. Hence the question arises: what are the simple Lie algebras of compact groups? It turns out that they mostly fall into four infinite families, the &quot;classical Lie algebras&quot; A&quot;n&quot;, B&quot;n&quot;, C&quot;n&quot; and D&quot;n&quot;, which have simple descriptions in terms of symmetries of Euclidean space. But there are also just five &quot;exceptional Lie algebras&quot; that do not fall into any of these families. E8 is the largest of these.

Lie groups are classified according to their algebraic properties (simple, semisimple, solvable, nilpotent, abelian), their connectedness (connected or simply connected) and their compactness.

A first key result is the Levi decomposition, which says that every simply connected Lie group is the semidirect product of a solvable normal subgroup and a semisimple subgroup. 
* Connected compact Lie groups are all known: they are finite central quotients of a product of copies of the circle group &quot;S&quot;1 and simple compact Lie groups (which correspond to connected Dynkin diagrams).
* Any simply connected solvable Lie group is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of the group of invertible upper triangular matrices of some rank, and any finite-dimensional irreducible representation of such a group is 1-dimensional. Solvable groups are too messy to classify except in a few small dimensions.
* Any simply connected nilpotent Lie group is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of the group of invertible upper triangular matrices with 1s on the diagonal of some rank, and any finite-dimensional irreducible representation of such a group is 1-dimensional. Like solvable groups, nilpotent groups are too messy to classify except in a few small dimensions.
* Simple Lie groups are sometimes defined to be those that are simple as abstract groups, and sometimes defined to be connected Lie groups with a simple Lie algebra. For example, SL(2, R) is simple according to the second definition but not according to the first. They have all been classified (for either definition).
* Semisimple Lie groups are Lie groups whose Lie algebra is a product of simple Lie algebras. They are central extensions of products of simple Lie groups.

The identity component of any Lie group is an open normal subgroup, and the quotient group is a discrete group. The universal cover of any connected Lie group is a simply connected Lie group, and conversely any connected Lie group is a quotient of a simply connected Lie group by a discrete normal subgroup of the center. Any Lie group &quot;G&quot; can be decomposed into discrete, simple, and abelian groups in a canonical way as follows. Write 
: &quot;G&quot;con for the connected component of the identity
: &quot;G&quot;sol for the largest connected normal solvable subgroup
: &quot;G&quot;nil for the largest connected normal nilpotent subgroup
so that we have a sequence of normal subgroups
Then
: &quot;G&quot;/&quot;G&quot;con is discrete
: &quot;G&quot;con/&quot;G&quot;sol is a central extension of a product of simple connected Lie groups.
: &quot;G&quot;sol/&quot;G&quot;nil is abelian. A connected abelian Lie group is isomorphic to a product of copies of R and the circle group &quot;S&quot;1.
: &quot;G&quot;nil/1 is nilpotent, and therefore its ascending central series has all quotients abelian.

This can be used to reduce some problems about Lie groups (such as finding their unitary representations) to the same problems for connected simple groups and nilpotent and solvable subgroups of smaller dimension.
* The diffeomorphism group of a Lie group acts transitively on the Lie group
* Every Lie group is parallelizable, and hence an orientable manifold (there is a bundle isomorphism between its tangent bundle and the product of itself with the tangent space at the identity)

== Infinite-dimensional Lie groups ==
Lie groups are often defined to be finite-dimensional, but there are many groups that resemble Lie groups, except for being infinite-dimensional. The simplest way to define infinite-dimensional Lie groups is to model them locally on Banach spaces (as opposed to Euclidean space in the finite-dimensional case), and in this case much of the basic theory is similar to that of finite-dimensional Lie groups. However this is inadequate for many applications, because many natural examples of infinite-dimensional Lie groups are not Banach manifolds. Instead one needs to define Lie groups modeled on more general locally convex topological vector spaces. In this case the relation between the Lie algebra and the Lie group becomes rather subtle, and several results about finite-dimensional Lie groups no longer hold.

The literature is not entirely uniform in its terminology as to exactly which properties of infinite-dimensional groups qualify the group for the prefix &quot;Lie&quot; in &quot;Lie group&quot;. On the Lie algebra side of affairs, things are simpler since the qualifying criteria for the prefix &quot;Lie&quot; in &quot;Lie algebra&quot; are purely algebraic. For example, an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra may or may not have a corresponding Lie group. That is, there may be a group corresponding to the Lie algebra, but it might not be nice enough to be called a Lie group, or the connection between the group and the Lie algebra might not be nice enough (for example, failure of the exponential map to be onto a neighborhood of the identity). It is the &quot;nice enough&quot; that is not universally defined.

Some of the examples that have been studied include:
* The group of diffeomorphisms of a manifold. Quite a lot is known about the group of diffeomorphisms of the circle. Its Lie algebra is (more or less) the Witt algebra, whose central extension the Virasoro algebra (see Virasoro algebra from Witt algebra for a derivation of this fact) is the symmetry algebra of two-dimensional conformal field theory. Diffeomorphism groups of compact manifolds of larger dimension are regular Fréchet Lie groups; very little about their structure is known.
* The diffeomorphism group of spacetime sometimes appears in attempts to quantize gravity.
* The group of smooth maps from a manifold to a finite-dimensional Lie group is an example of a gauge group (with operation of pointwise multiplication), and is used in quantum field theory and Donaldson theory. If the manifold is a circle these are called loop groups, and have central extensions whose Lie algebras are (more or less) Kac–Moody algebras.
* There are infinite-dimensional analogues of general linear groups, orthogonal groups, and so on. One important aspect is that these may have &quot;simpler&quot; topological properties: see for example Kuiper&#x27;s theorem. In M-theory, for example, a 10-dimensional SU(&quot;N&quot;) gauge theory becomes an 11-dimensional theory when &quot;N&quot; becomes infinite.

<doc id="17946" wikidata="Q5492" url="?curid=17946" title="Lake Erie">
<text>Lake Erie ( ) is the fourth-largest lake by surface area of the five Great Lakes in North America and the eleventh-largest globally. It is the southernmost, shallowest, and smallest by volume of the Great Lakes and also has the shortest average water residence time. At its deepest point, Lake Erie is deep, making it the only Great Lake whose deepest point is above sea level.

Located on the International Boundary between Canada and the United States, Lake Erie&#x27;s northern shore is the Canadian province of Ontario, specifically the Ontario Peninsula, with the U.S. states of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York on its western, southern, and eastern shores. These jurisdictions divide the surface area of the lake with water boundaries. The largest city on the lake is Cleveland, anchoring the third largest U.S. metro area in the Great Lakes region, after Greater Chicago and Metro Detroit. Other major cities along the lake shore include Buffalo, New York; Erie, Pennsylvania; and Toledo, Ohio.

Situated below Lake Huron, Erie&#x27;s primary inlet is the Detroit River. The main natural outflow from the lake is via the Niagara River, which provides hydroelectric power to Canada and the U.S. as it spins huge turbines near Niagara Falls at Lewiston, New York, and Queenston, Ontario. Some outflow occurs via the Welland Canal, part of the Saint Lawrence Seaway, which diverts water for ship passages from Port Colborne, Ontario, on Lake Erie, to St. Catharines on Lake Ontario, an elevation difference of . Lake Erie&#x27;s environmental health has been an ongoing concern for decades, with issues such as overfishing, pollution, algae blooms, and eutrophication generating headlines.

==Geography==

===Geographic features===

Lake Erie (42.2° N, 81.2W) has a mean elevation of above sea level. It has a surface area of with a length of and breadth of at its widest points. It is the shallowest of the Great Lakes with an average depth of 10 fathoms 3 feet or and a maximum depth of Because Erie is the shallowest, it is also the warmest of the Great Lakes, and in 1999 this almost became a problem for two nuclear power plants which require cool lake water to keep their reactors cool. The warm summer of 1999 caused lake temperatures to come close to the limit necessary to keep the plants cool. Also because of its shallowness, it is the first to freeze in the winter. The shallowest section of Lake Erie is the western basin where depths average only ; as a result, &quot;the slightest breeze can kick up lively waves&quot;, also known as seiches. The &quot;waves build very quickly&quot;, according to other accounts. The region around the lake is known as the &quot;thunderstorm capital of Canada&quot; with &quot;breathtaking&quot; lightning displays. Sometimes fierce waves springing up unexpectedly have led to dramatic rescues; in one instance, a Cleveland resident trying to measure the dock near his house became trapped but was rescued by a fire department diver from Avon Lake, Ohio:

Lake Erie is primarily fed by the Detroit River (from Lake Huron and Lake St. Clair) and drains via the Niagara River and Niagara Falls into Lake Ontario. Navigation downstream is provided by the Welland Canal, part of the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Other major contributors to Lake Erie include Grand River, Huron River, Maumee River, Sandusky River, Cuyahoga River, and Buffalo River. The drainage basin covers .

Point Pelee National Park, the southernmost point of the Canadian mainland, is located on a peninsula extending into the lake. Lake Erie has 31 islands (13 in Canada, 18 in the U.S.), located generally in the western side of the lake. The largest of these is Pelee Island.
===Water levels===
Lake Erie has a lake retention time of 2.6 years, the shortest of all the Great Lakes. The lake&#x27;s surface area is . Lake Erie&#x27;s water level fluctuates with the seasons as in the other Great Lakes. Generally, the lowest levels are in January and February and the highest in June or July, although there have been exceptions. The average yearly level varies depending on long-term precipitation. Short-term level changes are often caused by seiches that are particularly high when southwesterly winds blow across the length of the lake during storms. These cause water to pile up at the eastern end of the lake. Storm-driven seiches can cause damage onshore. During one storm in November 2003, the water level at Buffalo rose by with waves of for a rise of . Meanwhile, at the western end of the lake, Toledo experienced a similar drop in water level.

* Historic High Water. In the summer of 1986, Lake Erie reached its highest level at above the datum. The high water records were set from April 1986 through January 1987. Levels ranged from above the datum.
* Historic Low Water. In the winter of 1934, Lake Erie reached its lowest level at below the datum. Monthly low water records were set from July 1934 through June 1935. During this twelve-month period water levels ranged from below the datum to even with the datum.

==Geology==
Lake Erie was carved out by glacier ice and went through many phases before its current form that is less than 4,000 years old, which is a short span in geological terms. Before this, the land on which the lake now sits went through several complex stages. A large lowland basin formed over two million years ago as a result of an eastern flowing river that existed well before the Pleistocene ice ages. This ancient drainage system was destroyed by the first major glacier in the area, while it deepened and enlarged the lowland areas, allowing water to settle and form a lake. The glaciers were able to carve away more land on the eastern side of the lowland because the bedrock is made of shale which is softer than the carbonate rocks of dolomite and limestone on the western side. Thus, the eastern and central basins of the modern lake are much deeper than the western basin, which averages only deep and is rich in nutrients and fish. Lake Erie is the shallowest of the Great Lakes because the ice was relatively thin and lacked erosion power when it reached that far south, according to one view.
As many as three glaciers advanced and retreated over the land, causing temporary lakes to form in the time periods in between each of them (see: Lake Whittlesey, Lake Maumee and Lake Arkona). Because each lake had a different volume of water, their shorelines rested at differing elevations. The last lake to form, Lake Warren, existed between about 13,000 and 12,000 years ago. It was deeper than the current Lake Erie, and its shoreline existed about inland from the modern one. Early Lake Erie went through many phases with its ancient sand dunes visible in the Oak Openings Region in Northwest Ohio. There, the sandy dry lake bed soil was not sufficient to support large trees with the exception of a few species of oaks, forming a rare oak savanna.

==History==

===Indigenous peoples===
At the time of European contact, there were several Indigenous peoples living around the shores of the eastern end of the lake. The Erie tribe (from whom the lake takes its name) lived along the southern edge, while the Neutrals (also known as Attawandaron) lived along the northern shore. The tribal name &quot;erie&quot; is a shortened form of the Iroquoian word , meaning &quot;long tail&quot;. The name may also come from the word &quot;eri&quot;, meaning &quot;cherry tree&quot;. Near Port Stanley, there is an Indigenous village dating from the 16th century known as the &quot;Southwold Earthworks&quot; where as many as 800 Neutral Indigenous peoples once lived; the archaeological remains include double earth walls winding around the grass-covered perimeter. Europeans named the tribe the &quot;Neutral Indians&quot; since these people refused to fight with other tribes.

Both the Erie and Neutrals were colonized and assimilated by their hostile eastern neighbors, the Iroquois Confederacy, between 1651 and 1657 during the Beaver Wars. For decades after those wars, the land around eastern Lake Erie was claimed and utilized by the Iroquois as a hunting ground. As the power of the Iroquois waned during the last quarter of the 17th century, several other, mainly Anishinaabe, displaced them from the territories they claimed on the north shore of the lake. There was a legend of an Indigenous woman named Huldah, who, despairing over her lost British lover, hurled herself from a high rock from Pelee Island.

===European exploration and settlement===

In 1669, Frenchman Louis Jolliet was the first documented European to sight Lake Erie, although there is speculation that Étienne Brûlé may have come across it in 1615. Lake Erie was the last of the Great Lakes to be explored by Europeans, since the Iroquois who occupied the Niagara River area were in conflict with the French, and they did not allow explorers or traders to pass through; explorers followed rivers out of Lake Ontario and portaged to Lake Huron. British authorities in Canada were nervous about possible expansion by American settlers across Lake Erie, so Colonel Thomas Talbot developed the Talbot Trail in 1809 as a way to stimulate settlement to the area; Talbot recruited settlers from Ireland and Scotland, and there are numerous places named after him in southern Ontario, such as Port Talbot, the Talbot River, and Talbotville.

During the War of 1812, Oliver Hazard Perry captured an entire British fleet in 1813 near Put-in-Bay, Ohio, despite having inferior numbers. American soldiers swept through the Ontario area around Port Rowan burning towns and villages. Generally, however, with the exceptions of the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812—which involved conflicts between the U.S. and the United Kingdom—relations between the U.S. and Canada have been remarkably friendly with an &quot;unfortified boundary&quot; and an agreement &quot;that has kept all fleets of war off the Great Lakes.&quot;

In 1837, rebellions broke about between Canadian settlers and the British Colonial government. These primarily concerned political reforms and land allocation issues. Some of the rebels stationed themselves in the U.S. and crossed the ice from Sandusky Bay to Pelee Island wearing &quot;tattered overcoats and worn-out boots&quot;, and carrying muskets, pitchforks, and swords, but the islanders had already fled. Later, there was a battle on the ice with the Royal 32nd Regiment, with the rebels being driven to retreat.
Settlers established commercial fisheries on the north coast of the lake around the 1850s. An important business was fishing. In the pre-Civil War years, railways sprouted everywhere, and around 1852 there were railways circling the lake. Maritime traffic picked up, although the lake was usually closed because of ice from December to early April, and ships had to wait for the ice to clear before proceeding. Since slavery had been abolished in Canada in 1833 but was still legal in southern U.S., a Lake Erie crossing was sometimes required for fugitive slaves seeking freedom:

Prior to modern radar and weather forecasting, merchant ships were often caught up in intense gales:

There were reports of disasters usually from sea captains passing information to reporters; in 1868, the captain of the &quot;Grace Whitney&quot; saw a sunken vessel with &quot;three men clinging to the masthead,&quot; but he could not help because of the gale and high seas.

A balloonist named John Steiner of Philadelphia made an ambitious trip across the lake in 1857. His voyage was described in &quot;The New York Times&quot;:

In 1885, lake winds were so strong that water levels dropped substantially, sometimes by as much as two feet, so that at ports such as Toledo, watercraft could not load coal or depart the port. During the history of the lake as a fishery, there has been marked battling by opposing interest groups:

Predictions of the lake being over-fished in 1895 were premature, since the fishery has survived commercial and sport fishing, pollution in the middle of the 20th century, invasive species and other ailments, but state and provincial governments, as well as national governments, have played a greater role as time went by. Business boomed; in 1901, the Carnegie Company proposed building a new harbor near Erie, Pennsylvania, in Elk Creek to accommodate shipments from its tube-plant site nearby. In 1913, a memorial to Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry was built on Put-in-Bay island featuring a Doric column.

Steamships have operated on Lake Erie since the early 1800s. Large, opulent cruise liners carried passengers between Detroit, Cleveland, Buffalo and other cities on the lake until the rise of the automobile in the 1950s drastically cut demand for their services. The Detroit and Cleveland Navigation company was one of the largest and most renowned of these companies.

During the Prohibition years from 1919 to 1933, a &quot;great deal of alcohol crossed Erie&quot; along with &quot;mobster corpses&quot; dumped into the Detroit River which sometimes washed up on the beaches of Pelee Island. Notable rum runners included Thomas Joseph McGinty and the Purple Gang. The Coast Guard attempted to interdict the Canadian liquor with its Rum Patrol, and a casino operated on Middle Island.

During the 20th century, commercial fishing was prevalent but so was the boom in manufacturing industry around the lake, and often rivers and streams were used as sewers to flush untreated sewage which ended up in the lake. Sometimes poorly constructed sanitary systems meant that when old pipes broke, raw sewage would spill directly into the Cuyahoga River and into the lake. A report in &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1969 described the lake as a &quot;gigantic cesspool&quot; since only three of 62 beaches were rated &quot;completely safe for swimming&quot;.

By 1975 the popular commercial fish blue pike had been declared extinct, although the declaration may have been premature. By the 1980s, there were about 130 fishing vessels with about 3,000 workers, but commercial fishing was declining rapidly, particularly from the American side.

===Great Lakes Compact===

In 2005, the Great Lakes states of Ohio, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Minnesota and the Canadian Provinces of Ontario and Quebec endorsed the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Sustainable Water Resources Compact. It was signed into law by President George W. Bush in September 2008. An international water-rights policy overseen by the Great Lakes Commission, the compact aims to prevent diversion of water from Great Lakes to distant states, as well as to set standards for use and conservation. It had support from both political parties, including United States Senator George Voinovich of Ohio and Governor Jennifer Granholm of Michigan, but is not popular in the southwestern states because of frequent drought conditions and water scarcity.

==Lake environment==

===Climate===

====Lake Erie in winter====
Like the other Great Lakes, Erie produces lake-effect snow when the first cold winds of winter pass over the warm waters. When the temperatures of the relatively warm surface water and the colder air separate to at least to apart, then &quot;lake-effect snow becomes possible:&quot;

Heavy lake-effect snowfalls can occur when cold air travels or longer over a large unfrozen lake. Lake-effect snow makes Buffalo and Erie the eleventh and thirteenth snowiest cities in the entire United States respectively, according to data collected from the National Climatic Data Center. Since winds blow primarily west to east along the main axis of the lake, lake-effect snowstorms are more pronounced on the eastern parts of the lake. Buffalo typically gets of snow each winter and sometimes of snow; the snowiest city is Syracuse, New York, which can receive heavy snowfall from both the lake effect process and large coastal cyclones. A storm around Christmas in 2001 pounded Buffalo with of snow.
The effects of the warmer lake water is reduced when the lake freezes over. In January 2011, for example, residents of Cleveland were glad when Lake Erie was &quot;90 percent frozen&quot; since it meant that the area had &quot;made it over the hump&quot; in terms of enduring repeated snowfalls which required much shoveling. Being the shallowest of the Great Lakes, it is the most likely to freeze and frequently does. In contrast, Lake Michigan has never completely frozen over since the warmer and deeper portion is in the south, although it came close to being totally frozen during three harsh winters over the past century. In past years, lake ice was so thick that it was possible to drive over it or go sailing on iceboats. Many lake residents take advantage of the ice and travel; some drive to Canada and back:

====Windy conditions====
Strong winds have caused lake currents to shift sediment on the bottom, leading to shifting sandbars that have been the cause of shipwrecks. But winds can have a peaceful purpose as well; there have been proposals to place electricity–producing wind turbines in windy and shallow points in the lake and along the coast. Steel Winds, a former steel mill site in Buffalo, has been developed as an urban wind farm housing 14 turbines capable of generating up to 35 megawatts of electricity. A plan by Samsung to build an offshore wind farm on the north shore of the lake, from Port Maitland to Nanticoke for a distance of , has been met with opposition from residents. Canadians near Leamington and Kingsville have organized protest groups to thwart attempts to bring wind turbines to the lake; reasons against the turbines include spoiling lake views. Plans to install turbines in Pigeon Bay, south of Leamington were met with opposition as well. The notion that bird and bat migration may be hurt by the wind turbines has been used to argue against the wind turbines as well.

====Microclimates====
The lake is responsible for microclimates that are important to agriculture. Along its north shore is one of the richest areas of Canada&#x27;s fruit and vegetable production; this southernmost tip, particularly in the area around Leamington, is known as Canada&#x27;s &quot;tomato capital&quot;. The area around Port Rowan has special trees that grow because of the &quot;tempering effect of the lake&quot;, and species include tulip trees, dogwood, sassafras, and sour gum. This area&#x27;s many greenhouses produce a &quot;variety of tropical plants rarely cultivated so far north&quot;, including some species of cacti, because of the lake&#x27;s tempering effect. Along the southeastern shore of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York is an important grape-growing region, as are the islands in the lake. Apple orchards are abundant in northeast Ohio to western New York.

====Long-term weather patterns====
According to one estimate, of water evaporate each year from the surface of the lake, which allows for rainfall and other precipitation in surrounding areas. Reports are conflicting about the overall effect of global warming on the Great Lakes region, including Lake Erie. One account suggests that climate change is causing greater evaporation of lake water, leading to warmer temperatures, as well as thinner or nonexistent ice in winter, which is fueling concerns that &quot;Erie appears to be shrinking&quot; and is the most likely candidate among the five Great Lakes to &quot;turn into a festering mud puddle.&quot; In 2010, the &quot;Windsor Star&quot; reported that the lake experienced record-breaking water temperatures, reaching in mid-August and compared the lake to a &quot;bath tub&quot;.

===Ecosystems===

Lake Erie has a complex ecosystem with many species in interaction. Human activity, such as pollution and maritime ship traffic, can affect this environment in numerous ways. The interactions between new species can sometimes have beneficial effects, as well as harmful effects. Some introductions have been seen as beneficial such as the introduction of Pacific salmon. Occasionally there have been mass die-offs of certain species of fish, sometimes for reasons unknown, such as many numbers of rainbow smelt in May 2010.

====Invasive species====
The lake has been plagued with a number of invasive species, including zebra and quagga mussels, the goby, and the grass carp. One estimate was that 180 invasive species are in the Great Lakes, some having traveled in ballast water in international ships. Zebra mussels and gobies have been credited with the increased population and size of smallmouth bass in Lake Erie. In 2008, concerns arose that the &quot;newest invader swarming in the Great Lakes&quot;, the bloody-red shrimp, might harm fish populations and promote algal blooms.

Environmentalists and biologists study lake conditions via installations such as the Franz Theodore Stone Laboratory on Gibraltar Island. The lab, which was established in 1895, is the oldest biological field station in the United States. Stone Laboratory was donated to the Ohio State University by Julius Stone in 1925 as part of the university&#x27;s Ohio Sea Grant College program. The Great Lakes Institute of the University of Windsor has experts who study issues such as lake sediment pollution and the flow of contaminants such as phosphorus.

Other invasive species in Lake Erie include spiny water fleas, fishhook water fleas, sea lamprey, and white perch. The invasive plant species in Lake Erie consist mainly of Eurasian milfoil, &quot;Trapa natans&quot; and purple loosestrife. The shore of the lake is also host to invasive species of the &quot;Phragmites&quot; reed genus.

====Eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms====
An ongoing concern is that nutrient overloading from fertilizers and human and animal waste, known as eutrophication, in which additional nitrogen and phosphorus enter the lake, will cause plant life to &quot;run wild and multiply like crazy&quot;. Since fewer wetlands remain to filter nutrients, and greater channelization of waterways, nutrients in water can cause algal blooms to sprout, with &quot;low-oxygen dead zones&quot; in a complex interaction of natural forces. As of the 2010s, much of the phosphorus in the lake comes from fertilizer applied to no-till soybean and corn fields, but washed into streams by heavy rains. The algal blooms result from growth of &quot;Microcystis&quot;, a toxic blue-green alga that the zebra mussels, which infest the lake, do not eat.

Periodically, a &quot;dead zone&quot;, or region of low oxygen, occurs in the lake, the location of which varies. Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have been studying the lake&#x27;s blue-green algal blooms and trying to find ways to predict when they are spreading or where they might make landfall; typically, the blooms arrive late each summer. This problem was extreme in the mid- and late 1960s, and the Lake Erie Wastewater Management Study conducted by the Buffalo District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determined that the eutrophication was caused by point sources such as industrial outfalls and municipal sanitary and storm sewer outfalls, as well as diffuse sources, such as overland runoff from farm and forest land. All of these sources contribute nutrients, primarily phosphorus, to the lake. Growth of organisms in the lake is then spiked to the point that oxygen levels are depleted. Recommendations were made for reducing point-source outflows, and reducing farm contributions of phosphorus by changing fertilizer usage, employing no-till farming, and other conservative practices. Many industrial and municipal sources have since been greatly reduced. The improved farming practices, which were voluntary, were followed for a while, resulting in remarkable recovery of the lake in the 1970s.

The conservation practices are not monitored and have not been kept up. One recent account suggests that the seasonal algal blooms in Lake Erie were possibly caused by runoff from cities, fertilizers, zebra mussels, and livestock near water. A second report focuses on the zebra mussels as being the cause of dead zones, since they filter so much sediment that this produces an overgrowth of algae. One report suggests the oxygen-poor zone began about 1993 in the lake&#x27;s central basin and becomes more pronounced during summer, but is somewhat of a mystery why this happens. Some scientists speculate that the dead zone is a naturally occurring phenomenon. Another report cites Ohio&#x27;s Maumee River as the main source of polluted runoff of phosphorus from industries, municipalities, tributaries and agriculture, and in 2008, satellite images showed the algal bloom heading toward Pelee Island. Two two-year, $2 million studies are trying to understand the &quot;growing zone&quot;, which was described as a 10-foot-thick layer of cold water at the bottom, in one area, which stretches across the lake&#x27;s center. It kills fish and microscopic creatures of the lake&#x27;s food chain and fouls the water, and may cause further problems in later years for sport and commercial fishing.

Algal blooms continued in early 2013, but new farming techniques, climate change, and even a change in Lake Erie&#x27;s ecosystem make phosphorus pollution more intractable. Blue-green algae (Cyanobacteria) bloom, were problematic in August 2019. According to a news report in August, &quot;scientists fully expect [it] to overwhelm much of western Lake Erie again this summer&quot;. By August 12, 2019, the bloom extended for roughly . A large bloom does not necessarily mean the cyanobacteria ... will produce toxins&quot;, said Michael McKay, executive director of the Great Lakes Institute for Environmental Research at the University of Windsor. &quot;Not enough is being done to stop fertilizer and phosphorus from getting into the lake and causing blooms,&quot; he added. Water testing was being conducted in August. The largest Lake Erie blooms to date occurred in 2015, exceeding the severity index at 10.5 and in 2011 at a 10, according to the NOAA. In early August, the 2019 bloom was expected to measure 7.5 on the severity index, but could range between 6 and 9. At that time, satellite images depicted a bloom stretching up to on Lake Erie, with the epicenter near Toledo, Ohio.

====Snakes====
The Lake Erie water snake, a subspecies of the northern water snake (&quot;Nerodia sipedon&quot;), lives in the vicinity of Ohio&#x27;s Put-in-Bay Harbor and had been placed on the threatened species list. By 2010, the water snake population was over 12,000 snakes. While they have a nonvenomous bite, they are a key predator in the lake&#x27;s aquatic ecosystem since they feed on mudpuppies, walleye, and smallmouth bass. The snake is helpful in keeping the population of goby fish in check. They mate from late May through early June and can be found in large mating balls with one female bunched within several males.

====Insects and birds====
In 1999, a local TV station&#x27;s Doppler weather radar detected millions of mayflies heading for Presque Isle in blue and green splotches on the radar in clouds measuring long. These insects were a sign of Lake Erie&#x27;s move back to health, since the mayflies require clean water to thrive. Biologist Masteller of Pennsylvania State University declared the insects to be a &quot;nice nuisance&quot; since they signified the lake&#x27;s return to health after 40 years of absence. Each is long; the three main species of mayflies are &quot;Ephemera simulans&quot;, &quot;Hexagenia rigida&quot;, and &quot;H. limbata&quot;. The insects mate over a 72-hour period from June through September; they fly in masses up to the shore, mate in the air, then females lay up to 8,000 eggs each over the water; the eggs sink back down and the cycle repeats. Sometimes, the clouds of mayflies have caused power outages and roads to become slippery with squashed insects. Zebra mussels filtering extra nutrients from the lake allows the mayfly larvae to thrive.

Incidents of birds dying from botulism have occurred, in 2000 and in 2002. Birds affected included grebes, common and red-breasted mergansers, loons, diving ducks, ring-billed gulls, and herring gulls. One account suggests that bird populations are in trouble, notably the wood warbler, which had population declines around 60% in 2008. Possible causes for declines in bird populations are farming practices, loss of habitats, soil depletion and erosion, and toxic chemicals. In 2006, concerns arose of possible avian influenza (bird flu) after two wild swans on the lake were found diseased, but they did not contain the H5N1 virus. Sightings of a magnificent frigatebird, a tropical bird with a 2 m wingspan, happened over the lake in 2008.

====Water quality issues and restoration====
Lake Erie infamously became very polluted in the 1960s and 1970s as a result of the quantity of heavy industry situated in cities on its shores, with reports of bacteria-laden beaches and fish contaminated by industrial waste. In the 1970s, patches of the lake were declared dead because of industrial waste and sewage from runoffs; as &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter Denny Lee wrote in 2004, &quot;The lake, after all, is where the Rust Belt meets the water.&quot;

Incidents occurred of the oily surfaces of tributary rivers emptying into Lake Erie catching fire: in 1969, Cleveland&#x27;s Cuyahoga River erupted in flames, chronicled in a &quot;Time&quot; magazine article which lamented a tendency to use rivers flowing through major cities as &quot;convenient, free sewers&quot;; the Detroit River caught fire on another occasion. The outlook was gloomy:

In December 1970, a federal grand jury investigation led by U.S. Attorney Robert Jones began, of water pollution allegedly being caused by about 12 companies in northeastern Ohio. It was the first grand jury investigation of water pollution in the area. The grand jury indicted four corporations for polluting Lake Erie and waterways in northeast Ohio. Facing fines were Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., Shell Oil Co., Uniroyal Chemical Division of Uniroyal Inc. and Olin Corp. United States Attorney General John N. Mitchell gave a press conference December 18, 1970, referencing new pollution control litigation, with particular reference to work with the Environmental Protection Agency, and announcing the filing of a lawsuit that morning against the Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation for discharging substantial quantities of cyanide into the Cuyahoga River near Cleveland. Jones filed the misdemeanor charges in district court, alleging violations of the 1899 Rivers and Harbors Act.

Cleveland&#x27;s director of public utilities Ben Stefanski pursued a massive effort to &quot;scrub the Cuyahoga&quot;; the effort cost $100 million in bonds, according to one estimate. New sewer lines were built. Clevelanders approved a bond issue by 2 to 1 to upgrade Cleveland&#x27;s sewage system. Federal officials acted as well: the United States Congress passed the Clean Water Act of 1972, and the United States and Canada established water pollution limits in an international water quality agreement. The Corps&#x27; LEWMS was also instituted at that time.

The clearing of the water column is partly the result of the introduction and rapid spread of zebra mussels from Europe, which had the effect of covering the lake bottom, with each creature filtering a liter of fresh water each day, helping to restore the lake to a cleaner state. The 1972 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement significantly reduced the dumping and runoff of phosphorus into the lake. The lake has since become clean enough to allow sunlight to infiltrate its water and produce algae and sea weed, but a dead zone persists. There have been instances of beach closings at Presque Isle because of unexplained E. Coli contaminations, possibly caused by sewer water overflows after heavy downpours.

Since the 1970s environmental regulation has led to a great increase in water quality and the return of economically important fish species such as walleye and other biological life. There was substantial evidence that the new controls had substantially reduced levels of DDT in the water by 1979. Cleanup efforts were described in 1979 as a notable environmental success story, suggesting that the cumulative effect of legislation, studies, and bans had reversed the effects of pollution:

Joint U.S.–Canadian agreements pushed 600 of 864 major industrial dischargers to meet requirements for keeping the water clean. One estimate was that $5 billion was spent to upgrade plants to treat sewage. The change toward cleaner water has been in a positive direction since the 1970s.

There was a tentative exploratory plan to capture CO2, compress it to a liquid form, and pump it a half-mile (800 m) beneath Lake Erie&#x27;s surface underneath the porous rock structure. According to chemical engineer Peter Douglas, there is sufficient storage space beneath Lake Erie to hold between 15 and 50 years of liquid emissions from the 4,000 megawatt Nanticoke coal plant. But there has been no substantial progress on this issue since 2007.

===Fishing===

====Species of fish====

Lake Erie is home to one of the world&#x27;s largest freshwater commercial fisheries. Lake Erie&#x27;s fish populations are the most abundant of the Great Lakes, partially because of the lake&#x27;s relatively mild temperatures and plentiful supply of plankton, which is the basic building block of the food chain. The lake&#x27;s fish population accounts for an estimated 50% of all fish inhabiting the Great Lakes. The lake contains steelhead, walleye (known in Canada as pickerel), largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, perch, lake trout, king salmon, whitefish, smelt, and many others. The lake consists of a long list of well established introduced species. Common non-indigenous fish species include the rainbow smelt, alewife, white perch and common carp. Non-native sport fish such as rainbow trout and brown trout are stocked specifically for anglers to catch. Attempts failed to stock coho salmon, and its numbers are dwindling. Commercial landings are dominated by yellow perch and walleye, with substantial quantities of rainbow smelt and white bass also taken. Anglers target walleye and yellow perch, with some effort directed at rainbow trout.

Up until the end of the 1950s, the most commonly caught commercial fish (more than 50% of the commercial catch) was a subspecies of the walleye known as the blue walleye (&quot;Sander vitreus glaucus&quot;) sometimes erroneously called &quot;blue pike&quot;. In the 1970s and 1980s, as pollution in the lake declined, counts of walleyes which were caught grew from 112,000 in 1975 to 4.1 million in 1985, with estimates of the numbers of walleyes in the lake at around 33 million in the basin, with many of or more. Not all walleyes thrived. The combination of overfishing and the eutrophication of the lake by pollution caused the population to collapse, and in the mid-1980s, the blue walleye was declared extinct. But the Lake Erie walleye was reportedly having record numbers, even in 1989, according to one report.

There have been concerns about rising levels of mercury in walleye fish; a study by the Canadian Ministry of the Environment noted an &quot;increasing concentration trend&quot; but that concentrations were within acceptable limits established by authorities in Pennsylvania. Because of the threat of PCBs, It was recommended, that persons eat no more than one walleye meal per month. Because of these and other concerns, in 1990, the National Wildlife Federation was on the verge of having a &quot;negative fish consumption &quot;advisory&quot;&quot; for walleye and smallmouth bass, which had been the main catch of an $800 million commercial fishing industry.

The longest fish in Lake Erie is reportedly the sturgeon which can grow to long and weight , but it is an endangered species and mostly lives on the bottom of the lake. In 2009, there was a confirmed instance of a sturgeon being caught, which was returned to the lake alive, and there are hopes that the population of sturgeons is resurging.

====Commercial fishing====

Estimates vary about the fishing market for the Great Lakes region. In 2007, one estimate of the total market for fishing in the Great Lakes, including commercial and recreational fishing, was $4 billion annually. Another estimate was more than $7 billion. But since high levels of pollution were discovered in the 1960s and 1970s, there has been continued debate over the desired intensity of commercial fishing. Commercial fishing in Lake Erie has been hurt by pollution as well as government regulations which limit the size of their catch; one report suggested that the numbers of fishing boats and employees had declined by two-thirds in recent decades. Another concern had been that pollution in the lake, as well as toxins found inside fish, were working against commercial fishing interests.

U.S. fishermen based along Lake Erie lost their livelihood over the past few decades and no longer catch fish such as whitefish for markets in New York. Pennsylvania had a special $3 stamp on fishing licenses to help &quot;compensate commercial fishermen for their losses&quot;, but this program ended after five years. One blamed the commercial fishing ban on a &quot;test of wills&quot; between commercial and recreational fishermen: &quot;One side needed large hauls. The other feared the lake was being emptied.&quot;
Commercial fishing is now predominantly based in Canadian communities, with a much smaller fishery—largely restricted to yellow perch—in Ohio. The Ontario fishery is one of the most intensively managed in the world. However, there are reports that some Canadian commercial fishermen are dissatisfied with fishing quotas and have sued the government about this matter, and there have been complaints that the legislative body writing the quotas is dominated by the U.S. and that sport fishing interests are favored at the expense of commercial fishing interests. Cuts of 30 to 45 percent for certain fish were made in 2007. The Lake Erie fishery was one of the first fisheries in the world managed on individual transferable quotas and features mandatory daily catch reporting and intensive auditing of the catch reporting system. Still, the commercial fishery is the target of critics who would like to see the lake managed for the exclusive benefit of sport fishing and the various industries serving the sport fishery. According to one report, the Canadian town of Port Dover is the home of the lake&#x27;s largest fishing fleet.

====Government regulations====
The lake can be thought of as a common asset with multiple purposes including being a fishery. There was direct competition between commercial fishermen and sport fishermen (including charter boats and sales of fishing licenses) throughout the lake&#x27;s history, with both sides seeking government assistance from either Washington or Ottawa, and trying to make their case to the public through newspaper reporting. But other groups have entered the political process as well, including environmentalists, lakefront property owners, industry owners and workers seeking cost-effective solutions for sewage, ferry boat operators, even corporations making electric-generating wind turbines.

Management of the fishery is by consensus of all management agencies with an interest in the resource and work under the mandate of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. The commission makes assessments using sophisticated mathematical modeling systems. The commission has been the focus of considerable recrimination, primarily from angler and charter fishing groups in the U.S. which have had a historical antipathy to commercial fishing interests. This conflict is complex, dating from the 1960s and earlier, with the result in the United States that, in 2011, commercial fishing was mostly eliminated from Great Lakes states. One report suggests that battling between diverse fishing interests began around Lake Michigan and evolved to cover the entire Great Lakes region. The analysis suggests that in the Lake Erie context, the competition between sport and commercial fishing involves universals and that these conflicts are cultural, not scientific, and therefore not resolvable by reference to ecological data.

====Sport fishing====
The lake supports a strong sport fishery. While commercial fishing declined, sport fishing has remained. The deep cool waters that spawn the best fishing is in the Canadian side of the lake. As a result, a fishing boat that crosses the international border triggers the security concerns of border crossings, and fishermen are advised to carry their passport. If their boat crosses the invisible border line in the lake, upon returning to the American shore, passengers need to report to a local border protection office.

In 2008, the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission tried stocking the lake with brown trout in an effort to build what&#x27;s called a &quot;put-grow-and-take&quot; fishery. There was a report that charter boat fishing increased substantially on the American side, from 46 to 638 charter boats in operation in Ohio alone, during a period from 1975 to 1985 as pollution levels declined and after populations of walleye increased substantially in the lake. In 1984, Ohio sold 27,000 nonresident fishing permits, and sport fishing was described as big business. In 1992, there were accounts of fishermen regularly catching walleye weighing up to . It is possible to fish off piers in winter for burbot; the burbot make a midwinter spawning run and is reportedly one of Erie&#x27;s glacial relics.

====Ice fishing====
In winter when the lake freezes, many fishermen go out on the ice, cut holes, and fish. It is even possible to build bonfires on the ice. But venturing on Lake Erie ice can be dangerous. In a 2009 incident, warming temperatures, winds of and currents pushing eastward dislodged a miles-wide ice floe which broke away from the shore, trapping more than 130 fishermen offshore; one man died while the rest were rescued by helicopters or boats.

===Agriculture===

The lake&#x27;s formerly more extensive lakebed creates a favorable environment for agriculture in the bordering areas of Ontario, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York. The Lake Erie sections of western New York have a suitable climate for growing grapes, and there are many vineyards and wineries in Chautauqua County and Erie County. The Canadian region of Lake Erie&#x27;s north shore is becoming a more prominent wine region as well; it has been dubbed the Lake Erie North Shore, or LENS region, and includes Pelee Island, and since it is farther north than comparable wine-growing areas in the world, the length of the days in the summer are longer. A longer growing season because of the lake-moderated temperatures make the risk of early frosts less likely.

The drainage basin has led to well fertilized soil. The north coast of Ohio is widely referred to as its nursery capital.

===Tourism===

====Diving for shipwrecks====
Lake Erie is a favorite for divers since there are many shipwrecks, perhaps 1,400 to 8,000 according to one estimate, of which about 270 are confirmed shipwreck locations. Research into shipwrecks has been organized by the Peachman Lake Erie Shipwreck Research Center, located on the grounds of the Great Lakes Historical Society. Most wrecks are undiscovered but believed to be well preserved and at most below the water surface. One report suggests there are more wrecks per square mile than any other freshwater location, including wrecks from Indigenous watercraft. There are efforts to identify shipwreck sites and survey the lake floor to map the location of underwater sites, possibly for further study or exploration. While the lake is relatively warmer than the other Great Lakes, there is a thermocline, meaning that as a diver descends, the water temperature drops about , requiring a wetsuit. One estimate is that Lake Erie has a quarter of all 8,000 estimated shipwrecks in the Great Lakes. They are preserved because the water is cold and salt-free. Divers have a policy of not removing or touching anything at the wreck. The cold conditions make diving difficult, requiring divers with skill and experience. One charter firm from western New York State takes about 1,500 divers to Lake Erie shipwrecks in a typical season from April through October.

In 1991, the 19th-century paddle steamer &quot;Atlantic&quot; was discovered. It had sunk in 1852 after a collision with the steamship &quot;Ogdensburg&quot;, west of Long Point, Ontario, and survivors from &quot;Atlantic&quot; were saved by the crew of &quot;Ogdensburg&quot;. One account suggests 130 people drowned while another suggests about 20 drowned. There was speculation that the sunken vessel had been a gambling ship, and therefore there might have been money aboard, but most historians were skeptical.

In 1998, the wreckage of &quot;Adventure&quot; became the first shipwreck registered as an &quot;underwater archaeological site&quot;; when it was discovered that &quot;Adventure&quot;″s propeller had been removed and given to a junkyard. The propeller was reclaimed days before being converted to scrap metal and brought back to the dive site. In 2003, divers discovered the steamer &quot;Canobie&quot; near Presque Isle, which had sunk in 1921. Other wrecks include the fish tub &quot;Neal H. Dow&quot; (1910), the &quot;steamer-cum-barge&quot; &quot;Elderado&quot; (1880), &quot;W. R. Hanna&quot;, &quot;Dundee&quot; which sank north of Cleveland in 1900, &quot;F. H. Prince&quot;, and &quot;The Craftsman&quot;. In 2007, the wreck of the steamship named after &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne was found near Vermilion, Ohio, in of water; the vessel sank in 1850 after its boilers exploded, and 38 people died. The wreck belongs to the state of Ohio, and salvaging it is illegal, but divers can visit. In addition, there are wrecks of smaller vessels, with occasional drownings of fishermen.

====Public parks====
There are numerous public parks around the lake. In western Pennsylvania, a wildlife reserve was established in 1991 in Springfield Township for hiking, fishing, cross-country skiing and walking along the beach. In Ontario, Long Point is a peninsula on the northwest shore near Port Rowan that extends into Lake Erie which is a stopover for birds migrating as well as turtles; Long Point Provincial Park is located there and has been designated as a UNESCO Biosphere reserve. In Ontario&#x27;s Sand Hill Park, east of Port Burwell, there is a high dune which people climb for picturesque views of the lake. In southern Michigan, Sterling State Park has campgrounds, for hiking, biking, fishing, boating, with a sand beach for sunbathing, swimming, and picnicking.

====Biking====
In 1997, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter Donna Marchetti took a bike tour around the Lake Erie perimeter, traveling per day and staying at bed and breakfasts. She biked through the cities of Cleveland, Erie, Windsor, Detroit and Toledo as well as resort towns, vineyards, and cornfields. The trip highlights were the &quot;small port towns and rural farmlands of southern Ontario&quot;. There are few bike repair shops in Ontario on the route.

====Islands====
Lake Erie islands tend to be in the westernmost part of the lake and have different characters. Some of them include:
*Kelleys Island has activities such as beach lounging, hiking, biking, and viewing the deep glacial grooves in the bedrock limestone.
*Pelee Island is reached by ferry from Leamington, Ontario, or by plane or ferry in Sandusky, Ohio, and is the largest of the Lake Erie islands. The island has a unique ecosystem with plants rarely found in Canada such as wild hyacinth, yellow horse gentian, and prickly pear cactus. There are two endangered snakes including the blue racer and the Lake Erie water snake. Songbirds migrate there in spring, and monarch butterflies stop over during the fall.
*South Bass Island has the island-village of Put-in-Bay, Ohio. It has been described as a party island with scenic rocky cliffs with a year-round population in the hundreds that grows during summer.

====Water sports====
Kayaking has become more popular along the lake, particularly in places such as Put-in-Bay, Ohio. There are extensive views with steep cliffs with exotic wildlife and extensive shoreline. Long-distance swimmers have swum across the lake to set records; for example, a 15-year-old amputee swam the stretch across the lake in 2001. In 2008, 14-year-old Jade Scognamillo swam from New York&#x27;s Sturgeon Point to Ontario&#x27;s Crystal Beach and completed the 11.9-mile (19.2-km) swim in five hours, 40 minutes and 35 seconds, and became the youngest swimmer to make the crossing. It is illegal for swimmers younger than 14 to attempt such a crossing. In Port Dover, Ontario, swimmers do high-dives at the annual &quot;Polar Bear Swim&quot; on the beach. Currents can pose a problem, and there have been occasional incidents of drownings. Since 2011, there have been 228 deaths.

====Lighthouses====
The lake is dotted by distinct lighthouses. A lighthouse off the coast of Cleveland, beset with cold lake winter spray, has an unusual artistic icy shape, although sometimes ice prevents the light from being seen by maritime vessels.

====Folklore====
There have been unconfirmed reports of persons spotting a creature akin to the Loch Ness Monster, beginning in the 19th century and sometimes called &quot;Bessie&quot; or &quot;South Bay Bessie&quot;. There were reports in 1990 of people seeing a &quot;large creature moving in the water about from their boat&quot; described as black in color, about long, with a snakelike head, and moving as fast as a boat. Five other people reported seeing something similar on three separate occasions, but there is no scientific evidence of such a creature. There is a &quot;Lake Erie Monster&quot; beer and a Cleveland Monsters hockey team.

There have been sporadic reports of people in Cleveland being able to see the Canadian shoreline as if it were immediately offshore, even though Canada is from Cleveland. It has been speculated that this is a weather-related phenomenon, working on similar principles as a mirage.

===Shipping traffic===
The lake has been a shipping lane for maritime vessels for centuries. Ships headed eastward can take the Welland Canal and a series of eight locks descending to Lake Ontario which takes about 12 hours. Thousands of ships make this journey each year. During the 19th century, ships could enter the Buffalo River and travel the Erie Canal eastward to Albany then south to New York City along the Hudson River. Generally there is heavy traffic on the lake except during the winter months from January through March when ice prevents vessels from traveling safely.

In 2007, there was a protest against Ontario&#x27;s energy policy which allows the shipping of coal in the lake; Greenpeace activists climbed a ladder on a freighter and &quot;locked themselves to the conveyor belt device that helps to unload the ship&#x27;s cargo&quot;; three activists were arrested and the ship was delayed for more than four hours, and anti-coal messages were painted on the ship.

===Ferryboats===
Ferryboats operate in numerous places: such as the passenger-only Jet Express Ferry from Sandusky and Port Clinton to Put-in-Bay and Kelly&#x27;s Island. The Miller Ferry from Catawba Island to Put-In-Bay and Middle Bass Island, the Kellys Island ferry from Marblehead to Kellys Island, and the Owen Sound Transportation Company from Leamington or Kingsville to Pelee Island and Sandusky.

However, plans to operate a ferryboat between the U.S. port of Erie and the Ontario port of Port Dover ran into a slew of political problems, including security restrictions on both sides as well as additional fees required to hire border inspectors. The project was abandoned.

The Great Lakes Circle Tour is a designated scenic road system connecting all of the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence River. Drivers can cross from the United States to the Canadian town of Fort Erie by going over the Peace Bridge.

===Border crossings===
Since the border between the two nations is largely unpatrolled, it is possible for people to cross undetected from one country to the other, in either direction, by boat. In 2010, Canadian police arrested persons crossing the border illegally from the United States to Canada, near the Ontario town of Amherstburg.

<doc id="17947" wikidata="Q1062" url="?curid=17947" title="Lake Ontario">
<text>Lake Ontario is one of the five Great Lakes of North America. It is bounded on the north, west, and southwest by the Canadian province of Ontario, and on the south and east by the U.S. state of New York. The Canada–United States border spans the centre of the lake.

The Canadian cities of Kingston, Mississauga, and Toronto are located on the lake&#x27;s northern shorelines, while the Canadian cities of Hamilton and St. Catharines and the American city of Rochester are located on the south shore. In the Huron language, the name means &quot;great lake&quot;. Its primary inlet is the Niagara River from Lake Erie. The last in the Great Lakes chain, Lake Ontario serves as the outlet to the Atlantic Ocean via the Saint Lawrence River, comprising the western end of the Saint Lawrence Seaway. The Long Sault control dam, primarily along with the Moses-Saunders Power Dam regulates the water level of the lake.

==Geography==

Lake Ontario is the easternmost of the Great Lakes and the smallest in surface area (), although it exceeds Lake Erie in volume (). It is the 13th largest lake in the world. When its islands are included, the lake&#x27;s shoreline is long. As the last lake in the Great Lakes&#x27; hydrologic chain, Lake Ontario has the lowest mean surface elevation of the lakes at above sea level; lower than its neighbor upstream. Its maximum length is , and its maximum width is . The lake&#x27;s average depth is 47 fathoms 1 foot (283 ft; 86 m), with a maximum depth of 133 fathoms 4 feet (802 ft; 244 m) in the Rochester Basin. The lake&#x27;s primary source is the Niagara River, draining Lake Erie, with the Saint Lawrence River serving as the outlet. The drainage basin covers 24,720 square miles (64,030 km2). As with all the Great Lakes, water levels change both within the year (owing to seasonal changes in water input) and among years (owing to longer-term trends in precipitation). These water level fluctuations are an integral part of lake ecology and produce and maintain extensive wetlands. The lake also has an important freshwater fishery, although it has been negatively affected by factors including overfishing, water pollution and invasive species.

Baymouth bars built by prevailing winds and currents have created a significant number of lagoons and sheltered harbors, mostly near (but not limited to) Prince Edward County, Ontario, and the easternmost shores. Perhaps the best-known example is Toronto Bay, chosen as the site of the Upper Canada capital for its strategic harbor. Other prominent examples include Hamilton Harbour, Irondequoit Bay, Presqu&#x27;ile Bay, and Sodus Bay. The bars themselves are the sites of long beaches, such as Sandbanks Provincial Park and Sandy Island Beach State Park. These sand bars are often associated with large wetlands, which support large numbers of plant and animal species, as well as providing important rest areas for migratory birds. Presqu&#x27;ile, on the north shore of Lake Ontario, is particularly significant in this regard. One unique feature of the lake is the Z-shaped Bay of Quinte which separates Prince Edward County from the Ontario mainland, save for a isthmus near Trenton; this feature also supports many wetlands and aquatic plants, as well as associated fisheries.

Major rivers draining into Lake Ontario include the Niagara River, Don River, Humber River, Rouge River, Trent River, Cataraqui River, Genesee River, Oswego River, Black River, Little Salmon River, and the Salmon River.

==Geology==
The lake basin was carved out of soft, weak Silurian-age rocks by the Wisconsin ice sheet during the last ice age. The action of the ice occurred along the pre-glacial Ontarian River valley which had approximately the same orientation as today&#x27;s basin. Material that was pushed southward by the ice sheet left landforms such as drumlins, kames, and moraines, both on the modern land surface and the lake bottom, reorganizing the region&#x27;s entire drainage system. As the ice sheet retreated toward the north, it still dammed the St. Lawrence Valley outlet, so the lake surface was at a higher level. This stage is known as Lake Iroquois. During that time the lake drained through present-day Syracuse, New York, into the Mohawk River, thence to the Hudson River and the Atlantic. The shoreline created during this stage can be easily recognized by the (now dry) beaches and wave-cut hills from the present shoreline.

When the ice finally receded from the St. Lawrence valley, the outlet was below sea level, and for a short time, the lake became a bay of the Atlantic Ocean, in association with the Champlain Sea. Gradually the land rebounded from the release of the weight of about of ice that had been stacked on it. It is still rebounding about per century in the St. Lawrence area. Since the ice receded from the area last, the most rapid rebound still occurs there. This means the lake bed is gradually tilting southward, inundating the south shore and turning river valleys into bays. Both north and south shores experience shoreline erosion, but the tilting amplifies this effect on the south shore, causing loss to property owners.
==Climate==

The lake has a natural seiche rhythm of eleven minutes. The seiche effect normally is only about but can be greatly amplified by earth movement, winds, and atmospheric pressure changes. Because of its great depth, the lake as a whole does not completely freeze in winter, but an ice sheet covering between 10% and 90% of the lake area typically develops, depending on the severity of the winter. Ice sheets typically form along the shoreline and in slack water bays, where the lake is not as deep. During the winters of 1877 and 1878, the ice sheet coverage was up to 95–100% of the lake. During the War of 1812, the ice cover was stable enough the American naval commander stationed at Sackets Harbor feared a British attack from Kingston, over the ice. The lake has completely frozen over on five recorded occasions: in 1830, 1874, 1893, 1912, and 1934.

When the cold winds of winter pass over the warmer water of the lake, they pick up moisture and drop it as lake-effect snow. Since the prevailing winter winds are from the northwest, the southern and southeastern shoreline of the lake is referred to as the snowbelt. In some winters, the area between Oswego and Pulaski may receive twenty or more feet (600 cm) of snowfall. Also impacted by lake-effect snow is the Tug Hill Plateau, an area of elevated land about east of Lake Ontario. The &quot;Hill&quot;, as it is often referred to, typically receives more snow than any other region in the eastern United States. As a result, Tug Hill is a popular location for winter enthusiasts, such as snow-mobilers and cross-country skiers. Lake-effect snow often extends inland as far as Syracuse, with that city often recording the most winter snowfall accumulation of any large city in the United States. Other cities in the world receive more snow annually, such as Quebec City, which averages , and Sapporo, Japan, which receives each year and is often regarded as the snowiest city in the world.

Foggy conditions (particularly in fall) can be created by thermal contrasts and can be an impediment for recreational boaters. Lake breezes in spring tend to slow fruit bloom until the frost danger is past, and in the autumn delay the onset of fall frost, particularly on the south shore. Cool onshore winds also slow the early bloom of plants and flowers until later in the spring season, protecting them from possible frost damage. Such microclimatic effects have enabled tender fruit production in a continental climate, with the southwest shore supporting a major fruit-growing area. Apples, cherries, pears, plums, and peaches are grown in many commercial orchards around Rochester. Between Stoney Creek and Niagara-on-the-Lake on the Niagara Peninsula is a major fruit-growing and wine-making area. The wine-growing region extends over the international border into Niagara and Orleans counties in New York. Apple varieties that tolerate a more extreme climate are grown on the lake&#x27;s north shore, around Cobourg.

==Ecology==

The Great Lakes watershed is a region of high biodiversity, and Lake Ontario is important for its diversity of birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians, and plants. Many of these special species are associated with shorelines, particularly sand dunes, lagoons, and wetlands. The importance of wetlands to the lake has been appreciated, and many of the larger wetlands have protected status. These wetlands are changing, partly because the natural water level fluctuations have been reduced. Many wetland plants are dependent upon low water levels to reproduce. When water levels are stabilized, the area and diversity of the marsh is reduced. This is particularly true of meadow marsh (also known as wet meadow wetlands); for example, in Eel Bay near Alexandria Bay, regulation of lake levels has resulted in large losses of wet meadow. Often this is accompanied by the invasion of cattails, which displace many of the native plant species and reduce plant diversity. Eutrophication may accelerate this process by providing nitrogen and phosphorus for the more rapid growth of competitively dominant plants. Similar effects are occurring on the north shore, in wetlands such as Presqu&#x27;ile, which have interdunal wetlands called pannes, with high plant diversity and many unusual plant species.

Most of the forests around the lake are deciduous forests dominated by trees including maple, oak, beech, ash and basswood. These are classified as part of the Mixedwood Plains Ecozone by Environment Canada, or as the Eastern Great Lakes and Hudson Lowlands by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or as the Great Lakes Ecoregion by The Nature Conservancy. Deforestation in the vicinity of the lake has had many negative impacts, including loss of forest birds, extinction of native salmon, and increased amounts of sediment flowing into the lake. In some areas, more than 90 percent of the forest cover has been removed and replaced by agriculture. Certain tree species, such as hemlock, have also been particularly depleted by past logging activity. Guidelines for restoration stress the importance of maintaining and restoring forest cover, particularly along streams and wetlands.

By the 1960s and 1970s, the increased pollution caused frequent algal blooms to occur in the summer. These blooms killed large numbers of fish, and left decomposing piles of filamentous algae and dead fish along the shores.

=== Water pollution ===
Lake Ontario is the most downstream lake of the Great Lakes, so the pollution from all the other lakes flows into it. Lake Ontario was ranked as the most environmentally stressed amongst the five Great Lakes in a 2015 ecological study. Some of the stresses on the lake include excess application of fertilizers in agriculture running into the lake, spillover from obsolete municipal sewage systems, toxic chemicals from industries along the rivers that drain into the lake, and metropolitan drainage from big cities like Toronto, Rochester, and Hamilton.

Randle Reef, the westernmost part of Lake Ontario, has been identified as one of the most contaminated areas on Lake Ontario alongside other areas of concern on Great Lakes. However, a $150-million cleanup project had begun in 2016 and is expected to be completed by 2025.

==Human history==
The name Ontario is derived from the Huron word &quot;Ontarí&#x27;io&quot;, which means &quot;great lake&quot;. In Colonial times, the lake was also called &quot;Cataraqui&quot;, a French spelling of the Mohawk &quot;Katarokwi&quot;. The lake was a border between the Huron people and the Iroquois Confederacy in the pre-Columbian era. In the 17th century, the Iroquois drove out the Huron from southern Ontario and settled the northern shores of Lake Ontario. When the Iroquois withdrew and the Anishnabeg / Ojibwa / Mississaugas moved in from the north to southern Ontario, they retained the Iroquois name. Artifacts believed to be of Norse origin have been found in the area of Sodus Bay, indicating the possibility of trading by the indigenous peoples with Norse explorers on the east coast of North America.

It is believed the first European to reach the lake was Étienne Brûlé in 1615. As was their practice, the French explorers introduced other names for the lake. In 1632 and 1656, the lake was referred to as Lac de St. Louis or Lake St. Louis by Samuel de Champlain and cartographer Nicolas Sanson respectively. In 1660, Jesuit historian Francis Creuxius coined the name &quot;Lacus Ontarius&quot;. In a map drawn in the &quot;Relation des Jésuites&quot; (1662–1663), the lake bears the legend &quot;Lac Ontario ou des Iroquois&quot; with the name &quot;Ondiara&quot; in smaller type. A French map produced in 1712 (currently in the Canadian Museum of History), created by military engineer Jean-Baptiste de Couagne, identified Lake Ontario as &quot;Lac Frontenac&quot; named after Louis de Buade, Comte de Frontenac et de Palluau. He was a French soldier, courtier, and Governor General of New France from 1672 to 1682 and from 1689 to his death in 1698.

In the 17th century, reports of an alleged creature named Gaasyendietha, similar to the so-called Loch Ness Monster, being sighted in the lake. The creature is described as large with a long neck, green in colour, and generally causes a break in the surface waves.

A series of trading posts were established by both the British and French, such as Fort Frontenac in 1673, Fort Oswego in 1722, and Fort Rouillé in 1750. As the easternmost and nearest lake to the Atlantic seaboard of Canada and the United States, population centres here are among the oldest in the Great Lakes basin, with Kingston, Ontario, formerly the capital of Canada, dating to the establishment of Fort Frontenac in 1673. 

After the French and Indian War, all forts around the lake were under British control. The United States took possession of the forts along the American side of the lake at the signing of the Jay Treaty in 1794. Permanent, non-military European settlement began during the American Revolution with the influx of Loyalist settlers. During the War of 1812, the Royal Navy and US Navy had fought in several engagements for control of Lake Ontario. The Great Lakes, including Lake Ontario, were largely demilitarized after the Rush–Bagot Treaty was ratified in 1818.

The lake became a hub of commercial activity following the War of 1812 with canal building on both sides of the border and heavy travel by lake steamers. Steamer activity peaked in the mid-19th century before competition from railway lines.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a type of scow known as a &quot;stone hooker&quot; was in operation on the northwest shore, particularly around Port Credit and Bronte. Stonehooking was the practice of raking flat fragments of Dundas shale from the shallow lake floor of the area for use in construction, particularly in the growing city of Toronto.

===Swims across the lake===

, nearly 50 people have successfully swum across the lake. The first person who accomplished the feat was a Canadian long distance swimmer Marilyn Bell, who did it in 1954 at age 16. Toronto&#x27;s Marilyn Bell Park is named in her honour. The park opened in 1984 and is east of the spot where Bell completed her swim. In 1974, Diana Nyad became the first person who swam across the lake against the current (from north to south). On August 28, 2007, 14-year-old Natalie Lambert from Kingston, Ontario, made the swim, leaving Sackets Harbor, New York, and reaching Kingston&#x27;s Confederation basin less than 24 hours after she entered the lake. On August 19, 2012, 14-year-old Annaleise Carr became the youngest person to swim across the lake. She completed the 32-mile (52-km) crossing from Niagara-on-the-Lake to Marilyn Bell Park in just under 27 hours.

==Settlements==
A large conurbation called the Golden Horseshoe occupies the lake&#x27;s westernmost shores, anchored by the cities of Toronto and Hamilton. Ports on the Canadian side include St. Catharines, Oshawa, Cobourg and Kingston, near the St. Lawrence River outlet. Close to 9 million people, or over a quarter of Canada&#x27;s population, live within the watershed of Lake Ontario. The American shore is largely rural, with the exception of Rochester and the much smaller ports at Oswego and Sackets Harbor. The city of Syracuse is inland, connected to the lake by the New York State Canal System. Over 2 million people live in Lake Ontario&#x27;s American watershed.

==Islands==

Several islands exist in the lake, the largest of which being Wolfe Island. Nearly all of Lake Ontario&#x27;s islands are on the eastern and northeastern shores, between the Prince Edward County headland and the lake&#x27;s outlet at Kingston, underlain by the basement rock found throughout the region. However, there exist several islands in the northwestern portion of the lake. Notable islands include:

* Amherst Island
* Association Island
* Big Island
* Galloo Island
* Garden Island
* Grenadier Island
* Little Galloo Island
* Nicholson Island
* Simcoe Island
* Toronto Islands (an island chain of 15 smaller islands)
* Waupoos Island
* Wolfe Island
==Navigation==
The Great Lakes Waterway connects the lake sidestream to the Atlantic Ocean via the Saint Lawrence Seaway and upstream to the other rivers in the chain via the Welland Canal and to Lake Erie. The Trent-Severn Waterway for pleasure boats connects Lake Ontario at the Bay of Quinte to Georgian Bay (Lake Huron) via Lake Simcoe. The Oswego Canal connects the lake at Oswego to the New York State Canal System, with outlets to the Hudson River, Lake Erie, and Lake Champlain. The Rideau Canal, also for pleasure boats, connects Lake Ontario at Kingston to the Ottawa River in downtown Ottawa, Ontario.

Several lighthouses exists throughout the lake to help with navigation. Notable historic examples include:

* Braddock Point Light
* Charlotte-Genesee Lighthouse
* Gibraltar Point Lighthouse
* Oswego Harbor West Pierhead Light
* Presqu&#x27;ile Lighthouse
* Selkirk Lighthouse
* Sodus Point Light
* Stony Point Light
* Thirty Mile Point Light

A land-based trail that roughly follows the lake&#x27;s shoreline also exists, the Great Lakes Circle Tour and Seaway Trail. The designated scenic road systems connects all of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. As the Seaway Trail is posted on the U.S. side only, Lake Ontario is the only of the five Great Lakes to have no posted bi-national circle tour.

==National marine sanctuary==

The Lake Ontario National Marine Sanctuary covers in U.S. waters in southeastern Lake Ontario. Designated on September 6, 2024, the national marine sanctuary protects historic shipwrecks and an area of great cultural, historical, and spiritual importance to the Native American peoples of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries and the Government of New York jointly administer the sanctuary.

==Economic impact==

Lake Ontario is the site of several major commercial ports including the Port of Toronto and the Port of Hamilton. Hamilton Harbour is the location of major steel production facilities.

The government of Ontario, which holds the lakebed rights of the Canadian portion of the lake under the Beds of Navigable Waters Act, does not permit wind power to be generated offshore. In &quot;Trillium Power Wind Corporation v. Ontario (Natural Resources)&quot;, the Superior Court of Justice held Trillium Power—since 2004 an &quot;Applicant of Record&quot; who had invested $35,000 in fees and, when in 2011 the Crown made a policy decision against offshore windfarms, claimed an injury of $2.25 billion—disclosed no reasonable cause of action.

The Great Lakes once supported an industrial-scale fishery, with record hauls in 1899; overfishing later blighted the industry. However, only recreational fishing activities exist in the 21st century.

<doc id="17948" wikidata="Q1169" url="?curid=17948" title="Lake Michigan">
<text>Lake Michigan ( ) is one of the five Great Lakes of North America. It is the second-largest of the Great Lakes by volume () and depth () after Lake Superior and the third-largest by surface area (), after Lake Superior and Lake Huron. To the east, its basin is conjoined with that of Lake Huron through the wide and deep Straits of Mackinac, giving it the same surface elevation as its eastern counterpart; hydrologically, the two bodies are a single lake that is, by area, the largest freshwater lake in the world.

Lake Michigan is the only Great Lake located fully in the United States; the other four are shared between the U.S. and Canada. It is the world&#x27;s largest lake, by area, located fully in one country, and is shared, from west to east, by the U.S. states of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. Ports along its shores include Chicago, Illinois, Gary, Indiana, Milwaukee and Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Muskegon, Michigan. To the north, the lake is flanked by long bays, including Green Bay in the northwest, and Grand Traverse and Little Traverse bays in the northeast. The word &quot;michigan&quot; is believed to come from the Ojibwe (&quot;michi-gami&quot; or &quot;mishigami&quot;), meaning &quot;great water&quot;.

== History ==
Some of the most well-studied early human inhabitants of the Lake Michigan region were the Hopewell Native Americans. Their culture declined after 800 AD, when, for the following few hundred years, the region was the home of peoples known as the Late Woodland Native Americans. In the early 17th century, when Western European explorers made their first forays into the region, they encountered descendants of the Late Woodland Native Americans, mainly the historic Chippewa, Menominee, Sauk, Fox, Winnebago, Miami, 
Ottawa and Potawatomi peoples. The French explorer Jean Nicolet is believed to have been the first European to reach Lake Michigan, possibly in 1634 or 1638. In the earliest European maps of the region, the name of Lake Illinois has been found (named for the Illinois Confederation of tribes), in addition to that of &quot;Michigan&quot;. During the 1640s and 1650s, the Beaver Wars (over the fur trade with the European colonies), initiated by the Iroquois, forced a massive demographic-shift, as their western neighbors fled the violence. The Iroquois sought refuge to the west and north of Lake Michigan.

The Straits of Mackinac were an important Native American travel corridor and fur-trade route. Located on the southern side of the straits sits the town of Mackinaw City, Michigan, the site of Fort Michilimackinac (a reconstructed French fort founded in 1715); on the northern side is St. Ignace, Michigan, site of a French Catholic mission to the Indians (founded in 1671). In 1673, Jacques Marquette, Louis Jolliet, and their crew of five Métis voyageurs followed Lake Michigan to Green Bay and up the Fox River, nearly to its headwaters, in their search for the Mississippi River. By the late 18th century, the eastern portions of the straits were controlled by Fort Mackinac on Mackinac Island, a British colonial and early American military base and fur trade center, founded in 1781.

With the advent of European exploration into the area in the late 17th century, Lake Michigan became used as part of a line of waterways leading from the Saint Lawrence River to the Mississippi River and thence to the Gulf of Mexico. French coureurs des bois and voyageurs established small ports and trading communities, such as Green Bay, on the lake during the late 17th and early 18th centuries. In the 19th century, Lake Michigan was integral to the development of Chicago and the Midwestern United States west of the lake. For example, 90% of the grain shipped from Chicago traveled by ships east over Lake Michigan during the years. The volume rarely fell below 50% after the Civil War even with the major expansion of railroad shipping.

The first person to reach the deep bottom of Lake Michigan was J. Val Klump, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee in 1985. Klump reached the bottom via submersible as part of a research expedition. The warming of Lake Michigan was the subject of a 2018 report by Purdue University. In each decade since 1980, steady increases in obscure surface temperature have occurred. This is likely to lead to decreasing native habitat and to adversely affect native species survival, including game fish.

== Hydrology ==
The Milwaukee Reef, running under Lake Michigan from a point between Milwaukee and Racine to a point between Grand Haven and Muskegon, divides the lake into northern and southern basins. Each basin has a clockwise flow of water, deriving from rivers and winds. Prevailing westerly winds tend to move the surface water toward the east, producing a moderating effect on the climate of western Michigan. There is a mean difference in summer water temperatures of 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 5 degrees Celsius) between the Wisconsin and Michigan shores.

Hydrologically Michigan and Huron are the same body of water (sometimes called Lake Michigan-Huron) but are normally considered distinct. Counted together, it is the largest body of fresh water in the world by surface area. The Mackinac Bridge is generally considered the dividing line between them. The main inflow to Lake Michigan from Lake Superior, through Lake Huron, is controlled by the locks operated by the bi-national Lake Superior Board of Control.

===Statistics===
Lake Michigan is the only Great Lake that is wholly within the borders of the United States; the others are shared with Canada. Lake Michigan has a surface area of ; ( lying in Michigan, in Wisconsin, in Indiana, &amp; in Illinois) making it the largest lake entirely within one country by surface area (Lake Baikal in Russia is larger by water volume) and the fifth-largest lake in the world.

It is the larger half of Lake Michigan–Huron, which is the largest body of fresh water in the world by surface area. It is long by wide with a shoreline long. The lake&#x27;s average depth is 46 fathoms 3 feet (279 ft; 85 m), while its greatest depth is 153 fathoms 5 feet (923 ft; 281 m). It contains a volume of 1,183 cubic miles (4,932 km3) of water. Green Bay in the northwest is its largest bay. Grand Traverse Bay in its northeast is another large bay. Lake Michigan&#x27;s deepest region, which lies in its northern half, is called Chippewa Basin (named after prehistoric Lake Chippewa) and is separated from South Chippewa Basin by a relatively shallower area called the Mid Lake Plateau.

=== Islands ===

* At , Beaver Island is the largest island in Lake Michigan; it is the namesake of an archipelago in Charlevoix County, Michigan, which includes Garden Island, Grape Island, Gull Island, Hat Island, High Island, Hog Island, Horseshoe Island, Little Island, Pismire Island, Shoe Island, Ojibwa Island, Trout Island, and Whiskey Island. Fisherman&#x27;s Island is also found in Charlevoix County.
* The Fox Islands in Leelanau County, Michigan, consist of North Fox Island and South Fox Island.
* The Manitou Islands in Leelanau County, Michigan, consist of North Manitou Island and South Manitou Island.
* Islands within Grand Traverse Bay include Bassett Island, Bellow Island, and Power Island.
* Islands south of the Garden Peninsula in Delta County, Michigan include Gravelly Island, Gull Island, Little Gull Island, Little Summer Island, Poverty Island, Rocky Island, St. Martin Island, and Summer Island.
* Islands in Big Bay de Noc in Delta County, Michigan include Round Island, St. Vital Island, and Snake Island.

* Green Island and St. Helena Island are in the vicinity of the Mackinac Bridge, in Mackinac County, Michigan.
* Islands surrounding the Door Peninsula in Wisconsin include Chambers Island, Fish Island, Gravel Island, Spider Island, Horseshoe Island, the Sister Islands, Detroit Island, Green Island, Hog Island, Pilot Island, Plum Island, Rock Island, the Strawberry Islands and Washington Island. The northern half of the peninsula is technically an island itself, due to the Sturgeon Bay Ship Canal.
* Northerly Island is a human-made peninsula in Chicago. It is the home of the Adler Planetarium, the former site of Meigs Field, and the current site of the temporary concert venue Huntington Bank Pavilion each summer.

=== Connection to other water bodies ===
In the mid 20th century, construction of the Saint Lawrence Seaway and Great Lakes Waterway opened the Great Lakes to ocean-going vessels. But the wider ocean-going container ships that were developed later do not fit through the locks on these routes, which limits shipping on the lakes. Lake freighters are used on the lakes that are too large to pass the locks and enter the ocean. Despite their vast size, large sections of the Great Lakes freeze in winter, interrupting most shipping. Some icebreakers ply the lakes.

Lake Michigan is connected by the Illinois Waterway to the Gulf of Mexico via the Illinois River and the Mississippi River. Commercial tug-and-barge traffic on these waterways is heavy. Pleasure boats can enter or exit the Great Lakes by way of the Erie Canal and Hudson River in New York. The Erie Canal connects to the Great Lakes at the east end of Lake Erie (at Buffalo, New York) and at the south side of Lake Ontario (at Oswego, New York).

=== Water level ===
The lake fluctuates from month to month with the highest lake levels typically occurring in summer. The normal high-water mark is above datum (&quot;&quot;). In October 1986, Lakes Michigan and Huron reached their highest level at above datum. The monthly average high-water records were broken for several months in a row in 2020.

Lake levels tend to be the lowest in winter. The normal low-water mark is below datum (&quot;577.5 ft or 176.0 m&quot;). In the winter of 1964, Lakes Michigan and Huron reached their lowest level at below datum. As with the high-water records, monthly low-water records were set each month from February 1964 through January 1965. During this twelve-month period, water levels ranged from below Chart Datum. The all-time low-water mark was eclipsed in January 2013.

In January 2013, Lake Michigan&#x27;s monthly mean water levels dipped to an all-time low of , reaching their lowest ebb since record keeping began in 1918. The lakes were below their long-term average and had declined 17 inches since January 2012. Keith Kompoltowicz, chief of watershed hydrology for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers&#x27; district office in Detroit, explained that biggest factors leading to the lower water levels in 2013 were a combination of the &quot;lack of a large snowpack&quot; in the winter of 2011/2012 coupled with very hot and dry conditions in the summer of 2012. Since then water levels rebounded, rising more than to historical record high levels.

===Drinking water===

Lake Michigan, like the other Great Lakes, supplies drinking water to millions of people in bordering areas.

The Great Lakes are collectively administered by the Conference of Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Governors and Premiers, intergovernmental organization led by the governing chief executives of the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Québec, and by the governors of the U.S. states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The Conference came into force, in December 2008, with the enactment of laws in all of the states and the two provinces, and the enactment of a United States federal law.

Environmental problems can still plague the lake. Steel mills and refineries operate near the Indiana shoreline. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported that BP is a major polluter, dumping thousands of pounds of raw sludge into the lake every day from its Whiting, Indiana, oil refinery. In March 2014 BP&#x27;s Whiting refinery was responsible for spilling more than of oil into the lake.

== Shoreline ==

=== Beaches ===

Lake Michigan has many beaches. The region is often referred to as the &quot;Third Coast&quot; of the United States, after those of the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The sand is often soft and off-white, known as &quot;singing sands&quot; because of the squeaking noise (caused by high quartz content) it emits when walked upon. Some beaches have sand dunes covered in green beach grass and sand cherries, and the water is usually clear and cool, between , even in the late summer months. However, because prevailing westerly winds tend to move the surface water toward the east, there is a flow of warmer water to the Michigan shore in the summer.

The sand dunes located on the east shore of Lake Michigan are the largest freshwater dune system in the world. In multiple locations along the shoreline, the dunes rise several hundred feet above the lake surface. Large dune formations can be seen in many state parks, national forests and national parks along the Indiana and Michigan shoreline. Some of the most expansive and unique dune formations can be found at Indiana Dunes National Park, Saugatuck Dunes State Park, Warren Dunes State Park, Hoffmaster State Park, Silver Lake State Park, Ludington State Park, and Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Small dune formations can be found on the western shore of Lake Michigan at Illinois Beach State Park, and moderate-sized dune formations can be found in Kohler-Andrae State Park and Point Beach State Forest in Wisconsin. A large dune formation can be found in Whitefish Dunes State Park in Wisconsin in the Door Peninsula. Lake Michigan beaches in Northern Michigan are the only place in the world, aside from a few inland lakes in that region, where Petoskey stones, the Michigan state stone, can be found.

The beaches of the western coast and the northernmost part of the east coast are often rocky, with some sandy beaches. The southern and eastern beaches are typically sandy and dune-covered. This is partly because of the prevailing winds from the west (which also cause thick layers of ice to build on the eastern shore in winter). The Chicago city waterfront has been developed for parks, beaches, harbors and marinas, and residential developments connected by the Chicago Lakefront Trail. Where there are no beaches or marinas, stone or concrete revetments protect the shoreline from erosion. The Chicago lakefront is accessible for about between the city&#x27;s southern and northern limits along the lake.

=== Cities ===

Twelve million people live along Lake Michigan&#x27;s shores, mainly in the Chicago and Milwaukee metropolitan areas. The economy of many communities in northern Michigan and Door County, Wisconsin, is supported by tourism, with large seasonal populations attracted by Lake Michigan. Many seasonal residents have summer homes along the waterfront and return to other homes for the winter. The southern tip of the lake near Gary, Indiana, is heavily industrialized.

=== Fishing ===
Lake Michigan is home to a small variety of fish species and other organisms. It was originally home to lake whitefish, lake trout, yellow perch, panfish, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass and bowfin, as well as some species of catfish. As a result of improvements to the Welland Canal in 1918, an invasion of sea lampreys and overharvesting, there has been a decline in native lake trout populations, ultimately causing an increase in the population of another invasive species, the alewife. As a result, salmonids, including various strains of brown trout, steelhead (rainbow trout), coho and chinook salmon, were introduced as predators in order to decrease the wildlife population. This program was so successful that the introduced population of trout and salmon exploded, resulting in the creation of a large sport fishery for these introduced species. Lake Michigan is now stocked annually with steelhead, brown trout, and coho and chinook salmon, which have also begun natural reproduction in some Lake Michigan tributaries. However, several introduced invasive species, such as lampreys, round goby, zebra mussels and quagga mussels, continue to cause major changes in water clarity and fertility, resulting in knock-on changes to Lake Michigan&#x27;s ecosystem, threatening the vitality of native fish populations.

Fisheries in inland waters of the United States are small compared to marine fisheries. The largest fisheries are the landings from the Great Lakes, worth about $14 million in 2001. Michigan&#x27;s commercial fishery today consists mainly of 150 tribe-licensed commercial fishing operations through the Chippewa-Ottawa Resource Authority and tribes belonging to the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission, which harvest 50 percent of the Great Lakes commercial catch in Michigan waters, and 45 state-licensed commercial fishing enterprises. The prime commercial species is the lake whitefish. The annual harvest declined from an average of from 1981 through to 1999 to more recent annual harvests of . The price for lake whitefish dropped from $1.04/lb. to as low as $0.40/lb during periods of high production.

Sports fishing includes salmon, whitefish, smelt, lake trout and walleye as major catches. In the late 1960s, successful stocking programs for Pacific salmon led to the development of Lake Michigan&#x27;s charter fishing industry.

=== Shipping ===
Like all of the Great Lakes, Lake Michigan is today used as a major mode of transport for bulk goods. In 2002, 162 million net tons of dry bulk cargo were moved via the Lakes. This was, in order of volume: iron ore, grain and potash. The iron ore and much of the stone and coal are used in the steel industry. There is also some shipping of liquid and containerized cargo, but most container vessels cannot pass the locks on the Saint Lawrence Seaway because the ships are too wide. The total amount of shipping on the lakes has been on a downward trend for several years. The Port of Chicago, operated by the Illinois International Port District, has grain (14 million bushels) and bulk liquid (800,000 barrels) storage facilities along Lake Calumet. The central element of the Port District, Calumet Harbor, is maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

=== Ferries ===

Two passenger and vehicle ferries operate ferry services across Lake Michigan, both connecting Wisconsin on the western shore with Michigan on the east. From May to October, the historic steamship, , operates daily between Manitowoc, Wisconsin, and Ludington, Michigan, connecting U.S. Highway 10 between the two cities. The &quot;Lake Express&quot;, established in 2004, carries passengers and vehicles across the lake between Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Muskegon, Michigan.

=== Tourism and recreation ===
Tourism and recreation are major industries on all of the Great Lakes. A few small cruise ships operate on Lake Michigan, including a couple of sailing ships. Many other water sports are practiced on the lakes, such as yachting, sea kayaking, diving, kitesurfing and lake surfing. Great Lakes passenger steamers have been operating since the mid-19th century. Several ferries currently operate on the Great Lakes to carry passengers to various islands, including Beaver Island and Bois Blanc Island (Michigan). Currently, two car ferry services traverse Lake Michigan from around April to November: the SS Badger, a steamer from Ludington, Michigan, to Manitowoc, Wisconsin, and the Lake Express, a high speed catamaran from Milwaukee to Muskegon, Michigan.

The Great Lakes Circle Tour, a designated scenic road system, connects all of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. The lake is a great place to view ice volcanoes, which typically occur at the start of the winter season.

<doc id="17949" wikidata="Q8763" url="?curid=17949" title="Fibonacci">
<text>Fibonacci (, ; ; – ) was an Italian mathematician from the Republic of Pisa, considered to be &quot;the most talented Western mathematician of the Middle Ages&quot;.

The name he is commonly called, &quot;Fibonacci&quot;, was made up in 1838 by the Franco-Italian historian Guillaume Libri and is short for (&#x27;son of Bonacci&#x27;). However, even earlier, in 1506, a notary of the Holy Roman Empire, Perizolo mentions Leonardo as &quot;Lionardo Fibonacci&quot;.
Fibonacci popularized the Indo–Arabic numeral system in the Western world primarily through his composition in 1202 of (&quot;Book of Calculation&quot;) and also introduced Europe to the sequence of Fibonacci numbers, which he used as an example in .

==Biography==
Fibonacci was born around 1170 to Guglielmo, an Italian merchant and customs official. Guglielmo directed a trading post in Bugia (Béjaïa), in modern-day Algeria. Fibonacci travelled with him as a young boy, and it was in Bugia (Algeria) where he was educated that he learned about the Hindu–Arabic numeral system.

Fibonacci travelled around the Mediterranean coast, meeting with many merchants and learning about their systems of doing arithmetic. He soon realised the many advantages of the Hindu-Arabic system, which, unlike the Roman numerals used at the time, allowed easy calculation using a place-value system. In 1202, he completed the (&quot;Book of Abacus&quot; or &quot;The Book of Calculation&quot;), which popularized Hindu–Arabic numerals in Europe.

Fibonacci was a guest of Emperor Frederick II, who enjoyed mathematics and science. A member of Frederick II&#x27;s court, John of Palermo, posed several questions based on Arab mathematical works for Fibonacci to solve. In 1240, the Republic of Pisa honored Fibonacci (referred to as Leonardo Bigollo) by granting him a salary in a decree that recognized him for the services that he had given to the city as an advisor on matters of accounting and instruction to citizens.

Fibonacci is thought to have died between 1240 and 1250, in Pisa.

==&quot;Liber Abaci&quot;==
In the (1202), Fibonacci introduced the so-called &quot;modus Indorum&quot; (method of the Indians), today known as the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, with ten digits including a zero and positional notation. The book showed the practical use and value of this by applying the numerals to commercial bookkeeping, converting weights and measures, calculation of interest, money-changing, and other applications. The book was well-received throughout educated Europe and had a profound impact on European thought. Replacing Roman numerals, its ancient Egyptian multiplication method, and using an abacus for calculations, was an advance in making business calculations easier and faster, which assisted the growth of banking and accounting in Europe.

The original 1202 manuscript is not known to exist. In a 1228 copy of the manuscript, the first section introduces the numeral system and compares it with others, such as Roman numerals, and methods to convert numbers to it. The second section explains uses in business, for example converting different currencies, and calculating profit and interest, which were important to the growing banking industry. The book also discusses irrational numbers and prime numbers.

==Fibonacci sequence==

 posed and solved a problem involving the growth of a population of rabbits based on idealized assumptions. The solution, generation by generation, was a sequence of numbers later known as Fibonacci numbers. Although Fibonacci&#x27;s contains the earliest known description of the sequence outside of India, the sequence had been described by Indian mathematicians as early as the sixth century.

In the Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. Fibonacci omitted the &quot;0&quot; and first &quot;1&quot; included today and began the sequence with 1, 2, 3, ... . He carried the calculation up to the thirteenth place, the value 233, though another manuscript carries it to the next place, the value 377. Fibonacci did not speak about the golden ratio as the limit of the ratio of consecutive numbers in this sequence.

==Legacy==
In the 19th century, a statue of Fibonacci was set in Pisa. Today it is located in the western gallery of the Camposanto, historical cemetery on the Piazza dei Miracoli.

There are many mathematical concepts named after Fibonacci because of a connection to the Fibonacci numbers. Examples include the Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity, the Fibonacci search technique, and the Pisano period. Beyond mathematics, namesakes of Fibonacci include the asteroid 6765 Fibonacci and the art rock band The Fibonaccis.

<doc id="17951" wikidata="Q1066" url="?curid=17951" title="Lake Superior">
<text>Lake Superior is the largest freshwater lake in the world by surface area and the third-largest freshwater lake by volume, holding 10% of the fresh water in all of the world&#x27;s rivers and lakes. Located in central North America, it is the northernmost and westernmost of the Great Lakes of North America, straddling the Canada–United States border with the Canadian province of Ontario to the north and east and the U.S. states of Minnesota to the west and Michigan and Wisconsin to the south. It drains into Lake Huron via St. Marys River, then through the lower Great Lakes to the St. Lawrence River and ultimately the Atlantic Ocean.

==Name==

The Ojibwe name for the lake is &quot;gichi-gami&quot; (in syllabics: , pronounced &quot;gitchi-gami&quot; or &quot;kitchi-gami&quot; in different dialects), meaning &quot;great sea&quot;. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote this name as &quot;Gitche Gumee&quot; in the poem &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;, as did Gordon Lightfoot in his song &quot;The Wreck of the &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;&quot;.

According to other sources, the full Ojibwe name is &quot;Ojibwe Gichigami&quot; (&quot;Ojibwe&#x27;s Great Sea&quot;) or &quot;Anishinaabe Gichigami&quot; (&quot;Anishinaabe&#x27;s Great Sea&quot;). The 1878 dictionary by Father Frederic Baraga, the first one written for the Ojibway language, gives the Ojibwe name as &quot;Otchipwe-kitchi-gami&quot; (a transliteration of &quot;Ojibwe Gichigami&quot;).

In the 17th century, the first French explorers approached the great inland sea by way of the Ottawa River and Lake Huron; they referred to their discovery as &quot;le lac supérieur&quot; (the upper lake, i.e., above Lake Huron). Some 17th-century Jesuit missionaries referred to it as &quot;Lac Tracy&quot; (for Alexandre de Prouville de Tracy). After taking control of the region from the French in the 1760s, following their defeat in the French and Indian War, the British anglicized the lake&#x27;s name to &quot;Superior&quot;, &quot;on account of its being superior in magnitude to any of the lakes on that vast continent&quot;.

==Hydrography==
Lake Superior empties into Lake Huron via the St. Marys River and the Soo Locks (Sault Ste. Marie locks). Lake Superior is the largest freshwater lake in the world by area and the third largest in volume, behind Lake Baikal in Siberia and Lake Tanganyika in East Africa. The Caspian Sea, while larger than Lake Superior in both surface area and volume, is brackish.

Lake Superior has a surface area of , which is approximately the size of South Carolina or Austria. It has a maximum length of and maximum breadth of . Its average depth is with a maximum depth of . Lake Superior contains 2,900 cubic miles (12,100 km3) of water. There is enough water in Lake Superior to cover the entire land mass of North and South America to a depth of . The shoreline of the lake stretches (including islands). The lake boasts a very small ratio (1.55) of catchment area to surface area, which indicates minimal terrestrial influence.

American limnologist J. Val Klump was the first person to reach the lowest depth of Lake Superior on July 30, 1985, as part of a scientific expedition, which at 122 fathoms 1-foot () below sea level is the second-lowest spot in the continental interior of the United States and the third-lowest spot in the interior of the North American continent after Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories of Canada ( below sea level) and Iliamna Lake in Alaska . (Though Crater Lake is the deepest lake in the United States and deeper than Lake Superior, Crater Lake&#x27;s elevation is higher and consequently its deepest point is &quot;above&quot; sea level.)

While the temperature of the surface of Lake Superior varies seasonally, the temperature below is an almost constant . This variation in temperature makes the lake seasonally stratified. Twice per year, however, the water column reaches a uniform temperature of from top to bottom, and the lake waters thoroughly mix. This feature makes the lake dimictic. Because of its volume, Lake Superior has a retention time of 191 years.

Annual storms on Lake Superior regularly feature wave heights of over . Waves well over have been recorded.

===Tributaries===
Lake Superior is fed by more than 200 rivers, including the Nipigon River, the St. Louis River, the Pigeon River, the Pic River, the White River, the Michipicoten River, the Bois Brule River and the Kaministiquia River. The lake&#x27;s outlet at St. Marys River has a relatively steep gradient with rapids. The Soo Locks enable ships to bypass the rapids and to overcome the height difference between Lakes Superior and Huron.

===Water levels===
The lake&#x27;s average surface elevation is above sea level. Until approximately 1887, the natural hydraulic conveyance through the St. Marys River rapids determined the outflow from Lake Superior. By 1921, development in support of transportation and hydroelectric power resulted in gates, locks, power canals and other control structures completely spanning St. Marys rapids. The regulating structure is known as the Compensating Works and is operated according to a regulation plan known as Plan 1977-A. Water levels, including diversions of water from the Hudson Bay watershed, are regulated by the International Lake Superior Board of Control, which was established in 1914 by the International Joint Commission.

Lake Superior&#x27;s water level was at a new record low in September 2007, slightly less than the previous record low in 1926. Water levels recovered within a few days.

The lake&#x27;s water level fluctuates from month to month, with the highest lake levels in October and November. The normal high-water mark is above the datum (). In the summer of 1985, Lake Superior reached its highest recorded level at above the datum. 2019 and 2020 set new high-water records in nearly every month.

The lake&#x27;s lowest levels occur in March and April. The normal low-water mark is below the datum. In the winter of 1926, Lake Superior reached its lowest recorded level at below the datum. Additionally, the entire first half of the year (January to June) included record low months. The low water was a continuation of the dropping lake levels from the previous year, 1925, which set low-water records for October through December. During the nine-month period of October 1925 to June 1926, water levels ranged from below Chart Datum. In the summer of 2007 monthly historic lows were set; August at , and September at .

===Climate change===
According to a study by professors at the University of Minnesota Duluth, Lake Superior may have warmed faster than its surrounding area. Summer surface temperatures in the lake appeared to have increased by about between 1979 and 2007, compared with an approximately increase in the surrounding average air temperature. The increase in the lake&#x27;s surface temperature may be related to the decreasing ice cover. Less winter ice cover allows more solar radiation to penetrate and warm the water. If trends continue, Lake Superior, which freezes over completely once every 20 years, could routinely be ice-free by 2040 although more current data through 2021 does not support this trend.

Warmer temperatures could lead to more snow in the lake effect snow belts along the shores of the lake, especially in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Two recent consecutive winters (2013–2014 and 2014–2015) brought high ice coverage to the Great Lakes, and on March 6, 2014, overall ice coverage peaked at 92.5%, the second-highest in recorded history. Lake Superior&#x27;s ice coverage further beat 2014&#x27;s record in 2019, reaching 95% coverage.

==Geography==
The largest island in Lake Superior is Isle Royale in Michigan. Isle Royale contains several lakes, some of which also contain islands. Other well-known islands include Madeline Island in Wisconsin, Michipicoten Island in Ontario, and Grand Island (the location of the Grand Island National Recreation Area) in Michigan.

The larger cities on Lake Superior include the twin ports of Duluth, Minnesota, and Superior, Wisconsin; Thunder Bay, Ontario; Marquette, Michigan; and the twin cities of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Duluth-Superior, at the western end of Lake Superior, is the most inland point on the Saint Lawrence Seaway and the most inland port in the world.

Among the scenic places on the lake are Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, Brockway Mountain Drive on the Keweenaw Peninsula, Isle Royale National Park, Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park, Pukaskwa National Park, Lake Superior Provincial Park, Grand Island National Recreation Area, Sleeping Giant (Ontario) and Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. The Great Lakes Circle Tour is a designated scenic road system connecting all of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.

==Climate==
Lake Superior&#x27;s size reduces the severity of the seasons of its humid continental climate (more typically seen in locations like Nova Scotia). The water surface&#x27;s slow reaction to temperature changes, seasonally ranging between around 1970, helps to moderate surrounding air temperatures in the summer (cooler with frequent sea breeze formations) and winter, and creates lake-effect snow in colder months. The hills and mountains that border the lake hold moisture and fog, particularly in the fall.

==Geology==
The rocks of Lake Superior&#x27;s northern shore date back to the early history of the earth. During the Precambrian (between 4.5 billion and 540 million years ago) magma forcing its way to the surface created the intrusive granites of the Canadian Shield. These ancient granites can be seen on the North Shore today. It was during the Penokean orogeny, part of the process that created the Great Lakes tectonic zone, that many valuable metals were deposited. The region surrounding the lake has proved to be rich in minerals, with copper, iron, silver, gold and nickel the most frequently mined. Notable production includes gold from the Hemlo mine near Marathon, copper from the Keweenaw Peninsula and the Mamainse Point Formation, iron from the Gogebic Range, silver at Silver Islet, and uranium at Theano Point.

The mountains steadily eroded, depositing layers of sediments that compacted and became limestone, dolomite, taconite and the shale at Kakabeka Falls. The continental crust was later riven, creating one of the deepest rifts in the world. The lake lies in this long-extinct Mesoproterozoic rift valley, the Midcontinent Rift. Magma was injected between layers of sedimentary rock, forming diabase sills. This hard diabase protects the layers of sedimentary rock below, forming the flat-topped mesas in the Thunder Bay area. Amethyst formed in some of the cavities created by the Midcontinent Rift, and there are several amethyst mines in the Thunder Bay area.

Lava erupted from the rift and formed the black basalt rock of Michipicoten Island, Black Bay Peninsula, and St. Ignace Island.

In the most recent geological history, during the Wisconsin glaciation 10,000 years ago, ice covered the region at a thickness of . The land contours familiar today were carved by the advance and retreat of the ice sheet. The retreat left gravel, sand, clay and boulder deposits. Glacial meltwaters gathered in the Superior basin creating Lake Minong, a precursor to Lake Superior. Without the immense weight of the ice, the land rebounded, and a drainage outlet formed at Sault Ste. Marie, becoming today&#x27;s St. Mary&#x27;s River.

==History==
The first people came to the Lake Superior region 10,000 years ago after the retreat of the glaciers in the Last Glacial Period. They are known as the Plano, and they used stone-tipped spears to hunt caribou on the northwestern side of Lake Minong. The Shield Archaic peoples arrived around 5000 BC; evidence of this culture can be found at the eastern and western ends of the Canadian shore. They used bows and arrows, paddled dugout canoes, fished, hunted, mined copper for tools and weapons, and established trading networks. They are believed to be the direct ancestors of the Ojibwe and Cree. The people of the Laurel complex (c. 500 BC to AD 500) developed seine net fishing, evidence being found at rivers around Superior such as the Pic and Michipicoten. The people of the Terminal Woodland period were evident in the area from AD 900 to 1650. They were Algonquian peoples who hunted, fished and gathered berries. They used snowshoes, birch bark canoes and conical or domed lodges. At the mouth of the Michipicoten River, nine layers of encampments have been discovered. Most of the Pukaskwa Pits were likely made during this time.

The Anishinaabe people (an ethnic grouping including the Ojibwe/Chippewa) have inhabited the Lake Superior region for over five hundred years and were preceded by the Dakota, Meskwaki (Fox), Menominee, Nipigon, Noquet and Gros Ventres. After the arrival of Europeans, the Anishinaabe made themselves middle-men between the French fur traders and other Native peoples. They soon became the dominant Native American nation in the region: they forced out the Sioux and Fox and won a victory against the Iroquois west of Sault Ste. Marie in 1662. By the mid-18th century, the Ojibwe occupied all of Lake Superior&#x27;s shores.

In the 18th century, as the booming fur trade supplied Europe with beaver hats, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company had a virtual monopoly in the region until 1783, when the rival North West Company was formed. The North West Company built forts on Lake Superior at Grand Portage, Fort William, Nipigon, the Pic River, the Michipicoten River, and Sault Ste. Marie. But by 1821, with competition harming the profits of both, the companies merged under the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company name. Many towns around the lake are current or former mining areas, or engaged in processing or shipping. Today, tourism is another significant industry: the sparsely populated Lake Superior country, with its rugged shorelines and wilderness, attracts vacationers and adventurers.

===Shipping===
Lake Superior has been an important link in the Great Lakes Waterway, providing a route for the transportation of iron ore as well as grain and other mined and manufactured materials. Large cargo vessels called lake freighters, as well as smaller ocean-going freighters, transport these commodities across Lake Superior. Shipping was slow to arrive at Lake Superior in the 19th century. The first steamboat to run on the lake was the &quot;Independence&quot; in 1847, whereas the first steamers on the other Great Lakes began sailing in 1816. Ice closes the lake shipping from mid-January to late March. Exact dates for the shipping season vary each year, depending on weather conditions that form and break the ice.

===Shipwrecks===
The southern shore of Lake Superior between Grand Marais, Michigan, and Whitefish Point is known as the &quot;Graveyard of the Great Lakes&quot;; more ships have been lost around the Whitefish Point area than any other part of Lake Superior. These shipwrecks are now protected by the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve. Storms that claimed multiple ships include the Mataafa Storm in November 1905 and the Great Lakes Storm of 1913.

Wreckage of —a ore carrier that sank on October 11, 1907, during a Lake Superior storm in 77 fathoms () of water—was located in August 2007. Built in Lorain, Ohio, &quot;Cyprus&quot; was launched August 17, 1907, and was lost on her second voyage hauling iron ore from Superior, Wisconsin, to Buffalo, New York, with the sole survivor among her 23 crew being Charles G. Pitz. In 1918 the last warships to sink in the Great Lakes, French minesweepers &quot;Inkerman&quot; and &quot;Cerisoles&quot;, vanished in a Lake Superior storm, perhaps upon striking the uncharted danger of the Superior Shoal in an otherwise deep part of the lake. With 78 crewmembers dead, their sinking marked the largest loss of life on Lake Superior to date.

 is the last ship that sank in Lake Superior, from Whitefish Point in a storm on November 10, 1975. The wreck was immortalized by Gordon Lightfoot in his ballad &quot;The Wreck of the &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;&quot;. All 29 crew members died, and no bodies were recovered. &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; was battered so intensely by Lake Superior that the ship split in half; her two pieces lie approximately apart at a depth of 88 fathoms ().

Lightfoot sings that &quot;The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead&quot;. This is because of the unusually cold water, under on average around 1970. Normally, bacteria decaying a sunken body will bloat it with gas, causing it to float to the surface after a few days. But Lake Superior&#x27;s water is cold enough year-round to inhibit bacterial growth, and bodies tend to sink and never resurface. Joe MacInnis reported that in July 1994, explorer Frederick Shannon&#x27;s Expedition 94 to the wreck of &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; discovered a man&#x27;s body near the port side of her pilothouse, not far from the open door, &quot;fully clothed, wearing an orange life jacket, and lying face down in the sediment&quot;.

In February 2024, it was announced that wreckage from the &quot;Arlington&quot; was discovered from a sinking in 1940.

==Ecology==

More than 80 species of fish have been found in Lake Superior. Species native to the lake include banded killifish, bloater, brook trout, burbot, cisco, lake sturgeon, lake trout, lake whitefish, longnose sucker, muskellunge, northern pike, pumpkinseed, rock bass, round whitefish, smallmouth bass, walleye, white sucker and yellow perch. In addition, many fish species have been either intentionally or accidentally introduced to Lake Superior: Atlantic salmon, brown trout, carp, chinook salmon, coho salmon, freshwater drum, pink salmon, rainbow smelt, rainbow trout, round goby, ruffe, sea lamprey and white perch.

Lake Superior has fewer dissolved nutrients relative to its water volume than the other Great Lakes and so is less productive in terms of fish populations and is an oligotrophic lake. This is a result of the underdeveloped soils found in its relatively small watershed. It is also a reflection of relatively small human population and small amount of agriculture in its watershed. However, nitrate concentrations in the lake have been continuously rising for more than a century. They are still much lower than levels considered dangerous to human health; but this steady, long-term rise is an unusual record of environmental nitrogen buildup. It may relate to anthropogenic alternations to the regional nitrogen cycle, but researchers are still unsure of the causes of this change to the lake&#x27;s ecology.

As for other Great Lakes fish, populations have also been affected by the accidental or intentional introduction of foreign species such as the sea lamprey and Eurasian ruffe. Accidental introductions have occurred in part by the removal of natural barriers to navigation between the Great Lakes. Overfishing has also been a factor in the decline of fish populations.

<doc id="17955" wikidata="Q2079" url="?curid=17955" title="Leipzig">
<text>Leipzig (, ; ; Upper Saxon: ; ) is the most populous city in the German state of Saxony. The city has a population of 628,718 inhabitants as of 2023. It is the eighth-largest city in Germany and is part of the Central German Metropolitan Region. The name of the city is usually interpreted as a Slavic term meaning &quot;place of linden trees&quot;, in line with many other Slavic placenames in the region.

Leipzig is located about southwest of Berlin, in the southernmost part of the North German Plain (the Leipzig Bay), at the confluence of the White Elster and its tributaries Pleiße and Parthe. The Leipzig Riverside Forest, Europe&#x27;s largest intra-city riparian forest, has developed along these rivers. 

Leipzig is at the centre of Neuseenland (&quot;new lake district&quot;). This district has several artificial lakes created from former lignite open-pit mines.

Leipzig has been a trade city since at least the time of the Holy Roman Empire. Via Regia and the Via Imperii, two important medieval trade routes, intersected here, marking the city&#x27;s economic importance. Leipzig&#x27;s trade fair dates to 1190. Between 1764 and 1945, the city was a centre of publishing. After the Second World War and during the period of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), Leipzig continued as a major urban centre in East Germany. But overall, because of isolation behind the Iron Curtain, its cultural and economic importance declined.

Events in Leipzig in 1989 played a significant role in precipitating the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe, mainly through demonstrations starting from St. Nicholas Church. The immediate effects of the reunification of Germany included the collapse of the local economy (which was dependent on the highly polluting heavy industry), severe unemployment, and urban blight. 

By the early 2000s the decline had reversed, and since then Leipzig has undergone some significant changes. It has had urban and economic rejuvenation, and modernisation of the transport infrastructure.

Leipzig is home to one of the oldest universities in Europe (Leipzig University). It is the main seat of the German National Library (the second is Frankfurt), the seat of the German Music Archive, as well as of the German Federal Administrative Court. Leipzig Zoo is one of the most modern zoos in Europe and as of 2018 ranks first in Germany and second in Europe. 

Leipzig&#x27;s late-19th-century Gründerzeit architecture consists of around 12,500 buildings. The city&#x27;s central railway terminus Leipzig Hauptbahnhof is, at 83,460 square metres (898,400 sq ft), Europe&#x27;s largest railway station measured by floor area. Since Leipzig City Tunnel came into operation in 2013, it has formed the centrepiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland (&quot;S-Bahn Central Germany&quot;) public transit system, Germany&#x27;s largest S-Bahn network, with a system length of 802 km (498 mi).

Leipzig has long been a major centre for music, including classical and modern dark wave. The Thomanerchor (English: St. Thomas Choir of Leipzig), a boys&#x27; choir, was founded in 1212. The Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, established in 1743, is one of the oldest symphony orchestras in the world. Several well-known composers lived and worked in Leipzig, including Johann Sebastian Bach (1723 to 1750), Felix Mendelssohn (1835 to 1847), and Richard Wagner, born in 1813. The University of Music and Theatre &quot;Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy&quot; was founded in 1843. The Oper Leipzig, one of the most prominent opera houses in Germany, was founded in 1693. During a stay in Gohlis, which is now part of the city, Friedrich Schiller wrote his poem &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;.

==Names==

A once common English spelling of the city&#x27;s name was &#x27;, beside many variants. The Latin name &#x27; was also used in many languages and in the academic publications of the city&#x27;s university.

===Etymology===
The name &quot;Leipzig&quot; is commonly held to derive from &quot;lipa&quot;, the common Slavic designation for linden trees, making the city&#x27;s name etymologically related to Lipetsk, Russia. Based on medieval attestations like &quot;Lipzk&quot; (c. 1190), the original Slavic name of the city has been reconstructed as &quot;*Lipьsko&quot;, which is also reflected in similar forms in neighbouring modern Slavic languages (Sorbian/Polish &quot;Lipsk&quot;, Czech &quot;Lipsko&quot;). This has, however, been questioned by more recent onomastic research based on the very oldest forms like &quot;Libzi&quot; (c. 1015).

===Epithets===
Due to the etymology mentioned above, &quot;Lindenstadt&quot; or &quot;Stadt der Linden&quot; (City of Linden Trees) are common poetic epithets for the city.

Another, somewhat old-fashioned epithet is &quot;Pleiß-Athen&quot; (Athens on the Pleiße River), hinting at Leipzig&#x27;s long academic and literary tradition, as the seat of one of the oldest German universities and a centre of the book trade.

It is also referred to as &quot;Little Paris&quot; (&quot;Klein-Paris&quot;) after a line from Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust I&quot;, which is partly set in the famous Leipzig restaurant &quot;Auerbachs Keller&quot;.

In 1937 the Nazi government awarded the city the epithet &quot;&quot; (Reich Trade Fair City Leipzig).

In 1989 Leipzig was dubbed a Hero City (&quot;Heldenstadt&quot;), a title that the Soviet Union awarded to some of its cities for their key role in World War II. In Leipzig&#x27;s case, though, this was an informal allusion to its role in the fall of the East German regime (through the Monday demonstrations).

More recently, the city has sometimes been nicknamed &quot;Hypezig&quot;, the &quot;Boomtown of eastern Germany&quot;, or &quot;The better Berlin&quot; (&quot;Das bessere Berlin&quot;) and is celebrated by the media as a hip urban centre for its vibrant lifestyle and creative scene with many startups.

==Geography==


===Location===
Leipzig is located in the Leipzig Bay, the southernmost part of the North German Plain, which is the part of the North European Plain in Germany. The city sits on the White Elster, a river that rises in the Czech Republic and flows into the Saale south of Halle. The Pleiße and the Parthe join the White Elster in Leipzig, and the large inland delta-like landscape the three rivers form is called &quot;Leipziger Gewässerknoten&quot;. The site is characterized by swampy areas such as the Leipzig Riparian Forest (&quot;Leipziger Auenwald&quot;), though there are also some limestone areas to the north of the city. The landscape is mostly flat, though there is also some evidence of moraine and drumlins.

Although there are some forest parks within the city limits, the area surrounding Leipzig is relatively unforested. During the 20th century, there were several open-pit mines in the region, many of which have been converted to lakes.

Leipzig is also situated at the intersection of the ancient roads known as the Via Regia (King&#x27;s highway), which traversed Germany in an east–west direction, and the Via Imperii (Imperial highway), a north–south road.

Leipzig was a walled city in the Middle Ages and the current &quot;ring&quot; road around the historic centre of the city follows the line of the old city walls.

===Subdivision===

Since 1992 Leipzig has been divided administratively into ten &quot;Stadtbezirke&quot; (boroughs), which in turn contain a total of 63 &quot;Ortsteile&quot; (localities). Some of these correspond to outlying villages which have been annexed by Leipzig.


===Neighbouring communities===
===Climate===
Like many cities in Eastern Germany, Leipzig has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;), with significant continental influences due to its inland location. Winters are cold, with an average temperature of around . Summers are generally warm, averaging at with daytime temperatures of . Precipitation in winter is about half that of the summer. The amount of sunshine differs significantly between winter and summer, with an average of around 51 hours of sunshine in December (1.7 hours per day) compared with 229 hours of sunshine in July (7.4 hours per day).
==History==
===Origins===

Leipzig was first documented in 1015 in the chronicles of Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg as &quot; (, VII, 25) and endowed with city and market privileges in 1165 by Otto the Rich. Leipzig Trade Fair, started in the Middle Ages, has become an event of international importance and is the oldest surviving trade fair in the world. This encouraged the growth of the Leipzig merchant bourgeoisie.

There are records of commercial fishing operations on the river Pleiße that, most likely, refer to Leipzig dating back to 1305, when the Margrave Dietrich the Younger granted the fishing rights to the church and convent of St Thomas.

There were a number of monasteries in and around the city, including a Franciscan monastery after which the Barfußgäßchen (Barefoot Alley) is named and a monastery of Irish monks (, destroyed in 1544) near the present day (the old &quot;).

The University of Leipzig was founded in 1409 and Leipzig developed into an important centre of German law and of the publishing industry in Germany, resulting, in the 19th and 20th centuries, with the Reichsgericht (Imperial Court of Justice) and the German National Library being located here.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, two battles took place in , about outside Leipzig city walls. The first Battle of Breitenfeld took place in 1631 and the second in 1642. Both battles resulted in victories for the Swedish-led side.

On 24 December 1701, when Franz Conrad Romanus was mayor, an oil-fueled street lighting system was introduced. The city employed light guards who had to follow a specific schedule to ensure the punctual lighting of the 700 lanterns.

===19th century===

The Leipzig region was the arena of the 1813 Battle of Leipzig between Napoleonic France and an allied coalition of Prussia, Russia, Austria and Sweden. It was the largest battle in Europe before the First World War and the coalition victory ended Napoleon&#x27;s presence in Germany and would ultimately lead to his first exile on Elba. The Monument to the Battle of the Nations celebrating the centenary of this event was completed in 1913. In addition to stimulating German nationalism, the war had a major impact in mobilizing a civic spirit in numerous volunteer activities. Many volunteer militias and civic associations were formed, and collaborated with churches and the press to support local and state militias, patriotic wartime mobilization, humanitarian relief and postwar commemorative practices and rituals. While over half of the Kingdom of Saxony was formally ceded to Prussia, Leipzig remained part of King Frederick Augustus I.

When it was made a terminus of the first German long-distance railway to Dresden (the capital of Saxony) in 1839, Leipzig became a hub of Central European railway traffic, with Leipzig Hauptbahnhof the largest terminal station by area in Europe. The railway station has two grand entrance halls, the eastern one for the Royal Saxon State Railways and the western one for the Prussian state railways.

In the 19th century, Leipzig was a centre of the German and Saxon liberal movements. The first German labor party, the General German Workers&#x27; Association (&quot;Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein&quot;, ADAV) was founded in Leipzig on 23 May 1863 by Ferdinand Lassalle; about 600 workers from across Germany travelled to the foundation on the new railway. Leipzig expanded rapidly to more than 700,000 inhabitants. Huge areas were built, which mostly survived both war and post-war demolition.
===20th century===

With the opening of a fifth production hall in 1907, the Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei became the largest cotton mill company on the continent, housing over 240,000 spindles. Yearly production surpassed 5 million kilograms of yarn.

During World War I, in 1917, the American Consulate was closed, and its building became a temporary place of stay for Americans and Allied refugees from Serbia, Romania and Japan.

During the 1930s and 1940s, music was prominent throughout Leipzig. Many students attended Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy College of Music and Theatre (then named Landeskonservatorium.) However, in 1944, it was closed due to World War II. It re-opened soon after the war ended in 1945.

On 22 May 1930, Carl Friedrich Goerdeler was elected mayor of Leipzig. He later became an opponent of the Nazi regime. He resigned in 1937 when, in his absence, his Nazi deputy ordered the destruction of the city&#x27;s statue of Felix Mendelssohn. On Kristallnacht in 1938, the 1855 Moorish Revival Leipzig synagogue, one of the city&#x27;s most architecturally significant buildings, was deliberately destroyed. Goerdeler was later executed by the Nazis on 2 February 1945.

Several thousand forced labourers were stationed in Leipzig during the Second World War.

Beginning in 1933, many Jewish citizens of Leipzig were members of the Gemeinde, a large Jewish religious community spread throughout Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In October 1935, the Gemeinde helped found the Lehrhaus (English: a house of study) in Leipzig to provide different forms of studies to Jewish students who were prohibited from attending any institutions in Germany. Jewish studies were emphasized and much of the Jewish community of Leipzig became involved.

Like all other cities claimed by the Nazis, Leipzig was subject to aryanisation. Beginning in 1933 and increasing in 1939, Jewish business owners were forced to give up their possessions and stores. This eventually intensified to the point where Nazi officials were strong enough to evict the Jews from their own homes. They also had the power to force many of the Jews living in the city to sell their houses. Many people who sold their homes emigrated elsewhere, outside of Leipzig. Others moved to Judenhäuser, which were smaller houses that acted as ghettos, housing large groups of people.

The Jews of Leipzig were greatly affected by the Nuremberg Laws. However, due to the Leipzig Trade Fair and the international attention it garnered, Leipzig was especially cautious about its public image. Despite this, the Leipzig authorities were not afraid to strictly apply and enforce anti-semitic measures.

On 20 December 1937, after the Nazis took control of the city, they renamed it Reichsmessestadt Leipzig, meaning the &quot;Imperial Trade Fair City Leipzig&quot;. In early 1938, Leipzig saw an increase in Zionism through Jewish citizens. Many of these Zionists attempted to flee before deportations began. On 28 October 1938, Heinrich Himmler ordered the deportation of Polish Jews from Leipzig to Poland. The Polish Consulate sheltered 1,300 Polish Jews, preventing their deportation.

On 9 November 1938, as part of Kristallnacht, in Gottschedstrasse, synagogues and businesses were set on fire. Only a couple of days later, on 11 November 1938, many Jews in the Leipzig area were deported to the Buchenwald Concentration Camp. As World War II came to an end, much of Leipzig was destroyed. Following the war, the Communist Party of Germany provided aid for the reconstruction of the city.

In 1933, a census recorded that over 11,000 Jews were living in Leipzig. In the 1939 census, the number had fallen to roughly 4,500, and by January 1942 only 2,000 remained. In that month, these 2,000 Jews began to be deported. On 13 July 1942, 170 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz concentration camp. On 19 September 1942, 440 Jews were deported from Leipzig to Theresienstadt concentration camp. On 18 June 1943, the remaining 18 Jews still in Leipzig were deported from Leipzig to Auschwitz. According to records of the two waves of deportations to Auschwitz there were no survivors. According to records of the Theresienstadt deportation, only 53 Jews survived.
During the German invasion of Poland at the start of World War II, in September 1939, the Gestapo carried out arrests of prominent local Poles, and seized the Polish Consulate and its library. In 1941, the American Consulate was also closed by order of the German authorities. During the war, Leipzig was the location of five subcamps of the Buchenwald concentration camp, in which over 8,000 men, women and children were imprisoned, mostly Polish, Jewish, Soviet and French, but also Italian, Czech and Belgian. In April 1945, most surviving prisoners were sent on death marches to various destinations in Saxony and German-occupied Czechoslovakia, whereas prisoners of the Leipzig-Thekla subcamp who were unable to march were either burned alive, shot or beaten to death by the Gestapo, SS, &quot;Volkssturm&quot; and German civilians in the Abtnaundorf massacre. Some were rescued by Polish forced laborers of another camp; at least 67 people survived. 84 victims were buried on 27 April 1945, however, the total number of victims remains unknown.
During World War II, Leipzig was repeatedly struck by Allied bombing raids, beginning in 1943 and lasting until 1945. The first raid occurred on the morning of 4 December 1943, when 442 bombers of the Royal Air Force (RAF) dropped a total amount of almost 1,400 tons of explosives and incendiaries on the city, destroying large parts of the city centre. This bombing was the largest up to that time. Due to the close proximity of many of the buildings hit, a firestorm occurred. This prompted firefighters to rush to the city; however, they were unable to control the fires. Unlike the firebombing of the neighbouring city of Dresden, this was a largely conventional bombing with high explosives rather than incendiaries. The resultant pattern of loss was a patchwork, rather than wholesale loss of its centre, but was nevertheless extensive.

The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Leipzig in late April 1945. The U.S. 2nd Infantry Division and U.S. 69th Infantry Division fought their way into the city on 18 April and completed its capture after fierce urban action, in which fighting was often house-to-house and block-to-block, on 19 April 1945. In April 1945, the Mayor of Leipzig, SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; Alfred Freyberg, his wife and daughter, together with Deputy Mayor and City Treasurer Ernest Kurt Lisso, his wife, daughter and &quot;Volkssturm&quot; Major and former Mayor Walter Dönicke, all committed suicide in Leipzig City Hall.

The United States turned the city over to the Red Army as it pulled back from the line of contact with Soviet forces in July 1945 to the designated occupation zone boundaries. Leipzig became one of the major cities of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).

Following the end of World War II in 1945, Leipzig saw a slow return of Jews to the city. They were joined by large numbers of German refugees who had been expelled from Central and Eastern Europe in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.

In the mid-20th century, the city&#x27;s trade fair assumed renewed importance as a point of contact with the Comecon Eastern Europe economic bloc, of which East Germany was a member. At this time, trade fairs were held at a site in the south of the city, near the Monument to the Battle of the Nations.

The planned economy of the German Democratic Republic, however, was not kind to Leipzig. Before the Second World War, Leipzig had developed a mixture of industry, creative business (notably publishing), and services (including legal services). During the period of the German Democratic Republic, services became the concern of the state, concentrated in East Berlin; creative business moved to West Germany; and Leipzig was left only with heavy industry. To make matters worse, this industry was extremely polluting, making Leipzig an even less attractive city to live in. Between 1950 and the end of the German Democratic Republic, the population of Leipzig fell from 600,000 to 500,000.

In October 1989, after prayers for peace at St. Nicholas Church, established in 1983 as part of the peace movement, the Monday demonstrations started as the most prominent mass protest against the East German government. The reunification of Germany, however, was at first not good for Leipzig. The centrally planned heavy industry that had become the city&#x27;s specialty was, in terms of the advanced economy of reunited Germany, almost completely unviable, and closed. Within only six years, 90% of jobs in industry had vanished. As unemployment rocketed, the population fell dramatically; some 100,000 people left Leipzig in the ten years after reunification, and vacant and derelict housing became an urgent problem.

Starting in 2000, an ambitious urban-renewal plan first stopped Leipzig&#x27;s population decline and then reversed it. The plan focused on saving and improving the city&#x27;s attractive historic downtown area and particularly its early 20th century building stock, and attracting new industries, partly through infrastructure improvement. However, the renewal has led to gentrification of parts of the city and has not arrested the decline of Leipzig-East.

===21st century===
Leipzig is an important economic centre in Germany. Since the 2010s, the city has been celebrated by the media as a hip urban centre with a very high quality of living. It is often called &quot;The new Berlin&quot;. Leipzig is also Germany&#x27;s fastest growing city. Leipzig was the German candidate for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but was unsuccessful. After ten years of construction, the Leipzig City Tunnel opened on 14 December 2013. Leipzig forms the centrepiece of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland public transit system, which operates in the four German states of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Brandenburg.

==Politics==
===Mayor===

The first freely elected mayor after German reunification was Hinrich Lehmann-Grube of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), who served from 1990 to 1998. The mayor was originally chosen by the city council, but since 1994 has been directly elected. Wolfgang Tiefensee, also of the SDP, served from 1998 until his resignation in 2005 to become federal Minister of Transport. He was succeeded by fellow SPD politician Burkhard Jung, who was elected in January 2006 and re-elected in 2013 and 2020. The most recent mayoral election was held on 2 February 2020, with a runoff held on 1 March, and the results were as follows:

===State Landtag===
In the Landtag of Saxony, Leipzig is divided among eight constituencies. After the 2024 Saxony state election, the composition and representation of each was as follows:

=== Bundestag ===
In the Bundestag, Leipzig constitutes two constituencies. In the 20th Bundestag, the composition and representation of each was as follows:

==Demographics==

Leipzig has a population of about 620,000. In 1930, the population reached its historical peak of over 700,000. It decreased steadily from 1950 to about 530,000 in 1989. In the 1990s, the population decreased rather rapidly to 437,000 in 1998. This reduction was mostly due to outward migration and suburbanisation. After almost doubling the city area by incorporation of surrounding towns in 1999, the number stabilised and started to rise again, with an increase of 1,000 in 2000. , Leipzig is the fastest-growing city in Germany with over 500,000 inhabitants.
The growth of the past 10–15 years has mostly been due to inward migration. In recent years, inward migration accelerated, reaching an increase of 12,917 in 2014.

In the years following German reunification, many people of working age took the opportunity to move to the states of the former West Germany to seek employment opportunities. This was a contributory factor to falling birth rates. Births dropped from 7,000 in 1988 to less than 3,000 in 1994. However, the number of children born in Leipzig has risen since the late 1990s. In 2011, it reached 5,490 births resulting in a RNI of −17.7 (−393.7 in 1995).

The unemployment rate decreased from 18.2% in 2003 to 9.8% in 2014 and 7.6% in June 2017.

The percentage of the population from an immigrant background is low compared with other German cities. , only 5.6% of the population were foreigners, compared to the German national average of 7.7%.

The number of people with an immigrant background (immigrants and their children) grew from 49,323 in 2012 to 77,559 in 2016, making them 13.3% of the city&#x27;s population (Leipzig&#x27;s population 579,530 in 2016).

The largest minorities (first and second generation) in Leipzig by country of origin as of 31 December 2021 are:

==Culture, sights and cityscape==
In the 2010s, Leipzig was often referred to as &quot;Hypezig&quot;, as overblown comparisons were made to 1990s and early 2000s Berlin. The affordability, diversity and openness of the city have attracted many young people from across Europe, leading to a trendsetting alternative atmosphere, resulting in an innovative music, dance and art scene.

===Architecture===

The historic central area of Leipzig features a Renaissance-style ensemble of buildings from the sixteenth century, including the old city hall in the marketplace. There are also several baroque period trading houses and former residences of rich merchants. As Leipzig grew considerably during the economic boom of the late-nineteenth century, the town has many buildings in the historicist style representative of the era. Approximately 35% of Leipzig&#x27;s flats are in buildings of this type. The new city hall, completed in 1905, is built in the same style.

Some 90,000 apartments in Leipzig were built in buildings during Communist rule in East Germany. Although some of these have been demolished and fewer people live in this type of accommodation in recent years, a significant number still live in Plattenbau apartments. Grünau, for example, had about 43,600 people living in this sort of accommodation in 2016.

The St. Paul&#x27;s Church was destroyed by the Communist government in 1968 to make room for a new main building for the university. After some debate, the city decided to establish a new, mainly secular building at the same location, called Paulinum, which was completed in 2012. Its architecture alludes to the look of the former church and it includes space for religious use by the faculty of theology, including the original altar from the old church and two newly built organs.

Many commercial buildings were built in the 1990s as a result of tax breaks after German reunification.

===Tallest buildings and structures===

The tallest structure in Leipzig is the chimney of the Stahl- und Hartgusswerk Bösdorf GmbH with a height of . With , the tallest building in Leipzig is the City-Hochhaus Leipzig. From 1972 to 1973 it was Germany&#x27;s tallest building.

===Museums and the arts===
One of the highlights of the city&#x27;s contemporary arts was the Neo Rauch retrospective opening in April 2010 at the Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts. This is a show devoted to the father of the New Leipzig School of artists. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, this scene &quot;has been the toast of the contemporary art world&quot; for the past decade. In addition, there are eleven galleries in the so-called Spinnerei.

The Grassi Museum complex contains three more of Leipzig&#x27;s major collections: the Ethnography Museum, Applied Arts Museum and Musical Instrument Museum (the last of which is run by the University of Leipzig). The university also runs the Museum of Antiquities.

Founded in March 2015, the G2 Kunsthalle houses the Hildebrand Collection. This private collection focuses on the so-called New Leipzig School. Leipzig&#x27;s first private museum dedicated to contemporary art in Leipzig after the turn of the millennium is located in the city centre close to the famous St. Thomas Church on the third floor of the former GDR processing centre. Also dedicated to the contemporary art is the Galerie für Zeitgenössische Kunst Leipzig.

Other museums in Leipzig include the following:
*The German Museum of Books and Writing is the world&#x27;s oldest museum of its kind, founded in 1884.
*The Egyptian Museum of the University of Leipzig located in the Kroch High-rise comprises a collection of about 7,000 artefacts from several millennia.
*The Schillerhaus is the house where Schiller lived in summer 1785.

==Transport==

Founded at the crossing of Via Regia and Via Imperii, Leipzig has been a major interchange of inter-European traffic and commerce since medieval times. After the Reunification of Germany, immense efforts to restore and expand the traffic network have been undertaken and left the city area with an excellent infrastructure.

===Railways===

Opened in 1915, Leipzig Hauptbahnhof (lit. &quot;main station&quot;) is the largest overhead railway station in Europe in terms of its built-up area. At the same time, it is an important supra-regional junction in the Intercity-Express (ICE) and Intercity network of the as well as a connection point for S-Bahn and regional traffic in the Halle/Leipzig area.

In Leipzig the Intercity Express routes (Hamburg–)Berlin–Leipzig–Nuremberg–Munich and Dresden–Leipzig–Erfurt–Frankfurt am Main–(Wiesbaden/Saarbrücken) intersect. Leipzig is also the starting point for the intercity lines Leipzig-Halle (Saale)–Magdeburg–Hannover–Dortmund–Köln and –Bremen–Oldenburg(–Norddeich Mole). Both lines complement each other at hourly intervals and also stop at Leipzig/Halle Airport. The only international connection is the daily EuroCity Leipzig-Prague.

Most major and medium-sized towns in Saxony and southern Saxony-Anhalt can be reached without changing trains. There are also direct connections via regional express lines to Falkenberg/Elster-Cottbus, Hoyerswerda and Dessau-Magdeburg as well as Chemnitz. Neighbouring Halle (Saale) can be reached via three S-Bahn lines, two of which run via Leipzig/Halle Airport. The surrounding area of Leipzig is served by numerous regional and S-Bahn lines.

The city&#x27;s railway connections are currently being greatly improved by major construction projects, particularly within the framework of the German Unity transport projects. The line to Berlin has been extended and has been passable at since 2006. On 13 December 2015, the high-speed line from Leipzig to Erfurt, designed for , was put into operation. Its continuation to Nuremberg followed in December 2017. This integration into the high-speed network considerably reduced the journey times of the ICE from Leipzig to Nuremberg, Munich and Frankfurt am Main. The Leipzig-Dresden railway line, which was the first German long-distance railway to go into operation in 1839, is also undergoing expansion for 200 km/h. The most important construction project in regional transport was the four-kilometer-long city tunnel, which went into operation in December 2013 as the main line of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland.

There are freight stations in the districts of Wahren and Engelsdorf. In addition, a freight traffic centre has been set up near the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction for goods handling between road and rail, as well as a freight station on the site of the DHL hub at Leipzig/Halle Airport.

===Suburban trains===

Leipzig is the core of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland line network. Together with the tram, six of the ten lines form the backbone of local public transport and an important link to the region and the neighbouring Halle. The main line of the S-Bahn consists of the underground S-Bahn stations Hauptbahnhof, Markt, Wilhelm-Leuschner-Platz and Bayerischer Bahnhof leading through the City Tunnel as well as the above-ground station Leipzig MDR. There are a total of 30 S-Bahn stations in the Leipzig city area. Endpoints of the S-Bahn lines include Wurzen, Zwickau, Dessau, and Lutherstadt Wittenberg. Two lines run to Halle, one of them via Leipzig/Halle Airport.

With the timetable change in December 2004, the networks of Leipzig and Halle were combined to form the Leipzig-Halle S-Bahn. However, this network only served as a transitional solution and was replaced by the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland on 15 December 2013. At the same time, the main line tunnel, marketed as the Leipzig City Tunnel, went into operation. The tunnel, which is almost four kilometres long, crosses the entire city centre from the main railway station to the Bavarian railway station. The S-Bahn stations are up to 22 metres underground. This construction was the first to create a continuous north–south axis, which had not existed until now due to the north-facing terminus station. The connection to the south of the city and the federal state will thus be greatly improved.

===Tramway and buses===

The Leipziger Verkehrsbetriebe, existing since 1 January 1917, operate a total of 15 tram lines and 47 bus lines in the city.

The total length of the tram network is , making it the largest in Saxony ahead of Dresden () and the second largest in Germany after Berlin ().

The longest line in the Leipzig network is line 11, which connects Schkeuditz with Markkleeberg over 22 kilometres and is the only tram line in Leipzig to run in three tariff zones of the Central German Transport Association.

Night bus lines N1 to N9 and the night tram N17 operate in the night traffic. On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays the tram line N10 and the bus line N60 also operate. The central transfer point between the bus and tram lines as well as to the S-Bahn is Leipzig Central Station.

===Bicycle===

Like most German cities, Leipzig has a traffic layout designed to be bicycle-friendly. There is an extensive cycle network. In most of the one-way central streets, cyclists are explicitly allowed to cycle both ways. A few cycle paths have been built or declared since 1990. According to the data from the 2021/22 traffic count, the Saxons&#x27; Bridge has the highest traffic occupancy with over 15,000 cyclists per day in cycling in Leipzig.

Since 2004 there is a bicycle-sharing system. Bikes can be borrowed and returned via smartphone app or by telephone. Since 2018, the system has enabled flexible borrowing and returning of bicycles in the inner city; in this zone, bicycles can be handed in and borrowed from almost any street corner. Outside these zones, there are stations where the bikes are waiting. The current locations of the bikes can be seen via the app. There are cooperation offers with the Leipzig public transport companies and car sharing in order to offer as complete a mobility chain as possible.

===Road===

Several federal motorways pass by Leipzig: the A 14 in the north, the A 9 in the west, and the A 38 in the south. The three motorways form a triangular partial ring of the double ring Mitteldeutsche Schleife around Halle and Leipzig. To the south towards Chemnitz, the A 72 is also partly under construction.

The federal roads B 2, B 6, B 87, B 181, and B 184 lead through the city area.

The ring road (Innenstadtring), which corresponds to the course of the old city fortification, surrounds the city centre of Leipzig, which today is largely traffic-calmed.

Leipzig has a dense network of carsharing stations. Additionally, since 2018 there is also a stationless car sharing system in Leipzig. Here the cars can be parked and booked anywhere in the inner city without having to define a specific car or period in advance. Finding and booking is done via a smartphone app.

Leipzig is one of the few cities in Germany with vehicle for hire services that can be booked via a mobile app. In contrast to taxicab services, the start and destination must be defined beforehand and other passengers can be taken along at the same time if they share a route.

===Long-distance buses===

Since March 2018 there has been a central bus station directly east of Leipzig Central Station.

In addition to a large number of national lines, several international lines also serve Leipzig. The cities of Bregenz, Budapest, Milan, Prague, Sofia and Zurich, among others, can be reached without having to change trains. Around 30,000 journeys and 1.5 million passengers a year are expected at the new bus station.

Some lines also use Leipzig/Halle Airport, located at the A 9/A 14 motorway junction, and Leipziger Messe for a stop. Passengers can take the S-Bahn from there to the city centre.

===Air===
Leipzig/Halle Airport is the international commercial airport of the region. It is located at the Schkeuditzer Kreuz junction northwest of Leipzig, halfway between the two major cities. The easternmost section of the new Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle line under construction gave the airport a long-distance railway station, which was also integrated into the ICE network when the railway line was completed in 2015.

Passenger flights are operated to and from the major German hub airports, European metropolises and holiday destinations, especially to the Mediterranean region and North Africa. The airport is of international importance in the cargo sector. In Germany, it ranks second behind Frankfurt am Main, fifth in Europe and 26th worldwide (as of 2011). DHL uses the airport as its central European hub. It is also the home base of the freight airlines Aerologic and European Air Transport Leipzig.

The former military airport near Altenburg, Thuringia, called Leipzig-Altenburg Airport, about a half-hour drive from Leipzig, was served by Ryanair until 2010.

===Water===
In the first half of the 20th century, the construction of the Elster-Saale canal, White Elster, and Saale was started in Leipzig in order to connect to the network of waterways. The outbreak of the Second World War stopped most of the work, though some may have continued through the use of forced labor. The Lindenauer port was almost completed but not yet connected to the Elster-Saale and Karl Heine Canal respectively. The Leipzig rivers (White Elster, New Luppe, Pleiße, and Parthe) in the city have largely artificial river beds and are supplemented by some channels. These waterways are suitable only for small leisure boat traffic.

Through the renovation and reconstruction of existing mill races and watercourses in the south of the city and flooded disused open cast mines, the city&#x27;s navigable water network is being expanded. A link between Karl Heine Canal and the disused Lindenauer port was opened in 2015. Still more work was scheduled to complete the Elster-Saale canal. Such a move would allow small boats to reach the Elbe from Leipzig. The intended completion date has been postponed because of an unacceptable cost-benefit ratio.

<text>LimeWire was a free peer-to-peer file sharing client for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Solaris. Created by Mark Gorton in 2000, it was most prominently a tool used for the download and distribution of pirated materials, particularly pirated music. In 2007, LimeWire was estimated to be installed on over one-third of all computers globally.

Both a zero-cost version and a purchasable &quot;enhanced&quot; version called LimeWire Pro were available; however, LimeWire Pro could be acquired for free through the standard LimeWire software, where users distributed it without authorization. LimeWire uses the gnutella network as well as the BitTorrent protocol.

On October 26, 2010, U.S. federal court judge Kimba Wood issued an injunction ordering Lime Wire LLC to prevent &quot;the searching, downloading, uploading, file trading and/or file distribution functionality, and/or all functionality&quot; of its software in &quot;Arista Records LLC v. Lime Group LLC&quot;. A trial investigating the damages necessary to compensate the affected record labels was scheduled to begin in January 2011. As a result of the injunction, the RIAA initially suggested that LimeWire was responsible for $72 trillion in damages, before eventually settling for $105 million. Thereafter, the company stopped distributing the LimeWire software, and versions 5.5.11 and newer have been disabled using a backdoor installed by the company. However, version 5.5.10 and all prior versions of LimeWire remain fully functional and cannot be disabled unless a user upgrades to one of the newer versions.

== Features ==
Written in the Java programming language, LimeWire can run on any computer with a Java Virtual Machine installed. Installers were provided for Apple&#x27;s Mac OS X, Microsoft&#x27;s Windows, and Linux. Support for Mac OS 9 and other previous versions was dropped with the release of LimeWire 4.0.10. From version 4.8 onwards, LimeWire works as a UPnP Internet Gateway Device controller in that it can automatically set up packet-forwarding rules with UPnP-capable routers.

LimeWire offers sharing of its library through the Digital Audio Access Protocol (DAAP). As such, when LimeWire is running and configured to allow it, any files shared are detectable and downloaded on the local network by DAAP-enabled devices (e.g., Zune, iTunes). Beginning with LimeWire 4.13.9, connections can be encrypted with Transport Layer Security (TLS). Following LimeWire 4.13.11, TLS became the default connection option.

== Version history ==
Until October 2010, Lime Wire LLC, the New York City based developer of LimeWire, distributed two versions of the program: a basic free version, and an enhanced version, LimeWire PRO, which sold for a fee of $21.95 with 6 months of updates, or around $35.00 with 1 year of updates. The company claimed the paid version provides faster downloads and 66% better search results. This is accomplished by facilitating direct connection with up to 10 hosts of an identical searched file at any one time, whereas the gratis version is limited to a maximum of 8 hosts.

Being free software, LimeWire has spawned forks, including LionShare, an experimental software development project at Penn State University, and Acquisition, a Mac OS X-based gnutella client with a proprietary interface. Researchers at Cornell University developed a reputation management add-in called Credence that allows users to distinguish between &quot;genuine&quot; and &quot;suspect&quot; files before downloading them. An October 12, 2005, report states that some of LimeWire&#x27;s contributors have forked the project and called it FrostWire.

LimeWire was the second file sharing program after FrostWire to support firewall-to-firewall file transfers, a feature introduced in version 4.2, which was released in November 2004. LimeWire also now includes BitTorrent support, but is limited to three torrent uploads and three torrent downloads, which coexist with ordinary downloads. LimeWire 5.0 added an instant messenger that uses the XMPP Protocol, a free software communication protocol. Users can chat and share files with individuals or a group of friends in their buddy list.

From version 5.5.1, LimeWire has added a key activation, which requires the user to enter the unique key before activating the &quot;Pro&quot; version of the software. This has stopped people from using downloaded &quot;Pro&quot; versions without authorization. However, there are still ways to bypass this security feature, which was done when creating the &quot;Pirate Edition&quot;. For example, cracked versions of LimeWire were available on the Internet (including on LimeWire itself), and people could continue using the LimeWire Pro 5.5.1 Beta, which also includes AVG for LimeWire and is the first version to include AVG. The most recent stable version of LimeWire is 5.5.16.

Versions of LimeWire prior to 5.5.10 can still connect to the Gnutella network and users of these versions are still able to download files, even though a message is displayed concerning the injunction during the startup process of the software. LimeWire versions 5.5.11 and newer feature an auto-update feature that allowed Lime Wire LLC to disable newer versions of the LimeWire software. Older versions of LimeWire prior to version 5.5.11, however, do not include the auto-update feature and are still fully functional. As a result, neither the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) nor Lime Wire LLC have the ability to disable older versions of LimeWire, unless the user chooses to upgrade to a newer version of LimeWire.

On November 10, 2010, a secret group of developers called the &quot;Secret Dev Team&quot; sought to keep the application working by releasing the &quot;LimeWire Pirate Edition&quot;. The software is based on LimeWire 5.6 Beta, and is aimed to allow Windows versions to still work and remove the threat of spyware or adware. The exclusive features in LimeWire PRO were also unlocked, and all security features installed by Lime Wire LLC were removed.

== Forks and alternatives ==
A number of forks of LimeWire have been released, many with the goal of giving users more freedom, or in objection to design decisions made by the original developers.

=== FrostWire ===
FrostWire was started in September 2004 by members of the LimeWire community, after LimeWire&#x27;s distributor considered adding &quot;blocking&quot; code, in response to RIAA pressure and the threat of legal action, in light of the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.&quot;. When eventually activated, the code could block its users from sharing licensed files. This code was changed when lawsuits had been filed against LimeWire for P2P downloading. It had blocked all their users and redirected them to FrostWire. FrostWire has since completely moved to the BitTorrent protocol from Gnutella (LimeWire&#x27;s file sharing network).

=== LimeWire Pirate Edition/WireShare ===

In November 2010, as a response to the legal challenges regarding LimeWire, an anonymous individual by the handle of Meta Pirate released a modified version of LimeWire Pro, which was named LimeWire Pirate Edition. It came without the Ask.com toolbar, advertising, spyware, and backdoors, as well as all dependencies on Lime Wire LLC servers.

In response to allegations that a current or former member of Lime Wire LLC staff wrote and released the software, the company has stated they were &quot;not behind these efforts. LimeWire does not authorize them. LimeWire is complying with the Court&#x27;s October 26, 2010 injunction.&quot;

The LimeWire team, after being accused by the RIAA of being complicit in the development of LimeWire Pirate Edition, swiftly acted to shut down the LimeWire Pirate Edition website. A court order was issued to close down the website, and, to remain anonymous, Meta Pirate, the developer of LimeWire PE, did not contest the order.

Following the shutdown, the original LimeWire Pirate Edition project was reforked into WireShare, with the intent to keep the Gnutella network alive and to maintain a good faith continuation of the original project (without adware or spyware); development of the software continues to this day.

=== MuWire ===
MuWire was released in August 2020 as a free software program resembling LimeWire. Developed by a former LimeWire developer, it uses I2P to anonymize connections and transfers. MuWire&#x27;s developer had purchased the limewire.com domain after it had been allowed to expire, and redirected traffic to MuWire&#x27;s website for approximately two years, until finally selling it to an unaffiliated party.

== Criticism ==

Prior to April 2004, the free version of LimeWire was distributed with a bundled program called LimeShop (a variant of TopMoxie), which was spyware. Among other things, LimeShop monitored online purchases in order to redirect sales commissions to Lime Wire LLC. Uninstallation of LimeWire would not remove LimeShop. These objections were addressed in 2004 with the removal of all bundled software in LimeWire 3.9.4.

In LimeWire versions before 5.0, users could accidentally configure the software to allow access to any file on their computer, including documents with personal information. Later versions of LimeWire disabled unintentional sharing of documents or applications. In 2005, the US Federal Trade Commission issued a warning regarding the dangers of peer-to-peer file sharing network usage, due to the risk of identity theft and lawsuits. 

For example, a 2007 identity theft scheme involving LimeWire was discovered in what the U.S. Justice Department described as its first case against someone accused of using file sharing computer programs to commit identity theft. The perpetrator had used LimeWire to search other people&#x27;s computers for inadvertently shared financial information, which he used it to obtain credit cards for an online shopping spree.

One investigation showed that of 123 randomly selected downloaded files, 37 contained malware – about 30%. In mid-2008, a Macintosh trojan exploiting a vulnerability involving Apple Remote Desktop was distributed via LimeWire affecting users of Mac OS X Tiger and Leopard. The ability to distribute such malware and viruses was reduced in versions of LimeWire 5.0 and greater, whose default search settings excluded executable files.

After several years of opposing software bundling, LimeWire released an Ask.com-powered browser toolbar in 2010, which was automatically installed unless a user opted out. LimeWire automatically received a cryptographically signed file, called simpp.xml, containing an IP block list. It was the key technology behind the now defunct cyber security firm Tiversa which is alleged to have used information from the network to pressure prospective clients into engaging the company&#x27;s services.

== Downfall ==

According to a June 2005 report in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Lime Wire LLC was considering ceasing its distribution of LimeWire because the outcome of &quot;MGM v. Grokster&quot; &quot;handed a tool to judges that they can declare inducement whenever they want to&quot;. Nevertheless, the company continued operating and was sued by Arista Records, which obtained a favorable decision in 2010. Judge Kimba Wood of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled in &quot;Arista Records LLC v. Lime Group LLC&quot; that LimeWire and Gorton had committed copyright infringement, engaged in unfair competition, and induced others to commit copyright infringement. Later in the year, after losing another court battle, with the RIAA, LimeWire was ordered to disable many of its software&#x27;s capabilities due to the possibility of copyright infringement. The RIAA also announced its intention to seek damages for the program&#x27;s effects on various record labels. In response to the ruling, a company spokesperson said that the company planned to continue operating and would cease distributing and supporting P2P software. RIAA announced a further lawsuit in early 2011, claiming statutory damages of $72 trillion, more than triple the world&#x27;s annual GDP. The figure relied on an estimate of thousands of downloads for each of the platform&#x27;s 11,000 songs In May 2011, Gorton agreed to a settlement whereby the company would pay thirteen record labels approximately $105 million. Mitch Bainwol, chairman of the RIAA, referred to the &quot;resolution of the case [as] another milestone in the continuing evolution of online music to a legitimate marketplace that appropriately rewards creators.&quot;

=== Reuse of name ===

LimeWire&#x27;s name was revived in 2022 for an unrelated music-based NFT platform, an action with which Gorton expressed displeasure. The NFT marketplace was launched in July 2022, with the first NFT collection from American record producer and rapper 7 Aurelius. In September 2023, LimeWire bought BlueWillow, a generative artificial intelligence tool, and became a place to share images and videos created with it.

<doc id="17957" wikidata="Q2415171" url="?curid=17957" title="Latveria">
<text>Latveria is a fictional country appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. It is depicted within the storylines of Marvel&#x27;s comic titles as a small, isolated European country ruled by the fictional Supreme Lord Doctor Doom, supposedly located in the Banat region. It is surrounded by the Carpathian Mountains, and borders Symkaria (home of Silver Sable) to the south. Its capital is Doomstadt.

==Publication history==
Latveria first appeared in &quot;Fantastic Four Annual&quot; #2 (1964), ruled by Victor von Doom. In &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #536 (2006), he kills his own Prime Minister for claiming control of Latveria in his absence.

==Description==
Latveria is an isolated European country ruled by the fictional Supreme Lord Doctor Doom. It is located in the Banat region, where Hungary, Romania and Serbia meet. Its capital Hassenstadt has been named Doomstadt since Doom seized power, ruling the kingdom from Castle Doom. It is a largely rural nation that is dependent on Doom&#x27;s scientific pursuits, free of disease and crime, but severely oppressed. Doom has surveillance devices planted throughout the country and has hidden force fields to prevent its residents from leaving without his consent. Latveria relies largely on Doom&#x27;s robotic sentinels, the Doombots, to keep law and order.

=== History ===
When Doctor Doom is sent to Hell, the nation is targeted by its neighbors, leading the Fantastic Four to intervene. The United States attempts to fill the void left by Doom by supporting Lucia von Bardas as the new Prime Minister. During the &quot;Secret War,&quot; S.H.I.E.L.D. Commander Nick Fury leads an effort to oust Bardas, after discovering that she worked with Tinkerer to sell Doom&#x27;s technology to various supervillains. The nation is decimated during an attack by the Marquis of Death. The Avengers later invade Latveria to confront Doom for his unintentional involvement in the release of a symbiote virus. Doom is imprisoned for crimes against humanity, but restores his nation using time travel, with the help of Norman Osborn.

=== Inhabitants ===
Latveria has largely been ruled by Doom after killing the tyrannical King Vladimir. Doom has Romani heritage, and declares the kingdom&#x27;s Romani people a protected class. However, the nation&#x27;s oppression and primitive economy affects them mostly the same. The nation includes figures loyal to Doom, including scientists, political leaders such as Lucia von Bardas, and henchmen such as the Seven Daggers of Doom. In one story, the scientist Dreadknight turns against Doom. In the distant past, Doom is supported by his Zefiro guardian Boris, whose granddaughter Valeria becomes Doom&#x27;s teenage love. The kingdom is the setting for Doom&#x27;s family history, including his parents Cynthia and Werner, his adopted child Kristoff Vernard, and his alleged son Alexander Flynn.

<doc id="17961" wikidata="Q102761" url="?curid=17961" title="Least common multiple">
<text>In arithmetic and number theory, the least common multiple, lowest common multiple, or smallest common multiple of two integers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, usually denoted by , is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. Since division of integers by zero is undefined, this definition has meaning only if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are both different from zero. However, some authors define lcm(&quot;a&quot;, 0) as 0 for all &quot;a&quot;, since 0 is the only common multiple of &quot;a&quot; and 0.

The least common multiple of the denominators of two fractions is the &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; (lcd), and can be used for adding, subtracting or comparing the fractions.

The least common multiple of more than two integers &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, . . . , usually denoted by , is defined as the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, . . .

== Overview ==
A multiple of a number is the product of that number and an integer. For example, 10 is a multiple of 5 because 5 × 2 = 10, so 10 is divisible by 5 and 2. Because 10 is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both 5 and 2, it is the least common multiple of 5 and 2. By the same principle, 10 is the least common multiple of −5 and −2 as well.

=== Notation ===
The least common multiple of two integers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; is denoted as lcm(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;). Some older textbooks use [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;].

=== Example ===
:formula_1

Multiples of 4 are:

:formula_2

Multiples of 6 are:

:formula_3

&quot;Common multiples&quot; of 4 and 6 are the numbers that are in both lists:

:formula_4

In this list, the smallest number is 12. Hence, the &quot;least common multiple&quot; is 12.

== Applications ==
When adding, subtracting, or comparing simple fractions, the least common multiple of the denominators (often called the lowest common denominator) is used, because each of the fractions can be expressed as a fraction with this denominator. For example,

:formula_5

where the denominator 42 was used, because it is the least common multiple of 21 and 6.

=== Gears problem ===
Suppose there are two meshing gears in a machine, having &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; teeth, respectively, and the gears are marked by a line segment drawn from the center of the first gear to the center of the second gear. When the gears begin rotating, the number of rotations the first gear must complete to realign the line segment can be calculated by using formula_6. The first gear must complete formula_7 rotations for the realignment. By that time, the second gear will have made formula_8 rotations.

=== Planetary alignment ===

Suppose there are three planets revolving around a star which take &quot;l&quot;, &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; units of time, respectively, to complete their orbits. Assume that &quot;l&quot;, &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are integers. Assuming the planets started moving around the star after an initial linear alignment, all the planets attain a linear alignment again after formula_9 units of time. At this time, the first, second and third planet will have completed formula_10, formula_11 and formula_12 orbits, respectively, around the star.

== Calculation ==
There are several ways to compute least common multiples.

=== Using the greatest common divisor ===
The least common multiple can be computed from the greatest common divisor (gcd) with the formula
:formula_13

To avoid introducing integers that are larger than the result, it is convenient to use the equivalent formulas
:formula_14
where the result of the division is always an integer.

These formulas are also valid when exactly one of and is , since . However, if both and are , these formulas would cause division by zero; so, must be considered as a special case.

To return to the example above,

:formula_15

There are fast algorithms, such as the Euclidean algorithm for computing the gcd that do not require the numbers to be factored. For very large integers, there are even faster algorithms for the three involved operations (multiplication, gcd, and division); see Fast multiplication. As these algorithms are more efficient with factors of similar size, it is more efficient to divide the largest argument of the lcm by the gcd of the arguments, as in the example above.

=== Using prime factorization ===
The unique factorization theorem indicates that every positive integer greater than 1 can be written in only one way as a product of prime numbers. The prime numbers can be considered as the atomic elements which, when combined, make up a composite number.

For example:

:formula_16

Here, the composite number 90 is made up of one atom of the prime number 2, two atoms of the prime number 3, and one atom of the prime number 5.

This fact can be used to find the lcm of a set of numbers.

Example: lcm(8,9,21)

Factor each number and express it as a product of prime number powers.

: formula_17

The lcm will be the product of multiplying the highest power of each prime number together. The highest power of the three prime numbers 2, 3, and 7 is 23, 32, and 71, respectively. Thus,

:formula_18

This method is not as efficient as reducing to the greatest common divisor, since there is no known general efficient algorithm for integer factorization.

The same method can also be illustrated with a Venn diagram as follows, with the prime factorization of each of the two numbers demonstrated in each circle and &quot;all&quot; factors they share in common in the intersection. The lcm then can be found by multiplying all of the prime numbers in the diagram.

Here is an example:

: 48 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3,
: 180 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5,

sharing two &quot;2&quot;s and a &quot;3&quot; in common:

: Least common multiple = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 = 720
: Greatest common divisor = 2 × 2 × 3 = 12
: Product = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 = 8640

This also works for the greatest common divisor (gcd), except that instead of multiplying all of the numbers in the Venn diagram, one multiplies only the prime factors that are in the intersection. Thus the gcd of 48 and 180 is 2 × 2 × 3 = 12.

== Formulas ==

=== Fundamental theorem of arithmetic ===
According to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, every integer greater than 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the factors:

:formula_19

where the exponents &quot;n&quot;2, &quot;n&quot;3, ... are non-negative integers; for example, 84 = 22 31 50 71 110 130 ...

Given two positive integers formula_20 and formula_21, their least common multiple and greatest common divisor are given by the formulas
:formula_22

and
:formula_23

Since
:formula_24
this gives
:formula_25

In fact, every rational number can be written uniquely as the product of primes, if negative exponents are allowed. When this is done, the above formulas remain valid. For example:
:formula_26

=== Lattice-theoretic ===
The positive integers may be partially ordered by divisibility: if &quot;a&quot; divides &quot;b&quot; (that is, if &quot;b&quot; is an integer multiple of &quot;a&quot;) write &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; (or equivalently, &quot;b&quot; ≥ &quot;a&quot;). (Note that the usual magnitude-based definition of ≤ is not used here.)

Under this ordering, the positive integers become a lattice, with meet given by the gcd and join given by the lcm. The proof is straightforward, if a bit tedious; it amounts to checking that lcm and gcd satisfy the axioms for meet and join. Putting the lcm and gcd into this more general context establishes a duality between them:

:&quot;If a formula involving integer variables, gcd, lcm, ≤ and ≥ is true, then the formula obtained by switching gcd with lcm and switching ≥ with ≤ is also true.&quot; (Remember ≤ is defined as divides).

The following pairs of dual formulas are special cases of general lattice-theoretic identities.

It can also be shown that this lattice is distributive; that is, lcm distributes over gcd and gcd distributes over lcm:

:formula_27
:formula_28

This identity is self-dual:
:formula_29

=== Other ===
* Let &quot;D&quot; be the product of &quot;ω&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) distinct prime numbers (that is, &quot;D&quot; is squarefree).

Then

:formula_30

where the absolute bars || denote the cardinality of a set.

* If none of formula_31 is zero, then

:formula_32

== In commutative rings ==
The least common multiple can be defined generally over commutative rings as follows:

Let and be elements of a commutative ring . A &quot;common multiple&quot; of and is an element of such that both and divide (that is, there exist elements and of such that and ). A &quot;least common multiple&quot; of and is a common multiple that is minimal, in the sense that for any other common multiple of and , divides .

In general, two elements in a commutative ring can have no least common multiple or more than one. However, any two least common multiples of the same pair of elements are associates. In a unique factorization domain, any two elements have a least common multiple. In a principal ideal domain, the least common multiple of and can be characterised as a generator of the intersection of the ideals generated by and (the intersection of a collection of ideals is always an ideal).

<doc id="17962" wikidata="Q128626" url="?curid=17962" title="Louis St. Laurent">
<text>Louis Stephen St. Laurent (; February 1, 1882 – July 25, 1973) was a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as the 12th prime minister of Canada from 1948 to 1957.

Born and raised in southeastern Quebec, St. Laurent was a leading lawyer and a supporter of the Liberal Party of Canada. In 1941, he entered politics as minister of justice under Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, and in 1942 he won a by-election in the riding of Quebec East. In 1946, St. Laurent became secretary of state for external affairs and served in that post until two years later, when he became leader of the Liberal Party and prime minister, succeeding King who retired. St. Laurent carried the party to back-to-back landslide majority governments in the federal elections of 1949 and 1953.

The second French Canadian to hold the office, St. Laurent helped shape post-war Canada. His government introduced the policy of equalization payments, significantly increased immigration, established the Canada Council, and oversaw the construction of the Trans-Canada Highway, St. Lawrence Seaway, and the Trans-Canada Pipeline. His government also oversaw an expansion of Canada&#x27;s social programs, including the introduction of the registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) and an early form of Medicare known as &quot;Hospital Insurance&quot;. In foreign policy, St. Laurent&#x27;s government facilitated Canada&#x27;s entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and committed the third largest overall contribution of troops, ships, and aircraft to the Korean War. In 1956, under his direction, St. Laurent&#x27;s secretary of state for external affairs, Lester B. Pearson, helped resolve the Suez Crisis, which won Pearson the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize.

St. Laurent earned the nickname &quot;Uncle Louis&quot; as he was popular among the general public throughout his tenure, and the popularity of his government led many to predict that he would easily win the 1957 federal election. However, his decision to rush the 1956 debate on the Trans-Canada Pipeline by invoking closure led some to believe that the Liberals had become arrogant from their two decades in power, and in a major upset, the party was narrowly defeated by John Diefenbaker&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives, ending nearly 22 years of Liberal rule. Shortly after his defeat, St. Laurent retired from politics and returned to his law practice. He is ranked highly in rankings of Canadian prime ministers, although his government has been criticised for its role in the High Arctic relocation. According to historian Donald Creighton, St. Laurent was an &quot;eminently moderate, cautious...man...and a strong Canadian nationalist.&quot;

== Early life, family, and education (1882–1905) ==

Louis St. Laurent () was born on February 1, 1882, in Compton, Quebec, a village in the Eastern Townships, to Jean-Baptiste-Moïse Saint-Laurent, a French Canadian, and Mary Anne Broderick, an Irish Canadian. Louis was the oldest of seven children. At the time of his birth, Compton was mainly English-speaking, though it would slowly become majority French between 1901 and 1911. St. Laurent grew up fluently bilingual, as his father spoke French while his mother only spoke English. His English had a noticeable Irish brogue, while his gestures (such as a hunch of the shoulders) were French. St. Laurent was also interested in English literature as a child. The St. Laurent home would serve as a social centre for the village.

St. Laurent&#x27;s father, Jean-Baptiste, was a Compton shopkeeper and a staunch supporter of the Liberal Party of Canada and Sir Wilfrid Laurier. Jean-Baptiste would unsuccessfully run in a provincial by-election in 1894. When Laurier led the Liberals to victory in the 1896 election, 14-year-old Louis relayed the election returns from the telephone in his father&#x27;s store.

St. Laurent received degrees from Séminaire Saint-Charles-Borromée (B.A. 1902) and (LL.L. 1905). He was offered, but declined, a Rhodes Scholarship upon this graduation from Laval in 1905. In 1908, he married Jeanne Renault (1886–1966), with whom he had two sons and three daughters, including Jean-Paul St. Laurent.

== Legal career (1905–1942)==

St. Laurent worked as a lawyer from 1905 to 1942. He also became a professor of law at Université Laval in 1914. St. Laurent practised corporate, commercial and constitutional law in Quebec and became one of the country&#x27;s most respected counsel. St. Laurent served as president of the Canadian Bar Association from 1930 to 1932.

In 1907, St. Laurent gained some attention in Quebec after he made a move that was viewed unusual at the time: he put a priest and nuns on the witness stand and cross-examined them. This occurred during his engagement in a case contesting the will of a woman who had left everything she owned to her parish priest. In 1912, St. Laurent won a case against Canadian Pacific. In 1913, he was one of the defending counsel for Harry Kendall Thaw, who was seeking to avoid extradition from Quebec.
In 1923, St. Laurent opened his own law office. In 1926, in a test case before the Supreme Court, St. Laurent argued for religious minority (non-Christian) rights. He was in favour of Jewish demand for representation on Montreal’s Protestant Board of School Commissioners and he also supported a separate Jewish system of schools. Though St. Laurent&#x27;s bid to have Jewish representation in the school board was unsuccessful, the province of Quebec recognized the right to establish separate schools for non-Christians.

Though an ardent Liberal, Louis remained aloof from active politics for much of his life, focusing instead on his legal career and family. He became one of Quebec&#x27;s leading lawyers and was so highly regarded that he was twice offered a seat as a justice on the Supreme Court of Canada, offers he declined.

== Cabinet minister (1942–1948) ==

=== Minister of Justice ===
It was not until he was nearly 60 that St. Laurent finally agreed to enter politics when Liberal Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King appealed to his sense of duty in late 1941. King&#x27;s Quebec lieutenant, Ernest Lapointe, had died in November 1941. King believed that his Quebec lieutenant had to be strong enough and respected enough to help deal with the volatile conscription issue. King had been a junior politician when he witnessed the Conscription Crisis of 1917 during World War I and wanted to prevent the same divisions from threatening his government. Many recommended St. Laurent for the post. On these recommendations, King recruited St. Laurent to cabinet as Minister of Justice, Lapointe&#x27;s former post, on 9 December. St. Laurent agreed to go to Ottawa out of a sense of duty, but only on the understanding that his foray into politics was temporary and that he would return to Quebec at the conclusion of the war. In February 1942, he won a by-election for Quebec East, Lapointe&#x27;s former riding, which had been previously held by Laurier. St. Laurent supported King&#x27;s decision to introduce conscription in 1944 (see Conscription Crisis of 1944). His support prevented more than a handful of Quebec Liberal Members of Parliament (MPs) from leaving the party and was therefore crucial to keeping the government and the party united. St. Laurent was King&#x27;s right-hand man.

St. Laurent represented Canada at the 1945 San Francisco Conference that helped lead to the founding of the United Nations (UN).

In 1944, St. Laurent oversaw the creation of family allowances. In 1945, St. Laurent supported a program of economic reconstruction and more social welfare, which consisted of federal-provincial cost-sharing schemes for old-age pensions and hospital and medical insurance. Some officials were worried that these sweeping changes would cause disputes between the federal and provincial governments, but St. Laurent believed that Canadians identified with and supported these programs, stating that &quot;[they] were constantly made aware of the services which provincial governments render while they tended to think of the central government as one imposing burdens such as taxation and conscription.&quot;

In September 1945, Soviet cipher clerk Igor Gouzenko unexpectedly arrived at St. Laurent&#x27;s office with evidence of a Soviet spy ring operating in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Known as the Gouzenko Affair, the revelations and subsequent investigations over the following few years showed major Soviet espionage in North America.

=== Minister of external affairs ===

King came to regard St. Laurent as his most trusted minister and natural successor. He persuaded St. Laurent that it was his duty to remain in government following the war in order to help with the construction of a post-war international order and promoted him to the position of secretary of state for external affairs (foreign minister) in 1946, a portfolio King had always kept for himself.

In January 1947, St. Laurent delivered a speech at the University of Toronto, highlighting the need for an independent Canadian foreign policy that would not always rely on the United Kingdom. St. Laurent&#x27;s speech implied that Canadian foreign policy was only an extension of British foreign policy. He also said that Canada should have the “willingness to accept international responsibilities.”

==== United Nations ====

St. Laurent, compelled by his belief that the UN would be ineffective in times of war and armed conflict without some military means to impose its will, advocated the adoption of a UN military force. This force he proposed would be used in situations that called for both tact and might to preserve peace or prevent combat. In 1956, this idea was actualized by St. Laurent and his secretary of state for external affairs, Lester B. Pearson, in the development of UN peacekeepers that helped to put an end to the Suez Crisis.

St. Laurent also believed that the UN was failing to provide international security from communism from the Soviet Union. He therefore proposed an Atlantic security organization that would supplement the UN. That would become reality in 1949, when the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was founded. St. Laurent is seen as one of the first people in power to propose such an institution.

==== Annexation of Newfoundland ====

St. Laurent was a strong supporter of the Dominion of Newfoundland joining Canada. He ignored objections from the government of Quebec, which had land claims against Newfoundland and demanded a right of veto over the admission of any new province or territory. St. Laurent led two negotiations with Newfoundland and Joey Smallwood in the summer of 1947 and the fall of 1948. These negotiations were successful, and on March 31, 1949, Canada annexed Newfoundland and Labrador, with St. Laurent presiding over the ceremonies in Ottawa as prime minister.

=== 1948 Liberal Party leadership convention ===

In 1948, MacKenzie King retired after over 21 years in power, and quietly persuaded his senior ministers to support St. Laurent&#x27;s selection as the new Liberal leader at the Liberal leadership convention that took place on August 7, 1948, exactly 29 years after King became leader. St. Laurent easily won, defeating two other opponents.

== Prime Minister (1948–1957) ==
St. Laurent was sworn in as prime minister of Canada on 15 November 1948, making him Canada&#x27;s second French Canadian prime minister, after Wilfrid Laurier.

St. Laurent was the first prime minister to live in the official residence of the Prime Minister of Canada, 24 Sussex Drive (then known as 24 Sussex Street), from 1951 to 1957.

=== Federal election victories===

==== 1949 federal election ====
St. Laurent&#x27;s first mission was to give the Liberals a new mandate. In the 1949 federal election that followed his ascension to the Liberal leadership, many wondered, including Liberal Party insiders, if St. Laurent would appeal to the post-war populace of Canada. On the campaign trail, St. Laurent&#x27;s image was developed into somewhat of a &#x27;character&#x27; and what is considered to be the first &#x27;media image&#x27; to be used in Canadian politics. St. Laurent chatted with children, gave speeches in his shirt sleeves, and had a &#x27;common touch&#x27; that turned out to be appealing to voters. At one event during the 1949 election campaign, he disembarked his train and instead of approaching the assembled crowd of adults and reporters, gravitated to, and began chatting with, a group of children on the platform. A reporter submitted an article entitled &quot;Uncle Louis can&#x27;t lose!&quot; which earned him the nickname &quot;Uncle Louis&quot; in the media (&quot;Papa Louis&quot; in Quebec). With this common touch and broad appeal, he led the party to victory in the election against the Progressive Conservative Party (PC Party) led by George Drew. The Liberals won 191 seats – the most in Canadian history at the time, and still a record for the party. This is also the Liberals&#x27; second-most successful result in their history in terms of proportion of seats, behind the 1940 federal election.

==== 1953 federal election ====

St. Laurent led the Liberals to another powerful majority in the 1953 federal election, once again defeating PC leader Drew. Though they lost 22 seats, they still had three dozen seats more than the number needed for a majority, enabling them to dominate the House of Commons.

=== Foreign policy ===

St. Laurent and his cabinet oversaw Canada&#x27;s expanding international role in the postwar world. His stated desire was for Canada to occupy a social, military, and economic middle power role in the post-World War II world. In 1947, he identified the five basic principles of Canadian foreign policy and five practical applications regarding Canada&#x27;s international relations. Always highly sensitive to cleavages of language, religion, and region, he stressed national unity, insisting, &quot;that our external policies shall not destroy our unity ... for a disunited Canada will be a powerless one.&quot; He also stressed political liberty and rule of law in the sense of opposition to totalitarianism.

Militarily, St. Laurent was a leading proponent of the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949, serving as an architect and signatory of the treaty document. Involvement in such an organization marked a departure from King who had been reticent about joining a military alliance. Under his leadership, Canada supported the United Nations (UN) in the Korean War and committed the third largest overall contribution of troops, ships and aircraft to the U.N. forces to the conflict. Troops to Korea were selected on a voluntary basis. St. Laurent sent over 26,000 troops to fight in the war. In 1956, under his direction, St. Laurent&#x27;s secretary of state for external affairs, Lester B. Pearson, helped solve the Suez Crisis between Great Britain, France, Israel and Egypt, bringing forward St. Laurent&#x27;s 1946 views on a U.N. military force in the form of the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) or peacekeeping. These actions were recognized when Pearson won the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize.

In early 1954, St. Laurent took a 42-day long tour around the world, citing his desire to get a better picture of what he said, &quot;the problems which all of us have to face together.&quot; He visited 12 countries in total, including France, Germany, Japan, India, and Pakistan. When he returned to Canada, St. Laurent&#x27;s personality and character appeared to slightly change; cabinet ministers noticed he showed signs of fatigue and indifference. Some even claimed he started to feel depressed. Author Dale C. Thomson wrote, &quot;[the tour was] his greatest hour but it marked as well the beginning of his decline; as such, it was a turning point both for him and for Canadian politics.&quot;

=== Social and economic policies ===

It took taxation surpluses no longer needed by the wartime military and paying back in full Canada&#x27;s debts accrued during the World Wars and the Great Depression. With remaining revenues, St. Laurent oversaw the expansion of Canada&#x27;s social programs, including the gradual expansion of social welfare programs such as family allowances, old age pensions, government funding of university and post-secondary education and an early form of Medicare termed &quot;Hospital Insurance&quot; at the time. This scheme laid the groundwork for Tommy Douglas&#x27; healthcare system in Saskatchewan, and Pearson&#x27;s nationwide universal healthcare in the late 1960s. Under this legislation, the federal government paid around 50% of the cost of provincial health plans to cover &quot;a basic range of inpatient services in acute, convalescent, and chronic hospital care.&quot; The condition for the cost-sharing agreements was that all citizens were to be entitled to these benefits, and by March 1963, 98.8% of Canadians were covered by &quot;Hospital Insurance&quot;. According to historian Katherine Boothe, however, St. Laurent did not regard government health insurance to be a &quot;good policy idea&quot;, instead favouring the expansion of voluntary insurance through existing plans. In 1951, for instance, St. Laurent spoke in support of the medical profession assuming &quot;the administration and responsibility for, a scheme that would provide prepaid medical attendance to any Canadian who needed it&quot;.

In addition, St. Laurent modernized and established new social and industrial policies for the country during his time in the prime minister&#x27;s office. Amongst these measures included the universalization of old-age pensions for all Canadians aged seventy and above (1951), the introduction of old age assistance for needy Canadians aged sixty-five and above (1951), the introduction of allowances for the blind (1951) and the disabled (1954), amendments to the National Housing Act (1954) which provided federal government financing to non-profit organisations as well as the provinces for the renovation or construction of hostels or housing for students, the disabled, the elderly, and families on low incomes, and unemployment assistance (1956) for unemployed employables on welfare who had exhausted (or did not qualify for) unemployment insurance benefits. Aid to farmers adversely affected by crop failures was improved, while grants to universities were doubled. 

In 1954 a government scheme for insuring fishing vessels was established, while the following year a Fisheries Improvement Loan Act was introduced under which government guaranteed loans at 5% were provided to fishermen via the chartered banks. That same year a Women’s Bureau was set up to work on projects aimed at improving the position of female workers. In 1956, equal pay was introduced in the federal civil service. In 1955 a measure was introduced aimed at maintaining gold mine employment in communities depending on this industry. Improvements were also made in benefits for veterans and their dependents. Discrimination was also banned by the 1953 Fair Employment Practices Act and in 1957 unemployment insurance was extended to fishermen.
St. Laurent&#x27;s government also used $100 million in death taxes to establish the Canada Council to support research in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. In 1956, using the taxation authority of the federal level of government, St. Laurent&#x27;s government introduced the policy of &quot;equalization payments&quot; which redistributes taxation revenues between provinces to assist the poorer provinces in delivering government programs and services, a move that has been considered a strong one in solidifying the Canadian federation, particularly with his home province of Québec.

In 1957, St. Laurent&#x27;s government introduced the registered retirement savings plan (RRSP), a type of financial account used to hold savings and investment assets. The plan had many tax advantages and was designed to promote savings for retirement by employees and self-employed people.

=== Immigration ===

In 1948, St. Laurent&#x27;s government dramatically increased immigration in order to expand Canada&#x27;s labour base. St. Laurent believed that immigration was key to post-war economic growth. He also believed that immigration would create a sufficient tax base that would pay for social welfare measures that were established at the end of World War II. Over 125,000 immigrants arrived in Canada in 1948 alone, and that number would more than double to 282,000 in 1957. Large numbers of immigrants were from Southern Europe, including Italians, Greeks, and Portuguese immigrants. Their arrival shifted the balance of ethnic origins amongst Canadians, increasing the population who were of neither French nor British descent.

In 1956 and 1957, Canada received over 37,500 refugees from Hungary, in the wake of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution.

=== Infrastructure ===

St. Laurent&#x27;s government engaged in massive public works and infrastructure projects such as building the Trans-Canada Highway (1949), the St. Lawrence Seaway (1954) and the Trans-Canada Pipeline. It was this last project that was to sow the seeds that led to the downfall of the St. Laurent government.

St. Laurent had to go through a series of negotiations with the United States in order to start the construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway. In order to negotiate with the U.S., St. Laurent met with president Harry S. Truman twice, in 1949 and 1951, but was unsuccessful both times. St. Laurent then threatened that Canada would build the seaway alone. Finally, in 1953 and 1954, Truman&#x27;s successor, president Dwight Eisenhower, secured a deal with St. Laurent. The deal costed $470 million Canadian dollars, with Canada paying nearly three-fourths of that total and the U.S. paying about one-fourth. The seaway was completed in 1959 and expanded Canada&#x27;s economic trade routes with the United States.

=== Other domestic affairs ===

In 1949, the former lawyer of many Supreme Court cases, St. Laurent ended the practice of appealing Canadian legal cases to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council of Great Britain, making the Supreme Court of Canada the highest avenue of legal appeal available to Canadians. In that same year, St. Laurent negotiated the British North America (No. 2) Act, 1949 with Britain which &#x27;partially patriated&#x27; the Canadian Constitution, most significantly giving the Canadian Parliament the authority to amend portions of the constitution.

In 1949, following two referendums within the province, St. Laurent and Premier Joey Smallwood negotiated the entry of Newfoundland and Labrador into Confederation.

When asked in 1949 whether he would outlaw the Communist Party in Canada, St. Laurent responded that the party posed little threat and that such measures would be drastic.

In 1952, St. Laurent advised Queen Elizabeth II to appoint Vincent Massey as the first Canadian-born Governor-General. Each of the aforementioned actions were and are seen as significant in furthering the cause of Canadian autonomy from Britain and developing a national identity on the international stage.

In 1953, St. Laurent undertook the High Arctic relocation, where 92 Inuit were moved from Inukjuak, Quebec to two communities in the Northwest Territories (now Nunavut). The relocation was a forced migration instigated by the federal government to assert its sovereignty in the Far North by the use of &quot;human flagpoles&quot;, in light of both the Cold War and the disputed territorial claims to the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The relocated Inuit were not given sufficient support to prevent extreme privation during their first years after the move. The story was the subject of a book called &quot;The Long Exile&quot;, published by Melanie McGrath in 2006.

=== Defeat in the 1957 federal election ===
==== Pipeline Debate ====

The 1956 Pipeline Debate led to the widespread impression that the Liberals had grown arrogant in power. On numerous occasions, the government invoked closure in order to curtail debate and ensure that its Pipeline Bill passed by a specific deadline. St. Laurent was criticized for a lack of restraint exercised on his minister, C. D. Howe (who was also known as the &quot;Minister of Everything&quot;). Howe was widely perceived as extremely arrogant. Western Canadians felt particularly alienated by the government, believing that the Liberals were kowtowing to interests in Ontario and Quebec and the United States. The opposition accused the government of accepting overly costly contracts that could never be completed on schedule. In the end, the pipeline was completed early and under budget. The pipeline conflict turned out to be meaningless, insofar as the construction work was concerned, since pipe could not be obtained in 1956 from a striking American factory, and no work could have been done that year. The uproar in Parliament regarding the pipeline had a lasting impression on the electorate, and was a decisive factor in the Liberal government&#x27;s 1957 defeat at the hands of the Progressive Conservative (PC) Party, led by John Diefenbaker, in the 1957 election.

==== Results ====
By 1957 St. Laurent was 75 years old and tired. His party had been in power for 22 years, and by this time had accumulated too many factions and alienated too many groups. He was ready to retire, but was persuaded to fight one last campaign. In the 1957 election, the Liberals won 200,000 more votes nationwide than the Progressive Conservatives (40.75% Liberals to 38.81% PC). However, a large portion of that overall Liberal popular vote came from huge majorities in Quebec ridings, and did not translate into seats in other parts of the country. Largely due to dominating the rest of the country, the Progressive Conservatives took the greatest number of seats with 112 seats (42% of the House) to the Liberals&#x27; 105 (39.2%). The result of the election came as a shock to many, and is considered to be one of the greatest upsets in Canadian federal political history.

Some ministers wanted St. Laurent to stay on and offer to form a minority government, arguing that the popular vote had supported them and the party&#x27;s long years of experience would make them a more effective minority. Another option circulated within the party saw the balance of power to be held by either the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and their 25 seats or Social Credit Party of Canada with their 15 seats. St. Laurent was encouraged by others to reach out to the CCF and at least four of six independent/small party MPs to form a coalition majority government, which would have held 134 of the 265 seats in Parliament—50.6% of the total. St. Laurent, however, had no desire to stay in office; he believed that the nation had passed a verdict against his government and his party. In any case, the CCF and Socreds had pledged to cooperate with a Tory government. It was very likely that St. Laurent would have been defeated on the floor of the House had he tried to stay in power with a minority government, and would not have stayed in office for long even if he survived that confidence vote. With this in mind, St. Laurent resigned on 21 June 1957—ending the longest uninterrupted run in government for a party at the federal level in Canadian history.

== Supreme Court appointments ==

St. Laurent chose the following jurists to be appointed as justices of the Supreme Court of Canada by the Governor General:
* John Robert Cartwright (22 December 1949 – 23 March 1970)
* Joseph Honoré Gérald Fauteux (22 December 1949 – 23 December 1973)
* Douglas Charles Abbott (1 July 1954 – 23 December 1973)
* Patrick Kerwin (as Chief Justice, 1 July 1954 – 2 February 1963; appointed a Puisne Justice under Prime Minister Richard Bennett, 20 July 1935)
* Henry Grattan Nolan (1 March 1956 – 8 July 1957)

== Retirement and death (1957–1973) ==

After a short period as leader of the Opposition and now more than 75 years old, St. Laurent&#x27;s motivation to be involved in politics was gone. He announced his intention to retire from politics. He was succeeded as Liberal Party leader by his former secretary of state for external affairs and representative at the United Nations, Lester B. Pearson, at the party&#x27;s leadership convention in January 1958.

St. Laurent preferred law over politics. In a 1961 interview with the CBC, he stated, &quot;One can be more outspoken, frank and sincere before the courts than he could be before the public audience in a political campaign.&quot; In that same interview, St. Laurent acknowledged that the Pipeline Debate played a major role in his 1957 loss, stating, &quot;Perhaps I didn&#x27;t say as much as I should have; people do make mistakes you know. I did my best and, as a matter of fact, we had become accustomed to carry on as a board of directors and that displeased a part of the Canadian public.&quot; St. Laurent admitted that it took a while to resume his good mood after a sudden electoral loss.

After his political retirement, he returned to practising law and living quietly and privately with his family. During his retirement, he was called into the public spotlight one final time in 1967 to be made a Companion of the Order of Canada, a newly created award.

St. Laurent was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada on July 6, 1967. His citation reads:
Former Prime Minister of Canada. For his service to his country.

Louis Stephen St. Laurent died from heart failure on July 25, 1973, in Quebec City, Quebec, aged 91 and was buried at Saint Thomas d&#x27;Aquin Cemetery in his hometown of Compton, Quebec.

==Legacy and memorials==

St. Laurent presided over the beginning of a new period in Canadian history, post-WW2 Canada. Many have referred to this period as &quot;Canada&#x27;s Golden Age&quot;. St. Laurent&#x27;s government was modestly progressive, fiscally responsible, and run with business-like efficiency. St. Laurent&#x27;s former senior servant, Robert Gordon Robertson, wrote, &quot;St Laurent&#x27;s administrations from 1949 to 1956 probably gave Canada the most consistently good, financially responsible, trouble-free government the country has had in its entire history.&quot; One of St. Laurent&#x27;s cabinet ministers, Jack Pickersgill, noted of him, &quot;St. Laurent had made governing Canada look so easy that the people thought anyone could do it—and thus they elected John Diefenbaker.&quot;

Canadian author and professor, Robert Bothwell, wrote, &quot;St. Laurent had many of the best characteristics of a prime minister but few of the best attributes of a politician. In his most productive years in the job, 1948 to 1954, he presided over a cabinet of strong ministers, many of them first-class politicians. His views and theirs generally coincided, though when they did not, it was the prime minister who prevailed. His fundamental commitment was to national unity, which he interpreted broadly in terms of an expansive federal power. At home and abroad he was an activist, which an abundant economy allowed him to be.&quot;
St. Laurent was ranked #4 on a survey of the first 20 prime ministers (through Jean Chrétien) of Canada done by Canadian historians, and used by J. L. Granatstein and Norman Hillmer in their book &quot;Prime Ministers: Ranking Canada&#x27;s Leaders&quot;.

The house and grounds in Compton where St. Laurent was born were designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1973. St. Laurent&#x27;s residence at 201 Grande-Allée Est in Quebec City is protected as a Recognized Federal Heritage Building.

CCGS Louis S. St-Laurent, a Canadian Coast Guard Heavy Arctic Icebreaker, is named after him.

Louis St. Laurent School in Edmonton, Alberta. is named in his honour, as well as the Louis St-Laurent high school in East Angus, Quebec.

The riding, Louis-Saint-Laurent, is named in his honour. Created in 2003, it partially consists of St. Laurent&#x27;s old riding of Quebec East.

<text>A literary cycle is a group of stories focused on common figures, often (though not necessarily) based on mythical figures or loosely on historical ones. Cycles which deal with an entire country are sometimes referred to as matters. A fictional cycle is often referred to as a mythos.

== Examples from folk and classical literature ==
* The Anansi tales, which center on the Ashanti of Ghana trickster spider-spirit Anansi, and its variations in the Americas as Ti Malice and Bouki in Haiti, Br&#x27;er Rabbit or John and Old Master in the Southern United States.
* The tales of the One Thousand and One Nights, brought together by the frame story of the tale of Scheherazade and Shahryār.
* The Mahabharata, the world&#x27;s longest epic poem, many of whose stories deal with the lives of Indian mythological characters, most notably Krishna
* Nasreddin (1208-1285) is a character in the folklore of the Muslim world from the Balkans to China, and a hero of humorous short stories and satirical anecdotes.
* The four troubadours Bernart d&#x27;Auriac, Pere Salvatge, Roger Bernard III of Foix, and Peter III of Aragon composed a cycle of four &quot;sirventes&quot; in the summer of 1285 concerning the Aragonese Crusade.
* The Matter of Britain (or the &quot;Arthurian cycle&quot;), which centers on King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table
** The Vulgate cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail)

* The Matter of Rome (or the &quot;cycle of Rome&quot;), which centers on Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great
* The Shahnameh (or “The Book of Kings” ) and the legend of Arash the Archer as well as Avesta that make up most of the Persian Mythology, namely, tales of heroes like Rostam and Esfandyar
* The Mythological Cycle, which centers on the Celtic pantheon
* The Fenian Cycle, which centers on Fionn mac Cumhaill and the Fianna
* The Cycle of the Kings, which centers on the monarchy of Ireland
* The Reynard cycle, which centers on the fabular fox Reynard
* Der Ring des Nibelungen (or the &quot;Ring cycle&quot;), which centers on the Ring and the Norse pantheon
* The voyages of Sinbad the sailor, the hero of a cycle of tales of monsters, magical places, and supernatural phenomena met on his successive voyages.

* The Ulster Cycle, which centers on Cú Chulainn and the Kingdom of Ulster

<text>Louis Seymour Bazett Leakey (7 August 1903 – 1 October 1972) was a Kenyan-British palaeoanthropologist and archaeologist whose work was important in demonstrating that humans evolved in Africa, particularly through discoveries made at Olduvai Gorge with his wife, fellow palaeoanthropologist Mary Leakey. Having established a programme of palaeoanthropological inquiry in eastern Africa, he also motivated many future generations to continue this scholarly work. Several members of the Leakey family became prominent scholars themselves.

Another of Leakey&#x27;s legacies stems from his role in fostering field research of primates in their natural habitats, which he saw as key to understanding human evolution. He personally focused on three female researchers, Jane Goodall, Dian Fossey, and Birutė Galdikas, calling them &quot;The Trimates.&quot; Each went on to become an important scholar in the field of primatology. Leakey also encouraged and supported many other PhD candidates, most notably from the University of Cambridge. As well, Leakey played a role in creating organizations for future research in Africa and for protecting wildlife there.

==Background==

Louis&#x27;s parents, Harry (1868–1940) and Mary (May) Bazett Leakey (died 1948), were Church of England missionaries in British East Africa (now Kenya). Harry was the son of James Shirley Leakey (1824–1871), one of the eleven children of the portrait painter James Leakey. Harry Leakey was assigned to an established post of the Church Mission Society among the Kikuyu at Kabete, in the highlands north of Nairobi. The station was at that time a hut and two tents. Louis&#x27;s earliest home had an earthen floor, a leaky thatched roof, rodents and insects, and no heating system except for charcoal braziers. The facilities slowly improved over time. The mission, a center of activity, set up a clinic in one of the tents, and later a girls&#x27; school. Harry was working on a translation of the Bible into the Gikuyu language. He had a distinguished career in the CMS, becoming canon of the station.

Louis had a younger brother, Douglas, and two older sisters, Gladys and Julia. Both sisters married missionaries: Gladys married Leonard Beecher, Anglican Bishop of Mombasa and then Archbishop of East Africa from 1960 to 1970; Julia married Lawrence Barham, the second Bishop of Rwanda and Burundi from 1964 to 1966; their son Ken Barham was later the Bishop of Cyangugu in Rwanda.

The Leakey household came to contain Miss Oakes (a governess), Miss Higgenbotham (another missionary), and Mariamu (a Kikuyu nurse). Louis grew up, played, and learned to hunt with the native Kikuyus. He also learned to walk with the distinctive gait of the Kikuyu and speak their language fluently, as did his siblings. He was initiated into the Kikuyu ethnic group, an event of which he never spoke, as he was sworn to secrecy.

Louis requested and was given permission to build and move into a hut, Kikuyu style, at the end of the garden. It was home to his personal collection of natural objects, such as birds&#x27; eggs and skulls. All the children developed a keen interest in and appreciation of the pristine natural surroundings in which they found themselves. They raised baby animals, later turning them over to zoos. Louis read a gift book, &quot;Days Before History&quot;, by H. R. Hall (1907), a juvenile fictional work illustrating the prehistory of Britain. He began to collect tools and was further encouraged in this activity by a role model, Arthur Loveridge, the first curator (1914) of the Natural History Museum in Nairobi, the predecessor of the Coryndon Museum. This interest may have predisposed him toward a career in archaeology. His father was also a role model: Canon Leakey co-founded East Africa and Uganda Natural History Society.

Neither Harry nor May were of strong constitution. From 1904 to 1906 the entire family lived at May&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house in Reading, Berkshire, in England, while Harry recovered from neurasthenia, and again in 1911–1913, while May recovered from general frailty and exhaustion. During the latter stay, Harry bought a house in Boscombe, Hampshire.

==Formative years==
=== Attendance at Cambridge ===
In Britain, the Leakey children attended primary school; in Africa, they had a tutor. The family spent World War I in Africa. When the sea lanes opened again in 1919, they returned to Boscombe, and Louis was sent to Weymouth College, a private boys&#x27; school, when he was 16 years old. He did not do well and, in about three years, complained of hazing and rules that he considered an infringement on his freedom. Advised by one teacher to seek employment in a bank, he secured help from an English teacher in applying to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He received a scholarship for his high scores on the entrance exams.

Louis matriculated at the University of Cambridge, his father&#x27;s alma mater, in 1922, intending to become a missionary to British East Africa.

He frequently told a story about his final exams. When he had arrived in Britain, he had notified the registrar that he was fluent in Swahili. When he came to his finals, he asked to be examined in this language, and the authorities agreed. Then one day, he received two letters. One instructed him to report at a certain time and place for a &quot;viva voce&quot; examination in Swahili. The other asked if, at the same time and place, he would examine a candidate in Swahili.

===Archaeological and paleontological research===
In 1922, the British had been awarded German East Africa as part of the settlement of World War I. Within the Tanganyika Territory the Germans had discovered a site rich in dinosaur fossils, Tendaguru. Louis was told by C. W. Hobley, a friend of the family, that the British Museum of Natural History was going to send a fossil-hunting expedition led by William E. Cutler to the site. Louis applied and was hired to locate the site and manage the administrative details. In 1924 they departed for Africa. They never found a complete dinosaur skeleton, and Louis was recalled from the site by Cambridge in 1925.

Louis switched his focus to anthropology, and found a new mentor in Alfred Cort Haddon, head of the Cambridge department. In 1926, Louis graduated with a &quot;double first&quot;, or high honours, in anthropology and archaeology. He had used some of his preexisting qualifications; for example, Kikuyu was offered and accepted as the second modern language in which he was required to be proficient, even though no one there could test him on it. The university accepted an affidavit from a Kikuyu chief signed with a thumbprint.

From 1925 on Louis lectured and wrote on African archaeological and palaeontological topics. On graduation he was such a respected figure that Cambridge sent him to East Africa to study prehistoric African humans. He excavated dozens of sites, undertaking for the first time a systematic study of the artifacts. Some of his names for archaeological cultures are still in use; for example, the Elmenteitan.

===Research Fellow===

In 1927, Louis received a visit at a site called Gamble&#x27;s Cave, near Lake Elmenteita, by two women on a holiday, one of whom was Frida Avern (1902–1993). Avern had done some coursework in archaeology. Louis and Frida began a relationship, which continued upon his return to Cambridge. In 1928, they married and continued work near Lake Elmenteita. Finds from Gamble&#x27;s Cave were donated by Leakey to the British Museum in 1931. At that time he discovered the Acheulean site of Kariandusi, which he excavated in 1928.

On the strength of his work there, he obtained a post-graduate research fellowship at St. John&#x27;s College and returned to Cambridge in 1929 to classify and prepare the finds from Elmenteita. His patron and mentor at Cambridge were now Arthur Keith. While cleaning two skeletons he had found, he noticed a similarity to one found in Olduvai Gorge by Professor Hans Reck, a German national, whom Louis had met in 1925 in Germany while on business for Keith.

The geology of Olduvai was known. In 1913, Reck had extricated a skeleton from Bed II in the gorge wall. He argued that it must have the date of the bed, which was believed to be 600,000 years, in the mid-Pleistocene. Early dates for human evolution were not widely accepted by the general public at the time. Reck became involved in a media uproar. He was barred from going back to settle the question by the war and then the terms of the transfer of Tanganyika from Germany to Britain. In 1929, Louis visited Berlin to talk to the now skeptical Reck. Noting an Acheulean tool in Reck&#x27;s collection of artifacts from Olduvai, he bet Reck he could find ancient stone tools at Olduvai within 24 hours.

Louis received his PhD in 1930 at the age of 27. His first child, a daughter named Priscilla Muthoni Leakey, was born in 1931. His headaches and epilepsy returned, and he was prescribed Luminal, which he took for the rest of his life.

==Reversals of fortune==
=== Defence of Reck ===
In November 1931, Louis led an expedition to Olduvai whose members included Reck, whom Louis allowed to enter the gorge first. Leakey had bet Reck that Leakey would find Acheulean tools within the first 24 hours, which he did. These verified the provenance of the 1913 find, now called Olduvai Man. Non-humanoid fossils and tools were extracted from the ground in large numbers. Frida delayed joining her husband and was less enthusiastic about him on behalf of Priscilla. She did arrive eventually, however, and Louis put her to work. Frida&#x27;s site became FLK, for Frida Leakey&#x27;s Karongo (&quot;gully&quot;).

Back in Cambridge, the sceptics were not impressed. To find supporting evidence of the antiquity of Reck&#x27;s Olduvai Man, Louis returned to Africa, excavating at Kanam and Kanjera. He easily found more fossils, which he named Homo kanamensis. While he was gone, the opposition worked up some &quot;evidence&quot; of the intrusion of Olduvai Man into an earlier layer, evidence that seemed convincing at the time, but is missing and unverifiable now. On his return, Louis&#x27; finds were carefully examined by a committee of 26 scientists and were tentatively accepted as valid.

===Scandal===
Following their marriage in 1928, Louis and Frida lived in Foxton near Cambridge. In November 1932, Frida used an inheritance to purchase a large brick house in Girton, which the family named &quot;The Close&quot;.

The following year, Frida was pregnant, suffered from morning sickness most of the time, and was unable to work on the illustrations for Louis&#x27;s second book, &quot;Adam&#x27;s Ancestors.&quot; At a dinner party given in his honor, after a lecture of his at the Royal Anthropological Institute, Gertrude Caton-Thompson introduced her own illustrator, the twenty-year-old Mary Nicol. Louis convinced Mary to take on the illustration of his book, and a few months later companionship turned into an affair. Frida gave birth to Colin in December 1933, and the next month Louis left her and his newborn son. She would not sue for divorce until 1936.

A panel at Cambridge investigated his morals. Grants dried up, but his mother raised enough money for another expedition to Olduvai, Kanam, and Kanjera, the latter two on the Winam Gulf. His previous work there was questioned by P. G. H. Boswell, whom he invited to verify the sites for himself. Arriving at Kanam and Kanjera in 1935, they found that the iron markers Louis had used to mark the sites had been removed by the Luo tribe for use as harpoons and the sites could not now be located. To make matters worse, all the photos Louis took were ruined by a light leak in the camera. After an irritating and fruitless two-month search, Boswell left for England, promising, as Louis understood it, not to publish a word until Louis returned.

Boswell immediately set out to publish as many words as he was able, beginning with a letter in &quot;Nature&quot; dated 9 March 1935, destroying Reck&#x27;s and Louis&#x27;s dates of the fossils and questioning Louis&#x27;s competence. Despite the searches for the iron markers, Boswell averred that &quot;the earlier expedition (of 1931–32) neither marked the localities on the ground nor recorded the sites on a map.&quot; In a field report of March 1935, Louis accused Boswell of reneging on his word, but Boswell asserted he had made no such promise, and now having public opinion on his side, warned Louis to withdraw the claim. Louis was not only forced to retract the accusation in his final field report in June 1935 but also to recant his support of Reck. Louis was through at Cambridge. Even his mentors turned on him.

===On the road in Africa===
Meeting Mary in Africa, he proceeded to Olduvai with a small party. Louis&#x27; parents continued to urge him to return to Frida, and would pay for everyone in the party but Mary. Mary joined him under a stigma but her skill and competence eventually won over the other participants. Louis and his associates did the groundwork for future excavation at Olduvai, uncovering dozens of sites for a broad sampling, as was his method. They were named after the excavator: SHK (Sam Howard&#x27;s karongo), BK (Peter Bell&#x27;s), SWK (Sam White&#x27;s), MNK (Mary Nicol&#x27;s). Louis and Mary conducted a temporary clinic for the Maasai, made preliminary investigations of Laetoli, and ended by studying the rock paintings at the Kisese/Cheke region.

===Return to England===

Louis and Mary returned to England in 1935 without positions or any place to stay except Mary&#x27;s mother&#x27;s apartment. They soon leased Steen Cottage in Great Munden. This settlement was in Hertfordshire and had an unusual name which Louis, with his sense of humor noted in his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, Chapter 5, as &quot;the village of Nasty.&quot; They lived without heat, electricity, or plumbing, fetching water from a well and writing by oil lantern. They lived in poverty for 18 months at this low point of their fortunes, visited at first only by Mary&#x27;s relatives. Louis gardened for subsistence and exercise and improved the house and grounds. He appealed at last to the Royal Society, who relented with a small grant to continue work on his collection.

==In British East Africa==
=== Return to British East Africa ===
Louis had already involved himself in Kikuyu tribal affairs in 1928, taking a stand against female genital cutting. He got into a shouting match in Kikuyu one evening with Jomo Kenyatta, later the president of Kenya, who was lecturing on the topic. R. Copeland at Oxford recommended he apply to the Rhodes Trust for a grant to write a study of the Kikuyu and it was given late in 1936 along with a salary for two years. In January 1937 the Leakeys travelled to Kenya. Colin would not see his father for 20 years.

Louis returned to Kiambaa near Nairobi and persuaded Senior Chief Koinange, who designated a committee of chiefs, to help him describe the Kikuyu the way they had been. Mary excavated at Waterfall Cave. She fell ill with double pneumonia and was near death for two weeks in the hospital in Nairobi, during which time her mother was sent for. Contrary to expectation, she recovered and began another excavation at Hyrax Hill and then Njoro River Cave. Louis got an extension of his grant, which he used partially for fossil-hunting. Leakey discoveries began to appear in the newspapers again.

Tensions between the Kikuyu and the settlers increased alarmingly. Louis jumped into the fray as an exponent of the middle ground. In &quot;Kenya: Contrasts and Problems&quot;, he angered the settlers by proclaiming Kenya could never be a &quot;white man&#x27;s country.&quot;

===Fossil police===
The government offered Louis work as a policeman in intelligence, which he accepted. He traveled the country as a pedlar, reporting on the talk. In September 1939, when Britain went to war, the Kenyan government drafted Louis into its African intelligence service. Apart from some bumbling around, during which he and some settlers stalked each other as possible saboteurs of the Sagana Railway Bridge, his first task was to supply and arm Ethiopian guerrillas against the Italian invaders of their country. He created a clandestine network using his childhood friends among the Kikuyu. They also hunted fossils on the sly.

Louis conducted interrogations, analyzed handwriting, wrote radio broadcasts and took on regular police investigations. He loved a good mystery of any sort. The white leadership of the King&#x27;s African Rifles used him extensively to clear up many cultural mysteries; for example, he helped an officer remove a curse he had inadvertently put on his men.

Mary continued to find and excavate sites. In 1940, their son Jonathan Leakey was born. She worked in the Coryndon Memorial Museum (later called the National Museums of Kenya) where Louis joined her as an unpaid honorary curator in 1941. Their life was a melange of police work and archaeology. They investigated Rusinga Island and Olorgesailie. At the latter site they were assisted by a team of Italian experts recruited from the prisoners of war and paroled for the purpose.

In 1942, the Italian menace ended, but the Japanese began to reconnoiter with a view toward landing in force. Louis found himself in counter-intelligence work, which he performed with zest and imagination. In the same year, their daughter Deborah was born, but died at the age of three months. They lived in a rundown and bug-infested Nairobi home, provided by the museum. Jonathan was attacked by army ants in his crib.

===Turn of the tide===
In 1944 Richard Leakey was born. In 1945 the family&#x27;s income from police work all but vanished. By now Louis was getting plenty of job offers but he chose to stay on in Kenya as Curator of the Coryndon Museum, with an annual salary and a house, but more importantly, to continue palaeoanthropological research.

In January 1947 Louis conducted the first Pan-African Congress of Prehistory at Nairobi. Sixty scientists from 26 countries attended, delivering papers and visiting the Leakey sites. The conference restored Louis to the scientific fold and made him a major figure in it. With the money that now poured in Louis undertook the famous expeditions of 1948 and beyond at Rusinga Island in Lake Victoria, where Mary discovered the most complete Proconsul fossil up to that time.

Charles Watson Boise donated money for a boat to be used for transport on Lake Victoria, &quot;The Miocene Lady&quot;. Its skipper, Hassan Salimu, was later to deliver Jane Goodall to Gombe. Philip Leakey was born in 1949. In 1950, Louis was awarded an honorary doctorate by Oxford University.

===Kenyan affairs===

While the Leakeys were at Lake Victoria, the Kikuyu struck at the European settlers of the Kenyan highlands, who seemed to have the upper hand and were insisting on a &quot;white&quot; government of a &quot;white&quot; Africa. In 1949 the Kikuyu formed a secret society, the Mau Mau, which attacked settlers and especially loyalist Kikuyu.

Louis had attempted to warn Sir Philip Mitchell, governor of the colony, that nocturnal meetings and forced oaths were not Kikuyu customs and foreboded violence, but was ignored. Now he found himself pulled away from anthropology to investigate the Mau Mau. During this period his life was threatened and a reward placed on his head. The Leakeys began to pack pistols, termed &quot;European National Dress.&quot; The government placed him under 24-hour guard.

In 1952, after a Mau Mau massacre of pro-British chiefs, the government arrested Jomo Kenyatta, president of the Kenya African Union. Louis was summoned to be a court interpreter, but withdrew after an accusation of mistranslation because of prejudice against the defendant. He returned on request to translate documents only. Because of lack of evidence linking Kenyatta to the Mau Mau, although convicted, he did not receive the death penalty, but was sentenced to several years of hard labour.

The government brought in British troops and formed a home guard of 20,000 Kikuyu. During this time, Louis played a difficult and contradictory role. He sided with the settlers, serving as their spokesman and intelligence officer, helping to ferret out bands of guerrillas. On the other hand, he continued to advocate for the Kikuyu in his 1954 book &quot;Defeating Mau Mau&quot; and numerous talks and articles. He recommended a multi-racial government, land reform in the highlands, a wage hike for the Kikuyu, and many other reforms, most of which were eventually adopted.

The government then realized the rebellion was being directed from urban centers, instituted martial law and detained the committees. Following Louis&#x27; suggestion, thousands of Kikuyu were placed in re-education camps and resettled in new villages. The rebellion continued from bases under Mount Kenya until 1956, when, deprived of its leadership and supplies, it had to disperse. The state of emergency lasted until 1960. In 1963 Kenya became independent, with Jomo Kenyatta as prime minister.

==Work in palaeoanthropology==
===Olduvai Gorge===

Beginning in 1951, Louis and Mary began intensive research at Olduvai Gorge. A trial trench in Bed II at BK in 1951 was followed by a more extensive excavation in 1952. They found what Louis termed an Oldowan &quot;slaughter-house&quot;, an ancient bog where animals had been trapped and butchered. Excavations stopped in 1953 but were briefly resumed in 1955 with Jean Brown.

In 1959, excavations at Bed I were opened. While Louis was sick in camp, Mary discovered the fossilized skull OH 5 at FLK, &quot;Paranthropus boisei&quot;, famously identified as &quot;Zinjanthropus&quot; or &quot;Zinj.&quot; The question was whether the fossil belonged to a previous genus discovered by Robert Broom, &quot;Paranthropus&quot;, or a member of a different genus ancestral to humans. Louis opted for &quot;Zinjanthropus&quot;, a decision opposed by Wilfrid Le Gros Clark, but one which attracted the attention of Melville Bell Grosvenor, president of the National Geographic Society. That contact resulted in an article in &quot;National Geographic&quot; and a large grant to continue work at Olduvai.

In 1960, geophysicists Jack Evernden and Garniss Curtis dated Bed I from 1.89 to 1.75 million years ago, confirming the great antiquity of fossil hominids in Africa.

In 1960, Louis appointed Mary director of excavation at Olduvai. She brought in a staff of Kamba assistants, including Kamoya Kimeu, who later discovered many of eastern Africa&#x27;s most famous fossils. At Olduvai, Mary set up Camp 5 and began work with her own staff and associates.

At &quot;Jonny&#x27;s site&quot;, FLK-NN, Jonathan Leakey discovered two skull fragments without the Australopithecine sagittal crest, which Mary connected with Broom&#x27;s and Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Telanthropus&quot;. The problem with it was its contemporaneity with &quot;Zinjanthropus&quot;. When mailed photographs, Le Gros Clark retorted casually &quot;Shades of Piltdown.&quot; Louis cabled him immediately and had some strong words at this suggestion of his incompetence. Clark apologized.

Not long afterwards, in 1960, Louis, his son Philip and Ray Pickering discovered a fossil he termed &quot;Chellean Man&quot;, (Olduvai Hominid 9), in context with Oldowan tools. After reconstruction Louis and Mary called it &quot;Pinhead.&quot; It was subsequently identified as &quot;Homo erectus&quot;, contemporaneous with &quot;Paranthropus&quot; at 1.4 million years old.

In 1961 Louis got a salary as well as a grant from the National Geographic Society and turned over the acting directorship of Coryndon to a subordinate. He created the Centre for Prehistory and Paleontology on the same grounds, moved his collections to it, and appointed himself director. This was his new operations center. He opened another excavation at Fort Ternan on Lake Victoria. Shortly after, Heselon discovered &quot;Kenyapithecus wickeri&quot;, named after the owner of the property. Louis promptly celebrated with George Gaylord Simpson, who happened to be present, aboard the &quot;Miocene Lady&quot; with &quot;Leakey Safari Specials&quot;, a drink made of condensed milk and cognac.

In 1962 Louis was visiting Olduvai when Ndibo Mbuika discovered the first tooth of &quot;Homo habilis&quot; at MNK. Louis and Mary thought it was female and named her Cinderella, or Cindy. Phillip Tobias identified Jonny&#x27;s Child with it and Raymond Dart came up with the name &quot;Homo habilis&quot; at Louis&#x27; request, which Tobias translated as &quot;handyman.&quot; It was seen as intermediary between gracile &quot;Australopithecus&quot; and &quot;Homo&quot;.

===Calico Hills===
In 1959 Leakey, while at the British Museum of Natural History in London, received a visit from Ruth DeEtte Simpson, an archaeologist from California. Simpson had acquired what looked like ancient scrapers from a site in the Calico Hills and showed it to Leakey.

In 1963, Leakey obtained funds from the National Geographic Society and commenced archaeological excavations with Simpson. Excavations at the site carried out by Leakey and Simpson revealed that they had located stone artifacts which were dated 100,000 years or older, suggesting a human presence in North America much earlier than others had estimated.

The geologist Vance Haynes had made three visits to the site in 1973 and had claimed that the artifacts found by Leakey were naturally formed geofacts. According to Haynes, the geofacts were formed by stones becoming fractured in an ancient river on the site.

In her autobiography, Mary Leakey wrote that because of Louis&#x27;s involvement with the Calico Hills site she had lost academic respect for him and that the Calico excavation project was &quot;catastrophic to his professional career and was largely responsible for the parting of our ways&quot;.

==The Trimates==

One of Louis&#x27;s legacies stems from his role in fostering field research of primates in their natural habitats, which he understood as key to unraveling the mysteries of human evolution. He personally chose three female researchers, Jane Goodall, Dian Fossey, and Birutė Galdikas, calling them The Trimates. Each went on to become an important scholar in the field of primatology, immersing themselves in the study of chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans, respectively. Leakey also encouraged and supported many other PhD candidates, most notably from Cambridge University. Louis believed that women were better at studying primates than men, as shown in the book &quot;Primates.&quot;

== Last years ==

During his final years Louis became famous as a lecturer in the United Kingdom and United States. He did not excavate any longer, as he was impaired by arthritis, for which he had a hip replacement in 1968. He raised funds and directed his family and associates. In Kenya he was a facilitator for hundreds of scientists exploring the East African Rift system for fossils.

In 1968, Louis refused an honorary doctorate from the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, primarily because of apartheid in South Africa. Mary accepted one, and they thereafter led separate professional lives.

In the last few years Louis&#x27; health began to fail more seriously. He had his first heart attacks and spent six months in the hospital. An empathy over health brought him and Dian Fossey together for a brief romance, which she broke off. Richard began to assume more and more of his father&#x27;s responsibilities, which Louis resisted, but in the end was forced to accept.

==Death and legacy==
On 1 October 1972, Louis had a heart attack in the London apartment of Vanne Goodall (Jane Goodall&#x27;s mother). Vanne sat up all night with him in St. Stephen&#x27;s Hospital and left at 9:00 a.m. He died 30 minutes later at the age of 69.

Mary wanted to cremate Louis and fly the ashes back to Nairobi. Richard intervened. Louis&#x27; body was flown home and interred at Limuru, near the graves of his parents.

In denial, the family did not face the question of a memorial marker for a year. When Richard went to place a stone on the grave he found one already there, courtesy of Louis&#x27; former secretary Rosalie Osborn. The inscription was signed with the letters, &quot;ILYUA&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll love you always&quot;, which Rosalie used to place on her letters to him. Richard left it in place.

===Prominent organizations===
* In 1947, Leakey was central to the organisation of the first PanAfrican Archaeological Association congress, held in Nairobi. From 1955 to 1959 he was its president.
*In 1958, Leakey founded the Tigoni Primate Research Center with Cynthia Booth, on her farm north of Nairobi. Later it was the National Primate Research Center, currently the Institute of Primate Research, now in Nairobi. As the Tigoni center, it funded Leakey&#x27;s Angels.
* In 1961, Leakey created the Centre for Prehistory and Paleontology on the same grounds as Coryndon Museum, appointing himself director.
* In 1968, Leakey assisted with the founding of The Leakey Foundation to ensure the legacy of his life&#x27;s work in the study of human origins.

===Prominent family members===
Louis Leakey was married to Mary Leakey, who made the noteworthy discovery of fossil footprints at Laetoli. Found preserved in volcanic ash in Tanzania, they are the earliest record of bipedal gait.

He is also the father of paleoanthropologist Richard Leakey and the botanist Colin Leakey. Louis&#x27;s cousin, Nigel Gray Leakey, was a recipient of the Victoria Cross during World War II.

==Books==
Leakey&#x27;s books are listed below. The gaps between books are filled by too many articles to list. It was Louis who began the Leakey tradition of publishing in &quot;Nature&quot;.

<text>In philosophy and logic, the classical liar paradox or liar&#x27;s paradox or antinomy of the liar is the statement of a liar that they are lying: for instance, declaring that &quot;I am lying&quot;. If the liar is indeed lying, then the liar is telling the truth, which means the liar just lied. In &quot;this sentence is a lie&quot;, the paradox is strengthened in order to make it amenable to more rigorous logical analysis. It is still generally called the &quot;liar paradox&quot; although abstraction is made precisely from the liar making the statement. Trying to assign to this statement, the strengthened liar, a classical binary truth value leads to a contradiction.

If &quot;this sentence is false&quot; is true, then it is false, but the sentence states that it is false, and if it is false, then it must be true, and so on.

== History ==
The Epimenides paradox (c. 600 BC) has been suggested as an example of the liar paradox, but they are not logically equivalent. The semi-mythical seer Epimenides, a Cretan, reportedly stated that &quot;All Cretans are liars.&quot; However, Epimenides&#x27; statement that all Cretans are liars can be resolved as false, given that he knows of at least one other Cretan who does not lie (alternatively, it can be taken as merely a statement that all Cretans tell lies, not that they tell &quot;only&quot; lies).

The paradox&#x27;s name translates as &quot;pseudómenos lógos&quot; (ψευδόμενος λόγος) in Ancient Greek. One version of the liar paradox is attributed to the Greek philosopher Eubulides of Miletus, who lived in the 4th century BC. Eubulides reportedly asked, &quot;A man says that he is lying. Is what he says true or false?&quot;

The paradox was once discussed by Jerome of Stridon in a sermon:

The Indian grammarian-philosopher Bhartrhari (late fifth century AD) was well aware of a liar paradox which he formulated as &quot;everything I am saying is false&quot; (sarvam mithyā bravīmi). He analyzes this statement together with the paradox of &quot;unsignifiability&quot; and explores the boundary between statements that are unproblematic in daily life and paradoxes.

There was discussion of the liar paradox in early Islamic tradition for at least five centuries, starting from late 9th century, and apparently without being influenced by any other tradition. Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī could have been the first logician to identify the liar paradox as self-referential.

==Explanation and variants==
The problem of the liar paradox is that it seems to show that common beliefs about truth and falsity actually lead to a contradiction. Sentences can be constructed that cannot consistently be assigned a truth value even though they are completely in accord with grammar and semantic rules.

The simplest version of the paradox is the sentence:

If (A) is true, then &quot;This statement is false&quot; is true. Therefore, (A) must be false. The hypothesis that (A) is true leads to the conclusion that (A) is false, a contradiction.

If (A) is false, then &quot;This statement is false&quot; is false. Therefore, (A) must be true. The hypothesis that (A) is false leads to the conclusion that (A) is true, another contradiction. Either way, (A) is both true and false, which is a paradox.

However, that the liar sentence can be shown to be true if it is false and false if it is true has led some to conclude that it is &quot;neither true nor false&quot;. This response to the paradox is, in effect, the rejection of the claim that every statement has to be either true or false, also known as the principle of bivalence, a concept related to the law of the excluded middle.

The proposal that the statement is neither true nor false has given rise to the following, strengthened version of the paradox:

If (B) is neither true nor false, then it must be not true. Since this is what (B) itself states, it means that (B) must be true. Since initially (B) was not true and is now true, another paradox arises.

Another reaction to the paradox of (A) is to posit, as Graham Priest has, that the statement is both true and false. Nevertheless, even Priest&#x27;s analysis is susceptible to the following version of the liar:

If (C) is both true and false, then (C) is only false. But then, it is not true. Since initially (C) was true and is now not true, it is a paradox. However, it has been argued that by adopting a two-valued relational semantics (as opposed to functional semantics), the dialetheic approach can overcome this version of the Liar.

There are also multi-sentence versions of the liar paradox. The following is the two-sentence version:


Assume (D1) is true. Then (D2) is true. This would mean that (D1) is false. Therefore, (D1) is both true and false.

Assume (D1) is false. Then (D2) is false. This would mean that (D1) is true. Thus (D1) is both true and false. Either way, (D1) is both true and false – the same paradox as (A) above.

The multi-sentence version of the liar paradox generalizes to any circular sequence of such statements (wherein the last statement asserts the truth/falsity of the first statement), provided there are an odd number of statements asserting the falsity of their successor; the following is a three-sentence version, with each statement asserting the falsity of its successor:

Assume (E1) is true. Then (E2) is false, which means (E3) is true, and hence (E1) is false, leading to a contradiction.

Assume (E1) is false. Then (E2) is true, which means (E3) is false, and hence (E1) is true. Either way, (E1) is both true and false – the same paradox as with (A) and (D1).

There are many other variants, and many complements, possible. In normal sentence construction, the simplest version of the complement is the sentence:

If F is assumed to bear a truth value, then it presents the problem of determining the object of that value. But, a simpler version is possible, by assuming that the single word &#x27;true&#x27; bears a truth value. The analogue to the paradox is to assume that the single word &#x27;false&#x27; likewise bears a truth value, namely that it is false. This reveals that the paradox can be reduced to the mental act of assuming that the very idea of fallacy bears a truth value, namely that the very idea of fallacy is false: an act of misrepresentation. So, the symmetrical version of the paradox would be:


There&#x27;s also a version related to the problem of future contingents which cannot be answered without a contradiction arising:

If the answer is &#x27;yes&#x27;, then the answer to the question is &#x27;no&#x27;, and if the answer is &#x27;no&#x27;, then the answer to the question is &#x27;yes&#x27;.

==Possible resolutions==

===Fuzzy logic===
In fuzzy logic, the truth value of a statement can be any real number between 0 and 1 both inclusive, as opposed to Boolean logic, where the truth values may only be the integer values 0 or 1. In this system, the statement &quot;This statement is false&quot; is no longer paradoxical as it can be assigned a truth value of 0.5, making it precisely half true and half false. A simplified explanation is shown below.

Let the truth value of the statement &quot;This statement is false&quot; be denoted by formula_1. The statement becomes

: formula_2

by generalizing the NOT operator to the equivalent Zadeh operator from fuzzy logic, the statement becomes

: formula_3

from which it follows that

: formula_4

===Alfred Tarski===
Alfred Tarski diagnosed the paradox as arising only in languages that are &quot;semantically closed&quot;, by which he meant a language in which it is possible for one sentence to predicate truth (or falsehood) of another sentence in the same language (or even of itself). To avoid self-contradiction, it is necessary when discussing truth values to envision levels of languages, each of which can predicate truth (or falsehood) only of languages at a lower level. So, when one sentence refers to the truth-value of another, it is semantically higher. The sentence referred to is part of the &quot;object language&quot;, while the referring sentence is considered to be a part of a &quot;meta-language&quot; with respect to the object language. It is legitimate for sentences in &quot;languages&quot; higher on the semantic hierarchy to refer to sentences lower in the &quot;language&quot; hierarchy, but not the other way around. This prevents a system from becoming self-referential.

However, this system is incomplete. One would like to be able to make statements such as &quot;For every statement in level &quot;α&quot; of the hierarchy, there is a statement at level &quot;α&quot;+1 which asserts that the first statement is false.&quot; This is a true, meaningful statement about the hierarchy that Tarski defines, but it refers to statements at every level of the hierarchy, so it must be above every level of the hierarchy, and is therefore not possible within the hierarchy (although bounded versions of the sentence are possible). Saul Kripke is credited with identifying this incompleteness in Tarski&#x27;s hierarchy in his highly cited paper &quot;Outline of a theory of truth,&quot; and it is recognized as a general problem in hierarchical languages.

===Arthur Prior===
Arthur Prior asserts that there is nothing paradoxical about the liar paradox. His claim (which he attributes to Charles Sanders Peirce and John Buridan) is that every statement includes an implicit assertion of its own truth.
Thus, for example, the statement &quot;It is true that two plus two equals four&quot; contains no more information than the statement &quot;two plus two equals four&quot;, because the phrase &quot;it is true that...&quot; is always implicitly there. And in the self-referential spirit of the Liar Paradox, the phrase &quot;it is true that...&quot; is equivalent to &quot;this whole statement is true and ...&quot;.

Thus the following two statements are equivalent:


The latter is a simple contradiction of the form &quot;A and not A&quot;, and hence is false. Therefore, there is no paradox, because the claim that this two-conjunct Liar is false does not lead to a contradiction. Eugene Mills presents a similar answer. 

===Saul Kripke===
Saul Kripke argued that whether a sentence is paradoxical or not can depend upon contingent facts. If the only thing Smith says about Jones is

and Jones says only these three things about Smith:

If Smith really is a big spender but is &quot;not&quot; soft on crime, then both Smith&#x27;s remark about Jones and Jones&#x27;s last remark about Smith are paradoxical.

Kripke proposes a solution in the following manner. If a statement&#x27;s truth value is ultimately tied up in some evaluable fact about the world, that statement is &quot;grounded&quot;. If not, that statement is &quot;ungrounded&quot;. Ungrounded statements do not have a truth value. Liar statements and liar-like statements are ungrounded, and therefore have no truth value.

===Jon Barwise and John Etchemendy===
Jon Barwise and John Etchemendy propose that the liar sentence (which they interpret as synonymous with the Strengthened Liar) is ambiguous. They base this conclusion on a distinction they make between a &quot;denial&quot; and a &quot;negation&quot;. If the liar means, &quot;It is not the case that this statement is true&quot;, then it is denying itself. If it means, &quot;This statement is not true&quot;, then it is negating itself. They go on to argue, based on situation semantics, that the &quot;denial liar&quot; can be true without contradiction while the &quot;negation liar&quot; can be false without contradiction. Their 1987 book makes heavy use of non-well-founded set theory.

===Dialetheism===
Graham Priest and other logicians, including J. C. Beall and Bradley Armour-Garb, have proposed that the liar sentence should be considered to be both true and false, a point of view known as dialetheism. Dialetheism is the view that there are true contradictions. Dialetheism raises its own problems. Chief among these is that since dialetheism recognizes the liar paradox, an intrinsic contradiction, as being true, it must discard the long-recognized principle of explosion, which asserts that any proposition can be deduced from a contradiction, unless the dialetheist is willing to accept trivialism – the view that &quot;all&quot; propositions are true. Since trivialism is an intuitively false view, dialetheists nearly always reject the explosion principle. Logics that reject it are called &quot;paraconsistent&quot;.

===Non-cognitivism===
Andrew Irvine has argued in favour of a non-cognitivist solution to the paradox, suggesting that some apparently well-formed sentences will turn out to be neither true nor false and that &quot;formal criteria alone will inevitably prove insufficient&quot; for resolving the paradox.

===Bhartrhari&#x27;s perspectivism===
The Indian grammarian-philosopher Bhartrhari (late fifth century AD) dealt with paradoxes such as the liar in a section of one of the chapters of his magnum opus the Vākyapadīya. Bhartrhari&#x27;s solution fits into his general approach to language, thought and reality, which has been characterized by some as &quot;relativistic&quot;, &quot;non-committal&quot; or &quot;perspectivistic&quot;. With regard to the liar paradox (&quot;sarvam mithyā bravīmi&quot; &quot;everything I am saying is false&quot;) Bhartrhari identifies a hidden parameter that can change unproblematic situations in daily communication into a stubborn paradox. Bhartrhari&#x27;s solution can be understood in terms of the solution proposed in 1992 by Julian Roberts: &quot;Paradoxes consume themselves. But we can keep apart the warring sides of the contradiction by the simple expedient of temporal contextualisation: what is &#x27;true&#x27; with respect to one point in time need not be so in another ... The overall force of the &#x27;Austinian&#x27; argument is not merely that &#x27;things change&#x27;, but that rationality is essentially temporal in that we need time in order to reconcile and manage what would otherwise be mutually destructive states.&quot; According to Robert&#x27;s suggestion, it is the factor &quot;time&quot; which allows us to reconcile the separated &quot;parts of the world&quot; that play a crucial role in the solution of Barwise and Etchemendy. The capacity of time to prevent a direct confrontation of the two &quot;parts of the world&quot; is here external to the &quot;liar&quot;. In the light of Bhartrhari&#x27;s analysis, however, the extension in time that separates two perspectives on the world or two &quot;parts of the world&quot; – the part before and the part after the function accomplishes its task – is inherent in any &quot;function&quot;: also the function to signify which underlies each statement, including the &quot;liar&quot;. The unsolvable paradox – a situation in which we have either contradiction (&quot;virodha&quot;) or infinite regress (&quot;anavasthā&quot;) – arises, in case of the liar and other paradoxes such as the unsignifiability paradox (Bhartrhari&#x27;s paradox), when abstraction is made from this function (&quot;vyāpāra&quot;) and its extension in time, by accepting a simultaneous, opposite function (&quot;apara vyāpāra&quot;) undoing the previous one.

==Logical structure==
For a better understanding of the liar paradox, it is useful to write it down in a more formal way. If &quot;this statement is false&quot; is denoted by A and its truth value is being sought, it is necessary to find a condition that restricts the choice of possible truth values of A. Because A is self-referential, it is possible to give the condition by an equation.

If some statement, B, is assumed to be false, one writes, &quot;B = false&quot;. The statement (C) that the statement B is false would be written as &quot;C = &#x27;B = false. Now, the liar paradox can be expressed as the statement A, that A is false:

This is an equation from which the truth value of A = &quot;this statement is false&quot; could hopefully be obtained. In the Boolean domain, &quot;A = false&quot; is equivalent to &quot;not A&quot; and therefore the equation is not solvable. This is the motivation for reinterpretation of A. The simplest logical approach to make the equation solvable is the dialetheistic approach, in which case the solution is A being both &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;. Other resolutions mostly include some modifications of the equation; Arthur Prior claims that the equation should be &quot;A = &#x27;A = false and A = true and therefore A is false. In computational verb logic, the liar paradox is extended to statements like, &quot;I hear what he says; he says what I don&#x27;t hear&quot;, where verb logic must be used to resolve the paradox.

==Applications==

===Gödel&#x27;s first incompleteness theorem===

Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems are two fundamental theorems of mathematical logic which state inherent limitations of sufficiently powerful axiomatic systems for mathematics. The theorems were proven by Kurt Gödel in 1931, and are important in the philosophy of mathematics. Roughly speaking, in proving the first incompleteness theorem, Gödel used a modified version of the liar paradox, replacing &quot;this sentence is false&quot; with &quot;this sentence is not provable&quot;, called the &quot;Gödel sentence G&quot;. His proof showed that for any sufficiently powerful theory T, G is true, but not provable in T. The analysis of the truth and provability of G is a formalized version of the analysis of the truth of the liar sentence.

To prove the first incompleteness theorem, Gödel represented statements by numbers. Then the theory at hand, which is assumed to prove certain facts about numbers, also proves facts about its own statements. Questions about the provability of statements are represented as questions about the properties of numbers, which would be decidable by the theory if it were complete. In these terms, the Gödel sentence states that no natural number exists with a certain, strange property. A number with this property would encode a proof of the inconsistency of the theory. If there were such a number then the theory would be inconsistent, contrary to the consistency hypothesis. So, under the assumption that the theory is consistent, there is no such number.

It is not possible to replace &quot;not provable&quot; with &quot;false&quot; in a Gödel sentence because the predicate &quot;Q is the Gödel number of a false formula&quot; cannot be represented as a formula of arithmetic. This result, known as Tarski&#x27;s undefinability theorem, was discovered independently by Gödel (when he was working on the proof of the incompleteness theorem) and by Alfred Tarski.

George Boolos has since sketched an alternative proof of the first incompleteness theorem that uses Berry&#x27;s paradox rather than the liar paradox to construct a true but unprovable formula.

==In popular culture==
The liar paradox is occasionally used in fiction to shut down artificial intelligences, who are presented as being unable to process the sentence. In the &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; episode &quot;I, Mudd&quot;, the liar paradox is used by Captain Kirk and Harry Mudd to confuse and ultimately disable an android holding them captive. In the 1973 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Green Death&quot;, the Doctor temporarily stumps the insane computer BOSS by asking it &quot;If I were to tell you that the next thing I say would be true, but that the last thing I said was a lie, would you believe me?&quot; BOSS tries to figure it out but cannot and eventually decides the question is irrelevant and summons security.

In the 1967 film &quot;Bedazzled&quot;, the Devil says to his subject, Stanley Moon, that &quot;Everything he says is a lie, including this.&quot;.

In the 2011 video game &quot;Portal 2&quot;, artificial intelligence GLaDOS attempts to use the &quot;this sentence is false&quot; paradox to kill another artificial intelligence, Wheatley. However, lacking the intelligence to realize the statement is a paradox, he simply responds, &quot;Um, true. I&#x27;ll go with true. There, that was easy.&quot; and is unaffected. Humorously, all other AIs present barring GLaDOS, all of which are significantly less sentient and lucid than both her and Wheatley, are still killed from hearing the paradox. However, GLaDOS later notes that she almost killed herself from her own attempt to kill Wheatley.

The Devo song &quot;Enough Said&quot; includes the lyrics &quot;The next thing I say to you will be true/The last thing I said was false&quot;.

In the seventh episode of &quot;&quot;, titled &quot;Access Denied&quot;, the main character Jesse and their friends are captured by a supercomputer named PAMA. After PAMA controls two of Jesse&#x27;s friends, Jesse learns that PAMA stalls when processing and uses a paradox to confuse him and escape with their last friend. One of the paradoxes the player can make Jesse say is the liar paradox.

Robert Earl Keen&#x27;s song &quot;The Road Goes On and On&quot; mentions the paradox. The song is part of Keen&#x27;s feud with Toby Keith, who is presumably the &quot;liar&quot; Keen refers to.

<text>&#x27; or &#x27; () is Parisian and Lyonnaise butchers&#x27; (French ) slang, similar to Pig Latin and Verlan. It originated in the mid-19th century and was in common use until the 1950s.

==Process==
The word-creation process resembles that of , , and , in that existing words are camouflaged according to a set of rules. Strictly speaking, is a more rigid variety of in which the ending is obligatory. substitutes for the consonant or consonant cluster at the beginning of the word, or, if the word begins with an or a vowel, the second syllable; the initial consonant is then reattached to the end of the word along with a suffix particular to the argot: , , , , , or in the case of louchébem, .

Note that is first and foremost an oral language, and spelling is usually phoneticized.

==History==

Despite the name, seems to have been created not by butchers, but by inmates at Brest Prison, with records dating back to 1821.

Edmund Clerihew Bentley used the language as a plot point in his 1937 short story &quot;The Old-Fashioned Apache&quot;.

During the Nazi occupation was used by Parisian members of the Resistance.

Even today, is still well-known and used among those working at point-of-sale in the meat retail industry. Some words have even leaked into common, everyday use by the masses; an example is the word , meaning &quot;eccentric&quot;.

== Examples ==
Here are a few example Louchébem words.

There is another French argot called , which differs from only in the suffix that is added ( instead of ); the term is derived from &quot;jargon&quot;.

<doc id="17970" wikidata="Q192695" url="?curid=17970" title="Leon M. Lederman">
<text>Leon Max Lederman (July 15, 1922 – October 3, 2018) was an American experimental physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1988, along with Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger, for research on neutrinos. He also received the Wolf Prize in Physics in 1982, along with Martin Lewis Perl, for research on quarks and leptons. Lederman was director emeritus of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in Batavia, Illinois. He founded the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, in Aurora, Illinois in 1986, where he was resident scholar emeritus from 2012 until his death in 2018.

An accomplished scientific writer, he became known for his 1993 book &quot;The God Particle&quot; establishing the popularity of the term for the Higgs boson.

==Early life and education==
Lederman was born in New York City, New York, to Morris and Minna (Rosenberg) Lederman. His parents were Ukrainian-Jewish immigrants from Kyiv and Odesa. Lederman graduated from James Monroe High School in the South Bronx, and received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the City College of New York in 1943.

Lederman enlisted in the United States Army during World War II, intending to become a physicist after his service. Following his discharge in 1946, he enrolled at Columbia University&#x27;s graduate school, receiving his Ph.D. in 1951.

==Academic career==
Lederman became a faculty member at Columbia University, and he was promoted to full professor in 1958 as Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics. In 1960, on leave from Columbia, he spent time at CERN in Geneva as a Ford Foundation Fellow. He took an extended leave of absence from Columbia in 1979 to become director of Fermilab. Resigning from Columbia (and retiring from Fermilab) in 1989, he then taught briefly at the University of Chicago. He then moved to the physics department of the Illinois Institute of Technology, where he served as the Pritzker Professor of Science. In 1992, Lederman served as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Lederman, rare for a Nobel Prize winning professor, took it upon himself to teach physics to non-physics majors at The University of Chicago.

Lederman served as president of the board of sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and at the time of his death was chair emeritus. He also served on the board of trustees for Science Service, now known as Society for Science &amp; the Public, from 1989 to 1992, and was a member of the JASON defense advisory group. Lederman was also one of the main proponents of the &quot;Physics First&quot; movement. Also known as &quot;Right-side Up Science&quot; and &quot;Biology Last,&quot; this movement seeks to rearrange the current high school science curriculum so that physics precedes chemistry and biology.

Lederman was an early supporter of Science Debate 2008, an initiative to get the then-candidates for president, Barack Obama and John McCain, to debate the nation&#x27;s top science policy challenges. In October 2010, Lederman participated in the USA Science and Engineering Festival&#x27;s Lunch with a Laureate program where middle and high school students engaged in an informal conversation with a Nobel Prize-winning scientist over a brown-bag lunch. Lederman was also a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival&#x27;s advisory board.

==Academic work==
In 1956, Lederman worked on parity violation in weak interactions. R. L. Garwin, Leon Lederman, and R. Weinrich modified an existing cyclotron experiment, and they immediately verified the parity violation. They delayed publication of their results until after Wu&#x27;s group was ready, and the two papers appeared back-to-back in the same physics journal. Among his achievements are the discovery of the muon neutrino in 1962 and the bottom quark in 1977. These helped establish his reputation as among the top particle physicists.

In 1976, a group of physicists, the E288 experiment team, led by Lederman announced that a particle with a mass of about 6.0 GeV was being produced by the Fermilab particle accelerator. After taking further data, the group discovered that this particle did not actually exist, and the &quot;discovery&quot; was named &quot;Oops-Leon&quot; as a pun on the original name, upsilon, and Lederman&#x27;s first name. The name was reused for the upsilon meson, which the group discovered from subsequent data in 1977 at a higher mass of 9.5 GeV.

As the director of Fermilab, Lederman was a prominent supporter of the Superconducting Super Collider project, which was endorsed around 1983, and was a major proponent and advocate throughout its lifetime. Also at Fermilab, he oversaw the construction of the Tevatron, for decades the world&#x27;s highest-energy particle collider. Lederman later wrote his 1993 popular science book &quot;The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question?&quot; – which sought to promote awareness of the significance of such a project – in the context of the project&#x27;s last years and the changing political climate of the 1990s. The increasingly moribund project was finally shelved that same year after some $2 billion of expenditures. In &quot;The God Particle&quot; he wrote, &quot;The history of atomism is one of reductionism – the effort to reduce all the operations of nature to a small number of laws governing a small number of primordial objects&quot; while stressing the importance of the Higgs boson.

In 1988, Lederman received the Nobel Prize for Physics along with Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger &quot;for the neutrino beam method and the demonstration of the doublet structure of the leptons through the discovery of the muon neutrino&quot;. Lederman also received the National Medal of Science (1965), the Elliott Cresson Medal for Physics (1976), the Wolf Prize for Physics (1982) and the Enrico Fermi Award (1992). In 1995, he received the Chicago History Museum &quot;Making History Award&quot; for Distinction in Science Medicine and Technology.

==Personal life==
Lederman&#x27;s best friend during his college years, Martin J. Klein, convinced him of &quot;the splendors of physics during a long evening over many beers&quot;. He was known for his sense of humor in the physics community. On August 26, 2008, Lederman was video-recorded by a science focused organization called ScienCentral, on the street in New York City, answering questions from passersby. He answered questions such as &quot;What is the strong force?&quot; and &quot;What happened before the Big Bang?&quot;.

He had three children with his first wife, Florence Gordon, and toward the end of his life lived with his second wife, Ellen (Carr), in Driggs, Idaho.

Lederman was an atheist. Lederman began to suffer from memory loss in 2011 and, after struggling with medical bills, he had to sell his Nobel Prize medal for $765,000 to cover the costs in 2015. He died of complications from dementia on October 3, 2018, at a care facility in Rexburg, Idaho, at the age of 96.

<doc id="17972" wikidata="Q43974" url="?curid=17972" title="Louis the Pious">
<text>Louis the Pious (; ; ; 16 April 778 – 20 June 840), also called the Fair and the Debonaire, was King of the Franks and co-emperor with his father, Charlemagne, from 813. He was also King of Aquitaine from 781. As the only surviving son of Charlemagne and Hildegard, he became the sole ruler of the Franks after his father&#x27;s death in 814, a position that he held until his death except from November 833 to March 834, when he was deposed.

During his reign in Aquitaine, Louis was charged with the defence of the empire&#x27;s southwestern frontier. He conquered Barcelona from the Emirate of Córdoba in 801 and asserted Frankish authority over Pamplona and the Basques south of the Pyrenees in 812. As emperor, he included his adult sons, Lothair, Pepin and Louis, in the government and sought to establish a suitable division of the realm among them. The first decade of his reign was characterised by several tragedies and embarrassments, notably the brutal treatment of his nephew Bernard of Italy for which Louis atoned in a public act of self-debasement.

In the 830s his empire was torn by civil war between his sons that was only exacerbated by Louis&#x27;s attempts to include his son Charles by his second wife in the succession plans. Though his reign ended on a high note, with order largely restored to his empire, it was followed by three years of civil war. Louis is generally compared unfavourably to his father but faced distinctly different problems.

==Birth and rule in Aquitaine==
Louis was born in 778, while his father Charlemagne was on campaign through the Pyrenees, at the Carolingian villa of Cassinogilum, according to Einhard and the anonymous chronicler called Astronomus; the place is usually identified with Chasseneuil, near Poitiers. He was the third son of Charlemagne by his wife Hildegard. He had a twin brother named Lothair, who died young. Louis and Lothair were given names from the old Merovingian dynasty, possibly to suggest a connection.

Louis was crowned King of Aquitaine as a three-year-old child in 781. In the following year he was sent to Aquitaine accompanied by regents and a court. Charlemagne constituted this sub-kingdom in order to secure the border of his realm after the destructive war against the Aquitanians and Basques under Waifar (capitulated 768) and later Hunald II, which culminated in the disastrous Battle of Roncesvalles (778). Charlemagne wanted Louis to grow up in the area where he was to reign. However, wary of the customs his son may have been assimilating into in Aquitaine, Charlemagne, who had remarried to Fastrada after the death of Hildegard, sent for Louis in 785. Louis presented himself in Saxony at the royal Council of Paderborn dressed in Basque costumes along with other youths in the same garment, which may have made a good impression in Toulouse, since the Basques of Vasconia were a mainstay of the Aquitanian army.

In 794, Charlemagne gave four former Gallo-Roman villas to Louis, in the thought that he would take in each in turn as winter residence: Doué, Ebreuil, Angeac and the Chasseneuil. Charlemagne&#x27;s intention was to see all his sons brought up as natives of their given territories, wearing the national costume of the region and ruling by the local customs. Thus were the children sent to their respective realms at a young age. The marches—peripheral principalities—played a vital role as bulwarks against exterior threats to the empire. Louis reigned over the Spanish March. In 797, Barcelona, the largest city of the &quot;Marca&quot;, fell to the Franks when Zeid, its governor, rebelled against Córdoba and, failing, handed it to them. The Córdoban authority recaptured it in 799. However, Louis marched the entire army of his kingdom, including Gascons with their duke Sancho I of Gascony, Provençals under Leibulf, and Goths under Bera, over the Pyrenees and besieged it for seven months, wintering there from 800 to 801, when it capitulated. King Louis was formally invested with his armour in 791 at the age of fourteen. However, the princes were not given independence from central authority as Charlemagne wished to implant in them the concepts of empire and unity by sending them on remote military expeditions. Louis joined his brother Pippin at the Mezzogiorno campaign in Italy against the Duke Grimoald of Benevento at least once.
Louis was one of Charlemagne&#x27;s three legitimate sons to survive infancy. His twin brother, Lothair, died during infancy. According to the Frankish custom of partible inheritance, Louis had expected to share his inheritance with his brothers, Charles the Younger, King of Neustria, and Pepin, King of Italy. In the &quot;Divisio Regnorum&quot; of 806, Charlemagne had slated Charles the Younger as his successor as ruler of the Frankish heartland of Neustria and Austrasia, while giving Pepin the Iron Crown of Lombardy, which Charlemagne possessed by conquest. To Louis&#x27;s kingdom of Aquitaine, he added Septimania, Provence, and part of Burgundy. However, Charlemagne&#x27;s other legitimate sons died—Pepin in 810 and Charles in 811—and Louis was crowned co-emperor with an already ailing Charlemagne in Aachen on 11 September 813. On his father&#x27;s death in 814, he inherited the entire Carolingian Empire and all its possessions (with the sole exception of the kingdom of Italy; although within Louis&#x27;s empire, in 813 Charlemagne had ordered that Bernard, Pepin&#x27;s son, be made and called king).

==Reign==
While at his palace of Doué, Anjou, Louis received news of his father&#x27;s death. He rushed to Aachen and crowned himself emperor to shouts of &quot;Vivat Imperator Ludovicus&quot; by the attending nobles.

Upon arriving at the imperial court in Aachen in an atmosphere of suspicion and anxiety on both sides, Louis&#x27;s first act was to purge the palace of what he considered undesirable. He destroyed the old Germanic pagan tokens and texts which had been collected by Charlemagne. He further exiled members of the court he deemed morally &quot;dissolute&quot;, including some of his own relatives.

He quickly sent all of his many unmarried (half-)sisters and nieces to nunneries in order to avoid any possible entanglements from overly powerful brothers-in-law. Sparing his illegitimate half-brothers Drogo, Hugh and Theoderic, he forced his father&#x27;s cousins, Adalard and Wala to be tonsured, sending them into monastic exile at St-Philibert on the island of Noirmoutier and Corbie, respectively, despite the latter&#x27;s initial loyalty.

He made Bernard, margrave of Septimania, and Ebbo, Archbishop of Reims his chief counsellors. The latter, born a serf, was raised by Louis to that office, but betrayed him later. He retained some of his father&#x27;s ministers, such as Elisachar, abbot of St. Maximin near Trier, and Hildebold, Archbishop of Cologne. Later he replaced Elisachar with Hildwin, abbot of many monasteries.

He also employed Benedict of Aniane (the Second Benedict), a Septimanian Visigoth, whom he made abbot of the newly established &quot;Inden Monastery&quot; at Aix-la-Chapelle and charged him with the reform of the Frankish church. One of Benedict&#x27;s primary reforms was to ensure that all religious houses in Louis&#x27;s realm adhered to the Rule of Saint Benedict, named for its creator, Benedict of Nursia. From the start of his reign, his coinage imitated his father Charlemagne&#x27;s portrait, which gave it an image of imperial authority and prestige. In 816, Pope Stephen IV, who had succeeded Leo III, visited Reims and again crowned Louis on Sunday 5 October. As a result, most French kings were crowned in Reims, following the custom established by Louis the Pious.

===&quot;Ordinatio imperii&quot;===

On 9 April 817, Maundy Thursday, Louis and his court were crossing a wooden gallery from the cathedral to the palace in Aachen, when the gallery collapsed, killing many. Louis, having barely survived and feeling the imminent danger of death, began planning for his succession. Three months later among the approval of his Aachen court and the clergy he issued an imperial decree of eighteen chapters, the &quot;Ordinatio Imperii&quot;, that laid out plans for an orderly dynastic succession. The term &quot;Ordinatio Imperii&quot; is a modern (19th-century) creation. The decree is called &quot;divisio imperii&quot; in the only surviving contemporary manuscript.

In 815, Louis had already given his two eldest sons a share in the government, when he had sent his elder sons Lothair and Pepin to govern Bavaria and Aquitaine, respectively, though without the royal titles. He proceeded to divide the empire among his three sons:

* Lothair was proclaimed and crowned co-emperor in Aachen by his father. He was promised the succession to most of the Frankish dominions (excluding the exceptions below), and would be the overlord of his brothers and cousin.
* Pepin was proclaimed King of Aquitaine, his territory including Gascony, the march around Toulouse, and the counties of Carcassonne, Autun, Avallon and Nevers.
* Louis, the youngest son, was proclaimed King of Bavaria and the neighbouring marches.

If one of the subordinate kings died, he was to be succeeded by his sons. If he died childless, Lothair would inherit his kingdom. In the event of Lothair dying without sons, one of Louis the Pious&#x27;s younger sons would be chosen to replace him by &quot;the people&quot;. Above all, the Empire would not be divided: the Emperor would rule supreme over the subordinate kings, whose obedience to him was mandatory.

With this settlement, Louis attempted to combine his sense for the Empire&#x27;s unity, supported by the clergy, while at the same time providing positions for all of his sons. Instead of treating his sons equally in status and land, he elevated his first-born son Lothair above his younger brothers and gave him the largest part of the Empire as his share.

The decree failed to create order as it omitted Bernard, who immediately began to conspire. When Louis began to issue changes in favor of his second wife Judith&#x27;s son Charles the Bald, his sons Lothar, Pepin and Louis refused to accept. The rule of sons being favoured over brothers in succession remained also untouched.

===Bernard&#x27;s rebellion and Louis&#x27;s penance===

The &quot;ordinatio imperii&quot; of Aachen left Bernard in Italy in an uncertain and subordinate position as king of Italy, and he began plotting to declare independence. Upon hearing of this, Louis immediately directed his army towards Italy, and headed for Chalon-sur-Saône. Intimidated by the emperor&#x27;s swift action, Bernard met his uncle at Chalon, under invitation, and surrendered. He was taken to Aachen by Louis, who there had him tried and condemned to death for treason. Louis had the sentence commuted to blinding, which was duly carried out; Bernard did not survive the ordeal, however, dying after two days of agony. Others also suffered: Theodulf of Orléans, in eclipse since the death of Charlemagne, was accused of having supported the rebellion, and was thrown into a monastic prison, dying soon afterwards; it was rumored that he had been poisoned. The fate of his nephew deeply marked Louis&#x27;s conscience for the rest of his life.

In 822, as a deeply religious man, Louis performed penance for causing Bernard&#x27;s death, at his palace of Attigny near Vouziers in the Ardennes, before Pope Paschal I, and a council of clerics and nobles of the realm that had been convened for the reconciliation of Louis with his three younger half-brothers, Hugo whom he soon made abbot of St-Quentin, Drogo whom he soon made Bishop of Metz, and Theodoric. This act of contrition, partly in emulation of Theodosius I, had the effect of greatly reducing his prestige as a Frankish ruler, for he also recited a list of minor offences about which no secular ruler of the time would have taken any notice. He also made the egregious error of releasing Wala and Adalard from their monastic confinements, placing the former in a position of power in the court of Lothair and the latter in a position in his own house.

===Frontier wars===
At the start of Louis&#x27;s reign, the many tribes—Danes, Obotrites, Slovenes, Bretons and Basques—which inhabited his frontierlands were still in awe of the Frankish emperor&#x27;s power and dared not stir up any trouble. In 816, however, the Sorbs rebelled and were quickly followed by Slavomir, chief of the Obotrites, who was captured and abandoned by his own people, being replaced by Ceadrag in 818. Soon, Ceadrag too had turned against the Franks and allied with the Danes, who were to become the greatest menace to the Franks in a short time.

A greater Slavic menace was gathering on the southeast. There, Ljudevit, duke of Slavs in Lower Pannonia, was harassing the border at the Drava and Sava rivers. The margrave of Friuli, Cadolah, was sent out against him, but he died on campaign and, in 820, his margravate was invaded by Slovenes. In 821, an alliance was made with Borna, duke of the Dalmatia, and Liudewit was brought to heel. In 824 several Slav tribes in the north-western parts of Bulgaria acknowledged Louis&#x27;s suzerainty and after he was reluctant to settle the matter peacefully with the Bulgarian ruler Omurtag, in 827 the Bulgarians attacked the Franks in the March of Pannonia and regained their lands.

On the far southern edge of his great realm, Louis had to control the Lombard princes of Benevento whom Charlemagne had never subjugated. He extracted promises from Princes Grimoald IV and Sico, but to no effect.

On the southwestern frontier, problems commenced early when c. 812, Louis the Pious crossed the western Pyrenees &#x27;to settle matters&#x27; in Pamplona. The expedition made its way back north, where it narrowly escaped an ambush attempt arranged by the Basques in the pass of Roncevaux thanks to the precautions he took, i.e. hostages. Séguin, duke of Gascony, was then deposed by Louis in 816, possibly for failing to suppress or collaborating with the Basque revolt south of the western Pyrenees, so sparking off a Basque uprising that was duly put down by the Frankish emperor in Dax. Seguin was replaced by Lupus III, who was dispossessed in 818 by the emperor. In 820 an assembly at Quierzy-sur-Oise decided to send an expedition against the Cordoban caliphate (827). The counts in charge of the army, Hugh, count of Tours, and Matfrid, count of Orléans, were slow in acting and the expedition came to naught.

===First civil war===
In 818, as Louis was returning from a campaign to Brittany, he was greeted by news of the death of his wife, Ermengarde. Ermengarde was the daughter of Ingerman, the duke of Hesbaye. Louis had been close to his wife, who had been involved in policymaking. It was rumoured that she had played a part in her nephew&#x27;s death and Louis himself believed her own death was divine retribution for that event. It took many months for his courtiers and advisors to convince him to remarry, but eventually he did, in 820, to Judith, daughter of Welf, count of Altdorf. In 823 Judith gave birth to a son, who was named Charles.

The birth of this son damaged the &quot;Partition of Aachen&quot;, as Louis&#x27;s attempts to provide for his fourth son met with stiff resistance from his older sons, and the last two decades of his reign were marked by civil war. At Worms in 829, Louis gave Alemannia to Charles, with the title of king or duke (historians differ on this), thus enraging his son and co-emperor Lothair, whose promised share was thereby diminished. An insurrection was soon at hand.

With the urging of the vengeful Wala and the cooperation of his brothers, Lothair accused Judith of having committed adultery with Bernard of Septimania, even suggesting Bernard to be the true father of Charles. Ebbo and Hildwin abandoned the emperor at that point, Bernard having risen to greater heights than either of them. Agobard, Archbishop of Lyon, and Jesse of Amiens, bishop of Amiens, too, opposed the redivision of the empire and lent their episcopal prestige to the rebels.

In 830, at Wala&#x27;s insistence that Bernard of Septimania was plotting against him, Pepin of Aquitaine led an army of Gascons, with the support of the Neustrian magnates, all the way to Paris. At Verberie, Louis the German joined him. At that time, the emperor returned from another campaign in Brittany to find his empire at war with itself. He marched as far as Compiègne, an ancient royal town, before being surrounded by Pepin&#x27;s forces and captured. Judith was incarcerated at Poitiers and Bernard fled to Barcelona.

Then Lothair finally set out with a large Lombard army, but Louis had promised his sons Louis the German and Pepin of Aquitaine greater shares of the inheritance, prompting them to shift loyalties in favour of their father. When Lothair tried to call a general council of the realm in Nijmegen, in the heart of Austrasia, the Austrasians and Rhinelanders came with a following of armed retainers, and the disloyal sons were forced to free their father and bow at his feet (831). Lothair was pardoned, but disgraced and banished to Italy.

Pepin returned to Aquitaine and Judith—after being forced to humiliate herself with a solemn oath of innocence—to Louis&#x27;s court. Only Wala was severely dealt with, making his way to a secluded monastery on the shores of Lake Geneva. Although Hilduin, abbot of Saint Denis, was exiled to Paderborn and Elisachar and Matfrid were deprived of their honours north of the Alps, they did not lose their freedom.

===Second civil war===
The next revolt occurred a mere two years later, in 832. The disaffected Pepin was summoned to his father&#x27;s court, where he was so poorly received he left against his father&#x27;s orders. Immediately, fearing that Pepin would be stirred up to revolt by his nobles and desiring to reform his morals, Louis the Pious summoned all his forces to meet in Aquitaine in preparation of an uprising, but Louis the German garnered an army of Slav allies and conquered Swabia before the emperor could react. Once again the elder Louis divided his vast realm. At Jonac, he declared Charles king of Aquitaine and deprived Pepin (he was less harsh with the younger Louis), restoring the whole rest of the empire to Lothair, not yet involved in the civil war. Lothair was, however, interested in usurping his father&#x27;s authority. His ministers had been in contact with Pepin and may have convinced him and Louis the German to rebel, promising him Alemannia, the kingdom of Charles.

Soon Lothair, with the support of Pope Gregory IV, whom he had confirmed in office without his father&#x27;s support, joined the revolt in 833. While Louis was at Worms gathering a new force, Lothair marched north. Louis marched south. The armies met on the plains of the Rothfeld. There, Gregory met the emperor and may have tried to sow dissension amongst his ranks. Soon much of Louis&#x27;s army had evaporated before his eyes, and he ordered his few remaining followers to go, because &quot;it would be a pity if any man lost his life or limb on my account.&quot; The resigned emperor was taken to Saint-Médard de Soissons, his son Charles to Prüm, and the queen to Tortona. The despicable show of disloyalty and disingenuousness earned the site the name Field of Lies, or Lügenfeld, or Campus Mendacii, &quot;ubi plurimorum fidelitas exstincta est&quot;.

On 13 November 833, Ebbo, with Agobard of Lyon, presided over a synod at the Church of Saint Medard in Soissons which saw Louis undertake public penance for the second time in his reign. The penitential ritual that was undertaken began when Louis arrived at the church and confessed multiple times to the crimes levied against him. The crimes had been historic and recent, with accusations of oath breaking, violation of the public peace and inability to control his adulterous wife, Judith of Bavaria. Afterwards, he threw his sword belt at the base of the altar and received judgement through the imposition of the hands of the bishops. Louis was to live the rest of his life as a penitent, never to hold office again. The penance divided the aristocracy. The anonymous biographer of the &quot;Vita Hludovici&quot; criticized the whole affair on the basis that God does not judge twice for sins committed and confessed. Lothair&#x27;s allies were generously compensated. Ebbo himself received the monastery of St Vaast whilst Pepin was allowed to keep the lands reclaimed from his father.

Men like Rabanus Maurus, Louis&#x27;s younger half-brothers Drogo and Hugh, and Emma, Judith&#x27;s sister and Louis the German&#x27;s new wife, worked on the younger Louis to make peace with his father, for the sake of unity of the empire. The humiliation to which Louis was then subjected at Notre Dame in Compiègne turned the loyal barons of Austrasia and Saxony against Lothair, and the usurper fled to Burgundy, skirmishing with loyalists near Chalon-sur-Saône. Louis was restored the next year, on 1 March 834.

On Lothair&#x27;s return to Italy, Wala, Jesse and Matfrid, formerly count of Orléans, died of a pestilence. On 2 February 835 at the palace Thionville, Louis presided over a general council to deal with the events of the previous year. Known as the Synod of Thionville, Louis himself was reinvested with his ancestral garb and the crown, symbols of Carolingian rulership. Furthermore, the penance of 833 was officially reversed and Archbishop Ebbo officially resigned after confessing to a capital crime, whilst Agobard of Lyon and Bartholmew, Archbishop of Narbonne were also deposed. Later that year Lothair fell ill; once again the events turned in Louis favour.

In 836, however, the family made peace and Louis restored Pepin and Louis, deprived Lothair of all save Italy, and gave it to Charles in a new division, given at the diet of Crémieu. At about that time, the Vikings terrorized and sacked Utrecht and Antwerp. In 837, they went up the Rhine as far as Nijmegen, and their king, Rorik, demanded the weregild of some of his followers killed on previous expeditions before Louis the Pious mustered a massive force and marched against them. They fled, but it would not be the last time they harried the northern coasts. In 838, they even claimed sovereignty over Frisia, but a treaty was confirmed between them and the Franks in 839. Louis the Pious ordered the construction of a North Sea fleet and the sending of &quot;missi dominici&quot; into Frisia to establish Frankish sovereignty there.

===Third civil war===
In 837, Louis crowned Charles king over all of Alemannia and Burgundy and gave him a portion of his brother Louis&#x27;s land. Louis the German promptly rose in revolt, and the emperor redivided his realm again at Quierzy-sur-Oise, giving all of the young king of Bavaria&#x27;s lands, save Bavaria itself, to Charles. Emperor Louis did not stop there, however. His devotion to Charles knew no bounds. When Pepin died in 838, Louis declared Charles the new king of Aquitaine. The nobles, however, elected Pepin&#x27;s son Pepin II. When Louis threatened invasion, the third great civil war of his reign broke out. In the spring of 839, Louis the German invaded Swabia, Pepin II and his Gascon subjects fought all the way to the Loire, and the Danes returned to ravage the Frisian coast (sacking Dorestad for a second time).

Lothair, for the first time in a long time, allied with his father and pledged support at Worms in exchange for a redivision of the inheritance. At a final &quot;placitum&quot; held at Worms on 20 May, Louis gave Bavaria to Louis the German and disinherited Pepin II, leaving the entire remainder of the empire to be divided roughly into an eastern part and a western. Lothair was given the choice of which partition he would inherit and he chose the eastern, including Italy, leaving the western for Charles. The emperor quickly subjugated Aquitaine and had Charles recognised by the nobles and clergy at Clermont-en-Auvergne in 840. Louis then, in a final flash of glory, rushed into Bavaria and forced the younger Louis into the Ostmark. The empire now settled as he had declared it at Worms, he returned in July to Frankfurt am Main, where he disbanded the army. The final civil war of his reign was over.

==Death==

Louis fell ill soon after his final victorious campaigns and retreated to his summer hunting lodge on an island in the Rhine near his palace at Ingelheim. He died on 20 June 840 in the presence of many bishops and clerics and in the arms of his half-brother Drogo as he pardoned his son Louis, proclaimed Lothair emperor and commended the absent Charles and Judith to his protection.

Soon dispute plunged the surviving brothers into yet another civil war. It lasted until 843 with the signing of the Treaty of Verdun, in which the division of the empire into three souvereign entities was settled. West Francia and East Francia became the kernels of modern France and Germany respectively. Middle Francia, that included Burgundy, the Low Countries and northern Italy among other regions was only short-lived until 855 and later reorganized as Lotharingia. The dispute over the kingship of Aquitaine was not fully settled until 860.

Louis was buried in the Abbey of Saint-Arnould in Metz.

<text>Liquid crystal (LC) is a state of matter whose properties are between those of conventional liquids and those of solid crystals. For example, a liquid crystal can flow like a liquid, but its molecules may be oriented in a common direction as in a solid. There are many types of LC phases, which can be distinguished by their optical properties (such as textures). The contrasting textures arise due to molecules within one area of material (&quot;domain&quot;) being oriented in the same direction but different areas having different orientations. An LC material may not always be in an LC state of matter (just as water may be ice or water vapour).

Liquid crystals can be divided into three main types: thermotropic, lyotropic, and metallotropic. Thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals consist mostly of organic molecules, although a few minerals are also known. Thermotropic LCs exhibit a phase transition into the LC phase as temperature changes. Lyotropic LCs exhibit phase transitions as a function of both temperature and concentration of molecules in a solvent (typically water). Metallotropic LCs are composed of both organic and inorganic molecules; their LC transition additionally depends on the inorganic-organic composition ratio.

Examples of LCs exist both in the natural world and in technological applications. Lyotropic LCs abound in living systems; many proteins and cell membranes are LCs, as well as the tobacco mosaic virus. LCs in the mineral world include solutions of soap and various related detergents, and some clays. Widespread liquid-crystal displays (LCD) use liquid crystals.

==History==
In 1888, Austrian botanical physiologist Friedrich Reinitzer, working at the Karl-Ferdinands-Universität, examined the physico-chemical properties of various derivatives of cholesterol which now belong to the class of materials known as cholesteric liquid crystals. Previously, other researchers had observed distinct color effects when cooling cholesterol derivatives just above the freezing point, but had not associated it with a new phenomenon. Reinitzer perceived that color changes in a derivative cholesteryl benzoate were not the most peculiar feature. He found that cholesteryl benzoate does not melt in the same manner as other compounds, but has two melting points. At it melts into a cloudy liquid, and at it melts again and the cloudy liquid becomes clear. The phenomenon is reversible. Seeking help from a physicist, on March 14, 1888, he wrote to Otto Lehmann, at that time a &quot;&quot; in Aachen. They exchanged letters and samples. Lehmann examined the intermediate cloudy fluid, and reported seeing crystallites. Reinitzer&#x27;s Viennese colleague von Zepharovich also indicated that the intermediate &quot;fluid&quot; was crystalline. The exchange of letters with Lehmann ended on April 24, with many questions unanswered. Reinitzer presented his results, with credits to Lehmann and von Zepharovich, at a meeting of the Vienna Chemical Society on May 3, 1888.

By that time, Reinitzer had discovered and described three important features of cholesteric liquid crystals (the name coined by Otto Lehmann in 1904): the existence of two melting points, the reflection of circularly polarized light, and the ability to rotate the polarization direction of light.

After his accidental discovery, Reinitzer did not pursue studying liquid crystals further. The research was continued by Lehmann, who realized that he had encountered a new phenomenon and was in a position to investigate it: In his postdoctoral years he had acquired expertise in crystallography and microscopy. Lehmann started a systematic study, first of cholesteryl benzoate, and then of related compounds which exhibited the double-melting phenomenon. He was able to make observations in polarized light, and his microscope was equipped with a hot stage (sample holder equipped with a heater) enabling high temperature observations. The intermediate cloudy phase clearly sustained flow, but other features, particularly the signature under a microscope, convinced Lehmann that he was dealing with a solid. By the end of August 1889 he had published his results in the Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie.
Lehmann&#x27;s work was continued and significantly expanded by the German chemist Daniel Vorländer, who from the beginning of the 20th century until he retired in 1935, had synthesized most of the liquid crystals known. However, liquid crystals were not popular among scientists and the material remained a pure scientific curiosity for about 80 years.

After World War II, work on the synthesis of liquid crystals was restarted at university research laboratories in Europe. George William Gray, a prominent researcher of liquid crystals, began investigating these materials in England in the late 1940s. His group synthesized many new materials that exhibited the liquid crystalline state and developed a better understanding of how to design molecules that exhibit the state. His book &quot;Molecular Structure and the Properties of Liquid Crystals&quot; became a guidebook on the subject. One of the first U.S. chemists to study liquid crystals was Glenn H. Brown, starting in 1953 at the University of Cincinnati and later at Kent State University. In 1965, he organized the first international conference on liquid crystals, in Kent, Ohio, with about 100 of the world&#x27;s top liquid crystal scientists in attendance. This conference marked the beginning of a worldwide effort to perform research in this field, which soon led to the development of practical applications for these unique materials.

Liquid crystal materials became a focus of research in the development of flat panel electronic displays beginning in 1962 at RCA Laboratories. When physical chemist Richard Williams applied an electric field to a thin layer of a nematic liquid crystal at 125 °C, he observed the formation of a regular pattern that he called domains (now known as Williams Domains). This led his colleague George H. Heilmeier to perform research on a liquid crystal-based flat panel display to replace the cathode ray vacuum tube used in televisions. But the para-azoxyanisole that Williams and Heilmeier used exhibits the nematic liquid crystal state only above 116 °C, which made it impractical to use in a commercial display product. A material that could be operated at room temperature was clearly needed.

In 1966, Joel E. Goldmacher and Joseph A. Castellano, research chemists in Heilmeier group at RCA, discovered that mixtures made exclusively of nematic compounds that differed only in the number of carbon atoms in the terminal side chains could yield room-temperature nematic liquid crystals. A ternary mixture of Schiff base compounds resulted in a material that had a nematic range of 22–105 °C. Operation at room temperature enabled the first practical display device to be made. The team then proceeded to prepare numerous mixtures of nematic compounds many of which had much lower melting points. This technique of mixing nematic compounds to obtain wide operating temperature range eventually became the industry standard and is still used to tailor materials to meet specific applications.
In 1969, Hans Keller succeeded in synthesizing a substance that had a nematic phase at room temperature, N-(4-methoxybenzylidene)-4-butylaniline (MBBA), which is one of the most popular subjects of liquid crystal research. The next step to commercialization of liquid-crystal displays was the synthesis of further chemically stable substances (cyanobiphenyls) with low melting temperatures by George Gray. That work with Ken Harrison and the UK MOD (RRE Malvern), in 1973, led to design of new materials resulting in rapid adoption of small area LCDs within electronic products.

These molecules are rod-shaped, some created in the laboratory and some appearing spontaneously in nature. Since then, two new types of LC molecules have been synthesized: disc-shaped (by Sivaramakrishna Chandrasekhar in India in 1977) and cone or bowl shaped (predicted by Lui Lam in China in 1982 and synthesized in Europe in 1985).

In 1991, when liquid crystal displays were already well established, Pierre-Gilles de Gennes working at the Université Paris-Sud received the Nobel Prize in physics &quot;for discovering that methods developed for studying order phenomena in simple systems can be generalized to more complex forms of matter, in particular to liquid crystals and polymers&quot;.

==Design of liquid crystalline materials==
A large number of chemical compounds are known to exhibit one or several liquid crystalline phases. Despite significant differences in chemical composition, these molecules have some common features in chemical and physical properties. There are three types of thermotropic liquid crystals: discotic, conic (bowlic), and rod-shaped molecules. Discotics are disc-like molecules consisting of a flat core of adjacent aromatic rings, whereas the core in a conic LC is not flat, but is shaped like a rice bowl (a three-dimensional object). This allows for two dimensional columnar ordering, for both discotic and conic LCs. Rod-shaped molecules have an elongated, anisotropic geometry which allows for preferential alignment along one spatial direction.

*The molecular shape should be relatively thin, flat or conic, especially within rigid molecular frameworks. 
*The molecular length should be at least 1.3 nm, consistent with the presence of long alkyl group on many room-temperature liquid crystals.
*The structure should not be branched or angular, except for the conic LC. 
*A low melting point is preferable in order to avoid metastable, monotropic liquid crystalline phases. Low-temperature mesomorphic behavior in general is technologically more useful, and alkyl terminal groups promote this.

An extended, structurally rigid, highly anisotropic shape seems to be the main criterion for liquid crystalline behavior, and as a result many liquid crystalline materials are based on benzene rings.

==Liquid-crystal phases==
The various liquid-crystal phases (called mesophases together with plastic crystal phases) can be characterized by the type of ordering. One can distinguish positional order (whether molecules are arranged in any sort of ordered lattice) and orientational order (whether molecules are mostly pointing in the same direction). Liquid crystals are characterized by orientational order, but only partial or completely absent positional order. In contrast, materials with positional order but no orientational order are known as plastic crystals. Most thermotropic LCs will have an isotropic phase at high temperature: heating will eventually drive them into a conventional liquid phase characterized by random and isotropic molecular ordering and fluid-like flow behavior. Under other conditions (for instance, lower temperature), a LC might inhabit one or more phases with significant anisotropic orientational structure and short-range orientational order while still having an ability to flow.

The ordering of liquid crystals extends up to the entire domain size, which may be on the order of micrometers, but usually not to the macroscopic scale as often occurs in classical crystalline solids. However some techniques, such as the use of boundaries or an applied electric field, can be used to enforce a single ordered domain in a macroscopic liquid crystal sample. The orientational ordering in a liquid crystal might extend along only one dimension, with the material being essentially disordered in the other two directions.

===Thermotropic liquid crystals===

Thermotropic phases are those that occur in a certain temperature range. If the temperature rise is too high, thermal motion will destroy the delicate cooperative ordering of the LC phase, pushing the material into a conventional isotropic liquid phase. At too low temperature, most LC materials will form a conventional crystal. Many thermotropic LCs exhibit a variety of phases as temperature is changed. For instance, a particular type of LC molecule (called a mesogen) may exhibit various smectic phases followed by the nematic phase and finally the isotropic phase as temperature is increased. An example of a compound displaying thermotropic LC behavior is para-azoxyanisole.

====Nematic phase====


The simplest liquid crystal phase is the nematic. In a nematic phase, organic molecules lack a crystalline positional order, but do self-align with their long axes roughly parallel. The molecules are free to flow and their center of mass positions are randomly distributed as in a liquid, but their orientation is constrained to form a long-range directional order. 

The word &quot;nematic&quot; comes from the Greek (&quot;&quot;), which means &quot;thread&quot;. This term originates from the disclinations: thread-like topological defects observed in nematic phases. 

Nematics also exhibit so-called &quot;hedgehog&quot; topological defects. In two dimensions, there are topological defects with topological charges and . Due to hydrodynamics, the defect moves considerably faster than the defect. When placed close to each other, the defects attract; upon collision, they annihilate. 

Most nematic phases are uniaxial: they have one axis (called a directrix) that is longer and preferred, with the other two being equivalent (can be approximated as cylinders or rods). However, some liquid crystals are biaxial nematic, meaning that in addition to orienting their long axis, they also orient along a secondary axis. Nematic crystals have fluidity similar to that of ordinary (isotropic) liquids but they can be easily aligned by an external magnetic or electric field. Aligned nematics have the optical properties of uniaxial crystals and this makes them extremely useful in liquid-crystal displays (LCD).

Nematic phases are also known in non-molecular systems: at high magnetic fields, electrons flow in bundles or stripes to create an &quot;electronic nematic&quot; form of matter.

====Smectic phases====

The smectic phases, which are found at lower temperatures than the nematic, form well-defined layers that can slide over one another in a manner similar to that of soap. The word &quot;smectic&quot; originates from the Latin word &quot;smecticus&quot;, meaning cleaning, or having soap-like properties.
The smectics are thus positionally ordered along one direction. In the Smectic A phase, the molecules are oriented along the layer normal, while in the Smectic C phase they are tilted away from it. These phases are liquid-like within the layers. There are many different smectic phases, all characterized by different types and degrees of positional and orientational order. Beyond organic molecules, Smectic ordering has also been reported to occur within colloidal suspensions of 2-D materials or nanosheets. One example of smectic LCs is &quot;p,p&quot;&#x27;-dinonylazobenzene.

====Chiral phases or twisted nematics====

The chiral nematic phase exhibits chirality (handedness). This phase is often called the &quot;cholesteric&quot; phase because it was first observed for cholesterol derivatives. Only chiral molecules can give rise to such a phase. This phase exhibits a twisting of the molecules perpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director. The finite twist angle between adjacent molecules is due to their asymmetric packing, which results in longer-range chiral order. In the smectic C* phase (an asterisk denotes a chiral phase), the molecules have positional ordering in a layered structure (as in the other smectic phases), with the molecules tilted by a finite angle with respect to the layer normal. The chirality induces a finite azimuthal twist from one layer to the next, producing a spiral twisting of the molecular axis along the layer normal, hence they are also called &quot;twisted nematics&quot;.
The &quot;chiral pitch&quot;, p, refers to the distance over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360° twist (but note that the structure of the chiral nematic phase repeats itself every half-pitch, since in this phase directors at 0° and ±180° are equivalent). The pitch, p, typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host (an achiral LC host material will form a chiral phase if doped with a chiral material), allowing the pitch of a given material to be tuned accordingly. In some liquid crystal systems, the pitch is of the same order as the wavelength of visible light. This causes these systems to exhibit unique optical properties, such as Bragg reflection and low-threshold laser emission, and these properties are exploited in a number of optical applications. For the case of Bragg reflection only the lowest-order reflection is allowed if the light is incident along the helical axis, whereas for oblique incidence higher-order reflections become permitted. Cholesteric liquid crystals also exhibit the unique property that they reflect circularly polarized light when it is incident along the helical axis and elliptically polarized if it comes in obliquely.
====Blue phases====
Blue phases are liquid crystal phases that appear in the temperature range between a chiral nematic phase and an isotropic liquid phase. Blue phases have a regular three-dimensional cubic structure of defects with lattice periods of several hundred nanometers, and thus they exhibit selective Bragg reflections in the wavelength range of visible light corresponding to the cubic lattice. It was theoretically predicted in 1981 that these phases can possess icosahedral symmetry similar to quasicrystals.

Although blue phases are of interest for fast light modulators or tunable photonic crystals, they exist in a very narrow temperature range, usually less than a few kelvins. Recently the stabilization of blue phases over a temperature range of more than 60 K including room temperature (260–326 K) has been demonstrated. Blue phases stabilized at room temperature allow electro-optical switching with response times of the order of 10−4 s. In May 2008, the first blue phase mode LCD panel had been developed.

Blue phase crystals, being a periodic cubic structure with a bandgap in the visible wavelength range, can be considered as 3D photonic crystals. Producing ideal blue phase crystals in large volumes is still problematic, since the produced crystals are usually polycrystalline (platelet structure) or the single crystal size is limited (in the micrometer range). Recently, blue phases obtained as ideal 3D photonic crystals in large volumes have been stabilized and produced with different controlled crystal lattice orientations.

====Discotic phases====
Disk-shaped LC molecules can orient themselves in a layer-like fashion known as the discotic nematic phase. If the disks pack into stacks, the phase is called a discotic columnar. The columns themselves may be organized into rectangular or hexagonal arrays. Chiral discotic phases, similar to the chiral nematic phase, are also known.

====Conic phases====
Conic LC molecules, like in discotics, can form columnar phases. Other phases, such as nonpolar nematic, polar nematic, stringbean, donut and onion phases, have been predicted. Conic phases, except nonpolar nematic, are polar phases.

===Lyotropic liquid crystals===
A lyotropic liquid crystal consists of two or more components that exhibit liquid-crystalline properties in certain concentration ranges. In the lyotropic phases, solvent molecules fill the space around the compounds to provide fluidity to the system. In contrast to thermotropic liquid crystals, these lyotropics have another degree of freedom of concentration that enables them to induce a variety of different phases.

A compound that has two immiscible hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts within the same molecule is called an amphiphilic molecule. Many amphiphilic molecules show lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase sequences depending on the volume balances between the hydrophilic part and hydrophobic part. These structures are formed through the micro-phase segregation of two incompatible components on a nanometer scale. Soap is an everyday example of a lyotropic liquid crystal.

The content of water or other solvent molecules changes the self-assembled structures. At very low amphiphile concentration, the molecules will be dispersed randomly without any ordering. At slightly higher (but still low) concentration, amphiphilic molecules will spontaneously assemble into micelles or vesicles. This is done so as to &#x27;hide&#x27; the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphile inside the micelle core, exposing a hydrophilic (water-soluble) surface to aqueous solution. These spherical objects do not order themselves in solution, however. At higher concentration, the assemblies will become ordered. A typical phase is a hexagonal columnar phase, where the amphiphiles form long cylinders (again with a hydrophilic surface) that arrange themselves into a roughly hexagonal lattice. This is called the middle soap phase. At still higher concentration, a lamellar phase (neat soap phase) may form, wherein extended sheets of amphiphiles are separated by thin layers of water. For some systems, a cubic (also called viscous isotropic) phase may exist between the hexagonal and lamellar phases, wherein spheres are formed that create a dense cubic lattice. These spheres may also be connected to one another, forming a bicontinuous cubic phase.

The objects created by amphiphiles are usually spherical (as in the case of micelles), but may also be disc-like (bicelles), rod-like, or biaxial (all three micelle axes are distinct). These anisotropic self-assembled nano-structures can then order themselves in much the same way as thermotropic liquid crystals do, forming large-scale versions of all the thermotropic phases (such as a nematic phase of rod-shaped micelles).

For some systems, at high concentrations, inverse phases are observed. That is, one may generate an inverse hexagonal columnar phase (columns of water encapsulated by amphiphiles) or an inverse micellar phase (a bulk liquid crystal sample with spherical water cavities).

A generic progression of phases, going from low to high amphiphile concentration, is:
* Discontinuous cubic phase (micellar cubic phase)
* Hexagonal phase (hexagonal columnar phase) (middle phase)
* Lamellar phase
* Bicontinuous cubic phase
* Reverse hexagonal columnar phase
* Inverse cubic phase (Inverse micellar phase)

Even within the same phases, their self-assembled structures are tunable by the concentration: for example, in lamellar phases, the layer distances increase with the solvent volume. Since lyotropic liquid crystals rely on a subtle balance of intermolecular interactions, it is more difficult to analyze their structures and properties than those of thermotropic liquid crystals.

Similar phases and characteristics can be observed in immiscible diblock copolymers.

===Metallotropic liquid crystals===

Liquid crystal phases can also be based on low-melting inorganic phases like ZnCl2 that have a structure formed of linked tetrahedra and easily form glasses. The addition of long chain soap-like molecules leads to a series of new phases that show a variety of liquid crystalline behavior both as a function of the inorganic-organic composition ratio and of temperature. This class of materials has been named metallotropic.

===Laboratory analysis of mesophases===

Thermotropic mesophases are detected and characterized by two major methods, the original method was use of thermal optical microscopy, in which a small sample of the material was placed between two crossed polarizers; the sample was then heated and cooled. As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the polarization of the light, it would appear very dark, whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both polarize the light in a uniform way, leading to brightness and color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), allows for more precise determination of phase transitions and transition enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase transitions, the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change. These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase transitions, such as key liquid crystal transitions.

Lyotropic mesophases are analyzed in a similar fashion, though these experiments are somewhat more complex, as the concentration of mesogen is a key factor. These experiments are run at various concentrations of mesogen in order to analyze that impact.

==Biological liquid crystals==
Lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases are abundant in living systems, the study of which is referred to as lipid polymorphism. Accordingly, lyotropic liquid crystals attract particular attention in the field of biomimetic chemistry. In particular, biological membranes and cell membranes are a form of liquid crystal. Their constituent molecules (e.g. phospholipids) are perpendicular to the membrane surface, yet the membrane is flexible. These lipids vary in shape (see page on lipid polymorphism). The constituent molecules can inter-mingle easily, but tend not to leave the membrane due to the high energy requirement of this process. Lipid molecules can flip from one side of the membrane to the other, this process being catalyzed by flippases and floppases (depending on the direction of movement). These liquid crystal membrane phases can also host important proteins such as receptors freely &quot;floating&quot; inside, or partly outside, the membrane, e.g. CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT).

Many other biological structures exhibit liquid-crystal behavior. For instance, the concentrated protein solution that is extruded by a spider to generate silk is, in fact, a liquid crystal phase. The precise ordering of molecules in silk is critical to its renowned strength. DNA and many polypeptides, including actively-driven cytoskeletal filaments, can also form liquid crystal phases. Monolayers of elongated cells have also been described to exhibit liquid-crystal behavior, and the associated topological defects have been associated with biological consequences, including cell death and extrusion. Together, these biological applications of liquid crystals form an important part of current academic research.

==Mineral liquid crystals==

Examples of liquid crystals can also be found in the mineral world, most of them being lyotropic. The first discovered was vanadium(V) oxide, by Zocher in 1925. Since then, few others have been discovered and studied in detail. The existence of a true nematic phase in the case of the smectite clays family was raised by Langmuir in 1938, but remained an open question for a very long time and was only confirmed recently.

With the rapid development of nanosciences, and the synthesis of many new anisotropic nanoparticles, the number of such mineral liquid crystals is increasing quickly, with, for example, carbon nanotubes and graphene. A lamellar phase was even discovered, H3Sb3P2O14, which exhibits hyperswelling up to ~250 nm for the interlamellar distance.

==Pattern formation in liquid crystals==

Anisotropy of liquid crystals is a property not observed in other fluids. This anisotropy makes flows of liquid crystals behave more differentially than those of ordinary fluids. For example, injection of a flux of a liquid crystal between two close parallel plates (viscous fingering) causes orientation of the molecules to couple with the flow, with the resulting emergence of dendritic patterns. This anisotropy is also manifested in the interfacial energy (surface tension) between different liquid crystal phases. This anisotropy determines the equilibrium shape at the coexistence temperature, and is so strong that usually facets appear. When temperature is changed one of the phases grows, forming different morphologies depending on the temperature change. Since growth is controlled by heat diffusion, anisotropy in thermal conductivity favors growth in specific directions, which has also an effect on the final shape.

==Theoretical treatment of liquid crystals==
Microscopic theoretical treatment of fluid phases can become quite complicated, owing to the high material density, meaning that strong interactions, hard-core repulsions, and many-body correlations cannot be ignored. In the case of liquid crystals, anisotropy in all of these interactions further complicates analysis. There are a number of fairly simple theories, however, that can at least predict the general behavior of the phase transitions in liquid crystal systems.

===Director===

As we already saw above, the nematic liquid crystals are composed of rod-like molecules with the long axes of neighboring molecules aligned approximately to one another. To describe this anisotropic structure, a dimensionless unit vector n called the &quot;director&quot;, is introduced to represent the direction of preferred orientation of molecules in the neighborhood of any point. Because there is no physical polarity along the director axis, n and -n are fully equivalent.

===Order parameter===

The description of liquid crystals involves an analysis of order. A second rank symmetric traceless tensor order parameter, the Q tensor is used to describe the orientational order of the most general biaxial nematic liquid crystal. However, to describe the more common case of uniaxial nematic liquid crystals, a scalar order parameter is sufficient. To make this quantitative, an orientational order parameter is usually defined based on the average of the second Legendre polynomial:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the angle between the liquid-crystal molecular axis and the &quot;local director&quot; (which is the &#x27;preferred direction&#x27; in a volume element of a liquid crystal sample, also representing its &quot;local optical axis&quot;). The brackets denote both a temporal and spatial average. This definition is convenient, since for a completely random and isotropic sample, &quot;S&quot; = 0, whereas for a perfectly aligned sample S=1. For a typical liquid crystal sample, &quot;S&quot; is on the order of 0.3 to 0.8, and generally decreases as the temperature is raised. In particular, a sharp drop of the order parameter to 0 is observed when the system undergoes a phase transition from an LC phase into the isotropic phase. The order parameter can be measured experimentally in a number of ways; for instance, diamagnetism, birefringence, Raman scattering, NMR and EPR can be used to determine S.

The order of a liquid crystal could also be characterized by using other even Legendre polynomials (all the odd polynomials average to zero since the director can point in either of two antiparallel directions). These higher-order averages are more difficult to measure, but can yield additional information about molecular ordering.

A positional order parameter is also used to describe the ordering of a liquid crystal. It is characterized by the variation of the density of the center of mass of the liquid crystal molecules along a given vector. In the case of positional variation along the &quot;z&quot;-axis the density formula_3 is often given by:

:formula_4

The complex positional order parameter is defined as formula_5 and formula_6 the average density. Typically only the first two terms are kept and higher order terms are ignored since most phases can be described adequately using sinusoidal functions. For a perfect nematic formula_7 and for a smectic phase formula_8 will take on complex values. The complex nature of this order parameter allows for many parallels between nematic to smectic phase transitions and conductor to superconductor transitions.

===Onsager hard-rod model===

A simple model which predicts lyotropic phase transitions is the hard-rod model proposed by Lars Onsager. This theory considers the volume excluded from the center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, there is very little volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder&#x27;s center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a &quot;decrease&quot; in the net positional entropy of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).

The fundamental insight here is that, whilst parallel arrangements of anisotropic objects lead to a decrease in orientational entropy, there is an increase in positional entropy. Thus in some case greater positional order will be entropically favorable. This theory thus predicts that a solution of rod-shaped objects will undergo a phase transition, at sufficient concentration, into a nematic phase. Although this model is conceptually helpful, its mathematical formulation makes several assumptions that limit its applicability to real systems. An extension of Onsager Theory was proposed by Flory to account for non entropic effects.

===Maier–Saupe mean field theory===
This statistical theory, proposed by Alfred Saupe and Wilhelm Maier, includes contributions from an attractive intermolecular potential from an induced dipole moment between adjacent rod-like liquid crystal molecules. The anisotropic attraction stabilizes parallel alignment of neighboring molecules, and the theory then considers a mean-field average of the interaction. Solved self-consistently, this theory predicts thermotropic nematic-isotropic phase transitions, consistent with experiment. Maier-Saupe mean field theory is extended to high molecular weight liquid crystals by incorporating the bending stiffness of the molecules and using the method of path integrals in polymer science.

===McMillan&#x27;s model===
McMillan&#x27;s model, proposed by William McMillan, is an extension of the Maier–Saupe mean field theory used to describe the phase transition of a liquid crystal from a nematic to a smectic A phase. It predicts that the phase transition can be either continuous or discontinuous depending on the strength of the short-range interaction between the molecules. As a result, it allows for a triple critical point where the nematic, isotropic, and smectic A phase meet. Although it predicts the existence of a triple critical point, it does not successfully predict its value. The model utilizes two order parameters that describe the orientational and positional order of the liquid crystal. The first is simply the average of the second Legendre polynomial and the second order parameter is given by:

: formula_9

The values &quot;zi, θi&quot;, and &quot;d&quot; are the position of the molecule, the angle between the molecular axis and director, and the layer spacing. The postulated potential energy of a single molecule is given by:

:formula_10

Here constant α quantifies the strength of the interaction between adjacent molecules. The potential is then used to derive the thermodynamic properties of the system assuming thermal equilibrium. It results in two self-consistency equations that must be solved numerically, the solutions of which are the three stable phases of the liquid crystal.

===Elastic continuum theory===

In this formalism, a liquid crystal material is treated as a continuum; molecular details are entirely ignored. Rather, this theory considers perturbations to a presumed oriented sample. The distortions of the liquid crystal are commonly described by the Frank free energy density. One can identify three types of distortions that could occur in an oriented sample: (1) twists of the material, where neighboring molecules are forced to be angled with respect to one another, rather than aligned; (2) splay of the material, where bending occurs perpendicular to the director; and (3) bend of the material, where the distortion is parallel to the director and molecular axis. All three of these types of distortions incur an energy penalty. They are distortions that are induced by the boundary conditions at domain walls or the enclosing container. The response of the material can then be decomposed into terms based on the elastic constants corresponding to the three types of distortions. Elastic continuum theory is an effective tool for modeling liquid crystal devices and lipid bilayers.

==External influences on liquid crystals==
Scientists and engineers are able to use liquid crystals in a variety of applications because external perturbation can cause significant changes in the macroscopic properties of the liquid crystal system. Both electric and magnetic fields can be used to induce these changes. The magnitude of the fields, as well as the speed at which the molecules align are important characteristics industry deals with. Special surface treatments can be used in liquid crystal devices to force specific orientations of the director.

===Electric and magnetic field effects===
The ability of the director to align along an external field is caused by the electric nature of the molecules. Permanent electric dipoles result when one end of a molecule has a net positive charge while the other end has a net negative charge. When an external electric field is applied to the liquid crystal, the dipole molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field.

Even if a molecule does not form a permanent dipole, it can still be influenced by an electric field. In some cases, the field produces slight re-arrangement of electrons and protons in molecules such that an induced electric dipole results. While not as strong as permanent dipoles, orientation with the external field still occurs.

The response of any system to an external electrical field is

: formula_11

where formula_12, formula_13 and formula_14 are the components of the electric field, electric displacement field and polarization density. The electric energy per volume stored in the system is

: formula_15

(summation over the doubly appearing index formula_16). In nematic liquid crystals, the polarization, and electric displacement both depend linearly on the direction of the electric field. The polarization should be even in the director since liquid crystals are invariants under reflexions of formula_17. The most general form to express formula_18 is

: formula_19

(summation over the index formula_20) with formula_21 and formula_22 the electric permittivity parallel and perpendicular to the director formula_17. Then density of energy is (ignoring the constant terms that do not contribute to the dynamics of the system)

: formula_24

(summation over formula_16). If formula_26 is positive, then the minimum of the energy is achieved when formula_27 and formula_17 are parallel. This means that the system will favor aligning the liquid crystal with the externally applied electric field. If formula_26 is negative, then the minimum of the energy is achieved when formula_27 and formula_17 are perpendicular (in nematics the perpendicular orientation is degenerated, making possible the emergence of vortices).

The difference formula_32 is called dielectrical anisotropy and is an important parameter in liquid crystal applications. There are both formula_33 and formula_34 commercial liquid crystals. 5CB and E7 liquid crystal mixture are two formula_33 liquid crystals commonly used. MBBA is a common formula_34 liquid crystal.

The effects of magnetic fields on liquid crystal molecules are analogous to electric fields. Because magnetic fields are generated by moving electric charges, permanent magnetic dipoles are produced by electrons moving about atoms. When a magnetic field is applied, the molecules will tend to align with or against the field. Electromagnetic radiation, e.g. UV-Visible light, can influence light-responsive liquid crystals which mainly carry at least a photo-switchable unit.

===Surface preparations===
In the absence of an external field, the director of a liquid crystal is free to point in any direction. It is possible, however, to force the director to point in a specific direction by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is spread on a glass substrate and rubbed in a single direction with a cloth, it is observed that liquid crystal molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing direction. The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an epitaxial growth of the liquid crystal layers on the partially aligned polymer chains in the near surface layers of the polyimide.

Several liquid crystal chemicals also align to a &#x27;command surface&#x27; which is in turn aligned by electric field of polarized light. This process is called photoalignment.

===Fréedericksz transition===
The competition between orientation produced by surface anchoring and by electric field effects is often exploited in liquid crystal devices. Consider the case in which liquid crystal molecules are aligned parallel to the surface and an electric field is applied perpendicular to the cell. At first, as the electric field increases in magnitude, no change in alignment occurs. However at a threshold magnitude of electric field, deformation occurs. Deformation occurs where the director changes its orientation from one molecule to the next. The occurrence of such a change from an aligned to a deformed state is called a Fréedericksz transition and can also be produced by the application of a magnetic field of sufficient strength.

The Fréedericksz transition is fundamental to the operation of many liquid crystal displays because the director orientation (and thus the properties) can be controlled easily by the application of a field.

==Effect of chirality==
As already described, chiral liquid-crystal molecules usually give rise to chiral mesophases. This means that the molecule must possess some form of asymmetry, usually a stereogenic center. An additional requirement is that the system not be racemic: a mixture of right- and left-handed molecules will cancel the chiral effect. Due to the cooperative nature of liquid crystal ordering, however, a small amount of chiral dopant in an otherwise achiral mesophase is often enough to select out one domain handedness, making the system overall chiral.

Chiral phases usually have a helical twisting of the molecules. If the pitch of this twist is on the order of the wavelength of visible light, then interesting optical interference effects can be observed. The chiral twisting that occurs in chiral LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. These materials can thus be used as polarization filters.

It is possible for chiral LC molecules to produce essentially achiral mesophases. For instance, in certain ranges of concentration and molecular weight, DNA will form an achiral line hexatic phase. An interesting recent observation is of the formation of chiral mesophases from achiral LC molecules. Specifically, bent-core molecules (sometimes called banana liquid crystals) have been shown to form liquid crystal phases that are chiral. In any particular sample, various domains will have opposite handedness, but within any given domain, strong chiral ordering will be present. The appearance mechanism of this macroscopic chirality is not yet entirely clear. It appears that the molecules stack in layers and orient themselves in a tilted fashion inside the layers. These liquid crystals phases may be ferroelectric or anti-ferroelectric, both of which are of interest for applications.

Chirality can also be incorporated into a phase by adding a chiral dopant, which may not form LCs itself. Twisted-nematic or super-twisted nematic mixtures often contain a small amount of such dopants.

==Applications of liquid crystals==


Liquid crystals find wide use in liquid crystal displays, which rely on the optical properties of certain liquid crystalline substances in the presence or absence of an electric field. In a typical device, a liquid crystal layer (typically 4 μm thick) sits between two polarizers that are crossed (oriented at 90° to one another). The liquid crystal alignment is chosen so that its relaxed phase is a twisted one (see Twisted nematic field effect). This twisted phase reorients light that has passed through the first polarizer, allowing its transmission through the second polarizer (and reflected back to the observer if a reflector is provided). The device thus appears transparent. When an electric field is applied to the LC layer, the long molecular axes tend to align parallel to the electric field thus gradually untwisting in the center of the liquid crystal layer. In this state, the LC molecules do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first polarizer is absorbed at the second polarizer, and the device loses transparency with increasing voltage. In this way, the electric field can be used to make a pixel switch between transparent or opaque on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels. Chiral smectic liquid crystals are used in ferroelectric LCDs which are fast-switching binary light modulators. Similar principles can be used to make other liquid crystal based optical devices.

Liquid crystal tunable filters are used as electro-optical devices, e.g., in hyperspectral imaging.

Thermotropic chiral LCs whose pitch varies strongly with temperature can be used as crude liquid crystal thermometers, since the color of the material will change as the pitch is changed. Liquid crystal color transitions are used on many aquarium and pool thermometers as well as on thermometers for infants or baths. Other liquid crystal materials change color when stretched or stressed. Thus, liquid crystal sheets are often used in industry to look for hot spots, map heat flow, measure stress distribution patterns, and so on. Liquid crystal in fluid form is used to detect electrically generated hot spots for failure analysis in the semiconductor industry.

Liquid crystal lenses converge or diverge the incident light by adjusting the refractive index of liquid crystal layer with applied voltage or temperature. Generally, the liquid crystal lenses generate a parabolic refractive index distribution by arranging molecular orientations. Therefore, a plane wave is reshaped into a parabolic wavefront by a liquid crystal lens. The focal length of liquid crystal lenses could be continuously tunable when the external electric field can be properly tuned. Liquid crystal lenses are a kind of adaptive optics. Imaging systems can benefit from focusing correction, image plane adjustment, or changing the range of depth-of-field or depth of focus. The liquid crystal lense is one of the candidates to develop vision correction devices for myopia and presbyopia (e.g., tunable eyeglass and smart contact lenses). Being an optical phase modulator, a liquid crystal lens feature space-variant optical path length (i.e., optical path length as the function of its pupil coordinate). In different imaging system, the required function of optical path length varies from one to another. For example, to converge a plane wave into a diffraction limited spot, for a physically-planar liquid crystal structure, the refractive index of liquid crystal layer should be spherical or paraboloidal under paraxial approximation. As for projecting images or sensing objects, it may be expected to have the liquid crystal lens with aspheric distribution of optical path length across its aperture of interest. Liquid crystal lenses with electrically tunable refractive index (by addressing the different magnitude of electric field on liquid crystal layer) have potentials to achieve arbitrary function of optical path length for modulating incoming wavefront; current liquid crystal freeform optical elements were extended from liquid crystal lens with same optical mechanisms. The applications of liquid crystals lenses includes pico-projectors, prescriptions lenses (eyeglasses or contact lenses), smart phone camera, augmented reality, virtual reality etc.

Liquid crystal lasers use a liquid crystal in the lasing medium as a distributed feedback mechanism instead of external mirrors. Emission at a photonic bandgap created by the periodic dielectric structure of the liquid crystal gives a low-threshold high-output device with stable monochromatic emission.

Polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) sheets and rolls are available as adhesive backed Smart film which can be applied to windows and electrically switched between transparent and opaque to provide privacy.

Many common fluids, such as soapy water, are in fact liquid crystals. Soap forms a variety of LC phases depending on its concentration in water.

Liquid crystal films have revolutionized the world of technology. Currently they are used in the most diverse devices, such as digital clocks, mobile phones, calculating machines and televisions. The use of liquid crystal films in optical memory devices, with a process similar to the recording and reading of CDs and DVDs may be possible.

Liquid crystals are also used as basic technology to imitate quantum computers, using electric fields to manipulate the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules, to store data and to encode a different value for every different degree of misalignment with other molecules.

<text>A long gun is a category of firearms with long barrels. In small arms, a &quot;long gun&quot; or longarm is generally designed to be held by both hands and braced against the shoulder, in contrast to a handgun, which can be fired being held with a single hand. In the context of cannons and mounted firearms, an artillery &quot;long gun&quot; would be contrasted with a field gun or howitzer.

==Small arms==

The actual length of the barrels of a long gun is subject to various laws in many jurisdictions, mainly concerning minimum length, sometimes as measured in a specific position or configuration. The National Firearms Act in the United States sets a minimum length of for rifle barrels and for shotgun barrels. Canada sets a minimum of for either. In addition, Canada sets a minimum fireable length for long guns with detachable or folding stocks . In the United States, the minimum length for long guns with detachable or folding stocks is with the stock in the extended position.

Examples of various classes of small arms generally considered long arms include, but are not limited to shotguns, personal defense weapons, submachine guns, carbines, assault rifles, designated marksman rifles, sniper rifles, anti-material rifles, light machine guns, medium machine guns, and heavy machine guns.

===Advantages and disadvantages===
Almost all long arms have front grips (forearms) and shoulder stocks, which provide the user the ability to hold the firearm more steadily than a handgun. In addition, the long barrel of a long gun usually provides a longer distance between the front and rear sights, providing the user with more precision when aiming. The presence of a stock makes the use of a telescopic sight or red dot sight easier than with a handgun.

The mass of a long gun is usually greater than that of a handgun, making the long gun more expensive to transport, and more difficult and tiring to carry. The increased moment of inertia makes the long gun slower and more difficult to traverse and elevate, and it is thus slower and more difficult to adjust the aim. However, this also results in greater stability in aiming. The greater amount of material in a long gun tends to make it more expensive to manufacture, other factors being equal. The greater size makes it more difficult to conceal, and more inconvenient to use in confined quarters, as well as requiring larger storage space.

As long guns include a stock that is braced against the shoulder, the recoil when firing is transferred directly into the body of the user. This allows better control of aim than handguns, which do not include stock, and thus all their recoil must be transferred to the arms of the user. It also makes it possible to manage larger amounts of recoil without damage or loss of control; in combination with the higher mass of long guns, this means more propellant (such as gunpowder) can be used and thus larger projectiles can be fired at higher velocities. This is one of the main reasons for the use of long guns over handguns—faster or heavier projectiles help with penetration and accuracy over longer distances.

Shotguns are long guns that are designed to fire many small projectiles at once. This makes them very effective at close ranges, but with diminished usefulness at long ranges, even with shotgun slugs they are mostly only effective to about .

==Naval long guns==
In historical navy usage, a long gun was the standard type of cannon mounted by a sailing vessel, called such to distinguish it from the much shorter carronades. In informal usage, the length was combined with the weight of the shot, yielding terms like &quot;long 9s&quot;, referring to full-length cannons firing a 9-pound round shot.

<text>In chemistry, the law of definite proportions, sometimes called Proust&#x27;s law or the law of constant composition, states that a given 
chemical compound contains its constituent elements in a fixed ratio (by mass) and does not depend on its source or method of preparation. For example, oxygen makes up about 8/9 of the mass of any sample of pure water, while hydrogen makes up the remaining 1/9 of the mass: the mass of two elements in a compound are always in the same ratio. Along with the law of multiple proportions, the law of definite proportions forms the basis of stoichiometry.

==History==
The law of definite proportion was given by Joseph Proust in 1797. 

At the end of the 18th century, when the concept of a chemical compound had not yet been fully developed, the law was novel. In fact, when first proposed, it was a controversial statement and was opposed by other chemists, most notably Proust&#x27;s fellow Frenchman Claude Louis Berthollet, who argued that the elements could combine in any proportion. The existence of this debate demonstrates that, at the time, the distinction between pure chemical compounds and mixtures had not yet been fully developed.

The law of definite proportions contributed to the atomic theory that John Dalton promoted beginning in 1805, which explained matter as consisting of discrete atoms, that there was one type of atom for each element, and that the compounds were made of combinations of different types of atoms in fixed proportions.

A related early idea was Prout&#x27;s hypothesis, formulated by English chemist William Prout, who proposed that the hydrogen atom was the fundamental atomic unit. From this hypothesis was derived the whole number rule, which was the rule of thumb that atomic masses were whole number multiples of the mass of hydrogen. This was later rejected in the 1820s and 30s following more refined measurements of atomic mass, notably by Jöns Jacob Berzelius, which revealed in particular that the atomic mass of chlorine was 35.45, which was incompatible with the hypothesis. Since the 1920s this discrepancy has been explained by the presence of isotopes; the atomic mass of any isotope is very close to satisfying the whole number rule, with the mass defect caused by differing binding energies being significantly smaller.

==Non-stoichiometric compounds and isotopes==

Although very useful in the foundation of modern chemistry, the law of definite proportions is not universally true. There exist non-stoichiometric compounds whose elemental composition can vary from sample to sample. Such compounds follow the law of multiple proportion. An example is the iron oxide wüstite, which can contain between 0.83 and 0.95 iron atoms for every oxygen atom, and thus contain anywhere between 23% and 25% oxygen by mass. The ideal formula is FeO, but it is about Fe0.95O due to crystallographic vacancies. In general, Proust&#x27;s measurements were not precise enough to detect such variations.

In addition, the isotopic composition of an element can vary depending on its source, hence its contribution to the mass of even a pure stoichiometric compound may vary. This variation is used in radiometric dating since astronomical, atmospheric, oceanic, crustal and deep Earth processes may concentrate some environmental isotopes preferentially. With the exception of hydrogen and its isotopes, the effect is usually small, but is measurable with modern-day instrumentation.

Many natural polymers vary in composition (for instance DNA, proteins, carbohydrates) even when &quot;pure&quot;. Polymers are generally not considered &quot;pure chemical compounds&quot; except when their molecular weight is uniform (mono-disperse) and their stoichiometry is constant.

<doc id="17982" wikidata="Q270710" url="?curid=17982" title="Limbo">
<text>In Catholic theology, Limbo (, or , referring to the edge of Hell) is the afterlife condition of those who die in original sin without being assigned to the Hell of the Damned. However, it has become the general term to refer to nothing between time and space in general. Medieval theologians of Western Europe described the underworld (&quot;hell&quot;, &quot;hades&quot;, &quot;infernum&quot;) as divided into three distinct parts: Hell of the Damned, Limbo of the Fathers or Patriarchs, and Limbo of the Infants. The Limbo of the Fathers is an official doctrine of the Catholic Church, but the Limbo of the Infants is not. The concept of Limbo comes from the idea that, in the case of Limbo of the Fathers, good people were not able to achieve heaven just because they were born before the birth of Jesus Christ. This is also true for Limbo of the Infants in that simply because a child died before baptism, does not mean they deserve punishment, though they cannot achieve salvation.

==Limbo of the Patriarchs==
The &quot;Limbo of the Patriarchs&quot; or &quot;Limbo of the Fathers&quot; (Latin ) is seen as the temporary state of those who, despite the sins they may have committed, died in the friendship of God but could not enter heaven until redemption by Jesus Christ made it possible. The term &quot;Limbo of the Fathers&quot; was a medieval name for the part of the underworld (Hades) where the patriarchs of the Old Testament were believed to be kept until Christ&#x27;s soul descended into it by his death through crucifixion and freed them. The Catechism of the Catholic Church describes Christ&#x27;s descent into Hell as meaning primarily that &quot;the crucified one sojourned in the realm of the dead prior to his resurrection. This was the first meaning given in the apostolic preaching to Christ&#x27;s descent into Hell: that Jesus, like all men, experienced death and in his soul joined the others in the realm of the dead.&quot; It adds: &quot;But he descended there as Saviour, proclaiming the Good News to the spirits imprisoned there.&quot; It does not use the word &quot;Limbo&quot;.

This concept of Limbo affirms that admittance to heaven is possible only through the intervention of Jesus Christ, but does not portray Moses, etc. as being punished eternally in Hell. The concept of Limbo of the Patriarchs is not spelled out in Scripture, but is seen by some as implicit in various references:

* Luke 16:22 speaks of the &quot;bosom of Abraham&quot;, which both the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, following early Christian writers, understand as a temporary state of souls awaiting entrance into heaven. The end of that state is set either at the Resurrection of the Dead, the most common interpretation in the East, or at the Harrowing of Hell, the most common interpretation in the West, but adopted also by some in the East.
* Jesus told the Good Thief that the two of them would be together &quot;this day&quot; in Paradise (Luke 23:43; see also Matthew 27:38); but on the Sunday of his resurrection he said that he had &quot;not yet ascended to the Father&quot; (John 20:17). At least one Medieval devotional source and a course of Catholic religious instruction dating to or before the early 1900s posit the view that the descent of Jesus Christ to the abode of the dead, his presence among them, turned it into a paradise. It is also possible that the intended text was not &quot;I say to you, This day you will be with me in paradise&quot;, but &quot;I say to you this day, You will be with me in paradise&quot;. Timothy Radcliffe explained the &quot;today&quot; as a reference to the &quot;Today of eternity&quot;.
* Jesus is also described as preaching to &quot;the spirits in prison&quot; (1 Peter 3:19). Medieval drama sometimes portrayed Christ leading a dramatic assault – the Harrowing of Hell – during the three days between the Crucifixion and the resurrection. In this assault, Jesus freed the souls of the just and escorted them triumphantly into heaven. This imagery is still used in the Eastern Orthodox Church&#x27;s Holy Saturday liturgy (between Good Friday and Pascha) and in Eastern Orthodox icons of the Resurrection of Jesus.
* The doctrine expressed by the term &quot;Limbo of the Fathers&quot; was taught, for instance, by Clement of Alexandria (), who maintained: &quot;It is not right that these should be condemned without trial, and that those alone who lived after the coming [of Christ] should have the advantage of the divine righteousness.&quot;

==Limbo of Infants==

The Limbo of Infants (Latin or ) is the hypothetical permanent status of the unbaptised who die in infancy, too young to have committed actual sins, but not having been freed from original sin. Recent Catholic theological speculation tends to stress the hope, although not the certainty, that these infants may attain heaven instead of the state of Limbo. Many Catholic priests and prelates say that the souls of unbaptized children must simply be &quot;entrusted to the mercy of God&quot;, and whatever their status is cannot be known.

While the Catholic Church has a defined doctrine on original sin, it has none on the eternal fate of unbaptised infants, leaving theologians free to propose different theories, which magisterium is free to accept or reject. Nonetheless, according to Catholic dogma, baptism, or at least the desire for it, along with supernatural faith or at least the &quot;habit of faith&quot;, are necessary for salvation. Hence, it is not immediately clear how to reconcile the mercy of God for unbaptized infants with the necessity of baptism and Catholic faith for salvation. Several theories have been proposed. Limbo is one such theory, although the word &quot;limbo&quot; itself is never mentioned in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Nonetheless, the theory of limbo has weighty support in the traditional teaching of the Doctors of the Church, such as Saint Thomas Aquinas, Saint Augustine, and Saint Alphonsus Liguori.

===Latin Fathers===
In countering Pelagius, who denied original sin, Saint Augustine of Hippo was led to state that because of original sin, &quot;such infants as quit the body without being baptized will be involved in the mildest condemnation of all. That person, therefore, greatly deceives both himself and others, who teaches that they will not be involved in condemnation; whereas the apostle says: &#x27;Judgment from one offence to condemnation&#x27; (Romans 5:16), and again a little after: &#x27;By the offence of one upon all persons to condemnation&#x27;.&quot;

In 418, the Council of Carthage, a synod of North African bishops which included Augustine of Hippo, did not explicitly endorse all aspects of Augustine&#x27;s stern view about the destiny of infants who die without baptism, but stated in some manuscripts &quot;that there is no intermediate or other happy dwelling place for children who have left this life without Baptism, without which they cannot enter the kingdom of heaven, that is, eternal life&quot;. So great was Augustine&#x27;s influence in the West, however, that the Latin Fathers of the 5th and 6th centuries (e.g., Jerome, Avitus of Vienne, and Gregory the Great) did adopt his position.

===Medieval theologians===
In the later Medieval period, some theologians continued to hold Augustine&#x27;s view. In the 12th century, Peter Abelard (1079–1142) said that these infants suffered no material torment or positive punishment, just the pain of loss at being denied the beatific vision. Others held that unbaptised infants suffered no pain at all: unaware of being deprived of the beatific vision, they enjoyed a state of natural, not supernatural happiness. This theory was associated with but independent of the term &quot;Limbo of Infants&quot;, which was coined about the year 1300.

If heaven is a state of supernatural happiness and union with God, and Hell is understood as a state of torture and separation from God then, in this view, the Limbo of Infants, although technically part of hell (the outermost part, &quot;limbo&quot; meaning &#x27;outer edge&#x27; or &#x27;hem&#x27;) is seen as a sort of intermediate state.

The question of Limbo is not treated in the parts of the by Thomas Aquinas, but is dealt with in an appendix to the supplement added after his death compiled from his earlier writings. The Limbo of Infants is there described as an eternal state of natural joy, untempered by any sense of loss at how much greater their joy might have been had they been baptised:

The natural happiness possessed in this place would consist in the perception of God mediated through creatures. As stated in the International Theological Commission&#x27;s document on the question:

===Modern era===
In 1442, the Ecumenical Council of Florence spoke of baptism as necessary even for children, and required that they be baptised soon after birth. This had earlier been affirmed at the Council of Carthage in 418. The Council of Florence also stated that those who die in original sin alone go to Hell, but with pains unequal to those suffered by those who had committed actual mortal sins. John Wycliffe&#x27;s attack on the necessity of infant baptism was condemned by another general council, the Council of Constance. In 1547, the Council of Trent explicitly decreed that baptism (or desire for baptism) was the means by which one is transferred &quot;from that state wherein man is born a child of the first Adam, to the state of grace, and of the adoption of the sons of God, through the second Adam, Jesus Christ, our Saviour. Pope Pius X taught of Limbo&#x27;s existence in his Catechism.

However, throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, individual theologians (Bianchi in 1768, H. Klee in 1835, Caron in 1855, H. Schell in 1893) continued to formulate theories of how children who died unbaptised might still be saved. By 1952 a theologian such as Ludwig Ott could, in a widely used and well-regarded manual, openly teach the possibility that children who die unbaptised might be saved for heaven. He also told about Thomas Cajetan, a major 16th-century theologian, that suggested infants dying in the womb before birth, and so before ordinary sacramental baptism could be administered, might be saved through their mother&#x27;s wish for their baptism. In its 1980 instruction on children&#x27;s baptism the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith stated that &quot;with regard to children who die without having received baptism, the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God, as indeed she does in the funeral rite established for them&quot;, leaving all theories as to their fate, including Limbo, as viable possibilities. In 1984, when Joseph Ratzinger, then Cardinal Prefect of that Congregation, stated that he rejected the claim that children who die unbaptised cannot attain salvation, he was speaking for many academic theologians of his training and background.

The Church&#x27;s teaching, expressed in the 1992 Catechism of the Catholic Church, is that &quot;Baptism is necessary for salvation for those to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed and who have had the possibility of asking for this sacrament&quot;, and that &quot;God has bound salvation to the sacrament of Baptism, but he himself is not bound by his sacraments&quot;. It recalls that, apart from the sacrament, baptism of blood (as in the case of Christian martyrs) and in the case of catechumens who die before receiving the sacrament, explicit desire for baptism, together with Catholic faith, repentance for their sins (specifically perfect contrition, in the case of catechumens) and charity, ensures salvation. It also states that since Christ died for all and all are called to the same divine destiny, &quot;every man who is ignorant of the Gospel of Christ and of his Church, but seeks the truth and does the will of God in accordance with his understanding of it, can be saved&quot;, seeing that, if they had known of the necessity of baptism, they would have desired it explicitly. Additionally, at the Council of Trent and in the Vatican&#x27;s response to Feeneyism in the 1940s, the Church affirmed in every case the necessity of Catholic faith (also called &quot;supernatural faith&quot;), or at least the &quot;habit of faith&quot;, for salvation.

It then states:

Merely stating that one can &quot;hope&quot; in a way of salvation other than baptism, the Church thus urgently reiterates its appeal to baptize infants, the only certain means to &quot;not prevent&quot; their &quot;coming to Christ&quot; for salvation.

On 20 April 2007, the advisory body known as the International Theological Commission released a document, originally commissioned by Pope John Paul II, entitled &quot;The Hope of Salvation for Infants Who Die without Being Baptized.&quot; After tracing the history of the various opinions that have been and are held on the eternal fate of unbaptized infants, including that connected with the theory of the Limbo of Infants, and after examining the theological arguments, the document stated its conclusion as follows:

Pope Benedict XVI authorized publication of this document, indicating that he considers it consistent with the Church&#x27;s teaching, though it is not an official expression of that teaching. Media reports that by the document &quot;the Pope closed Limbo&quot; are thus without foundation. In fact, the document explicitly states that &quot;the theory of &quot;limbo&quot;, understood as a state which includes the souls of infants who die subject to original sin and without baptism, and who, therefore, neither merit the beatific vision, nor yet are subjected to any punishment, because they are not guilty of any personal sin. This theory, elaborated by theologians beginning in the Middle Ages, never entered into the dogmatic definitions of the Magisterium. Still, that same Magisterium did at times mention the theory in its ordinary teaching up until the Second Vatican Council. It remains therefore a possible theological hypothesis&quot; (second preliminary paragraph); and in paragraph 41 it repeats that the theory of Limbo &quot;remains a possible theological opinion&quot;. The document thus allows the hypothesis of a limbo of infants to be held as one of the existing theories about the fate of children who die without being baptised, a question on which there is &quot;no explicit answer&quot; from Scripture or tradition. The traditional theological alternative to Limbo was not heaven, but rather some degree of suffering in Hell. At any rate, these theories are not the official teaching of the Catholic Church, but are only opinions that the Church does not condemn, permitting them to be held by its members, just as is the theory of possible salvation for infants dying without baptism.

==In other denominations and religions==


=== Judaism ===
While Jewish sources are conflicted about what happens to individuals after they die, the concept of limbo does not arise. Furthermore, even the conception of Hell in Judaism is presented as a temporary stage, typically transpiring over a short period of time. According to Talmud, the judgment of the wicked in Gehenna lasts for twelve months. This teaching is attributed to Rabbi Akiva (50-135 AD).

===Christianity===

====Protestant and Eastern Orthodox====

Neither the Eastern Orthodox Church nor Protestantism accepts the concept of a limbo of infants; but, while not using the expression &quot;Limbo of the Patriarchs&quot;, the Eastern Orthodox Church lays much stress on the resurrected Christ&#x27;s action of liberating Adam and Eve and other righteous figures of the Old Testament, such as Abraham and David, from Hades (see Harrowing of Hell).

Some Protestants have a similar understanding of those who died as believers prior to the crucifixion of Jesus residing in a place that is not Heaven, but not Hell. The doctrine holds that Hades has two &quot;compartments&quot;, one an unnamed place of torment, the other named &quot;Abraham&#x27;s bosom&quot;. Luke 16:19–16:26 speaks of a chasm fixed between the two which cannot be crossed. Those in the unnamed &quot;compartment&quot; have no hope, and will ultimately be consigned to hell. Those in Abraham&#x27;s bosom are those of whom it is written of Jesus, &quot;When He ascended on high, He led captive a host of captives&quot; (Ephesians 4:8), quoting Psalm 68:18). These individuals, the captives, now reside with God in Heaven. Both &quot;Compartments&quot; still exist, but Abraham&#x27;s bosom is now empty, while the other chamber is not, according to this doctrine.

====Nontrinitarian====

Latter-day Saints teach that &quot;there is a space between death and the resurrection of the body[...] a state of the soul in happiness or in misery until the time[...] that the dead shall come forth, and be reunited, both soul and body, and be brought to stand before God, and be judged according to their works.&quot; It is also taught that &quot;all who have died without a knowledge of [the] gospel, who would have received it if they had been permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of the celestial kingdom of God.&quot;.

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Christadelphians, and others have taught that the dead are unconscious (or even nonexistent), awaiting their destiny on Judgment Day.

===Zoroastrianism===

The Zoroastrian concept of &quot;hamistagan&quot; is similar to Limbo. Hamistagan is a neutral state in which a soul that was neither good nor evil awaits Judgment Day.

===Islam===
In Islam, which denies the existence of original sin in totality, the concept of Limbo exists as , the state that exists after death, prior to the day of resurrection. During this period, sinners are punished and the adequately purified rest in comfort. Children, however, are exempt from this stage, as they are regarded as innocent and are automatically classed as Muslims (despite religious upbringing). After death, they go directly to Heaven, where they are cared for by Abraham. According to Christian Louis Lange, Islam also possesses a (cf. Q.7:46) &quot;a residual place or limbo&quot; situated between heaven and hell where there is &quot;neither punishment nor reward&quot;.

===Greek mythology===

In Classical Greek mythology, the section of Hades known as the Fields of Asphodel were a realm much resembling Limbo, to which the vast majority of people who were held to have deserved neither the Elysian Fields (Heaven) nor Tartarus (Hell) were consigned for eternity.

===Buddhism===

In Buddhism, &quot;Bardo&quot; (Sanskrit: ) is sometimes described as similar to limbo. It is an intermediate state in which the recently deceased experiences various phenomena before being reborn in another state, including heaven or hell. According to Mahāyāna Buddhism, the arhat must ultimately embrace the path of the bodhisattva, despite having reached enlightenment. The Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra states that an arhat obtains a () and is reborn in a lotus in a transitory state of existence, unable to awaken for a whole eon. This is likened to a person intoxicated who must spend a certain period of time before becoming sober.

<doc id="17983" wikidata="Q161096" url="?curid=17983" title="Lethe">
<text>In Greek mythology, Lethe (; Ancient Greek: &quot;Lḗthē&quot;; , ) was one of the rivers of the underworld of Hades. Also known as the &quot;Amelēs potamos&quot; (river of unmindfulness), the Lethe flowed around the cave of Hypnos and through the Underworld where all those who drank from it experienced complete forgetfulness. The river was often associated with Lethe, the personification of forgetfulness and oblivion, who was the daughter of Eris (Strife).

In Classical Greek, the word &quot;&quot; () literally means &quot;forgetting&quot;, &quot;forgetfulness&quot;.

==Infernal river==
Lethe, the river of forgetfulness, is one of the five rivers of the Greek underworld; the other four are Acheron (the river of sorrow), Cocytus (the river of lamentation), Phlegethon (the river of fire) and Styx (the river that separates Earth and the Underworld). According to Statius, Lethe bordered Elysium, the final resting place of the virtuous. Ovid wrote that the river flowed through the cave of Hypnos, god of sleep, where its murmuring would induce drowsiness.

The shades of the dead were required to drink the waters of the Lethe in order to forget their earthly life. In the &quot;Aeneid&quot; (VI.703-751), Virgil writes that it is only when the dead have had their memories erased by the Lethe that they may be reincarnated.

The river Lethe was said to be located next to Hades&#x27;s palace in the underworld under a cypress tree. Orpheus would give some shades (the Greek term for ghosts or spirits) a password to tell Hades&#x27;s servants which would allow them to drink instead from the Mnemosyne (the pool of memory), which was located under a poplar tree. An Orphic inscription, said to be dated from between the second and third century B.C., warns readers to avoid the Lethe and to seek the Mnemosyne instead. Drinkers of the Lethe&#x27;s water would not be quenched of their thirst, often causing them to drink more than necessary.

==Role in religion and philosophy==
Some ancient Greeks believed that souls were made to drink from the river before being reincarnated, so that they would not remember their past lives. The Myth of Er in Book X of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; tells of the dead arriving at a barren waste called the &quot;plain of Lethe&quot;, through which the river &quot;Ameles&quot; (&quot;careless&quot;) runs. &quot;Of this they were all obliged to drink a certain quantity,&quot; Plato wrote, &quot;and those who were not saved by wisdom drank more than was necessary; and each one as he drank forgot all things.&quot; A few mystery religions taught the existence of another river, the Mnemosyne; those who drank from the Mnemosyne would remember everything and attain omniscience. Initiates were taught that they would receive a choice of rivers to drink from after death, and to drink from Mnemosyne instead of Lethe.

These two rivers are attested in several verse inscriptions on gold plates dating to the 4th century BC and onward, found at Thurii in Southern Italy and elsewhere throughout the Greek world. There were rivers of Lethe and Mnemosyne at the oracular shrine of Trophonius in Boeotia, from which worshippers would drink before making oracular consultations with the god.

More recently, Martin Heidegger used &quot;lēthē&quot; to symbolize not only the &quot;concealment of Being&quot; or &quot;forgetting of Being&quot;, but also the &quot;concealment of concealment&quot;, which he saw as a major problem of modern philosophy. Examples are found in his books on Nietzsche (Vol 1, p. 194) and on Parmenides. Philosophers since, such as William J. Richardson have expanded on this school of thought.

The goddess Lethe has been compared to the goddess Meng Po of Chinese Mythology, who would wait on the Bridge of Forgetfulness to serve dead souls soup which would erase their memories before they were reincarnated.

== Real rivers ==
Amongst authors in antiquity, the tiny Lima river between Norte Region, Portugal, and Galicia, Spain, was said to have the same properties of memory loss as the legendary Lethe River, being mistaken for it. In 138 BCE, the Roman general Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus sought to dispose of the myth, as it impeded his military campaigns in the area. He was said to have personally crossed the Lima, and then called his soldiers from the other side, one by one, by name. The soldiers, astonished that their general remembered their names, crossed the river as well without fear. This act proved that the Lima was not as dangerous as the local myths described.

In Cádiz, Spain, the river Guadalete was originally named &quot;Lethe&quot; by local Greek and Phoenician colonists who, about to go to war, solved instead their differences by diplomacy and named the river Lethe to forever forget their former differences. When the Arabs conquered the region much later, their name for the river became Guadalete from the Arabic phrase &quot;وادي لكة&quot; (Wadi lakath) meaning &quot;River of Forgetfulness&quot;.

In Alaska, a river which runs through the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes is called the River Lethe. It is located within the Katmai National Park and Preserve in southwest Alaska.

== References in literature ==

* In 29 BCE, Virgil wrote about Lethe in his didactic hexameter poem, the &quot;Georgics&quot;. Lethe is also referenced in Virgil&#x27;s epic Latin poem, &quot;Aeneid&quot;, when the title protagonist travels to Lethe to meet the ghost of his father in Book VI of the poem.

* Ovid includes a description of Lethe as a stream that puts people to sleep in his work &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (8 AD)
* In the &quot;Purgatorio&quot;, the second &quot;cantica&quot; of Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, the Lethe is located in the Earthly Paradise atop the Mountain of Purgatory. The piece, written in the early 14th century, tells of Dante&#x27;s immersion in the Lethe so that his memories are wiped of sin (&quot;Purg&quot;. XXXI). The Lethe is also mentioned in the &quot;Inferno&quot;, the first part of the &quot;Comedy&quot;, as flowing down to Hell from Purgatory to be frozen in the ice around Satan, &quot;the last lost vestiges of the sins of the saved&quot; (&quot;Inf.&quot; XXXIV.130). He then proceeds to sip from the waters of the river Eunoe so that the soul may enter heaven full of the strength of his or her life&#x27;s good deeds.
* William Shakespeare references Lethe&#x27;s identity as the &quot;river of forgetfulness&quot; in a speech of the Ghost in Act 1 Scene 5 of &quot;Hamlet&quot;: &quot;and duller should thoust be than the fat weed / That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,&quot; written sometime between 1599 and 1601.
* In John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, written in 1667, his first speech in Satan describes how &quot;The associates and copartners of our loss, Lie thus astonished on &quot;the oblivious pool&quot;&quot;, referencing Lethe.
*The English poet John Keats references the river in poems &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; and &quot;Ode on Melancholy&quot; written in 1819.
* In Faust, Part Two, the titular character, Faust, is bathed &quot;in the dew of Lethe&quot; so that he would forget what happened in Faust, Part One. A remorseful Faust would not work well with the rest of Part 2. The forgetting powers of Lethe allowed him to forget the ending of the Gretchen drama and move on to the story of part 2.
* The French poet Charles Baudelaire referred to the river in his poem &quot;Spleen&quot;, published posthumously in 1869. The final line is &quot;Où coule au lieu de sang l&#x27;eau verte du Léthé&quot; which one translator renders as &quot;... in whose veins flows the green water of Lethe ...&quot; (the reference offers a few more English translations). Baudelaire also wrote a poem called &quot;Lethe&quot;.

<doc id="17988" wikidata="Q218960" url="?curid=17988" title="Laurence Sterne">
<text>Laurence Sterne (24 November 1713 – 18 March 1768) was an Anglo-Irish novelist and Anglican cleric. He is best known for his comic novels &quot;The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman&quot; (1759–1767) and &quot;A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy&quot; (1768). 

Sterne grew up in a military family, travelling mainly in Ireland but briefly in England. He attended Jesus College, Cambridge on a sizarship, gaining bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees, and was ordained as a priest in 1738. While Vicar of Sutton-on-the-Forest, Yorkshire, he married Elizabeth Lumley in 1741. He briefly wrote political propaganda for the Whigs, but abandoned politics in 1742. In 1759, he wrote an ecclesiastical satire &quot;A Political Romance&quot;, which embarrassed the church and was burned. Having discovered his talent for comedy, at age 46 he dedicated himself to humour writing as a vocation. Also in 1759, he published the first volume of &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;, which was an enormous success. He was a literary celebrity for the rest of his life. In addition to his novels, he published several volumes of sermons. Sterne died in 1768 and was buried in the yard of St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Laurence Sterne was born in Clonmel, County Tipperary, on 24 November 1713. His father, Roger Sterne, was an ensign in a British regiment recently returned from Dunkirk. Roger&#x27;s social standing was far lower than that of his recent ancestors: Roger&#x27;s grandfather Richard Sterne had been the archbishop of York. Roger was the second son of Richard&#x27;s second son, and consequently, Roger inherited little of the familial wealth. Roger left his family to join the army at the age of 25; he enlisted uncommissioned, which was unusual for someone from a family of high social position. Roger married Agnes Herbert Nuttall, the widow of a military captain, in 1711. Laurence was the second of their seven children, one of only three to survive to adulthood.

The first decade of Laurence Sterne&#x27;s life was impoverished and unsettled. After his birth, the family spent six months in Clonmel, then ten months at Roger&#x27;s mother&#x27;s estate in Elvington, North Yorkshire while Roger had no army posting. From 1715 to 1723, the Sternes moved repeatedly (about once a year) between poor family lodgings in army barracks in Britain and Ireland, with brief ownership of a townhouse in Dublin during a particularly prosperous stint from 1717 to 1719. These postings included three separate moves to Dublin, at other times living in Plymouth, the Isle of Wight, Wicklow, Annamoe, and Carrickfergus. In 1723, at the age of ten, Sterne was relocated to his uncle&#x27;s household in Halifax, on the condition that he would repay his uncle for the cost of his upkeep and education. This arrangement reflected both the poor financial resources of Sterne&#x27;s father, and the strained relationship he had with his wealthier family members. Sterne never saw his father again, as Roger was next ordered to Jamaica where he died of malaria in 1731.

===Education and ecclesiastical career===
Sterne attended boarding school at Hipperholme Grammar School in Yorkshire, near his uncle&#x27;s estate. There, he received a traditional classical education. In July 1733, at the age of twenty, he was admitted to Jesus College, Oxford with a sizarship that allowed him to afford attendance. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in January 1737. Sterne was ordained as a deacon on 6 March 1737 and as a priest on 20 August 1738. He returned to Oxford in the summer of 1740 to be awarded his Master of Arts. His religion is said to have been the &quot;centrist Anglicanism of his time&quot;, known as latitudinarianism. A few days after his ordination as a priest, Sterne was awarded the vicarage living of Sutton-on-the-Forest in Yorkshire. 

Sterne married Elizabeth Lumley on 30 March 1741, despite both being ill with consumption. Only one of their several children survived infancy, a daughter named Lydia. Throughout their marriage, Sterne had adulterous affairs, and developed &quot;an unsavoury but deserved reputation as a libertine&quot;.

In 1743, he was presented to the neighbouring living of Stillington by Reverend Richard Levett, prebendary of Stillington, who was patron of the living. Subsequently, Sterne did duty both there and at Sutton. Sterne lived in Sutton for 20 years, during which time he continued a close friendship that had begun at Cambridge with John Hall-Stevenson, a witty and accomplished &quot;bon vivant&quot;, owner of Skelton Hall in the Cleveland district of Yorkshire.

Sterne&#x27;s life at this time was closely tied with his uncle, Jaques Sterne, the archdeacon of Cleveland and precentor of York Minster. Sterne&#x27;s uncle was an ardent Whig, and urged Sterne to begin a career of political journalism. Sterne wrote anonymous propaganda in the &quot;York Gazetteer&quot; from 1741 to 1742. Sterne&#x27;s published attacks on the Tory party earned him career favours from the church (including a prebendary of York Minster), but also harsh personal criticism. Sterne abruptly abandoned his political writing, leading to a permanent falling-out with his uncle, and stalling his ecclesiastical career.

In 1744, Sterne purchased several pieces of farmland in Sutton, with the hope that raising crops and dairy cattle would supplement his household&#x27;s foodstores and finances. However, the farm was not particularly successful. In 1758, Sterne gave up directly farming the land, and leased the property out.

===Writing===

In 1759, Sterne contributed to a pamphlet war related to complex church politics and Sterne&#x27;s patron John Fountayne. Fountayne and a rival published a series of open letters criticizing each other, which spurred several replies from their acquaintance. Sterne published &quot;A Political Romance; or, The History of a Good Warm Watch-Coat&quot; in January 1759, a satirical work with unflattering caricatures of Fountayne&#x27;s critics. Unusually for a pamphlet, Sterne explicitly attached his name to the work. The Archbishop of York was embarrassed by how public the church&#x27;s internal disputes had become, and ordered all 500 copies of &quot;A Political Romance&quot; burned. Sterne complied, but a handful of copies accidentally survived from other owners.

Despite its lack of success, &quot;A Political Romance&quot; was a turning point for Sterne. He later wrote that, before finishing it, &quot;he hardly knew he could write at all, much less with humour, so as to make his reader laugh.&quot; At the age of 46, Sterne dedicated himself to writing for the rest of his life. It was while living in the countryside, failing in his attempts to supplement his income as a farmer and struggling with tuberculosis, that Sterne began work on his best-known novel, &quot;The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman&quot;, the first volumes of which were published in 1759. Sterne was at work on his celebrated comic novel during the year that his mother died, his wife was seriously ill, and his daughter was also taken ill with a fever. He wrote as fast as he possibly could, composing the first 18 chapters between January and March 1759. Sterne borrowed money for the printing of his novel, suggesting that he was confident in the prospective commercial success of his work.

The publication of &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; made Sterne famous in London and on the continent. He was delighted by the attention, famously saying, &quot;I wrote not [to] be &quot;fed&quot; but to be &quot;famous&quot;.&quot; He spent part of each year in London, being fêted as new volumes appeared. As Sterne assiduously promoted his book, some of the attention he received was scandal: at the time, it was slightly disreputable for any gentleman to write for financial gain; for a clergyman to appear motivated by money, and to use &quot;indecent&quot; humour to pursue it, was doubly questionable. Sterne&#x27;s bawdiness was criticized in a series of 1760s pamphlets, and he was encouraged to &quot;mend his style&quot; by the Bishop of Gloucester. Even after the publication of volumes three and four of &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;, Sterne&#x27;s love of attention (especially as related to financial success) remained undiminished. In one letter, he wrote, &quot;One half of the town abuse my book as bitterly, as the other half cry it up to the skies — the best is, they abuse it and buy it, and at such a rate, that we are going on with a second edition, as fast as possible.&quot; Baron Fauconberg rewarded Sterne by appointing him as the perpetual curate of Coxwold in the North Riding of Yorkshire in March 1760.

In 1766, in the early days of British debates about slavery, the composer and former slave Ignatius Sancho wrote to Sterne, encouraging him to use his pen to lobby for the abolition of the slave trade. Sterne wrote back to say that he had just written a scene sympathizing with the oppression of a black servant, which appeared in the next published volume of &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;. Sterne&#x27;s widely publicised response to Sancho&#x27;s letter became an integral part of 18th-century abolitionist literature.

===Foreign travel===
Struggling again with his ill health, Sterne departed England for France in 1762 in an effort to find a climate that would alleviate his suffering. Sterne attached himself to a diplomatic party bound for Turin, as England and France were still adversaries in the Seven Years&#x27; War. Sterne was gratified by his reception in France, where reports of the genius of &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; made him a celebrity. He stayed in France until 1764, followed by a trip through France and Italy from 1765 to 1766. Aspects of his experiences abroad were incorporated into Sterne&#x27;s second novel, &quot;A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy&quot;.

===Eliza===
Early in 1767, Sterne met Eliza Draper, the wife of an official of the East India Company, while she was staying on her own in London. He was captivated by Eliza&#x27;s charm and vivacity, and they began a mutual flirtation. They met frequently and exchanged miniature portraits. Sterne&#x27;s admiration turned into an obsession, which he took no trouble to conceal. To his great distress, Eliza had to return to India three months after their first meeting, and he died a year later without seeing her again. In 1768, Sterne published his &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot;, which contains some extravagant references to her; and their relationship aroused considerable interest. He also wrote his &quot;Journal to Eliza&quot;, part of which he sent to her, and the rest of which came to light when it was presented to the British Museum in 1894. After Sterne&#x27;s death, Eliza allowed ten of his letters to be published under the title &quot;Letters from Yorick to Eliza&quot; and succeeded in suppressing her letters to him, though some blatant forgeries were produced in a volume of &quot;Eliza&#x27;s Letters to Yorick&quot;.

=== Death ===

Less than a month after &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot; was published, Sterne died in his lodgings at 41 Old Bond Street on 18 March 1768, at the age of 54. He was buried in the churchyard of St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square on 22 March. 

It was rumoured that Sterne&#x27;s body was stolen shortly after it was interred and sold to anatomists at Cambridge University. Circumstantially, it was said that his body was recognised by Charles Collignon, who knew him and discreetly reinterred him back in St George&#x27;s, in an unknown plot. A year later a group of Freemasons erected a memorial stone with a rhyming epitaph near to his original burial place. A second stone was erected in 1893, correcting some factual errors on the memorial stone. When the churchyard of St. George&#x27;s was redeveloped in 1969, amongst 11,500 skulls disinterred, several were identified with drastic cuts from anatomising or a post-mortem examination. One was identified to be of a size that matched a bust of Sterne made by Nollekens. The skull was held up to be his, albeit with &quot;a certain area of doubt&quot;. Along with nearby skeletal bones, these remains were transferred to Coxwold churchyard in 1969 by the Laurence Sterne Trust. The story of the reinterment of Sterne&#x27;s skull in Coxwold is alluded to in Malcolm Bradbury&#x27;s novel &quot;To the Hermitage&quot;.

== Works ==

The works of Laurence Sterne are few in comparison to other eighteenth-century authors of comparable stature. Sterne&#x27;s early works were letters; he had two sermons published (in 1747 and 1750) and tried his hand at satire. He was involved in and wrote about local politics in 1742. His major publication prior to &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; was the satire &quot;A Political Romance&quot; (1759), aimed at conflicts of interest within York Minster. A posthumously published piece on the art of preaching, &quot;A Fragment in the Manner of Rabelais&quot;, appears to have been written in 1759. Rabelais was by far Sterne&#x27;s favourite author, and in his correspondence, he made clear that he considered himself as Rabelais&#x27; successor in humour writing, distancing himself from Jonathan Swift.

Sterne&#x27;s novel &quot;The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman&quot; sold widely in England and throughout Europe. Translations of the work began to appear in all the major European languages almost immediately upon its publication. The novel itself starts with the narration, by Tristram, of his own conception. It proceeds mostly by what Sterne calls &quot;progressive digressions&quot; so that we do not reach Tristram&#x27;s birth before the third volume. The novel is rich in characters and humour, and the influences of Rabelais and Miguel de Cervantes are present throughout. The novel ends after 9 volumes, published over a decade, but without anything that might be considered a traditional conclusion. Sterne inserts sermons, essays and legal documents into the pages of his novel; and he explores the limits of typography and print design by including marbled pages and an entirely black page within the narrative.

English writer and literary critic Samuel Johnson&#x27;s verdict in 1776 was that &quot;Nothing odd will do long. &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; did not last.&quot; This is strikingly different from the views of continental European critics of the day, who praised Sterne and &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; as innovative and superior. Voltaire called it &quot;clearly superior to Rabelais&quot;, and later Goethe praised Sterne as &quot;the most beautiful spirit that ever lived&quot;. Swedish translator Johan Rundahl described Sterne as an arch-sentimentalist. Sterne influenced European writers as diverse as Denis Diderot and the German Romanticists. His work also had noticeable influence over Brazilian author Machado de Assis, who made use of the digressive technique in the novel &quot;The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas&quot;. The Russian Formalist writer Viktor Shklovsky regarded &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; as the archetypal, quintessential novel, &quot;the most typical novel of world literature.&quot; Many of the innovations that Sterne introduced, adaptations in form that were an exploration of what constitutes the novel, were highly influential to Modernist writers like James Joyce and Virginia Woolf, and more recent writers such as Thomas Pynchon and David Foster Wallace. Italo Calvino referred to &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; as the &quot;undoubted progenitor of all avant-garde novels of our century&quot;. More recently, scholarly opinions of &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; include those who minimize its significance as an innovation. Since the 1950s, following the lead of D. W. Jefferson, there are those who argue that, whatever its legacy of influence may be, &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; in its original context actually represents a resurgence of a much older, Renaissance tradition of &quot;Learned Wit&quot; – owing a debt to such influences as the Scriblerian approach. 

Sterne&#x27;s final novel, &quot;A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy&quot;, has many stylistic parallels with &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;, and the narrator is one of the minor characters from the earlier novel. At its first publication, &quot;A Sentimental Journey&quot; was warmly received by readers who saw it as more sentimental and less bawdy than &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;. From Sterne&#x27;s death through the nineteenth century, &quot;A Sentimental Journey&quot; was considered Sterne&#x27;s best and most beloved work, and it was more widely reprinted than &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;. Today, &quot;A Sentimental Journey&quot; is often interpreted by critics as part of the same artistic project to which &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; belongs. In addition to his fiction, two volumes of Sterne&#x27;s &quot;Sermons&quot; were published during his lifetime; more copies of his &quot;Sermons&quot; were sold in his lifetime than copies of &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;. In the years after Sterne&#x27;s death, his family published additional sermons, as well as letter collections of his correspondence.

<doc id="17989" wikidata="Q30972" url="?curid=17989" title="Linear A">
<text>Linear A is a writing system that was used by the Minoans of Crete from 1800 BC to 1450 BC. Linear A was the primary script used in palace and religious writings of the Minoan civilization. It evolved into Linear B, which was used by the Mycenaeans to write an early form of Greek. It was discovered by the archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans in 1900. No texts in Linear A have yet been deciphered. Evans named the script &quot;Linear&quot; because its characters consisted simply of lines inscribed in clay, in contrast to the more pictographic characters in Cretan hieroglyphs that were used during the same period.

Linear A belongs to a group of scripts that evolved independently of the Egyptian and Mesopotamian systems. During the second millennium BC, there were four major branches: Linear A, Linear B, Cypro-Minoan, and Cretan hieroglyphic. In the 1950s, Linear B was deciphered and found to have an underlying language of Mycenaean Greek. Linear A shares many glyphs and alloglyphs with Linear B, and the syllabic glyphs are thought to notate similar syllabic values, but none of the proposed readings lead to a language that scholars can read.

==Script==
Linear A consists of over 300 signs including regional variants and hapax legomena. Among these, a core group of 90 occur with some frequency throughout the script&#x27;s geographic and chronological extent.

As a logosyllabic writing system, Linear A includes signs which stand for syllables as well as others standing for words or concepts. Linear A&#x27;s signs could be combined via ligature to form complex signs. Complex signs usually behave as ideograms and most are hapax legomena, occurring only once in the surviving corpus. Thus, Linear A signs are divided into four categories:
# syllabic signs
# ligatures and composite signs
# ideograms
# numerals and metrical signs

Linear A was usually written left-to-right, but a handful of documents were written right-to-left or boustrophedon.

=== Signary ===
=== Special signs ===
Furthermore, the following ‘supplementary’ syllabograms for more complex syllables can be identified (where in some cases the exact pronunciation is or used to be unknown even for Linear B, hence the use of subscript numbers):
=== Ideograms ===
The following list contains some frequent ideograms/logograms whose meaning is known and uncontroversial and almost all of which are preserved in Linear B. The meaning of many others is debated. Note that some of the ideograms are also used as syllabograms; in such cases, the sound value is indicated in the table before the Bennett number.

These numerals follow a decimal system: units are represented by vertical dashes, tens by horizontal dashes, hundreds by circles, and thousands by circles with rays. There are special symbols to indicate fractions and weights. Specific signs that coincide with numerals are regarded as fractions; these sign combinations are known as &quot;klasmatograms&quot;.

Integers can be read and the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are quite straightforward, similarly to Roman numerals.

=== Fractions ===
There is a lack of scholarly agreement about signs, generally called klasmatograms, for Linear A fractions. In 2021 Corazza et al. proposed the following values, most of which had been previously suggested:

Other fractions are composed by addition: the common JE and DD are and (), BB = , EF = , etc. (and indeed B looks like it might derive from KK ). L, Y, and Ω are hapax legomena (only occur once) and it has been proposed that glyph L is spurious.

Several of these values are supported by Linear B. Although Linear B used a different numbering system, several of the Linear A fractions were adopted as fractional units of measurement. For example, Linear B DD and (presumably AA) are and of a &quot;lana&quot;, while K is of the main unit for dry weight.

==Corpus==

Linear A has been found chiefly on Crete, but also at other sites in Greece, as well as Turkey and Israel. The extant corpus, comprising some 1,427 specimens totals 7,362 to 7,396 signs. Linear A has been written on various media, such as stone offering tables and vessels, gold and silver hairpins, roundels, and ceramics. The earliest inscriptions of Linear A come from Phaistos, in a layer dated at the end of the Middle Minoan II period: that is, no later than c. 1700 BC. Linear A texts have been found throughout the island of Crete and also on some Aegean islands (Kythera, Kea, Thera, Melos), in mainland Greece (Ayos Stephanos), on the west coast of Asia Minor (Miletus, Troy), and in the Levant (Tel Haror, Tel Lachish).

The first comprehensive compendium of Linear A inscriptions (sometimes referred to as GORILA) was produced by Louis Godart and Jean-Pierre Olivier in multiple columns between 1976 and 1985. In 2011 work began on a supplement to that compendium. In 2020 a project was begun, called SigLA, to put all the known Linear A inscriptions online at a single site.

===Tablets===

Essentially all Linear A tablets, most in a fragmentary condition, have been found on the island of Crete, dated to the Neopalatial Period. At that time Crete was divided by mountains and other geographic features into a number of polities, each with its own urban center. These tablets have been found at Hagia Triada (147 tablets), Petras, Phaistos (26 tablets), Knossos (6 tablets), Petsophas, Archanes (7 tablets), Myrtos Pyrgos (2 tablets), Zakros (31 tablets), Tylissos (2 tablets), Malia (6 tablets), Gournia (1 tablet), and Khania (99 tablets). One Linear A tablet was found on Kea in the Cyclades. Three tablet fragments were found on the island of Santorini (Thera). The handful of known Cretan Hieroglyphs tablets (with relatively few signs) were also found on Crete at Malia and Kato Symi.

===Sealed documents===

Seals and clay sealings served the same role of inventory control and ownership as in the ancient Near East and Egypt. Large numbers of sealings have been found, primarily on Crete and in the Late Minoan IB period. The primary sources of sealed documents come from Haghia Triada (1103), Zakros (560), Khania (210), Knossos (125), Phaistos (35), Malia (6), and Tylissos (5). It is not clear what was commonly used to impress the sealing as only a few Linear A inscribed &quot;seal stones&quot; have been found. In other regions cylinder seals and stamp seals fulfilled this role.

Sealed documents are divided by archaeologists into four classes:
*Roundels – disks of clay with sealing on the edges
*Hanging nodules – sealed lumps of clay originally attached to string
*Parcel nodules – lumps of clay with sealing on back
*Noduli – clay lumps like hanging nodules but not formerly string attached

===Libation tables===
A group of Minoan finds, usually from sanctuaries, have traditionally been called libation tables. They come in full sized and miniature versions, usually of stone. Because of the findspots, at cultic sites like Mount Juktas, they are usually assumed to be religious in nature though that is not certain. So far about 1000 libation tables have been recovered at 27 different sites on Crete, of which 41 have Linear A inscriptions. These inscriptions follow a standardized &quot;libation formula&quot;, a formula also found on a few other objects, primarily vessels.

The &quot;libation formula&quot; has been much studied. A similar construct in Cretan Hieroglyphs, the &quot;Archanes Formula&quot;, is the main proposed link to Linear A.

===Other sources===

While most of the recovered Linear A signs have come from tablets, libation tables and related ritual objects, and sealed documents, a number of very short Linear A inscriptions have been found in the Minoan area of operation, primarily in the form of potmarks and mason&#x27;s marks. A problem is that it can be difficult to tell if a single-sign (or even doubleton) is Linear A, Linear B, or Cretan Hieroglyphs because of the overlap in sign use. Vessel sherds were found at Traostalos, bearing three signs in total. Four vase sherds were found at Thera with signs, as well as a ostrakon with one sign. A vessel fragment was found at Miletus. Two pithoi with very fragmentary inscriptions were found at Pseira. Graffiti has been found at places like Hagia Triada. A small clay ball with three Linear A signs was found at Mikro Vouni on the island of Samothrace. A small stone tab with two signs was excavated in Hagios Stephanos, Laconia. A silver hair pin and a gold ring, both with fairly long Linear A inscriptions, were found at Mavro Spelio in Knossos.

A Linear A inscription was said to have been found in southeast Bulgaria. Another, somewhat more solid, find was at Tel Lachish. A Minoan graffito found at Tel Haror on a vessel fragment is either Linear A or Cretan hieroglyphs.

Several tablets inscribed in signs similar to Linear A were found at Troy in northwestern Anatolia. While their status is disputed, they may be imports, as there is no evidence of Minoan presence in the Troad. Classification of these signs as a unique Trojan script (proposed by contemporary Russian linguist Nikolai Kazansky) is not accepted by other linguists. Two Linear A inscribed clay spindle whorls were also found at Troy.

==Chronology==

The earliest attestation of Linear A begins around 1800 BC (Middle Minoan IB) during the Protopalatial period. It became prominent around 1625 BC (Middle Minoan IIIB) and went out of use around 1450 BC (Late Minoan I) during the Neopalatial period. It was contemporary with and possibly derived from Cretan hieroglyphs, and may be an ancestor of Linear B. The Cypro-Minoan syllabary, used between Cyprus and its trading partners around the Mediterranean, was also in use during this period. The sequence and the geographical spread of Cretan hieroglyphs, Linear A, and Linear B, the three overlapping but distinct writing systems on Bronze Age Crete and the Greek mainland, can be summarized as follows:

==Decipherment==
Linear A has not been fully deciphered. However, researchers are reasonably confident in the approximate sound values of most syllabic signs and are able to make inferences about the meanings of some texts.

=== Challenges to decipherment ===

One major barrier to its decipherment is the limited surviving corpus. Only around 1400 Linear A inscriptions survive, in contrast to the 6000 available for Linear B. As a result, researchers are stuck with limited sample sizes, making it difficult to reliably detect patterns. Similarly, Linear A inscriptions are often fragmentary, damaged, or otherwise hard to read. It can be difficult to individuate particular signs and to distinguish separate signs from handwriting variants. Finally, Linear A inscriptions tend to be brief and repetitive. Rather than complete sentences, many are lists where each entry consists of a toponym or personal name followed by a logogram and then a numeral. Thus, the surviving corpus contains few spelled-out words and limited evidence of the grammatical structure.

A second barrier is the scarcity of external evidence. No bilingual inscriptions have been found, preventing the script from being deciphered in the manner that Egyptian hieroglyphs were deciphered using the Rosetta Stone. The underlying language of Linear A has not been determined, and it is not clear that the same language was used for its entire period of use. The grammatical evidence that can be gleaned from the surviving corpus suggests that it was not a close relative of any known language.

=== Phonetic values ===

For most of Linear A&#x27;s syllabic signs, approximate sound values can be inferred based on the values of homomorphic signs in Linear B. These sound values are widely accepted by current researchers, though they are not considered incontrovertible and many details remain up for debate. This does not amount to a complete decipherment since it results in words that are uninterpretable.

These values are based on the &quot;homomorphy-homophony principle&quot; which states that in related writing systems, signs with similar forms will generally have similar phonetic values. Although this principle is not reliable across the board, there are a number of strong reasons why scholars have concluded that it does generally hold in Linear A. One reason is that is already known to hold in many cases between Linear B and the Cypriot syllabary, another script which descends from Linear A. This fact suggests that these signs were inherited by both scripts along with their Linear A phonetic values. A second reason is that the resulting Linear A sound values provide readings of words which match what contextual analysis would lead us to expect. For instance, words which contextual analysis suggests to be placenames are read as such when assuming Linear B values. Notably, the Linear A word would be read as , corresponding to the placename Phaistos attested in the Linear B corpus as .

However, in particular cases scholars have identified reasons to expect divergence in pronunciation. Some scholars have argued that Minoan did not really have a vowel phoneme /o/, that it may not have had the labialised velars that the &quot;q&quot;-signs express in Mycenaean, and that the only apparent voiced stop, &quot;d&quot;, was really a dental fricative in Minoan.

The following table shows signs that are known to be syllabograms and for which &quot;provisional&quot; and &quot;approximate&quot; sound values are assumed primarily based on the known pronunciations of identical or similar signs in Linear B.

While many of those assumed to be syllabic signs are similar to ones in Linear B, approximately 80% of Linear A&#x27;s logograms are unique; the difference in sound values between Linear A and Linear B signs ranges from 9% to 13%.

===Underlying language===
Linear A does not appear to encode any known language. The placeholder term &quot;Minoan language&quot; is often used, though it is not certain that the texts are all in the same language. Minoan appears to be agglutinative, making copious use of prefixes and suffixes. It likely had a three vowel system, since it shares Linear B&#x27;s //, //, and // series, but not Linear B&#x27;s // series and not all of its // series. Based on regularities in the Linear A Libation Formulas, it has been argued that its word order was Verb Subject Object.
Scholars have noted a number of potential parallels between Minoan and Anatolian languages such as Luwian and Lycian, as well as with Semitic languages such as Phoenician and Ugaritic. However, even if these connections are not coincidental, it is unclear whether Minoan is related to one of these languages or if the parallels arose through language contact.

==Unicode==

The Linear A alphabet (U+10600–U+1077F) was added to the Unicode Standard in June 2014 with the release of version 7.0. Current as of the latest Unicode version, 15.1.

<text>Lucasfilm Games (known as LucasArts between 1990 and 2021) is an American video game licensor, former video game developer and publisher, and a subsidiary of Lucasfilm. It was founded in May 1982 by George Lucas as a video game development group alongside his film company; as part of a larger 1990 reorganization of the Lucasfilm divisions, the video game development division was grouped and rebranded as part of LucasArts. LucasArts became known for its line of adventure games based on its SCUMM engine in the 1990s, including &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;, the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series, and several &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; titles. A number of influential game developers were alumni of LucasArts from this period, including Brian Moriarty, Tim Schafer, Ron Gilbert, and Dave Grossman. Later, as Lucasfilm regained control over its licensing over the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, LucasArts produced numerous action-based &quot;Star Wars&quot; titles in the late 1990s and early 2000s, while dropping adventure game development due to waning interest in the genre.

Lucasfilm was wholly acquired by The Walt Disney Company in December 2012, and by April 2013, Disney had announced the shuttering of LucasArts in all but name, keeping the division around to handle licensing of Lucasfilm properties to third-party developers, primarily Electronic Arts, and having any in-house development transferred to Disney Interactive Studios. Disney has, since 2021, revitalized the Lucasfilm Games brand as the licenser of all Lucasfilm-related properties.

In 1979, George Lucas wanted to explore other areas of entertainment and created the Lucasfilm Computer Division in 1979, which included a department for computer games (the Games Group) and another for graphics. The graphics department was spun off into its own corporation in 1982, ultimately becoming Pixar.

The Lucasfilm Games Group originally cooperated with Atari, Inc., which helped fund the video game group&#x27;s founding, to produce video games. Though the group had spun out of Lucasfilm, the video game development license for Lucasfilm&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; was held by Atari at the time, forcing the group to start with original concepts; Ron Gilbert, one of the group&#x27;s first employees, believed that if the Lucasfilm Games Group had the rights for &quot;Star Wars&quot; from the start, they would have never branched into any new intellectual property.

The first products from the Games Group were &quot;Ballblazer&quot; and &quot;Rescue on Fractalus!&quot;, developed in 1984 for the Atari 5200 console and Atari 8-bit computers. Beta versions of both games were leaked to pirate bulletin boards exactly one week after Atari had received unprotected copies for a marketing review, and were in wide circulation over a year before the original release date. Planned to be released in the 3rd quarter of 1984 under the Atari/Lucasfilm label, the games were delayed when Warner Communications sold the assets of the consumer division of Atari, Inc. to Jack Tramiel in July of that year, and were ultimately picked up by publisher Epyx and released by May 1985. Lucasfilm&#x27;s next two games were &quot;Koronis Rift&quot; and &quot;The Eidolon&quot;. Their first games were only developed by Lucasfilm, and a publisher would distribute the games. Atari published their games for Atari systems, Activision and Epyx would do their computer publishing. &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; was the first game to be published and developed by Lucasfilm Games.

The early charter of Lucasfilm Games was to make experimental, innovative, and technologically advanced video games. &quot;Habitat&quot;, an early online role-playing game and one of the first to support a graphical front-end, was one such title. It was only released as a beta test in 1986 by Quantum Link, an online service for the Commodore 64. Quantum Link could not provide the bandwidth at the time to support the game, so the full Habitat was never released outside of the beta test. However, Lucasfilm Games recouped the cost of development by releasing a sized-down version called &quot;Club Caribe&quot; in 1988. Lucasfilm later licensed the software to Fujitsu, who released it in Japan as &quot;Fujitsu Habitat&quot; in 1990. Fujitsu later licensed Habitat for world-wide distribution, and released an updated version called &quot;WorldsAway&quot; in 1995. The latest iteration of Habitat is still called &quot;WorldsAway&quot;, which can be found at MetroWorlds.

Initially, the Games Group worked from Lucas&#x27; Skywalker Ranch near Nicasio, California. In 1990, in a reorganization of the Lucas companies, the Games Division of Lucasfilm became part of the newly created LucasArts Entertainment Company, which also comprised Industrial Light &amp; Magic and Skywalker Sound. Later ILM and Skywalker Sound were consolidated in Lucas Digital Ltd. and LucasArts became the official name of the former Games Division. During this, the division had moved out of Skywalker Ranch to near-by offices in San Rafael, California.

Also in 1990, LucasArts started to publish &quot;The Adventurer&quot;, their own gaming magazine where one could read about their upcoming games and interviews with the developers. The final issue was published in 1996.
In the same year, Lucas Learning was created as a subsidiary of LucasArts, providing educational software for classrooms.

===iMUSE===
&quot;iMUSE&quot; (&quot;Interactive MUsic Streaming Engine&quot;) is an interactive music system used in a number of LucasArts video games. It synchronizes music with the visual action in the game, and transitions from one musical theme to another. iMUSE was developed in the early 1990s by composers Michael Land and Peter McConnell while working at LucasArts. The iMUSE system is patented by LucasArts, and was added to the SCUMM game engine in 1991. The first game to use iMUSE was &quot;Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and it has been used in all LucasArts adventure games since. It has also been used for some non-adventure LucasArts titles, including &quot;Star Wars: X-Wing&quot; (DOS version), &quot;Star Wars: TIE Fighter&quot; (DOS version), and &quot;Star Wars: Dark Forces&quot;.

===Action side-scrolling games===
Lucasfilm Games also released several side-scrollers during the &quot;Lucasarts&quot; era, focusing primarily on run and gun gameplay. A trilogy of games under the name of &quot;Super Star Wars&quot; for the SNES, with each game based on each of the three films from the Star Wars original trilogy: &quot;Super Star Wars&quot; (1992), &quot;Super Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1993) and &quot;Super Star Wars: Return of the Jedi&quot; (1994). An Indiana Jones game based on the first three films of the franchise titled &quot;Indiana Jones&#x27; Greatest Adventures&quot; (1994) was developed alongside Factor 5, the first of many joint collaborations between the two studios.

They also released some games not based on their existing IPs. &quot;Zombies Ate My Neighbors&quot; (1993) and its sequel &quot;Ghoul Patrol&quot; (1994) were overhead run and gun side-scrollers inspired by classic 1950s Horror B-movies. A spiritual successor called &quot;Herc&#x27;s Adventures&quot; was released in 1997 and was inspired by Greek mythology. &quot;Metal Warriors&quot; (1995), a side-scroller inspired by mecha anime, and &quot;Big Sky Trooper&quot; were also developed using the same engine as &quot;Zombies Ate My Neighbors&quot;. Though these games sold poorly, they later garnered a cult following and are now considered to be Cult Classics from the 16-Bit era.

===Adventure games===
The first adventure game developed by Lucasfilm Games was &quot;&quot; in 1986, based on the Lucasfilm movie of the same name. The 1987 title &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; introduced SCUMM, the scripting language behind most of the company&#x27;s later adventure offerings. The adventures released in the following years, such as &quot;Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders&quot; in 1988, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure&quot; in 1989, and the 1990 titles &quot;Loom&quot; and &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; helped Lucasfilm Games build a reputation as one of the leading developers in the genre. The original five adventure games created with SCUMM were released in a compilation titled &quot;LucasArts Classic Adventures&quot; in 1992.

LucasArts was often referred to as one of the two big names in the field, competing with Sierra On-line as a developer of high quality adventures. The first half of the 1990s was the heyday for the company&#x27;s adventure fame, with classic titles such as &quot;Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot; in 1991, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis&quot; in 1992, &quot;Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle&quot; and &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot; in 1993, and the 1995 titles &quot;Full Throttle&quot; and &quot;The Dig&quot;.

In the latter half of the decade, the popularity of adventure games faded and the costs associated with game development increased as high-resolution art and C.D.-quality audio became standard fare. The PC market wanted titles that would show off expensive new graphics cards to best effect, a change replicated in the home console market as the 3D capabilities of the PlayStation, Sega Saturn and Nintendo 64 dictated the nature of the majority of games produced for those platforms. The adventure genre failed to find popularity with the masses of new gamers.

Despite their declining popularity, LucasArts still continued to release adventure titles. In 1997, &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot;, the last LucasArts adventure game to retain traditional two-dimensional graphics and point-and-click interface, was released. This was followed by &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; in 1998, LucasArts&#x27; first attempt to convert a 2D adventure to a 3D environment. The highly stylised visuals, outstanding soundtrack, superb voice acting and sophisticated writing earned Grim Fandango many plaudits, including GameSpot&#x27;s Game of the Year award. &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot; (2000), the fourth installment in the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series, featured the same control scheme as Grim Fandango, and was generally well received. It is the last original adventure game the company has released.

Two sequels to existing franchises, &quot;Full Throttle: Hell on Wheels&quot; and &quot;Sam &amp; Max: Freelance Police&quot;, were announced to be in development but these projects were cancelled, in 2003 and 2004 respectively, before the games were finished. When the rights to the Sam &amp; Max franchise expired in 2005, the creator of Sam &amp; Max, Steve Purcell, regained ownership. He then licensed Sam &amp; Max to Telltale Games to be developed into an episodic game. Telltale Games was made up primarily of former LucasArts employees who had worked on the Sam &amp; Max sequel and were let go after the project was canceled.

LucasArts halted adventure game development for the next five years, focusing instead on their &quot;Star Wars&quot; games. They remained silent and did not rerelease their old games on digital distribution platforms, as other studios were doing at the time. However, in 2002, the company pledged that at least 50% of its releases would have nothing to do with &quot;Star Wars&quot;. It was not until 2009 that they returned to the genre. On June 1, 2009, LucasArts announced both &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition&quot;, a high-definition remake of the original game with revised graphics, music and voice work, and &quot;Tales of Monkey Island&quot;, a new episodic installment in the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series that was developed by Telltale Games.

Then, on July 6, 2009, they announced that they would be rereleasing a number of their classic games, including &quot;Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis&quot; and &quot;LOOM&quot;, on Steam. The rereleases were, for the first time, native versions built for Microsoft Windows. This was the first time in many years that the studio had offered any support for its classic adventure titles.

The second game in the Monkey Island series also received a high-definition remake, entitled &quot;Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge Special Edition&quot; in 2010. Both Monkey Island special edition games were released in a compilation, &quot;Monkey Island Special Edition Collection&quot;, exclusively in Europe in 2011.

The release of the unofficial SCUMM virtual machine, ScummVM, has led to something of a resurgence for LucasArts adventure games among present-day gamers. Using ScummVM, legacy adventure titles can easily be run on modern computers and even more unusual platforms such as video game consoles, mobile phones and PDAs.
===Simulation games===
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Lucasfilm Games developed a series of military vehicle simulation games, the first of which were the naval simulations &quot;PHM Pegasus&quot; in 1986 and &quot;Strike Fleet&quot; in 1987. These two titles were published by Electronic Arts for a variety of computer platforms, including IBM PC compatibles, Commodore 64 and Apple II.

In 1988, &quot;Battlehawks 1942&quot; launched a trilogy of World War II air combat simulations, giving the player a chance to fly as an American or Japanese pilot in the Pacific Theater. Battlehawks 1942 was followed by &quot;Their Finest Hour: The Battle of Britain&quot; in 1989, recreating the battle between the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and RAF for Britain&#x27;s air supremacy. The trilogy ended with &quot;Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe&quot; in 1991, in which the player could choose to fly on either the American or German side. The trilogy was lauded for its historical accuracy and detailed supplementary material—Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe, for instance, was accompanied by a 224-page historical manual. The World War II trilogy was released with cover art by illustrator Marc Ericksen, in a compilation titled &quot;Air Combat Classics&quot; in 1994.

The World War II trilogy was created by a team led by Lawrence Holland, a game designer who later founded Totally Games. Totally Games would continue to develop games almost exclusively to LucasArts for a decade, with the most noted outcome of the symbiosis being the X-Wing series. They were also responsible for LucasArts&#x27; 2003 return to the aerial battles of World War II with &quot;Secret Weapons Over Normandy&quot;, a title released on PlayStation 2, Xbox and PC

In 1996, LucasArts released &quot;Afterlife&quot;, a simulator in which players build their own Heaven and Hell, with several jokes and puns (such as a prison in Hell called San Quentin Tarantino).

===First &quot;Star Wars&quot; games===
Even though LucasArts had created games based on other Lucasfilm properties before (&quot;Labyrinth&quot;, &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;), they did not use the &quot;Star Wars&quot; license until the early 1990s, as it had been held by Broderbund before reverting to Lucasfilm in 1992. The first in-house development was the space combat simulator &quot;X-Wing&quot;, developed by Larry Holland&#x27;s independent team, which went on to spawn a successful series.

The CD-ROM-only &quot;Star Wars&quot; game &quot;Rebel Assault&quot; became one of the biggest successes of the company and was considered a killer app for CD-ROM drives in the early 1990s.

===First-person shooters===
After the unprecedented success of id Software&#x27;s &quot;Doom&quot;, the PC gaming market shifted towards production of three-dimensional first person shooters. LucasArts contributed to this trend with the 1995 release of &quot;Star Wars: Dark Forces&quot;, a first person shooter that successfully transplanted the Doom formula to a Star Wars setting. The Dark Forces Strategy guide claims that development was well underway before Doom was released and that the game was pushed back once Doom hit shelves so that it could be polished. The game was well received and spawned a new franchise: the &quot;Jedi Knight&quot; games. This began with the sequel to &quot;Dark Forces&quot;, &quot;Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II&quot; released in 1997; this game reflected the changing face of PC gaming, being one of the first games to appreciably benefit when used in conjunction with a dedicated 3D graphics card like 3dfx&#x27;s Voodoo range. The game received an expansion pack, &quot;Mysteries of the Sith&quot;, in 1998 and a full sequel in 2002 with &quot;Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast&quot;. 2003&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy&quot; can be seen as a spin-off from the series, but was less well received by reviewers, who complained that the franchise was becoming formulaic.

Apart from &quot;Star Wars&quot;-themed 3D shooters, LucasArts also created the western-themed game &quot;Outlaws&quot; in 1997 and &quot;Armed and Dangerous&quot; (in collaboration with Planet Moon Studios) in 2003.

===In the new millennium===
In 2000, Simon Jeffery became the LucasArts president. He was president of LucasArts until 2003 and some successful &quot;Star Wars&quot; games released during his management like &quot;Star Wars Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast&quot;, &quot;Star Wars Rogue Squadron 2&quot;, &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot;, &quot;Star Wars Jedi Academy&quot; and &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot;. Development of some other successful &quot;Star Wars&quot; Games began during his management, like &quot;Star Wars Republic Commando&quot; and &quot;Star Wars Battlefront&quot;.

In April 2000, LucasArts signed a two-year international distribution deal with Activision for over 45 territories across the world including the United Kingdom. The deal was extended in May 2003 and renewed again in March 2009.

In 2002, LucasArts recognized that the over-reliance on &quot;Star Wars&quot; was reducing the quality of its output, and announced that future releases would be at least 50% non-Star Wars-related. However, many of the original titles were either unsuccessful or even cancelled before release, and since then LucasArts again had mainly &quot;Star Wars&quot; titles in production.

Also in 2002, LucasArts released a compilation CD filled with music from their past games. The album is titled &quot;The Best of LucasArts Original Soundtracks&quot; and features music from the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series, &quot;Grim Fandango&quot;, &quot;Outlaws&quot;, and &quot;The Dig&quot;.

2003 saw the fruitful collaboration of LucasArts and BioWare on the well reviewed role-playing game, &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot;. Combining modern 3D graphics with high-quality storytelling and a sophisticated role-playing game system, this game reinvigorated the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. Its 2004 sequel &quot;Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords&quot; continued in the same vein, but LucasArts was criticized for forcing the developer Obsidian Entertainment to release the sequel unfinished, resulting in a significant amount of cut content, a disappointing ending and numerous bugs. 2003 also saw the release of &quot;Gladius&quot;, a gladiator Tactical RPG that was positively received but sold poorly and was even rated as one of the &quot;best Xbox games most people never played&quot; by &quot;Official Xbox Magazine&quot;.

In 2003, LucasArts and the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise also branched out in a new direction—the world of the MMORPG, with the creation of &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot;. After a successful launch, the first expansion, Jump to Lightspeed, was released in 2004. The new expansion featured the addition of real-time space combat. This was continued in &quot;Rage of the Wookiees&quot;, an additional expansion which added an additional planet for users to explore. Also, a new expansion, &quot;Trials of Obi-Wan&quot; was released on November 1, 2005, consisting of several new missions focusing on the Episode 3 planet, Mustafar. While &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot; still retained a devoted following, it also alienated many players. &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot; chose to ignore the timeline established in the original films, during which the game is set, and also allowed players to play as Jedi characters. The game also underwent several major redesigns, which were received with mixed reactions by players.

===Restructuring under Jim Ward===
In April 2004, Jim Ward, V.P. of marketing, online and global distributions at Lucasfilm, was appointed president of LucasArts. Ward performed a top-to-bottom audit of LucasArts infrastructure, describing the company&#x27;s state as &quot;quite a mess.&quot; In 2003, LucasArts had reportedly grossed just over $100,000,000 according to N.P.D., primarily from its &quot;Star Wars&quot; titles — significantly less than the grosses from the year&#x27;s top single titles such as &quot;&quot;. Ward produced a five-year investment plan to refit the company. Previous &quot;Star Wars&quot; games had been produced by external developers such as Raven Software, BioWare and Obsidian; Ward now prioritized making LucasArts&#x27; internal game development work effectively and adapt to the evolving game industry. &quot;Star Wars: Battlefront&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: Republic Commando&quot;, and &quot;Star Wars: Episode III&quot; survived cuts that closed down other in-development games and reduced staff from about 450 to 190 employees.

Ward also canceled &quot;Star Wars Rogue Squadron Trilogy&quot; which was 50% completed and it was going to be released on the Xbox in 2004.

Factor 5 was going to develop a &quot;Rogue Squadron&quot; game titled &quot;Rogue Squadron: X-Wing vs Tie Fighter&quot; for the Xbox 360 but it was canceled by LucasArts.

After Factor 5&#x27;s exclusivity with Sony ended they decided to release &quot;Rogue Squadron Trilogy&quot; for the Wii, but it was eventually cancelled as well.

In 2004, LucasArts released &quot;Star Wars: Battlefront&quot;, based on the same formula as the popular &quot;Battlefield&quot; series of games. It ended up becoming the best-selling &quot;Star Wars&quot; game of all time to that point, aided by a marketing tie-in with the original trilogy D.V.D. release. Its sequel, &quot;Star Wars: Battlefront II&quot;, was released on November 1, 2005, and featured new locales such as Episode III planets Mustafar, Mygeeto, etc., in addition to space combat, playable Jedi, and new special units like Bothan spies and Imperial officers. In this same year, the second &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot; game was in production. LucasArts told Obsidian Entertainment that the project needed to be finished by that year&#x27;s holiday season. Obsidian was forced to cut huge amounts of content from the game, resulting in a rushed, unfinished Knights of the Old Republic II.

In March 2005, LucasArts published &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Video Game&quot;, the first game in the popular Lego video game franchise by Traveller&#x27;s Tales. It was based on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequel trilogy. In May 2005, LucasArts released &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, a third person action game based on the film. Also in 2005, LucasArts released &quot;Star Wars: Republic Commando&quot;, and one of their few non-&quot;Star Wars&quot; games, &quot;&quot;, developed by Pandemic Studios.

On February 16, 2006, LucasArts released &quot;Star Wars: Empire at War&quot;, a real-time strategy game developed by Petroglyph. September 12, 2006, saw the release of &quot;Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy&quot;, the sequel to the popular &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Video Game&quot;. &quot;Lego Star Wars II&quot;, once again developed by Traveller&#x27;s Tales and published by LucasArts, follows the same basic format as the first game, but, as the name indicates, covers the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy.

A game titled &quot;Traxion&quot; was announced. &quot;Traxion&quot; was a rhythm game which was under development for the PlayStation Portable by British developer Kuju Entertainment, scheduled to be released in Q4 2006 by LucasArts, but was instead cancelled in January 2007. The game was to feature a number of minigames, and would support imported songs from the player&#x27;s own mp3 library as well as the game&#x27;s bundled collection.

In May 2007, LucasArts announced &quot;Fracture&quot; and stated that &quot;new intellectual properties serve a vital role to the growth of LucasArts&quot;. &quot;&quot; was labelled the number one new IP in 2005 and &quot;Thrillville&quot; the number one new children&#x27;s IP in 2006. Fracture was released on October 7, 2008, to average reviews. &quot;Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction&quot; was released on January 11, 2005, to critical and commercial success which led to a sequel, &quot;Mercenaries 2: World in Flames&quot;. &quot;Thrillville&quot; was released on November 21, 2006, and &quot;&quot; was released on October 16, 2007.

On September 16, 2008, &quot;Star Wars: The Force Unleashed&quot; was released to mixed reviews, though it quickly became the fastest-selling &quot;Star Wars&quot; game of all time.

The rapid scaling down of internal projects at LucasArts was also reflected in its handling of games developed by external developers. During the tenure of Ward, Free Radical was contracted to produce &quot;Star Wars: Battlefront III&quot;, which had been in production for 2 years. Free Radical co-founder Steve Ellis described how working with LucasArts evolved from being &quot;the best relationship we&#x27;d ever had with a publisher&quot; to withholding money for 6 months and abusing the independent developer&#x27;s position to withhold the full project cancellation fee—this was a major event which contributed towards Free Radical entering administration.

===Last years as part of an independent Lucasfilm===
Ward left the company in early February 2008, for personal reasons. He was replaced by Howard Roffman as interim president. Darrell Rodriguez, who came from Electronic Arts, took Roffman&#x27;s place in April 2008. About a month prior to release of &quot;Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II&quot;, LucasArts scaled down the internal development studio. The aforementioned game received a mediocre score from some media outlets such as IGN, GameSpot and GameTrailers. After release, minor adjustment in staffing resulted in even more layoffs.

The successor to &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords&quot;, in the form of the MMORPG &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot;, was announced on October 21, 2008, at an invitation-only press event. developed by BioWare. It was released in December 2011.

They also published &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars – Republic Heroes&quot; in 2009 for all current systems. The game is a tie-in to &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; television series and was released on October 6, 2009, receiving generally negative reviews.

During television network G4&#x27;s coverage of the 2006 E3 Convention, a LucasArts executive was asked about the return of popular franchises such as &quot;Monkey Island&quot;. The executive responded that the company was currently focusing on new franchises, and that LucasArts may return to the &quot;classic franchises&quot; in 2015, though it was unclear as to whether the date was put forwards as an actual projection, or hyperbole. This turned out to be hyperbole, as LucasArts and Telltale Games announced new adventure games in a joint press release in 2009. The games announced were &quot;Tales of Monkey Island&quot;, which was to be developed by Telltale, and a LucasArts-developed enhanced remake of the 1990 title &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot;, with the intent of bringing the old game to a new audience. According to LucasArts, this announcement was &quot;just the start of LucasArts&#x27; new mission to revitalize its deep portfolio of beloved gaming franchises&quot;. Following the success of this, LucasArts released the sequel, &quot;Monkey Island 2 – Special Edition&quot; in the summer of 2010.

The company began experiencing turnovers in layoffs in 2010. Rodriguez left in May after just two years on the job. A Lucasfilm board of Directors and a game industry veteran, Jerry Bowerman, filled in during the transition. Rodriguez was ultimately replaced in June by Paul Meegan, formerly of Gears of War developer Epic Games.

In July 2010, Haden Blackman, who served as creative director on the original &quot;Star Wars: The Force Unleashed&quot;, LucasArts&#x27; most successful internally produced title of recent years, and the sequel, unexpectedly left. However, the company scored a surprise coup in August 2010 when Clint Hocking, a high-profile game director from Ubisoft, announced that he would be joining LucasArts. His tenure at LucasArts was short lived however, as Hocking left LucasArts in June 2012 before the game he was working on was released. In September 2010, a third of the employees at LucasArts were laid off.

In March 2011, LucasArts published a sequel to the popular Lego Star Wars series, &quot;Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars&quot;, based on the &quot;Clone Wars&quot; animated series, once again developed by Traveller&#x27;s Tales. Sony Online Entertainment announced in June 2011 that Star Wars Galaxies would be shutting down at the end of 2011. Its services were terminated on December 15, 2011.

Another canceled title of Lucasarts was a Darth Maul game which was going to be developed by the same company which made the Wii version of The Force Unleashed II.

On April 26, 2011, LucasArts announced that it had acquired a license from Epic Games to develop a number of future titles using the Unreal Engine 3 for a number of platforms. &quot;Star Wars 1313&quot;, a proposed action-adventure about Boba Fett navigating Coruscant&#x27;s subterranean underworld, was confirmed to use the Unreal Engine 3. However, the game was cancelled as a result of the closure of the development arm of LucasArts.

In April 2012, LucasArts published &quot;Kinect Star Wars&quot;, developed by Terminal Reality, for the Xbox 360. It was poorly reviewed by critics, receiving an aggregated score of 53.32% on GameRankings and 55/100 on Metacritic.

In August 2012, Meegan, who replaced Rodriguez as president in 2010, also left his position at LucasArts after just two years on the job. Kevin Parker and Gio Corsi were named to co-lead the studio until the studio would choose a permanent president, with the former as interim head of business operations and the latter as interim head of studio production.

The last game released through LucasArts as a subsidiary of an independent Lucasfilm was &quot;Angry Birds Star Wars&quot;, a game that gave the &quot;Angry Birds&quot; characters costumes and abilities based on the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. It was released on November 8, 2012, before the Disney acquisition of Lucasfilm was finalized. The game was developed and published by Rovio Entertainment, and licensed by LucasArts.

===Acquisition by Disney===
The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm and its subsidiaries, including LucasArts, on December 21, 2012 following regulatory approval in a deal for . At the time, there were no plans for any downsizing of Lucasfilm divisions, and a LucasArts representative said that &quot;for the time being, all projects are business as usual&quot;. In the months that followed, LucasArts was believed to be working on three untitled games: an open-world RPG, an FPS, and an aerial combat game. This included cancelling &quot;Star Wars&quot; games already in development such as &quot;Star Wars 1313&quot;, &quot;First Assault&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: The Force Unleashed III&quot; to put more focus on &quot;Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens&quot;.

On April 3, 2013, Lucasfilm announced that it was shuttering its video game development practice and laying off most of the LucasArts staff. Any further game development would be handled by Disney Interactive Studios or licensed to third-party developers. A skeleton staff of fewer than ten employees remained at LucasArts to function as a video game licensor. Disney indicated that the new business model would &quot;[minimize] the company&#x27;s risk while achieving a broad portfolio of quality &quot;Star Wars&quot; games.&quot; Around 150 staff members lost their jobs as a result of the closure. The layoffs at LucasArts also resulted in layoffs at fellow visual effects subsidiary Industrial Light &amp; Magic; as many of LucasArts&#x27; employees also worked for ILM, the company was left overstaffed. Electronic Arts became one of the major third-party publishers for &quot;Star Wars&quot; games through an exclusive multi-year license, while Disney Interactive Studios would handle development for the casual gaming market of &quot;mobile, social, tablet and online game categories&quot;.

=== Lucasfilm Games since 2021 ===
On January 11, 2021, Lucasfilm announced that it was reestablishing the Lucasfilm Games brand for all future gaming titles from Lucasfilm, though it would remain solely as a licensor of Lucasfilm properties. Later that week, it was announced that MachineGames was developing a game based upon the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; franchise with Todd Howard serving as an executive producer and Bethesda publishing the game, and that Massive Entertainment was developing an open world &quot;Star Wars&quot; game with Julian Gerighty serving as creative director and Ubisoft publishing the game. It was also revealed that EA was still in development on several games based upon the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. In September 2021, it was announced that a remake of &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot; was in development. The game is being developed by Aspyr for Windows and PlayStation 5, for which it will serve as a timed console-exclusive. In December 2021, &quot;Star Wars Eclipse&quot; was announced at The Game Awards 2021; it is an action-adventure game in the early stages of development by Quantic Dream. The game will feature multiple playable characters with branching narratives. It is set in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe and is part of the &quot;High Republic&quot; multimedia project, which places the events of the game 200 years before the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. In January 2022, it was announced that Respawn Entertainment would be developing multiple Star Wars games, including a &quot;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order&quot; sequel, entitled &quot;Star Wars Jedi: Survivor&quot;, alongside FPS and Strategy video games. In April 2022, it was announced that Lucasfilm Games would be co-publishing &quot;Return to Monkey Island&quot; alongside Devolver Digital, a sequel to &quot;LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot; with series creator Ron Gilbert returning to develop the game with his company &quot;Terrible Toybox.&quot; That same month, it was announced that Skydance New Media would be collaborating with Lucasfilm Games to make a game based in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, with Amy Hennig leading the project. In June 2023, it was revealed that the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; game from MachineGames and Bethesda Softworks would release for Windows and Xbox Series X/S as a console-exclusive. In August 2024, the new open-world action-adventure game &quot;Star Wars Outlaws&quot; was released in cooperation with Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft.

==Logo==

The original Lucasfilm Games logo was based upon the existing Lucasfilm movie logo, with a number of variations on it being used. This logo was later brought back when the Lucasfilm Games branding was revived in 2021. The long-lived LucasArts logo, affectionately known as the &quot;Gold Guy&quot;, was introduced in 1990 and first used within &quot;Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (the first game shipped under the LucasArts name). The logo consisted of a crude gold-colored figure inspired by an Ancestral Puebloan petroglyph, standing on a purple letter &quot;L&quot; inscribed with the company name. The figure had its hands up in the air, as if a sun were rising from behind him. It was also said to resemble an eye, with the rays of the sun as eyelashes. The logo was revised in late 2005, losing the letter &quot;L&quot; pedestal and introducing a more rounded version of the gold-colored figure. The last game to feature the original &quot;Gold Guy&quot; was &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;, while the new logo was first seen in &quot;Star Wars: Battlefront II&quot;. In the games, the figure sometimes does an action like throw a lightsaber or cast Force Lightning.
In 1998, LucasArts approached Finnish game developer Remedy Entertainment, citing that their logo was copied from the top portion of the LucasArts logo, and threatened legal action. Remedy was by that time already in the process of redesigning their logo, so they complied by taking their old logo offline from their website, and introducing their new logo a little later.

==Legacy==
Ex-LucasArts developers have founded numerous San Francisco game development studios such as Double Fine Productions (2000), Telltale Games (2004), MunkyFun (2008), Dynamighty (2011), SoMa Play (2013), and Fifth Journey (2015) playing a significant role in the continued development of computer games in the Bay Area.

At the 2014 Electronic Entertainment Expo, Sony Computer Entertainment announced &quot;Grim Fandango Remastered&quot;, developed by Double Fine Productions as a console exclusive for PlayStation platforms. It was released in 2015 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, Android, and iOS. During Sony&#x27;s new PlayStation Experience convention in 2014, another remaster by Double Fine, &quot;Day of the Tentacle Remastered&quot;, was announced. It was released in March 2016 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux. At the 2015 PlayStation Experience, another remastered game by Double Fine was announced, &quot;Full Throttle Remastered&quot;. It was released in April 2017 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux.
