<text>Jalāl al-Dīn Muḥammad Rūmī (), or simply Rumi (30 September 1207 – 17 December 1273), was a 13th-century poet, Hanafi &quot;faqih&quot; (jurist), Islamic scholar, Maturidi theologian (&quot;mutakallim&quot;), and Sufi mystic originally from Greater Khorasan in Greater Iran.

Rumi&#x27;s works were written mostly in Persian, but occasionally he also used Turkish, Arabic and Greek in his verse. His &quot;Masnavi&quot; (&quot;Mathnawi&quot;), composed in Konya, is considered one of the greatest poems of the Persian language. Rumi&#x27;s influence has transcended national borders and ethnic divisions: Iranians, Afghans, Tajiks, Turks, Kurds, Greeks, Central Asian Muslims, as well as Muslims of the Indian subcontinent have greatly appreciated his spiritual legacy for the past seven centuries. His poetry influenced not only Persian literature, but also the literary traditions of the Ottoman Turkish, Chagatai, Pashto, Kurdish, Urdu, and Bengali languages.

Rumi&#x27;s works are widely read today in their original language across Greater Iran and the Persian-speaking world. His poems have subsequently been translated into many of the world&#x27;s languages and transposed into various formats. Rumi has been described as the &quot;most popular poet&quot;, is very popular in Turkey, Azerbaijan and South Asia, 
and has become the &quot;best selling poet&quot; in the United States.

==Name==
He is most commonly called &quot;Rumi&quot; in English. His full name is given by his contemporary Faridun bin Ahmad Sipahsalar as &quot;Muhammad bin Muhammad bin al-Husayn al-Khatibi al-Balkhi al-Bakri&quot; (). He is more commonly known as &quot;Molānā Jalāl ad-Dīn Muḥammad Rūmī&quot; (). &quot;Jalal ad-Din&quot; is an Arabic name meaning &quot;Glory of the Faith&quot;. &quot;Balkhī&quot; and &quot;Rūmī&quot; are his &quot;nisbas&quot;, meaning, respectively, &quot;from Balkh&quot; and &quot;from Rûm&quot;, as he was from the Sultanate of Rûm in Anatolia.

According to the authoritative Rumi biographer Franklin Lewis of the University of Chicago, &quot;[t]he Anatolian peninsula which had belonged to the Byzantine, or eastern Roman empire, had only relatively recently been conquered by Muslims and even when it came to be controlled by Turkish Muslim rulers, it was still known to Arabs, Persians and Turks as the geographical area of Rum. As such, there are a number of historical personages born in or associated with Anatolia known as Rumi, a word borrowed from Persian literally meaning &#x27;Roman,&#x27; in which context Roman refers to subjects of the Byzantine Empire or simply to people living in or things associated with Anatolia.&quot; He was also known as &quot;Mullah of Rum&quot; ( &quot;mullā-yi Rūm&quot; or &quot;mullā-yi Rūmī&quot;).

Rumi is widely known by the sobriquet &quot;Mawlānā&quot;/&quot;Molānā&quot; ( ) in Iran and popularly known as in Turkey. &quot;Mawlānā&quot; () is a term of Arabic origin, meaning &quot;our master&quot;. The term &quot;Mawlawī&quot;/&quot;Mowlavi&quot; (Persian) and (Turkish), also of Arabic origin, meaning &quot;my master&quot;, is also frequently used for him.

==Life==
===Overview===
Rumi was born to Persian parents, in Balkh, modern-day Afghanistan or Wakhsh, a village on the East bank of the Wakhsh River known as Sangtuda in present-day Tajikistan. The area, culturally adjacent to Balkh, is where Mawlânâ&#x27;s father, Bahâ&#x27; uddîn Walad, was a preacher and jurist. He lived and worked there until 1212, when Rumi was aged around five and the family moved to Samarkand.

Greater Balkh was at that time a major centre of Persian culture and Sufism had developed there for several centuries. The most important influences upon Rumi, besides his father, were the Persian poets Attar and Sanai. Rumi expresses his appreciation: &quot;Attar was the spirit, Sanai his eyes twain, And in time thereafter, Came we in their train&quot; and mentions in another poem: &quot;Attar has traversed the seven cities of Love, We are still at the turn of one street&quot;. His father was also connected to the spiritual lineage of Najm al-Din Kubra.

Rumi lived most of his life under the Persianate Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, where he produced his works and died in 1273AD. He was buried in Konya, and his shrine became a place of pilgrimage. Upon his death, his followers and his son Sultan Walad founded the Mevlevi Order, also known as the Order of the Whirling Dervishes, famous for the Sufi dance known as the Sama ceremony. He was laid to rest beside his father, and over his remains a shrine was erected. A hagiographical account of him is described in Shams ud-Din Ahmad Aflāki&#x27;s &quot;Manāqib ul-Ārifīn&quot; (written between 1318 and 1353). This biography needs to be treated with care as it contains both legends and facts about Rumi. For example, Professor Franklin Lewis of the University of Chicago, author of the most complete biography on Rumi, has separate sections for the hagiographical biography of Rumi and the actual biography about him.

===Childhood and emigration===
Rumi&#x27;s father was Bahā ud-Dīn Walad, a theologian, jurist and a mystic from Wakhsh, who was also known by the followers of Rumi as Sultan al-Ulama or &quot;Sultan of the Scholars&quot;. According to Sultan Walad&#x27;s &quot;Ibadetname&quot; and Shamsuddin Aflaki (c.1286 to 1291), Rumi was a descendant of Abu Bakr. Some modern scholars, however, reject this claim and state it does not hold on closer examination. The claim of maternal descent from the Khwarazmshah for Rumi or his father is also seen as a non-historical hagiographical tradition designed to connect the family with royalty, but this claim is rejected for chronological and historical reasons. The most complete genealogy offered for the family stretches back to six or seven generations to famous Hanafi jurists.

We do not learn the name of Baha al-Din&#x27;s mother in the sources, only that he referred to her as &quot;Māmi&quot; (colloquial Persian for Māma), and that she was a simple woman who lived to the 1200s. The mother of Rumi was Mu&#x27;mina Khātūn. The profession of the family for several generations was that of Islamic preachers of the relatively liberal Hanafi Maturidi school, and this family tradition was continued by Rumi (see his Fihi Ma Fih and Seven Sermons) and Sultan Walad (see Ma&#x27;rif Waladi for examples of his everyday sermons and lectures).

When the Mongols invaded Central Asia sometime between 1215 and 1220, Baha ud-Din Walad, with his whole family and a group of disciples, set out westwards. According to hagiographical account which is not agreed upon by all Rumi scholars, Rumi encountered one of the most famous mystic Persian poets, Attar, in the Iranian city of Nishapur, located in the province of Khorāsān. Attar immediately recognized Rumi&#x27;s spiritual eminence. He saw the father walking ahead of the son and said, &quot;Here comes a sea followed by an ocean.&quot; Attar gave the boy his &quot;Asrārnāma&quot;, a book about the entanglement of the soul in the material world. This meeting had a deep impact on the eighteen-year-old Rumi and later on became the inspiration for his works.

From Nishapur, Walad and his entourage set out for Baghdad, meeting many of the scholars and Sufis of the city. From Baghdad they went to Hejaz and performed the pilgrimage at Mecca. The migrating caravan then passed through Damascus, Malatya, Erzincan, Sivas, Kayseri and Nigde. They finally settled in Karaman for seven years; Rumi&#x27;s mother and brother both died there. In 1225, Rumi married Gowhar Khatun in Karaman. They had two sons: Sultan Walad and Ala-eddin Chalabi. When his wife died, Rumi married again and had a son, Amir Alim Chalabi, and a daughter, Malakeh Khatun.

On 1 May 1228, most likely as a result of the insistent invitation of &#x27;Alā&#x27; ud-Dīn Key-Qobād, ruler of Anatolia, Baha&#x27; ud-Din came and finally settled in Konya in Anatolia within the westernmost territories of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm.

===Education and encounters with Shams-e Tabrizi===

Baha&#x27; ud-Din became the head of a madrassa (religious school) and when he died, Rumi, aged twenty-five, inherited his position as the Islamic molvi. One of Baha&#x27; ud-Din&#x27;s students, Sayyed Burhan ud-Din Muhaqqiq Termazi, continued to train Rumi in the Shariah as well as the Tariqa, especially that of Rumi&#x27;s father. For nine years, Rumi practised Sufism as a disciple of Burhan ud-Din until the latter died in 1240 or 1241. Rumi&#x27;s public life then began: he became an Islamic Jurist, issuing fatwas and giving sermons in the mosques of Konya. He also served as a Molvi (Islamic teacher) and taught his adherents in the madrassa.

During this period, Rumi also travelled to Damascus and is said to have spent four years there.

It was his meeting with the dervish Shams-e Tabrizi on 15 November 1244 that completely changed his life. From an accomplished teacher and jurist, Rumi was transformed into an ascetic.

Shams had travelled throughout the Middle East searching and praying for someone who could &quot;endure my company&quot;. A voice said to him: &quot;What will you give in return?&quot; Shams replied, &quot;My head!&quot; The voice then said, &quot;The one you seek is Jalal ud-Din of Konya.&quot; On the night of 5 December 1248, as Rumi and Shams were talking, Shams was called to the back door. He went out, never to be seen again. It is rumoured that Shams was murdered with the connivance of Rumi&#x27;s son, &#x27;Ala&#x27; ud-Din; if so, Shams indeed gave his head for the privilege of mystical friendship.

Rumi&#x27;s love for, and his bereavement at the death of, Shams found their expression in an outpouring of lyric poems, &quot;Divan-e Shams-e Tabrizi&quot;. He himself went out searching for Shams and journeyed again to Damascus. There, he realised:
===Later life and death===
Mewlana had been spontaneously composing &quot;ghazals&quot; (Persian poems), and these had been collected in the &quot;Divan-i Kabir&quot; or Diwan Shams Tabrizi. Rumi found another companion in Salaḥ ud-Din-e Zarkub, a goldsmith. After Salah ud-Din&#x27;s death, Rumi&#x27;s scribe and favourite student, Hussam-e Chalabi, assumed the role of Rumi&#x27;s companion. One day, the two of them were wandering through the Meram vineyards outside Konya when Hussam described to Rumi an idea he had had: &quot;If you were to write a book like the &quot;Ilāhīnāma&quot; of Sanai or the &quot;Mantiq ut-Tayr&quot; of &#x27;Attar, it would become the companion of many troubadours. They would fill their hearts from your work and compose music to accompany it.&quot; Rumi smiled and took out a piece of paper on which were written the opening eighteen lines of his &quot;Masnavi&quot;, beginning with:

Hussam implored Rumi to write more. Rumi spent the next twelve years of his life in Anatolia dictating the six volumes of this masterwork, the &quot;Masnavi&quot;, to Hussam.

In December 1273, Rumi fell ill; he predicted his own death and composed the well-known &quot;ghazal&quot;, which begins with the verse:

Rumi died on 17 December 1273 in Konya. His death was mourned by the diverse community of Konya, with local Christians and Jews joining the crowd that converged to bid farewell as his body was carried through the city. Rumi&#x27;s body was interred beside that of his father, and a splendid shrine, the &quot;Green Tomb&quot; (Turkish: Yeşil Türbe, ; today the Mevlâna Museum), was erected over his place of burial. His epitaph reads:

Georgian princess and Seljuq queen Gurju Khatun was a close friend of Rumi. She was the one who sponsored the construction of his tomb in Konya. The 13th-century Mevlâna Mausoleum, with its mosque, dance hall, schools and living quarters for dervishes, remains a destination of pilgrimage to this day, and is probably the most popular pilgrimage site to be regularly visited by adherents of every major religion.

==Teachings==

Like other mystic and Sufi poets of Persian literature, Rumi&#x27;s poetry speaks of love which infuses the world. Rumi&#x27;s teachings also express the tenets summarized in the Quranic verse which Shams-e Tabrizi cited as the essence of prophetic guidance: &quot;Know that ‘There is no god but He,’ and ask forgiveness for your sin&quot; (Q. 47:19). 

In the interpretation attributed to Shams, the first part of the verse commands the humanity to seek knowledge of &quot;tawhid&quot; (oneness of God), while the second instructs them to negate their own existence. In Rumi&#x27;s terms, &quot;tawhid&quot; is lived most fully through love, with the connection being made explicit in his verse that describes love as &quot;that flame which, when it blazes up, burns away everything except the Everlasting Beloved.&quot;

Rumi&#x27;s longing and desire to attain this ideal is evident in the following poem from his book the Masnavi:
The &quot;Masnavi&quot; weaves fables, scenes from everyday life, Qur&#x27;anic revelations and exegesis, and metaphysics into a vast and intricate tapestry.

Rumi believed passionately in the use of music, poetry and dance as a path for reaching God. For Rumi, music helped devotees to focus their whole being on the divine and to do this so intensely that the soul was both destroyed and resurrected. It was from these ideas that the practice of whirling Dervishes developed into a ritual form. His teachings became the base for the order of the Mevlevi, which his son Sultan Walad organised. Rumi encouraged Sama, listening to music and turning or doing the sacred dance. In the Mevlevi tradition, &quot;samāʿ&quot; represents a mystical journey of spiritual ascent through mind and love to the Perfect One. In this journey, the seeker symbolically turns towards the truth, grows through love, abandons the ego, finds the truth and arrives at the Perfect. The seeker then returns from this spiritual journey, with greater maturity, to love and to be of service to the whole of creation without discrimination with regard to beliefs, races, classes and nations.

In other verses in the &quot;Masnavi&quot;, Rumi describes in detail the universal message of love:

Rumi&#x27;s favourite musical instrument was the ney (reed flute).

==Major works==
Rumi&#x27;s poetry is often divided into various categories: the quatrains (&quot;rubayāt&quot;) and odes (&quot;ghazal&quot;) of the &quot;Divan&quot;, the six books of the &quot;Masnavi&quot;. The prose works are divided into The Discourses, The Letters, and the &quot;Seven Sermons&quot;.

===Poetic works===
* Rumi&#x27;s best-known work is the &quot;Maṭnawīye Ma&#x27;nawī&quot; (&quot;Spiritual Couplets&quot;; ). The six-volume poem holds a distinguished place within the rich tradition of Persian Sufi literature, and has been commonly called &quot;the Quran in Persian&quot;. Many commentators have regarded it as the greatest mystical poem in world literature. It contains approximately 27,000 lines, each consisting of a couplet with an internal rhyme. While the mathnawi genre of poetry may use a variety of different metres, after Rumi composed his poem, the metre he used became the mathnawi metre &quot;par excellence&quot;. The first recorded use of this metre for a mathnawi poem took place at the Nizari Ismaili fortress of Girdkuh between 1131 and 1139. It likely set the stage for later poetry in this style by mystics such as Attar and Rumi.

* Rumi&#x27;s other major work is the &quot;Dīwān-e Kabīr&quot; (&quot;Great Work&quot;) or &quot;Dīwān-e Shams-e Tabrīzī&quot; (&quot;The Works of Shams of Tabriz&quot;; ), named in honour of Rumi&#x27;s master Shams. Besides approximately 35000 Persian couplets and 2000 Persian quatrains, the Divan contains 90 Ghazals and 19 quatrains in Arabic, a couple of dozen or so couplets in Turkish (mainly macaronic poems of mixed Persian and Turkish) and 14 couplets in Greek (all of them in three macaronic poems of Greek-Persian).

===Prose works===
* &quot;Fihi Ma Fihi&quot; (&quot;In It What&#x27;s in It&quot;, Persian: ) provides a record of seventy-one talks and lectures given by Rumi on various occasions to his disciples. It was compiled from the notes of his various disciples, so Rumi did not author the work directly. An English translation from the Persian was first published by A.J. Arberry as &quot;Discourses of Rumi&quot; (New York: Samuel Weiser, 1972), and a translation of the second book by Wheeler Thackston, &quot;Sign of the Unseen&quot; (Putney, VT: Threshold Books, 1994). The style of the &quot;Fihi ma fihi&quot; is colloquial and meant for middle-class men and women, and lack the sophisticated wordplay.
* &quot;Majāles-e Sab&#x27;a&quot; (&quot;Seven Sessions&quot;, Persian: ) contains seven Persian sermons (as the name implies) or lectures given in seven different assemblies. The sermons themselves give a commentary on the deeper meaning of Qur&#x27;an and Hadith. The sermons also include quotations from poems of Sana&#x27;i, &#x27;Attar, and other poets, including Rumi himself. As Aflakī relates, after Shams-e Tabrīzī, Rumi gave sermons at the request of notables, especially Salāh al-Dīn Zarkūb. The style of Persian is rather simple, but quotation of Arabic and knowledge of history and the Hadith show Rumi&#x27;s knowledge in the Islamic sciences. His style is typical of the genre of lectures given by Sufis and spiritual teachers.
* &quot;Makatib&quot; (&quot;The Letters&quot;, Persian: ) or &quot;Maktubat&quot; () is the collection of letters written in Persian by Rumi to his disciples, family members, and men of state and of influence. The letters testify that Rumi kept very busy helping family members and administering a community of disciples that had grown up around them. Unlike the Persian style of the previous two mentioned works (which are lectures and sermons), the letters are consciously sophisticated and epistolary in style, which is in conformity with the expectations of correspondence directed to nobles, statesmen and kings.

==Religious outlook==
Despite references to other religions, Rumi clearly holds the superiority of Islam. As Muslim, Rumi praises the Quran, not only as sacred book of Muslims, but also as tool to distinguish truth from falsehood. As such, the Quran features as guidebook for humanity and those who want to understand the reality of the world.

The prophets of Islam, according to Rumi, constitute the highest point of spiritual development and are the closest to God. Throughout Rumi&#x27;s writings, Muhammad is the most perfect example of all previous prophets.

Despite Rumi&#x27;s explicit adherence to Islam, there are traces of religious pluralism throughout his work. Although Rumi acknowledges religious discrepancies, the core of all religions is the same. The disagreement between religions does not lie in the core of these religions, but in doctrinal differences. Accordingly, Rumi criticizes Christianity for &quot;overloading the image of God with superfluous structures and complications&quot;. Yet, Rumi declares that &quot;the lamps are different, but the Light is the same; it comes from beyond&quot;.

His depth of his spiritual vision extended beyond narrow sectarian concerns. One quatrain reads:
According to the Quran, Muhammad is a mercy sent by God. In regards to this, Rumi states:

&quot;The Light of Muhammad does not abandon a Zoroastrian or Jew in the world. May the shade of his good fortune shine upon everyone! He brings all of those who are led astray into the Way out of the desert.&quot;

Rumi, however, asserts the supremacy of Islam by stating:

&quot;The Light of Muhammad has become a thousand branches (of knowledge), a thousand, so that both this world and the next have been seized from end to end. If Muhammad rips the veil open from a single such branch, thousands of monks and priests will tear the string of false belief from around their waists.&quot;

Many of Rumi&#x27;s poems suggest the importance of outward religious observance and the primacy of the Qur&#x27;an.

Rumi states:

&lt;poem&gt;I am the servant of the Qur&#x27;an as long as I have life.
I am the dust on the path of Muhammad, the Chosen one.
If anyone quotes anything except this from my sayings,
I am quit of him and outraged by these words.&lt;/poem&gt;

Rumi also states:

On the first page of the Masnavi, Rumi states:

 &quot;Hadha kitâbu &#x27;l- mathnawîy wa huwa uSûlu uSûli uSûli &#x27;d-dîn wa kashshâfu &#x27;l-qur&#x27;ân.&quot;
&quot;This is the book of the Masnavi, and it is the roots of the roots of the roots of the (Islamic) Religion and it is the Explainer of the Qur&#x27;ân.&quot;

Hadi Sabzavari, one of Iran&#x27;s most important 19th-century philosophers, makes the following connection between the Masnavi and Islam, in the introduction to his philosophical commentary on the book:

It is a commentary on the versified exegesis [of the Qur’ān] and its occult mystery, since all of it [all of the Mathnawī] is, as you will see, an elucidation of the clear verses [of the Qur’ān], a clarification of prophetic utterances, a glimmer of the light of the luminous Qur’ān, and burning embers irradiating their rays from its shining lamp. As respects to hunting through the treasure-trove of the Qur’ān, one can find in it [the Mathnawī] all [the Qur’ān&#x27;s] ancient philosophical wisdom; it [the Mathnawī] is all entirely eloquent philosophy. In truth, the pearly verse of the poem combines the Canon Law of Islam (sharīʿa) with the Sufi Path (ṭarīqa) and the Divine Reality (ḥaqīqa); the author&#x27;s [Rūmī] achievement belongs to God in his bringing together of the Law (sharīʿa), the Path, and the Truth in a way that includes critical intellect, profound thought, a brilliant natural temperament, and integrity of character that is endowed with power, insight, inspiration, and illumination.

Seyyed Hossein Nasr states:

One of the greatest living authorities on Rûmî in Persia today, Hâdî Hâ&#x27;irî, has shown in an unpublished work that some 6,000 verses of the Dîwân and the Mathnawî are practically direct translations of Qur&#x27;ânic verses into Persian poetry.

Rumi states in his Dīwān:

The Sufi is hanging on to Muhammad, like Abu Bakr.

==Legacy==
===Universality===
Rumi&#x27;s work has been translated into many of the world&#x27;s languages, including Russian, German, Urdu, Turkish, Arabic, Bengali, French, Italian, Spanish, Telugu and Kannada and is being presented in a growing number of formats, including concerts, workshops, readings, dance performances, and other artistic creations. The English interpretations of Rumi&#x27;s poetry by Coleman Barks have sold more than half a million copies worldwide, and Rumi is one of the most widely read poets in the United States. There is a famous landmark in Northern India, known as Rumi Gate, situated in Lucknow (the capital of Uttar Pradesh) named for Rumi. Indian filmmaker Muzaffar Ali who is from Lucknow made a documentary, titled &quot;Rumi in the Land of Khusrau&quot; (2001), which presents concerts based on the works of Rumi and Amir Khusrau and highlights parallels between the lives of the poets.

===Iranian world===
These cultural, historical and linguistic ties between Rumi and Iran have made Rumi an iconic Iranian poet, and some of the most important Rumi scholars including Foruzanfar, Naini, Sabzewari, etc., have come from modern Iran. Rumi&#x27;s poetry is displayed on the walls of many cities across Iran, sung in Persian music, and read in school books.

Rumi&#x27;s poetry forms the basis of much classical Iranian and Afghan music. Contemporary classical interpretations of his poetry are made by Muhammad Reza Shajarian, Shahram Nazeri, Davood Azad (the three from Iran) and Ustad Mohammad Hashem Cheshti (Afghanistan).

===Mewlewī Sufi Order; Rumi and Turkey===
The Mewlewī Sufi order was founded in 1273 by Rumi&#x27;s followers after his death. His first successor could have been Salah-eddin Zarkoub who served Rumi for a decade and Rumi revered him highly in his poets. Zarkoub was illiterate and uttered some words incorrectly. Rumi used some of these incorrect words in his poems to express his support and humility towards Zarkoub. Rumi named him his successor but Zarkoub died sooner than him. So Rumi&#x27;s first successor in the rectorship of the order was &quot;Husam Chalabi&quot; and, after Chalabi&#x27;s death in 1284, Rumi&#x27;s younger and only surviving son, Sultan Walad (d. 1312), popularly known as author of the mystical &quot;Maṭnawī Rabābnāma&quot;, or the &quot;Book of the Rabab&quot; was installed as grand master of the order. The leadership of the order has been kept within Rumi&#x27;s family in Konya uninterruptedly since then.
The Mewlewī Sufis, also known as Whirling Dervishes, believe in performing their &quot;dhikr&quot; in the form of Sama. During the time of Rumi (as attested in the &quot;Manāqib ul-Ārefīn&quot; of Aflākī), his followers gathered for musical and &quot;turning&quot; practices.

According to tradition, Rumi was himself a notable musician who played the &quot;robāb&quot;, although his favourite instrument was the &quot;ney&quot; or reed flute. The music accompanying the &quot;samāʿ&quot; consists of settings of poems from the &quot;Maṭnawī&quot; and &quot;Dīwān-e Kabīr&quot;, or of Sultan Walad&#x27;s poems. The Mawlawīyah was a well-established Sufi order in the Ottoman Empire, and many of the members of the order served in various official positions of the Caliphate. The centre for the Mevlevi was in Konya. There is also a Mewlewī monastery (, &quot;dargāh&quot;) in Istanbul near the Galata Tower in which the &quot;samāʿ&quot; is performed and accessible to the public. The Mewlewī order issues an invitation to people of all backgrounds:

During Ottoman times, the Mevlevi produced a number of notable poets and musicians, including Sheikh Ghalib, Ismail Rusuhi Dede of Ankara, Esrar Dede, Halet Efendi, and Gavsi Dede, who are all buried at the Galata Mewlewī Khāna (Turkish: &quot;Mevlevi-Hane&quot;) in Istanbul. Music, especially that of the ney, plays an important part in the Mevlevi.

With the foundation of the modern, secular Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk removed religion from the sphere of public policy and restricted it exclusively to that of personal morals, behaviour and faith. On 13 December 1925, a law was passed closing all the &quot;tekkes&quot; (dervish lodges) and &quot;zāwiyas&quot; (chief dervish lodges), and the centres of veneration to which visits (&quot;ziyārat&quot;) were made. Istanbul alone had more than 250 &quot;tekke&quot;s as well as small centres for gatherings of various fraternities; this law dissolved the Sufi Orders, prohibited the use of mystical names, titles and costumes pertaining to their titles, impounded the Orders&#x27; assets, and banned their ceremonies and meetings. The law also provided penalties for those who tried to re-establish the Orders. Two years later, in 1927, the Mausoleum of Mevlâna in Konya was allowed to reopen as a Museum.

In the 1950s, the Turkish government began allowing the Whirling Dervishes to perform once a year in Konya. The Mewlānā festival is held over two weeks in December; its culmination is on 17 December, the Urs of Mewlānā (anniversary of Rumi&#x27;s death), called &quot;Šab-e Arūs&quot; () (Persian meaning &quot;nuptial night&quot;), the night of Rumi&#x27;s union with God. In 1974, the Whirling Dervishes were permitted to travel to the West for the first time. In 2005, UNESCO proclaimed &quot;The Mevlevi Sama Ceremony&quot; of Turkey as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.
Rumi and his mausoleum were depicted on the reverse of the 5000 Turkish lira banknotes of 1981–1994.

===Religious denomination===
As Edward G. Browne noted, the three most prominent mystical Persian poets, Rumi, Sanai and Attar, were all Sunni Muslims and their poetry abounds with praise for the first two caliphs, Abu Bakr and Umar ibn al-Khattāb. According to Annemarie Schimmel, the tendency among Shia authors to anachronistically include leading mystical poets such as Rumi and Attar among their own ranks, became stronger after the introduction of Twelver Shia as the state religion in the Safavid Empire in 1501.

===Eight-hundredth anniversary celebrations===
In Afghanistan, Rumi is known as &quot;Mawlānā&quot;, in Turkey as &quot;Mevlâna&quot;, and in Iran as &quot;Molavī&quot;.

At the proposal of the Permanent Delegations of Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey, and as approved by its executive board and General Conference in conformity with its mission of &quot;constructing in the minds of men the defences of peace&quot;, UNESCO was associated with the celebration, in 2007, of the eight hundredth anniversary of Rumi&#x27;s birth. The commemoration at UNESCO itself took place on 6 September 2007; UNESCO issued a medal in Rumi&#x27;s name in the hope that it would prove an encouragement to those who are engaged in research on and dissemination of Rumi&#x27;s ideas and ideals, which would, in turn, enhance the diffusion of the ideals of UNESCO.

On 30 September 2007, Iranian school bells were rung throughout the country in honour of Mewlana. Also in that year, Iran held a Rumi Week from 26 October to 2 November. An international ceremony and conference were held in Tehran; the event was opened by the Iranian president and the chairman of the Iranian parliament. Scholars from twenty-nine countries attended the events, and 450 articles were presented at the conference. Iranian musician Shahram Nazeri was awarded the Légion d&#x27;honneur and Iran&#x27;s House of Music Award in 2007 for his renowned works on Rumi masterpieces. 2007 was declared as the &quot;International Rumi Year&quot; by UNESCO.

Also on 30 September 2007, Turkey celebrated Rumi&#x27;s eight-hundredth birthday with a giant Whirling Dervish ritual performance of the &quot;samāʿ&quot;, which was televised using forty-eight cameras and broadcast live in eight countries. Ertugrul Gunay, of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, stated, &quot;Three hundred dervishes are scheduled to take part in this ritual, making it the largest performance of sema in history.&quot;

===&quot;Mawlana Rumi Review&quot;===
The &quot;Mawlana Rumi Review&quot; is published annually by The Centre for Persian and Iranian Studies at the University of Exeter in collaboration with The Rumi Institute in Nicosia, Cyprus, and Archetype Books in Cambridge. The first volume was published in 2010, and it has come out annually since then. According to the principal editor of the journal, Leonard Lewisohn: &quot;Although a number of major Islamic poets easily rival the likes of Dante, Shakespeare and Milton in importance and output, they still enjoy only a marginal literary fame in the West because the works of Arabic and Persian thinkers, writers and poets are considered as negligible, frivolous, tawdry sideshows beside the grand narrative of the Western Canon. It is the aim of the Mawlana Rumi Review to redress this carelessly inattentive approach to world literature, which is something far more serious than a minor faux pas committed by the Western literary imagination.&quot;

<text>The James Norris Memorial Trophy, or simply the Norris Trophy, is awarded annually to the National Hockey League&#x27;s top &quot;defense player who demonstrates throughout the season the greatest all-round ability in the position&quot;. It is named after James E. Norris, the longtime owner of the Detroit Red Wings. The James Norris Memorial Trophy has been awarded 62 times to 26 players since its beginnings in 1953–54. At the end of each season, members of the Professional Hockey Writers&#x27; Association vote to determine the player who was the best defenseman during the regular season.

==History==
The trophy is named in honour of James E. Norris, owner of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Detroit Red Wings from 1932 to 1952. The trophy was first awarded at the conclusion of the 1953–54 NHL season.

Bobby Orr of the Boston Bruins won the award for a record eight consecutive seasons (1968–75). Doug Harvey and Nicklas Lidstrom won the award seven times, and Ray Bourque won it five times; Bourque was in the top three vote-getters for the trophy a further ten times. The Boston Bruins have had the most Norris Trophies winners with 14; the Montreal Canadiens have had the second most with 12.

Only two players have won both the Norris and Hart Memorial Trophy for the league Most Valuable Player in the same season: Bobby Orr, who won both trophies in the 1969–70, 1970–71 and 1971–72 seasons, and Chris Pronger, who won the Hart and Norris in the 1999–2000 NHL season. As of 2021, no defenseman has won the Hart Trophy without also winning the Norris Trophy since the latter was introduced.

Six defensemen won the Hart Trophy as the league&#x27;s most valuable player before the Norris Trophy&#x27;s establishment: Herb Gardiner, Eddie Shore (four times), Albert &quot;Babe&quot; Siebert, Ebbie Goodfellow, Tommy Anderson and Babe Pratt.

Save for Randy Carlyle, every Norris winner eligible to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame has been.

Members of the Professional Hockey Writers&#x27; Association vote at the end of the regular season, and each individual voter ranks their top five candidates on a 10–7–5–3–1 point(s) system. Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL awards ceremony after the conclusion of the playoffs.

<doc id="16438" wikidata="Q6107679" url="?curid=16438" title="JANET">
<text>Janet is a high-speed network for the UK research and education community provided by Jisc, a not-for-profit company set up to provide computing support for education. It serves 18 million users and is the busiest National Research and Education Network in Europe by volume of data carried. Previously, Janet was a private, UK-government funded organisation, which provided the JANET computer network and related collaborative services to UK research and education.

All further- and higher-education organisations in the UK are connected to the Janet network, as are all the Research Councils; the majority of these sites are connected via 20 metropolitan area networks across the UK (though Janet refers to these as regions, emphasising that Janet connections are not just confined to a metropolitan area). The network also carries traffic between schools within the UK, although many of the schools&#x27; networks maintain their own general Internet connectivity. The name was originally a contraction of Joint Academic NETwork but it is now known as Janet in its own right.

The network is linked to other European and worldwide NRENs through GÉANT and peers extensively with other ISPs at Internet Exchange Points in the UK. Any other networks are reached via transit services from commercial ISPs using Janet&#x27;s Peering Policy.

The Janet network is operated by Jisc Services Limited, part of Jisc. Janet is also responsible for the .ac.uk and .gov.uk domains. On 1 December 2012, Janet and Jisc Collections joined to form Jisc Collections and Janet Limited, as subsidiary organisations to Jisc. In March 2015, Jisc Collections and Janet Limited was renamed to Jisc Services Limited. Jisc Services continues to operate under the brand name of Janet, with the same remit. Janet was previously known as the JNT Association, and prior to that, UKERNA (the United Kingdom Education and Research Networking Association).

==History==

=== Early academic networks ===
Janet developed out of academic networks built in Britain since the late 1960s. Planning for the first regional network, South West Universities Computer Network (SWUCN), centred on Bristol began in 1967 and work started in 1969. A number of national computer facilities serving the Science Research Council (SRC) community developed in the early 1970s, each with their own star network (ULCC London, UMRCC Manchester, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory). Other regional networks followed in the mid-late 1970s around Edinburgh (RCOnet), London (METROnet), the Midlands (MIDnet), and Newcastle (NUMAC - the Northern Universities Multiple Access Computer) among others such as Yorkshire and the South East. These groups of institutions pooled resources to provide better computing facilities than could be afforded individually. The star networks developed into distributed computer networks but each was based on one manufacturer&#x27;s standards and were mutually incompatible and overlapping.

=== JANET ===
In the early 1980s a standardisation and interconnection effort started, hosted on an expansion of the SERCnet X.25 research network. The JANET effort was based on the Coloured Book protocols developed by the British academic community, which provided the first complete X.25 standard, and gave the UK &quot;several years lead over other countries&quot;. The naming scheme, JANET NRS, established &quot;UK&quot; as the top-level domain. Later that year, the Internet&#x27;s Domain Name System adopted British researchers&#x27; recommendation to use country code top-level domains. By then, the UK had a pre-existing national standard, which was retained as the .uk Internet country-code top level domain for the United Kingdom.

JANET went live on 1 April 1984, two years before the NSFNET initiated operations in the United States. It hosted about 50 sites with line speeds of 9.6 kbit/s. In the mid-80s the backbone was upgraded to 2 Mbit/s, with 64 kbit/s access links. JANET connected to NSFNET in 1989.

===JIPS===

Planning began in January 1991 for the JANET Internet Protocol Service (JIPS). It was set up as a pilot project in March 1991 to host Internet Protocol (IP) traffic on the existing network. Within eight months the IP traffic had exceeded the levels of X.25 traffic, and the IP support became official in November. 

JANET became, primarily, a high-speed IP network. A further upgrade in the early 1990s took the backbone to 8 Mbit/s and the access links to 2 Mbit/s, making Janet the fastest X.25 network in the world at the time.

There had been some talk of moving Janet to OSI protocols in the 1990s, but changes in the networking world meant this never happened. The X.25 service was closed in August 1997. 

=== SuperJanet ===
In order to address speed concerns, several hardware upgrades have been incorporated into the Janet system. In 1989 SuperJanet was proposed, to re-host JANET on a fibre optic network. Work started in late 1992, and by late 1993 the first 14 sites had migrated to the new 34 Mbit/s ATM system. SuperJanet also moved solely to IP.

In 1995 SuperJanet2 started, adding 155 Mbit/s ATM backbones and a 10 Mbit/s SMDS network encompassing some of the original JANET nodes. JANET&#x27;s mandate now included running metropolitan area networks centred on these sites.

SuperJanet3 created new 155 Mbit/s ATM nodes to fully connect all of the major sites at London, Bristol, Manchester and Leeds, with 34 Mbit/s links to smaller sites around the country.

In March 2001 SuperJanet4 was launched. The key challenges for SuperJanet4 were the need to increase network capacity and to strengthen the design and management of the JANET network to allow it to meet a similar increase in the size of its userbase.

SuperJanet4 saw the implementation of a 2.5 Gbit/s core backbone from which connections to regional network points of presence were made at speeds ranging between 155 Mbit/s to 2.5 Gbit/s depending upon the size of the regional network. In 2002 the core SuperJanet4 backbone was upgraded to 10 Gbit/s.

SuperJanet4 also saw an increase in the userbase of the JANET network, with the inclusion of the Further Education Community and the use of the SuperJanet4 backbone to interconnect schools&#x27; networks. The core point of presence (Backbone) sites in SuperJanet4 were Edinburgh, Glasgow, Warrington, Reading, Bristol, Portsmouth, London and Leeds.

In October 2006 the SuperJanet5 project was launched after £29 million of investment. It provides a 10 Gbit/s backbone, with an upgrade path to 40 Gbit/s over the next few years. The new backbone as a result of the SuperJanet5 project is a hybrid network offering, providing both a high speed IP transit service and private bandwidth channel services provisioned over a dedicated fibre network. It is designed not only to fully accommodate the requirements of the traditional JANET user base - all research institutes, universities and further education - but also to meet the needs of a new userbase in the UK&#x27;s primary and secondary schools.

In April 2011 Verizon helped Janet upgrade 4 central locations to run at 100 Gbit/s bringing it to a national research and education network performance parity with Internet2 (which upgraded its backbone to 100 Gbit/s in October 2007). As of October 2011 they have over 18 million end-users.

Janet6 started to go live in July 2013, and was officially launched at an event at the London Film Museum on 26 November 2013. At launch, Janet6 had an initial capacity of 2 Tbit/s.

== Regions ==

The Janet network is implemented through 18 regions which connect universities, colleges and schools to the Janet network. Most regions are operated by Janet, although a few operate as independent entities working under contract.

Each regional network covers a specific geographical area. As of 2014 the following regional networks are connected to Janet:
* C&amp;NLMAN – Cumbria and North Lancashire

<text>John Harrison ( – 24 March 1776) was an English carpenter and clockmaker who invented the marine chronometer, a long-sought-after device for solving the problem of how to calculate longitude while at sea.

Harrison&#x27;s solution revolutionized navigation and greatly increased the safety of long-distance sea travel. The problem he solved had been considered so important following the Scilly naval disaster of 1707 that the British Parliament was offering financial rewards of up to £20,000 (equivalent to £ in 2025) under the 1714 Longitude Act, though Harrison never received the full reward due to political rivalries. He presented his first design in 1730, and worked over many years on improved designs, making several advances in time-keeping technology, finally turning to what were called sea watches. Harrison gained support from the Longitude Board in building and testing his designs. Towards the end of his life, he received recognition and a reward from Parliament.

== Early life ==
John Harrison was born in Foulby in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the first of five children in his family. His stepfather worked as a carpenter at the nearby Nostell Priory estate. A house on the site of what may have been the family home bears a blue plaque. Around 1700, the Harrison family moved to the Lincolnshire village of Barrow upon Humber. Following his father&#x27;s trade as a carpenter, Harrison built and repaired clocks in his spare time. Legend has it that at the age of six, while in bed with smallpox, he was given a watch to amuse himself and he spent hours listening to it and studying its moving parts.

He also had a fascination with music, eventually becoming choirmaster for the Church of Holy Trinity, Barrow upon Humber. 

Harrison built his first longcase clock in 1713, at the age of 20. The mechanism was made entirely of wood. Three of Harrison&#x27;s early wooden clocks have survived: 
* the first (1713) is in the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers&#x27; collection, previously in the Guildhall in London and since 2015 on display in the Science Museum.
* The second (1715) is also in the Science Museum in London
* the third (1717) is at Nostell Priory in Yorkshire, the face bearing the inscription &quot;John Harrison Barrow&quot;.

The Nostell example, in the billiards room of this stately home, has a Victorian outer case with small glass windows on each side of the movement so that the wooden workings may be inspected.

On 30 August 1718, John Harrison married Elizabeth Barret at Barrow-upon-Humber church. After her death in 1726, he married Elizabeth Scott on 23 November 1726, at the same church.

In the early 1720s, Harrison was commissioned to make a new turret clock at Brocklesby Hall, North Lincolnshire. The clock still works, and like his previous clocks has a wooden movement of oak and lignum vitae. Unlike his early clocks, it incorporates some original features to improve timekeeping, for example the grasshopper escapement. Between 1725 and 1728, John and his brother James, also a skilled joiner, made at least three precision longcase clocks, again with the movements and longcase made of oak and lignum vitae. The grid-iron pendulum was developed during this period. Of these longcase clocks:
* Number 1 is in a private collection. Until 2004, it belonged to the Time Museum (USA), which closed in 2000.
* Number 2 is in the Leeds City Museum, as the centrepiece of a permanent display dedicated to John Harrison&#x27;s achievements. The exhibition, &quot;John Harrison: The Clockmaker Who Changed the World&quot;, opened on 23 January 2014. It was the first longitude-related event marking the tercentenary of the Longitude Act.
* Number 3 is in the collection of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers&#x27;.

Harrison was a man of many skills and he used these to systematically improve the performance of the pendulum clock. He invented the gridiron pendulum, consisting of alternating brass and iron rods assembled in such a way that the thermal expansions and contractions essentially cancel each other out. Another example of his inventive genius was the grasshopper escapement, a control device for the step-by-step release of a clock&#x27;s driving power. Developed from the anchor escapement, it was almost frictionless, requiring no lubrication because the pallets were made from wood. This was an important advantage at a time when lubricants and their degradation were little understood. In his earlier work on sea clocks, Harrison was continually assisted, both financially and in many other ways, by the watchmaker and instrument maker George Graham. Harrison was introduced to Graham by the Astronomer Royal Edmond Halley, who championed Harrison and his work. The support was important to Harrison, as he was supposed to have found it difficult to communicate his ideas in a coherent manner.

== Longitude problem ==

Longitude fixes the location of a place on Earth east or west of a north–south reference line called the prime meridian. It is given as an angular measurement that ranges from 0° at the prime meridian to +180° eastward and −180° westward. Knowledge of a ship&#x27;s east–west position is essential when approaching land. Over long voyages, cumulative errors in estimates of position by dead reckoning frequently led to shipwrecks and a great loss of life. Avoiding such disasters became vital in Harrison&#x27;s lifetime, in an era when trade and the need for accurate navigation were increasing dramatically around the world.

Many ideas were proposed for how to determine longitude during a sea voyage. Earlier methods attempted to compare local time with the known time at a reference place, such as Greenwich or Paris, based on a simple theory that had first been proposed by Gemma Frisius. The methods relied on astronomical observations that were themselves reliant on the predictable nature of the motions of different heavenly bodies. Such methods were problematic because of the difficulty in maintaining an accurate record of the time at the reference place.

Harrison set out to solve the problem directly, by producing a reliable clock that could keep the time of the reference place accurately over long intervals without having to constantly adjust it. The difficulty was in producing a clock that was not affected by variations in temperature, pressure, or humidity, resisted corrosion in salt air, and was able to function on board a constantly moving ship. Many scientists, including Isaac Newton and Christiaan Huygens, doubted that such a clock could ever be built and favoured other methods for reckoning longitude, such as the method of lunar distances. Huygens ran trials using both a pendulum and a spiral balance spring clock as methods of determining longitude, with both types producing inconsistent results. Newton observed that &quot;a good watch may serve to keep a reckoning at sea for some days and to know the time of a celestial observation; and for this end a good Jewel may suffice till a better sort of watch can be found out. But when longitude at sea is lost, it cannot be found again by any watch&quot;.

== First three marine timekeepers ==

In the 1720s, the English clockmaker Henry Sully invented a marine clock that was designed to determine longitude: this was in the form of a clock with a large balance wheel that was vertically mounted on friction rollers and impulsed by a frictional rest Debaufre-type escapement. Very unconventionally, the balance oscillations were controlled by a weight at the end of a pivoted horizontal lever attached to the balance by a cord. This solution avoided temperature error due to thermal expansion, a problem which affects steel balance springs. Sully&#x27;s clock kept accurate time only in calm weather, however, because the balance oscillations were affected by the pitching and rolling of the ship. Still, his clocks were among the first serious attempts to find longitude by improving the accuracy of timekeeping at sea. Harrison&#x27;s machines, though much larger, are of similar layout: H3 has a vertically mounted balance wheel and is linked to another wheel of the same size, an arrangement that eliminates problems arising from the ship&#x27;s motion.

In 1716, Sully presented his first to the French Académie des Sciences and in 1726 he published . In 1730, Harrison designed a marine clock to compete for the Longitude prize and travelled to London, seeking financial assistance. He presented his ideas to Edmond Halley, the Astronomer Royal, who in turn referred him to George Graham, the country&#x27;s foremost clockmaker. Graham must have been impressed by Harrison&#x27;s ideas, for he loaned him money to build a model of his &quot;Sea clock&quot;. As the clock was an attempt to make a seagoing version of his wooden pendulum clocks, which performed exceptionally well, he used wooden wheels, roller pinions, and a version of the grasshopper escapement. Instead of a pendulum, he used two dumbbell balances which were linked together.

It took Harrison five years to build his first sea clock (or H1). He demonstrated it to members of the Royal Society who spoke on his behalf to the Board of Longitude. The clock was the first proposal that the Board considered to be worthy of a sea trial. In 1736, Harrison sailed to Lisbon on HMS &quot;Centurion&quot; under the command of Captain George Proctor and returned on HMS &quot;Orford&quot; after Proctor died at Lisbon on 4 October 1736. The clock lost time on the outward voyage. However, it performed well on the return trip: both the captain and the sailing master of the &quot;Orford&quot; praised the design. The master noted that his own calculations had placed the ship sixty miles east of its true landfall which had been correctly predicted by Harrison using H1.

This was not the transatlantic voyage stipulated by the Board of Longitude in their conditions for winning the prize, but the Board was impressed enough to grant Harrison £500 for further development. Harrison had moved to London by 1737 and went on to develop H2, a more compact and rugged version. In 1741, after three years of building and two of on-land testing, H2 was ready, but by then Britain was at war with Spain in the War of the Austrian Succession, and the mechanism was deemed too important to risk falling into Spanish hands. In any event, Harrison suddenly abandoned all work on this second machine when he discovered a serious design flaw in the concept of the bar balances. He had not recognized that the period of oscillation of the bar balances could be affected by the yawing action of the ship (when the ship turned upon its vertical axis, such as when &quot;coming about&quot; while tacking). It was this that led him to adopt circular balances in the Third Sea Clock (H3). The Board granted him another £500 and while waiting for the war to end, he proceeded to work on H3.

Harrison spent seventeen years working on this third &quot;sea clock&quot;, but despite every effort it did not perform exactly as he had wished. The problem was that, because Harrison did not fully understand the physics behind the springs used to control the balance wheels, the timing of the wheels was not isochronous, a characteristic that affected its accuracy. The engineering world was not to fully understand the properties of springs for such applications for another two centuries. Despite that it had proved a very valuable experiment and much was learned from its construction. Certainly with this machine Harrison left the world two enduring legacies–the bimetallic strip and the caged roller bearing.

== Longitude watches ==

After steadfastly pursuing various methods during thirty years of experimentation, Harrison found to his surprise that some of the watches made by Graham&#x27;s successor Thomas Mudge kept time just as accurately as his huge sea clocks. It is possible that Mudge was able to do this after the early 1740s thanks to the availability of the new &quot;Huntsman&quot; or &quot;Crucible&quot; steel first produced by Benjamin Huntsman sometime in the early 1740s, which enabled harder pinions but more importantly a tougher and more highly polished cylinder escapement to be produced.
Harrison then realized that a mere watch after all could be made accurate enough for the task and was a far more practical proposition for use as a marine timekeeper. He proceeded to redesign the concept of the watch as a timekeeping device, basing his design on sound scientific principles.

===&quot;Jefferys&quot; watch===
He had already in the early 1750s designed a precision watch for his own use, which was made for him by the watchmaker John Jefferys 1752–1753. This watch incorporated a novel frictional rest escapement and was not only the first to have a compensation for temperature variations but also contained the first miniature &quot;going train fusee&quot; of Harrison&#x27;s design which enabled the watch to continue running whilst being wound. These features led to the very successful performance of the &quot;Jefferys&quot; watch, which Harrison incorporated into the design of two new timekeepers which he proposed to build. These were in the form of a large watch and another of a smaller size but similar pattern. However, only the larger No. 1 watch (or &quot;H4&quot; as it is sometimes called) appears to have been finished (see the reference to &quot;H4&quot; below). Aided by some of London&#x27;s finest workmen, he proceeded to design and make the world&#x27;s first successful marine timekeeper that allowed a navigator to accurately assess his ship&#x27;s position in longitude. Importantly, Harrison showed everyone that it could be done by using a watch to calculate longitude. This was to be Harrison&#x27;s masterpiece – an instrument of beauty, resembling an oversized pocket watch from the period. It is engraved with Harrison&#x27;s signature, marked Number 1 and dated AD 1759.

=== H4 ===

Harrison&#x27;s first &quot;sea watch&quot; (now known as H4) is housed in silver pair cases some in diameter. The clock&#x27;s movement is highly complex for the period, resembling a larger version of the then-current conventional movement. A coiled steel spring inside a brass mainspring barrel provides 30 hours of power. That is covered by the fusee barrel which pulls a chain wrapped around the conically shaped pulley known as the fusee. The fusee is topped by the winding square (requiring separate key). The great wheel attached to the base of this fusee transmits power to the rest of the movement. The fusee contains the maintaining power, a mechanism for keeping the H4 going while being wound. From Gould: 

In comparison, the verge&#x27;s escapement has a recoil with a limited balance arc and is sensitive to variations in driving torque. According to a review by H. M. Frodsham of the movement in 1878, H4&#x27;s escapement had &quot;a good deal of &#x27;set&#x27; and not so much recoil, and as a result the impulse came very near to a double chronometer action&quot;.

The D-shaped pallets of Harrison&#x27;s escapement are both made of diamond, approximately 2 mm long with the curved side radius of 0.6 mm, a considerable feat of manufacture at the time. For technical reasons the balance was made much larger than in a conventional watch of the period, in diameter weighing and the vibrations controlled by a flat spiral steel spring of three turns with a long straight tail. The spring is tapered, being thicker at the stud end and tapering toward the collet at the centre. The movement also has centre seconds motion with a sweep seconds hand.

The Third Wheel is equipped with internal teeth and has an elaborate bridge similar to the pierced and engraved bridge for the period. It runs at 5 beats (ticks) per second, and is equipped with a tiny second remontoire. A balance-brake, activated by the position of the fusee, stops the watch half an hour before it is completely run down, in order that the remontoire does not run down also. Temperature compensation is in the form of a &#x27;compensation curb&#x27; (or &#x27;Thermometer Kirb&#x27; as Harrison called it). This takes the form of a bimetallic strip mounted on the regulating slide, and carrying the curb pins at the free end. During its initial testing, Harrison dispensed with this regulation using the slide, but left its indicating dial or figure piece in place. This first watch took six years to construct, following which the Board of Longitude determined to trial it on a voyage from Portsmouth to Kingston, Jamaica. For this purpose it was placed aboard the 50-gun , which set sail from Portsmouth on 18 November 1761. Harrison, by then 68 years old, sent it on this transatlantic trial in the care of his son, William. The watch was tested before departure by Robertson, Master of the Academy at Portsmouth, who reported that on 6 November 1761 at noon it was 3 seconds slow, having lost 24 seconds in 9 days on mean solar time. The daily rate of the watch was therefore fixed as losing seconds per day.

When &quot;Deptford&quot; reached its destination, after correction for the initial error of 3 seconds and accumulated loss of 3 minutes 36.5 seconds at the daily rate over the 81 days and 5 hours of the voyage, the watch was found to be 5 seconds slow compared to the known longitude of Kingston, corresponding to an error in longitude of 1.25 minutes, or approximately one nautical mile. William Harrison returned aboard the 14-gun , reaching England on 26 March 1762 to report the successful outcome of the experiment. Harrison senior thereupon waited for the £20,000 prize, but the Board were persuaded that the accuracy could have been just luck and demanded another trial. The Board were also not convinced that a timekeeper which took six years to construct met the test of practicality required by the Longitude Act. The Harrisons were outraged and demanded their prize, a matter that eventually worked its way to Parliament, which offered £5,000 for the design. The Harrisons refused but were eventually obliged to make another trip to Bridgetown on the island of Barbados to settle the matter.

At the time of this second trial, another method for measuring longitude was ready for testing: the Method of Lunar Distances. The Moon moves fast enough, some thirteen degrees a day, to easily measure the movement from day to day. By comparing the angle between the Moon and the Sun for the day one left for Britain, the &quot;proper position&quot; (how it would appear in Greenwich, England, at that specific time) of the Moon could be calculated. By comparing this with the angle of the Moon over the horizon, the longitude could be calculated. During Harrison&#x27;s second trial of his &#x27;sea watch&#x27; (H4), Nevil Maskelyne was asked to accompany HMS &quot;Tartar&quot; and test the Lunar Distances system. Once again the watch proved extremely accurate, keeping time to within 39 seconds, corresponding to an error in the longitude of Bridgetown of less than . Maskelyne&#x27;s measures were also fairly good, at , but required considerable work and calculation in order to use. At a meeting of the Board in 1765 the results were presented, but they again attributed the accuracy of the measurements to luck. Once again the matter reached Parliament, which offered £10,000 in advance and the other half once he turned over the design to other watchmakers to duplicate. In the meantime Harrison&#x27;s watch would have to be turned over to the Astronomer Royal for long-term on-land testing.

Unfortunately, Nevil Maskelyne had been appointed Astronomer Royal on his return from Barbados, and was therefore also placed on the Board of Longitude. He returned a report of the watch that was negative, claiming that its &quot;going rate&quot; (the amount of time it gained or lost per day) was due to inaccuracies cancelling themselves out, and refused to allow it to be factored out when measuring longitude. Consequently, this first Marine Watch of Harrison&#x27;s failed the needs of the Board despite the fact that it had succeeded in two previous trials.
Harrison began working on his second &#x27;sea watch&#x27; (H5) while testing was conducted on the first, which Harrison felt was being held hostage by the Board. After three years he had had enough; Harrison felt &quot;extremely ill used by the gentlemen who I might have expected better treatment from&quot; and decided to enlist the aid of King George III. He obtained an audience with the King, who was extremely annoyed with the Board. King George tested the watch No. 2 (H5) himself at the palace and after ten weeks of daily observations between May and July in 1772, found it to be accurate to within one third of one second per day. King George then advised Harrison to petition Parliament for the full prize after threatening to appear in person to dress them down. Finally in 1773, when he was 80 years old, Harrison received a monetary award in the amount of £8,750 from Parliament for his achievements, but he never received the official award (which was never awarded to anyone). He was to survive for just three more years.

In total, Harrison received £23,065 for his work on chronometers. He received £4,315 in increments from the Board of Longitude for his work, £10,000 as an interim payment for H4 in 1765 and £8,750 from Parliament in 1773. This gave him a reasonable income for most of his life (equivalent to roughly £450,000 per year in 2007, though all his costs, such as materials and subcontracting work to other horologists, had to come out of this). He became the equivalent of a multi-millionaire (in today&#x27;s terms) in the final decade of his life. Captain James Cook used K1, a copy of H4, on his second and third voyages, having used the lunar distance method on his first voyage. K1 was made by Larcum Kendall, who had been apprenticed to John Jefferys. Cook&#x27;s log is full of praise for the watch and the charts of the southern Pacific Ocean he made with its use were remarkably accurate. K2 was loaned to Lieutenant William Bligh, commander of HMS &quot;Bounty&quot;, but it was retained by Fletcher Christian following the infamous mutiny. It was not recovered from Pitcairn Island until 1808, when it was given to Captain Mayhew Folger, and then passed through several hands before reaching the National Maritime Museum in London.

Initially, the cost of these chronometers was quite high (roughly 30% of a ship&#x27;s cost). However, over time, the costs dropped to between £25 and £100 (half a year&#x27;s to two years&#x27; salary for a skilled worker) in the early 19th century. Many historians point to relatively low production volumes over time as evidence that the chronometers were not widely used. However, Landes points out that the chronometers lasted for decades and did not need to be replaced frequently–indeed the number of makers of marine chronometers reduced over time due to the ease in supplying the demand even as the merchant marine expanded. Also, many merchant mariners would make do with a deck chronometer at half the price. These were not as accurate as the boxed marine chronometer but were adequate for many. While the Lunar Distances method would complement and rival the marine chronometer initially, the chronometer would overtake it in the 19th century. The more accurate Harrison timekeeping device led to the much-needed precise calculation of longitude, making the device a fundamental key to the modern age. After Harrison, the marine timekeeper was reinvented yet again by John Arnold, who, while basing his design on Harrison&#x27;s most important principles, at the same time simplified it enough for him to produce equally accurate but far less costly marine chronometers in quantity from around 1783. Nonetheless, for many years even towards the end of the 18th century, chronometers were expensive rarities, as their adoption and use proceeded slowly due to the high expense of precision manufacturing. The expiry of Arnold&#x27;s patents at the end of the 1790s enabled many other watchmakers including Thomas Earnshaw to produce chronometers in greater quantities at less cost even than those of Arnold.

By the early 19th century, navigation at sea without one was considered unwise to unthinkable. Using a chronometer to aid navigation simply saved lives and ships – the insurance industry, self-interest, and common sense did the rest in making the device a universal tool of maritime trade.

==Death and memorials ==


Harrison died on 24 March 1776, at the age of eighty-two, just shy of his eighty-third birthday. He was buried in the graveyard of St John&#x27;s Church, Hampstead, in north London, along with his second wife Elizabeth and later their son William. His tomb was restored in 1879 by the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, even though Harrison had never been a member of the Company.

Harrison&#x27;s last home was 12 Red Lion Square in the Holborn district of London. There is a blue plaque dedicated to Harrison on the wall of Summit House, a 1925 modernist office block, on the south side of the square. A memorial tablet to Harrison was unveiled in Westminster Abbey on 24 March 2006, finally recognising him as a worthy companion to his friend George Graham and Thomas Tompion, &#x27;The Father of English Watchmaking&#x27;, who are both buried in the Abbey. The memorial shows a meridian line (line of constant longitude) in two metals to highlight Harrison&#x27;s most widespread invention, the bimetallic strip thermometer. The strip is engraved with its own longitude of 0 degrees, 7 minutes and 35 seconds West.

The Corpus Clock in Cambridge, unveiled in 2008, is a homage by the designer to Harrison&#x27;s work but is of an electromechanical design. In appearance it features Harrison&#x27;s grasshopper escapement, the &#x27;pallet frame&#x27; being sculpted to resemble an actual grasshopper. This is the clock&#x27;s defining feature.

In 2014, Northern Rail named diesel railcar 153316 as the &quot;John &#x27;Longitude&#x27; Harrison&quot;.

On 3 April 2018, Google celebrated his 325th birthday by making a Google Doodle for its homepage.

In February 2020, a bronze statue of John Harrison was unveiled in Barrow upon Humber. The statue was created by sculptor Marcus Cornish.

== Later history ==

After World War I, Harrison&#x27;s timepieces were rediscovered at the Royal Greenwich Observatory by retired naval officer Lieutenant Commander Rupert T. Gould.

The timepieces were in a highly decrepit state and Gould spent many years documenting, repairing and restoring them, without compensation for his efforts. Gould was the first to designate the timepieces from H1 to H5, initially calling them No.1 to No.5. Unfortunately, Gould made modifications and repairs that would not pass today&#x27;s standards of good museum conservation practice, although most Harrison scholars give Gould credit for having ensured that the historical artifacts survived as working mechanisms to the present time. Gould wrote &quot;The Marine Chronometer&quot;, published in 1923, which covered the history of chronometers from the Middle Ages to the 1920s, and which included detailed descriptions of Harrison&#x27;s work and the subsequent evolution of the chronometer. The book remains the authoritative work on the marine chronometer. Today the restored H1, H2, H3, and H4 timepieces can be seen on display in the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. H1, H2, and H3 still work: H4 is kept in a stopped state because, unlike the first three, it requires oil for lubrication and so will degrade as it runs. H5 is owned by the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers of London, and was previously on display at the Clockmakers&#x27; Museum in the Guildhall, London, as part of the Company&#x27;s collection; since 2015 the collection has been displayed in the Science Museum, London.

In the final years of his life, John Harrison wrote about his research into musical tuning and manufacturing methods for bells. His tuning system (a meantone system derived from pi), is described in his pamphlet &quot;A Description Concerning Such Mechanism ... (CSM)&quot;. The system challenged the traditional view that harmonics occur at integer frequency ratios and in consequence all music using this tuning produces low-frequency beating. In 2002, Harrison&#x27;s last manuscript, &quot;A true and short, but full Account of the Foundation of Musick, or, as principally therein, of the Existence of the Natural Notes of Melody&quot;, was rediscovered in the US Library of Congress. His theories on the mathematics of bell manufacturing (using &quot;Radical Numbers&quot;) are yet to be clearly understood.

One of the controversial claims of his last years was that of being able to build a land clock more accurate than any competing design. Specifically, he claimed to have designed a clock capable of keeping accurate time to within one second over a span of 100 days. At the time, such publications as &quot;The London Review of English and Foreign Literature&quot; ridiculed Harrison for what was considered an outlandish claim. Harrison drew a design but never built such a clock himself, but in 1970 Martin Burgess, a Harrison expert and himself a clockmaker, studied the plans and endeavored to build the timepiece as drawn. He built two versions, dubbed Clock A and Clock B. Clock A became the Gurney Clock which was given to the city of Norwich in 1975, while Clock B lay unfinished in his workshop for decades until it was acquired in 2009 by Donald Saff. The completed Clock B was submitted to the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich for further study. It was found that Clock B could potentially meet Harrison&#x27;s original claim, so the clock&#x27;s design was carefully checked and adjusted. Finally, over a 100-day period from 6 January to 17 April 2015, Clock B was secured in a transparent case in the Royal Observatory and left to run untouched, apart from regular winding. Upon completion of the run, the clock was measured to have lost only 5/8 of a second, meaning Harrison&#x27;s design was fundamentally sound. If we ignore the fact that this clock uses materials such as duraluminium and invar unavailable to Harrison, had it been built in 1762, the date of Harrison&#x27;s testing of his H4, and run continuously since then without correction, it would now ( 2025) be slow by just minutes and seconds. Guinness World Records has declared Martin Burgess&#x27; Clock B the &quot;most accurate mechanical clock with a pendulum swinging in free air.&quot;

== In literature, television, drama and music ==
In 1995, inspired by a Harvard University symposium on the longitude problem organized by the National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors, Dava Sobel wrote a book about Harrison&#x27;s work. &quot;Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time&quot; became the first popular bestseller on the subject of horology. &quot;The Illustrated Longitude&quot;, in which Sobel&#x27;s text was accompanied by 180 images selected by William J. H. Andrewes, appeared in 1998. The book was dramatised for UK television by Charles Sturridge in a Granada Productions 4 episode series for Channel 4 in 1999, under the title &quot;Longitude&quot;. It was broadcast in the US later in the same year by co-producer A&amp;E. The production starred Michael Gambon as Harrison and Jeremy Irons as Gould. Sobel&#x27;s book was the basis for a PBS NOVA episode entitled &quot;Lost at Sea: The Search for Longitude&quot;.

In 1998, British composer Harrison Birtwistle wrote the piano piece &quot;Harrison&#x27;s clocks&quot; which contains musical depictions of Harrison&#x27;s various clocks. Composer Peter Graham&#x27;s piece &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Dream&quot; is about Harrison&#x27;s forty-year quest to produce an accurate clock. Graham worked simultaneously on the brass band and wind band versions of the piece, which received their first performances just four months apart in October 2000 and February 2001 respectively.

<text>Julia Carolyn Child (née McWilliams; August 15, 1912 – August 13, 2004) was an American chef, author, and television personality. She is recognized for having brought French cuisine to the American public with her debut cookbook, &quot;Mastering the Art of French Cooking&quot;, and her subsequent television programs, the most notable of which was &quot;The French Chef&quot;, which premiered in 1963.

== Early life ==
Child was born Julia Carolyn McWilliams in Pasadena, California, on August 15, 1912. Child&#x27;s father was John McWilliams Jr. (1880–1962), a Princeton University graduate and prominent land manager. Child&#x27;s mother was Julia Carolyn (&quot;Caro&quot;) Weston (1877–1937), a paper-company heiress and daughter of Byron Curtis Weston, a lieutenant governor of Massachusetts. Child was the eldest of three, followed by a brother, John McWilliams III, and sister, Dorothy Cousins.

Child attended Polytechnic School and Westridge School from 4th grade to 9th grade in Pasadena, California. In high school, Child was sent to the Katherine Branson School in Ross, California, which was at the time a boarding school. Child played tennis, golf, and basketball as a youth.

Child also played sports while attending Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, from which she graduated in 1934 with a major in history. At the time she graduated, she planned to become a novelist, or perhaps a magazine writer. Following her graduation from college, Child moved to New York City, where she worked for a time as a copywriter for the advertising department of W. &amp; J. Sloane. She was still hoping to become a novelist.

While Child grew up in a family with a cook, she did not observe or learn cooking from this person, and she would not learn until she met her husband-to-be, Paul, who grew up in a family very interested in food.

==Career==
=== Second World War ===
Child joined the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in 1942 after finding that at tall, she was too tall to enlist in the Women&#x27;s Army Corps (WACs) or in the U.S. Navy&#x27;s WAVES. She began her OSS career as a typist at its headquarters in Washington, D.C., but, because of her education and experience, soon was given a position as a top-secret researcher working directly for the head of OSS, General William J. Donovan.

As a research assistant in the Secret Intelligence division, Child typed over 10,000 names on white note cards to keep track of officers. For a year, she worked at the OSS Emergency Sea Rescue Equipment Section (ESRES) in Washington, D.C. as a file clerk and then as an assistant to developers of a shark repellent needed to ensure that sharks would not explode ordnance targeting German U-boats. When Child was asked to solve the problem of too many OSS underwater explosives being set off by curious sharks, &quot;Child&#x27;s solution was to experiment with cooking various concoctions as a shark repellent,&quot; which were sprinkled in the water near the explosives and repelled sharks. Still in use today, the experimental shark repellent &quot;marked Child&#x27;s first foray into the world of cooking.&quot;

During 1944–1945, Child was posted to Kandy, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), where her responsibilities included &quot;registering, cataloging and channeling a great volume of highly classified communications&quot; for the OSS&#x27;s clandestine stations in Asia. She was later posted to Kunming, China, where she received the Emblem of Meritorious Civilian Service as head of the Registry of the OSS Secretariat.

For her service, Child received an award that cited her many virtues, including her &quot;drive and inherent cheerfulness&quot;. As with other OSS records, her file was declassified in 2008. Unlike other files, Child&#x27;s complete file is available online.

While she was in Kandy, she met Paul Cushing Child, who was also an OSS employee. The two later married on September 1, 1946, in Lumberville, Pennsylvania, later moving to Washington, D.C.. Paul, a New Jersey native who had lived in Paris as an artist and poet, was known for his sophisticated palate and had introduced his wife to fine cuisine. He joined the United States Foreign Service, and, in 1948, the couple moved to Paris after the State Department assigned Paul there as an exhibits officer with the United States Information Agency. The couple had no children.

===Post-war France===
Child repeatedly recalled her first meal at La Couronne in Rouen as a culinary revelation. Once, she had described the meal of oysters, sole meunière, and fine wine to &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;an opening up of the soul and spirit for me.&quot; In 1951, she graduated from the famous Cordon Bleu cooking school in Paris and later studied privately with Max Bugnard and other master chefs. She joined the women&#x27;s cooking club &quot;Le Cercle des Gourmettes&quot;, through which she met Simone Beck, who was writing a French cookbook for Americans with her friend Louisette Bertholle. Beck proposed that Child work with them to make the book appeal to Americans. In 1951, Child, Beck, and Bertholle began to teach cooking to American women in Child&#x27;s Paris kitchen, calling their informal school &quot;L&#x27;école des trois gourmandes&quot; (The School of the Three Food Lovers). For the next decade, as the Childs moved around Europe and finally to Cambridge, Massachusetts, the three researched and repeatedly tested recipes. Child translated the French into English, making the recipes detailed, interesting, and practical.

In 1963, the Childs built a home near the Provence town of Plascassier in the hills above Cannes on property belonging to co-author Beck and her husband, Jean Fischbacher. The Childs named it &quot;La Pitchoune&quot;, a Provençal word meaning &quot;the little one&quot; but over time the property was often affectionately referred to simply as &quot;La Peetch&quot;.

In his New York Times best-selling book, &quot;Dearie: The Remarkable Life of Julia Child&quot;, author Bob Spitz stated that Child was diagnosed with breast cancer in the mid-60s. She had a mastectomy on February 28, 1968.

===Media career===
The three would-be authors initially signed a contract with publisher Houghton Mifflin, which later rejected the manuscript for seeming too much like an encyclopedia. When it was finally published in 1961 by Alfred A. Knopf, the 726-page &quot;Mastering the Art of French Cooking&quot; was a best-seller and received critical acclaim that derived in part from the American interest in French culture in the early 1960s. Lauded for its helpful illustrations and precise attention to detail, and for making fine cuisine accessible, the book is still in print and is considered a seminal culinary work. Following this success, Child wrote magazine articles and a regular column for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; newspaper. She would go on to publish nearly twenty titles under her name and with others. Many, though not all, were related to her television shows. Her last book was the autobiographical &quot;My Life in France&quot;, published posthumously in 2006 and written with her grandnephew, Alex Prud&#x27;homme. The book recounts Child&#x27;s life with her husband, Paul Cushing Child, in postwar France.

===&quot;The French Chef&quot; and related books===
A 1961 appearance on a book review show on what was then the National Educational Television (NET) station of Boston, WGBH-TV (now a major Public Broadcasting Service station), led to the inception of her first television cooking show after viewers enjoyed her demonstration of how to cook an omelette. &quot;The French Chef&quot; debuted as a summer pilot series, on July 26, 1962. This led to the program becoming a regular series, beginning on February 11, 1963, on WGBH, where it was immediately successful. The show ran nationally for ten years and won Peabody and Emmy Awards, including the first Emmy award for an educational program. Though she was not the first television cook, Child was the most widely seen. She attracted the broadest audience with her cheery enthusiasm, distinctively warbly voice, and unpatronizing, unaffected manner. In 1972, &quot;The French Chef&quot; became the first television program to be captioned for the deaf, even though this was done using the preliminary technology of open-captioning.

Child&#x27;s second book, &quot;The French Chef Cookbook,&quot; was a collection of the recipes she had demonstrated on the show. It was soon followed in 1970 by &quot;Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume Two,&quot; again in collaboration with Simone Beck, but not with Louisette Bertholle, with whom the professional relationship had ended. Child&#x27;s fourth book, &quot;From Julia Child&#x27;s Kitchen,&quot; was illustrated with her husband&#x27;s photographs and documented the color series of &quot;The French Chef,&quot; as well as provided an extensive library of kitchen notes compiled by Child during the course of the show.

=== Impact on American households ===
Child had a large impact on American households and housewives. Because of the technology in the 1960s, the show was unedited, causing her blunders to appear in the final version and ultimately lend &quot;authenticity and approachability to television.&quot; According to Toby Miller in &quot;Screening Food: French Cuisine and the Television Palate,&quot; one mother he spoke to said that sometimes &quot;all that stood between me and insanity was hearty Julia Child&quot; because of Child&#x27;s ability to soothe and transport her. In addition, Miller notes that Child&#x27;s show began before the feminist movement of the 1960s, which meant that the issues housewives and women faced were somewhat ignored on television.

===Later career===
In the 1970s and 1980s, she was the star of numerous television programs, including &quot;Julia Child &amp; Company&quot;, &quot;Julia Child &amp; More Company&quot;, and &quot;Dinner at Julia&#x27;s&quot;. For the 1979 book &quot;Julia Child and More Company&quot;, she won a National Book Award in category Current Interest. In 1980, Child started appearing regularly on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;.

In 1981, she founded the American Institute of Wine &amp; Food, with vintners Robert Mondavi and Richard Graff, and others, to &quot;advance the understanding, appreciation and quality of wine and food,&quot; a pursuit she had already begun with her books and television appearances. In 1989, she published what she considered her magnum opus, a book and instructional video series collectively entitled &quot;The Way To Cook&quot;.

During the AIDS crisis of the 1980s, Child went from holding homophobic views to being a passionate AIDS activist, triggered by a close associate succumbing to AIDS.

In the mid-1990s, as part of her work with the American Institute of Wine and Food, Child became increasingly concerned about children&#x27;s food education.

She starred in four more series in the 1990s that featured guest chefs: &quot;Cooking with Master Chefs&quot;, &quot;In Julia&#x27;s Kitchen with Master Chefs&quot;, &quot;Baking with Julia&quot;, and &quot;Julia &amp; Jacques Cooking at Home&quot;. She collaborated with Jacques Pépin many times for television programs and cookbooks. All of Child&#x27;s books during this time stemmed from the television series of the same names.

Child&#x27;s use of ingredients like butter and cream has been questioned by food critics and modern-day nutritionists. She addressed these criticisms throughout her career, predicting that a &quot;fanatical fear of food&quot; would take over the country&#x27;s dining habits, and that focusing too much on nutrition takes the pleasure from enjoying food. In a 1990 interview, Child said, &quot;Everybody is overreacting. If fear of food continues, it will be the death of gastronomy in the United States. Fortunately, the French don&#x27;t suffer from the same hysteria we do. We should enjoy food and have fun. It is one of the simplest and nicest pleasures in life.&quot;

Julia Child&#x27;s kitchen, designed by her husband, was the setting for several of her television shows. It is now on display at the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. Beginning with &quot;In Julia&#x27;s Kitchen with Master Chefs,&quot; the Childs&#x27; home kitchen in Cambridge was fully transformed into a functional set, with TV-quality lighting, three cameras positioned to catch all angles in the room, and a massive center island with a gas stovetop on one side and an electric stovetop on the other, but leaving the rest of the Childs&#x27; appliances alone, including &quot;my wall oven with its squeaking door.&quot; This kitchen backdrop hosted nearly all of Child&#x27;s 1990s television series.

==Later years==

After her friend Simone Beck died in 1991 at the age of 87, Child relinquished La Pitchoune after a month-long stay in June 1992 with her family, her niece, Phila, and close friend and biographer Noël Riley Fitch. She turned the keys over to Jean Fischbacher&#x27;s sister, just as she and Paul had promised nearly 30 years earlier. That year, Child spent five days in Sicily at the invitation of Regaleali Winery. American journalist Bob Spitz spent a brief time with Child during that period while he was researching and writing his then working title, &quot;History of Eating and Cooking in America&quot;. In 1993, Child voiced Dr. Julia Bleeb in the animated film, &quot;We&#x27;re Back! A Dinosaur&#x27;s Story&quot;.

Spitz took notes and made many recordings of his conversation with Child, and these later formed the basis of a secondary biography on Child, published August 7, 2012 (Knopf), five days before the centennial of her birthdate. Paul Child, who was ten years older than his wife, died in 1994 after living in a nursing home for five years following a series of strokes in 1989.

In 2001, Child moved to a retirement community, donating her house and office to Smith College, which later sold the house.

She donated her kitchen, which her husband had designed with high counters to accommodate her height, and which served as the set for three of her television series, to the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of American History, where it is now on display. Her copper pots and pans were on display at Copia in Napa, California, until August 2009 when they were reunited with her kitchen at the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.

==Death==
Child died of kidney failure in Montecito, California, on August 13, 2004, two days before her 92nd birthday. She ended her last book, &quot;My Life in France&quot;, with &quot;...thinking back on it now reminds that the pleasures of the table, and of life, are infinite – toujours bon appétit!&quot; 

==Legacy==

===The Julia Child Foundation===
In 1995, Child established The Julia Child Foundation for Gastronomy and Culinary Arts, a private charitable foundation to make grants to further her life&#x27;s work. The Foundation, originally set up in Massachusetts, later moved to Santa Barbara, California, where it is now headquartered. Inactive until after Julia&#x27;s death in 2004, the Foundation makes grants to other nonprofits. The grants support primarily gastronomy, the culinary arts, and the further development of the professional food world, all matters of paramount importance to Julia Child during her lifetime. The Foundation&#x27;s website provides a dedicated page listing the names of grant recipients with a description of the organization and the grant provided by the Foundation. One of the grant recipients is Heritage Radio Network which covers the world of food, drink, and agriculture.

Beyond making grants, the Foundation was also established to protect Child&#x27;s legacy. Many of these rights are jointly held with other organizations like her publishers and the Schlesinger Library at The Radcliffe Institute at °Harvard University. The Foundation has been active in protecting these posthumous rights. Child was opposed to endorsements, and the Foundation follows a similar policy regarding the use of her name and image for commercial purposes.

===Tributes and homages===

The Julia Child rose, known in the UK as the &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; rose, is a golden butter/gold floribunda rose named after Child.

The exhibits in the West Wing (1 West) of the National Museum of American History address science and innovation. They include &quot;Bon Appétit! Julia Child&#x27;s Kitchen.&quot;

On September 26, 2014, the U.S. Postal Service issued 20 million copies of the &quot;Celebrity Chefs Forever&quot; stamp series, which featured portraits by Jason Seiler of five American chefs: Child, Joyce Chen, James Beard, Edna Lewis, and Felipe Rojas-Lombardi.

 Smith College used the proceeds from the sale of Child&#x27;s house in Cambridge to partially fund an architecturally dramatic campus center that opened in 2003. On November 17, 2022, it honored her by naming it the Julia McWilliams Child &#x27;34 Campus Center.

==Awards and nominations==

==In popular culture==

Child was a favorite of audiences from the moment of her television debut on public television in 1963, and she was a familiar part of American culture and the subject of numerous references, including numerous parodies in television and radio programs and skits. Her great success on air may have been tied to her refreshingly pragmatic approach to the genre, &quot;I think you have to decide who your audience is. If you don&#x27;t pick your audience, you&#x27;re lost because you&#x27;re not really talking to anybody. My audience is people who like to cook, who want to really learn how to do it.&quot;

In 1996, Child was ranked No. 46 on TV Guide&#x27;s 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time.

===On stage===
* Jean Stapleton portrayed Child in a 1989 one-woman short musical play, &quot;Bon Appétit!&quot;, based on one of Child&#x27;s televised cooking lessons, with music by American opera composer Lee Hoiby. The title derived from her famous TV sign-off &quot;Bon appétit!&quot;

===In film===
* A film titled &quot;Primordial Soup With Julia Child&quot; was on display at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum&#x27;s &quot;Life in the Universe&quot; gallery from 1976 until the gallery closed.
* Produced by WGBH, a one-hour feature documentary, &quot;Julia Child! America&#x27;s Favorite Chef&quot;, was aired as the first episode of the 18th season of the PBS series &quot;American Masters&quot; (2004). The film combined archive footage of Child with current footage from those who influenced and were influenced by her life and work.
* &quot;Julie &amp; Julia&quot; (2009) is a film adapted by Nora Ephron from Child&#x27;s memoir &quot;My Life in France&quot; and from Julie Powell&#x27;s memoir. Meryl Streep plays Child. Streep won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role in a Musical or Comedy.
* &quot;Keep On Cooking – Julia Child Remixed&quot; (2012): A video produced for PBS by musician and filmmaker John D. Boswell as part of the &quot;PBS Icons Remixed&quot; series in commemoration of Child&#x27;s 100th birthday. Child&#x27;s voice is auto-tuned to a melody derived from vocal samples, with synchronized video clips from Child&#x27;s various television series.
* &quot;Julia&quot; (2021) is a documentary, which chronicles Child&#x27;s life. It was directed and produced by Julie Cohen and Betsy West.

===On television===
* Child was the inspiration for Judy Graubart&#x27;s character &quot;Julia Grownup,&quot; hostess of the parody cooking show &quot;Here&#x27;s Cooking At You,&quot; on the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop program, &quot;The Electric Company,&quot; during its transmissions from 1971 to 1977. 
* In 1978, Child and Jacques Pépin were guests on the NBC talk show &quot;Tomorrow with Tom Snyder.&quot; The program was to include a segment with the two chefs preparing food. Before taping the show, Child borrowed Pépin&#x27;s knife to cut something and accidentally sliced her finger. Tom Snyder was horrified that Child had injured herself, but Child insisted on continuing the program with her bandaged finger. Child told Snyder that, during the taping, Pépin would do the cooking, and Child would taste the dishes. Although Child did not want the television audience to know about her injury, during the taping, Snyder asked Child about her cut finger. After the show, Pépin and Child went to the hospital, where Child received sutures on her sliced finger. Afterwards, Child and Pépin dined at L&#x27;Ermitage. &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; writers saw the &quot;Tomorrow&quot; episode with Child and thought it would make a funny sketch. The writers took Child&#x27;s relatively minor mishap and transformed it into a major accident. Child is parodied by Dan Aykroyd, who is a fan of Julia Child. In the sketch, Aykroyd—as Julia Child—continued with a cooking show despite ludicrously profuse bleeding from a cut to his thumb, and eventually expired while advising, &quot;Save the liver.&quot; Child had a videocassette copy of the episode, and she reportedly loved this sketch so much she showed it to friends at parties.
* She appears in an episode of &quot;This Old House&quot; as designer of the kitchen. &quot;This Old House&quot; was launched in 1979 by Russell Morash, who helped create &quot;The French Chef with Julia Child&quot;.
* On March 14, 2022, the Food Network began a new series called &quot;The Julia Child Challenge&quot;. The series is based in a replica of Julia&#x27;s kitchen modified to allow eight contestants (all home cooks) to compete at the same time in a multi-episode cooking challenge. Each episode revolves around one or more episode of one of Child&#x27;s cooking shows with clips of them interspersed into the contents of the competition. The winner will receive a scholarship to a cooking school in Paris.
* In late March 2022, HBO Max began airing &quot;Julia&quot;, a television series based on Child&#x27;s life starring Sarah Lancashire in the title role.

===Online===

* In 2002, Child was the inspiration for &quot;The Julie/Julia Project&quot;, a popular cooking blog by Julie Powell that was the basis of Powell&#x27;s bestselling book, &quot;Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen,&quot; published in 2005, the year following Child&#x27;s death. The paperback version of the book was retitled &quot;Julie and Julia: My Year of Cooking Dangerously.&quot; The blog and book, along with Child&#x27;s own memoir &quot;My Life in France&quot;, in turn inspired the 2009 feature film &quot;Julie &amp; Julia.&quot; Child is reported to have been unimpressed by Powell&#x27;s blog, believing Powell&#x27;s determination to cook every recipe in &quot;Mastering the Art of French Cooking&quot; in a year to be a stunt. In an interview, Child&#x27;s editor, Judith Jones, said of Powell&#x27;s blog: &quot;Flinging around four-letter words when cooking isn&#x27;t attractive, to me or Julia. She didn&#x27;t want to endorse it. What came through on the blog was somebody who was doing it almost for the sake of a stunt.&quot;
* On March 15, 2016, Twitch started to stream Child&#x27;s show &quot;The French Chef&quot;. This event was in celebration of both the launch of the cooking section of Twitch and the anniversary of Child&#x27;s graduation from Le Cordon Bleu.
* In May 2016, Epic Rap Battles of History made an episode featuring Julia Child in a rap battle against Gordon Ramsay, gaining over 48 million views.

<text>James Andrews Beard (May 5, 1903 – January 21, 1985) was an American chef, cookbook author, teacher and television personality. He pioneered television cooking shows, taught at The James Beard Cooking School in New York City and Seaside, Oregon, and lectured widely. He emphasized American cooking, prepared with fresh and wholesome American ingredients, to a country just becoming aware of its own culinary heritage. Beard taught and mentored generations of professional chefs and food enthusiasts. He published more than twenty books, and his memory is honored by his foundation&#x27;s annual James Beard Awards.

==Early life and education==

=== Family ===
James Andrews Beard was born in Portland, Oregon, on May 5, 1903, to Elizabeth and John Beard. His British-born mother operated the Gladstone Hotel, and his father worked at the city&#x27;s customs house. The family vacationed on the Pacific coast in Gearhart, Oregon. 

Beard&#x27;s earliest memory of food was at the 1905 Lewis and Clark Exposition, when he was two years old. In his memoir he recalled:
I was taken to the exposition two or three times. The thing that remained in my mind above all others—I think it marked my life—was watching Triscuits and shredded wheat biscuits being made. Isn&#x27;t that crazy? At two years old that memory was made. It intrigued the hell out of me.

At age three Beard was bedridden with malaria, and the illness gave him time to focus on the food prepared by his mother and Jue-Let, the family&#x27;s Chinese cook. According to Beard he was raised by Jue-Let and Thema, his Chinese nanny, who instilled in him a passion for Chinese culture. Beard reportedly &quot;[attributed] much of his upbringing to Jue-Let,&quot; whom he referred to as his Chinese godfather.

===Education===
Beard graduated from Portland&#x27;s Washington High School in 1920. In the same year he briefly attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon. He was expelled for homosexuality in 1922, having had relationships with &quot;one or more male students and a professor.&quot; The college granted Beard an honorary degree in 1976.

After leaving Reed, he traveled from Portland to Liverpool aboard a British freighter, spending subsequent years living and traveling in Europe. In 1923, he joined a theatrical troupe and studied voice and theater. He also spent time in Paris, where he experienced French cuisine at its bistros and central market, Les Halles. In France, he also had the opportunity to enjoy sexual freedom, having a short relationship with a young man. From this period and the widespread influence of French food culture, he became a Francophile. In 1927 he returned to the US, spending time in Portland, Hollywood, and New York attempting to start a career in acting, costume and set design, and radio.

==Career==
Beard moved to New York City in 1937. Unlucky in the theater, he and friend Bill Rhodes capitalized on the cocktail party craze by opening Hors d&#x27;Oeuvre, Inc., a catering company. This led to lecturing, teaching, writing, and the realization &quot;that part of his mission [as a food connoisseur] was to defend the pleasure of real cooking and fresh ingredients against the assault of the Jell-O-mold people and the domestic scientists.&quot; He published his first cookbook in 1940: &quot;Hors D&#x27;Oeuvre and Canapés&quot;, a compilation of his catering recipes. According to fellow cooking enthusiast Julia Child, this book put him on the culinary map.

World War II rationing ended Beard&#x27;s catering business. He enlisted in the Army and was trained as a cryptographic specialist. Because he had hoped to serve in the hotel management division of the Army Quartermaster Corps, he sought and obtained release from the Army in 1943 based on a regulation applying to men over age 38.

From August 1946 to May 1947, he hosted &quot;I Love to Eat&quot;, a live television cooking show on NBC, beginning his ascent as an American food authority.

In 1952, when Helen Evans Brown published her &quot;Helen Brown&#x27;s West Coast Cook Book&quot;, Beard wrote her a letter igniting a friendship that lasted until Brown&#x27;s death. The two, along with her husband Phillip, developed a friendship which was both professional and personal. Beard and Brown became like siblings, admonishing and encouraging each other, as well as collaborating.
According to the James Beard Foundation website, &quot;In 1955, he established The James Beard Cooking School. He continued to teach cooking to men and women for the next thirty years, both at his own schools (in New York City and Seaside, Oregon), and around the country at women&#x27;s clubs, other cooking schools, and civic groups. He was a tireless traveler, bringing his message of good food, honestly prepared with fresh, wholesome, American ingredients, to a country just becoming aware of its own culinary heritage.&quot;
Beard brought French cooking to the American middle and upper classes during the 1950s, appearing on TV as a cooking personality. David Kamp (who discusses Beard at length in his book, &quot;The United States of Arugula&quot;) noted that Beard&#x27;s was the first cooking show on TV. He compares Dione Lucas&#x27; cooking show and school with Beard&#x27;s, noting that their prominence during the 1950s marked the emergence of a sophisticated, New York-based, nationally and internationally known food culture. Kamp wrote, &quot;It was in this decade [the 1950s] that Beard made his name as &quot;James Beard&quot;, the brand name, the face and belly of American gastronomy.&quot; He noted that Beard met Alice B. Toklas on a trip to Paris, indicative of the network of fellow food celebrities who would follow him during his life and carry on his legacy after his death.

Beard made endorsement deals to promote products that he might not have otherwise used or suggested in his own cuisine, including Omaha Steaks, French&#x27;s Mustard, Green Giant Corn Niblets, Old Crow bourbon, Planters Peanuts, Shasta soft drinks, DuPont chemicals, and Adolph&#x27;s Meat Tenderizer. According to Kamp, Beard later felt himself a &quot;gastronomic whore&quot; for doing so. Although he felt that mass-produced food that was neither fresh, local nor seasonal was a betrayal of his gastronomic beliefs, he needed the money for his cooking schools. According to Thomas McNamee, &quot;Beard, a man of stupendous appetites—for food, sex, money, you name it—stunned his subtler colleagues.&quot; In 1981, Beard and friend Gael Greene founded Citymeals-on-Wheels, which continues to help feed the homebound elderly in New York City.

==Personal life==
Julia Child summed up Beard&#x27;s personal life:
Beard was the quintessential American cook. Well-educated and well-traveled during his eighty-two years, he was familiar with many cuisines but he remained fundamentally American. He was a big man, over six feet tall, with a big belly, and huge hands. An endearing and always lively teacher, he loved people, loved his work, loved gossip, loved to eat, loved a good time.
Mark Bittman described him in a manner similar to Child&#x27;s description:In a time when serious cooking meant French Cooking, Beard was quintessentially American, a Westerner whose mother ran a boardinghouse, a man who grew up with hotcakes and salmon and meatloaf in his blood. A man who was born a hundred years ago on the other side of the country, in a city, Portland, that at the time was every bit as cosmopolitan as, say, Allegheny, Pennsylvania.

Beard admitted, &quot;until I was about forty-five, I guess I had a really violent temper.&quot;

Beard was gay. According to Beard&#x27;s memoir, &quot;By the time I was seven, I knew that I was gay. I think it&#x27;s time to talk about that now.&quot; Beard came out in 1981, in &quot;Delights and Prejudices&quot;, a revised version of his memoir. Of Beard&#x27;s &quot;most significant romantic attachments&quot; was his &quot;lifetime companion&quot; of thirty years, Gino Cofacci, who was given an apartment in Beard&#x27;s townhouse in the will and died in 1989, and Beard&#x27;s former cooking school assistant Carl Jerome. John Birdsall, a food writer who won two James Beard Awards, ties Beard&#x27;s sexuality to his food aesthetics, and said in 2016 it was only recently that people are accepting the connection.

==Death==
James Beard died of heart failure on January 21, 1985, at his home in New York City at age 81. He was cremated and his ashes scattered over the beach in Gearhart, Oregon, where he spent summers as a child.

In 1995, &quot;Love and Kisses and a Halo of Truffles: Letters from Helen Evans Brown&quot; was published. It contained excerpts from Beard&#x27;s bi-weekly correspondence from 1952 to 1964 with friend and fellow chef Helen Evans Brown. The book gave insight to their relationship as well as the way that they developed ideas for recipes, projects and food.

==Foundation==
After Beard&#x27;s death in 1985, Julia Child wanted to preserve his home in New York City as the gathering place that it had been during his life. Peter Kump, a former student of Beard&#x27;s and the founder of the Institute of Culinary Education (formerly Peter Kump&#x27;s New York Cooking School), spearheaded efforts to purchase the house and create the James Beard Foundation.
Beard&#x27;s renovated brownstone at 167 West 12th Street in Greenwich Village, is North America&#x27;s only historic culinary center. It is preserved as a gathering place where the press and general public could appreciate the talents of emerging and established chefs.

In 1986, the James Beard Foundation was established in Beard&#x27;s honor to provide scholarships to aspiring food professionals and champion the American culinary tradition which Beard helped create. &quot;Since its inception in 1991, the James Beard Foundation Scholarship Program has awarded over $4.6 million in financial aid to a variety of students—from recent high school graduates, to working culinary professionals, to career changers. Recipients come from many countries, and enhance their knowledge at schools around the world.&quot;

The annual James Beard Foundation Awards celebrate fine cuisine around Beard&#x27;s birthday. Held on the first Monday in May, the awards ceremony honors American chefs, restaurants, journalists, cookbook authors, restaurant designers and electronic-media professionals. It culminates in a reception featuring tastings of signature dishes of more than 30 of the foundation&#x27;s chefs. A quarterly magazine, &quot;Beard House&quot;, is a compendium of culinary journalism.

The foundation was affected by scandals; in 2004 its head, Leonard Pickell, resigned and was imprisoned for grand larceny and in 2005 the board of trustees resigned. During this period, chef and writer Anthony Bourdain called the foundation &quot;a kind of benevolent shakedown operation.&quot; A new board of trustees instituted an ethics policy and chose a new president, Susan Ungaro, to prevent future problems.

<text>James Alan McPherson (September 16, 1943 – July 27, 2016) was an American essayist and short-story writer. He was the first African-American writer to win the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and was included among the first group of artists who received a MacArthur Fellowship. At the time of his death, McPherson was a professor emeritus of fiction at the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop.

==Life and work==

===Early life and education===
McPherson was born in Savannah, Georgia, on September 16, 1943, the second of four children. His father was a master electrician (the first African-American so recognized in Georgia), and his mother (born Mabel Small) was a maid. While McPherson was growing up, his father struggled with alcohol and spent time in jail. In the essay &quot;Going Up To Atlanta,&quot; McPherson describes the many odd jobs he took on during this time to help support his mother, brother, and sisters. But it was his discovery of the &quot;colored branch&quot; of the public library that changed his life. When he started reading books, McPherson learned that words, even without pictures, &quot;gave up their secret meanings, spoke of other worlds, made me know that pain was a part of other people&#x27;s lives.&quot;

He attended Morgan State University from 1963 to 1964 before receiving his undergraduate degree in history and English from Morris Brown College in 1965. In 1968, McPherson received a LL.B. from Harvard Law School, where he partially financed his studies by working as a janitor.

While at Harvard, McPherson studied fiction writing with Alan Lebowitz in 1967 and worked on his stories when he found some spare time. It was the publication of his short story &quot;Gold Coast&quot; in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, following an &quot;open reading&quot; competition they had sponsored, that first brought him public recognition. During this period, McPherson established a close working relationship with Edward Weeks, an editor at &quot;The Atlantic Monthly,&quot; which led to McPherson becoming a contributing editor at that magazine in 1969. His fiction would go on to appear in numerous journals and magazines throughout the following decade. Many of his stories were anthologized, beginning with &quot;Gold Coast&quot; when it appeared in &quot;The Best American Stories&quot; in 1969. His first collection of short stories, &quot;Hue and Cry&quot;, was published by Atlantic Monthly Press that year.

In 1971, he received an M.F.A. in fiction from the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop, where he studied briefly with the short-story writer and novelist Richard Yates. While studying creative writing, McPherson decided not to practice law; however, he would continue to utilize his legal training in various projects. In a 1972 &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; essay, he exposed exploitative business practices against black homeowners, presaging the later work of Ta-Nehisi Coates.

During this period in his life, he gained the attention of Ralph Ellison (1913–1994), who became both a friend and mentor to the young McPherson. In December 1970, McPherson interviewed Ellison for an &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; cover story and collaborated with him on the essay &quot;Invisible Man.&quot; This relationship with Ellison would have a lasting influence on his own life and work, as McPherson acknowledges in his essay &quot;Gravitas,&quot; which he published in 1999 as both a tribute to the (then) recently deceased writer, and to observe the posthumous publication of Ellison&#x27;s novel &quot;Juneteenth&quot; that same year. McPherson also initiated a friendship with Albert Murray shortly after the publication of Murray&#x27;s &quot;The Omni-Americans: Black Experience &amp; American Culture&quot; (1970).

===Career===

McPherson taught English and creative writing at the University of California, Santa Cruz (assistant professor; 1969–1971), the Harvard University summer school (1972), Morgan State University (assistant professor; 1975–1976) and the University of Virginia (associate professor; 1976–1981) before joining the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop in 1981, with whom he was associated for the remainder of his life. He served as acting director of the program for two years following the death of Frank Conroy in 2005. Following the publication of &quot;Elbow Room&quot; (his final collection of fiction) in 1977, McPherson primarily focused on his teaching career, with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; characterizing him as being &quot;only slightly more gregarious than J.D. Salinger.&quot;

He was also a visiting scholar at Yale Law School (1978–1979) and a fellow at Stanford University&#x27;s Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (1997–1998; 2002–2003). Significantly, McPherson lectured in Japan (at Meiji University and Chiba University), a country whose society and culture profoundly affected him. It was in Japan, he once wrote, where he went to lay down &quot;the burden carried by all black Americans, especially the males.&quot;

&quot;Crabcakes: A Memoir&quot;, his first original work since &quot;Elbow Room&quot;, was published in 1998. His final book (&quot;A Region Not Home: Reflections on Exile&quot;, an essay collection) was published in 2000.

==Recognition==
In 1972, McPherson was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. He received the Pulitzer Prize in 1978 for his short story collection &quot;Elbow Room&quot;, becoming the first black writer to receive the program&#x27;s Fiction Prize.

He was the recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship in 1981, a member of the first group (21 recipients in all) ever selected for one of the MacArthur Foundation&#x27;s so-called &quot;genius grants.&quot; In 1995, McPherson was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2000, John Updike selected McPherson&#x27;s short story &quot;Gold Coast&quot; for his collection &quot;Best American Short Stories of the Century&quot; (Houghton Mifflin).

In October 2011, McPherson was honored as the inaugural recipient of the Paul Engle Award from the Iowa City UNESCO City of Literature. According to the citation:

In 2020, an Iowa City park was renovated and renamed after McPherson. Previously Creekside Park, James Alan McPherson Park serves as a memorial and a gathering space for the community.

== Death ==
McPherson died in hospice on July 27, 2016, in Iowa City, Iowa, due to complications of pneumonia. He was 72. He is survived by a daughter, Rachel McPherson (a child from his first marriage to the former Sarah Charlton, which had ended in divorce); a son from another relationship, Benjamin Miyamoto; a sister; and a brother.

<text>Jerome Klapka Jerome (2 May 1859 – 14 June 1927) was an English writer and humorist, best known for the comic travelogue &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; (1889). Other works include the essay collections &quot;Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow&quot; (1886) and &quot;Second Thoughts of an Idle Fellow&quot;; &quot;Three Men on the Bummel&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot;; and several other novels. Jerome was born in Walsall, England, and, although he was able to attend grammar school, his family suffered from poverty at times, as did he as a young man trying to earn a living in various occupations. In his twenties, he was able to publish some work, and success followed. He married in 1888, and the honeymoon was spent on a boat on the River Thames; he published &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; soon afterwards. He continued to write fiction, non-fiction and plays over the next few decades, though never with the same level of success.

== Early life ==
Jerome was born at Belsize House, 1 Caldmore Road, in Caldmore, Walsall, England. He was the fourth child of Marguerite Jones and Jerome Clapp (who later renamed himself Jerome Clapp Jerome), an ironmonger and lay preacher who dabbled in architecture. He had two sisters, Paulina and Blandina, and one brother, Milton, who died at an early age. Jerome was registered as Jerome Clapp Jerome, like his father&#x27;s amended name, and the Klapka appears to be a later variation (after the exiled Hungarian general György Klapka). The family fell into poverty owing to bad investments in the local mining industry, and debt collectors visited often, an experience that Jerome described vividly in his autobiography &quot;My Life and Times&quot; (1926). At the age of two Jerome moved with his parents to Stourbridge, Worcestershire, then later to east London.

The young Jerome attended St Marylebone Grammar School. He wished to go into politics or be a Man of Letters, but the death of his father when Jerome was 13 and of his mother when he was 15 forced him to quit his studies and find work to support himself. He was employed at the London and North Western Railway, initially collecting coal that fell along the railway, and he remained there for four years.

== Acting career and early literary works ==
Jerome was inspired by his elder sister Blandina&#x27;s love for the theatre, and he decided to try his hand at acting in 1877, under the stage name Harold Crichton. He joined a repertory theatre troupe that produced plays on a shoestring budget, often drawing on the actors&#x27; own meagre resources — Jerome was penniless at the time — to purchase costumes and props. After three years on the road with no evident success, the 21-year-old Jerome decided that he had had enough of stage life and sought other occupations. He tried to become a journalist, writing essays, satires, and short stories, but most of these were rejected. Over the next few years, he was a school teacher, a packer, and a solicitor&#x27;s clerk. Finally, in 1885, he had some success with &quot;On the Stage — and Off&quot; (1885), a comic memoir of his experiences with the acting troupe, followed by &quot;Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow&quot; (1886), a collection of humorous essays which had previously appeared in the newly founded magazine, &quot;Home Chimes&quot;, the same magazine that would later serialise &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot;.

On 21 June 1888, Jerome married Georgina Elizabeth Henrietta Stanley Marris (&quot;Ettie&quot;), nine days after she divorced her first husband. She had a daughter from her previous five-year marriage nicknamed Elsie (her actual name was also Georgina). The honeymoon took place on the River Thames &quot;in a little boat,&quot; a fact that was to have a significant influence on his next and most important work, &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot;.

== &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; and later career ==

Jerome sat down to write &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; as soon as the couple returned from their honeymoon. In the novel, his wife was replaced by his longtime friends George Wingrave (George) and Carl Hentschel (Harris). This allowed him to create comic (and non-sentimental) situations which were nonetheless intertwined with the history of the Thames region. The book, published in 1889, became an instant success and has never been out of print. Its popularity was such that the number of registered Thames boats went up fifty per cent in the year following its publication, and it contributed significantly to the Thames becoming a tourist attraction. In its first twenty years alone, the book sold over a million copies worldwide. It has been adapted into films, television, radio shows, stage plays, and even a musical. Its writing style has influenced many humourists and satirists in England and elsewhere.

With the financial security that the sales of the book provided, Jerome was able to dedicate all of his time to writing. He wrote a number of plays, essays, and novels, but was never able to recapture the success of &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot;. In 1892, he was chosen by Robert Barr to edit &quot;The Idler&quot; (over Rudyard Kipling). The magazine was an illustrated satirical monthly catering to gentlemen (who, following the theme of the publication, appreciated idleness). In 1893, he founded &quot;To-Day&quot;, but had to withdraw from both publications because of financial difficulties and a libel suit.

Jerome&#x27;s play &quot;Biarritz&quot; had a run of two months at the Prince of Wales Theatre between April and June 1896.

In 1898, a short stay in Germany inspired &quot;Three Men on the Bummel&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot;, reintroducing the same characters in the setting of a foreign bicycle tour. The book was nonetheless unable quite to recapture the sheer comic energy and historic rootedness of its celebrated predecessor (lacking as it does the unifying thread that is the river Thames itself) and it has enjoyed only modest success by comparison. However, some of the individual comic vignettes that make up &quot;Bummel&quot; have been praised as highly as those of &quot;Boat&quot;.

In 1902, he published the novel &quot;Paul Kelver&quot;, which is widely regarded as autobiographical. His 1908 play &quot;The Passing of the Third Floor Back&quot; introduced a more sombre and religious Jerome. The main character was played by one of the leading actors of the time, Johnston Forbes-Robertson, and the play was a tremendous commercial success. It was twice made into film, in 1918 and in 1935. However, the play was condemned by critics; Max Beerbohm described it as &quot;vilely stupid&quot; and as written by a &quot;tenth-rate writer&quot;.

== First World War and last years ==

Jerome volunteered to serve his country at the outbreak of the First World War, but being 55 years old, he was rejected by the British Army. Eager to serve in some capacity, he volunteered as an ambulance driver for the French Army. In 1926, Jerome published his autobiography, &quot;My Life and Times&quot;. Shortly afterwards, the Borough of Walsall conferred on him the title Freeman of the Borough. During these last years, Jerome spent more time at his farmhouse Gould&#x27;s Grove south-east of Ewelme near Wallingford.

Jerome suffered a paralytic stroke and a cerebral haemorrhage in June 1927, on a motoring tour from Devon to London via Cheltenham and Northampton. He lay in Northampton General Hospital for two weeks before dying on 14 June. He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium and his ashes buried at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Ewelme, Oxfordshire. Elsie, Ettie and his sister Blandina are buried beside him. His gravestone reads &quot;For we are labourers together with God&quot;. A small museum dedicated to his life and works was opened in 1984 at his birth home in Walsall, but it closed in 2008 and the contents were returned to Walsall Museum.

== Legacy ==
* &quot;Lazy Thoughts of a Lazy Girl&quot;, a book by the pseudonymous &quot;Jenny Wren&quot;, was published in 1891. The author is anonymous. The book has the same form as &quot;Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow&quot;, but is from the point of view of a woman.

Takamine was born in Takaoka, Toyama Prefecture, in November 1854. His father was a doctor; his mother a member of a family of &quot;sake&quot; brewers. He spent his childhood in Kanazawa, capital of present-day Ishikawa Prefecture in central Honshū. He learned English as a child from a Dutch family in Nagasaki, and so always spoke English with a Dutch accent. He was educated in Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo, graduating from the Tokyo Imperial University in 1879. He did postgraduate work at University of Glasgow and Anderson College in Scotland until 1883.

==Career==

===Japan===
In 1883, Takamine returned to Japan and joined the division of chemistry at the newly established Department of Agriculture and Commerce until 1887. He then founded the Tokyo Artificial Fertilizer Company, where he later isolated the enzyme takadiastase, an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of starch. Takamine developed his diastase from &quot;koji,&quot; a fungus used in the manufacture of soy sauce and &quot;miso&quot;. Its Latin name is &quot;Aspergillus oryzae&quot;, and it is a &quot;designated national fungus&quot; (&quot;kokkin&quot;) in Japan.

===United States===

In 1884, Takamine went as co-commissioner of the World Cotton Centennial Exposition to New Orleans, where he met Lafcadio Hearn and 18 year old Caroline Field Hitch, his future wife. In 1885, he became the temporary Chief of the Japanese Patent Office and helped to lay the foundations of patent administration. He founded he Tokyo Artificial Fertilizer Company, importing large amounts of phosphate
from Charleston, South Carolina. In 1890, he emigrated with his wife and two sons to Chicago. 

He established his own research laboratory in New York City but licensed the exclusive production rights for takadiastase to one of the largest US pharmaceutical companies, Parke-Davis. This turned out to be a shrewd move as he became a millionaire in a relatively short time and by the early 20th century was estimated to be worth $30 million.

In 1894, Takamine applied for, and was granted, a US patent titled &quot;Process of Making Diastatic Enzyme&quot; (), the first patent on a microbial enzyme in the United States.

In 1901, he isolated and purified the hormone adrenaline, which became the first effective bronchodilator for asthma from animal glands, becoming the first to accomplish this for a glandular hormone. 

In 1904, the Emperor Meiji of Japan honored Takamine with an unusual gift. In the context of the St. Louis World Fair (Louisiana Purchase Exposition), the Japanese government had replicated a historical Japanese structure, the &quot;Pine and Maple Palace&quot; (&quot;Shofu-den&quot;), modelled after the Kyoto Imperial Coronation Palace of 1,300 years ago. This structure was given to Dr. Takamine in grateful recognition of his efforts to further friendly relations between Japan and the United States. He had the structure transported in sections from Missouri to his summer home in upstate New York, seventy-five miles north of New York City. In 1909, the structure served as a guest house for Prince Kuni Kuniyoshi and Princess Kuni of Japan, who were visiting the area. Although the property was sold in 1922, the reconstructed structure remained in its serene setting. In 2008, it still continues to be one of the undervalued tourist attractions of New York&#x27;s Sullivan County.

In 1905, Takamine founded the Nippon Club, which was for many years located at 161 West 93rd Street in Manhattan.

Takamine devoted his life to maintaining goodwill between the US and Japan.

In 1912, the mayor of Tokyo (Yukio Ozaki) and Jokichi Takamine gifted cherry blossom trees, which were planted in the West Potomac Park surrounding the Tidal Basin in Washington, DC.

This illustration is linked to Jōkichi Takamine&#x27;s involvement in the gifting of the cherry blossom trees to Washington, DC in 1912, which has evolved into the National Cherry Blossom Festival which is celebrated yearly.

==Personal life==

On August 10, 1887, Takamine travelled to the US and married Caroline Field Hitch in New Orleans. They had two sons Jokichi Takamine, born 1888 in Tokyo, Japan, and Ebenezer Takashi Takamine born in 1889. The family emigrated to the US arriving in Chicago in December 1890. Due to her influence he converted to Catholicism. According to historical records, he would maintain this faith throughout his life.

==Awards and honors==
*In 1899, Takamine was awarded an honorary Doctorate in Engineering by what is now the University of Tokyo.
*On April 18, 1985, the Japan Patent Office selected him as one of Ten Japanese Great Inventors.

==In popular culture==
As of 2011, two films about the life of Takamine have been made by . In the 2010 film &quot;&quot; Takamine was portrayed by Masaya Kato. A sequel titled &quot;Takamine&quot;, also directed by Ichikawa and starring Hatsunori Hasegawa, was released in 2011.

As of 2009, the Takamine home in Kanazawa could still be seen. It was relocated to near the grounds of Kanazawa Castle in 2001.

<doc id="16452" wikidata="Q1384317" url="?curid=16452" title="Jacob Neusner">
<text>Jacob Neusner (July 28, 1932 – October 8, 2016) was an American academic scholar of Judaism. He was named as one of the most published authors in history, having written or edited more than 900 books.

Neusner&#x27;s application of form criticism—a methodology derived from scholars of the New Testament—to Rabbinic texts was influential, but subject to criticism. Neusner&#x27;s grasp of Rabbinic Hebrew and Aramaic has been challenged within academia.

==Early life and study==
Neusner was born in Hartford, Connecticut, to Reform Jewish parents. He graduated from William H. Hall High School in West Hartford. He then attended Harvard University, where he met Harry Austryn Wolfson and first encountered Jewish religious texts. After graduating from Harvard in 1953, Neusner spent a year at the University of Oxford.

Neusner then attended the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, where he was ordained as a Conservative Jewish rabbi. After spending a year at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, he returned to the Jewish Theological Seminary and studied the Talmud under Saul Lieberman, who would later write a famous, and highly negative, critique of Neusner&#x27;s translation of the Jerusalem Talmud. He graduated in 1960 with a master&#x27;s degree. Later that year, he received a doctorate in religion from Columbia University.

==Career==

After his studies, Neusner briefly taught at Dartmouth College. Neusner also held positions at University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, Brandeis University, and Brown University. From 1990-2000 he was distinguished research professor at the University of South Florida.

In 1994, Neusner began teaching at Bard College, working there until 2014. While at Bard College, he founded the Institute for Advanced Theology with Bruce Chilton.

He was a life member of Clare Hall, Cambridge University. He was the only scholar to have served on both the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts.

Neusner died on October 8, 2016, at the age of 84.

== Scholarship ==

Neusner&#x27;s research centered on rabbinic Judaism of the Mishnaic and Talmudic eras. His work focused on bringing the study of rabbinical text into nonreligious educational institutions and treating them as non-religious documents.
Neusner&#x27;s five-volume &quot;History of the Jews in Babylonia&quot;, published between 1965 and 1969, is said to be the first to consider the Babylonian Talmud in its Iranian context. Neusner studied Persian and Middle Persian to do so.

Neusner, with his contemporaries, translated into English nearly the entire Rabbinic canon. This work has opened up many Rabbinic documents to scholars of other fields unfamiliar with Hebrew and Aramaic, within the academic study of religion, as well as in ancient history, culture and Near and Middle Eastern Studies.

In addition to his work on Rabbinic texts, Neusner was involved in Jewish Studies and Religious Studies. Neusner saw Judaism as &quot;not particular but exemplary, and Jews not as special but (merely) interesting.&quot;

=== Interfaith work ===
Neusner also wrote a number of works exploring the relationship of Judaism to other religions. His &quot;A Rabbi Talks with Jesus&quot; attempts to establish a religiously sound framework for Judaic-Christian interchange. It earned the praise of Pope Benedict XVI and the nickname &quot;The Pope&#x27;s Favorite Rabbi&quot;. In his book &quot;Jesus of Nazareth,&quot; Benedict referred to it as &quot;by far the most important book for the Jewish-Christian dialogue in the last decade.&quot;

== Political views ==
Neusner called himself a Zionist, but also said &quot;Israel’s flag is not mine. My homeland is America.&quot; He was culturally conservative, and opposed feminism and affirmative action.

Neusner was a signer of the conservative Christian Cornwall Declaration on Environmental Stewardship, which expresses concern over what it called &quot;unfounded or undue concerns&quot; of environmentalists such as &quot;fears of destructive manmade global warming, overpopulation, and rampant species loss&quot;.

== Critical assessment of Neusner&#x27;s work ==
Neusner&#x27;s original adoption of form criticism to the rabbinic texts proved highly influential both in North American and European studies of early Jewish and Christian texts. His later detailed studies of Mishnaic law lack the densely footnoted historical approach characteristic of his earlier work. As a result, these works, focusing on literary form, tend to ignore contemporary external sources and modern scholarship dealing with these issues. The irony was that his approach adopted the analytic methodology developed by Christian scholars for the New Testament, while denying there was any relationship between the Judeo-Christian corpus and rabbinic works, the latter being treated as isolates detached from their broader historical contexts.

A number of scholars in his field of study were critical of this phase in his work.

Some were critical of his methodology, and asserted that many of his arguments were circular or attempts to prove &quot;negative assumptions&quot; from a lack of evidence, while others concentrated on Neusner&#x27;s reading and interpretations of Rabbinic texts, finding that his account was forced and inaccurate.

Neusner&#x27;s view that the Second Commonwealth Pharisees were a sectarian group centered on &quot;table fellowship&quot; and ritual food purity practices, and lacked interest in wider Jewish moral values or social issues, has been criticized by E. P. Sanders, Solomon Zeitlin and Hyam Maccoby.

Some scholars questioned Neusner&#x27;s grasp of Rabbinic Hebrew and Aramaic. The most famous and biting criticism came from one of Neusner&#x27;s former teachers, Saul Lieberman, about Neusner&#x27;s translation of the Jerusalem Talmud. Lieberman wrote, in an article circulated before his death and then published posthumously: &quot;...one begins to doubt the credibility of the translator [Neusner]. And indeed after a superficial perusal of the translation, the reader is stunned by the translator&#x27;s ignorance of rabbinic Hebrew, of Aramaic grammar, and above all of the subject matter with which he deals.&quot; Ending his review, Lieberman states &quot;I conclude with a clear conscience: The right place for [Neusner&#x27;s] English translation is the waste basket&quot; while at the same time qualifying that &quot;[i]n fairness to the translator I must add that his various essays on Jewish topics are meritorious. They abound in brilliant insights and intelligent questions.&quot; Lieberman highlights his criticism as being of Neusner&#x27;s &quot;ignorance of the original languages,&quot; which Lieberman claims even Neusner was originally &quot;well aware of&quot; inasmuch as he had previously relied on responsible English renderings of rabbinic sources, e.g., Soncino Press, before later choosing to create his own renderings of rabbinic texts. Lieberman&#x27;s views were seconded by Morton Smith, another teacher who resented Neusner&#x27;s criticism of his views that Jesus was a homosexual magician.

Neusner thought Lieberman&#x27;s approach reflected the closed mentality of a yeshiva-based education that lacked familiarity with modern formal textual-critical techniques, and he eventually got round to replying to Lieberman&#x27;s charges by writing in turn an equally scathing monograph entitled: &quot;Why There Never Was a Talmud of Caesarea: Saul Lieberman’s Mistakes&quot; (1994). In it he attributed to Lieberman &#x27;obvious errors of method, blunders in logic&#x27; and argued that Lieberman&#x27;s work showed a systematic inability to accomplish critical research.

<text>Joachim I Nestor (21 February 1484 – 11 July 1535) was a Prince-elector of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (1499–1535), the fifth member of the House of Hohenzollern. His nickname was taken from King Nestor of Greek mythology.

== Biography ==
The eldest son of John Cicero, Elector of Brandenburg, Joachim received an excellent education under the supervision of Dietrich von Bülow, Bishop of Lebus and Chancellor of Frankfurt University. He became Elector of Brandenburg upon his father&#x27;s death in January 1499, and soon afterwards married Elizabeth of Denmark, daughter of King John of Denmark in 1502. They had five children:

# Joachim II Hector (9 January 1505 – 3 January 1571)
# Anna (1507 – 19 June 1567) married Albert VII, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow
# Elisabeth (24 August 1510 – 25 May 1558) in 1525 married firstly Eric I of Brunswick-Kalenberg and in 1545 secondly Poppo XII, count of Henneberg
# Margaret (29 September 1511 – 1577), married firstly on 23 January 1530 George I, Duke of Pomerania and after his death secondly in 1534 John V, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst.
# John (3 August 1513 – 13 January 1571)

Joachim took some part in the political complications of the Scandinavian kingdoms, but the early years of his reign were mainly spent in the administration of his electorate, where he succeeded in restoring some degree of order through stern measures. He also improved the administration of justice, aided the development of commerce, and was sympathetic to the needs to the towns. On the approach of the 1519 imperial election, Joachim&#x27;s vote was eagerly solicited by the partisans of King Francis I of France, and Charles of Habsburg. Having treated with both parties, and received lavish promises from them, he appears to have hoped to be Emperor himself; but when the election came, he turned to the winning side and voted for Charles. In spite of this, relations between the Emperor and the Elector were not friendly, and during the next few years Joachim was frequently in communication with Charles&#x27; enemies.

In the course of Hohenzollern power politics Joachim Nestor and his brother managed to get the latter, Albert of Mainz, first onto the sees of Magdeburg and then its suffragan of Halberstadt, both prince-bishoprics also comprising princely territories. Since prince-episcopal sees were so influential, competing candidates usually ran for them. A candidature could turn into a bribery competition, without ever knowing exactly how much competitors paid to obtain office. The expenditures involved, as far as they exceeded one&#x27;s own potential, were usually advanced by creditors and had then to be recovered by levying dues from the subjects and parishioners in the prince-bishoprics and dioceses that were just acquired. The acquisition in 1514 of the very influential Archbishopric-Electorate of Mainz for Albert was a coup that provided the Hohenzollerns with control over two of the seven electoral votes in imperial elections and many suffragan dioceses to levy dues.

According to canon law, Albert was too young to hold such a position and since he would not give up the archiepiscopal see of Magdeburg (in order to terminate the accumulation of archdioceses, which was also prohibited by canon law), the Hohenzollerns had to dispense ever greater briberies at the Holy See. This exhausted their means and caused them to incur vast debts with the Fuggers.

To assist in the recovery of the enormous expenditures employed to assist Albert, mediators stipulated with the Holy See that Pope Leo X would allow Albert to sell indulgences to the believers in his archdioceses and their suffragans. The sales proceeds had to cover the amortisation and servicing of the debts; a share for the Holy See, for allowing this exploitation of the believers; the expenditure paid from the Hohenzollerns own pockets; and the charges involved with the sales.

The neighbouring Electorate of Saxony also bid for the See of Mainz, but failed to secure it. The Saxon elector Frederick the Wise had debts of his own as a result, but no see to show for it and no privilege to sell indulgences to recover his expenditures. Frustrated, he forbade the sale of indulgences in his electorate and allowed Martin Luther to polemicize against them.

Joachim Nestor, in contrast, became known as a pugnacious adherent of Roman Catholic orthodoxy. Joachim Nestor&#x27;s brother, Archbishop Albert, was the initial object of Luther&#x27;s attack. He urged on the Emperor the need to enforce the Edict of Worms, and at several diets was prominent among the enemies of the Reformers.

A patron of learning, Joachim Nestor established the Viadrina university of Frankfurt (Oder) in 1506. He promoted Georg von Blumenthal, the &quot;Pillar of Catholicism&quot;, as Chancellor of Frankfurt University, Bishop of Lebus and a Privy Counsellor. He was among those who met at Dessau in July 1525 and was a member of the league established at Halle in November 1533. But against his will, his wife joined her brother Christian II of Denmark in converting to Lutheranism. In 1528 she fled for safety to Saxony. Joachim Nestor experienced the mortification of seeing Protestantism also favoured by other members of his family. He died at Stendal in 1535.

<text>John Keats (31 October 1795 – 23 February 1821) was an English poet of the second generation of Romantic poets, along with Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley. His poems had been in publication for less than four years when he died of tuberculosis at the age of 25. They were indifferently received in his lifetime, but his fame grew rapidly after his death. By the end of the century, he was placed in the canon of English literature, strongly influencing many writers of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood; the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; of 1888 described his &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; as &quot;one of the final masterpieces&quot;. 

Keats had a style &quot;heavily loaded with sensualities&quot;, notably in the series of odes. Typically of the Romantics, he accentuated extreme emotion through natural imagery. Today his poems and letters remain among the most popular and analysed in English literature – in particular &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot;, &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;, &quot;Sleep and Poetry&quot; and the sonnet &quot;On First Looking into Chapman&#x27;s Homer&quot;. Jorge Luis Borges named his first time reading Keats an experience he felt all his life.

==Early life and education, 1795–1810==
John Keats was born in Moorgate, London, on 31 October 1795, to Thomas and Frances Keats (née Jennings). There is little evidence of his exact birthplace. Although Keats and his family seem to have marked his birthday on 29 October, baptism records give the date as the 31st. He was the eldest of four surviving children; his younger siblings were George (1797–1841), Thomas (1799–1818), and Frances Mary &quot;Fanny&quot; (1803–1889), who later married the Spanish author . 

Another son was lost in infancy. His father first worked as an ostler at the stables attached to the &quot;Swan and Hoop Inn&quot; owned by his father-in-law, John Jennings, an establishment he later managed, and where the growing family lived for some years. Keats believed he was born at the inn, a birthplace of humble origins, but there is no evidence to support this. The Globe pub now occupies the site, a few yards from modern Moorgate station. Keats was baptised at St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate, and sent to a local dame school as a child.
His parents wished to send their sons to Eton or Harrow, but the family decided they could not afford the fees. In the summer of 1803, John was sent to board at John Clarke&#x27;s school in Enfield, close to his grandparents&#x27; house. The small school had a liberal outlook and a progressive curriculum more modern than the larger, more prestigious schools. In the family atmosphere at Clarke&#x27;s, Keats developed an interest in classics and history, which would stay with him throughout his short life.

The headmaster&#x27;s son, Charles Cowden Clarke, also became an important mentor and friend, introducing Keats to Renaissance literature, including Tasso, Spenser, and Chapman&#x27;s translations. The young Keats was described by his friend Edward Holmes as a volatile character, &quot;always in extremes&quot;, given to indolence and fighting. At 13 he began focusing his energy on reading and study, winning his first academic prize in midsummer 1809.

In April 1804, when Keats was eight, his father died from a skull fracture after falling from his horse while returning from a visit to Keats and his brother George at school. Thomas Keats died intestate. Frances remarried two months later, but left her new husband soon afterwards, and the four children went to live with a grandmother, Alice Jennings, in the village of Edmonton.

In March 1810, when Keats was 14, his mother died of tuberculosis, leaving the children in their grandmother&#x27;s custody. She appointed two guardians, Richard Abbey and John Sandell, for them. That autumn, Keats left Clarke&#x27;s school to be an apprentice with Thomas Hammond, a surgeon and apothecary who was a neighbour and the doctor of the Jennings family. Keats lodged in the attic above the surgery, at 7 Church Street, until 1813. Cowden Clarke, who remained close to Keats, called this period &quot;the most placid time in Keats&#x27; life.&quot;

From 1814 Keats had two bequests, held in trust for him until his 21st birthday. £800 was willed by his grandfather John Jennings. Also Keats&#x27;s mother left a legacy of £8000 to be equally divided among her living children. It seems he was not told of the £800 and probably knew nothing of it as he never applied for it. Historically, blame has often been laid on Abbey as legal guardian, but he may also have been unaware of it. William Walton, solicitor for Keats&#x27;s mother and grandmother, definitely knew and had a duty of care to relay the information to Keats. It seems he did not, though it would have made a critical difference to the poet&#x27;s expectations. Money was always a great concern and difficulty, as he struggled to stay out of debt and make his way in the world independently.

==Career==
===Medical training and writing poetry===
In October 1815, having finished his five-year apprenticeship with Hammond, Keats registered as a medical student at Guy&#x27;s Hospital, now part of King&#x27;s College London, and began studying there. Within a month, he was accepted as a dresser at the hospital assisting surgeons during operations, the equivalent of a junior house surgeon today. It was a significant promotion, that marked a distinct aptitude for medicine; and it brought greater responsibility and a heavier workload. 

Keats&#x27;s long and expensive medical training with Hammond and at Guy&#x27;s Hospital led his family to assume he would pursue a lifelong career in medicine, assuring financial security, and it seems that, at this point, Keats had a genuine desire to become a doctor. He lodged near the hospital, at 28 St Thomas&#x27;s Street in Southwark, with other medical students, including Henry Stephens who gained fame as an inventor and ink magnate.

Keats&#x27;s training took up increasing amounts of his writing time and he became increasingly ambivalent about it. He felt he was facing a stark choice. He had written his first extant poem, &quot;An Imitation of Spenser&quot;, in 1814, when he was 19. Now, strongly drawn by ambition, inspired by fellow poets such as Leigh Hunt and Lord Byron, and beleaguered by family financial crises, he suffered periods of depression. His brother George wrote that John &quot;feared that he should never be a poet, &amp; if he was not he would destroy himself.&quot; In 1816, Keats received his apothecary&#x27;s licence, which made him eligible to practise as an apothecary, physician and surgeon, but before the end of the year he informed his guardian that he resolved to be a poet, not a surgeon.

===Publication and literary circles===
Although he continued his work and training at Guy&#x27;s, Keats devoted more and more time to the study of literature, experimenting with verse forms, particularly the sonnet. In May 1816, Leigh Hunt agreed to publish the sonnet &quot;O Solitude&quot; in his magazine &quot;The Examiner&quot;, a leading liberal magazine of the day. This was the first appearance of Keats&#x27;s poetry in print; Charles Cowden Clarke called it his friend&#x27;s red letter day, first proof that Keats&#x27; ambitions were valid. Among his poems of 1816 was &quot;To My Brothers&quot;. That summer, Keats went with Clarke to the seaside town of Margate to write. There he began &quot;Calidore&quot; and initiated an era of great letter writing. On returning to London, he took lodgings at 8 Dean Street, Southwark, and braced himself to study further for membership of the Royal College of Surgeons.

In October 1816 Clarke introduced Keats to the influential Leigh Hunt, a close friend of Byron and Shelley. Five months later came the publication of &quot;Poems&quot;, the first volume of Keats&#x27;s verse, which included &quot;I stood tiptoe&quot; and &quot;Sleep and Poetry&quot;, both strongly influenced by Hunt. The book was a critical failure, arousing little interest, although Reynolds reviewed it favourably in &quot;The Champion&quot;. Clarke commented that the book &quot;might have emerged in Timbuctoo.&quot; 

Keats&#x27;s publishers, Charles and James Ollier, felt ashamed of it. Keats immediately changed publishers to Taylor and Hessey in Fleet Street. Unlike the Olliers, Keats&#x27;s new publishers were enthusiastic about his work. Within a month of the publication of &quot;Poems&quot; they were planning a new Keats volume and had paid him an advance. Hessey became a steady friend to Keats and made the company&#x27;s rooms available for young writers to meet. Their publishing lists came to include Coleridge, Hazlitt, Clare, Hogg, Carlyle and Charles Lamb.

Through Taylor and Hessey, Keats met their Eton-educated lawyer, Richard Woodhouse, who advised them on literary as well as legal matters and was deeply impressed by &quot;Poems&quot;. Although he noted that Keats could be &quot;wayward, trembling, easily daunted,&quot; Woodhouse was convinced of Keats&#x27;s genius, a poet to support as he became one of England&#x27;s greatest writers. Soon after they met, the two became close friends, and Woodhouse started to collect Keatsiana, documenting as much as he could about the poetry. This archive survives as one of the main sources of information on Keats&#x27;s work. Andrew Motion represents him as Boswell to Keats&#x27;s Johnson, ceaselessly promoting his work, fighting his corner and spurring his poetry to greater heights. In later years, Woodhouse was one of the few to accompany Keats to Gravesend, Kent, to embark on his final trip to Rome.

Despite the bad reviews of &quot;Poems&quot;, Hunt published the essay &quot;Three Young Poets&quot; (Shelley, Keats, and Reynolds) and the sonnet &quot;On First Looking into Chapman&#x27;s Homer&quot;, foreseeing great things to come. He introduced Keats to many prominent men in his circle, including the editor of &quot;The Times&quot;, Thomas Barnes; the writer Charles Lamb; the conductor Vincent Novello; and the poet John Hamilton Reynolds, who would become a close friend. Keats also met regularly with William Hazlitt, a powerful literary figure of the day. It was a turning point for Keats, establishing him in the public eye as a figure in what Hunt termed &quot;a new school of poetry&quot;. 

At this time Keats wrote to his friend Bailey, &quot;I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart&#x27;s affections and the truth of the imagination. What imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth.&quot; This passage would eventually be transmuted into the concluding lines of &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot;: Beauty is truth, truth beauty&#x27; – that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know&quot;. In early December 1816, under the heady influence of his artistic friends, Keats told Abbey he had decided to give up medicine in favour of poetry, to Abbey&#x27;s fury. Keats had spent a great deal on his medical training, and despite his state of financial hardship and indebtedness, made large loans to friends such as the painter Benjamin Haydon. Keats would go on to lend £700 to his brother George. By lending so much, Keats could no longer cover the interest of his own debts.

===Travelling and ill health===
Having left his training at the hospital, suffering from a succession of colds, and unhappy with living in damp rooms in London, Keats moved with his brothers into rooms at 1 Well Walk in the village of Hampstead in April 1817. There John and George nursed their tubercular brother Tom. The house was close to Hunt and others of his circle in Hampstead, and to Coleridge, respected elder of the first wave of Romantic poets, then living in Highgate. On 11 April 1818, Keats reported that he and Coleridge had taken a long walk on Hampstead Heath. In a letter to his brother George, he wrote that they had talked about &quot;a thousand things, ... nightingales, poetry, poetical sensation, metaphysics.&quot; Around this time he was introduced to Charles Wentworth Dilke and James Rice.

In June 1818, Keats began a walking tour of Scotland, Ireland and the Lake District with Charles Armitage Brown. Keats&#x27;s brother George and his wife Georgiana accompanied them to Lancaster and then continued to Liverpool, from where they migrated to America, living in Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky, until 1841, when George&#x27;s investments failed. Like Keats&#x27;s other brother, they both died penniless and racked by tuberculosis, for which there was no effective treatment until the next century. 

In July, while on the Isle of Mull, Keats caught a bad cold and &quot;was too thin and fevered to proceed on the journey.&quot; After returning south in August, Keats continued to nurse Tom, so exposing himself to infection. Some have suggested this was when tuberculosis, his &quot;family disease&quot;, took hold. &quot;Consumption&quot; was not identified as a disease with a single infectious origin until 1820. There was considerable stigma attached to it, as it was often tied with weakness, repressed sexual passion or masturbation. Keats &quot;refuses to give it a name&quot; in his letters. Tom Keats died on 1 December 1818.

===Wentworth Place: annus mirabilis===

John Keats moved to the newly built Wentworth Place, owned by his friend Charles Armitage Brown. It was on the edge of Hampstead Heath, ten minutes&#x27; walk south of his old home in Well Walk. The winter of 1818–19, though a difficult period for the poet, marked the beginning of his &quot;annus mirabilis&quot; in which he wrote his most mature work. He had been inspired by a series of recent lectures by Hazlitt on English poets and poetic identity and had also met Wordsworth. Keats may have seemed to his friends to be living on comfortable means, but in reality he was borrowing regularly from Abbey and his friends.

He composed five of his six great odes at Wentworth Place in April and May and, although it is debated in which order they were written, &quot;Ode to Psyche&quot; opened the published series. According to Brown, &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; was composed under a plum tree in the garden. 

Brown wrote, &quot;In the spring of 1819 a nightingale had built her nest near my house. Keats felt a tranquil and continual joy in her song; and one morning he took his chair from the breakfast-table to the grass-plot under a plum-tree, where he sat for two or three hours. When he came into the house, I perceived he had some scraps of paper in his hand, and these he was quietly thrusting behind the books. On inquiry, I found those scraps, four or five in number, contained his poetic feelings on the song of our nightingale.&quot; Dilke, co-owner of the house, strenuously denied the story, printed in Richard Monckton Milnes&#x27; 1848 biography of Keats, dismissing it as &#x27;pure delusion&#x27;.

&quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn&quot; and &quot;Ode on Melancholy&quot; were inspired by sonnet forms and probably written after &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot;. Keats&#x27;s new and progressive publishers Taylor and Hessey issued &quot;Endymion&quot;, which Keats dedicated to Thomas Chatterton, a work that he termed &quot;a trial of my Powers of Imagination&quot;. It was damned by the critics, giving rise to Byron&#x27;s quip that Keats was ultimately &quot;snuffed out by an article&quot;, suggesting that he never truly got over it. A particularly harsh review by John Wilson Croker appeared in the April 1818 edition of the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;. 

John Gibson Lockhart writing in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, described &quot;Endymion&quot; as &quot;imperturbable drivelling idiocy&quot;. With biting sarcasm, Lockhart advised, &quot;It is a better and a wiser thing to be a starved apothecary than a starved poet; so back to the shop Mr John, back to plasters, pills, and ointment boxes.&quot; 

It was Lockhart at &quot;Blackwoods&quot; who coined the defamatory term &quot;the Cockney School&quot; for Hunt and his circle, which included both Hazlitt and Keats. The dismissal was as much political as literary, aimed at upstart young writers deemed uncouth for their lack of education, non-formal rhyming and &quot;low diction&quot;. They had not attended Eton, Harrow or Oxbridge and they were not from the upper classes.

In 1819 Keats wrote &quot;The Eve of St. Agnes&quot;, &quot;La Belle Dame sans Merci&quot;, &quot;Hyperion&quot;, &quot;Lamia&quot; and a play, &quot;Otho the Great&quot;, critically damned and not performed until 1950. The poems &quot;Fancy&quot; and &quot;Bards of passion and of mirth&quot; were inspired by the garden of Wentworth Place. In September, very short of money and in despair considering taking up journalism or a post as a ship&#x27;s surgeon, he approached his publishers with a new book of poems. 

They were unimpressed with the collection, finding the presented versions of &quot;Lamia&quot; confusing, and describing &quot;St Agnes&quot; as having a &quot;sense of pettish disgust&quot; and &quot;a &#x27;Don Juan&#x27; style of mingling up sentiment and sneering&quot; concluding it was &quot;a poem unfit for ladies&quot;. The final volume Keats lived to see published, &quot;Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems&quot;, was published in July 1820. It received greater acclaim than had &quot;Endymion&quot; or &quot;Poems&quot;, finding favourable notices in both &quot;The Examiner&quot; and &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;. It came to be recognised as one of the most important poetic works ever published.

Wentworth Place now houses the Keats House museum.

===Isabella Jones and Fanny Brawne, 1817–1820===

Keats befriended Isabella Jones in May 1817, while on holiday in the village of Bo Peep, near Hastings. She is described as beautiful, talented and widely read, not of the top flight of society yet financially secure, an enigmatic figure who would become a part of Keats&#x27;s circle. Throughout their friendship Keats never hesitated to own his sexual attraction to her, although they seemed to enjoy circling each other rather than offering commitment. He writes that he &quot;frequented her rooms&quot; in the winter of 1818–19, and in his letters to George says that he &quot;warmed with her&quot; and &quot;kissed her&quot;. 

The trysts may have been a sexual initiation for Keats according to Bate and Robert Gittings. Jones inspired and was a steward of Keats&#x27;s writing. The themes of &quot;The Eve of St. Agnes&quot; and &quot;The Eve of St Mark&quot; may well have been suggested by her, the lyric &quot;Hush, Hush!&quot; [&quot;o sweet Isabel&quot;] was about her, and that the first version of &quot;Bright Star&quot; may have originally been for her. In 1821, Jones was one of the first in England to be notified of Keats&#x27;s death.

Letters and drafts of poems suggest that Keats first met Frances (Fanny) Brawne between September and November 1818. It is likely that the 18-year-old Brawne visited the Dilke family at Wentworth Place before she lived there. She was born in the hamlet of West End, now in the district of West Hampstead, on 9 August 1800. Like Keats&#x27;s grandfather, her grandfather kept a London inn, and both lost several family members to tuberculosis. She shared her first name with both Keats&#x27;s sister and mother, and had a talent for dress-making and languages as well as a natural theatrical bent. During November 1818 she developed an intimacy with Keats, but it was shadowed by the illness of Tom Keats, whom John was nursing through this period.
On 3 April 1819, Brawne and her widowed mother moved into the other half of Dilke&#x27;s Wentworth Place, and Keats and Brawne were able to see each other every day. Keats began to lend Brawne books, such as Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, and they would read together. He gave her the love sonnet &quot;Bright Star&quot; (perhaps revised for her) as a declaration. It was a work in progress which he continued until the last months of his life, and the poem came to be associated with their relationship. &quot;All his desires were concentrated on Fanny&quot;. From this point there is no further documented mention of Isabella Jones. 

Sometime before the end of June, he arrived at some sort of understanding with Brawne, far from a formal engagement as he still had too little to offer, with no prospects and financial stricture. Keats endured great conflict knowing his expectations as a struggling poet in increasingly hard straits would preclude marriage to Brawne. Their love remained unconsummated; jealousy for his &#x27;star&#x27; began to gnaw at him. Darkness, disease and depression surrounded him, reflected in poems such as &quot;The Eve of St. Agnes&quot; and &quot;La Belle Dame sans Merci&quot; where love and death both stalk. &quot;I have two luxuries to brood over in my walks;&quot; he wrote to her, &quot;your loveliness, and the hour of my death&quot;.

In one of his many hundreds of notes and letters, Keats wrote to Brawne on 13 October 1819: &quot;My love has made me selfish. I cannot exist without you – I am forgetful of every thing but seeing you again – my Life seems to stop there – I see no further. You have absorb&#x27;d me. I have a sensation at the present moment as though I was dissolving – I should be exquisitely miserable without the hope of soon seeing you ... I have been astonished that Men could die Martyrs for religion – I have shudder&#x27;d at it – I shudder no more – I could be martyr&#x27;d for my Religion – Love is my religion – I could die for that – I could die for you.&quot;

Tuberculosis took hold and he was advised by his doctors to move to a warmer climate. In September 1820 Keats left for Rome knowing he would probably never see Brawne again. After leaving he felt unable to write to her or read her letters, although he did correspond with her mother. He died there five months later. None of Brawne&#x27;s letters to Keats survive.

It took a month for the news of his death to reach London, after which Brawne stayed in mourning for six years. In 1833, more than 12 years after his death, she married and went on to have three children; she outlived Keats by more than 40 years.

==Last months: Rome, 1820==
During 1820 Keats displayed increasingly serious symptoms of tuberculosis, suffering two lung haemorrhages in the first few days of February. On first coughing up blood, on 3 February 1820, he said to Charles Armitage Brown, &quot;I know the colour of that blood! It is arterial blood. I cannot be deceived in that colour. That drop of blood is my death warrant. I must die.&quot;

He lost large amounts of blood and was bled further by the attending physician. Hunt nursed him in London for much of the following summer. At the suggestion of his doctors, he agreed to move to Italy with his friend Joseph Severn. On 13 September, they left for Gravesend and four days later boarded the sailing brig &quot;Maria Crowther&quot;. On 1 October the ship landed at Lulworth Bay or Holworth Bay, where the two went ashore; back on board ship he made the final revisions of &quot;Bright Star&quot;. 

The journey was a minor catastrophe: storms broke out, followed by a dead calm that slowed the ship&#x27;s progress. When they finally docked in Naples, the ship was held in quarantine for ten days due to a suspected outbreak of cholera in Britain. Keats reached Rome on 14 November, by which time any hope of the warmer climate he sought had disappeared.
Keats wrote his last letter on 30 November 1820 to Charles Armitage Brown; &quot;Tis the most difficult thing in the world to me to write a letter. My stomach continues so bad, that I feel it worse on opening any book – yet I am much better than I was in Quarantine. Then I am afraid to encounter the proing and conning of any thing interesting to me in England. I have an habitual feeling of my real life having past, and that I am leading a posthumous existence&quot;.

On arrival in Italy, he moved into a villa on the Spanish Steps in Rome, today the Keats–Shelley Memorial House museum. Despite care from Severn and Dr. James Clark, his health rapidly deteriorated. The medical attention Keats received may have hastened his death. In November 1820, Clark declared that the source of his illness was &quot;mental exertion&quot; and that the source was largely situated in his stomach. Clark eventually diagnosed consumption (tuberculosis) and placed Keats on a starvation diet of an anchovy and a piece of bread a day intended to reduce the blood flow to his stomach. He also bled the poet: a standard treatment of the day, but also likely a significant contributor to Keats&#x27;s weakness. 

Severn&#x27;s biographer Sue Brown writes: &quot;They could have used opium in small doses, and Keats had asked Severn to buy a bottle of opium when they were setting off on their voyage. What Severn didn&#x27;t realise was that Keats saw it as a possible resource if he wanted to commit suicide. He tried to get the bottle from Severn on the voyage but Severn wouldn&#x27;t let him have it. Then in Rome he tried again... Severn was in such a quandary he didn&#x27;t know what to do, so in the end he went to the doctor, who took it away. As a result Keats went through dreadful agonies with nothing to ease the pain at all.&quot; Keats was angry with both Severn and Clark when they would not give him laudanum (opium). He repeatedly demanded, &quot;How long is this posthumous existence of mine to go on?&quot;

==Death, 1821==
The first months of 1821 marked a slow and steady decline into the final stage of tuberculosis. His autopsy showed his lung almost disintegrated. Keats was coughing up blood and covered in sweat. Severn nursed him devotedly and observed in a letter how Keats would sometimes cry upon waking to find himself still alive. Severn writes,


John Keats died in Rome on 23 February 1821. His body was buried in the city&#x27;s Protestant Cemetery. His last request was to be placed under a tombstone bearing no name or date, only the words, &quot;Here lies One whose Name was writ in Water.&quot; Severn and Brown erected the stone, which under a relief of a lyre with broken strings, includes the epitaph: 
Severn and Brown added their lines to the stone in protest at the critical reception of Keats&#x27;s work. Hunt blamed his death on the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;″s scathing attack of &quot;Endymion&quot;. As Byron quipped in his narrative poem &quot;Don Juan&quot;;
Seven weeks after the funeral, Shelley memorialised Keats in his poem &quot;Adonais&quot;. Clark saw to a planting of daisies on the grave, saying Keats would have wished it. For public health reasons, the Italian health authorities burnt the furniture in Keats&#x27;s room, scraped the walls and made new windows, doors and flooring. The ashes of Shelley, one of Keats&#x27;s most fervent champions, are buried in the cemetery and Joseph Severn is buried next to Keats. On the site today, Marsh wrote, &quot;In the old part of the graveyard, barely a field when Keats was buried here, there are now umbrella pines, myrtle shrubs, roses, and carpets of wild violets&quot;.

==Reception==
When Keats died at 25, he had been writing poetry seriously for only about six years, from 1814 until the summer of 1820, and publishing for only four. In his lifetime, sales of Keats&#x27;s three volumes of poetry probably amounted to only 200 copies. His first poem, the sonnet &quot;O Solitude&quot;, appeared in &quot;the Examiner&quot; in May 1816, while his collection &quot;Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St. Agnes and other poems&quot; was published in July 1820 before his last visit to Rome. The compression of his poetic apprenticeship and maturity into so short a time is just one remarkable aspect of Keats&#x27;s work.

Although prolific during his short career, and now one of the most studied and admired British poets, his reputation rests on a small body of work, centred on the Odes, and only in the creative outpouring of the last years of his short life was he able to express the inner intensity for which he has been lauded since his death. Keats was convinced that he had made no mark in his lifetime. Aware that he was dying, he wrote to Fanny Brawne in February 1820, &quot;I have left no immortal work behind me – nothing to make my friends proud of my memory – but I have lov&#x27;d the principle of beauty in all things, and if I had had time I would have made myself remember&#x27;d.&quot;

Keats&#x27;s ability and talent was acknowledged by several influential contemporary allies such as Shelley and Hunt. His admirers praised him for thinking &quot;on his pulses&quot;, for having developed a style which was more heavily loaded with sensualities, more gorgeous in its effects, more voluptuously alive than any poet who had come before him: &quot;loading every rift with ore&quot;. Shelley often corresponded with Keats in Rome and loudly declared that Keats&#x27;s death had been brought on by bad reviews in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;. Seven weeks after the funeral he wrote &quot;Adonais&quot;, a despairing elegy, stating that Keats&#x27;s early death was a personal and public tragedy:
Although Keats wrote that &quot;if poetry comes not as naturally as the Leaves to a tree it had better not come at all,&quot; poetry did not come easily to him; his work was the fruit of a deliberate and prolonged classical self-education. He may have possessed an innate poetic sensibility, but his early works were clearly those of a young man learning his craft. His first attempts at verse were often vague, languorously narcotic and lacking a clear eye. His poetic sense was based on the conventional tastes of his friend Charles Cowden Clarke, who first introduced him to the classics, and also came from the predilections of Hunt&#x27;s &quot;Examiner&quot;, which Keats read as a boy. 

Hunt scorned the Augustan or &quot;French&quot; school dominated by Pope and attacked earlier Romantic poets Wordsworth and Coleridge, now in their forties, as unsophisticated, obscure and crude writers. During Keats&#x27;s few years as a published poet, the reputation of the older Romantic school was at its lowest ebb. Keats came to echo these sentiments in his work, identifying himself with a &quot;new school&quot; for a time, somewhat alienating him from Wordsworth, Coleridge and Byron and providing a basis for scathing attacks from &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s&quot; and the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;.

By his death, Keats had therefore been associated with the taints of both old and new schools: the obscurity of first-wave Romantics and uneducated affectation of Hunt&#x27;s &quot;Cockney School&quot;. Keats&#x27;s posthumous reputation mixed the reviewers&#x27; caricature of the simplistic bumbler with the image of a hyper-sensitive genius killed by high feeling, which Shelley later portrayed.

The Victorian sense of poetry as the work of indulgence and luxuriant fancy offered a schema into which Keats was posthumously fitted. Marked as the standard-bearer of sensory writing, his reputation grew steadily and remarkably. His work had the full support of the influential Cambridge Apostles, whose members included the young Tennyson, later a popular Poet Laureate who came to regard Keats as the greatest poet of the 19th century. Constance Naden was a great admirer of his poems, arguing that his genius lay in his &#x27;exquisite sensitiveness to all the elements of beauty&#x27;. 

In 1848, twenty-seven years after Keats&#x27;s death, Richard Monckton Milnes published the first full biography, which helped place Keats within the canon of English literature. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, including Millais and Rossetti, were inspired by Keats and painted scenes from his poems including &quot;The Eve of St. Agnes&quot;, &quot;Isabella&quot; and &quot;La Belle Dame sans Merci&quot;, lush, arresting and popular images which remain closely associated with Keats&#x27;s work.

In 1882, Swinburne wrote in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; that &quot;the Ode to a Nightingale [was] one of the final masterpieces of human work in all time and for all ages&quot;. In the 20th century Keats remained the muse of poets such as Wilfred Owen, who kept his death date as a day of mourning, Yeats and T. S. Eliot. Critic Helen Vendler stated the odes &quot;are a group of works in which the English language finds an ultimate embodiment.&quot; Bate said of &quot;To Autumn&quot;: &quot;Each generation has found it one of the most nearly perfect poems in English&quot; and M. R. Ridley said the ode &quot;is the most serenely flawless poem in our language.&quot;

The largest collection of the letters, manuscripts, and other papers of Keats is in the Houghton Library at Harvard University. Other collections of material are archived at the British Library, Keats House, Hampstead, the Keats–Shelley Memorial House in Rome and the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York. Since 1998 the British Keats-Shelley Memorial Association have annually awarded a prize for romantic poetry. A Royal Society of Arts blue plaque was unveiled in 1896 to commemorate Keats at Keats House.

Jorge Luis Borges named his first encounter with Keats an experience he felt all his life.

===Biographers===
None of Keats&#x27;s biographies were written by people who had known him. Shortly after his death, his publishers announced they would speedily publish &quot;The memoirs and remains of John Keats&quot; but his friends refused to cooperate and argued with each other to such an extent that the project was abandoned. Leigh Hunt&#x27;s &quot;Lord Byron and some of his Contemporaries&quot; (1828) gives the first biographical account, strongly emphasising Keats&#x27;s supposedly humble origins, a misconception which still continues. Given that he was becoming a significant figure within artistic circles, a succession of other publications followed, including anthologies of his many notes, chapters and letters. 

However, early accounts often gave contradictory or biased versions of events and were subject to dispute. His friends Brown, Severn, Dilke, Shelley and his guardian Richard Abbey, his publisher Taylor, Fanny Brawne and many others issued posthumous commentary on Keats&#x27;s life. These early writings coloured all subsequent biography and have become embedded in a body of Keats legend.

Shelley promoted Keats as someone whose achievement could not be separated from agony, who was &#x27;spiritualised&#x27; by his decline and too fine-tuned to endure the harshness of life; the consumptive, suffering image popularly held today. The first full biography was published in 1848 by Richard Monckton Milnes. Landmark Keats biographers since include Sidney Colvin, Robert Gittings, Walter Jackson Bate, Aileen Ward, and Andrew Motion. The idealised image of the heroic romantic poet who battled poverty and died young was inflated by the late arrival of an authoritative biography and the lack of an accurate likeness. Most of the surviving portraits of Keats were painted after his death, and those who knew him held that they did not succeed in capturing his unique quality and intensity.

===Other portrayals===

&quot;John Keats: His Life and Death&quot;, the first major motion picture about the life of Keats, was produced in 1973 by Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. It was directed by John Barnes. John Stride played John Keats and Janina Faye played Fanny Brawne. The 2009 film &quot;Bright Star&quot;, written and directed by Jane Campion, focuses on Keats&#x27;s relationship with Fanny Brawne. Inspired by the 1997 Keats biography by Andrew Motion, Ben Whishaw played Keats and Abbie Cornish played Fanny.

Poet Laureate Simon Armitage wrote &quot;&#x27;I speak as someone...&#x27;&quot; to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Keats&#x27;s death. It was first published in &quot;The Times&quot; on 20 February 2021. In 2007 a sculpture of Keats seated on a bench, by sculptor Stuart Williamson, was unveiled at Guys and Saint Thomas&#x27; Hospital, London by the Poet Laureate, Andrew Motion.

A sculpture of the 21-year-old Keats, by Martin Jennings, was unveiled by Michael Mainelli, the Lord Mayor of London, in Moorgate in the City of London on 31 October 2024, the 229th anniversary of Keats&#x27; birth.

==Letters==

Keats&#x27;s letters were first published in 1848 and 1878. Critics in the 19th century disregarded them as distractions from his poetic works, but in the 20th century they became almost as admired and studied as his poetry, and are highly regarded in the canon of English literary correspondence. T. S. Eliot called them &quot;certainly the most notable and most important ever written by any English poet.&quot; 

Keats spent much time considering poetry itself, its constructs and impacts, displaying a deep interest unusual in his milieu, who were more easily distracted by metaphysics or politics, fashions or science. Eliot wrote of Keats&#x27;s conclusions; &quot;There is hardly one statement of Keats&#x27; about poetry which... will not be found to be true, and what is more, true for greater and more mature poetry than anything Keats ever wrote.&quot;

Few of Keats&#x27;s letters remain from the period before he joined his literary circle. From spring 1817, however, there is a rich record of his prolific and impressive letter-writing skills. He and his friends, poets, critics, novelists, and editors wrote to each other daily, and Keats&#x27;s ideas are bound up in the ordinary, his day-to-day missives sharing news, parody and social commentary. They glitter with humour and critical intelligence. Born of an &quot;unself-conscious stream of consciousness,&quot; they are impulsive, full of awareness of his own nature and his weak spots. 

When his brother George went to America, Keats wrote to him in detail, the body of letters becoming &quot;the real diary&quot; and self-revelation of Keats&#x27;s life, as well as an exposition of his philosophy, with the first drafts of poems containing some of Keats&#x27;s finest writing and thought. Gittings sees them as akin to a &quot;spiritual journal&quot; not written for a specific other, so much as for synthesis.

Keats also reflected on the background and composition of his poetry. Specific letters often coincide with or anticipate the poems they describe. In February to May 1819 he produced many of his finest letters. Writing to his brother George, Keats explored the idea of the world as &quot;the vale of Soul-making&quot;, anticipating the great odes he wrote some months later. In the letters Keats coined ideas such as the Mansion of Many Apartments and the Chameleon Poet, which came to gain common currency and capture the public imagination, though only making single appearances as phrases in his correspondence. The poetical mind, Keats argued:

has no self – it is every thing and nothing – It has no character – it enjoys light and shade;... What shocks the virtuous philosopher, delights the camelion [chameleon] Poet. It does no harm from its relish of the dark side of things any more than from its taste for the bright one; because they both end in speculation. A Poet is the most unpoetical of any thing in existence; because he has no Identity – he is continually in for – and filling some other Body – The Sun, the Moon, the Sea and Men and Women who are creatures of impulse are poetical and have about them an unchangeable attribute – the poet has none; no identity – he is certainly the most unpoetical of all God&#x27;s Creatures.

He used the term negative capability to discuss the state of being in which we are &quot;capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact &amp; reason... [Being] content with half knowledge&quot; where one trusts in the heart&#x27;s perceptions. He wrote later he was &quot;certain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart&#x27;s affections and the truth of Imagination – What the imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth – whether it existed before or not – for I have the same Idea of all our Passions as of Love they are all in their sublime, creative of essential Beauty&quot; constantly returning to what it means to be a poet. &quot;My Imagination is a Monastery and I am its Monk&quot;, Keats notes to Shelley. 

In September 1819, Keats wrote to Reynolds &quot;How beautiful the season is now – How fine the air. A temperate sharpness about it... I never lik&#x27;d the stubbled fields as much as now – Aye, better than the chilly green of spring. Somehow the stubble plain looks warm – in the same way as some pictures look warm – this struck me so much in my Sunday&#x27;s walk that I composed upon it&quot;. The final stanza of his last great ode, &quot;To Autumn&quot;, runs:
&lt;poem&gt;
Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?
Think not of them, thou hast thy music too, –
While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,
And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
&lt;/poem&gt;
&quot;To Autumn&quot; was to become one of the most highly regarded poems in the English language.

There are areas of his life and daily routine that Keats omits. He mentions little of his childhood or his financial straits, being seemingly embarrassed to discuss them. There is no reference to his parents. In his last year, as his health deteriorated, his concerns often give way to despair and morbid obsessions. His letters to Fanny Brawne, published in 1870, focus on the period and emphasise its tragic aspect, giving rise to widespread criticism at the time.

<doc id="16457" wikidata="Q275445" url="?curid=16457" title="Jewish Defense League">
<text>The Jewish Defense League (JDL) is a religious and political organization in the United States and Canada. Its stated goal is to &quot;protect Jews from antisemitism by whatever means necessary&quot;; it has been classified as &quot;right-wing terrorist group&quot; by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) since 2001, and is also designated as hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. According to the FBI, the JDL has been involved in plotting and executing acts of terrorism within the United States. Most terrorist watch groups classify the group as inactive as of 2015.

Founded by Meir Kahane in New York City in 1968, the JDL&#x27;s self-described purpose was to protect Jews from local manifestations of antisemitism. Its criticism of the Soviet Union increased local support for the group, transforming it from a &quot;vigilante club&quot; into an organization with a stated membership numbering over 15,000 at one point. The group took to bombing Arab and Soviet properties in the United States while assassinating a variety of alleged &quot;enemies of the Jewish people&quot; ranging from Arab-American political activists to neo-Nazis. A number of JDL members have been linked to violent, and sometimes deadly, attacks in the United States and in other countries, including the murder of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee regional director Alex Odeh in 1985; the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre in 1994; a plot to assassinate U.S. Representative Darrell Issa in 2001; and a plot to bomb the King Fahad Mosque in Culver City, California. In 1990, Kahane was assassinated by an Egyptian-American gunman at a hotel in New York City.

According to the Anti-Defamation League, the JDL consists only of &quot;thugs and hooligans&quot; and Kahane &quot;preached a radical form of Jewish nationalism which reflected racism, violence, and political extremism,&quot; attitudes that were replicated by his successor Irv Rubin.

==Origins==
In 1968, while Kahane served as the associate editor for &quot;The Jewish Press&quot;, the paper&#x27;s office began receiving numerous calls and letters about crimes being committed against Jews and Jewish institutions. Violence in the New York City area was on the rise, with Jews making up a disproportionately large percentage of the victims. Elderly Jews were being harassed and mugged, storeowners were held up and Jewish teachers were assaulted while Jewish synagogues were defaced and Jewish cemeteries desecrated.

After discussing the matter with a few congregants, Kahane put out an ad in &quot;The Jewish Press&quot; on May 24, 1968, which read: &quot;We are talking of JEWISH SURVIVAL! Are you willing to stand up for democracy and Jewish survival? Join and support the Jewish Defense Corps.&quot; Shortly after, Kahane renamed the group the &quot;Jewish Defense League,&quot; fearing that &quot;Corps&quot; would be construed as too militant. The group&#x27;s declared purpose was: &quot;to combat anti-Semitism in the public and private sectors of life in the United States of America.&quot; Kahane stated that the League was formed to &quot;do the job that the Anti-Defamation League should do but doesn&#x27;t.&quot;

Shortly afterwards, the Jewish Defense League put out a four-page manifesto which stated: &quot;America has been good to the Jew and the Jew has been good to America. A land founded on the principles of democracy and freedom has given unprecedented opportunities to a people devoted to those ideals&quot; yet now finds itself threatened by &quot;political extremism&quot; and &quot;racist militancy.&quot; Furthermore, the manifesto stated that the organization rejects all hate and illegality, believes firmly in law and order, backs police forces and will work actively in the courts to strike down all discrimination. When asked about Jewish Defense League members breaking the law, Kahane responded: &quot;We respect the right and the obligation of the American government to prosecute us and send us to jail. No one gripes about that.&quot;

The group adopted the slogan &quot;Never Again!&quot; which was originally used by the Jewish resistance fighters in the Warsaw ghetto. While the phrase is usually interpreted to mean that the Nazi Holocaust of six million Jews will never be permitted to recur, Kahane claimed that his intention was to declare that Jews should never again be caught by surprise or lulled into a foolish trust in others.

The first Jewish Defense League demonstration took place on August 5, 1968, at New York University with some 15 members chanting: &quot;No Nazis at NYU, Jewish rights are precious too.&quot;

==History==

===1969===

On August 7, the JDL sent members to Passaic, New Jersey, to protect Jewish merchants from anti-Jewish rioting which had swept the area for days.

On November 25, the JDL was invited to the Boston area by Jewish residents in response to a mounting wave of crime directed primarily against Jews.

On December 3, JDL members attacked the Syrian Mission in New York.

On December 31, 13 JDL members were arrested after a series of coordinated actions against Soviet property in Manhattan and at Kennedy Airport intended to protest the treatment of Jews in the Soviet Union. Several youths painted slogans on a Soviet airliner, two of them handcuffed themselves to the airliner, while others daubed the words &quot;Am Yisroel Chai&quot; (the Nation of Israel Lives) on the plane&#x27;s doors. A similar slogan was painted on the walls of the office of Tass, the Soviet news agency, in Rockefeller Plaza, which was invaded by Rabbi Kahane and four other JDL members. The rest of the demonstrators were taken into custody after invading the midtown offices of the Soviet tourist bureau.
===1970===
Initially, the League was connected to a series of violent attacks against the Soviet Union&#x27;s interests in the United States, protesting the former country&#x27;s repression of Soviet Jews, who were often jailed and refused exit visas. The JDL decided that violence was necessary to draw attention to their plight, reasoning that Moscow would respond to the strain on Soviet–US relations by allowing more emigration to Israel.

In 1970, according to Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin, agents of the Soviet KGB forged and sent threatening letters to Arab missions claiming to be from the JDL to discredit it. They also were ordered to bomb a target in the &quot;Negro section of New York&quot; and blame it on the JDL.

On January 25, JDL members staged anti-Soviet demonstrations at a concert of the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra in Brooklyn College&#x27;s auditorium. JDL members &quot;danced, sang and yelled&quot; while trying to prevent people from entering the auditorium.

On March 23, JDL members staged a sit-in in the office of the president of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York to demand that the Federation allocate more funds for Jewish education and Jewish defense, assist institutions threatened by violence, and arrange for &quot;popular&quot; election of Federation officials. As a result, the Federation agreed to form a special committee to consider the request for additional funds for Jewish education, while other groups continued to demonstrate.

On April 7, the JDL held memorial services on behalf of civilian victims of &quot;Arab terrorism during the past half century&quot; in front of the United Arab Republic Mission to the United Nations.

On April 9, nine JDL members occupied the principal&#x27;s office of Leeds Junior High School in Philadelphia after school authorities had allegedly failed to crack down on school violence. The JDL hoped to present six &quot;suggestions&quot; for protecting students from assault and theft by &quot;troublemakers,&quot; including committing them to disciplinary schools, stationing policemen in the public schools and replacing &quot;weak administrators.&quot;

On April 20, fifteen JDL members were arrested after chaining themselves to the fence in front of the Soviet Mission to the UN to protest against the treatment of Jews in the Soviet Union.

On May 8, about fifty JDL members demonstrated outside the Black Panther Party headquarters in Harlem due to an alleged &quot;outrageous explosion of anti-Semitic hatred&quot; by the Panthers.

On May 19, the JDL issued a statement attacking American Jewish organizations which opposed the Vietnam War, accusing them of doing more to destroy the State of Israel &quot;than all the Arab armies.&quot;

On May 20, thirty-five JDL members took over the Park East Synagogue, opposite the Soviet Mission, and barricaded the entrances in order to hold a &quot;liberation seder&quot; for Soviet Jewry.

On June 23, about forty JDL members seized two floors of an office building in New York housing Amtorg, the official Soviet Union trade office, and evicted the personnel in what the JDL deemed retaliation for the arrests of Jews and raids on Jewish homes in the Soviet Union.

On June 28, 150 JDL members demonstrated over attacks against the Jews of Williamsburg in reprisal for the accidental killing of a black girl by a Jewish driver. Clashes broke out with other minority groups and arrests were made.

On August 16, 400 JDL members began a week-long march from Philadelphia to Washington on behalf of Soviet Jewry, concluding with a rally at Lafayette Park urging President Nixon to &quot;stand tall and firm in the Middle East as you have done elsewhere.&quot; In response, Thomas Hale Boggs Jr., a congressional candidate from Montgomery County (Md.), said he would sponsor a House resolution on Soviet Jewry.

On September 27, two JDL members were arrested at Kennedy Airport while attempting to board a London-bound plane armed with four loaded guns and a live hand grenade. The two intended to hijack a United Arab Airlines plane and divert it to Israel.

On October 6, the JDL is suspected of bombing the New York office of the Palestine Liberation Organization after the PLO hijacked four airliners the previous month. United Press International reported that an anonymous caller phoned in about a half hour before the explosion and proclaimed the JDL slogan, &quot;Never again.&quot;

On December 20, during a march to protest the treatment of Soviet Jewry, JDL members attempted to take over the Soviet Mission headquarters. The members were arrested after inciting demonstrators to break through police lines.

On December 27, the JDL launched a 100-hour vigil for Soviet Jewry. Demonstrators tried to break through police barricades to reach the Soviet Mission to the UN to protest the sentencing of Jews in Leningrad. Several arrests were made.

On December 29, an estimated 100 JDL members demonstrated in front of the offices of the New York Board of Rabbis, challenging them to get arrested &quot;for Jews, as well as for blacks.&quot; Later that day, several JDL members scuffled with police outside the office of Aeroflot-In tourist, the official Soviet tourist agency, while JDL leader Meir Kahane demanded the right to purchase two tickets to Israel for two Russian Jews who were sentenced to death. About 75 JDL members marched near the office, chanting slogans such as &quot;Freedom Now&quot; and &quot;Let My People Go.&quot;

On December 30, several hundred JDL members participated in a rally for Soviet Jewry in Foley square, chanting &quot;Let My People Go,&quot; &quot;Open Up the Iron Door&quot; and &quot;Never Again!&quot;

===1971===

On January 8, 1971, a bombing outside of the Soviet cultural center in Washington, D.C. was followed by a phone call including the JDL slogan &quot;Never again.&quot; A JDL spokesperson denied the group&#x27;s involvement in the bombing, but refused to condemn it.

On January 17, in response to JDL tactics against Soviet personnel being condemned by the Israeli Cabinet and American Jewish leaders, eight former Soviet Jews living in Israel sent cables to American Jewish leaders denouncing their condemnation of the JDL and denying that the JDL&#x27;s acts endangered Soviet Jews. The cables said they were convinced that the JDL&#x27;s &quot;policy and activities are most effective.&quot; The group also attacked Israeli authorities for alleged softness in fighting the Soviet Union on the issue of Jewish rights. One of the signatories, Dov Sperling, claimed that the recent cancellation of the Bolshoi Ballet&#x27;s scheduled American tour was forced by the JDL and hailed it as the first public surrender by Soviet authorities to Jewish pressure. Herut leader Menachem Begin also declared support of acts of harassment against Soviet diplomatic establishments abroad.

On January 19, twenty JDL members had conducted a half-hour sit-in at the offices of Columbia Artists Inc. in Manhattan, leaving only after they were assured a meeting would be set up with the company&#x27;s president in the near future.

On January 20, JDL national chairman Rabbi Meir Kahane announced that JDL will conduct &quot;non-violent actions&quot; against organizations engaged in cultural exchange programs with the Soviet Union and that there had been &quot;unofficial contacts&quot; between his group and &quot;some Jewish establishment organizations&quot; which were welcomed.

=== 1972–1979 ===
In 1972, two JDL members were arrested and convicted of bomb possession and burglary in an attempt to blow up the Long Island residence of the Soviet Mission to the United Nations.

In 1972, a smoke bomb was planted in the Manhattan office of music impresario Sol Hurok, who organized Soviet performers&#x27; U.S. tours. Iris Kones, a Jewish secretary from Long Island, died of smoke inhalation, and Hurok and 12 others were injured and hospitalized. Jerome Zeller of the JDL was indicted for the bombing and Kahane later admitted his part in the attack. JDL activities were condemned by Moscow refuseniks who felt that the group&#x27;s actions were making it less likely that the Soviet Union would relax restrictions on Jewish emigration.

In 1973, threatening phone calls made to the home of Ralph Riskin, one of the producers of &quot;Bridget Loves Bernie&quot;, resulted in the arrest of Robert S. Manning, described as a member of the JDL. Manning was later indicted on separate murder charges, and fought extradition to the United States from Israel, where he had moved.

In 1975, JDL leader Meir Kahane was accused of conspiracy to kidnap a Soviet diplomat, bomb the Iraqi embassy in Washington, and ship arms abroad from Israel. A hearing was held to revoke Kahane&#x27;s probation for a 1971 incendiary device-making incident. He was found guilty of violating probation and served a one-year prison sentence. On December 31, 1975, 15 members of the League seized the office of the Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations in protest for Pope Paul VI&#x27;s policy of support of Palestinian rights. The incident was over after one hour, as the activists left the location after being ordered to do so by the local police, and no arrests were made.

On April 6, 1976, six prominent refuseniks – including Alexander Lerner, Anatoly Shcharansky, and Iosif Begun – condemned the JDL&#x27;s anti-Soviet activities as terrorist acts, stating that their &quot;actions constitute a danger for Soviet Jews ... as they might be used by the [Soviet] authorities as a pretext for new repressions and for instigating anti-Semitic hostilities.&quot;

On March 16, 1978, Irv Rubin, chairman of the JDL, said about the planned American Nazi Party march in Skokie, Illinois: &quot;We are offering $500, that I have in my hand, to any member of the community ... who kills, maims or seriously injures a member of the American Nazi Party.&quot; Rubin was charged with solicitation of murder but was acquitted in 1981.

===1980–1989===
During the 1980s, past-JDL member Victor Vancier (who later founded the Jewish Task Force), and two other former JDL members were arrested in connection with six incidents: 1984 firebombing of an automobile at a Soviet diplomatic residence, the 1985 and 1986 pipe bombings of rival JDL members&#x27; cars, the 1986 firebombing at a hall where the Soviet State Symphony Orchestra was performing, and two 1986 detonations of tear gas grenades to protest performances by Soviet dance troupes. In a 1984 interview, the JDL leader Meir Kahane admitted that the JDL &quot;bombed the Russian mission in New York, the Russian cultural mission here [Washington] in 1971, the Soviet trade offices.&quot; The attacks, which caused minor diplomatic crisis in relations between the U.S. and the USSR, prompted the New York City Police Department (NYPD) to infiltrate the group and one undercover officer discovered a chain of weapon caches across Brooklyn, containing &quot;enough shotguns and rifles to arm a small militia.&quot;

On October 26, 1981, after two firebombs damaged the Egyptian tourist office at Rockefeller Center, JDL Chairman Meir Kahane said at a press conference: &quot;I&#x27;m not going to say that the JDL bombed that office. There are laws against that in this country. But I&#x27;m not going to say I mourn for it either.&quot; The next day, after an anonymous caller claimed responsibility on behalf of the JDL, the group&#x27;s spokesman later denied his group&#x27;s involvement, but said, &quot;we support the act.&quot; JDL members had often been suspected of involvement in attacks against neo-Nazis, Holocaust deniers and antisemites.

On October 11, 1985, Alex Odeh, regional director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), was killed in a mail bombing at his office in Santa Ana, California. Shortly before his killing, Odeh had appeared on the television show &quot;Nightline&quot;, where he engaged in a tense dialogue with a representative from the JDL. Irv Rubin immediately made several controversial public statements in reaction to the incident: &quot;I have no tears for Mr. Odeh. He got exactly what he deserved. ... My tears were used up crying for Leon Klinghoffer.&quot; The Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee both condemned the murder. Four weeks after Odeh&#x27;s death, FBI spokesperson Lane Bonner stated the FBI attributed the bombing and two others to the JDL. In February 1986, the FBI classified the bombing that killed Alex Odeh as a terrorist act. Rubin denied JDL involvement: &quot;What the FBI is doing is simple. ... Some character calls up a news agency or whatever and uses the phrase &quot;Never Again&quot; ... and on that assumption they can go and slander a whole group. That&#x27;s tragic.&quot; In 1987, Floyd Clarke, then assistant director of the FBI, wrote in an internal memo that key suspects had fled to Israel and were living in the West Bank urban settlement of Kiryat Arba. In 1988, the FBI arrested Rochelle Manning as a suspect in the bombing, and also charged her husband, Robert Steven Manning, whom they considered a prime suspect in the attack; both were members of the JDL. Rochelle&#x27;s jury deadlocked, and after the mistrial, she left for Israel to join her husband. Robert Manning was extradited from Israel to the U.S. in 1993. He was subsequently found guilty of involvement in the killing of the secretary of computer firm ProWest, Patricia Wilkerson, in another, unrelated mail bomb blast. In addition, he and other JDL members were also suspected in a string of other violent attacks through 1985, including the bombing of Boston ADC office that seriously injured two police officers, the bomb killing of suspected Nazi war criminal Tscherim Soobzokov in Paterson, New Jersey, and a bombing in Long Island, which was targeted at suspected Nazi war criminal Elmars Sprogis and maimed a bystander. William Ross, another JDL member, was also found guilty for his participation in the bombing that killed Wilkerson. Rochelle Manning was re-indicted for her alleged involvement, and was detained in Israel, pending extradition, when she died of a heart attack in 1994.

===1990–1999===

When Ruthless Records recording artist and former N.W.A member Dr. Dre sought to work instead with Death Row Records, Ruthless Records executives, Mike Klein and Jerry Heller were fearful of possible physical intimidation from Death Row Entertainment executives including chief executive officer Suge Knight and requested security assistance from the JDL. The FBI launched a money laundering investigation, on the presumption that the JDL was extorting money from Ruthless Records and several rap artists, including Tupac Shakur and Eazy-E. Heller has speculated that the FBI did not investigate these threats because of the song &quot;Fuck Tha Police&quot;. Heller said, &quot;It was no secret that in the aftermath of the Suge Knight shake down incident where Eazy was forced to sign over Dr. Dre, Michel&#x27;le and The D.O.C., that Ruthless was protected by Israeli trained/connected security forces.&quot; The FBI documents refer to the JDL death threats and extortion scheme but do not make a direct connection between the group and the 1996 murder of Tupac Shakur.

In 1995, when the Toronto residence of the Holocaust denier Ernst Zündel was the target of an arson attack, a group calling itself the &quot;Jewish Armed Resistance Movement&quot; claimed responsibility; according to the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;, the group had ties to the JDL and to Kahane Chai. The leader of the Toronto wing of the Jewish Defense League, Meir Halevi, denied involvement in the attack, although, just five days later, Halevi was caught trying to break into Zündel&#x27;s property, where he was apprehended by police. Later the same month Zündel was the recipient of a parcel bomb that was detonated by the Toronto police bomb squad. In 2011, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had launched an investigation against at least nine members of the JDL in regards to an anonymous tip that the JDL was plotting to bomb the Palestine House in Mississauga.

===2000–present===

On December 12, 2001, JDL leader Irv Rubin and JDL member Earl Krugel were charged with planning a series of bomb attacks against the Muslim Public Affairs Council in Los Angeles, the King Fahad Mosque in Culver City, California, and the San Clemente office of Arab-American Congressman Darrell Issa, in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Rubin, who also was charged with unlawful possession of an automatic firearm, claimed that he was innocent. On November 4, 2002, at the federal Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, Rubin slit his throat with a safety razor and jumped out of a third story window. Rubin&#x27;s suicide would be contested by his widow and the JDL, particularly after his co-defendant pleaded guilty to the charges and implicated Rubin in the plot. On February 4, 2003, Krugel pleaded guilty to conspiracy and weapons charges stemming from the plot, and was expected to serve up to 20 years in prison. The core of the evidence against Krugel and Rubin was in a number of conversations taped by an informant, Danny Gillis, who was hired by the men to plant the bombs but who turned to the FBI instead. According to one tape, Krugel thought the attacks would serve as &quot;a wakeup call&quot; to Arabs. Krugel was subsequently murdered in prison by a fellow inmate in 2005.
In 2002, in France, attackers from Betar and Ligue de Défense Juive (LDJ) violently assaulted Jewish demonstrators from Peace Now, journalists, police officers (one of whom was stabbed), and Arab bystanders. At least two of the suspects in the 2010 murder of a French Muslim Saïd Bourarach appeared to have ties to the French chapter of the JDL. In 2011, Israeli daily &quot;Haaretz&quot; reported members of the &quot;French branch of Jewish terror group coming to Israel &#x27;to defend settlements&#x27;.&quot; In 2013, a French Arab man was critically injured in a &quot;revenge attack&quot; by LDJ, sparking calls for further attacks against the Jews and a condemnation of the militant group by the French Jewish umbrella group CRIF; as of 2013, there have been least 115 violent incidents were attributed to LDJ &quot;soldiers&quot; since the group&#x27;s registration in France in 2001, including many vigilante reprisals to antisemitic attacks. Earlier that year, two LDJ members were sentenced for an attack at a pro-Palestinian bookstore that injured two people and a LDJ propaganda video called for &quot;five cops for every Jew, 10 Arabs for each rabbi.&quot;

In June 2014, two LDJ supporters were sentenced to prison in France for targeting the car of Jonathan Moadab, the Jewish co-founder of the blog &quot;Cercle des Volontaires (Circle of Volunteers)&quot;, with a home-made bomb in September 2012.

In October 2015, around 100 people brandishing JDL flags, and Israeli flags and letting off flares attacked the Agence France Presse building in Paris. Around 12 of them, armed with batons, assaulted David Perrotin, a leading French journalist. All were linked to the Jewish Defense League (JDL).

On January 21, 2017, multiple members of the Jewish Defense League held a party during Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential inauguration in an office building in New York City in Times Square where bagels, wine were present and Kiddush during the time was recited.

After the October 7th attacks on Israel, Kahanist sentiments and the reemergence of the JDL in Canada and the United States with pro-Israel protests in the country shown people brandishing JDL logos and flags with people also posting on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter (Now X) pro-Kahane and JDL content. 

On October 30, 2023, the Jewish Defense League member, Robert Manning, was released on parole after being sentenced to life after assassinating Alex Odeh October 11, 1985.

On November 12, 2023, during the March for the Republic and Against Antisemitism members of the French JDL division, Ligue de Défense Juive, assaulted a person who was protesting against Marine Le Pen and attacked demonstrators from the Golem collective.

In May 2024, Rabbi Reuven Kahane, a relative to Rabbi Meir Kahane, were arrested after assaulting members of a pro-Palestinian protest in New York City after protesters and Kahane got into an argument which led to Kahane&#x27;s car being damaged, Kahane then assaulted one of the protesters. Kahane also hit a 55-year-old safety marshal with his car lightly injuring, he denies association with the Jewish Defense League despite his cousin being the former leader, Rabbi Meir Kahane.

On the campus of the University of Toronto in September 2024, Eli Schwarz and Meir Weinstein were seen near the area then during the time of a pro-Palestinian protest a masked man had been seen with a Kach flag, Star of David necklace, and a shirt brandishing the Israeli flag.

==Israel==

Kahane immigrated to Israel from the United States in September 1971, where he initiated protests advocating the expulsion of Arabs from Israel and the Palestinian territories. In 1972, JDL leaflets were distributed around Hebron, calling for the mayor to stand trial for the 1929 Hebron massacre.

Kahane nominally lead the JDL until April 1974. In 1971, he founded a new political party in Israel, which ran in the 1973 elections under the name &quot;The League List&quot;. The party won 12,811 votes (0.82%), just 2,857 (0.18%) short of the electoral threshold at the time (1%) for winning a seat. Following the elections, the party&#x27;s name was changed to Kach, taken from the Irgun motto &quot;Rak Kach&quot; (&quot;Only thus&quot;). Kach failed to gain any Knesset seats in the 1977 and 1980 elections as well. In the 1984 elections, the party won 25,907 votes (1.2%), passing the electoral threshold for the first time, and winning one seat, which was duly taken by Kahane.

Kahane&#x27;s popularity grew, with polls showing that Kach would have likely received three to four seats in the coming November 1988 elections, and some forecasting as many as twelve seats, possibly making Kach the third largest party. However, after the Knesset passed an amendment to the Elections Law, Kach was disqualified from running in the 1988 elections by the Central Elections Committee, on the grounds of incitement to racism and negation of the democratic character of the State.

On 5 November 1990, Kahane was assassinated after making a speech in New York. The prime suspect, El Sayyid Nosair, an Egyptian-born American citizen, was subsequently acquitted of murder, but convicted on gun possession charges. The Kach party subsequently split in two, with Binyamin Ze&#x27;ev Kahane (Meir Kahane&#x27;s son) leading a breakaway faction, Kahane Chai. Both parties were banned from participating in the 1992 elections on the basis that they were followers of the original Kach. Binyamin Ze&#x27;ev Kahane and his wife Talya were shot and killed by Palestinian terrorists on December 31, 2000.

On February 25, 1994, Baruch Goldstein, an American-born Israeli member of Kach, who in his youth was a JDL activist, opened fire on Muslims kneeling in prayer at the revered Cave of the Patriarchs mosque in the West Bank city of Hebron, killing 29 worshippers and injuring 125 before he ran out of ammunition and was himself killed. The attack set off riots and protests throughout the West Bank and 19 Palestinians were killed by the Israeli Defense Forces within 48 hours of the massacre. On its website, the JDL described the massacre as a &quot;preventative measure against yet another Arab attack on Jews&quot; and noted that they &quot;do not consider his assault to qualify under the label of terrorism&quot;. Furthermore, they noted that &quot;we teach that violence is never a good solution but is unfortunately sometimes necessary as a last resort when innocent lives are threatened; we therefore view Dr. Goldstein as a martyr in Judaism&#x27;s protracted struggle against Arab terrorism. And we are not ashamed to say that Goldstein was a charter member of the Jewish Defense League.&quot; In a similar attack nearly twelve years earlier, on April 11, 1982, an American-born JDL member and immigrant to Israel, Alan Harry Goodman, opened fire with his military-issue rifle at the Dome of the Rock on the sacred Temple Mount in Jerusalem, killing one Palestinian Arab and injuring four others. The 1982 shooting sparked an Arab riot in which another Palestinian was shot dead by the police. In 1983, Goodman was sentenced by an Israeli court to life in prison (which usually means 25 years in Israel); he was released after serving 15 1/2 years on the condition of returning to the United States.

==Terrorism and other illegal activities==

In a 2004 congressional testimony, John S. Pistole, executive assistant director for counterterrorism and counterintelligence for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) described the JDL as &quot;a known violent extremist Jewish organization.&quot; FBI statistics show that, from 1980 through 1985, there were 18 officially classified terrorist attacks in the U.S. committed by Jews; 15 of those by members of the JDL.

In its report, &quot;Terrorism 2000/2001&quot;, the FBI referred to the JDL as a &quot;violent extremist Jewish organization&quot; and stated that the FBI was responsible for thwarting at least one of its terrorist acts. The National Consortium for the Study of Terror and Responses to Terrorism states that, during the JDL&#x27;s first two decades of activity, it was an &quot;active terrorist organization.&quot; The JDL was specifically referenced by the FBI&#x27;s Executive Assistant Director Counterterrorism/Counterintelligence, John S. Pistole, in his formal report before the 9/11 Commission.

JDL is suspected of being behind the 1972 bombing of the Manhattan offices of theater impresario Sol Hurok in which 2 employees were killed.

==Violent deaths==
A number of senior JDL personnel and associates have died violently. Meir Kahane, the JDL&#x27;s founding chairman, was assassinated in 1990 as was his son, Binyamin Ze&#x27;ev Kahane, in 2000. Long-time JDL chairman Irv Rubin died in 2002 in a Los Angeles federal detention center &quot;after allegedly cutting his throat with a jail-issued razor and then jumping or falling over a railing and plummeting to his death.&quot; Rubin&#x27;s deputy, Earl Krugel, was murdered by a fellow prison inmate and white supremacist in 2005. Rubin&#x27;s son and JDL vice-chairman Ari Rubin committed suicide in 2012.

===Schism===
After Rubin&#x27;s death in prison in November 2002, Bill Maniaci was appointed interim chairman by Shelley Rubin. Two years later, the Jewish Defense League became mired in a state of upheaval over legal control of the organization. In October 2004, Maniaci rejected Shelley Rubin&#x27;s call for him to resign; as a result, Maniaci was stripped of his title and membership. At that point, the JDL split into two separate factions, each vying for legal control of the associated &quot;intellectual property.&quot; The two operated as separate organizations with the same name while a lengthy legal battle ensued. In April 2005, the original domain name of the organization, &quot;jdl.org&quot;, was suspended by Network Solutions due to allegations of infringement; the organization went back online soon thereafter at domain name &quot;jewishdefenseleague.org&quot;. In April 2006, news of a settlement was announced in which signatories agreed to not object to &quot;Shelley Rubin&#x27;s titles of permanent chairman and CEO of JDL.&quot; The agreement also confirmed that &quot;the name &#x27;Jewish Defense League,&#x27; the acronym &#x27;JDL,&#x27; and the &#x27;Fist and Star&#x27; logo are the exclusive intellectual property of JDL.&quot; (Opponents of both groups claim that these are Kahanist symbols and not the exclusive property of JDL. At this time, however, the logo is no longer in general use by the Kahanist groups.) The agreement also states: &quot;Domain names registered on behalf of JDL, including but not limited to jdl.org and jewishdefenseleague.org, are owned and operated by JDL.&quot; Meanwhile, the opposing group formed B&#x27;nai Elim, which is the latest of many JDL splinter groups to have formed over the years (previous splinter groups included the Jewish Direct Action and the United Jewish Underground that have been active during the 1980s).

===Principles===
The JDL upholds five fundamental principles
* &quot;LOVE OF JEWRY, one Jewish people, indivisible and united, from which flows the love for and the feeling of pain of all Jews.&quot;
* &quot;DIGNITY AND PRIDE, pride in and knowledge of Jewish tradition, faith, culture, land, history, strength, pain and peoplehood.&quot;
* &quot;IRON, the need to both move to help Jews everywhere and to change the Jewish image through sacrifice and all necessary means—even strength, force and violence.&quot;
* &quot;DISCIPLINE AND UNITY, the knowledge that he (or she) can and will do whatever must be done, and the unity and strength of willpower to bring this into reality.&quot;
* &quot;FAITH IN THE INDESTRUCTIBILITY OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE, faith in the greatness and indestructibility of the Jewish people, our religion and our Land of Israel.&quot;

The JDL encourages, per its principle of the &quot;Love of Jewry,&quot; that &quot;... in the end ... the Jew can look to no one but another Jew for help and that the true solution to the Jewish problem is the liquidation of the Exile and the return of all Jews to Eretz Yisroel – the land of Israel.&quot; The JDL elaborates on this fundamental principle by insisting upon an &quot;immediate need to place Judaism over any other &#x27;ism&#x27; and ideology and ... use of the yardstick: &#x27;Is it good for Jews?&#x27;&quot; The JDL argues that, outside of Jews, there are historically no people corresponding to the Palestinian ethnicity. Writing on its official website, the JDL claims: &quot;[T]he first mention of a &#x27;Palestinian people&#x27; dates from the aftermath of the 1967 war, when the local Arabic-speaking communities ... were retrospectively endowed with a contrived &#x27;nationhood&#x27; ... taken from Jewish history ...&quot; and that &quot;[c]learly, since Roman times &#x27;Palestinian&#x27; had meant Jews until the Arab&#x27;s recent adoption of this identity in order to claim it as their land.&quot; On this basis, the JDL argues that &quot;Zionism [should be] under no obligation to accommodate a separate &#x27;Palestinian&#x27; claim, there being no historical evidence or witness for any such Arab category,&quot; and it considers Palestinian claims to be &quot;Arab usurpation&quot; of proper Jewish title.

==Relations with other groups==
In 1971, Kahane aligned the JDL with the Italian-American Civil Rights League, created the previous year by the Italian American mob boss Joseph Colombo, head of the Colombo crime family. In 2011, the Canadian JDL organized a &quot;support rally&quot; for the English Defence League (EDL) featuring a live speech, via Skype, by EDL leader Tommy Robinson. The event was denounced and condemned by the Canadian Jewish Congress (CJC) leader Bernie Farber and general counsel Benjamin Shinewald. The rally, held at the Toronto Zionist Centre, attracted a counter-protest organized by Anti-Racist Action (ARA) resulting in four ARA members being arrested. The JDL Canada has also organized rallies in support of right-wing Israeli politician Moshe Feiglin and Dutch politician and well-known Islam critic Geert Wilders of the Party for Freedom, and announced its support for the increasingly anti-Islamic Freedom Party of Austria.

Rav Yehuda HaKohen, a leader in the Hebrew Universalist VISION movement, is a former JDL member and has cited Kahanism as an inspiration behind his ideological beliefs.

<text>The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC) in La Cañada Flintridge, California, Crescenta Valley, United States. Founded in 1936 by California Institute of Technology (Caltech) researchers, the laboratory is now owned and sponsored by NASA and administered and managed by Caltech.

The primary function of the laboratory is the construction and operation of planetary robotic spacecraft, though it also conducts Earth-orbit and astronomy missions. It is also responsible for operating the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).

Among the major active projects at the laboratory, some are the Mars 2020 mission, which includes the &quot;Perseverance&quot; rover; the Mars Science Laboratory mission, including the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover; the &quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&quot;; the &quot;Juno&quot; spacecraft orbiting Jupiter; the &quot;SMAP&quot; satellite for Earth surface soil moisture monitoring; the NuSTAR X-ray telescope; and the &quot;Psyche&quot; asteroid orbiter. It is also responsible for managing the JPL Small-Body Database, and provides physical data and lists of publications for all known small Solar System bodies.

JPL&#x27;s Space Flight Operations Facility and Twenty-Five-Foot Space Simulator are designated National Historic Landmarks.

==History==

JPL traces its beginnings to 1936 in GALCIT (the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology) when the first set of United States rocket experiments were carried out in the Arroyo Seco. This initial venture involved Caltech graduate students Frank Malina, Qian Xuesen, Weld Arnold and Apollo M. O. Smith, along with Jack Parsons and Edward S. Forman, often referred to as the &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; due to the dangerous nature of their experiments. Together, they tested a small, alcohol-fueled motor to gather data for Malina&#x27;s graduate thesis. Malina&#x27;s thesis advisor was engineer/aerodynamicist Theodore von Kármán, who eventually secured U.S. Army financial support for this &quot;GALCIT Rocket Project&quot; in 1939.

=== Rocketry beginnings ===
In the early years of the project, work was primarily focused on the development of rocket technology. In 1941, Malina, Parsons, Forman, Martin Summerfield, and pilot Homer Bushey demonstrated the first jet-assisted takeoff (JATO) rockets to the Army. In 1943, von Kármán, Malina, Parsons, and Forman established the Aerojet Corporation to manufacture JATO rockets. The project took on the name Jet Propulsion Laboratory in November 1943, formally becoming an Army facility operated under contract by the university. In the same year, Qian and two of his colleagues drafted the first document to use the name Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
In a NASA conference on the history of early rocketry, Malina wrote that the work of the JPL was &quot;considered to include&quot; the research carried out by the GALCIT Rocket Research Group from 1936 on. In 1944, Parsons was expelled due to his &quot;unorthodox and unsafe working methods&quot; following one of several FBI investigations into his involvement with the occult, drugs and sexual promiscuity.

During JPL&#x27;s Army years, the laboratory developed two significant deployed weapon systems, the MGM-5 Corporal and MGM-29 Sergeant intermediate-range ballistic missiles, marking the first US ballistic missiles developed at JPL. It also developed several other weapons system prototypes, such as the Loki anti-aircraft missile system, and the forerunner of the Aerobee sounding rocket. At various times, it carried out rocket testing at the White Sands Proving Ground, Edwards Air Force Base, and Goldstone, California.

=== Transition to NASA ===
In 1954, JPL teamed up with Wernher von Braun&#x27;s engineers at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency&#x27;s Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, to propose orbiting a satellite during the International Geophysical Year. The team lost that proposal to Project Vanguard, and instead embarked on a classified project to demonstrate ablative re-entry technology using a Jupiter-C rocket. They carried out three successful sub-orbital flights in 1956 and 1957. Using a spare Juno I (a modified Jupiter-C with a fourth stage), the two organizations then launched the United States&#x27; first satellite, Explorer 1, on January 31, 1958. This significant achievement marked a new era for JPL and the US in the space race.

Less than a year later in December 1958, JPL was transferred to the newly formed National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). As a result of this transition, JPL became the agency&#x27;s primary planetary spacecraft center, leading the design and operation of various lunar and interplanetary missions. The transfer to NASA marked the beginning of a &quot;Golden Age&quot; of planetary exploration for JPL in the 1960s and 1970s. JPL engineers designed and operated Ranger and Surveyor missions to the Moon that paved the way for the Apollo program. JPL proved itself a leader in interplanetary exploration with the Mariner missions to Venus, Mars, and Mercury, returning valuable data about our neighboring planets.

Additionally, JPL was early to employ female mathematicians. In the 1940s and 1950s, using mechanical calculators, women in an all-female computations group performed trajectory calculations. In 1961, JPL hired Dana Ulery as the first female engineer to work alongside male engineers as part of the Ranger and Mariner mission tracking teams.

=== Deep space exploration ===
Building on the momentum from the successes of the 1960s and early 1970s, JPL initiated an era of deep space exploration in the late 1970s and 1980s. The highlight of this period was the launch of the twin Voyager spacecraft in 1977. 

Initially set on a trajectory to explore Jupiter and its moon Io, Voyager 1&#x27;s mission parameters were adjusted to also provide a close flyby of Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan. The spacecraft sent back detailed images and data from both gas giants, revolutionizing our understanding of these distant worlds. The Voyager 2 spacecraft followed a more extensive trajectory, conducting flybys of not just Jupiter and Saturn, but also Uranus and Neptune. These encounters provided firsthand data from all four gas giants, offering insights into the nature and dynamics of the outer planets. Both Voyager spacecraft, after fulfilling their primary mission objectives, were directed towards interstellar space, carrying with them the Golden Records – phonograph discs containing sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life on Earth.

The 1980s also saw the inception of the Galileo mission which launched in the late 1980s. The Galileo spacecraft was designed to study Jupiter and its major moons in detail. Although the probe only entered the gas giant&#x27;s orbit in the 1990s, its inception and planning during the 1980s signified JPL&#x27;s continued commitment to deep space exploration.

=== Mars exploration ===
The 1990s and 2000s saw a resurgence in Mars exploration, driven by JPL&#x27;s Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration Rover missions. In 1997, the Mars Pathfinder mission deployed the first successful Mars rover, Sojourner, demonstrating the feasibility of mobile exploration on the Martian surface. In 2004, the Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, landed on Mars. Opportunity outlived its expected lifespan by 14 years, providing a wealth of scientific data and setting the stage for future Mars missions.

=== Earth science and robotic exploration ===
In the 2000s and 2010s, JPL broadened its exploration scope, including the launch of missions to study the outer planets, like the Juno mission to Jupiter and the Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn. Concurrently, JPL also began to focus on Earth science missions, developing satellite technology to study climate change, weather patterns, and natural phenomena on Earth. JPL also opened the Near-Earth Object Program Office for NASA in 1998, which had found 95% of asteroids a kilometer or more in diameter that cross Earth&#x27;s orbit by 2013.

Entering the 2010s and 2020s, JPL continued its Mars exploration with the Curiosity rover and the Mars 2020 mission, which included the Perseverance rover and the Ingenuity helicopter. Perseverance&#x27;s core objective was to collect samples for a future Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission. In addition, JPL ventured into asteroid exploration with the OSIRIS-REx mission which returned a sample from asteroid Bennu.

=== 2020s and beyond ===
As JPL moves forward, its focus remains on diverse interplanetary and even interstellar missions. Future Mars missions will aim to return the samples collected by the Perseverance rover back to Earth. Additionally, JPL&#x27;s Europa Clipper mission launched in 2024 to study Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa, believed to harbor a subsurface ocean. Building on the Voyager program&#x27;s success, JPL continues to push the boundaries of deep-space exploration. The Interstellar Probe concept, though not yet formalized, proposes to send a spacecraft ten times the distance from the Sun as Pluto, to explore the interstellar medium and the outermost reaches of our solar system.

JPL has been recognized four times by the Space Foundation: with the Douglas S. Morrow Public Outreach Award, which is given annually to an individual or organization that has made significant contributions to public awareness of space programs, in 1998; and with the John L. &quot;Jack&quot; Swigert, Jr., Award for Space Exploration on three occasions – in 2009 (as part of NASA&#x27;s Phoenix Mars Lander Team), 2006 and 2005.

In January 2025, JPL was closed and evacuated due to the Eaton Fire raging in the nearby towns of Pasadena and Altadena, with operations like the DSN getting relocated offsite. Although the facility has not sustained damage from the wildfires, it has experienced minor wind damage and as well as numerous employees losing their homes.

==Location==

When it was founded, JPL&#x27;s site was immediately west of a rocky flood-plain – the Arroyo Seco riverbed – above the Devil&#x27;s Gate dam in the northwestern panhandle of the city of Pasadena in Southern California, near Los Angeles. While the first few buildings were constructed in land bought from the city of Pasadena, subsequent buildings were constructed in neighboring unincorporated land that later became part of La Cañada Flintridge. Nowadays, most of the of the U.S. federal government-owned NASA property that makes up the JPL campus is located in La Cañada Flintridge. Despite this, JPL still uses a Pasadena address (4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109) as its official mailing address. There has been occasional rivalry between the two cities over the issue of which one should be mentioned in the media as the home of the laboratory.

==Employees==
After the 2024 layoffs, there are only approximately 5,500 full-time Caltech employees and contractors working on any given day. NASA also has a resident office at the facility staffed by federal managers who oversee JPL&#x27;s activities and work for NASA. There are also some Caltech graduate students, college student interns and co-op students.

==Education==

The JPL Education Office serves educators and students by providing them with activities, resources, materials and opportunities tied to NASA missions and science. The mission of its programs is to introduce and further students&#x27; interest in pursuing STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) careers.

===Internships and fellowships===
JPL offers research, internship and fellowship opportunities in the summer and throughout the year to high school through postdoctoral and faculty students. (In most cases, students must be U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents to apply, although foreign nationals studying at U.S. universities are eligible for limited programs.) Interns are sponsored through NASA programs, university partnerships and JPL mentors for research opportunities at the laboratory in areas including technology, robotics, planetary science, aerospace engineering, and astrophysics.

In August 2013, JPL was named one of &quot;The 10 Most Awesome College Labs of 2013&quot; by Popular Science, which noted that about 100 students who intern at the laboratory are considered for permanent jobs at JPL after they graduate.

The JPL Education Office also hosts the Planetary Science Summer School (PSSS), an annual week-long workshop for graduate and postdoctoral students. The program involves a one-week team design exercise developing an early mission concept study, working with JPL&#x27;s Advanced Projects Design Team (&quot;Team X&quot;) and other concurrent engineering teams.

===Museum &amp; Informal Education Alliance Alliance===
JPL created the NASA Museum Alliance in 2003 out of a desire to provide museums, planetariums, visitor centers and other kinds of informal educators with exhibit materials, professional development and information related to the then-upcoming landings of the Mars rovers &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot;. The Alliance now has more than 500 members, who get access to NASA displays, models, educational workshops and networking opportunities through the program. Staff at educational organizations that meet the Museum Alliance requirements can register to participate online.

The Museum Alliance is a subset of the JPL Education Office&#x27;s Informal Education group, which also serves after-school and summer programs, parents and other kinds of informal educators.

On December 9, 2020, the Museum Alliance officially announced a rebrand to the Museum &amp; Informal Education (MIE) Alliance. In an announcement to members, they said, &quot;Pronounced &#x27;My&#x27; Alliance, our new name better reflects the diversity of organizations you represent.&quot;

===Educator Resource Center===
The NASA/JPL Educator Resource Center, which is moving from its location at the Indian Hill Mall in Pomona, California, at the end of 2013, offers resources, materials and free workshops for formal and informal educators covering science, technology, engineering and science topics related to NASA missions and science.

==Open house==

The lab had an open house once a year on a Saturday and Sunday in May or June, when the public was invited to tour the facilities and see live demonstrations of JPL science and technology. More limited private tours are also available throughout the year if scheduled well in advance. Thousands of schoolchildren from Southern California and elsewhere visit the lab every year. Due to federal spending cuts mandated by budget sequestration, the open house has been previously cancelled. JPL open house for 2014 was October 11 and 12 and 2015 was October 10 and 11. Starting from 2016, JPL replaced the annual Open House with &quot;Ticket to Explore JPL&quot;, which features the same exhibits but requires tickets and advance reservation. Roboticist and Mars rover driver Vandi Verma frequently acts as science communicator at open house type events to encourage children (and particularly girls) into STEM careers.

==Other works==
In addition to its government work, JPL has also assisted the nearby motion picture and television industries, by advising them about scientific accuracy in their productions. Science fiction shows advised by JPL include &quot;Babylon 5&quot; and its sequel series, &quot;Crusade&quot;.

JPL also works with the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (DHS-S&amp;T). JPL and DHS-S&amp;T developed a search and rescue tool for first responders called FINDER. First responders can use FINDER to locate people still alive who are buried in rubble after a disaster or terrorist attack. FINDER uses microwave radar to detect breathing and pulses.

Additionally, JPL is home to the JPL-RPIF (Jet Propulsion Laboratory – Regional Planetary Image Facility) which is chartered as a repository for all robotic spacecraft hard-copy data and thus provides a valuable resource to NASA funded science investigators, and an important conduit for the distribution of NASA generated materials to local educators in the Los Angeles/southern California area.

==Funding==
The predominant source of JPL&#x27;s financial support is NASA. As a field center of NASA, JPL&#x27;s primary activities and projects are generally aligned with NASA&#x27;s mission objectives in space exploration, Earth sciences, and astrophysics. The funding allocated to JPL comes as a portion of NASA&#x27;s annual budget, which is itself part of the United States federal budget approved by Congress. The scale of the budget is contingent on the projects that JPL undertakes as missions can range from flagship interplanetary missions costing billions of U.S. dollars to smaller Earth observation systems with budgets in the hundreds of millions.

Aside from NASA, JPL secures funding for specialized projects from other federal agencies, including but not limited to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). Occasionally, JPL engages in joint missions or research endeavors with international space agencies or research institutions. While these partnerships contribute a relatively small portion of JPL&#x27;s overall budget, they serve to enhance the scope and impact of its scientific research and technological development.

The total budget for JPL is subject to annual fluctuations based on both the federal allocation to NASA and the life cycle of ongoing projects. High-profile missions may receive significant long-term funding commitments, whereas smaller or shorter-term projects may have more modest financial support. These agencies often commission projects that leverage JPL&#x27;s unique expertise in areas like remote sensing, robotics, and systems engineering. Although these projects form a smaller part of JPL&#x27;s overall budget, they are integral to fulfilling the diverse set of objectives that these federal agencies oversee.

In fiscal year 2022, the laboratory&#x27;s budget was approximately $2.4 billion, with the largest share going to Planetary Science development.

In February and November 2024, due to the overall budget situation and budget shifts in Mars Sample Return (MSR), the institute laid off approximately 1000 employees and contractors.

==Peanuts tradition==
There is a tradition at JPL to eat &quot;good luck peanuts&quot; before critical mission events, such as orbital insertions or landings. As the story goes, after the Ranger program had experienced failure after failure during the 1960s, the first successful Ranger mission to impact the Moon occurred after a JPL staff member had decided to pass out peanuts to relieve tension. The staff jokingly decided that the peanuts must have been a good luck charm, and the tradition persisted.

==Team X==
The JPL Advanced Projects Design Team, also known as Team X, is an interdisciplinary team of engineers that utilizes &quot;concurrent engineering methodologies to complete rapid design, analysis and evaluation of mission concept designs&quot;.

==Controversies==

===Employee background check lawsuit===

On February 25, 2005, Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 was approved by the Secretary of Commerce. This was followed by Federal Information Processing Standards 201 (FIPS 201), which specified how the federal government should implement personal identity verification. These specifications led to a need for rebadging to meet the updated requirements.

On August 30, 2007, a group of JPL employees filed suit in federal court against NASA, Caltech, and the Department of Commerce, claiming their constitutional rights were being violated by the new, overly invasive background investigations. 97% of JPL employees were classified at the low-risk level and would be subjected to the same clearance procedures as those obtaining moderate/high risk clearance. Under HSPD 12 and FIPS 201, investigators have the right to obtain any information on employees, which includes questioning acquaintances on the status of the employee&#x27;s mental, emotional, and financial stability. Additionally, if employees depart JPL before the end of the two-year validity of the background check, no investigation ability is terminated; former employees can still be legally monitored.

Employees were told that if they did not sign an unlimited waiver of privacy, they would be deemed to have &quot;voluntarily resigned&quot;. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found the process violated the employees&#x27; privacy rights and issued a preliminary injunction. NASA appealed and the US Supreme Court granted certiorari on March 8, 2010. On January 19, 2011, the Supreme Court overturned the Ninth Circuit decision, ruling that the background checks did not violate any constitutional privacy right that the employees may have had.

===&quot;Coppedge v Jet Propulsion Laboratory&quot;===

On March 12, 2012, the Los Angeles Superior Court took opening statements on the case in which former JPL employee David Coppedge brought suit against the lab due to workplace discrimination and wrongful termination. In the suit, Coppedge alleges that he first lost his &quot;team lead&quot; status on JPL&#x27;s &quot;Cassini-Huygens&quot; mission in 2009 and then was fired in 2011 because of his evangelical Christian beliefs and specifically his belief in intelligent design. Conversely, JPL, through the Caltech lawyers representing the laboratory, allege that Coppedge&#x27;s termination was simply due to budget cuts and his demotion from team lead was because of harassment complaints and from on-going conflicts with his co-workers. Superior Court Judge Ernest Hiroshige issued a final ruling in favor of JPL on January 16, 2013.

<text>John Howard Rutsey (July 23, 1952 – May 11, 2008) was a Canadian musician best known as a founding member and original drummer of Rush. He performed on the band&#x27;s 1974 debut album, but left shortly after its release due to health problems which limited his ability to tour with the band. He was subsequently replaced by Neil Peart, who would remain the drummer of Rush on the band&#x27;s future recordings and for the rest of its active history.

==Biography==
===Personal life===
Rutsey was the son of &quot;Toronto Telegram&quot; crime reporter Howard Rutsey. He had an older brother named Bill, and a younger brother named Mike who became a baseball writer. Following the death of their father by heart attack, the brothers were raised by their mother, Eva.

Rutsey was a student at St. Patrick’s School, and it was there that he met Gary Weinrib and Alex Zivojinovich (who would later change their names to Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson respectively). Whereas Lee and Lifeson were listening to progressive rock bands such as Yes, Pink Floyd and Genesis at that time, Rutsey drew more inspiration from the harder styles of bands such as Bad Company.

===Formation of Rush===
Rutsey and Lifeson became close friends while attending St. Patrick’s School, and the pair would play street hockey together in their neighborhood. Both were interested in rock music, and talked often about forming a band. Together, they initially were members of the bands The Projection with Bill Fitzgerald and &quot;Doc&quot; Cooper. Eventually their mutual school friend, Geddy Lee, joined them and the earliest version of Rush was formed.

Rutsey&#x27;s commitment has been credited with providing the band&#x27;s early direction, as it was he who took the band most seriously and would insist on regular practice sessions. According to Ian Grandy, a member of the band&#x27;s early road crew, &quot;I&#x27;ve said it before and I&#x27;ll say it again: There would have been no &#x27;Rush&#x27; without John.&quot; At Rutsey&#x27;s suggestion, Rush was initially a glam rock band. &quot;John led the guys as far as being &#x27;glam rockers&#x27;, with really flashy jackets and pants, and eight-inch high boots&quot;, according to Grandy. &quot;One time, he was speaking to me at the Gasworks and I said, &#x27;Didn&#x27;t we used to be the same height (5&#x27;8&quot;)?&#x27; He laughed and said &#x27;Well, maybe a long time ago!

It was Rutsey&#x27;s brother, Bill, who came up with the name Rush for the band during a rehearsal in the Rutsey family basement in mid 1968.

===Career===
The band formed with Rutsey on drums, Lifeson on guitars, and Jeff Jones on vocals and bass, but after their first concert Jones left and was succeeded by Lee. During these early years, Rutsey played on the &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;/&quot;You Can&#x27;t Fight It&quot; single as well as the debut album.

Lee and Lifeson have each acknowledged that during the writing and recording sessions for the band&#x27;s debut album, Rutsey was given the role of chief lyricist. When the time came to start recording, however, he did not deliver any lyrics. In interviews, Lee and Lifeson have both said that Rutsey was dissatisfied with what he had written and had torn up the lyric sheets. Lee hastily wrote the lyrics to all the songs before recording the vocal tracks.

Soon after Rush released its debut album, Rutsey left the band, due to musical differences, health concerns related to diabetes, and his general distaste for touring. Rutsey&#x27;s final performance with the group was on July 25, 1974, at Centennial Hall in London, Ontario. He was replaced by Neil Peart.

===Later life===
Lifeson stated in a 1989 interview that he still often had seen Rutsey, and after leaving the band Rutsey went into bodybuilding. Lifeson remarked, &quot;He competed on an amateur level for a while, doing that for a few years, and has sort of been in and out of that, but he still works out, and I work out with him a few times a week at a local gym – at a Gold&#x27;s, here in Toronto.&quot; In 2005, Lifeson said that he had not seen Rutsey since around 1990.

===Death===
On May 11, 2008, Rutsey died in his sleep of an apparent heart attack, related to complications from diabetes. Rutsey&#x27;s family wished to keep the funeral a private affair, although donations would be sent to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation in Markham, Ontario.

==Aftermath==
After Rutsey&#x27;s death, Lee and Lifeson released this statement: &quot;Our memories of the early years of Rush when John was in the band are very fond to us. Those years spent in our teens dreaming of one day doing what we continue to do decades later are special. Although our paths diverged many years ago, we smile today, thinking back on those exciting times and remembering John&#x27;s wonderful sense of humour and impeccable timing. He will be deeply missed by all he touched.&quot;

Rutsey&#x27;s part in the band&#x27;s early history is acknowledged in the 2010 documentary &quot;&quot;. Tape-recorded comments from him are heard during the film, and the DVD release includes two performances with him on drums in its bonus features. A third performance is included as a bonus feature on the &quot;Time Machine 2011: Live in Cleveland&quot; home video release.

<text>The John von Neumann Theory Prize of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS)
is awarded annually to an individual (or sometimes a group) who has made fundamental and sustained contributions to theory in operations research and the management sciences.

The Prize named after mathematician John von Neumann is awarded for a body of work, rather than a single piece. The Prize was intended to reflect contributions that have stood the test of time. The criteria include significance, innovation, depth, and scientific excellence.

The award is $5,000, a medallion and a citation.

The Prize has been awarded since 1975. The first recipient was George B. Dantzig for his work on linear programming.

<text>Jean Richard (18 April 1921 – 12 December 2001) was a French actor, comedian, and circus entrepreneur. He is best remembered for his role as Georges Simenon&#x27;s &quot;Maigret&quot; in the eponymous French television series, which he played for more than twenty years, and for his circus activities. 

Richard was born in Bessines, Deux-Sevres. In the 1970s–1980s, he owned and managed three major circuses, two theme parks near Paris, La Mer de Sable and La Vallée des Peaux-Rouges, and a private zoo in his property of Ermenonville, Oise. He died on 12 December 2001 in Senlis, aged 80.

<text>John Philip Walker Lindh (born February 9, 1981) is an American Taliban member who was captured by United States forces as an enemy combatant during the United States&#x27; invasion of Afghanistan in November 2001. He was detained at Qala-i-Jangi fortress, used as a prison. He denied participating in the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi, a violent uprising of the Taliban prisoners, stating that he was wounded in the leg and hid in the cellar of the Pink House, in the southern half of the fort. He was one of the 86 prisoners who survived the uprising, from an estimated 400 prisoners in total. CIA officer Johnny &quot;Mike&quot; Spann was killed during that uprising. Brought to trial in United States federal court in February 2002, Lindh accepted a plea bargain; he pleaded guilty to two charges and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. He was released on parole on May 23, 2019, for a three-year period of supervised release.

A convert to Sunni Islam in California at age 16, Lindh traveled to Yemen in 1998 to study Arabic and stayed there for 10 months. He later returned in 2000, then went to Afghanistan to aid the Taliban in fighting against the Afghan Northern Alliance. He received training at Al-Farouq, a training camp associated with al-Qaeda, designated a terrorist organization by the United States and other countries. While at the camp, he attended a lecture by Osama bin Laden. After the 9/11 attacks, he remained with the Taliban military forces despite learning that the U.S. had become allied with the Northern Alliance. Lindh had previously received training with Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, an internationally designated terrorist organization based in Pakistan.

Lindh went by the name Sulayman al-Faris during his time in Afghanistan but prefers the name Abu Sulayman al-Irlandi today. In early reports following his capture, when the press learned that he was a US citizen, he was usually referred to by the news media as just &quot;John Walker&quot;.

==Youth, conversion, and travels==
Lindh was born in Washington, D.C., to Marilyn Walker and Frank R. Lindh, as the middle of three children in the family. He was named &quot;John&quot; after John Lennon, who was murdered two months before Lindh&#x27;s birth. He was baptized a Catholic, and grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland. When he was 10 years old, his family moved to San Anselmo, California. Lindh suffered from an intestinal disorder as a child. At age 14, his health improved. He enrolled at Redwood High School as a freshman. He then transferred to Tamiscal High School in the Tamalpais Union High School District, an alternative school offering self-directed, individualized study programs. While there, he studied world culture, including Sunni Islam and the Middle East.

Lindh dropped out of the school and eventually earned an equivalent of a high school diploma by passing the California High School Proficiency Exam at age 16. As an adolescent, Lindh participated in IRC chatrooms with the IRC nickname Mujahid. He became a devoted fan of hip-hop music and engaged in extensive discussions on Usenet newsgroups, sometimes pretending to be an African-American rapper who would criticize others for &quot;acting black&quot;. Spike Lee&#x27;s film &quot;Malcolm X&quot; impressed him deeply and sparked his interest in Islam.

Although his parents did not divorce until 1999, their marriage was in serious trouble throughout Lindh&#x27;s adolescence. His father often left their Marin residence for extended periods to live in San Francisco with a male lover. Frank Lindh said he and Marilyn had been separated since 1997. Also in 1997, at the age of 16, Lindh converted to Islam. He began regularly attending mosques in Mill Valley and later in nearby San Francisco.

In 1998, Lindh traveled to Yemen and stayed for about 10 months to learn Arabic so that he could read the Qur&#x27;an in its original language. He returned to the United States in 1999, living with his family for about eight months. Lindh returned to Yemen in February 2000 and left for Pakistan to study at a &quot;madrasa&quot;. While abroad, Lindh exchanged numerous emails with his family. In one, his father told him about the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing, to which Lindh replied that the American naval destroyers being in the Yemen harbor had been an act of war, and that the bombing was justified. His father told &quot;Newsweek&quot;: &quot;This raised my concerns, but my days of molding him were over.&quot;

At the age of 20, Lindh decided to travel to Afghanistan to fight for the Afghan Taliban government forces against Northern Alliance fighters. His parents said that he was moved by stories of atrocities allegedly perpetrated by the Northern Alliance army against civilians. He traveled to Afghanistan in May 2001. Tony West, his lawyer, explained it as follows: &quot;One of the first things he told Army interrogators when they questioned him on December 3, 2001, was that after 9/11 happened, he wanted to leave the front lines but could not for fear of his life. John never wanted to be in a position where he was opposing the United States (and never thought he would be), and in fact he never opposed any American military.&quot;

==Capture and interrogation==
Lindh surrendered on November 24, 2001, to Afghan Northern Alliance forces after his Al Qaeda foreign fighters unit surrendered at Kunduz after retreating from Takar. He and other fighters were to be questioned by the CIA officers Johnny &quot;Mike&quot; Spann and David Tyson at General Dostum&#x27;s military garrison, Qala-i-Jangi, near Mazār-e Sharīf. During the initial questioning, Lindh was not advised of his rights and his request for a lawyer was denied.

Lindh, who had a grandmother from County Donegal, had told other prisoners he was Irish. While being interviewed by the CIA, he did not speak or reveal that he was American. Spann asked Lindh, &quot;Are you a member of the IRA?&quot; He was asked this question because, when questioned by Spann, an Iraqi in the group identified Lindh as an English speaker. Lindh had been told to say he was &quot;Irish&quot; to avoid problems. Moments later, around 11 am, the makeshift prison was the scene of a violent uprising, which became known as the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi. Spann and hundreds of foreign fighters were killed; only 86 prisoners survived. According to other detainees interviewed by journalist Robert Young Pelton for CNN, Lindh was fully aware of the planned uprising, yet remained silent and did not cooperate with the Americans.

Sometime during the initial uprising, Lindh was shot or hit by shrapnel in the right upper thigh and found refuge in a basement, hiding with the rest of the detainees. On the second day, the Red Cross sent in workers to collect the dead. As soon as they entered, the workers were shot by the prisoners, who killed one. The Northern Alliance repeatedly bombarded the area with RPGs and grenade attacks, and burning fuel poured in. Finally, on December 2, 2001, Northern Alliance forces diverted an irrigation stream into the middle of the camp to flush the remaining prisoners out of their underground shelters, drowning many in the process. Lindh and about 85 survivors from the original 300–500 were forced out of hiding. Northern Alliance soldiers bound Lindh&#x27;s elbows behind his back.

Shortly after his recapture, Lindh was noticed and interviewed by Robert Pelton, who was working as a stringer for CNN. Lindh initially gave his name as &quot;Abd-al-Hamid&quot; but later gave his birth name. Pelton brought a medic and food for Lindh and interviewed him about how he got there. During the interview, Lindh said that he was a member of al-Ansar, a group of Arabic-speaking fighters financed by Osama bin Laden. Lindh said that the prison uprising was sparked by some of the prisoners smuggling grenades into the basement: &quot;This is against what we had agreed upon with the Northern Alliance, and this is against Islam. It is a major sin to break a contract, especially in military situations&quot;. A U.S. Army Special Forces operator, fresh from three weeks of combat, gave up his bed so that the wounded Lindh could sleep there. Pelton repeatedly asked Lindh if he wanted to call his parents or have the journalist do so but Lindh declined. Although Lindh was not tested for explosives or firearms residue before he was washed, an FBI source later told author Toby Harnden that dark stains on the right side of Lindh&#x27;s face indicated he had fired a weapon at Qala-i Jangi.

After capture, Lindh was given basic first aid and questioned for a week at Mazār-e Sharīf. He was taken to Camp Rhino on December 7, 2001, the bullet or piece of shrapnel still within his thigh. When Lindh arrived at Camp Rhino, he was stripped and restrained on a stretcher, blindfolded and placed in a metal shipping container, which was procedure for dealing with a potentially dangerous detainee associated with a terrorist organization. On the day he left the Turkish School, he was photographed with the words &quot;Shit Head&quot; written onto duct tape on his blindfold by Green Berets posing for a &quot;team photo&quot; with their captive. The Green Berets, from 592, were later investigated. While bound to the stretcher at Camp Rhino, Lindh was photographed by some American military personnel. At Camp Rhino, he was given oxycodone/paracetamol for pain and diazepam.

On December 8 and 9, he was interviewed by the FBI, and was mirandized on December 9 or 10. He was held at Camp Rhino until he was transferred to the on December 14, 2001, with other wounded detainees, where his wound was operated on and he received further care. He was interrogated before the operation on December 14. While on the &quot;Peleliu&quot;, he signed confession documents while in the custody of the United States Marine Corps. On December 31, 2001, Lindh was transferred to the USS &quot;Bataan&quot;, where he was held until January 22, 2002. He was flown back to the United States to face criminal charges. On January 16, 2002, Attorney General John Ashcroft announced that Lindh would be tried in the United States.

In 2002, former President George H. W. Bush referred to Lindh as &quot;some misguided Marin County hot-tubber&quot;. The comment, in which Bush also mispronounced the county&#x27;s name, provoked a minor furor and prompted a retraction of the statement by Bush. Lindh&#x27;s attorneys told the press that his client had asked for a lawyer repeatedly before being interviewed by the FBI, but did not get one, and that &quot;highly coercive&quot; prison conditions forced Lindh to waive his right to remain silent. Although the FBI asked Jesselyn Radack, a Justice Department ethics adviser, whether Lindh could be questioned without a lawyer present, they did not follow her advice to avoid that scenario.

==Trial and sentencing==
On February 5, 2002, Lindh was indicted by a federal grand jury on ten charges:
* Conspiracy to murder U.S. citizens or nationals
* Two counts of providing material support and resources to terrorist organizations
* One count of supplying services to the Taliban
* Conspiracy to contribute services to Al Qaeda
* Contributing services to Al Qaeda
* Conspiracy to supply services to the Taliban
* Using and carrying firearms and destructive devices during crimes of violence

If convicted of these charges, Lindh could have received up to three life sentences and 90 additional years in prison. On February 13, 2002, he pleaded not guilty to all 10 charges.

The court scheduled an evidence suppression hearing, at which Lindh would have been able to testify about the details of the torture to which he claimed he was subjected. The government faced the problem that a key piece of evidence – Lindh&#x27;s confession – might be excluded from evidence as having been coerced. Michael Chertoff, then-head of the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, then directed the prosecutors to offer Lindh a plea bargain. Lindh could plead guilty to two charges: supplying services to the Taliban (, , 31 CFR 545.204, and 31 CFR 545.206) and carrying an explosive during the commission of a felony (). He would have to consent to a gag order that would prevent him from making any public statements on the matter for the duration of his 20-year sentence, and he would have to drop any claims that he had been mistreated or tortured by U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan and aboard two military ships during December 2001 and January 2002. In return, all other charges would be dropped. The gag order was said to be at the request of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.

Lindh accepted this offer. On July 15, 2002, he entered his plea of guilty to the two remaining charges. The judge asked Lindh to say, in his own words, what he was admitting to: &quot;I plead guilty. I provided my services as a soldier to the Taliban last year from about August to December. In the course of doing so, I carried a rifle and two grenades. I did so knowingly and willingly knowing that it was illegal.&quot; Lindh said that he &quot;went to Afghanistan with the intention of fighting against terrorism and oppression&quot;, fighting for the suffering of ordinary people at the hands of the Northern Alliance. On October 4, 2002, Judge T.S. Ellis III imposed a sentence of 20 years in federal prison.

Some activists and academics called for Lindh to tell his story. The government invoked the Son of Sam law and informed Lindh that any and all profits made from book deals or any movies about Lindh&#x27;s experience would be automatically transferred to the federal government. Lindh, his family, his relatives, his associates and his friends will be unable to profit financially from his crimes and/or experiences. Lindh&#x27;s attorney, James Brosnahan, said Lindh would be eligible for release in 17 years, with good behavior. Lindh agreed to cooperate &quot;fully, truthfully and completely&quot; with both military intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the terrorism investigation.

==Imprisonment==
In January 2003, Lindh was sent to the U.S. Penitentiary, Victorville, a high-security facility northeast of Los Angeles. On March 3, 2003, Lindh was tackled by inmate Richard Dale Morrison. He assaulted Lindh at prayer, causing bruises on his forehead. On July 2, 2003, Morrison was charged with a misdemeanor count of assault. Lindh was held in Federal Supermax ADX Florence in Florence, Colorado for a short time. He served his sentence as prisoner 45426-083, at the Federal Correctional Institution at Terre Haute, Indiana in the Communication Management Unit.

In April 2007, citing the reduced sentence for the Australian prisoner David Matthew Hicks, Lindh&#x27;s attorneys made a public plea for a Presidential commutation to lessen his 20-year sentence. In January 2009, the Lindh family&#x27;s petition for clemency was denied by President George W. Bush in one of his final acts in office. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, all &quot;special administrative measures&quot; in place against Lindh expired on March 20, 2009, as part of a gradual easing of restrictions on him.

In 2010, Lindh and the Syrian-American prisoner Enaam Arnaout sued to lift restrictions on group prayer by Muslim inmates in the Communication Management Unit. On January 11, 2013, a federal judge ruled in their favor, saying that the government had shown no compelling interest in restricting the religious speech of the inmates by prohibiting them from praying together.

In 2013, Lindh secured Irish citizenship through his paternal grandmother, Kathleen Maguire, who was born in Donegal.

In February 2015, Lindh wrote to a California television producer, expressing support for ISIS or the Islamic State, the militant group that had recently beheaded five Westerners in televised executions. Asked if he supported the Islamic State, Lindh, now calling himself &quot;Yahya&quot;, Arabic for John, replied in a handwritten letter: &quot;Yes, and they are doing a spectacular job. The Islamic State is clearly very sincere and serious about fulfilling the long-neglected religious obligation of establishing a caliphate through armed struggle, which is the only correct method&quot;.

In 2017, &quot;Foreign Policy magazine&quot; reported an internal report by the National Counterterrorism Center asserted Lindh told a visiting television news producer that he had not renounced extremist violence. Lindh was interviewed for the 2016 book &quot;The Way of the Strangers: Encounters With the Islamic State&quot; by Graeme Wood, on the condition that Wood provide Lindh with &quot;books, treatises, articles, or other writings produced by leaders of the Islamic State and/or scholars affiliated with it (preferably in the original Arabic)&quot;. Upon sending the package of literature was blocked from delivery by the prison as it was deemed contraband, however Lindh decided to continue corresponding with Wood, although Lindh later ended the correspondence by saying he was personally a &quot;layman&quot; whose opinions had &quot;no consequence&quot;, referring to his knowledge of the Islamic State.

==Release==
On May 23, 2019, Lindh was released early for good behavior from the Terre Haute, Indiana, federal prison prior to the end of his twenty-year sentence, although he accepted several probation requirements due to his continued support of Islamist ideology. These requirements included a ban from internet use and contact with fellow extremists. The probation lasted for the remaining three years of his sentence. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were among many who criticized the release but Trump said: &quot;From a legal standpoint, there&#x27;s nothing we&#x27;re allowed to do.&quot;

<doc id="16472" wikidata="Q202325" url="?curid=16472" title="Jet stream">
<text>Jet streams are fast flowing, narrow air currents in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

The main jet streams are located near the altitude of the tropopause and are westerly winds, flowing west to east around the globe. The northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere each have a polar jet around their respective polar vortex at around above sea level and typically travelling at around although often considerably faster. Closer to the equator and somewhat higher and somewhat weaker is a subtropical jet. 

The northern polar jet flows over the middle to northern latitudes of North America, Europe, and Asia and their intervening oceans, while the southern hemisphere polar jet mostly circles Antarctica. Jet streams may start, stop, split into two or more parts, combine into one stream, or flow in various directions including opposite to the direction of the remainder of the jet. 

The El Niño–Southern Oscillation affects the location of the jet streams, which in turn affects the weather over the tropical Pacific Ocean and affects the climate of much of the tropics and subtropics, and can affect weather in higher-latitude regions. The term &quot;jet stream&quot; is also applied to some other winds at varying levels in the atmosphere, some global (such as the higher-level polar-night jet), some local (such as the African easterly jet). Meteorologists use the location of some of the jet streams as an aid in weather forecasting. Airlines use them to reduce some flight times and fuel consumption. Scientists have considered whether the jet streams might be harnessed for power generation. In World War II, the Japanese used the jet stream to carry Fu-Go balloon bombs across the Pacific Ocean to launch small attacks on North America.

Jet streams have been detected in the atmospheres of Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

==Discovery==
The first indications of this phenomenon came from American professor Elias Loomis (1811–1889), when he proposed the hypothesis of a powerful air current in the upper air blowing west to east across the United States as an explanation for the behaviour of major storms. After the 1883 eruption of the Krakatoa volcano, weather watchers tracked and mapped the effects on the sky over several years. They labelled the phenomenon the &quot;equatorial smoke stream&quot;. In the 1920s Japanese meteorologist Wasaburo Oishi detected the jet stream from a site near Mount Fuji. He tracked pilot balloons (&quot;pibals&quot;), used to measure wind speed and direction, as they rose in the air. Oishi&#x27;s work largely went unnoticed outside Japan because it was published in Esperanto, though chronologically he has to be credited for the scientific discovery of jet streams. American pilot Wiley Post (1898–1935), the first man to fly around the world solo in 1933, is often given some credit for discovery of jet streams. Post invented a pressurized suit that let him fly above . In the year before his death, Post made several attempts at a high-altitude transcontinental flight, and noticed that at times his ground speed greatly exceeded his air speed.

German meteorologist Heinrich Seilkopf is credited with coining a special term, &quot;Strahlströmung&quot; (literally &quot;jet current&quot;), for the phenomenon in 1939. Many sources credit real understanding of the nature of jet streams to regular and repeated flight-path traversals during World War II. Flyers consistently noticed westerly tailwinds in excess of in flights, for example, from the US to the UK. Similarly in 1944 a team of American meteorologists in Guam, including Reid Bryson, had enough observations to forecast very high west winds that would slow bombers raiding Japan.

==Description==

The polar and subtropical jet streams are the product of two factors: the atmospheric heating by solar radiation that produces the large-scale polar, Ferrel, and Hadley circulation cells, and the action of the Coriolis force acting on those moving masses. The Coriolis force is caused by the planet&#x27;s rotation on its axis. The polar jet stream forms near the interface of the polar and Ferrel circulation cells; the subtropical jet forms near the boundary of the Ferrel and Hadley circulation cells.

Polar jet streams are typically located near the 250 hPa (about 1/4 atmosphere) pressure level, or above sea level while the weaker subtropical jet streams are somewhat higher.

The polar jets, at lower altitude, and often intruding into mid-latitudes, strongly affect weather and aviation. The polar jet stream is most commonly found between latitudes 30° and 60° (closer to 60°), while the subtropical jet streams are located close to latitude 30°. These two jets merge at some locations and times, while at other times they are well separated. The northern polar jet stream is said to &quot;follow the sun&quot; as it slowly migrates northward as that hemisphere warms, and southward again as it cools.

The width of a jet stream is typically a few hundred kilometres or miles and its vertical thickness often less than .

Jet streams are typically continuous over long distances, but discontinuities are also common. The path of the jet typically has a meandering shape, and these meanders themselves propagate eastward, at lower speeds than that of the actual wind within the flow. Further, the meanders can split or form eddies.

Each large meander, or wave, within the jet stream is known as a Rossby wave (planetary wave). Rossby waves are caused by changes in the Coriolis effect with latitude. Shortwave troughs, are smaller scale waves superimposed on the Rossby waves, with a scale of long, that move along through the flow pattern around large scale, or longwave, &quot;ridges&quot; and &quot;troughs&quot; within Rossby waves.

The wind speeds are greatest where temperature differences between air masses are greatest, and often exceed . Speeds of have been measured.

The jet stream moves from west to east bringing changes of weather. The path of jet streams affects cyclonic storm systems at lower levels in the atmosphere, and so knowledge of their course has become an important part of weather forecasting. For example, in 2007 and 2012, Britain experienced severe flooding as a result of the polar jet staying south for the summer.

==Cause==

In general, winds are strongest immediately under the tropopause (except locally, during tornadoes, tropical cyclones or other anomalous situations). If two air masses of different temperatures or densities meet, the resulting pressure difference caused by the density difference (which ultimately causes wind) is highest within the transition zone. The wind does not flow directly from the hot to the cold area, but is deflected by the Coriolis effect and flows along the boundary of the two air masses.

All these facts are consequences of the thermal wind relation. The balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on the mass of the parcel and the buoyancy force, or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the parcel. Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction: upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight, and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force. The balance in the vertical direction is referred to as hydrostatic. Beyond the tropics, the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction, and the primary struggle is between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. Balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic. Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, one can derive the thermal wind relation: the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient. If two air masses in the northern hemisphere, one cold and dense to the north and the other hot and less dense to the south, are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed, the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass. The Coriolis effect will then cause poleward-moving mass to deviate to the East, while equatorward-moving mass will deviate toward the west. The general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction. As a result, winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude. Therefore, the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence of the fact that the Equator is warmer than the north and south poles.

===Polar jet stream===
The thermal wind relation does not explain why the winds are organized into tight jets, rather than distributed more broadly over the hemisphere. One factor that contributes to the creation of a concentrated polar jet is the undercutting of sub-tropical air masses by the more dense polar air masses at the polar front. This causes a sharp north–south pressure (south–north potential vorticity) gradient in the horizontal plane, an effect which is most significant during double Rossby wave breaking events. At high altitudes, lack of friction allows air to respond freely to the steep pressure gradient with low pressure at high altitude over the pole. This results in the formation of planetary wind circulations that experience a strong Coriolis deflection and thus can be considered &#x27;quasi-geostrophic&#x27;. The polar front jet stream is closely linked to the frontogenesis process in midlatitudes, as the acceleration/deceleration of the air flow induces areas of low/high pressure respectively, which link to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones along the polar front in a relatively narrow region.

===Subtropical jet===
A second factor which contributes to a concentrated jet is more applicable to the subtropical jet which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical Hadley cell, and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air rises to the tropopause, and moves poleward before sinking; this is the Hadley cell circulation. As it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum, since friction with the ground is slight. Air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the Coriolis force (true for either hemisphere), which for poleward moving air implies an increased westerly component of the winds

==Effects==
===Hurricane protection===

The subtropical jet stream rounding the base of the mid-oceanic upper trough is thought to be one of the causes most of the Hawaiian Islands have been resistant to the long list of Hawaii hurricanes that have approached. For example, when Hurricane Flossie (2007) approached and dissipated just before reaching landfall, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) cited vertical wind shear as evidenced in the photo.
== Uses ==

The northern polar jet stream is the most important one for aviation and weather forecasting, as it is much stronger and at a much lower altitude than the subtropical jet streams and also covers many countries in the northern hemisphere, while the southern polar jet stream mostly circles Antarctica and sometimes the southern tip of South America.

=== Aviation ===

The location of the jet stream is important for aviation. Aircraft flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against it. Often, airlines work to fly with the jet stream to obtain significant fuel cost and time savings.

Commercial use of the jet stream began on 18 November 1952, when Pan Am flew from Tokyo to Honolulu at an altitude of . It cut the trip time by over one-third, from 18 to 11.5 hours.

Within North America, the time needed to fly east across the continent can be decreased by about 30 minutes if an airplane can fly with the jet stream. Across the Atlantic Ocean the North Atlantic Tracks service allows airlines and air traffic control to accommodate the jet stream for the benefit for airlines and other users.

Associated with jet streams is a phenomenon known as clear-air turbulence (CAT), caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear caused by jet streams. The CAT is strongest on the cold air side of the jet, next to and just under the axis of the jet. Clear-air turbulence can cause aircraft to plunge and so present a passenger safety hazard that has caused fatal accidents, such as the death of one passenger on United Airlines Flight 826 in 1997. Unusual wind speed in the jet stream in late February 2024 pushed commercial jets to excess of relative to the ground.

===Possible future power generation===
Scientists are investigating ways to harness the wind energy within the jet stream. According to one estimate of the potential wind energy in the jet stream, only one percent would be needed to meet the world&#x27;s current energy needs. In the late 2000s it was estimated that the required technology would reportedly take 10–20 years to develop.
There are two major but divergent scientific articles about jet stream power. Archer &amp; Caldeira claim that the Earth&#x27;s jet streams could generate a total power of 1700 terawatts (TW) and that the climatic impact of harnessing this amount would be negligible. However, Miller, Gans, &amp; Kleidon claim that the jet streams could generate a total power of only 7.5 TW and lacks the potential to make a significant contribution to renewable energy.

===Unpowered aerial attack===
Near the end of World War II, from late 1944 until early 1945, the Japanese Fu-Go balloon bomb, a type of fire balloon, was designed as a cheap weapon intended to make use of the jet stream over the Pacific Ocean to reach the west coast of Canada and the United States. Relatively ineffective as weapons, they were used in one of the few attacks on North America during World War II, causing six deaths and a small amount of damage. American scientists studying the balloons thought the Japanese might be preparing a biological attack.

==Changes due to climate cycles==

===Effects of ENSO===
El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences the average location of upper-level jet streams, and leads to cyclical variations in precipitation and temperature across North America, as well as affecting tropical cyclone development across the eastern Pacific and Atlantic basins. Combined with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, ENSO can also impact cold season rainfall in Europe. Changes in ENSO also change the location of the jet stream over South America, which partially affects precipitation distribution over the continent.

====El Niño====
During El Niño events, increased precipitation is expected in California due to a more southerly, zonal, storm track. During the Niño portion of ENSO, increased precipitation falls along the Gulf coast and Southeast due to a stronger than normal, and more southerly, polar jet stream. Snowfall is greater than average across the southern Rockies and Sierra Nevada mountain range, and is well below normal across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes states. The northern tier of the lower 48 exhibits above normal temperatures during the fall and winter, while the Gulf coast experiences below normal temperatures during the winter season. The subtropical jet stream across the deep tropics of the northern hemisphere is enhanced due to increased convection in the equatorial Pacific, which decreases tropical cyclogenesis within the Atlantic tropics below what is normal, and increases tropical cyclone activity across the eastern Pacific. In the southern hemisphere, the subtropical jet stream is displaced equatorward, or north, of its normal position, which diverts frontal systems and thunderstorm complexes from reaching central portions of the continent.

====La Niña====
Across North America during La Niña, increased precipitation is diverted into the Pacific Northwest due to a more northerly storm track and jet stream. The storm track shifts far enough northward to bring wetter than normal conditions (in the form of increased snowfall) to the Midwestern states, as well as hot and dry summers. Snowfall is above normal across the Pacific Northwest and western Great Lakes. Across the North Atlantic, the jet stream is stronger than normal, which directs stronger systems with increased precipitation towards Europe.

===Dust Bowl===
Evidence suggests the jet stream was at least partly responsible for the widespread drought conditions during the 1930s Dust Bowl in the Midwest United States. Normally, the jet stream flows east over the Gulf of Mexico and turns northward pulling up moisture and dumping rain onto the Great Plains. During the Dust Bowl, the jet stream weakened and changed course traveling farther south than normal. This starved the Great Plains and other areas of the Midwest of rainfall, causing extraordinary drought conditions.

==Longer-term climatic changes==

Since the early 2000s, climate models have consistently identified that global warming will gradually push jet streams poleward. In 2008, this was confirmed by observational evidence, which proved that from 1979 to 2001, the northern jet stream moved northward at an average rate of per year, with a similar trend in the southern hemisphere jet stream. Climate scientists have hypothesized that the jet stream will also gradually weaken as a result of global warming. Trends such as Arctic sea ice decline, reduced snow cover, evapotranspiration patterns, and other weather anomalies have caused the Arctic to heat up faster than other parts of the globe, in what is known as the Arctic amplification. In 2021–2022, it was found that since 1979, the warming within the Arctic Circle has been nearly four times faster than the global average, and some hotspots in the Barents Sea area warmed up to seven times faster than the global average. While the Arctic remains one of the coldest places on Earth today, the temperature gradient between it and the warmer parts of the globe will continue to diminish with every decade of global warming as the result of this amplification. If this gradient has a strong influence on the jet stream, then it will eventually become weaker and more variable in its course, which would allow more cold air from the polar vortex to leak mid-latitudes and slow the progression of Rossby waves, leading to more persistent and more extreme weather.

The hypothesis above is closely associated with Jennifer Francis, who had first proposed it in a 2012 paper co-authored by Stephen J. Vavrus. While some paleoclimate reconstructions have suggested that the polar vortex becomes more variable and causes more unstable weather during periods of warming back in 1997, this was contradicted by climate modelling, with PMIP2 simulations finding in 2010 that the Arctic Oscillation (AO) was much weaker and more negative during the Last Glacial Maximum, and suggesting that warmer periods have stronger positive phase AO, and thus less frequent leaks of the polar vortex air. However, a 2012 review in the &quot;Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences&quot; noted that &quot;there [has been] a significant change in the vortex mean state over the twenty-first century, resulting in a weaker, more disturbed vortex.&quot;, which contradicted the modelling results but fit the Francis-Vavrus hypothesis. Additionally, a 2013 study noted that the then-current CMIP5 tended to strongly underestimate winter blocking trends, and other 2012 research had suggested a connection between declining Arctic sea ice and heavy snowfall during midlatitude winters.

In 2013, further research from Francis connected reductions in the Arctic sea ice to extreme summer weather in the northern mid-latitudes, while other research from that year identified potential linkages between Arctic sea ice trends and more extreme rainfall in the European summer. At the time, it was also suggested that this connection between Arctic amplification and jet stream patterns was involved in the formation of Hurricane Sandy and played a role in the early 2014 North American cold wave. In 2015, Francis&#x27; next study concluded that highly amplified jet-stream patterns are occurring more frequently in the past two decades. Hence, continued heat-trapping emissions favour increased formation of extreme events caused by prolonged weather conditions.

Studies published in 2017 and 2018 identified stalling patterns of Rossby waves in the northern hemisphere jet stream as the culprit behind other almost stationary extreme weather events, such as the 2018 European heatwave, the 2003 European heat wave, 2010 Russian heat wave or the 2010 Pakistan floods, and suggested that these patterns were all connected to Arctic amplification. Further work from Francis and Vavrus that year suggested that amplified Arctic warming is observed as stronger in lower atmospheric areas because the expanding process of warmer air increases pressure levels which decreases poleward geopotential height gradients. As these gradients are the reason that cause west to east winds through the thermal wind relationship, declining speeds are usually found south of the areas with geopotential increases. In 2017, Francis explained her findings to the &quot;Scientific American&quot;: &quot;A lot more water vapor is being transported northward by big swings in the jet stream. That&#x27;s important because water vapor is a greenhouse gas just like carbon dioxide and methane. It traps heat in the atmosphere. That vapor also condenses as droplets we know as clouds, which themselves trap more heat. The vapor is a big part of the amplification story—a big reason the Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else.&quot;

In a 2017 study conducted by climatologist Judah Cohen and several of his research associates, Cohen wrote that &quot;[the] shift in polar vortex states can account for &quot;most&quot; of the recent winter cooling trends over Eurasian midlatitudes&quot;. A 2018 paper from Vavrus and others linked Arctic amplification to more persistent hot-dry extremes during the midlatitude summers, as well as the midlatitude winter continental cooling. Another 2017 paper estimated that when the Arctic experiences anomalous warming, primary production in North America goes down by between 1% and 4% on average, with some states suffering up to 20% losses. A 2021 study found that a stratospheric polar vortex disruption is linked with extreme cold winter weather across parts of Asia and North America, including the February 2021 North American cold wave. Another 2021 study identified a connection between the Arctic sea ice loss and the increased size of wildfires in the Western United States.

However, because the specific observations are considered short-term observations, there is considerable uncertainty in the conclusions. Climatology observations require several decades to definitively distinguish various forms of natural variability from climate trends. This point was stressed by reviews in 2013 and in 2017. A study in 2014 concluded that Arctic amplification significantly decreased cold-season temperature variability over the northern hemisphere in recent decades. Cold Arctic air intrudes into the warmer lower latitudes more rapidly today during autumn and winter, a trend projected to continue in the future except during summer, thus calling into question whether winters will bring more cold extremes. A 2019 analysis of a data set collected from 35 182 weather stations worldwide, including 9116 whose records go beyond 50 years, found a sharp decrease in northern midlatitude cold waves since the 1980s.

Moreover, a range of long-term observational data collected during the 2010s and published in 2020 suggests that the intensification of Arctic amplification since the early 2010s was not linked to significant changes on mid-latitude atmospheric patterns. State-of-the-art modelling research of PAMIP (Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project) improved upon the 2010 findings of PMIP2; it found that sea ice decline would weaken the jet stream and increase the probability of atmospheric blocking, but the connection was very minor, and typically insignificant next to interannual variability. In 2022, a follow-up study found that while the PAMIP average had likely underestimated the weakening caused by sea ice decline by 1.2 to 3 times, even the corrected connection still amounts to only 10% of the jet stream&#x27;s natural variability.

Additionally, a 2021 study found that while jet streams had indeed slowly moved polewards since 1960 as was predicted by models, they did not weaken, in spite of a small increase in waviness. A 2022 re-analysis of the aircraft observational data collected over 2002–2020 suggested that the North Atlantic jet stream had actually strengthened. Finally, a 2021 study was able to reconstruct jet stream patterns over the past 1,250 years based on Greenland ice cores, and found that all of the recently observed changes remain within range of natural variability: the earliest likely time of divergence is in 2060, under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 which implies continually accelerating greenhouse gas emissions.

==Other upper-level jets==

===Polar night jet===
The polar-night jet stream forms mainly during the winter months when the nights are much longer – hence the name referencing polar nights – in their respective hemispheres at around 60° latitude. The polar night jet moves at a greater height (about ) than it does during the summer. During these dark months the air high over the poles becomes much colder than the air over the Equator. This difference in temperature gives rise to extreme air pressure differences in the stratosphere which, when combined with the Coriolis effect, create the polar night jets, that race eastward at an altitude of about . The polar vortex is circled by the polar night jet. The warmer air can only move along the edge of the polar vortex, but not enter it. Within the vortex, the cold polar air becomes increasingly cold, due to a lack of warmer air from lower latitudes as well as a lack of energy from the Sun entering during the polar night.

==Low-level jets==
There are wind maxima at lower levels of the atmosphere that are also referred to as jets.

===Barrier jet===
A barrier jet in the low levels forms just upstream of mountain chains, with the mountains forcing the jet to be oriented parallel to the mountains. The mountain barrier increases the strength of the low level wind by 45 percent. In the North American Great Plains a southerly low-level jet helps fuel overnight thunderstorm activity during the warm season, normally in the form of mesoscale convective systems which form during the overnight hours. A similar phenomenon develops across Australia, which pulls moisture poleward from the Coral Sea towards cut-off lows which form mainly across southwestern portions of the continent.

===Coastal jet===
Coastal low-level jets are related to a sharp contrast between high temperatures over land and lower temperatures over the sea and play an important role in coastal weather, giving rise to strong coast parallel winds. Most coastal jets are associated with the oceanic high-pressure systems and thermal low over land and are mainly located along cold eastern boundary marine currents, in upwelling regions offshore California, Peru–Chile, Benguela, Portugal, Canary and West Australia, and offshore Yemen–Oman.

===Valley exit jet===
A valley exit jet is a strong, down-valley, elevated air current that emerges above the intersection of the valley and its adjacent plain. These winds frequently reach speeds of up to at heights of above the ground. Surface winds below the jet tend to be substantially weaker, even when they are strong enough to sway vegetation.

Valley exit jets are likely to be found in valley regions that exhibit mountain wind systems, such as those of the dry mountain ranges of the US. Deep valleys that terminate abruptly at a plain are more impacted by these factors than are those that gradually become shallower as downvalley distance increases.

===Africa===

There are several important low-level jets in Africa. Numerous low-level jets form in the Sahara, and are important for the raising of dust off the desert surface. This includes a low-level jet in Chad, which is responsible for dust emission from the Bodélé Depression, the world&#x27;s most important single source of dust emission. The Somali Jet, which forms off the East African coast is an important component of the global Hadley circulation, and supplies water vapour to the Asian Monsoon. Easterly low-level jets forming in valleys within the East African Rift System help account for the low rainfall in East Africa and support high rainfall in the Congo Basin rainforest. The formation of the thermal low over northern Africa leads to a low-level westerly jet stream from June into October, which provides the moist inflow to the West African monsoon.

While not technically a low-level jet, the mid-level African easterly jet (at 3000–4000 m above the surface) is also an important climate feature in Africa. It occurs during the northern hemisphere summer between 10°N and 20°N above in the Sahel region of West Africa. It is considered to play a crucial role in the West African monsoon, and helps form the tropical waves which move across the tropical Atlantic and eastern Pacific oceans during the warm season.

==Other planets==

For other planets, internal heat rather than solar heating is believed to drive their jet streams. 
Jupiter&#x27;s atmosphere has multiple jet streams caused by the convection cells driven by internal heating. These form the familiar banded color structure.

<text>Joint Interoperability of Tactical Command and Control Systems or JINTACCS is a program of the United States Department of Defense for the development and maintenance of tactical information exchange configuration items (CIs) and operational procedures. It was originated in 1977 to ensure that the command and control (C2 and C3) and weapons systems of all US military services and NATO forces would be compatible.

It is made up of standard Message Text Formats (MTF) for man-readable and machine-processable information, a core set of common warfighting symbols, and data link standards called Tactical Data Links (TDLs).

JINTACCS was initiated by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1977 as a successor to the Joint Interoperability of Tactical Command and Control Systems in Support of Ground and Amphibious Military Operations (1971-1977). As of 1982 the command was hosted at Fort Monmouth in Monmouth County, New Jersey, and employed 39 military people and 23 civilians.

<text>John David Ashcroft (born May 9, 1942) is an American lawyer, lobbyist, and former politician who served as the 79th United States attorney general under President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2005. A Republican from Missouri, Ashcroft represented the state in the United States Senate from 1995 to 2001, and held statewide office as the 29th auditor (1973–1975), 38th attorney general (1976–1985), and 50th governor of Missouri (1985–1993). He later founded The Ashcroft Group, a Washington D.C. lobbying firm.

Ashcroft graduated from Hillcrest High School in 1960 before receiving a J.D. from the University of Chicago Law School. After unsuccessfully running for the U.S. House of Representatives, he was elected Missouri State Auditor in 1974. He then served two consecutive terms as Missouri Attorney General and as Missouri Governor (a historical first for a Republican candidate in the state). He is the only Republican to serve two full consecutive terms as governor to date. He also served one term as a U.S. Senator from Missouri until losing a race for a second term in 2000. Ashcroft had early appointments in Missouri state government and was mentored by John Danforth. He has written several books about politics and ethics.

After George W. Bush was elected president in 2000, he selected Ashcroft to serve as U.S. Attorney General. As Attorney General, Ashcroft was a key supporter of the USA Patriot Act following the September 11 attacks and the use of torture to suspected terrorists. Ashcroft stepped down as Attorney General in February 2005 and was replaced by Alberto Gonzales. Since 2011, Ashcroft sits on the board of directors for the private military company Academi (formerly Blackwater) and is a professor at the Regent University School of Law, a conservative Christian institution affiliated with the late televangelist Pat Robertson; he has also been a member of the Federalist Society. His son, Jay Ashcroft, is also a politician who served as Secretary of State of Missouri from 2017 to 2025 before a failed bid for governor in 2024.

==Early life==
John David Ashcroft was born in Chicago on May 9, 1942, the son of homemaker Grace P. (née Larsen) and minister James Robert Ashcroft. His maternal grandparents were Norwegian, while his paternal grandfather was Irish. He grew up in Willard, Missouri, where his father was a minister in an Assemblies of God congregation in nearby Springfield, served as president of Evangel University (1958–1974), and jointly as President of Central Bible College (1958–1963). Ashcroft graduated from Hillcrest High School in 1960. He attended Yale University, where he was a member of the St. Elmo Society, graduating in 1964. He received a Juris Doctor from the University of Chicago Law School in 1967. After law school, he briefly taught Business Law and worked as an administrator at Southwest Missouri State University. During the Vietnam War, he was not drafted because he received six student draft deferments and one occupational deferment due to his teaching work.

==Missouri political career==
===State Auditor (1973–1975)===
In 1972, Ashcroft ran for a congressional seat in southwest Missouri in the Republican primary election, narrowly losing to Gene Taylor. After the primary, Missouri Governor Kit Bond appointed Ashcroft to the office of State Auditor, which Bond had vacated when he became governor.

In 1974, Ashcroft was narrowly defeated for election to that post by Jackson County Executive George W. Lehr. Lehr had argued that Ashcroft, who is not an accountant, was not qualified to be the State Auditor.

===Attorney General of Missouri (1976–1985)===

Missouri Attorney General John Danforth, who was then in his second term, hired Ashcroft as an assistant state attorney general. During his service, Ashcroft shared an office with future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas (and, in 2001, Justice Thomas administered Ashcroft&#x27;s oath of office as U.S. attorney general).

In 1976, Danforth retired from the state attorney general post to run for the U.S. Senate, and Ashcroft ran to replace him. He was unopposed in the Republican primary and defeated Democrat James Baker in the general election. He was scheduled to be sworn in on January 10, 1977, but Danforth resigned from his post early ahead of his swearing in to the U.S. Senate, thus Ashcroft became attorney general on December 27, 1976. In 1980, Ashcroft was re-elected with 64.5 percent of the vote, winning 96 of Missouri&#x27;s 114 counties.

In 1983, Ashcroft wrote the leading &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief in the U.S. Supreme Court Case &quot;Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.&quot;, supporting the use of video cassette recorders for time shifting of television programs.

===Governor of Missouri (1985–1993)===

Ashcroft was elected governor in 1984 and re-elected in 1988, becoming the first Republican in Missouri history elected to two consecutive terms.
In 1984, his opponent was the Democratic Lieutenant Governor Ken Rothman. The campaign was so negative on both sides that a reporter described the contest as &quot;two alley cats [scrapping] over truth in advertising&quot;. In his campaign ads, Ashcroft showed the contrast between his rural base and the urban supporters of his opponent from St. Louis. Democrats did not close ranks on primary night. The defeated candidate Mel Carnahan endorsed Rothman. In the end, Ashcroft won 57 percent of the vote and carried 106 counties—then the largest Republican gubernatorial victory in Missouri history.

In 1988, Ashcroft won by a larger margin over his Democratic opponent, Betty Cooper Hearnes, the wife of the former governor Warren Hearnes. Ashcroft received 64 percent of the vote in the general election—the largest landslide for governor in Missouri history since the U.S. Civil War.

During his second term, Ashcroft served as chairman of the National Governors Association (1991–92).

===U.S. Senator from Missouri (1995–2001)===

In 1994, Ashcroft was elected to the U.S. Senate from Missouri, again succeeding John Danforth, who retired from the position. Ashcroft won 59.8% of the vote against Democratic Congressman Alan Wheat. As Senator:
* He opposed the Clinton Administration&#x27;s Clipper encryption restrictions, arguing in favor of the individual&#x27;s right to encrypt messages and export encryption software.
* In 1999, as chair of the Senate&#x27;s subcommittee on patents, he helped extend patents for several drugs, notably the allergy medication Claritin, to prevent the marketing of less-expensive generics.
* On March 30, 2000, with Senator Russ Feingold, Ashcroft convened the only Senate hearing on racial profiling. He said the practice was unconstitutional and that he supported legislation requiring police to keep statistics on their actions.

In 1998, Ashcroft briefly considered running for U.S. president, but, on January 5, 1999, he decided that he would seek re-election to his Senate seat in the 2000 election and not run for president.

In the Republican primary, Ashcroft defeated Marc Perkel. In the general election, Ashcroft faced a challenge from Governor Mel Carnahan.

In the midst of a tight race, Carnahan died in an airplane crash three weeks prior to the election. Ashcroft suspended all campaigning after the plane crash. Because of Missouri state election laws and the short time to election, Carnahan&#x27;s name remained on the ballot. Lieutenant Governor Roger B. Wilson became governor upon Carnahan&#x27;s death. Wilson said that should Carnahan be elected, he would appoint his widow, Jean Carnahan, to serve in her husband&#x27;s place. Mrs. Carnahan stated that, in accordance with her late husband&#x27;s goal, she would serve in the Senate if voters elected his name. Following these developments, Ashcroft resumed campaigning.

Carnahan won the election 51% to 49%. No politician had ever posthumously won election to the U.S. Senate, although voters had on at least three occasions chosen deceased candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives. Ashcroft remains the first and so far only U.S. Senator to have been defeated for re-election by a deceased person.

==United States Attorney General==

In December 2000, following his Senatorial defeat, Ashcroft was chosen for the position of U.S. attorney general by president-elect George W. Bush. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate by a vote of 58 to 42, with most Democratic senators voting against him, citing his prior opposition to using busing to achieve school desegregation, and their opposition to Ashcroft&#x27;s opposition to abortion. At the time of his appointment, he was known to be a member of the Federalist Society.

In May 2001, the FBI revealed that they had misplaced thousands of documents related to the investigation of the Oklahoma City bombing. Ashcroft granted a 30-day stay of execution for Timothy McVeigh, the man sentenced to death for the bombing.

In July 2001, Ashcroft began flying exclusively by private jet. When questioned about this decision, the Justice Department explained that this course of action had been recommended based on a &quot;threat assessment&quot; made by the FBI. Neither the Bureau, nor the Justice Department would identify the specific nature of the threat, who made it, or when it happened. The CIA were unaware of any specific threats against Cabinet members. At the time, Ashcroft was the only Cabinet appointee who traveled on a private jet, excluding the special cases of Interior and Energy who have responsibilities which require chartered jets.

After the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, Ashcroft was a key administration supporter of passage of the USA PATRIOT Act. One of its provisions, Section 215, allows the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to apply for an order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to require production of &quot;any tangible thing&quot; for an investigation. This provision was criticized by citizen and professional groups concerned about violations of privacy. Ashcroft referred to the American Library Association&#x27;s opposition to Section 215 as &quot;hysteria&quot; in two separate speeches given in September 2003. While Attorney General, Ashcroft consistently denied that the FBI or any other law enforcement agency had used the Patriot Act to obtain library circulation records or those of retail sales. According to the sworn testimony of two FBI agents interviewed by the 9/11 Commission, he ignored warnings of an imminent al-Qaida attack.

In January 2002, the partially nude female statue of the &quot;Spirit of Justice&quot; in the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building, where Ashcroft held press conferences, was covered with blue curtains. Department officials long insisted that the curtains were put up to improve the room&#x27;s use as a television backdrop and that Ashcroft had nothing to do with it. Ashcroft&#x27;s successor, Alberto Gonzales, removed the curtains in June 2005. Ashcroft also held daily prayer meetings.

In July 2002, Ashcroft proposed the creation of Operation TIPS, a domestic program in which workers and government employees would inform law enforcement agencies about suspicious behavior they encounter while performing their duties. The program was widely criticized from the beginning, with critics deriding the program as essentially a domestic informant network along the lines of the East German Stasi or the Soviet KGB, and an encroachment upon the First and Fourth amendments. The United States Postal Service refused to be a party to it. Ashcroft defended the program as a necessary component of the ongoing War on Terrorism, but the proposal was eventually abandoned.

Ashcroft proposed a draft of the Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003, legislation to expand the powers of the U.S. government to fight crime and terrorism, while simultaneously eliminating or curtailing judicial review of these powers for incidents related to domestic terrorism. The bill was leaked and posted to the Internet on February 7, 2003.

On May 26, 2004, Ashcroft held a news conference at which he said that intelligence from multiple sources indicated that the terrorist organization, al Qaeda, intended to attack the United States in the coming months. Critics suggested he was trying to distract attention from a drop in the approval ratings of President Bush, who was campaigning for re-election.

Groups supporting individual gun ownership praised Ashcroft&#x27;s support through DOJ for the Second Amendment. He said specifically, &quot;the Second Amendment protects an individual&#x27;s right to keep and bear arms,&quot; expressing the position that the Second Amendment protects an individual right, unrelated to militia service.

In March 2004, the Justice Department under Ashcroft ruled President Bush&#x27;s domestic intelligence program illegal. Shortly afterward, Ashcroft was hospitalized with acute gallstone pancreatitis. White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales and Chief of Staff Andrew Card Jr. went to Ashcroft&#x27;s bedside in the hospital intensive-care unit, to persuade the incapacitated Ashcroft to sign a document to reauthorize the program. Acting Attorney General James Comey alerted FBI Director Robert Mueller III of this plan, and rushed to the hospital, arriving ahead of Gonzales and Card Jr. Ashcroft, &quot;summoning the strength to lift his head and speak&quot;, refused to sign. Attempts to reauthorize the program were ended by President Bush when Ashcroft, Comey and Mueller threatened to resign.

Following accounts of the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal in Iraq, one of the torture memos was leaked to the press in June 2004. Jack Goldsmith, then head of the Office of Legal Counsel, had already withdrawn the Yoo memos and advised agencies not to rely on them. After Goldsmith chose to resign because of his objections, Ashcroft issued a one paragraph opinion re-authorizing the use of torture.

Ashcroft pushed his U.S. attorneys to pursue voter fraud cases. However, the U.S. attorneys struggled to find any deliberate voter fraud schemes, only finding individuals who made mistakes on forms or misunderstood whether they were eligible to vote.

Following George W. Bush&#x27;s re-election, Ashcroft resigned, which took effect on February 3, 2005, after the Senate confirmed White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales as the next attorney general. Ashcroft said in his hand-written resignation letter, dated November 2, &quot;The objective of securing the safety of Americans from crime and terror has been achieved.&quot;

==Consultant and lobbyist==
In May 2005, Ashcroft laid the groundwork for a strategic consulting firm, The Ashcroft Group, LLC. He started operation in the fall of 2005 and as of March 2006 had twenty-one clients, turning down two for every one accepted. In 2005 year-end filings, Ashcroft&#x27;s firm reported collecting $269,000, including $220,000 from Oracle Corporation, which won Department of Justice approval of a multibillion-dollar acquisition less than a month after hiring Ashcroft. The year-end filing represented, in some cases, only initial payments.

According to government filings, Oracle is one of five Ashcroft Group clients that seek help in selling data or software with security applications. Another client, Israel Aircraft Industries International, is competing with Seattle&#x27;s Boeing Company to sell the government of South Korea a billion dollar airborne radar system.

In March 2006, Ashcroft positioned himself as an &quot;anti-Abramoff&quot;. In an hour-long interview, Ashcroft used the word &quot;integrity&quot; scores of times. In May 2006, based on conversations with members of Congress, key aides and lobbyists, &quot;The Hill&quot; magazine listed Ashcroft as one of the top 50 &quot;hired guns&quot; (lobbyists) that K Street had to offer.

By August 2006, Ashcroft&#x27;s firm reportedly had 30 clients, many of which made products or technology aimed at homeland security. About a third of its client list were not disclosed on grounds of confidentiality. The firm also had equity stakes in eight client companies. It reportedly received $1.4 million in lobbying fees in the six months preceding August 2006, a small fraction of its total earnings.

After the proposed merger of Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. and XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc., Ashcroft offered the firm his consulting services, according to a spokesman for XM. The spokesman said XM declined Ashcroft&#x27;s offer. Ashcroft was subsequently hired by the National Association of Broadcasters, which is strongly opposed to the merger.

In 2011, Ashcroft became an &quot;independent director&quot; on the board of Xe Services (now Academi), the controversial private military company formerly known as Blackwater (Nisour Square massacre), which faced scores of charges related to weapons trafficking, unlawful force, and corruption, and had named Ted Wright as CEO in May 2011. Wright hired a new governance chief to oversee ethical and legal compliance and established a new board composed of former government officials, including former White House counsel Jack Quinn and Ashcroft. In December 2011, Xe Services rebranded to Academi to convey a more &quot;boring&quot; image.

The firm also has a law firm under its umbrella, called the Ashcroft Law Firm. In December 2014, the law firm was hired by convicted Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout to overturn his 2011 conviction.

In June 2017, the Ashcroft Law firm was hired by the government of Qatar to carry out a compliance and regulatory review of Qatar&#x27;s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing framework, to help challenge accusations of supporting terrorism by its neighbors, following a regional blockade, as well as claims by U.S. President Donald Trump.

In June 2018, Ashcroft was reportedly hired by Najib Razak among other top U.S. lawyers to defend him in the 1MDB scandal, back in 2016. According to the document, the firm was hired to provide legal advice and counsel to Najib regarding &quot;improper actions by third parties to attempt to destabilise the government of Malaysia&quot;. Although it is unsure whether Najib will retain the services of Ashcroft on the issue due to the United States Department of Justice&#x27;s probe into 1MDB.

==Political issues==


In 2009 in &quot;Ashcroft v. al-Kidd&quot;, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco found that Ashcroft could be sued and held personally responsible for the wrongful detention of Abdullah al-Kidd. The American citizen was arrested at Dulles International Airport in March 2003 on his way to Saudi Arabia for study. He was held for 15 days in maximum security in three states, and 13 months in supervised release, to be used as a material witness in the trial of Sami Omar Al-Hussayen. (The latter was acquitted of all charges of supporting terrorism.) Al-Kidd was never charged and was not called as a witness in the Al-Hussayen case.

The panels court described the government&#x27;s assertions under the USA Patriot Act (2001) as &quot;repugnant of the Constitution&quot;. In a detailed and at times passionate opinion, Judge Milan Smith likened allegations against al-Kidd as similar to the repressive practices of the British Crown that sparked the American Revolution. He wrote that the government asserts it can detain American citizens &quot;not because there is evidence that they have committed a crime, but merely because the government wishes to investigate them for possible wrongdoing&quot;. He called it &quot;a painful reminder of some of the most ignominious chapters of our national history&quot;.

Abdullah Al-Kidd was held in a maximum security prison for 16 days, and in supervised release for 13 months. Al-Kidd was born Lavoni T. Kidd in 1973 in Wichita, Kansas. When he converted to Islam as a student at the University of Idaho, where he was a prominent football player, he changed his name. He asserts that Ashcroft violated his civil liberties as an American citizen, as he was treated like a terrorist and not allowed to consult an attorney. Al-Kidd&#x27;s lawyers say Ashcroft, as US attorney general, encouraged authorities after 9/11 to arrest potential suspects as material witnesses when they lacked probable cause to believe the suspects had committed a crime.

The US Supreme Court agreed on October 18, 2010, to hear the case. On May 31, 2011, the US Supreme Court unanimously overturned the lower court&#x27;s decision, saying that al-Kidd could not personally sue Ashcroft, as he was protected by limited immunity as a government official. A majority of the justices held that al-Kidd could not have won his case on the merits, because Ashcroft did not violate his Fourth Amendment rights.

Ashcroft has been a proponent of the War on Drugs. In a 2001 interview on &quot;Larry King Live,&quot; Ashcroft stated his intention to increase efforts in this area. In 2003, two nationwide investigations code-named Operation Pipe Dream and Operation Headhunter, which targeted businesses selling drug paraphernalia, mostly for cannabis use, resulted in a series of indictments.

Tommy Chong, a counterculture icon, was one of those charged, for his part in financing and promoting Chong Glass/Nice Dreams, a company started by his son Paris. Of the 55 individuals charged as a result of the operations, only Chong was given a prison sentence after conviction (nine months in a federal prison, plus forfeiting $103,000 and a year of probation). The other 54 individuals were given fines and home detentions. While the DOJ denied that Chong was treated any differently from the other defendants, critics thought the government was trying to make an example of him. Chong&#x27;s experience as a target of Ashcroft&#x27;s sting operation is the subject of Josh Gilbert&#x27;s feature-length documentary &quot;a/k/a Tommy Chong&quot;, which premiered at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. In a pre-sentencing brief, the Department of Justice specifically cited Chong&#x27;s entertainment career as a consideration against leniency.

When Karl Rove was being questioned in 2005 by the FBI over the leak of a covert CIA agent&#x27;s identity in the press (the Valerie Plame affair), Ashcroft was allegedly briefed about the investigation. The Democratic U.S. Representative John Conyers described this as a &quot;stunning ethical breach that cries out for an immediate investigation.&quot; Conyers, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, asked, in a statement, for a formal investigation of the time between the start of Rove&#x27;s investigation and John Ashcroft&#x27;s recusal.

Since his service in government, Ashcroft has continued to oppose proposals for physician-assisted suicide, which some states have passed by referendums. When interviewed about it in 2012, when a case had reached the US Supreme Court after California voters had approved a law to permit it under regulated conditions, he said,

I certainly believe that people who are in pain should be helped and assisted in every way possible, that the drugs should be used to mitigate their pain but I believe the law of the United States of America which requires that drugs not be used except for legitimate health purposes.

In 2015, Human Rights Watch called for the investigation of Ashcroft &quot;for conspiracy to torture as well as other crimes.&quot;

==Personal life==

Ashcroft is a member of the Assemblies of God church. He is married to Janet E. Ashcroft and has three children with her. His son, Jay, is the Missouri Secretary of State.

Ashcroft has long enjoyed inspirational music and singing. In the 1970s, he recorded a gospel record entitled &quot;Truth: Volume One, Edition One&quot;, with Democratic Missouri legislator Max Bacon.

With fellow U.S. senators Trent Lott, Larry Craig, and Jim Jeffords, Ashcroft formed a barbershop quartet called The Singing Senators. The men performed at social events with other senators. Ashcroft performed the Star Spangled Banner before the National Hockey League all-star game in St. Louis in 1988.

Ashcroft composed a paean titled &quot;Let the Eagle Soar,&quot; which he sang at the Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in February 2002. Ashcroft has written and sung a number of other songs. He has collected these on compilation tapes, including &quot;In the Spirit of Life and Liberty&quot; and &quot;Gospel (Music) According to John&quot;. In 1998, he wrote a book with author Gary Thomas titled &quot;Lessons from a Father to His Son&quot;.

Ashcroft was given an honorary doctorate before delivering the commencement address at Toccoa Falls College in 2018.

Ashcroft does not drink alcohol.

==Books==
* Co-author with Jane E. Ashcroft, &quot;College Law for Business,&quot; textbook (10th edition, 1987)
* &quot;On My Honor: The Beliefs that Shape My Life&quot; (1998)
* &quot;Lessons from a Father to His Son&quot; (2002)
* &quot;Never Again: Securing America and Restoring Justice&quot; (2006)

==Representation in other media==

* His song, &quot;Let the Eagle Soar&quot;, was satirically featured in Michael Moore&#x27;s 2004 movie &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; and has been frequently mocked by comedians such as David Letterman, Stephen Colbert and David Cross.
* The song was performed at Bush&#x27;s 2005 inauguration by Guy Hovis, a former cast member of &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;.
*&quot;Let the Eagle Soar&quot; is heard in the background in the 2015 film &quot;The Big Short&quot;, as an ironic juxtaposition of schmaltzy music and new-age capitalist sensibility when a phone call is placed to pastoral Boulder, Colorado, where anti-authoritarian ex-banking trader Ben Rickert (played by Brad Pitt) lives.
* The song &quot;Caped Crusader&quot; off of Jello Biafra and the Melvins&#x27; 2004 album &quot;Never Breathe What You Can&#x27;t See&quot; lifts several lines from Ashcroft and 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta in a satirical attack on religious fundamentalism.
* Immortal Technique&#x27;s &quot;Freedom of Speech&quot; from his 2003 album Revolutionary Vol. 2 critiques Ashcroft for the invasion of Iraq under the pretense of freedom, suggesting that the real reason was racism

<text>Japheth ( &quot;Yép̄eṯ&quot;, in pausa &quot;Yā́p̄eṯ&quot;; &#x27;; ;&#x27;) is one of the three sons of Noah in the Book of Genesis, in which he plays a role in the story of Noah&#x27;s drunkenness and the curse of Ham, and subsequently in the Table of Nations as the ancestor of the peoples of the Aegean Sea, Anatolia, Caucasus, Greece, and elsewhere in Eurasia. In medieval and early modern European tradition he was considered to be the progenitor of the European peoples.

==Etymology==
The meaning of the name &quot;Japheth&quot; (: &quot;y-p-t&quot;) is disputable. There are two possible sources to the meaning of the name:
* From the Aramaic root (&quot;p-t-h&quot;), meaning &quot;to extend&quot;. In this case, the name would mean &quot;may He extend&quot;, according to the interpretation of Rashi.
* From the Hebrew root (&quot;y-p-h&quot;), meaning &quot;beauty&quot;, in which case the name would mean &quot;beautiful&quot;.

==In the Book of Genesis==

Japheth first appears in the Hebrew Bible as one of the three sons of Noah, saved from the Flood through the Ark. In the Book of Genesis, they are always in the order &quot;Shem, Ham, and Japheth&quot; when all three are listed. Genesis 9:24 calls Ham the youngest, and Genesis 10:21 refers ambiguously to Shem as &quot;brother of Japheth the elder&quot;, which could mean that either is the eldest. Most modern writers accept Shem–Ham–Japheth as reflecting their birth order, but this is not always the case: Moses and Rachel also appear at the head of such lists despite explicit descriptions of them as younger siblings. However, Japheth is considered to have been the eldest son of Noah in Rabbinic literature.

Following the Flood, Japheth is featured in the story of Noah&#x27;s drunkenness. Ham sees Noah drunk and naked in his tent and tells his brothers, who then cover their father with a cloak while avoiding the sight; when Noah awakes he curses Canaan, the son of Ham, and blesses Shem and Japheth: &quot;Blessed be the Lord God of Shem and may Canaan be his slave; and may God enlarge Japheth and may he dwell in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be his slave!&quot; Chapter 10 of Genesis, the Table of Nations, describes how earth was populated by the sons of Noah following the Flood, beginning with the descendants of Japheth:



==Ethnogenetic interpretations==
Japheth (in Hebrew: &quot;Yā́p̄eṯ&quot; or &quot;Yép̄eṯ&quot;) may be a transliteration of the Greek Iapetos, the ancestor of the Hellenic peoples. His sons and grandsons associate him with the geographic area comprising the Aegean Sea, Greece, the Caucasus, and Anatolia: Ionia/Javan, Rhodes/Rodanim, Cyprus/Kittim, and other places in the Eastern Mediterranean region. The point of the &quot;blessing of Japheth&quot; seems to be that Japheth (a Greek-descended people) and Shem (the Israelites) would rule jointly over Canaan (Palestine).

From the 19th century until the late 20th century, it was usual to see Japheth as a reference to the Philistines, who shared dominion over Canaan during the pre-monarchic and early monarchic period of Israel and Judah. This view accorded with the understanding of the origin of the Book of Genesis, which was seen as having been composed in stages beginning with the time of King Solomon, when the Philistines still existed (they vanished from history after the Assyrian conquest of Canaan). However, Genesis 10:14 identifies their ancestor as Ham rather than Japheth.

==Biblical descendants==


In the Hebrew Bible, Japheth is ascribed seven sons: Gomer, Magog, Tiras, Javan, Meshech, Tubal, and Madai. According to the Roman–Jewish historian Flavius Josephus in &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, I.VI.122 (Whiston):

The &quot;Sefer haYashar&quot; (&quot;Book of Jasher&quot;), written by Talmudic rabbis in the 17th century, attributed some new names for Japheth&#x27;s grandchildren which are not found in the Hebrew Bible, and provided a much more detailed genealogy. In the Jewish tradition, Abraham&#x27;s wife Keturah is sometimes considered a descendant of Japheth.

===Europeans===

In the 7th century AD, Hispano–Roman archbishop and scholar Isidore of Seville wrote his noted encyclopedic-historical treatise titled &quot;Etymologiae&quot;, in which he traces the origins of most of the European peoples back to Japheth. Scholars in almost every European nation continued to repeat and develop Isidore of Seville&#x27;s assertion of descent from Noah through Japheth into the 19th century.

William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Henry IV, Part II&quot; contains a wry comment about people who claim to be related to royal families. Prince Hal notes of such people,

The Georgian historian and linguist Ivane Javakhishvili associated Japheth&#x27;s sons with certain ancient tribes, called Tubals (Tabals, in Greek: &quot;Tibarenoi&quot;) and Meshechs (Meshekhs/Mosokhs, in Greek: &quot;Moschoi&quot;), who claimed to represent non-Indo-European and non-Semitic, possibly &quot;Proto-Iberian&quot; tribes that inhabitated Anatolia during the 3rd-1st millennia BC.

In the Polish tradition of Sarmatism, the Sarmatians, an Iranic people, were said to be descended from Japheth, son of Noah, enabling the Polish nobility to believe that their ancestry could be traced directly to Noah. In Scotland, histories tracing the Scottish people to Japheth were published as late as George Chalmers&#x27;s well-received &quot;Caledonia&quot;, published in 3 volumes from 1807 to 1824.

==In the Islamic tradition==

Japheth (in Arabic: &quot;Yāfith&quot;) is not mentioned by name in the Quran but is referred to indirectly in the narrative of Noah (, , , , ). Muslim exegesis of the Quran, however, names all of Noah&#x27;s sons, and these include Japheth. In identifying Japheth&#x27;s descendants, Muslim exegesis mostly agrees with the Biblical tradition.

In the Islamic tradition, he is usually regarded as the ancestor of the Gog and Magog tribes. Islamic tradition also tends to identify the descendants of Japheth as including the Turks, Khazars, Chinese, Mongols, and Slavs. According to Abū&#x27;l-Ghāzī who wrote the 17th-century ethnographic treatise &quot;Shajara-i Tarākima&quot; (&quot;Genealogy of the Turkmen&quot;), the descendants of Ham went to Africa, Shem to Iran, and Japheth went to the banks of the Itil and Yaik rivers, and had eight sons named Turk, Khazar, Saqlab, Rus, Ming, Chin, Kemeri, and Tarikh. As Japheth was dying he established Turk, his firstborn son, as his successor.

According to the 18th-century Hui Muslim writer Liu Zhi, after Noah&#x27;s flood, Japheth inherited China as the eastern portion of the Earth, while Shem inherited Arabia as the middle portion, and Ham inherited Europe as the western portion. Some Muslim traditions narrated that 36 languages of the world could be traced back to Japheth.

==In popular culture==
Japheth is a major character in the second act of Stephen Schwartz&#x27;s musical, &quot;Children of Eden&quot;. In this rendition, Japheth has fallen in love with the family servant, Yonah (created entirely for the show). He wants to bring her onto the ark to allow her to survive the flood, but Noah forbids this as Father (God) is trying to wipe the world free of those descended from Cain. Yonah is descended from Cain, despite her good heart and love from the family. Japheth secretly brings her aboard, and she is eventually discovered by Ham and Shem. Japheth defends her from Noah and is about to kill Shem in his rage. Yonah stops and calms him, and Noah decides to let her stay. The flood passes and the brothers all depart for different regions to populate the world, but Japheth and Yonah decide they want to search for Eden. Noah blesses their journey by passing the staff of Adam to Japheth. Smaller casts of the show usually have the actor who portrays Cain to also portray Japheth.

<text>Jay Scott Greenspan (born September 23, 1959), known professionally as Jason Alexander, is an American actor and comedian. Over the course of his career he has received an Emmy Award and a Tony Award as well as nominations for four Golden Globe Awards. He gained stardom for his role as George Costanza in the NBC sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (1989–1998), for which he won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series and was nominated for seven consecutive Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series and four Golden Globe Awards for Best Supporting Actor in Television.

Alexander made his Broadway debut originating the role of Joe in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot; in 1981. He remained active on Broadway acting in the musicals &quot;The Rink&quot; in 1984 and the Neil Simon play &quot;Broadway Bound&quot; in 1986. He then starred in &quot;Jerome Robbins&#x27; Broadway&quot; in 1989, for which he won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. His subsequent theatre roles include the touring production of &quot;The Producers&quot; from 2003 to 2004 and replacing Larry David in the original 2015 Broadway production of &quot;Fish in the Dark&quot;. He has also directed several plays such as the original 2023 Broadway production of &quot;The Cottage&quot;.

His film roles include &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; (1990), &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; (1990), &quot;Coneheads&quot; (1992), &quot;The Paper&quot; (1994), &quot;Dunston Checks In&quot; (1996), &quot;Shallow Hal&quot; (2001), and &quot;&quot; (2009). He voiced the gargoyle Hugo in the Disney film &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1996) and the titular role in &quot;Duckman&quot; (1994–1997). For his role in &quot;Dream On&quot; (1994) he was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.

==Early life and education==

Greenspan was born in Newark, New Jersey to a Jewish family, the son of Ruth Minnie (née Simon), a nurse and health care administrator, and Alexander B. Greenspan, an accounting manager. Greenspan later borrowed his father&#x27;s first name to create his stage name, Jason Alexander.

Alexander grew up in Maplewood and Livingston, New Jersey, and is a 1977 graduate of Livingston High School. Interested in magic from an early age, he initially hoped to be a magician, but while attending a magic camp was told that his hands were too small for card magic. He became interested in theater, eventually realizing, &quot;Wait a minute—the whole thing&#x27;s an illusion. Nothing up there is real&quot; and that theater itself was &quot;a magic trick&quot;. He then decided to pursue a theater career.

After high school, he studied theater at Boston University. He wanted to pursue classical acting, but a professor redirected him toward comedy after noticing his physique, remarking, &quot;I know your heart and soul are Hamlet, but you will never play Hamlet.&quot; Alexander left Boston University without a degree after his third year to take a full-time acting job in New York City. The university awarded him an honorary degree in 1995.

==Career==
===1980–1999: Broadway debut and &quot;Seinfeld&quot; ===
Alexander began his acting career on the New York stage and is an accomplished singer and dancer. Alexander made his film debut in 1981 in the summer camp slasher film &quot;The Burning&quot;. On Broadway he appeared in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot; in 1981, Kander &amp; Ebb&#x27;s &quot;The Rink&quot; in 1984, Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Broadway Bound&quot; in 1986, &quot;Accomplice&quot; in 1990, and &quot;Jerome Robbins&#x27; Broadway&quot; in 1989, for which he garnered the 1989 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. Frank Rich of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of his performance &quot;Jason Alexander, the evening&#x27;s delightful narrator, accomplishes the seemingly impossible: he banishes the memory of Zero Mostel from the role of Pseudolus in &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot;&quot;.

In addition to his roles as an insensitive, money-hungry lawyer in &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; in 1990, Alexander has appeared in &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot; in 1990, &quot;Coneheads&quot; in 1993, &quot;The Paper&quot; and &quot;North&quot; in 1994, &quot;The Last Supper&quot; in 1995, &quot;Dunston Checks In&quot; in 1996, &quot;Love! Valour! Compassion!&quot; in 1997, &quot;Denial&quot; in 1998, and &quot;Love and Action in Chicago&quot; in 1999. Alexander starred in several commercials during the 1980s. Among them were commercials for Hershey&#x27;s Kiss; Delta Gold potato chips; Miller Lite beer; McDonald&#x27;s McDLT hamburger; Pabst Blue Ribbon beer; Levi&#x27;s 501 jeans; Sony Watchman TV; and Western Union wire transfer. Before &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, Alexander appeared in commercials for John Deere and McDonald&#x27;s and in the short-lived CBS sitcom &quot;Everything&#x27;s Relative&quot; (1987).

Alexander is best known as one of the key cast members of the award-winning television sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, where he played the bumbling George Costanza (Jerry Seinfeld&#x27;s character&#x27;s best friend since childhood). He was nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards and four Golden Globe Awards for the role, but did not win any, mainly due to his co-star Michael Richards winning for his role as Cosmo Kramer. He did, however, win the 1995 Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series.

Concurrently with his &quot;Seinfeld&quot; role, he had a part in the ABC sitcom &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; as Al &quot;Sexual&quot; Harris (who frequently engaged in sexual harassment) as well as other characters from 1991 to 1994. For his role in an episode of &quot;Dream On&quot;, Alexander was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series in 1994. Alexander voiced the lead character in the animated series &quot;Duckman&quot; (1994–1997) and voiced Catbert, the evil director of human resources, in the short-lived animated series &quot;Dilbert&quot; from 1999 to 2000, based on the then-popular comic strip. In January 1995, he did a commercial for Rold Gold pretzels to be broadcast during the Super Bowl. The commercial depicts him with &quot;Frasier&quot; dog Eddie jumping out of an airplane with a parachute over the stadium. After the commercial, the audience is brought back to a supposedly live feed of the playing field hearing startled sports commentators as Alexander and the dog land in the field to wild applause.

Alexander appeared in the 1995 TV version of the Broadway musical &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;, as Conrad Birdie&#x27;s agent, Albert Peterson. He guest-starred in episode 8 of the 1996 variety show &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot;. He voiced the gargoyle Hugo in Disney&#x27;s 1996 animated film &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; and its direct-to-video sequel, &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame II&quot;. Alexander voiced the character Abis Mal in the 1994 film &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot; and the 1994-1995 TV series based on the 1992 film &quot;Aladdin&quot;.

In 1997, he appeared in &quot;Cinderella&quot;, a remake of &quot;Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s Cinderella,&quot; alongside Whitney Houston, Brandy Norwood, and Whoopi Goldberg. His other Disney voice work includes &quot;House of Mouse&quot; in 2001 and the 2012 video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance&quot;. He has dabbled in directing, starting with 1996&#x27;s &quot;For Better or Worse&quot; and 1999&#x27;s &quot;Just Looking&quot;. In 1999, Alexander presided over the &quot;New York Friars Club Roast&quot; event honoring Jerry Stiller, who played his father on &quot;Seinfeld&quot;; it featured appearances by Kevin James and Patton Oswalt, both Stiller&#x27;s costars on &quot;The King of Queens&quot;. Alexander appeared in the 1999 &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Think Tank&quot; as Kurros, a genius alien trying to get Seven of Nine to serve on his ship.

===2000–2009: Solo-lead sitcoms and return to theatre ===
Despite a successful career in film and stage, Alexander did not repeat his &quot;Seinfeld&quot;-level of success in television. The year 2001 marked his appearance as inept womanizer Mauricio in &quot;Shallow Hal&quot; and his first post-&quot;Seinfeld&quot; return to prime-time television: the heavily promoted but short-lived ABC sitcom &quot;Bob Patterson&quot;, which was canceled after five episodes. Alexander partially blames the show&#x27;s failure on the country&#x27;s mood after 9/11. Alexander made cameo appearances as himself in 2001 in the second season of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, and he appeared in the show&#x27;s seventh season with his three principal &quot;Seinfeld&quot; co-stars. He was featured in the &quot;Friends&quot; 2001 episode &quot;The One Where Rosita Dies&quot; as Earl, a suicidal supply manager. Phoebe calls him trying to sell him toner, learns about his problem, and tries to persuade him not to commit suicide. This is referenced in an episode of &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; where Alexander appears as Leonard, a neurotic and critical loner. He describes himself as &quot;free&quot; and says he makes money &quot;selling toner over the phone&quot;. Later in the episode, he is repeatedly harassed by a man named George.

He appeared in &quot;One Night at Mercy&quot;, the first episode of the short-lived 2002 revival of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, playing Death. He played the toymaker A.C. Gilbert in the 2002 film &quot;The Man Who Saved Christmas&quot;. He appeared in Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) commercials in 2002, including one with Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants and another with Trista Rehn of &quot;The Bachelorette&quot;. It was rumored that he quit doing these commercials due to KFC suppliers and slaughterhouses&#x27; alleged cruelty to animals, but he denied that in an interview with &quot;Adweek&quot;, saying, &quot;That&#x27;s PETA bullcrap. I loved working for KFC. I was targeted by PETA to broker something between them. I think KFC really stepped up to the plate; unfortunately PETA did not.&quot; In 2007, Alexander appeared in a commercial for the ASPCA that aired on cable TV stations. In 2018, Alexander portrayed Colonel Sanders in commercials for KFC, reprising his role from the 2002 campaign.

In 2003, he was cast opposite Martin Short in the Los Angeles production of Mel Brooks&#x27;s &quot;The Producers&quot;. He appeared with Kelsey Grammer in the 2004 musical adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, as Jacob Marley. Alexander&#x27;s second chance as a TV series lead, the CBS sitcom &quot;Listen Up&quot; (2004–05), also fell short of a second season. Alexander was the principal executive producer of the series, based very loosely on the life of the popular sports-media personality Tony Kornheiser. He performed on the &quot;Family Guy: Live in Vegas&quot; 2005 album. Alexander continued to appear in live stage shows, including Barbra Streisand&#x27;s memorable birthday party in 2005 for Stephen Sondheim at the Hollywood Bowl, where he performed selections from &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; with Angela Lansbury. He featured in the 2005 &quot;Monk&quot; episode &quot;Mr. Monk and the Other Detective&quot; as Monk&#x27;s rival, Marty Eels.

In a 2006 appearance on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, Alexander demonstrated several self-defense techniques. Also that year, he hosted the PBS &quot;A Capitol Fourth&quot; celebrations in Washington, D.C., singing, dancing, and playing tuned drums. Alexander was featured as a recurring cast member in the second season of &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot;. He hosted the Comedy Central Roast of William Shatner. He was the artistic director of Reprise Theatre Company in Los Angeles from 2007 until it went defunct in 2013, where he previously directed &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot;, and directed its 2007 revival of &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;. In 2007, Alexander was a guest star in the third episode of the improv comedy series &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot;.

He has been a frequent guest and panelist on Bill Maher&#x27;s &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; in 1995, 1997 and 2000 and &quot;Real Time&quot; in 2006, 2009 and 2012; &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; in 1999, 2002 and 2004; the &quot;Late Late Show&quot; in 2003, 2012, 2014 and 2015, with Craig Kilborn, Craig Ferguson, and James Corden; &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; in 1989, 2000, and 2002; &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; in 2015; and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; in 2015. In 2008, Alexander guest-starred in the season four episode &quot;Masterpiece&quot; of the CBS show &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; as Professor Rothschild, a well-educated serial killer obsessed with the Fibonacci sequence who sends the team into a race against time to save his last victims. He returned in the same season to direct the episode &quot;Conflicted&quot;, featuring the actor Jackson Rathbone.

Alexander hosted the LOL Sudbury opening night gala in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada in 2008, which was simulcast throughout Canada at 60 Cineplex theaters, a first for any comedy festival. He has lent his voice to several episodes of the &quot;Twilight Zone Radio Dramas&quot;. In 2008 and again in 2009, Alexander fronted &quot;Jason Alexander&#x27;s Comedy Spectacular&quot;, a routine exclusive to Australia. The show consists of stand-up and improvisation and incorporates Alexander&#x27;s musical talent. He is backed up by several well-known Australian comedians. His first time performing a similar show of this nature was in 2006&#x27;s &quot;Jason Alexander&#x27;s Comedy Christmas&quot;. In February/March 2010, Alexander starred in his show, &quot;The Donny Clay Experience&quot;, at the Planet Hollywood Resort in Las Vegas, Nevada. Donny Clay, whom he has portrayed in a tour of the United States and Orillia, Ontario, is a self-help guru in a similar mold to his &quot;Bob Patterson&quot; character. In 2009, he played Joseph in the Thomas Nelson audio Bible production &quot;The Word of Promise&quot;. The project featured a large ensemble of actors, including Jim Caviezel, Lou Gossett Jr., John Rhys-Davies, Jon Voight, Gary Sinise, Christopher McDonald, Marisa Tomei, and John Schneider. In 2009, Alexander had a small role in the film &quot;&quot; as a train station manager.

===2010–present===

He starred as Cosmo in the 2011 live action film &quot;A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!&quot;.

In 2015, he replaced Larry David as the lead in David&#x27;s Broadway play &quot;Fish in the Dark.&quot; He co-starred opposite Sherie Rene Scott in the 2017 world premiere of John Patrick Shanley&#x27;s &quot;The Portuguese Kid&quot; at the Manhattan Theatre Club. In 2018, Alexander played Olix the bartender in &quot;The Orville&quot;. The same year, he portrayed Gene Lundy, a drama teacher, on two episodes of &quot;Young Sheldon&quot;. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, he reprised the role of Gene Lundy on one episode.

In 2019, Alexander appeared on &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot; as Asher Friedman, a blacklisted Broadway playwright who is an old friend of Midge Maisel&#x27;s father Abe Weissman. He won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Song for &quot;The Bad Guys?&quot; on &quot;Brainwashed By Toons&quot; (2020). In 2020, Alexander hosted the &quot;Saturday Night Seder&quot;, an online Passover Seder that featured many celebrities and benefited the CDC Foundation.

From February 2023 he co-presented &quot;Really? No, Really?&quot;, a weekly podcast in which he, co-host Peter Tilden, and their guests attempt to find answers &quot;to life’s most baffling, intriguing, confusing and annoying questions&quot;. In July 2023, he made his Broadway directing debut with Sandy Rustin&#x27;s comedy &quot;The Cottage&quot;. The cast includes Eric McCormack, Laura Bell Bundy and Lilli Cooper. In 2023, on the December 21 primetime CBS special &quot;Dick Van Dyke: 98 Years of Magic&quot;, Alexander performed two songs in conjunction with dance-performers and closed the show with a spoken tribute to Van Dyke.

===Political views===
Alexander has been a prominent public supporter of the OneVoice initiative, which seeks out opinions from moderate Israelis and Palestinians who want to achieve a mutual peace agreement, through what it states is the silent majority of Israelis and Palestinians. On &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;, he said he had visited Israel many times and spoke about progress toward peace he had observed.

On December 6, 2012 Alexander emceed his third gala event for non-profit group Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, a charity supporting the Israel Defense Forces. Musician Stevie Wonder canceled his performance at the event following a recommendation from the UN, and a public petition from Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) requesting that he not attend the event. Alexander, who was interviewed at the event by Jewish News Syndicate, stated he supported the OneVoice Movement, and acknowledged an occupation of Palestine and called for a two-state solution, which was later criticized by Roz Rothstein, CEO of the pro-Israel education group StandWithUs. When asked about the IDF, Alexander stated that they were humane and noble, stating &quot;some of the finest, most humane, most admirable, most noble-serving soldiers that I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot; and that &quot;there can never be any doubt that I am also an advocate for Israel&quot;. When asked about why he had repeatedly emceed the event, Alexander stated, &quot;They don’t understand first of all what [FIDF] is, and they see it as just a blanket support for Israeli military, and they don’t understand how I can say that I’m an advocate for both sides. And given the fact that there are eyes on this event tonight, I thought it was important to get up and say, &#x27;This is why I can advocate for this group and I can advocate for Israel, and I’m not blind to the fact that we’re in conflict, and I hold everyone equally accountable, and I hold everyone equally to my heart.&#x27;&quot; On November 6, 2015 he again emceed an event at The Beverly Hilton Hotel in California, which raised $31 million for &quot;provid[ing] educational, cultural and recreational programs and facilities for IDF soldiers.&quot;

<text>John Wycliffe (; also spelled Wyclif, Wickliffe, and other variants; 1328 – 31 December 1384) was an English scholastic philosopher, Christian reformer, Catholic priest, and a theology professor at the University of Oxford. Wycliffe is traditionally believed to have advocated or made a vernacular translation of the Vulgate Bible into Middle English, though more recent scholarship has minimalized the extent of his advocacy or involvement for lack of direct contemporary evidence.

He became an influential dissident within the Catholic priesthood during the 14th century and is often considered an important predecessor to Protestantism. His theory of &quot;dominion&quot; meant that men in mortal sin were not entitled to exercise authority in the church or state, nor to own property. Wycliffe insisted on the radical poverty of all clergy.

Wycliffe has been characterised as the &quot;evening star&quot; of scholasticism and as the morning star or of the English Reformation.

Certain of Wycliffe&#x27;s later followers, derogatorily called Lollards by their orthodox contemporaries in the 15th and 16th centuries, adopted a number of the beliefs attributed to Wycliffe such as theological virtues, predestination, iconoclasm, and the notion of caesaropapism, with some questioning the veneration of saints, the sacraments, requiem masses, transubstantiation, monasticism, and the legitimacy or role of the Papacy. Wycliffe&#x27;s writings in Latin greatly influenced the philosophy and teaching of the Czech reformer Jan Hus ( 1369–1415).

== Life and career ==

=== Early life ===

Wycliffe was born in the village of Hipswell, near Richmond in the North Riding of Yorkshire, England, around the 1320s. He has conventionally been given a birth date of 1324 but Hudson and Kenny state only records &quot;suggest he was born in the mid-1320s&quot;. Conti states that he was born &quot;before 1331&quot;.

Wycliffe received his early education close to his home. It is unknown when he first came to Oxford, with which he was so closely connected until the end of his life, but he is known to have been at Oxford around 1345. Thomas Bradwardine was the Archbishop of Canterbury and his book &quot;On the Cause of God against the Pelagians&quot;, a bold recovery of the Pauline–Augustinian doctrine of grace, greatly shaped young Wycliffe&#x27;s views, as did the Black Death, which reached England in the summer of 1348. From his frequent references to it in later life it appears to have made a deep and abiding impression upon him. According to Robert Vaughn, the effect was to give Wycliffe &quot;very gloomy views in regard to the condition and prospects of the human race&quot;. In September 1351, Wycliffe became a priest. Wycliffe would have been at Oxford during the St Scholastica Day riot, in which sixty-three students and a number of townspeople were killed. Around the year 1354, Wycliffe encountered two Waldensian men who had travelled from Piedmont to England to spread what they believed to be the true Gospel in Britain. Through them, he gained valuable insight into the Waldensian faith and the teachings of Peter Waldo, which would later influence many of his theological views. 

=== Career in education ===

In 1356, Wycliffe completed his bachelor of arts degree at Merton College as a junior fellow. That same year he produced a small treatise, &quot;The Last Age of the Church&quot;. In the light of the virulence of the plague, which had subsided seven years previously, Wycliffe&#x27;s studies led him to the opinion that the close of the 14th century would mark the end of the world. While other writers viewed the plague as God&#x27;s judgment on sinful people, Wycliffe saw it as an indictment of an unworthy clergy. The mortality rate among the clergy had been particularly high and those who replaced them were, in his opinion, uneducated or generally disreputable.

In 1361, he was Master of Balliol College . That year he was presented by the college to the parish of Fillingham in Lincolnshire, which he visited rarely during long vacations from Oxford. For this he had to give up the headship of Balliol College, though he could continue to live at Oxford. He is said to have had rooms in the buildings of The Queen&#x27;s College. In 1362, he was granted a prebend at Aust in Westbury-on-Trym, which he held in addition to the post at Fillingham.

In 1365, his performance led Simon Islip, Archbishop of Canterbury, to place him at the head of Canterbury Hall, where twelve young men were preparing for the priesthood. In December 1365, Islip appointed Wycliffe as warden, but when Islip died in 1366, his successor, Simon Langham, a man of monastic training, turned the leadership of the college over to a monk. In 1367, Wycliffe appealed to Rome. In 1371, Wycliffe&#x27;s appeal was decided and the outcome was unfavourable to him. The incident was typical of the ongoing rivalry between monks or friars and secular clergy at Oxford at this time.

In 1368, he gave up his living at Fillingham and took over the rectory of Ludgershall, Buckinghamshire, not far from Oxford, which enabled him to retain his connection with the university. Tradition has it that he began his translation of the Bible into English while sitting in a room above what is now the porch in Ludgershall Church. In 1369, Wycliffe obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in theology, and his doctorate in 1372. In 1374, he received the crown living of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Lutterworth in Leicestershire, which he retained until his death.

=== Politics ===
In 1374, Wycliffe&#x27;s name appears on a commission, after a bishop, which the English Government sent to Bruges to discuss with the representatives of Gregory XI a number of points in dispute between the king and the pope. He was no longer satisfied with his chair as the means of propagating his ideas, and soon after his return from Bruges he began to express them in tracts and longer works. In a book concerned with the government of God and the Ten Commandments, he attacked the temporal rule of the clergy, the collection of annates, indulgences, and simony.

According to Benedictine historian Francis Aidan Gasquet, at least some of Wycliffe&#x27;s program should be seen as (naive) &quot;attempts at social reconstruction&quot; in the aftermath the continuing institutional chaos after the Black Death (1347-1349) 

====&quot;De civili dominio&quot;====
Wycliffe entered the politics of the day with his great work &quot;De civili dominio&quot; (&quot;On Civil Dominion&quot;), which drew arguments from the works of Richard FitzRalph&#x27;s. This called for the royal divestment of all church property.

=====Conflicts with Church, State and University=====

In 1377, Wycliffe&#x27;s ideas on lordship and church wealth caused his first official condemnation by Pope Gregory XI, who censured 19 articles. Wycliffe argued that the Church had fallen into sin and that it ought therefore to give up all its property, and that the clergy must live in poverty. The tendency of the high offices of state to be held by clerics was resented by many of the nobles, such as the backroom power broker John of Gaunt, who would have had his own reasons for opposing the wealth and power of the clergy, since it challenged the foundation of his power.

Wycliffe was summoned before William Courtenay, Bishop of London, on 19 February 1377. The exact charges are not known, as the matter did not get as far as a definite examination. Lechler suggests that Wycliffe was targeted by John of Gaunt&#x27;s opponents among the nobles and church hierarchy. Gaunt, the Earl Marshal Henry Percy, and a number of other supporters accompanied Wycliffe. A crowd gathered at the church, and at the entrance, party animosities began to show, especially in an angry exchange between the bishop and Wycliffe&#x27;s protectors over whether Wycliffe should sit.

Gaunt declared that he would humble the pride of the English clergy and their partisans, hinting at the intent to secularise the possessions of the Church. The assembly broke up and Gaunt and his partisans departed with their protégé. Most of the English clergy were irritated by this encounter, and attacks upon Wycliffe began.

Wycliffe&#x27;s second and third books dealing with civil government carry a sharp polemic.

On 22 May 1377, Pope Gregory XI sent five copies of a bull against Wycliffe, dispatching one to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the others to the Bishop of London, King Edward III, the Chancellor, and the university. Among the enclosures were 18 theses of his, which were denounced as erroneous and dangerous to Church and State: all were drawn from &quot;De Civili dominio&quot;.

Stephen Lahey suggests that Gregory&#x27;s action against Wycliffe was an attempt to put pressure on King Edward to make peace with France. Edward III died on 21 June 1377, and the bull against Wycliffe did not reach England before December. Wycliffe was asked to give the king&#x27;s council his opinion on whether it was lawful to withhold traditional payments to Rome, and he responded that it was.

Back at Oxford, the Vice-Chancellor confined Wycliffe for some time in Black Hall, but his friends soon obtained his release.

In March 1378, Wycliffe was summoned to appear at Lambeth Palace to defend himself. However, Sir Lewis Clifford entered the chapel and in the name of the queen mother (Joan of Kent), forbade the bishops to proceed to a definite sentence concerning Wycliffe&#x27;s conduct or opinions. Wycliffe wrote a letter expressing and defending his less &quot;obnoxious doctrines&quot;. The bishops, who were divided, satisfied themselves with forbidding him to speak further on the controversy.

==== &quot;De incarcerandis fedelibus&quot; ====

Wycliffe then wrote his &quot;De incarcerandis fedelibus&quot;, with 33 conclusions in Latin and English. In this writing he laid open the entire case, in such a way that it was understood by the laity. In it he demanded that it should be legal for the excommunicated to appeal to the king and his council against the excommunication: the state should be able to override the church. Some ordinary citizens, some of the nobility, and his former protector, John of Gaunt, rallied to him. Before any further steps could be taken in Rome, Gregory XI died in 1378.

====&quot;De officio regis&quot;====
The attacks on Pope Gregory XI grew ever more extreme. Wycliffe&#x27;s stand concerning the ideal of poverty became continually firmer, as well as his position with regard to the temporal rule of the clergy. Closely related to this attitude was his book &quot;De officio regis&quot;, the content of which was foreshadowed in his 33 conclusions. This book, like those that preceded and followed, was concerned with the reform of the Church, in which the temporal arm was to have an influential part.

From 1380 onwards, Wycliffe devoted himself to writings that argued his rejection of transubstantiation, and strongly criticised the friars who supported it.

=== Anti-Wycliffe synod ===

In the summer of 1381, Wycliffe formulated his doctrine of the Lord&#x27;s Supper in twelve short sentences, and made it a duty to advocate it everywhere. Then the English hierarchy launched proceedings against him. The chancellor of the University of Oxford had some of the declarations pronounced heretical. When this was announced to Wycliffe, he declared that no one could change his convictions. He then appealed – not to the pope or the ecclesiastical authorities of the land, but to the king. He published his great confession upon the subject, and a second writing in English intended for the common people.

As long as Wycliffe limited his attacks to abuses and the wealth of the Church, he could rely on the support of part of the clergy and aristocracy, but once he dismissed the traditional doctrine of transubstantiation, his theses could not be defended any more. This view cost him the support of John of Gaunt and many others.

In the midst of this came the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381. The revolt was sparked in part by Wycliffe&#x27;s preaching, carried throughout the realm by &quot;poor priests&quot; or &quot;poor preachers&quot; appointed by Wycliffe, and mostly laymen. A contemporary record claims local sympathetic knights would force local people to hear the preaching, sometimes acting as armed guards in the parish church to prevent disputation. The preachers didn&#x27;t limit their criticism of the accumulation of wealth and property to that of the monasteries, but included secular properties belonging to the nobility. Although Wycliffe disapproved of the revolt, some of his disciples justified the killing of Simon Sudbury, Archbishop of Canterbury.

In 1382, Wycliffe&#x27;s old enemy William Courtenay, now Archbishop of Canterbury, called an ecclesiastical assembly of notables at London. During the consultations on 21 May an earthquake occurred. The participants were terrified and wished to break up the assembly, but Courtenay declared the earthquake a favourable sign, which meant the purification of the earth from erroneous doctrine, and the result of the &quot;Earthquake Synod&quot; was assured.

Of the 24 propositions attributed to Wycliffe without mentioning his name, ten were declared heretical and fourteen erroneous. The former had reference to the transformation in the sacrament, the latter to matters of church order and institutions. It was forbidden from that time to hold these opinions or to advance them in sermons or in academic discussions. All persons disregarding this order were to be subject to prosecution. To accomplish this, the help of the State was necessary, but the Commons rejected the bill. The king, however, had a decree issued which permitted the arrest of those in error.

The citadel of the reformatory movement was Oxford, where Wycliffe&#x27;s most active helpers were. The ban applied to them and they were summoned to recant. Nicholas of Hereford went to Rome to appeal.

On 17 November 1382, Wycliffe was summoned before a synod at Oxford. He still commanded the favour of the court and of Parliament, to which he addressed a memorial. In 1383 he was summonsed to Rome, but he suffered a debilitating stroke and was excused from travel. He was neither excommunicated then, nor deprived of his living.

Wycliffe aimed to do away with the existing hierarchy and replace it with the &quot;poor priests&quot; who lived in poverty, were bound by no vows, had received no formal consecration, and preached the Gospel to the people. Itinerant preachers spread the teachings of Wycliffe. The bull of Gregory XI impressed upon them the name of Lollards, intended as an opprobrious epithet, but it became, to them, a name of honour. Even in Wycliffe&#x27;s time the &quot;Lollards&quot; had reached wide circles in England and preached &quot;God&#x27;s law, without which no one could be justified.&quot; Furthermore, not all anti-clerical people were Lollards, not all Lollards were Wycliffites, and not all productions attributed to Wycliffites were anti-Catholic, despite later conflation.

=== Death and posthumous declaration of heresy ===
In the years before his death in 1384 he increasingly argued for Scriptures as the authoritative centre of Christianity, that the claims of the papacy were unhistorical, that monasticism was irredeemably corrupt, and that the moral unworthiness of priests invalidated their office and sacraments.

Wycliffe returned to Lutterworth. From there he sent out tracts against the monks and Pope Urban VI. Urban VI, contrary to Wycliffe&#x27;s hopes, had not turned out to be a reforming pope. The literary achievements of Wycliffe&#x27;s last days, such as the &quot;Trialogus&quot;, stand at the peak of the knowledge of his day. His last work, the &quot;Opus evangelicum&quot;, the last part of which he named in characteristic fashion &quot;Of Antichrist&quot;, remained uncompleted. While he was saying Mass in the parish church on Holy Innocents&#x27; Day, 28 December 1384, he suffered a stroke, and died a few days later.

The anti-Lollard statute of 1401 De heretico comburendo classed heresy as a form of sedition or treason, and ordered that Lollard books, frequently associated with Wycliffe, be handed over and burnt; someone who refused and would not abjure could be burnt. The &quot;Constitutions of Oxford&quot; of 1408 established rules in Oxford University, and specifically named John Wycliffe as a Lollard and his writings as heretical; it decreed that new translation efforts of Scripture into English should be first authorized by a Bishop.

The Council of Constance declared Wycliffe a heretic on 4 May 1415, and banned his writings. The Council decreed that Wycliffe&#x27;s works should be burned and his bodily remains removed from consecrated church ground, following the customary logic that heretics had put themselves outside the church. This order, confirmed by Pope Martin V, was eventually carried out in 1428. Wycliffe&#x27;s corpse, or a neighbour&#x27;s, was exhumed; unusually, on the orders of the bishop the remains were burned and the ashes drowned in the River Swift, which flows through Lutterworth.

None of Wycliffe&#x27;s contemporaries left a complete picture of his person, his life, and his activities. Paintings representing Wycliffe are from a later period. In &quot;The Testimony of William Thorpe&quot; (1407) (possibly apocryphal), Wycliffe appears wasted and physically weak. Thorpe says Wycliffe was of unblemished walk in life, and regarded affectionately by people of rank, who often consorted with him, took down his sayings, and clung to him. &quot;I indeed clove to none closer than to him, the wisest and most blessed of all men whom I have ever found.&quot;

== Works ==
Wycliffe is said to have written about two hundred works in Latin and Middle English. There are few experts in 14th-century scholastic Latin, and many of Wycliffe&#x27;s Latin works have not been translated into English, which has limited their study by historians. His theological and political works include numerous books and tracts:

* &quot;The Last Age of the Church&quot; (1356) &quot;attrib.&quot;
* &quot;De Logica&quot; (&quot;On Logic&quot;) 1360
* &quot;De Universalibus&quot; (&quot;On Universals&quot;) 1368
* &quot;De Dominio Divino&quot; (1373)
* &quot;De Mandatis Divinis&quot; (1375)
* &quot;De Statu Innocencie&quot; (1376)
* &quot;De Civili Dominio&quot; (1377)
* &quot;De Officio Regis&quot;
* &quot;Responsio&quot; (1377)
* &quot;De veritate sacrae scripturae&quot; (&quot;On the Truthfulness of Holy Scripture&quot;) 1378
* &quot;On the Pastoral Office&quot; 1378
* &quot;De apostasia&quot; (&quot;On Apostasy&quot;) 1379
* &quot;De Eucharistia&quot; (&quot;On the Eucharist&quot;) 1379
* &quot;Objections to Friars&quot; (1380)
* &quot;Trialogus&quot; - four books (c 1381-83)

Most historians hold that few to none of the Middle English works (tracts) ascribed to Wycliffe can be confidently attributed to him, in contrast to the Latin works, with the possible exception of six: &quot;On the Pastoral Office&quot;, &quot;On the Pope&quot;, &quot;On the Church and Her Members&quot;, &quot;Of Confession&quot;, &quot;Of Pseudo-Friars&quot;, and &quot;Of Dominion&quot;.

A large number of sermons ascribed to him, about 250 in Middle English and 170 in Latin, survive.

=== Middle English Bibles ===
According to tradition Wycliffe is said to have completed a translation direct from the Vulgate into Middle English – a version now known as Wycliffe&#x27;s Bible. He may have personally translated the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John but it is possible he initially translated the entire New Testament Early Version. It is assumed that his associates translated the Old Testament and revised the Late Version. Wycliffe&#x27;s Bible appears to have been completed prior to 1384, with additional updated versions being done by Wycliffe&#x27;s assistant John Purvey, and others, in 1388 and 1395. More recently historians of the Wycliffite movement have suggested that Wycliffe had at most a minor role in the actual translations or contributed &quot;ad hoc&quot; passages taken from his English theological writings, with some, building on the earlier theories of Francis Aidan Gasquet, going as far as to suggest he had no role in the translations other than the translation projects perhaps being inspired, at least partially, by Wycliffe&#x27;s biblicism at Oxford, but otherwise being orthodox Catholic translations later co-opted by his followers.

In keeping with Wycliffe&#x27;s belief that scripture was the only authoritative reliable guide to the truth about God, he is said to have become involved in efforts to translate the Bible into English. However, while Wycliffe is popularly credited, it is not possible exactly to define his part, if any, in the translations, which were based on the Vulgate.

In common belief from only decades after the translations, it was his initiative, and the success of the project was due to his leadership. For the initial Early Version (EV), the rendering of the Old Testament is attributed to his friend Nicholas of Hereford; the rendering of some of the New Testament has been traditionally attributed to Wycliffe. The whole was revised perhaps by Wycliffe&#x27;s younger contemporary John Purvey in 1388, known as the Late Version (LV). Linguistic analysis, however, suggests there were multiple translators for both EV and LV translations.

There still exist over 200 manuscripts, complete or partial, mainly containing the translation in its LV form. From this, it is possible to infer that texts were widely diffused in the 15th century. For this reason, the Wycliffites in England were often designated by their opponents as &quot;Bible men&quot;; it has been noted, however, that the vocabulary in English Wycliffite sermons doesn&#x27;t typically match that found in the EV or LV.

Harrison Thomson notes that Wycliff&#x27;s theology was on a broader canvas than the continental reformation: however of the major Protestant notes, he certainly advocated &quot;the supremacy of scripture over tradition&quot;, however it is difficult to find justification by faith alone or the priesthood of all believers espoused in his works. No reformer adopted his view that every verse in Scripture was in some way literally true.

Wycliffe had come to regard the scriptures as the only reliable guide to the truth about God, and maintained that all Christians should rely on the Bible rather than on the teachings of popes and clerics. He said that there was no scriptural justification for the papacy.

Theologically, his preaching expressed a strong belief in predestination that enabled him to declare an &quot;invisible church of the elect&quot;, made up of those predestined to be saved, rather than in the &quot;visible&quot; Catholic Church.
To Wycliffe, the Church was the totality of those who are predestined to blessedness. No one who is eternally lost has part in it. There is one universal Church, and outside of it there is no salvation.

His first tracts and greater works of ecclesiastical-political content defended the privileges of the State. By 1379 in his &quot;De ecclesia&quot; (&quot;On the Church&quot;), Wycliffe clearly claimed the supremacy of the king over the priesthood. He also rejected the selling of indulgences.

=== Attack on monasticism ===
The battle against what he saw as an imperialised papacy and its supporters, the &quot;sects&quot;, as he called the monastic orders, takes up a large space not only in his later works, such as the &quot;Trialogus&quot;, &quot;Dialogus&quot;, &quot;Opus evangelicum&quot;, and in his sermons, but also in a series of sharp tracts and polemical productions in Latin and English (of which those issued in his later years have been collected as &quot;Polemical Writings&quot;).

In the 1380 &quot;Objections to Friars&quot;, he calls monks the pests of society, enemies of religion, and patrons and promoters of every crime. He directed his strongest criticism against the friars, whose preaching he considered neither scriptural nor sincere, but motivated by &quot;temporal gain&quot;. While others were content to seek the reform of particular errors and abuses, Wycliffe sought nothing less than the extinction of the institution itself, as being repugnant to scripture and his theology of apostolic poverty, and inconsistent with the order and prosperity of the Church. He advocated the dissolution of the monasteries.

=== Views on the papacy ===
Rudolph Buddensieg finds two distinct aspects in Wycliffe&#x27;s work. The first, from 1366 to 1378, reflects a political struggle with Rome, while 1378 to 1384 is more a religious struggle. In each Wycliffe has two approaches: he attacks both the Papacy and its institutions, and also Roman Catholic doctrine.

Wycliffe&#x27;s influence was never greater than at the moment when pope and antipope sent their ambassadors to England to gain recognition for themselves. In 1378, in the ambassadors&#x27; presence, he delivered an opinion before Parliament that showed, in an important ecclesiastical political question (the matter of the right of asylum in Westminster Abbey), a position that was to the liking of the State. He argued that criminals who had taken sanctuary in churches might lawfully be dragged out of sanctuary.

The books and tracts of Wycliffe&#x27;s last six years include continual attacks upon the papacy and the entire hierarchy of his times. Each year they focus more and more, and at the last, the pope and the Antichrist seem to him practically equivalent concepts. Yet there are passages which are moderate in tone: G. V. Lechler identifies three stages in Wycliffe&#x27;s relations with the papacy. The first step, which carried him to the outbreak of the schism, involves moderate recognition of the papal primacy; the second, which carried him to 1381, is marked by an estrangement from the papacy; and the third shows him in sharp contest.

=== Basic positions in philosophy ===
Wycliffe was a prominent English theologian and scholastic philosopher of the second half of the 14th century. He earned his great repute as a philosopher at an early date. Henry Knighton says that in philosophy he was second to none, and in scholastic discipline incomparable. There was a period in his life when he devoted himself exclusively to scholastic philosophy. His first book, &quot;&quot; (1360), explores the fundamentals of Scholastic Theology. He believed that &quot;one should study Logic in order to better understand the human mind because ...human thoughts, feelings and actions bear God&#x27;s image and likeness&quot;. He espoused &quot;propositional realism&quot;: that a true proposition maps onto a truth about being (i.e., about something real.)

The centre of Wycliffe&#x27;s philosophical system is formed by the doctrine of the prior existence in the thought of God of all things and events. While Platonic realism would view &quot;beauty&#x27; as a property that exists in an ideal form independently of any mind or thing, &quot;for Wycliffe every universal, as part of creation, derived its existence from God, the Creator&quot;. Wycliffe was a close follower of Augustine, and always upheld the primacy of the Creator over the created reality.

In some of his teachings, as in &quot;&quot;, the influence of Thomas Aquinas can be detected.
He said that Democritus, Plato, Augustine, and Grosseteste far outranked Aristotle. So far as his relations to the philosophers of the Middle Ages are concerned, he held to realism as opposed to the nominalism advanced by William of Ockham.

A number of Wycliffe&#x27;s ideas have been carried forward in the twentieth century by philosopher and Reformed theologian Cornelius Van Til.

====&quot;Dominium&quot;====

A second key point of Wycliffe&#x27;s is his emphasis on the notion of divine Lordship (&quot;&quot;).

&quot;&quot; (c. 1373) examines the relationship between God and his creatures. The practical application of this for Wycliffe was seen in the rebellious attitude of individuals (particulars) towards rightful authority (universals).

&quot;Beyond all doubt, intellectual and emotional error about universals is the cause of all sin that reigns in the world.&quot;

In &#x27; (&quot;On Civil Dominion&quot;, c. 1377) he discusses the appropriate circumstance under which an entity may be seen as possessing authority over lesser subjects. &#x27; is always conferred by God: injuries inflicted on someone personally by a king should be born by them submissively, a conventional idea, but injuries by a king against God should be patiently resisted even to death. Gravely sinful kings and popes forfeited their divine right to obedience. Versions of this were taken up by Lollards and Hussites.

=== Attitude toward speculation ===
Wycliffe&#x27;s fundamental principle of the preexistence in thought of all reality involves the most serious obstacle to freedom of the will; the philosopher could assist himself only by the formula that the free will of man was something predetermined of God. He demanded strict dialectical training as the means of distinguishing the true from the false, and asserted that logic (or the syllogism) furthered the knowledge of catholic verities; ignorance of logic was the reason why men misunderstood Scripture, since men overlooked the connection, the distinction between idea and appearance.

Wycliffe was not merely conscious of the distinction between theology and philosophy, but his sense of reality led him to pass by scholastic questions. He left aside philosophical discussions that seemed to have no significance for the religious consciousness and those that pertained purely to scholasticism: &quot;We concern ourselves with the verities that are, and leave aside the errors which arise from speculation on matters which are not.&quot;

=== Sacraments ===
John Wycliffe rejected transubstantiation along with the sacrament of confession, saying they were against scripture. Wycliffe was attacked as being a Donatist, however the claim was a misconception, perhaps used to discredit his views on the Eucharist.

The consecrated Host we priests make and bless is not the body of the Lord but an effectual sign of it. It is not to be understood that the body of Christ comes down from heaven to the Host consecrated in every church.
:— John Wycliffe

=== Soteriology ===
Wycliffe was influenced by the Augustinian soteriology, which centered on a divine monergism, and implied a double predestination. He argued that all events occur by absolute necessity, and that God is the author of even man&#x27;s evil deeds. This position led Wycliffe to become a strong proponent of double predestination. Wycliffe appears to have had similar ideas of justification as the later reformers would. According to Wycliffe faith was sufficient for salvation:

Trust wholly in Christ; rely altogether on his sufferings; beware of seeking to be justified in any other way than by his righteousness. Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ is sufficient for salvation.
:— John Wycliffe

=== Scripture ===
Wycliffe expressed his theories in the book &quot; (On the Truthfulness of Holy Scripture, c.1378).

Wycliffe&#x27;s dictum says that all truths necessary to faith are
found expressly in the Bible, and the more necessary, the more expressly. This proposition was later taken up by Martin Luther.

The whole of scripture is one word of God (&quot;): being a monologue by the same author meant that sentences from different books could be combined without much regard for context, supporting strained and mystical interpretations.

The scriptures were literally true (&quot;&quot;) unless obviously figurative, to the extent that when Jesus spoke in parables, he was reporting events that had actually occurred. Psalm 22 v6 (&quot;I am a worm and no man&quot;), which Pseudo-Dionysius had memorably used to give &#x27;worm&#x27; as a name of God, became in Wycliffe&#x27;s extreme literalism a statement that Jesus had been begotten without sexual contact (as was then believed of worms) and was formally God not a simply man.

The literal sense of scripture is that sense which the Holy Ghost first imparted so that the faithful soul might ascend to God () Wycliffe wrote of progressive stages of scriptural interpretation: the plain or literal reading of text and its interpretation being the most basic, leading to a mystical understanding of the sense of the author, leading finally to seeing the Book of Life which contains every truth. However, historians have suggested that this mystical view allowed Wycliffe to work backwards, back-fitting his reading of scripture to suit his theological views. Indeed, Wycliffe maintains that the Christian faith would persist even if all biblical codices were “burnt up or otherwise destroyed”.

==== Vernacular Scripture====
Wycliffe is popularly connected with the view that scriptures should be translated into the vernacular and made available to laymen, and that this was a critical issue in the censures against him.

However, scholars have noted the availability of scriptures to laypeople in the vernacular was not a notable theme of Wycliffe&#x27;s theological works. (It is mentioned in his &quot;De XXXIII erroribus curitatum&quot;, Chapter 26 against those who would stop secular men from &quot;intermeddling with the Gospel&quot;.) Nor were there any church-wide bans on vernacular scriptures in place that Wycliffe might be regarded as protesting against. It was not part of Wycliffe&#x27;s 1377 papal censure, nor the declaration of heresy by the Council of Constance (1415). Vernacular scriptures were not mentioned in the two key early Lollard documents, regarded as channelling his doctrine: the Twelve Conclusions (c. 1396) and the Thirty Seven Conclusions (c. 1396) (or Remonstrances).

== Legacy ==
Wycliffe was instrumental in the development of a translation of the Bible in English, thus making it accessible to English speakers with poor Latin, though whether he himself translated the Bible, in part or whole, or merely played a part in motivating its translation indirectly through his revival of Oxford biblical studies, is a matter of debate.

His theology also had a strong influence on Jan Hus. Hus&#x27; &quot;De Ecclesia&quot; summarised Wycliffe&#x27;s work of the same name, with additional material from Wycliffe&#x27;s &quot;De potentate papae&quot;. See also Writings of Hus and Wycliffe.

Several institutions are named after him:

* Wycliffe Global Alliance, an alliance of organisations with the common objective of translating the Bible for every language group that needs it.
* Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, one of the Church of England&#x27;s designated Evangelical theological colleges.
* Wycliffe College, Toronto, a graduate theological school federated with the University of Toronto.
* Wycliffe College, Gloucestershire, an English independent, private day and boarding school.

Wycliffe is honoured with a commemoration in the Church of England on 31 December, and in the Anglican Church of Canada.

Wycliffe and its variants are popular given names, presumably starting in some Protestant communities – for example, Haitian rapper and musician Wyclef Jean.

In the centre of Lutterworth, a Grade II-listed memorial obelisk to Wycliffe was erected in June 1897 on a site behind which the Wycliffe Memorial Methodist Church was built a few years later for the town&#x27;s Wesleyan Methodist congregation.

<doc id="16486" wikidata="Q368866" url="?curid=16486" title="Joe Orton">
<text>John Kingsley Orton (1 January 1933 – 9 August 1967), known by the pen name of Joe Orton, was an English playwright, author, and diarist. 

His public career, from 1964 until his murder in 1967 committed by his partner, was short but highly influential. During this brief period he shocked, outraged, and amused audiences with his scandalous black comedies. The adjective &quot;Ortonesque&quot; refers to work characterised by a similarly dark yet farcical cynicism.

==Early life==

Joe Orton was born on 1 January 1933 at Causeway Lane Maternity Hospital, Leicester, to William Arthur Orton and Elsie Mary Orton (née Bentley). William worked for Leicester County Borough Council as a gardener and Elsie worked in the local footwear industry until tuberculosis cost her a lung. At the time of Joe&#x27;s birth, William and Mary were living with William&#x27;s family at 261 Avenue Road Extension in Clarendon Park, Leicester. Joe&#x27;s younger brother, Douglas, was born in 1935. That year, the Ortons moved to 9 Fayrhurst Road on the Saffron Lane Estate, a council estate. Orton&#x27;s younger sisters, Marilyn and Leonie, were born in 1939 and 1944, respectively.

Orton attended Marriot Road Primary School but failed the eleven-plus exam after extended bouts of asthma, and so took a secretarial course at Clark&#x27;s College in Leicester from 1945 to 1947. He began working as a junior clerk for £3 a week.

Orton became interested in performing in theatre around 1949 and joined a number of dramatic societies, including the Leicester Dramatic Society. While working on amateur productions he was determined to improve his appearance and physique, buying bodybuilding courses, taking elocution lessons. He was accepted for a scholarship at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in November 1950, and he left the East Midlands for London. His entrance into RADA was delayed until May 1951 by appendicitis.

Orton met Kenneth Halliwell at RADA in 1951 and moved into a West Hampstead flat with him and two other students that June. Halliwell was seven years older than Orton; they quickly formed a strong relationship and became lovers.

After graduating, both Orton and Halliwell went into regional repertory work: Orton spent four months in Ipswich as an assistant stage manager; Halliwell in Llandudno, Wales. Both returned to London and began to write together. They collaborated on a number of unpublished novels (often imitating Ronald Firbank) with no success at gaining publication. The rejection of their great hope, &quot;The Last Days of Sodom,&quot; in 1957 led them to solo works. Orton wrote his last novel, &quot;The Vision of Gombold Proval&quot; (posthumously published as &quot;Head to Toe&quot;), in 1959. He later drew on these manuscripts for ideas; many show glimpses of his stage-play style.

Confident of their &quot;specialness,&quot; Orton and Halliwell refused to work for long periods. They subsisted on Halliwell&#x27;s money (and unemployment benefits) and were forced to follow an ascetic life to restrict their spending to £5 a week. From 1957 to 1959, they worked in six-month stretches at Cadbury&#x27;s to raise money for a new flat; they moved into a small, austere flat at 25 Noel Road in Islington in 1959.

==Crimes and punishment==
A lack of serious work led them to amuse themselves with pranks and hoaxes. Orton created the second self &quot;Edna Welthorpe&quot;, an elderly theatre snob, whom he later revived to stir controversy over his plays. Orton chose the name as an allusion to Terence Rattigan&#x27;s archetypal playgoer &quot;Aunt Edna&quot;.

From January 1959, Orton and Halliwell began surreptitiously to remove books from several local public libraries and modify the cover art or the blurbs before returning them. A volume of poems by Sir John Betjeman was returned to the library with a new dust jacket featuring a photograph of a nearly naked, heavily tattooed middle-aged man. The couple decorated their flat with many of the prints. They were discovered and prosecuted. On 30 April 1962 they pleaded guilty to two joint charges of theft, the first relating to 36 books taken from Islington Public Library in Essex Road, and the second to 36 books taken from a branch of the same library in Holloway Road. At a further hearing in May 1962 they pleaded guilty to further joint charges of theft and criminal damage, and were sentenced to prison for six months, with fines of £2 each. The incident was reported in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; as &quot;Gorilla in the Roses&quot;, illustrated with the altered &quot;Collins Guide to Roses&quot; by Bertram Park.

Orton and Halliwell felt that the sentence was unduly harsh &quot;because we were queers&quot;. Prison was a crucial formative experience; the isolation from Halliwell allowed Orton to break free of him creatively; and he saw what he considered the corruption, priggishness, and double standards of a purportedly liberal country. As Orton put it: &quot;It affected my attitude towards society. Before I had been vaguely conscious of something rotten somewhere, prison crystallised this. The old whore society really lifted up her skirts and the stench was pretty foul... Being in the nick brought detachment to my writing. I wasn&#x27;t involved any more. And suddenly it worked.&quot; The book covers Orton and Halliwell vandalised have since become a valued part of the Islington Local History Centre collection. Some are exhibited in the Islington Museum.

A collection of the book covers is available online.

==Playwright==

===Breakthrough===
Orton began writing plays in 1959 with &quot;Fred and Madge&quot;; &quot;The Visitors&quot; followed two years later. In 1963, the BBC paid £65 for the radio play &quot;The Ruffian on the Stair&quot;, broadcast on 31 August 1964. It was substantially rewritten for the stage in 1966.

He had completed &quot;Entertaining Mr Sloane&quot; by the time &quot;Ruffian&quot; was broadcast. He sent a copy to theatre agent Peggy Ramsay in December 1963. It premiered at the New Arts Theatre in Westminster 6 May 1964, produced by Michael Codron. Reviews ranged from praise to outrage. &quot;The Times&quot; described it as making &quot;the blood boil more than any other British play in the last 10 years&quot;.

&quot;Entertaining Mr Sloane&quot; lost money in its three-week run, but critical praise from playwright Terence Rattigan, who invested £3,000 in it, ensured its survival. The play was transferred to Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in the West End at the end of June and to the Queen&#x27;s Theatre in October. &quot;Sloane&quot; tied for first in the &quot;Variety&quot; Critics&#x27; Poll for Best New Play and Orton came second for Most Promising Playwright. Within a year, &quot;Sloane&quot; was performed in New York, Spain, Israel, and Australia as well as made into a film (after Orton&#x27;s death) and a television play.

===&quot;Loot&quot;===
Orton&#x27;s next performed work was &quot;Loot&quot;. The first draft was written from June to October 1964 and was called &quot;Funeral Games&quot;, a title Orton dropped at Halliwell&#x27;s suggestion but later reused. The play is a wild parody of detective fiction, adding the blackest farce and jabs at established ideas on death, the police, religion, and justice. Orton offered the play to Codron in October 1964 and it underwent sweeping rewrites before it was judged fit for the West End.

Codron had manoeuvred Orton into meeting his colleague Kenneth Williams in August 1964. Orton reworked &quot;Loot&quot; with Williams in mind for Truscott. His other inspiration for the role was DS Harold Challenor. With the success of &quot;Sloane&quot;, &quot;Loot&quot; was hurried into pre-production despite its flaws. Rehearsals began in January 1965, with plans for a six-week tour culminating in a West End debut. The play opened in Cambridge on 1 February to scathing reviews.

Orton, disagreeing with director Peter Wood over the plot, produced 133 pages of new material to replace, or add to, the original 90. But the play received poor reviews in Brighton, Oxford, Bournemouth, Manchester, and finally Wimbledon in mid-March. Discouraged, Orton and Halliwell went on an 80-day holiday in Tangiers.

In January 1966, &quot;Loot&quot; was revived, with Oscar Lewenstein taking up an option. Before his production, it had a short run (11–23 April) at the University Theatre, Manchester. Orton&#x27;s growing experience led him to cut over 600 lines, raising the tempo and improving the characters&#x27; interactions. Directed by Braham Murray, the play garnered more favourable reviews. Lewenstein put the London production in a &quot;sort of Off-West End theatre,&quot; the Jeannetta Cochrane Theatre in Bloomsbury, under the direction of Charles Marowitz.

Orton clashed with Marowitz, although the additional cuts further improved the play. This production was first staged in London on 27 September 1966, to rave reviews. Ronald Bryden in &quot;The Observer&quot; asserted that it had &quot;established Orton&#x27;s niche in English drama&quot;. &quot;Loot&quot; moved to the Criterion Theatre in November where it ran for 342 performances. This time it won several awards, and Orton sold the film rights for £25,000. &quot;Loot&quot;, when performed on Broadway in 1968, repeated the failure of &quot;Sloane&quot;, and the film version of the play was not a success when it surfaced in 1970.

===Later works===
Over the next ten months, he revised &quot;The Ruffian on the Stair&quot; and &quot;The Erpingham Camp&quot; for the stage as a double called &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot;, wrote &quot;Funeral Games&quot;, the screenplay &quot;Up Against It&quot; for the Beatles, and his final full-length play, &quot;What the Butler Saw&quot;.

&quot;The Erpingham Camp&quot;, Orton&#x27;s take on &quot;The Bacchae&quot;, written through mid-1965 and offered to Associated-Rediffusion in October of that year, was broadcast on 27 June 1966 as the &quot;pride&quot; segment in their series &quot;Seven Deadly Sins&quot;. &quot;The Good and Faithful Servant&quot; was a transitional work for Orton. A one-act television play, it was completed by June 1964 but first broadcast by Associated-Rediffusion on 6 April 1967, representing &quot;faith&quot; in the series &quot;Seven Deadly Virtues&quot;.

Orton rewrote &quot;Funeral Games&quot; four times from July to November 1966. Also intended for &quot;The Seven Deadly Virtues&quot;, it dealt with charity – Christian charity – in a confusion of adultery and murder. Rediffusion did not use the play; instead, it was made as one of the first productions of the new ITV company Yorkshire Television, and broadcast posthumously in the &quot;Playhouse&quot; series on 26 August 1968, five weeks after an adaptation of &quot;Mr Sloane&quot;.

In March 1967, Orton and Halliwell had intended another extended holiday in Libya, but they returned home after one day because the only hotel accommodation they could find was a boat that had been converted into a hotel/nightclub. They spent May and June holidaying in Tangier, Morocco, where they frequently engaged in sex with teenage boys.

Orton&#x27;s once controversial farce &quot;What The Butler Saw&quot; was staged in the West End in 1969, more than 18 months after his death. It opened in March at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre with Sir Ralph Richardson, Coral Browne, Stanley Baxter and Hayward Morse.

==Murder==

On 9 August 1967, Halliwell bludgeoned to death the 34-year-old Orton at their home in Noel Road with nine hammer blows to the head. Halliwell then killed himself with an overdose of Nembutal.

In 1970, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that four days before the murder, Orton had told a friend that he wanted to end his relationship with Halliwell, but did not know how to go about it.

Halliwell&#x27;s doctor spoke to him by telephone three times on the day of the murder, and had arranged for him to see a psychiatrist the following morning. The last call was at 10 o&#x27;clock, during which Halliwell told the doctor, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m feeling better now. I&#x27;ll go and see the doctor tomorrow morning.&quot;

Halliwell had felt increasingly threatened and isolated by Orton&#x27;s success, and had come to rely on antidepressants and barbiturates. The bodies were discovered the following morning when a chauffeur arrived to take Orton to a meeting with director Richard Lester to discuss filming options on &quot;Up Against It&quot;. Halliwell left a suicide note: &quot;If you read his diary, all will be explained. KH PS: Especially the latter part.&quot; This is presumed to be a reference to Orton&#x27;s description of his promiscuity; the diary contains numerous incidents of cottaging in public lavatories and other casual sexual encounters with teenagers, including with rent boys on holiday in North Africa. The diaries have since been published. The last diary entry is dated 1 August 1967 and ends abruptly in midsentence at the end of the page, suggesting that some pages may be missing.

Orton was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium, his maroon cloth-draped coffin being brought into the west chapel to a recording of The Beatles song &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;. Harold Pinter read the eulogy, concluding with &quot;He was a bloody marvellous writer.&quot; Orton&#x27;s agent Peggy Ramsay described Orton&#x27;s relatives as &quot;the little people in Leicester&quot;, leaving a cold, nondescript note and bouquet at the funeral on their behalf.

At the suggestion of Halliwell&#x27;s family, Peggy Ramsay asked Orton&#x27;s brother Douglas if Orton and Halliwell&#x27;s ashes could be mixed. Douglas agreed, &quot;As long as nobody hears about it in Leicester.&quot; The mixed ashes were scattered in section 3-C of the Garden of Remembrance at Golders Green. There is no memorial.

==Biography and film, radio, TV==
John Lahr&#x27;s biography of Orton, entitled &quot;Prick Up Your Ears&quot; (a title Orton himself had considered using), was published in 1978 by Bloomsbury. A 1987 film adaptation of the same name was released based on Orton&#x27;s diaries and on Lahr&#x27;s research. Directed by Stephen Frears, it stars Gary Oldman as Orton, Alfred Molina as Halliwell, and Vanessa Redgrave as Peggy Ramsay. Alan Bennett wrote the screenplay. Katrina Sheldon was the sound editor.

Carlos Be wrote a play about Orton and Halliwell&#x27;s last days, &quot;25 Noel Road: A Genius Like Us&quot;, first performed in 2001. It received its New York premiere in 2012, produced by Repertorio Español.

Joe Orton was played by the actor Kenny Doughty in the 2006 BBC film &quot;Kenneth Williams: Fantabulosa!&quot;, starring Michael Sheen as Kenneth Williams.

Leonie Orton Barnett&#x27;s memoir &quot;I Had It in Me&quot; was published in 2016 containing new information about her brother&#x27;s life growing up in Leicester.

In 2017, film-maker Chris Shepherd made an animated short inspired by Orton&#x27;s Edna Welthorpe letters, &#x27;Yours Faithfully, Edna Welthorpe (Mrs)&#x27;, starring Alison Steadman as Edna.

Two archive recordings of Orton are known to survive: a short BBC radio interview first transmitted in August 1967 and a video recording, held by the British Film Institute, of his appearance on Eamonn Andrews&#x27; ITV chat show transmitted 23 April 1967.

== Legacy ==
A pedestrian concourse in front of the Curve theatre in Leicester has been renamed Orton Square.

In July 2019, Dr Emma Parker, professor at the University of Leicester and an Orton expert, began a campaign to honour him with a statue in his native city, Leicester. The campaign enjoyed prominent support from the acting community, including from Sheila Hancock, Kenneth Cranham, Ian McKellen and Alec Baldwin. Although the fundraising target was met, the project was cancelled in 2022, with the organisers citing pandemic challenges and changing attitudes to statues in Britain.

<doc id="16488" wikidata="Q712924" url="?curid=16488" title="Julian Jaynes">
<text>Julian Jaynes (February 27, 1920 – November 21, 1997) was an American psychologist at Yale and Princeton for nearly 25 years, best known for his 1976 book &quot;The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind&quot;. His career was dedicated to the problem of consciousness: &quot;the difference between what others see of us and our sense of our inner selves and the deep feelings that sustain it. ... Men have been conscious of the problem of consciousness almost since consciousness began.&quot; Jaynes&#x27;s solution touches on many disciplines, including neuroscience, linguistics, psychology, archeology, history, religion and analysis of ancient texts.

==Early life==
Jaynes was born and lived in West Newton, Massachusetts, son of Julian Clifford Jaynes (1854–1922), a Unitarian minister, and Clara Bullard Jaynes (1884–1980). He had an older sister, Helen, and a younger brother, Robert. The family had a summer home in Keppoch, Prince Edward Island, which was a place Jaynes loved, and which gave him a Canadian connection for his entire life.

In the summer of 1939 he registered to attend Harvard University but took a scholarship from McGill University, where he graduated in 1941 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology, and then began graduate studies at the University of Toronto to learn more about the brain. His studies were interrupted during the Second World War: because of his Unitarian principles, he applied for and received official recognition as a conscientious objector, but refused to comply with the U.S. government&#x27;s law for pacifists; Jaynes spent three years in the penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, working in the prison hospital. On his release in 1946 he enrolled at Yale University hoping that in animal behavior he would find clues to the beginnings of consciousness. Jaynes received his master&#x27;s degree in 1948, and then refused to accept his doctorate, again on a dispute of &quot;principle&quot; regarding educational credentials. After Yale, Jaynes spent several years in England working as an actor and playwright.

==Academic career==
He returned to Yale in 1954, working as an Instructor and Lecturer until 1960, making significant contributions in the fields of experimental psychology, learning, and ethology, and co-publishing some papers with Frank A. Beach. Jaynes had begun to turn his focus to comparative psychology and the history of psychology, and in 1964 he became a research associate at Princeton University. There he befriended Edwin G. Boring, and with plenty of time to pursue the problem of consciousness, Princeton became his academic home until 1995.

===Research and motivations===
Jaynes had dedicated years of research in psychology to the problem of consciousness and he had sought the roots of consciousness in the processes of learning and cognition that animals and humans shared in common, in accord with prevailing evolutionary assumptions that dominated mid-20th century thinking. He had established his reputation in the study of animal learning and natural animal behaviour, and in 1968 he lectured on the history of comparative psychology at the National Science Foundation Summer Institute. In September 1969 he gave his first public address on his &quot;new theory of consciousness&quot; at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association.

His &quot;radical approach&quot; explained the phenomena of introspection as dependent on culture and language, especially metaphors, more than on the physiology of the brain. This was a challenge to mainstream assumptions of 20th century research, especially to those that justified looking for origins of consciousness in evolution. It was also a challenge to the behaviorists, who, &quot;under the tutelage of John Watson, solved the problem of consciousness by ignoring it.&quot; What they had &#x27;ignored&#x27; were the problems of introspection and the weaknesses of introspectionist methods of 19th century psychologists. Those 20th century thinkers who questioned the existence of introspection never doubted the existence of sense perception, however; they clearly distinguished between the two. On the other hand, in later years Jaynes&#x27;s approach had become &quot;radical&quot; for emphasizing the distinction. Jaynes differed with those who ignored it, for example Stuart Sutherland, who simply defined consciousness as &#x27;awareness&#x27;. Jaynes acknowledged that his whole argument was &quot;contradictory to the usual and [...] superficial views of consciousness&quot;, and he insisted that &quot;the most common error&quot; people make &quot;is to confuse consciousness with perception.&quot;
But there can be no progress in the science of consciousness until careful distinctions have been made between what is introspectable and all the hosts of other neural abilities we have come to call cognition. Consciousness is not the same as cognition and should be sharply distinguished from it. 

In the years following, Jaynes talked more about how consciousness began, presenting &quot;his talk [...] widely, as word of his slightly outrageous but tantalizing theory had spread.&quot; In 1972 he had delivered a paper, &quot;The Origin of Consciousness&quot;, at Cornell University, writing: &quot;For if consciousness is based on language, then it follows that only humans are conscious, and that we became so at some historical epoch after language was evolved.&quot; This took Jaynes, as he put it, directly into &quot;the earliest writings of mankind to see if we can find any hints as to when this important invention of consciousness might have occurred.&quot; He went to ancient texts searching for early evidence of consciousness, and found what he believed to be evidence of remarkably recent . In the semi-historical Greek epic the &quot;Iliad&quot; Jaynes found &quot;the earliest writing of men in a language that we can really comprehend, [which] when looked at objectively, reveals a very different mentality from our own.&quot; In a 1978 interview, Richard Rhodes reported that Jaynes &quot;took up the study of Greek to trace Greek words for mind back to their origins. By the time he got to the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the words had become concrete, but there is no word for mind in the &quot;Iliad&quot; at all.&quot;

===Publications and theories===

Jaynes&#x27;s one and only book, published in 1976, is &quot;The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind&quot;. The topic of consciousness – &quot;the human ability to introspect&quot; – is introduced by reviewing prior efforts to explain its problematic nature: those efforts, as one of Jaynes&#x27;s early critics has acknowledged, add up to a &quot;spectacular history of failure&quot;. Abandoning the assumption that consciousness is innate, Jaynes explains it instead as a learned behavior that &quot;arises ... from language, and specifically from metaphor.&quot; With this understanding, Jaynes then demonstrates that ancient texts and archeology can reveal a history of human mentality alongside the histories of other cultural products. His analysis of the evidence leads him not only to place the origin of consciousness during the 2nd millennium BCE but also to hypothesize the existence of an older non-conscious &quot;mentality that he calls the bicameral mind, referring to the brain&#x27;s two hemispheres&quot;.

After publishing , Jaynes was frequently invited to speak at conferences and as a guest lecturer at other universities. In 1984, he was invited to give the plenary lecture at the Wittgenstein Symposium in Kirchberg, Austria. He gave six major lectures in 1985 and nine in 1986. He was awarded an honorary PhD by Rhode Island College in 1979 and another from Elizabethtown College in 1985.

Jaynes wrote an extensive afterword for the 1990 edition of his book, in which he addressed criticisms and clarified that his theory has four separate hypotheses: 1) consciousness is based on and accessed by language; 2) the non-conscious bicameral mind is based on verbal hallucinations; 3) the breakdown of bicameral mind precedes consciousness, but the dating is variable; 4) the &#x27;double brain&#x27; of bicamerality is based on the two hemispheres of the cerebral cortex being organized differently from today&#x27;s functional lateralization. He also expanded on the impact of consciousness on imagination and memory, notions of the self, emotions, anxiety, guilt, and sexuality.

==Death==
Jaynes died at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, on November 21, 1997. In 2006, his biographers Woodward and Tower reported that Jaynes &quot;felt he had not truly succeeded&quot; in his lifelong work because, in their words, &quot;[h]e was right&quot; about his feeling that &quot;there were people who disagreed with him [who] had not really read his book or understood it.&quot;

==Legacy==
The Julian Jaynes Society was founded by Marcel Kuijsten in 1997, shortly after Jaynes&#x27;s death. The society has published a number of books on Julian Jaynes&#x27;s theory including foreign-language editions of Julian Jaynes&#x27;s theory in French, German, and Spanish. The society also maintains a member area, with articles, lectures, and interviews on Jaynes&#x27;s theory.

<doc id="16489" wikidata="Q159876" url="?curid=16489" title="Julia Kristeva">
<text>Julia Kristeva (; ; born Yuliya Stoyanova Krasteva, ; on 24 June 1941) is a Bulgarian-French philosopher, literary critic, semiotician, psychoanalyst, feminist, and novelist who has lived in France since the mid-1960s. She has taught at Columbia University, and is now a professor emerita at Université Paris Cité. The author of more than 30 books, including &quot;Powers of Horror&quot;, &quot;Tales of Love&quot;, &quot;Black Sun: Depression and Melancholia&quot;, &quot;Proust and the Sense of Time&quot;, and the trilogy &quot;Female Genius&quot;, she has been awarded Commander of the Legion of Honor, Commander of the Order of Merit, the Holberg International Memorial Prize, the Hannah Arendt Prize, and the Vision 97 Foundation Prize, awarded by the Havel Foundation.

Kristeva became influential in international critical analysis, cultural studies and feminism after publishing her first book, &quot;Semeiotikè&quot;, in 1969. Her sizeable body of work includes books and essays which address intertextuality, the semiotic, and abjection, in the fields of linguistics, literary theory and criticism, psychoanalysis, biography and autobiography, political and cultural analysis, art and art history. She is prominent in structuralist and poststructuralist thought.

Kristeva is also the founder of the Simone de Beauvoir Prize committee.

==Life==
Born in Sliven, Bulgaria to Christian parents, Kristeva is the daughter of a church accountant. On her mother&#x27;s side, she has distant Jewish ancestry. Kristeva and her sister attended a Francophone school run by Dominican nuns. Kristeva became acquainted with the work of Mikhail Bakhtin at this time in Bulgaria. Kristeva went on to study at the University of Sofia, and while a postgraduate there obtained a research fellowship that enabled her to move to France in December 1965, when she was 24. She continued her education at several French universities, studying under Lucien Goldmann and Roland Barthes, among other scholars. On August 2, 1967, Kristeva married the novelist Philippe Sollers, born Philippe Joyaux.

Kristeva taught at Columbia University in the early 1970s, and remains a visiting professor. She has also published under the married name Julia Joyaux.

==Work==
After joining the &#x27;Tel Quel group&#x27; founded by Sollers, Kristeva focused on the politics of language and became an active member of the group. She trained in psychoanalysis, and earned her degree in 1979. In some ways, her work can be seen as trying to adapt a psychoanalytic approach to the poststructuralist criticism. For example, her view of the subject, and its construction, shares similarities with Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan. However, Kristeva rejects any understanding of the subject in a structuralist sense; instead, she favors a subject always &quot;in process&quot; or &quot;on trial&quot;. In this way, she contributes to the poststructuralist critique of essentialized structures, whilst preserving the teachings of psychoanalysis. She travelled to China in the 1970s and later wrote &quot;About Chinese Women&quot; (1977).

===The &quot;semiotic&quot; and the &quot;symbolic&quot;===
One of Kristeva&#x27;s most important contributions is that signification is composed of two elements, the symbolic and the &quot;semiotic&quot;, the latter being distinct from the discipline of semiotics founded by Ferdinand de Saussure. As explained by Augustine Perumalil, Kristeva&#x27;s &quot;semiotic is closely related to the infantile pre-Oedipal referred to in the works of Freud, Otto Rank, Melanie Klein, British Object Relation psychoanalysis, and Lacan&#x27;s pre-mirror stage. It is an emotional field, tied to the instincts, which dwells in the fissures and prosody of language rather than in the denotative meanings of words.&quot; Furthermore, according to Birgit Schippers, the semiotic is a realm associated with the musical, the poetic, the rhythmic, and that which lacks structure and meaning. It is closely tied to the &quot;feminine&quot;, and represents the undifferentiated state of the pre-Mirror Stage infant.

Upon entering the Mirror Stage, the child learns to distinguish between self and other, and enters the realm of shared cultural meaning, known as the symbolic. In &quot;Desire in Language&quot; (1980), Kristeva describes the symbolic as the space in which the development of language allows the child to become a &quot;speaking subject,&quot; and to develop a sense of identity separate from the mother. This process of separation is known as abjection, whereby the child must reject and move away from the mother in order to enter into the world of language, culture, meaning, and the social. This realm of language is called the symbolic and is contrasted with the semiotic in that it is associated with the masculine, the law, and structure. Kristeva departs from Lacan in the idea that even after entering the symbolic, the subject continues to oscillate between the semiotic and the symbolic. Therefore, rather than arriving at a fixed identity, the subject is permanently &quot;in process&quot;. Because female children continue to identify to some degree with the mother figure, they are especially likely to retain a close connection to the semiotic. This continued identification with the mother may result in what Kristeva refers to in &quot;Black Sun&quot; (1989) as melancholia (depression), given that female children simultaneously reject and identify with the mother figure.

It has also been suggested (e.g., Creed, 1993) that the degradation of women and women&#x27;s bodies in popular culture (and particularly, for example, in slasher films) emerges because of the threat to identity that the mother&#x27;s body poses: it is a reminder of time spent in the undifferentiated state of the semiotic, where one has no concept of self or identity. After abjecting the mother, subjects retain an unconscious fascination with the semiotic, desiring to reunite with the mother, while at the same time fearing the loss of identity that accompanies it. Slasher films thus provide a way for audience members to safely reenact the process of abjection by vicariously expelling and destroying the mother figure.

Kristeva is also known for her adoption of Plato’s idea of the &quot;chora&quot;, meaning &quot;a nourishing maternal space&quot; (Schippers, 2011). Kristeva&#x27;s idea of the &quot;chora&quot; has been interpreted in several ways: as a reference to the uterus, as a metaphor for the relationship between the mother and child, and as the temporal period preceding the Mirror Stage. In her essay &quot;Motherhood According to Giovanni Bellini&quot; from &quot;Desire in Language&quot; (1980), Kristeva refers to the &quot;chora&quot; as a &quot;non-expressive totality formed by drives and their stases in a motility that is as full of movement as it is regulated.&quot; She goes on to suggest that it is the mother&#x27;s body that mediates between the &quot;chora&quot; and the symbolic realm: the mother has access to culture and meaning, yet also forms a totalizing bond with the child.

Kristeva is also noted for her work on the concept of intertextuality.

===Anthropology and psychology===
Kristeva argues that anthropology and psychology, or the connection between the social and the subject, do not represent each other, but rather follow the same logic: the survival of the group and the subject. Furthermore, in her analysis of Oedipus, she claims that the speaking subject cannot exist on his/her own, but that he/she &quot;stands on the fragile threshold as if stranded on account of an impossible demarcation&quot; (&quot;Powers of Horror&quot;, p. 85).

In her comparison between the two disciplines, Kristeva claims that the way in which an individual excludes the abject mother as a means of forming an identity, is the same way in which societies are constructed. On a broader scale, cultures exclude the maternal and the feminine, and by this come into being.

==Feminism==
Kristeva has been regarded as a key proponent of French feminism together with Simone de Beauvoir, Hélène Cixous, and Luce Irigaray. Kristeva has had a remarkable influence on feminism and feminist literary studies in the US and the UK, as well as on readings into contemporary art although her relation to feminist circles and movements in France has been quite controversial. Kristeva made a famous disambiguation of three types of feminism in &quot;Women&#x27;s Time&quot; in &quot;New Maladies of the Soul&quot; (1993); while rejecting the first two types, including that of Beauvoir, her stands are sometimes considered rejecting feminism altogether. Kristeva proposed the idea of multiple sexual identities against the joined code of &quot;unified feminine language&quot;.

===Denunciation of identity politics===
Kristeva argues her writings have been misunderstood by American feminist academics. In Kristeva&#x27;s view, it was not enough simply to dissect the structure of language in order to find its hidden meaning. Language should also be viewed through the prisms of history and of individual psychic and sexual experiences. This post-structuralist approach enabled specific social groups to trace the source of their oppression to the very language they used. However, Kristeva believes that it is harmful to posit collective identity above individual identity, and that this political assertion of sexual, ethnic, and religious identities is ultimately totalitarian.

==Novelist==
Kristeva has written a number of novels that resemble detective stories. While the books maintain narrative suspense and develop a stylized surface, her readers also encounter ideas intrinsic to her theoretical projects. Her characters reveal themselves mainly through psychological devices, making her type of fiction mostly resemble the later work of Dostoevsky. Her fictional oeuvre, which includes &quot;The Old Man and the Wolves&quot;, &quot;Murder in Byzantium&quot;, and &quot;Possessions&quot;, while often allegorical, also approaches the autobiographical in some passages, especially with one of the protagonists of &quot;Possessions&quot;, Stephanie Delacour—a French journalist—who can be seen as Kristeva&#x27;s alter ego. &quot;Murder in Byzantium&quot; deals with themes from orthodox Christianity and politics; she referred to it as &quot;a kind of anti-Da Vinci Code&quot;.

==Honors==
For her &quot;innovative explorations of questions on the intersection of language, culture and literature&quot;, Kristeva was awarded the Holberg International Memorial Prize in 2004. She won the 2006 Hannah Arendt Prize for Political Thought. She has also been awarded Commander of the Legion of Honor, Commander of the Order of Merit, and the Vaclav Havel Prize. On October 10, 2019, she received an &quot;honoris causa&quot; doctorate from Universidade Católica Portuguesa.

==Scholarly reception==
Roman Jakobson said that &quot;Both readers and listeners, whether agreeing or in stubborn disagreement with Julia Kristeva, feel indeed attracted to her contagious voice and to her genuine gift of questioning generally adopted &#x27;axioms,&#x27; and her contrary gift of releasing various &#x27;damned questions&#x27; from their traditional question marks.&quot;

Roland Barthes comments that &quot;Julia Kristeva changes the place of things: she always destroys the last prejudice, the one you thought you could be reassured by, could be take [sic] pride in; what she displaces is the already-said, the déja-dit, i.e., the instance of the signified, i.e., stupidity; what she subverts is authority -the authority of monologic science, of filiation.&quot; 
Ian Almond criticizes Kristeva&#x27;s ethnocentrism. He cites Gayatri Spivak&#x27;s conclusion that Kristeva&#x27;s book &quot;About Chinese Women&quot; &quot;belongs to that very eighteenth century [that] Kristeva scorns&quot; after pinpointing &quot;the brief, expansive, often completely ungrounded way in which she writes about two thousand years of a culture she is unfamiliar with&quot;. Almond notes the absence of sophistication in Kristeva&#x27;s remarks concerning the Muslim world and the dismissive terminology she uses to describe its culture and believers. He criticizes Kristeva&#x27;s opposition which juxtaposes &quot;Islamic societies&quot; against &quot;democracies where life is still fairly pleasant&quot; by pointing out that Kristeva displays no awareness of the complex and nuanced debate ongoing among women theorists in the Muslim world, and that she does not refer to anything other than the Rushdie fatwa in dismissing the entire Muslim faith as &quot;reactionary and persecutory&quot;.

In &quot;Impostures intellectuelles&quot; (1997), physics professors Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont devote a chapter to Kristeva&#x27;s use of mathematics in her early writings. They argue that Kristeva fails to show the relevance of the mathematical concepts she discusses to linguistics and the other fields she studies, and that no such relevance exists.

==Alleged collaboration with the Communist Regime in Bulgaria==
In 2018, Bulgaria&#x27;s state Dossier Commission announced that Kristeva had been an agent for the Committee for State Security under the code name &quot;Sabina&quot;. She was supposedly recruited in June 1971. Five years earlier she left Bulgaria to study in France. Under the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria, any Bulgarian who wanted to travel abroad had to apply for an exit visa and get an approval from the Ministry of Interior. The process was long and difficult because anyone who made it to the west could declare political asylum. Kristeva has called the allegations &quot;grotesque and false&quot;. On 30 March, the state Dossier Commission began publishing online the entire set of documents reflecting Kristeva&#x27;s activity as an informant of the former Committee for State Security. She vigorously denies the charges.

Neal Ascherson wrote: &quot;...the recent fuss about Julia Kristeva boils down to nothing much, although it has suited some to inflate it into a fearful scandal... But the reality shown in her files is trivial. After settling in Paris in 1965, she was cornered by Bulgarian spooks who pointed out to her that she still had a vulnerable family in the home country. So she agreed to regular meetings over many years, in the course of which she seems to have told her handlers nothing more than gossip about Aragon, Bataille &amp; Co. from the Left Bank cafés – stuff they could have read in &quot;Le Canard enchaîné&quot;... the combined intelligence value of its product and her reports was almost zero. The Bulgarian security men seem to have known they were being played. But never mind: they could impress their boss by showing him a real international celeb on their books...&quot;

<doc id="16493" wikidata="Q752518" url="?curid=16493" title="Just intonation">
<text>In music, just intonation or pure intonation is the tuning of musical intervals as whole number ratios (such as 3:2 or 4:3) of frequencies. An interval tuned in this way is said to be pure, and is called a just interval. Just intervals (and chords created by combining them) consist of tones from a single harmonic series of an implied fundamental. For example, in the diagram, if the notes G3 and C4 (labelled 3 and 4) are tuned as members of the harmonic series of the lowest C, their frequencies will be 3 and 4 times the fundamental frequency. The interval ratio between C4 and G3 is therefore 4:3, a just fourth.

In Western musical practice, bowed instruments such as violins, violas, cellos, and double basses are tuned using pure fifths or fourths. In contrast, keyboard instruments are rarely tuned using only pure intervals—the desire for different keys to have identical intervals in Western music makes this impractical. Some instruments of fixed pitch, such as electric pianos, are commonly tuned using equal temperament, in which all intervals other than octaves consist of irrational-number frequency ratios. Acoustic pianos are usually tuned with the octaves slightly widened, and thus with no pure intervals at all.

The phrase &quot;just intonation&quot; is used both to refer to one specific version of a 5-limit diatonic intonation, that is, Ptolemy&#x27;s intense diatonic, as well to a whole class of tunings which use whole number intervals derived from the harmonic series. In this sense, &quot;just intonation&quot; is differentiated from equal temperaments and the &quot;tempered&quot; tunings of the early renaissance and baroque, such as Well temperament, or Meantone temperament. Since 5-limit has been the most prevalent just intonation used in western music, western musicians have subsequently tended to consider this scale to be the only version of just intonation. In principle, there are an infinite number of possible &quot;just intonations&quot;, since the harmonic series is infinite.

==Terminology==

Just intonations are categorized by the notion of limits. The limit refers to the highest prime number fraction included in the intervals of a scale. All the intervals of any 3 limit just intonation will be multiples of 3. So is included in 5 limit, because it has 5 in the denominator. If a scale uses an interval of 21:20, it is a 7 limit just intonation, since 21 is a multiple of 7. The interval is a 3 limit interval because the numerator and denominator are multiples of 3 and 2, respectively. It is possible to have a scale that uses 5 limit intervals but not 2 limit intervals, i.e. no octaves, such as Wendy Carlos&#x27;s alpha and beta scales. It is also possible to make diatonic scales that do not use fourths or fifths (3 limit), but use 5 and 7 limit intervals only. Thus, the notion of limit is a helpful distinction, but certainly does not tell us everything there is to know about a particular scale.

Pythagorean tuning, or 3 limit tuning, allows ratios including the numbers 2 and 3 and their powers, such as 3:2, a perfect fifth, and 9:4, a major ninth. Although the interval from C to G is called a perfect fifth for purposes of music analysis regardless of its tuning method, for purposes of discussing tuning systems musicologists may distinguish between a &quot;perfect fifth&quot; created using the 3:2 ratio and a &quot;tempered fifth&quot; using some other system, such as meantone or equal temperament.

5-limit tuning encompasses ratios additionally using the number 5 and its powers, such as 5:4, a major third, and 15:8, a major seventh. The specialized term &quot;perfect third&quot; is occasionally used to distinguish the 5:4 ratio from major thirds created using other tuning methods. 7 limit and higher systems use higher prime number partials in the overtone series (e.g. 11, 13, 17, etc.)

Commas are very small intervals that result from minute differences between pairs of just intervals. For example, the (5 limit) 5:4 ratio is different from the Pythagorean (3 limit) major third (81:64) by a difference of 81:80, called the syntonic comma. The septimal comma, the ratio of 64:63, is a 7 limit interval which is the distance between the Pythagorean semi-ditone, , and the septimal minor third, 7:6 , since formula_1

A cent is a measure of interval size. It is logarithmic in the musical frequency ratios. The octave is divided into 1200 steps, 100 cents for each semitone. Cents are often used to describe how much a just interval deviates from For example, the major third is 400 cents in 12 TET, but the 5th harmonic, 5:4 is 386.314 cents. Thus, the just major third deviates by −13.686 cents.

==History==
Pythagorean tuning has been attributed to both Pythagoras and Eratosthenes by later writers, but may have been analyzed by other early Greeks or other early cultures as well. The oldest known description of the Pythagorean tuning system appears in Babylonian artifacts.

During the second century AD, Claudius Ptolemy described a 5-limit diatonic scale in his influential text on music theory &quot;Harmonics&quot;, which he called &quot;intense diatonic&quot;. Given ratios of string lengths 120, , 100, 90, 80, 75, , and 60, Ptolemy quantified the tuning of what would later be called the Phrygian scale (equivalent to the major scale beginning and ending on the third note) – 16:15, 9:8, 10:9, 9:8, 16:15, 9:8, and 10:9.

Ptolemy describes a variety of other just intonations derived from history (Pythagoras, Philolaus, Archytas, Aristoxenus, Eratosthenes, and Didymus) and several of his own discovery / invention, including many interval patterns in 3-limit, 5-limit, 7-limit, and even an 11-limit diatonic.

Non-Western music, particularly that built on pentatonic scales, is largely tuned using just intonation. In China, the guqin has a musical scale based on harmonic overtone positions. The dots on its soundboard indicate the harmonic positions: , , , , , , , , , , , , . Indian music has an extensive theoretical framework for tuning in just intonation.

==Diatonic scale==

The prominent notes of a given scale may be tuned so that their frequencies form (relatively) small whole number ratios.

The 5 limit diatonic major scale is tuned in such a way that major triads on the tonic, subdominant, and dominant are tuned in the proportion 4:5:6, and minor triads on the mediant and submediant are tuned in the proportion 10:12:15. Because of the two sizes of wholetone – 9:8 (greater wholetone) and 10:9 (lesser wholetone) – the supertonic must be microtonally lowered by a syntonic comma to form a pure minor triad.

The 5 limit diatonic major scale (Ptolemy&#x27;s intense diatonic scale) on C is shown in the table below:

In this example the interval from D up to A would be a wolf fifth with the ratio , about 680 cents; noticeably smaller than the 702 cents of the pure ratio. This is mentioned by Schenker in reference to the teaching of Bruckner.

For a justly tuned diatonic minor scale, the mediant is tuned 6:5 and the submediant is tuned 8:5. It would include a tuning of 9:5 for the subtonic. For example, on A:

==Twelve-tone scale==

There are several ways to create a just tuning of the twelve-tone scale.

===Pythagorean tuning===
Pythagorean tuning can produce a twelve-tone scale, but it does so by involving ratios of very large numbers, corresponding to natural harmonics very high in the harmonic series that do not occur widely in physical phenomena. This tuning uses ratios involving only powers of 3 and 2, creating a sequence of just fifths or fourths, as follows:

The ratios are computed with respect to C (the &quot;base note&quot;). Starting from C, they are obtained by moving six steps (around the circle of fifths) to the left and six to the right. Each step consists of a multiplication of the previous pitch by (descending fifth), (ascending fifth), or their inversions ( or ).

Between the enharmonic notes at both ends of this sequence is a pitch ratio of , or about 23 cents, known as the Pythagorean comma. To produce a twelve-tone scale, one of them is arbitrarily discarded. The twelve remaining notes are repeated by increasing or decreasing their frequencies by a power of 2 (the size of one or more octaves) to build scales with multiple octaves (such as the keyboard of a piano). A drawback of Pythagorean tuning is that one of the twelve fifths in this scale is badly tuned and hence unusable (the wolf fifth, either F–D if G is discarded, or B–G if F is discarded). This twelve-tone scale is fairly close to equal temperament, but it does not offer much advantage for tonal harmony because only the perfect intervals (fourth, fifth, and octave) are simple enough to sound pure. Major thirds, for instance, receive the rather unstable interval of 81:64, sharp of the preferred 5:4 by an 81:80 ratio. The primary reason for its use is that it is extremely easy to tune, as its building block, the perfect fifth, is the simplest and consequently the most consonant interval after the octave and unison.

Pythagorean tuning may be regarded as a &quot;three-limit&quot; tuning system, because the ratios can be expressed as a product of integer powers of only whole numbers less than or equal to 3.

===Five-limit tuning===
A twelve-tone scale can also be created by compounding harmonics up to the fifth: namely, by multiplying the frequency of a given reference note (the base note) by powers of 2, 3, or 5, or a combination of them. This method is called five-limit tuning.

To build such a twelve-tone scale (using C as the base note), we may start by constructing a table containing fifteen pitches:

The factors listed in the first row and column are powers of 3 and 5, respectively (e.g., Colors indicate couples of enharmonic notes with almost identical pitch. The ratios are all expressed relative to C in the centre of this diagram (the base note for this scale). They are computed in two steps:

# For each cell of the table, a &quot;base ratio&quot; is obtained by multiplying the corresponding factors. For instance, the base ratio for the lower-left cell is 
# The base ratio is then multiplied by a negative or positive power of 2, as large as needed to bring it within the range of the octave starting from C (from 1:1 to 2:1). For instance, the base ratio for the lower left cell () is multiplied by 2, and the resulting ratio is 64:45, which is a number between 1:1 and 2:1.

Note that the powers of 2 used in the second step may be interpreted as ascending or descending octaves. For instance, multiplying the frequency of a note by 2 means increasing it by 6 octaves. Moreover, each row of the table may be considered to be a sequence of fifths (ascending to the right), and each column a sequence of major thirds (ascending upward). For instance, in the first row of the table, there is an ascending fifth from D and A, and another one (followed by a descending octave) from A to E. This suggests an alternative but equivalent method for computing the same ratios. For instance, one can obtain A, starting from C, by moving one cell to the left and one upward in the table, which means descending by a fifth and ascending by a major third:

Since this is below C, one needs to move up by an octave to end up within the desired range of ratios (from 1:1 to 2:1):

A 12 tone scale is obtained by removing one note for each couple of enharmonic notes. This can be done in four ways that have in common the removal of G, according to a convention which was valid even for C-based Pythagorean and quarter-comma meantone scales. Note that it is a diminished fifth, close to half an octave, above the tonic C, which is a discordant interval; also its ratio has the largest values in its numerator and denominator of all tones in the scale, which make it least harmonious: All are reasons to avoid it.

The following chart shows one way to obtain a 12 tone scale by removing one note for each pair of enharmonic notes. In this method one discards the first column of the table (labeled &quot;&quot;).

This scale is &quot;asymmetric&quot; in the sense that going up from the tonic two semitones we multiply the frequency by , while going down from the tonic two semitones we do not divide the frequency by . For two methods that give &quot;symmetric&quot; scales, see Five-limit tuning: Twelve-tone scale.

===Extension of the twelve-tone scale===

The table above uses only low powers of 3 and 5 to build the base ratios. However, it can be easily extended by using higher positive and negative powers of the same numbers, such as 5 = 25, 5 = , 3 = 27, or 3 = . A scale with 25, 35 or even more pitches can be obtained by combining these base ratios.

==Indian scales==
In Indian music, the just diatonic scale described above is used, though there are different possibilities, for instance for the sixth pitch (&quot;dha&quot;), and further modifications may be made to all pitches excepting &quot;sa&quot; and &quot;pa&quot;.

Some accounts of Indian intonation system cite a given 12 swaras being divided into 22 shrutis.
According to some musicians, one has a scale of a given 12 pitches and ten in addition (the tonic, shadja (&quot;sa&quot;), and the pure fifth, pancham (&quot;pa&quot;), are inviolate (known as achala
in Indian music theory):
Where we have &quot;two&quot; ratios for a given letter name or swara, we have a difference of 81:80 (22 cents), which is the syntonic comma or the praman in Indian music theory. These notes are known as &quot;chala&quot;. The distance between two letter names comes in to sizes, &quot;poorna&quot; (256:243) and &quot;nyuna&quot; (25:24). One can see the symmetry, looking at it from the tonic, then the octave.

(This is just one example of explaining a 22 Śhruti scale of tones. There are many different explanations.)

==Practical difficulties==

Some fixed just intonation scales and systems, such as the diatonic scale above, produce wolf intervals when the approximately equivalent flat note is substituted for a sharp note not available in the scale, or vice versa. The above scale allows a minor tone to occur next to a semitone which produces the awkward ratio 32:27 for D→F, and still worse, a minor tone next to a fourth giving 40:27 for D→A. Flattening D by a comma to 10:9 alleviates these difficulties but creates new ones: D→G becomes 27:20, and D→B becomes 27:16. This fundamental problem arises in any system of tuning using a limited number of notes.

One can have more frets on a guitar (or keys on a piano) to handle both As, 9:8 with respect to G and 10:9 with respect to G so that A→C can be played as 6:5 while A→D can still be played as 3:2. 9:8 and 10:9 are less than of an octave apart, so mechanical and performance considerations have made this approach extremely rare. And the problem of how to tune complex chords such as C in typical 5 limit just intonation, is left unresolved (for instance, A could be 4:3 below D (making it 9:8, if G is 1) or 4:3 above E (making it 10:9, if G is 1) but not both at the same time, so one of the fourths in the chord will have to be an out-of-tune wolf interval). Most complex (added-tone and extended) chords usually require intervals beyond common 5 limit ratios in order to sound harmonious (for instance, the previous chord could be tuned to 8:10:12:13:18, using the A note from the 13th harmonic), which implies even more keys or frets. However the frets may be removed entirely – unfortunately, this makes in-tune fingering of many chords exceedingly difficult, due to the construction and mechanics of the human hand – and the tuning of most complex chords in just intonation is generally ambiguous.

Some composers deliberately use these wolf intervals and other dissonant intervals as a way to expand the tone color palette of a piece of music. For example, the extended piano pieces &quot;The Well-Tuned Piano&quot; by La Monte Young and &quot;The Harp of New Albion&quot; by Terry Riley use a combination of very consonant and dissonant intervals for musical effect. In &quot;Revelation&quot;, Michael Harrison goes even further, and uses the tempo of beat patterns produced by some dissonant intervals as an integral part of several movements.

When tuned in just intonation, many fixed-pitch instruments cannot be played in a new key without retuning the instrument. For instance, if a piano is tuned in just intonation intervals and a minimum of wolf intervals for the key of G, then only one other key (typically E) can have the same intervals, and many of the keys have a very dissonant and unpleasant sound. This makes modulation within a piece, or playing a repertoire of pieces in different keys, impractical to impossible.

Synthesizers have proven a valuable tool for composers wanting to experiment with just intonation. They can be easily retuned with a microtuner. Many commercial synthesizers provide the ability to use built-in just intonation scales or to create them manually. Wendy Carlos used a system on her 1986 album &quot;Beauty in the Beast&quot;, where one electronic keyboard was used to play the notes, and another used to instantly set the root note to which all intervals were tuned, which allowed for modulation. On her 1987 lecture album &quot;Secrets of Synthesis&quot; there are audible examples of the difference in sound between equal temperament and just intonation.

Many singers (especially barbershop quartets) and fretless instrument players naturally aim for a more just intonation when playing:

: &quot;Don&#x27;t be scared if your intonation differs from that of the piano. It is the piano that is out of tune. The piano with its tempered scale is a compromise in intonation.&quot; — Pablo Casals

In trying to get a more just system for instruments that is more adaptable like the human voice and fretless instruments, the tuning trade-offs between more consonant harmony versus easy transposability (between different keys) have traditionally been too complicated to solve mechanically, though there have been attempts throughout history with various drawbacks, including the archicembalo.

Since the advent of personal computing, there have been more attempts to solve the perceived problem by trying to algorithmically solve what many professional musicians have learned through practice and intuition. Four of the main problems are that consonance cannot be perfect for some complex chords, chords can have internal consistency but clash with the overall direction of the piece, and naively adjusting the tuning only taking into account chords in isolation can lead to a drift where the end of the piece is noticeably higher or lower in overall pitch rather than centered.

Software solutions like Hermode Tuning often analyze solutions chord by chord instead of taking in the global context of the whole piece like it&#x27;s theorized human players do. Since 2017, there has been research to address these problems algorithmically through dynamically adapted just intonation and machine learning.

==Singing and scale-free instruments==

The human voice is among the most pitch-flexible instruments in common use. Pitch can be varied with no restraints and adjusted in the midst of performance, without needing to retune. Although the explicit use of just intonation fell out of favour concurrently with the increasing use of instrumental accompaniment (with its attendant constraints on pitch), most a cappella ensembles naturally tend toward just intonation because of the comfort of its stability. Barbershop quartets are a good example of this.

The unfretted stringed instruments such as those from the violin family (the violin, the viola, and the cello), and the double bass are quite flexible in the way pitches can be adjusted. Stringed instruments that are not playing with fixed pitch instruments tend to adjust the pitch of key notes such as thirds and leading tones so that the pitches differ from equal temperament.

Trombones have a slide that allows arbitrary tuning during performance. French horns can be tuned by shortening or lengthening the main tuning slide on the back of the instrument, with each individual rotary or piston slide for each rotary or piston valve, and by using the right hand inside the bell to adjust the pitch by pushing the hand in deeper to flatten the note, or pulling it out to sharpen the note while playing. Some natural horns also may adjust the tuning with the hand in the bell, and valved cornets, trumpets, Flugelhorns, Saxhorns, Wagner tubas, and tubas have overall and valve-by-valve tuning slides, like valved horns.

Wind instruments with valves are biased towards natural tuning and must be micro-tuned if equal temperament is required.

Other wind instruments, although built to a certain scale, can be micro-tuned to a certain extent by using the embouchure or adjustments to fingering.

==Western composers==
Composers often impose a limit on how complex the ratios may become. For example, a composer who chooses to write in 7-limit just intonation will not employ ratios that use powers of prime numbers larger than 7. Under this scheme, ratios like 11:7 and 13:6 would not be permitted, because 11 and 13 cannot be expressed as powers of those prime numbers ≤ 7 (&quot;i.e.&quot; 2, 3, 5, and 7).

==Staff notation==

Originally a system of notation to describe scales was devised by Hauptmann and modified by Helmholtz (1877); the starting note is presumed Pythagorean; a &quot;+&quot; is placed between if the next note is a just major third up, a &quot;−&quot; if it is a just minor third, among others; finally, subscript numbers are placed on the second note to indicate how many syntonic commas (81:80) to lower by. For example, the Pythagorean major third on C is C+E () while the just major third is C+E1 (). A similar system was devised by Carl Eitz and used in Barbour (1951) in which Pythagorean notes are started with and positive or negative superscript numbers are added indicating how many commas (81:80, syntonic comma) to adjust by. For example, the Pythagorean major third on C is C−E0 while the just major third is C−E−1. An extension of this Pythagorean-based notation to higher primes is the &quot;Helmholtz / Ellis / Wolf / Monzo system&quot; of ASCII symbols and prime-factor-power vectors described in Monzo&#x27;s &quot;Tonalsoft Encyclopaedia&quot;.

While these systems allow precise indication of intervals and pitches in print, more recently some composers have been developing notation methods for Just Intonation using the conventional five-line staff. James Tenney, amongst others, preferred to combine JI ratios with cents deviations from the equal tempered pitches, indicated in a legend or directly in the score, allowing performers to readily use electronic tuning devices if desired.

Beginning in the 1960s, Ben Johnston had proposed an alternative approach, redefining the understanding of conventional symbols (the seven &quot;white&quot; notes, the sharps and flats) and adding further accidentals, each designed to extend the notation into higher prime limits. His notation &quot;begins with the 16th-century Italian definitions of intervals and continues from there.&quot; Johnston notation is based on a diatonic C Major scale tuned in JI (Fig. 4), in which the interval between D (9:8 above C) and A (5:3 above C) is one syntonic comma less than a Pythagorean perfect fifth 3:2. To write a perfect fifth, Johnston introduces a pair of symbols, + and − again, to represent this comma. Thus, a series of perfect fifths beginning with F would proceed C G D A+ E+ B+. The three conventional white notes A E B are tuned as Ptolemaic major thirds (5:4) above F C G respectively. Johnston introduces new symbols for the septimal ( &amp; ), undecimal ( &amp; ), tridecimal ( &amp; ), and further prime-number extensions to create an accidental based exact JI notation for what he has named &quot;Extended Just Intonation&quot; (Fig. 2 &amp; Fig. 3). For example, the Pythagorean major third on C is C-E+ while the just major third is C-E (Fig. 4).

In 2000–2004, Marc Sabat and Wolfgang von Schweinitz worked in Berlin to develop a different accidental-based method, the Extended Helmholtz-Ellis JI Pitch Notation. Following the method of notation suggested by Helmholtz in his classic &quot;On the Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music&quot;, incorporating Ellis&#x27; invention of cents, and continuing Johnston&#x27;s step into &quot;Extended JI&quot;, Sabat and Schweinitz propose unique symbols (accidentals) for each prime dimension of harmonic space. In particular, the conventional flats, naturals and sharps define a Pythagorean series of perfect fifths. The Pythagorean pitches are then paired with new symbols that commatically alter them to represent various other partials of the harmonic series (Fig. 1). To facilitate quick estimation of pitches, cents indications may be added (e.g. downward deviations below and upward deviations above the respective accidental). A typically used convention is that cent deviations refer to the &quot;tempered pitch&quot; implied by the flat, natural, or sharp. A complete legend and fonts for the notation (see samples) are open source and available from the Plainsound Music Edition website. For example, the Pythagorean major third on C is C-E while the just major third is C-E↓ (see Fig. 4 for &quot;combined&quot; symbol)

Sagittal notation (from Latin &quot;sagitta&quot;, &quot;arrow&quot;) is a system of arrow-like accidentals that indicate prime-number comma alterations to tones in a Pythagorean series. It is used to notate both just intonation and equal temperaments. The size of the symbol indicates the size of the alteration.

The great advantage of such notation systems is that they allow the natural harmonic series to be precisely notated. At the same time, they provide some degree of practicality through their extension of staff notation, as traditionally trained performers may draw on their intuition for roughly estimating pitch height. This may be contrasted with the more abstract use of ratios for representing pitches in which the amount by which two pitches differ and the &quot;direction&quot; of change may not be immediately obvious to most musicians. One caveat is the requirement for performers to learn and internalize a (large) number of new graphical symbols. However, the use of unique symbols reduces harmonic ambiguity and the potential confusion arising from indicating only cent deviations.

==Audio examples==
* An A-major scale, followed by three major triads, and then a progression of fifths in just intonation.
* An A-major scale, followed by three major triads, and then a progression of fifths in equal temperament. The beating in this file may be more noticeable after listening to the above file.
* A pair of major thirds, followed by a pair of full major chords. The first in each pair is in equal temperament; the second is in just intonation. Piano sound.
* A pair of major chords. The first is in equal temperament; the second is in just intonation. The pair of chords is repeated with a transition from equal temperament to just intonation between the two chords. In the equal temperament chords a roughness or beating can be heard at about 4 Hz and about 0.8 Hz. In the just intonation triad, this roughness is absent. The square waveform makes the difference between equal temperament and just intonation more obvious.

<text>Flavius Josephus (; , ; ), born Yosef ben Mattityahu (), was a Roman–Jewish historian and military leader. Best known for writing &quot;The Jewish War&quot;, he was born in Jerusalem—then part of the Roman province of Judea—to a father of priestly descent and a mother who claimed Hasmonean royal ancestry.

He initially fought against the Roman Empire during the First Jewish–Roman War as general of the Jewish forces in Galilee, until surrendering in AD 67 to the Roman army led by military commander Vespasian after the six-week siege of Yodfat. Josephus claimed the Jewish messianic prophecies that initiated the First Jewish–Roman War made reference to Vespasian becoming Roman emperor. In response, Vespasian decided to keep him as a slave and presumably interpreter. After Vespasian became emperor in AD 69, he granted Josephus his freedom, at which time Josephus assumed the Emperor&#x27;s family name of &quot;Flavius&quot;.

Flavius Josephus fully defected to the Roman side and was granted Roman citizenship. He became an advisor and close associate of Vespasian&#x27;s son Titus, serving as his translator during Titus&#x27;s protracted siege of Jerusalem in AD 70, which resulted in the near-total razing of the city and the destruction of the Second Temple.

Josephus recorded the Great Jewish Revolt (AD 66–70), including the siege of Masada. His most important works were &quot;The Jewish War&quot; () and &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; ( 94). &quot;The Jewish War&quot; recounts the Jewish revolt against Roman occupation. &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; recounts the history of the world from a Jewish perspective for an ostensibly Greek and Roman audience. These works provide insight into first-century Judaism and the background of Early Christianity. Josephus&#x27;s works are the chief source next to the Bible for the history and antiquity of ancient Israel, and provide an independent extra-biblical account of such figures as Pontius Pilate, Herod the Great, John the Baptist, James, brother of Jesus, and Jesus of Nazareth.

== Biography ==

Josephus was born into one of Jerusalem&#x27;s elite families. He was the second-born son of Matthias, a Jewish priest. His older full-blooded brother was also, like his father, called Matthias. Their mother was an aristocratic woman who was descended from the royal and formerly ruling Hasmonean dynasty. Josephus&#x27;s paternal grandparents were a man also named Joseph(us) and his wife—an unnamed Hebrew noblewoman—distant relatives of each other. Josephus&#x27;s family was wealthy. He descended through his father from the priestly order of the Jehoiarib, which was the first of the 24 orders of priests in the Temple in Jerusalem. Josephus calls himself a fourth-generation descendant of &quot;High Priest Jonathan&quot;, referring to either Jonathan Apphus or Alexander Jannaeus. He was raised in Jerusalem and educated alongside his brother.

In his mid twenties, he traveled to negotiate with Emperor Nero for the release of some Jewish priests. Upon his return to Jerusalem, at the outbreak of the First Jewish–Roman War, Josephus was appointed the military governor of Galilee. His arrival in Galilee, however, was fraught with internal division: the inhabitants of Sepphoris and Tiberias opted to maintain peace with the Romans; the people of Sepphoris enlisted the help of the Roman army to protect their city, while the people of Tiberias appealed to King Agrippa&#x27;s forces to protect them from the insurgents. Josephus trained 65,000 troops in the region.

Josephus also contended with John of Gischala who had also set his sight over the control of Galilee. Like Josephus, John had amassed to himself a large band of supporters from Gischala (Gush Halab) and Gabara, including the support of the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem. Meanwhile, Josephus fortified several towns and villages in Lower Galilee, among which were Tiberias, Bersabe, Selamin, Japha, and Tarichaea, in anticipation of a Roman onslaught. In Upper Galilee, he fortified the towns of Jamnith, Seph, Mero, and Achabare, among other places. Josephus, with the Galileans under his command, managed to bring both Sepphoris and Tiberias into subjection, but was eventually forced to relinquish his hold on Sepphoris by the arrival of Roman forces under Placidus the tribune and later by Vespasian himself. Josephus first engaged the Roman army at a village called Garis, where he launched an attack against Sepphoris a second time, before being repulsed. At length, he resisted the Roman army in its siege of Yodfat (Jotapata) until it fell to the Roman army in the lunar month of Tammuz, in the thirteenth year of Nero&#x27;s reign.

After the Jewish garrison of Yodfat fell under siege, the Romans invaded, killing thousands; the survivors committed suicide. According to Josephus, he was trapped in a cave with 40 of his companions in July 67 AD. The Romans (commanded by Flavius Vespasian and his son Titus, both subsequently Roman emperors) asked the group to surrender, but they refused. According to Josephus&#x27;s account, he suggested a method of collective suicide; they drew lots and killed each other, one by one, and Josephus happened to be one of two men that were left who surrendered to the Roman forces and became prisoners. In 69 AD, Josephus was released. According to his account, he acted as a negotiator with the defenders during the siege of Jerusalem in 70 AD, during which time his parents were held as hostages by Simon bar Giora.

While being confined at Yodfat (Jotapata), Josephus claimed to have experienced a divine revelation that later led to his speech predicting Vespasian would become emperor. After the prediction came true, he was released by Vespasian, who considered his gift of prophecy to be divine. Josephus wrote that his revelation had taught him three things: that God, the creator of the Jewish people, had decided to &quot;punish&quot; them; that &quot;fortune&quot; had been given to the Romans; and that God had chosen him &quot;to announce the things that are to come&quot;. To many Jews, such claims were simply self-serving.

In 71 AD, he went to Rome as part of the entourage of Titus. There, he became a Roman citizen and client of the ruling Flavian dynasty. In addition to Roman citizenship, he was granted accommodation in the conquered Judaea and a pension. While in Rome and under Flavian patronage, Josephus wrote all of his known works. Although he only ever calls himself &quot;Josephus&quot; in his writings, later historians refer to him as &quot;Flavius Josephus&quot;, confirming that he adopted the &quot;nomen&quot; Flavius from his patrons, as was the custom amongst freedmen.

Vespasian arranged for Josephus to marry a captured Jewish woman, whom he later divorced. Around the year 71, Josephus married an Alexandrian Jewish woman as his third wife. They had three sons, of whom only Flavius Hyrcanus survived childhood. Josephus later divorced his third wife. Around 75, he married his fourth wife, a Greek Jewish woman from Crete, who was a member of a distinguished family. They had two sons, Flavius Justus and Flavius Simonides Agrippa.

Josephus&#x27;s life story remains ambiguous. He was described by Harris in 1985 as a law-observant Jew who believed in the compatibility of Judaism and Graeco-Roman thought, commonly referred to as Hellenistic Judaism. &quot;Josippon&quot;, the Hebrew version of Josephus, contains changes. His critics were never satisfied as to why he failed to commit suicide in Galilee, and after his capture, accepted the patronage of Romans.

== Scholarship and impact on history ==
The works of Josephus provide information about the First Jewish–Roman War and also represent literary source material for understanding the context of the Dead Sea Scrolls and late Temple Judaism.

Josephan scholarship had traditionally identified him as a Pharisee. Some authors portrayed him as a member of the sect and as a traitor to the Jewish nation—a view which became known as the classical concept of Josephus. In the mid-20th century, scholars challenged this view and formulated the modern concept of Josephus. They consider him a Pharisee but describe him in part as patriot and a historian of some standing. In his 1991 book, Steve Mason argued that Josephus was not a Pharisee but an orthodox Aristocrat-Priest who became associated with the philosophical school of the Pharisees as a matter of deference, and not by willing association.

=== Impact on history and archaeology ===
The works of Josephus include useful material for historians about individuals, groups, customs, and geographical places. However, modern historians have been cautious of taking his writings at face value. For example, Carl Ritter, in his highly influential &quot;Erdkunde&quot; in the 1840s, wrote in a review of authorities on the ancient geography of the region:
Outside of the Scriptures, Josephus holds the first and the only place among the native authors of Judaea; for Philo of Alexandria, the later Talmud, and other authorities, are of little service in understanding the geography of the country. Josephus is, however, to be used with great care. As a Jewish scholar, as an officer of Galilee, as a military man, and a person of great experience in everything belonging to his own nation, he attained to that remarkable familiarity with his country in every part, which his antiquarian researches so abundantly evince. But he was controlled by political motives: his great purpose was to bring his people, the despised Jewish race, into honour with the Greeks and Romans; and this purpose underlay every sentence, and filled his history with distortions and exaggerations.

Josephus mentions that in his day there were 240 towns and villages scattered across Upper and Lower Galilee, some of which he names. Josephus&#x27;s works are the primary source for the chain of Jewish high priests during the Second Temple period. A few of the Jewish customs named by him include the practice of hanging a linen curtain at the entrance to one&#x27;s house, and the Jewish custom to partake of a Sabbath-day&#x27;s meal around the sixth-hour of the day (at noon). He notes also that it was permissible for Jewish men to marry many wives (polygamy). His writings provide a significant, extra-Biblical account of the post-Exilic period of the Maccabees, the Hasmonean dynasty, and the rise of Herod the Great. He also describes the Sadducees, the Pharisees and Essenes, the Herodian Temple, Quirinius&#x27;s census and the Zealots, and such figures as Pontius Pilate, Herod the Great, Agrippa I and Agrippa II, John the Baptist, James the brother of Jesus, and Jesus. Josephus represents an important source for studies of immediate post-Temple Judaism and the context of early Christianity.

A careful reading of Josephus&#x27;s writings and years of excavation allowed Ehud Netzer, an archaeologist from Hebrew University, to discover what he considered to be the location of Herod&#x27;s Tomb, after searching for 35 years. It was above aqueducts and pools, at a flattened desert site, halfway up the hill to the Herodium, 12 km south of Jerusalem—as described in Josephus&#x27;s writings. In October 2013, archaeologists Joseph Patrich and Benjamin Arubas challenged the identification of the tomb as that of Herod. According to Patrich and Arubas, the tomb is too modest to be Herod&#x27;s and has several unlikely features. Roi Porat, who replaced Netzer as excavation leader after the latter&#x27;s death, stood by the identification.

Josephus&#x27;s writings provide the first-known source for many stories considered as Biblical history, despite not being found in the Bible or related material. These include Ishmael as the founder of the Arabs, the connection of &quot;Semites&quot;, &quot;Hamites&quot; and &quot;Japhetites&quot; to the classical nations of the world, and the story of the siege of Masada.

=== Josephus&#x27;s original audience ===
Scholars debate about Josephus&#x27;s intended audience. For example, &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; could be written for Jews—&quot;a few scholars from Laqueur onward have suggested that Josephus must have written primarily for fellow Jews (if also secondarily for Gentiles). The most common motive suggested is repentance: in later life he felt so bad about the traitorous &quot;War&quot; that he needed to demonstrate … his loyalty to Jewish history, law and culture.&quot; However, Josephus&#x27;s &quot;countless incidental remarks explaining basic Judean language, customs and laws … assume a Gentile audience. He does not expect his first hearers to know anything about the laws or Judean origins.&quot; The issue of who would read this multi-volume work is unresolved. Other possible motives for writing &quot;Antiquities&quot; could be to dispel the misrepresentation of Jewish origins or as an apologetic to Greek cities of the Diaspora in order to protect Jews and to Roman authorities to garner their support for the Jews facing persecution.

=== Literary influence and translations ===
Josephus was a very popular writer with Christians in the 4th century and beyond as an independent source to the events before, during, and after the life of Jesus of Nazareth. Josephus was always accessible in the Greek-reading Eastern Mediterranean. His works were translated into Latin, but often in abbreviated form such as Pseudo-Hegesippus&#x27;s 4th century Latin version of &quot;The Jewish War&quot; (). Christian interest in &quot;The Jewish War&quot; was largely out of interest in the downfall of the Jews and the Second Temple, which was widely considered by Christians to be divine punishment for the crime of killing Jesus. Improvements in printing technology (the Gutenberg Press) led to his works receiving a number of new translations into the vernacular languages of Europe, generally based on the Latin versions. Only in 1544 did a version of the standard Greek text become available in French, edited by the Dutch humanist Arnoldus Arlenius. The first English translation, by Thomas Lodge, appeared in 1602, with subsequent editions appearing throughout the 17th century. The 1544 Greek edition formed the basis of the 1732 English translation by William Whiston, which achieved enormous popularity in the English-speaking world. It was often the book—after the Bible—that Christians most frequently owned. Whiston claimed that certain works by Josephus had a similar style to the Epistles of St. Paul. Later editions of the Greek text include that of Benedikt Niese, who made a detailed examination of all the available manuscripts, mainly from France and Spain. Henry St. John Thackeray and successors such as Ralph Marcus used Niese&#x27;s version for the Loeb Classical Library edition widely used today.

On the Jewish side, Josephus was far more obscure, as he was perceived as a traitor. Rabbinical writings for a millennium after his death (e.g. the Mishnah) almost never call out Josephus by name, although they sometimes tell parallel tales of the same events that Josephus narrated. An Italian Jew writing in the 10th century indirectly brought Josephus back to prominence among Jews: he authored the &quot;Yosippon&quot;, which paraphrases Pseudo-Hegesippus&#x27;s Latin version of &quot;The Jewish War&quot;, a Latin version of &quot;Antiquities&quot;, as well as other works. The epitomist also adds in his own snippets of history at times. Jews generally distrusted Christian translations of Josephus until the &quot;Haskalah&quot; (&quot;Jewish Enlightenment&quot;) in the 19th century, when sufficiently &quot;neutral&quot; vernacular language translations were made. Kalman Schulman finally created a Hebrew translation of the Greek text of Josephus in 1863, although many rabbis continued to prefer the Yosippon version. By the 20th century, Jewish attitudes toward Josephus had softened, as he gave the Jews a respectable place in classical history. Various parts of his work were reinterpreted as more inspiring and favorable to the Jews than the Renaissance translations by Christians had been. Notably, the last stand at Masada (described in &quot;The Jewish War&quot;), which past generations had deemed insane and fanatical, received a more positive reinterpretation as an inspiring call to action in this period.

The standard &quot;editio maior&quot; of the various Greek manuscripts is that of Benedictus Niese, published 1885–95. The text of &quot;Antiquities&quot; is damaged in some places. In the &quot;Life&quot;, Niese follows mainly manuscript P, but refers also to AMW and R. Henry St. John Thackeray for the Loeb Classical Library has a Greek text also mainly dependent on P. André Pelletier edited a new Greek text for his translation of &quot;Life&quot;. The ongoing Münsteraner Josephus-Ausgabe of Münster University will provide a new critical apparatus. Late Old Slavonic translations of the Greek also exist, but these contain a large number of Christian interpolations.

=== Evaluation as a military commander ===
Author Joseph Raymond calls Josephus &quot;the Jewish Benedict Arnold&quot; for betraying his own troops at Jotapata, while historian Mary Smallwood, in the introduction to the translation of &quot;The Jewish War&quot; by G. A. Williamson, writes:

== Historiography and Josephus ==

In the Preface to &quot;Jewish Wars&quot;, Josephus criticizes historians who misrepresent the events of the Jewish–Roman War, writing that &quot;they have a mind to demonstrate the greatness of the Romans, while they still diminish and lessen the actions of the Jews.&quot; Josephus states that his intention is to correct this method but that he &quot;will not go to the other extreme ... [and] will prosecute the actions of both parties with accuracy.&quot; Josephus confesses he will be unable to contain his sadness in transcribing these events; to illustrate this will have little effect on his historiography, Josephus suggests, &quot;But if any one be inflexible in his censures of me, let him attribute the facts themselves to the historical part, and the lamentations to the writer himself only.&quot;

His preface to &quot;Antiquities&quot; offers his opinion early on, saying, &quot;Upon the whole, a man that will peruse this history, may principally learn from it, that all events succeed well, even to an incredible degree, and the reward of felicity is proposed by God.&quot; After inserting this attitude, Josephus contradicts Berossus: &quot;I shall accurately describe what is contained in our records, in the order of time that belongs to them ... without adding any thing to what is therein contained, or taking away any thing therefrom.&quot; He notes the difference between history and philosophy by saying, &quot;[T]hose that read my book may wonder how it comes to pass, that my discourse, which promises an account of laws and historical facts, contains so much of philosophy.&quot;

In both works, Josephus emphasizes that accuracy is crucial to historiography. Louis H. Feldman notes that in &quot;Wars&quot;, Josephus commits himself to critical historiography, but in &quot;Antiquities&quot;, Josephus shifts to rhetorical historiography, which was the norm of his time. Feldman notes further that it is significant that Josephus called his later work &quot;Antiquities&quot; (literally, archaeology) rather than history; in the Hellenistic period, archaeology meant either &quot;history from the origins or archaic history.&quot; Thus, his title implies a Jewish peoples&#x27; history from their origins until the time he wrote. This distinction is significant to Feldman, because &quot;in ancient times, historians were expected to write in chronological order,&quot; while &quot;antiquarians wrote in a systematic order, proceeding topically and logically&quot; and included all relevant material for their subject. Antiquarians moved beyond political history to include institutions and religious and private life. Josephus does offer this wider perspective in &quot;Antiquities&quot;.

* ( 99) &quot;Life of Josephus&quot;, or &quot;Autobiography of Josephus&quot; (abbreviated &quot;Life&quot; or &quot;Vita&quot;)

=== &quot;The Jewish War&quot; ===

His first work in Rome was an account of the Jewish War, addressed to certain &quot;upper barbarians&quot;—usually thought to be the Jewish community in Mesopotamia—in his &quot;paternal tongue&quot; (&quot;War&quot; I.3), arguably the Western Aramaic language. In AD 78 he finished a seven-volume account in Greek known as the &quot;Jewish War&quot; (Latin &quot;Bellum Judaicum&quot; or &quot;De Bello Judaico&quot;). It starts with the period of the Maccabees and concludes with accounts of the fall of Jerusalem, and the subsequent fall of the fortresses of Herodion, Macharont and Masada and the Roman victory celebrations in Rome, the mopping-up operations, Roman military operations elsewhere in the empire and the uprising in Cyrene. Together with the account in his &quot;Life&quot; of some of the same events, it also provides the reader with an overview of Josephus&#x27;s own part in the events since his return to Jerusalem from a brief visit to Rome in the early 60s (&quot;Life&quot; 13–17).

In the wake of the suppression of the Jewish revolt, Josephus would have witnessed the marches of Titus&#x27;s triumphant legions leading their Jewish captives, and carrying treasures from the despoiled Temple in Jerusalem. It was against this background that Josephus wrote his &quot;War&quot;. He blames the Jewish War on what he calls &quot;unrepresentative and over-zealous fanatics&quot; among the Jews, who led the masses away from their traditional aristocratic leaders (like himself), with disastrous results. For example, Josephus writes that &quot;Simon [bar Giora] was a greater terror to the people than the Romans themselves.&quot; Josephus also blames some of the Roman governors of Judea, representing them as corrupt and incompetent administrators.

=== &quot;Jewish Antiquities&quot; ===

The next work by Josephus is his 21-volume &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, completed during the last year of the reign of the Emperor Flavius Domitian, around 93 or 94 AD. In expounding Jewish history, law and custom, he is entering into many philosophical debates current in Rome at that time. Again he offers an &quot;apologia&quot; for the antiquity and universal significance of the Jewish people. Josephus claims to be writing this history because he &quot;saw that others perverted the truth of those actions in their writings&quot;, those writings being the history of the Jews. In terms of some of his sources for the project, Josephus says that he drew from and &quot;interpreted out of the Hebrew Scriptures&quot; and that he was an eyewitness to the wars between the Jews and the Romans, which were earlier recounted in &quot;Jewish Wars&quot;.

He outlines Jewish history beginning with the creation, as passed down through Jewish historical tradition. Abraham taught science to the Egyptians, who, in turn, taught the Greeks. Moses set up a senatorial priestly aristocracy, which, like that of Rome, resisted monarchy. The great figures of the Tanakh are presented as ideal philosopher-leaders. He includes an autobiographical appendix defending his conduct at the end of the war when he cooperated with the Roman forces.

Louis H. Feldman outlines the difference between calling this work &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; instead of &quot;History of the Jews&quot;. Although Josephus says that he describes the events contained in &quot;Antiquities&quot; &quot;in the order of time that belongs to them,&quot; Feldman argues that Josephus &quot;aimed to organize [his] material systematically rather than chronologically&quot; and had a scope that &quot;ranged far beyond mere political history to political institutions, religious and private life.&quot;

=== &quot;Life of Flavius Josephus&quot; ===

An autobiographical text written by Josephus in approximately 94–99 CE – possibly as an appendix to his &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; (cf. Life 430) – where the author for the most part re-visits the events of the War and his tenure in Galilee as governor and commander, apparently in response to allegations made against him by Justus of Tiberias (cf. Life 336).

=== &quot;Against Apion&quot; ===

Josephus&#x27;s &quot;Against Apion&quot; is a two-volume defence of Judaism as classical religion and philosophy, stressing its antiquity, as opposed to what Josephus claimed was the relatively more recent tradition of the Greeks. Some anti-Judaic allegations ascribed by Josephus to the Greek writer Apion and myths accredited to Manetho are also addressed.

<text>Judith Blume (née Sussman; born February 12, 1938) is an American writer of children&#x27;s, young adult, and adult fiction. Blume began writing in 1959 and has published more than 26 novels. Among her best-known works are &quot;Are You There God? It&#x27;s Me, Margaret.&quot; (1970), &quot;Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing&quot; (1972), &quot;Deenie&quot; (1973), and &quot;Blubber&quot; (1974). Blume&#x27;s books have significantly contributed to children&#x27;s and young adult literature. She was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2023.

Blume was born and raised in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and graduated from New York University in 1961. As an attempt to entertain herself in her role as a homemaker, Blume began writing stories. Blume was one of the first young adult authors to write novels focused on such controversial topics as masturbation, menstruation, teen sex, birth control, and death. Her novels have sold over 82 million copies and have been translated into 32 languages.

Blume has won many awards for her writing, including the American Library Association (ALA)&#x27;s Margaret A. Edwards Award in 1996 for her contributions to young adult literature. She was recognized as a Library of Congress Living Legend and awarded the 2004 National Book Foundation medal for distinguished contribution to American letters.

Blume&#x27;s novels are popular and widely admired. They are praised for teaching children and young adults about their bodies. However, the mature topics in Blume&#x27;s books have generated criticism and controversy. The ALA has named Blume as one of the most frequently challenged authors of the 21st century. There have been several film adaptations of Blume&#x27;s novels, including &quot;Tiger Eyes&quot;, released in 2012 with Willa Holland starring as Davey, and &quot;Are You There God? It&#x27;s Me, Margaret.&quot;, released in 2023. A large collection of her papers are held at the Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library at Yale University.

The Peabody Award-winning documentary &quot;Judy Blume Forever&quot; chronicles Blume&#x27;s work.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Blume was born Judith Sussman on February 12, 1938, and raised in Elizabeth, New Jersey, the daughter of homemaker Esther Sussman (née Rosenfeld) and dentist Rudolph Sussman. She has a brother, David, who is five years older. Her family is Jewish. Blume witnessed hardships and death throughout her childhood. When she was in third grade, Blume&#x27;s older brother had a kidney infection that led Blume, her brother, and her mother to temporarily move to Miami Beach to help him recover for two years. Blume&#x27;s father stayed behind to continue working. Additionally, in 1951 and 1952, there were three airplane crashes in her hometown of Elizabeth (1951 Miami Airlines C-46 crash, American Airlines Flight 6780, and National Airlines Flight 101). 121 people died in these crashes, and Blume&#x27;s father, who was a dentist, helped to identify the unrecognizable remains. Blume says she &quot;buried&quot; these memories until she began writing her 2015 novel &quot;In the Unlikely Event&quot;, the plot of which revolves around the crashes. Throughout her childhood, Blume participated in many creative activities such as dance and piano. Blume describes her love of reading as a trait passed on by her parents. She has recalled spending much of her childhood creating stories in her head. Despite the love of stories, as a child Blume did not dream of being a writer.

Blume graduated from the all-girls&#x27; Battin High School in 1956, then enrolled in Boston University. A few weeks into the first semester, she was diagnosed with mononucleosis and took a brief leave from school. In 1959, Blume&#x27;s father died. Later that same year, on August 15, 1959, she married lawyer John M. Blume, whom she had met while a student at New York University. She graduated from New York University in 1961 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Education.

=== Adult life ===
After college, Blume gave birth to daughter Randy Lee Blume in 1961 and became a homemaker. In 1963, her son Lawrence Andrew Blume was born. Blume began writing when her children began nursery school. John M. Blume and Judy Blume were divorced in 1975. (John M. Blume later died on September 20, 2020.) Shortly after her separation, she met Thomas A. Kitchens, a physicist. The couple married in 1976, and moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico for two years for Kitchens&#x27; work. They divorced in 1978.

A few years later, a mutual friend introduced her to George Cooper, a former law professor turned non-fiction writer. Blume and Cooper were married in 1987. Cooper has one daughter from a previous marriage, Amanda, to whom Blume is very close.

In August 2012, Blume announced that she was diagnosed with breast cancer after undergoing a routine ultrasound before leaving for a five-week trip to Italy. Six weeks after her diagnosis, Blume underwent a mastectomy and breast reconstruction. Blume was cancer-free following this surgery and able to recover.

Randy Blume became a therapist with a sub-specialty in helping writers complete their works. She has one child, Elliot Kephart, who is credited with encouraging his grandmother, Judy Blume, to write the most recent &quot;Fudge&quot; books. Lawrence Blume is now a movie director, producer, and writer. As of 2021, Cooper and Blume resided in Key West.

===Career===
A lifelong avid reader, Blume first began writing through New York University courses when her children were attending preschool. Following two years of publisher rejections, Blume published her first book, &quot;The One in the Middle Is the Green Kangaroo&quot;, in 1969. A year later, Blume published her second book, &quot;Iggie&#x27;s House&quot; (1970), which was originally written as a story in &quot;Trailblazer&quot; magazine but then rewritten by Blume into a book. The decade that followed proved to be her most prolific, with 13 more books being published. Her third book was &quot;Are You There God? It&#x27;s Me, Margaret.&quot; (1970), which was a breakthrough best-seller and a trailblazing novel in young adult literature and established Blume as a leading voice in young adult literature. Some of Blume&#x27;s other novels during the decade include &quot;Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing&quot; (1972), &quot;Otherwise Known as Sheila the Great&quot; (1972), and &quot;Blubber&quot; (1974).

In 1975, Blume published the now frequently banned novel &quot;Forever&quot;, which was groundbreaking in young adult literature as the first novel to display teen sex as normal. Blume explained that she was inspired to write this novel when her daughter, 13 years old at the time, said she wanted to read a book where the characters have sex but do not die afterward. These novels tackled complex subjects such as family conflict, bullying, body image, and sexuality. Blume has expressed that she writes about these subjects, particularly sexuality, because it is what she believes children need to know about and was what she wondered about as a child.

After publishing novels for young children and teens, Blume tackled another genre—adult reality and death. Her novels &quot;Wifey&quot; (1978) and &quot;Smart Women&quot; (1983) reached the top of &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. &quot;Wifey&quot; became a bestseller with over 4 million copies sold. Blume&#x27;s third adult novel, &quot;Summer Sisters&quot; (1998), was widely praised and sold more than three million copies. Despite its popularity, &quot;Summer Sisters&quot; (1998) faced a lot of criticism for its sexual content and inclusion of homosexual themes. Several of Blume&#x27;s books appear on the list of top all-time bestselling children&#x27;s books. As of 2020, her books have sold over 82 million copies and they have been translated into 32 languages. Although Blume has not published a novel since 2015 (&quot;In the Unlikely Event&quot;), she continues to write. In October 2017, Yale University acquired Blume&#x27;s archive, which included some unpublished early work.

As well as writing, Blume has been an activist against the banning of books in the United States. In the 1980s, when her books started facing censorship and controversy, she began reaching out to other writers, as well as teachers and librarians, to join the fight against censorship. This led Blume to join the National Coalition Against Censorship which aims to protect the freedom to read. As of 2020, Blume is still a board member for the National Coalition Against Censorship. She is also the founder and trustee of The Kids Fund, a charitable and educational foundation. Blume serves on the board for other organizations such as, the Authors Guild; the Society of Children&#x27;s Book Writers and Illustrators; the Key West Literary Seminar; and the National Coalition Against Censorship.&quot; In 2018, Blume and her husband opened a non-profit book store called Books &amp; Books located in Key West.

Blume calls herself a &quot;liberal Democrat.&quot;

== Reception ==
Blume&#x27;s novels have been read by millions and have flourished throughout generations. The element in her work readers are said to love most is Blume&#x27;s openness and honesty regarding issues like divorce, sexuality, puberty, and bullying. Her first-person narrative writing has gained positive appraisal for its relatability and its ability to discuss difficult subjects without judgment or harshness. Following the publishing of &quot;Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret&quot; (1970), Blume received many letters from young girls telling her how much they loved the book and identified with Margaret. Female novelists have praised Blume for her “taboo-trampling” literature that left readers feeling like they learned something about their bodies from reading her books. For example, &quot;Deenie&quot; (1973) explained masturbation and &quot;Forever&quot; (1975) taught young women about losing their virginity. Blume&#x27;s children&#x27;s books have also been praised for their delicate way of portraying the hardships that kids can face at a young age. &quot;It’s Not the End of the World&quot; (1972) helped many kids understand divorce and the Fudge book series explored the various aspects of loving siblings despite the rivalry.

Blume&#x27;s novels have received much criticism and controversy. Parents, librarians, book critics, and political groups have wanted her books to be banned. When her first books were published in the 1970s, Blume has recalled facing little censorship. Since 1980, Blume&#x27;s novels have been a central topic of controversy in young adult literature. Critics of Blume&#x27;s novels say that she places too much emphasis on the physical and sexual sides of growing up, ignoring the development of morals and emotional maturity. Five of Blume&#x27;s books were included in the American Library Association (ALA) list of the top 100 most banned books of the 1990s, with &quot;Forever&quot; (1975) in seventh place. &quot;Forever&quot; is censored for its inclusion of teen sex and birth control. Blume recalls that the principal of her children&#x27;s elementary school would not put &quot;Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret&quot; in the library because the story involves menstruation. Conservative and religious groups continuously attempt to ban &quot;Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret&quot; for the novel&#x27;s portrayal of a young girl going through puberty claiming that it violates certain religious views. Blume&#x27;s children&#x27;s novels have also been criticized for these reasons, especially &quot;Blubber&quot; (1974), which many believed sent the message to readers that kids could do wrong and not face punishment.

== Awards and honors ==
Judy Blume has won more than 90 literary awards, including three lifetime achievement awards in the United States. In 1994, she received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. The ALA Margaret A. Edwards Award recognizes one author who has made significant contributions to young adult literature. Blume won the annual award in 1996 and the ALA considered her book &quot;Forever,&quot; published in 1975, was groundbreaking for its honest portrayal of high school seniors in love for the first time. In April 2000, the Library of Congress named her to its &quot;Living Legends&quot; in the Writers and Artists category for her significant contributions to America&#x27;s cultural heritage. Blume received an honorary doctor of arts degree from Mount Holyoke College and was the main speaker at their annual commencement ceremony in 2003. In 2004 she received the annual Distinguished Contribution to American Letters Medal of the National Book Foundation for her enrichment of American literary heritage. In 2009, the National Coalition Against Censorship (NCAC) honored Blume for her lifelong commitment to free speech and her courage to battle censorship in literature. Blume also received the 2017 E.B. White Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters for lifetime achievement in children&#x27;s literature. In 2020, Blume was named an Honoree for Distinguished Service to the Literary Community by the Authors Guild Foundation.

==Media adaptations==
The first media adaptation of Blume&#x27;s novels was the production of a TV film based on Blume&#x27;s novel &quot;Forever&quot; that premiered on CBS in 1978. &quot;Forever&quot; is the story of two teenagers in high school, Katherine Danziger and Michael Wagner, who fall in love for the first time. The film starred Stephanie Zimbalist as Katherine Danziger and Dean Butler as Michael Wagner. A decade later, in 1988, Blume and her son wrote and executive produced a small film adaptation of &quot;Otherwise Known as Sheila the Great&quot;. The film was later shown on ABC. In 1995, a Fudge TV series was produced based on Blume&#x27;s novel &quot;Fudge-a-Mania.&quot; The show ran from 1995 to 1997 with the first season aired on ABC and the second on CBS. The series starred Jake Richardson as Peter Warren Hatcher, the storyteller, and Luke Tarsitano as Farley Drexel &quot;Fudge&quot; Hatcher.

In 2012, Blume&#x27;s 1981 novel &quot;Tiger Eyes&quot; was adapted into a film version. This was the first of Blume&#x27;s novels to be turned into a theatrical feature film. &quot;Tiger Eyes&quot; is the story of a teenage girl, Davey, who struggles to cope with the sudden death of her father, Adam Wexler. The screenplay was co-written by Blume and her son, Lawrence Blume, who was also the director. &quot;Tiger Eyes&quot; stars Willa Holland as Davey and Amy Jo Johnson as Gwen Wexler.

Blume is the subject of the 2018 song &quot;Judy Blume&quot; by Amanda Palmer. Thematically, the song explains to the listener Blume&#x27;s role in Palmer&#x27;s adolescent life. The song explains Blume&#x27;s books as influential in Palmer&#x27;s understanding of intimate and female-centered subjects such as puberty, menstruation, and the male gaze, and universal subjects like molestation, eating disorders, poverty, grief, and parental divorce.

She is the subject of the Peabody Award-winning documentary &quot;Judy Blume Forever&quot;, which premiered at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival.

&quot;Are You There God? It&#x27;s Me, Margaret.&quot; was released as a feature film in 2023.

<text>Joel Marangella is an American oboist who has performed in concert with many of the world&#x27;s leading orchestras. A founding member of the Speculum Musicae, he was the principal oboist for the West Australian Symphony Orchestra, and a founding member of the New Music Ensemble.

==Biography==
Marangella was born in Washington, D.C., and first studied in France with Fernand Eché at the Conservatoire National de Musique d’Orléans, and later with Pierre Pierlot, Maurice Bourgue, and Etienne Baudo at the Conservatoire de Paris. He pursued further studies at the Juilliard School in New York City, earning both bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in music. While there he was a member of the Juilliard Ensemble under the direction of Luciano Berio, performing with them not only in New York but also the University of Hawaii and Dartmouth College.

In 1971 Marangella won the Young Concert Artists International Auditions which led to his recital debut at Carnegie Hall. That same year he helped form the Speculum Musicae. He soon began to perform with notable music groups throughout the United States, notably playing the American premiere of Hans Werner Henze’s &quot;Double Concerto&quot; with the National Symphony Orchestra at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. He has also appeared at several chamber music festivals, including the Spoleto Festival of the Two Worlds in Italy.

Marangella has served as principal oboist for numerous ballet orchestras throughout his career. Former posts include Principal Oboe with the New York City Ballet, the American Ballet Theatre, the Bolshoi Ballet, the Royal Ballet, the Royal Swedish Ballet, and the Royal Danish Ballet.

More recently Marangella&#x27;s career has been centered in Australia. He has appeared as a soloist for all the major Australian orchestras, and has been Guest Principal Oboe with the Sydney Symphony.

<text>Sir John Anthony Pople (31 October 1925 – 15 March 2004) was a British theoretical chemist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Walter Kohn in 1998 for his development of computational methods in quantum chemistry. 

==Early life and education==
Pople was born in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, and attended the Bristol Grammar School. He won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1943. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1946. Between 1945 and 1947 he worked at the Bristol Aeroplane Company. He then returned to the University of Cambridge and was awarded his PhD in mathematics in 1951 on lone pair electrons.

==Career==
After obtaining his PhD, he was a research fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge and then from 1954 a lecturer in the mathematics faculty at Cambridge. In 1958, he moved to the National Physical Laboratory, near London as head of the new basics physics division. He moved to the United States of America in 1964, where he lived the rest of his life, though he retained British citizenship. Pople considered himself more of a mathematician than a chemist, but theoretical chemists consider him one of the most important of their number. In 1964 he moved to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he had experienced a sabbatical in 1961 to 1962. In 1993 he moved to Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where he was Trustees Professor of Chemistry until his death.

==Research==
Pople&#x27;s major scientific contributions were in four different areas:

===Statistical mechanics of water===
Pople&#x27;s early paper on the statistical mechanics of water, according to Michael J. Frisch, &quot;remained the standard for many years&quot;. This was his thesis topic for his PhD at Cambridge supervised by John Lennard-Jones.

===Nuclear magnetic resonance===
In the early days of nuclear magnetic resonance he studied the underlying theory, and in 1959 he co-authored the textbook &quot;High Resolution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance&quot; with W.G. Schneider and H.J. Bernstein.

===Semi-empirical theory===
He made major contributions to the theory of approximate molecular orbital (MO) calculations, starting with one identical to the one developed by Rudolph Pariser and Robert G. Parr on pi electron systems, and now called the Pariser–Parr–Pople method. Subsequently, he developed the methods of Complete Neglect of Differential Overlap (CNDO) (in 1965) and Intermediate Neglect of Differential Overlap (INDO) for approximate MO calculations on three-dimensional molecules, and other developments in computational chemistry. In 1970 he and David Beveridge coauthored the book &quot;Approximate Molecular Orbital Theory&quot; describing these methods.

===Ab initio electronic structure theory===
Pople pioneered the development of more sophisticated computational methods, called ab initio quantum chemistry methods, that use basis sets of either Slater type orbitals or Gaussian orbitals to model the wave function. While in the early days these calculations were extremely expensive to perform, the advent of high speed microprocessors has made them much more feasible today. He was instrumental in the development of one of the most widely used computational chemistry packages, the Gaussian suite of programs, including coauthorship of the first version, Gaussian 70. One of his most important original contributions is the concept of a model chemistry whereby a method is rigorously evaluated across a range of molecules. His research group developed the quantum chemistry composite methods such as Gaussian-1 (G1) and Gaussian-2 (G2). In 1991, Pople stopped working on Gaussian and several years later he developed (with others) the Q-Chem computational chemistry program. Prof. Pople&#x27;s departure from Gaussian, along with the subsequent banning of many prominent scientists, including himself, from using the software gave rise to considerable controversy among the quantum chemistry community.

The Gaussian molecular orbital methods were described in the 1986 book &quot;Ab initio molecular orbital theory&quot; by Warren Hehre, Leo Radom, Paul v.R. Schleyer and Pople.

==Awards and honours==
Pople received the Wolf Prize in Chemistry in 1992, and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1998. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1961. He was made a Knight Commander (KBE) of the Order of the British Empire in 2003. He was a founding member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science.

An IT room and a scholarship are named after him at Bristol Grammar School, as is a supercomputer at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center.

==Personal life==
Pople married Joy Bowers in 1952 and was married until her death from cancer in 2002. Pople died of liver cancer in Chicago in 2004. He was survived by his daughter Hilary, and sons Adrian, Mark and Andrew. In accordance with his wishes, Pople&#x27;s Nobel Medal was given to Carnegie Mellon University by his family on 5 October 2009.
