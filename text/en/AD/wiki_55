<text>Sara Jane Olson (born Kathleen Ann Soliah on January 16, 1947) is an American far-left activist who was a member of the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in 1975. The group disbanded and she was a fugitive for decades before being arrested. In 2001, she pleaded guilty to attempted murder related to a failed bombing plot. In 2003 she pleaded guilty to second-degree murder related to the death of a customer during a botched bank robbery the SLA committed in California. Known then as Soliah, she was also accused of helping a group hide Patty Hearst, a kidnapped newspaper heiress, in 1974. After being federally indicted in 1976, Soliah was a wanted fugitive for several decades. She lived for periods in Zimbabwe and the U.S. states of Washington and Minnesota.

While in Minnesota, she legally changed her name to Sara Jane Olson, married, and had a family. Arrested in 1999, she pleaded guilty in 2001 to two counts of possessing explosives with intent to murder, and in 2003 to second-degree murder, both stemming from her SLA activities in the 1970s. She was sentenced to 14 years in prison. She was mistakenly released for five days in March 2008 due to an error made in calculating her parole and was rearrested. She was released on parole on March 17, 2009.

On November 4, 2020, Olson was arrested along with several others for blocking Interstate 94 in Minneapolis during a protest.

==Early life and education==
Kathleen Soliah was born on January 16, 1947, in Fargo, North Dakota, while her family was living in Barnesville, Minnesota. When she was eight, her conservative Lutheran family relocated to Southern California. Soliah attended the University of California, Santa Barbara, where she initially majored in English. While a student at university, she participated in theater and was cast in a production of &quot;J.B.&quot;

==Symbionese Liberation Army==
After graduating with a bachelor of arts degree in theater, Soliah moved to Berkeley, California, with her boyfriend, James Kilgore.

She met Angela Atwood at an acting audition where they both won lead roles. They became inseparable during the play&#x27;s run. Atwood tried to sponsor Soliah as a member of the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), a leftist group she had joined. Soliah, Kilgore, and Soliah&#x27;s brother Steve and sister Josephine followed the SLA closely without joining.

Atwood and five other core members of the SLA, including leader Donald DeFreeze, were killed in May 1974 during a standoff and shootout with police at a house near Watts, Los Angeles. They were being pursued for armed robbery of banks, the November 1973 murder of Oakland school superintendent Marcus Foster, and the 1974 kidnapping of heiress Patty Hearst.

The Soliahs organized memorial rallies for the SLA victims, including one in Berkeley&#x27;s Willard Park (called Ho Chi Minh park by activists), where Soliah spoke in support of Atwood and was covertly filmed by the FBI.

She said that SLA members had been: 
Soliah asserted that Atwood &quot;was a truly revolutionary woman ... among the first white women to fight so righteously for their beliefs and to die for what they believed in&quot;.

Founding SLA member and fugitive Emily Harris visited Soliah, who was working at a bookstore. Soliah later recalled, &quot;I was glad she was alive. I expected them to be killed at any time.&quot; She felt sorry for the group and agreed to help the remaining members hide from the police and FBI. She assisted them by procuring supplies for their San Francisco hideout, and birth certificates of dead infants that could be reused for false identification.

===Crocker National Bank robbery and Myrna Opsahl murder===
On April 21, 1975, SLA members robbed the Crocker National Bank in Carmichael, California. In the process they killed Myrna Opsahl, a mother of four depositing money for her church.

Patty Hearst, who had acted as getaway driver during the crime, later provided the information that led police to implicate the SLA in the robbery and murder. She identified Soliah as one of the robbers. According to Hearst, Soliah kicked a pregnant teller in the abdomen, leading to her suffering a miscarriage.

Police later searched Soliah&#x27;s room at the SLA safehouse on Precita Avenue in San Francisco. They found several rounds of 9 mm ammunition on the floor and in a 9 mm Browning Hi-Power semi-automatic pistol in Soliah&#x27;s dresser drawer. Manufacturing marks appeared to match similar cartridges found in Opsahl&#x27;s body during the autopsy. In 2002, new forensics technology allowed police to link these shells definitively to those found at Crocker Bank; they charged former members of SLA, including Soliah, with the crime. Prosecutor Michael Latin said that Soliah was tied to the crime through fingerprints, a palm print, and handwriting evidence. The palm print was found on a garage door where the SLA kept a getaway car.

===Los Angeles Police Department bombs===
On August 21, 1975, a bomb that came close to detonating was discovered where a Los Angeles Police Department patrol car had been parked earlier in front of an International House of Pancakes restaurant. After the bomb was discovered, all Los Angeles police were ordered to search under their cars and another bomb was found in front of a police station about a mile away. Soliah was accused of planting the bombs in an attempt to avenge the SLA members who had died in 1974 in the shootout with LA police.

The pipe bombs were rigged to detonate as the patrol cars drove away. One police officer present that day described the first bomb as one of &quot;the most dangerous pipe bombs he had ever seen&quot; and said: 
Soliah and five other SLA members were indicted in 1976 for setting the police bombs. She vanished before the trial could start. When Soliah was brought to trial at the turn of the century, prosecutors did not believe the evidence against her was a &quot;slam dunk&quot; but did believe it was enough to convince a jury of her guilt. Two witnesses who testified in the 1976 grand jury indictment had died by the time Soliah (now known as Sara Jane Olson) was tried. At the grand jury, a plumber who had sold materials used in the bomb had picked Soliah out of a lineup as one of the buyers. A bomb expert had said the explosive could have been built in Soliah&#x27;s apartment. Police could not identify any fingerprints on the devices other than those of the officers who had disarmed them. But Soliah&#x27;s fingerprint, handwriting, and signature were identified on a letter sent to order a fuse that could only be used for bomb-making. Components matching those used in the police car bombs were found in a locked closet at the Precita Avenue house where Soliah lived with the other remaining members of the SLA.

==Underground life, capture, and prosecution==

In February 1976, a grand jury indicted Soliah in the bombing case. Soliah went underground and became a fugitive for 23 years.

She moved to Minnesota, having assumed the alias Sara Jane Olson. Olson is a common surname in the state because of the large Scandinavian-American population. In 1980, she married physician Gerald Frederick &quot;Fred&quot; Peterson, with whom she had three daughters.

Olson and Peterson also lived in Zimbabwe, where Peterson worked for a British medical missionary group. After their return, they settled in Saint Paul, Minnesota, where Olson picked up her acting career. She was active in Saint Paul on community issues. Her husband described the family as interested in progressive social causes.

On March 3, 1999, and again on May 15, 1999, Soliah was profiled on the &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; television program. After a tip generated by the show, she was arrested on June 16, 1999. Soliah was charged in the police bomb case with conspiracy to commit murder, possession of explosives, explosion, and attempt to ignite an explosive with intent to murder.

Shortly after her arrest, Soliah legally changed her name to Sara Jane Olson. She also published a cookbook, &quot;Serving Time: America&#x27;s Most Wanted Recipes&quot;.

On October 31, 2001, she accepted a plea bargain and pleaded guilty to two counts of possessing explosives with intent to murder. As part of a plea bargain, the other charges were dropped.

===Plea controversy===
Immediately after entering the plea, Olson told reporters that she was innocent. She said that she had taken a plea bargain because, due to the political climate after the September 11 attacks, she believed that an accused bomber could not receive a fair jury trial:
It became clear to me that the incident would have a remarkable effect on the outcome of this trial ... the effect was probably going to be negative. That&#x27;s really what governed this decision, not the truth or honesty, but what was probably in my best interests and the interests of my family.

Angered by Olson&#x27;s announcement that she had lied in court, Superior Court Judge Larry Fidler ordered another hearing on November 6. There he asked her several times if she was guilty of the charges. Olson replied, &quot;I want to make it clear, Your Honor, that I did not make that bomb. I did not possess that bomb. I did not plant that bomb. But under the concept of aiding and abetting, I plead guilty.&quot;

On November 13, Olson filed a motion requesting to withdraw her guilty plea, acknowledging that she understood the judge when he read the charges against her. Rather, she said: 
===Sentencing in explosives charges===
On December 3, 2001, Judge Fidler offered to let Olson testify under oath about her role in the case. She refused. He said, &quot;I took those pleas twice ... were you lying to me then or are you lying to me now?&quot; and denied her request to withdraw her plea.

Observers expected her to serve three to five years, but on January 18, 2002, she was sentenced to two consecutive 10-years-to-life terms. At Soliah&#x27;s 2002 sentencing hearing on the bombing, police officer John Hall, who had been in the car parked over the bomb, talked about a little girl who stood feet away with her family:
Fidler said that under California law, the Board of Prison Terms could later reduce the sentence. Olson&#x27;s lawyers asserted that due to discrepancies between 1970s laws and current California laws, Olson would most likely serve five years, which could be reduced to two years for good behavior. The Board of Prison Terms did later change the sentence.

At Olson&#x27;s sentencing hearing, her teenage daughter Leila, her pastor, and her husband spoke in her defense. Her mother testified on the stand that Olson had never been part of the SLA. She criticized prosecutors and police, who she asserted had harassed the family.

===Sentencing in Opsahl murder===
On January 16, 2002, first-degree murder charges for the killing of Myrna Opsahl were filed against Olson and four other SLA members: Emily Harris, Bill Harris, Michael Bortin (who had married Olson&#x27;s sister Josephine), and James Kilgore, who remained a fugitive. Judge Fidler arraigned Olson on the murder charges immediately following her sentencing hearing on January 18 for the explosives case. Olson pleaded not guilty to that charge at the time.

On November 7, 2002, along with the other three defendants, Olson pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of second-degree murder. On February 14, 2003, she was sentenced to the maximum term allowed under her plea bargain, six years, to be served concurrently with the 14-year sentence she was already serving.

==Incarceration and release==
The state Board of Prison Terms had scrapped Olson&#x27;s original sentence in October 2002 in exchange for a longer 14-year sentence, saying Olson&#x27;s crimes had the potential for great violence and targeted multiple victims. She appealed, and in July 2004, a judge said there was &quot;no analysis&quot; of how the state Board of Prison Terms had decided 14 years was appropriate and threw the sentence out. Her sentence was converted to five years and four months.

The state appealed and an appeals court panel restored her full 14-year sentence as of April 12, 2007. It ruled that a lower court did not follow procedure when it allowed Olson to appeal.

Olson served her time at the Central California Women&#x27;s Facility in Chowchilla. Her custody status was &quot;Close A&quot;, which is reserved for inmates requiring the most supervision. This status limited her privileges and required that she be counted seven times a day. It also prevented her from seeking relocation to a facility closer to her home. David Nickerson, Olson&#x27;s attorney, said that her status reflected the Department of Corrections&#x27; view that she was a potential flight risk.

Olson&#x27;s husband and three daughters continued to support her during her imprisonment; they took turns visiting her frequently in Chowchilla.

In a 2007 interview with &quot;Marie Claire&quot; magazine (published by Hearst Corporation), Olson&#x27;s 23-year-old daughter Emily Peterson dismissed her mother&#x27;s radical past with the SLA. She said of her mother, &quot;She lived in Berkeley. It was kind of normal... I always tell people she wasn&#x27;t a terrorist. She was an urban guerrilla.&quot; Olson never publicly expressed remorse or regret for her actions.

===Release from prison and rearrest===
Olson was released on parole from the Central California Women&#x27;s Facility in Chowchilla on March 17, 2008. For five days, she stayed at her mother&#x27;s home in Palmdale and spent some time hiking with her husband.

On March 21, 2008, she was rearrested when it was decided that she had been mistakenly released a year early from prison due to a miscalculation by the parole board. Her attorney claimed that the action was politically motivated. Olson was taken back into custody by the California Department of Corrections and placed in the California Institution for Women in Corona for another year.

===Release and parole===
After serving seven years in prison, about half her sentence, Olson was released on March 17, 2009, to serve her parole in Minnesota. Police unions in both Minnesota and California protested the arrangement, saying that they believed her parole should be served in California, where her crimes were committed.

In a letter to California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty also protested Olson being allowed to return to Minnesota.

==Interstate 94 protest==

Years after her return to Minnesota, on November 4, 2020, Olson participated in a protest in Minneapolis called by the National Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression after the U.S. presidential election. Olson and several others marched onto Interstate 94, where they were met with a response from the Minneapolis Police Department and Minnesota State Patrol. Several hundred protesters were arrested. 

Olson was originally charged with creating a public nuisance, but the charge was lowered to a petty misdemeanor. She rejected a plea deal offered to most of the demonstrators. On December 3, 2021, after a trial by a judge, she was convicted and fined $378. Olson appealed the conviction on the grounds that the state lacked evidence to find her guilty of using a controlled-access highway as a pedestrian. On November 21, 2022, the judge in the appeal case said that the circumstances of the events did not support Olson&#x27;s innocence and denied the appeal.

==Personal life==
Soliah grew up in Palmdale, California, the daughter of Norwegian-American parents Elsie Soliah (née Engstrøm) and Martin Soliah, an English teacher and coach at Palmdale High School.

<text>KRC (Kent Recursive Calculator) is a lazy functional language developed by David Turner from November 1979 to October 1981 based on SASL, with pattern matching, guards and ZF expressions (now more usually called list comprehensions). Two implementations of KRC were written: David Turner&#x27;s original one in BCPL running on EMAS, and Simon J. Croft&#x27;s later one in C under Unix, and KRC was the main language used for teaching functional programming at the University of Kent at Canterbury (UK) from 1982 to 1985.

The direct successor to KRC is Miranda, which includes a polymorphic type discipline based on that of Milner&#x27;s ML.

<text>Kremvax was originally a fictitious Usenet site at the Kremlin, named like the then large number of Usenet VAXen with names of the form &quot;foo&quot;vax. Kremvax was announced on April 1, 1984, in a posting ostensibly originated there by Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko. The posting was actually forged by Piet Beertema of CWI (in Amsterdam) as an April Fool&#x27;s prank—&quot;because the notion that Usenet might ever penetrate the Iron Curtain seemed so totally absurd at the time&quot;.

Other fictitious sites mentioned in the hoax were moskvax and kgbvax. The actual origin of the email was mcvax, one of the first European sites on the internet.

Six years later, Usenet was joined by demos.su, the first genuine site based in Moscow. Some readers needed convincing that the postings from it were not just another prank. Vadim Antonov, the senior programmer at Demos and the major poster from there until mid-1991, was quite aware of all this, and referred to it frequently in his own postings. Antonov later arranged to have the domain&#x27;s gateway site named kremvax.demos.su, turning fiction into truth and, according to one account, &quot;demonstrating that the hackish sense of humor transcends cultural barriers&quot;.

During the mid-1980s, Usenet users were not aware of the official X.25 computer connections between USSR and other countries. The X.25 connections had existed since 1980, primarily via VNIIPAS and Academset to Soviet bloc countries and Austrian hosts at IIASA and IAEA. In 1983, the &quot;San Francisco Moscow Teleport (SFMT)&quot; venture was created to maintain USSR-American digital connections via VNIIPAS with its own Usenet analogues later known as &quot;Sovamnet&quot; (&quot;Soviet-American net&quot;).

In 1992, the company Sun Microsystems, a commercial rival to VAX, gifted an own-made server to pioneer Soviet commercial network RELCOM. The company demanded that the server was named &quot;KremlSun&quot;, an allusion to then-legendary &quot;Kremvax&quot;, and made a root DNS server for the .su domain. The conditions were met, and the server became one of the initial devices when forming the Moscow Internet Exchange, since then the largest Russian Internet exchange point.

<text>KRL is a knowledge representation language, developed by Daniel G. Bobrow and Terry Winograd while at Xerox PARC and Stanford University, respectively. It is a frame-based language. 
KRL was an attempt to produce a language which was nice to read and write for the engineers who had to write programs in it, processed like human memory, so you could have realistic AI programs, had an underlying semantics which was firmly grounded like logic languages, all in one, all in one language. And I think it - again, in hindsight - it just bogged down under the weight of trying to satisfy all those things at once.

<text>John-F.-Kennedy-Platz (John F. Kennedy Square), formerly Rudolph-Wilde-Platz, in the Schöneberg section of Berlin is the square in front of the former city hall of West Berlin (Rathaus Schöneberg). It was here, on June 26, 1963, that US President John F. Kennedy gave his famous speech to the Berliners, in which he stated: &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner&quot;. The square was renamed John-F.-Kennedy-Platz on 25 November 1963, three days after Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, and a large plaque dedicated to Kennedy, mounted on wall next to the entrance to the city hall, was unveiled one year after Kennedy&#x27;s speech.

<text>Kyoto Common Lisp (KCL) is an implementation of Common Lisp by Taichi Yuasa and Masami Hagiya, written in C to run under Unix-like operating systems. KCL is compiled to ANSI C. It conforms to Common Lisp as described in the 1984 first edition of Guy Steele&#x27;s book &quot;Common Lisp the Language&quot; and is available under a licence agreement.

KCL was implemented from scratch, outside of the standard committee, solely on the basis of the specification. It was one of the first Common Lisp implementations ever, and exposed a number of holes and mistakes in the specification that had gone unnoticed.

==Derived software==

* Austin Kyoto Common Lisp (AKCL) is a collection of ports, bug fixes, and performance improvements to KCL made by William Schelter. AKCL has been ported to a range of Unix workstations.
* GNU Common Lisp (GCL) was derived from AKCL.
* Embeddable Common-Lisp (ECL) was derived from KCL.
* ManKai Common Lisp (MKCL) was derived from ECL.
* Commercial versions of Kyoto Common Lisp were Ibuki Common Lisp and Delphi Common Lisp.

<text>Keflavík (pronounced , meaning &quot;Driftwood Bay&quot;) is a town in the Reykjanes region in southwest Iceland. It is included in the municipality of Reykjanesbær whose population as of 2016 is 15,129.

In 1995, Keflavík merged with nearby Njarðvík and Hafnir to form the municipality of Reykjanesbær. Keflavík International Airport, the country&#x27;s largest airport (serving nearby Reykjavík) is adjacent to the town.

== History ==
Keflavík was founded by Scottish entrepreneurs and engineers in the 16th century, and developed on account of its fishing and fish processing industry. 

In the 1940s an airport was built next to the town by the United States military, which served as an important refueling stop for trans-Atlantic flights, especially during World War II.

During the Cold War, Naval Air Station Keflavik played an important role in monitoring marine and submarine traffic from the Norwegian and Greenland seas into the Atlantic Ocean. Forces from the United States Air Force were added to provide radar monitoring, fighter intercept, in-flight refueling, and aerial/marine rescue. With increasing ranges for aircraft and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the base became less important, and the last U.S. personnel were withdrawn in 2006.

Within Iceland, Keflavík was renowned as a rich source of musicians during the 1960s and 1970s, and came to be known as &quot;bítlabærinn&quot; or &quot;The Beatle Town&quot;.

== Geography and climate==
The local geography is dominated by fields of basalt rubble, interspersed with a few hardy plants and mosses.

The climate of Keflavík is subpolar oceanic (Köppen: &quot;Cfc&quot;) with cool summers and moderately cold winters. There is not a truly dry month but June is the month that gets the least amount of precipitation. Winter high temperatures average above the freezing mark, and summer high temperatures are cool to mild. The warmest month on average is July with an average high of and the coldest is January with an average high of .
==Sport==
The town is represented in sports by Íþrótta- og ungmennafélag Keflavíkur.

==In popular culture==
The former NATO military base Naval Air Station Keflavik is used as a setting for an important story line in Tom Clancy&#x27;s novel &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;. Clancy speculated about the base, the geography, local flora, and the station equipment.

NAS Keflavik is also a central setting in Icelandic writer Arnaldur Indriðason&#x27;s 1999 mystery &quot;Napóleonsskjölin&quot;, translated into English in 2011 as &quot;Operation Napoleon&quot;.

<doc id="17249" wikidata="Q11315112" url="?curid=17249" title="James &quot;Kibo&quot; Parry">
<text>James Parry (born July 13, 1967), commonly known by his nickname and username Kibo , is a Usenetter known for his sense of humor, various surrealist net pranks, an absurdly long signature, and a machine-assisted knack for &quot;&quot;: joining any thread in which &quot;kibo&quot; was mentioned. His exploits have earned him a multitude of enthusiasts, who celebrate him as the head deity of the parody religion &quot;Kibology&quot;, centered on the humor newsgroup alt.religion.kibology.

==Background==
James Parry grew up and lived in Scotia, New York. He showed early computing skills, such as being able to open up and reprogram ROM video game cartridges such as those for the Atari 2600, but was more interested in graphics and artistic pursuits. In this vein, he was initially a computer engineering major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, New York, but then moved to Boston, Massachusetts in 1990 and attended Emerson College, where he studied videography and graphic design. At that time, he also worked as a typeface designer and for the world.std.com internet service provider. He developed several fonts in use today. One of his better-known works is the typography for Philip K. Dick&#x27;s novel &quot;Gather Yourselves Together&quot;.

==Growing fame==
In the early 1990s, as public awareness grew of the Internet and Usenet, Parry received publicity, including a cover story in &quot;Wired&quot; magazine and mentions in &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;. He became known on Usenet for grepping all occurrences of the term &quot;Kibo&quot;—whether intended to refer to Kibo himself or not—and replying, often in a fanciful manner. A typical exchange:

 Mary Rose Campbell wrote:
 &gt;At CMU, we also have something called Gray Matter in the center of Skibo
 &gt;(our student union substitute). It&#x27;s a bunch of shapes, walls, holes,
 &gt;and steps covered with the same dark gray carpet that&#x27;s on the floor.
 &gt;It looks like a giant cat toy.
 Actually, it&#x27;s a life-size model of S. Kibo himself, my great great
 grand-uncle. This was before he evolved past the &#x27;giant metazoic
 amoeba&#x27; stage a few aeons ago. Now he&#x27;s a trilobite.
 – K.

This practice became known as &quot;kibozing&quot;. In 2006, Parry estimated that he had posted &quot;an average of 20 articles a week to alt.religion.kibology during the past 15 years, probably about 500 words of original content per article, that&#x27;s... seven point eight words. Equivalent to about 100 books.&quot;

He is perhaps best known on Usenet for his famous (or infamous) &quot;Happynet Proclamation&quot; (1992), circulated to many newsgroups, some absurdly unrelated, which satirized the endless flamewars on the network, with Parry posing as a godlike being issuing an edict full of in-jokes and humor targets that claimed to unify all news into one glorious totality, &quot;happynet&quot;. In the article, Kibo claimed that:
 ********* HAPPYNET: THE NET THAT&#x27;S HAPPIER THAN YOU! *********
 UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE ALL-WISE LEADER KIBO,
 THE NEW NETWORK SHALL BE ORGANIZED THUSLY:
 Three hierarchies encompassing ALL HUMAN DISCOURSE.
 =&gt; nonbozo.*
 =&gt; bozo.*
 =&gt; megabozo.*
 Existing groups will be moved into the new organization scheme, resulting
 in nonbozo.news.announce.newusers, bozo.rec.pets, megabozo.talk.bizarre,
 nonbozo.comp.virus, bozo.alt.sex, megabozo.alt.fan.lemurs, bozo.postmodern,
 etc., as determined by scientific measurements of the bozosity of the
 groups, measured by Leader Kibo&#x27;s Council On Scientific Bozosity and the
 faculty of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (Troy, NY), world leaders in
 bozosity assessment.
 It is estimated that the breakdown will be thus:
 1.0000% nonbozo.*
 90.0000% bozo.*
 9.0000% megabozo.* (Computations courtesy of Bell Labs)
 Bozo.* will, of course, be subdivided logically: bozo.nerd.*, bozo.tv.*,
 bozo.inane.*, bozo.boring.*, bozo.sex.*, bozo.argue.*.
===Kibology and alt.religion.kibology===

Kibology is a parody religion created by Parry, the central figure. Practitioners of Kibology are called &#x27;Kibologists&#x27; or (sometimes more disdainfully) &#x27;Kibozos&#x27;. Parry began Kibology about 1989. In its early Usenet days, it was centered in the newsgroups talk.bizarre and the Church of the SubGenius group &quot;alt.slack&quot;, until the creation of its own Usenet group, alt.religion.kibology in late 1991. The religious satire of Kibology shares tenets of other parody religions, including similar concepts to the Flying Spaghetti Monster and Invisible Pink Unicorn. The alt.religion.kibology newsgroup remained active through the 1990s, with gradually less emphasis on the joke religion and more satirizing popular culture and internet culture as a sort of online comedy writer&#x27;s collaboration room. The group collectively invented and developed the sport of &#x27;trolling,&#x27; with Kibo writing rules and a points system for trolling other Usenet newsgroups. Other popular regular contributors kept the group active even during &quot;Kibo&quot;&#x27;s periodic absences from Usenet. In 2003, the group spawned a band, Interröbang Cartel, which by 2011 had written and recorded more than 80 songs.

==Hallmarks==
The term &quot;bozo&quot; and related jokes like the physics particle the &quot;bozon&quot; were Parry hallmarks. Revisions of the Manifesto were published in 1994 and 1998. HappyWeb was introduced in 1999.

In 1992, at age 25 (ten years younger than the constitutional minimum age for election), he launched a spoof campaign for President of the United States.

<doc id="17250" wikidata="Q193331" url="?curid=17250" title="Kiritimati">
<text>Kiritimati (), also known as Christmas Island, is a Pacific Ocean atoll in the northern Line Islands. It is part of the Republic of Kiribati. The name is derived from the English word &quot;Christmas&quot; written in Gilbertese according to its phonology, in which the combination is pronounced /s/.

Kiritimati is one of the world&#x27;s largest atolls in terms of land area, consisting of about land area and a network of lagoons;. The atoll is about in perimeter, while the lagoon shoreline extends for over . Kiritimati comprises over 70% of the total land area of Kiribati, a country encompassing 33 Pacific atolls and islands.

It lies north of the equator, south of Honolulu, and from San Francisco. Kiritimati is in the world&#x27;s furthest forward time zone, UTC+14, and is therefore one of the first inhabited places on Earth to experience New Year&#x27;s Day (see also Caroline Atoll, Kiribati). Although it lies east of the 180th meridian, the Republic of Kiribati realigned the International Date Line in 1995, placing Kiritimati to the west of the dateline.

Nuclear tests were conducted on and around Kiritimati by the United Kingdom in the late 1950s, and by the United States in 1962. During these tests, the island was not evacuated, exposing the i-Kiribati residents and the British, New Zealand, and Fijian servicemen to nuclear radiation.

The entire island is a wildlife sanctuary; access to five particularly sensitive areas is restricted.

==History==

Kiritimati was initially inhabited by Polynesian people. Radiometric dating from sites on the island place the period of human use between 1250 and 1450 AD. Permanent human settlement on Kiritimati likely didn&#x27;t occur until 1882. Stratigraphic layers excavated in fire pits show alternating bands of charcoal indicating heavy use and local soil indicating a lack of use. As such, some researchers have suggested that Kiritimati was used intermittently (likely by people from Tabuaeran to the north) as a place to gather resources such as birds and turtles in a similar fashion to the ethnographically documented use of the five central atolls of the Caroline Islands.

Archaeological sites on the island are concentrated along the east (windward) side of the island and known sites represent a series of habitation sites, marae, and supporting structures such as canoe storage sheds and navigational aids.

The atoll was then discovered by Europeans with the Spanish expedition of Hernando de Grijalva in 1537, that charted it as &quot;Acea&quot;. This discovery was referred by a contemporary, the Portuguese António Galvão, governor of Ternate, in his book &quot;Tratado dos Descubrimientos&quot; of 1563. During his third voyage, Captain James Cook visited the island on Christmas Eve (24 December) 1777 and the island was put on a map in 1781 as &quot;île des Tortues&quot; (Turtles Island) by in Augsburg. Whaling vessels visited the island from at least 1822. and it was claimed by the United States under the Guano Islands Act of 1856, though little actual mining of guano took place.
Permanent settlement started in 1882, mainly by workers in coconut plantations and fishermen. In 1902, the British Government granted a 99-year lease on the island to Levers Pacific Plantations. The company planted 72,863 coconut palms on the island and introduced silver-lipped pearl oysters into the lagoon. The settlement did not endure: Extreme drought killed 75% of the coconut palms, and the island was abandoned from 1905 to 1912.

Many of the toponyms in the island date to Father , a French priest who leased the island from 1917 to 1939, and planted some 500,000 coconut trees there. He lived in his &quot;Paris&quot; house (now only small ruins) located at &quot;Benson Point&quot;, across the Burgle Channel from &quot;Londres&quot; at &quot;Bridges Point&quot; (today London) where he established the port. He gave the name of &quot;Poland&quot; to a village where Stanisław (Stanislaus) Pełczyński, his Polish plantation manager then lived.

Joe English, of Medford, Massachusetts, Rougier&#x27;s plantation manager from 1915 to 1919, named &quot;Joe&#x27;s Hill&quot; (some high) after himself. English and two teenagers were marooned on the island for a year and a half (1917–1919) as transport had stopped due to the Spanish flu breaking out in Tahiti and around the world. English was later rescued by British admiral John Jellicoe. English, thinking that the rescue ship was German and the war was still in effect, pulled his revolver on the admiral Jellicoe, causing a short standoff until some explanation defused the situation.

Kiritimati was occupied by the Allies in World War II with the U.S. in control of the island garrison. The atoll was important to hold, since Japanese occupation would allow interdiction of the Hawaii-to-Australia supply route. For the first few months there were next to no recreational facilities on the island, and the men amused themselves by shooting sharks in the lagoon. The island&#x27;s first airstrip was constructed at this time to supply the Air Force weather station and communications center. The airstrip also provided rest and refuelling facilities for planes travelling between Hawaii and the South Pacific. The 1947 census listed only 47 inhabitants on the island. The U.S. Guano Islands Act claim was formally ceded by the Treaty of Tarawa between the U.S. and Kiribati. The treaty was signed in 1979 and ratified in 1983.

===Spain&#x27;s sovereignty rights===
During the dispute over the Caroline Islands between Germany and Spain in 1885 which was arbitrated by Pope Leo XIII, the sovereignty of Spain over the Caroline and Palau islands as part of the Spanish East Indies was analysed by a commission of cardinals and confirmed by an agreement signed on 17 December 1885. Its Article 2 specifies the limits of Spanish sovereignty in South Micronesia, being formed by the Equator and 11°N Latitude and by 133° and 164° Longitude. In 1899, Spain sold the Marianas, Carolines, and Palau to Germany after its defeat in 1898 in the Spanish–American War. However Emilio Pastor Santos, a researcher of the Spanish National Research Council, claimed in 1948 that there was historical basis to argue that Kiritimati (&quot;Acea&quot; on the Spanish maps) and some other islands had never been considered part of the Carolines, supported by the charts and maps of the time. Despite having sought acknowledgement of the issue regarding interpretation of the treaty, no Spanish government has made any attempt to assert sovereignty over Kiritimati, and the case remains a historical curiosity.

===Nuclear bomb tests===

During the Cold War Kiritimati was used for nuclear weapons testing by the United Kingdom and the US. The United Kingdom conducted its first hydrogen bomb test series, Grapple 1–3, at Malden Island from 15 May to 19 June 1957 and used Kiritimati as the operation&#x27;s main base. On 8 November 1957, the first H-bomb was detonated over the southeastern tip of Kiritimati in the Grapple X test. Subsequent tests in 1958 (Grapple Y and Z) also took place above or near Kiritimati.

The United Kingdom detonated some of nuclear payload near and directly above Kiritimati in 1957–1958, while the total yield of weapons tested by the United States in the vicinity of the island between 25 April and 11 July 1962 was . During the British Grapple X test, yield was stronger than expected, resulting in the blast demolishing buildings and infrastructure. Islanders were usually not evacuated during the nuclear weapons testing, and data on the environmental and public health impact of these tests remains contested. Servicemen believe that cancer and genetic damage were consequences of their occupational exposure and have sought apologies and compensation without success. A spokesperson for the UK&#x27;s Ministry of Defence stated in 2018 that &quot;the National Radiological Protection Board has carried out three large studies of nuclear test veterans and found no valid evidence to link participation in these tests to ill health.&quot;

The United States also conducted 22 successful nuclear detonations over the island as part of Operation Dominic in 1962. Some toponyms (like &quot;Banana&quot; and &quot;Main Camp&quot;) come from the nuclear testing period, during which at times over 4,000 servicemen were present. By 1969, military interest in Kiritimati had ended and the facilities were mostly dismantled. However, some communications, transport, and logistics facilities were converted for civilian use, which Kiritimati uses to serve as the administrative centre for the Line Islands.

==Present status==
The island&#x27;s population increased from about 2,000 in 1989 to about 5,000 in the early 2000s, and reached 7,369 at the 2020 Census. Kiritimati has three representatives in the Maneaba ni Maungatabu. There are five main villages on the island, four populated and one abandoned; Banana, Tabwakea and London, which are located along the main road on the northern part of the island, and Poland (near South West Point) and unpopulated Paris (near Benson Point), which are across the main lagoon to the south.

London is the main village and hosts the port facility, and the ministry of the Line and Phoenix islands.
Poland hosts a Catholic church, dedicated under the auspices of Saint Stanislaus.
Banana is near Cassidy International Airport but may be relocated closer to London to prevent groundwater contamination.
Paris is an abandoned village and is no longer listed in census reports.

===Education===
There is a primary school in Poland and two high schools on the road between Tabwakea and Banana: one Catholic, St. Francis High School, and one Protestant. The government high school, Melaengi Tabai Secondary School, is located on Tabuaeran (though the government of Kiribati wished to re-open its campus on Kiritimati instead). The University of Hawaii has a climatological research facility on Kiritimati. The Kiribati Institute of Technology (KIT), based on Tarawa, opened a campus on Kiritimati in June 2019.

===Commerce===
Most of the atoll&#x27;s food supplies have to be imported. Potable water can be in short supply, especially around November in La Niña years. A large and modern jetty, handling some cargo, was built by the Japanese at London. Marine fish provide a large portion of the island&#x27;s nutrition, although overfishing has caused a drastic decrease in the populations of large, predatory fish over the last several years.

Exports of the atoll are mainly copra (dried coconut pulp); the state-owned coconut plantation covers about . In addition aquarium fish and seaweed are exported. A 1970s project to commercially breed &quot;Artemia salina&quot; brine shrimp in the salt ponds was abandoned in 1978. In recent years there have been attempts to explore the viability of live crayfish and chilled fish exports and salt production.

===Transport===
Cassidy International Airport (CXI) is located just north of Banana and North East Point. It has a paved runway with a length of and was for some time the only airport in Kiribati to serve the Americas, via an Air Pacific (now Fiji Airways) flight to Honolulu, Hawaii. Te Mauri Travel no longer offers weekly charter flights from Honolulu.

Air Tungaru was serving Kiritimati in 1981 with nonstop Boeing 727-100 jet flights to Honolulu (HNL), Papeete, Tahiti (PPT) and Tarawa (TRW) with each service operating once a week with the service to Papeete being operated in association with Union de Transports Aeriens (UTA), a French airline. Aloha Airlines introduced its weekly nonstop jet service between Honolulu and the island in 1986 operated with a Boeing 737-200. Aloha was continuing to serve Kiritimati from 2000 to 2003 with 737 jet service to and from Honolulu nonstop. Air Pacific ran flights to Kiritimati until 2008, when they ceased service over concerns about the condition of the runway. Services resumed in 2010. A monthly air freight service is flown using a chartered from Honolulu operated by Asia Pacific Airlines.

Aeon Field is an abandoned airport, constructed before the British nuclear tests. It is located on the southeastern peninsula.

===Communications===
The islands&#x27; remote location in the Central Pacific has meant that communications with the world has always been challenging.
As of October 2023 all calls and data rely on satellite connection only with very slow internet connection.

In July 2022 The Southern Cross NEXT 15,857 km submarine cable system, entered service, connecting Los Angeles and Sydney with a dedicated 377 kilometers (one fiber pair) branch to Tabwakea, Kiritimati. The cable landing station is located in Tabwakea, owned by Bwebwerikinet Limited. As of October 2023 the landing station was built, but still not commissioned. Apart from Australia and the US, the cable will also provide direct low latency connection to Fiji, New Zealand and Tokelau.

===Tourism===
There is a small amount of tourism, mainly associated with anglers interested in lagoon fishing (for bonefish in particular) or offshore fishing. Week-long ecotourism packages during which some of the normally closed areas can be visited are also available.

In recent years, surfers have discovered that there are good waves during the Northern Hemisphere&#x27;s winter season and there are interests developing to service these recreational tourists. There is some tourism-related infrastructure, such as a small hotel, rental facilities, and food services.

===Prospective launch sites===
In the early 1950s, Wernher von Braun proposed using this island as a launch site for crewed spacecraft, based on its proximity to the equator, and the generally empty ocean down-range (east).

There is a Japanese JAXA satellite tracking station. The abandoned Aeon Field had at one time been proposed for reuse by the Japanese for their now-canceled HOPE-X space shuttle project.

Kiritimati is also located fairly close to the Sea Launch satellite launching spot at 0° N 154° W, about 370 kilometres (200 nmi) to the east in international waters.

==Geography==

Kiritimati&#x27;s roughly lagoon area opens to the sea in the northwest; &quot;Burgle Channel&quot; (the entrance to the lagoon) is divided into the northern &quot;Cook Island Passage&quot; and the southern &quot;South Passage&quot;. The southeastern part of the lagoon area is partially desiccated. The lagoon area currently consists of a main lagoon at Burgle Channel. Southeast of this, the lagoon gradually transitions into a network of subsidiary lagoons, tidal flats, partially hypersaline brine ponds and salt pans which have a total combined area of about . Thus, the land and lagoon areas can only be given approximately, as no firm boundary exists between the main island body and the salt flats.

Kiritimati is a raised coral atoll with about land area surrounding a lagoon area of roughly the same size. Kiritimati has the largest land area in the world amongst atolls that contain a lagoon, and the third largest land area overall, after Lifou Island and Rennell Island. Kiritimati is often cited as being the world&#x27;s largest atoll by land area, however, because Lifou Island and Rennell Island do not have lagoons and therefore end up being overlooked as atolls.

In addition to the main island, there are several smaller ones. &quot;Cook Island&quot; is part of the atoll proper but unconnected to the Kiritimati mainland. It is a sand/coral island of , divides Burgle Channel into the northern and the southern entrance, and has a large seabird colony. Islets (&quot;motu&quot;s) in the lagoon include &quot;Motu Tabu&quot; () with its &quot;Pisonia&quot; forest and the shrub-covered &quot;Motu Upua&quot; (also called Motu Upou or Motu Upoa, ) at the northern side, and &quot;Ngaontetaake&quot; () at the eastern side.

&quot;Joe&#x27;s Hill&quot; (originally &quot;La colline de Joe&quot;) on the north coast of the south-eastern peninsula, southeast of Artemia Corners, is the highest point on the atoll, at about ASL. On the northwestern peninsula for example, the land rises only to some , which is still considerable for an atoll. Due to its isolation in the vast Pacific Ocean, &quot;Joe&#x27;s Hill&quot; is the 33rd most topographically isolated summit on Earth.

Vaskess Bay is a large bay which extends along the southwest coast of Kiritimati Island.

===Climate===
Despite its proximity to the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), Kiritimati is located in an equatorial dry zone and rainfall is rather low except during El Niño years; on average per year, in some years it can be as little as and much of the flats and ponds can dry up, as happened in late 1978. On the other hand, in some exceptionally wet years abundant downpours in March–April may result in a total annual precipitation of over . Kiritimati is thus affected by regular, severe droughts. They are exacerbated by its geological structure; climatically &quot;dry&quot; Pacific islands are more typically located in the &quot;desert belt&quot; at about 30°N or S latitude. Kiritimati is a raised atoll, and although it does occasionally receive plenty of precipitation, little is retained given the porous carbonate rock, the thin soil, and the absence of dense vegetation cover on much of the island, while evaporation is constantly high. Consequently, Kiritimati is one of the rather few places close to the Equator which have an effectively arid climate.

The temperature is constantly between with more diurnal temperature variation than seasonal variation. Easterly trade winds predominate.

===Demography===

At the first census done in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony in 1931, there were only 38 inhabitants on the island, most of them workers of the Company. After WWII in 1947 there were 52 inhabitants. After the nuclear tests, in 1963, this had increased to 477, reducing to 367 by 1967 but increasing again to 674 in 1973, 1,265 in 1978, 1,737 in the 1985 census, 2,537 in 1990, 3,225 in 1995, 3,431 in 2000, 5,115 in 2005, 5,586 in 2010, 6,456 in 2015 and 7,369 in 2020. This was the fastest population growth in Kiribati.

== Ecology ==
The flora and the fauna consist of taxa adapted to drought. Terrestrial fauna is scant; there are no truly native land mammals and only one native land bird – Kiribati&#x27;s endemic reed-warbler, the bokikokiko (&quot;Acrocephalus aequinoctialis&quot;). The 1957 attempt to introduce the endangered Rimitara lorikeet (&quot;Vini kuhlii&quot;) has largely failed; a few birds seem to linger on, but the lack of abundant coconut palm forest, on which this tiny parrot depends, makes Kiritimati a suboptimal habitat for this species.

=== Flora ===
The natural vegetation on Kiritimati consists mostly of low shrubland and grassland. What little woodland exists is mainly open coconut palm (&quot;Cocos nucifera&quot;) plantation. There are three small woods of catchbird trees (&quot;Pisonia grandis&quot;), at Southeast Point, Northwest Point, and on Motu Tabu. The latter was planted there in recent times. About 50 introduced plant species are found on Kiritimati; as most are plentiful around settlements, former military sites and roads, it seems that these only became established in the 20th century.
Beach naupaka (&quot;Scaevola taccada&quot;) is the most common shrub on Kiritimati; beach naupaka scrub dominates the vegetation on much of the island, either as pure stands or interspersed with tree heliotrope (&quot;Heliotropium foertherianum&quot;) and bay cedar (&quot;Suriana maritima&quot;). The latter species is dominant on the drier parts of the lagoon flats where it grows up to tall. Tree heliotrope is most commonly found a short distance from the sea- or lagoon-shore. In some places near the seashore, a low vegetation dominated by Polynesian heliotrope (&quot;Heliotropium anomalum&quot;), yellow purslane (&quot;Portulaca lutea&quot;) and common purslane (&quot;P. oleracea&quot;) is found. In the south and on the sandier parts, &quot;Sida fallax&quot;, also growing up to 2 m tall, is abundant. On the southeastern peninsula, &quot;S. fallax&quot; grows more stunted, and Polynesian heliotrope, yellow and common purslane as well as the spiderling &quot;Boerhavia repens&quot;, the parasitic vine &quot;Cassytha filiformis&quot;, and Pacific Island thintail (&quot;Lepturus repens&quot;) supplement it. The last species dominates in the coastal grasslands. The wetter parts of the lagoon shore are often covered by abundant growth of shoreline purslane (&quot;Sesuvium portulacastrum&quot;).

Perhaps the most destructive of the recently introduced plants is sweetscent (&quot;Pluchea odorata&quot;), a camphorweed, which is considered an invasive weed as it overgrows and displaces herbs and grasses. The introduced creeper &quot;Tribulus cistoides&quot;, despite having also spread conspicuously, is considered to be more beneficial than harmful to the ecosystem, as it provides good nesting sites for some seabirds.

===Birds===


:&quot;See also &quot;Extinction&quot; below.&quot;

More than 35 bird species have been recorded from Kiritimati. As noted above, only the bokikokiko (&quot;Acrocephalus aequinoctialis&quot;), perhaps a few Rimitara lorikeets (&quot;Vini kuhlii&quot;) – if any remain at all – and the occasional eastern reef egret (&quot;Egretta sacra&quot;) make up the entire landbird fauna. About 1,000 adult bokikokikos are to be found at any date, but mainly in mixed grass/shrubland away from the settlements.

On the other hand, seabirds are plentiful on Kiritimati, and make up the bulk of the breeding bird population. There are 18 species of seabirds breeding on the island, and Kiritimati is one of the most important breeding grounds anywhere in the world for several of these:

Phaethontiformes
* Eastern red-tailed tropicbird (&quot;Phaethon rubricauda melanorhynchus&quot;) – important breeding colony; 8,000 birds before the 1982–1983 decline, fewer than 3,000 in 1984

Charadriiformes
* Micronesian black noddy (&quot;Anous minutus marcusi&quot;) – 20,000 birds before the 1982–1983 decline
* Little white tern (&quot;Gygis microrhyncha&quot;) – 8,000 birds before the 1982–1983 decline
* Central Pacific sooty tern (&quot;Onychoprion fuscatus oahuensis&quot;) – largest breeding colony in the world; around 7,000,000 birds before the 1982–1983 decline
* Spectacled tern (&quot;Onychoprion lunatus&quot;) – important breeding colony; 6,000 birds before the 1982–1983 decline
* Central blue-grey noddy (&quot;Procelsterna cerulea cerulea&quot;) – important breeding colony, possibly the largest worldwide of this subspecies; 4,000 birds before the 1982–1983 decline

Procellariiformes
* Polynesian storm petrel (&quot;Nesofregetta fuliginosa&quot;) – important breeding colony; 1,000 birds before the 1982–1983 decline
* Phoenix petrel (&quot;Pterodroma alba&quot;) – largest breeding colony in the world; 24,000 birds before the 1982–1983 decline
* Christmas shearwater (&quot;Puffinus nativitatis&quot;) – largest subpopulation worldwide on Motu Upua; 12,000 birds before the 1982–1983 decline
* Wedge-tailed shearwater (&quot;Puffinus pacificus&quot;) – among the very largest breeding colonies in the world; about 1,000,000 birds before the 1982–1983 decline

Pelecaniformes
* Indopacific lesser frigatebird (&quot;Fregata ariel ariel&quot;) – important breeding colony; 9,000 birds before the 1982–1983 decline
* Central Pacific great frigatebird (&quot;Fregata minor palmerstoni&quot;) – important breeding colony; 12,000 birds before the 1982–1983 decline, 6,500 afterwards
* Austropacific masked booby (&quot;Sula dactylatra personata&quot;) – important breeding colony; 3,000 birds before the 1982–1983 decline
* Indopacific red-footed booby (&quot;Sula sula rubripes&quot;) – 12,000 birds before the 1982–1983 decline

Kiritimati&#x27;s lagoon and the saltflats are a prime location for migratory birds to stop over or even stay all winter. The most commonly seen migrants are ruddy turnstone (&quot;Arenaria interpres&quot;), Pacific golden plover (&quot;Pluvialis fulva&quot;), bristle-thighed curlew (&quot;Numenius tahitiensis&quot;), and wandering tattler (&quot;Tringa incana&quot;); other seabirds, waders, and even dabbling ducks can be encountered every now and then. Around 7 October (±5 days), some 20 million sooty shearwaters pass through here en route from the North Pacific feeding grounds to breeding sites around New Zealand.

===Other fauna===
The only mammals native to the region are the common Polynesian rat (&quot;Rattus exulans&quot;) and the goats. The rat seems to have been introduced by seafarers many centuries before Cook arrived in 1777 (he mentioned them already being present); goats have been extinct since 14 January 2004. Black rats (&quot;Rattus rattus&quot;) were present at some time, perhaps introduced by 19th century sailors or during the nuclear tests. They were not able to gain a foothold between predation by cats and competitive exclusion by Polynesian rats, and no black rat population is found on Kiritimati today.

Up to 2,000 feral cats can in some years be found on the island; the population became established in the 19th century. Their depredations seriously harm the birdlife. Since the late 19th century, they have driven about 60% of the seabird species from the mainland completely, and during particular dry spells they will cross the mudflats and feast upon the birds on the &quot;motu&quot;s. Spectacled tern chicks seem to be a favourite food of the local cat population. There are some measures being taken to ensure the cat population does not grow. That lowering the cat population by some amount would much benefit Christmas and its inhabitants is generally accepted, but the situation is too complex to simply go and eradicate them outright. A limited population of feral pigs exists. They were once plentiful and wreaked havoc especially on the &quot;Onychoprion&quot; and noddies. Pig hunting by locals has been encouraged, and was highly successful at limiting the pig population to a sustainable level, while providing a source of cheap protein for the islanders.

There are some &quot;supertramp&quot; lizards which have reached the island by their own means. Commonly seen are the mourning gecko (&quot;Lepidodactylus lugubris&quot;) and the skink &quot;Cryptoblepharus boutonii&quot;; the four-clawed gecko (&quot;Gehyra mutilata&quot;) is seen less often.

There are some crustaceans of note to be found on Kiritimati and in the waters immediately adjacent. The coconut crab (&quot;Birgus latro&quot;) is not as common as on Teraina. Ghost crabs (genus &quot;Ocypode&quot;), &quot;Cardisoma carnifex&quot; and &quot;Geograpsus grayi&quot; land crabs, the strawberry land hermit crab (&quot;Coenobita perlatus&quot;) are also notable. Introduced brine shrimp &quot;Artemia salina&quot; populate the island&#x27;s saline ponds.

==Ecology of the reef==
Overfishing and pollution have impacted on the ocean surrounding the island. In the ocean surrounding uninhabited islands of the Northern Line Islands, Sharks comprised 74% of the top predator biomass (329 g/m2) at Kingman Reef and 57% at Palmyra Atoll (97 g/m2), whereas low shark numbers have been observed at Tabuaeran and Kiritimati.

Green turtles (&quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;) regularly nest in small numbers on Kiritimati. The lagoon is famous among sea anglers worldwide for its bonefish (&quot;Albula glossodonta&quot;), and has been stocked with &quot;Oreochromis&quot; tilapia to decrease overfishing of marine species. Though the tilapias thrive in brackish water of the flats, they will not last long should they escape into the surrounding ocean.

Giant Trevally (Caranx ignobilis) are found in large numbers both inside and outside of the lagoon and along the surrounding reefs. Very large specimens of Giant Trevally can be found around these surrounding reefs and they are sought after by many fishermen in addition to Bonefish.

== Conservation and extinction ==
In December 1960, the British colonial authority gazetted Kiritimati as a bird sanctuary under the &quot;Gilbert and Ellice Island Colony Wild Birds Protection Ordinance&quot; of 1938. Access to Cook Island, Motu Tabu, and Motu Upua was restricted. Kiritimati was declared a Wildlife Sanctuary in May 1975, in accordance with the Wildlife Conservation Ordinance of the then self-governing colony. Ngaontetaake and the sooty tern breeding grounds at North West Point also became restricted-access zones. Two years later, active conservation measures got underway.

To a limited extent, permits to enter the restricted areas for purposes like research or small-scale ecotourism are given. Kiribati&#x27;s Wildlife Conservation Unit participates in the Kiritimati Development Committee and the Local Land Planning Board, and there exists an integrated program of wildlife conservation and education. New Zealand is a major sponsor of conservation efforts on Kiritimati.

=== Former egg gathering ===
Egg collecting for food on a massive scale was frequent in the past but is now outlawed. It is to be noted that the sooty terns for example could sustain occasional collection of effectively all of a season&#x27;s eggs (over 10 million), if given sufficient time to recover and if cats are absent. In theory, even egg collecting on a scale that significantly decreases costly food imports could be possible, but not until the cat and rat populations have been brought under control. Poaching remains a concern; with the population rising and spreading out on Kiritimati, formerly remote bird colonies have become more accessible; the red-tailed tropicbirds and the &quot;Sula&quot; especially are strongly affected by hunting and disturbance. Tropicbirds are mainly poached for their feathers, which are used in local arts and handicraft; it would certainly be possible to obtain them from living birds as was routinely done at the height of the Polynesian civilisation.

=== Feral cats ===
It may seem that the former numbers of seabirds may only ever be approached again by the wholesale eradication of the feral cats. While this has been since shown to be feasible, it is not clear whether even a severe curtailing of the cat population would be desirable: Though it previously was assumed that the small Polynesian rat is of little, if any, harm to seabirds, even house mice have been shown to eat seabird nestlings. Most nesting birds, in particularly Procellariiformes, are now accepted to be jeopardised by &quot;Rattus exulans&quot;. Kiritimati&#x27;s cats meanwhile, are very fond of young seabirds; it even seems that their behaviour shifts accordingly, with cats being generally less territorial, and congregating in numbers at active bird colonies; they generally eschew hunting rats when seabird chicks are in plenty.

Possession of an unneutered female cat on Kiritimati is illegal, and owners need to prevent their domestic cats from running wild (such animals are usually quickly killed in traps set for this purpose). Nighttime cat hunting has made little effect on the cat population. As noted above, vigorous protection of active nesting grounds from cats by traps and poison, supplemented by shooting, while otherwise leaving them alone to hunt rats may well be the optimal solution.

=== Radiation hazards ===
There is no reliable data on the environmental and public health impact of the nuclear tests conducted on the island in the late 1950s. A 1975 study claimed that there was negligible radiation hazard; certainly, fallout was successfully minimised. More recently however, a Massey University study of New Zealand found chromosomal translocations to be increased about threefold on average in veterans who participated in the tests; most of the relevant data remains classified to date.

=== 1982–1983 El Niño ===
The 1982–1983 &quot;mega-El Niño&quot; devastated seabird populations on Kiritimati. In some species, mortality rose to 90% and breeding success dropped to zero during that time.

In general, El Niño conditions will cause seabird populations to drop, taking several years to recover at the present density of predators. Global warming impact on Kiritimati is thus unpredictable. El Niño events seem to become shorter but more frequent in a warmer climate.

=== Climate change ===
Much of the island&#x27;s infrastructure and habitation, with the notable exception of the airport area, is located to the leeward and thus somewhat protected from storms.

A rising sea level does not appear to be particularly problematic; the increasing flooding of the subsidiary lagoons would provide easily observed forewarning, and might even benefit seabird populations by making the &quot;motu&quot;s less accessible to predators. In fact, geological data suggests that Kiritimati has withstood prehistoric sea level changes well.

The biggest hazard caused by a changing climate would seem to be more prolonged and/or severe droughts, which could even precipitate the island&#x27;s abandonment (as happened in 1905). However, it is not clear how weather patterns would change, and it may be that precipitation increases.

=== Extinction ===
The type specimen of the Tuamotu sandpiper (&quot;Prosobonia cancellata&quot;) was collected on Christmas Island in 1778, probably on 1 or 2 January, during Captain Cook&#x27;s visit. The expedition&#x27;s naturalist William Anderson observed the bird, and it was painted by William Ellis (linked below). The single specimen was in Joseph Banks&#x27;s collection at the end of the 18th century, but later was lost or destroyed. There is some taxonomic dispute regarding the Kiritimati population.

As all &quot;Prosobonia&quot; seem(ed) to be resident birds, unwilling to undertake long-distance migrations, an appropriate treatment would be to consider the extinct population the nominate subspecies, as &quot;Prosobonia cancellata cancellata&quot; or Kiritimati sandpiper, distinct from the surviving Tuamotu Islands population more than to the southeast.
It may have been, but probably was not, limited to Kiritimati; while no remains have been found, little fieldwork has been conducted, and judging from the Tuamotu sandpiper&#x27;s habits, almost all Line Islands would have offered suitable habitat.

The Kiritimati population of &quot;P. cancellata&quot; disappeared in the earlier part of the 19th century or so, almost certainly due to predation by introduced mammals. While &quot;Prosobonia&quot; generally manage to hold their own against Polynesian rats, they are highly vulnerable to the black rat and feral cats. Given the uncertainties surrounding the introduction date and maximum population of the former, the cats seem to be the main culprits in the Kiritimati sandpiper&#x27;s extinction.
Given that the island was apparently settled to some extent in prehistoric times, it may have already lost bird species then. The geological data indicates that Kiritimati is very old and was never completely underwater in the Holocene at least; thus it might have once harboured highly distinct wetland birds.

The limited overall habitat diversity on Kiritimati nonetheless limits the range of such hypothetical taxa, as does biogeography due to its remote location. At least one, possibly several &quot;Gallirallus&quot; and / or &quot;Porzana&quot; rails make the most likely candidates, given their former presence in the region, and that conditions on Kiritimati would seem well suited. Perhaps a &quot;Todiramphus&quot; kingfisher was also present; such a bird would probably have belonged to the sacred kingfisher (&quot;T. sanctus&quot;) group, as that species today occurs as a vagrant in Micronesia, and related forms are resident in southeastern Polynesia. These birds would have fallen victim to the Polynesian rat. In the case of the rails (which would have almost certainly been flightless) hunting by occasionally resident Polynesians, in addition to predation by the imported rats, likely contributed to their extinction.

<doc id="17253" wikidata="Q1089037" url="?curid=17253" title="Kubla Khan">
<text>&quot;Kubla Khan: or A Vision in a Dream&quot; () is a poem written by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, completed in 1797 and published in 1816. It is sometimes given the subtitles &quot;A Vision in a Dream&quot; and &quot;A Fragment.&quot; According to Coleridge&#x27;s preface to &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;, the poem was composed one night after he experienced an opium-influenced dream after reading a work describing Xanadu, the summer capital of the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty of China founded by Kublai Khan (Emperor Shizu of Yuan). Upon waking, he set about writing lines of poetry that came to him from the dream until he was interrupted by &quot;a person on business from Porlock&quot;. The poem could not be completed according to its original 200–300 line plan as the interruption caused him to forget the lines. He left it unpublished and kept it for private readings for his friends until 1816 when, at the prompting of Lord Byron, it was published.

The poem is vastly different in style from other poems written by Coleridge. The first stanza of the poem describes Kublai Khan&#x27;s pleasure dome built alongside a sacred river fed by a powerful fountain. The second stanza depicts the sacred river as a darker, supernatural and more violent force of nature. Ultimately the clamor and energy of the physical world breaks through into Kublai&#x27;s inner turmoil and restlessness. The third and final stanza of the poem is the narrator&#x27;s response to the power and effects of an Abyssinian maid&#x27;s song, which enraptures him but leaves him unable to act on her inspiration unless he could hear her once again. Together, the stanzas form a comparison of creative power that does not work with nature and creative power that is harmonious with nature. Coleridge concludes by describing a hypothetical audience&#x27;s reaction to the song in the language of religious ecstasy.

Some of Coleridge&#x27;s contemporaries denounced the poem and questioned his story of its origin. It was not until years later that critics began to openly admire the poem. Most modern critics now view &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; as one of Coleridge&#x27;s three great poems, along with &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; and &quot;Christabel&quot;. The poem is considered one of the most famous examples of Romanticism in English poetry, and is one of the most frequently anthologized poems in the English language. The manuscript is a permanent exhibit at the British Library in London.

==Poem==
The poem is divided into three irregular stanzas, which move loosely between different times and places.

The first stanza begins with a fanciful description of the origin of Kublai Khan&#x27;s capital Xanadu (lines 1–2). It is described as being near the river Alph, which passes through caves before reaching a dark sea (lines 3–5). Ten miles of land were surrounded with fortified walls (lines 6–7), encompassing lush gardens and forests (lines 8–11).

The second stanza describes a mysterious canyon (lines 12–16). A hydrothermal explosion erupted from the canyon (lines 17–19), throwing rubble into the air (lines 20–23) and forming the source of the sacred river Alph (line 24). The river wandered through the woods, then reached the caves and dark sea described in the first stanza (lines 25–28). Kubla Khan, present for the eruption, heard a prophecy of war (lines 29–30). An indented section presents an image of the pleasure-dome reflected on the water, surrounded by the sound of the geyser above ground and the river underground (lines 31–34). A final un-indented couplet describes the dome again (lines 35–36).

The third stanza shifts to the first-person perspective of the poem&#x27;s speaker. He once saw a woman in a vision playing a dulcimer (lines 37–41). If he could revive her song within himself, he says, he would revive the pleasure dome itself with music (lines 42–47). Those who heard would also see themselves there, and cry out a warning (lines 48–49). Their warning concerns an alarming male figure (line 50). The stanza ends with instructions and a warning, to carry out a ritual because he has consumed the food of Paradise (lines 51–54).

== Composition and publication ==
=== Date of composition ===

&quot;Kubla Khan&quot; was likely written in October 1797, though the precise date and circumstances of the first composition of &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; are slightly ambiguous, due to limited direct evidence. Coleridge usually dated his poems, but did not date &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;, and did not mention the poem directly in letters to his friends.

Coleridge&#x27;s descriptions of the poem&#x27;s composition attribute it to 1797. In a manuscript in Coleridge&#x27;s handwriting (known as the Crewe manuscript), a note by Coleridge says that it was composed &quot;in the fall of the year, 1797.&quot; In the preface to the first published edition of the poem, in 1816, Coleridge says that it was composed during an extended stay he had made in Somerset during &quot;the summer of the year 1797.&quot; On 14 October 1797, Coleridge wrote a letter to John Thelwall which, although it does not directly mention &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;, expresses many of the same feelings as in the poem, suggesting that these themes were on his mind. All of these details have led to the consensus of an October 1797 composition date.

A May 1798 composition date is sometimes proposed because the first written mention of the poem is in Dorothy Wordsworth&#x27;s journal of October 1798, where she mentions &quot;carrying &quot;Kubla&quot; to a fountain&quot;. October 1799 has also been suggested because by then Coleridge would have been able to read Robert Southey&#x27;s &quot;Thalaba the Destroyer&quot;, a work which drew on the same sources as &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;. At both time periods, Coleridge was again in the area of Ash Farm, near Culbone Church, where Coleridge consistently described composing the poem. However, the October 1797 composition date is more widely accepted.

=== Composition in a dream ===
In September 1797, Coleridge lived in Nether Stowey in the southwest of England and spent much of his time walking through the nearby Quantock Hills with his fellow poet William Wordsworth and Wordsworth&#x27;s sister Dorothy (his route today is memorialised as the &quot;Coleridge Way&quot;). Some time between 9 and 14 October 1797, when Coleridge says he had completed the tragedy &quot;Osorio&quot;, he left Stowey for Lynton. On his return journey, he became sick and rested at Ash Farm, located near Culbone Church and one of the few places to seek shelter on his route. There, he had a dream which inspired the poem.

Coleridge described the circumstances of his dream and the poem in two places: on a manuscript copy written some time before 1816, and in the preface to the printed version of the poem published in 1816. The manuscript states: &quot;This fragment with a good deal more, not recoverable, composed, in a sort of Reverie brought on by two grains of Opium taken to check a dysentry, at a Farm House between Porlock &amp; Linton, a quarter of a mile from Culbone Church.&quot; The printed preface describes his location as &quot;a lonely farm house between Porlock and Linton, on the Exmoor confines of Somerset and Devonshire,&quot; and embellishes the events into a narrative which has sometimes been seen as part of the poem itself.

According to the extended preface narrative, Coleridge was reading &quot;Purchas his Pilgrimes&quot; by Samuel Purchas, and fell asleep after reading about Kublai Khan. Then, he says, he &quot;continued for about three hours in a profound sleep... during which time he had the most vivid confidence, that he could not have composed less than from two or three hundred lines ... On Awaking he appeared to himself to have a distinct recollection of the whole, and taking his pen, ink, and paper, instantly and eagerly wrote down the lines that are here preserved.&quot; The passage continues with a famous account of an interruption: &quot;At this moment he was unfortunately called out by a person on business from Porlock... and on his return to his room, found, to his no small surprise and mortification, that though he still retained some vague and dim recollection of the general purpose of the vision, yet, with the exception of some eight or ten scattered lines and images, all the rest had passed away.&quot; The &quot;person on business from Porlock&quot; later became a term to describe interrupted genius. When John Livingston Lowes taught the poem, he told his students &quot;If there is any man in the history of literature who should be hanged, drawn, and quartered, it is the man on business from Porlock.&quot;

There are some problems with Coleridge&#x27;s account, especially the claim to have a copy of Purchas with him. It was a rare book, unlikely to be at a &quot;lonely farmhouse&quot;, nor would an individual carry it on a journey; the folio was heavy and almost 1,000 pages in size. It is possible that the words of Purchas were merely remembered by Coleridge and that the depiction of immediately reading the work before falling asleep was to suggest that the subject came to him accidentally. Critics have also noted that unlike the manuscript, which says he had taken two grains of opium, the printed version of this story says only that &quot;In consequence of a slight indisposition, an anodyne had been prescribed.&quot; The image of himself that Coleridge provides is of a dreamer who reads works of lore and not as an opium addict. Instead, the effects of the opium, as described, are intended to suggest that he was not used to its effects.

According to some critics, the second stanza of the poem, forming a conclusion, was composed at a later date and was possibly disconnected from the original dream.

===Publication===
After its composition, Coleridge periodically read the poem to friends, as to the Wordsworths in 1798, but did not seek to publish it. Coleridge&#x27;s friend, the author Mary Robinson wrote a response to the poem titled, &quot;To the Poet Coleridge,&quot; which was first published in the October, 17, 1800 edition of &quot;The Morning Post&quot;, and was later included in her &quot;Poetical Works&quot; compilation in 1806. In 1808 an anonymous contributor to the &quot;Monthly Repertory of English Literature&quot; quoted two lines from it in a book review.

The poem was set aside until 1815 when Coleridge compiled manuscripts of his poems for a collection titled &quot;Sibylline Leaves&quot;. It did not feature in that volume, but Coleridge did read the poem to Lord Byron on 10 April 1816.

Byron persuaded Coleridge to publish the poem, and on 12 April 1816, a contract was drawn up with the publisher John Murray for £80. The Preface of &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; explained that it was printed &quot;at the request of a poet of great and deserved celebrity, and as far as the author&#x27;s own opinions are concerned, rather as a psychological curiosity, than on the ground of any supposed &quot;poetic&quot; merits.&quot; Coleridge&#x27;s wife discouraged the publication, and Charles Lamb, a poet and friend of Coleridge, expressed mixed feelings, worrying that the printed version of the poem couldn&#x27;t capture the power of the recited version.

&quot;Kubla Khan&quot; was published with &quot;Christabel&quot; and &quot;The Pains of Sleep&quot; on 25 May 1816. Coleridge included the subtitle &quot;A Fragment&quot; to defend against criticism of the poem&#x27;s incomplete nature. The original published version of the work was separated into 2 stanzas, with the first ending at line 30. The poem was printed four times in Coleridge&#x27;s life, with the final printing in his &quot;Poetical Works&quot; of 1834. In the final work, Coleridge added the expanded subtitle &quot;Or, A Vision in a Dream. A Fragment&quot;. Printed with &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; was a preface that stated a dream provided Coleridge the lines. In some later anthologies of Coleridge&#x27;s poetry, the preface is dropped along with the subtitle denoting its fragmentary and dream nature. Sometimes, the preface is included in modern editions but lacks both the first and final paragraphs.

==Sources==
===Purchas and Marco Polo===
The book Coleridge was reading before he fell asleep was &quot;Purchas, his Pilgrimes, or Relations of the World and Religions Observed in All Ages and Places Discovered, from the Creation to the Present&quot;, by the English clergyman and geographer Samuel Purchas, published in 1613. The book contained a brief description of Xanadu, the summer capital of the Mongol ruler Kublai Khan. Coleridge&#x27;s preface says that he was reading the following sentence, or words of the same substance, in Purchas&#x27;s &quot;Pilgrimage&quot;:

 Here the Khan Kubla commanded a palace to be built, and a stately garden thereunto. And thus ten miles of fertile ground were inclosed with a wall.

Coleridge names the wrong book by Purchas (Purchas wrote three books, his &quot;Pilgrimage&quot;, his &quot;Pilgrim&quot;, and his &quot;Pilgrimes&quot;; the last was his collection of travel stories), and misquotes the line. The text about Xanadu in &quot;Purchas, His Pilgrimes&quot;, which Coleridge admitted he did not remember exactly, was:

In Xandu did Cublai Can build a stately Pallace, encompassing sixteen miles of plaine ground with a wall, wherein are fertile Meddowes, pleasant Springs, delightfull streames, and all sorts of beasts of chase and game, and in the middest thereof a sumptuous house of pleasure, which may be moved from place to place.

This quotation was based upon the writings of the Venetian explorer Marco Polo who is widely believed to have visited Xanadu in about 1275. Marco Polo also described a large portable palace made of gilded and lacquered cane or bamboo which could be taken apart quickly and moved from place to place. This was the &quot;sumptuous house of pleasure&quot; mentioned by Purchas, which Coleridge transformed into a &quot;stately pleasure dome&quot;.

In terms of spelling, Coleridge&#x27;s printed version differs from Purchas&#x27;s spelling, which refers to the Tartar ruler as &quot;Cublai Can&quot;, and from the spelling used by Milton, &quot;Cathaian Can&quot;. His original manuscript spells the name &quot;Cubla Khan&quot; and the place &quot;Xannadu&quot;.

=== Mount Abora ===
In the Crewe manuscript (the earlier unpublished version of the poem), the Abyssinian maid is singing of Mount Amara, rather than Abora. Mount Amara is a real mountain, today called Amba Geshen, located in the Amhara Region of modern Ethiopia, formerly known as the Abyssinian Empire. It was a natural fortress, and was the site of the royal treasury and the royal prison. The sons of the Emperors of Abyssinia, except for the heir, were held prisoner there, to prevent them from staging a coup against their father, until the Emperor&#x27;s death.

Mount Amara was visited between 1515 and 1521 by Portuguese priest, explorer and diplomat Francisco Alvares (1465–1541), who was on a mission to meet the Christian king of Ethiopia. His description of Mount Amara was published in 1540, and appears in &quot;Purchas, his Pilgrimes&quot;, the book Coleridge was reading before he wrote &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;. Mount Amara also appears in Milton&#x27;s Paradise Lost, where it is &quot;by some suppos&#x27;d / True Paradise under the Ethiop line,&quot; where Abyssinian kings keep their children guarded.

Mount Amara is in the same region as Lake Tana, the source of the Blue Nile river. Ethiopian tradition says that the Blue Nile is the River Gihon of the Bible, one of the four rivers that flow out of the Garden of Eden in the Book of Genesis, which says that Gihon flows through the Kingdom of Kush, the Biblical name for Ethiopia and Sudan. In fact the Blue Nile is very far from the other three rivers mentioned in Genesis 2:10–14, but this belief led to the connection in 18th and 19th century English literature between Mount Amara and Paradise.

===Abyssinian maid===
The Abyssinian maid is similar to the way Coleridge describes Lewti in another poem he wrote around the same time, &quot;Lewti&quot;. The connection between Lewti and the Abyssinian maid makes it possible that the maid was intended as a disguised version of Mary Evans, who appears as a love interest since Coleridge&#x27;s 1794 poem &quot;The Sigh&quot;. Evans, in these poems, appears as an object of sexual desire and a source of inspiration. She is also similar to the later subject of many of Coleridge&#x27;s poems, Asra, based on Sara Hutchinson.

Literary precedents for the Abyssinian maid include a description in Heliodorus&#x27;s work &quot;Aethiopian History&quot;, with its description of &quot;a young Lady, sitting upon a Rock, of so rare and perfect a Beauty, as one would have taken her for a Goddess, and though her present misery opprest her with extreamest grief, yet in the greatness of her afflection, they might easily perceive the greatness of her Courage: A Laurel crown&#x27;d her Head, and a Quiver in a Scarf hanged at her back&quot;. Her description in the poem is also related to Isis of Apuleius&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses,&quot; and to John Keats&#x27;s Indian woman in &quot;Endymion&quot; who is revealed to be the moon goddess.

=== Other sources ===
Charles Lamb provided Coleridge on 15 April 1797 with a copy of his &quot;A Vision of Repentance&quot;, a poem that discussed a dream containing imagery similar to those in &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;. The poem could have provided Coleridge with the idea of a dream poem that discusses fountains, sacredness, and even a woman singing a sorrowful song.

There are additional strong literary connections to other works, including John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, Samuel Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Rasselas&quot;, Chatterton&#x27;s &quot;African Eclogues&quot;, William Bartram&#x27;s &quot;Travels through North and South Carolina&quot;, Thomas Burnet&#x27;s &quot;Sacred Theory of the Earth&quot;, Mary Wollstonecraft&#x27;s &quot;A Short Residence in Sweden&quot;, Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedrus and Ion&quot;, Maurice&#x27;s &quot;The History of Hindostan&quot;, and Heliodorus&#x27;s &quot;Aethiopian History&quot;. The poem also contains allusions to the Book of Revelation in its description of New Jerusalem and to the paradise of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. The sources used for &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; are also used in Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;.

Opium itself has also been seen as a &quot;source&quot; for many of the poem&#x27;s features, such as its disorganized action. These features are similar to writing by other contemporary opium eaters and writers, such as Thomas de Quincey and Charles Pierre Baudelaire.

Coleridge may also have been influenced by the surrounding of Culbone Combe and its hills, gulleys, and other features including the &quot;mystical&quot; and &quot;sacred&quot; locations in the region. Other geographic influences include the river, which has been tied to Alpheus in Greece and is similar to the Nile. The caves have been compared to those in Kashmir.

==Style==
=== Fragmentation ===
According to Coleridge&#x27;s account, the poem is an incomplete fragment. Originally, he says, his dream included between 200 and 300 lines, but he was able to compose only the first 30 before he was interrupted. The second stanza is not necessarily part of the original dream and refers to the dream in the past tense. &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; is also related to the genre of fragmentary poetry, with internal images reinforcing the idea of fragmentation that is found within the form of the poem. The poem&#x27;s self-proclaimed fragmentary nature combined with Coleridge&#x27;s warning about the poem in the preface turns &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; into an &quot;anti-poem&quot;, a work that lacks structure, order, and leaves the reader confused instead of enlightened. However, the poem has little relation to the other fragmentary poems Coleridge wrote.

The first lines of the poem follow iambic tetrameter with the initial stanza relying on heavy stresses. The lines of the second stanza incorporate lighter stresses to increase the speed of the meter to separate them from the hammer-like rhythm of the previous lines. There also is a strong break following line 36 in the poem that provides for a second stanza, and there is a transition in narration from a third person narration about Kubla Khan into the poet discussing his role as a poet. Without the Preface, the two stanzas form two different poems that have some relationship to each other but lack unity. This is not to say they would be two different poems, since the technique of having separate parts that respond to another is used in the genre of the odal hymn, as in the poetry of other Romantic poets including John Keats or Percy Bysshe Shelley. However, the odal hymn as used by others has a stronger unity among its parts, and Coleridge believed in writing poetry that was unified organically. It is possible that Coleridge was displeased by the lack of unity in the poem and added a note about the structure to the Preface to explain his thoughts.

=== Sound ===
The poem&#x27;s language is highly stylised with a strong emphasis on sound devices that change between the poem&#x27;s original two stanzas. The poem relies on many sound-based techniques, including cognate variation and chiasmus. In particular, the poem emphasises the use of the &quot;æ&quot; sound and similar modifications to the standard &quot;a&quot; sound to make the poem sound Asian. Its rhyme scheme found in the first seven lines is repeated in the first seven lines of the second stanza. There is a heavy use of assonance and alliteration, especially in the first line: &quot;In Xanadu did Kubla Khan&quot;. The stressed sounds, &quot;Xan&quot;, &quot;du&quot;, &quot;Ku&quot;, &quot;Khan&quot;, contain assonance in their use of the sounds a-u-u-a, have two rhyming syllables with &quot;Xan&quot; and &quot;Khan&quot;, and employ alliteration with the name &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; and the reuse of &quot;d&quot; sounds in &quot;Xanadu&quot; and &quot;did&quot;. To pull the line together, the &quot;i&quot; sound of &quot;In&quot; is repeated in &quot;did&quot;. Later lines do not contain the same amount of symmetry but do rely on assonance and rhymes throughout. Though the lines are interconnected, the rhyme scheme and line lengths are irregular.

==Major themes==

=== Poetic imagination ===
One theory says that &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; is about poetry and the two sections discuss two types of poems. The power of the imagination is an important component to this theme. The poem celebrates creativity and how the poet is able to experience a connection to the universe through inspiration. As a poet, Coleridge places himself in an uncertain position as either master over his creative powers or a slave to it. The dome city represents the imagination and the second stanza represents the relationship between a poet and the rest of society. The poet is separated from the rest of humanity after he is exposed to the power to create and is able to witness visions of truth. This separation causes a combative relationship between the poet and the audience as the poet seeks to control his listener through a mesmerising technique. The poem&#x27;s emphasis on imagination as subject of a poem, on the contrasts within the paradisal setting, and its discussion of the role of poet as either being blessed or cursed by imagination, has influenced many works, including Alfred Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Palace of Art&quot; and William Butler Yeats&#x27;s Byzantium based poems. There is also a strong connection between the idea of retreating into the imagination found within Keats&#x27;s &quot;Lamia&quot; and in Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Palace of Art&quot;. The Preface, when added to the poem, connects the idea of the paradise as the imagination with the land of Porlock, and that the imagination, though infinite, would be interrupted by a &quot;person on business&quot;. The Preface then allows for Coleridge to leave the poem as a fragment, which represents the inability for the imagination to provide complete images or truly reflect reality. The poem would not be about the act of creation but a fragmentary view revealing how the act works: how the poet crafts language and how it relates to himself.

Through use of the imagination, the poem is able to discuss issues surrounding tyranny, war, and contrasts that exist within paradise. Part of the war motif could be a metaphor for the poet in a competitive struggle with the reader to push his own vision and ideas upon his audience. As a component to the idea of imagination in the poem is the creative process by describing a world that is of the imagination and another that is of understanding. The poet, in Coleridge&#x27;s system, is able to move from the world of understanding, where men normally are, and enter into the world of the imagination through poetry. When the narrator describes the &quot;ancestral voices prophesying war&quot;, the idea is part of the world of understanding, or the real world. As a whole, the poem is connected to Coleridge&#x27;s belief in a secondary Imagination that can lead a poet into a world of imagination, and the poem is both a description of that world and a description of how the poet enters the world. The imagination, as it appears in many of Coleridge&#x27;s and Wordsworth&#x27;s works, including &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;, is discussed through the metaphor of water, and the use of the river in &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; is connected to the use of the stream in Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;The Prelude&quot;. The water imagery is also related to the divine and nature, and the poet is able to tap into nature in a way Kubla Khan cannot to harness its power.

=== The nature of paradise ===
Although the land is one of man-made &quot;pleasure&quot;, there is a natural, &quot;sacred&quot; river that runs past it. The lines describing the river have a markedly different rhythm from the rest of the passage. The land is constructed as a garden, but like Eden after Man&#x27;s fall, Xanadu is isolated by walls. The finite properties of the constructed walls of Xanadu are contrasted with the infinite properties of the natural caves through which the river runs. The poem expands on the gothic hints of the first stanza as the narrator explores the dark chasm in the midst of Xanadu&#x27;s gardens, and describes the surrounding area as both &quot;savage&quot; and &quot;holy&quot;. Yarlott interprets this chasm as symbolic of the poet struggling with decadence that ignores nature. It may also represent the dark side of the soul, the dehumanising effect of power and dominion. Fountains are often symbolic of the inception of life, and in this case may represent forceful creativity. Since this fountain ends in death, it may also simply represent the life span of a human, from violent birth to a sinking end. Yarlott argues that the war represents the penalty for seeking pleasure, or simply the confrontation of the present by the past. Though the exterior of Xanadu is presented in images of darkness, and in context of the dead sea, we are reminded of the &quot;miracle&quot; and &quot;pleasure&quot; of Kubla Khan&#x27;s creation. The vision of the sites, including the dome, the cavern, and the fountain, are similar to an apocalyptic vision. Together, the natural and man-made structures form a miracle of nature as they represent the mixing of opposites together, the essence of creativity. In the third stanza, the narrator turns prophetic, referring to a vision of an unidentified &quot;Abyssinian maid&quot; who sings of &quot;Mount Abora&quot;. Harold Bloom suggests that this passage reveals the narrator&#x27;s desire to rival Khan&#x27;s ability to create with his own. The woman may also refer to Mnemosyne, the Greek personification of memory and mother of the muses, referring directly to Coleridge&#x27;s claimed struggle to compose this poem from memory of a dream. The subsequent passage refers to unnamed witnesses who may also hear this, and thereby share in the narrator&#x27;s vision of a replicated, ethereal, Xanadu. Harold Bloom suggests that the power of the poetic imagination, stronger than nature or art, fills the narrator and grants him the ability to share this vision with others through his poetry. The narrator would thereby be elevated to an awesome, almost mythical status, as one who has experienced an Edenic paradise available only to those who have similarly mastered these creative powers.

In the tradition from which Coleridge drew, the Tatars ruled by Kubla Khan were depicted as uncivilized worshippers of the sun, connected to either the Cain or Ham line of outcasts. In the tradition Coleridge relies on, the Tatar worship the sun because it reminds them of paradise, and they build gardens because they want to recreate paradise. The Tatars are connected to the Judaeo Christian ideas of Original Sin and Eden: Kubla Khan is of the line of Cain and fallen, but he wants to overcome that state and rediscover paradise by creating an enclosed garden. The place was described in negative terms and seen as an inferior representation of paradise, and Coleridge&#x27;s ethical system did not connect pleasure with joy or the divine. However, Coleridge describes Khan in a peaceful light and as a man of genius. He seeks to show his might but does so by building his own version of paradise. The description and the tradition provide a contrast between the daemonic and genius within the poem, and Khan is a ruler who is unable to recreate Eden.

The dome, as described in &quot;The History of Hindostan&quot;, was related to nature worship as it reflects the shape of the universe. Coleridge believed in a connection between nature and the divine but believed that the only dome that should serve as the top of a temple was the sky. He thought that a dome was an attempt to hide from the ideal and escape into a private creation, and Kubla Khan&#x27;s dome is a flaw that keeps him from truly connecting to nature. Purchas&#x27;s work does not mention a dome but a &quot;house of pleasure&quot;. The use of dome instead of house or palace could represent the most artificial of constructs and reinforce the idea that the builder was separated from nature. However, Coleridge did believe that a dome could be positive if it was connected to religion, but the Khan&#x27;s dome was one of immoral pleasure and a purposeless life dominated by sensuality and pleasure.

==Critical response==
The reception of &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; has changed substantially over time. Initial reactions to the poem were lukewarm, despite praise from notable figures like Lord Byron and Walter Scott. The work went through multiple editions, but the poem, as with his others published in 1816 and 1817, had poor sales. Initial reviewers saw some aesthetic appeal in the poem, but considered it unremarkable overall. As critics began to consider Coleridge&#x27;s body of work as whole, however, &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; was increasingly singled out for praise. Positive evaluation of the poem in the 19th and early 20th centuries treated it as a purely aesthetic object, to be appreciated for its evocative sensory experience. Later criticism continued to appreciate the poem, but no longer considered it as transcending concrete meaning, instead interpreting it as a complex statement on poetry itself and the nature of individual genius.

=== During Coleridge&#x27;s lifetime ===
Literary reviews at the time of the collection&#x27;s first publication generally dismissed it. At the time of the poem&#x27;s publication, a new generation of critical magazines, including &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Edinburgh Magazine&quot;, &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, and &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, had been established, with critics who were more provocative than those of the previous generation. These critics were hostile to Coleridge due to a difference of political views, and due to a puff piece written by Byron about the &quot;Christabel&quot; publication. The first of the negative reviews was written by William Hazlitt, literary critic and Romantic writer, who criticized the fragmentary nature of the work. Hazlitt said that the poem &quot;comes to no conclusion&quot; and that &quot;from an excess of capacity, [Coleridge] does little or nothing&quot; with his material. The only positive quality which Hazlitt notes is a certain aesthetic appeal: he says &quot;we could repeat these lines to ourselves not the less often for not knowing the meaning of them,&quot; revealing that &quot;Mr Coleridge can write better &quot;nonsense&quot; verse than any man in English.&quot; As other reviews continued to be published in 1816, they, too, were lukewarm at best. The poem received limited praise for &quot;some playful thoughts and fanciful imagery,&quot; and was said to &quot;have much of the Oriental richness and harmony&quot; but was generally considered unremarkable.

These early reviews generally accepted Coleridge&#x27;s story of composing the poem in a dream, but dismissed its relevance, and observed that many others have had similar experiences. More than one review suggested that the dream had not merited publication. One reviewer questioned whether Coleridge had really dreamed his composition, suggesting that instead he likely wrote it rapidly upon waking.

More positive appraisals of the poem began to emerge when Coleridge&#x27;s contemporaries evaluated his body of work overall. In October 1821, Leigh Hunt singled out Kubla Khan as one of Coleridge&#x27;s best works, praising the poem&#x27;s evocative, dreamlike beauty. An 1830 review of Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Poetical Works&quot; similarly praised for its &quot;melodious versification,&quot; describing it as &quot;perfect music.&quot; An 1834 review, published shortly after Coleridge&#x27;s death, also praised &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;s musicality. These three later assessments of &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; responded more positively to Coleridge&#x27;s description of composing the poem in a dream, as an additional facet of the poetry.

=== Victorian period ===
Victorian critics praised the poem and some examined aspects of the poem&#x27;s background. John Sheppard, in his analysis of dreams titled &quot;On Dreams&quot; (1847), lamented Coleridge&#x27;s drug use as getting in the way of his poetry but argued: &quot;It is probable, since he writes of having taken an &#x27;anodyne,&#x27; that the &#x27;vision in a dream&#x27; arose under some excitement of that same narcotic; but this does not destroy, even as to his particular case, the evidence for a wonderfully inventive action of the mind in sleep; for, whatever were the exciting cause, the fact remains the same&quot;. Hall Caine, in his 1883 survey of the original critical response to &quot;Christabel&quot; and &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;, praised the poem and declared: &quot;It must surely be allowed that the adverse criticism on &#x27;Christabel&#x27; and &#x27;Kubla Khan&#x27; which is here quoted is outside all tolerant treatment, whether of raillery or of banter. It is difficult to attribute such false verdict to pure and absolute ignorance. Even when we make all due allowance for the prejudices of critics whose only possible enthusiasm went out to &#x27;the pointed and fine propriety of Poe,&#x27; we can hardly believe that the exquisite art which is among the most valued on our possessions could encounter so much garrulous abuse without the criminal intervention of personal malignancy.&quot; In a review of H. D. Traill&#x27;s analysis of Coleridge in the &quot;English Men of Letters&quot;, an anonymous reviewer wrote in the 1885 &quot;Westminster Review&quot;: &quot;Of &#x27;Kubla Khan,&#x27; Mr. Traill writes: &#x27;As to the wild dream-poem &#x27;Kubla Khan,&#x27; it is hardly more than a psychological curiosity, and only that perhaps in respect of the completeness of its metrical form.&#x27; Lovers of poetry think otherwise, and listen to these wonderful lines as the voice of Poesy itself.&quot;

Critics at the end of the 19th century favoured the poem and placed it as one of Coleridge&#x27;s best works. When discussing &quot;Christabel&quot;, &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; and &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;, an anonymous reviewer in the October 1893 &quot;The Church Quarterly Review&quot; wrote, &quot;In these poems Coleridge achieves a mastery of language and rhythm which is nowhere else conspicuously evident in him.&quot; In 1895, Andrew Lang reviewed the &quot;Letters of Coleridge&quot; in addition to Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;, &quot;Christabel&quot; and &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, saying: &quot;all these poems are &#x27;miraculous;&#x27; all seem to have been &#x27;given&#x27; by the dreaming &#x27;subconscious self&#x27; of Coleridge. The earliest pieces hold no promise of these marvels. They come from what is oldest in Coleridge&#x27;s nature, his uninvited and irrepressible intuition, magical and rare, vivid beyond common sight of common things, sweet beyond sound of things heard.&quot; G E Woodberry, in 1897, said that &quot;Christabel&quot;, &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, and &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; &quot;are the marvelous creations of his genius. In these it will be said there is both a world of nature new created, and a dramatic method and interest. It is enough for the purpose of the analysis if it be granted that nowhere else in Coleridge&#x27;s work, except in these and less noticeably in a few other instances, do these high characteristics occur.&quot; In speaking of the three poems, he stated they &quot;have besides that wealth of beauty in detail, of fine diction, of liquid melody, of sentiment, thought, and image, which belong only to poetry of the highest order, and which are too obvious to require any comment. &#x27;Kubla Khan&#x27; is a poem of the same kind, in which the mystical effect is given almost wholly by landscape.&quot;

=== 1920s–30s ===
The 1920s contained analysis of the poem that emphasised the poem&#x27;s power. In &quot;Road to Xanadu&quot; (1927), a book length study of &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; and &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;, John Livingston Lowes said that the poems were &quot;two of the most remarkable poems in English&quot;. When turning to the background of the works, he argued, &quot;Coleridge as Coleridge, be it said at once, is a secondary moment to our purpose; it is the significant process, not the man, which constitutes our theme. But the amazing &quot;modus operandi&quot; of his genius, in the fresh light which I hope I have to offer, becomes the very abstract and brief chronicle of the procedure of the creative faculty itself.&quot; After breaking down the various aspects of the poem, Lowes stated, &quot;with a picture of unimpaired and thrilling vividness, the fragment ends. And with it ends, for all save Coleridge, the dream. &#x27;The earth hath bubbles as the water has, and this is of them.&#x27; For &#x27;Kubla Khan&#x27; is as near enchantment, I suppose, as we are like to come in this dull world. And over it is cast the glamour, enhanced beyond all reckoning in the dream, of the remote in time and space – that visionary presence of a vague and gorgeous and mysterious Past which brooded, as Coleridge read, above the inscrutable Nile, and domed pavilions in Cashmere, and the vanished stateliness of Xanadu.&quot; He continued by describing the power of the poem: &quot;For none of the things which we have seen – dome, river, chasm, fountain, caves of ice, or floating hair – nor any combination of them holds the secret key to that sense of an incommunicable witchery which pervades the poem. That is something more impalpable by far, into which entered who can tell what traceless, shadowy recollections...The poem is steeped in the wonder of all Coleridge&#x27;s enchanted voyagings.&quot; Lowes then concluded about the two works: &quot;Not even in the magical four and fifty lines of &#x27;Kubla Khan&#x27; is sheer visualizing energy so intensely exercised as in &#x27;The Ancient Mariner.&#x27; But every crystal-clear picture there, is an integral part of a preconceived and consciously elaborated whole...In &#x27;Kubla Khan&#x27; the linked and interweaving images irresponsibly and gloriously stream, like the pulsing, fluctuating banners of the North. And their pageant is as aimless as it is magnificent...There is, then...one glory of &#x27;Kubla Khan&#x27; and another glory of &#x27;The Ancient Mariner,&#x27; as one star differeth from another star in glory.&quot; George Watson, in 1966, stated that Lowes&#x27;s analysis of the poems &quot;will stand as a permanent monument to historical criticism.&quot; Also in 1966, Kenneth Burke, declared, &quot;Count me among those who would view this poem both as a marvel, and as &#x27;in principle&#x27; &quot;finished&quot;.&quot;
T. S. Eliot attacked the reputation of &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; and sparked a dispute within literary criticism with his analysis of the poem in his essay &quot;Origin and Uses of Poetry&quot; from &quot;The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism&quot; (1933): &quot;The way in which poetry is written is not, so far as our knowledge of these obscure matters as yet extends, any clue to its value...The faith in mystical inspiration is responsible for the exaggerated repute of &#x27;Kubla Khan&#x27;. The imagery of that fragment, certainly, whatever its origins in Coleridge&#x27;s reading, sank to the depths of Coleridge&#x27;s feeling, was saturated, transformed there...and brought up into daylight again.&quot; He goes on to explain, &quot;But it is not &quot;used&quot;: the poem has not been written. A single verse is not poetry unless it is a one-verse poem; and even the finest line draws its life from its context. Organization is necessary as well as &#x27;inspiration&#x27;. The re-creation of word and image which happens fitfully in the poetry of such a poet as Coleridge happens almost incessantly with Shakespeare.&quot; Geoffrey Yarlott, in 1967, responds to Eliot to say, &quot;Certainly, the enigmatic personages who appear in the poem...and the vaguely incantatory proper names...appear to adumbrate rather than crystalize the poet&#x27;s intention. Yet, though generally speaking intentions in poetry are nothing save as &#x27;realized&#x27;, we are unable to ignore the poem, despite Mr Eliot&#x27;s strictures on its &#x27;exaggerated repute&#x27;.&quot; He continued, &quot;We may question without end &quot;what&quot; it means, but few of us question if the poem is worth the trouble, or whether the meaning is worth the having. While the feeling persists that there is something there which is profoundly important, the challenge to elucidate it proves irresistible.&quot; However, Lilian Furst, in 1969, countered Yarlott to argue that, &quot;T. S. Eliot&#x27;s objection to the exaggerated repute of the surrealist &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; is not unjustified. Moreover, the customary criticism of Coleridge as a cerebral poet would seem to be borne out by those poems such as &quot;This Lime-tree Bower my Prison&quot; or &quot;The Pains of Sleep&quot;, which tend more towards a direct statement than an imaginative presentation of personal dilemma.&quot;

=== 1940s–60s ===
During the 1940s and 1950s, critics focused on the technique of the poem and how it relates to the meaning. In 1941, G. W. Knight wrote that &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; &quot;needs no defence. It has a barbaric and oriental magnificence that asserts itself with a happy power and authenticity too often absent from visionary poems set within the Christian tradition.&quot; Humphrey House, in 1953, praised the poem and said of beginning of the poem: &quot;The whole passage is full of life because the verse has both the needed energy and the needed control. The combination of energy and control in the rhythm and sound is so great&quot; and that Coleridge&#x27;s words &quot;convey so fully the sense of inexhaustible energy, now falling now rising, but persisting through its own pulse&quot;. Also in 1953, Elisabeth Schneider dedicated her book to analysing the various aspects of the poem, including the various sound techniques. When discussing the quality of the poem, she wrote, &quot;I sometimes think we overwork Coleridge&#x27;s idea of &#x27;the balance or reconciliation of opposite or discordant qualities.&#x27; I have to come back to it here, however, for the particular flavor of &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;, with its air of mystery, is describable in part through that convenient phrase. Yet, the &#x27;reconciliation&#x27; does not quite occur either. It is in fact avoided. What we have instead is the very spirit of &#x27;oscillation&#x27; itself.&quot; Continuing, she said, &quot;The poem is the soul of ambivalence, oscillation&#x27;s very self; and that is probably its deepest meaning. In creating this effect, form and matter are intricately woven. The irregular and inexact rhymes and varied lengths of the lines play some part. More important is the musical effect in which a smooth, rather swift forward movement is emphasized by the relation of grammatical structure to line and rhyme, yet is impeded and thrown back upon itself even from the beginning&quot;. She then concluded: &quot;Here in these interwoven oscillations dwells the magic, the &#x27;dream,&#x27; and the air of mysterious meaning of &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;. I question whether this effect was all deliberately out by Coleridge, though it might have been. It is possibly half-inherent in his subject...What remains is the spirit of &#x27;oscillation,&#x27; perfectly poeticized, and possibly ironically commemorative of the author.&quot; Following in 1959, John Beer described the complex nature of the poem: &quot;&#x27;Kubla Khan&#x27; the poem is not a meaningless reverie, but a poem so packed with meaning as to render detailed elucidation extremely difficult.&quot; In responding to House, Beer wrote, &quot;That there is an image of energy in the fountain may be accepted: but I cannot agree that it is creative energy of the highest type.&quot;

Critics of the 1960s focused on the reputation of the poem and how it compared to Coleridge&#x27;s other poems. In 1966, Virginia Radley considered Wordsworth and his sister as an important influence to Coleridge writing a great poem: &quot;Almost daily social intercourse with this remarkable brother and sister seemed to provide the catalyst to greatness, for it is during this period that Coleridge conceived his greatest poems, &#x27;Christabel,&#x27; &#x27;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,&#x27; and &#x27;Kubla Khan,&#x27; poems so distinctive and so different from his others that many generations of readers know Coleridge solely through them.&quot; She latter added that &quot;Of all the poems Coleridge wrote, three are beyond compare. These three, &#x27;The Ancient Mariner,&#x27; &#x27;Christabel,&#x27; and &#x27;Kubla Khan,&#x27; produced an aura which defies definition, but which might be properly be called one of &#x27;natural magic.&#x27;&quot; What sets apart the poem from the others is its &quot;verbal enactment of the creative process&quot; which makes it &quot;unique even among the three poems of high imagination.&quot; To Radley, &quot;the poem is skilfully wrought, as are all the poems of high imagination. The opposites within it are diverse and effectively so. In tone, the poem juxtaposes quiet with noise...Action presents its contrasts also...These seemingly antithetical images combine to demonstrate the proximity of the known and the unknown worlds, the two worlds of Understanding and Imagination.&quot; In concluding about the poem, she argued, &quot;In truth, there are other &#x27;Fears in Solitude&#x27; than that written by Coleridge and there are other &#x27;Frosts at Midnight&#x27;; but there are no other &#x27;Ancient Mariners&#x27; or &#x27;Kubla Khans,&#x27; nor are there likely to be. In evaluating Coleridge&#x27;s poetry, it can readily be seen and accepted that for the poems of high imagination his reputation is eternally made.&quot;

In the same year as Radley, George Watson argued that &quot;The case of &#x27;Kubla Khan&#x27; is perhaps the strangest of all – a poem that stands high even in English poetry as a work of ordered perfection is offered by the poet himself, nearly twenty years after its composition, as a fragment. Anyone can accept that a writer&#x27;s head should be full of projects he will never fulfil, and most writers are cautious enough not to set them down; Coleridge, rashly, did set them down, so that his very fertility has survived as evidence of infertility.&quot; He later argued that the poem &quot;is probably the most original poem about poetry in English, and the first hint outside his notebooks and letters that a major critic lies hidden in the twenty-five-year-old Coleridge.&quot; In conclusion about the poem, Watson stated, &quot;The triumph of &#x27;Kubla Khan,&#x27; perhaps, lies in its evasions: it hints so delicately at critical truths while demonstrating them so boldly. The contrasts between the two halves of the poem...So bold, indeed, that Coleridge for once was able to dispense with any language out of the past. It was his own poem, a manifesto. To read it now, with the hindsight of another age, is to feel premonitions of the critical achievement to come...But the poem is in advance, not just of these, but in all probability of any critical statement that survives. It may be that it stands close to the moment of discovery itself.&quot; After responding to Eliot&#x27;s claims about &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;, Yarlott, in 1967, argued that &quot;few of us question if the poem is worth the trouble&quot; before explaining that &quot;The ambiguities inherent in the poem pose a special problem of critical approach. If we restrict ourselves to what is &#x27;given&#x27;, appealing to the poem as a &#x27;whole&#x27;, we shall fail probably to resolves its various cruxes. Hence, there is a temptation to look for &#x27;external&#x27; influences ... The trouble with all these approaches is that they tend finally to lead &quot;away&quot; from the poem itself.&quot; When describing specifics, he argued, &quot;The rhythmical development of the stanza, too, though technically brilliant, evokes admiration rather than delight. The unusually heavy stresses and abrupt masculine rhymes impose a slow and sonorous weightiness upon the movement of the iambic octosyllabics which is quite in contrast, say, to the light fast metre of the final stanza where speed of movement matches buoyancy of tone.&quot; Following in 1968, Walter Jackson Bate called the poem &quot;haunting&quot; and said that it was &quot;so unlike anything else in English&quot;.

=== 1970s–present ===
Criticism during the 1970s and 1980s emphasised the importance of the Preface while praising the work. Norman Fruman, in 1971, argued: &quot;To discuss &#x27;Kubla Khan&#x27; as one might any other great poem would be an exercise in futility. For a century and a half its status has been unique, a masterpiece &quot;sui generis&quot;, embodying interpretive problems wholly its own...It would not be excessive to say that no small part of the extraordinary fame of &#x27;Kubla Khan&#x27; inheres in its alleged marvellous conception. Its Preface is world-famous and has been used in many studies of the creative process as a signal instance in which a poem has come to us directly from the unconscious.&quot;

In 1981, Kathleen Wheeler contrasts the Crewe Manuscript note with the Preface: &quot;Contrasting this relatively factual, literal, and dry account of the circumstances surrounding the birth of the poem with the actual published preface, one illustrates what the latter is not: it is not a literal, dry, factual account of this sort, but a highly literary piece of composition, providing the verse with a certain mystique.&quot; In 1985, David Jasper praised the poem as &quot;one of his greatest meditations on the nature of poetry and poetic creation&quot; and argued &quot;it is through irony, also, as it unsettles and undercuts, that the fragment becomes a Romantic literary form of such importance, nowhere more so than in &#x27;Kubla Khan&#x27;.&quot; When talking about the Preface, Jasper asserted that it &quot;profoundly influenced the way in which the poem has been understood&quot;. Responding in part to Wheeler in 1986, Charles Rzepka analysed the relationship between the poet and the audience of the poem while describing &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; as one of &quot;Coleridge&#x27;s three great poems of the supernatural&quot;. He continued by discussing the preface: &quot;despite its obvious undependability as a guide to the actual process of the poem&#x27;s composition, the preface can still, in Wheeler&#x27;s words, lead us &#x27;to ponder why Coleridge chose to write a preface...&#x27; What the preface describes, of course, is not the actual process by which the poem came into being, but an analogue of poetic creation as &quot;logos&quot;, a divine &#x27;decree&#x27; or fiat which transforms the Word into the world.&quot;

During the 1990s, critics continued to praise the poem with many critics placing emphasis on what the Preface adds to the poem. David Perkins, in 1990, argued that &quot;Coleridge&#x27;s introductory note to &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; weaves together two myths with potent imaginative appeal. The myth of the lost poem tells how an inspired work was mysteriously given to the poet and dispelled irrecoverably.&quot; Also in 1990, Thomas McFarland stated, &quot;Judging by the number and variety of critical effort to interpret their meaning, there may be no more palpably symbolic poems in all of English literature than &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; and &quot;The Ancient Mariner&quot;.&quot; In 1996, Rosemary Ashton stated that the poem was &quot;one of the most famous poems in the language&quot; and claimed the Preface as &quot;the most famous, but probably not the most accurate, preface in literary history.&quot; Richard Holmes, in 1998, declared the importance of the poem&#x27;s Preface while describing the reception of the 1816 volume of poems: &quot;However, no contemporary critic saw the larger possible significance of Coleridge&#x27;s Preface to &#x27;Kubla Khan&#x27;, though it eventually became one of the most celebrated, and disputed, accounts of poetic composition ever written. Like the letter from the fictional &#x27;friend&#x27; in the &quot;Biographia&quot;, it brilliantly suggests how a compressed fragment came to represent a much larger (and even more mysterious) act of creation&quot;.

In 2002, J. C. C. Mays pointed out that &quot;Coleridge&#x27;s claim to be a great poet lies in the continued pursuit of the consequences of &#x27;The Ancient Mariner,&#x27; &#x27;Christabel&#x27; and &#x27;Kubla Khan&#x27; on several levels.&quot; Adam Sisman, in 2006, questioned the nature of the poem itself: &quot;No one even knows whether it is complete; Coleridge describes it as a &#x27;fragment,&#x27; but there is a case for doubting this. Maybe it is not a poem at all. Hazlitt called it &#x27;a musical composition&#x27;...Though literary detectives have uncovered some of its sources, it remains difficult to say what the poem is about.&quot; In describing the merits of the poem and its fragmentary state, he said, &quot;The poem stands for itself: beautiful, sensuous and enigmatic.&quot; During the same year, Jack Stillinger wrote that &quot;Coleridge wrote only a few poems of the first rank – perhaps no more than a dozen, all told – and he seems to have taken a very casual attitude toward them...he kept &#x27;Kubla Khan&#x27; in manuscript for nearly twenty years before offering it to the public &#x27;rather as a psychological curiosity, than on the grounds of any supposed &quot;poetic&quot; merits&#x27;&quot;. Harold Bloom, in 2010, argued that Coleridge wrote two kinds of poems and that &quot;The daemonic group, necessarily more famous, is the triad of &quot;The Ancient Mariner&quot;, &quot;Christabel&quot;, and &#x27;Kubla Khan.&#x27;&quot; He goes on to explain the &quot;daemonic&quot;: &quot;Opium was the avenging daemon or &quot;alastor&quot; of Coleridge&#x27;s life, his dark or fallen angel, his experiential acquaintance with Milton&#x27;s Satan. Opium was for him what wandering and moral tale-telling became for the Mariner – the personal shape of repetition compulsion. The lust for paradise in &#x27;Kubla Khan,&#x27; Geraldine&#x27;s lust for Christabel – these are manifestations of Coleridge&#x27;s revisionary daemonization of Milton, these are Coleridge&#x27;s countersublime. Poetic genius, the genial spirit itself, Coleridge must see as daemonic when it is his own rather than when it is Milton&#x27;s.&quot;

== Musical settings ==
Excerpts from the poem have been put to music by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, Granville Bantock, Humphrey Searle, and Paul Turok; and Charles Tomlinson Griffes composed an orchestral tone poem in 1912 (revised 1916).

Canadian rock band Rush refers to the poem directly in the 1977 song &quot;Xanadu&quot;, in which the narrator finds the site, obtains immortality after having &quot;drunk the milk of Paradise&quot; but goes mad after a thousand years, finding time stopped outside and himself unable to leave.

British band Frankie Goes to Hollywood alludes to the poem in the song &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot; from its eponymous 1984 debut album. However, they altered the quoted wording to &quot;In Xanadu did Kublai Khan a pleasuredome erect&quot;.

German band Blind Guardian makes several references to the poem in the lyrics of their song &quot;Sacred Mind&quot; on their 2015 concept album &quot;Beyond the Red Mirror&quot;, and the associated page in the album book includes the following quote: &quot;Then all the charm is broken - all that phantom-world so fair Vanishes, and a thousand circlets spread&quot;. Within the story, Xanadu or the pleasure-dome is a temptation intended to mislead the hero on his journey, and the last obstacle he must overcome before reaching the Red Mirror.

<text>Kashubian () or Cassubian (; ; ) is a West Slavic language belonging to the Lechitic subgroup.

In Poland, it has been an officially recognized ethnic-minority language since 2005. Approximately 87,600 people use mainly Kashubian at home. It is the only remnant of the Pomeranian language. It is close to standard Polish with influence from Low German and the extinct Polabian (West Slavic) and Old Prussian (West Baltic) languages.

The Kashubian language exists in two different forms: vernacular dialects used in rural areas, and literary variants used in education.

==Origin==
Kashubian is assumed to have evolved from the language spoken by some tribes of Pomeranians called Kashubians, in the region of Pomerania, on the southern coast of the Baltic Sea between the Vistula and Oder rivers. It first began to evolve separately in the period from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century as the Polish-Pomeranian linguistic area began to divide based around important linguistic developments centred in the western (Kashubian) part of the area.

In the 19th century Florian Ceynowa became Kashubian&#x27;s first known activist. He undertook tremendous efforts to awaken Kashubian self-identity through the establishment of Kashubian language, customs, and traditions. He felt strongly that Poles were born brothers and that Kashubia was a separate nation.

The Young Kashubian movement followed in 1912, led by author and doctor Aleksander Majkowski, who wrote for the paper Zrzësz Kaszëbskô as part of the Zrzëszincë group. The group contributed significantly to the development of the Kashubian literary language.

The earliest printed documents in Polish with Kashubian elements date from the end of the 16th century. The modern orthography was first proposed in 1879.

===Related languages===
Many scholars and linguists debate whether Kashubian should be recognized as a Polish dialect or separate language. In terms of historical development Lechitic West Slavic language, but in terms of modern influence Polish is a prestige language. Kashubian is closely related to Slovincian, and both of them are dialects of Pomeranian. Many linguists, in Poland and elsewhere, consider it a divergent dialect of Polish. Dialectal diversity is so great within Kashubian that a speaker of southern dialects has considerable difficulty in understanding a speaker of northern dialects. The spelling and the grammar of Polish words written in Kashubian, which is most of its vocabulary, are highly unusual, making it difficult for native Polish speakers to comprehend written text in Kashubian.

Like Polish, Kashubian includes about 5% loanwords from German (such as &quot;&quot; &quot;art&quot;). Unlike Polish, these are mostly from Low German and only occasionally from High German. Other sources of loanwords include the Baltic languages.

==Speakers==
===Poland===
The number of speakers of Kashubian varies widely from source to source. In the 2021 census, approximately 87,600 people in Poland declared that they used Kashubian at home, a decrease from over 108,000 in the 2011 census. Of these, only 1,700 reported speaking exclusively in Kashubian within their homes, down from 3,800 in 2011. However, experts caution that changes in census methodology and the socio-political climate may have influenced these results. The number of people who can speak at least some Kashubian is higher, around 366,000. All Kashubian speakers are also fluent in Polish. A number of schools in Poland use Kashubian as a teaching language. It is an official alternative language for local administration purposes in Gmina Sierakowice, Gmina Linia, Gmina Parchowo, Gmina Luzino and Gmina Żukowo in the Pomeranian Voivodeship. Most respondents say that Kashubian is used in informal speech among family members and friends. This is most likely because Polish is the official language and spoken in formal settings.

===Americas===
During the Kashubian diaspora of 1855–1900, 115,700 Kashubians emigrated to North America, with around 15,000 emigrating to Brazil. Among the Polish community of Renfrew County, Ontario, Kashubian is widely spoken to this day, despite the use of more formal Polish by parish priests. In Winona, Minnesota, which Ramułt termed the &quot;Kashubian Capital of America&quot;, Kashubian was regarded as &quot;poor Polish,&quot; as opposed to the &quot;good Polish&quot; of the parish priests and teaching sisters. Consequently, Kashubian failed to survive Polonization and died out shortly after the mid-20th century.

==Literature==

Important for Kashubian literature was &quot;Xążeczka dlo Kaszebov&quot; by Florian Ceynowa (1817–1881). Hieronim Derdowski (1852–1902 in Winona, Minnesota) was another significant author who wrote in Kashubian, as was Aleksander Majkowski (1876–1938) from Kościerzyna, who wrote the Kashubian national epic &quot;The Life and Adventures of Remus&quot;. Jan Trepczyk was a poet who wrote in Kashubian, as was Stanisław Pestka. Kashubian literature has been translated into Czech, Polish, English, German, Belarusian, Slovene and Finnish. Aleksander Majkowski and Alojzy Nagel belong to the most commonly translated Kashubian authors of the 20th century. A considerable body of Christian literature has been translated into Kashubian, including the New Testament, much of it by Adam Ryszard Sikora (OFM). Franciszek Grucza graduated from a Catholic seminary in Pelplin. He was the first priest to introduce Catholic liturgy in Kashubian.

=== Works ===
The earliest recorded artifacts of Kashubian date back to the 15th century and include a book of spiritual psalms that were used to introduce Kashubian to the Lutheran church:

* &quot;Śpiewnik starokaszubski (Old Kashubian songbook)&quot;, published by Friedhelm Hinze, Berlin (East), 1967

==Education==
Throughout the communist period in Poland (1948-1989), Kashubian greatly suffered in education and social status. Kashubian was represented as folklore and prevented from being taught in schools. Following the collapse of communism, attitudes on the status of Kashubian have been gradually changing. It has been included in the program of school education in Kashubia although not as a language of teaching or as a required subject for every child, but as a foreign language taught 3 hours per week at parents&#x27; explicit request. Since 1991, it is estimated that there have been around 17,000 students in over 400 schools who have learned Kashubian. Kashubian has some limited usage on public radio and had on public television. Since 2005, Kashubian has enjoyed legal protection in Poland as an official regional language. It is the only language in Poland with that status, which was granted by the &quot;Act of 6 January 2005 on National and Ethnic Minorities and on the Regional Language&quot; of the Polish Parliament. The act provides for its use in official contexts in ten communes in which speakers are at least 20% of the population. The recognition means that heavily populated Kashubian localities have been able to have road signs and other amenities with Polish and Kashubian translations on them.

==Dialects==

Friedrich Lorentz wrote in the early 20th century that there were three main Kashubian dialects. These include the
* Northern Kashubian dialect 
* Middle Kashubian dialect
* Southern Kashubian dialect

Other researches would argue that each tiny region of the Kaszuby has its own dialect, as in &quot;Dialects and Slang of Poland&quot;: 
* Bylacki dialect
* Slowinski dialect 
* Kabatkow dialect
* Zaborski dialect 
* Tucholski and Krajniacki dialect (although both dialects would be considered a transitional form of the Wielkopolski dialect and are included as official Wielkopolskie dialects)

==Phonology==
The phonological system of the Kashubian language is similar in many ways to those of other Slavic languages. It is famous for Kaszëbienié (Kashubization) and has a large vowel inventory, with 9 oral vowels and 2 nasal vowels.

===Vowel length===
Friedrich Lorentz argued that northern dialects had contrastive vowel length, but later studies showed that any phonemic length distinctions had disappeared by 1900. Any other vowel length is used for expressive purposes or is the result of syllable stress. All traces of vowel length can now be seen in vowel alterations.

===Syllable stress===
Kashubian features free placement of stress, and in some cases, mobile stress, and in northern dialects, unstressed syllables can result in vowel reduction. An archaic word final stress is preserved in some two-syllable adjectives, adverbs, and regularly in the comparative degree of adverbs, in some infinitives and present and past tense forms, some nouns ending in &quot;-ô&quot;, in diminutives. ending in &quot;-ik&quot;/&quot;-yk&quot;, nouns formed with &quot;-c&quot; and &quot;-k&quot;, and some prepositional phrases with pronouns.

Stress mobility can be observed in nouns, where in the singular the stress is initial, but in the plural it&#x27;s on the final syllable of the stem, i.e. but , and in some verb forms, i.e. vs . Some dialects have merged &quot;ë&quot; with &quot;e&quot;, making the distinction contrastive. Most of this mobility is limited to morphology and stress has largely stabilized in Kashubian.

Northern and central dialects show a much more limited mobility, as northern dialects show stabilization on initial stress, and central shows constant distance between the stressed syllable and the initial syllable of the word. Proclitics such as prepositions, pronouns, and grammatical particles such as may take initial stress.

Eastern groups place accents on the penultimate syllable.

The difference between southern and northern dialects dates as far back as the 14th—15th century and is the result of changes to the Proto-Slavic vowel length system.

===Phonological processes from Proto-Slavic===
# Retention of softness before &quot;-ar-&quot;: Kashubian vs Polish 
# Proto-Slavic &quot;*-ъl-&quot;/&quot;*-ьl-&quot; -&gt; &quot;-ôł-&quot;: Kashubian vs Polish 
## This change is somewhat archaic or lexicalized, appearing more in the North.
# TelT -&gt; TłoT: Kashubian vs Polish 
# Retention of TarT, especially in the North: Kashubian vs Polish 
## This feature is not regular and is somewhat archaic, even giving rise to archaizing neologisms such as Kashubian (from Kashubian ).
# Labialization of initial &quot;o-&quot;: Kashubian vs Polish 
# So-called Kaszëbienié (Kashubization), Proto-Slavic soft &quot;t&quot;/&quot;d&quot;/&quot;s&quot;/&quot;z&quot; initially to and finally to : Kashubian vs Polish , Kashubian vs Polish , Kashubian vs Polish , Kashubian vs Polish 
## This process occurred differently in the West, where soft ć/dź went to t/d
# Initial &quot;ra-&quot; -&gt; &quot;re-&quot; and &quot;ja-&quot; -&gt; &quot;je-&quot;, however modern forms usually retain &quot;-a-&quot; Kashubian vs Polish , Kashubian vs Polish 
# Irregular change of &quot;-ar-&quot; -&gt; &quot;-er-&quot;, Kashubian alongside Kashubian (from Kashubian ), vs Polish (from Polish ).
# Regional retention of medial &quot;-t-&quot; in the word Kashubian (&quot;seven&quot;) vs Polish (compare Masurian Polish ).
# Loss of mobile &quot;e&quot; through analysis of declined forms: Kashubian (genitive singular Kashubian ) vs Polish (genitive singular Polish , Kashubian (genitive plural of Kashubian ) vs Polish (genitive plural of Polish )
# An ablaut of &quot;e&quot;:&quot;&#x27;o&quot; after a soft consonant but before hard dentals: Kashubian (first person present singular Kashubian ) vs Polish (first person present singular Polish ).
## This ablaut may occur also through analogy, i.e. Kashubian (past virile l form of Kashubian ), vs Polish .
# Proto-Slavic &quot;ř&quot; -&gt; rz : Kashubian vs Polish (where rz in Polish is pronounced as a fricative ) 
# &quot;-dz-&quot; -&gt; &quot;-z-&quot;: Kashubian vs Polish 
## This feature is chiefly Northern, and often forms with &quot;-dz-&quot; dominate.
# Lengthening (now a qualitative change) vowels of word-final closed syllables ending with an etymologically voiced consonant: Kashubian (genitive singular Kashubian vs Polish (genitive singular Polish , Kashubian but Kashubian (past feminine and masculine l-forms of Kashubian ) vs Polish /Polish , Kashubian (genitive singular of Kashubian ) vs Polish /Polish , Kashubian (genitive singular of Kashubian ) vs Polish (genitive singular of Polish ), Kashubian (genitive singular of Kashubian ) vs Polish (genitive singular of Polish ), Kashubian (genitive singular of Kashubian ) vs Polish (genitive singular of Polish ). Compare Old Polish phonology.
# Proto-Slavic &quot;*ę&quot; -&gt; Early Kashubian &quot;į&quot; -&gt; &quot;i&quot;: Kashubian vs Polish 
## This change was also effected by the change causing &quot;i&quot;:&quot;ë&quot; ablaut
# As a result of &quot;Kaszëbienié&quot;, short &quot;i&quot; -&gt; &quot;ë&quot; after &quot;s, z, c, dz&quot;: Kashubian vs Polish 
# Short &quot;y&quot;/&quot;i&quot; after hard consonants -&gt; &quot;ë&quot;: Kashubian vs Polish 
# Soft &quot;k&quot;/&quot;g&quot; -&gt; &quot;cz&quot;/&quot;dż&quot; or sometimes &quot;ć&quot;/&quot;dź&quot;: Kashubian vs Polish , Kashubian (genitive singular or nominative/accusative plural of Kashubian ) vs Polish (genitive singular or nominative/accusative plural of Polish )
# &quot;Bëlaczenié&quot; in northern dialects, i.e. &quot;ł&quot; -&gt; &quot;l&quot;: Kashubian vs Polish 
# Hardening of &quot;ń&quot; -&gt; &quot;n&quot; is southern Kashubian: Kashubian (usually Kashubian ) vs Polish 
# Dissimilation of some consonant cluster such as &quot;kt&quot; -&gt; &quot;cht&quot; or &quot;srz/zrz&quot; -&gt; &quot;strz/zdrz&quot;: Kashubian vs Polish and Kashubian vs Polish .
# Reduction of some consonant clusters, especially in frequent words: Kashubian vs Polish 
# Prothesis, particularly the insertion of &quot;j-&quot; before word initial &quot;i-&quot;: Kashubian vs Polish 
## Regional insertion of &quot;h-&quot; before word initial &quot;a-&quot;: Kashubian vs Polish 

===Vowels===

* The exact phonetic realization of the close-mid vowels depends on the dialect.
* Apart from these, there are also nasal vowels . Their exact phonetic realization depends on the dialect.
* diphthongize to after &quot;p&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, and &quot;ch&quot;.

===Consonants===
Kashubian has simple consonants with a secondary articulation along with complex ones with secondary articulation.

* are palato-alveolar.
* are alveolo-palatal; the last four appear only in some dialects.
* The fricative trill is now used only by some northern and northeastern speakers; other speakers realize it as flat postalveolar .
* The labialized velar central approximant is realized as a velarized denti-alveolar lateral approximant by older speakers of southeastern dialects.

===Voicing and devoicing===
Kashubian features the same system of voicing assimilation as standard Polish.

===Vocabulary===
German has been the source for most loanwords in Kashubian, with an estimated 5% of the vocabulary, as opposed to 3% in Polish.

Kashubian, like other Slavic languages, has a rich system of derivational morphology, with prefixes, suffixes, deverbals, compounds, among others.

<text>Richard Kim Milford (February 7, 1951 – June 16, 1988), known professionally as Kim Milford, was an American actor, singer-songwriter, and composer. He was known for his stage acting in musicals such as &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; and &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;.

==Early years==
Born in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, Milford grew up in Winnetka, Illinois. His older sister, Penelope, also became an actress. Milford attended New Trier High School.

==Career==
===Acting===
Milford first appeared at the stock theatre in Chicago at age 10. In 1971, he appeared at The Kennedy Center in Leonard Bernstein’s &quot;Mass&quot;. Age 17, he was in the original stage version of &quot;Hair&quot; on Broadway, playing Woof and Claude. In 1976, he was awarded the Faith and Freedom Award by the Religious Heritage of America for his portrayal of the Prodigal Son in &quot;Round Trip&quot;. Milford later performed in the first concert tour of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; playing Jesus and Judas. He also appeared in the original American production of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; as Rocky with the Los Angeles Roxy Cast and in the Broadway production. He reprised his role in the 1980 North American Tour production. He also appeared in the plays &quot;Henry Sweet Henry&quot; (1967), &quot;Your Own Thing&quot;, &quot;Rockabye Hamlet&quot; (1975–76), &quot;More Than You Deserve&quot;, &quot;Sunset&quot;, and &quot;All Bets Off&quot;.

In addition to stage work, Milford appeared in the 1975 television movies &quot;Song of the Succubus&quot; and &quot;Rock-a-Die-Baby&quot; (also known as &quot;Night of the Full Moon&quot;) in which he performed music with his band Moon. During the 1970s and 1980s, he had guest roles on &quot;The Mod Squad&quot; and &quot;Mannix&quot; and &quot;The Highwayman&quot;, and starred in the 1978 feature film &quot;Laserblast&quot; and appeared in &quot;Corvette Summer&quot; alongside Mark Hamill. He also had a recurring role as Tommy on the soap opera &quot;The Secret Storm&quot;.

===Music===
Milford briefly became vocalist for Beck, Bogert &amp; Appice, billed as The Jeff Beck Group, for six performances between July 24 to August 8, 1972. It was billed as the Jeff Beck Group, because, at the time, the band also included holdover Max Middleton on piano. Following Middleton&#x27;s departure and Milford&#x27;s firing, the trio was known as Beck, Bogert &amp; Appice (Middleton joined the British band Hummingbird). Milford was also the front man for his own band Moon who were co-writers on songs such as &quot;Lovin&#x27; Lady&quot;, &quot;Jo Anna&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s Puttin&#x27; Me Through Changes&quot;. According to an interview in &quot;Viva&quot;, Milford recorded an album &quot;Chain Your Lovers to the Bedposts&quot; and a single &quot;Help Is on the Way, Rozea&quot; released in 1974. He recorded the single &quot;Muddy River Water&quot; for (Decca Records), the &quot;Sunset&quot; soundtrack and appeared on the Roxy cast album of &quot;Rocky Horror Show&quot;.

Milford composed the music for &quot;Salome&quot;, based on the Oscar Wilde play and starred in it at Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles in 1979. He wrote and performed &quot;My Love Is a Rebel&quot; on the soundtrack of &quot;Limbo&quot;, starring Barry Bostwick. His song &quot;Justice&quot; appeared on the &quot;Ciao! Manhattan&quot; soundtrack.

==Death==
Milford was born with several congenital heart defects that required surgery throughout his life. On June 16, 1988, he died of complications following open heart surgery several weeks earlier. He was age 37.

<doc id="17257" wikidata="Q244390" url="?curid=17257" title="Ken Kesey">
<text>Ken Elton Kesey (; September 17, 1935 – November 10, 2001) was an American novelist, essayist and countercultural figure. He considered himself a link between the Beat Generation of the 1950s and the hippies of the 1960s.

Kesey was born in La Junta, Colorado, and grew up in Springfield, Oregon, graduating from the University of Oregon in 1957. He began writing &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; in 1960 after completing a graduate fellowship in creative writing at Stanford University; the novel was an immediate commercial and critical success when published two years later. During this period, Kesey was used by the CIA without his knowledge in the Project MKULTRA involving hallucinogenic drugs (including mescaline and LSD), which was done to try to make people insane to put them under the control of interrogators.

After &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; was published, Kesey moved to nearby La Honda, California, and began hosting &quot;happenings&quot; with former colleagues from Stanford, bohemian and literary figures including Neal Cassady and other friends, who became collectively known as the Merry Pranksters. As documented in Tom Wolfe&#x27;s 1968 New Journalism book &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot;, some of the parties were promoted to the public as Acid Tests, and integrated the consumption of LSD with multimedia performances. He mentored the Grateful Dead, who were the Acid Tests&#x27; house band, and continued to exert a profound influence upon the group throughout their career.

Kesey&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Sometimes a Great Notion&quot;, was a commercial success that polarized some critics and readers upon its release in 1964. An epic account of the vicissitudes of an Oregon logging family that aspired to the modernist grandeur of William Faulkner&#x27;s Yoknapatawpha saga, Kesey regarded it as his magnum opus.

In 1965, after being arrested for marijuana possession and faking suicide, Kesey was imprisoned for five months. Shortly thereafter, he returned home to the Willamette Valley and settled in Pleasant Hill, Oregon, where he maintained a secluded, family-oriented lifestyle for the rest of his life. In addition to teaching at the University of Oregon—an experience that culminated in &quot;Caverns&quot; (1989), a collaborative novel by Kesey and his graduate workshop students under the pseudonym &quot;O.U. Levon&quot;—he continued to regularly contribute fiction and reportage to such publications as &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Oui&quot;, &quot;Running&quot;, and &quot;The Whole Earth Catalog&quot;; various iterations of these pieces were collected in &quot;Kesey&#x27;s Garage Sale&quot; (1973) and &quot;Demon Box&quot; (1986).

Between 1974 and 1980, Kesey published six issues of &quot;Spit in the Ocean&quot;, a literary magazine that featured excerpts from an unfinished novel (&quot;Seven Prayers by Grandma Whittier&quot;, an account of Kesey&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s struggle with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease) and contributions from writers including Margo St. James, Kate Millett, Stewart Brand, Saul-Paul Sirag, Jack Sarfatti, Paul Krassner and William S. Burroughs. After a third novel (&quot;Sailor Song&quot;) was released to lukewarm reviews in 1992, he reunited with the Merry Pranksters and began publishing works on the Internet until ill health (including a stroke) curtailed his activities.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Kesey was born in 1935 in La Junta, Colorado, to dairy farmers Geneva (née Smith) and Frederick A. Kesey. When Kesey was 10 years old, the family moved to Springfield, Oregon in 1946. Kesey was a champion wrestler in high school and college in the weight division, and almost qualified to be on the Olympic team, but a serious shoulder injury halted his wrestling career. He graduated from Springfield High School in 1953. An avid reader and filmgoer, the young Kesey took John Wayne, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Zane Grey as his role models (later naming a son Zane) and toyed with magic, ventriloquism and hypnotism.

While attending the University of Oregon School of Journalism and Communication in neighboring Eugene in 1956, Kesey eloped with his high-school sweetheart, Oregon State College student Norma &quot;Faye&quot; Haxby, whom he had met in seventh grade. According to Kesey, &quot;Without Faye, I would have been swept overboard by notoriety and weird, dope-fueled ideas and flower-child girls with beamy eyes and bulbous breasts.&quot; Married until his death, they had three children: Jed, Zane and Shannon. Additionally, with Faye&#x27;s approval, Kesey fathered a daughter, Sunshine Kesey, with fellow Merry Prankster Carolyn &quot;Mountain Girl&quot; Adams. Born in 1966, Sunshine was raised by Adams and her stepfather, Jerry Garcia.

Kesey had a football scholarship for his first year, but switched to the University of Oregon wrestling team as a better fit for his build. After posting a .885 winning percentage in the 1956–57 season, he received the Fred Low Scholarship for outstanding Northwest wrestler. In 1957, Kesey was second in his weight class at the Pacific Coast intercollegiate competition. He remains in the top 10 of Oregon Wrestling&#x27;s all-time winning percentage.

A member of Beta Theta Pi throughout his studies, Kesey graduated from the University of Oregon with a B.A. in speech and communication in 1957. Increasingly disengaged by the playwriting and screenwriting courses that comprised much of his major, he began to take literature classes in the second half of his collegiate career with James B. Hall, a cosmopolitan alumnus of the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop who had previously taught at Cornell University and later served as provost of College V at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Hall took on Kesey as his protégé and cultivated his interest in literary fiction, introducing Kesey (whose reading interests were hitherto confined to science fiction) to the works of Ernest Hemingway and other paragons of literary modernism. After the last of several brief summer sojourns as a struggling actor in Los Angeles, Kesey published his first short story (&quot;First Sunday of September&quot;) in the &quot;Northwest Review&quot; and successfully applied to the highly selective Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship for the 1958–59 academic year.

Unbeknownst to Kesey, who applied at Hall&#x27;s request, the maverick literary critic Leslie Fiedler (then based at the University of Montana) successfully importuned the regional fellowship committee to select the &quot;rough-hewn&quot; Kesey alongside more traditional fellows from Reed College and other elite institutions. Because he lacked the prerequisites to work toward a traditional master&#x27;s degree in English as a communications major, Kesey elected to enroll in the non-degree program at Stanford University&#x27;s Creative Writing Center that fall. While studying and working in the Stanford milieu over the next five years, most of them spent as a resident of Perry Lane (a historically bohemian enclave next to the university golf course), he developed intimate lifelong friendships with fellow writers Ken Babbs, Larry McMurtry, Wendell Berry, Ed McClanahan, Gurney Norman and Robert Stone.

During his initial fellowship year, Kesey frequently clashed with center director Wallace Stegner, who regarded him as &quot;a sort of highly talented illiterate&quot; and rejected Kesey&#x27;s application for a departmental Stegner Fellowship before permitting his attendance as a Woodrow Wilson Fellow. Reinforcing these perceptions, Stegner&#x27;s deputy Richard Scowcroft later recalled that &quot;neither Wally nor I thought he had a particularly important talent.&quot; According to Stone, Stegner &quot;saw Kesey... as a threat to civilization and intellectualism and sobriety&quot; and continued to reject Kesey&#x27;s Stegner Fellowship applications for the 1959–60 and 1960–61 terms.

Nevertheless, Kesey received the prestigious $2,000 Harper-Saxton Prize for his first novel in progress (the oft-rejected &quot;Zoo&quot;) and audited the graduate writing seminar—a courtesy nominally accorded to former Stegner Fellows, although Kesey only secured his place by falsely claiming to Scowcroft that his colleague (on sabbatical through 1960) &quot;had said that he could attend classes for free&quot;—through the 1960–61 term. The course was initially taught that year by Viking Press editorial consultant and Lost Generation &quot;eminence grise&quot; Malcolm Cowley, who was &quot;always glad to see&quot; Kesey and fellow auditor Tillie Olsen. Cowley was succeeded the following quarter by the Irish short-story specialist Frank O&#x27;Connor; frequent spats between O&#x27;Connor and Kesey ultimately precipitated his departure from the class. While under Cowley&#x27;s tutelage, he began to draft and workshop a manuscript that evolved into &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;.

Reflecting upon this period in a 1999 interview with Robert K. Elder, Kesey recalled, &quot;I was too young to be a beatnik, and too old to be a hippie.&quot;

=== Experimentation with psychedelic drugs ===

At the invitation of Perry Lane neighbor and Stanford psychology graduate student Vic Lovell, Kesey was tricked into volunteering to take part in what turned out to be a CIA-financed study under the aegis of Project MKULTRA, a highly secret military program, at the Menlo Park Veterans&#x27; Hospital, where he worked as a night aide. The project studied the effects of psychedelic drugs, particularly LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, cocaine, aMT, and DMT. Kesey wrote many detailed accounts of his experiences with these drugs, both during the study and in the years of private drug use that followed.

Kesey&#x27;s role as a medical guinea pig, as well as his stint working at the Veterans&#x27; Administration hospital, inspired &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;. The book&#x27;s success, as well as the demolition of the Perry Lane cabins in August 1963, allowed him to move to a log house in La Honda, California, a rustic hamlet in the Santa Cruz Mountains 15 miles southwest of Stanford University. He frequently entertained friends and many others with parties he called &quot;Acid Tests&quot;, involving music (including Kesey&#x27;s favorite band, the Grateful Dead), black lights, fluorescent paint, strobe lights, LSD, and other psychedelic effects. These parties were described in some of Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s poems and served as the basis for Tom Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot;, an early exemplar of the nonfiction novel. Other firsthand accounts of the Acid Tests appear in &quot;Living with the Dead&quot; by Rock Scully and David Dalton, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs&quot; by Hunter S. Thompson and the 1967 Hells Angels memoir &quot;Freewheelin Frank: Secretary of the Angels&quot; (Frank Reynolds; ghostwritten by Michael McClure).

=== &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; ===

While enrolled at the University of Oregon in 1957, Kesey wrote &quot;End of Autumn&quot;; according to Rick Dogson, the novel &quot;focused on the exploitation of college athletes by telling the tale of a football lineman who was having second thoughts about the game&quot;. Kesey came to regard the unpublished work as juvenilia, but an excerpt served as his Stanford Creative Writing Center application sample.

During his Woodrow Wilson Fellowship year, Kesey wrote &quot;Zoo&quot;, a novel about beatniks living in the North Beach community of San Francisco, but it was never published.

The inspiration for &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; came while Kesey was working the night shift with Gordon Lish at the Menlo Park Veterans&#x27; Hospital. There, Kesey often spent time talking to the patients, sometimes under the influence of the hallucinogenic drugs he had volunteered to experiment with. He did not believe these patients were insane, but rather that society had pushed them out because they did not fit conventional ideas of how people were supposed to act and behave. Published under Cowley&#x27;s guidance in 1962, the novel was an immediate success; in 1963, it was adapted into a successful stage play by Dale Wasserman, and in 1975, Miloš Forman directed a screen adaptation, which won the &quot;Big Five&quot; Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor (Jack Nicholson), Best Actress (Louise Fletcher), Best Director (Forman) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman).

Kesey originally was involved in the film, but left two weeks into production. He claimed never to have seen the movie because of a dispute over the $20,000 he was initially paid for the film rights. Kesey loathed that, unlike the book, the film was not narrated by Chief Bromden, and he disagreed with Jack Nicholson&#x27;s casting as Randle McMurphy (he wanted Gene Hackman). Despite this, Faye Kesey has said that her husband was generally supportive of the film and pleased that it was made.

=== Merry Pranksters ===

When the 1964 publication of his second novel, &quot;Sometimes a Great Notion&quot;, required his presence in New York, Kesey, Neal Cassady, and others in a group of friends they called the Merry Pranksters took a cross-country trip in a school bus nicknamed &quot;Furthur&quot;. This trip, described in Tom Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; (and later in Kesey&#x27;s unproduced screenplay, &quot;The Furthur Inquiry&quot;), was the group&#x27;s attempt to create art out of everyday life and to experience roadway America while high on LSD. In an interview after arriving in New York, Kesey said, &quot;The sense of communication in this country has damn near atrophied. But we found as we went along it got easier to make contact with people. If people could just understand it is possible to be different without being a threat.&quot; A huge amount of footage was filmed on 16 mm film during the trip, which remained largely unseen until the release of Alex Gibney and Alison Elwood&#x27;s 2011 film &quot;Magic Trip&quot;.

After the bus trip, the Pranksters threw parties they called Acid Tests around the San Francisco Bay Area from 1965 to 1966. Many of the Pranksters lived at Kesey&#x27;s residence in La Honda. In New York, Cassady introduced Kesey to Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, who turned them on to Timothy Leary. &quot;Sometimes a Great Notion&quot; inspired a 1970 film starring and directed by Paul Newman; it was nominated for two Academy Awards, and in 1972 was the first film shown by the new television network HBO, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.

In 1965, Kesey was arrested in La Honda for marijuana possession. In an attempt to mislead police, he faked suicide by having friends leave his truck on a cliffside road near Eureka, along with an elaborate suicide note written by the Pranksters. Kesey fled to Mexico in the back of a friend&#x27;s car. He returned to the U.S. eight months later. On January 17, 1966, Kesey was sentenced to six months at the San Mateo County jail in Redwood City, California. Two nights later, he was arrested again, this time with Carolyn Adams, while smoking marijuana on the rooftop of Stewart Brand&#x27;s Telegraph Hill home in San Francisco. On his release, he moved back to the family farm in Pleasant Hill, Oregon, in the Willamette Valley, where he spent the rest of his life. He wrote many articles, books (mostly collections of his articles), and short stories during that time.

=== Death of son ===
On January 23, 1984, Kesey&#x27;s 20-year-old son Jed, a wrestler for the University of Oregon, suffered severe head injuries on the way to Pullman, Washington, when the team&#x27;s loaned van crashed after sliding off an icy highway. Two days later at Deaconess Hospital in Spokane, he was declared brain dead and his parents gave permission for his organs to be donated.

Jed&#x27;s death deeply affected Kesey, who later called Jed a victim of policies that had starved the team of funding. He wrote to Senator Mark Hatfield: 

At a Grateful Dead concert soon after the death of promoter Bill Graham, Kesey delivered a eulogy, mentioning that Graham had donated $1,000 toward a memorial to Jed atop Mount Pisgah, near the Kesey home in Pleasant Hill. In 1988, Kesey donated $33,395 toward the purchase of a proper bus for the school&#x27;s wrestling team.

=== Final years ===
Kesey was diagnosed with diabetes in 1992. In 1994, he toured with members of the Merry Pranksters, performing a musical play he wrote about the millennium called &quot;Twister: A Ritual Reality&quot;. Many old and new friends and family showed up to support the Pranksters on this tour, which took them from Seattle&#x27;s Bumbershoot all along the West Coast, including a sold-out two-night run at The Fillmore in San Francisco to Boulder, Colorado, where they coaxed the Beat Generation poet Allen Ginsberg into performing with them.

Kesey mainly kept to his home life in Pleasant Hill, preferring to make artistic contributions on the Internet or holding ritualistic revivals in the spirit of the Acid Test. In the Grateful Dead DVD &quot;The Closing of Winterland&quot; (2003) documenting the New Year&#x27;s 1978/1979 concert at the Winterland Arena in San Francisco, Kesey is featured in a between-set interview.

On August 14, 1997, Kesey and his Pranksters attended a Phish concert in Darien Lake, New York. Kesey and the Pranksters appeared onstage with the band and performed a dance-trance-jam session involving several characters from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein&quot;.

In June 2001, Kesey was the keynote speaker at The Evergreen State College&#x27;s commencement ceremony. His last major work was an essay for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine calling for peace in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.

=== Death ===
In 1997, health problems began to weaken Kesey, starting with a stroke that year. On October 25, 2001, Kesey had surgery at Sacred Heart Medical Center in Eugene on his liver to remove a tumor; he did not recover and died of complications several weeks later on November 10 at age 66. After a public service in Eugene, his body was brought back to his farm and buried next to his son Jed.

=== Legacy ===
The film &quot;Gerry&quot; (2002) is dedicated to Kesey.

Kesey Square is in downtown Eugene, Oregon.

<text>Kandahar (; ; ) is a city in Afghanistan, located in the south of the country on Arghandab River, at an elevation of . It is Afghanistan&#x27;s second largest city, after Kabul, with a population of about 614,118 in 2015. It is the capital of Kandahar Province and the centre of the larger cultural region called Loy Kandahar.

Kandahar is the founding city and spiritual center of the Taliban. Despite the capital of Afghanistan being Kabul, where the government administration is based, Kandahar is the seat of power in Afghanistan as the supreme leader and his spiritual advisers are based there. Kandahar has therefore been called the de facto capital of Afghanistan, though the Taliban maintain Kabul is the capital.

Kandahar is one of the most culturally significant cities of the Pashtuns community and has been their traditional seat of power for more than 300 years. It is a major trading center for fresh and dried fruit, including food grains, sheep, wool, cotton, silk, and felt. The region produces fine fruits, especially pomegranates and grapes, and the city has plants for canning, drying, and packing fruits.

The region around Kandahar is one of the oldest known human settlements. A major fortified city existed at the site of Kandahar, probably as early as 1000–750 BC, and it became an important outpost of the Achaemenid (Persian) Empire in the 6th century BC. Alexander the Great had laid-out the foundation of what is now Old Kandahar (which is in the southern section of Kandahar city) in the 4th century BC and gave it the Ancient Greek name Ἀλεξάνδρεια Ἀραχωσίας (). Historically, this province is considered as an important political area for Afghanistan revelations. Many empires have long fought over the city due to its strategic location along the trade routes of southern, central and western Asia. In 1709, Mirwais Hotak made the region an independent kingdom and turned Kandahar into the capital of the Hotak dynasty. In 1747, Ahmad Shah Durrani, founder of the Durrani dynasty, made Kandahar the capital of the Afghan Empire.

==Name==
The modern name of the city derives from the name of the original city built here, Alexandria. This city (often referred to as Alexandria in Arachosia to distinguish it from other Alexandrias) was founded after the invasion of Alexander the Great in 330 BC. The name &quot;Alexander&quot; in the local Pashto language is rendered as &quot;Iskandar&quot;. It is believed that over time this transformed into &quot;Scandar&quot;, and eventually the modern &quot;Kandahar&quot;. The change of the name from &quot;Scandar&quot; to Candar is mentioned by the 16th-century Portuguese historian João de Barros in his most famous work, &quot;Décadas da Ásia&quot;.

A folk etymology offered is that the word &quot;kand&quot; or &quot;qand&quot; in Persian and Pashto (the local languages) is the origin of the word &quot;candy&quot;. The name &quot;Candahar&quot; or &quot;Kandahar&quot; in this form probably translates to candy area. This probably has to do with the location being fertile and historically known for producing fine grapes, pomegranates, apricots, melons and other sweet fruits.

Ernst Herzfeld claimed Kandahar perpetuated the name of the Indo-Parthian king Gondophares, who re-founded the city under the name Gundopharron. However, modern historians and linguists generally find this derivation implausible.

An alternative etymology derives the name of the city from Gandhara, the name of an ancient Buddhist kingdom located along the north of the Kabul river, and centred on the Peshawar Valley.

==History==
===Prehistory===

Excavations of prehistoric sites by archaeologists such as Louis Dupree and others suggest that the region around Kandahar is one of the oldest known human settlements known so far.
British excavations in the 1970s discovered that Kandahar existed as a large fortified city during the early 1st millennium BC; while this earliest period at Kandahar has not been precisely dated via radiocarbon, ceramic comparisons with the latest period at the major Bronze Age city of Mundigak have suggested an approximate time-frame of 1000 to 750 BC. This fortified city became an important outpost of the Achaemenid Empire in the 6th to 4th centuries BC, and formed part of the province of Arachosia.

===Ancient history===
Foundation of city and Greek invasion

The now known &quot;Old Kandahar&quot; was founded in 330 BC by Alexander the Great, near the site of the ancient city of Mundigak (established around 3000 BC era). Mundigak served as the provincial capital of Arachosia and was ruled by the Medes followed by the Achaemenids until the arrival of the Macedonians. The main inhabitants of Arachosia were the &quot;Pakhtas&quot;, an ancient Indo-Iranian tribe, who might have been among the ancestors of today&#x27;s Pashtuns. Kandahar was named &quot;Alexandria&quot;, a name given to some cities that Alexander founded during his conquests.

Kandahar was a frequent target for conquest because of its strategic location in Asia, controlling the main trade route linking the Indian subcontinent with the Middle East and Central Asia. The territory became part of the Seleucid Empire after the death of Alexander. It is mentioned by Strabo that a treaty of friendship was established eventually between the Greeks and the Mauryas (Indians). The city eventually became part of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (250 BC – 125 BC), and continued that way for two hundred years under the later Indo-Greek Kingdom (180 BC – 10 AD). 
While the Diadochi were warring amongst themselves, the Mauryas were developing in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. The founder of the empire, Chandragupta Maurya, confronted a Macedonian invasion force led by Seleucus I in 305 BC and following a brief conflict, an agreement was reached as Seleucus ceded Gandhara and Arachosia and areas south of Bagram to the Mauryas. During the 120 years of the Mauryas in southern Afghanistan, Buddhism was introduced and eventually become one of the major religions alongside Zoroastrianism.

Inscriptions made by Emperor Ashoka, a fragment of Edict 13 in Greek, as well as a full Edict, written in both Greek and Aramaic has been discovered in Kandahar. It is said to be written in excellent Classical Greek, using sophisticated philosophical terms. In this Edict, Ashoka the great used the word Eusebeia (&quot;Piety&quot;) as the Greek translation for the ubiquitous &quot;Dharma&quot; of his other Edicts written in Prakrit.

===Medieval history===
Islamic conquest

Until the 9th century, the Kandahar region was ruled by the Zunbil dynasty and considered part of the Indian Subcontinent, though it was an Eastern Iranic realm which followed Zurvanism. In the 7th century AD, Arab armies conquered the region but failed to convert the entire 
population to Islam.The leader of the expedition was Abbad ibn Ziyad, who governed Sijistan between 673 and 681. In AD 870, Yaqub ibn Layth Saffari, a local ruler of the Saffarid dynasty, conquered Kandahar and environs in the name of Islam.

Ghanavids

It is believed that the Zunbil dynasty governed the Kandahar region from the 7th century until the late 9th century AD. Kandahar was taken by Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni in the 11th century followed by the Ghurids of Ghor.

Kandahar appears to have been renamed &quot;Teginābād&quot; in the 10th–12th centuries, but the origin of the new name is unclear. During this period, nearby Panjway served as the administrative center for the area. However, Kandahar was of much more strategic importance, to the extent that Minhaj-i-Siraj attributes the downfall of the Ghaznavids to the loss of Kandahar. The city&#x27;s name was changed back to Kandahar by the 13th century, after Ala ad-Din Husayn Jahansuz sacked Lashkari Bazar, near Bost. Again, the reason for the name change is not clear.

Mongols

Kandahar was besieged by a Mongol army in 1221, although Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu defeated them. In 1251, upon accession to the Mongol throne, Möngke Khan granted Kandahar, along with other lands in Afghanistan, to Shams ad-Din Mohammad Kart of the Kart dynasty. However, the city is mentioned as being under Chagatai control in 1260–61; Kandahar didn&#x27;t come under Kart control until 1281. Later, in 1318, a Chagatai prince raised an army from Kandahar against the Ilkhanid governor of Sistan. Kandahar was described by Ibn Battuta in 1333 as a large and prosperous town three nights journey from Ghazni.

Tamerlane, founder of the Timurid Empire, captured Kandahar in 1383. He appointed his grandson Pir Muhammad as governor of Kandahar in 1390. Following his death in 1405, the city was ruled by other Timurid governors. Kandahar was entrusted to the Arghuns in the late 15th century, who eventually achieved independence from the Timurids. Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, is believed to have visited the town (c. 1521 AD) during his important journey between Hindustan and Mecca in Arabia.

Mughal and Safavid Era

Tamerlane&#x27;s descendant, Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, annexed Kandahar in 1508. In 1554, Babur&#x27;s son, Humayun, handed it over to the Safavid Shah Tahmasp in return of 12,000 soldiers he received from the Shah to reconquer India. In 1595, Humayun&#x27;s son Akbar the Great reconquered the city by diplomacy. Akbar died in 1605 and when this news reached the Persian court, Shah Abbas ordered his army to besiege the city which continued until early 1606 and finally failed due to the reinforcements sent by the Mughal Emperor Jahangir that forced the Safavid retreat. In the Mughal–Safavid War, Kandahar was once again lost to the Safavids. In 1698, Mughals under Samandar Khan of Kalat State captured Kandahar again. Kandahar was regarded as important to the Mughal Empire because it was one of the gateways to India, and Mughal control over Kandahar helped to prevent foreign intrusions.

The memory of the wars fought over Kandahar at this time is preserved in the epic poem &quot;Qandahār-nāma&quot; (&quot;The Campaign Against Qandahār&quot;), a major work of Saib Tabrizi which is a classic of Persian literature.

===Modern (1709–present)===
Mirwais Hotak, chief of the Ghilji tribe, revolted in 1709 by killing Gurgin Khan, an ethnic Georgian subject and governor of the Shia Safavid Persians. After establishing the Hotak dynasty in Kandahar, Mirwais and his army successfully defeated subsequent expeditions by Kay Khusraw and Rustam Khán. Mirwais resisted attempts by the Persian government who were seeking to convert the Afghans from Sunni to the Shia sect of Islam. He died of a natural death in November 1715 and was succeeded by his brother Abdul Aziz, but after being suspected of giving Kandahar&#x27;s sovereignty back to the Persians he was killed by his nephew Mahmud Hotak.

In 1722, Mahmud led an army of Afghans to the Safavid capital Isfahan and proclaimed himself King of Persia. The Hotak dynasty was eventually removed from power by a new Persian ruler, Nader Shah. In 1738, Nader Shah invaded Afghanistan and destroyed the now &quot;Old Kandahar&quot;, which was held by Hussain Hotak and his Ghilji tribes. In the meantime, Nader Shah freed Ahmad Khan (later Ahmad Shah Durrani) and his brother Zulfikar who were held prisoners by the Hotak ruler. Before leaving southern Afghanistan for Delhi in India, Nader Shah laid out the foundation for a new town to be built next to the destroyed ancient city, naming it &quot;Naderabad&quot;. His rule ended in June 1747 after being murdered by his Persian guards.
Ahmad Shah Durrani, chief of the Durrani tribe, gained control of Kandahar and made it the capital of his new Afghan Empire in October 1747. Initially, Ahmad Shah had trouble finding land on which to build his city. His own tribe had no extensive lands and others who had, such as the Alikozai and Barakzai, refused to give up their lands. Only the Popalzai finally offered him his pick of their lands. The foundations for the city were laid in June, 1761. Once begun, the city was built with grand proportions. It was laid out in the form of a regular rectangle with a circumference of three miles; walls 30 feet thick at the bottom and 15 feet at the top, rose 27 feet high to enclose it. Outside, the walls were ringed by a moat 24 feet wide. Six mammoth gateways pierced these walls: the Eid Gah Gate on the north, the Shikarpur Gate on the south; the Herat and Top Khana Gates on the west; and, the Bar Durrani and Kabul Gates on the east. At its peak, Ahmad Shah&#x27;s empire included present-day Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Khorasan and Kohistan provinces of Iran, along with Punjab in India. In October 1772, Ahmad Shah retired and died from a natural cause. A new city was laid out by Ahmad Shah and is dominated by his mausoleum, which is adjacent to the Mosque of the Cloak in the centre of the city. By 1776, his eldest son Timur Shah had transferred Afghanistan&#x27;s main capital, due to several conflicts with various Pashtun tribes, from Kandahar to Kabul, where the Durrani legacy continued.

From 1818 to 1855, Kandahar was ruled by half-brothers of Dost Mohammad Khan as an independent principality. In September 1826, Syed Ahmad Shaheed&#x27;s followers arrived to Kandahar in search of volunteers to help them wage jihad against the Sikh invaders to what is now Pakistan. Led by Ranjit Singh, the Sikhs had captured several of Afghanistan&#x27;s territories in the east, including what is now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Kashmir. More than 400 local Kandahar warriors assembled themselves for the jihad. Sayed Din Mohammad Kandharai was appointed as their leader.

British war

British-led Indian forces from neighbouring British India invaded the city in 1839, during the First Anglo-Afghan War, but withdrew in 1842. In November 1855, Dost Mohammad Khan conquered Kandahar. The British and Indian forces returned in 1878 during the Second Anglo-Afghan War. They emerged from the city in July 1880 to confront the forces of Ayub Khan, but were defeated at the Battle of Maiwand. They were again forced to withdraw a few years later, despite winning the Battle of Kandahar.

Kandahar remained peaceful for the next 100 years, except during 1929 when loyalists of Habibullah Kalakani (Bache Saqqaw) placed the fortified city on lock-down and began torturing its population. Nobody was allowed to enter or leave from within the city&#x27;s tall defensive walls, and as a result of this many people suffered after running out of food supplies. This lasted until October 1929 when Nadir Khan and his Afghan army came to eliminate Kalakani, known as the Tajik bandit from the village of Kalakan in northern Kabul Province.

During Zahir Shah&#x27;s rule, the city slowly began expanding by adding modern style streets and housing schemes. Although Kandahar remained less international than Kabul, with fewer foreigners in residence and thus no market for coffee, jam, potatoes, or other European produce, a modest German community took root there in the 1930s. Engineers and factory managers, accompanied by their spouses, arrived to supervise wool-processing plants. A Siemens electrical station powered these emerging industries, signaling a step toward the broader modernization taking shape across Afghanistan during this period. 

In the 1960s, during the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, Kandahar International Airport was built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers next to the city. The U.S. also completed several other major projects in Kandahar and in other parts of southern Afghanistan. In the meantime, Soviet engineers were busy building major infrastructures in other parts of the country, such as Bagram Airfield and Kabul International Airport.

During the 1980s, Soviet–Afghan War, Kandahar city (and the province as a whole) witnessed heavy fighting as it became a centre of resistance as the mujahideen forces waged a strong guerrilla warfare against the Soviet-backed government, who tightly held on control of the city. Government and Soviet troops surrounded the city and subjected it to heavy air bombardment in which many civilians lost their lives. In January 1982 indiscriminate shelling and bombing by the Soviets killed hundreds. 300 civilians were killed during Soviet bombings in July 1984. It was under siege again in April 1986. The city&#x27;s population was reduced from 200,000 before the war to no more than 25,000 inhabitants, following a months-long campaign of carpet bombing and bulldozing by the Soviets and Afghan communist soldiers in 1987. Kandahar International Airport was used by the Soviet Army during their ten-year troop placement in the country. The city also became a battle ground for the US and Pakistani-backed forces against the pro-Communist government of Afghanistan.

Kandahar underwent a complete sociopolitical collapse in the early 1990s, driven in part by the divide-and-rule tactics of the communist governor-general, Nur ul-Haq Ulumi, who manipulated rival mujahideen factions against each other, and by the rampant greed within both the communist and mujahideen militias. After the Soviet withdrawal and the collapse of Najibullah&#x27;s government in 1992, Kandahar fell to local mujahideen commander, Gul Agha Sherzai. However Sherzai lacked authority against other local commanders which led to lawlessness in the city, and fighting in 1993. During this time, banditry, rape, and murder became rampant in Kandahar, creating a demand for a more moral and unified alternative. This led to the rise of the &quot;talibs&quot; (students), who eventually formed the Taliban movement. By the spring of 1994, the nucleus of the Taliban emirate had begun to take shape, and that year, they launched operations to dismantle warlord militia checkpoints around the city. The talibs gained considerable popularity and legitimacy during this period by defeating these predatory warlords.

In August 1994, the Taliban, under Mullah Omar, captured Kandahar from commander Mullah Naqib almost without a fight and turned the city into their headquarters. The capture of Afghanistan&#x27;s second-largest city marked the Taliban&#x27;s transformation from a fledgling militia into an Islamic emirate, solidifying their legitimacy as a governing authority through the imposition of a strict interpretation of Islamic law. Formal education for girls was banned as well as the consumption of TV, films, music with instrumental accompaniments, and the playing of sports. In December 1999, a hijacked Indian Airlines Flight 814 plane by Pakistani militants loyal to Harkat-ul-Mujahideen landed at Kandahar International Airport and kept the passengers hostage as part of a demand to release three Pakistani militants from prison in India.

====21st century====
In October 2001, as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, the United States Navy began hitting targets inside the city by precision-guided cruise missiles that were fired from the Persian Gulf. These targets were the airport and buildings that were occupied by the Taliban, including Arab families who had arrived several years earlier and were residing in the area. About a month later, the Taliban began surrendering in mass numbers to a private militia that had been formed by Gul Agha Sherzai and Hamid Karzai. Kandahar once again fell into the hands of Sherzai, who had control over the area before the rise of the Taliban. He was transferred in 2003 and replaced by Yousef Pashtun until Asadullah Khalid took the post in 2005. Toryalai Wesa was appointed Governor of the province by President Hamid Karzai in December 2008 after Rahmatullah Raufi&#x27;s four-month rule.

In 2002, Kandahar International Airport started to be used by members of the United States armed forces and NATO&#x27;s International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). NATO began training the newly formed Afghan National Police and provided security responsibility of the city. The military of Afghanistan, backed by NATO forces, gradually expanded its authority and presence throughout most of the country. The 205th Corps of the Afghan National Army was based at Kandahar and provided military assistance to the south of the country. The Canadian Forces maintained their military command headquarters at Kandahar, heading the Regional Command South of the NATO led International Security Assistance Force in Kandahar Province. The Taliban also had supporters inside the city reporting on events.

NATO forces expanded the Afghan police force for the prevention of a Taliban comeback in Kandahar, the militants&#x27; &quot;spiritual birthplace&quot; and a strategic key to ward off the Taliban insurgency, as a part of a larger effort that also aimed to deliver services such as electricity and clean drinking water that the Taliban could not provide – encouraging support for the government in a city that was once the Taliban&#x27;s headquarters. The most significant battle between NATO troops and the Taliban lasted throughout the summer of 2006, culminating in Operation Medusa. The Taliban failed to defeat the Western troops in open warfare, which marked a turn in their tactics towards IED emplacement. In June 2008, it was reported that over 1,000 inmates had escaped from Sarposa prison. In Spring 2010, the province and the city of Kandahar became a target of American operations following &quot;Operation Moshtarak&quot; in the neighbouring Helmand Province. In March 2010, U.S. and NATO commanders released details of plans for the biggest offensive of the war against the Taliban insurgency.
In May 2010, Kandahar International Airport became subject of a combined rocket and ground attack by insurgents, following similar attacks on Kabul and Bagram in the preceding weeks. Although this attack did not lead to many casualties on the side of NATO forces, it did show that the militants are still capable of launching multiple, coordinated operations in Afghanistan. In June 2010, a shura was held by Afghan President Hamid Karzai with tribal and religious leaders of the Kandahar region. The meeting highlighted the need for support of NATO-led forces in order to stabilize parts of the province.

By 2011, Kandahar became known as the assassination city of Afghanistan after witnessing many targeted killings. In July Ahmed Wali Karzai, brother of President Hamid Karzai, was shot by his long time head of security. Soon after the Quetta Shura of the Taliban claimed responsibility. The next day an Islamic cleric (mulla) of the famous Red Mosque in the Shahr-e Naw area of the city and a number of other people were killed by a Taliban suicide bomber who had hidden explosives inside his turban. On 27 July 2011, the mayor of the city, Ghulam Haider Hamidi, was assassinated by another Taliban militant who had hidden explosives in his turban. Two deputy mayors had been killed in 2010, while many tribal elders and Islamic clerics have also been assassinated in the last several years. The overwhelming majority of the victims in the attacks are ordinary Afghan civilians. On 6 June 2012, at least 21 civilians were killed and 50 others injured when two Taliban suicide bombers on motorcycles blew themselves up in a market area near Kandahar International Airport.

On 4 May 2020, a policewoman was assassinated in the centre of Kandahar, making her the fifth policewoman to be killed during the previous two months in Kandahar. No group claimed responsibility for the killing of the policewomen by the end of the day of the reported event.

On 12 August 2021, the Taliban captured Kandahar. After days of brutal clashes with ANA soldiers retreating from the city, the Taliban were finally able to capture the city. It became the twelfth provincial capital to be seized by Taliban as part of the wider 2021 Taliban offensive.

On 15 October 2021, four suicide bombers killed dozens at a Shia mosque in the city.

==Geography==

The Arghandab River runs along the west of Kandahar. The city has 15 districts and a total land area of 27,337 hectares. The total number of dwellings in Kandahar is 61,902.

Only 64% of families in Kandahar have access to safe drinking water; 22% of households have access to safe toilet facilities; and 27% of households have access to electricity, with the remainder dependent on public power. Kandahar&#x27;s transportation infrastructure is well-developed, with 76.8% of the province&#x27;s roads capable of carrying car traffic in all seasons. However, there are no roads in a minor portion of the province (3.3 percent). In terms of telecommunications, Kandahar City and major roadways are covered by the three major mobile networks AWCC, Roshan, and MTN.

===Land use===
Kandahar is the regional hub in southern Afghanistan, close to the border with Pakistan. Non-built up land use accounts for 59% of the total land area. Within the built-up area, vacant plots occupy a slightly higher percentage of land (36%) than residential land (34%). There is a significant commercial cluster along the road to Pakistan in District 5. India, Iran and Pakistan have consulates here for trade, military and political links.

===Climate===
Kandahar has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot;), that borders on a hot desert climate (&quot;BWh&quot;), characterised by little precipitation and high variation between summer and winter temperatures. Summers start in mid-May, last until late September, and are extremely dry. Temperatures peak in July with a 24-hour daily average of around . They are followed by dry autumns from early October to late November, with days still averaging in the 20s °C (above 68 °F) into November, although nights are sharply cooler. Winter begins in December and sees most of its precipitation in the form of rain. Temperatures average in January, although lows can drop well below freezing. They end in early March and are followed by a pleasant spring until late April with temperatures generally in the upper 10s °C to lower 30s °C (65–88 °F) range. Sunny weather dominates year-round, especially in summer, when rainfall is extremely rare. The annual mean temperature is .
==Transport==
Kandahar International Airport serves as southern Afghanistan&#x27;s main airport for domestic and international flights. It is also used as a major military base as well as shipping and receiving of supplies for the NATO armies. The entire area in and around the airport is heavily guarded but a section is designated for civilian passengers. Most international flights are to the UAE, Iran, India, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan.

Pakistan plans to build a railroad track from the Pakistani town of Chaman to Kandahar which will connect Afghan Railways with Pakistan Railways. The feasibility study was completed in 2006 but no construction work had begun.

Kandahar is connected to Quetta Pakistan via Chaman and Kabul by the Kabul-Kandahar Highway and to Herat by the Kandahar-Herat Highway. There is a bus station located at the start of the Kabul-Kandahar Highway, where a number of privately owned older-model Mercedes-Benz coach buses are available to take passengers to most major cities of the country. Kandahar is also connected by road to Quetta in neighbouring Pakistan. Due to the ongoing war, the route to Kabul has become increasingly dangerous as insurgent attacks on convoys and destruction of bridges make it an unreliable link between the two cities.

Commuters in the city of Kandahar use the public bus system (Milli Bus), and taxicabs and rickshaws are common. Private vehicle use is increasing, partially due to road and highway improvements. Large dealerships are importing cars from Dubai, UAE.

==Demographics==
Kandahar has a population of approximately 1,057,500 people in 2008. In the province, there are around 14,445 households, with an average of seven individuals per home. Around 68 percent of Kandahar&#x27;s population resides in rural districts, with males accounting for 51 percent of the population. Pashtuns are the province&#x27;s largest ethnic group. Major Pashtun tribes such as the Tareen or Durrani including Barakzai, Popalzai, Alkozai, Noorzai, Ishaqzai, Achakzai, Maku, and Qizilbash Shia&#x27;s and Khilji are included. More than 98 percent of the population speaks Pashtu. 88 center for learning army lessons. Only a small percentage of the population speaks Balochi language and Dari. Kochi people (Pashtun Nomads) also live in Kandahar province, and their numbers fluctuate depending on the season, with estimates stating approximately 79,000 in the winter and 39,000 in the summer.

The population of Kandahar numbers approximately 651,484 . The Pashtuns make up the overwhelming majority population of the city and province but exact figures are not available. In a 2003 estimate by the National Geographic, Pashtuns were put at ca. 70%, Tajiks 20%, Baloch 2%, and Uzbeks 2%.

Pashto is the main language in the city and the region. Persian is also understood by a few number of the city dwellers, especially those serving in the government. Both are the official languages of Afghanistan. A 2006 compendium of provincial data prepared by the Afghan Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development and United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) states:
In another report, by BBC news Farsi, there are roughly 50,000-100,000 Tajik or Persian speakers in the city of Kandahar. The &quot;Council for Tajiks of the south&quot; head office is also based in Kandahar city.

The Pashtun culture, history, traditions, clothing and Pashtunwali is dominant in this region.

==Education==
Before the 1978 coup in Kabul, majority of the city&#x27;s population were enrolled in schools. Nearly all of the elite class of the city fled to neighboring Pakistan during the early 1980s, and from there they began immigrating to North America, Europe, Australia and other parts of the world.

The two oldest known schools are Ahmad Shah Baba High School and Zarghona Ana High School. There are a number of new schools that opened in the last decade, with more being built in the future as the city&#x27;s population grows with the large returning Afghans from neighboring countries. Afghan Turk High Schools is one of the top private schools in the city.

The main university is the Kandahar University. A number of private higher education institutions have also opened in the last decade such as Benawa Institute of Higher Education, Mirwais Neeka Institute of Higher Education, Malalay Institute of Higher Education and Saba Institute of Higher Education.

The adult literacy rate ratio was 16.8% in 2012. 

==Communications==

Telecommunication services in the city are provided by Afghan Wireless, Roshan, Etisalat, MTN Group and Afghan Telecom. In November 2006, the Afghan Ministry of Communications signed a $64.5 million agreement with ZTE for the establishment of a countrywide fibre optical cable network. This was intended to improve telephone, internet, television and radio broadcast services not just in Kandahar but throughout the country.

==Places of interest==

The tomb of Ahmad Shah Durrani is located in the city centre, which also houses Durrani&#x27;s brass helmet and other personal items. In front of Durrani&#x27;s mausoleum is the Shrine of the Cloak, containing one of the most valued relics in the Islamic world, which was given by the Emir of Bokhara (Murad Beg) to Ahmad Shah Durrani. The Sacred Cloak is kept locked away, taken out only at times of great crisis. Mullah Omar took it out in November 1996 and displayed it to a crowd of &quot;ulema&quot; of religious scholars to have himself declared Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin (Commander of the Faithful). Prior to that it was taken out when the city was struck by a cholera epidemic in the 1930s.

The village of &quot;Sher Surkh&quot; is located southeast of the city, in the suburbs of the old city of Nadirabad. Kandahar Museum is located at the western end of the third block of buildings lining the main road east of &quot;Eidgah Durwaza&quot; (gate). It has many paintings by the now famous Ghiyassuddin, painted while he was a young teacher in Kandahar. He is acknowledged among Afghanistan&#x27;s leading artists.

Just to the north of the city, off its northeast corner at the end of &quot;buria&quot; (matting) bazaar, there is a shrine dedicated to a saint who lived in Kandahar more than 300 years ago. The grave of &quot;Hazratji Baba&quot;, long to signify his greatness, but otherwise covered solely by rock chips, is undecorated save for tall pennants at its head. A monument to Islamic martyrs stands in the centre of Kandahar&#x27;s main square, called &quot;Da Shahidanu Chawk&quot;, which was built in the 1940s.
The &quot;Chilzina&quot; is a rock-cut chamber above the plain at the end of the rugged chain of mountains forming the western defence of Kandahar&#x27;s &quot;Old City&quot;. This is here that Ashoka&#x27;s Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription was found. Forty steps, about, lead to the chamber, which is guarded by two chained lions, defaced, and inscribed with an account of Mughal conquest. The rugged cliffs from which the &quot;Chilzina&quot; was hewn form the natural western bastion of the &quot;Old City&quot; of Kandahar, which was destroyed in 1738 by Nadir Shah Afshar of Persia.

A short distance from &quot;Chilzina&quot;, going west on the main highway, a bright blue dome appears on the right. This is the mausoleum of Mirwais Hotak, the Ghiljai chieftain who declared Kandahar&#x27;s independence from the Persians in 1709. The shrine of Baba Wali Kandhari (Baba Sahib), its terraces shaded by pomegranate groves beside the Arghandab River, is also very popular for picnics and afternoon outings. He was a Muslim pir who had a strange encounter with Guru Nanak at Hasan Abdal in what is now Attock District of Pakistan. The shrine of Baba Wali is important to Muslims and Sikhs. Close to Baba Wali&#x27;s shrine is a military base established by the United States armed forces in about 2007.

==Development and modernization==

Decades of war left Kandahar and the rest of the country destroyed and depopulated, but in recent years billions of dollars began pouring in for construction purposes and millions of expats have returned to Afghanistan. New residential areas have been established around the city, and a number of modern style buildings have been constructed.

Some residents of the city have access to clean drinking water and electricity, and the government is working to extend these services to every home. The city relies on electricity from the Kajaki hydroelectricity plant in neighbouring Helmand, which is being upgraded or expanded. About north of the city is the Dahla Dam, the second largest dam in Afghanistan.

The &quot;Aino Mina&quot; is a new housing project for up to two million people on the northern edge of the city. Originally called the &quot;Kandahar Valley&quot; and started by Mahmud Karzai, it was announced that the project would build up to 20,000 single-family homes and associated infrastructure such as roads, water and sewer systems, and community buildings, including schools.

It recently won 2 awards, the &quot;Residential Project&quot; and &quot;Sustainable Project&quot; of the Year at the Middle East Architect Awards. Many of the high-ranking government employees and civil servants as well as wealthy businessmen live in this area, which is a more secured community in Kandahar. Work on the next $100 million scheme was initiated in 2011.

Also, construction of Hamidi Township in the Morchi Kotal area of the city began in August 2011. It is named after Ghulam Haider Hamidi, the mayor of Kandahar who was assassinated by militants in late July 2011. Situated along the Kandahar-Uruzgan Highway in the northeast of the city, the new township will have 2,000 residential and commercial plots. Including new roads, schools, commercial markets, clinics, canals and other facilities.

About east of Kandahar, a huge industrial park is under construction with modern facilities. The park will have professional management for the daily maintenance of public roads, internal streets, common areas, parking areas, 24 hours perimeter security, access control for vehicles and persons.

<text>Caspar (or Kaspar) Schwen(c)kfeld von Ossig () (1489 or 1490 – 10 December 1561) was a German theologian, writer, physician, naturalist, and preacher who became a Protestant Reformer and spiritualist. He was one of the earliest promoters of the Protestant Reformation in Silesia.

Schwenckfeld came to Reformation principles through Thomas Müntzer and Andreas Karlstadt. However, he developed his own principles and fell out with Martin Luther over the eucharistic controversy (1524). He had his own views on the sacraments, known as the Heavenly Flesh doctrine, that were developed in close association with Valentin Crautwald, his humanist colleague. His followers became a new sect, which was outlawed in Germany. Its ideas were influenced by Anabaptism, Pietism in Europe, and Puritanism in England.

Many of his followers were persecuted in Europe and thus forced to either convert or flee. Because of this, there are Schwenkfelder Church congregations in the United States, which was then the Thirteen Colonies of British America until American independence was achieved following the American Revolutionary War.

== Early life and education ==
Schwenckfeld was born in Ossig near Liegnitz, Silesia now Osiek, near Legnica, Poland, to noble parents in 1489. Between 1505 and 1507, he was a student in Cologne. In 1507, he enrolled at the University of Frankfurt on the Oder. Between 1511 and 1523, Schwenckfeld served the Duchy of Liegnitz as an adviser to Duke Charles I (1511–1515), Duke George I (1515–1518), and Duke Frederick II (1518–1523).

==Career==
In 1518 or 1519, Schwenckfeld experienced an awakening that he called a &quot;visitation of God&quot;. Martin Luther&#x27;s writings had a deep influence on Schwenckfeld, and he embraced the &quot;Lutheran&quot; Reformation and became a student of the scriptures. In 1521, Schwenckfeld began to preach the gospel, and in 1522 won Duke Friedrich II over to Protestantism. He organized a Brotherhood of his converts for the purpose of study and prayer in 1523. In 1525, he rejected Luther&#x27;s idea of real presence and came to a spiritual interpretation of the Lord&#x27;s Supper, which was subsequently rejected by Luther. 

Schwenckfeld began to teach that the true believer ate the spiritual body of Christ. He pushed for reformation wherever he went, but also criticized reformers that he thought went to extremes. He emphasized that for one to be a true Christian, one must not change only outwardly but inwardly. Because of the communion and other controversies, Schwenckfeld broke with Luther and followed what some describe as a &quot;middle way&quot;. Because of his break from Luther and the Magisterial Reformation, scholars typically categorize Schwenckfeld as a member of the Radical Reformation. He voluntarily exiled himself from Silesia in 1529 in order to relieve pressure on and embarrassment of his duke. He lived in Strasbourg from 1529 to 1534, and then in Swabia.

===Teachings===
Some of the teachings of Schwenckfeld included opposition to war, secret societies, and oath-taking, that the government had no right to command one&#x27;s conscience, that regeneration is by grace through inner work of the Spirit, that believers feed on Christ spiritually, and that believers must give evidence of regeneration. He rejected infant baptism, outward church forms, and &quot;denominations&quot;. His views on the Eucharist prompted Luther to publish several sermons on the subject in his 1526 &quot;The Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ—Against the Fanatics&quot;.

=== Publications ===
In 1540 Luther expelled Schwenckfeld from Silesia. In 1541, Schwenckfeld published the &quot;Great Confession on the Glory of Christ&quot;. Many considered the writing to be heretical. He taught that Christ had two natures, divine and human, but that he became progressively more divine. He also published a number of works about interpreting the scriptures during the 1550s, often responding to the rebuttals of the Lutheran Reformer Matthias Flacius Illyricus.

Schwenckfeld&#x27;s &quot;Theriotropheum Silesiae&quot; is considered the world&#x27;s oldest published local faunal list, containing a list of the animals of Silesia, including 150 bird species.

=== Death ===
In 1561, Schwenckfeld became sick with dysentery, and gradually grew weaker until he died in Ulm on the morning of December 10, 1561. Due to his enemies, the fact of his death and the place of his burial were kept secret.

== Schwenkfelder Church ==
Schwenckfeld did not organize a separate church during his lifetime, but followers seemed to gather around his writings and sermons. In 1700, there were about 1,500 of them in Lower Silesia. Many fled Lower Silesia under persecution of the Austrian emperor, and some found refuge on the lands of Count Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf and his . These followers became known as Schwenkfelders. A group arrived in Philadelphia in 1731, followed by five more migrations up to 1737. In 1782, the Society of Schwenkfelders was formed, and in 1909 the Schwenkfelder Church was organized.

Schwenkfelder Church has remained small with approximately 2,695 total members as of 2010, and four churches, including Schwenkfelder Missionary Church in Philadelphia. Each of its the existing churches are within a radius of Philadelphia.

== Schwenkfelder Library &amp; Heritage Center ==

Schwenkfelder Library &amp; Heritage Center is a small museum, library and archives in Pennsburg, Pennsylvania. It is the only institution dedicated to the preservation and interpretation of the history of Schwenkfelder, including Schwenckfeld, the Radical Reformation, religious toleration, the Schwenkfelders in Europe and America, and the Schwenkfelder Church. The Schwenkfelder Library &amp; Heritage Center hosts exhibits and programs throughout the year.

<doc id="17264" wikidata="Q592248" url="?curid=17264" title="Kitt Peak National Observatory">
<text>The Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) is a United States astronomical observatory located on Kitt Peak of the Quinlan Mountains in the Arizona-Sonoran Desert on the Tohono Oʼodham Nation, west-southwest of Tucson, Arizona. With more than twenty optical and two radio telescopes, it is one of the largest gatherings of astronomical instruments in the Earth&#x27;s northern hemisphere.

Kitt Peak National Observatory was founded in 1958. It is home to what was the largest solar telescope in the world, and many large astronomical telescopes of the late 20th century in the United States.

The observatory was administered by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) from the early 1980s until 2019, after which it was overseen by NOIRLab.

In June 2022, the Contreras Fire led to the evacuation of Kitt Peak. The fire reached the summit at 2 a.m. on Friday, June 17. Four non-scientific buildings, including a dormitory, were lost in the fire. 15 months later in September 2023, the observatory reopened to the public.

==General information==
Kitt Peak was selected by its first director, Aden B. Meinel, in 1958 as the site for a national observatory under contract with the National Science Foundation (NSF) and was administered by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy. The land was leased from the Tohono Oʼodham under a perpetual agreement. The second director (1960 to 1971) was Nicholas U. Mayall. In 1982, NOAO was formed to consolidate the management of three optical observatories — Kitt Peak; the National Solar Observatory facilities at Kitt Peak and Sacramento Peak, New Mexico; and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. The observatory sites are under lease from the Tohono O&#x27;odham Nation at the amount of a quarter dollar per acre yearly, which was overwhelmingly approved by the Council in the 1950s. In 2005, the Tohono O&#x27;odham Nation brought suit against the National Science Foundation to stop further construction of gamma ray detectors in the Gardens of the Sacred Tohono O&#x27;odham Spirit I&#x27;itoi, which are just below the summit.

The largest optical instruments at KPNO are the Mayall 4 meter telescope and the WIYN 3.5-meter telescope; there are also several two- and one-meter class telescopes. The McMath–Pierce solar telescope was for many decades the largest solar telescope in the world and the largest unobstructed reflector (no secondary mirror in the path of incoming light). The ARO 12m Radio Telescope is also at the location.

Kitt Peak is famous for hosting the first telescope (an old 91 cm reflector) used to search for near-Earth asteroids, and calculating the probability of an impact with planet Earth.

Kitt Peak hosts an array of programs for the public to take part in, including:
* Daytime tours, speaking about the history of the observatory as well as touring a major research telescope.
* The Nightly Observing Program (NOP), which allows visitors to arrive in the late afternoon, watch the sunset, and use binoculars and telescopes to view the cosmos.
* Additionally, there is the Overnight Telescope Observing Program (OTOP). This program allows for a one-on-one, full night of observing using any of the visitor center&#x27;s telescopes. Guests may choose to do DSLR imaging, CCD imaging, or simply take in the sights with their eye to the telescope.

Kitt Peak&#x27;s Southeastern Association for Research and Astronomy (SARA) Telescope was featured in the WIPB-PBS documentary, &quot;Seeing Stars in Indiana&quot;. The project followed SARA astronomers from Ball State University to the observatory and featured time-lapse images from various points around Kitt Peak.

A major project started in the 2010s is the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) for the 4-meter Mayall telescope, for conducting spectrographic astronomical surveys of distant galaxies probing the expansion history of the universe and the mysterious physics of dark energy.

== History ==

The Kitt Peak National Observatory of the United States was dedicated on March 16, 1960. At the dedication a 36-inch telescope and various facilities were ready. Construction was underway for the then planned 84 inch telescope. (i.e. the KPNO 2.1 meter)

The 84 inch (2.1 m) had its first light in September 1964.

Over the decades the mountaintop hosted many telescopes, and achieved a variety of discoveries. Some examples of astronomical research KPNO contributed to include the study of dark matter, cosmic distances, high-redshift galaxies, and the Boötes Void. In addition, the observatory has engaged in variety of public outreach and education programs.

In 2018, KPNO established plans for its &quot;Windows on the Universe Center for Astronomy Outreach.&quot;

== Notable discoveries ==
In 1976 the Mayall Telescope was used to discover methane ice on Pluto.

The 90 cm Spacewatch telescope was used to discover the Kuiper belt body, 20000 Varuna in the year 2000. This was discovered by an astronomer noticing the slow moving object in a blink comparison.

==Climate==
Due to its high elevation, the observatory experiences a subtropical highland climate (Cfb) with a much cooler and wetter climate throughout the year than most of the Sonoran Desert.

<doc id="17268" wikidata="Q154556" url="?curid=17268" title="Karlheinz Stockhausen">
<text>Karlheinz Stockhausen (; 22 August 1928 – 5 December 2007) was a German composer, widely acknowledged by critics as one of the most important but also controversial composers of the 20th and early 21st centuries. He is known for his groundbreaking work in electronic music, having been called the &quot;father of electronic music&quot;, for introducing controlled chance (aleatory techniques) into serial composition, and for musical spatialization.

He was educated at the Hochschule für Musik Köln and the University of Cologne, later studying with Olivier Messiaen in Paris and with Werner Meyer-Eppler at the University of Bonn. As one of the leading figures of the Darmstadt School, his compositions and theories were and remain widely influential, not only on composers of art music, but also on jazz and popular music. His works, composed over a period of nearly sixty years, eschew traditional forms. In addition to electronic music—both with and without live performers—they range from miniatures for musical boxes through works for solo instruments, songs, chamber music, choral and orchestral music, to a cycle of seven full-length operas. His theoretical and other writings comprise ten large volumes. He received numerous prizes and distinctions for his compositions, recordings, and for the scores produced by his publishing company.

His notable compositions include the series of nineteen &quot;Klavierstücke&quot; (Piano Pieces), &quot;Kontra-Punkte&quot; for ten instruments, the electronic/musique-concrète &quot;Gesang der Jünglinge&quot;, &quot;Gruppen&quot; for three orchestras, the percussion solo &quot;Zyklus&quot;, &quot;Kontakte&quot;, the cantata &quot;Momente&quot;, the live-electronic &quot;Mikrophonie I&quot;, &quot;Hymnen&quot;, &quot;Stimmung&quot; for six vocalists, &quot;Aus den sieben Tagen&quot;, &quot;Mantra&quot; for two pianos and electronics, &quot;Tierkreis&quot;, &quot;Inori&quot; for soloists and orchestra, and the gigantic opera cycle &quot;Licht&quot;.

He died at the age of 79, on 5 December 2007 at his home in Kürten, Germany.

==Biography==

===Childhood===
Stockhausen was born in Burg Mödrath, the &quot;castle&quot; of the village of Mödrath. The village, located near Kerpen in the Cologne region, was displaced in 1956 to make way for lignite strip mining, but the castle itself still stands. Despite its name, the building is more a manor house than a castle. Built in 1830 by a local businessman named Arend, it was called by locals &quot;Burg Mödrath&quot;. From 1925 to 1932 it was the maternity home of the Bergheim district, and after the war it served for a time as a shelter for war refugees. In 1950, the owners, the Düsseldorf chapter of the Knights of Malta, turned it into an orphanage, but it was subsequently returned to private ownership and became a private residence again. In 2017, an anonymous patron purchased the house and opened it in April 2017 as an exhibition space for modern art, with the first floor to be used as the permanent home of the museum of the WDR Electronic Music Studio, where Stockhausen had worked from 1953 until shortly before WDR closed the studio in 2000.

His father, Simon Stockhausen, was a schoolteacher, and his mother Gertrud (née Stupp) was the daughter of a prosperous family of farmers in Neurath in the Cologne Bight. A daughter, Katherina, was born the year after Karlheinz, and a second son, Hermann-Josef (&quot;Hermännchen&quot;) followed in 1932. Gertrud played the piano and accompanied her own singing but, after three pregnancies in as many years, experienced a mental breakdown and was institutionalized in December 1932, followed a few months later by the death of her younger son, Hermann.
From the age of seven, Stockhausen lived in Altenberg, where he received his first piano lessons from the Protestant organist of the Altenberger Dom, Franz-Josef Kloth. In 1938, his father remarried. His new wife, Luzia, had been the family&#x27;s housekeeper. The couple had two daughters. Because his relationship with his new stepmother was less than happy, in January 1942 Karlheinz became a boarder at the teachers&#x27; training college in Xanten, where he continued his piano training and also studied oboe and violin. In 1941, he learned that his mother had died, ostensibly from leukemia, although everyone at the same hospital had supposedly died of the same disease. It was generally understood that she had been a victim of the Nazi policy of killing &quot;useless eaters&quot;. The official letter to the family falsely claimed she had died 16 June 1941, but recent research by Lisa Quernes, a student at the Landesmusikgymnasium in Montabaur, has determined that she was murdered in the gas chamber, along with 89 other people, at the Hadamar Killing Facility in Hesse-Nassau on 27 May 1941. Stockhausen dramatized his mother&#x27;s death in hospital by lethal injection, in Act 1 scene 2 (&quot;Mondeva&quot;) of the opera &quot;Donnerstag aus Licht&quot;.

In late 1944, Stockhausen was conscripted to serve as a stretcher bearer in Bedburg. In February 1945, he met his father for the last time in Altenberg. Simon, who was on leave from the front, told his son, &quot;I&#x27;m not coming back. Look after things.&quot; By the end of the war, his father was regarded as missing in action, and may have been killed in Hungary. A comrade later reported to Karlheinz that he saw his father wounded in action. Fifty-five years after the fact, a journalist writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that Simon Stockhausen was killed in Hungary in 1945.

===Education===
From 1947 to 1951, Stockhausen studied music pedagogy and piano at the Hochschule für Musik Köln (Cologne Conservatory of Music) and musicology, philosophy, and German studies at the University of Cologne. He had training in harmony and counterpoint, the latter with Hermann Schroeder, but he did not develop a real interest in composition until 1950. He was admitted at the end of that year to the class of Swiss composer Frank Martin, who had just begun a seven-year tenure in Cologne. At the Darmstädter Ferienkurse in 1951, Stockhausen met Belgian composer Karel Goeyvaerts, who had just completed studies with Olivier Messiaen (analysis) and Darius Milhaud (composition) in Paris, and Stockhausen resolved to do likewise. He arrived in Paris on 8 January 1952 and began attending Messiaen&#x27;s courses in aesthetics and analysis, as well as Milhaud&#x27;s composition classes. He continued with Messiaen for a year, but he was disappointed with Milhaud and abandoned his lessons after a few weeks. In March 1953, he left Paris to take up a position as assistant to Herbert Eimert at the newly established Electronic Music Studio of Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (NWDR) (from 1 January 1955, Westdeutscher Rundfunk, or WDR) in Cologne. In 1963, he succeeded Eimert as director of the studio. From 1954 to 1956, he studied phonetics, acoustics, and information theory with Werner Meyer-Eppler at the University of Bonn. Together with Eimert, Stockhausen edited the journal &quot;Die Reihe&quot; from 1955 to 1962.

===Career and adult life===

====Family and home====

On 29 December 1951, in Hamburg, Stockhausen married Doris Andreae. Together they had four children: Suja (b. 1953), Christel (b. 1956), Markus (b. 1957), and Majella (b. 1961). They were divorced in 1965. On 3 April 1967, in San Francisco, he married Mary Bauermeister, with whom he had two children: Julika (b. 22 January 1966) and Simon (b. 1967). They were divorced in 1972.

Four of Stockhausen&#x27;s children became professional musicians, and he composed some of his works specifically for them. A large number of pieces for the trumpet—from &quot;Sirius&quot; (1975–77) to the trumpet version of &quot;In Freundschaft&quot; (1997)—were composed for and premièred by his son Markus. Markus, at the age of 4 years, had performed the part of The Child in the Cologne première of &quot;Originale&quot;, alternating performances with his sister Christel. &quot;Klavierstück XII&quot; and &quot;Klavierstück XIII&quot; (and their versions as scenes from the operas &quot;Donnerstag aus Licht&quot; and &quot;Samstag aus Licht&quot;) were written for his daughter Majella, and were first performed by her at the ages of 16 and 20, respectively. The saxophone duet in the second act of &quot;Donnerstag aus Licht&quot;, and a number of synthesizer parts in the &quot;Licht&quot; operas, including &quot;Klavierstück XV&quot; (&quot;Synthi-Fou&quot;) from &quot;Dienstag&quot;, were composed for his son Simon, who also assisted his father in the production of the electronic music from &quot;Freitag aus Licht&quot;. His daughter Christel is a flautist who performed and gave a course on interpretation of &quot;Tierkreis&quot; in 1977, later published as an article.

In 1961, Stockhausen acquired a parcel of land in the vicinity of Kürten, a village east of Cologne, near Bergisch Gladbach in the Bergisches Land. He had a house built there, which was designed to his specifications by the architect Erich Schneider-Wessling, and he resided there from its completion in the autumn of 1965.

====Teaching====

After lecturing at the Internationale Ferienkurse für Neue Musik at Darmstadt (first in 1953), Stockhausen gave lectures and concerts in Europe, North America, and Asia. He was guest professor of composition at the University of Pennsylvania in 1965 and at the University of California, Davis in 1966–67. He founded and directed the Cologne Courses for New Music from 1963 to 1968, and was appointed Professor of Composition at the Hochschule für Musik Köln in 1971, where he taught until 1977. In 1998, he founded the Stockhausen Courses, which are held annually in Kürten.

====Publishing activities====
From the mid-1950s onward, Stockhausen designed (and in some cases arranged to have printed) his own musical scores for his publisher, Universal Edition, which often involved unconventional devices. The score for his piece &quot;Refrain&quot;, for instance, includes a rotatable (refrain) on a transparent plastic strip. Early in the 1970s, he ended his agreement with Universal Edition and began publishing his own scores under the Stockhausen-Verlag imprint. This arrangement allowed him to extend his notational innovations (for example, dynamics in &quot;Weltparlament&quot; [the first scene of &quot;Mittwoch aus Licht&quot;] are coded in colour) and resulted in eight German Music Publishers Society Awards between 1992 (&quot;Luzifers Tanz&quot;) and 2005 (&quot;Hoch-Zeiten&quot;, from &quot;Sonntag aus Licht&quot;). The &quot;Momente&quot; score, published just before Stockhausen&#x27;s death in 2007, won this prize for the ninth time.

In the early 1990s, Stockhausen reacquired the licenses to most of the recordings of his music he had made to that point, and started his own record company to make this music permanently available on Compact Disc.

===Death===
Stockhausen died of sudden heart failure on the morning of 5 December 2007 in Kürten, North Rhine-Westphalia. The night before, he had finished a recently commissioned work for performance by the Mozart Orchestra of Bologna. He was 79 years old.

==Compositions==

Stockhausen wrote 370 individual works. He often departs radically from musical tradition and his work is influenced by Olivier Messiaen, Edgard Varèse, and Anton Webern, as well as by film and by painters such as Piet Mondrian and Paul Klee.

===1950s===
Stockhausen began to compose in earnest only during his third year at the conservatory. His early student compositions remained out of the public eye until, in 1971, he published &quot;Chöre für Doris&quot;, &quot;Drei Lieder&quot; for alto voice and chamber orchestra, &quot;Choral&quot; for a cappella choir (all three from 1950), and a Sonatine for violin and piano (1951).

In August 1951, just after his first Darmstadt visit, Stockhausen began working with a form of athematic serial composition that rejected the twelve-tone technique of Schoenberg. He characterized many of these earliest compositions (together with the music of other, like-minded composers of the period) as &quot;punktuelle Musik&quot;, &quot;punctual&quot; or &quot;pointist&quot; music, commonly mistranslated as &quot;pointillist&quot;, though one critic concluded after analysing several of these early works that Stockhausen &quot;never really composed punctually&quot;. Compositions from this phase include &quot;Kreuzspiel&quot; (1951), the &quot;Klavierstücke I–IV&quot; (1952—the fourth of this first set of four &quot;Klavierstücke&quot;, titled &quot;Klavierstück IV&quot;, is specifically cited by Stockhausen as an example of &quot;punctual music&quot;, and the first (unpublished) versions of &quot;Punkte&quot; and &quot;Kontra-Punkte&quot; (1952). However, several works from these same years show Stockhausen formulating his &quot;first really ground-breaking contribution to the theory and, above all, practice of composition&quot;, that of &quot;group composition&quot;, found in Stockhausen&#x27;s works as early as 1952 and continuing throughout his compositional career. This principle was first publicly described by Stockhausen in a radio talk from December 1955, titled &quot;Gruppenkomposition: &quot;Klavierstück I&quot;&quot;.

In December 1952, he composed a &quot;Konkrete Etüde&quot;, realized in Pierre Schaeffer&#x27;s Paris musique concrète studio. In March 1953, he moved to the NWDR studio in Cologne and turned to electronic music with two &quot;Electronic Studies&quot; (1953 and 1954), and then introducing spatial placements of sound sources with his mixed &quot;concrète&quot; and electronic work &quot;Gesang der Jünglinge&quot; (1955–56). Experiences gained from the &quot;Studies&quot; made plain that it was an unacceptable oversimplification to regard timbres as stable entities. Reinforced by his studies with Meyer-Eppler, beginning in 1955, Stockhausen formulated new &quot;statistical&quot; criteria for composition, focussing attention on the aleatoric, directional tendencies of sound movement, &quot;the change from one state to another, with or without returning motion, as opposed to a fixed state&quot;. Stockhausen later wrote, describing this period in his compositional work, &quot;The first revolution occurred from 1952/53 as &quot;musique concrète&quot;, &quot;electronic tape music&quot;, and &quot;space music&quot;, entailing composition with transformers, generators, modulators, magnetophones, etc; the integration of concrete and abstract (synthetic) sound possibilities (also all noises), and the controlled projection of sound in space&quot;. His position as &quot;the leading German composer of his generation&quot; was established with &quot;Gesang der Jünglinge&quot; and three concurrently composed pieces in different media: &quot;Zeitmaße&quot; for five woodwinds, &quot;Gruppen&quot; for three orchestras, and &quot;Klavierstück XI&quot;. The principles underlying the latter three compositions are presented in Stockhausen&#x27;s best-known theoretical article, &quot;... wie die Zeit vergeht ...&quot; (&quot;... How Time Passes ...&quot;), first published in 1957 in vol. 3 of &quot;Die Reihe&quot;.

His work with electronic music and its utter fixity led him to explore modes of instrumental and vocal music in which performers&#x27; individual capabilities and the circumstances of a particular performance (e.g., hall acoustics) may determine certain aspects of a composition. He called this &quot;variable form&quot;. In other cases, a work may be presented from a number of different perspectives. In &quot;Zyklus&quot; (1959), for example, he began using graphic notation for instrumental music. The score is written so that the performance can start on any page, and it may be read upside down, or from right to left, as the performer chooses. Still other works permit different routes through the constituent parts. Stockhausen called both of these possibilities &quot;polyvalent form&quot;, which may be either open form (essentially incomplete, pointing beyond its frame), as with &quot;Klavierstück XI&quot; (1956), or &quot;closed form&quot; (complete and self-contained) as with &quot;Momente&quot; (1962–64/69).

In many of his works, elements are played off against one another, simultaneously and successively: in &quot;Kontra-Punkte&quot; (&quot;Against Points&quot;, 1952–53), which, in its revised form became his official &quot;opus 1&quot;, a process leading from an initial &quot;point&quot; texture of isolated notes toward a florid, ornamental ending is opposed by a tendency from diversity (six timbres, dynamics, and durations) toward uniformity (timbre of solo piano, a nearly constant soft dynamic, and fairly even durations). In &quot;Gruppen&quot; (1955–57), fanfares and passages of varying speed (superimposed durations based on the harmonic series) are occasionally flung between three full orchestras, giving the impression of movement in space.

In his &quot;Kontakte&quot; for electronic sounds (optionally with piano and percussion) (1958–60), he achieved for the first time an isomorphism of the four parameters of pitch, duration, dynamics, and timbre.

===1960s===
In 1960, Stockhausen returned to the composition of vocal music (for the first time since &quot;Gesang der Jünglinge&quot;) with &quot;Carré&quot; for four orchestras and four choirs. Two years later, he began an expansive cantata titled &quot;Momente&quot; (1962–64/69), for solo soprano, four choir groups and thirteen instrumentalists. In 1963, Stockhausen created &quot;Plus-Minus&quot;, &quot;2 × 7 pages for realisation&quot; containing basic note materials and a complex system of transformations to which those materials are to be subjected in order to produce an unlimited number of different compositions. Through the rest of the 1960s, he continued to explore such possibilities of &quot;process composition&quot; in works for live performance, such as &quot;Prozession&quot; (1967), &quot;Kurzwellen&quot;, and &quot;Spiral&quot; (both 1968), culminating in the verbally described &quot;intuitive music&quot; compositions of &quot;Aus den sieben Tagen&quot; (1968) and &quot;Für kommende Zeiten&quot; (1968–70). Some of his later works, such as &quot;Ylem&quot; (1972) and the first three parts of &quot;Herbstmusik&quot; (1974), also fall under this rubric. Several of these process compositions were featured in the all-day programmes presented at Expo 70, for which Stockhausen composed two more similar pieces, &quot;Pole&quot; for two players, and &quot;Expo&quot; for three. In other compositions, such as &quot;Stop&quot; for orchestra (1965), &quot;Adieu&quot; for wind quintet (1966), and the &quot;Dr. K Sextett&quot;, which was written in 1968–69 in honour of Alfred Kalmus of Universal Edition, he presented his performers with more restricted improvisational possibilities.

He pioneered live electronics in &quot;Mixtur&quot; (1964/67/2003) for orchestra and electronics, &quot;Mikrophonie I&quot; (1964) for tam-tam, two microphones, two filters with potentiometers (6 players), &quot;Mikrophonie II&quot; (1965) for choir, Hammond organ, and four ring modulators, and &quot;Solo&quot; for a melody instrument with feedback (1966). Improvisation also plays a part in all of these works, but especially in &quot;Solo&quot;. He also composed two electronic works for tape, &quot;Telemusik&quot; (1966) and &quot;Hymnen&quot; (1966–67). The latter also exists in a version with partially improvising soloists, and the third of its four &quot;regions&quot; in a version with orchestra. At this time, Stockhausen also began to incorporate pre-existent music from world traditions into his compositions. &quot;Telemusik&quot; was the first overt example of this trend.

In 1968, Stockhausen composed the vocal sextet &quot;Stimmung&quot;, for the Collegium Vocale Köln, an hour-long work based entirely on the overtones of a low B-flat. In the following year, he created &quot;Fresco&quot; for four orchestral groups, a &quot;Wandelmusik&quot; (&quot;foyer music&quot;) composition. This was intended to be played for about five hours in the foyers and grounds of the Beethovenhalle auditorium complex in Bonn, before, after, and during a group of (in part simultaneous) concerts of his music in the auditoriums of the facility. The overall project was given the title &quot;Musik für die Beethovenhalle&quot;. This had precedents in two collective-composition seminar projects that Stockhausen gave at Darmstadt in 1967 and 1968: &quot;Ensemble&quot; and &quot;Musik für ein Haus&quot;, and would have successors in the &quot;park music&quot; composition for five spatially separated groups, &quot;Sternklang&quot; (&quot;Star Sounds&quot;) of 1971, the orchestral work &quot;Trans&quot;, composed in the same year and the thirteen simultaneous &quot;musical scenes for soloists and duets&quot; titled &quot;Alphabet für Liège&quot; (1972).

===Space music and Expo &#x27;70===

Since the mid-1950s, Stockhausen had been developing concepts of spatialization in his works, not only in electronic music, such as the 5-channel &quot;Gesang der Jünglinge&quot; (1955–56) and &quot;Telemusik&quot; (1966), and 4-channel &quot;Kontakte&quot; (1958–60) and &quot;Hymnen&quot; (1966–67). Instrumental/vocal works like &quot;Gruppen&quot; for three orchestras (1955–57) and &quot;Carré&quot; for four orchestras and four choirs (1959–60) also exhibit this trait. In lectures such as &quot;Music in Space&quot; from 1958, he called for new kinds of concert halls to be built, &quot;suited to the requirements of spatial music&quot;. His idea was In 1968, the West German government invited Stockhausen to collaborate on the German Pavilion at the 1970 World Fair in Osaka and to create a joint multimedia project for it with artist Otto Piene. Other collaborators on the project included the pavilion&#x27;s architect, Fritz Bornemann, Fritz Winckel, director of the Electronic Music Studio at Technische Universität Berlin, and engineer Max Mengeringhausen. The pavilion theme was &quot;gardens of music&quot;, in keeping with which Bornemann intended &quot;planting&quot; the exhibition halls beneath a broad lawn, with a connected auditorium &quot;sprouting&quot; above ground. Initially, Bornemann conceived this auditorium in the form of an amphitheatre, with a central orchestra podium and surrounding audience space. In the summer of 1968, Stockhausen met with Bornemann and persuaded him to change this conception to a spherical space with the audience in the centre, surrounded by loudspeaker groups in seven rings at different &quot;latitudes&quot; around the interior walls of the sphere.

Although Stockhausen and Piene&#x27;s planned multimedia project, titled &quot;Hinab-Hinauf&quot;, was developed in detail, the World Fair committee rejected their concept as too extravagant and instead asked Stockhausen to present daily five-hour programs of his music. Stockhausen&#x27;s works were performed for 5½ hours every day over a period of 183 days to a total audience of about a million listeners. According to Stockhausen&#x27;s biographer, Michael Kurtz, &quot;Many visitors felt the spherical auditorium to be an oasis of calm amidst the general hubbub, and after a while it became one of the main attractions of Expo 1970&quot;.

===1970s===

Beginning with &quot;Mantra&quot; for two pianos and electronics (1970), Stockhausen turned to formula composition, a technique which involves the projection and multiplication of a single, double, or triple melodic-line formula. Sometimes, as in &quot;Mantra&quot; and the large orchestral composition with mime soloists, &quot;Inori&quot;, the simple formula is stated at the outset as an introduction. He continued to use this technique (e.g., in the two related solo-clarinet pieces, &quot;Harlekin&quot; [Harlequin] and &quot;Der kleine Harlekin&quot; [The Little Harlequin] of 1975, and the orchestral &quot;Jubiläum&quot; [Jubilee] of 1977) through the completion of the opera-cycle &quot;Licht&quot; in 2003. Some works from the 1970s did not employ formula technique—e.g., the vocal duet &quot;Am Himmel wandre ich&quot; (In the Sky I am Walking, one of the 13 components of the multimedia &quot;Alphabet für Liège&quot;, 1972, which Stockhausen developed in conversation with the British biophysicist and lecturer on mystical aspects of sound vibration Jill Purce), &quot;Laub und Regen&quot; (Leaves and Rain, from the theatre piece &quot;Herbstmusik&quot; (1974), the unaccompanied-clarinet composition &quot;Amour&quot;, and the choral opera &quot;Atmen gibt das Leben&quot; (Breathing Gives Life, 1974/77)—but nevertheless share its simpler, melodically oriented style. Two such pieces, &quot;Tierkreis&quot; (&quot;Zodiac&quot;, 1974–75) and &quot;In Freundschaft&quot; (In Friendship, 1977, a solo piece with versions for virtually every orchestral instrument), have become Stockhausen&#x27;s most widely performed and recorded compositions.

This dramatic simplification of style provided a model for a new generation of German composers, loosely associated under the label &quot;neue Einfachheit&quot; or New Simplicity. The best-known of these composers is Wolfgang Rihm, who studied with Stockhausen in 1972–73. His orchestral composition &quot;Sub-Kontur&quot; (1974–75) quotes the formula of Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Inori&quot; (1973–74), and he has also acknowledged the influence of &quot;Momente&quot; on this work.

Other large works by Stockhausen from this decade include the orchestral &quot;Trans&quot; (1971) and two music-theatre compositions utilizing the &quot;Tierkreis&quot; melodies: &quot;Musik im Bauch&quot; (&quot;Music in the Belly&quot;) for six percussionists (1975), and the science-fiction &quot;opera&quot; &quot;Sirius&quot; (1975–77) for eight-channel electronic music with soprano, bass, trumpet, and bass clarinet, which has four different versions for the four seasons, each lasting over an hour and a half.
===1977–2003===
Between 1977 and 2003, Stockhausen composed seven operas in a cycle titled &quot;Licht: Die sieben Tage der Woche&quot; (&quot;Light: The Seven Days of the Week&quot;). The &quot;Licht&quot; cycle deals with the traits associated in various historical traditions with each weekday (Monday = birth and fertility, Tuesday = conflict and war, Wednesday = reconciliation and cooperation, Thursday = traveling and learning, etc.) and with the relationships between three archetypal characters: Michael, Lucifer, and Eve. Each of these characters dominates one of the operas (&quot;Donnerstag&quot; [Thursday], &quot;Samstag&quot; [Saturday], and &quot;Montag&quot; [Monday], respectively), the three possible pairings are foregrounded in three others, and the equal combination of all three is featured in &quot;Mittwoch&quot; (Wednesday).

Stockhausen&#x27;s conception of opera was based significantly on ceremony and ritual, with influence from the Japanese Noh theatre, as well as Judeo-Christian and Vedic traditions. In 1968, at the time of the composition of &quot;Aus den sieben Tagen&quot;, Stockhausen had read a biography by Satprem about the Bengali guru Sri Aurobindo, and subsequently he also read many of the published writings by Aurobindo himself. The title of &quot;Licht&quot; owes something to Aurobindo&#x27;s theory of &quot;Agni&quot; (the Hindu and Vedic fire deity), developed from two basic premises of nuclear physics; Stockhausen&#x27;s definition of a formula and, especially, his conception of the &quot;Licht&quot; superformula, also owes a great deal to Sri Aurobindo&#x27;s category of the &quot;supramental&quot;. Similarly, his approach to voice and text sometimes departed from traditional usage: Characters were as likely to be portrayed by instrumentalists or dancers as by singers, and a few parts of &quot;Licht&quot; (e.g., &quot;Luzifers Traum&quot; from &quot;Samstag&quot;, &quot;Welt-Parlament&quot; from &quot;Mittwoch&quot;, &quot;Lichter-Wasser&quot; and &quot;Hoch-Zeiten&quot; from &quot;Sonntag&quot;) use written or improvised texts in simulated or invented languages.

The seven operas were not composed in &quot;weekday order&quot; but rather starting (apart from &quot;Jahreslauf&quot; in 1977, which became the first act of &quot;Dienstag&quot;) with the &quot;solo&quot; operas and working toward the more complex ones: &quot;Donnerstag&quot; (1978–80), &quot;Samstag&quot; (1981–83), &quot;Montag&quot; (1984–88), &quot;Dienstag&quot; (1977/1987–91), &quot;Freitag&quot; (1991–94), &quot;Mittwoch&quot; (1995–97), and finally &quot;Sonntag&quot; (1998–2003).

Stockhausen had dreams of flying throughout his life, and these dreams are reflected in the &quot;Helikopter-Streichquartett&quot; (the third scene of &quot;Mittwoch aus Licht&quot;), completed in 1993. In it, the four members of a string quartet perform in four helicopters flying independent flight paths over the countryside near the concert hall. The sounds they play are mixed together with the sounds of the helicopters and played through speakers to the audience in the hall. Videos of the performers are also transmitted back to the concert hall. The performers are synchronized with the aid of a click track, transmitted to them and heard over headphones.

The first performance of the piece took place in Amsterdam on 26 June 1995, as part of the Holland Festival. Despite its extremely unusual nature, the piece has been given several performances, including one on 22 August 2003 as part of the Salzburg Festival to open the Hangar-7 venue, and the German première on 17 June 2007 in Braunschweig as part of the Stadt der Wissenschaft 2007 Festival. The work has also been recorded by the Arditti Quartet.

In 1999 he was invited by Walter Fink to be the ninth composer featured in the annual Komponistenporträt of the Rheingau Musik Festival.

In 1999, BBC producer Rodney Wilson asked Stockhausen to collaborate with Stephen and Timothy Quay on a film for the fourth series of Sound on Film International. Although Stockhausen&#x27;s music had been used for films previously (most notably, parts of Hymnen in Nicolas Roeg&#x27;s &quot;Walkabout&quot; in 1971), this was the first time he had been asked to provide music specially for the purpose. He adapted 21 minutes of material taken from his electronic music for &quot;Freitag aus Licht&quot;, calling the result &quot;Zwei Paare&quot; (Two Couples), and the Brothers Quay created their animated film, which they titled &quot;In Absentia&quot;, based only on their reactions to the music and the simple suggestion that a window might be an idea to use. When, at a preview screening, Stockhausen saw the film, which shows a madwoman writing letters from a bleak asylum cell, he was moved to tears. The Brothers Quay were astonished to learn that his mother had been &quot;imprisoned by the Nazis in an asylum, where she later died. ... This was a very moving moment for us as well, especially because we had made the film without knowing any of this&quot;.

===2003–2007===
After completing &quot;Licht&quot;, Stockhausen embarked on a new cycle of compositions based on the hours of the day, &quot;Klang&quot; (&quot;Sound&quot;). Twenty-one of these pieces were completed before Stockhausen&#x27;s death. The first four works from this cycle are First Hour: &quot;Himmelfahrt&quot; (Ascension), for organ or synthesizer, soprano and tenor (2004–2005); Second Hour: &quot;Freude&quot; (Joy) for two harps (2005); Third Hour: &quot;Natürliche Dauern&quot; (Natural Durations) for piano (2005–2006); and Fourth Hour: &quot;Himmels-Tür&quot; (Heaven&#x27;s Door) for a percussionist and a little girl (2005). The Fifth Hour, &quot;Harmonien&quot; (Harmonies), is a solo in three versions for flute, bass clarinet, and trumpet (2006). The Sixth through Twelfth hours are chamber-music works based on the material from the Fifth Hour. The Thirteenth Hour, &quot;Cosmic Pulses&quot;, is an electronic work made by superimposing 24 layers of sound, each having its own spatial motion, among eight loudspeakers placed around the concert hall. Hours 14 through 21 are solo pieces for bass voice, baritone voice, basset-horn, horn, tenor voice, soprano voice, soprano saxophone, and flute, respectively, each with electronic accompaniment of a different set of three layers from &quot;Cosmic Pulses&quot;. The twenty-one completed pieces were first performed together as a cycle at the Festival MusikTriennale Köln on 8–9 May 2010, in 176 individual concerts.

==Theories==

In the 1950s and early 1960s, Stockhausen published a series of articles that established his importance in the area of music theory. Although these include analyses of music by Mozart, Debussy, Bartók, Stravinsky, Goeyvaerts, Boulez, Nono, Johannes Fritsch, Michael von Biel, and, especially, Webern, the items on compositional theory directly related to his own work are regarded as the most important generally. &quot;Indeed, the &quot;Texte&quot; come closer than anything else currently available to providing a general compositional theory for the postwar period&quot;. His most celebrated article is &quot;... wie die Zeit vergeht ...&quot; (&quot;... How Time Passes ...&quot;), first published in the third volume of &quot;Die Reihe&quot; (1957). In it, he expounds a number of temporal conceptions underlying his instrumental compositions &quot;Zeitmaße&quot;, &quot;Gruppen&quot;, and &quot;Klavierstück XI&quot;. In particular, this article develops (1) a scale of twelve tempos analogous to the chromatic pitch scale, (2) a technique of building progressively smaller, integral subdivisions over a basic (fundamental) duration, analogous to the overtone series, (3) musical application of the concept of the partial field (time fields and field sizes) in both successive and simultaneous proportions, (4) methods of projecting large-scale form from a series of proportions, (5) the concept of &quot;statistical&quot; composition, (6) the concept of &quot;action duration&quot; and the associated &quot;variable form&quot;, and (7) the notion of the &quot;directionless temporal field&quot; and with it, &quot;polyvalent form&quot;.

Other important articles from this period include &quot;Elektronische und Instrumentale Musik&quot; (&quot;Electronic and Instrumental Music&quot;, 1958), &quot;Musik im Raum&quot; (&quot;Music in Space&quot;, 1958), &quot;Musik und Graphik&quot; (&quot;Music and Graphics&quot;, 1959), &quot;Momentform&quot; (1960), &quot;Die Einheit der musikalischen Zeit&quot; (&quot;The Unity of Musical Time&quot;, 1961), and &quot;Erfindung und Entdeckung&quot; (&quot;Invention and Discovery&quot;, 1961), the last summing up the ideas developed up to 1961. Taken together, these temporal theories suggested that the entire compositional structure could be conceived as &quot;timbre&quot;: since &quot;the different experienced components such as colour, harmony and melody, meter and rhythm, dynamics, and form correspond to the different segmental ranges of this unified time&quot;, the total musical result at any given compositional level is simply the &quot;spectrum&quot; of a more basic duration—i.e., its &quot;timbre&quot;, perceived as the overall effect of the overtone structure of that duration, now taken to include not only the &quot;rhythmic&quot; subdivisions of the duration but also their relative &quot;dynamic&quot; strength, &quot;envelope&quot;, etc.
Compositionally considered, this produced a change of focus from the individual tone to a whole complex of tones related to one another by virtue of their relation to a &quot;fundamental&quot;—a change that was probably the most important compositional development of the latter part of the 1950s, not only for Stockhausen&#x27;s music but for &quot;advanced&quot; music in general. Some of these ideas, considered from a purely theoretical point of view (divorced from their context as explanations of particular compositions) drew significant critical fire. For this reason, Stockhausen ceased publishing such articles for a number of years, as he felt that &quot;many useless polemics&quot; about these texts had arisen, and he preferred to concentrate his attention on composing.

Through the 1960s, although he taught and lectured publicly, Stockhausen published little of an analytical or theoretical nature. Only in 1970 did he again begin publishing theoretical articles, with &quot;Kriterien&quot;, the abstract for his six seminar lectures for the Darmstädter Ferienkurse. The seminars themselves, covering seven topics (&quot;Micro- and Macro-Continuum&quot;, &quot;Collage and Metacollage&quot;, &quot;Expansion of the Scale of Tempos&quot;, &quot;Feedback&quot;, &quot;Spectral Harmony—Formant Modulation&quot;, &quot;Expansion of Dynamics—A Principle of &quot;Mikrophonie I&quot;&quot;, and &quot;Space Music—Spatial Forming and Notation&quot;) were published only posthumously.

His collected writings were published in &quot;Texte zur Musik&quot;, including his compositional theories and analyses on music as a general phenomenon.

==Reception==

===Musical influence===
Stockhausen has been described as &quot;one of the great visionaries of 20th-century music&quot;. His two early &quot;Electronic Studies&quot; (especially the second) had a powerful influence on the subsequent development of electronic music in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly in the work of the Italian Franco Evangelisti and the Poles Andrzej Dobrowolski and Włodzimierz Kotoński. The influence of his &quot;Kontra-Punkte&quot;, &quot;Zeitmaße&quot; and &quot;Gruppen&quot; may be seen in the work of many composers, including Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Threni&quot; (1957–58) and &quot;Movements&quot; for piano and orchestra (1958–59) and other works up to the &quot;Variations: Aldous Huxley in Memoriam&quot; (1963–64), whose rhythms &quot;are likely to have been inspired, at least in part, by certain passages from Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Gruppen&quot;&quot;. Though music of Stockhausen&#x27;s generation may seem an unlikely influence, Stravinsky said in a 1957 conversation: I have all around me the spectacle of composers who, after their generation has had its decade of influence and fashion, seal themselves off from further development and from the next generation (as I say this, exceptions come to mind, Krenek, for instance). Of course, it requires greater effort to learn from one&#x27;s juniors, and their manners are not invariably good. But when you are seventy-five and your generation has overlapped with four younger ones, it behooves you not to decide in advance &quot;how far composers can go&quot;, but to try to discover whatever new thing it is makes the new generation new.

Amongst British composers, Sir Harrison Birtwistle readily acknowledges the influence of Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Zeitmaße&quot; (especially on his two wind quintets, &quot;Refrains and Choruses&quot; and &quot;Five Distances&quot;) and &quot;Gruppen&quot; on his work more generally. Brian Ferneyhough says that, although the &quot;technical and speculative innovations&quot; of &quot;Klavierstücke I–IV&quot;, &quot;Kreuzspiel&quot; and &quot;Kontra-Punkte&quot; escaped him on first encounter, they nevertheless produced a &quot;sharp emotion, the result of a beneficial shock engendered by their boldness&quot; and provided &quot;an important source of motivation (rather than of imitation) for my own investigations&quot;. While still in school, he became fascinated upon hearing the British première of &quot;Gruppen&quot;, and listened many times to the recording of this performance, while trying to penetrate its secrets—how it always seemed to be about to explode, but managed nevertheless to escape unscathed in its core—but scarcely managed to grasp it. Retrospectively, it is clear that from this confusion was born my interest for the formal questions which remain until today. Although it eventually evolved in a direction of its own, Ferneyhough&#x27;s 1967 wind sextet, &quot;Prometheus&quot;, began as a wind quintet with cor anglais, stemming directly from an encounter with Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Zeitmaße&quot;. With respect to Stockhausen&#x27;s later work, he said, I have never subscribed (whatever the inevitable personal distance) to the thesis according to which the many transformations of vocabulary characterizing Stockhausen&#x27;s development are the obvious sign of his inability to carry out the early vision of strict order that he had in his youth. On the contrary, it seems to me that the constant reconsideration of his premises has led to the maintenance of a remarkably tough thread of historical consciousness which will become clearer with time. ... I doubt that there has been a single composer of the intervening generation who, even if for a short time, did not see the world of music differently thanks to the work of Stockhausen. In a short essay describing Stockhausen&#x27;s influence on his own work, Richard Barrett concludes that &quot;Stockhausen remains the composer whose next work I look forward most to hearing, apart from myself of course&quot; and names as works that have had particular impact on his musical thinking &quot;Mantra&quot;, &quot;Gruppen&quot;, &quot;Carré&quot;, &quot;Klavierstück X&quot;, &quot;Inori&quot;, and &quot;Jubiläum&quot;.

French composer and conductor Pierre Boulez once declared, &quot;Stockhausen is the greatest living composer, and the only one whom I recognize as my peer&quot;. Boulez also acknowledged the influence of performing Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Zeitmaße&quot; on his subsequent development as a conductor. Another French composer, Jean-Claude Éloy, regards Stockhausen as the most important composer of the second half of the 20th century, and cites virtually &quot;all his catalog of works&quot; as &quot;a powerful discoveration , and a true revelation&quot;.

Dutch composer Louis Andriessen acknowledged the influence of Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Momente&quot; in his pivotal work &quot;Contra tempus&quot; of 1968. German composer Wolfgang Rihm, who studied with Stockhausen, was influenced by &quot;Momente&quot;, &quot;Hymnen&quot;, and &quot;Inori&quot;.

At the Cologne ISCM Festival in 1960, the Danish composer Per Nørgård heard Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Kontakte&quot; as well as pieces by Kagel, Boulez, and Berio. He was profoundly affected by what he heard and his music suddenly changed into &quot;a far more discontinuous and disjunct style, involving elements of strict organization in all parameters, some degree of aleatoricism and controlled improvisation, together with an interest in collage from other musics&quot;.

Jazz musicians such as Miles Davis, Charles Mingus, Herbie Hancock, Yusef Lateef, and Anthony Braxton cite Stockhausen as an influence.

Stockhausen was influential within pop and rock music as well. Frank Zappa acknowledges Stockhausen in the liner notes of &quot;Freak Out!&quot;, his 1966 debut with The Mothers of Invention. On the back of The Who&#x27;s second LP released in the US, &quot;Happy Jack&quot;, their primary composer and guitarist Pete Townshend, is said to have &quot;an interest in Stockhausen&quot;. Rick Wright and Roger Waters of Pink Floyd also acknowledge Stockhausen as an influence. San Francisco psychedelic groups Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead are said to have done the same; Stockhausen said that the Grateful Dead were &quot;well orientated toward new music&quot;. Founding members of Cologne-based experimental band Can, Irmin Schmidt and Holger Czukay, both studied with Stockhausen at the Cologne Courses for New Music. German electronic pioneers Kraftwerk also say they studied with Stockhausen, and Icelandic vocalist Björk has acknowledged Stockhausen&#x27;s influence.

=== Wider cultural renown ===
Stockhausen, along with John Cage, is one of the few avant-garde composers to have succeeded in penetrating the popular consciousness. The Beatles included his face on the cover of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. In particular, &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; (1967) and &quot;Revolution 9&quot; (1968) were influenced by Stockhausen&#x27;s electronic music. Stockhausen&#x27;s name, and the perceived strangeness and supposed unlistenability of his music, was even a punchline in cartoons, as documented on a page on the official Stockhausen website (Stockhausen Cartoons). Perhaps the most caustic remark about Stockhausen was attributed to Sir Thomas Beecham. Asked &quot;Have you heard any Stockhausen?&quot;, he is alleged to have replied, &quot;No, but I believe I have trodden in some&quot;.

Stockhausen&#x27;s fame is also reflected in works of literature. For example, he is mentioned in Philip K. Dick&#x27;s 1974 novel &quot;Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said&quot;, and in Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s 1966 novel &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;. The Pynchon novel features &quot;The Scope&quot;, a bar with &quot;a strict electronic music policy&quot;. Protagonist Oedipa Maas asks &quot;a hip graybeard&quot; about a &quot;sudden chorus of whoops and yibbles&quot; coming out of &quot;a kind of jukebox.&quot; He replies, &quot;That&#x27;s by Stockhausen ... the early crowd tends to dig your Radio Cologne sound. Later on we really swing&quot;.

The French writer Michel Butor acknowledges that Stockhausen&#x27;s music &quot;taught me a lot&quot;, mentioning in particular the electronic works &quot;Gesang der Jünglinge&quot; and &quot;Hymnen&quot;.

Later in his life, Stockhausen was portrayed by at least one journalist, John O&#x27;Mahony of the &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper, as an eccentric, for example being alleged to live an effectively polygamous lifestyle with two women, to whom O&#x27;Mahony referred as his &quot;wives&quot;, while at the same time stating he was not married to either of them. In the same article, O&#x27;Mahony says Stockhausen said he was born on a planet orbiting the star Sirius. In the German newspaper &quot;Die Zeit&quot;, Stockhausen stated that he was educated at Sirius (see Sirius star system below).

In 1995, BBC Radio 3 sent Stockhausen a package of recordings from contemporary techno and ambient music artists Aphex Twin, Richie Hawtin (Plastikman), Scanner and Daniel Pemberton, and asked him for his opinion on the music. In August of that year, Radio 3 reporter Dick Witts interviewed Stockhausen about these pieces for a broadcast in October, called &quot;The Technocrats&quot; and asked what advice he would give these young musicians. Stockhausen made suggestions to each and they were then invited to respond. All but Plastikman obliged.

===Critical reception===
Robin Maconie finds that, &quot;Compared to the work of his contemporaries, Stockhausen&#x27;s music has a depth and rational integrity that is quite outstanding... His researches, initially guided by Meyer-Eppler, have a coherence unlike any other composer then or since&quot;. Maconie also compares Stockhausen to Beethoven: &quot;If a genius is someone whose ideas survive all attempts at explanation, then by that definition Stockhausen is the nearest thing to Beethoven this century has produced. Reason? His music lasts&quot;, and &quot;As Stravinsky said, one never thinks of Beethoven as a superb orchestrator because the quality of invention transcends mere craftsmanship. It is the same with Stockhausen: the intensity of imagination gives rise to musical impressions of an elemental and seemingly unfathomable beauty, arising from necessity rather than conscious design&quot;.

Christopher Ballantine, comparing the categories of experimental and avant-garde music, concludes that Perhaps more than any other contemporary composer, Stockhausen exists at the point where the dialectic between experimental and avant-garde music becomes manifest; it is in him, more obviously than anywhere else, that these diverse approaches converge. This alone would seem to suggest his remarkable significance.

Igor Stravinsky expressed great, but not uncritical, enthusiasm for Stockhausen&#x27;s music in the conversation books with Robert Craft, and for years organised private listening sessions with friends in his home where he played tapes of Stockhausen&#x27;s latest works. In an interview published in March 1968, however, he says of an unidentified person, I have been listening all week to the piano music of a composer now greatly esteemed for his ability to stay an hour or so ahead of his time, but I find the alternation of note-clumps and silences of which it consists more monotonous than the foursquares of the dullest eighteenth-century music. The following October, a report in &quot;Sovetskaia Muzyka&quot; translated this sentence (and a few others from the same article) into Russian, substituting for the conjunction &quot;but&quot; the phrase &quot;Ia imeiu v vidu Karlkheintsa Shtokkhauzena&quot; (&quot;I am referring to Karlheinz Stockhausen&quot;). When this translation was quoted in Druskin&#x27;s Stravinsky biography, the field was widened to &quot;all&quot; of Stockhausen&#x27;s compositions and Druskin adds for good measure, &quot;indeed, works he calls unnecessary, useless and uninteresting&quot;, again quoting from the same &quot;Sovetskaia Muzyka&quot; article, even though it had made plain that the characterization was of American &quot;university composers&quot;.

===Controversy===
Throughout his career, Stockhausen excited controversy. One reason for this is that his music displays high expectations about &quot;shaping and transforming the world, about the truth of life and of reality, about the creative departure into a future determined by spirit&quot;, so that Stockhausen&#x27;s work &quot;like no other in the history of new music, has a polarizing effect, arouses passion, and provokes drastic opposition, even hatred&quot;. Another reason was acknowledged by Stockhausen himself in a reply to a question during an interview on the Bavarian Radio on 4 September 1960, reprinted as a foreword to his first collection of writings: 
After the student revolts in 1968, musical life in Germany became highly politicized, and Stockhausen found himself a target for criticism, especially from the leftist camp who wanted music &quot;in the service of the class struggle&quot;. Cornelius Cardew and Konrad Boehmer denounced their former teacher as a &quot;servant of capitalism&quot;. In a climate where music mattered less than political ideology, some critics held that Stockhausen was too élitist, while others complained he was too mystical.

====Scandal at the &quot;Fresco&quot; premiere====

As reported in the German magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, the première (and only performance to date) on 15 November 1969 of Stockhausen&#x27;s work &quot;Fresco&quot; for four orchestral groups (playing in four different locations) was the scene of a scandal. The rehearsals were already marked by objections from the orchestral musicians questioning such directions as &quot;glissandos no faster than one octave per minute&quot; and others phoning the artists&#x27; union to clarify whether they really had to perform the Stockhausen work as part of the orchestra. In the backstage warm-up room at the premiere a hand-lettered sign could be seen saying: &quot;We&#x27;re playing, otherwise we would be fired&quot;. During the première the parts on some music stands suddenly were replaced by placards reading things like &quot;Stockhausen-Zoo. Please don&#x27;t feed&quot;, that someone had planted. Some musicians, fed up with the monkeyshines, left after an hour, though the performance was planned for four to five hours. Stockhausen fans protested, while Stockhausen foes were needling the musicians asking: &quot;How can you possibly participate in such crap?&quot; (&quot;Wie könnt ihr bloß so eine Scheiße machen!&quot;). At one point someone managed to switch off the stand lights, leaving the musicians in the dark. After 260 minutes the performance ended with no-one participating any longer.

====Sirius star system====
In an obituary in the German newspaper &quot;Die Zeit&quot;, Karlheinz Stockhausen was quoted as having said: &quot;I was educated at Sirius and want to return to there, although I am still living in Kürten near Cologne.&quot; On hearing about this, conductor Michael Gielen stated: &quot;When he said he knew what was happening at Sirius, I turned away from him in horror. I haven&#x27;t listened to a note since.&quot; He called Stockhausen&#x27;s statements &quot;hubris&quot; and &quot;nonsense&quot;, while at the same time defending his own belief in astrology: &quot;Why should these large celestial bodies exist if they do not stand for something? I cannot imagine that there is anything senseless in the universe. There is much we do not understand&quot;.

====11 September attacks====
In a press conference in Hamburg on 16 September 2001, Stockhausen was asked by a journalist whether the characters in &quot;Licht&quot; were for him &quot;merely some figures out of a common cultural history&quot; or rather &quot;material appearances&quot;. Stockhausen replied, &quot;I pray daily to Michael, but not to Lucifer. I have renounced him. But he is very much present, like in New York recently.&quot; The same journalist then asked how the events of 11 September had affected him, and how he viewed reports of the attack in connection with the harmony of humanity represented in &quot;Hymnen&quot;. He answered:Well, what happened there is, of course—now all of you must adjust your brains—the biggest work of art there has ever been. The fact that spirits achieve with one act something which we in music could never dream of, that people practise ten years madly, fanatically for a concert. And then die. [Hesitantly.] And that is the greatest work of art that exists for the whole Cosmos. Just imagine what happened there. There are people who are so concentrated on this single performance, and then five thousand people are driven to Resurrection. In one moment. I couldn&#x27;t do that. Compared to that, we are nothing, as composers. [...] It is a crime, you know of course, because the people did not agree to it. They did not come to the &quot;concert&quot;. That is obvious. And nobody had told them: &quot;You could be killed in the process.&quot;

As a result of the reaction to the press report of Stockhausen&#x27;s comments, a four-day festival of his work in Hamburg was cancelled. In addition, his pianist daughter announced to the press that she would no longer appear under the name &quot;Stockhausen&quot;. In a subsequent message, he stated that the press had published &quot;false, defamatory reports&quot; about his comments, and said:

At the press conference in Hamburg, I was asked if Michael, Eve and Lucifer were historical figures of the past and I answered that they exist now, for example Lucifer in New York. In my work, I have defined Lucifer as the cosmic spirit of rebellion, of anarchy. He uses his high degree of intelligence to destroy creation. He does not know love. After further questions about the events in America, I said that such a plan appeared to be Lucifer&#x27;s greatest work of art. Of course I used the designation &quot;work of art&quot; to mean the work of destruction personified in Lucifer. In the context of my other comments this was unequivocal.

<text>Kenneth Macrae MacLeod (born 2 August 1954) is a Scottish science fiction writer. His novels &quot;The Sky Road&quot; and &quot;The Night Sessions&quot; won the BSFA Award. MacLeod&#x27;s novels have been nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke, Hugo, Nebula, Locus, and Campbell Memorial awards for best novel on multiple occasions. 
In 2024 Ken MacLeod was one of the Guests of Honour at Glasgow: A Worldcon For Our Futures.

A techno-utopianist, MacLeod&#x27;s work makes frequent use of libertarian socialist themes; he is a three-time winner of the libertarian Prometheus Award. He sits on the advisory board of the Edinburgh Science Festival. MacLeod has been chosen as a Guest of Honor at the 82nd World Science Fiction Convention in Glasgow.

== Biography ==
MacLeod was born in Stornoway, Scotland in 1954. He graduated from University of Glasgow with a degree in zoology in 1976 and worked as a computer programmer and wrote a masters thesis on biomechanics. He was a Trotskyist activist in the 1970s and early 1980s MacLeod is opposed to Scottish independence.

== Personal life ==
Married with two children, he lived in South Queensferry near Edinburgh before moving to Gourock, on the Firth of Clyde, in June 2017.

==Writing==
He is part of a group of British science fiction writers who specialise in hard science fiction and space opera. His contemporaries include Neal Asher, Stephen Baxter, Iain M. Banks, Paul J. McAuley, Alastair Reynolds, Adam Roberts, Charles Stross, Richard K. Morgan, and Liz Williams.

His science fiction novels often explore socialist, communist, and anarchist political ideas, especially Trotskyism and anarcho-capitalism (or extreme economic libertarianism). Technical themes encompass singularities, divergent human cultural evolution, and post-human cyborg-resurrection. MacLeod&#x27;s general outlook can be best described as techno-utopian socialist, though unlike a majority of techno-utopians, he has expressed great scepticism over the possibility and especially over the desirability of strong AI.

He is known for his constant in-joking and punning on the intersection between socialist ideologies and computer programming, as well as other fields. For example, his chapter titles such as &quot;Trusted Third Parties&quot; or &quot;Revolutionary Platform&quot; usually have double (or multiple) meanings. A future programmers union is called &quot;Information Workers of the World Wide Web&quot;, or the &quot;Webblies&quot;, a reference to the Industrial Workers of the World, who are nicknamed the &quot;Wobblies&quot;. The Webblies idea formed a central part of the novel &quot;For the Win&quot; by Cory Doctorow and MacLeod is acknowledged as coining the term. Doctorow and Charles Stross also used one of MacLeod&#x27;s references to the singularity as &quot;the rapture for nerds&quot; as the title for their collaborative novel &quot;Rapture of the Nerds&quot; (although MacLeod denies coining the phrase). There are also many references to, or puns on, zoology and palaeontology. For example, in &quot;The Stone Canal&quot; the title of the book, and many places described in it, are named after anatomical features of marine invertebrates such as starfish.

==Books about MacLeod==
The Science Fiction Foundation have published an analysis of MacLeod&#x27;s work titled &quot;The True Knowledge Of Ken MacLeod&quot; (2003; ), edited by Andrew M. Butler and Farah Mendlesohn. As well as critical essays it contains material by MacLeod himself, including his introduction to the German edition of Banks&#x27; &quot;Consider Phlebas&quot;.

Descent is about flying saucers, hidden races, and Antonio Gramsci&#x27;s concept of passive revolution, all set in a tale of Scottish middle class family life in and after the Great Depression of the 21st Century. Almost mainstream fiction, really.&quot;

<doc id="17270" wikidata="Q1139762" url="?curid=17270" title="Kanem–Bornu Empire">
<text>The Kanem–Bornu Empire existed in areas which are now part of Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon, Libya and Chad. It was known to the Arabian geographers as the Kanem Empire from the 8th century AD onward and lasted as the independent kingdom of Bornu (the Bornu Empire) until 1900.

The Kanem Empire (c. 700–1380) was located in the present countries of Chad, Nigeria and Libya. At its height, it encompassed an area covering not only most of Chad but also parts of southern Libya (Fezzan) and eastern Niger, northeastern Nigeria and northern Cameroon. The Bornu Empire (1380s–1893) was a state in what is now northeastern Nigeria, in time becoming even larger than Kanem, incorporating areas that are today parts of Chad, Niger and Cameroon.

The early history of the empire is mainly known from the Royal Chronicle, or &quot;Girgam&quot;, discovered in 1851 by the German traveller Heinrich Barth. Remnant successor regimes of the empire, in form of Borno Emirate and Dikwa Emirate, were established around 1900 and still exist today as traditional states within Nigeria.

==Theories on the origin of Kanem==
Kanem was located at the southern end of the trans-Saharan trade route between Tripoli and the region of Lake Chad. Besides its urban elite, it also included a confederation of nomadic peoples who spoke languages of the Teda–Daza group, the Toubou people or Berber people

In the 8th century, Wahb ibn Munabbih used Zaghawa to describe the Teda-Tubu group, in the earliest use of the ethnic name. Al-Khwarizmi also mentions the Zaghawa in the 9th century, as did ibn al-Nadim in his &quot;Al-Fihrist&quot; in the 10th century.

Kanem comes from &quot;anem&quot;, meaning &quot;south&quot; in the Teda and Kanuri languages, and hence a geographic term. During the first millennium, as the Sahara underwent desiccation, people speaking Kanembu migrated to Kanem in the south. This group contributed to the formation of the Kanuri. Kanuri traditions state the Zaghawa dynasty led a group of nomads called the Magumi.

This desiccation of the Sahara resulted in two settlements, those speaking Teda-Daza northeast of Lake Chad, and those speaking Chadic languages west of the lake in Bornu and Hausaland.

===Founding by local Kanembu (Dugua) c. 700===
The origins of Kanem are unclear. The first historical sources tend to show that the kingdom of Kanem began forming around 700 under the nomadic Tebu-speaking Kanembu. The Kanembu were supposedly forced southwest towards the fertile lands around Lake Chad by political pressure and desiccation in their former range. The area already possessed walled city-states belonging to the Sao civilisation. Under the leadership of the Duguwa dynasty, the Kanembu would eventually dominate the Sao, but not before adopting many of their customs. War between the two continued up to the late 16th century.

===Diffusionist theories===
One scholar, Dierk Lange, has proposed another theory based on a diffusionist ideology. Based on the written and oral traditions of Kanem-Bornu, which place the origin of the ruling Sefuwa dynasty in the Near East, Lange connects the creation of Kanem–Bornu with the departure from the collapsed Neo-Assyrian Empire c. 600 BC to the northeast of Lake Chad.
He also proposes that the lost state of Agisymba (mentioned by Ptolemy in the middle of the 2nd century) was the antecedent of the Kanem Empire. This theory has been criticized for lacking direct and clear evidence.

According to the &quot;Diwan salatin Barnu&quot; (“the chronicle of the kings of Bornu.”), the Sefuwa kings were ethnically distinct from their subjects until the thirteenth century. With respect to the king Salmama (1176–1203) the chronicle notes: “From Sultan Sayf to him, no sultan was born black, but they were red like the Beduin Arabs.”

==History==

===Duguwa or Dougouwa dynasty (700–1086)===

Climate change ensured the rise of the early Kanem–Bornu Empire, as desertification that increased the spread of the Sahara made some areas around Lake Chad unlivable, causing nomadic peoples from that area to navigate to the places where the empire would eventually be centralized.

Kanem was connected via a trans-Saharan slave trade route with Tripoli via Bilma in the Kawar. Slaves were imported from the south along this route. In the 16th-century, Turkish musketeers where imported to Bornu, and in the 17th-century, European slaves are noted to have been imported to Bornu from the Barbary slave trade in Tripoli in Libya.

Kanuri tradition states Sayf ibn Dhi Yazan established dynastic rule over the nomads around the 9th century through divine kingship. For the next millennium, the Mais ruled the Kanuri, which included the Ngalaga, Kangu, Kayi, Kuburi, Kaguwa, Tomagra, and Tubu.

Kanem is mentioned as one of three great empires in the Sudan region, by Ya&#x27;qubi in 872. He describes the kingdom of &quot;the Zaghāwa who live in a place called Kānim&quot;, which included several vassal states. &quot;Their dwellings are huts made of reeds and they have no towns.&quot; Living as nomads, their cavalry gave them military superiority. In the 10th century, al-Muhallabi mentions two towns in the kingdom, one of which was Mānān. Their king was considered divine, believing he could &quot;bring life and death, sickness and health&quot;. Wealth was measured in livestock, sheep, cattle, camels and horses. From al-Bakri in the 11th century onwards, the kingdom is referred to as &quot;Kanem&quot;. In the 12th century Muhammad al-Idrisi described Mānān as &quot;a small town without industry of any sort and little commerce&quot;. Ibn Sa&#x27;id al-Maghribi describes Mānān as the capital of the Kanem kings in the 13th century and Kanem as a powerful Muslim kingdom.

===Saifawa dynasty (850–1846)===

Kanuri-speaking Muslims gained control of Kanem from the Zaghawa nomads in the 9th century during a period of ethnic conflict. Kanuri legend states that Sayf ibn Dhi Yazan founded the Sayfawa dynasty. The new dynasty controlled the Zaghawa trade links in the central Sahara with Bilma and other salt mines. Yet, the principal trade commodity was slaves. Tribes to the south of Lake Chad were raided as &quot;kafirun&quot;, and then transported to Zawila in the Fezzan, where the slaves were traded for horses and weapons. The annual number of slaves traded increased from 1000 in the 7th century to 5000 in the 15th.

According to Richmond Palmer, it was customary to have &quot;the Mai sitting in a curtained cage called &quot;fanadir,&quot; &quot;dagil,&quot; or &quot;tatatuna&quot;... a large cage for a wild animal, with vertical wooden bars.&quot;

Mai Hummay began his reign in 1075, and formed alliances with the Kay, Toubou, Dabir, and Magumi. He became the first Muslim king of Kanem, having been converted by his Muslim tutor Muhammad Mānī. They remained nomadic until the 11th century, when they fixed their capital at Nijmi.

Humai&#x27;s successor, Dunama I (1098–1151), performed the Hajj three times before drowning at Aidab. At this time, the army included 100,000 horsemen and 120,000 soldiers.

====Mai Dunama Dubbalemi====
Kanem&#x27;s expansion peaked during the long and energetic reign of &quot;Mai&quot; Dunama Dabbalemi (1210–1259). Dabbalemi initiated diplomatic exchanges with sultans in North Africa, sending a giraffe to the Hafsid monarch and arranged for the establishment of a madrasa of al-Rashid in Cairo to facilitate pilgrimages to Mecca. During his reign, he declared jihad against the surrounding tribes and initiated an extended period of conquest with his cavalry of 41,000. He fought the Bulala for seven years, seven months, and seven days. After dominating the Fezzan, he established a governor at Traghan and delegated military command amongst his sons. As the Sayfawa extended control beyond Kanuri tribal lands, fiefs were granted to military commanders, as &quot;cima&quot;, or &#x27;master of the frontier&#x27;. Civil discord was said to follow his opening of the sacred Mune.

====Shift of the Sayfuwa court from Kanem to Bornu====
By the end of the 14th century, internal struggles and external attacks had torn Kanem apart. War with the Sao brought the death of four Mai: Selemma, Kure Ghana es-Saghir, Kure Kura al-Kabir, and Muhammad I, all sons of &#x27;Abdullāh b. Kadai. Then, war with the Bulala resulted in the death of four Mai in succession between 1377 and 1387: Daud Nigalemi, Uthmān b. Dawūd, Uthmān b. Idris, and Abu Bakr Liyatu. Finally, around 1387 the Bulala forced &quot;Mai&quot; Umar b. Idris to abandon Njimi and move the Kanembu people to Bornu on the western edge of Lake Chad.

But even in Bornu, the Sayfawa dynasty&#x27;s troubles persisted. During the first three-quarters of the 15th century, for example, fifteen Mais occupied the throne. Then, around 1460 Ali Gazi (1473–1507) defeated his rivals and began the consolidation of Bornu. He built a fortified capital at Ngazargamu, to the west of Lake Chad (in present-day Nigeria), the first permanent home a Sayfawa &quot;mai&quot; had enjoyed in a century. So successful was the Sayfawa rejuvenation that by the early 16th century &quot;Mai&quot; Idris Katakarmabe (1507–1529) was able to defeat the Bulala and retake Njimi, the former capital. The empire&#x27;s leaders, however, remained at Ngazargamu because its lands were more productive agriculturally and better suited to the raising of cattle. Ali Gaji was the first ruler of the empire to assume the title of Caliph.

====Mai Idris Alooma====
Bornu peaked during the reign of Mai Idris Alooma (c. 1564–1596), reaching the limits of its greatest territorial expansion, gaining control over Hausaland, and the people of Ahir and Tuareg. Peace was made with Bulala, when a demarcation of boundaries was agreed upon with a non-aggression pact. Military innovations included the use of mounted Turkish musketeers, slave musketeers, mailed cavalrymen, footmen and feats of military engineering as seen during the siege of the fortified town of Amsaka. This army was organized into an advance guard and a rear reserve while often using shield wall methods as well. The Bornu army was transported via camel or large boats and fed by free and slave women cooks, and often employed a scorched earth policy if necessary for the conquest of fortified towns and other strongholds. &quot;Ribāts&quot; were built on frontiers, and trade routes to the north were secure, allowing relations to be established with the Pasha of Tripoli and the Turkish empire. Between 1574 and 1583, the Borno sultan had diplomatic relations with the Ottoman sultan Murad III, as well as with the Moroccan sultan Ahmad al-Mansur, in the context of political tensions in the Sahara. The Borno sultan allied with the Moroccan sultan against the Ottoman imperialism in the Sahara. Ibn Furtu called Alooma Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin, after he implemented Sharia, and relied upon large fiefholders to ensure justice.

The Lake Chad to Tripoli route became an active highway in the 17th century, with horses traded for slaves. An intense diplomatic activity has been reported between Borno and the Pachalik of Tripoli at that time. About two million slaves traveled this route to be traded in Tripoli, the largest slave market in the Mediterranean. As Martin Meredith states, &quot;Wells along the way were surrounded by the skeletons of thousands of slaves, mostly young women and girls, making a last desperate effort to reach water before dying of exhaustion once there.&quot;

====Successors====
Most of the successors of Idris Alooma are only known from the meagre information provided by the &quot;Diwan&quot;. Some of them are noted for having undertaken the pilgrimage to Mecca, others for their piety. In the eighteenth century, Bornu was affected by several long-lasting famines. The Sultanate of Agadez was independently operating the Bilma salt mines by 1750, having been a tributary since 1532.

The administrative reforms and military brilliance of Aluma sustained the empire until the mid-17th century when its power began to fade. By the late 18th century, Bornu rule extended only westward, into the land of the Hausa of modern Nigeria. The empire was still ruled by the Mai who was advised by his councilors (&quot;kokenawa&quot;) in the state council or &quot;nokena&quot;. The members of his Nokena council included his sons and daughters and other royalty (the Maina) and non-royalty (the Kokenawa, &quot;new men&quot;). The Kokenawa included free men and slave eunuchs known as &quot;kachela&quot;. The latter &quot;had come to play a very important part in Bornu politics, as eunuchs did in many Muslim courts&quot;.

During the 17th century and 18th century, Bornu became a centre for Islamic learning. Borno sultans developed a political legitimacy based on their religious charisma, in the context of the rise of Sufism in Sahel. Islam and the Kanuri language was widely adopted, while slave raiding propelled the economy.

====Fulani Jihad====
Around this time, Fulani people invading from the west were able to make major inroads into Bornu during the Fulani War. By the early 19th century, Kanem–Bornu was clearly an empire in decline, and in 1808 Fulani warriors conquered Ngazargamu. Usman dan Fodio led the Fulani thrust and proclaimed a jihad (holy war) on the irreligious Muslims of the area. His campaign eventually affected Kanem–Bornu and inspired a trend toward Islamic orthodoxy.

====Muhammad al-Kanemi====

Muhammad al-Amin al-Kanemi, who was of mixed Kanuri and Shuwa Arab heritage from Fezzan contested the Fulani incursions into Bornu. Al-Kanemi was a Muslim scholar who had put together an alliance of mostly Shuwa Arabs, and Kanembu within the region. He eventually built in 1814 a capital at Kukawa (in present-day Nigeria). After the creation of his capital at Kukawa, Al-Kanemi quickly amassed a large following within Bornu and adopted the title of Shehu within Bornuan society and quickly supplanted the rule of the Mais who became figurehead monarchs. In the year of 1846, the last &quot;mai&quot;, in league with the Ouaddai Empire, precipitated a civil war, resulting in the death of Mai Ibrahim, the last mai. It was at that point that Kanemi&#x27;s son, Umar, became Shehu, thus ending one of the longest dynastic reigns in international history. By then, Hausaland in the west, was lost to the Sokoto Caliphate, while the east and north were lost to the Wadai Empire.

===Shehu of Borno===

Although the dynasty ended, the kingdom of Kanem–Bornu survived. Umar eschewed the title &quot;mai&quot; for the simpler designation &quot;shehu&quot; (from the Arabic &quot;shaykh&quot;), could not match his father&#x27;s vitality, and gradually allowed the kingdom to be ruled by advisers (&quot;wazirs&quot;). Bornu began a further decline as a result of administrative disorganization, regional particularism, and attacks by the militant Waddai Empire to the east. The decline continued under Umar&#x27;s sons. In 1893, Rabih az-Zubayr led an invading army from eastern Sudan and conquered Bornu. Rabih&#x27;s invasion led to the deaths of Shehu Ashimi, Shehu Kyari, and Shehu Sanda Wuduroma between 1893 and 1894. The British recognized Rabih as the &#x27;Sultan of Borno&#x27;, until the French killed Rabih on 22 April 1900 during the Battle of Kousséri.

The French then occupied Dikwa, Rabih&#x27;s capital, in April 1902, after the British had occupied Borno in March. Yet, based on their 1893 treaty, most of Borno remained under British control, while the Germans occupied eastern Borno, including Dikwa, as &#x27;Deutsch-Bornu&#x27;. The French did name Abubakar, the Shehu of Dikwa Emirate, until the British convinced him to be the Shehu of the Borno Emirate. The French then named his brother, Sanda, Shehu of Dikwa. Shehu Garbai formed a new capital, Yerwa, on 9 January 1907. After World War I, Deutsch-Bornu became the British Northern Cameroons.

Upon Shehu Abubakar&#x27;s death in 1922, Sanda Kura became Shehu of Borno. Upon his death in 1937, his cousin, Shehu of Dikwa Sanda Kyarimi, became Shehu of Borno. As Vincent Hiribarren points out, &quot;By becoming Shehu of the whole of Borno, Sanda Kyarimi reunited under his rule a territory which had been divided since 1902. For 35 years two Shehus had co-existed.&quot; In 1961, the Northern Cameroons voted to join Nigeria, effectively rejoining the territories of the kingdom of Bornu. The lands of the Bornu state were thus absorbed into the new Northern Nigeria Protectorate, in the sphere of the British Empire, and eventually became part of the independent state of Nigeria. A remnant of the old kingdom was (and still is) allowed to continue to exist, in subjection to the various Governments of the country as the Borno Emirate.

<text>Konstantin Ustinovich Chernenko (24 September 1911 – 10 March 1985) was a Soviet politician and the seventh General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He briefly led the Soviet Union from 1984 until his death a year later.

Born to a poor Ukrainian family in Siberia, Chernenko joined the Komsomol in 1929 and became a full member of the party in 1931. After holding a series of propaganda posts, in 1948 he became the head of the propaganda department in Moldavia, serving under Leonid Brezhnev. After Brezhnev took over as First Secretary of the CPSU in 1964, Chernenko was appointed to head the General Department of the Central Committee. In this capacity, he became responsible for setting the agenda for the Politburo and drafting Central Committee decrees. By 1971 Chernenko became a full member of the Central Committee and later a full member of the Politburo in 1978.

Following the death of Brezhnev and his successor Yuri Andropov, Chernenko was elected General Secretary in February 1984 and made Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in April 1984. However, due to his rapidly failing health, he was often unable to fulfill his official duties. He died in March 1985 after leading the country for only 13 months, and was succeeded as General Secretary by Mikhail Gorbachev.

==Early life and political career==
===Origins===
Chernenko was born to a poor family of Ukrainian ethnicity in the Siberian village of Bolshaya Tes (now in Novosyolovsky District, Krasnoyarsk Krai) on 24 September 1911.

Chernenko joined the Komsomol (Communist Youth League) in 1929. By 1931 he became a full member of the ruling Communist Party. From 1930 to 1933, he served in the Soviet frontier guards on the Soviet–Chinese border. After completing his military service, he returned to Krasnoyarsk as a propagandist. In 1933 he worked in the Propaganda Department of the Novosyolovsky District Party Committee. A few years later he was promoted to head of the same department in Uyarsk Raykom.

Chernenko steadily rose through the Party ranks, becoming the Director of the Krasnoyarsk House of Party Enlightenment before being named Deputy Head of the Agitprop Department of Krasnoyarsk&#x27;s Territorial Committee in 1939. In the early 1940s, he began a close relationship with Fyodor Kulakov and was named Secretary of the Territorial Party Committee for Propaganda. By 1945 he acquired a diploma from a party training school in Moscow then later finished a correspondence course for schoolteachers in 1953.

===Rise to the Soviet leadership===

The turning point in Chernenko&#x27;s career was his assignment in 1948 to head the Communist Party&#x27;s propaganda department in the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. There, he met and won the confidence of Leonid Brezhnev, the first secretary of the Moldavian branch of the Communist Party from 1950 to 1952 and future leader of the Soviet Union. Chernenko followed Brezhnev in 1956 to fill a similar propaganda post in the CPSU Central Committee in Moscow. In 1960 after Brezhnev was named chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (titular head of state of the Soviet Union), Chernenko became his chief of staff.

In 1964, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev was deposed, and succeeded by Brezhnev. During Brezhnev&#x27;s tenure as Party leader, Chernenko&#x27;s career continued successfully. He was nominated in 1965 as head of the General Department of the Central Committee, and given the mandate to set the Politburo agenda and prepare drafts of numerous Central Committee decrees and resolutions. He also monitored telephone wiretaps and covert listening devices in various offices of the top Party members. Another of his jobs was to sign hundreds of Party documents daily, a job he did for the next 20 years. Even after he became General Secretary of the Party, he continued to sign papers referring to the General Department (when he could no longer physically sign documents, a facsimile was used instead).

In 1971, Chernenko was promoted to full membership in the Central Committee: overseeing Party work over the Letter Bureau, dealing with correspondence. In 1976 he was elected secretary of the Letter Bureau. He became Candidate in 1977, and in 1978 a full member of the Politburo, second to the General Secretary in the Party hierarchy.

During Brezhnev&#x27;s final years, Chernenko became fully immersed in ideological Party work: heading Soviet delegations abroad, accompanying Brezhnev to important meetings and conferences, and working as a member of the commission that revised the Soviet Constitution in 1977. In 1979, he took part in the Vienna arms limitation talks.

After Brezhnev&#x27;s death in November 1982, there was speculation that the position of General Secretary would fall to Chernenko, but he was unable to rally enough support for his candidacy within the Party. Ultimately, KGB chief Yuri Andropov, who had been more mindful of Brezhnev&#x27;s failing health, eventually won the position.

== Leader of the Soviet Union ==
Yuri Andropov died on 9 February 1984 at age 69 in Moscow Central Clinical Hospital of kidney failure. Chernenko was then elected to replace Andropov even though the latter stated he wanted Mikhail Gorbachev to succeed him. Additionally, Chernenko was terminally ill himself.

At the time of his ascent to the country&#x27;s top post, Chernenko was primarily viewed as a transitional leader who could give the Politburo&#x27;s &quot;Old Guard&quot; time to choose an acceptable candidate from the next generation of Soviet leadership. In the interim, he was forced to govern the country as part of a triumvirate alongside Defense Minister Dmitriy Ustinov and Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko. This became a growing problem as Chernenko&#x27;s illness led him to miss meetings with increasing frequency. At Andropov&#x27;s funeral, Chernenko could barely read the eulogy.

Chernenko represented a return to the policies of the late Brezhnev era. Nevertheless, he supported a greater role for the labour unions, and reform in education and propaganda. The one major personnel change Chernenko made was the dismissal of the Chief of the General Staff, Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov. Ogarkov was subsequently replaced by Marshal Sergey Akhromeyev.

In foreign policy, he negotiated a trade deal with China. Despite calls for renewed détente, Chernenko did little to prevent the escalation of the Cold War with the United States. For example, in 1984 the Soviet Union prevented a visit to West Germany by East German leader Erich Honecker. However, in late autumn of 1984, the U.S. and the Soviet Union did agree to resume arms control talks in early 1985. In November 1984 Chernenko met with Britain&#x27;s Labour Party leader, Neil Kinnock.

In 1980 the United States led an international boycott of the Summer Olympics held in Moscow in protest at the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The following 1984 Summer Olympics were due to be held in Los Angeles, California. On 8 May 1984, under Chernenko&#x27;s leadership, the USSR announced its intention not to participate in the Games, claiming &quot;security concerns and chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-Soviet hysteria being whipped up in the United States&quot;. The boycott was joined by 14 Eastern Bloc satellites and allies, including Cuba (but not Romania). The action was widely seen as revenge for the U.S.-led boycott of the Moscow Games. The boycotting countries organised their own &quot;Friendship Games&quot; in the summer of 1984.

Before his death, Chernenko signed preliminary documents stating that on 9 May 1985, on the day of the 40th Victory Day Parade, the city of Volgograd would be renamed to Stalingrad. In his letter to Stalin&#x27;s daughter Svetlana Alliluyeva, he wrote about &quot;the upcoming restoration of justice in relation to the memory and heritage of I.V. Stalin&quot;, which presumably referred to Stalin&#x27;s political rehabilitation.

==Health problems, death and legacy==
Chernenko started smoking at the age of nine, and he was always known to be a heavy smoker as an adult. Long before his election as general secretary, he had developed emphysema and right-sided heart failure. In 1983, he had been absent from his duties for three months due to bronchitis, pleurisy and pneumonia. Historian John Lewis Gaddis described him as &quot;an enfeebled geriatric so zombie-like as to be beyond assessing intelligence reports, alarming or not&quot; when he succeeded Andropov in 1984.

In early 1984, Chernenko was hospitalized for over a month but kept working by sending the Politburo notes and letters. During the summer, his doctors sent him to Kislovodsk for the mineral spas, but on the day of his arrival at the resort Chernenko&#x27;s health deteriorated, and he contracted pneumonia. Chernenko did not return to the Kremlin until later in 1984. He awarded Orders to cosmonauts and writers in his office, but was unable to walk through the corridors and was driven in a wheelchair. By the end of 1984, Chernenko could hardly leave the Central Clinical Hospital, a heavily guarded facility in west Moscow, and the Politburo was affixing a facsimile of his signature to all letters, as Chernenko had done with Andropov&#x27;s when he was dying. Chernenko&#x27;s illness was first acknowledged publicly on 22 February 1985 during a televised election rally in Kuibyshev Borough of northeast Moscow, where the General Secretary stood as candidate for the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR, when Politburo member Viktor Grishin revealed that the General Secretary was absent in accordance with doctors&#x27; advice. Two days later, in a televised scene that shocked the nation, Grishin dragged the terminally ill Chernenko from his hospital bed to a ballot box to vote. On 28 February 1985, Chernenko appeared once more on television to receive parliamentary credentials and read out a brief statement on his electoral victory: &quot;the election campaign is over and now it is time to carry out the tasks set for us by the voters and the Communists who have spoken out&quot;.

Emphysema and the associated lung and heart damage worsened significantly for Chernenko in the last three weeks of February 1985. According to the Chief Kremlin doctor, Yevgeny I. Chazov, Chernenko had also developed both chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver. On 10 March at 15:00, Chernenko fell into a coma and died later that evening at 19:20, at age 73. An autopsy revealed the cause of death to be a combination of chronic emphysema, an enlarged and damaged heart, congestive heart failure and liver cirrhosis. A three-day period of mourning across the country was announced. India, Iraq, Syria and Nicaragua all declared three days of mourning; Pakistan declared two days of mourning; East Germany and Czechoslovakia declared one day of mourning.

Chernenko became the third Soviet leader to die in less than three years. Upon being informed in the middle of the night of his death, U.S. President Ronald Reagan is reported to have remarked, &quot;How am I supposed to get anyplace with the Russians if they keep dying on me?&quot;

Chernenko was honored with a state funeral and was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, in one of the twelve individual tombs located between the Lenin Mausoleum and the Kremlin wall. He is the last person to have been interred there.

The impact of Chernenko—or the lack thereof—was evident in the way in which his death was reported in the Soviet press. Soviet newspapers carried stories about Chernenko&#x27;s death and Gorbachev&#x27;s selection on the same day. The papers had the same format: page 1 reported the party Central Committee session on 11 March that elected Mikhail Gorbachev and printed the new leader&#x27;s biography and a large photograph of him; page 2 announced the demise of Chernenko and printed his obituary.

After the death of a Soviet leader it was customary for his successors to open his safe. When Gorbachev had Chernenko&#x27;s safe opened, it was found to contain a small folder of personal papers and several large bundles of money; more money was found in his desk. It is not known where he had obtained the money or what he intended to use it for.

==Personal life==
Chernenko had a son with his first wife, Faina Vassilyevna Chernenko, named Albert. With his second wife, Anna Dmitrevna Lyubimova, who married him in 1944, he had two daughters, Yelena and Vera, and a son, Vladimir. In 2015 archival documents were published, according to which Chernenko had many more wives, and many more children with them; this circumstance, perhaps, was the reason for the slowing of Chernenko&#x27;s career growth in the 1940s.

<text>The Komondor (), also known as the Hungarian sheepdog, is a large, white-coloured Hungarian breed of livestock guardian dog with a long, corded coat.

Sometimes referred to as &#x27;mop dogs&#x27; due to their appearance, the Komondors are a long-established dog breed commonly employed to guard livestock and other property. The Komondor was brought to Europe by the Cumans and the oldest known mention of it is in a Hungarian codex from 1544. The Komondor breed has been declared one of Hungary’s national treasures, to be preserved and protected from modification.

==Etymology and history==
Komondors were brought to Hungary by Cumans, the Turkic speaking, nomadic people who settled in Hungary during the 12th and 13th century. The name Komondor derives from &quot;*Koman-dor&quot;, meaning &quot;Cuman dog&quot;. The breed descends from Tibetan dogs and came from Asia with the Cumans, whose homeland might have been near the Yellow River. In the late 10th century, Mongols began to expand their territories at the expense of the Cumans, forcing them to move westwards. Fleeing from the Mongols, they reached the borders of Hungary in the 12th century. Cumans were granted asylum and settled in Hungary in 1239 under Köten Khan. Komondor remains have been found in Cuman gravesites.

The name &quot;quman-dur&quot; means &quot;belonging to the Cumans&quot; or &quot;the dog of the Cumans&quot;, thus distinguishing it from a similar Hungarian sheepdog breed which later merged with the Komondor. The name Komondor is found for the first time written in 1544 in the &quot;History of King Astiagis&quot; by Péter Kákonyi, in Early Modern Hungarian. Later, in 1673, Amos Comenius mentions the Komondor in one of his works. 
Today, the Komondor is a fairly common breed in Hungary, its country of origin. Many Komondors were killed during World War II and local stories say that this was because when the Germans (and then the Russians) invaded, they had to kill the dog before they could capture a farm or house that it guarded.
The Komondor is related to the South Russian Ovcharka, the Puli and, by extension, the Pumi, the Mudi, the Polish Lowland Sheepdog, the Schapendoes, the Bearded collie, and the Old English sheepdog. In 1947, the Komondor was used to acquire fresh blood in the rare South Russian Ovcharka. In the 1970s, another Komondor cross was made. It is also believed to be related to the Briard, the Catalonian Sheepdog, the Cão da Serra de Aires, the Pyrenean Shepherd and the Bergamasco shepherd, but the Bergamasco has flocks unlike the Komondor.

The two Hungarian breeds of livestock guardian dogs have evolved independently. This is because the Komondor was developed by a group of people who called it the Kuman-dor, the dog of the Cumans, and the Kuvasz was bred by a different people - the Magyars. For much of Hungary&#x27;s early history, these two peoples lived in separate areas in Hungary, spoke different languages and so did not mix. As a result, their dogs have little, if any at all, admixture.

==Description==
The Komondor is a large breed of dogmany are over tall. The body is covered with a heavy, matted, corded coat. They have robust bodies, strongly muscled with long legs and a short back. The tail is carried with a slight curl. The body when seen sideways, forms a prone rectangle. The length of body is slightly longer than the height at withers. The Komondor has a broad head with the muzzle slightly shorter than half of the length of the head with an even and complete scissor bite. Nose and lips are always black.

The minimum height of female Komondors is at the withers, with an average height of . The minimum height of male Komondors is with an average height of . No upper height limit is given. Komondor females on average weigh between and Komondor males weigh on average between .

==Appearance==
The Komondor&#x27;s coat is a long, thick, and strikingly corded white coat, about 20 – 27 cm long (the heaviest amount of fur in the canine world), which resembles dreadlocks or a mop. The puppy coat is soft and fluffy. However, the coat is wavy and tends to curl as the puppy matures. A fully mature coat is formed naturally from the soft undercoat and the coarser outer coat combining to form tassels or cords and will take about two years to form. Some help is needed in separating the cords so the dog does not turn into one large matted mess. The length of the cords increases with time as the coat grows. Moulting is minimal with this breed, contrary to what one might think (once cords are fully formed). The only substantial shedding occurs as a puppy before the dreadlocks fully form. The Komondor is born with only a white coat, unlike the similar-looking Puli, which can be white, black, or sometimes grayish. However, a working Komondor&#x27;s coat may be discolored by the elements and may appear off-white if not washed regularly. Traditionally, the coat protects the Komondor from possible wolves&#x27; bites as the bites would not penetrate the thick coat. The coat of the Komondor takes about two and a half days to dry after a bath.

==Temperament==

The Komondor is built for livestock guarding. Its temperament is like that of most livestock guarding dogs; it is calm and steady when things are normal, but, in case of trouble, the dog will fearlessly defend its charges. It was bred to think and act independently and make decisions on its own.

The Komondor is affectionate with its family, and gentle with the children and friends of the family. Although wary of strangers, they can accept them when it is clear that no harm is imminent, being instinctively very protective of its family, home, and possessions. 

The Komondor is very good with other family pets, often very protective over them, but is intolerant to trespassing animals and is not a good dog for an apartment. The dog is vigilant and will rest in the daytime, keeping an eye on its surroundings, but at night is constantly moving, patrolling the place, moving up and down around its whole territory. The dogs will usually knock down intruders and keep them down until its owner arrives. 

Hungarian Komondor breeders used to say that an intruder may be allowed to enter the property guarded by a Komondor, but he will not be allowed to leave or escape.

==Uses==
The breed has a natural guardian instinct and an inherent ability to guard livestock. An athletic dog, the Komondor is fast and powerful and will leap at a predator to drive it off or knock it down. It can be used successfully to guard sheep against wolves or bears. It is a big, strong dog breed, armored with a thick coat. The coat provides protection against wild animals, weather and vegetation. The coat looks similar to that of a sheep so it can easily blend into a flock and camouflage itself giving it an advantage when predators such as wolves attack. The Komondor is one breed of livestock guardian dog which has seen a vast increase in use as a guardian of sheep and goats in the United States to protect against predators such as coyotes, cougars, bears, and other predators.

==Training==

Due to the Komondor&#x27;s size, power, speed and temperament, a lack of obedience training can result in danger to others. Komondors generally take well to training if started early (ideally between 4–8 months). A Komondor can become obstinate when bored, so it is imperative that training sessions be upbeat and happy. Praise is a must, as are consistent and humane corrections. Once a Komondor gets away with unfriendly or hostile behavior, it will always think such behavior is appropriate. Therefore, consistent corrections even with a young puppy are necessary to ensure a well-adjusted adult. Socialization is also extremely important. The Komondor should be exposed to new situations, people and other dogs while still a puppy. Because it is a natural guard dog, a Komondor that is not properly socialized may react in an excessively aggressive manner when confronted with a new situation or person.

Breed-specific legislation requires some breeds to be muzzled in public places. Romania is the only country that requires Komondors to be muzzled.

== In popular culture == 
The cover of Beck’s 1996 album &quot;Odelay&quot; is a photo of a Komondor jumping over a hurdle, taken by canine photographer Joan Ludwig (1914–2004) for the July 1977 issue of the American Kennel Club&#x27;s &quot;Gazette&quot;.

<text>The Keeshond ( , plur. Keeshonden) is a medium-sized dog with a plush, two-layer coat of silver and black fur with a ruff and a curled tail. Their closest relatives are the German spitzes such as the &quot;Großspitz&quot; (Large Spitz), &quot;Mittelspitz&quot; (Medium Spitz), &quot;Kleinspitz&quot; (Miniature Spitz), &quot;Zwergspitz&quot; (Dwarf-Spitz) or Pomeranian.

The Keeshond was previously known as the Dutch Barge Dog, as it was frequently seen on barges traveling the canals and rivers of the Netherlands. The Keeshond was the symbol of the Patriot faction in the Netherlands during political unrest in the years immediately preceding the French Revolution.

In the late 19th century, the breed was developed in England from imports obtained in both the Netherlands and Germany. In 1930, the Keeshond was first registered with the American Kennel Club.

== Description ==
=== Appearance ===
A member of the spitz group of dogs, the Keeshond in American Kennel Club (AKC) standard is to tall and  ±  in the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) standard and weighs to . Sturdily built, they have a typical spitz appearance. Neither coarse nor refined, they have a wedge-shaped head, medium-length muzzle with a definite stop, small pointed ears, and an expressive face. The tail is tightly curled and, in profile, should be carried such that it is indistinguishable from the compact body of the dog.

==== Coat ====

Like most spitz-type dogs, the Keeshond has a dense double coat, with a thick ruff around the neck. Typically, the males of this breed will have a thicker, more pronounced ruff than the females. The body should be abundantly covered with long, straight, harsh hair standing well out from a thick, downy undercoat. The hair on the legs should be smooth and short, except for a feathering on the front legs and &quot;trousers&quot; on the hind legs. The hair on the tail should be profuse, forming a rich plume. The head, including muzzle, skull, and ears, should be covered with smooth, soft, short hair—velvety in texture on the ears. The coat must not part down the back.

Coat care requires line brushing on a fairly regular basis. The Keeshond typically &#x27;blows&#x27; its undercoat once a year for males, twice a year for females. During this time, the loss of coat is excessive and their guard hairs will lie flat to their back. It usually takes two weeks for the &#x27;blow&#x27; to complete, in order for new undercoat to begin growing back in. A Keeshond should never be shaved, as their undercoat provides a natural barrier against heat and cold. Keeping their coat in good condition will allow efficient insulation in both hot and cold weather.

==== Color ====

The color should be a mixture of grey and black and some white as well. The undercoat should be very pale grey or cream (not tawny). The hair of the outer coat is black tipped, the length of the black tips producing the characteristic shading of color. The color may vary from light to dark, but any pronounced deviation from the grey color is not permissible. The plume of the tail should be very light grey when curled on back and the tip of the tail should be black. Legs and feet should be cream. Ears should be very dark—almost black.

Shoulder line markings (light grey) should be well defined. The color of the ruff and &quot;trousers&quot; is generally lighter than that of the body. &quot;Spectacles&quot; and shadings, as later described, are characteristic of the breed and must be present to some degree. There should be no pronounced white markings.

According to the American Kennel Club breed standard, the legs and feet are to be cream; feet that are totally black or white are severe faults. Black markings more than halfway down the foreleg, except for pencilling, are faulted.

The other important marking is the &quot;spectacles&quot;, a delicate dark line running from the outer corner of each eye toward the lower corner of each ear, which, coupled with markings forming short eyebrows, is necessary for the distinct expressive look of the breed. All markings should be clear, not muddled or broken. Absence of the spectacles is considered a serious fault. The eyes should be dark brown, almond-shaped with black eye rims.

Ears should be small, dark, triangular, and erect.

=== Temperament ===
Keeshonden tend to be very playful, with quick reflexes and strong jumping ability. They are thoughtful, eager to please and very quick learners, which means they are also quick to learn things their humans did not intend to teach them. However, Keeshonden make excellent agility and obedience dogs. In fact, so amenable to proper training is this bright, sturdy dog that they have been successfully trained to serve as guide dogs for the blind; only their lack of size has prevented them from being more widely used in this role.

They love children and are excellent family dogs, preferring to be close to their humans whenever possible. They generally get along with other dogs as well and will enjoy a good chase around the yard. Keeshonden are very intuitive and empathetic and are often used as comfort dogs. Most notably, at least one Keeshond, Tikva, was at Ground Zero following the September 11 attacks to help comfort the rescue workers. The breed has a tendency to become especially clingy towards their owners, more so than most other breeds. If their owner is out, or in another room behind a closed door, they may sit, waiting for their owner to reappear, even if there are other people nearby. Many have been referred to as their &quot;owner&#x27;s shadow&quot;, or &quot;velcro dogs&quot;.

They are known by their loud, distinctive bark. Throughout the centuries, the Keeshond has been very popular as a watch dog on barges on canals in the Netherlands and middle Europe. This trait is evident to this day, and they are alert dogs that warn their owners of any new visitors. Although loud and alert, Keeshonden are not aggressive towards visitors. They generally welcome visitors affectionately once their family has accepted them. Unfortunately, barking may become a problem if not properly handled. Keeshonden that are kept in a yard, and not allowed to be with their humans, are unhappy and often become nuisance barkers. 

The Keeshond is very bright in work and obedience. The Keeshond ranks 18th in Stanley Coren&#x27;s &quot;The Intelligence of Dogs&quot;, being of excellent working/obedience intelligence. This intelligence makes a Keeshond a good choice for the dog owner who is willing to help a dog learn the right lessons, but also entails added responsibility.

== Health ==

Keeshonden are generally a very healthy breed. Though congenital health issues are not common, the conditions which have been known to sometimes occur in Keeshonden are hip dysplasia, luxating patellas (trick knee), epilepsy, Cushing&#x27;s disease, diabetes, primary hyperparathyroidism, and hypothyroidism. Von Willebrand&#x27;s disease has been known in Keeshonden but is very rare. An accurate test for the gene causing primary hyperparathyroidism (or PHPT) has recently been developed at Cornell University. As with any breed, it is important when buying a puppy to make sure that both parents have been tested and certified free from inherited problems. Test results may be obtained from the breeder, and directly from the Orthopaedic Foundation For Animals site.

A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy 12.3 years based on a sample of 55 deaths for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

== History ==

The Keeshond was named after the 18th-century Dutch Patriot, Cornelis (Kees) de Gyselaer (spelled &#x27;Gijzelaar&#x27; in Modern Dutch), leader of the rebellion against the House of Orange. The dog became the rebels&#x27; symbol; and, when the House of Orange returned to power, this breed almost disappeared. The word &#x27;keeshond&#x27; is a compound word: &#x27;Kees&#x27; is a nickname for Cornelius (de Gyselaer), and &#x27;hond&#x27; is the Dutch word for dog. In the Netherlands, &quot;keeshond&quot; is the term for German Spitzes that encompass them all from the toy or dwarf (Pomeranian) to the Wolfspitz (Keeshond). The sole difference among the German Spitzes is their coloring and size guidelines. There are debates over the origin of the breed; many English references point to the Keeshond as we know it originating in the Netherlands. On the other hand, according to the FCI, the breed is cited as being part of the German Spitz family, originating in Germany along with the Pomeranian (toy or dwarf German Spitz) and American Eskimo dog (small or standard German Spitz).

The first standard for &quot;Wolfspitz&quot; was posted at the Dog Show of 1880 in Berlin. The Club for German Spitzes was founded in 1899. The German standard was revised in 1901 to specify the characteristic color that we know today, &quot;silver grey tipped with black&quot;. In the late 19th century the &quot;Overweight Pomeranian&quot;, a white German Spitz and most likely a Standard German Spitz, was shown in the British Kennel Club. The &quot;Overweight Pomeranian&quot; was no longer recognized by the British Kennel Club in 1915. In the 1920s, Baroness van Hardenbroeck took an interest in the breed and began to build it up again. The Nederlandse Keeshond Club was formed in 1924. The Dutch Barge Dog Club of England was formed in 1925 by Mrs. Wingfield-Digby and accepted into the British Kennel Club in 1926, when the breed and the club were renamed to Keeshond.

Carl Hinderer is credited with bringing his Schloss Adelsburg Kennel, which he founded in 1922 in Germany, with him to America in 1923. His German Champion Wolfspitz followed him two by two in 1926. At that time, less than ten years after World War I, Germany was not regarded fondly in England and America; and the Wolfspitz/Keeshond was not recognized by the AKC. Consequently, Hinderer had to register each puppy born in the U.S. with his club in Germany. Despite this, he joined the Maryland KC and attended local shows.

Hinderer regularly wrote to the AKC, including the New York headquarters, to promote the Wolfspitz. While going through New York on his way to Germany in 1930, Hinderer visited the AKC offices and presented &quot;Wachter&quot;, his Germany champion, to AKC President, Dr. DeMond, who promptly agreed to start the recognition process, with some caveats including changing the name to Keeshond, and asked Hinderer to bring back all the relevant data from Germany. Hinderer also translated the German standard to English for the AKC. The Keeshond was accepted for AKC registration in 1930.

Despite intense lobbying the FCI would not accept the Keeshond as a separate breed since it viewed the Wolfspitz and Keeshond as identical. In 1997, the German Spitz Club updated its standard so that the typically smaller Keeshond preferred in America and other English-speaking countries could be included. This greatly expanded the gene pool and unified the standard internationally for the first time. Now bred for many generations as a companion dog, the Keeshond easily becomes a loving family member.

As a result of the breed&#x27;s history and friendly disposition, Keeshonden are sometimes referred to as &quot;The Smiling Dutchman&quot;.

<doc id="17275" wikidata="Q155261" url="?curid=17275" title="Krag–Jørgensen">
<text>The Krag–Jørgensen is a repeating bolt-action rifle designed by the Norwegians Ole Herman Johannes Krag and Erik Jørgensen in the late 19th century. It was adopted as a standard arm by Norway, Denmark, and the United States. About 300 were delivered to Boer forces of the South African Republic.

A distinctive feature of the Krag–Jørgensen action is its magazine. While many other rifles of its era use an integral box magazine loaded by a charger or stripper clip, the magazine of the Krag–Jørgensen is integral with the receiver (the part of the rifle that houses the operating parts), featuring an opening on the right hand side with a hinged cover. Instead of a charger, single cartridges are inserted through the side opening, and are pushed up, around, and into the action by a spring follower. Later, similar to a charger, a claw type clip would be made for the Krag that allowed the magazine to be loaded all at once, also known as the Krag &quot;speedloader magazine&quot;.

The design presents both advantages and disadvantages compared with a top-loading &quot;box&quot; magazine. Normal loading was one cartridge at a time, and this could be done more easily with a Krag than a rifle with a &quot;box&quot; magazine. In fact, several cartridges can be dumped into the opened magazine of a Krag at once with no need for careful placement, and when shutting the magazine-door the cartridges are forced to line up correctly inside the magazine. The design was also easy to &quot;top off&quot;, and unlike most top-loading magazines, the Krag–Jørgensen&#x27;s magazine could be topped up without opening the rifle&#x27;s bolt. The Krag–Jørgensen is a popular rifle among collectors, and is valued by shooters for its smooth action.

== Early development ==

The 1880s were an interesting period in the development of modern firearms. During this decade smokeless powder came into general use, and the calibre of various service rifles diminished as new small-bore, high-velocity cartridges using smokeless propellant were developed. Many nations adopted repeating bolt-action rifles using such cartridges during this decade.

Even though Norway had adopted the repeating Jarmann rifle in 1884, it was soon clear that it was at best an interim weapon. Ole Krag, captain in the Norwegian Army and director of Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk (the government weapons factory), therefore continued the development of small arms, as he had since at least 1866. Not satisfied with the tubular magazine of the Jarmann rifle and his earlier Krag–Petersson rifle (adopted by the Royal Norwegian Navy in 1876), he enlisted the help of master gunsmith Erik Jørgensen. Together they developed the &quot;capsule&quot; magazine. The principal feature of the capsule magazine was that instead of being a straight box protruding below the stock of the rifle, it wrapped around the bolt action. Early models contained ten rounds and were fitted to modified versions of the Jarmann—though they could be adapted to any bolt-action rifle.

In 1886, Denmark was on the verge of adopting a new rifle for its armed forces. One of the early prototypes of the new rifle was sent to Denmark. The feedback given by the Danes was vital in the further development of the weapon. The test performed in Denmark revealed the need to lighten the rifle, as well as the possible benefits of a completely new action. Krag and Jørgensen therefore decided to convert the magazine into what they referred to as a &quot;half-capsule&quot;, containing only five rounds of ammunition instead of the previous ten. They also, over the next several months, combined what they considered the best ideas from other gunsmiths with a number of their own ideas to design a distinct bolt action for their rifle. The long extractor, situated on top of the bolt, was inspired by the Jarmann mechanism, while the use of curved surfaces for cocking and ejecting the spent round was probably inspired by the designs from Mauser. For a time after the weapon was adopted by Denmark they experimented with dual frontal locking lugs, but decided against it on grounds of cost and weight. The ammunition of the day did not need dual frontal locking lugs, and the bolt already had three lugs—one in front, one just in front of the bolt handle, and the bolt handle itself—which were considered more than strong enough.

The rifle had a feature known as a magazine cut-off. This is a switch on the left rear of the receiver. When flipped up (on the Norwegian Krag-J rifles and carbines), the cut-off does not allow cartridges in the internal magazine to be fed into the chamber by the advancing bolt. This was intended to be used for when soldiers were comfortably firing at distant targets. After each shot, the soldier would take a round out of his pouch and load it directly into the chamber as if he was using single-shot rifle. The rounds in the magazine are thus held in reserve. If the enemy suddenly charged or the soldier was ordered to charge, the soldier could then retract the cut-off for up to five rounds of rapid shooting. The M1903 Springfield that replaced the Krags had a magazine cutoff, as did the SMLE (Lee–Enfield) until 1915.

== Danish Krag–Jørgensen rifles ==

After strenuous tests, Denmark adopted the Krag–Jørgensen rifle on July 3, 1889. The Danish rifle differed in several key areas from the weapons later adopted by the United States and Norway, particularly in its use of a forward (as opposed to downward) hinged magazine door, the use of rimmed ammunition, and the use of an outer steel liner for the barrel.

The Danish Krag–Jørgensen was chambered for the 8×58R cartridge (0.31 in / 7.87 mm), and was at least in the early years used as a single shooter with the magazine in reserve. It stayed in service right up to the German invasion of Denmark on April 9, 1940. Danish Krags were given the German identification code &quot;Scharfschützen-Gewehr 312(d)&quot;.

=== Subtypes of the Danish Krag–Jørgensen ===
While information on the various subtypes of the Krag–Jørgensen used in Denmark has proven difficult to find, at least the following subtypes were manufactured:

* &quot;Rifle M/89&quot; (&quot;Gevær M/89&quot;), stocked almost to the muzzle, no hand guard, straight bolt handle and an outer steel liner for the barrel. This weapon is typical of the period in having a long barrel and stock without pistol grip. Was originally issued without a safety catch; instead, a half-cock notch on the cocking piece/firing pin assembly served this purpose. In 1910, this weapon was modified by the addition of a manual safety, which was placed on the right side of the receiver just behind the closed bolt handle.
* &quot;Cavalry carbine M/89&quot; (&quot;Rytterkarabin M/89&quot;) and &quot;engineer carbine M/89&quot; (&quot;Ingeniørkarabin M/89&quot;), wooden hand guard, shorter than the other carbines. The two designs differed only in placement of the barrel bands and the cavalry carbine&#x27;s lack of a bayonet lug. The &quot;cavalry carbine M/89-23&quot; (&quot;Rytterkarabin M/89-23&quot;) design added a bayonet lug.
* &quot;Artillery carbine M/89-24&quot; (&quot;Artillerikarabin M/89&quot;) and &quot;infantry carbine M/89-24&quot; (&quot;Fodfolkskarabin M/89-24&quot;), differed only in placement of the sling-swivel, and look like short versions of the rifle M/89.
* &quot;Sniper rifle M/89-28&quot; (&quot;Finskydningsgevær M/89-28&quot;), an alteration of the rifle M/89 with a heavier barrel and a wooden hand guard, micrometer rear sight and hooded front sight.

== American Krag–Jørgensen rifles ==
Like many other armed forces, the United States Military was searching for a new rifle in the early 1890s. A competition was held in 1892, comparing 53 rifle designs including Lee, Krag, Mannlicher, Mauser, and Schmidt–Rubin. The trials were held at Governors Island, New York, and the finalists were all foreign manufacturers—the Krag, the Lee, and the Mauser. The contract was awarded to the Krag design in August 1892, with initial production deferred as the result of protests from domestic inventors and arms manufacturers. Two rifle designers, Russell and Livermore, even sued the US government over the initial selection of the Krag, forcing a review of the testing results in April and May 1893. In spite of this, an improved form of the Krag–Jørgensen was again selected, and was awarded the contract. The primary reason for the selection of the Krag appears to have been its magazine design, which could be topped off as needed without raising and retracting the bolt (thus putting the rifle temporarily out of action). Ordnance officials also believed the Krag&#x27;s magazine cutoff and lower reloading speed to be an advantage, one which conserved ammunition on the battlefield. This magazine design would later resurface as a distinct disadvantage once U.S. soldiers encountered Spanish troops armed with the charger-loaded 1893 7mm Spanish Mauser in the Spanish–American War.

Around 500,000 &quot;Krags&quot; in .30 Army (.30-40) calibre were produced at the Springfield Armory in Massachusetts from 1894 to 1904. The Krag–Jørgensen rifle in .30 Army found use in the Boxer Rebellion, the Spanish–American War, and the Philippine–American War. A few carbines were used by United States cavalry units fighting Apaches in New Mexico Territory and preventing poaching in Yellowstone National Park. Two-thousand rifles were taken to France by the United States Army 10th–19th engineers (railway) during World War I; but there is no evidence of use by front-line combat units during that conflict.

The US &#x27;Krags&#x27; were chambered for the rimmed &quot;cartridge, caliber 30, U.S. Army&quot;, round, also known as the .30 U.S., .30 Army, or .30 Government, and, more popularly, by its civilian name, the .30-40 Krag. The .30 Army was the first smokeless powder round adopted by the U.S. military, but its civilian name retained the &quot;caliber-charge&quot; designation of earlier black powder cartridges. Thus the .30-40 Krag employs a round-nose 220-grain (14 g) cupro-nickel jacketed .30 caliber (7.62 mm) bullet propelled by 40 grains (3 g) of smokeless powder to a muzzle velocity of approximately 2000 feet (600 m) per second. As with the .30-30 Winchester, it is the use of black powder nomenclature that leads to the incorrect assumption that the .30-40 Krag was once a black powder cartridge.

In U.S. service, the Krag eventually proved uncompetitive with Mauser-derived designs, most notably in combat operations in Cuba and the Philippines during the Spanish–American War. It served as the U.S. military&#x27;s primary rifle for only 12 years, when it was replaced by the M1903 Springfield rifle in 1906 and many units did not receive it until 1908 and later. Surplused Krags were given to the US Navy where they remained in second line service (to arm shore parties, boarding parties, and the like or stored in crates in the holds of older ships) well into the 1930s. US Marines were still using Krags in Nicaragua in the late 1920s.

=== Subtypes of the Krag–Jørgensen used in the United States ===
There were at least nine different models of the American Krag–Jørgensen:

* &quot;M1892 rifle&quot;, is in overall length weighing 9.3 pounds with a 30-inch (760 mm) barrel and a magazine cut off that operates in the up position. It can be identified by the cleaning rod under the barrel. Because it took two years to retool for production, Model 1892 Krags have receivers dated &quot;1894.&quot; Most of the M1892 rifles were arsenal reconditioned to the Model 1896 configuration.
* &quot;M1892 carbine&quot;, presumably a prototype, as just two are known today. Looks like the M1892 rifle, but with a 22-inch barrel, including the long stock, and one-piece cleaning rod.
*&quot;M1896 rifle&quot;, where the magazine cut-off operates in down position and a three-piece cleaning rod is stored in a butt trap. An improved rear sight and tighter production tolerances gave better accuracy. Stock altered slightly (made thicker). This model figures prominently in the first part of Andrew Krivak&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Sojourn&quot;.
* &quot;M1896 cadet rifle&quot;, which was fitted with cleaning rod like M1892 rifle. Only about 400 were made before it was discontinued. The cadet rifle did not have sling swivels, and the lower band was retained by a band spring.
* &quot;M1896 carbine&quot;, with the same modifications as the M1896 rifle.
* &quot;M1898 rifle&quot;, generally much like M1896, but with a wide range of minor changes, including reconfiguring the bolt handle recess to simplify receiver manufacture, reversing the operation of the magazine cut-off lever, and (beginning in 1901) providing windage adjustment on the rear sight.
* &quot;M1898 carbine&quot;, same minor modifications as the M1898 Rifle. Only 5000 made, originally had the same short stock (rear sight touches band) as the Model 1896 carbine; most were restocked as Model 1899s.
* &quot;M1899 carbine&quot;, generally the same as the M1898 carbine, but with a slightly longer forearm and hand guard, and without the swivel ring. Most of the M1898 carbines were arsenal reconditioned to the Model 1899 configuration and fitted with windage-adjustable rear sights.
* &quot;M1899 constabulary carbine&quot;, built for use in the Philippines. Basically a M1899 carbine fitted with a full-length stock and a bayonet lug, and the muzzle stepped down to accept bayonet.

A few prototype Model 1898 sniper rifles were assembled with Cataract telescopic sights for limited testing. In 1901, 100 Model 1898 rifles, and 100 Model 1899 carbines were fitted with a Parkhurst clip loading attachment to test use of Mauser-type stripper clips. In 1902, 100 rifles were made with barrels in an effort to develop one model acceptable to both infantry and cavalry. The so-called &quot;NRA carbines&quot; were rifles cut down to carbine length for sale to members of the National Rifle Association of America beginning in 1926 as a means of keeping skilled armoury workmen employed at Benicia Arsenal.

===In the Caribbean and Latin America===
In the early 20th century, the United States also distributed the Krag to some Caribbean countries in which US forces intervened. These included Haiti, where they equipped the Gendarmerie d&#x27;Haïti (newly founded in 1915) with surplus Krags. A 1919 letter to the Marine Commandant from the First Provisional Brigade in Port-au-Prince noted: &quot;&quot;...[A]bout 2,000 bandits infest the hills... I don&#x27;t believe that in all Haiti there are more than 400 to 500 rifles, if that many. They are very short of ammunition.. They use our ammunition and the Krag by tying a piece of goatskin on string around the base of the cartridge.&quot;

The 1916-1924 American occupation of the Dominican Republic resulted in a small flow of Krags to that country. The Guardia Nacional Dominicana issued the received Krag rifles, though the rifles broke down quickly when issued to unfamiliar Dominican troops, and spare parts were hard to obtain. The discovery of Krag bullets in victims&#x27; bodies in the 1937 Parsley massacre was taken by US observers as evidence of the government&#x27;s involvement in the killings. At the start of World War II, the Dominican government had 1,860 Krags on-hand, supplementing their over 2,000 Spanish Mausers.

In Nicaragua, to support the government of Adolfo Díaz, the American government provided Krags to the newly formed Guardia Nacional in 1925. In 1961, Cuban militias were still fielding some Krag-Jørgensons during the Bay of Pigs invasion.

===In Africa===
In 1919, the United States provided discounted arms sales to the Liberians, giving them a number of Springfield Krag rifles, in addition to Peabody and Mauser rifles.

== Norwegian Krag–Jørgensen rifles ==
The Swedish-Norwegian Rifle Commission started its work in 1891. One of their first tasks was to find the best possible calibre for the new weapon. After extensive ballistic tests where different calibres were tested (8 mm, 7.5 mm, 7 mm, 6.5 mm etc.), the optimal caliber was determined to be 6.5 mm (0.256 in). Following this decision, a joint Norwegian-Swedish commission was established in December 1893. This commission worked through a series of meetings to decide on the different measurements for the cartridge case. A rimless cartridge case of 55 mm length was approved, and each possible measurement (diameter at base, diameter at neck, angle of case, angle of shoulder etc.) was decided upon. The corresponding dimensions of the cartridge chamber to be used in a future service rifle was also determined. The cartridge became what is later known as 6.5×55mm. The round of ammunition is also known as 6.5×55 Krag, 6.5×55 Scan (Scandinavia), 6.5×55 Mauser, 6.5×55 Swedish, and 6.5×55 Nor (Norwegian), but they all referred to the same cartridge.

Some historians have assumed that there was a difference in cartridge blueprint measurements between Swedish and Norwegian 6.5×55mm ammunition, but this may be unintentional. Due to different interpretations of the blueprint standard, i.e. the standards of manufacturing using maximum chamber in the Krag vs. minimum chamber in the Swedish Mauser, a small percentage of the ammunition produced in Norway proved to be slightly oversize when chambered in the Swedish Mauser action, i.e. requiring a push on the bolt handle to chamber in the Swedish arm. A rumour arose not long after the 6.5×55mm cartridge was adopted that one could use Swedish ammunition in Norwegian rifles, but not Norwegian ammunition in Swedish rifles. Some even alleged that this incompatibility was deliberate, to give Norway the tactical advantage of using captured ammunition in a war, while denying the same advantage to the Swedes. However, after the rumour first surfaced in 1900, the issue was examined by the Swedish military. They declared the difference to be insignificant, and that both the Swedish and Norwegian ammunition was within the specified parameters laid down. Despite this finding, the Swedish weapon-historian Josef Alm repeated the rumour in a book in the 1930s, leading many to believe that there was a significant difference between the ammunition manufactured in Norway and Sweden. It is worth noting that Sweden would later adopt a 6.5×55mm rifle with a much stronger Mauser bolt action, the m/94 carbine in 1894 and the m/96 rifle in 1896, both of which were proof-tested with loads generating significantly more pressure than those used to proof the Norwegian Krag action.

Once the question of ammunition was settled, the Norwegians started looking at a modern arm to fire their newly designed cartridge. The processing was modelled on the US Army Ordnance selection process and considered, among other things, sharp-shooting at different ranges, shooting with defective or dirty ammunition, rapidity of shooting, conservation of ammunition, corrosion resistance, and ease of assembly and disassembly. After the test, three rifles were shortlisted:

* Mannlicher 1892
* Mauser 1892
* Krag–Jørgensen 1892

About fifty Krag–Jørgensen rifles were produced in 1893 and issued to soldiers for field testing. The reports were good, and a few modifications were later incorporated into the design. For example, to prevent double feed manlfunctions, the extractor was redesigned to replace push feed with controlled feed, and sear leaf spring was replaced by a coil spring.

Despite the fact that both the Mannlicher and Mauser submissions were significantly faster to reload than the Krag, the latter, having been designed in Norway, was selected. As in the United States, rapidity of fire was deemed to be of lesser importance in an era when current military philosophy still emphasized precise aimed fire and conservation of ammunition. Instead, the magazine was looked upon as a reserve, to be used only when authorized by a commanding officer. The Krag–Jørgensen was formally adopted as the new rifle for the Norwegian Army on April 21, 1894.

A total of more than 215,000 Krag–Jørgensen rifles and carbines were built at the Kongsberg Arms Factory in Norway. 33,500 additional M/1894 rifles were produced at Steyr (Österreichische Waffenfabrik Gesellschaft) in 1896–1897 under contracts for the Norwegian Army (29,000 rifles) and the Civilian Marksmanship Organisation (4,500 rifles). The various subtypes of Krag–Jørgensen replaced all rifles and carbines previously used by the Norwegian armed forces, notably the Jarmann M1884, the Krag–Petersson and the last of the remaining Remington M1867 and modified kammerladers rimfire rifles and carbines.

=== Norwegian-style Krag rifles in Boer service ===
A number of 1896 and 1897 Steyr-manufactured Krag rifles resembling the M1894 Norwegian and chambered in 6.5×55, but lacking some Norwegian inspection markings and having serial numbers outside the sequences of those produced for Norway, were in Boer hands during the Second Boer War (1899–1902), most have serial numbers below 900. Markings show these rifles were manufactured by Steyr concurrently with a large order of M1894 rifles made for Norway. Some parts of rejected Norwegian rifles may have been used in these weapons—many small parts have serial numbers that do not match receiver numbers, these mismatched small parts sometimes have numbers in ranges of rifles made for Norway, yet appear original to the rifle. Photographs of high-ranking Boer officers holding M1894-like rifles exist. Cartridge casings in 6.5×55 have been found on the Magersfontein battlefield and may have been fired by such M1894-like rifles. Some sources state that about 100 1896-date and at least about 200 1897-date rifles reached the Boers. Some rifles meeting this description exist in South African museums with Boer-war documentation, and in England documented as captured bring-backs. A few rifles having Norwegian inspector stamps and serial numbers in the civilian marksmanship organization serial number range are also known to be in South African museums and may have been used by Boer forces—it is suspected that these may have arrived in South Africa with a small Scandinavian volunteer force that fought for the Boers. A small number of Steyr 1897 M1894-like 6.5×55 rifles with 3-digit serial numbers outside the Norwegian contract ranges and in the same range as these Boer Krags, and lacking Norwegian inspection stamps like the low-numbered 1897 rifles in South African museums, are known to exist in the US—it is not known if these have Boer connections or were initially delivered elsewhere.

=== Subtypes of the Krag–Jørgensen used in Norway ===



The Krag–Jørgensen was produced in Norway for a very long time, and in a number of different variations. The major military models are the following:

* The &quot;M1894 rifle&quot;, &quot;long Krag&quot;, was the most common Krag in Norway. A total of about 122,817 were produced for the Norwegian Army at Kongsberg until 1922 when production ended. An additional 29,000 were bought from Steyr weapons factory in Austria 1896–1897. In 1910, after some initial tests, 1,000 of the M1894s (serials 89602 to 90601) were fitted with telescopic sights on a specially constructed bracket. Issued five to each company, they were meant to be used against enemy officers and other high-value targets. Since the model was considered to be less than satisfactory, further production was stopped. 3396 M/1894 rifles were produced in a special serial range for the Norwegian Navy. For the civilian market in Norway (competition shooters and hunters), afbout 33,600 M/1894 rifles in a special serial range were made from 1895 to 1940. An additional 4500 M/1894 rifles were procured from Steyr in a special series for the civilian marksmanship organization in 1897 (serials 3001–7500). All in all, the M/1894 is by far the most common model of the Norwegian Krag models.
* The &quot;M1895 cavalry carbine&quot; and &quot;M1897 mountain artillery&quot; and &quot;engineer carbine&quot; differed only in how the sling swivel was fitted to the stock, and were issued in one series. A total of 9,309 were made between 1898 and 1906.
* The &quot;M1904 engineer carbine&quot; and &quot;M1907 field artillery carbine&quot; differed from the earlier carbines mainly by being stocked to the muzzle. The difference between the two models was only in the attachment of the sling, and again they were issued as one series. A total of 2,750 M/1904 and 750 M/1907 were produced between 1906 and 1908.
* The &quot;M1906 Guttekarabin&quot; (boy&#x27;s carbine) was a simplified M1895 carbine, with a shortened stock and no hand guard. They were issued to schools in Norway, and used to train boys aged 14 to 17 to shoot. Special &quot;school ammunition&quot; was developed to allow shooting in restricted areas. A total of 3,321 were made, of which some 315 were later modified to fire .22 Long Rifle ammunition. Shooting was on the syllabus for Norwegian teens until World War II.
* The &quot;M1912 carbine&quot; / &quot;M1912/16 carbine&quot; / &quot;M1912/18 carbine&quot;, &quot;short rifle&quot;, was made after it became clear that the long barreled M1894 left something to be desired. The M1912 was adopted after experiments with shorter, thicker barrels and different projectiles. It differed from the earlier models by being stocked all the way to the muzzle; the bracket for the bayonet was moved from the barrel to under the stock. The M1912 carbine also featured an improved (strengthened) action which differed from the M/94 action on several points. It was soon clear that the nose band was too weak, which led to the /16 and /18 modifications of the basic design. A total of 30,118 were produced in the military serial number range between 1913 and 1926. It was also decided that any further production would be of this model. About 1592 M1912 were produced in a special serial number range for sale to civilians.
* The &quot;M1923 sniper rifle&quot; was the first attempt to produce a sniper rifle, but it was not solid enough for use in the field. A total of 630 were built between 1923 and 1926, about half of which were sold to civilian sharpshooters. Most were later converted to M1930 or hunting rifles.
* The &quot;M1925 sniper rifle&quot; was an improved version of the M1923 built for the civilian market. A total of 1,900 were made from 1925 to the German invasion on April 9, 1940. A further 250 were built for the Germans during the war, and the last 124 were put together in 1950.
* The &quot;M1930 sniper rifle&quot; was another improvement of the M1923 and M1925, featuring a heavier barrel, a different stock, sights, and a fine tuned trigger. It was a successful weapon, but no more than 466 were built between 1930 and 1939. In 1950 and 1951, an additional 404 M/30 rifles were produced, then with laminated stocks, improved rear (diopter) sights and M/12 actions as the basis. The pre-war M/30 rifles used the M/94 action as the basis.
In addition, most models were produced for the civilian market as well. After World War II a limited number of Krag–Jørgensens were made in purely civilian models.

=== Bayonets for Norwegian Krag–Jørgensen ===
The Swedish-Norwegian Rifle Commission only briefly looked into bayonets, focusing on selecting the best possible rifle. However, their report mentions that they have experimented with knife bayonets and spike bayonets, both in loose forms and in folding forms. Very few of the experimental bayonets are known today.

The bayonet that was finally approved, probably alongside the rifle itself, was a knife bayonet. Later on, longer bayonets were approved as well, and renewed experiments with spike bayonets took place during the development of the M/1912.

* &quot;Bayonet M/1894&quot; was a knife bayonet, with a blade length of 21.5 cm, a blade width of 1.9 cm and a total length of 33.5 cm. The scabbard was made of steel, hanging from a leather strap, and was 22.7 cm long. A total of 101750 was manufactured by Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk, Husqvarna and Steyr.
* &quot;Bayonet M/1912&quot; was constructed during the development of the &quot;short rifle&quot; that became the M1912 carbine. It was significantly longer than the M/1894, to maintain the &quot;reach&quot; of the soldier. The total length of the bayonet was 48.5 cm, of which 38.5 cm was blade. The very long blade proved to be too weak for actual use (it had &quot;double fullers&quot; on each side of the blade), and the Bayonet M/1913 was adopted instead. Most likely less than 50 M/1912 bayonets were produced.
* &quot;Bayonet M/1913&quot; was stronger, but heavier (only one &quot;fuller&quot; on each side), than the M/1912 but was of identical size. However, it soon became clear that the short rifles were too weak in the stock to be used with the very long bayonets, which led to the development of the strengthened M1912/16 and M1912/18 carbines. Production of the M/1913 bayonet was ended in favour of the M/1916 after about 3000 M/1913 bayonets had been manufactured by Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk. The M/1913 bayonets were issued with a leather scabbard.
* &quot;Bayonet M/1916&quot; was meant to be used on both the short carbines and the long rifles. Of almost identical size to the previous M/1913, it was stronger and had a sharpened edge along both sides of the blade&#x27;s point. The scabbards to the M/1916 were initially made of leather (for M/1912 carbine serials 12159–12178, 13179-16678 og 21479–21678), but were later changed to steel (for M/1912 carbine serials 21679–30118 and M/1894 rifle serials 121000–152000).
* &quot;Bayonet M/1894/1943&quot; was a variation of the bayonet M/1894 manufactured during the war for delivery to Nazi Germany. Only 3,300 were manufactured, all of them lower quality than the bayonets delivered before the German invasion.

A number of special bayonets and oddities were experimented with during the time the Krag–Jørgensen was a Norwegian service rifle, two of which are mentioned here.

* The &quot;officers bayonet&quot; was an attempt to replace the traditional side arm for officers in dress uniform with a high quality, decorated M/1916. The prototype was made in 1928, with two different scabbards (one in black lacquered steel, the other in brown leather), polished blade and the coat of arms inlaid in the handle. The bayonet was never issued, and the prototype is lost.
* The &quot;bayonet lengthener&quot;&#x27; was a special scabbard for the M/1894 with a bayonet mount added. By mounting the bayonet to the scabard, and the scabbard to the rifle, a total length of 47 cm was achieved. It is speculated that the reason was to achieve the same reach as with the M/1916 without having to scrap the huge quantities of M/1894 in storage. The &quot;lengthener&quot; was never issued.

== Production for Nazi Germany during World War II ==
During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, the German forces demanded that Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk build weapons for the German armed forces. They placed large orders for the Krag–Jørgensen, the Colt M1914 (license-produced Colt M1911), and 40 mm anti-aircraft guns. However, production was kept down by sabotage and slow work by the employees. Out of the total of 13,450 rifles ordered by the Germans, only between 3,350 and 3,800 were actually delivered. Early deliveries were identical to the M1894, but with German proof marks and substandard workmanship compared to M1894 produced earlier. During the war the model was altered to be externally more like the German Kar98K. This was achieved by shortening the barrel by 15 cm (6 inches) down to 61.3 cm (24 inches) and shortening the stock by 18 cm (7 inches), and adding a front sight hood similar to that of the Kar98K. These shortened Krag–Jørgensen&#x27;s were known in Norway as the &quot;Stomperud-Krag&quot;, nicknamed after the main character from Norwegian comedy comic strip . A number of the Krag–Jørgensens manufactured for the Germans have been described as &quot;bastards&quot;, created from mismatched parts left over from previous production.

Experiments with using the German standard issue 7.92×57mm ammunition, a cartridge as powerful as the .30-06 and the modern 7.62 mm NATO, also took place.

While information on the Wehrmacht&#x27;s use of the Krag–Jørgensen is hard to find, it is assumed that it was issued primarily to second line units since the Wehrmacht attempted to only issue firearms in standard calibres to front line troops. It was also issued to the Hird—the armed part of Nasjonal Samling (NS) (&quot;National Unity&quot;), the national-socialist party of Vidkun Quisling&#x27;s puppet government. It is further likely that the experiments with 7.92 mm ammunition means that the Germans considered a wider use of the Krag–Jørgensen.

== Post-war production ==
A few Krag–Jørgensen rifles were put together after 1945, for sale to civilian hunters and sharpshooters, among them 1600 of the so-called &quot;Stomperud Krag&quot;. While there were at no point any plans for re-equipping the Norwegian Army with the Krag–Jørgensen, attempts were made to adapt it to firing more modern, high-powered ammunition like the .30-06 and 7.62mm NATO rounds. While this was found to be possible, it required a new barrel (or relined barrels) and modification to the bolt and receiver. The resulting cost of the conversion was about the same as that of a new gun of a more modern design. The last Krag–Jørgensen rifles in production were the M/1948 Elgrifle (moose rifle), of which 500 were made in 1948–49 and the M/1951 Elgrifle (moose rifle), of which 1000 were made in 1950–51.

=== As a civilian target rifle ===
Before the Sauer 200 STR was approved as the new standard Scandinavian target rifle, rebarreled and re-stocked Krag–Jørgensen rifles were the standard Norwegian target rifle together with the Kongsberg-Mauser M59 and M67. The Krag was preferred for shooting on covered ranges and in fair weather, and dominated on the speed-shooting exercises due to its smooth action, and very fast loading with a spring speedloader, however it was known to change its point of impact under wet conditions due to the single front locking lug. Thus, many shooters had both a Krag and a &quot;Mauser&quot; for varying conditions.

== Special Krag–Jørgensen rifles / carbines and oddities ==
The Krag–Jørgensen was manufactured for almost 60 years in Norway. During this time several special models and prototypes were designed and manufactured. Some of these special weapons were meant as an aid in production or to meet a specific demand, but there were also various attempts to increase the firepower of the weapon.

=== Model rifles ===
The so-called &quot;model rifles&quot; were used both when the various sub types were approved and as a guide for manufacturing. Basically, the model rifle or model carbine was a specially manufactured weapon that showed how the approved weapon should be. They were numbered and stored separately. Several model rifles and carbines were manufactured for things like a change in surface treatment or other seemingly minor things. There were especially many model rifles made for the M1894, since several were sent to Steyr in Austria to work as controls and models.

=== Harpoon rifles ===
A small number of Krag–Jørgensen rifles were converted into harpoon guns, in the same fashion as Jarmann M1884s were converted to Jarmann harpoon rifles. It was realized that converting the Jarmann was more cost efficient than converting the Krag–Jørgensen, so further conversions was halted. It is not known how many were converted in this way.

=== Modified for belt feed ===
The factory museum at Kongsberg Weapon Factory preserved a prototype of an M1894 modified for belt feed. Although no documentation has been uncovered, it&#x27;s clear that the rifle has been modified at an early stage in the manufacturing process to use the same feed belts that were used on the Hotchkiss heavy machine gun in use in the Norwegian Army at the time.

The backward and forward movement of the bolt operates a mechanism that moves the belt through the receiver, presenting fresh rounds for the weapon. While this may have been advantageous while fighting from fixed fortifications, it cannot have been very practical for the user of the rifle to carry a long feed belt with him in the field. Even so, it is an interesting and early attempt to increase the firepower of the Krag–Jørgensen.

=== Lieutenant Tobiensen&#x27;s &quot;speed loader&quot; ===

In 1923 Lieutenant Tobiesen, working at Kongsberg Weapon Factory, designed what he called a &quot;speed loader for repeating rifles&quot;. It can be seen as a new attempt to increase the firepower of the Krag–Jørgensen, just as the attempt to convert it to belt feed. The design consisted of a modified cover that let the user of the rifle attach a magazine from the Madsen light machine gun. The cover had a selector switch, allowing the user to select if he wanted to use the Krag–Jørgensen&#x27;s internal magazine with its 5 rounds of ammunition, or if he wanted to use the external magazine with 25 rounds.

The design was considered promising enough that eight prototypes were manufactured and tested. However, in testing it was revealed that the heavy magazine mounted on the side of the weapon not only made the rifle more cumbersome to carry and use, but also made it twist sideways. It was decided that the &quot;speed loader&quot; was not a practical design for military use and no further manufacture took place.

In 1926, a group of seal hunters approached Kongsberg Weapon Factory and asked to purchase a number of speedloaders for use when hunting seals from small boats. They were turned down due to the high cost of manufacturing a limited number of the devices.

=== Modified to self loaders ===
At the same time that the Hotchkiss heavy machine gun was introduced to the Norwegian Army, some people started considering modifying the Krag–Jørgensen to semi-automatic fire. Doing so would have multiplied the firepower of the infantry, allowing more weight of fire to be brought at a target. Most of the designs put forward were not very well thought out and few of the designers knew enough about firearms to be able to calculate the pressures and dimensions necessary. However, two designs were investigated further, and eventually one prototype was built.

==== Sunngaard&#x27;s automatic rifle ====
In 1915 Sergeant Sunngaard proposed a design for making the Krag–Jørgensen into a selfloading rifle. The design was considered over a period of time before it was declared to be &#x27;quite without value&#x27;, primarily because the requisite pressure would not be attainable without major redesign of the rifle. For this reason, no prototype was made.

==== Self-loading device SNABB 38 ====
In 1938 a Swedish design called the SNABB was considered. This was a modification that could be made to virtually any bolt-action rifle allowing it to be converted into a self-loading weapon, therefore presenting a chance to cut costs as compared to manufacturing new weapons. The device used gas pressure to operate the bolt handle with the help of a runner. The modification was deemed by some to be unnecessarily complicated. A separate pistolgrip was needed, and the receiver needed major modifications.

A prototype was manufactured in the autumn of 1938 and tested for several months. While moderately successful, the modification would cost about three times as much as originally thought, and the project was dropped due to lack of funds.

== Ammunition ==
The various Krag–Jørgensens were manufactured for a wide variety of ammunition. Apart from various civilian calibres, the rifle was manufactured for the following service ammunition:

* US 30–40, a 7.62 mm (0.30 in) rimmed round loaded with 40 grains (3 grams) of smokeless powder. It gave a chamber pressure of 40000 lbf/in² (276 MPa), which resulted in a muzzle velocity of 609.6 m/s (2000 ft/s) in the rifles, and 597.4 m/s (1960 ft/s) from the shorter barrel of the carbines.
* 6.5×55mm, a 6.5 mm (0.256 in) rimless round. Most variations are loaded for a chamber pressure of 350 MPa (roughly 51000 lbf/in²). Early rounds, with a 10.1 grams (156 grains) long round nosed bullet (B-projectile) had a muzzle velocity of around 700 m/s (roughly 2300 ft/s), while later rounds with a 9 grams (139 grains) spitzer bullet (D-projectile) offered a muzzle velocity up to 780 m/s (2559 ft/s).
* Danish 8×58mmR, a 7.87 mm (0.31 in) rimmed round. Early rounds had a 15.3 grams (236 grains) long round nosed bullet, and was loaded so that it produced a muzzle velocity of about 580 m/s (roughly 1900 ft/s), while later rounds had a 12.8 grams (198 grains) spitzer bullet and gave a muzzle velocity of 823 m/s (2740 ft/s).

Contrary to some rumors, the Krag–Jørgensen action can be modified to fire modern, high-power cartridges. During World War II, and also in the early 1950s, several were produced in 7.92×57mm, which can hardly be considered a low-power cartridge. A number of Krag–Jørgensens have also been converted to .30-06 and 7.62×51mm NATO for target shooting and hunting. However, it must be stressed that these were all late-production Norwegian Krag–Jørgensen rifles, made in an era when metallurgy was vastly more advanced than when the American Krag–Jørgensen rifles were made. Krag–Jørgensen rifles also only have a single locking lug.

Nonetheless, older rifles may benefit from milder loads. Modern European 6.5×55mm rounds are sometimes loaded to a CIP maximum of 55000 PSI, but 6.5×55mm rounds marked &quot;safe for the Krag&quot; are loaded to a milder 40600 PSI. SAAMI specifications call for maximum average pressure of 46000 PSI, sufficient for with a 160 grain bullet.

== Comparison of service rifles ==
What follows is a comparison between the Danish, American and Norwegian service weapons.

== Comparison with contemporary rifles ==

At the time of adoption in Denmark, the United States and Norway, the Krag–Jørgensen was seen as the best available rifle. Here it is compared with rifles of later decades. In the U.S. trials, the Krag competed against the Mauser Model 92 (as well as many other designs), not the improved Model 98. The Japanese Type 38 was adopted starting 1905, nearly two decades after the first Krag design.

<doc id="17276" wikidata="Q82613" url="?curid=17276" title="Krakatoa">
<text>Krakatoa (), also transcribed (), is a caldera in the Sunda Strait between the islands of Java and Sumatra in the Indonesian province of Lampung. The caldera is part of a volcanic island group (Krakatoa archipelago) comprising four islands. Two of them are known as Lang and Verlaten; another, Rakata, is the only remnant of an island mostly destroyed by an eruption in 1883 which created the caldera.

In 1927, a fourth island, Anak Krakatoa, or &quot;Child of Krakatoa&quot;, emerged from the caldera formed in 1883. There has been new eruptive activity since the late 20th century, with a large collapse causing a deadly tsunami in December 2018.

== Historical significance ==
The most notable eruptions of Krakatoa culminated in a series of massive explosions over 26–27 August 1883, which were among the most violent volcanic events in recorded history.

With an estimated Volcanic explosivity index (VEI) of 6, the eruption was equivalent to —about 13,000 times the nuclear yield of the Little Boy bomb (13 to 16 kt) that devastated Hiroshima, Japan, during World War II, and four times the yield of Tsar Bomba, the most powerful nuclear device ever detonated at 50 Mt.

The 1883 eruption ejected approximately of rock. The cataclysmic explosion was heard away in Alice Springs, Australia, and on the island of Rodrigues near Mauritius, to the west.

According to the official records of the Dutch East Indies colony, 165 villages and towns were destroyed near Krakatoa, and 132 were seriously damaged. At least 36,417 people died, and many more thousands were injured, mostly from the tsunamis that followed the explosion. The eruption destroyed two-thirds of the island of Krakatoa.

Eruptions in the area since 1927 have built a new island at the same location, named &quot;Anak Krakatau&quot; (which is Indonesian for &quot;Child of Krakatoa&quot;). Periodic eruptions have continued since, with recent eruptions in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, and a major collapse in 2018. In late 2011, this island had a radius of roughly , and a highest point of about above sea level, growing each year.
In 2017, the height of Anak Krakatau was reported as over above sea level; following a collapse in December 2018, the height was reduced to 110 meters (361 ft).

== Etymology ==
One of the earliest mentions of the name Krakatoa is in the Old Sundanese text Bujangga Manik, which was probably written in western Java in the late 15th century. Here Krakatoa is referred to as &quot;the island of Rakata, a mountain in the middle of the sea&quot; (&quot;pulo Rakata gunung ti tengah sagara&quot;, f. 27v). Although there are earlier descriptions in European sources of an island in the Sunda Strait with a &quot;pointed mountain,&quot; the earliest mention of Krakatoa by name in the western world was on a 1611 map by Lucas Janszoon Waghenaer, who labelled the island &quot;Pulo Carcata&quot; (&quot;pulo&quot; is the Sundanese word for &quot;island&quot;). About two dozen variants have been found, including &quot;Crackatouw,&quot; &quot;Cracatoa,&quot; and &quot;Krakatao&quot; (in an older Portuguese-based spelling). The first known appearance of the spelling &quot;Krakatau&quot; was by Wouter Schouten, who passed by &quot;the high tree-covered island of Krakatau&quot; in October 1658.

The origin of the Indonesian name &quot;Krakatau&quot; is uncertain. The main theories are:
* From Sanskrit &quot;karka&quot; or &quot;karkaṭa&quot; or &quot;karkaṭaka,&quot; meaning &quot;lobster&quot; or &quot;crab&quot;. The abbreviated form &quot;rakaṭa&quot; also means &quot;crab&quot; in the Old Javanese language. The fact that the earliest recorded mentions of the word closely resemble the pronunciation of these words for crab (&quot;rakata&quot; in &quot;Bujangga Manik&quot; and &quot;carcata&quot; in Waghenaer&#x27;s map) makes this Sanskrit etymology the most likely origin of the word.
* Onomatopoeia, imitating the noise made by cockatoos (&quot;Kakatoes&quot;) which used to inhabit the island. However, Van den Berg points out that these birds are found only in the &quot;eastern part of the archipelago&quot; (meaning the Lesser Sundas, east of Java, on the other side of the Wallace Line).
* The closest Malay word is &quot;kelakatu,&quot; meaning &quot;white-winged ant&quot;. Furneaux points out that in pre-1883 maps, Krakatoa does somewhat resemble an ant seen from above, with Lang and Verlaten lying to the sides like wings.
* Van den Berg (1884) recites a story that &quot;Krakatau&quot; was the result of a linguistic error. According to the legend, a visiting ship&#x27;s captain asked a local inhabitant the island&#x27;s name, and the latter replied, &quot;Kaga tau&quot; (&quot;Aku enggak tahu&quot;)—a Jakartan/Betawinese slang phrase meaning &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;. This story is largely discounted; it closely resembles other linguistic myths about the origin of the word kangaroo and the name of the Yucatán Peninsula.

The Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Global Volcanism Program cites the Indonesian name, &quot;Krakatau,&quot; as the correct name, but says that &quot;Krakatoa&quot; is often employed.

== Geographical setting ==
Indonesia has over 130 active volcanoes, the most of any nation. They make up the axis of the Indonesian island arc system produced by northeastward subduction of the Indo-Australian Plate. A majority of these volcanoes lie along Indonesia&#x27;s two largest islands, Java and Sumatra. These two islands are separated by the Sunda Strait located at a bend in the axis of the island arc. Krakatau is directly above the subduction zone of the Eurasian Plate and the Indo-Australian Plate where the plate boundaries make a sharp change of direction, possibly resulting in an unusually weak crust in the region.

== Pre-1883 history ==
At some point in prehistory, an earlier caldera-forming eruption had occurred, leaving as remnants Verlaten (or &quot;Sertung&quot;); Lang (also known as Rakata Kecil, or Panjang); Poolsche Hoed (&quot;Polish Hat&quot;); and the base of Rakata. Later, at least two more cones (Perboewatan and Danan) formed and eventually joined with Rakata, forming the main island of Krakatoa. At the time of the 1883 eruption, the Krakatoa group comprised Lang, Verlaten, and Krakatoa itself, an island long by wide. There were also the tree-covered islet near Lang (Poolsche Hoed) and several small rocky islets or banks between Krakatoa and Verlaten.

There were three volcanic cones on Krakatoa island: Rakata, () to the south; Danan, () near the center; and Perboewatan, () to the north.

=== AD 416 event ===
The Javanese &quot;Book of Kings&quot; (&quot;Pustaka Raja&quot;), a 19th-century compilation of historical traditions from Central Java, records that in the year 338 Śaka (416 AD):
The &quot;Pustaka Raja&quot; does not draw on primary sources for its description of this event, and its historical reliability is highly dubious. It is therefore impossible to verify its description of this eruption. There is no geological evidence presented that substantiates this eruption. David Keys, Ken Wohletz, and others have postulated that a violent volcanic eruption, possibly of Krakatoa, in 535 was responsible for the global climate changes of 535–536. Drilling projects in Sunda Strait ruled out any possibility that an eruption took place in 535 AD.

=== Middle Ages ===
Thornton mentions that Krakatoa was known as &quot;The Fire Mountain&quot; during Java&#x27;s Sailendra dynasty, with records of seven eruptive events between the 9th and 16th centuries. These have been tentatively dated as having occurred in 850, 950, 1050, 1150, 1320, and 1530.

=== 1680 ===
In February 1681, Johann Wilhelm Vogel, a Dutch mining engineer at Salida, Sumatra (near Padang), on his way to Batavia (now Jakarta) passed through the Sunda Strait. In his diary he wrote:

Vogel spent several months in Batavia, returning to Sumatra in November 1681. On the same ship were several other Dutch travellers, including Elias Hesse, a writer. Hesse&#x27;s journal reports:

The eruption was also reported by a Bengali sea captain, who wrote of the event later, but had not recorded it at the time in the ship&#x27;s log. Neither Vogel nor Hesse mention Krakatoa in any real detail in their other passages, and no other travellers at the time mention an eruption or evidence of one. (In November 1681, a pepper crop was being offered for sale by inhabitants.)

Simon Winchester maintains, in his 2003 book &quot;&quot;, that the 1680 eruption was depicted in an eighteenth-century etching by Dutch cartographer Jan van Schley called &quot;Het Brandende Eiland&quot;, &quot;The Burning Island,&quot; writing that &quot;it was a depiction, without a doubt, of the otherwise little-chronicled eruption that supposedly took place in 1680.&quot;

In 1880, Verbeek investigated a fresh unweathered lava flow at the northern coast of Perboewatan, which he claimed could not have been more than two centuries old.

=== Visit by HMS &quot;Discovery&quot; ===
In February 1780, the crews of and , on the way home after Captain James Cook&#x27;s death in Hawaii, stopped for a few days on Krakatoa. They found a freshwater and a hot spring on the island. They described the natives who then lived on the island as &quot;friendly&quot; and made several sketches (In his journal, John Ledyard calls the island &quot;Cocoterra&quot;).

=== Visit by USS &quot;Peacock&quot; ===
Edmund Roberts calls the island &quot;Crokatoa&quot; in his journal. A paraphrased account follows: 

On 8 September 1832, US sloop-of-war &quot;Peacock&quot; anchored off the north end, also visiting Lang Island, in search of inhabitants, fresh water and yams. It was found difficult to land anywhere, due to a heavy surf and to the coral having extended itself to a considerable distance from the shore. Hot springs boiling furiously up, through many fathoms of water, were found on the eastern side of Krakatoa, from the shore. Roberts, Captain Geisinger, and marine lieutenant Fowler visited Forsaken island, having mistaken the singing of locusts for the sound of running water. The boat glided over crystal clear water, over an extensive and highly beautiful submarine garden. Corals of every shape and hue were there, some resembling sunflowers and mushrooms, others cabbages from in diameter, while a third type bore a striking likeness to the rose. The hillsides were typical of tropical climate; large flocks of parrots, monkeys in great variety, wild-mango and orange groves—a superb scene of plants and flowers of every description, glowing in vivid tints of purple, red, blue, brown, and green—but not water or provisions.

=== Dutch activity ===
In 1620, the Dutch set up a naval station on the islands and somewhat later a shipyard was built. Sometime in the late 17th century, an attempt was made to establish a pepper plantation on Krakatoa, but the islands were generally ignored by the Dutch East India Company. In 1809, a penal colony was established at an unspecified location, which was in operation for about a decade. By the 1880s, the islands were without permanent inhabitants; the nearest settlement was the nearby island of Sebesi (about away) with a population of 3,000.

Several surveys and mariners&#x27; charts were made, and the islands were little explored or studied. An 1854 map of the islands was used in an English chart, which shows some difference from a Dutch chart made in 1874. In July 1880, Rogier Verbeek made an official survey of the islands, but was allowed to spend only a few hours there. He was able to collect samples from several places, and his investigation later proved important in judging the geological impact of the 1883 eruption.

== 1883 eruption ==

While seismic activity around the volcano was intense in the years preceding the cataclysmic 1883 eruption, a series of lesser eruptions began on 20 May 1883. The volcano released huge plumes of steam and ash lasting until late August.

On 27 August, a series of four huge explosions almost destroyed the island. The explosions were so violent that they were heard away in Perth, Western Australia, and the island of Rodrigues near Mauritius, away. The pressure wave from the third and most violent explosion was recorded on barographs around the world. Several barographs recorded the wave seven times over the course of five days: four times with the wave travelling away from the volcano to its antipodal point, and three times travelling back to the volcano; the wave rounded the globe three and a half times. Ash was propelled to a height of . It was reported that the sound of the eruption was so loud that anyone within would have gone deaf.

The combined effects of pyroclastic flows, volcanic ashes, and tsunamis had disastrous results in the region and worldwide. The death toll recorded by the Dutch authorities was 36,417, although some sources put the estimate at more than 120,000. There are numerous documented reports of groups of human skeletons floating across the Indian Ocean on rafts of volcanic pumice and washing up on the east coast of Africa up to a year after the eruption. Summer temperatures in the northern hemisphere fell by an average of in the year following the eruption.

==Aftermath==

=== Anak Krakatau ===
Verbeek, in his report on the eruption, predicted that any new activity would manifest itself in the region which had been between Perboewatan and Danan. This prediction came true on 29 December 1927, when a submarine lava dome in the area of Perboewatan showed evidence of eruptions (an earlier event in the same area had been reported in June 1927). A new island volcano rose above the waterline a few days later. The eruptions were initially of pumice and ash, and that island and the two islands that followed were quickly eroded away by the sea. Eventually, a fourth island, named Anak Krakatau (meaning &quot;child of Krakatoa&quot; in Indonesian), broke water in August 1930 and produced lava flows more quickly than the waves could erode them.

=== Political ===
On October 2, 1883, five weeks after the eruption, a Dutch soldier was repeatedly stabbed by a bearded, white-robed man while paying for tobacco in the small town of Serang. The would-be assassin was never captured, but a similarly-dressed man attacked a sentry at the garrison six weeks later, blaming the Dutch for bringing divine vengeance upon the area. The &quot;extreme religious zeal&quot; noted by the man&#x27;s interrogators seen as widespread, and historians suggest it was exploited by rising Muslim conservatives and anticolonial leaders (such as Abdul Karim Amrullah) to foment the Banten Peasant&#x27;s Revolt in 1888, and to prey upon the Dutch conscience made uneasy by &quot;Max Havelaar&quot; and subsequent revelations of abuses. 

The explosion was the first natural disaster in history whose effects were definitively felt worldwide and whose cause was known, following the development of transoceanic communication cables. Winchester suggests the disaster marks the birth of an era of global awareness.

== Biological research ==
The islands have become a major case study of island biogeography and founder populations in an ecosystem being built from the ground up in an environment virtually cleaned.

The islands had been little studied or biologically surveyed before the 1883 catastrophe—only two pre-1883 biological collections are known: one of plant specimens and the other part of a shell collection. From descriptions and drawings made by , the flora appears to have been representative of a typical Javan tropical climax forest. The pre-1883 fauna is virtually unknown but was probably typical of the smaller islands in the area.

=== Botanical studies ===
From a biological perspective, the &quot;Krakatau problem&quot; refers to the question of whether the islands were completely sterilized by the 1883 eruption or whether some indigenous life survived. When the first researchers reached the islands in May 1884, the only living thing they found was a spider in a crevice on the south side of Rakata. Life quickly recolonized the islands, however; Verbeek&#x27;s visit in October 1884 found grass shoots already growing. The eastern side of the island has been extensively vegetated by trees and shrubs, presumably brought there as seeds washed up by ocean currents or carried in birds&#x27; droppings (or brought by natives and scientific investigators). However, the floral ecosystem on Rakata is considerably vulnerable to environmental factors, and has been damaged by recent eruptions at Anak Krakatau.

=== Handl&#x27;s occupancy ===
In 1914, plans were to set aside Rakata as a nature preserve. In 1916, Johann Handl, a German &quot;pumice collector&quot;, obtained a permit to mine pumice, against &quot;strong community objections&quot;, apparently to get away from World War I. His lease of (basically the eastern half of the island) was to be for 30 years. Handl took up residence on the south coast of Rakata, where he built a house and planted a garden along with &quot;four European families and about 30 coolies&quot;. Handl found un-burned wood below the 1883 ash deposits while digging, and fresh water was found below . He and his entourage stayed there for four years, but left due to &quot;violation of the terms of the lease.&quot; It is his party that is believed to have inadvertently introduced the black rat to the island, which quickly proliferated.
==Conservation==
Krakatoa was declared as a nature reserve in 1921, corresponding to IUCN management category Ia (strict nature reserve). Along with several other nature reserves, it was proposed as a national park in 1980. In 1991, &quot;Ujung Kulon National Park and Krakatau Nature Reserve&quot; was inscribed as an UNESCO World Heritage Site, matching Natural criteria (vii) and (x). Ujung Kulon National Park was officially established in 1992, including Krakatoa.

==In popular culture==

A large part of the 1947 children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Twenty-One Balloons&quot; by William Pene du Bois takes place on Krakatoa, just before and then during the 1883 eruption. In Pene du Bois&#x27;s tale, 25 families have established a fanciful colony drawing vast wealth from fictional diamond mines on the island until the eruption scatters the inhabitants and destroys the mines.

Krakatoa has been featured as a subject and a part of the story in various television and film dramas. In the 1953 film &quot;Fair Wind to Java&quot;, an American sea captain and a pirate leader race one another to recover a fortune in diamonds hidden on Krakatoa, which begins its final eruption as they search the island for the treasure. 

In 1961, the anthology series &quot;&quot; ended its run with the episode &quot;Eye Witness,&quot; which dramatized the mysterious reporting of Krakatoa&#x27;s eruption weeks before the news could have reached the newspaper in Boston.

The island was a prominent part of the plot of &#x27;&quot;Crack of Doom,&quot; episode six of the Irwin Allen television series &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot; in 1966.

It was also featured as the main part of the story line in the 1969 film, &quot;Krakatoa, East of Java&quot; (retitled &quot;Volcano&quot; in a re-release in the 1970s; the title contains a rather large geographical error, as Krakatoa is &quot;west&quot; of Java), which depicts an effort to salvage a priceless cargo of pearls located perilously close to the erupting volcano.

Krakatoa is referenced in SpongeBob SquarePants by the character Squidward Tentacles. In the episode Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy V, Squidward adopts the persona of a superhero named Captain Magma whose catchphrase is &quot;Krakatoa&quot;.

An Indonesian martial arts action film, &quot;Krakatau&quot; (1977), starring Dicky Zulkarnaen and Advent Bangun, set the story on the mountain. 

It has been the subject of a 2006 television drama, &quot;Krakatoa: Volcano of Destruction&quot; and again in 2008 as &quot;Krakatoa&quot;.

In Klaus Teuber&#x27;s board game &quot;Seafarers of Catan&quot;, the &quot;Krakatoa Variant&quot; is a scenario involving an island composed of three volcano tiles.

In 1973, the American progressive rock band Styx released a spoken-word track called &quot;Krakatoa&quot; on its album &quot;The Serpent Is Rising.&quot; Written by then-guitarist John Curulewski along with Paul Beaver and Bernie Krause, the song tells the story of Krakatoa&#x27;s eruption and the subsequent return of life to the island.

The British heavy metal band Saxon also released a song about the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, called &quot;Krakatoa&quot;, on the 2010 re-release of its 1985 album &quot;Innocence Is No Excuse&quot;.

<text>A kremlin ( ; ) is a major fortified central complex found in historic Russian cities. The word is often used to refer to the Moscow Kremlin and metonymically to the government based there. Other such fortresses are called &quot;detinets&quot;, such as the Novgorod Detinets.

==Etymology==
The Russian word is of uncertain origin. Different versions include the word originating from the Turkic languages, the Greek language or from Baltic languages. The word may share the same root as &quot;kremen&quot;&#x27; (), meaning &#x27;flint&#x27;.

== History ==
=== Kremlins in Rus&#x27; ===
The Slavs began to build fortresses to protect their lands from enemies in the ninth century. It is known that the Scandinavians called the Slavic lands the land of fortresses—&quot;Gardariki&quot;. Arabic geographer Al-Bakri wrote: &quot;And that is how the Slavs build a large part of their fortresses: they head for meadows, rich in water and reeds, and there mark a round or rectangular place, depending on the shape they want to make a fortress, and they dig around the moat, and the dugout earth is dumped in a rampart, reinforcing it with planks and piles, like beaten earth, until the wall reaches the desired height. Then they measure the door at whichever side they want, and approach by a wooden bridge&quot;. In ancient times, a wooden fence was built on the crest of a rampart, a palisade or zapolot (the wall made of logs, vertically one above the other, and connected with horizontally laid timbers). The way of defending the settlement was primitive; later wooden fortress walls became more preferable.

In the 8th century, the earliest known stone and wooden fortress—Lubšanská fortress near Staraya Ladoga was built. The ancient stone and wooden kremlins include a fortress on Truvorov settlement near Izborsk (9th century) and the first Stara Ladoga Kremlin (the end of the 9th century, later rebuilt). Single stone towers, gates and bends of walls appeared in other cities (Vladimir, Kyiv, Novgorod, Pereyaslavl): the Golden Gate of Kievan citadel and the gate of the Vladimir Kremlin bearing the same name survived.

A special type of wooden and stone Kremlins appeared under the influence of architectural traditions of Poland and Hungary. They were characterised by the juxtaposition of wooden walls and towers with vezha—high stone towers standing inside the fortress, which were used as watchtowers. Constructions, called Volyn towers, were erected, for example, in the citadels of Kholmsk, Kamenets and Gorodeni.

During the Mongol-Tatar invasion, many Russian wooden and stone-wooden fortresses were taken and destroyed by the Mongols. The long-lasting Mongol-Tatar yoke slowed down the development of Russian fortification architecture for a century and a half, as internecine wars stopped and the need to build fortresses disappeared.

The tradition of fortress construction was preserved in Novgorod and Pskov lands which were not damaged by the Mongol invasion. Here are built not only kremlins (Izborsk, Porkhov) but—for the first time in Russia—fortresses, which were not many cities in the full sense of the word, as defensive structures (Koporie, Oreshek, Yam, Korela, Ostrov, Kobyla). The strongest of the Russian fortresses was the Pskov Kremlin, which had no equal in Russia in the number of sustained sieges.

=== Kremlins of the Russian state ===
The term Kremlin (in the variant Kremnik) is first encountered in chronicles of 1317 in accounts of the construction of the Tver Kremlin, where a wooden city-fortress was erected, which was clayed and whitewashed.

Wooden fortresses were erected everywhere in the Russian state—from the Far East lands to the Swedish borders. They were numerous in the South, where they served as a link of fortified fortification zones cutting off the way to the central regions from Crimean Tatars. Aesthetically wooden fortresses were not inferior to stone ones—and we can regret that the towers of wooden kremlins have not survived to this day. Wooden fortresses were built quickly: in 1638 in Mtsensk fortress walls of Bolshoi Ostrog and Pletny Gorod with a total length of about 3 kilometres with 13 towers and almost one hundred meters long bridge over the River Zusha were erected in 20 days. The town of Sviyazhsk was built similarly during the Kazan campaign in the spring of 1551: fortress walls about 2.5 kilometres long, many churches and houses were erected in a month.

Later on, many Kremlins were rebuilt and strengthened. Thus, the Moscow Kremlin under Ivan the Third was reconstructed of bricks.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, about 30 stone fortresses were built in the Russian State. New Kremlins have regular geometric forms in plan (Zaraisky and Tula Kremlins). The Tula Kremlin is unique because it was built in a valley (which was possible because of undeveloped siege artillery of nomad Tatars).

Construction of the Kremlin lasted until the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries. The last Kremlin structure was built of stone between 1699 and 1717 in the town of Tobolsk (the easternmost Kremlin in Russia).

After the disintegrations of the Kievan Rus, the Russian Empire and the USSR, some fortresses considered Kremlin-type, remained beyond the borders of modern Russia. Some are listed below:
* Belz, Ukraine (only traces)
* Kyiv, Ukraine (reconstructed tower of the Golden Gate)
* Putyvl, Ukraine
* Novhorod-Siverskyi, Ukraine
* Chernihiv, Ukraine (only traces)
* Kamyanyets, Belarus (shafts and Belaya Vezha tower)
* Belgorod Kievsky, Ukraine (now village Belgorodka)

The same structure in Novgorodshina, Ukraine and other Old Russian territories is also called dytynets (, from &quot;dytyna&quot; – child). The term has been in use since the 11th century. The term &quot;kremlin&quot; first appeared in 14th century in various Russian territories, where it replaced &quot;dytynets&quot;.

Many Russian monasteries have been built in a fortress-like style similar to that of a kremlin. For a partial list, see Monasteries in Russia.

<text>In economics, Kondratiev waves (also called supercycles, great surges, long waves, K-waves or the long economic cycle) are hypothesized cycle-like phenomena in the modern world economy. The phenomenon is closely connected with the technology life cycle.

It is stated that the period of a wave ranges from forty to sixty years, the cycles consist of alternating intervals of high sectoral growth and intervals of relatively slow growth.

Long wave theory is not accepted by most academic economists. Among economists who accept it, there is a lack of agreement about both the cause of the waves and the start and end years of particular waves. Among critics of the theory, the consensus is that it involves recognizing patterns that may not exist (apophenia).

== History of concept ==
The Soviet economist Nikolai Kondratiev (also written Kondratieff or Kondratyev) was the first to bring these observations to international attention in his book &quot;The Long Waves in Economic Life&quot; (1926) alongside other works written in the same decade. In 1939, Joseph Schumpeter suggested naming the cycles &quot;Kondratieff waves&quot; in his honor. The underlying idea is closely linked to organic composition of capital.

Two Dutch economists, Jacob van Gelderen and Salomon de Wolff, had previously argued for the existence of 50- to 60-year cycles in 1913 and 1924, respectively.

Since the inception of the theory, various studies have expanded the range of possible cycles, finding longer or shorter cycles in the data. The Marxist scholar Ernest Mandel revived interest in long-wave theory with his 1964 essay predicting the end of the long boom after five years and in his Alfred Marshall lectures in 1979. However, in Mandel&#x27;s theory long waves are the result of the normal business cycle and noneconomic factors, such as wars.

In 1996, George Modelski and William R. Thompson published a book documenting K-Waves dating back to 930 AD in China. Separately, Michael Snyder wrote: &quot;economic cycle theories have enabled some analysts to correctly predict the timing of recessions, stock market peaks and stock market crashes over the past couple of decades&quot;.

The historian Eric Hobsbawm also wrote of the theory: &quot;That good predictions have proved possible on the basis of Kondratiev Long Waves—this is not very common in economics—has convinced many historians and even some economists that there is something in them, even if we don&#x27;t know what&quot;.

US economist Anwar Shaikh analyses the movement of the general price level - prices expressed in gold - in the US and the UK since 1890 and identifies three long cycles with troughs ca. in 1895, 1939 and 1982. With this model 2018 was another trough between the third and a possible future fourth cycle.

== Characteristics of the cycle ==
Kondratiev identified three phases in the cycle, namely expansion, stagnation and recession. More common today is the division into four periods with a turning point (collapse) between expansion and stagnation.

Writing in the 1920s, Kondratiev proposed to apply the theory to the 19th century:
* 1790–1849, with a turning point in 1815.
* 1850–1896, with a turning point in 1873.
* Kondratiev supposed that in 1896 a new cycle had started.

The long cycle supposedly affects all sectors of an economy. Kondratiev focused on prices and interest rates, seeing the ascendant phase as characterized by an increase in prices and low interest rates while the other phase consists of a decrease in prices and high interest rates. Subsequent analysis concentrated on output.

== Explanations of the cycle ==
=== Technological innovation theory ===
According to the innovation theory, these waves arise from the bunching of basic innovations that launch technological revolutions that in turn create leading industrial or commercial sectors. Kondratiev&#x27;s ideas were taken up by Joseph Schumpeter in the 1930s. The theory hypothesized the existence of very long-run macroeconomic and price cycles, originally estimated to last 50–54 years.

In recent decades there has been considerable progress in historical economics and the history of technology, and numerous investigations of the relationship between technological innovation and economic cycles. Some of the works involving long cycle research and technology include Mensch (1979), Tylecote (1991), the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) (Marchetti, Ayres), Freeman and Louçã (2001), Andrey Korotayev and Carlota Perez.

Perez (2002) places the phases on a logistic or &quot;S&quot; curve, with the following labels: the beginning of a technological era as irruption, the ascent as frenzy, the rapid build out as synergy and the completion as maturity.

=== Demographic theory ===
Because people have fairly typical spending patterns through their life cycle, such as spending on schooling, marriage, first car purchase, first home purchase, upgrade home purchase, maximum earnings period, maximum retirement savings and retirement, demographic anomalies such as baby booms and busts exert a rather predictable influence on the economy over a long time period. The Easterlin hypothesis deals with the post-war baby-boom. Harry Dent has written extensively on demographics and economic cycles. Tylecote (1991) devoted a chapter to demographics and the long cycle.

=== Land speculation ===

Georgists such as Mason Gaffney, Fred Foldvary and Fred Harrison argue that land speculation is the driving force behind the boom and bust cycle. Land is a finite resource which is necessary for all production and they claim that because exclusive usage rights are traded around, this creates speculative bubbles which can be exacerbated by overzealous borrowing and lending. As early as 1997, a number of Georgists predicted that a depression would occur in 2008.

=== Debt deflation ===

Debt deflation is a theory of economic cycles which holds that recessions and depressions are due to the overall level of debt shrinking (deflating). Hence, the credit cycle is the cause of the economic cycle.

The theory was developed by Irving Fisher following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression. Debt deflation was largely ignored in favor of the ideas of John Maynard Keynes in Keynesian economics, but it has enjoyed a resurgence of interest since the 1980s, both in mainstream economics and in the heterodox school of post-Keynesian economics and has subsequently been developed by such post-Keynesian economists as Hyman Minsky and Steve Keen.

== Modern modifications of Kondratiev theory ==

There are several modern timing versions of the cycle although most are based on either of two causes: one on technology and the other on the credit cycle.

Additionally, there are several versions of the technological cycles and they are best interpreted using diffusion curves of leading industries. For example, railways only started in the 1830s, with steady growth for the next 45 years. It was after Bessemer steel was introduced that railroads had their highest growth rates. However, this period is usually labeled the age of steel. Measured by value added, the leading industry in the U.S. from 1880 to 1920 was machinery, followed by iron and steel.

Any influence of technology during the cycle that began in the Industrial Revolution pertains mainly to England. The U.S. was a commodity producer and was more influenced by agricultural commodity prices. There was a commodity price cycle based on increasing consumption causing tight supplies and rising prices. That allowed new land to the west to be purchased and after four or five years to be cleared and be in production, driving down prices and causing a depression as in 1819 and 1839. By the 1850s, the U.S. was becoming industrialized.

The technological cycles can be labeled as follows:

* Industrial Revolution (1771)
* Age of Steam and Railways (1829)
* Age of Steel and Heavy Engineering (1875)
* Age of Oil, Electricity, the Automobile and Mass Production (1908)
* Age of Information and Telecommunications (1971)

Some argue that this logic can be extended. The custom of classifying periods of human development by its dominating general purpose technology has surely been borrowed from historians, starting with the Stone Age. Including those, authors distinguish three different long-term metaparadigms, each with different long waves. The first focused on the transformation of material, including stone, bronze, and iron. The second, often referred to as the Industrial Revolution and Second Industrial Revolution, was dedicated to the transformation of energy, including water, steam, electric, and combustion power. Finally, the most recent metaparadigm aims at transforming information. It started out with the proliferation of communication and stored data and has now entered the age of algorithms, which aims at creating automated processes to convert the existing information into actionable knowledge.

Several papers on the relationship between technology and the economy were written by researchers at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). A concise version of Kondratiev cycles can be found in the work of Robert Ayres (1989) in which he gives a historical overview of the relationships of the most significant technologies. Cesare Marchetti published on Kondretiev waves and on the diffusion of innovations. Arnulf Grübler&#x27;s book (1990) gives a detailed account of the diffusion of infrastructures including canals, railroads, highways and airlines, with findings that the principal infrastructures have midpoints spaced in time corresponding to 55-year K wavelengths, with railroads and highways taking almost a century to complete. Grübler devotes a chapter to the long economic wave. In 1996, Giancarlo Pallavicini published the ratio between the long Kondratiev wave and information technology and communication.

Korotayev et al. recently employed spectral analysis and claimed that it confirmed the presence of Kondratiev waves in the world GDP dynamics at an acceptable level of statistical significance. Korotayev et al. also detected shorter business cycles, dating the Kuznets to about 17 years and calling it the third harmonic of the Kondratiev, meaning that there are three Kuznets cycles per Kondratiev.

Leo A. Nefiodow shows that the fifth Kondratieff ended with the global economic crisis of 2000–2003 while the new, sixth Kondratieff started simultaneously. According to Leo A. Nefiodow, the carrier of this new long cycle will be health in a holistic sense—including its physical, psychological, mental, social, ecological and spiritual aspects; the basic innovations of the sixth Kondratieff are &quot;psychosocial health&quot; and &quot;biotechnology&quot;.

More recently, the physicist and systems scientist Tessaleno Devezas advanced a causal model for the long wave phenomenon based on a generation-learning model and a nonlinear dynamic behaviour of information systems. In both works, a complete theory is presented containing not only the explanation for the existence of K-Waves, but also and for the first time an explanation for the timing of a K-Wave (≈60 years = two generations).

A specific modification of the theory of Kondratieff cycles was developed by Daniel Šmihula. Šmihula identified six long-waves within modern society and the capitalist economy, each of which was initiated by a specific technological revolution:

# Wave of the Financial-agricultural revolution (1600–1780)
# Wave of the Industrial revolution (1780–1880)
# Wave of the Technical revolution (1880–1940)
# Wave of the Scientific-technical revolution (1940–1985)
# Wave of the Information and telecommunications revolution (1985–2015)
# Hypothetical wave of the post-informational technological revolution (Internet of things/renewable energy transition?) (2015–2035?)

Unlike Kondratieff and Schumpeter, Šmihula believed that each new cycle is shorter than its predecessor. His main stress is put on technological progress and new technologies as decisive factors of any long-time economic development. Each of these waves has its innovation phase which is described as a technological revolution and an application phase in which the number of revolutionary innovations falls and attention focuses on exploiting and extending existing innovations. As soon as an innovation or a series of innovations becomes available, it becomes more efficient to invest in its adoption, extension and use than in creating new innovations. Each wave of technological innovations can be characterized by the area in which the most revolutionary changes took place (&quot;leading sectors&quot;).

Every wave of innovations lasts approximately until the profits from the new innovation or sector fall to the level of other, older, more traditional sectors. It is a situation when the new technology, which originally increased a capacity to utilize new sources from nature, reached its limits and it is not possible to overcome this limit without an application of another new technology.

At the end of an application phase of any wave there is typically an economic crisis and economic stagnation. The financial crisis of 2007–2008 is a result of the coming end of the &quot;wave of the Information and telecommunications technological revolution&quot;. Some authors have started to predict what the sixth wave might be, such as James Bradfield Moody and Bianca Nogrady who forecast that it will be driven by resource efficiency and clean technology. On the other hand, Šmihula himself considers the waves of technological innovations during the modern age (after 1600 AD) only as a part of a much longer &quot;chain&quot; of technological revolutions going back to the pre-modern era. It means he believes that we can find long economic cycles (analogical to Kondratiev cycles in modern economy) dependent on technological revolutions even in the Middle Ages and the Ancient era.

== Criticism of Kondratiev theory ==

Long wave theory is not accepted by many academic economists. However, it is important for innovation-based, development and evolutionary economics. Yet, among economists who accept it, there has been no formal universal agreement about the standards that should be used universally to place the start and end years for each wave. Agreement of start and end years can be +1 to 3 years for each 40- to 65-year cycle.

Health economist and biostatistician Andreas J. W. Goldschmidt searched for patterns and proposed that there is a phase shift and overlap of the so-called Kondratiev cycles of IT and health (shown in the figure). He argued that historical growth phases in combination with key technologies do not necessarily imply the existence of regular cycles in general. Goldschmidt is of the opinion that different fundamental innovations and their economic stimuli do not exclude each other as they mostly vary in length and their benefit is not applicable to all participants in a market.

<text>Kathleen Norris Stark (born April 26, 1956), better known as Koo Stark, is an American photographer and actress, known for her relationship with Prince Andrew. She is a patron of the Julia Margaret Cameron Trust, which runs the museum of the Victorian pioneer photographer.

==Early life and education==
Stark was born in New York. Her parents were Wilbur Stark, a writer and producer, and Kathi Norris, a writer and television presenter in New York City. She is the youngest of three children. At the time of her birth, the family lived in Manhattan. Her grandfather, Edwin Earl Norris, was a cabinetmaker and musician, playing horn and viola in the Newark Symphony Orchestra. Her mother&#x27;s family were Presbyterians. After a divorce in the 1960s, her mother remarried.

Koo Stark attended the Hewitt School in New York and the Glendower Preparatory School in Kensington, London. After training at a stage school, she began her acting career.

==Career==

===Acting===
Her first film role was in the comedy &quot;All I Want Is You... and You... and You...&quot; (1974), produced by her father. In 1975 she appeared in &quot;Las adolescentes&quot; (The Adolescents), opposite Anthony Andrews, and starred in an episode of &quot;Shades of Greene&quot;.
Also that year she had an uncredited role as a bridesmaid in &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;. Her best-remembered performance is the lead role in the erotic film &quot;Emily&quot; (1976), directed by Henry Herbert, 17th Earl of Pembroke. Uncertain whether to accept the part, Stark did so on the advice of Graham Greene, with whom she had worked the year before. Of working with her in &quot;Emily&quot;, actor Victor Spinetti later wrote &quot;I found Koo Stark to be an enchanting girl and terribly bright and interesting&quot;.

She also appeared in &quot;Cruel Passion&quot; (1977), a film based on the novel &quot;Justine&quot;. Around the same time, she played the part of Camie Marstrap in &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977); the scenes in which she appeared were cut from the film before its original release, but can be seen in &quot;Star Wars: Behind the Magic&quot; (1998).

Stark also began to work as a fashion model, particularly for Norman Parkinson. In February 1981, she was an understudy in the Edward Albee play &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; at the National Theatre.

She appeared in the comedy &quot;Eat the Rich&quot; (1987), and then featured in &quot;Timeslides&quot;, an episode of the sci-fi show &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; (1989), playing Lady Sabrina Mulholland-Jjones, the fiancée of a more successful Dave Lister. 

In September 1987, she returned to the stage, taking the part of Vera Claythorne in Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre. The &quot;London Theatre Record&quot; posed the question &quot;Why has a girl so obviously three-dimensional chosen a part so obviously two-dimensional?&quot; She played Miss Scarlett in the 1991 series of &quot;Cluedo&quot;, succeeding Toyah Willcox and befriending Rula Lenska.

===Photography===
Stark has worked as a photographer since the 1980s, and may have been the first person to turn the tables on the pursuing paparazzi by taking photos of them. Prince Andrew has told how in 1983 a photographic printer, Gene Nocon, invited Stark to take photographs of people taking photos of her, for his exhibition, &quot;Personal Points of View&quot;, planned for October. She persuaded Nocon to include Andrew&#x27;s work as well. Her early photographs led to a book deal, for which she took lessons from Norman Parkinson. She travelled to Tobago, where he lived, and he became her mentor. Her book &quot;Contrasts&quot; (1985) included about a hundred of her photographs. She went on to study the work of leading photographers, including Angus McBean, whom she met and photographed, developing her interests in photography to include reportage, portraits, landscapes, still life, and other work.

The book &quot;Contrasts&quot; was launched at Hamiltons Gallery, London, in September 1985, at an exhibition of the same name. In 1994, the Gallery Bar at the Grosvenor House Hotel in Park Lane hosted an exhibition called &#x27;The Stark Image&#x27;, forty photographs by Stark, including several previously unpublished. In 1998, her work was featured at the Como Lario in Holbein Place, Belgravia. In July 2001 she had an exhibition called &#x27;Stark Images&quot; at the Fruitmarket Gallery in Edinburgh, duplicated from June to July 2001 at Dimbola Lodge on the Isle of Wight. A solo exhibition of portraits was at the Winter Gardens, Ventnor, from September to October 2010, and another at Dimbola Lodge from February to April 2011.

On 22 April 1987, a charity auction at Christie&#x27;s, St James&#x27;s, for the Campaign to Protect Rural England, featured signed work by David Bailey, Patrick Lichfield, Don McCullin, Terence Donovan, Fay Godwin, Heather Angel, Clive Arrowsmith, Linda McCartney, Koo Stark, and fifteen others, Views by Stark, including some of Kirby Muxloe Castle, were in G. H. Davies&#x27;s &quot;England&#x27;s Glory&quot; (1987), a CPRE book launched at the same time.

Pictures by Stark have appeared in &quot;Country Life&quot; and other magazines. Several of her portraits are in the National Portrait Gallery, and work is also in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum, both in London.

A Leica user, Stark has said her camera transcends mere function and is a personal friend. A solo exhibition hosted by the Leica gallery in Mayfair in May 2017 was entitled &quot;Kintsugi&quot;, a Japanese word for a way of renovating things that have been broken. Stark explained the title: &quot;Kintsugi is a way of learning to see individual beauty, and to appreciate the value of experience and honesty. It is the antithesis of digital, airbrushed, Photoshop-homogenised &#x27;beauty&#x27;.&quot; In August the exhibition was repeated in Manchester, to mark the opening of a new Leica store there.

==Personal life==
Stark has been a practising Buddhist since meeting the Dalai Lama. She continues to live in London and is a member of the Chelsea Arts Club. She is a Patron of the Julia Margaret Cameron Trust, at Dimbola Lodge on the Isle of Wight, home of the Victorian pioneer photographer Julia Margaret Cameron.

===Relationships===
Stark met Prince Andrew in February 1981, and they were close for some two years, before and after his active service in the Falklands War. Tina Brown has claimed that this was Andrew&#x27;s only serious love affair. In October 1982 they took a holiday together on the island of Mustique. According to Lady Colin Campbell, Andrew was in love, and the Queen was &quot;much taken with the elegant, intelligent, and discreet Koo&quot;. However, in 1983, after 18 months of dating, they split up under pressure from the Queen. In 1997, Prince Andrew became the godfather of Stark&#x27;s daughter, and in 2015, when the Prince was accused by Virginia Roberts over the Jeffrey Epstein connection, Stark came to his defence, stating that he was a good man and she could help to rebut the claims.

Stark married Tim Jefferies, manager of a photographic gallery, in August 1984, at St Saviour&#x27;s, Chalk Farm, with the minister, Christopher Neil-Smith, commenting that &quot;It was such a quiet affair you wouldn&#x27;t have known it was happening.&quot; They stayed together for a year, later divorcing.

She was later engaged to Warren Walker, an American banker, but he cancelled their wedding before the birth of their daughter, Tatiana, in May 1997.

===Legal cases===
In 1988, Stark brought a successful libel action against &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; over an untrue story headed &#x27;Koo dated Andy after she wed&#x27;. In 1989, &quot;The Spectator&quot; reported that she had received £300,000 from one newspaper &quot;for years of inaccurate persecution&quot; and was also collecting money from others.

In another libel action in 2007, Stark won an apology and substantial damages from &quot;Zoo Weekly&quot; magazine, which had described her as a porn star. She commented &quot;I am relieved that my name has been cleared of this false, highly damaging and serious allegation which has been proved to be completely untrue.&quot; In 2011 &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called her an early &quot;Kate Middleton prototype&quot; and suggested that if she had not appeared in the film &quot;Emily&quot; early in her career she might have gone on to become the Duchess of York.

In November 2012, Stark appeared at Hammersmith magistrates court accused of stealing a painting by Dutch master Anthonie van Borssom, worth £40,000, from the home of her ex-partner, American financier Warren Walker. She strenuously denied the allegation. Before the matter came to trial, the painting was returned to Walker and by agreement the prosecution was abandoned.

In November 2022, Stark was awarded substantial damages and received an apology in a court case brought against &quot;Daily Mail&quot;″s parent company for a 2019 article which falsely referred to her as &quot;a soft porn actress&quot;.

===Health===
About 1993, Stark was hit by a taxi in Old Compton Street, London, losing two teeth and also suffering a deep wound to her forehead, after a collision with her camera. This accident left her temporarily disfigured, but the wound eventually healed leaving a small scar just under the hair-line.

In 2002 Stark was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a double mastectomy and chemotherapy, causing her to lose her hair for a time.

<doc id="17289" wikidata="Q186185" url="?curid=17289" title="Kliment Voroshilov">
<text>Kliment Yefremovich Voroshilov ( ; ), popularly known as Klim Voroshilov (; 4 February 1881 – 2 December 1969), was a prominent Soviet military officer and politician during the Stalin-era (1924–1953). He was one of the original five Marshals of the Soviet Union, the second highest military rank of the Soviet Union (junior to the Generalissimo of the Soviet Union, which was a post only held by Joseph Stalin), and served as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal Soviet head of state, from 1953 to 1960.

Born to a Russian worker&#x27;s family in Ukraine, Voroshilov took part in the Russian Revolution of 1917 as an early member of the Bolsheviks. He served with distinction at the Battle of Tsaritsyn, during which he became a close friend of Stalin. Voroshilov was elected to the Central Committee of the Communist Party in 1921, and in 1925 Stalin appointed him People&#x27;s Commissar for Military and Navy Affairs (later People&#x27;s Commissar for Defence). In 1926, he became a full member of the Politburo. In 1935, Voroshilov was named a Marshal of the Soviet Union.

At the outbreak of World War II, Voroshilov was held responsible for Soviet failures in Finland during the Winter War and was replaced as Defense Commissar by Semyon Timoshenko. Following the German invasion in June 1941, he was recalled and appointed to the State Defense Committee. Voroshilov failed to stop the German encirclement of Leningrad and was again relieved from his command in September 1941.

After the war, Voroshilov oversaw the establishment of a socialist regime in Hungary. Following Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, Voroshilov was appointed Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. His fortunes declined during the rise of Nikita Khrushchev and the Supreme Soviet turned against him. He peacefully resigned in 1960, although he came out of retirement in 1966 and re-joined the party. Voroshilov died in 1969 at the age of 88.

==Early life==
Voroshilov was born in the settlement of Verkhnyeye, Bakhmut uyezd, Yekaterinoslav Governorate, Russian Empire (now part of Lysychansk city in Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine). His father, a former soldier, was employed at different times as a railway worker or miner, and went through periods of unemployment. According to the Soviet Major General Petro Grigorenko, Voroshilov himself alluded to the heritage of his birth-country (Ukraine) and to the previous family name of &quot;Voroshylo&quot;.
In his published autobiography, Voroshilov described a childhood of extreme hardship, working from the age of six or seven, and receiving frequent beatings from wealthy peasants, which left him with a lifelong aversion to &#x27;kulaks&#x27;. He grew up illiterate, until he was able to enroll in a newly opened school in a nearby village, at the age of 12, and received two years&#x27; schooling. During his school years, Voroshilov became a close friend and almost a member of the family of Semyon Ryzhkov.

In 1896, he started work in a factory near his home village, where he led a strike in 1899. In 1903, he enrolled in a German owned factory in Luhansk (which was renamed Vorshilov during the Stalin era). There, he joined the Bolsheviks, and acted as a strike leader during the 1905 revolution. In April 1906, he travelled to Stockholm for the Fourth Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP), using the provocative pseudonym &#x27;Volodya Antimekov&#x27; or Anti-Menshevik. In Stockholm, he shared a room with the delegate from Georgia, Josif Dzhugashvili, later known as Stalin.

In spring 1907, he travelled to London for the Fifth RSDLP Congress. On his return, he was arrested and deported to Arkhangelsk, but in December he escaped and moved to Baku, where Stalin was also active. Arrested again in 1908, he was released from exile in 1912, and for a time worked in an ordnance factory in Tsaritsyn (Stalingrad/Volgagrad).

==Russian Revolution and Civil War==

Voroshilov was in Petrograd (St Petersburg) during the February Revolution, but returned to Luhansk, where he was chairman of the town soviet, and was elected to the Constituent Assembly. His military career began early in 1918, when he was given command of the Fifth Ukrainian Army, which was made up of a few scattered units, who were driven out of Ukraine by the German army. After a long, hazardous retreat, his group reached Tsaritsyn, where Stalin was posted in summer 1918 as representative of the central party leadership, and where Voroshilov was given command of the Tenth Army. Stalin and Voroshilov led the Red Army&#x27;s 1918 defense of Tsaritsyn. They also sponsored the creation of the first Red Cavalry unit, commanded by Semyon Budyonny, which was composed chiefly of peasants from southern Russia. In Tsaritsyn, Voroshilov clashed with Leon Trotsky, the People&#x27;s Commissar for War, who considered him undisciplined and unfit to command an army, and in October 1918 threatened him with court martial. Voroshilov was transferred to Ukraine, as commander of the Kharkiv military district, and later People&#x27;s Commissar for War in the Ukraine soviet republic. He sided with the &#x27;Military Opposition&#x27;, who opposed the formation of a centralised army, preferring to rely on local mobile units, and objected to the recruitment into the Red Army of former officers from the Tsarist army. Later, during the Polish–Soviet War, Voroshilov was political commissar with Budienny&#x27;s First Cavalry.
I

==Interwar period==

Voroshilov served as a member of the Central Committee from his election in 1921 until 1961. In April 1921, he was appointed commander of the North Caucasus military district. In March 1924, he was promoted to the post of commander of the Moscow military district. In 1925, after the death of Mikhail Frunze, Voroshilov was appointed People&#x27;s Commissar for Military and Navy Affairs and Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council of the USSR, a post he held until 1934. Despite the high offices he held, Voroshilov appears not to have been part in the inner leadership. In November 1930, the chairman of the Russian government, Sergey Syrtsov alleged that a &quot;tiny group&quot;, which excluded Voroshilov but included nominally much less senior figures such as Pavel Postyshev, was making decisions &quot;behind the back of the Politburo&quot;.

His main accomplishment in this period was to move key Soviet war industries east of the Urals, so that the Soviet Union could strategically retreat, while keeping its manufacturing capability intact. Frunze&#x27;s political position adhered to that of the Troika (Grigory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev, Stalin), but Stalin preferred to have a close, personal ally in charge (as opposed to Frunze, a &quot;Zinovievite&quot;). Frunze was urged by a group of Stalin&#x27;s hand-picked doctors to have surgery to treat an old stomach ulcer, despite previous doctors&#x27; recommendations to avoid surgery and Frunze&#x27;s own unwillingness. He died on the operating table of a massive overdose of chloroform, an anaesthetic. Voroshilov became a full member of the newly formed Politburo in 1926, remaining a member until 1960.

Voroshilov was appointed People&#x27;s Commissar (Minister) for Defence in 1934 and a Marshal of the Soviet Union in 1935.

== The Great Purge ==

During the first of the Moscow trials, in August 1936, Voroshilov was one of four Politburo members who signed the order that appeals for clemency were to be denied and that the defendants were to be executed without delay. He was also of the main speakers at the March 1937 plenum of the Central Committee, which ended with the arrests of Nikolai Bukharin and Alexei Rykov, whom Voroshilov denounced as &quot;renegades&quot;.
In the early stages, he seemed to have believed that the purge would not affect the armed forces, and was seemingly unprepared for the arrest of Marshal Tukhachevsky and others in April and May. Voroshilov did not personally share the paranoia towards upper-class elements of the officer corps. He openly declared that the saboteurs in the Red Army were few in number and tried to save the lives of officers like Lukin, who would serve with distinction during the Second World War, and Sokolov-Strakhov, and he was sometimes successful. But on 30 May, he telephoned the commander of the Ukraine military district, Iona Yakir ordering him to take a train to Moscow for a meeting of the Military Revolutionary Council, knowing that he would be arrested on the way. When the Council met on 1 June 1937, Voroshilov vacated the chair to deliver a report in which he said, apologetically: &quot;I could not believe we would reveal so many and such scoundrels in the ranks of the highest command of our glorious, our valiant Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Army.&quot;
After that, he played a central role in Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge of the 1930s, denouncing many of his own military colleagues and subordinates when asked to do so by Stalin. He wrote personal letters to exiled former Soviet officers and diplomats such as commissar Mikhail Ostrovsky, asking them to return voluntarily to the Soviet Union and falsely reassuring them that they would not face retribution from authorities. Voroshilov personally signed 185 documented execution lists, fourth among the Soviet leadership after Molotov, Stalin and Kaganovich. He had no problem denouncing officers he disliked such as Tukhachevsky.

Despite taking part in the purging of many &quot;mechanisers&quot; (supporters of wide usage of tanks rather than cavalry) from the Red Army, Voroshilov became convinced that reliance on cavalry should be decreased while more modern arms should receive higher priority. Marshal Budyonny tried to recruit him to his cause of protecting the status of cavalry in the Red Army but Voroshilov openly declared his intention to do the opposite. He praised the army&#x27;s combined arms warfare capabilities as well as the high quality and ability to take initiative of the officers during the 1936 summer manoeuvers. However he also pointed out issues in the Red Army as a whole in his full report. Among the issues he pointed out were insufficient communication, ineffective staffs, insufficient cooperation between arms, and the rudimentary nature of the command structure in tank units and other modern arms.

When the Great Purge ended, some reforms were undertaken by the high command to reconcile Red Army doctrine (for example deep operations doctrine) with the real state of the Red Army. The politically appointed commanders of the post-purge Red Army saw that the army, especially after the purge, was not suitable to carry out deep operations style warfare. Commanders such as Voroshilov and Kulik were among the instigators of these reforms which positively impacted the Red Army. These commanders themselves turned out not to be able to carry out such operations in practice. Voroshilov and Kulik turned out to be unable to put these reforms into practice. One of these reforms was a reorganization of Red Army field units which accidentally moved Red Army organization to a far less advanced state than it had been in 1936. This reorganization was conceived by Kulik but put into practice by Voroshilov.

When territorial units were abolished Voroshilov noted that among the reasons for disbanding them was inability to train conscripts in the use of modern technology. He had openly proclaimed that the system was inadequate in an era in which imperialist powers (such as Germany) were expanding the capabilities of their armies. The territorial units had been very unpopular, not only with Voroshilov, but with the Red Army leadership a whole. They were hopelessly ineffective: territorial conscript Alexey Grigorovich Maslov noted that he never fired a shot during his training, while it was noted that these units only underwent real training in the one month a year when experienced veterans returned.

== World War II ==

Voroshilov commanded Soviet troops during the Winter War from November 1939 to January 1940 but, due to poor Soviet planning and Voroshilov&#x27;s incompetence as a general, the Red Army suffered about 320,000 casualties compared to 70,000 Finnish casualties. When the leadership gathered at Stalin&#x27;s dacha at Kuntsevo, Stalin shouted at Voroshilov for the losses; Voroshilov replied in kind, blaming the failure on Stalin for eliminating the Red Army&#x27;s best generals in his purges. Voroshilov followed this retort by smashing a platter of food on the table. Nikita Khrushchev said it was the only time he ever witnessed such an outburst. Voroshilov was nonetheless made the scapegoat for the initial failures in Finland. He was later replaced as Defense Commissar by Semyon Timoshenko. Voroshilov was then made Deputy Premier responsible for cultural matters.
Voroshilov initially argued that thousands of Polish army officers captured in September 1939 should be released, but he later signed the order for their execution in the Katyn massacre of 1940.
Between 1941 and 1944, Voroshilov was a member of the State Defense Committee.

After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Voroshilov became commander of the short-lived Northwestern Direction (July to August 1941), controlling several fronts. In September 1941 he commanded the Leningrad Front. Working alongside military commander Andrei Zhdanov as German advances threatened to cut off Leningrad, he displayed considerable personal bravery in defiance of heavy shelling at Ivanovskoye; at one point he rallied retreating troops and personally led a counter-attack against German tanks armed only with a pistol. However, the style of counterattack he launched had long since been abandoned by strategists and drew mostly contempt from his military colleagues; he failed to prevent the Germans from surrounding Leningrad and he was dismissed from his post and replaced by Georgy Zhukov on 8 September 1941. Stalin had a political need for popular wartime leaders, however, and Voroshilov remained as an important figurehead.

== Post war ==
===Hungary===
Between 1945 and 1947, Voroshilov supervised the establishment of the socialist republic in postwar Hungary. He attributed the poor showing of the Hungarian Communist Party in the October 1945 Budapest municipal elections to the number of minorities in leadership positions, arguing that it was &quot;detrimental to the party that its leaders are not of Hungarian origin&quot;.

===1952–1953 Soviet leadership===

In 1952, Voroshilov was appointed a member of the Presidium of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Stalin&#x27;s death on 5 March 1953 prompted major changes in the Soviet leadership. On 15 March 1953, Voroshilov was approved as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (i.e., the head of state) with Nikita Khrushchev as First Secretary of the Communist Party and Georgy Malenkov as Premier of the Soviet Union. Voroshilov, Malenkov, and Khrushchev brought about the 26 June 1953 arrest of Lavrenty Beria after Stalin&#x27;s death.

One of Voroshilov&#x27;s responsibilities as chairman of the Presidium was to oversee the appeal review of Soviet death row inmates. Analysis by Jeffrey S. Hardy and Yana Skorobogatov describe his role thus:

&quot;Chairman Voroshilov presided over the meetings and clearly had the most influential voice, but split votes were not uncommon and Voroshilov was sometimes outvoted... Throughout his tenure as Presidium chair, he behaved like someone who believed that one should follow established procedure and not act too quickly in matters of life and death.&quot;

Hardy and Skorobogatov indicate that Voroshilov frequently exerted his influence on the committee toward leniency, especially in the case of those who expressed repentance in their appeal documents and those convicted of crimes of passion or under the influence of alcohol; he judged those convicted of political crimes or acts with financial motives more harshly. During his tenure, many individuals sentenced to death had their punishments commuted to prison terms of varying lengths. The authors of the study observe that his successor, Brezhnev, took a noticeably harder line in appeals cases.
However, the contrast between Voroshilov&#x27;s relatively magnanimous attitude toward pardon cases in the 1950s with his well-documented participation in the deadly purges of the 1930s (as described above) was noted even at the time by Khrushchev, who asked him, &quot;So when were you acting according to your conscience, then or now?&quot;

===Fall from grace===
After Khrushchev removed most of the Stalinists like Molotov and Malenkov from the party, Voroshilov&#x27;s career began to fade. On 7 May 1960, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union granted Voroshilov&#x27;s request for retirement and elected Leonid Brezhnev chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Council (the head of state). The Central Committee also relieved him of duties as a member of the Party Presidium (as the Politburo had been called since 1952) on 16 July 1960. In October 1961, his political defeat was complete at the 22nd party congress when he was excluded from election to the Central Committee.

Following Khrushchev&#x27;s fall from power, Soviet leader Brezhnev brought Voroshilov out of retirement into a figurehead political post. Voroshilov was again re-elected to the Central Committee in 1966. Voroshilov was awarded a second medal of Hero of the Soviet Union 1968.

==Death==
During a winter night in 1969, Voroshilov started to feel unwell. His family proposed to call an ambulance immediately, but he adamantly refused. In the morning he put on his military uniform, and after calling a car, he went to the hospital himself, fully decorated. Voroshilov died on 2 December, at the age of 88, and was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, in one of the twelve individual tombs located between the Lenin Mausoleum and the Kremlin wall.

==Personal life==

Voroshilov was married to Ekaterina Voroshilova, born Golda Gorbman, a Ukrainian Jew from Mardarovka. She changed her name when she converted to Orthodox Christianity in order to be allowed to marry Voroshilov. They met while both were exiled in Arkhangelsk, where Ekaterina was sent in 1906. While both serving on the Tsaritsyn Front in 1918, where Ekaterina was helping orphans, they adopted a four-year-old orphan boy who they named Petya. They also adopted the children of Mikhail Frunze following his death in 1925. During Stalin&#x27;s rule, they lived in the Kremlin at the Horse Guards.

His personality as it was described by Molotov in 1974: &quot;Voroshilov was nice, but only in certain times. He always stood for the political line of the party, because he was from a working class, a common man, very good orator. He was clean, yes. And he was personally devoted to Stalin. But his devotion was not very strong. However in this period he advocated Stalin very actively, supported him in everything, though not entirely sure in everything. It also affected their relationship. This is a very complex issue. This must be taken into account to understand why Stalin treated him critically and not invited him at all our conversations. At least at private ones. But he came by himself. Stalin frowned. Under Khrushchev, Voroshilov behaved badly.&quot;

==Honours and awards==

A former competitor in women&#x27;s singles, Yamaguchi is the 1992 Olympic champion, a two-time World champion (1991 and 1992), and the 1992 U.S. champion. In 1992, she became the first Asian American to win a gold medal in a Winter Olympic competition. As a pairs skater with Rudy Galindo, she is the 1988 World Junior champion and a two-time national champion (1989 and 1990).

After Yamaguchi retired from competition in 1992, she performed in shows and participated in the professional competition circuit. She won the World Professional Figure Skating Championships four times in her career (1992, 1994, 1996 and 1997). In 2005, Yamaguchi was inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame, and in 2008, she became the celebrity champion in the sixth season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;.

Yamaguchi is an author and has published five books. &quot;Dream Big, Little Pig!,&quot; for which she received the Gelett Burgess Children&#x27;s Book Award, appeared on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

== Early life ==
Yamaguchi was born on July 12, 1971, in Hayward, California, to Jim Yamaguchi, a dentist, and Carole (née Doi), a medical secretary. Yamaguchi is Sansei (a third-generation descendant of Japanese emigrants). Her paternal grandparents and maternal great-grandparents emigrated to the United States from Japan, originating from Wakayama Prefecture and Saga Prefecture. Yamaguchi&#x27;s grandparents were sent to an internment camp during World War II, where her mother was born. Her maternal grandfather, George A. Doi, was in the U.S. Army and fought in Germany and France during World War II during the time his family was interned at the Heart Mountain and Amache camps. Research done in 2010 by Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. for the PBS series &quot;Faces of America&quot; showed that Yamaguchi&#x27;s heritage can be traced back to Wakayama and Saga prefectures in Japan and that her paternal grandfather, Tatsuichi Yamaguchi, emigrated to Hawaii in 1899.

Yamaguchi and her siblings, Brett and Lori, grew up in Fremont, California. In order to accommodate her training schedule, Yamaguchi was home-schooled for her first two years of high school, but attended Mission San Jose High School for her junior and senior years, where she graduated.

== Competitive skating career ==

=== Early career ===
Yamaguchi was born with bi-lateral clubfoot, resulting in serial leg casting for most of the first year of her life followed by corrective shoes and bracing, and began skating as physical therapy when she was 4 or 5 after seeing Peggy Fleming and Dorothy Hamill in the Ice Follies and Ice Capades.

From sixth grade on, Yamaguchi practiced from 5 a.m. to 10 a.m. before school and sometimes after school. Her mother would drive her to the rink every morning at 4 a.m. and wait for her to finish. She would also accompany Yamaguchi to competitions a couple of times a month.

=== Pairs career ===
In 1986, Yamaguchi won the junior title at the U.S. championships with Rudy Galindo. Two years later, Yamaguchi won the singles and, with Galindo, the pairs titles at the 1988 World Junior Championships; Galindo had won the 1987 World Junior Championship in singles. In 1989 Yamaguchi and Galindo won the senior pairs title at the U.S. Championships. They won the title again in 1990.

As a pairs team, Yamaguchi and Galindo were unusual in that they were both accomplished singles skaters, which allowed them to consistently perform difficult elements like side by side triple flip jumps, which are still more difficult than side by side jumps performed by current top international pairs teams. They also jumped and spun in opposite directions, Yamaguchi counter-clockwise, and Galindo clockwise, which gave them an unusual look on the ice. In 1990, Yamaguchi decided to focus solely on singles. Galindo went on to have a successful singles career as well, winning the 1996 U.S. championships and the 1996 World bronze medal.

=== Singles career ===
==== 1989–90 season: Goodwill Games gold ====
Yamaguchi won her first major international gold medal in figure skating at the 1990 Goodwill Games.

==== 1990–91 season: First world title ====
In 1991, Yamaguchi moved to Edmonton, Alberta, to train with coach Christy Ness. There, she took psychology courses at the University of Alberta. The same year, Yamaguchi placed second to Tonya Harding at the U.S. championships, her third consecutive silver medal at Nationals. The following month in Munich, Germany, Yamaguchi won the 1991 World Championships. That year, the American ladies team, consisting of Yamaguchi, Harding and Nancy Kerrigan, became the only national ladies team to have its members sweep the Worlds podium until the 2021 World Figure Skating Championships, when Anna Shcherbakova, Elizaveta Tuktamysheva and Alexandra Trusova swept the podium representing FSR.

==== 1991–92 season: Olympic gold and second world title ====
In 1992, Yamaguchi won her first U.S. title and gained a spot to the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. Joining her on the U.S. team were again Kerrigan and Harding. While Harding and Japan&#x27;s Midori Ito were consistently landing the difficult triple Axel jump in competition, Yamaguchi instead focused on her artistry and her triple-triple combinations in hopes of becoming a more well-rounded skater. Both Harding and Ito fell on their triple Axels at the Olympics (though Ito successfully landed the jump later on in her long program after missing the first time), allowing Yamaguchi to win the gold, despite errors in her free program, including putting a hand to the ice on a triple loop and a double salchow instead of a planned triple. She later explained her mindset during the long program: &quot;You just do your best and forget the rest.&quot; Yamaguchi went on to successfully defend her World title that same year.

== Professional skating career ==
Yamaguchi planned to start the 1992-93 competitive season at Prague Skate in Czechoslovakia in November but U.S Figure Skating insisted that all its skaters compete at Skate America, which was due to take place a month earlier in October. Skate America became a source of contention between the federation and Yamaguchi, who was unable to be ready in time due to a busy schedule with commercial appearances and speaking engagements following her wins at the 1992 Winter Olympics and 1992 World Championships. As a result, Yamaguchi decided to turn professional after the 1991–92 competitive season and immediately started competing on the pro competition circuit, starting with the World Professional Figure Skating Championships in December 1992 where she captured her first world pro gold. By the time she stopped competing as a professional, she had become a four-time professional world champion (1992, 1994, 1996 and 1997). She finished second in 1993 behind Midori Ito and in 1995 behind Yuka Sato.

She toured extensively with Stars On Ice for over a decade. Originally, Stars On Ice was a 30-city tour, but when Yamaguchi joined, it quickly became a 60-city tour due to her ability to captivate an audience. She collaborated with a variety of choreographers to create diverse programs. &quot;A lot of us on the Stars on Ice tour took pride in trying to stay innovative and bring something new to the ice every year,&quot; Yamaguchi noted.

== Public life and popular culture ==

=== Sponsorships, endorsements and partnerships ===
In the ensuing months and years after she stood atop the podium in Albertville in 1992, Yamaguchi showed up on cereal boxes like Kellogg&#x27;s Special K, on Hallmark Christmas ornaments, in ads for Got Milk? and Hoechst Celanese, as well as commercials for brands, fast food chains and department store chains like Mervyn&#x27;s, Wendy&#x27;s, DuraSoft and Entenmann&#x27;s doughnuts. She was also featured in ads for Campbell Soup, a sponsor of U.S. Figure Skating at the time. In 2010, Yamaguchi was engaged by P&amp;G to help kick off its &quot;Thanks Mom&quot; program in connection with the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. She also collaborated with OPI and General Electric in 2011 and appeared in a TV spot for department store retail chain Kohl&#x27;s in 2012. In 2018, Yamaguchi worked with the Milk Life Campaign that aims to explain the significance of milk in a well-balanced, nutritious diet. As part of the campaign, Yamaguchi recreated her &quot;Got Milk?&quot; ad from the 1990s and was photographed by Annie Leibowitz.

Mattel unveiled a new Barbie doll based on Yamaguchi in April 2024. The Yamaguchi Barbie doll is dressed in a detailed replication of Yamaguchi&#x27;s gold and black costume from the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville. Yamaguchi has been represented by IMG since 1992.

=== Television ===
Yamaguchi made a public service video with the California Raisins in 1993 called &quot;Hip to be Fit: Starring Kristi Yamaguchi and The California Raisins.&quot; She has appeared as herself on shows like &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond, Fresh Off the Boat,&quot; &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen and Freedom: A History of US&quot; as well as in films like &quot;D2: The Mighty Ducks&quot;, &quot;Frosted Pink&quot;, and the Disney Channel original movie &quot;Go Figure&quot;. In 2006, Yamaguchi was the host of WE tv series &quot;Skating&#x27;s Next Star&quot;, created and produced by Major League Figure Skating. Yamaguchi was a local commentator on figure skating for San Jose TV station KNTV (NBC 11) during the 2006 Winter Olympics. In 2010, Yamaguchi worked as a daily NBC Olympics skating broadcast analyst on NBC&#x27;s Universal Sports Network. During the 2010 Winter Olympics, Yamaguchi was also a special correspondent for the &quot;Today Show&quot;.

She performed in numerous television skating specials, including the Disney special &quot;Aladdin on Ice&quot;, in which she played Princess Jasmine, and in 2016 she hosted the &quot;Colgate Skating Series&quot; on ABC, a show featuring skaters such as Nancy Kerrigan, Paul Wylie, and Todd Eldridge, who performed with their families. In 2023, Yamaguchi made an appearance in Carolyn Taylor&#x27;s documentary comedy series &quot;I Have Nothing&quot; that follows Taylor&#x27;s comical quest to choreograph a pairs skating routine set to Whitney Houston&#x27;s 1993 hit song &quot;I Have Nothing.&quot;

On May 20, 2008, Yamaguchi became the champion of the sixth season of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dancing with the Stars,&quot; where she was paired with Mark Ballas. Yamaguchi became the first female winner since Kelly Monaco in season one. Yamaguchi made a special appearance in the finale of the sixteenth season where she danced alongside Dorothy Hamill, and in November 2017, she returned to &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;&#x27; 25th season in week eight to participate in a jazz trio with Lindsey Stirling and Mark Ballas.

=== Books and magazines ===
Yamaguchi authored five books. She released &quot;Figure Skating for Dummies&quot; in 1997 followed by &quot;Always Dream&quot;, &quot;Pure Gold&quot; in 1998. In 2011, she published her award-winning children&#x27;s book, &quot;Dream Big, Little Pig&quot;, which was No. 2 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list and received the Gelett Burgess Children&#x27;s Book Award. A portion of the proceeds went to the Always Dream Foundation to support early childhood literacy programs. A sequel, &quot;It&#x27;s a Big World Little Pig&quot;, was published March 6, 2012. &quot;Cara&#x27;s Kindness&quot;, which was illustrated by PIxar artist John Lee, was released in 2016.

Throughout the years, Yamaguchi has graced the covers of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, &quot;People&quot;, and other magazines.

=== Fashion ===

In early 2012, Yamaguchi created a woman&#x27;s active wear line focused on function, comfort, and style to empower women to look good and feel good. The lifestyle brand is called Tsu.ya by Kristi Yamaguchi. &quot;[Tsu.ya] is actually my middle name, and it was my grand-mother&#x27;s name [and] a nod to my Japanese heritage. We put the period in there because we thought it would break it up and make it easier to pronounce,&quot; remarked Yamaguchi. Tsu.ya donates a portion of its proceeds to support early childhood literacy through Yamaguchi&#x27;s Always Dream Foundation.

In February 2009, Kristi walked the runway with nineteen other celebrity women at the Heart Truth fashion show that took place during New York Fashion Week to raise awareness about heart disease. The Heart Truth, a national health education program, created and introduced the Red Dress as the national symbol for women and heart disease awareness in 2002, and a selection of the red designer dresses seen on the runway were later auctioned off.

=== Philanthropy and supported causes ===
In 1996, Yamaguchi established the Always Dream Foundation for children. The goal of the foundation is to provide funding for after school programs, computers, back-to-school clothes for underprivileged children, and summer camps for kids with disabilities. Commenting in 2009, she explained her inspiration for the project: &quot;I was inspired by the Make-A-Wish Foundation to make a positive difference in children&#x27;s lives. We&#x27;ve been helping out various children&#x27;s organizations, which is rewarding. Our latest project is a playground designed so that kids of all abilities can play side by side. That&#x27;s our focus now.&quot; In 2011, Yamaguchi worked with the American Lung Association, promoting their &quot;Faces of Influenza&quot; campaign.

Also in 2011, Kristi and the Always Dream Foundation Board decided to narrow the foundation&#x27;s focus to early childhood literacy. This change was inspired by Kristi&#x27;s role as a mother of two young daughters, as well as her new venture as a children&#x27;s book author. In 2012, the foundation forged a partnership with Raising A Reader and the digital children&#x27;s library myON, to create the Always Reading program, which integrated traditional books with e-books and 21st century technology in both the classroom and home environment. Between 2012 and 2018, the Always Reading program served more than 10,000 students and families at 24 Title 1 schools in California, Hawaiʻi, and Arizona.

In 2018, after two years of assessment and evaluation, the Always Dream Foundation worked with an expert team of education advisors to redesign the Always Reading program with the goal of targeting the home environment and supporting family engagement in reading. The Always Reading pilot program was implemented in two classrooms in Oakland, CA.

In 2020, Always Dream dropped the name “Foundation” to reflect their work as a direct service nonprofit and officially became &quot;Kristi Yamaguchi’s Always Dream.&quot; During the COVID-19 pandemic, the non-profit supplied tablets so provided tablets stocked with digital books, as well as internet access through a mobile data plan, to students in need. Yamaguchi was selected as one of the 2023 &quot;CNN Heroes&quot; for her work with the Always Dream Foundation.

== Accolades and impact ==
Figure skating had long been the domain of white Americans and Europeans. Yamaguchi finished ahead of two Japanese skaters at a competition in 1988 but the medal ceremony was delayed while organizers tried to track down a Japanese flag for Yamaguchi, unaware that she was American. Yamaguchi was the first Asian American to win gold at a Winter Olympic Games, paving the way for Asian American skaters that came after her like two-time Olympic medalist Michelle Kwan, two-time Olympic champion Nathan Chen, Olympic gold medalist Karen Chen, and World medalist Alysa Liu. Five of the sixteen athletes on the U.S. team at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing were of Asian descent. Four years earlier at the 2018 Games in PyeongChang, there were seven with ice dance siblings Maia Shibutani and Alex Shibutani.

Yamaguchi has received numerous awards in recognition of her achievements and impact. She was the recipient of the Inspiration Award at the 2008 Asian Excellence Awards. Two days after her Dancing with the Stars champion crowning, she received the 2008 Sonja Henie Award from the Professional Skaters Association. Among her other awards are the Thurman Munson Award, Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation Flo Hyman Award, the Heisman Humanitarian Award, the Great Sports Legends Award as well as the Jesse Owens Olympic Spirit Award. She is also a member of the U.S. Olympic Committee Olympic Hall of Fame, World Skating Hall of Fame, and the US Figure Skating Hall of Fame.

== Politics ==
In 2012, Yamaguchi appeared in a campaign advertisement for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. She endorsed the politician in both of his presidential bids, donating the legal maximum of $2,300 to Romney&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign, and $2,500 to his 2012 presidential campaign. Yamaguchi identifies as a conservative Republican; yet, she stated in 2009 that she appreciated then-president Barack Obama as a &quot;decision-maker&quot;, nonetheless criticizing in the same interview the state of the economy under his leadership.

In April 2024, Yamaguchi attended the state dinner for Japan hosted by Democratic president Joe Biden. Yamaguchi backed Biden during the 2020 presidential election.

== Personal life ==
On July 8, 2000, she married Bret Hedican, a professional ice hockey player she met at the 1992 Winter Olympics when he played for Team USA. After their wedding, Yamaguchi and Hedican resided in Raleigh, North Carolina, where Hedican played for the Carolina Hurricanes NHL team and won the Stanley Cup in 2006. He also played for one year with the Anaheim Ducks. They now live in Alamo in northern California with their two daughters. They also have a summer home on Gull Lake in northern Minnesota.

<text>Krzysztof Eugeniusz Penderecki (; 23 November 1933 – 29 March 2020) was a Polish composer and conductor. His best-known works include &quot;Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima&quot;, Symphony No. 3, his &quot;St Luke Passion&quot;, &quot;Polish Requiem&quot;, &quot;Anaklasis&quot; and &quot;Utrenja&quot;. His &quot;oeuvre&quot; includes five operas, eight symphonies and other orchestral pieces, a variety of instrumental concertos, choral settings of mainly religious texts, as well as chamber and instrumental works.

Born in Dębica, Penderecki studied music at Jagiellonian University and the Academy of Music in Kraków. After graduating from the academy, he became a teacher there and began his career as a composer in 1959 during the Warsaw Autumn festival. His &quot;Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima&quot; for string orchestra and the choral work &quot;St. Luke Passion&quot; have received popular acclaim. His first opera, &quot;The Devils of Loudun&quot;, was not immediately successful. In the mid-1970s, Penderecki became a professor at the Yale School of Music. From the mid-1970s his composition style changed, with his first violin concerto focusing on the semitone and the tritone. His choral work &quot;Polish Requiem&quot; was written in the 1980s and expanded in 1993 and 2005.

Penderecki won many prestigious awards, including the Prix Italia in 1967 and 1968; the Wihuri Sibelius Prize of 1983; four Grammy Awards in 1987, 1998 (twice), and 2017; the Wolf Prize in Arts in 1987; and the University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition in 1992. In 2012, Sean Michaels of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called him &quot;arguably Poland&#x27;s greatest living composer&quot;. In 2020 the composer&#x27;s Alma Mater, the Academy of Music in Kraków, was named after Krzysztof Penderecki.

==Career==

===1933–1958: early years===
Penderecki was born on 23 November 1933 in Dębica, the son of Zofia and Tadeusz Penderecki, a lawyer. His grandfather Michał Penderecki was a native of Tenetnyky village near Rohatyn (now Ukraine) and belonged to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic church. He married Stefania Szylkiewicz of Armenian origin from Stanislau (now Ivano-Frankivsk in Ukraine) and they later moved to Dębica. The rest of the Penderecki family avoided Polonisation and some still live in their ancestral village. Krzysztof met them upon his visits to Ukraine in the 1990s. On his mother&#x27;s side his grandfather, Robert Berger, was a highly talented painter and director of the local bank at the time of Penderecki&#x27;s birth; Robert&#x27;s father Johann, a German Protestant, moved to Dębica from Breslau (now Wrocław) in the mid-19th century. Out of love for his wife, he subsequently converted to Catholicism. 

Krzysztof was the youngest of three siblings; his sister, Barbara, was married to a mining engineer, and his older brother, Janusz, was studying law and medicine at the time of his birth. Tadeusz was a violinist and also played piano.

The Second World War broke out in 1939; Penderecki&#x27;s family moved out of their apartment, for the Ministry of Food was to operate there. After the war, Penderecki began attending grammar school in 1946. He began studying the violin under Stanisław Darłak, Dębica&#x27;s military bandmaster who organized an orchestra for the local music society after the war. Upon graduating from grammar school, Penderecki moved to Kraków in 1951, where he attended Jagiellonian University.

He studied violin with Stanisław Tawroszewicz and music theory with Franciszek Skołyszewski. In 1954, Penderecki entered the Academy of Music in Kraków and, having finished his studies on violin after his first year, focused entirely on composition. Penderecki&#x27;s main teacher there was Artur Malawski, a composer known for his choral and orchestral works, as well as chamber music and songs. After Malawski&#x27;s death in 1957, Penderecki took further lessons with Stanisław Wiechowicz, a composer primarily known for his choral works. At the time, the 1956 overthrow of Stalinism in Poland lifted strict cultural censorship and opened the door to a wave of creativity.

===1958–1962: first compositions===
Upon graduating from the Academy of Music in Kraków in 1958, Penderecki took up a teaching post at the academy. His early works show the influence of Anton Webern and Pierre Boulez (Penderecki was also influenced by Igor Stravinsky). Penderecki&#x27;s international recognition began in 1959 at the Warsaw Autumn with the premieres of the works &quot;Strophen&quot;, &quot;Psalms of David&quot;, and &quot;Emanations&quot;, but the piece that truly brought him to international attention was &quot;Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima&quot; (see threnody and atomic bombing of Hiroshima), written in 1960 for 52 string instruments. In it, he makes use of extended instrumental techniques (for example, playing behind the bridge, bowing on the tailpiece). There are many novel textures in the work, which makes extensive use of tone clusters. He originally titled the work &quot;8&#x27; 37&quot;&quot;, but decided to dedicate it to the victims of Hiroshima.

&quot;Fluorescences&quot; followed a year later; it increases the orchestral density with more wind and brass, and an enormous percussion section of 32 instruments for six players, including a Mexican güiro, typewriters, gongs and other unusual instruments. The piece was composed for the Donaueschingen Festival of contemporary music of 1962, and its performance was regarded as provocative and controversial. Even the score appeared revolutionary; the form of graphic notation that Penderecki had developed rejected the familiar look of notes on a staff, instead representing music as morphing sounds. His intentions at this stage were quite Cagean: &#x27;All I&#x27;m interested in is liberating sound beyond all tradition&#x27;.

Another noteworthy piece of this period is the &quot;Canon&quot; for 52 strings and 2 tapes. This is in a similar style to other pieces in the late 1950s in its use of sound masses, dramatically juxtaposed with traditional means although the use of standard techniques or idioms is often disguised or distorted. Indeed, the Canon brings to mind the choral tradition and indeed the composer has the players sing, albeit with the performance indication of &quot;bocca chiusa&quot; (with closed mouth) at various points; nevertheless, Penderecki uses the 52 &#x27;voices&#x27; of the string orchestra to play in massed glissandi and harmonics at times – this is then recorded by one of the tapes for playback later on in the piece. It was performed at the Warsaw Autumn Festival in 1962 and caused a riot although curiously the rioters were young music students and not older concertgoers.

At the same time, he started composing music for theater and film. The first theater performance with Penderecki&#x27;s music was &quot;Złoty kluczyk&quot; (&quot;Golden Little Key&quot;) by Yekaterina Borysowa directed by Władysław Jarema (premiered on 12 May 1957 in Krakow at the &quot;Groteska&quot; Puppet Theater). In 1959, at the Cartoon Film Studio in Bielsko-Biała, he composed the music for the first animated film, &quot;Bulandra i diabeł&quot; (&quot;Coal Miner Bulandra and Devil&quot;), directed by Jerzy Zitzman and Lechosław Marszałek.

In 1959, he wrote the score for Jan Łomnicki&#x27;s first short fiction film, &quot;Nie ma końca wielkiej wojny&quot; (&quot;There is no End to the Great War&quot;, WFDiF Warszawa). In the following years he created over twenty original musical settings for dramatic and over 40 puppet performances, and composed original music for at least eleven documentary and feature films as well as for twenty-five animated films for adults and children.

===&quot;The St. Luke Passion&quot;===
The large-scale &quot;St. Luke Passion&quot; (1963–66) brought Penderecki further popular acclaim, not least because it was devoutly religious, yet written in an avant-garde musical language, and composed within Communist Eastern Europe. Various different musical styles can be seen in the piece. The experimental textures, such as were employed in the &quot;Threnody&quot;, are balanced by the work&#x27;s Baroque form and the occasional use of more traditional harmonic and melodic writing. Penderecki makes use of serialism in this piece, and one of the tone rows he uses includes the BACH motif, which acts as a bridge between the conventional and more experimental elements. The Stabat Mater section toward the end of the piece concludes on a simple chord of D major, and this gesture is repeated at the very end of the work, which finishes on a triumphant E major chord. These are the only tonal harmonies in the work, and both come as a surprise to the listener; Penderecki&#x27;s use of tonal triads such as these remains a controversial aspect of the work.

Penderecki continued to write sacred music. In the early 1970s he wrote a Dies irae, a Magnificat, and Canticum Canticorum Salomonis (Song of Songs) for chorus and orchestra.

===De Natura Sonoris and other pieces in the 1960s and early 1970s===
Penderecki&#x27;s preoccupation with sound culminated in &quot;De Natura Sonoris I&quot; (1966), which frequently calls upon the orchestra to use non-standard playing techniques to produce original sounds and colours. A sequel, &quot;De Natura Sonoris II&quot;, was composed in 1971: with its more limited orchestra, it incorporates more elements of post-Romanticism than its predecessor. This foreshadowed Penderecki&#x27;s renunciation of the avant-garde in the mid-1970s, although both pieces feature dramatic glissandos, dense clusters, use of harmonics, and unusual instruments (the musical saw features in the second piece).

In 1968 Penderecki received the State Prize 1st class. During the jubilee of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland he received the Commander&#x27;s Cross (1974) and the Knight&#x27;s Cross of Order of Polonia Restituta (1964).

Towards the end of the decade, Penderecki received a commission to write for the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. The result was &quot;Kosmogonia&quot;, a piece of twenty minutes for 3 soloists (soprano, tenor, bass), mixed choir and orchestra. The Los Angeles Philharmonic premiered the piece on 24 October 1970 with Zubin Mehta as conductor and Robert Nagy as tenor. The piece uses texts from ancient writers Sophocles and Ovid in addition to contemporary statements from Soviet and American astronauts to musically explore the idea of the cosmos.

===1970s–2020: later years===

In the mid-1970s, while he was a professor at the Yale School of Music, Penderecki&#x27;s style began to change. The Violin Concerto No. 1 largely leaves behind the dense tone clusters with which he had been associated, and instead focuses on two melodic intervals: the semitone and the tritone. This direction continued with the Symphony No. 2 (1980), which is harmonically and melodically quite straightforward; the symphony is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Christmas Symphony&quot; due to the opening phrase of the Christmas carol &quot;Silent Night&quot; appearing three times during the work.

Penderecki explained this shift by stating that he had come to feel that the experimentation of the avant-garde had gone too far from the expressive, non-formal qualities of Western music: &#x27;The avant-garde gave one an illusion of universalism. The musical world of Stockhausen, Nono, Boulez and Cage was for us, the young – hemmed in by the aesthetics of socialist realism, then the official canon in our country – a liberation...I was quick to realise however, that this novelty, this experimentation, and formal speculation, is more destructive than constructive; I realised the Utopian quality of its Promethean tone&#x27;. Penderecki concluded that he was &#x27;saved from the avant-garde snare of formalism by a return to tradition&#x27;. Penderecki wrote relatively little chamber music. However, compositions for smaller ensembles range in date from the start of his career to the end, reflecting the changes his style of writing has undergone.

In 1975 the Lyric Opera of Chicago asked him to write a work to commemorate the US Bicentennial in 1976; this became the opera &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; Owing to delays to the project, however, it did not see its premiere until 1978. The music continued to illustrate Penderecki&#x27;s move away from avant-garde techniques. It is tonal music, and the composer explained: &quot;This is not music by the angry young man I used to be&quot;.

In 1980, Penderecki was commissioned by Solidarity to compose a piece to accompany the unveiling of a statue at the Gdańsk shipyards to commemorate those killed in anti-government riots there in 1970. Penderecki responded with &quot;Lacrimosa&quot;, which he later expanded into one of the best-known works of his later period, the &quot;Polish Requiem&quot; (1980–84, 1993, 2005). Later, he tended towards more traditionally conceived tonal constructs, as heard in works such as the Cello Concerto No. 2 and the Credo, which received the Grammy Award for best choral performance for the world-premiere recording made by the Oregon Bach Festival, which commissioned the piece. The same year, Penderecki was awarded the Prince of Asturias Prize in Spain, one of the highest honours given in Spain to individuals, entities, organizations or others from around the world who make notable achievements in the sciences, arts, humanities, or public affairs. Invited by Walter Fink, he was the eleventh composer featured in the annual Komponistenporträt of the Rheingau Musik Festival in 2001. He conducted the Credo on the occasion of the 70th birthday of Helmuth Rilling, 29 May 2003. Penderecki received an honorary doctorate from the Seoul National University, Korea, in 2005 and the University of Münster, Germany, in 2006. His notable students include Chester Biscardi and Walter Mays.

In celebration of his 75th birthday, he conducted three of his works at the Rheingau Musik Festival in 2008, among them Ciaccona from the &quot;Polish Requiem&quot;.

In 2010, he worked on an opera based on &quot;Phèdre&quot; by Racine for 2014, which was never realized, and expressed his wish to write a 9th symphony. In 2014, he was engaged in the creation of a choral work to coincide with the Armenian genocide centennial. In 2018, he conducted Credo in Kyiv at the 29th Kyiv Music Fest, marking the centenary of Polish independence.

==Personal life==
Penderecki had three children, firstly a daughter Beata with pianist Barbara Penderecka ( Graca), whom he married in 1954; they later divorced. He then had a son, Łukasz (b. 1966), and daughter, Dominika (b. 1971), with his second wife, Elżbieta Penderecka ( Solecka), whom he married on 19 December 1965. He lived in the Kraków suburb of Wola Justowska. He was also a keen gardener, and established a 16-hectare arboretum near his manor house in Lusławice.

Penderecki died at his home in Kraków, Poland, on 29 March 2020, after a long illness. He was buried at the National Pantheon in Kraków on 29 March 2022.

== Legacy and influence ==

In 1979, a bronze bust by artist Marian Konieczny honouring Penderecki was unveiled in The Gallery of Composers&#x27; Portraits at the Pomeranian Philharmonic in Bydgoszcz. His monument is located on the Celebrity Alley at the Scout Square (&quot;Skwer Harcerski&quot;) in Kielce.

The Led Zeppelin guitarist and founding member Jimmy Page was an admirer of the composer&#x27;s groundbreaking work &quot;Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima&quot; during his teenage years. This would be reflected later by Page&#x27;s use of the violin bow on his guitar.

The composer and Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood cited Penderecki as a major influence. For Radiohead&#x27;s 1997 album &quot;OK Computer&quot;, Greenwood wrote a part for 16 stringed instruments playing quarter tones apart, inspired by Penderecki. Greenwood visited Penderecki in 2012 and wrote a work for strings, &quot;48 Responses to Polymorphia&quot;, which Penderecki conducted in various performances throughout Europe. Penderecki credited Greenwood for introducing his music to a new generation.

==Works==
Penderecki&#x27;s compositions include operas, symphonies, choral works, as well as chamber and instrumental music.

===Film and television scores===
Krzysztof Penderecki composed between 1959 and 1968 original music for at least eleven documentary and feature films as well as for twenty-five animated films for adults and children.

Some of Penderecki&#x27;s music has been adapted for film soundtracks. &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973) features his String Quartet and &quot;Kanon For Orchestra and Tape&quot;; fragments of the Cello Concerto and &quot;The Devils of Loudun&quot;. Writing about &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, the film critic for &quot;The New Republic&quot; wrote that &#x27;even the music is faultless, most of it by Krzysztof Penderecki, who at last is where he belongs&#x27;. Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980) features six pieces of Penderecki&#x27;s music: &quot;Utrenja II: Ewangelia&quot;, &quot;Utrenja II: Kanon Paschy&quot;, &quot;The Awakening of Jacob&quot;, &quot;De Natura Sonoris No. 1&quot;, &quot;De Natura Sonoris No. 2&quot; and &quot;Polymorphia&quot;. David Lynch has used Penderecki&#x27;s music in the soundtracks of the films &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; (1990), &quot;Inland Empire&quot; (2006), and the TV series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (2017). In the film &quot;Fearless&quot; (1993) by Peter Weir, the piece &quot;Polymorphia&quot; was once again used for an intense plane crash scene, seen from the point of view of the passenger played by Jeff Bridges. Penderecki&#x27;s &quot;Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima&quot; was also used during one of the final sequences in the film &quot;Children of Men&quot; (2006). Penderecki composed music for Andrzej Wajda&#x27;s 2007 Academy Award nominated film &quot;Katyń&quot;, while Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Shutter Island&quot; (2010) featured his Symphony No. 3 and &quot;Fluorescences&quot;.

<text>The Krugerrand (; ) is a South African coin, first minted on 3 July 1967 to help market South African gold and produced by Rand Refinery and the South African Mint. The name is a compound of &quot;Paul Kruger&quot;, the former President of the South African Republic (depicted on the obverse), and &quot;rand&quot;, the South African unit of currency. On the reverse side of the Krugerrand is a pronking springbok, South Africa&#x27;s national animal. 

By 1980, the Krugerrand accounted for more than 90% of the global gold coin market and was the number one choice for investors buying gold. However, during the 1980s and 1990s, Krugerrands fell out of favor as some Western countries forbade import of the Krugerrand because of its association with the apartheid government of South Africa.

Although gold Krugerrand coins have no face value, they are considered legal tender in South Africa by the South African Reserve Bank Act (SARBA) of 1989.

In 2017, the Rand Refinery began minting silver versions with the same overall design as the gold coin.

==History==

The Krugerrand was introduced in 1967 as a vehicle for private ownership of gold. It was minted in a copper-gold alloy more durable than pure gold. By 1980, the Krugerrand accounted for 90% of the global gold coin market. That year, South Africa introduced three smaller coins containing of gold.

Economic sanctions against South Africa for its policy of apartheid made the Krugerrand an illegal import in many Western countries during the 1970s and 1980s, with the United States, which had historically been the largest market for the coin, banning imports in 1985: the previous year, over US$600 million of Krugerrands had been marketed in the country.

Most of these sanctions were removed in 1991 after the South African government took steps to end its apartheid policies. The South African government still found creative ways to circumvent the sanctions. 

Over 50 million ounces of gold Krugerrand coins have been sold since production started in 1967.

==Variations and imitations==

During the bull market in gold of the 1970s, the gold Krugerrand quickly became the primary choice for gold investors worldwide. Between 1974 and 1985, it is estimated that 22 million gold Krugerrand coins were imported into the United States alone. This huge success of the Krugerrand encouraged other gold-producing countries to mint and issue gold bullion coins of their own, including the Canadian Gold Maple Leaf in 1979, the Australian Nugget in 1987, the Chinese Gold Panda in 1982, the American Gold Eagle in 1986, and the British Britannia coin in 1987.

==Properties==

The coin is so named because the obverse, designed by Otto Schultz, bears the face of Boer statesman Paul Kruger, four-term president of the old South African Republic. The reverse depicts a springbok, the national animal of South Africa. The image was designed by Coert Steynberg and was previously used on the reverse of the earlier South African five shillings (1947-51 and 1953-59) and 50 Cents (1961-64) coin. The name &quot;South Africa&quot; and the gold content are inscribed in both Afrikaans and English (as can be seen on the pictures of the coin).

The word &quot;Krugerrand&quot; is a registered trademark owned by Rand Refinery Limited, of Germiston.

==Proof Krugerrands==

The South African Mint Company produces limited edition proof Krugerrands intended to be collectors&#x27; items rather than bullion investments. These coins are priced above bullion value, although non-proof Krugerrands also have a premium above gold bullion value. They can be distinguished from the bullion Krugerrands by the number of serrations on the coin&#x27;s edge. Proof coins have 220 edge serrations, while bullion coins have 160.

==50th Anniversary Krugerrands==

2017 marked the 50th year of issuance (1967–2017), and to commemorate the anniversary, the South African Mint produced &quot;Premium Uncirculated&quot; versions in gold (.916 or 22 carats) and, for the first time also in platinum (.999 fine) and silver (.999 fine). The issue limit for these commemorative platinum, gold, and silver coins was 2,017 for platinum, 5,000 for gold, and 1,000,000 for silver. The commemorative issues are distinguished by a &#x27;50&#x27; privy seal mark above the springbok design on the reverse for the platinum and silver issues and to the right of the springbok design on the gold issues. In addition to the &quot;Premium Uncirculated&quot; issue, 15,000 silver &quot;Proof&quot; Krugerrands were also issued, as well as &quot;Proof&quot; Krugerrands in gold and platinum.

==Export control==

The South African Reserve Bank restricts the exportation of Krugerrands by a South African resident to a non-resident to a maximum of R30,000 (about US$2,100 or €1,870 ). Visitors to South Africa can export up to 15 coins by declaring the items to the South African Revenue Service.

==Charitable donations==

In the 21st century, Krugerrands have received media attention in the United States after anonymous donors have left the valuable coin in the Salvation Army&#x27;s annual &quot;Christmas Kettle&quot; donation jars in various cities around the country.

The family was founded by Karađorđe Petrović (1768–1817), the &quot;Veliki Vožd&quot; () of Serbia during the First Serbian uprising of 1804–1813. In the course of the 19th century the relatively short-lived dynasty was supported by the Russian Empire and was opposed to the Austrian-supported House of Obrenović. The two houses subsequently vied for the throne for several generations. 

Following the assassination of the Obrenović King Alexander I of Serbia in 1903, the Serbian Parliament chose Karađorđe&#x27;s grandson, Peter I Karađorđević, then living in exile, to occupy the throne of the Kingdom of Serbia. He was duly crowned as King Peter I, and shortly before the end of World War I in 1918, representatives of the three peoples proclaimed a Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes with Peter I as sovereign. In 1929, the kingdom was renamed Yugoslavia, under Alexander I, the son of Peter I. In November 1945 the family lost their throne when the League of Communists of Yugoslavia seized power during the reign of Peter II.

==Name==
In English, the family name can be anglicized as Karageorgevitch (e.g., as with Prince Bojidar Karageorgevitch and Prince Philip Karageorgevitch) or romanised as Karadjordjevic. Its origin is as a patronym of the sobriquet &quot;Karađorđe&quot;, bestowed upon the family&#x27;s founder, Đorđe Petrović, at the end of the 18th century. 

In 1796, Osman Pazvantoğlu, the renegade governor of the Ottoman Sanjak of Vidin, who had rejected the authority of the Sublime Porte, launched an invasion of the Pashalik of Belgrade, governed by Hadji Mustafa Pasha since 1793. Overwhelmed, Mustafa Pasha formed a Serbian national militia to help stop the incursion. Đorđe Petrović joined the militia and became a &quot;boluk-bashi&quot; (), leading a company of 100 men. After the Serb militias joined the war on Mustafa Pasha&#x27;s side, Pazvantoğlu suffered a string of defeats. He retreated to Vidin, which was subsequently besieged. The war against Pazvantoğlu marked the first time that Petrović had distinguished himself in the eyes of the Ottomans, who bestowed upon him the sobriquet &quot;Black George&quot; (; ), partly because of his dark hair and partly because of his sinister reputation.

==Ancestry==

According to some researchers, Karađorđe&#x27;s paternal ancestors most likely migrated from the Highlands (in what is today Montenegro) to Šumadija during the Second Great Serb Migration in 1737–39 under the leadership of Patriarch Šakabenta, as a result of the Austro-Turkish War (in which Serbs took part). Serbian historiography accepted the theory that Karađorđe&#x27;s ancestors came from Vasojevići.

Some conjecture has arisen about where the family ended up after arriving in Šumadija. According to Radoš Ljušić, Karađorđe&#x27;s ancestors most likely hailed from Vasojevići, but he has said there is no certain historical information on Karađorđe&#x27;s ancestors or where they came from, folklore being the only real source. Most likely, Karađorđe&#x27;s ancestors hailed from Vasojevići. Grigorije Božović (1880–1945) claimed that the family were &quot;Srbljaci&quot; (natives) in Vasojevići territory. Contributing to &quot;Srbljak&quot; theory is the fact that the family celebrated St Clement as their Slava until 1890, while the patron saint of Vasojevići, i.e. Vaso&#x27;s descendants, is Archangel Michael. King Peter I was allowed to change his Slava to St Andrew the First-called by Belgrade Metropolitan Mihailo in 1890, following the death of his wife, Princess Zorka, thus honoring the date on the Julian calendar when Serbian rebels liberated Belgrade during the First Serbian Uprising. 

Furthermore, King Peter chose Voivode of Vasojevići Miljan Vukov Vešović to be his bridesman during his wedding to princess Zorka in 1883. Upon being asked by his future father-in-law prince Nicholas why he chose Miljan amongst various Voivodes of Montenegro, he replied that he chose him because of &quot;heroism and relation&quot; describing him as &quot;Vojvode of my own blood and kin&quot;. His son, Alexander, who was born in Cetinje was nicknamed &quot;Montenegrin&quot;. The Vasojevići tribe claim descent from Stefan Konstantin of the Nemanjić dynasty. The Vasojevići were proud of Karađorđe, and saw him as their kinsman. Montenegrin politician and Vasojević Gavro Vuković, supported this theory. Accordingly, Alexander Karađorđević (1806–1885) was given the title &quot;Voivode of Vasojevići&quot; by Petar II in 1840. Other theories include: Montenegrin historian Miomir Dašić claimed that Karađorđe&#x27;s family originated from the Gurešići from Podgorica in Montenegro. Folklorist Dragutin Vuković believed that Tripko Knežević–Guriš was Karađorđe&#x27;s great-grandfather; Vukićević, writing in 1907, said that in the surroundings of Podgorica, there is a local claim that Karađorđe&#x27;s ancestors initially came from Vranj.

The family claimed descent from the Vasojevići tribe (in Montenegro) and had emigrated in the late 1730s or early 1740s. The family lived in Mačitevo (in Suva Reka), from where grandfather Jovan moved to Viševac, while Jovan&#x27;s brother Radak moved to Mramorac.

==List of monarchs==

==Heads of the House since 1945==
The Karađorđevići are active in Serbian society in various ways. There is a view that constitutional parliamentary monarchy would be the ultimate solution for stability, unity, and continuity in Serbia. In addition, the family supports Serbia as a democratic country with a future in the European Union.

The last crown prince of Yugoslavia, Alexander, has lived in Belgrade at the Dedinje Royal Palace since 2001. As the only son of the last king, Peter II, who never abdicated, and the last official heir of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia he claims to be the rightful heir to the Serbian throne in the event of restoration. At the palace, Alexander regularly receives religious leaders and strives, as opportunity permits, to demonstrate his commitment to human rights and to democracy. The family are also much engaged in humanitarian work. Crown Princess Katherine has a humanitarian foundation while Crown Prince Alexander heads the Foundation for Culture and Education, whose activities include student scholarships, and summer camps for children. 

On 27 April 2022, Prince Peter Karageorgevitch renounced his title of Hereditary prince – for himself and his descendants – and his younger brother Prince Philip became their father&#x27;s heir apparent. The ceremony took place at Casa de Pilatos in Seville, Spain. Present were Peter&#x27;s and Philip&#x27;s mother Princess Maria Da Gloria of Orléans-Braganza, Duchess of Segorbe and their stepfather Ignacio, 19th Duke of Segorbe; Philip&#x27;s wife Princess Danica; their half-sister Sol, Countess of Ampurias; Ljubodrag Grujić, a member of the Crown Council and Chancellor of the Orders and Herald of the House of Karađorđević; and Nikola Stanković, Chief of Staff of the Crown Prince.

==Serbia and Yugoslavia==

The Karađorđević family initially was a Serbian Royal House, then the Royal House of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and then the Royal House of Yugoslavia. When they last reigned they were called the Royal House of Yugoslavia.

Crown Prince Alexander was born in London but on property temporarily recognized by the United Kingdom&#x27;s government as subject to the sovereignty of the Yugoslav crown, on which occasion it was publicly declared that the Crown Prince had been born on the native soil of the land he was expected to eventually rule.

<text>Karl August Böttiger (8 June 1760 – 17 November 1835) was a German archaeologist and classicist, and a prominent member of the literary and artistic circles in Weimar and Jena.

==Biography==
Böttiger was born in Reichenbach, in the kingdom of Saxony, and educated at Schulpforta and Leipzig. Under the influence of Johann Gottfried Herder, he was for 13 years headmaster at the gymnasium and consistorial councillor in Weimar, from 1790 to 1804. For the remaining 31 years of his life, he resided at Dresden as director of the Museum of Antiquities, and was active as a journalist and public lecturer. As a schoolmaster, he had published a considerable number of pedagogic and philological programs. In 1810, Böttiger with Swiss painter Heinrich Meyer released a monograph on the painting in the Vatican known as the &quot;Aldobrandini marriage&quot;. His archaeological works, mainly produced at Dresden, fall into three groups:

The first of these is private antiquities, best represented by his &quot;Sabina, or morning scenes in the dressing room of a wealthy Roman lady&quot; (; 1803, 2 vols.; 2nd edition, 1806), which was translated into French and served as a model for Wilhelm Adolf Becker&#x27;s &quot;Gallus&quot; and &quot;Charicles&quot;. The second, the Greek theatre, which Böttiger had been interested in since his time as a drama critic in Weimar; his unfavorable review of August Wilhelm Schlegel&#x27;s &quot;Ion&quot; was withdrawn at the request of Goethe. It was mainly as a schoolmaster in Weimar that he wrote his papers on the distribution of the parts, on the masks and dresses, and on the machinery of the ancient stage, as well as a dissertation on the masks of the Furies in 1801. Thirdly, he worked in the domain of ancient art and mythology; his work in this area was popular but, according to some 20th-century critics, superficial.

His accomplishments in Dresden led him to be noticed by the court of the Kingdom of Saxony, and he was the Aulic councilor of the kings of Saxony. Böttiger supplied the descriptive letter-press to the 1797 German edition of Tischbein&#x27;s reproductions from William Hamilton&#x27;s second collection of Greek vases, and thus introduced the study of Greek vase-painting into Germany. He published lectures on the history of ancient sculpture in 1806, and painting in 1811, and edited the three volumes of an archaeological periodical called &quot;Amalthea&quot; from 1820 to 1825, which included contributions from the most eminent classical archaeologists of the day.


In 1832 Böttiger was elected a member of the French Institute. He died in Dresden. His pupil, who edited many of Böttiger&#x27;s works after his death, was the German classicist Karl Julius Sillig. There are two medals that were commissioned for him. One on the occasion of his 70th birthday in 1830 and the other after he died.

His son, Karl Wilhelm Böttiger (15 August 1790 – 26 November 1862; not to be confused with the Swedish writer Carl Wilhelm Böttiger), was a historian and biographer of his father. He wrote &quot;Karl August Böttiger. Eine biographische Skizze&quot;, a biographical sketch (Leipzig, 1837). From his father&#x27;s papers, he edited the posthumous work &quot;Litterarische Zustände und Zeitgenossen&quot; (Literary circumstances and contemporaries, 2 vols., Leipzig, 1838). Karl Wilhelm Böttiger contributed the history of Saxony to Heeren and Ukert&#x27;s &quot;Europäische Staatengeschichte&quot;, and his &quot;Allgemeine Geschichte für Schule und Haus&quot; (Universal history for school and home) and &quot;Deutsche Geschichte für Schule und Haus&quot; (German history for school and home) passed through many editions. From 1821 until his death he was professor of history in Erlangen.

<text>Karl Ferdinand Braun ( ; ; 6 June 1850 – 20 April 1918) was a German electrical engineer, physicist, and inventor. Braun contributed significantly to the development of radio with his 2 circuit system, which made long range radio transmissions and modern telecommunications possible, and with his invention of the phased array antenna in 1905, which led to the development of radar, smart antennas, and MIMO. Before that, he built the first cathode-ray tube in 1897, which led to the development of television, and the first semiconductor device in 1874, which led to the development of electronics engineering and the Information Age.

Braun shared the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physics with Guglielmo Marconi &quot;for their contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy&quot;. 

He was a founder of Telefunken, one of the pioneering communications and television companies, and has been called the &quot;father of television&quot; (shared with inventors like Paul Gottlieb Nipkow), the &quot;great grandfather of every semiconductor ever manufactured&quot;, and a co-father of radio telegraphy, together with Marconi, laying the foundation for all modern wireless systems.

==Biography==
Braun was born in Fulda, Germany, and educated at the University of Marburg and received a PhD from the University of Berlin in 1872. In 1874, he discovered in Leipzig while he was working there as a secondary school teacher in the Thomasschule, that a point-contact metal–semiconductor junction rectifies alternating current. He became director of the Physical Institute and professor of physics at the University of Strassburg in 1895.

In 1897, he built the first cathode-ray tube (CRT) and cathode-ray tube oscilloscope. The CRT became the cornerstone in developing fully electronic television, being a part of every TV, computer and any other screen set up till the introduction of the LCD screen at the end of the 20th century. It is still mostly called the &quot;Braun tube&quot; in German-speaking countries () and other countries such as Korea (브라운관: &quot;Buraun-kwan&quot;) and Japan (: &quot;Buraun-kan&quot;).

During the development of radio, he also worked on wireless telegraphy. In 1897, Braun joined the line of wireless pioneers. His major contributions were the introduction of a closed tuned circuit in the generating part of the transmitter, its separation from the radiating part (the antenna) by means of inductive coupling, and later on the usage of crystals for receiving purposes. Around 1898, he invented a crystal detector . Wireless telegraphy claimed Dr. Braun&#x27;s full attention in 1898, and for many years after that he applied himself almost exclusively to the task of solving its problems. Dr. Braun had written extensively on wireless subjects and was well known through his many contributions to the Electrician and other scientific journals. In 1899, he applied for the patent &quot;Wireless electro transmission of signals over surfaces&quot;. Also in 1899, he is said to have applied for a patent on &quot;Electro telegraphy by means of condensers and induction coils&quot;.

Pioneers working on wireless devices eventually came to a limit of distance they could cover. Connecting the antenna directly to the spark gap produced only a heavily damped pulse train. There were only a few cycles before oscillations ceased. Braun&#x27;s circuit afforded a much longer sustained oscillation because the energy encountered less losses swinging between coil and Leyden Jars. And by means of inductive antenna coupling the radiator was better matched to the generator. The resultant stronger and less bandwidth consuming signals bridged a much longer distance.

Braun invented the phased array antenna in 1905. He described in his Nobel Prize lecture how he carefully arranged three antennas to transmit a directional signal. This invention led to the development of radar, smart antennas, and MIMO.

Braun&#x27;s British patent on tuning was used by Marconi in many of his tuning patents. Guglielmo Marconi used Braun&#x27;s patents (among others). Marconi would later admit to Braun himself that he had &quot;borrowed&quot; portions of Braun&#x27;s work. In 1909, Braun shared the Nobel Prize for physics with Marconi for &quot;contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy&quot;. The prize awarded to Braun in 1909 depicts this design. Braun experimented at first at the University of Strasbourg. Not before long he bridged a distance of 42 km to the city of Mutzig. In spring 1899, Braun, accompanied by his colleagues Cantor and Zenneck, went to Cuxhaven to continue their experiments at the North Sea. On 24 September 1900 radio telegraphy signals were exchanged regularly with the island of Heligoland over a distance of 62 km. Light vessels in the river Elbe and a coast station at Cuxhaven commenced a regular radio telegraph service.

Braun went to the United States at the beginning of World War I (before the U.S. had entered the war) to be a witness for the defense in a lawsuit regarding a 
patent claim by the Marconi Corporation against the wireless station of Telefunken at Sayville, New York. After the US entered the war, Braun was detained, but could move freely within Brooklyn, New York. Braun died in his house in Brooklyn, before the war ended in 1918.

==Inventions and theories==

===Semiconductor===
In 1874, Braun discovered the asymmetric conduction properties of certain materials, which became the foundation for the point-contact rectifier. This discovery showed that certain metal-semiconductor junctions could conduct electricity more easily in one direction than the other, a crucial property for diodes.

His work with semiconductors led to the development of the first point-contact diode, often credited as a basic semiconductor device that allowed the rectification of alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC). This is important because it was one of the first real-world applications of semiconducting materials, paving the way for future semiconductor devices that would later evolve into modern diodes, transistors, and other semiconductor technology.

Braun&#x27;s discoveries were instrumental in the early development of electronics and helped lay the groundwork for the semiconductor industry we know today.

===Braun Tube===

The enduring fame of Ferdinand Braun is largely due to his invention of the cathode-ray tube, which is still commonly referred to as the &quot;Braun tube.&quot; Today, the term typically refers to a high-vacuum tube in which an electron beam can be deflected in both horizontal and vertical directions. The first version, developed in Strasbourg in 1897, was far from perfect. It featured a cold cathode and a moderate vacuum, which required a 100,000 V acceleration voltage to produce a visible trace of the magnetically deflected beam. Furthermore, magnetic deflection affected only one direction, while the other was controlled by a rotating mirror placed in front of the phosphorescent screen. However, industry immediately recognized the potential of the invention, leading to its further development. By 1899, Braun&#x27;s assistant Jonathan Zenneck introduced oscillations to magnetically control the Y deflection, and later improvements included the addition of a heated cathode, a Wehnelt cylinder, and high-vacuum technology. This tube was not only used for oscilloscopes but also, for the first time in 1930 by Manfred von Ardenne, became a fundamental component in the first fully electronic television transmission, as a picture tube for television sets, although Braun himself had considered it unsuitable for television.

===Radio Receiver===
Following the invention of his tube, Braun also began researching in the field of wireless telegraphy. A key issue in early radio technology was the development of a reliable receiver. Braun, as a physicist, was accustomed to working under reproducible experimental conditions, which the commonly used coherer receivers at the time failed to meet. He replaced the coherer with a crystal detector, which greatly improved the sensitivity of the receiver, although the crystal detector required frequent re-adjustment. It was only later that the electron tube replaced the crystal detector, although devices like germanium diodes continued to be used in simpler receivers for some time. The first FM radar systems still employed a crystal detector.

In late 1898, the technology was commercialized when the chocolate manufacturer from Cologne, Ludwig Stollwerck, founded a consortium to exploit Braun&#x27;s patents, contributing 560,000 marks in capital. After the successful transmission of signals over longer distances, the consortium was transformed into the &quot;Professor Braun’s Telegraphy Company,&quot; which eventually became Telefunken AG, set up the first world-wide network of communications and was the first in the world to sell electronic televisions with cathode-ray tubes, in Germany in 1934. In 1900, Stollwerck facilitated contact with Professor August Raps, head of the Siemens &amp; Halske Telegraph Construction Company, which later took over the development of the apparatus.

===Radio Transmitter===

Braun also made significant contributions to radio transmission technology. While Guglielmo Marconi had developed his transmitter primarily through empirical methods, Braun was able to improve it by focusing on the underlying physics. Originally, the resonant and antenna circuits were combined, but Braun separated them into two parts: a primary circuit consisting of a capacitor and spark gap, and an antenna circuit inductively coupled to it. This innovation allowed for greater energy transmission in the system.

By 1898, the resulting powerful systems made the term &quot;long-distance telegraphy&quot; more appropriate, as the maximum range, previously limited to 20 km, steadily increased. On 24 September 1900, a radio link was successfully established between Cuxhaven and Helgoland over a distance of 62 km. On 12 December 1901, Marconi received radio signals at his station in Poldhu, Cornwall, at Signal Hill in St. Johns, Newfoundland, using a transmitter designed in Braun&#x27;s circuit. Whether this reception actually occurred remains debated in the literature.

Meanwhile, Braun attempted to replace the spark-gap transmitter, which produced damped oscillations, with AC generators that generated undamped oscillations, though he was unable to implement a feedback loop using electron tubes at the time.

Together with Georg Graf von Arco and Adolf Slaby, Braun was part of the team that developed the concept for &quot;mobile stations for wireless telegraphy for military purposes,&quot; which in 1903 led to a practical implementation by AEG and Siemens &amp; Halske. The system consisted of two horse-drawn wagons: one with all the transmitting and receiving equipment, including a battery, and the other with auxiliary and reserve supplies. This allowed the wagons to be separated in difficult terrain, as the station could still operate with just the front wagon.

=== Antennas ===
Braun also focused on early problems in directional radio—the alignment of transmitting and receiving antennas. He was among the first to achieve directed radiation and optimized antenna performance through calculations.

Braun&#x27;s Electroscope
Braun is also credited with the invention of the pointer electroscope, which was named after him.

<text>Khunjerab Pass (; ; ) is a mountain pass in northern Pakistan that lies at an elevation of above sea level. It is located in the Karakoram and holds a significant strategic position on the northern border of Pakistan, specifically in the Gilgit-Baltistan&#x27;s Hunza and Nagar Districts. Additionally, it is positioned on the southwestern border of China, within the Xinjiang region. 

Near Khunjerab Pass, there is another pass known as , which stands at an elevation of and is located at approximately .

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;خنجراب&quot; in the local Wakhi language means &#x27;waterfall house&#x27;. It is derived from two words, &quot;خون&quot;-&quot;Khun&quot; means house and &quot;جراب&quot;-&quot;Jerab&quot; means a creek coming from a spring or a waterfall.

== Notability ==

The Khunjerab Pass holds several distinctions, including being the highest paved international border crossing globally and serving as the highest point along the Karakoram Highway. The construction of the road across this pass was completed in 1982, and it has since supplanted the previously unpaved Mintaka and Kilik passes as the principal route across the formidable Karakoram Range.

The decision to use the Khunjerab Pass for the Karakoram Highway was made in 1966. China citing the fact that Mintaka would be more susceptible to air strikes, recommended the steeper Khunjerab Pass instead.

On the Pakistani-administered side, the pass is from the National Park station and checkpoint in Dih, from the customs and immigration post in Sost, from Gilgit, and from Islamabad.

On the Chinese side, the pass is the southwest terminus of China National Highway 314 (G314) and is from Tashkurgan, from Kashgar and from Urumqi. The Chinese port of entry is located along the road from the pass in Tashkurgan County.

The long, relatively flat pass is often snow-covered during the winter season and as a consequence is generally closed for heavy vehicles from November 30 to May 1 and for all vehicles from December 30 to April 1. This is not set however, late snowfall in the region attributed to climate-change means the road is accessible even during the winter months. Depending on the amount of snowfall, the road is cleared from time periods ranging from days to weeks.

Since June 1, 2006, there has been a daily bus service across the boundary from Gilgit to Kashgar, Xinjiang.
This is one of the international borders where left-hand traffic (Pakistan-administered Gilgit-Baltistan) changes to right-hand traffic (China) and vice versa.

=== Highest ATM in the world ===
The Pakistani side features the highest ATM in the world, administered by the National Bank of Pakistan and linked to China UnionPay and the domestic 1LINK switch.

== Railway ==
In 2007, consultants were hired to evaluate the construction of a railway through this pass to connect China with transport in Pakistan&#x27;s Gilgit-Baltistan. A feasibility study started in November 2009 for a line connecting Havelian , away Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Kashgar away in Xinjiang. However, no progress has been made thereafter and this project is also not part of the current CPEC plan.

<doc id="17300" wikidata="Q130777" url="?curid=17300" title="Kazimir Malevich">
<text>Kazimir Severinovich Malevich ( – 15 May 1935) was a Russian avant-garde artist and art theorist, whose pioneering work and writing influenced the development of abstract art in the 20th century. He was born in Kiev, modern-day Ukraine, to an ethnic Polish family. His concept of Suprematism sought to develop a form of expression that moved as far as possible from the world of natural forms (objectivity) and subject matter in order to access &quot;the supremacy of pure feeling&quot; and spirituality. Active primarily in Russia, Malevich was a founder of the artists collective UNOVIS and his work has been variously associated with the Russian avant-garde and the Ukrainian avant-garde, and he was a central figure in the history of modern art in Central and Eastern Europe more broadly.

Early on, Malevich worked in a variety of styles, quickly assimilating the movements of Impressionism, Symbolism and Fauvism and, after visiting Paris in 1912, Cubism. Gradually simplifying his style, he developed an approach with key works consisting of pure geometric forms and their relationships to one another, set against minimal grounds. His &quot;Black Square&quot; (1915), a black square on white, represented the most radically abstract painting known to have been created so far and drew &quot;an uncrossable line (…) between old art and new art&quot;; &quot;Suprematist Composition: White on White&quot; (1918), a barely differentiated off-white square superimposed on an off-white ground, would take his ideal of pure abstraction to its logical conclusion. In addition to his paintings, Malevich laid down his theories in writing, such as &quot;From Cubism and Futurism to Suprematism&quot; (1915) and &quot;The Non-Objective World: The Manifesto of Suprematism&quot; (1926).

Malevich&#x27;s trajectory in many ways mirrored the tumult of the decades surrounding the October Revolution in 1917. In its immediate aftermath, vanguard movements such as Suprematism and Vladimir Tatlin&#x27;s Constructivism were encouraged by Trotskyite factions in the government. Malevich held several prominent teaching positions and received a solo show at the Sixteenth State Exhibition in Moscow in 1919. His recognition spread to the West with solo exhibitions in Warsaw and Berlin in 1927. From 1928 to 1930, he taught at the Kiev Art Institute, with Alexander Bogomazov, Victor Palmov, Vladimir Tatlin and published his articles in a Kharkiv magazine &quot;Nova Generatsiia&quot; (New generation). But the start of repression in Ukraine against the intelligentsia forced Malevich return to Leningrad (Saint Petersburg). From the beginning of the 1930s, modern art was falling out of favor with the new government of Joseph Stalin. Malevich soon lost his teaching position, artworks and manuscripts were confiscated, and he was banned from making art. In 1930, he was imprisoned for two months due to suspicions raised by his trip to Poland and Germany. Forced to abandon abstraction, he painted in a representational style in the years before his death from cancer in 1935, at the age of 56.

His art and his writings influenced contemporaries such as El Lissitzky, Lyubov Popova and Alexander Rodchenko, as well as generations of later abstract artists, such as Ad Reinhardt and the Minimalists. He was celebrated posthumously in major exhibits at the Museum of Modern Art (1936), the Guggenheim Museum (1973) and the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam (1989), which has a large collection of his work. In the 1990s, the ownership claims of museums to many Malevich works began to be disputed by his heirs.

==Early life (1879-1904)==

Kazimir Malevich was born in 1879 Kazimierz Malewicz to a Polish family, who settled near Kiev in Kiev Governorate of the Russian Empire during the partitions of Poland. His parents, Ludwika and Seweryn Malewicz, were Roman Catholic like most ethnic Poles, though his father attended Orthodox services as well. His native language was Polish, but he also spoke Russian, as well as Ukrainian due to his childhood surroundings. His mother Ludwika wrote poetry in Polish and sang Polish songs, and kept a record of the Polish families living in the area. Malevich would later write a series of articles in Ukrainian about art, and identified as Ukrainian.

Kazimir&#x27;s father managed a sugar factory. Kazimir was the first of fourteen children, only nine of whom survived into adulthood. His family moved often and he spent most of his childhood in the villages of modern-day Ukraine, amidst sugar-beet plantations, far from centers of culture. Until age twelve, he knew nothing of professional artists, although art had surrounded him in childhood. He delighted in peasant embroidery, and in decorated walls and stoves. He was able to paint in the peasant style. He studied drawing in Kiev from 1895 to 1896. From 1896 to 1904, Kazimir Malevich lived in Kursk, where he encountered several Russian artists, including Lev Kvachevsky, with whom he often worked outdoors.

== Avant-garde and Moscow (1904-1915) ==
In 1904, recognizing his style as increasingly more Impressionistic, he intended to receive more academic training and moved to Moscow. Between 1905 and 1910, he worked in the studio of Fedor Rerberg in Moscow. Malevich and other artists in Moscow gained an early exposure to Western avant-garde art, particularly to the works of Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, through the private collection of Sergei Shchukin. By 1904, as more French art was being reproduced and discussed in Russia in the magazine &quot;Mir iskusstva&quot;, Malevich had also become acquainted with the work of Paul Gauguin.

Symbolism had an impact on Malevich&#x27;s work during that time, as evident in paintings such as &quot;The Triumph of Heaven&quot; (1907) and &quot;The Shroud of Christ&quot; (1908). In 1911, he participated in the second exhibition of the group, &quot;Soyuz Molodyozhi&quot; (Union of Youth) in St. Petersburg, together with Vladimir Tatlin and, in 1912, the group held its third exhibition, which included works by Aleksandra Ekster, Tatlin, and others. In the same year, he participated in an exhibition by the collective, &quot;Donkey&#x27;s Tail&quot; in Moscow. By that time, his works were influenced by Natalia Goncharova and Mikhail Larionov, Russian avant-garde painters, who were particularly interested in Russian folk art called &quot;lubok&quot;. Malevich described himself as painting in a &quot;Cubo-Futurist&quot; style in 1912.

In March 1913, Malevich participated in the &quot;Target&quot; exhibition in Moscow together with Goncharova and Larionov, continuing to reinterpret Futurist vocabularies to &quot;suggest movement by breaking cone shapes into almost unrecognizable forms&quot;. Among other paintings, Malevich exhibited &quot;Morning in the Country after Snowstorm&quot; and &quot;Knifegrinder or Principle of Glittering&quot;, both made in 1912, at &quot;Target&quot; for the first time. That same year, the Cubo-Futurist opera, &quot;Victory Over the Sun&quot;, with Malevich&#x27;s stage-set, debuts in Saint Petersburg. In 1914, Malevich exhibited his works in the &quot;Salon des Indépendants&quot; in Paris together with Alexander Archipenko, Sonia Delaunay, Aleksandra Ekster, and Vadim Meller, among others.

Malevich also co-illustrated, with Pavel Filonov, &quot;Selected Poems with Postscript, 1907–1914&quot; by Velimir Khlebnikov and another work by Khlebnikov in 1914 titled &quot;Roar! Gauntlets, 1908–1914&quot;, with Vladimir Burliuk. Later in that same year, he created a series of lithographs in support of Russia&#x27;s entry into WWI. These prints, accompanied by captions by Vladimir Mayakovsky and published by the Moscow-based publication house Segodniashnii Lubok (Contemporary Lubok), on the one hand show the influence of traditional folk art, but on the other are characterised by solid blocks of pure colours juxtaposed in compositionally evocative ways that anticipate his Suprematist work.

In 1911, Brocard &amp; Co. produced an eau de cologne called &quot;Severny&quot;. Malevich conceived the advertisement and design of the perfume bottle with craquelure of an iceberg and a polar bear on the top, which lasted through the mid-1920s.

==Suprematism (1915)==
In 1915, Malevich laid down the foundations of Suprematism when he published his manifesto, &quot;From Cubism to Suprematism&quot;. In 1915–1916, he worked with other Suprematist artists in a peasant/artisan co-operative in Skoptsi and Verbovka village. In 1916–1917, he participated in exhibitions of the Jack of Diamonds group in Moscow together with Nathan Altman, David Burliuk, Aleksandra Ekster and others. Famous examples of his Suprematist works include &quot;Black Square&quot; (1915) and &quot;White On White&quot; (1918).

Malevich exhibited his first &quot;Black Square&quot;, now at the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, at the Last Futurist Exhibition 0,10 in Petrograd (Saint Petersburg) in 1915. A black square placed against the sun appeared for the first time in the 1913 scenic designs for the Futurist opera &quot;Victory over the Sun&quot;. The second &quot;Black Square&quot; was painted around 1923. Some believe that the third &quot;Black Square&quot; (also at the Tretyakov Gallery) was painted in 1929 for Malevich&#x27;s solo exhibition, because of the poor condition of the 1915 square. One more &quot;Black Square&quot;, the smallest and probably the last, may have been intended as a diptych together with the &quot;Red Square&quot; (though of smaller size) for the exhibition Artists of the RSFSR: 15 Years, held in Leningrad (1932). The two squares, Black and Red, were the centerpiece of the show. This last square, despite the author&#x27;s note &quot;1913&quot; on the reverse, is believed to have been created in the late twenties or early thirties, for there are no earlier mentions of it.

While Malevich&#x27;s ideas and theories behind Suprematism were grounded in a belief in the spiritual and transformative power of art, he saw Suprematism as a way to access a higher, more pure realm of artistic expression and to tap into the spiritual through abstraction. Thus, the overarching philosophy of Suprematism expressed in various manifestos would be that he &quot;transformed himself in the zero of form and dragged himself out of the rubbish-heap of illusion and the pit of naturalism. He destroyed the ring of the horizon and escaped from the circle of objects, moving from the horizon-ring to the circle of spirit&quot;.

Malevich&#x27;s student Anna Leporskaya observed that Malevich &quot;neither knew nor understood what the black square contained. He thought it so important an event in his creation that for a whole week he was unable to eat, drink or sleep&quot;. In 1918, Malevich decorated a play, &quot;Mystery-Bouffe&quot;, by Vladimir Mayakovskiy produced by Vsevolod Meyerhold. He was interested in aerial photography and aviation, which led him to abstractions inspired by or derived from aerial landscapes.

=== Painting technique ===
According to an observation by radiologist and art historian Milda Victurina, one of the features of Kazimir Malevich&#x27;s painting technique was the layering of paints one on another to get a special kind of colour spots. For example, Malevich used two layers of colour for the red spot—the lower black and the upper red. The light ray going through these colour layers is perceived by the viewer not as red, but with a touch of darkness. This technique of superimposing the two colours allowed experts to identify fakes of Malevich&#x27;s work, which generally lacked it.

==Post-revolutionary years (1918-1935)==

After the October Revolution (1917), Malevich became a member of the Collegium on the Arts of Narkompros, the Commission for the Protection of Monuments and the Museums Commission (all from 1918–1919). He taught at the Vitebsk Practical Art School in Belarus (1919–1922) alongside Marc Chagall, the Leningrad Academy of Arts (1922–1927), the Kiev Art Institute (1928–1930), and the House of the Arts in Leningrad (1930). He wrote the book &quot;The World as Non-Objectivity&quot;, which was published in Munich in 1926 and translated into English in 1959. In it, he outlines his Suprematist theories.

In 1923, Malevich was appointed director of Petrograd State Institute of Artistic Culture, which was forced to close in 1926 after a Communist party newspaper called it &quot;a government-supported monastery&quot; rife with &quot;counterrevolutionary sermonizing and artistic debauchery.&quot; The Soviet state was by then heavily promoting an idealized, propagandistic style of art called Socialist Realism—a style Malevich had spent his entire career repudiating. Nevertheless, he swam with the current, and was quietly tolerated by the Communists.

In 1927, Malevich traveled to Warsaw where he exhibited his work at the Polish Arts Club housed in the Polonia Hotel. He met with several Polish artists, including his former students Władysław Strzemiński and Katarzyna Kobro, whose own movement, Unism, was highly influenced by Malevich, and Henryk Stażewski, a prominent artist associated with Polish Constructivist movement. While generally greeted with enthusiasm, Malevich faced criticism from some artists, including Mieczysław Szczuka, who argued that Suprematism, as understood by Malevich, was no longer relevant for Polish utilitarianism-oriented avant-garde and that the artist was &quot;a Romantic who loves painterly means for their own sake&quot;. Art historian Matthew Drutt notes that despite these criticisms, Malevich&#x27;s Warsaw exhibition and the lecture on Suprematism he had delivered during his visit had a lasting effect on Polish modernism. From there, the painter ventured on to Berlin and Munich for a retrospective which finally brought him international recognition. He arranged to leave most of the paintings behind when he returned to the Soviet Union.

=== Stalinism and censorship ===
Malevich&#x27;s assumption that a shifting in the attitudes of the Soviet authorities toward the modernist art movement would take place after the death of Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky&#x27;s fall from power was proven correct in a couple of years, when the government of Joseph Stalin turned against forms of abstraction, considering them a type of &quot;bourgeois&quot; art, that could not express social realities. As a consequence, many of his works were confiscated and he was banned from creating and exhibiting similar art.

In autumn 1930, he was arrested and interrogated by the OGPU in Leningrad, accused of Polish espionage, and threatened with execution. He was released from imprisonment in early December. Critics derided Malevich&#x27;s art as a negation of everything good and pure: love of life and love of nature. The Westernizer artist and art historian Alexandre Benois was one such critic. Malevich responded that art can advance and develop for art&#x27;s sake alone, saying that &quot;art does not need us, and it never did&quot;.

=== Death ===

When Malevich died of cancer at the age of fifty-seven, in Leningrad on 15 May 1935, his friends and disciples buried his ashes in a grave marked with a black square. They didn&#x27;t fulfill his stated wish to have the grave topped with an &quot;architekton&quot;—one of his skyscraper-like maquettes of abstract forms, equipped with a telescope through which visitors were to gaze at Jupiter.

On his deathbed, Malevich had been exhibited with the &quot;Black Square&quot; above him, and mourners at his funeral rally were permitted to wave a banner bearing a black square. Malevich had asked to be buried under an oak tree on the outskirts of Nemchinovka, a place to which he felt a special bond. His ashes were sent to Nemchinovka, and buried in a field near his dacha. Nikolai Suetin, a friend of Malevich&#x27;s and a fellow artist, designed a white cube with a black square to mark the burial site. The memorial was destroyed during World War II. The city of Leningrad bestowed a pension on Malevich&#x27;s mother and daughter.

In Nazi Germany his works were banned as &quot;Degenerate Art&quot;. In 2013, an apartment block was built on the place of the tomb and burial site of Kazimir Malevich. Another nearby monument to Malevich, put up in 1988, is now also situated on the grounds of a gated community.

==Nationality and ethnicity==

Most academic literature and museum collections identify Malevich as a Russian painter, based on his integral role in shaping the Russian avant-garde, centered primarily around Moscow and Petrograd (modern-day St. Petersburg), and the fact that he achieved prominence while living and working in the Russian Empire and later, from 1922 until his death in 1935, the Soviet Union. However, his nationality has been a subject of scholarly dispute.

=== Polish ===
Malevich&#x27;s family was one of the millions of Poles who lived within the Russian Empire following the Partitions of Poland. Kazimir Malevich was born near Kiev on lands that had previously been part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth of parents who were ethnic Poles. Both Polish and Russian were native languages of Malevich, who would sign his artwork in the Polish form of his name as &quot;Kazimierz Malewicz&quot;. In a 1926 visa application to travel to France, Malewicz claimed &quot;Polish&quot; as his nationality. French art historian Andrei Nakov, who re-established Malevich&#x27;s birth year as 1879 (and not 1878), has argued for restoration of the Polish spelling of Malevich&#x27;s name.In 1985, Polish performance artist Zbigniew Warpechowski performed &quot;Citizenship for a Pure Feeling of Kazimierz Malewicz&quot; as an homage to the great artist and critique of Polish authorities that refused to grant Polish citizenship to Kazimir Malevich. In 2013, Malevich&#x27;s family in New York City and fans founded the not-for-profit &quot;The Rectangular Circle of Friends of Kazimierz Malewicz&quot;, whose dedicated goal is to promote awareness of Kazimir&#x27;s Polish ethnicity.

=== Ukrainian ===
According to Russian scholars Tatiana Mikhienko and , the secret police file from Malevich&#x27;s arrest on September 20, 1930 indicates that Malevich declared his nationality as Ukrainian. Scholar Marie Gasper-Hulvat notes that this may have been in part motivated by Malevich&#x27;s desire to avoid anti-Polish discrimination, since Ukraine was at that time part of the Soviet Union. It is sometimes claimed that he self-identified as a Ukrainian throughout his life. Similarly, the French art historian Gilles Néret claimed that Malevich, while at times identifying as Polish &quot;out of tact or mischief&quot; and using the Polish spelling of his name, always emphasized his Ukrainian background.

Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 there has been more political and cultural pressure to reconsider his Russian nationality and to identify him instead as Ukrainian painter. This push resulted in the Metropolitan Museum of Art relabeling him as Ukrainian painter, and later Stedelijk Museum labeling him as &quot;Ukrainian painter of Polish origin&quot;. The relabeling caused a backlash from Russia, including a statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, the consensus among art historians, including those of Ukrainian origin, is that whereas the discussion (related to the Russian colonialism) clearly needs to take place among all involved parties, it has not yet occurred, and the question concerning the identity of Malevich has not been solved as of 2023.

==Legacy==

Alfred H. Barr Jr. included several paintings in the groundbreaking exhibition &quot;Cubism and Abstract Art&quot; at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1936. In 1939, the Museum of Non-Objective Painting opened in New York, whose founder, Solomon R. Guggenheim—an early and passionate collector of the Russian avant-garde—was inspired by the same aesthetic ideals and spiritual quest that exemplified Malevich&#x27;s art.

The first U.S. retrospective of Malevich&#x27;s work in 1973 at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum provoked a flood of interest and further intensified his impact on postwar American and European artists. However, most of Malevich&#x27;s work and the story of the Russian avant-garde remained under lock and key until Glasnost. In 1989, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam held the West&#x27;s first large-scale Malevich retrospective, including the paintings they owned and works from the collection of Russian art critic Nikolai Khardzhiev.

=== Collections ===
Malevich&#x27;s works are held in several major art museums, including the State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, and in New York, the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim Museum. The Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam owns 24 Malevich paintings, more than any other museum outside of Russia. Another major collection of Malevich works is held by the State Museum of Contemporary Art in Thessaloniki.

=== Art market ===

&quot;Black Square&quot;, the fourth version of his magnum opus painted in the 1920s, was discovered in 1993 in Samara and purchased by Inkombank for US$250,000. In April 2002, the painting was auctioned for an equivalent of US$1 million. The purchase was financed by the Russian philanthropist Vladimir Potanin, who donated funds to the Russian Ministry of Culture, and ultimately, to the State Hermitage Museum collection. According to the Hermitage website, this was the largest private contribution to state art museums since the October Revolution.

In 2008, the Stedelijk Museum restituted five works to the heirs of Malevich&#x27;s family from a group that had been left in Berlin by Malevich, and acquired by the gallery in 1958, in exchange for undisputed title to the remaining pictures. On 3 November 2008, one of these works entitled &quot;Suprematist Composition&quot; from 1916, set the world record for any Russian work of art and any work sold at auction for that year, selling at Sotheby&#x27;s in New York City for just over US$60 million (surpassing his previous record of US$17 million set in 2000).

In May 2018, the same painting &quot;Suprematist Composition&quot; 1916 sold at Christie&#x27;s New York for over US$85 million (including fees), a record auction price for a Russian work of art.

=== In popular culture ===
Malevich&#x27;s life inspires many references featuring events and the paintings as players. The smuggling of Malevich paintings out of Russia is a key to the plot line of writer Martin Cruz Smith&#x27;s thriller &quot;Red Square&quot;. Noah Charney&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Art Thief&quot; tells the story of two stolen Malevich &quot;White on White&quot; paintings, and discusses the implications of Malevich&#x27;s radical Suprematist compositions on the art world. British artist Keith Coventry has used Malevich&#x27;s paintings to make comments on modernism, in particular his Estate Paintings. Malevich&#x27;s work also is featured prominently in the Lars von Trier film, &quot;Melancholia&quot;. At the Closing Ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Malevich visual themes were featured (via projections) in a section on 20th century Russian modern art.

=== Autobiographies ===
Malevich wrote two biographical essays, a shorter one in 1923–25, and a much longer account in 1933, representing the artist&#x27;s explanation of his own evolution up to the appearance of suprematism at the 1915 &quot;0–10&quot; exhibition in Petrograd.
Both are published in:

<doc id="17302" wikidata="Q315579" url="?curid=17302" title="Toshiki Kaifu">
<text>was a Japanese politician who served as prime minister of Japan from 1989 to 1991.

Born in Nagoya, Kaifu graduated from Waseda University and was first elected to the Diet in 1960 as a member of the Liberal Democratic Party. He served as education minister from 1976 to 1977 under Takeo Fukuda, and from 1985 to 1986 under Yasuhiro Nakasone. In 1989, Kaifu became prime minister after the resignations of the last two premiers, Noboru Takeshita and Sosuke Uno, amid various scandals; he was chosen in part because of his clean image. During his tenure, Kaifu worked to improve relations with China and made large financial contributions to the coalition in the Persian Gulf War. After his attempts at political reform were unsuccessful, Kaifu resigned as prime minister in 1991 and was replaced by Kiichi Miyazawa.

== Early life and education ==
Kaifu was born on 2 January 1931, in Nagoya City, the eldest of six brothers. His family&#x27;s business Nakamura Photo Studio was established by his grandfather in the Meiji era, and was situated next to the Matsuzakaya flagship department store.

Kaifu took the exam to the Aichi Prefectural Asahigaoka Senior High School, and while of the eleven students who took the test from the same school, nine were accepted and two, including Kaifu, were not. As part of the student labor mobilization during the war, he was placed in a Mitsui Heavy Industry factory where he assembled airplane engine parts day and night. In 1945, he was accepted in the Youth Airman Academy of the Imperial Japanese Army, but the war ended before his planned enrolment in October. He was then educated at Chuo University and Waseda University.

== Career ==

A member of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Kaifu ran successfully for the 1960 Japanese general election and took office as the youngest member of the National Diet. He served for sixteen terms, totaling 48 years.

Kaifu was education minister before rising to lead the party after the resignations of Takeshita Noboru and Sōsuke Uno. Facing Yoshiro Hayashi and Shintaro Ishihara, Kaifu was elected on the platform of clean leadership. He became the 76th Prime Minister of Japan in August 1989.

On 10 August 1991, Kaifu became the first leader of a major country to make an official visit to China and break China&#x27;s diplomatic isolation after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. Kaifu ended Japan&#x27;s participation in economic sanctions against China and offered $949.9 million in loans and an additional $1.5 million in emergency aid following flood damage in southern China in June and July. In 1991 he sent the Maritime Self-Defense Force to the Persian Gulf in the wake of the Gulf War.

Throughout his two Cabinets, Kaifu&#x27;s faction was too small to push through the reforms he sought, and the continuing repercussions of the Sagawa Express scandal caused problems. He resigned in November 1991 and was replaced by Kiichi Miyazawa.

In 1994, he left the LDP to become head of the newly-founded New Frontier Party. He was then nominated by Ichirō Ozawa and Tsutomu Hata as prime minister in June 1994 against the LDP-Socialist coalition candidate Tomiichi Murayama but lost in the Diet vote. He supported Ozawa&#x27;s party until he returned to LDP in 2003. He was defeated in the election of 2009 by DPJ candidate Mitsunori Okamoto, which witnessed the end of almost uninterrupted LDP dominance since 1955. At the time of his defeat, he was the longest-serving member of the lower house of the Diet, and he was also the first former prime minister to be defeated at a re-election since 1963.

== Personal life ==
On 17 November 1957, Kaifu married Sachiyo Yanagihara, a female assistant to Member of the House of Representatives. The couple had a son, , and a daughter, Mutsumi.

== Death ==
Kaifu died of pneumonia at a Tokyo hospital on 9 January 2022, at the age of 91. The announcement of his death to the media was delayed until 14 January.
