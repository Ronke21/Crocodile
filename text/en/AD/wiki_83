<text>Liberal arts education () is a traditional academic course in Western higher education. &quot;Liberal arts&quot; takes the term &quot;art&quot; in the sense of a learned skill rather than specifically the fine arts. &quot;Liberal arts education&quot; can refer to studies in a liberal arts degree course or to a university education more generally. Such a course of study contrasts with those that are principally vocational, professional, or technical, as well as religiously based courses.

The term &quot;liberal arts&quot; for an educational curriculum dates back to classical antiquity in the West, but has changed its meaning considerably, mostly expanding it. The seven subjects in the ancient and medieval meaning came to be divided into the trivium of rhetoric, grammar, and logic, and the quadrivium of astronomy, arithmetic, geometry, and music. Since the late 1990s, major universities have gradually dropped the term &quot;liberal arts&quot; from their curriculum or created schools for liberal art disciplines to categorize programs outside of science and technology. Common rebrandings for liberal arts colleges and schools include: &quot;arts and social sciences&quot;, &quot;arts and sciences&quot; and &quot;humanities&quot;. The name changing at American institutions comes as the result of modern statistics suggesting a &quot;Liberal Arts&quot; degree offers graduates a considerably lower income when compared to science and technology graduates. Despite the rebranding, liberal arts degrees from today&#x27;s universities and colleges traditionally include the following disciplines: Anthropology, English, Literature, Fine arts, Foreign languages, Philosophy, Psychology, Sociology, Music, Journalism, Economics, Law, Communications, Architecture, Creative arts, Art, and History. Degrees in Liberal studies are often confused with those in a liberal arts discipline. Liberal studies refers to degrees with a broad curriculum, across multiple liberal arts disciplines or sciences and technologies. 
==History==
Before they became known by their Latin variations (, , ), the liberal arts were the continuation of Ancient Greek methods of inquiry that began with a &quot;desire for a universal understanding.&quot; Pythagoras argued that there was a mathematical (and geometric) harmony to the cosmos or the universe; his followers linked the four arts of astronomy, arithmetic, geometry, and music into one area of study to form the &quot;disciplines of the mediaeval quadrivium&quot;. In the 4th-century-BC Athens, the government of the polis, or city-state, respected the ability of rhetoric or public speaking above almost everything else. Eventually rhetoric, grammar, and dialectic (logic) became the educational programme of the trivium. Together they came to be known as the seven liberal arts. Originally these subjects or skills were held by classical antiquity to be essential for a free person (, &quot;worthy of a free person&quot;) to acquire in order to take an active part in civic life, something that included among other things participating in public debate, defending oneself in court, serving on juries, and participating in military service. While the arts of the quadrivium might have appeared prior to the arts of the trivium, by the Middle Ages educational programmes taught the trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) first while the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy) were the following stage of education.
Rooted in the basic curriculum – the or &quot;well-rounded education&quot; – of late Classical and Hellenistic Greece, the &quot;liberal arts&quot; or &quot;liberal pursuits&quot; (Latin ) were already called so in formal education during the Roman Empire. The first recorded use of the term &quot;liberal arts&quot; () occurs in by Marcus Tullius Cicero, but it is unclear if he created the term. Seneca the Younger discusses liberal arts in education from a critical Stoic point of view in &quot;Moral Epistles&quot;. The exact classification of the liberal arts varied however in Roman times, and it was only after Martianus Capella in the 5th century influentially brought the seven liberal arts as bridesmaids to the &quot;Marriage of Mercury and Philology&quot;, that they took on canonical form.

The four &quot;scientific&quot; – music, arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy – were known from the time of Boethius onwards as the &quot;quadrivium&quot;. After the 9th century, the remaining three arts of the &quot;humanities&quot; – grammar, logic, and rhetoric – were grouped as the &quot;trivium&quot;. It was in that two-fold form that the seven liberal arts were studied in the medieval Western university. During the Middle Ages, logic gradually came to take predominance over the other parts of the &quot;trivium&quot;.

In the 12th century the iconic image – (Philosophy and seven liberal arts) &quot;–&quot; was produced by an Alsatian nun and abbess Herrad of Landsberg with her community of women as part of the . Their encyclopedia compiled ideas drawn from philosophy, theology, literature, music, arts, and sciences and was intended as a teaching tool for women of the abbey. The image &quot;Philosophy and seven liberal arts&quot; represents the circle of philosophy, and is presented as a rosette of a cathedral: a central circle and a series of semicircles arranged all around. It shows learning and knowledge organised into seven relations, the or Seven Liberal Arts. Each of these arts find their source in the Greek φιλοσοφία, philosophia, literally &quot;love of wisdom&quot;. St. Albert the Great, a doctor of the Catholic Church, asserted that the seven liberal arts were referred to in Sacred Scripture, saying: &quot;It is written, &#x27;Wisdom hath built herself a house, she hath hewn her out seven pillars&#x27; (Proverbs 9:1). This house is the Blessed Virgin; the seven pillars are the seven liberal arts.&quot; 

In the Renaissance, the Italian humanists and their Northern counterparts, despite in many respects continuing the traditions of the Middle Ages, reversed that process. Re-christening the old trivium with a new and more ambitious name: , and also increasing its scope, they downplayed logic as opposed to the traditional Latin grammar and rhetoric, and added to them history, Greek, and moral philosophy (ethics), with a new emphasis on poetry as well. The educational curriculum of humanism spread throughout Europe during the sixteenth century and became the educational foundation for the schooling of European elites, the functionaries of political administration, the clergy of the various legally recognized churches, and the learned professions of law and medicine. The ideal of a liberal arts, or humanistic education grounded in classical languages and literature, persisted in Europe until the middle of the twentieth century; in the United States, it had come under increasingly successful attack in the late 19th century by academics interested in reshaping American higher education around the natural and social sciences.

Similarly, Wilhelm von Humboldt&#x27;s educational model in Prussia (now Germany), which later became the role model for higher education also in North America, went beyond vocational training. In a letter to the Prussian king, he wrote:

The philosopher Julian Nida-Rümelin has criticized discrepancies between Humboldt&#x27;s ideals and the contemporary European education policy, which narrowly understands education as a preparation for the labor market, arguing that we need to decide between &quot;McKinsey and Humboldt&quot;.

==Modern usage==

The modern use of the term liberal arts consists of four areas: the natural sciences, social sciences, arts, and humanities. Academic areas that are associated with the term liberal arts include:
*Life science (biology, neuroscience)
*Physical science (physics, astronomy, physical geography, chemistry, earth science)
*Formal science (logic, mathematics, statistics)
*Humanities (philosophy, history, english literature, the arts)
*Social science (economics, political science, human geography, linguistics, anthropology, psychology, sociology)

For example, the core courses for Georgetown University&#x27;s Doctor of Liberal Studies program cover philosophy, theology, history, art, literature, and the social sciences. Wesleyan University&#x27;s Master of Arts in Liberal Studies program includes courses in visual arts, art history, creative and professional writing, literature, history, mathematics, film, government, education, biology, psychology, and astronomy.

==Secondary school==
Liberal arts education at the secondary school level prepares students for higher education at a university.

Curricula differ from school to school, but generally include language, chemistry, biology, geography, art, mathematics, music, history, philosophy, civics, social sciences, and foreign languages.

==In the United States==


In the United States, liberal arts colleges are schools emphasizing undergraduate study in the liberal arts. The teaching at liberal arts colleges is often Socratic, typically with small classes; professors are often allowed to concentrate more on their teaching responsibilities than are professors at research universities.

In addition, most four-year colleges are not devoted exclusively or primarily to liberal arts degrees, and offer STEM programs. In fact, STEM graduates at liberal arts colleges have been demonstrated to be more likely to apply to graduate school in STEM than their peers and make up a higher proportion of National Academy of Science members than would usually be expected for the number of STEM graduates produced by an institution. 

Traditionally, a bachelor&#x27;s degree in one particular area within liberal arts, with substantial study outside that main area, is earned over four years of full-time study. However, some universities such as Saint Leo University, Pennsylvania State University, Florida Institute of Technology, and New England College have begun to offer an associate degree in liberal arts. Colleges like the Thomas More College of Liberal Arts offer a unique program with only one degree offering, a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies, while the Harvard Extension School offers both a Bachelor of Liberal Arts and a Master of Liberal Arts. Additionally, colleges like the University of Oklahoma College of Liberal Studies and the Harvard Extension School offer an online, part-time option for adult and nontraditional students.

Most students earn either a Bachelor of Arts degree or a Bachelor of Science degree.

=== Great Books movement ===
In 1937 St. John&#x27;s College radically shifted its curriculum to focus on the &quot;Great Books of the Western World,&quot; aiming to provide a form of liberal arts education that stood apart from increasingly specialized nature of higher education. This new approach emphasized a broad-based education rooted in classical texts from philosophy, literature, science, and other disciplines, in contrast to the growing trend toward technical and vocational training in universities.

In 1952, &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; published a 54 volume set titled the &quot;Great Books of the Western World&quot; under the direction of Robert Hutchins and Mortimer Adler. This monumental work was designed to serve as a comprehensive anthology of the foundational texts of Western civilization, spanning authors from Homer and Plato to Shakespeare and Newton. The collection aimed to promote critical thinking and engagement with the ideas that have shaped Western thought. In 1990, a second edition was released, expanding the collection to 60 volumes and updating its content to reflect more contemporary works and scholarship. 

In recent years, there has been a revival of interest in the Great Books and the broader Liberal Arts tradition within some contemporary Muslim educational institutions. Notably, neo-traditional Muslim scholars like Shaykh Hamza Yusuf and Shaykh Abdal Hakim Murad (also known as Tim Winter) have advocated for incorporating the study of these classical works into the curriculum. These scholars emphasize that Muslims historically engaged deeply with the classical liberal arts, particularly the trivium (grammar, rhetoric, and logic) and quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy), both of which are foundational to the Western liberal arts tradition.

Institutions like Zaytuna College in the United States and the Cambridge Muslim College in the United Kingdom have integrated elements of the Great Books and the liberal arts into their educational models, fostering a greater appreciation for the interconnectedness of intellectual traditions across cultures. These colleges encourage students to study classical Islamic texts alongside Western works, fostering a holistic education that draws on both Islamic and Western intellectual heritage. The engagement with the trivium and quadrivium in these institutions highlights the enduring value of liberal arts education, not only in Western contexts but also within broader, more global educational traditions.

==In Europe==

In most parts of Europe, liberal arts education is deeply rooted. In Germany, Austria and countries influenced by their education system it is called &#x27;&quot;humanistische Bildung&quot;&#x27; (humanistic education). The term is not to be confused with some modern educational concepts that use a similar wording. Educational institutions that see themselves in that tradition are often a &quot;Gymnasium&quot; (high school, grammar school). They aim at providing their pupils with comprehensive education (&quot;Bildung&quot;) to form personality with regard to a pupil&#x27;s own humanity as well as their innate intellectual skills. Going back to the long tradition of the liberal arts in Europe, education in the above sense was freed from scholastic thinking and re-shaped by the theorists of the Enlightenment; in particular, Wilhelm von Humboldt. Since students are considered to have received a comprehensive liberal arts education at &quot;gymnasia&quot;, very often the role of liberal arts education in undergraduate programs at universities is reduced compared to the US educational system. Students are expected to use their skills received at the &quot;gymnasium&quot; to further develop their personality in their own responsibility, e.g. in universities&#x27; music clubs, theatre groups, language clubs, etc. Universities encourage students to do so and offer respective opportunities but do not make such activities part of the university&#x27;s curriculum.

Thus, on the level of higher education, despite the European origin of the liberal arts college, the term &quot;liberal arts college&quot; usually denotes liberal arts colleges in the United States. With the exception of pioneering institutions such as Franklin University Switzerland (formerly known as Franklin College), established as a Europe-based, US-style liberal arts college in 1969, only recently some efforts have been undertaken to systematically &quot;re-import&quot; liberal arts education to continental Europe, as with Leiden University College The Hague, University College Utrecht, University College Maastricht, Amsterdam University College, Roosevelt Academy (now University College Roosevelt), University College Twente (ATLAS), Erasmus University College, the University of Groningen, Bratislava International School of Liberal Arts, Leuphana University of Lüneburg, Central European University, and Bard College Berlin, formerly known as the European College of Liberal Arts. Central European University launched a liberal arts undergraduate degree in Culture, Politics, and Society in 2020 as part of its move to Vienna and accreditation in Austria. As well as the colleges listed above, some universities in the Netherlands offer bachelors programs in Liberal Arts and Sciences (Tilburg University). Liberal arts (as a degree program) is just beginning to establish itself in Europe. For example, University College Dublin offers the degree, as does St. Marys University College Belfast, both institutions coincidentally on the island of Ireland. In the Netherlands, universities have opened constituent liberal arts colleges under the terminology &quot;university college&quot; since the late 1990s. The four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences at University College Freiburg is the first of its kind in Germany. It started in October 2012 with 78 students. The first Liberal Arts degree program in Sweden was established at Gothenburg University in 2011, followed by a Liberal Arts Bachelor Programme at Uppsala University&#x27;s Campus Gotland in the autumn of 2013. The first Liberal Arts program in Georgia was introduced in 2005 by American-Georgian Initiative for Liberal Education (AGILE), an NGO. Thanks to their collaboration, Ilia State University became the first higher education institution in Georgia to establish a liberal arts program.

In France, Chavagnes Studium, a Liberal Arts Study Centre in partnership with the Institut Catholique d&#x27;études supérieures, and based in a former Catholic seminary, is launching a two-year intensive BA in the Liberal Arts, with a distinctively Catholic outlook. It has been suggested that the liberal arts degree may become part of mainstream education provision in the United Kingdom, Ireland and other European countries. In 1999, the European College of Liberal Arts (now Bard College Berlin) was founded in Berlin and in 2009 it introduced a four-year Bachelor of Arts program in Value Studies taught in English, leading to an interdisciplinary degree in the humanities.

In England, the first institution to retrieve and update a liberal arts education at the undergraduate level was the University of Winchester with their BA (Hons) Modern Liberal Arts program which launched in 2010. In 2012, University College London began its interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences BASc degree (which has kinship with the liberal arts model) with 80 students. In 2013, the University of Birmingham created the School of Liberal Arts and Natural Sciences, home of a suite of flexible 4-year programs in which students study a broad range of subjects drawn from across the university, and gain qualifications including both traditional Liberal Arts and Natural Sciences, but also novel thematic combinations linking both areas. King&#x27;s College London launched the BA Liberal Arts, which has a slant towards arts, humanities and social sciences subjects. The New College of the Humanities also launched a new liberal education programme. Richmond American University London is a private liberal arts university where all undergraduate degrees are taught with a US liberal arts approach over a four-year programme. Durham University has both a popular BA Liberal Arts and a BA Combined Honours in Social Sciences programme, both of which allow for interdisciplinary approaches to education. The University of Nottingham also has a Liberal Arts BA with study abroad options and links with its Natural Sciences degrees. In 2016, the University of Warwick launched a three/four-year liberal arts BA degree, which focuses on transdisciplinary approaches and problem-based learning techniques in addition to providing structured disciplinary routes and bespoke pathways. And for 2017 entry UCAS lists 20 providers of liberal arts programmes.

In Scotland, the four-year undergraduate Honours degree, specifically the Master of Arts, has historically demonstrated considerable breadth in focus. In the first two years of Scottish MA and BA degrees students typically study a number of different subjects before specialising in their Honours years (third and fourth year). The University of Dundee and the University of Glasgow (at its Crichton Campus) are the only Scottish universities that currently offer a specifically named &#x27;Liberal Arts&#x27; degree.

In Slovakia, the Bratislava International School of Liberal Arts (BISLA) is located in the Old Town of Bratislava. It is the first liberal arts college in Central Europe. A private, accredited three-year degree-granting undergraduate institution, it opened in September 2006.

==In Asia==
The Commission on Higher Education of the Philippines mandates a General Education curriculum required of all higher education institutions; it includes a number of liberal arts subjects, including history, art appreciation, and ethics, plus interdisciplinary electives. Many universities have much more robust liberal arts core curricula; most notably, the Jesuit universities such as Ateneo de Manila University have a strong liberal arts core curriculum that includes philosophy, theology, literature, history, and the social sciences. Forman Christian College is a liberal arts university in Lahore, Pakistan. It is one of the oldest institutions in the Indian subcontinent. It is a chartered university recognized by the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan. Aga Khan University offers a worldclass liberal arts education in the arts and sciences in Karachi, Pakistan, and Habib University in Karachi, Pakistan offers a holistic liberal arts and sciences experience to its students through its uniquely tailored liberal core program which is compulsory for all undergraduate degree students.

In India, there are many institutions that offer undergraduate UG or bachelor&#x27;s degree/diploma and postgraduate PG or master&#x27;s degree/diploma as well as doctoral PhD and postdoctoral studies and research, in this academic discipline. The highly ranked IIT Guwahati offers a Manipal Academy of Higher Education – MAHE, an Institution of Eminence as recognised by MHRD of Govt of India in 2018, houses a Faculty of Liberal Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, and also others like Symbiosis &amp; FLAME University in Pune, Ahmedabad University, and Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU) in Ahmedabad, Ashoka University, and Azim Premji University in Bangalore. Lingnan University, Asian University for Women and University of Liberal Arts- Bangladesh (ULAB) are also a few such liberal arts colleges in Asia. International Christian University in Tokyo is the first and one of the very few liberal arts universities in Japan. Fulbright University Vietnam is the first liberal arts institution in Vietnam.

==In Australia==
Campion College is a Roman Catholic dedicated liberal arts college, located in the western suburbs of Sydney. Founded in 2006, it is the first tertiary educational liberal arts college of its type in Australia. Campion offers a Bachelor of Arts in the Liberal Arts as its sole undergraduate degree. The key disciplines studied are history, literature, philosophy, and theology.

The Millis Institute is the School of Liberal Arts at Christian Heritage College located in Brisbane. Founded by Dr. Ryan Messmore, former President of Campion College, the Millis Institute offers a Bachelor of Arts in the Liberal Arts in which students can choose to major in philosophy, theology, history or literature. It also endorses a &#x27;Study Abroad&#x27; program whereby students can earn credit towards their degree by undertaking two units over a five-week program at the University of Oxford. As of 2022, Elizabeth Hillman is currently the President of the Millis Institute.

A new school of Liberal Arts has been formed in the University of Wollongong; the new Arts course entitled &#x27;Western Civilisation&#x27; was first offered in 2020. The interdisciplinary curriculum focuses on the classic intellectual and artistic literature of the Western tradition. Courses in the liberal arts have recently been developed at the University of Sydney and the University of Notre Dame.

<text>A lateral is a consonant in which the airstream proceeds along one or both of the sides of the tongue, but it is blocked by the tongue from going through the middle of the mouth. An example of a lateral consonant is the English &quot;L&quot;, as in &quot;Larry&quot;. Lateral consonants contrast with central consonants, in which the airstream flows through the center of the mouth.

For the most common laterals, the tip of the tongue makes contact with the upper teeth (see dental consonant) or the upper gum (see alveolar consonant), but there are many other possible places for laterals to be made. The most common laterals are approximants and belong to the class of liquids, but lateral fricatives and affricates are also common in some parts of the world. Some languages, such as the Iwaidja and Ilgar languages of Australia, have lateral flaps, and others, such as the Xhosa and Zulu languages of Africa, have lateral clicks.

When pronouncing the labiodental fricatives , the lip blocks the airflow in the centre of the vocal tract, so the airstream proceeds along the sides instead. Nevertheless, they are not considered lateral consonants because the airflow never goes over the side of the tongue. No known language makes a distinction between lateral and non-lateral labiodentals. Plosives are never lateral, but they may have lateral release. Nasals are almost never lateral either, but reported in Nzema, and some languages have lateral nasal clicks. For consonants articulated in the throat (laryngeals), the lateral distinction is not made by any language, although pharyngeal and epiglottal laterals are reportedly possible.

==Examples==

English has one lateral phoneme: the lateral approximant , which in many accents has two allophones. One, found before vowels (and /j/) as in &quot;lady&quot; or &quot;fly&quot; (or &quot;value&quot;), is called &quot;clear l&quot;, pronounced as the alveolar lateral approximant with a &quot;neutral&quot; position of the body of the tongue. The other variant, so-called &quot;dark l&quot;, found before consonants or word-finally, as in &quot;bold&quot; or &quot;tell&quot;, is pronounced as the uvularized alveolar lateral approximant with the tongue assuming a spoon-like shape with its back part raised, which gives the sound a - or -like resonance. In some languages, like Albanian, those two sounds are different phonemes. Malsia e Madhe Gheg Albanian and Salamina Arvanitika even have the three-way distinction of laterals , and . East Slavic languages contrast and but do not have [l].

In many British accents (e.g. Cockney), dark may undergo vocalization through the reduction and loss of contact between the tip of the tongue and the alveolar ridge, becoming a rounded back vowel or glide. This process turns &quot;tell&quot; into , as must have happened with &quot;talk&quot; or &quot;walk&quot; at some stage. A similar process happened during the development of many other languages, including Brazilian Portuguese, Old French, and Polish, in all three of these resulting in voiced velar approximant or voiced labio-velar approximant , whence Modern French &quot;sauce&quot; as compared with Spanish &quot;salsa&quot;, or Polish &quot;Wisła&quot; (pronounced ) as compared with English &quot;Vistula&quot;.

In central and Venice dialects of Venetian, intervocalic has turned into a semivocalic , so that the written word &quot;ła bała&quot; is pronounced . The orthography uses the letter ł to represent this phoneme (it specifically represents not the sound but the phoneme that is, in some dialects, and, in others, ).

Many aboriginal Australian languages have a series of three or four lateral approximants, as do various dialects of Irish. Rarer lateral consonants include the retroflex laterals that can be found in many languages of India and in some Swedish dialects, and the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative , found in many Native North American languages, Welsh and Zulu. In Adyghe and some Athabaskan languages like Hän, both voiceless and voiced alveolar lateral fricatives occur, but there is no approximant. Many of these languages also have lateral affricates. Some languages have palatal or velar voiceless lateral fricatives or affricates, such as Dahalo and Zulu, but the IPA has no symbols for such sounds. However, appropriate symbols are easy to make by adding a lateral-fricative belt to the symbol for the corresponding lateral approximant (see below). Also, a devoicing diacritic may be added to the approximant.

Nearly all languages with such lateral obstruents also have the approximant. However, there are a number of exceptions, many of them located in the Pacific Northwest area of the United States. For example, Tlingit has but no . Other examples from the same area include Nuu-chah-nulth and Kutenai, and elsewhere, Mongolian, Chukchi, and Kabardian.

Standard Tibetan has a voiceless lateral approximant, usually romanized as &quot;lh&quot;, as in the name Lhasa.

A uvular lateral approximant has been reported to occur in some speakers of American English.

Pashto has a retroflex lateral flap that becomes voiced retroflex approximant when it is at the end of a syllable and a word.

There are a large number of lateral click consonants; 17 occur in !Xóõ.

Lateral trills are also possible, but they do not occur in any known language. They may be pronounced by initiating or with an especially forceful airflow. There is no symbol for them in the IPA. They are sometimes used to imitate bird calls, and they are a component of Donald Duck talk.

==Ambiguous centrality==
The IPA requires sounds to be defined as to centrality, as either central or lateral. However, languages may be ambiguous as to some consonants&#x27; laterality. A well-known example is the liquid consonant in Japanese, represented in common transliteration systems as , which can be recognized as a (post)alveolar tap , alveolar lateral flap /ɺ/, (post)alveolar lateral approximant /l/, (post)alveolar approximant /ɹ/, voiced retroflex stop /ɖ/, and various less common forms.

==Lateralized consonants==
A superscript is defined as lateral release.

Consonants may also be pronounced with simultaneous lateral and central airflow. This is well-known from speech pathology with a lateral lisp. However, it also occurs in nondisordered speech in some southern Arabic dialects and possibly some Modern South Arabian languages, which have pharyngealized nonsibilant and (simultaneous and ) and possibly a sibilant (simultaneous ). Examples are &#x27;pain&#x27; in the dialect of Al-Rubūʽah and &#x27;back&#x27; and &#x27;hyena&#x27; in Rijal Almaa. (Here the indicates simultaneous laterality rather than lateral release.) Biblical Hebrew may have had non-emphatic central-lateral sibilants and , while Old Arabic has been analyzed as having the emphatic central–lateral fricatives , and .

<text>In linguistics, a liquid consonant or simply liquid is any of a class of consonants that consists of rhotics and voiced lateral approximants, which are also sometimes described as &quot;R-like sounds&quot; and &quot;L-like sounds&quot;. The word &quot;liquid&quot; seems to be a calque of the Ancient Greek word (, ), initially used by grammarian Dionysius Thrax to describe Greek sonorants.

Liquid consonants are more prone to be part of consonant clusters and of the syllable nucleus. Their third formants are generally non-predictable based on the first two formants. Another important feature is their complex articulation, which makes them a hard consonant class to study with precision and the last consonants to be produced by children during their phonological development. They are also more likely to undergo certain types of phonological changes such as assimilation, dissimilation and metathesis.

Most languages have at least one liquid in their phonemic inventory. English has two, /l/ and /ɹ/.

==History and etymology==
The grammarian Dionysius Thrax used the Ancient Greek word (, ) to describe the sonorant consonants () of classical Greek. It is assumed that the term referred to their changing or inconsistent (or &quot;fluid&quot;) effect on meter in classical Greek verse when they occur as the second member of a consonant cluster (see below). This word was calqued into Latin as (possibly because of a mistranslation), whence it has been retained in the Western European phonetic tradition.

== Sonority and syllable structure ==
In the sonority hierarchy, liquids are considered the most sonorous sounds after vowels and glides, with laterals considered to be less sonorous than rhotics. This explains why they are more likely to be part of consonant clusters than other consonants (excluding glides), and to follow obstruents in initial consonant clusters and precede them in final consonant clusters.

Liquids also hold this position in the hierarchy of syllable peaks, which means that liquids are theoretically more likely to be syllabic (or, in other words, be part of a syllable nucleus) than any other consonants, although some studies show that syllabic nasals are overall more favoured. Thus Czech and other Slavic languages allow their liquid consonants and to be the center of their syllables – as witnessed by the classic tonguetwister &quot;push (your) finger through (your) throat.&quot; This is also true for General American English (see the words &quot;barrel and &quot;anchor) and other English accents.

Sequences of an obstruent and a liquid consonant are often ambiguous as far as syllabification is concerned. In these cases, whether the two consonants are part of the same syllable or not heavily depends on the individual language, and closely related languages can behave differently (such as Icelandic and Faroese). In Latin and Ancient Greek, obstruent + liquid consonant clusters (known as &quot;muta cum liquida&quot;) supposedly were ambiguous in this sense, and as such were often used to manipulate meter.

== Acoustic and articulatory phonetics ==
Acoustically, liquids seem to have a third formant of unexpected value when compared to the first and second formants. This contrasts with non-liquid approximants, whose third formant value is expected based on the first two formants.

In articulatory phonetics, liquids are described as &quot;controlled gestures,&quot; which are slower and require more precise tongue movement during the &quot;homing phase&quot;, when the tongue adjusts towards the place of articulation of the consonant. Due to the fact that babies prefer &quot;ballistic gestures&quot;, which rely on the propelling motion of the jaw, liquids usually occur later in a child&#x27;s phonological development, and they are more likely to be deleted in consonant clusters before the age of three. Liquids have also been described as consonants involving &quot;complex lingual geometries.&quot;

To better determine the full range of articulatory and acoustic characteristics of liquids, the use of ultrasound paired with audio recordings is increasing. This is due to this consonant group being difficult to analyse on a purely auditory base.

== Liquids and phonological change ==
Liquids seem to be more or less subjected to certain sound changes or phonological processes than other consonants. On an auditory level, liquid consonants resemble each other, which is likely the reason they undergo or trigger assimilation, dissimilation and metathesis.

===Metathesis===
Cross-linguistically, liquids tend to be more prone to metathesis than other consonants, especially long-distance metathesis.

In Spanish, a frequent example is the behaviour of /r/ and /l/:

* Lat. &gt; Span. “crocodile”

* Lat. &gt; Span. “miracle”
* Lat. &gt; Span. “danger”
* Lat. &gt; Span. “speech”

In English, is frequently pronounced /ˈkʌmf.tɚ.bəl/ in rhotic varieties, even though its stem, , is pronounced /ˈkʌm.fɚt/, with the rhotic /ɹ/ in its original position.

=== Assimilation ===
Liquid consonants can also undergo assimilation: compare Italian &quot;parlare&quot; &quot;to speak&quot; with Sicilian &quot;parrari&quot;. This phenomenon, which is not so common worldwide, is attested in Finnish: e.g., the root &quot;tul-&quot; &quot;to come&quot; combined with the past participle suffix -&quot;nut&quot;, yields the surface form &quot;tullut&quot;. This is one of the reasons long liquids are common in Finnish.

A specific form of liquid assimilation, liquid harmony, is present is some languages. In Sundanese, some morphemes have two different realisations depending on what liquid is present in the root.

===Dissimilation===
Liquids are also prone to dissimilation when they occur in sequence. For example, Old Italian &quot;colonnello&quot; &quot;colonel&quot; is borrowed into Middle French as &quot;coronnel&quot;, which is in turned loaned into English as &quot;&quot;, with an orthography inspired by Italian but with the /ˈkɚnəl/ or /ˈkɜːnel/ pronunciation with the rhotic &quot;r&quot;, which is absent in writing.

=== Epenthesis ===
Epenthesis, or the addition of sounds, is common in environments where liquids are present, especially consonant clusters. The epenthetic sound can be a vowel or a consonant. For example, the genitive of the Ancient Greek noun ἀνήρ &quot;anḗr&quot; &quot;man&quot; is ἀνδρός &quot;andrós&quot;, with the insertion of a [d] sound between a nasal consonant and the liquid [r]. Another example is the Irish word &quot;bolg&quot; &quot;belly&quot;, usually pronounced with an epenthetic schwa [ə] after the liquid [lˠ]: .

=== Other types of phonological change ===
Liquids can often be the result of lenition, the change of a consonant towards characteristics that are typical of vowels, making it &quot;weaker&quot;. They are also likely to become vowels or glides, a process known as vocalisation. See, for example, Sicilian &quot;caudu&quot; from Latin &quot;calidus&quot;.

==Occurrence and geographical distribution==
According to a survey by linguist Ian Maddieson, most languages have one to three liquids (with systems of two liquids being the most common) and they are usually dental or alveolar. Liquid consonants are also rarely geminated cross-linguistically.

Many languages, such as Japanese, Korean, or Polynesian languages (see below), have a single liquid phoneme that has both lateral and rhotic allophones.

English has two liquid phonemes, one lateral, and one rhotic, , exemplified in the words led&quot; and red&quot;.

Many other European languages have one lateral and one rhotic phoneme. Some, such as Greek, Italian and Serbo-Croatian, have more than two liquid phonemes. All three languages have the set , with two laterals and one rhotic. Similarly, the Iberian languages contrast four liquid phonemes. , , , and a fourth phoneme that is an alveolar trill in all but many varieties of Portuguese, where it is a uvular trill or fricative (also, the majority of Spanish speakers lack and use the central instead). Some European languages, for example Russian and Irish, contrast a palatalized lateral–rhotic pair with an unpalatalized (or velarized) set (e.g. in Russian).

Elsewhere in the world, two liquids of the types mentioned above remains the most common attribute of a language&#x27;s consonant inventory except in North America and Australia. A majority of indigenous North American languages do not have rhotics at all and there is a wide variety of lateral sounds, though most are obstruent laterals rather than liquids. Most indigenous Australian languages, in contrast, are very rich in liquids, with some having as many as seven distinct liquids. They typically include dental, alveolar, retroflex and palatal laterals, and as many as three rhotics.

On the other side, there are many indigenous languages in the Amazon Basin and eastern North America, as well as a few in Asia and Africa, with no liquids.

Polynesian languages typically have only one liquid, which may be either a lateral or a rhotic. Non-Polynesian Oceanic languages usually have both and , occasionally more (e.g. Araki has , , ) or less (e.g. Mwotlap has only ). Hiw is unusual in having a prestopped velar lateral as its only liquid.

<doc id="18685" wikidata="Q313306" url="?curid=18685" title="Lou Ferrigno">
<text>Louis Jude Ferrigno Sr. (; born November 9, 1951) is an American actor and retired professional bodybuilder. He won an IFBB Mr. America title and two consecutive IFBB Mr. Universe titles, and appeared in the documentary film &quot;Pumping Iron&quot; (1977). As an actor, he is best known for his title role in the CBS television series &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (1978–1982) and vocally reprising the role in subsequent animated and computer-generated incarnations. He has also appeared in European-produced fantasy-adventures such as &quot;Hercules&quot; (1983) and &quot;Sinbad of the Seven Seas&quot; (1989), and as himself in the sitcom &quot;The King of Queens&quot; and the 2009 comedy &quot;I Love You, Man&quot;.

==Early life==
Ferrigno was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Victoria and Matt Ferrigno, a police lieutenant. He is of Italian descent. Soon after he was born, Ferrigno says he believes he had a series of ear infections and lost 75% to 80% of his hearing, though his condition was not diagnosed until he was three years old. Hearing loss and his speech impediment caused Ferrigno to be bullied by peers during his childhood who called him &quot;deaf&quot; and &quot;mute&quot;. He began reading comic books such as &quot;Hulk&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man&quot; at this time, later saying &quot;I was obsessed with power&quot;, and &quot;I wanted to be strong enough so that I could be able to defend myself&quot;, which eventually made him take up bodybuilding: &quot;My father rejected me because I was not the perfect son, so I fantasised about being like The Hulk and that’s what led to bodybuilding&quot;.

Ferrigno started weight training at the age of 13, citing bodybuilder and &quot;Hercules&quot; star Steve Reeves as one of his role models. Because he could not afford to buy weights, he made his own using a broomstick and pails which he partially filled with cement. Ferrigno attended St. Athanasius Grammar School and Brooklyn Technical High School, where he learned metal working.

==Bodybuilding career==
After graduating from high school in 1969, Ferrigno won his first major title, IFBB Mr. America. Four years later, he won the title IFBB Mr. Universe. Early in his career he lived in Columbus, Ohio, and trained with Arnold Schwarzenegger. In 1974, he came in second on his first attempt at the Mr. Olympia competition. He came in third the following year, and his attempt to beat Schwarzenegger was the subject of the 1977 documentary &quot;Pumping Iron&quot;. The documentary made Ferrigno famous.

These victories, however, did not provide enough income for him to earn a living. His first paying job was as a $10-an-hour sheet metal worker in a Brooklyn factory, where he worked for three years. He did not enjoy the dangerous work, and left after a friend and co-worker accidentally cut off his own hand.

Following this, Ferrigno left the competition circuit for many years, a period that included a brief stint as a defensive lineman for the Toronto Argonauts in the Canadian Football League. He had never played football, and was cut after two games. Ferrigno left the world of Canadian football after he broke the legs of a fellow player during a scrimmage.

Ferrigno, who stands at almost , weighed in during competition at in 1975 and in 1992.

Ferrigno competed in the first annual World&#x27;s Strongest Man competition in 1977, where he finished fourth in a field of eight competitors.

In the early 1990s Ferrigno returned to bodybuilding, competing for the 1992 and 1993 Mr. Olympia titles. Finishing 12th and 10th, respectively, he then turned to the 1994 Masters Olympia, where his attempt to beat Robbie Robinson and Boyer Coe was the subject of the 1996 documentary &quot;Stand Tall&quot;. After this, he retired from competition.

==Acting career==
===1977–2008===
In 1977, Ferrigno was cast as the Hulk in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;. Though they were rarely on camera together, Ferrigno and who played the Hulk&#x27;s &quot;normal&quot; alter became friends; Ferrigno has described Bixby as a &quot;mentor&quot; and &quot;father figure&quot; who took him under his wing. Ferrigno also singles out the instances in which Bixby directed Ferrigno in some episodes as particularly memorable. Ferrigno continued playing the Hulk role until 1981, although the last two episodes were not broadcast until May 1982. Later, he and Bixby co-starred in three &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; TV movies.

In November 1978 and again in May 1979 Ferrigno appeared in &quot;Battle of the Network Stars&quot;. He portrayed the titular character in the 1983 science fantasy adventure film &quot;Hercules&quot;, and received mixed-to-negative reviews for his performance. He was, however, praised by Marylynn Uricchio, a film critic for the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;, and Andy Brack of &quot;Charleston City Paper&quot;. Gary Allen Smith, author of the book &quot;Epic Films&quot;, complimented Ferrigno&#x27;s physical strength and aesthetics in the film: &quot;At 6&#x27;5&quot; and 262 pounds, he is a massive and thoroughly convincing Hercules&quot;.

In 1983, Ferrigno appeared as John Six in the short-lived medical drama &quot;Trauma Center&quot;.

Ferrigno played himself during intermittent guest appearances on the CBS sitcom &quot;The King of Queens&quot;, beginning in 2000 and continuing until the program&#x27;s conclusion in 2007. He and his wife Carla were depicted as the main characters&#x27; next-door neighbors, enduring their jokes about him being the Hulk.

He made cameo appearances as a security guard in both the 2003 film &quot;Hulk&quot; and the 2008 film &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, in which he also voiced the Hulk. In the latter film, Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) bribes him with a pizza to gain entry into a university building. He voiced the Hulk in other Marvel Cinematic Universe films, uncredited. He voiced the Hulk until 2015&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Mark Ruffalo has voiced Hulk in subsequent films.

===2009–present===

He trained Michael Jackson intermittently beginning in the early 1990s, and in 2009, he helped Jackson get into shape for a planned series of concerts in London, which were ultimately cancelled due to Jackson&#x27;s death.

Ferrigno took part in a Smosh video, titled &quot;I Love Lou Ferrigno&quot;, in which he is tracked down by one of Smosh&#x27;s members, Anthony, in Hollywood. The skit ends with Ferrigno knocking Anthony unconscious, in response to Ian&#x27;s claim that Anthony stole Ferrigno&#x27;s Butterfinger.

Ferrigno has his own line of fitness equipment called Ferrigno Fitness. In January 2009, he provided equipment to &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; for use as a One Bid prize, and demonstrated the equipment himself.

In 2016, Ferrigno appeared as a playable Lego version of himself in &quot;Lego Marvel&#x27;s Avengers&quot;.

==Non-acting endeavors==
In February 2006, Ferrigno was sworn in as a Los Angeles County, California, reserve sheriff&#x27;s deputy, Level II. In November 2010, Maricopa County, Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio swore Ferrigno in as a member of a volunteer sheriff posse, which also included actors Steven Seagal and Peter Lupus, in order to help control illegal immigration in the Phoenix Valley area.

Ferrigno was a contestant on season five of the NBC reality television series &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, which premiered in February 2012. He appeared on the program in order to raise money for his charity, the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Ferrigno was Team Unanimous&#x27; project manager for the task depicted in the fifth episode, &quot;I&#x27;m Going to Mop the Floor With You,&quot; which was to create a viral video to promote O-Cedar&#x27;s ProMist Spray Mop, placing him in competition with actress Tia Carrere, the project manager of the women&#x27;s team, Forte. In addition to the usual $20,000 awarded to the charity of the project manager of the winning team, O-Cedar pledged an additional $30,000 for that task. Team Unanimous&#x27; video—in which Ferrigno appeared dancing while mopping—won the task, winning the $50,000 for Muscular Dystrophy Association. He was fired in episode nine, &quot;Ad Hawk&quot;, which involved creating a 60-second commercial for Entertainment.com.

In June 2012, Ferrigno was sworn in as a reserve deputy to the San Luis Obispo County, California, Sheriff&#x27;s Department. There he completed his level I law enforcement academy, bringing his training up to full peace officer status. In September 2013, Ferrigno was sworn in as a special deputy to the Delaware County, Ohio, Sheriff&#x27;s Department.

In 2017, Ferrigno was inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame.

In May 2018, President Donald Trump appointed Ferrigno to be a member of his Council on Sports, Fitness &amp; Nutrition.

==Personal life==
Due to ear infections he had soon after birth, Ferrigno lost 75 to 80% of his hearing and has been using hearing aids since the age of five. Ferrigno says his hearing loss helped shape his sense of determination in his youth, saying, &quot;I think that if I wasn&#x27;t hard of hearing I wouldn&#x27;t be where I am now. Early on, as a youngster it was difficult, but I&#x27;m not ashamed to talk about it because many people have misconceptions about hearing loss; like who has hearing loss and what it&#x27;s like not to hear, so I do talk about it. I think my hearing loss helped create a determination within me to be all that I can be, and gave me a certain strength of character too. Anytime I do a movie or a TV show, I make them aware of my hearing loss at the beginning, and that makes it much easier for all of us to communicate and get the job done.&quot; Later in life, he received a cochlear implant which restored much of his hearing.

Ferrigno married Susan Groff in 1978, divorcing a year later. On May 3, 1980, he married psychotherapist Carla Green, who then also began serving as his manager; she later became a personal trainer. They have three children: Shanna (born 1981), Louis Jr. (born 1984), and Brent (born 1990). Shanna has a recurring role as Nurse Janice in &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, and appeared in the NBC series &quot;Windfall&quot;, as well as the television film &quot;Within&quot;, and in 2005 she appeared in the E! reality television series &quot;Filthy Rich: Cattle Drive&quot;. Louis Jr. was a linebacker for the University of Southern California Trojans football team. He currently plays a recurring role in the TV series &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot;, airing on CBS.

Ferrigno has filed suit against his younger brother, Andrew, on two occasions over the use of the name Ferrigno in business ventures.

<doc id="18687" wikidata="Q155059" url="?curid=18687" title="Leninism">
<text>Leninism (, ) is a political ideology developed by Russian Marxist revolutionary Vladimir Lenin that proposes the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat led by a revolutionary vanguard party as the political prelude to the establishment of communism.
Lenin&#x27;s ideological contributions to the Marxist ideology relate to his theories on the party, imperialism, the state, and revolution. The function of the Leninist vanguard party is to provide the working classes with the political consciousness (education and organisation) and revolutionary leadership necessary to depose capitalism.

Leninist revolutionary leadership is based upon &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; (1848), identifying the communist party as &quot;the most advanced and resolute section of the working class parties of every country; that section which pushes forward all others.&quot; As the vanguard party, the Bolsheviks viewed history through the theoretical framework of dialectical materialism, which sanctioned political commitment to the successful overthrow of capitalism, and then to instituting socialism; and, as the revolutionary national government, to realise the socio-economic transition by all means.

In the aftermath of the October Revolution in 1917, Leninism was the dominant version of Marxism in Russia. In establishing the socialist mode of production in Soviet Russia – with the 1917 Decree on Land, war communism (1918–1921) and the New Economic Policy (1921–1928) – the revolutionary régime suppressed most political opposition, including Marxists who opposed Lenin&#x27;s actions, the anarchists and the Mensheviks, factions of the Socialist Revolutionary Party and the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries. The Russian Civil War (1917–1922), which included the fight against the White Army, Entente intervention, left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks and widespread peasant rebellions was an external and internal war which transformed Bolshevik Russia into the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (RSFSR), the core and largest republic that founded the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).

As revolutionary praxis, Leninism originally was neither a proper philosophy nor a discrete political theory. Leninism comprises politico-economic developments of orthodox Marxism and Lenin&#x27;s interpretations of Marxism, which function as a pragmatic synthesis for practical application to the actual conditions (political, social, economic) of the post-emancipation agrarian society of Imperial Russia in the early 20th century. As a political-science term, Lenin&#x27;s theory of proletarian revolution entered common usage at the fifth congress of the Communist International (1924), when Grigory Zinoviev applied the term &quot;Leninism&quot; to denote &quot;vanguard-party revolution.&quot; &quot;Leninism&quot; was accepted as part of Russian Communist Party (b)&#x27;s vocabulary and doctrine around 1922, and in January 1923, despite objections from Lenin, it entered the public vocabulary.

== Historical background ==

In the 19th century, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote the &quot;Manifesto of the Communist Party&quot; (1848), in which they called for the political unification of the European working classes in order to achieve communist revolution; and proposed that because the socio-economic organisation of communism was of a higher form than that of capitalism, a workers&#x27; revolution first would occur in the industrialised countries. In Germany, Marxist social democracy was the political perspective of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, inspiring Russian Marxists, such as Lenin.

In the early 20th century, the socio-economic backwardness of Imperial Russia (1721–1917) — characterized by combined and uneven economic development — facilitated rapid and intensive industrialisation, which produced a united, working-class proletariat in a predominantly agrarian society. Moreover, because industrialisation was financed chiefly with foreign capital, Imperial Russia did not possess a revolutionary bourgeoisie with political and economic influence upon the workers and the peasants, as had been the case in the French Revolution (1789–1799) in the 18th century. Although Russia&#x27;s political economy was agrarian and semi-feudal, the task of democratic revolution fell to the urban, industrial working class as the only social class capable of effecting land reform and democratisation, in view that the Russian bourgeoisie would suppress any revolution.

In the &quot;April Theses&quot; (1917), the political strategy of the October Revolution (7–8 November 1917), Lenin proposed that the Russian revolution was not an isolated national event but a fundamentally international event—the first socialist revolution in the world. Lenin&#x27;s practical application of Marxism and proletarian revolution to the social, political, and economic conditions of agrarian Russia motivated and impelled the &quot;revolutionary nationalism of the poor&quot; to depose the absolute monarchy of the three-hundred-year dynasty of the House of Romanov (1613–1917), as tsars of Russia.

=== Imperialism ===
In &quot;Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism&quot; (1916), Lenin&#x27;s economic analyses indicated that capitalism would transform into a global financial system, by which industrialised countries exported financial capital to their colonies and so realise the exploitation of the labour of the natives and the exploitation of the natural resources of their countries. Such superexploitation allows wealthy countries to maintain a domestic labour aristocracy with a slightly higher standard of living than most workers, ensuring peaceful labour–capital relations in the capitalist homeland. Therefore, a proletarian revolution of workers and peasants could not occur in capitalist countries whilst the imperialist global-finance system remained in place. The first proletarian revolution would have to occur in an underdeveloped country, such as Imperial Russia, the politically weakest country in the capitalist global-finance system in the early 20th century. In the &quot;United States of Europe Slogan&quot; (1915), Lenin wrote:


In &quot;&quot;Left-Wing&quot; Communism: An Infantile Disorder&quot; (1920), Lenin wrote:

== Leninist praxis ==

=== Vanguard party ===

In Chapter II, &quot;Proletarians and Communists&quot;, of &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; (1848), Marx and Engels present the communist party as the political vanguard solely qualified to lead the proletariat in revolution:

The revolutionary purpose of the Leninist vanguard party is to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat with the working class&#x27;s support. The communist party would lead the popular deposition of the Tsarist government and then transfer government power to the working class; that change of the ruling class—from the bourgeoisie to the proletariat—makes establishing socialism possible. In &quot;What Is To Be Done?&quot; (1902), Lenin said that a revolutionary vanguard party, recruited from the working class, should lead the political campaign because only in that way would the proletariat successfully realise their revolution; unlike the economic campaign of trade-union-struggle advocated by other socialist political parties and the anarcho-syndicalists. Like Marx, Lenin distinguished between the aspects of a revolution, the &quot;economic campaign&quot; (labour strikes for increased wages and work concessions) that featured diffused plural leadership; and the &quot;political campaign&quot; (socialist changes to society), which required the decisive, revolutionary leadership of the Bolshevik vanguard party.

==== Democratic centralism ====

Based upon the First International (IWA, International Workingmen&#x27;s Association, 1864–1876), Lenin organised the Bolsheviks as a democratically centralised vanguard party; wherein free political speech was recognised as legitimate until policy consensus; afterwards, every member of the party was expected to abide by the agreed policy. Democratic debate was Bolshevik practice, even after Lenin banned factions among the Party in 1921. Despite being a guiding political influence, Lenin did not exercise absolute power and continually debated to have his points of view accepted as a course of revolutionary action. In &quot;Freedom to Criticise and Unity of Action&quot; (1905), Lenin said:

==== Proletarian revolution ====
Before the October Revolution, despite supporting moderate political reform—including Bolsheviks elected to the Duma when opportune—Lenin said that capitalism could only be overthrown with proletarian revolution, not with gradual reforms—from within (Fabianism) and from without (social democracy)—which would fail because the bourgeoisie&#x27;s control of the means of production determined the nature of political power in Russia. As epitomised in the slogan &quot;For a Democratic Dictatorship of the Proletariat and Peasantry&quot;, a proletarian revolution in underdeveloped Russia required a united proletariat (peasants and industrial workers) to assume government power in the cities successfully. Moreover, owing to the middle-class aspirations of much of the peasantry, Leon Trotsky said that the proletarian leadership of the revolution would ensure truly socialist and democratic socio-economic change.

=== Dictatorship of the proletariat ===
In Bolshevik Russia, government by direct democracy was realised and effected by the soviets (elected councils of workers), which Lenin said was the &quot;democratic dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; postulated in orthodox Marxism. The soviets comprised representative committees from the factories and the trade unions but excluded the capitalist social class to establish a proletarian government by and for the working class and the peasants. Concerning the political disenfranchisement of the capitalist social class in Bolshevik Russia, Lenin said that &quot;depriving the exploiters of the franchise is a purely Russian question, and not a question of the dictatorship of the proletariat, in general. ... In which countries ...democracy for the exploiters will be, in one or another form, restricted ...is a question of the specific national features of this or that capitalism.&quot; In chapter five of &quot;The State and Revolution&quot; (1917), Lenin describes the dictatorship of the proletariat as:

Concerning the disenfranchisement from democracy of the capitalist social class, Lenin said: &quot;Democracy for the vast majority of the people, and suppression by force, i.e. exclusion from democracy, of the exploiters and oppressors of the people—this is the change democracy undergoes during the transition from capitalism to communism.&quot; The dictatorship of the proletariat was effected with soviet constitutionalism, a form of government opposite to the dictatorship of capital (privately owned means of production) practised in bourgeois democracies. Under soviet constitutionalism, the Leninist vanguard party would be one of many political parties competing for election to government power. Nevertheless, because of the Russian Civil War (1917–1924) and the anti-Bolshevik terrorism of opposing political parties aiding the White Armies&#x27; counter-revolution, the Bolshevik government banned all other political parties, which left the Leninist vanguard party as the only political party in Russia. Lenin said that such political suppression was not philosophically inherent to the dictatorship of the proletariat.

=== Economics ===

The Bolshevik government nationalised industry and established a foreign-trade monopoly to allow the productive coordination of the national economy and so prevent Russian national industries from competing against each other. To feed the populaces of town and country, Lenin instituted war communism (1918–1921) as a necessary condition—adequate supplies of food and weapons—for fighting the Russian Civil War. In March 1921, the New Economic Policy (NEP, 1921–1929) allowed limited local capitalism (private commerce and internal free trade) and replaced grain requisitions with an agricultural tax managed by state banks. The NEP was meant to resolve food-shortage riots by the peasantry and allowed limited private enterprise; the profit motive encouraged farmers to produce the crops required to feed town and country; and to economically re-establish the urban working class, who had lost many workers to fight the counter-revolutionary Civil War. The NEP nationalisation of the economy then would facilitate the industrialisation of Russia, politically strengthen the working class, and raise the standards of living for all Russians. Lenin said that the appearance of new socialist states was necessary for strengthening Russia&#x27;s economy in establishing Russian socialism. Lenin&#x27;s socio-economic perspective was supported by the German Revolution of 1918–1919, the Italian insurrection and general strikes of 1920, and worker wage-riots in the UK, France, and the US.

=== National self-determination ===
In recognising and accepting nationalism among oppressed peoples, Lenin advocated their national right to self-determination and so opposed Russian chauvinism because such ethnocentrism was a cultural obstacle to establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat in every territory of the deposed Russian Empire (1721–1917). In &quot;The Right of Nations to Self-determination&quot; (1914), Lenin said:

The socialist internationalism of Marxism and Bolshevism is based upon class struggle and a people&#x27;s transcending nationalism, ethnocentrism, and religion—the intellectual obstacles to progressive class consciousness—which are the cultural &quot;status quo&quot; that the capitalist ruling class manipulates in order to divide the working classes and the peasant classes politically. To overcome that barrier to establishing socialism, Lenin said that acknowledging nationalism, as a people&#x27;s right of self-determination and right of secession, naturally would allow socialist states to transcend the political limitations of nationalism to form a federation. In &quot;The Question of Nationalities, or &#x27;Autonomisation&quot;&#x27; (1923), Lenin said:

=== Socialist culture ===
The role of the Leninist vanguard party was to politically educate the workers and peasants to dispel the societal false consciousness of religion and nationalism that constitute the cultural &quot;status quo&quot; taught by the bourgeoisie to the proletariat to facilitate their economic exploitation of peasants and workers. Influenced by Lenin, the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party stated that the development of the socialist workers&#x27; culture should not be &quot;hamstrung from above&quot; and opposed the &quot;Proletkult&quot; (1917–1925) organisational control of the national culture.

== Leninism after 1924 ==

=== Stalinism and Marxism–Leninism ===
In post-Revolutionary Russia, the Stalinist application of Marxism–Leninism (socialism in one country), and Trotskyism (permanent world revolution) were the principal philosophies of communism that claimed legitimate ideological descent from Leninism; thus, within the Communist Party, each ideological faction denied the political legitimacy of the opposing faction. Until shortly before his death, Lenin countered Stalin&#x27;s disproportionate political influence in the Communist Party and the bureaucracy of the Soviet government, partly because of abuses he had committed against the populace of Georgia and partly because the autocratic Stalin had accumulated administrative power disproportionate to his office of General Secretary of the Communist Party.

The counter-action against Stalin aligned with Lenin&#x27;s advocacy of the right of self-determination for the national and ethnic groups of the deposed Tsarist Empire. Lenin warned the Party that Stalin had &quot;unlimited authority concentrated in his hands, and I am not sure whether he will always be capable of using that authority with sufficient caution&quot; and formed a faction with Leon Trotsky to remove Stalin as the General Secretary of the Communist Party.

To that end followed proposals reducing the administrative powers of party posts to reduce bureaucratic influence upon the policies of the Communist Party. Lenin advised Trotsky to emphasise Stalin&#x27;s recent bureaucratic alignment in such matters (e.g. undermining the anti-bureaucratic workers&#x27; and peasants&#x27; Inspection) and argued to depose Stalin as General Secretary. Despite advice to refuse &quot;any rotten compromise&quot;, he did not heed Lenin&#x27;s advice and General Secretary Stalin retained power over the Communist Party and the bureaucracy of the Soviet government.

=== Trotskyism ===

In 1922, Lenin allied with Leon Trotsky against the party&#x27;s growing bureaucratisation and the influence of Joseph Stalin. Lenin himself never mentioned the concept of &quot;Trotskyism&quot; after Trotsky became a member of the Bolshevik party but the term was employed by Stalin and the troika to present Trotsky&#x27;s views as factional and anathematical to Leninist thought.

After Lenin&#x27;s death (21 January 1924), Trotsky ideologically battled the influence of Stalin, who formed ruling blocs within the Russian Communist Party (with Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev, then with Nikolai Bukharin and then by himself) and so determined soviet government policy from 1924 onwards. The ruling blocs continually denied Stalin&#x27;s opponents the right to organise as an opposition faction within the party—thus, the reinstatement of democratic centralism and free speech within the Communist Party were key arguments of Trotsky&#x27;s Left Opposition and the later Joint Opposition.

In instituting government policy, Stalin promoted the doctrine of socialism in one country (adopted 1925), wherein the Soviet Union would establish socialism upon Russia&#x27;s economic foundations (and support socialist revolutions elsewhere). In a 1936 interview with journalist Roy W. Howard, Stalin articulated his rejection of world revolution and stated that “We never had such plans and intentions” and that “The export of revolution is nonsense”.

Conversely, Trotsky held that socialism in one country would economically constrain the industrial development of the Soviet Union and thus required assistance from the new socialist countries in the developed world—which was essential for maintaining soviet democracy—in 1924, much undermined by the Russian Civil War of White Army counter-revolution. Trotsky&#x27;s theory of permanent revolution proposed that socialist revolutions in underdeveloped countries would further dismantle feudal régimes and establish socialist democracies that would not pass through a capitalist stage of development and government. Hence, revolutionary workers should ally politically with peasant political organisations, not capitalist political parties. In contrast, Stalin and his allies proposed that alliances with capitalist political parties were essential to realising a revolution where communists were too few. Said Stalinist practice failed, especially in the Northern Expedition portion of the Chinese Revolution (1926–1928), which resulted in the right-wing Kuomintang&#x27;s massacre of the Chinese Communist Party. Despite the failure, Stalin&#x27;s policy of mixed-ideology political alliances nonetheless became Comintern&#x27;s policy.

Until exiled from Russia in 1929, Trotsky developed and led the Left Opposition (and the later Joint Opposition) with members of the Workers&#x27; Opposition, the Decembrists and (later) the Zinovievists. Trotskyism predominated the politics of the Left Opposition, which demanded the restoration of soviet democracy, the expansion of democratic centralism in the Communist Party, national industrialisation, international permanent revolution and socialist internationalism. According to historian Sheila Fitzpatrick, the scholarly consensus was that Stalin appropriated the position of the Left Opposition on such matters as industrialisation and collectivisation.

The Trotskyist demands countered Stalin&#x27;s political dominance of the Communist Party, which was officially characterised by the &quot;cult of Lenin&quot;, the rejection of permanent revolution, and advocated the doctrine of socialism in one country. The Stalinist economic policy vacillated between appeasing the capitalist interests of the kulak in the countryside and destroying them as a social class. Initially, the Stalinists also rejected the national industrialisation of Russia but then pursued it in full, sometimes brutally. In both cases, the Left Opposition denounced the regressive nature of Stalin&#x27;s policy towards the wealthy kulak social class and the brutality of forced industrialisation. Trotsky described Stalinist vacillation as a symptom of the undemocratic nature of a ruling bureaucracy.

During the 1920s and the 1930s, Stalin fought and defeated the political influence of Trotsky and the Trotskyists in Russia using slander, antisemitism, censorship, expulsions, exile (internal and external), and imprisonment. The anti-Trotsky campaign culminated in the executions (official and unofficial) of the Moscow Trials (1936–1938), which were part of the Great Purge of Old Bolsheviks who had led the Revolution.

=== Debated influence on Stalinism ===
Some historians such as Richard Pipes consider Stalinism as the natural consequence of Leninism, that Stalin &quot;faithfully implemented Lenin&#x27;s domestic and foreign policy programs&quot;. Robert Service notes that &quot;institutionally and ideologically Lenin laid the foundations for a Stalin ... but the passage from Leninism to the worse terrors of Stalinism was not smooth and inevitable.&quot; Historian and Stalin biographer Edvard Radzinsky believes that Stalin was a genuine follower of Lenin, exactly as he claimed himself. Proponents of continuity cite a variety of contributory factors, in that it was Lenin, rather than Stalin, whose civil war measures introduced the Red Terror with its hostage-taking and internment camps; that it was Lenin who developed the infamous Article 58 and who established the autocratic system within the Russian Communist Party. Proponents also note that Lenin put a ban on factions within the party and introduced the one-party state in 1921, a move that enabled Stalin to get rid of his rivals easily after Lenin&#x27;s death and cite Felix Dzerzhinsky, who exclaimed during the Bolshevik struggle against opponents in the Russian Civil War: &quot;We stand for organized terror—this should be frankly stated.&quot;

Some scholars have had a differing view and attributed the establishment of the one-party system in the Soviet Union to the wartime conditions imposed on Lenin&#x27;s government and others have highlighted the initial attempts to form a coalition government with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries. According to historian Marcel Liebman, Lenin&#x27;s wartime measures such as banning opposition parties was prompted by the fact that several political parties either took up arms against the new Soviet government, or participated in sabotage, collaborated with the deposed Tsarists, or made assassination attempts against Lenin and other Bolshevik leaders. Liebman also argued that the banning of parties under Lenin did not have the same repressive character as later bans enforced under the Stalinist regime. Several scholars have highlighted the socially progressive nature of Lenin&#x27;s policies such as universal education, universal healthcare and equal rights for women. Conversely, Stalin&#x27;s regime reversed Lenin&#x27;s policies on social matters such as sexual equality, legal restrictions on marriage, rights of sexual minorities and protective legislation. Historian Robert Vincent Daniels also viewed the Stalinist period as a counter-revolution in Soviet cultural life which revived patriotic propaganda, the Tsarist programme of Russification and traditional, military ranks which had been criticized by Lenin as expressions of &quot;Great Russian chauvinism&quot;. Daniels also regarded Stalinism to represent an abrupt break with the Leninist period in terms of economic policies in which a deliberated, scientific system of economic planning that featured former Menshevik economists at Gosplan had been replaced with a hasty version of planning with unrealistic targets, bureaucratic waste, bottlenecks and shortages.

Revisionist historians and some post–Cold War and otherwise dissident Soviet historians, including Roy Medvedev, argue that &quot;one could list the various measures carried out by Stalin that were actually a continuation of anti-democratic trends and measures implemented under Lenin&quot;, but that &quot;in so many ways, Stalin acted, not in line with Lenin&#x27;s clear instructions, but in defiance of them.&quot; In doing so, some historians have tried to distance Stalinism from Leninism to undermine the totalitarian view that the negative facets of Stalin were inherent in communism from the start. Critics include anti-Stalinist communists such as Leon Trotsky, who pointed out that Lenin attempted to persuade the Russian Communist Party to remove Stalin from his post as its General Secretary. Lenin&#x27;s Testament, the document which contained this order, was suppressed after Lenin&#x27;s death. Trotsky also argued that he and Lenin had intended to lift the ban on the opposition parties such as the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries as soon as the economic and social conditions of Soviet Russia had improved. Various historians have cited Lenin&#x27;s proposal to appoint Trotsky as a Vice-chairman of the Soviet Union as evidence that he intended Trotsky to be his successor as head of government. In his biography of Trotsky, Polish-British historian Isaac Deutscher says that, on being faced with the evidence, &quot;only the blind and the deaf could be unaware of the contrast between Stalinism and Leninism.&quot; According to Stalin&#x27;s secretary, Boris Bazhanov, Stalin was jubilant over Lenin&#x27;s death while “publicly putting on the mask of grief”. French historian Pierre Broue disputed the historical assessments of the early Soviet Union by modern historians such as Dmitri Volkogonov in which he argued had falsely equated Leninism, Stalinism and Trotskyism to present the notion of ideological continuity and reinforce the position of counter-communism. Other revisionist historians, such as Orlando Figes, whilst critical of the Soviet era, acknowledge that Lenin had actively sought to counter the growing influence of Stalin through a number of actions such as his alliance with Trotsky in 1922–23, opposition to Stalin on foreign trade, the Georgian affair and proposed party reforms which included the democratisation of the Central Committee and recruitment of 50–100 ordinary workers into the lower organs of the party.

Nikita Khrushchev, Stalin&#x27;s successor, argued that Stalin&#x27;s regime differed profusely from the leadership of Lenin in his &quot;Secret Speech&quot;, delivered in 1956. He was critical of the cult of the individual which was constructed around Stalin whereas Lenin stressed “the role of the people as the creator of history”. He also emphasized that Lenin favored a collective leadership which relied on personal persuasion and recommended the removal of Stalin from the position of General Secretary. Khrushchev contrasted this with the “despotism” of Stalin which require absolute submission to his position and he also highlighted that many of the people who were later annihilated as “enemies of the party&quot;, &quot;had worked with Lenin during his life”. He also contrasted the “severe methods” used by Lenin in the “most necessary cases” as a “struggle for survival” during the Civil War with the extreme methods and mass repressions used by Stalin even when the Revolution was “already victorious”. In his memoirs, Khrushchev argued that Stalin&#x27;s widespread purges of the &quot;most advanced nucleus of people&quot; among the Old Bolsheviks and leading figures in the military and scientific fields had &quot;undoubtedly&quot; weakened the nation.

Some Marxist theoreticians have disputed the view that the Stalinist dictatorship was a natural outgrowth of the Bolsheviks&#x27; actions as most of the original central committee members from 1917 were later eliminated by Stalin. George Novack stressed the initial efforts by the Bolsheviks to form a government with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries and bring other parties such as the Mensheviks into political legality. Tony Cliff argued the Bolshevik-Left Socialist Revolutionary coalition government dissolved the democratically elected Russian Constituent Assembly due to a number of reasons. They cited the outdated voter-rolls which did not acknowledge the split among the Socialist Revolutionary party and the assemblies conflict with the Russian Congress of the Soviets as an alternative democratic structure.

A similar analysis is present in more recent works such as those of Graeme Gill, who argues that &quot;[Stalinism was] not a natural flow-on of earlier developments; [it formed a] sharp break resulting from conscious decisions by leading political actors.&quot; However, Gill notes that &quot;difficulties with the use of the term reflect problems with the concept of Stalinism itself. The major difficulty is a lack of agreement about what should constitute Stalinism.&quot; Revisionist historians such as Sheila Fitzpatrick have criticized the focus on the upper levels of society and the use of Cold War concepts such as totalitarianism, obscuring the system&#x27;s reality.

Russian historian Vadim Rogovin stated that &quot;Under Lenin, the freedom to express a real variety of opinions existed in the party, and in carrying out political decisions, consideration was given to the positions of not only the majority, but a minority in the party&quot;. He compared this practice with subsequent leadership blocs which violated party tradition, ignored proposals of opponents and expelled the Opposition from the party on falsified charges which culminated with the Moscow Trials of 1936–1938. According to Rogovin, 80-90% of the members of the Central Committee elected at the Sixth through to the Seventeenth Congresses were physically annihilated.

The Right Opposition and Left Opposition have been held by some scholars as representing political alternatives to Stalinism despite their shared beliefs in Leninism due to their policy platforms which were at variance with Stalin. This ranged from areas related to economics, foreign policy and cultural matters.

=== Left-wing criticism ===
As a form of Marxism, revolutionary Leninism was criticised as an undemocratic interpretation of socialism. In &quot;The Nationalities Question in the Russian Revolution&quot; (1918), Rosa Luxemburg criticised the Bolsheviks for the suppression of the All Russian Constituent Assembly (January 1918); the partitioning of the feudal estates to the peasant communes; and the right of self-determination of every national people of the Russias. That the strategic (geopolitical) mistakes of the Bolsheviks would create significant dangers for the Russian Revolution, such as the bureaucratisation that would arise to administrate the large country that was Bolshevik Russia. In defence of the expedient revolutionary practice, in &quot;&quot;Left-Wing&quot; Communism: An Infantile Disorder&quot; (1920), Lenin dismissed the political and ideological complaints of the anti-Bolshevik critics, who claimed ideologically correct stances that were to the political left of Lenin. In Marxist philosophy, left communism is a range of left-wing political perspectives among communists. Left communism criticizes the Bolshevik Party&#x27;s ideology as the revolutionary vanguard. Ideologically, left communists present their perspectives and approaches as authentic Marxism and thus more oriented to the proletariat than the Leninism of the Communist International at their first (1919) and second (1920) congresses. Proponents of left communism include Amadeo Bordiga, Herman Gorter, Paul Mattick, Sylvia Pankhurst, Antonie Pannekoek and Otto Rühle.

Historically, the Dutch-German communist left has been most critical of Lenin and Leninism, yet the Italian communist left remained Leninist. Bordiga said: &quot;All this work of demolishing opportunism and &#x27;deviationism&#x27; (Lenin: &quot;What Is To Be Done?&quot;) is today the basis of party activity. The party follows revolutionary tradition and experiences in this work during these periods of revolutionary reflux and the proliferation of opportunist theories, which had as their violent and inflexible opponents Marx, Engels, Lenin, and the Italian Left.&quot; In &quot;The Lenin Legend&quot; (1935), Paul Mattick said that the council communist tradition, begun by the Dutch-German leftists, also is critical of Leninism. Contemporary left-communist organisations, such as the Internationalist Communist Tendency and the International Communist Current, view Lenin as an essential and influential theorist but remain critical of Leninism as political praxis for the proletarian revolution.

Nonetheless, the Bordigism of the International Communist Party abides Bordiga&#x27;s strict Leninism. Ideologically aligned with the Dutch-German left, among the ideologists of contemporary communisation, the theorist Gilles Dauvé criticised Leninism as a &quot;by-product of Kautskyism&quot;. In &quot;The Soviet Union Versus Socialism&quot; (1986), Noam Chomsky said that Stalinism was the logical development of Leninism and not an ideological deviation from Lenin&#x27;s policies, which resulted in collectivisation enforced with a police state. In light of the tenets of socialism, Leninism was a right-wing deviation from Marxism.

The vanguard-party revolution of Leninism became the ideological basis of the communist parties in the socialist political spectrum. In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party organised itself with Maoism (the Thought of Mao Zedong), socialism with Chinese characteristics. In Singapore, the People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) featured internal democracy and initiated single-party dominance in the government and politics of Singapore. In the event, the practical application of Maoism to the socio-economic conditions of Third World countries produced revolutionary vanguard parties, such as the Communist Party of Peru – Red Fatherland.

<text>The Legion of Merit (LOM) is a military award of the United States Armed Forces that is given for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services and achievements. The decoration is issued to members of the eight uniformed services of the United States as well as to military and political figures of foreign governments.

The Legion of Merit (Commander degree) is one of only two United States military decorations to be issued as a neck order (the other being the Medal of Honor), and the only United States military decoration that may be issued in degrees (much like an order of chivalry or certain orders of merit), although the degrees including a neck ribbon are only awarded to non-U.S. nationals.

The Legion of Merit is seventh in the order of precedence of all U.S. military awards and is worn after the Defense Superior Service Medal and before the Distinguished Flying Cross. In contemporary use in the U.S. Armed Forces, the Legion of Merit is typically awarded to Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Space Force general officers and colonels, and Navy and Coast Guard flag officers and captains occupying senior command or very senior staff positions in their respective services. It may also be awarded to officers of lesser rank, senior warrant officers (typically in command positions at the rank of chief warrant officer 5), and to very senior enlisted personnel (typically in the rank of command sergeant major and Sergeant Major of the Army in the Army, fleet master chief petty officer and Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy in the Navy, command chief master sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force in the Air Force, command chief master sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant of the Space Force in the Space Force, and Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps in the Marine Corps), but these instances are less frequent, typically by exception, and the circumstances vary by branch of service.

Authority to award the Legion of Merit is reserved for general officers and flag officers in pay grade O-9 (i.e., lieutenant general, vice admiral) and above, civilian Department of Defense personnel at assistant service secretary or Assistant Secretary of Defense level and above, or equivalent secretary-level civilian personnel with the Department of Homeland Security with direct oversight of the U.S. Coast Guard.

==Criteria==
The degrees of Chief Commander, Commander, Officer, and Legionnaire are awarded only to members of armed forces of foreign nations under the criteria outlined in Army Regulation 672-7 and is based on the relative rank or position of the recipient as follows:

:#Chief Commander: Head of state or government. However, this degree was awarded by President Roosevelt to some Allied World War II theater commanders, usually for joint amphibious landings or invasions. (The President had this power under of October 29, 1942, paragraph 3b.)
:#Commander: Equivalent of a U.S. military chief of staff or higher position, but not to a head of state.
:#Officer: General or flag officer below the equivalent of a U.S. military chief of staff; colonel or equivalent rank (e.g., Navy or Coast Guard captain) for service in assignments equivalent to those normally held by a general or flag officer in U.S. military service; or military attachés.
:#Legionnaire: All recipients not included above.

When the Legion of Merit is awarded to members of the uniformed services of the United States, it is awarded without reference to degree. The criteria are &quot;for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services and achievements&quot; and is typically reserved for senior officers at O-6 level and above, typically in connection with senior leadership/command positions or other senior positions of significant responsibility.

* The performance must have been such as to merit recognition of key individuals for service rendered in a clearly exceptional manner.
* Performance of duties normal to the grade, branch, specialty, or assignment, and experience of an individual is not an adequate basis for this award.
* For service not related to actual war, the term &quot;key individual&quot; applies to a narrower range of positions than in time of war and requires evidence of significant achievement.
* In peacetime, service should be in the nature of a special requirement or of an extremely difficult duty performed in an unprecedented and clearly exceptional manner.
* However, justification of the award may accrue by virtue of exceptionally meritorious service in a succession of important positions.

The degrees and the design of the decoration were influenced by the French Legion of Honour (&quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;).

==History==

===World War II===

Although recommendations for creation of a medal for meritorious service were initiated as early as September 1937, no formal action was taken toward approval.

In a letter to the Quartermaster General (QMG) dated December 24, 1941, the Adjutant General formally requested action be initiated to create a meritorious service medal, and provide designs in the event the decoration was established. Proposed designs prepared by Bailey, Banks, and Biddle, and the Office of the Quartermaster General were provided to the Assistant Chief of Staff for Personnel (Colonel Heard) by the QMG on January 5, 1942.

The Assistant Chief of Staff (G-1), Brigadier General John H. Hilldring, in a response to the QMG on April 3, 1942, indicated the Secretary of War had approved the design recommended by the QMG. The design of the Legion of Merit (change of name) would be ready for issue immediately after legislation authorizing it was enacted into law. (A separate medal called the Meritorious Service Medal was established in 1969.)

An act of Congress (Public Law 671, 77th Congress, Chapter 508, 2d Session) on July 20, 1942, established the Legion of Merit and provided that the medal &quot;shall have suitable appurtenances and devices and not more than four degrees, and which the President, under such rules and regulations as he shall prescribe, may award to
:(a) personnel of the Armed Forces of the United States and of the Government of the Commonwealth Philippines and
:(b) personnel of the armed forces of friendly foreign nations who, since the proclamation of an emergency by the President on 1939-09-08, shall have distinguished themselves by exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services.&quot;

The medal was announced in War Department Bulletin No. 40, dated August 5, 1942. Executive Order 9260, dated October 29, 1942, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, established the rules for the Legion of Merit, and required the President&#x27;s approval for the award.

Following the invasion of North Africa in November 1942, a number of United States officers were awarded the Legion of Merit in the degree of Officer. One of the recipients was future Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Lyman Lemnitzer. Soon after, regulations for the award of the Legion of Merit were revised so that it would not be awarded in the degrees above Legionnaire to United States military personnel.

The Legion of Merit is similar to the French Legion of Honor in both its design, a five-armed cross, and in that it is awarded in multiple degrees. Unlike the Legion of Honor, however, the Legion of Merit is only awarded to military personnel. In addition, it is the only award in the world with multiple degrees of which the higher degrees cannot be awarded to citizens of the country of the award&#x27;s origin.

In October 1942, Brazilian Army Brigadier General Amaro Soares Bittencourt became the first person awarded the Legion of Merit (Commander) and a week later, Lieutenant, junior grade Ann A. Bernatitus, a U.S. Navy Nurse Corps officer, became the first member of the United States Armed Forces and the first woman to receive the Legion of Merit. She received the award for her service during the defense of the Philippines. LTJG Bernatitus was also the first recipient of the Legion of Merit authorized to wear a Combat &quot;V&quot; with the medal.

General Dwight D. Eisenhower was presented the Legion of Merit by President Roosevelt while he was en route to the Tehran Conference, in Cairo, Egypt, on November 26, 1943.

In 1943, at the request of the Army Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall, approval authority for U.S. personnel was delegated to the Department of War. Executive Order 10600, dated March 15, 1955, by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, again revised approval authority. Current provisions are contained in Title 10, United States Code 1121. As a result, awarding authority for the Legion of Merit resides with general officers/flag officers at the Lieutenant General / Vice Admiral level or higher.

The U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, unlike the Army and later the Air Force, provided for the Legion of Merit to be awarded with a &quot;V&quot; device indicating awards for participation in combat operations.

From 1942 to 1944, the Legion of Merit was awarded for a fairly wide range of achievements. This was because it was, until the establishment of the Bronze Star Medal in 1944, the only decoration below the Silver Star which could be awarded for combat valor, and the only decoration below the Distinguished Service Medal which could be awarded for meritorious noncombat service.

===After World War II===

After the establishment of the Bronze Star Medal (BSM) in February 1944, the Legion of Merit was awarded almost exclusively to senior officers in the rank of lieutenant colonel (Army, Marine Corps and Air Force) or commander (Navy and Coast Guard) (O-5), and above. Beginning in the 1980s, the Legion of Merit began to be awarded more frequently to senior-ranking warrant officers (W-4 and W-5), as well as to senior enlisted service members (E-8 and E-9), usually as a retirement award. When not awarded as a retirement award, it is most commonly awarded to officers in pay grade O-6 and higher.

The Meritorious Service Medal (MSM) was established in 1969 as a &quot;junior&quot; version of the Legion of Merit and prior to 2003 was only awarded for non-combat service. The MSM is awarded more frequently, and to more lower-ranking military personnel, than the Legion of Merit. Recipients of the MSM are usually in pay grades E-7 through E-9, W-3 through W-5 (Army Only), and O-4 through O-6 for the Army, Air Force, and Space Force; for the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard the MSM is usually presented to those in pay grades E-9, W-4, W-5, O-5 and O-6.

==Insignia==
*The Chief Commander Degree of the Legion of Merit Medal is, on a wreath of green laurel joined at the bottom by a gold bow-knot (rosette), a domed five-pointed white star bordered crimson, points reversed with v-shaped extremities tipped with a gold ball. In the center, a blue disk encircled by gold clouds, with 13 white stars arranged in the pattern that appears on the Great Seal of the United States. Between each point, within the wreath are crossed arrows pointing outwards. The overall width is . The words &quot;UNITED STATES OF AMERICA&quot; are engraved in the center of the reverse. A miniature of the decoration in gold on a horizontal gold bar is worn on the service ribbon.
*The Commander Degree of the Legion of Merit Medal is, on a wreath of green laurel joined at the bottom by a gold bow-knot (rosette), a five-pointed white star bordered crimson, points reversed with v-shaped extremities tipped with a gold ball. In the center, a blue disk encircled by gold clouds, with 13 white stars arranged in the pattern that appears on the Great Seal of the United States. Between each star point, within the wreath, are crossed war arrows pointing outwards, representing armed protection to the Nation. The overall width is . A gold laurel wreath in the v-shaped angle at the top connects an oval suspension ring to the neck ribbon that is in width. The reverse of the five-pointed star is enameled in white, and the border is crimson. In the center, a disk for engraving the name of the recipient surrounded by the words &quot;ANNUIT COEPTIS MDCCLXXXII&quot;: a combination of the motto from the Great Seal, &quot;He [God] Has Favored Our Undertakings&quot;, with the date for the first award of a US decoration, the Purple Heart. An outer scroll contains the words &quot;UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.&quot; A miniature of the decoration in silver on a horizontal silver bar is worn on the service ribbon.

:The neck ribbon for the degree of Commander is wide and consists of the following stripes: white 67101; center crimson and white.

*The Officer Degree of the Legion of Merit Medal is similar to the degree of Commander except the overall width is and the pendant has a suspension ring instead of the wreath for attaching the ribbon. A gold replica of the medal, wide, is centered on the suspension ribbon.
*The Legionnaire Degree of the Legion of Merit Medal and the Legion of Merit Medal issued to U.S. personnel is the same as the degree of Officer, except the suspension ribbon does not have the medal replica.

The ribbon for all of the decorations is wide and consists of the following stripes: white; center crimson; and white. The reverse of all of the medals has the motto taken from the Great Seal of the United States, &quot;&quot; (&quot;He [God] has favored our undertakings&quot;) and the date &quot;&quot; (1782), which is the date of America&#x27;s first decoration, the Badge of Military Merit, now known as the Purple Heart. The ribbon design also follows the pattern of the Purple Heart ribbon.

;Additional awards

Additional awards of the Legion of Merit are denoted by oak leaf clusters (in the Army, Air Force, and Space Force), and by gold stars (in the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard). Until 2017, the sea services (the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard) awarded the Combat &quot;V&quot; for wear on the LOM. The Army, Air Force, and Space Force do not authorize the &quot;V&quot; device for the Legion of Merit.

<doc id="18692" wikidata="Q1727373" url="?curid=18692" title="Lint (software)">
<text>Lint is the computer science term for a static code analysis tool used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs. The term originates from a Unix utility that examined C language source code. A program which performs this function is also known as a &quot;linter&quot;.

==History==

Stephen C. Johnson, a computer scientist at Bell Labs, came up with the term &quot;lint&quot; in 1978 while debugging the yacc grammar he was writing for C and dealing with portability issues stemming from porting Unix to a 32-bit machine. The term was borrowed from the word lint, the tiny bits of fiber and fluff shed by clothing, as the command he wrote would act like a lint trap in a clothes dryer, capturing waste fibers while leaving whole fabrics intact. In 1979, lint programming was used outside of Bell Labs for the first time, in the seventh version (V7) of Unix.

Over the years, different versions of lint have been developed for many C and C++ compilers, and while modern-day compilers have lint-like functions, lint-like tools have also advanced their capabilities. For example, Gimpel&#x27;s PC-Lint, introduced in 1985 and used to analyze C++ source code, is still for sale.

==Overview==
In his original 1978 paper Johnson stated his reasoning in creating a separate program to detect errors, distinct from that which it analyzed: &quot;...the general notion of having two programs is a good one&quot; [because they concentrate on different things, thereby allowing the programmer to] &quot;concentrate at one stage of the programming process solely on the algorithms, data structures, and correctness of the program, and then later retrofit, with the aid of lint, the desirable properties of universality and portability&quot;.

== Successor linters ==
The analysis performed by lint-like tools can also be performed by an optimizing compiler, which aims to generate faster code. Even though modern compilers have evolved to include many of lint&#x27;s historical functions, lint-like tools have also evolved to detect an even wider variety of suspicious constructs. These include &quot;warnings about syntax errors, uses of undeclared variables, calls to deprecated functions, spacing and formatting conventions, misuse of scope, implicit fallthrough in switch statements, missing license headers, [and]...dangerous language features&quot;.

Lint-like tools are especially useful for dynamically typed languages like JavaScript and Python. Because the interpreters of such languages typically do not enforce as many and as strict rules during execution, linter tools can also be used as simple debuggers for finding common errors (e.g. syntactic discrepancies) as well as hard-to-find errors such as heisenbugs (drawing attention to suspicious code as &quot;possible errors&quot;). Lint-like tools generally perform static analysis of source code.

Lint-like tools have also been developed for other aspects of software development, such as enforcing grammar and style guides for given language source code. Some tools (such as ESLint) also allow rules to be auto-fixable: a rule definition can also come with the definition of a transform that resolves the warning. Rules about style are especially likely to come with an auto-fix. If the linter is run in &quot;fix all&quot; mode on a file that triggers only rules about formatting, the linter will act just like a formatter.

<doc id="18694" wikidata="Q615223" url="?curid=18694" title="Livebearers">
<text>Livebearers are fish that retain their eggs inside the body and give birth to live, free-swimming young. They are especially prized by aquarium owners. Among aquarium fish, livebearers are nearly all members of the family Poeciliidae and include: guppies, mollies, platies and swordtails.

The advantages of livebearing to the aquarist are that the newborn juvenile fish are larger than newly-hatched fry, have a lower chance of mortality and are easier to care for. Unusual livebearers include seahorses and pipefish, where the males care for the young, and certain cichlids that are mouthbrooders, with the parent incubating the eggs in the buccal cavity.

==Common aquarium livebearers==
Species of interest to aquarists are almost always members of the family Poeciliidae, most commonly guppies, mollies, platies, swordtails, Endler&#x27;s livebearer, and mosquitofish. Most of these are ovoviviparous, with the developing embryos receiving no nourishment from the parent fish, but a few are viviparous, receiving food from the maternal blood supply. 

Because the newborn fish are large compared to the fry of oviparous fish, which are those that lay eggs, newborn fish of livebearers are easier to feed than the fry of egg-laying species, such as characins and cichlids. This makes them much easier to raise, and for this reason, aquarists often recommend them for beginning fish breeder hobbyists. The larger livebearer fry makes them far less vulnerable to predation, as the parents often eat fry if hungry. With the sufficient cover in the way of plants or porous objects, they can sometimes mature in a community tank.

==Ovoviviparous and viviparous fish compared==
Most of the Poeciliidae are ovoviviparous, that is, while the eggs are retained inside the body of the female for protection, the eggs are essentially independent of the mother and she does not provide them with any nutrients. In contrast, fish such as splitfins and halfbeaks are viviparous, with the eggs receiving food from the maternal blood supply through structures analogous to the placenta of placental mammals.

==Aberrant livebearers and mouthbrooders==
Seahorses and pipefish can be defined as livebearers, although in these cases the males incubate the eggs rather than the females. In many cases, the eggs are dependent on the male for oxygen and nutrition so these fish can be further defined as viviparous livebearers. 

Many cichlids are mouthbrooders, with the female (or more rarely the male) incubating the eggs in the mouth. Compared with other cichlids, these species produce fewer but bigger eggs, and when they emerge, the fry is better developed and has higher survivability. Because the eggs are protected from the environment but do not absorb nutrients from the parent, this condition is analogous to, though not identical with, ovoviviparity.

<doc id="18695" wikidata="Q1235116" url="?curid=18695" title="Lupercal">
<text>The Lupercal (from Latin &quot;&quot; &quot;female wolf&quot;) was a cave at the southwest foot of the Palatine Hill in Rome, located somewhere between the temple of Magna Mater and the Sant&#x27;Anastasia al Palatino. In the legend of the founding of Rome, Romulus and Remus were found there by the she-wolf who suckled them until they were rescued by the shepherd Faustulus. Luperci, the priests of Faunus, celebrated certain ceremonies of the Lupercalia at the cave, from the earliest days of the City until at least 494 AD.

==Modern discovery==

In January 2007, Italian archaeologist Irene Iacopi announced that she had probably found the legendary cave beneath the remains of Emperor Augustus&#x27;s house, the &quot;Domus Livia&quot;, on the Palatine. Archaeologists came across the 15-meter-deep cavity while working to restore the decaying palace.

On 20 November 2007, the first set of photos were released showing the vault of the grotto which is encrusted with colourful mosaics, pumice stones and seashells. The center of the ceiling features a depiction of a white eagle, the symbol of the Roman Empire. Archaeologists had not yet found the grotto&#x27;s entrance, so they continued looking.
Its location below Augustus&#x27; residence was thought to be significant; Octavian, before he became Augustus, had considered taking the name Romulus to indicate that he intended to found Rome anew.

===Opposing opinions===
Adriano La Regina (formerly Rome&#x27;s archaeological superintendent 1976–2004, professor of Etruscology at Sapienza University of Rome), Professor Fausto Zevi (professor of Roman Archaeology at Rome&#x27;s La Sapienza University) and Professor Henner von Hesberg (head of the German Archaeological Institute, Rome) denied the identification of the grotto with Lupercal on topographic and stylistic grounds. They concluded that the grotto is actually a nymphaeum or underground triclinium from Neronian times. The current scholarly consensus is that the grotto is not the Lupercal and that the cave was located lower southwest, closer to piazza Sant&#x27;Anastasia al Palatino.

<text>Limp Bizkit is an American nu metal band from Jacksonville, Florida. Its lineup consists of lead vocalist Fred Durst, drummer John Otto, guitarist Wes Borland, turntablist DJ Lethal and bassist Sam Rivers. The band&#x27;s musical style is marked by Durst&#x27;s angry vocal delivery and Borland&#x27;s sonic experimentation. Borland&#x27;s elaborate visual appearance, which includes face and body paint, masks, and uniforms, also plays a large role in Limp Bizkit&#x27;s live shows. The band has been nominated for three Grammy Awards, sold 40 million records worldwide, and won several other awards.

Formed in 1994, Limp Bizkit became popular playing in the Jacksonville underground music scene in the late 1990s, and signed with Flip Records (with distribution from Interscope), who released the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all&quot; (1997). The band achieved mainstream success with its second and third studio albums, &quot;Significant Other&quot; (1999) and &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot; (2000). However, this success was marred by a series of controversies surrounding its performances at Woodstock &#x27;99 and the 2001 Big Day Out festival.

Borland left the group in 2001, but Durst, Rivers, Otto, and Lethal continued to record and tour with guitarist Mike Smith. Following the release of their fourth album &quot;Results May Vary&quot; (2003), Borland rejoined the band and recorded the EP &quot;The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)&quot; (2005) with Durst, Rivers, Lethal, and drummer Sammy Siegler before entering a hiatus. In 2009, the band reunited with Borland playing guitar and began touring, culminating with the recording of the album &quot;Gold Cobra&quot; (2011), after which it left Interscope and later signed with Cash Money Records; DJ Lethal quit the band soon afterward, returning in 2018. After years of teasing an album tentatively titled &quot;Stampede of the Disco Elephants&quot;, the band released its sixth studio album &quot;Still Sucks&quot; on October 31, 2021.

The band has released 26 singles, the most notable of which include &quot;Nookie&quot;, &quot;Re-Arranged&quot;, &quot;Break Stuff&quot;, &quot;Take a Look Around&quot;, &quot;Rollin&#x27; (Air Raid Vehicle)&quot;, &quot;My Generation&quot;, &quot;My Way&quot;, &quot;Eat You Alive&quot;, and their cover of The Who&#x27;s 1971 single &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot;, all of which have charted within the top 20 of the US Alternative Airplay Chart.

== History ==

=== Formation and early years (1994–1996) ===

While growing up in Gastonia, North Carolina, Fred Durst took an interest in breakdancing, hip hop, punk rock, and heavy metal. He began to rap, skate, beatbox, and DJ.

While mowing lawns and working as a tattoo artist, he developed an idea for a band that combined elements of rock and hip hop. Durst played with three other bands: Split 26, Malachi Sage (both of which were unsuccessful), and 10 Foot Shindig, which Durst left to form a new band. Durst told Sam Rivers, the bassist for Malachi Sage, &quot;You need to quit this band and start a band with me that&#x27;s like this: rappin&#x27; and rockin&#x27;.&quot; Rivers suggested that John Otto, who was studying jazz drumming at the Douglas Anderson School of the Arts and playing in local avant garde bands, become the band&#x27;s drummer. Durst, Rivers, and Otto jammed and wrote three songs together and after brief stints with guitarists Rob Waters and Terry Balsamo, Wes Borland joined as their permanent guitarist.

Durst named the band &quot;Limp Bizkit&quot; because he wanted a name that would repel listeners. According to Durst, &quot;The name is there to turn people&#x27;s heads away. A lot of people pick up the disc and go, &#x27;Limp Bizkit. Oh, they must suck.&#x27; Those are the people that we don&#x27;t even want listening to our music.&quot; Fred said that the band liked quirky and corny things and that they didn&#x27;t take themselves seriously all the time, and thus the name &quot;Limp Bizkit&quot; represented these characteristics and the band as a whole. Other names that were considered by Durst included Gimp Disco, Split Dickslit, Bitch Piglet, and Blood Fart. Every record label that showed an interest in the band pressured its members to change its name.

Limp Bizkit developed a cult following in the underground music scene, particularly at the Milk Bar, an underground punk club in Jacksonville. The band&#x27;s local popularity was such that Sugar Ray, who had a major label contract, opened for a then-unsigned Limp Bizkit at Velocity with hip hop group Funkdoobiest. Milkbar owner Danny Wimmer stated that Limp Bizkit &quot;had the biggest draw for a local band. They went from playing [for] ten people to eight hundred within months. Fred ... was always marketing the band. He would go to record stores and get people involved, he was in touch with high schools.&quot; However, the band knew that to achieve national success, it would have to distinguish themselves in its live performances. Attracting crowds by word of mouth, the band gave energetic live performances, covering George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Faith&quot; and Paula Abdul&#x27;s &quot;Straight Up&quot; and featuring Borland in bizarre costumes. Borland&#x27;s theatrical rock style was the primary attraction for many concert attendees.

Durst unsuccessfully tried to attract attention from A&amp;R representatives at various labels by pretending to be the band&#x27;s manager. Later when Korn performed in town as the opening act for Sick of It All, Durst invited Korn to drink beer and tattoo them. Although Durst&#x27;s tattoos were unimpressive, he was able to persuade Reginald &quot;Fieldy&quot; Arvizu to listen to a demo, consisting of the songs &quot;Pollution&quot;, &quot;Counterfeit&quot;, and &quot;Stalemate&quot;. Korn added a then-unsigned Limp Bizkit to two tours, which exposed the band to a new audience. The band attempted to expand its sound by auditioning an additional guitarist, but Borland soon determined that another guitarist was not the answer and DJ Lethal, formerly of the hip hop group House of Pain, joined the band as a turntablist after a successful practice performance. Joining the band gave Lethal an opportunity to experiment with his turntable technique in ways that hip hop had not allowed him to do, helping shape the band&#x27;s style. Due to creative differences, Borland left the band at this point.

=== Record label deals and &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all&quot; (1997–1998) ===
After its performance opening for Korn at the Dragonfly in Hollywood was well received, Limp Bizkit were offered a record deal with the Los Angeles-based independent label Flip Records, who attempted to sign the band for $50,000. Soon after that, however, they were also offered a record deal with the major label Mojo, a subsidiary of MCA Records. According to Flip Records&#x27; founder Jordan Schur, Limp Bizkit stated that the only way the band would not sign with Mojo was if the band&#x27;s van flipped over on the way to Los Angeles.

While heading to California to record its first album, the band&#x27;s van flipped over five times, resulting in all of the band&#x27;s members sustaining serious injuries. As a result of the near-death experience, Durst made amends with Borland, who rejoined the band. The accident also strained the band&#x27;s relationship with Mojo, who Durst felt wanted the band to resume working prematurely, resulting in Schur buying out the band&#x27;s record and management contract and signing the band to Flip, which cost him $175,000.

Arvizu persuaded Ross Robinson to listen to the demo. Robinson neglected to listen to it until it was appraised by his girlfriend. Impressed by the band&#x27;s motivation and sound, Robinson produced Limp Bizkit&#x27;s debut, which was recorded at Indigo Ranch. Durst&#x27;s problems with his girlfriend inspired him to write the song &quot;Sour&quot;. The mood and tone set by Robinson in the studio allowed the band to improvise; a recording of the band improvising appeared as the last track on the album, &quot;Everything&quot;. Schur bankrolled the recording sessions for the album, and following its completion negotiated a 50/50 agreement with Interscope Records to distribute the album.

Despite the success of live performances of the band&#x27;s cover of the song &quot;Faith&quot;, Robinson was opposed to recording it and tried to persuade the band not to play it on the album. However, the final recording, which incorporated heavier guitar playing and drumming as well as DJ scratching, impressed him. Robinson also bonded with Borland, who he perceived as not taking the band seriously. The progressive metal band Tool provided a strong influence in shaping the album&#x27;s sound, particularly in the song &quot;Nobody Loves Me&quot;, which contains a breakdown in which Durst imitated the singing style of Maynard James Keenan.

Continuing the band&#x27;s policy of using names that would repulse potential listeners, Limp Bizkit named the album by using part of the phrase &quot;queer as a three dollar bill&quot; and adding the word &quot;Y&#x27;all&quot; for Florida flavor, titling it &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all&quot;. The completed album featured an abrasive, angry sound which Limp Bizkit used to attract listeners to its music.

After the band completed recording, it toured with Korn and Helmet in 1997. Critics reacted unfavorably to performances of Korn and Limp Bizkit; &quot;Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel&quot; music critic Jon M. Gilbertson criticized Durst&#x27;s performance, stating &quot;The one attention-grabbing moment of Limp Bizkit&#x27;s rap/thrash show was when the lead singer expressed a desire for gay men to be &#x27;stomped&#x27;. Which isn&#x27;t remotely rebellious. It&#x27;s just puerile.&quot; That same year, they also notably served as an opening act on the Album of the Year Tour for Faith No More, a band often credited as paving the way for Limp Bizkit and the nu metal genre. They were subject to a hostile reception from Faith No More&#x27;s fans, with the group&#x27;s keyboardist Roddy Bottum later recalling, &quot;That guy Fred Durst had a really bad attitude. He was kind of a jerk. I remembered he called the audience faggots at one show when they booed him. Not a good scene.&quot;

Interscope proposed to the band that the label pay $5,000 to guarantee that a Portland, Oregon, radio station play the song &quot;Counterfeit&quot; fifty times, preceded and concluded with an announcement that the air time was paid for by Interscope. The paid air time was criticized by the media, who saw it as &quot;payola&quot;. The band&#x27;s manager Jeff Kwatinetz later termed the plan as a &quot;brilliant marketing move&quot;. Durst stated, &quot;It worked, but it&#x27;s not that cool of a thing.&quot;

Following the release of &quot;Counterfeit&quot; as a single, &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Yall&quot; was released on July 1, 1997, and was met with minimal response. AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, &quot;They might not have many original ideas ... but they do the sound well. They have a powerful rhythm section and memorable hooks, most of which make up for the uneven songwriting.&quot; However, Robert Christgau panned the album. Despite the minimal response to his band&#x27;s album, Durst was appointed Senior Vice President of A&amp;R at Interscope.

Limp Bizkit joined the Warped Tour, performing alongside the bands Pennywise, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Sick of It All, Lagwagon, and Blink-182. Preceding the band&#x27;s first tour with DJ Lethal, Otto became familiar with Lethal&#x27;s contributions to collaborate with him better on stage. In addition to touring with Primus and Deftones, Limp Bizkit headlined the Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour, which was intended to diversify the band&#x27;s largely male fanbase by offering free tickets to female attendees. This plan successfully increased the band&#x27;s female fanbase.

In 1998, Limp Bizkit toured with Soulfly and Cold on Soulfly&#x27;s first European tour. Touring consistently increased Limp Bizkit&#x27;s success and the second single from &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all&quot;, a cover of George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Faith&quot;, became a successful radio hit, leading to a slot on Ozzfest, a tour organized by Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne. In July, Snot singer Lynn Strait was arrested after he emerged nude from Limp Bizkit&#x27;s prop toilet, and was charged with indecent exposure. Because Limp Bizkit&#x27;s fans would often break through the barricades, the band was almost kicked off the tour after two days. In August, John Otto spent the night in jail in Auburn Hills, Michigan on a misdemeanor charge of carrying a concealed weapon after allegedly firing a BB gun and being arrested for carrying a switchblade.

After completing Ozzfest, Limp Bizkit took a break from performing and later performed on Korn&#x27;s Family Values Tour. Durst also directed a music video for the band&#x27;s single &quot;Faith&quot; in promotion for its appearance in the film &quot;Very Bad Things&quot;, but was unsatisfied with it and directed a second video which paid tribute to tourmates like Primus, Deftones, and Korn, who appeared in the video. Borland stated in an interview that George Michael, the song&#x27;s writer, hated the cover and &quot;hates us for doing it&quot;.

=== &quot;Significant Other&quot; (1999–2000) ===
Following the radio success of &quot;Faith&quot;, the band was determined to record the follow-up to its first album in order to show that they were not a Korn soundalike or a cover band; the band began writing an album which dealt with issues deriving from its newfound fame. Terry Date, who had produced albums for Pantera, White Zombie and Deftones, was chosen to produce the album. The band allowed Durst and Lethal to explore their hip hop origins by recording a song with Method Man. The song was originally titled &quot;Shut the Fuck Up&quot;, but was retitled &quot;N 2 Gether Now&quot; for marketing purposes. Durst also recorded with Eminem, but the collaboration, &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot;, was left off the album. The album also featured guest appearances by Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland, Korn&#x27;s Jonathan Davis, Staind singer Aaron Lewis, and interludes by Les Claypool and Matt Pinfield.

&quot;Significant Other&quot; saw Limp Bizkit reaching a new level of commercial success; the band was featured on the covers of popular music magazines including &quot;Spin&quot; and now found themselves repeatedly mobbed for autographs; the band was allowed to interact directly with its fans on a website established by Dike 99. Durst also moved from Jacksonville to Los Angeles. &quot;Significant Other&quot; was seen as an improvement over its debut and was generally well received by critics with mixed-to-positive reviews. However, the band also continued to be criticized by the media; an article profiling the band in &quot;Spin&quot; and discussing &quot;Significant Other&quot; claimed that &quot;Limp Bizkit had yet to write a good song&quot;, and musicians Marilyn Manson and Trent Reznor criticized the band.

The band promoted the album by playing unannounced concerts in Detroit and Chicago as radio stations received a strong number of requests for the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Nookie&quot;. &quot;Significant Other&quot; climbed to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 643,874 copies in its first week of release. In its second week of release the album sold an additional 335,000 copies.

On the opening night of the band&#x27;s Limptropolis tour with Kid Rock, Sam Rivers smashed his bass in frustration over the venue&#x27;s poor sound, cutting his hand. After his hand was stitched up at a hospital, Rivers returned to finish the set. On July 12, Durst allegedly kicked a security guard in the head during a performance in St. Paul, Minnesota and was later arrested on assault charges. Further criticisms of the band appeared in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;New York Times&quot; writer Ann Powers wrote, &quot;DJ Lethal used his turntables as a metal guitar, riffing expansively and going for effects instead of rhythm. John Otto on drums and Sam Rivers on bass never even tried to get funky, instead steering hip-hop&#x27;s break-beat-based structure into a backbone for power chords. This makes for a hybrid that would be more interesting if the band did not constantly mire itself in boring tempos, and if Mr. Durst had any talent as a singer&quot;.

In the summer of 1999, Limp Bizkit played at the highly anticipated Woodstock &#x27;99 show in front of approximately 200,000 people. Violent action sprang up during and after the band&#x27;s performance, including fans tearing plywood from the walls during a performance of the song &quot;Break Stuff&quot;. Several sexual assaults were also reported in the concert&#x27;s aftermath . Durst stated during the concert, &quot;People are getting hurt. Don&#x27;t let anybody get hurt. But I don&#x27;t think you should mellow out. That&#x27;s what Alanis Morissette had you motherfuckers do. If someone falls, pick &#x27;em up. We already let the negative energy out. Now we wanna let out the positive energy&quot;. Durst later stated in an interview, &quot;I didn&#x27;t see anybody getting hurt. You don&#x27;t see that. When you&#x27;re looking out on a sea of people and the stage is twenty feet in the air and you&#x27;re performing, and you&#x27;re feeling your music, how do they expect us to see something bad going on?&quot; Les Claypool told &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot;, &quot;Woodstock was just Durst being Durst. His attitude is &#x27;no press is bad press&#x27;, so he brings it on himself. He wallows in it. Still, he&#x27;s a great guy.&quot; Jonathan Davis of Korn also defended the band: &quot;I think Bizkit is being blamed for it because they were the heavy band … I don&#x27;t think it was their fuckin&#x27; fault&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s easy to point the finger and blame [us], but they hired us for what we do — and all we did is what we do. I would turn the finger and point it back to the people that hired us,&quot; said Durst in reference to original Woodstock co-founder Michael Lang.

Durst saw the band as being scapegoated for the event&#x27;s controversy, and reflected on the criticisms surrounding the band in his music video for the single &quot;Re-Arranged&quot;, which depicted the band members receiving death sentences for their participation in the concerts. The video ended with angry witnesses watching as the band drowned in milk while performing the song. Durst later stated that the promoters of Woodstock &#x27;99 were at fault for booking his band due to their reputation for raucous performances.

Despite this controversy, &quot;Significant Other&quot; remained at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, and the band headlined the year&#x27;s Family Values Tour. Durst directed a music video for &quot;N 2 Gether Now&quot; which featured Method Man and Pauly Shore, and was inspired by Inspector Clouseau&#x27;s fights with his butler Cato Fong in the &quot;Pink Panther&quot; film series.

=== &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot; (2000–2001) ===

In 2000, Durst announced that the band&#x27;s third studio album would be titled &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot;. The press thought he was joking about this title. The album title is intended to sound like a fictional band; the phrase &quot;Chocolate Starfish&quot; refers to the human anus and Durst himself, who has frequently been called an &quot;asshole&quot;. Borland contributed the other half of the album&#x27;s title when the band was standing around at a truck stop looking at bottles of flavored water, and Borland joked that the truck stop didn&#x27;t have hot dog or meat-flavored water.

In June 2000, Limp Bizkit performed at the WXRK Dysfunctional Family Picnic, but showed up an hour late for their set. An Interscope spokesman stated that there was confusion over the band&#x27;s set time. During the band&#x27;s performance, Durst criticized Creed singer Scott Stapp, calling him &quot;an egomaniac&quot;. Creed&#x27;s representatives later presented Durst with an autographed anger management manual.

In the summer, Limp Bizkit&#x27;s tour was sponsored by the controversial file sharing service Napster, doing free shows with a metal cage as the only thing separating them from the audience. Durst was an outspoken advocate of file sharing. They also did a &quot;Guerrilla Tour&quot;, which involved the band setting up illegal and impromptu public gigs on rooftops and alleyways, some being shut down by the police.

During the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Durst performed &quot;Livin&#x27; It Up&quot;, a song from the upcoming album, as a duet with Christina Aguilera. In response to the performance, Filter frontman Richard Patrick was quoted as saying &quot;Fred getting onstage with Christina Aguilera embarrassed us all.&quot; In response to the negative reactions to the performance, Durst remarked, &quot;People always just wanna talk about Britney or Christina. What&#x27;s the problem? Because they make a type of music we aren&#x27;t allowed to like? Or you think they are the nemesis of what our music is about? Why segregate? Why be so musically fuckin&#x27; racist? What do you mean, I can&#x27;t hang out with these types of people? Clearly I didn&#x27;t give a fuck, which fed a lot of it, too. I mean, someone that&#x27;s not going to give in and apologise... it&#x27;s gonna make people carry on talking&quot;.

Durst also appeared in the music video for Eminem&#x27;s song &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;, a song in which Eminem suggests that Christina Aguilera and Durst had a sexual relationship. Durst denied the rumors and defended Aguilera, saying: &quot;For one thing, it&#x27;s not true, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me. [Eminem is] sort of answering the critics. He&#x27;s going to the extreme with everything he can to now slap them in the face... It&#x27;s so over-the-top. For one thing, Christina&#x27;s amazing. I really like that girl. I think she&#x27;s an amazing singer. She&#x27;s gonna have longevity. She&#x27;s going to be one of those amazing icon women. I&#x27;m really attracted to her, I like her, and I&#x27;ve talked to her a couple of times, and that&#x27;s that. I haven&#x27;t had any type of relationship with her, or any type of intercourse with her. She&#x27;s never sucked my dick, she&#x27;s never sucked Carson&#x27;s.&quot;

Released on October 17, &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot; set a record for highest first-week sales for a rock album, with over one million copies sold in the US in its first week of release. 400,000 of those sales happened during the first day, making it the fastest-selling rock album ever and breaking the record held for seven years by Pearl Jam&#x27;s &quot;Vs.&quot; &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot; was certified Gold, Platinum, and six times Multi-Platinum.

Limp Bizkit headlined the first Anger Management Tour edition that year with Eminem acting as co-headliner along with support from Papa Roach, Xzibit, D12 and later, Godsmack, DMX, Sinnistar. The tour lasted 35 dates from October 19 - December 19, 2000.

The album received mixed reviews, with AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing, &quot;Durst&#x27;s self-pitying and the monotonous music give away that the band bashed Chocolate Starfish out very quickly – it&#x27;s the sound of a band determined to deliver a sequel in a finite amount of time.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer David Browne named it as the worst album title of 2000, whilst readers of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine voted it the worst album of the year, as well as voting Limp Bizkit and Fred Durst as the worst band of 2000 and the &quot;Arse of the Year&quot;, respectively.

During a 2001 tour of Australia at the Big Day Out festival in Sydney, fans rushed the stage in the mosh pit and teenager Jessica Michalik died of asphyxiation. In court, Durst, represented by long-time attorney Ed McPherson, testified he had warned the concert&#x27;s organizers Aaron Jackson, Will Pearce, and Amar Tailor, as well as the concert&#x27;s promoter Vivian Lees, of the potential dangers of such minimal security. After viewing videotapes and hearing witness testimony, however, the coroner said it was evident that the crowd&#x27;s density was dangerous at the time Limp Bizkit took the stage, stating that Fred Durst should have acted more responsibly when the problem became apparent. Durst stated that he was &quot;emotionally scarred&quot; because of the teenager&#x27;s death. Durst also stated that he was aware of the security problems, but that he and the band were forced to play in the festival: &quot;There was a demand for us to play Big Day Out 2001, so we filled it. When we came to play we said, &quot;The barricades aren&#x27;t right – people are gonna go crazy so we&#x27;re not playing.&quot; And they go, &quot;No, you&#x27;re goddamn wrong. You are playing – you&#x27;re the headliners.&quot; And we go, &quot;No, you gotta have the right barricade.&quot; The promoters who owned Big Day Out at the time were rude. The police came and it turned into this huge thing, with them telling us, &quot;There&#x27;s gonna be a riot if you don&#x27;t play and if that happens, we&#x27;re arresting you&quot;.

Later in 2001, numerous hip-hop artists including P. Diddy, Timbaland, Bubba Sparxxx, and Everlast remixed famous songs from the band into hip-hop versions, adding their own styles and modifications. The album was called &quot;New Old Songs&quot;.

=== Departure of Borland and &quot;Results May Vary&quot; (2001–2003) ===

In October 2001, Durst released a statement on their website stating that &quot;Limp Bizkit and Wes Borland have amicably decided to part ways. Both Limp Bizkit and Borland will continue to pursue their respective musical careers. Both wish each other the best of luck in all future endeavors.&quot; Durst also stated that the band would &quot;comb the world for the illest guitar player known to man&quot; to replace Borland. When asked why Borland quit the band, Ross Robinson stated that he quit because &quot;He doesn&#x27;t sell out for money anymore&quot;.

Durst held a nationwide audition for a new guitarist called &quot;Put Your Guitar Where Your Mouth Is.&quot; However, Mike Henderson, who was one of the guitarists who went for the audition, revealed that the event was nothing more than a publicity stunt. Durst had no intention to recruit a new guitarist and the whole thing was intended to sell Guitar Center products. This caused an uproar amongst the guitarists who had been waiting for hours. The band eventually recorded with Snot guitarist Mike Smith, though they later scrapped the initial recording sessions with Smith. In May 2002, Durst posted Wes Borland&#x27;s personal email address online and told fans to ask him to rejoin the group. Borland stated that 75% or more of all the emails pleaded for him not to return to the band.

During the album&#x27;s production, the working title changed from &quot;Bipolar&quot; to &quot;Panty Sniffer&quot;, and was completed under the title &quot;Results May Vary&quot;. Under Durst&#x27;s sole leadership, the album encompassed a variety of styles and featured a cover of the Who&#x27;s &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot;, which differed from the original&#x27;s arrangement in its inclusion of a Speak &amp; Spell during the song&#x27;s bridge. &quot;Results May Vary&quot; consisted of various recording sessions, some of which included Smith on guitars and some without; however, Smith continued to play live shows with the band.

Limp Bizkit performed at WWE WrestleMania XIX, with both Smith and Korn&#x27;s Brian Welch on guitars. In the summer of 2003, Limp Bizkit participated on the Summer Sanitarium Tour headlined by Metallica. At the tour&#x27;s Chicago stop, concert attendees threw items and heckled Durst from the moment he walked on stage. With the crowd chanting &quot;Fuck Fred Durst&quot; and continuing their assault on him, Durst threw the mic down after six songs and walked off stage, but not before heckling the crowd back. He repeatedly said, &quot;Limp Bizkit are the best band in the world!&quot; until a roadie took his microphone away. An article in the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; stated that the hostility was started by radio personality Mancow.

&quot;Results May Vary&quot; was released on September 23, 2003, and received largely unfavorable reviews. AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine panned the album, writing, &quot;the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, [and] all attention is focused on the clown jumping up and down and screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you&#x27;re left wondering, how the hell did he ever get to put this mess out?&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; reviewer Caroline Sullivan wrote, &quot;At least Limp Bizkit can&#x27;t be accused of festering in the rap-rock ghetto ... But Durst&#x27;s problems are ever-present – and does anybody still care?&quot; Despite criticisms of the album, it was a commercial success, peaking at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Smith departed from the band in August 2004. Durst later told a fan site that he had a falling-out with Smith, saying &quot;We are the type of people that stay true to our family and our instincts and at any moment will act on intuition as a whole. Mike wasn&#x27;t the guy. We had fun playing with him but always knew, in the back of our minds, that he wasn&#x27;t where we needed him to be mentally.&quot;

=== Borland&#x27;s return, &quot;The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)&quot; and hiatus (2004–2008) ===

In August 2004, Borland rejoined Limp Bizkit, which began recording their first EP, &quot;The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)&quot;.

In May, &quot;The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)&quot; was released. Sammy Siegler took over drumming duties for the band for much of the EP, which featured a more experimental sound, described by AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine as &quot;neo-prog alt-metal&quot;. At Durst&#x27;s insistence, the EP was released as an underground release without any advertising or promotion. Borland disagreed with the decision, suggesting that it was &quot;self-sabotage&quot;: &quot;Maybe he was already unhappy with the music, and he didn&#x27;t really want to put it out there.&quot;

The EP received mixed reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the music, calling it &quot;a step in the right direction – it&#x27;s more ambitious, dramatic, and aggressive, built on pummeling verses and stop-start choruses.&quot; However, he felt that the band was being &quot;held back&quot; by Durst, whom he called &quot;the most singularly unpleasant, absurd frontman in rock.&quot; IGN writer Spence D. similarly gave it a mixed review, as he felt that the EP lacked direction, but that showed potential for the band&#x27;s musical growth.

&quot;The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)&quot; sold over 37,000 copies in its first week of release, and debuted at No. 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, but due to its lack of advertising sales fell off quickly and only sold 88,000 copies in the United States by March 2006. Following the release of the band&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hitz&quot; album, the band went on hiatus. Borland stated that it was unlikely that a sequel to &quot;The Unquestionable Truth&quot; would be produced and that &quot;As of right now, none of my future plans include Limp Bizkit.&quot;

=== Reunion, &quot;Gold Cobra&quot; and departure from Interscope (2009–2011) ===
In 2009, Limp Bizkit reunited with Borland playing guitar and launched the Unicorns N&#x27; Rainbows Tour. Durst announced that they had begun to record a new album, which Borland titled &quot;Gold Cobra&quot;. Borland said that the title does not have any meaning, and that it was chosen because it fit the style of music the band was writing for the album. The band recorded a spoken intro written by Durst and performed by Kiss member Gene Simmons for the album, but it was left off the completed album. The band also recorded additional &quot;non-album&quot; tracks, including &quot;Combat Jazz&quot;, which featured rapper Raekwon and &quot;Middle Finger&quot;, featuring Paul Wall.

&quot;Shotgun&quot; was released as a single on May 17, 2011. The song is noted for featuring a guitar solo by Borland, something that the band is not known for. &quot;Shotgun&quot; received favorable reviews, with Artistdirect writing, &quot;[&#x27;Shotgun&#x27;] feels like Bizkit approached the signature style on &quot;Three Dollar Bill Y&#x27;All&quot; and &quot;Significant Other&quot; with another decade-plus of instrumental experience and virtuosity, carving out a banger that could get asses moving in the club or fists flying in the mosh pit.&quot;

&quot;Gold Cobra&quot; was released on June 28 and received mixed to positive reviews. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine called it &quot;a return to the full-throttled attack of &quot;Three Dollar Bill Y&#x27;All&quot;. IGN writer Chad Grischow wrote, &quot;Though far from their best work, Limp Bizkit&#x27;s latest at least proves that their 2005 &quot;Greatest Hitz&quot; album may have been premature.&quot; &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; writer Terry Bezer appraised the album, writing &quot;Aside from the odd duff moment, Gold Cobra throws out the hot shit that&#x27;ll make you bounce in the mosh pit over and over again.&quot; The band launched the Gold Cobra Tour in support of the album. A music video for the title track was released. &quot;Gold Cobra&quot; sold nearly 80,000 copies in the United States alone and peaked at No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; however, the band left Interscope after the album&#x27;s release.

=== &quot;Stampede of the Disco Elephants&quot; and &quot;Still Sucks&quot; (2012–2022) ===
In February 2012, the band returned to Australia for the first time in 11 years to perform at the Soundwave festival. Durst dedicated the shows to Jessica Michalik, who died during the Limp Bizkit performance at Big Day Out 2001. Limp Bizkit signed with Cash Money Records. Following a dispute between Durst, Lethal, and Otto about the latter two&#x27;s alleged chronic drug and alcohol use, DJ Lethal angrily left the band. DJ Lethal later posted an apology to the band on Twitter, but was ultimately not allowed back into the band.

Fred Durst was featured in the song &quot;Champions&quot; by Kevin Rudolf, which was used as a theme for WWE&#x27;s Night of Champions. The song debuted on &quot;WWE Raw&quot; on September 3, 2012. This was the first time Limp Bizkit has worked with WWE since 2003.

The band recorded their seventh studio album, &quot;Stampede of the Disco Elephants&quot; with producer Ross Robinson, who also produced the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Yall&quot; and the 2005 EP &quot;The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)&quot;.

On March 24, 2013, the first single from the album, &quot;Ready to Go&quot; (featuring Lil Wayne) was released on limpbizkit.com. In November a cover of the Ministry song &quot;Thieves&quot; was released by the band via their official Facebook and Twitter accounts. In December, the band released the previously leaked song &quot;Lightz&quot; along with an accompanying music video. The next single off the album, &quot;Endless Slaughter&quot;, was set to be released only on cassette and during concerts, but can be downloaded at the band&#x27;s official website.

In October 2014, Fred Durst revealed that the band had left Cash Money and became independent again. The split was carried out amicably and Fred says that &quot;We really love the jam we did with Lil Wayne, though. We love that song.&quot;

Limp Bizkit performed as headliners of the ShipRocked 2015 cruise from February 2 to 6. Other bands present were Chevelle, Black Label Society, P.O.D., and Sevendust among others. The band announced their major 2015 tour called &quot;Money Sucks&quot;, a Russian 20-date tour to take place during October and November celebrating Limp Bizkit&#x27;s 20th anniversary. The tour name was a nod to the difficult economic situation that Russia was facing at the time. The tour gathered criticism on the background of Russo-Ukrainian War and behaviour of Fred Durst who showed a flag saying &quot;Crimea = Russia&quot;, referring to illegal annexation by Russia in 2014.

Before the band traveled to Europe to attend the &quot;Money Sucks&quot; Tour, Sam Rivers was diagnosed with a degenerative disease of the spinal discs that was complicated due to a pinched nerve, causing a lot of pain in such areas and which prevented him from being with the band. 23-year-old German bassist Samuel Gerhard Mpungu replaced Rivers for the tour.

Limp Bizkit offered several concerts in the United Kingdom during winter 2016 alongside Korn. Regarding this tour, Fred says: &quot;You may have experienced a lot of cool concerts in your life, but I can guarantee you that an evening with Korn and Limp Bizkit will always and forever be your favorite. No one brings the party harder, heavier, and more exciting than us. No one. And ... make sure you get plenty of rest the night before. It&#x27;s time to bring it back!&quot;

Because of little information and constant delays for the release of &quot;Stampede&quot;, in an interview/talk with the podcast &quot;Someone Who Isn&#x27;t Me&quot;, Wes said that Fred &quot;isn&#x27;t happy&quot; with what he was working on. The guitarist said that Durst will &quot;just keep working on something until he&#x27;s happy with it, even if it takes years and years&quot;.

DJ Lethal resumed performing with the band on March 17, 2018, at the Storm the Gates festival in Auckland, New Zealand. On July 8, 2019, the band played a new song from their forthcoming album called &quot;Wasteoid&quot; live in Paris.

Borland provided an album update in June 2021, detailing the struggles with the album: 

In August 2021, just a week after their main stage set at Lollapalooza, the band canceled their summer tour, &quot;out of an abundance of caution and concern for the safety of the band, crew and most of all the fans&quot; in relation to rising COVID-19 cases in the United States.

On August 25, 2021, the band revealed new music would be &quot;leaked&quot; in rapid succession with their new album to follow soon after.

On September 30, 2021, the band released a new single &quot;Dad Vibes&quot;. On October 19, Durst teased on Instagram that more songs would be coming soon, revealing the titles &quot;Turn It Up Bitch&quot; and &quot;Goodbye&quot;, as well as the album containing 12 tracks. On October 28, 2021, Durst confirmed via Instagram that the band&#x27;s sixth album – now titled &quot;Still Sucks&quot; – would be released on October 31, 2021.

=== Upcoming seventh studio album (2023–present) ===
Borland revealed in early 2023 that plans for Limp Bizkit&#x27;s seventh studio album were underway for 2024. In late October 2024, Durst confirmed that he was &quot;in the studio with John Otto&quot; recording drum tracks for the album.

== Artistry ==

=== Music ===

Durst wanted Limp Bizkit to be a &quot;megaband&quot; which could cross over into as many different styles of music as possible. Limp Bizkit&#x27;s music has predominately been described as , and rap rock. Limp Bizkit have also been described as alternative metal, alternative rock, and hard rock. In 2000, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; labelled the band as &quot;frat-metal&quot;.

Limp Bizkit&#x27;s music is noted for its &quot;kinetic, frenzied energy&quot;. Otto is adept in drumming in a variety of styles ranging from Brazilian and Afro-Cuban music to bebop and funk. DJ Lethal functions as a sound designer for the band, shaping their sound. According to Lethal, &quot;I try and bring new sounds, not just the regular chirping scratching sounds. ... It&#x27;s all different stuff that you haven&#x27;t heard before. I&#x27;m trying to be like another guitar player.&quot; Borland&#x27;s guitar playing is experimental and nontraditional, and he is noted for his creative use of six and seven-string guitars. &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Yall&quot; features him playing without a guitar pick, performing with two hands, one playing melodic notes, and the other playing chord progressions. His guitar playing has made use of octave shapes, and choppy, eighth-note rhythms, sometimes accompanied by muting his strings with his left hand, creating a percussive sound. Borland has also made use of unevenly accented syncopated sixteenth notes to create a disorienting effect, and hypnotic, droning licks. The song &quot;Stuck&quot; uses a sustain pedal in the first bar, and muted riffs in the second bar.

AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that the band&#x27;s album &quot;Significant Other&quot; contains &quot;flourishes of neo-psychedelia on pummeling metal numbers&quot; and &quot;swirls of strings, even crooning, at the most unexpected background&quot;. The band did not employ solos until &quot;Gold Cobra&quot; (except for the song &quot;Underneath the Gun&quot; from &quot;Results May Vary&quot;), however, during the recording of &quot;Significant Other&quot;, drummer John Otto performed an extended solo in the middle of the song &quot;Nobody Like You&quot;. A drum solo can also be heard on &quot;9 Teen 90 Nine&quot; from the same album.

=== Lyrics ===

Durst&#x27;s lyrics are often profane, scatological or angry. Much of Durst&#x27;s lyrical inspiration came from growing up and his personal life. The song &quot;Sour&quot;, from the album &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Yall&quot;, was inspired by Durst&#x27;s problems with his girlfriend. His breakup with her inspired the &quot;Significant Other&quot; songs &quot;Nookie&quot; and . When describing Limp Bizkit&#x27;s lyrics, &quot;The Michigan Daily&quot; said &quot;In a less-serious vein, Limp Bizkit used the nu-metal sound as a way to spin testosterone fueled fantasies into snarky white-boy rap. Oddly, audiences took frontman Fred Durst more seriously than he wanted, failing to see the intentional silliness in many of his songs.&quot; Durst said that people failed to understand the band&#x27;s proposal, &quot;There was always a lot of pain in my life. Mental and physical abuse happens regularly in my life. I&#x27;ve been bullied my whole life, but I also love having fun and getting crazy and being silly and outrageous. We always had that in our band and a lot of people didn&#x27;t understand that.&quot; Durst also said that the band&#x27;s purpose was to serve as a satire but &quot;We just didn&#x27;t make it that obvious.&quot; The band&#x27;s guitarist, Wes Borland, said that &quot;Limp Bizkit is definitely a dumb rock band.&quot; Limp Bizkit&#x27;s lyrics have also been described as &quot;misogynistic&quot;. In response to these accusations, Durst said: &quot;That&#x27;s because I said the words whore and bitch. My whole record is about my girlfriend who put me through the ringer for three years and my insecurity about it. It became this big thing.&quot; &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; talked about the band&#x27;s song &quot;Nookie&quot;, which is accused of being sexist and misogynistic, &quot;Despite its seemingly salacious title, &#x27;Nookie&#x27; is not about the joy of sex; instead, it finds singer Fred Durst talking about how he let his girlfriend take advantage of him because he was a fool for love. So when he gets to the chorus catch-phrase - &#x27;I did it all for the nookie&#x27; - what we hear is more self-recrimination than boast.&quot; &quot;The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)&quot; focuses on more serious and darker lyrical subject matter, including Catholic sex abuse cases, terrorism and fame.

=== Live performances ===
Guitarist Wes Borland is known for his use of costumes and body paint during concerts, appearing in bunny and kung fu suits, and painted as a skeleton and what he describes as a &quot;burnt match&quot;. Describing the character, he stated, &quot;I go onstage wearing almost nothing. I have underwear and my boots on, and I paint my whole head black—from the neck up—and I have the black contacts. All you can see is these glowing teeth.&quot; Borland&#x27;s black contacts were customized for him by a company noted for making contacts for the science fiction TV series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;.

In addition to Borland&#x27;s visual appearance, the band has also used elaborate stage setups in their performances. Their Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour visually paid tribute to the film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, with an elaborate stage setup which featured an empty Jeep, camouflage mesh and palm trees. During the band&#x27;s tour with Primus, Limp Bizkit took inspiration from Primus&#x27; trademark self-deprecatory slogan &quot;Primus sucks&quot;: Durst, Borland, Rivers, Otto and Lethal took the stage with middle fingers raised. According to Borland, &quot;they finger us back—and you know what that means to us—that they love us. It&#x27;s kind of like saying something is bad when you really mean good. Les Claypool came out the first night of the tour and got a big kick out of it. We figured it was the right idea. It makes hecklers go &#x27;huh.&#x27;&quot;

During the band&#x27;s sets at Ozzfest, audience members at the tour heckled Limp Bizkit, leading the band to use a toilet as a stage prop, which they would emerge from during each performance; the band punctuated their sets by &quot;flushing&quot; cardboard cutouts of pop stars like Hanson and the Spice Girls. During their appearance at the first Family Values Tour, Limp Bizkit performed on a set which the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described as &quot;a mix of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; and &quot;Mars Attacks&quot;&quot;. The band emerged from a spaceship during the tour, and Borland continued to experiment with visual appearances. During the band&#x27;s Halloween performance on the tour, each of the band&#x27;s members dressed as Elvis Presley at various stages in his career.

=== Influences ===
Limp Bizkit&#x27;s influences include the Jesus Lizard, Tomahawk, Dave Matthews Band, Portishead, Mr. Bungle, Sepultura, Ministry, Prong, Tool, Primus, Pantera, Minor Threat, Angry Samoans, Black Flag, the Fat Boys, the Treacherous Three, the Cold Crush Brothers, Urban Dance Squad, Rage Against the Machine, Korn, Deftones, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, and John Zorn.

=== Criticism ===
Despite receiving praise for their artistry and musical contributions, the band has received a share of negative criticism from fellow musicians. As pointed out by author Joel McIver, Limp Bizkit&#x27;s mix of rap and metal was notably preceded by the bands Rage Against the Machine and Faith No More, but its lyrics widely differed from the radical politics of the former and the existential poetry of the latter. Durst cited both bands as two of his biggest influences. Faith No More&#x27;s semi-ironic cover of &quot;Easy&quot; by Lionel Richie in 1992 hinted what would be the recording of George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Faith&quot; by Limp Bizkit in 1997. The frontmen of both groups have distanced themselves from Limp Bizkit; Zack de la Rocha of Rage Against the Machine stated that Limp Bizkit &quot;sucks&quot;, while Faith No More vocalist Mike Patton paraphrased the quote attributed to Götz von Berlichingen, &quot;Er kann mich am Arsch lecken&quot; – &quot;He can lick my ass&quot;, when asked by a German reporter about Durst&#x27;s interest in releasing his music through Interscope Records. During the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford climbed part of the set in protest of Limp Bizkit winning the award for Best Rock Video, later expressing his dislike of the band during a 2015 interview with Rolling Stone, claiming &quot;I apologize for inspiring such shit&quot;.

==Feuds==
=== Slipknot ===
Korn and Limp Bizkit shared a long-standing friendship after bassist Reginald Arvizu assisted the band in acquiring a record deal in 1996. The bands continued to strengthen their relationship as they often toured together frequently throughout the late 1990s. Slipknot at the time were an up and coming band and would have their self-titled debut produced by Ross Robinson (a producer who worked with all three bands). Whilst on tour promoting their upcoming album during the 1999 Ozzfest tour, lead singer Corey Taylor took notice of Korn drummer David Silveria&#x27;s modeling campaign for Calvin Klein in several magazines whilst the band were at a truck stop in Texas. Disgusted with Silveria&#x27;s business decisions to expand into modeling, Taylor purchased numerous copies of the magazine issue and publicly burnt copies onstage during the band&#x27;s live performances. According to Taylor, Durst and DJ Lethal were enraged by the gestures and attacked Slipknot in various interviews in the spring of 1999. Taylor admits that he and multiple Slipknot members were impressed with Limp Bizkit&#x27;s 1997 debut record, even citing it as an influence on their debut album, but he later claimed they lost respect for the band following the release of &quot;Significant Other&quot; in 1999, accusing the band of selling out. Durst would make further retaliatory comments towards Slipknot&#x27;s fans in December 1999, referring to them as &quot;fat, ugly kids&quot;. Slipknot singer Corey Taylor responded during a February 2000 fan interview in Sydney, Australia by claiming that the fans of Slipknot &quot;for the most part, enjoy all kinds of music, like Limp Bizkit… maybe.&quot; Taylor went on to claim that insulting fans of Slipknot could also be insulting fans of Limp Bizkit. During an interview with VH1 in October 2000, Durst praised Slipknot&#x27;s music, expressing his desire to quell the tension between both sides, when asked about Slipknot&#x27;s music Durst told reporters: &quot;Man this band is super phat, man; we don&#x27;t even know them. That&#x27;s their whole thing, that&#x27;s their chant, that&#x27;s their thing, that&#x27;s cool. Maybe all this hate that&#x27;s going around the world, that&#x27;s why I said &#x27;It&#x27;s all the world has even seen lately&#x27;&quot;. Despite this, Taylor retorted with praise for Durst&#x27;s financial ventures but attacked his artistic motives, claiming &quot;Fred Durst is a great businessman, but he is not an artist&quot;. Despite the attacks between the two bands, they shared numerous UK festival dates together through 2000, including the 2000 Reading and Leeds Festivals.

Taylor later claimed that feud began to subside during the late 2000s after the two bands shared a friendly encounter during the 2009 Download Festival in which Durst approached him, informing Taylor that his children were fans of Slipknot&#x27;s music. Durst asked Taylor if he would sign several autographs for his son, to which Taylor kindly obliged. The two would continue to find themselves on friendlier terms in 2010. Whilst Limp Bizkit were recording &quot;Gold Cobra&quot;, Durst included a line on the song 90.2.10 giving a shoutout to Taylor. Limp Bizkit was later booked on the 2014 Japanese leg of Slipknot&#x27;s Knotfest tour along with Korn.

In August 2021, Limp Bizkit gave a public tribute to Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison who had recently died on July 26. Durst and the band paid tribute to him during their concert in Des Moines, Iowa (Slipknot&#x27;s hometown). Durst asked the audience: &quot;Slipknot&#x27;s from somewhere around here, aren&#x27;t they?&quot; before expressing support for Jordison and the rest of the band, later telling the crowd &quot;Rest in peace, let&#x27;s hear it! That&#x27;s beautiful. Life is short and it&#x27;s always fleeting so, man, let&#x27;s just remember all we are is right now&quot; while riling the crowd to chant Jordison&#x27;s name. On May 19, 2024; Slipknot turntablist Sid Wilson made a live appearance during Limp Bizkit&#x27;s performance at that year&#x27;s Sonic Temple festival in Columbus, Ohio.

===Marilyn Manson and Trent Reznor===
Marilyn Manson was known to be overly vocal against Limp Bizkit&#x27;s music; in 1999, he attacked the band&#x27;s artistry and their fans, referring to them as &quot;illiterate apes that beat your ass in high school for being a &#x27;fag&#x27; and now sell you tuneless testosterone anthems of misogyny and pretend to be outsiders...&quot;. Manson was later reported to have withdrawn from the Woodstock &#x27;99 festival due to his dislike of Limp Bizkit, though he later claimed this was due to an inconvenient set time for his performance. Manson, along with Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor, once again took aim at Durst and the band in Nine Inch Nails&#x27; video for the song &quot;Starfuckers, Inc.&quot;, in which the two take aim at multiple artists, ranging from The Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; frontman Billy Corgan, Michael Stipe of R.E.M., and (most blatantly) Durst and Limp Bizkit. In a 2000 interview, Manson later explained: &quot;With this video, we didn&#x27;t wanna seem bitching like about somehow that Limp Bizkit&#x27;s doing better than we are, in their mind.&quot; Reznor later added to the comment, stating; &quot;I don&#x27;t have to say Limp Bizkit sucks, you know it, I know it, I shouldn&#x27;t have to say it&quot;. Durst responded to Manson and Reznor&#x27;s insults: &quot;I understand that Marilyn Manson is very unhappy that his career has gone in a shambles and he&#x27;s alienated his fans, so if he has to say things like that because he&#x27;s very mad at himself, I would forgive him. And Trent Reznor&#x27;s in the fucking same boat. Trent Reznor is obviously unhappy with how he&#x27;s alienated the world, how long he took to make a record, and how he thought he was immortal. We&#x27;re just here doing what we do and we have nothing to say about anybody. I wish them both luck and I feel sorry that they&#x27;re so jealous and mad at themselves that they have to talk shit.&quot; Durst&#x27;s relationship with Manson had seemingly grown cordial as the two later appeared on the cover of a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine issue in June 2003 alongside James Hetfield and Ozzy Osbourne. Limp Bizkit guitarist Wes Borland later joined Manson&#x27;s touring band in 2008. During a show in Seoul, South Korea on August 15, 2008, Manson introduced Borland onstage and began attacking Limp Bizkit, exclaiming to the crowd &quot;Here&#x27;s our new guitarist, he used to play for a really bad band...&quot;. Borland later departed Manson&#x27;s touring band after less than nine months, citing an inability to songwrite and criticizing Manson&#x27;s overbearing leadership. In 2021, Manson would become the subject of further controversy surrounding numerous sexual abuse allegations against him. Borland proceeded to attack Manson in numerous interviews, denouncing him as a &quot;Bad fucking dude&quot;. Trent Reznor, in an apparent change-of-heart, supported Borland&#x27;s claims against Manson&#x27;s misconduct, while also attacking him for the abuse allegations, during an interview with &quot;Ultimate Guitar&quot;.

=== Placebo ===
Limp Bizkit and Placebo began a long-standing feud, stemming from a show Durst was hosting at Irving Plaza in December 1998. Durst claimed he was prepared to introduce Placebo to the audience before singer Brian Molko insulted him, unaware of who he was. Durst later explained: &quot;I was on the side of the stage, and the singer comes and pushes me and says, &#x27;Get the fuck out of here!&#x27; And I&#x27;m like, &#x27;I&#x27;m just here because I was asked to introduce you.&#x27; And he&#x27;s like, &#x27;I don&#x27;t give a fuck who you are, get off my stage&#x27; or whatever the fuck he was saying. So I guess he didn&#x27;t know I was from Limp Bizkit, and I was introducing him.&quot; Molko&#x27;s behavior prompted Durst to rile up the crowd to chant &quot;Placebo sucks!&quot; prior to their performance. Molko later expressed that he was completely unaware that Durst was hosting the show, later expressing further disgust at the fact that Placebo were set to perform after Kid Rock. On June 11, 1999, Durst was introducing the band Staind, prior to their performance as part of K-Rock&#x27;s &quot;Dysfunctional Family Picnic&quot; in Holmdel, New Jersey, when he once again instigated the audience to chant &quot;Fuck Placebo&quot;. The feud was reignited during &quot;Big Day Out&quot; 2001, in which Placebo were billed below Limp Bizkit, with the band&#x27;s bassist, Stefan Olsdal, claiming Placebo was fearful of the audience as they hostily waited for Limp Bizkit&#x27;s performance during their set. By 2004, the feud had reportedly ended.

== Legacy and influence ==
Limp Bizkit is considered one of the defining bands of the nu metal genre. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; said: &quot;As the years have gone by, some nü-metal outfits have progressively downplayed their bracket&#x27;s hip-hop sensibilities. Even so, you can guarantee one of their primary influences were Limp Bizkit... the happily mismatched band from Jacksonville, Florida, established the ground rules of nü metal.. blur(ring) the lines between the two most polarizing genres in music... Limp Bizkit created timeless odes to teenage angst that, in time, we&#x27;ve discovered still apply right into adulthood.&quot;

&quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine talked about the impact of the band&#x27;s song &quot;Break Stuff&quot;: &quot;If Deftones represented something deeper about nu-metal, Limp Bizkit represented something entirely at the other end of the scale. Despite having a genuinely innovative guitarist in Wes Borland, whose vision for his genre-straddling band was probably more in line with bands like Primus, Faith No More and Mr. Bungle... Break Stuff, ahem, broke Limp Bizkit through its fiendishly simple two-chord motif, kick-up-the-arse drop, and its glued-to-MTV video featuring Jonathan Davis, Flea, as well as rap megastars Snoop Dogg, Eminem and Dr. Dre, taking them to an audience far beyond metal. The celebrity that followed was huge. The influence it left was huger.&quot;

Although Limp Bizkit inspired nu metal bands like Linkin Park in the 2000s, new bands in the genre continue to use Bizkit&#x27;s sound as an influence, such as acclaimed nu metal revival band Wargasm, whose members grew up listening to Limp Bizkit and have said that they &quot;wouldn&#x27;t be the band we are today without them&quot;. Other bands that have cited Limp Bizkit as influence include Emmure, Attila, Hacktivist, Lionheart, Rise of the Northstar, Islander, Of Mice &amp; Men, Vision Eternel, and Zeal &amp; Ardor.

Richard Cheese performed a lounge rendition of the songs &quot;Nookie&quot; and &quot;Break Stuff&quot; on his debut album, &quot;Lounge Against the Machine&quot;. The Vitamin String Quartet recorded a tribute album called &quot;The String Quartet Tribute to Limp Bizkit: Break Stuff&quot;, which contains reinterpretations of the band&#x27;s songs performed by a violinist backed by cellos, synthesizers, and keyboard percussion. The Blackout covered &quot;My Generation&quot; for the compilation &quot;Higher Voltage!: Another Brief History of Rock&quot;.

The band was negatively perceived in the early 21st century. In 2003, &quot;Guitar World&quot; readers voted Limp Bizkit the &quot;worst band of the year&quot;. A 2013 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers&#x27; poll voted Limp Bizkit as the third-worst band of the 1990s, behind Creed and Nickelback. The band was insulted by fellow musicians including Deftones&#x27; Chino Moreno and Slayer&#x27;s Kerry King, with King admitting that Limp Bizkit&#x27;s popularity made him consider quitting music. &quot;Slate&quot; noted how &quot;liking Limp Bizkit can seem like an ethical failure: Durst’s lyrics frequently affirm a noxious value system in which a seething hatred of The Man coexists with a seething hatred of women.&quot; &quot;The Independent&quot; stated that &quot;Limp Bizkit was often... used as a similar shorthand for the misery bad rock music has apparently wrought upon the world.&quot; Following the band&#x27;s set at Lollapalooza 2021, which was broadcast on Hulu, and the release of the song &quot;Dad Vibes&quot;, the band began having a shift in public opinion, garnering positive responses from critics and audiences. The band&#x27;s comeback album &quot;Still Sucks&quot; helped with the shifting opinion, with the album receiving mostly positive reviews.

Limp Bizkit was mentioned in a scene between Jim Carrey&#x27;s Dr. Robotnik and Idris Elba&#x27;s Knuckles in the film &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; (2022), where Robotnik compares Knuckles to being as useless as a &quot;Limp Bizkit backstage pass&quot;.

Limp Bizkit appears in &quot;Generation Kill&quot; (2004), originally conceived by journalist Evan Wright as a three-part &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine series, before being released as a full-length book and becoming a 2008 HBO mini-series under the same name. &quot;Generation Kill&quot; chronicles Wright&#x27;s experience as a reporter traveling with a platoon of U.S. Recon Marines during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. While driving along a winding canal en route to Baghdad, a Ripped, Fuel-ed Corporal from Missouri named Josh Ray Person (played by actor James Ransone) memorably &quot;recounts the band he formed after high school, Me or Society. A heavy-metal rap group, his band once opened for Limp Bizkit at a show in Kansas City. &#x27;We sucked, but so did they,&#x27; Person says. &#x27;The only difference is, they became famous right after we played together. I became a Marine.

<doc id="18701" wikidata="Q1282" url="?curid=18701" title="Lazio">
<text>Lazio ( , ; ) or Latium ( , ; from the original Latin name, ) is one of the 20 administrative regions of Italy. Situated in the central peninsular section of the country, it has 5,714,882 inhabitants and a GDP of more than €212 billion per year, making it the country&#x27;s second most populated region and second largest regional economy after Lombardy. The capital of Lazio is Rome, which is the capital city of Italy.

Lazio was the home of the Etruscan civilization, then stood at the center of the Roman Republic, of the Roman Empire, of the Papal States, of the Kingdom of Italy and of the Italian Republic. Lazio boasts a rich cultural heritage. Great artists and historical figures lived and worked in Rome, particularly during the Italian Renaissance period.

In remote antiquity, Lazio (&quot;Latium&quot;) included only a limited part of the current region, between the lower course of the Tiber, the Tyrrhenian Sea, the Monti Sabini and the Pontine Marshes.

After the end of World War II and the fall of the Fascist regime Lazio and Italy saw rapid economic growth, in particular in Rome. Today, Lazio is a large center of services and international trade, industry, public services and tourism, supported by an extensive network of transport infrastructures thanks to its geographical position in the center of Italian Peninsula and the presence of Rome within it.

== Geography ==


Lazio comprises a land area of and it has borders with Tuscany, Umbria, and Marche to the north, Abruzzo and Molise to the east, Campania to the south, and the Tyrrhenian Sea to the west. The region is mainly hilly (56%) and mountainous (26%), with some plains (20%) along the coast and the Tiber valley.

The coast of Lazio is mainly composed of sandy beaches, punctuated by the headlands of Cape Circeo (541 m) and Gaeta (171 m). The Pontine Islands, which are part of Lazio, are off Lazio&#x27;s southern coast. Behind the coastal strip, to the north, lies the Maremma Laziale (the continuation of the Tuscan Maremma), a coastal plain interrupted at Civitavecchia by the Tolfa Mountains (616 m). The central section of the region is occupied by the Roman Campagna, a vast alluvial plain surrounding the city of Rome, with an area of approximately . The southern districts are characterized by the flatlands of Agro Pontino, a once swampy and malarial area, that was reclaimed over the centuries.

The Preapennines of Latium, marked by the Tiber Valley and the Liri with the Sacco tributary, include on the right of the Tiber, three groups of mountains of volcanic origin: the Volsini, Cimini and Sabatini, whose largest former craters are occupied by the Bolsena, Vico and Bracciano lakes. To the south of the Tiber, other mountain groups form part of the Preapennines: the Alban Hills, also of volcanic origin, and the calcareous Lepini, Ausoni and Aurunci Mountains. The Apennines of Latium are a continuation of the Apennines of Abruzzo: the Reatini Mountains with Terminillo (2,213 m), Mounts Sabini, Prenestini, Simbruini and Ernici which continue east of the Liri into the Mainarde Mountains. The highest peak is Mount Gorzano (2,458 m) on the border with Abruzzo.

=== Climate ===

The region&#x27;s climate, monitored by several dozen meteorological stations (many of which managed by the Lazio Regional Hydrographic and Mareographic Office), shows considerable variability from area to area. In general, along the coast, there is a mediterranean climate, the temperature values vary between in January and in July.
Towards the interior, the climate is more continental and, on the hills, winters are cold and at night, temperatures can be quite frigid.

With particular regard to the sunshine duration, it should also be noted that, among the regional capital cities in Italy, Rome is the one with the highest number of hours of sunshine and days with clear skies during the year.

== History ==

The Italian word Lazio descends from the Latin word Latium, the region of the Latins, &quot;Latini&quot; in the Latin language spoken by them and passed on to the Latin city-state of Ancient Rome. Although the demography of ancient Rome was multi-ethnic, including, for example, Etruscans, Sabines and other Italics besides the Latini, the latter were the dominant constituent. In Roman mythology, the tribe of the Latini took their name from King Latinus. Apart from the mythical derivation of Lazio given by the ancients as the place where Saturn, ruler of the golden age in Latium, hid (latuisset) from Jupiter there, a major modern etymology is that Lazio comes from the Latin word &quot;latus&quot;, meaning &quot;wide&quot;, expressing the idea of &quot;flat land&quot; meaning the Roman Campagna. Much of Lazio is in fact flat or rolling. The lands originally inhabited by the Latini were extended into the territories of the Samnites, the Marsi, the Hernici, the Aequi, the Aurunci and the Volsci, all surrounding Italic tribes. This larger territory was still called Latium, but it was divided into Latium adiectum or Latium Novum, the added lands or New Latium, and Latium Vetus, or Old Latium, the older, smaller region. The northern border of Lazio was the Tiber river, which divided it from Etruria.

The emperor Augustus officially united almost all of present-day Italy into a single geo-political entity, Italia, dividing it into eleven regions. The part of today&#x27;s Lazio south of the Tiber river – together with the present region of Campania immediately to the southeast of Lazio and the seat of Neapolis – became Region I (&quot;Latium et Campania&quot;), while modern Upper Lazio became part of &quot;Regio VII – Etruria&quot;, and today&#x27;s Province of Rieti joined &quot;Regio IV – Samnium&quot;.

After the Gothic conquest of Italy at the end of the fifth century, modern Lazio became part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, but after the Gothic War between 535 and 554 and conquest by the Byzantine Empire, the region became the property of the Eastern Emperor as the Duchy of Rome. However, the long wars against the Longobards weakened the region. With the Donation of Sutri in 728, the Pope acquired the first territory in the region beyond the Duchy of Rome.

The strengthening of the religious and ecclesiastical aristocracy led to continuous power struggles between secular lords (&quot;Baroni&quot;) and the Pope until the middle of the 16th century. Innocent III tried to strengthen his own territorial power, wishing to assert his authority in the provincial administrations of Tuscia, Campagna and Marittima through the Church&#x27;s representatives, in order to reduce the power of the Colonna family. Other popes tried to do the same. During the period when the papacy resided in Avignon, France (1309–1377), the feudal lords&#x27; power increased due to the absence of the Pope from Rome. Small communes, and Rome above all, opposed the lords&#x27; increasing power, and with Cola di Rienzo, they tried to present themselves as antagonists of the ecclesiastical power. However, between 1353 and 1367, the papacy regained control of Lazio and the rest of the Papal States. From the middle of the 16th century, the papacy politically unified Lazio with the Papal States, so that these territories became provincial administrations of St. Peter&#x27;s estate; governors in Viterbo, in Marittima and Campagna, and in Frosinone administered them for the papacy.

Lazio was part of the short-lived Roman Republic, after which it became a puppet state of the First French Republic under the forces of Napoleon Bonaparte. Lazio was returned to the Papal States in October 1799. In 1809, it was annexed to the French Empire under the name of the Department of Tibre, but returned to the Pope&#x27;s control in 1815.

On 20 September 1870 the capture of Rome, during the reign of Pope Pius IX, and France&#x27;s defeat at Sedan, completed Italian unification, and Lazio was incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy. In 1927, the territory of the province of Rieti, belonging to Umbria and Abruzzo, joined Lazio. Towns in Lazio were devastated by the 2016 Central Italy earthquake.

== Economy ==

Agriculture, crafts, animal husbandry and fishery are the main traditional sources of income. Agriculture is characterized by the cultivation of wine grapes, fruit, vegetables and olives. Lazio is the main growing region of kiwi in Italy.

Approximately 73% of the working population are employed in the services sector, which contribute 85.8% of regional GDP; this is a considerable proportion, but is justified by the presence of Rome, which is the core of public administration, media, utility, telecommunication, transport, tourism and other sectors. Many national and multinational corporations, public and private, have their headquarters in Rome (ENI, Italiana Petroli, Enel, Acea, Terna, TIM, Poste italiane, Leonardo, ITA Airways, Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane, RAI).

Lazio&#x27;s limited industrial sector and highly developed service industries allowed the region to well outperform the Italian economy in 2009 in the heart of the global financial crisis, but it was strongly affected by the COVID-19 crisis of 2020–2021 due to the lock-downs.

Industrial development in Lazio is limited to the areas south of Rome. Communications and – above all – the setting of the border of the Cassa del Mezzogiorno some kilometers south of Rome have influenced the position of industry, favouring the areas with the best links to Rome and those near the Autostrada del Sole, especially around Frosinone. Additional factor was cheap energy supply from Latina Nuclear Power Plant and Garigliano Nuclear Power Plant, which are now out of the operation after Italian nuclear energy referendum.

=== Industry ===

Industry contributes a small part of GDP: its share is 8.9% compared to 25.0% in Veneto and 24.0% in Emilia-Romagna. In Rome it is even less with 7%, compared with 12% from tourism. Since a large part of Lazio&#x27;s GDP is produced by the service sector, with high value added.

Firms are often small to medium in size and operate in the 
* oil refining (Gaeta)
* automobile (Cassino Plant, which produced 53,422 Alfa Romeo cars in 2020 and has 3,433 employees.)
* yachts and boats (Canados Shipyard in Rome-Ostia)
* engineering (Rieti, Anagni (rotor blades and composite structures; stone extractions machines Fantoni Sud), Frosinone (helicopter transmissions)) 
* electronic (Viterbo, Rome, Pomezia, Latina). A large Texas Instruments plant in Rieti was closed with the loss of thousands of jobs.
* building and building materials (Rome, Civitavecchia)
**Well-developed travertine-processing industry, especially in the Ausoni-Tiburtina area (Tivoli and Guidonia Montecelio quarries). 
**ca. 70% of the national sanitary ceramics comes from Civita Castellana industrial district and Gaeta 
* textile (Valle del Liri). In the district the production relationships are mostly of the subcontractor type, 40% of the companies produce semi-finished and finished products not intended for marketing.

There is some R&amp;D activity in high technology: IBM (IBM Rome Software Lab), Ericsson, Leonardo Electronics (Rome-Tiburtina, Rome-Laurentina, Pomezia, Latina), Rheinmetall (&quot;Radar House&quot;) and tire industry: Bridgestone (R&amp;D center in Rome and proving grounds in Aprilia).

===Consumer goods===
The most distinctive industry in Lazio is production of household chemicals, pharmaceutical, hygiene goods and medical products: Sigma-Tau, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Procter &amp; Gamble, Colgate Palmolive, Henkel, Pfizer, Abbott, Catalent, Angelini, Menarini, Biopharma, Wepa.

===Space===
* Avio in Colleferro has headquarters and make research, development and manufacturing of solid propellant motors and liquid propellant engines for launch vehicles and tactical propulsion systems; boosters for Ariane 5 rocket
* Satellite services are provided from Telespazio which headquarters in Rome 
* Thales Alenia Space has 2 locations in Rome (Tiburtina and Saccomuro) and makes design and integration of terrestrial observation, navigation and telecommunications satellites

=== Agriculture ===

From fruits the most important are kiwifruit (1st place in Italy) and hazel nuts &quot;Nocciola romana&quot;. Italy itself is the second largest producer of kiwifruit worldwide and was surpassed only by China. Infrastructure which has been used for grape growing was easily adapted for kiwifruit cultivation.

=== Animal husbandry ===

Only sheep and buffalo herds are significant nationwide. Both are kept predominantly for milk, which is used in the production of &quot;pecorino romano&quot; and &quot;mozzarella di bufala&quot; cheese. Sheep herds are the 3rd nationwide after Sardinia and Sicily. 40% of sheep are bred in province of Viterbo.

=== Viticulture ===
Vineyards cover in Lazio. 90% of wines are white. In production of quality wine Lazio has rank 14 of 20 with 190.557 hl.
There are 3 DOCG wines:
* Frascati Superiore
* Cannellino di Frascati
* Cesanese del Piglio

=== Tourism ===
Tourism in Lazio is a thriving sector especially as regards tourism linked to art and monuments and places of interest in the region (Rome in particular), religious tourism (Rome and the sanctuaries of Lazio), summer seaside tourism especially in upper and lower Lazio (Santa Marinella, Ladispoli, Anzio, Nettuno, Sabaudia, San Felice Circeo, Terracina, Sperlonga, Gaeta) and summer/winter tourism in the ski resorts of the Lazio Apennines (Monte Terminillo, Leonessa, Cittareale, Monte Livata, Campo Staffi and Campocatino, Altipiani di Arcinazzo). Other points of interest in the region are the area of the Roman Castles, located south-east of the city of Rome, around the Alban Hills, made up of a group of towns and cities, partly in the territory of Latium Vetus, surrounded by the Roman Campagna. Also the areas around Lake Bracciano and Lake Bolsena, Lazio is home to 14 lakes of volcanic origin. One of the most important archaeological park in Italy is Ostia Antica, known as the port of ancient Rome, Ostia was a city of the Latium Vetus, located near the mouth of the Tiber river. Civita di Bagnoregio, also known as &quot;the dying city&quot;, has become a popular tourist destination in the country.

The current president of Lazio is Francesco Rocca, independent politician and former president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, in office in the centre-right coalition.

== Administrative divisions ==
Lazio is divided into four provinces and one metropolitan (province-level) city:


==Cuisine==
One of the most famous forms of food in Lazio is pasta. Dishes first attested inside the region&#x27;s borders include:

&quot;Guanciale&quot; is used in several sauces. &quot;Guanciale&quot; is the cut of pork obtained from the cheek of the pig, crossed by lean veins of muscle with a component of valuable fat, of a composition different from &quot;lardo&quot; (&quot;back fat&quot;) and &quot;pancetta&quot; (&quot;belly fat&quot;): the consistency is harder than &quot;pancetta&quot; and it possesses a more distinctive flavor. &quot;Guanciale&quot; is salted pork fat, different from bacon, which is smoked. It is a typical product of Lazio, Umbria and Abruzzo. Another important ingredient is &quot;pecorino romano&quot; cheese.

Vegetables are common, artichokes (&quot;&quot;carciofi&quot;) being among the most popular:
Other popular vegetables are romanesco broccoli, asparagus, fava bean, &quot;cima di rapa&quot;, romaine lettuce, pumpkin, zucchini and chicory.

=== Spices ===

In the cuisine of Lazio, spices are widely used. Among the most used are lesser cat-mint, called in Rome &quot;mentuccia&quot; (for artichokes and mushrooms), squaw mint, called in Rome &quot;menta romana&quot;&quot; (for lamb and tripe), laurel, rosemary, sage, juniper, chili and grated truffle.

=== &quot;Quinto quarto&quot; ===

Although Roman and Lazio cuisine use cheap ingredients like vegetable and pasta, poor people needed a source of protein. Therefore, they used the so-called &quot;quinto quarto&quot; (&quot;fifth quarter&quot;), leftovers from animal carcasses that remained after the sale of prized parts to the wealthy.

&quot;Quinto quarto&quot; includes tripe (the most valuable part of reticulum, also called &quot;&quot;cuffia&quot;, &quot;l&#x27;omaso&quot; or &quot;lampredotto&quot;&quot;), kidneys (which need to be soaked for a long time in water with lemon to remove urine smell), heart, liver, spleen, sweetbreads (pancreas, thymus and salivary glands), brain, tongue, ox tail, trotters and pajata (intestines of calf, fed only with its mother&#x27;s milk). The intestines are cleaned and skinned but the chyme (mass of partly digested food) is left inside. Typical dishes of this style are:
=== Meat dishes ===
Traditional meat dishes include &quot;saltimbocca alla romana&quot; (veal wrapped with &quot;prosciutto di Parma&quot; DOP and sage and cooked in white wine, butter and flour) and &quot;abbacchio alla romana&quot; (roasted lamb with garlic, rosemary, pepper and chopped &quot;prosciutto&quot;).
== Sports ==
The region gives its name to the professional football club SS Lazio that plays in the Italian Serie A. The region has two professional clubs in the top flight, the other being AS Roma, who also play in the highest division of Italian football. Combined, the two have won five Italian championships with Roma winning three and Lazio two. The main sports stadium in Lazio is Stadio Olimpico in Rome which has housed both teams for a prolonged time and hosts Derby della Capitale between the two clubs. The stadium also hosted the 1960 Summer Olympics and the 1990 FIFA World Cup final. Outside of Rome the football scene has another club playing in the Serie A, that being Frosinone.

Lazio hosts no top-line motorsports events, but the Vallelunga circuit previously hosted the Superbike World Championship in motorcycle racing.

Rome is home to many international sporting events and competitions, including:
* Italian Open &quot;Internazionali d&#x27;Italia&quot;, which take place between April and May of each year at the Foro Italico;
* Rome ePrix, the Formula E championship, has been held on the Circuito Cittadino dell&#x27;EUR since 2018;
* Six Nations Championship: the home matches of the Italian national rugby team;
* International horse show &quot;Piazza di Siena&quot;, equestrian competition held since 1922 in piazza di Siena, inside Villa Borghese;
* Golden Gala Pietro Mennea international event of athletics which takes place annually at the Stadio Olimpico;
* Rome Marathon, organized in spring with start and finish in Via dei Fori Imperiali.

<text>Clarence LeRoy Van Cleef Jr. (January 9, 1925 – December 16, 1989) was an American actor. He appeared in over 170 film and television roles in a career spanning nearly 40 years, but is best known as a star of spaghetti Westerns, particularly the Sergio Leone-directed &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot; films, &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; (1966). In 1983, he received a Golden Boot Award for his contribution to the Western film and television genre.

After acting on stage in regional theatre, he made his film debut in the Oscar-winning Western &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952) in a non-speaking outlaw cast role. With distinctive, angular features and a taciturn screen persona, Van Cleef was typecast as minor villain and supporting player in Westerns and crime dramas. After suffering serious injuries in a car crash, Van Cleef&#x27;s acting career started to decline. He achieved stardom when Leone offered him the co-leading role in &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot;.

He played the lead role of John Peter McAllister on the martial-arts television series &quot;The Master&quot; (1984).

After leaving the navy, Van Cleef returned home to Somerset. He played in an amateur dance band. Van Cleef received his first acting role as George in the play &quot;Our Town&quot; at the Little Theater Group in Clinton, New Jersey. His next role was that of the boxer, Joe Pendleton, in the play &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;. A talent scout took him to New York City talent agent Maynard Morris of the MCA agency, who sent him to the Alvin Theater, where he won a role in &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;.

Van Cleef&#x27;s screen debut came in &quot;High Noon&quot;. During a performance of &quot;Mister Roberts&quot; in Los Angeles, he was noticed by film producer Stanley Kramer, who offered Van Cleef a role in his upcoming film. Kramer wanted Van Cleef for the role of the deputy Harvey Pell, but wanted Van Cleef to have his nose fixed. Van Cleef declined the role in favor of the part of the silent gunslinger Jack Colby. He was cast in &quot;Kansas City Confidential&quot; (1952), &quot;Vice Squad&quot; (1953), &quot;The Big Combo&quot; (1955), and &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; (1966).

He guest-starred in an episode of John Bromfield&#x27;s syndicated crime drama &quot;Sheriff of Cochise&quot;. Van Cleef starred as minor villains and henchmen in various Westerns, including &quot;The Tin Star&quot; and &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral&quot;.

In 1960, he appeared as a villainous swindler in the &quot;Bonanza&quot; episode, &quot;The Bloodline&quot; (December 31, 1960), and also made an appearance on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;.

=== Stardom ===

In 1965, Leone cast Van Cleef, whose career had yet to take off, as a main protagonist alongside Clint Eastwood in &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot;. Leone then chose Van Cleef to appear again with Eastwood, this time as the primary antagonist, Angel Eyes, in the now seminal Western &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; (1966). 

With his roles in Leone&#x27;s films, Van Cleef became a major star of spaghetti Westerns, playing central, and often surprisingly heroic, roles in films such as &quot;The Big Gundown&quot; (1966), &quot;Death Rides a Horse&quot; (1967), &quot;Day of Anger&quot; (1967), and &quot;The Grand Duel&quot; (1972). He played the title role in &quot;Sabata&quot; (1969) and &quot;Return of Sabata&quot; (1971), and co-starred with Jim Brown in an Italian-American co-production, &quot;Take a Hard Ride&quot; (1975). In two of his final Westerns, he co-starred with Leif Garrett in &quot;God&#x27;s Gun&quot; (1976) and &quot;Kid Vengeance&quot; (1977), both of which were filmed mainly in Israel. During the 1970s, Van Cleef also had leading roles in American Westerns, such as &quot;Barquero&quot; (1970), &quot;El Condor&quot; (1970) and &quot;The Magnificent Seven Ride!&quot; (1972).

Van Cleef starred alongside Chuck Norris in the martial-arts film &quot;The Octagon&quot; (1980). Van Cleef later had a supporting role in John Carpenter&#x27;s cult film &quot;Escape from New York&quot; (1981). He slipped out of the limelight in his later years. In 1984, he was cast as a ninja master in the NBC adventure series &quot;The Master&quot;, but it was canceled after 13 episodes. Van Cleef also appeared alongside David Carradine in &quot;Armed Response &quot; (1986). In all, Van Cleef is credited with 90 movie roles and 109 television appearances over a 38-year span.

== Personal life ==
Van Cleef married Patsy Ruth Kahle in 1943 and the couple had three children before divorcing in 1958. In 1960, he married Joan Marjorie Drane, from whom he was divorced in 1974. He married Barbara Havelone in 1976, who survived him upon his death in 1989.

He lost the last joint of his right-hand middle finger while building a playhouse for his daughter.

==Death==

Despite suffering from heart disease from the 1970s and having a pacemaker installed in the 1980s, Van Cleef continued to work in films until his death on December 16, 1989. He collapsed from a heart attack in his home in Oxnard, California. Throat cancer was listed as a secondary cause of death. 

He was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery, Hollywood Hills, California, with an inscription on his grave marker reading &quot;BEST OF THE BAD&quot;, referring to his many notable acting performances as a villain.

<text>Luigi Pirandello (; 28 June 1867 – 10 December 1936) was an Italian dramatist, novelist, poet, and short story writer whose greatest contributions were his plays. He was awarded the 1934 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for his bold and ingenious revival of dramatic and scenic art&quot;. Pirandello&#x27;s works include novels, hundreds of short stories, and about 40 plays, some of which are written in Sicilian. Pirandello&#x27;s tragic farces are often seen as forerunners of the Theatre of the Absurd.

==Biography==
===Early life===


Pirandello was born into an upper-class family in Girgenti (now Agrigento), Sicily, near the poor suburb of Porto Empedocle. The area was called &quot;Caos&quot;, from , Sicilian for &quot;trousers&quot;, after the shape of a nearby ravine. Luigi Pirandello claimed to have Greek origins in an interview to Kostas Ouranis in 1934. His father, Stefano Pirandello, belonged to a wealthy family involved in the sulphur industry, and his mother, Caterina Ricci Gramitto, was also of a well-to-do background, descending from a family of the bourgeois professional class of Agrigento. Both families, the Pirandellos and the Ricci Gramittos, were ferociously anti-Bourbon and actively participated in the struggle for unification and democracy (). Stefano participated in the famous Expedition of the Thousand, later following Garibaldi all the way to the battle of Aspromonte, and Caterina, who had hardly reached the age of thirteen, was forced to accompany her father to Malta, where he had been sent into exile by the Bourbon monarchy. But the open participation in the Garibaldian cause and the strong sense of idealism of those early years were quickly transformed, above all in Caterina, into an angry and bitter disappointment with the new reality created by the unification. Pirandello would eventually assimilate this sense of betrayal and resentment and express it in several of his poems and in his novel &quot;The Old and the Young&quot;. It is also probable that this climate of disillusion inculcated in the young Luigi the sense of disproportion between ideals and reality which is recognizable in his essay on humorism (&quot;L&#x27;Umorismo&quot;).

Pirandello received his elementary education at home, but was much more fascinated by the fables and legends, somewhere between popular and magic, that his elderly servant Maria Stella used to recount to him than by anything scholastic or academic. By the age of twelve, he had already written his first tragedy. At the insistence of his father, he was registered at a technical school, but eventually switched to the study of the humanities at the &quot;ginnasio&quot;, something which had always attracted him.

In 1880, the Pirandello family moved to Palermo. It was here, in the capital of Sicily, that Luigi completed his high school education. He also began reading omnivorously, focusing, above all, on 19th-century Italian poets such as Giosuè Carducci and Arturo Graf. He then started writing his first poems and fell in love with his cousin Lina.

During this period, the first signs of serious differences arose between Luigi and his father; Luigi had discovered some notes revealing the existence of Stefano&#x27;s extramarital relations. As a reaction to the ever-increasing distrust and disharmony that Luigi was developing toward his father, a man of a robust physique and crude manners, his attachment to his mother would continue growing to the point of profound veneration. This later expressed itself, after her death, in the moving pages of the novella &quot;Colloqui con i personaggi&quot; in 1915.

His romantic feelings for his cousin, initially looked upon with disfavour, were suddenly taken very seriously by Lina&#x27;s family. They demanded that Luigi abandon his studies and dedicate himself to the sulphur business so that he could immediately marry her. In 1886, during a vacation from school, Luigi went to visit the sulphur mines of Porto Empedocle and started working with his father. This experience was essential to him and would provide the basis for such stories as &quot;Il Fumo&quot;, &quot;Ciàula scopre la Luna&quot; as well as some of the descriptions and background in the novel &quot;The Old and the Young&quot;. The marriage, which had seemed imminent, was postponed.

Pirandello then registered at the University of Palermo in the departments of Law and of Letters. The campus at Palermo, and above all the Department of Law, was the centre in those years of the vast movement which would eventually evolve into the Fasci Siciliani. Although Pirandello was not an active member of this movement, he had close ties of friendship with its leading ideologists: Rosario Garibaldi Bosco, Enrico La Loggia, Giuseppe De Felice Giuffrida and Francesco De Luca.

===Higher education===
In 1887, having definitively chosen the Department of Letters, he moved to Rome in order to continue his studies. But the encounter with the city, centre of the struggle for unification to which the families of his parents had participated with generous enthusiasm, was disappointing and nothing close to what he had expected. &quot;When I arrived in Rome it was raining hard, it was night time and I felt like my heart was being crushed, but then I laughed like a man in the throes of desperation.&quot;

Pirandello, who was an extremely sensitive moralist, finally had a chance to see for himself the irreducible decadence of the so-called heroes of the Risorgimento in the person of his uncle Rocco, now a greying and exhausted functionary of the prefecture who provided him with temporary lodgings in Rome. The &quot;desperate laugh&quot;, the only manifestation of revenge for the disappointment undergone, inspired the bitter verses of his first collection of poems, &quot;Mal Giocondo&quot; (1889). But not all was negative; this first visit to Rome provided him with the opportunity to assiduously visit the many theatres of the capital: Il Nazionale, Il Valle, il Manzoni. &quot;Oh the dramatic theatre! I will conquer it. I cannot enter into one without experiencing a strange sensation, an excitement of the blood through all my veins...&quot; 

Because of a conflict with a Latin professor, he was forced to leave the University of Rome and went to Bonn with a letter of presentation from one of his other professors. The stay in Bonn, which lasted two years, was fervid with cultural life. He read the German romantics, Jean Paul, Tieck, Chamisso, Heinrich Heine and Goethe. He began translating the &quot;Roman Elegies&quot; of Goethe, composed the &quot;Elegie Boreali&quot; in imitation of the style of the &quot;Roman Elegies&quot;, and he began to meditate on the topic of humorism by way of the works of Cecco Angiolieri.

In March 1891 he received his doctorate in Romance Philology with a dissertation on the dialect of Agrigento: &quot;Sounds and Developments of Sounds in the Speech of Craperallis&quot;.

===Marriage===
After a brief sojourn in Sicily, during which the planned marriage with his cousin was finally called off, he returned to Rome, where he became friends with a group of writer-journalists including Ugo Fleres, Tomaso Gnoli, Giustino Ferri and Luigi Capuana. Capuana encouraged Pirandello to dedicate himself to narrative writing. In 1893 he wrote his first important work, &quot;Marta Ajala&quot;, which was published in 1901 as &quot;l&#x27;Esclusa&quot;. In 1894 he published his first collection of short stories, &quot;Amori senza Amore&quot;. He also married in 1894, choosing (on his father&#x27;s suggestion) a shy, withdrawn girl of a good family of Agrigentine origin educated by the nuns of San Vincenzo: Maria Antonietta Portulano.

The first years of matrimony brought on in him a new fervour for his studies and writings: his encounters with his friends and the discussions on art continued, more vivacious and stimulating than ever, while his family life, despite the complete incomprehension of his wife with respect to the artistic vocation of her husband, proceeded relatively tranquilly with the birth of two sons (Stefano and Fausto) and a daughter (Rosalia &quot;Lietta&quot;). In the meantime, Pirandello intensified his collaborations with newspaper editors and other journalists in magazines such as &quot;La Critica&quot; and &quot;La Tavola Rotonda&quot; in which he published, in 1895, the first part of the &quot;Dialoghi tra Il Gran Me e Il Piccolo Me&quot;.

In 1897 he accepted an offer to teach Italian at the Istituto Superiore di Magistero di Roma, and in the magazine &quot;Il Marzocco&quot; he published several more pages of the &quot;Dialogi&quot;. In 1898, with Italo Falbo and Ugo Fleres, he founded the weekly &quot;Ariel&quot;, in which he published the one-act play &quot;L&#x27;Epilogo&quot; (later changed to &quot;La Morsa&quot;) and some novellas (La Scelta, Se...). The end of the 19th century and the beginnings of the 20th were a period of extreme productivity for Pirandello. In 1900, he published in &quot;Il Marzocco&quot; some of the most celebrated of his novellas (&quot;Lumie di Sicilia&quot;, &quot;La Paura del Sonno&quot;...) and, in 1901, the collection of poems &quot;Zampogna&quot;. In 1902 he published the first series of &quot;Beffe della Morte e della Vita&quot; and his second novel, &quot;Il Turno&quot;.

===Family disaster===
The year 1903 was fundamental to the life of Pirandello. The flooding of the sulphur mines of Aragona, in which his father Stefano had invested not only an enormous amount of his own capital but also Antonietta&#x27;s dowry, precipitated the financial collapse of the family. Antonietta, after opening and reading the letter announcing the catastrophe, entered into a state of semi-catatonia and underwent such a psychological shock that her mental balance remained profoundly and irremediably shaken.

Pirandello, who had initially harboured thoughts of suicide, attempted to remedy the situation as best he could by increasing the number of his lessons in both Italian and German and asking for compensation from the magazines to which he had freely given away his writings and collaborations. In the magazine &quot;New Anthology&quot;, directed by G. Cena, meanwhile, the novel which Pirandello had been writing while in this horrible situation (watching over his mentally ill wife at night after an entire day spent at work) began appearing in episodes. The title was &quot;Il Fu Mattia Pascal&quot; (&quot;The Late Mattia Pascal&quot;). This novel contains many autobiographical elements that have been fantastically re-elaborated. It was an immediate and resounding success. Translated into German in 1905, this novel paved the way to the notoriety and fame which allowed Pirandello to publish with the more important firms such as Treves, with whom he published, in 1906, another collection of novellas &quot;Erma Bifronte&quot;. In 1908 he published a volume of essays entitled &quot;Arte e Scienza&quot; and the important essay &quot;L&#x27;Umorismo&quot;, in which he initiated the legendary debate with Benedetto Croce that would continue with increasing bitterness and venom on both sides for many years.

In 1905 he took his wife to stay in Chianciano Terme together with their children where they stayed for two months in what the writer described as &quot;the village nestled on the windy hill just opposite the Collegiata&quot;. Two short stories contained in the book &quot;Short Stories for a Year&quot; are set in this town: &quot;Bitter Water&quot; and &quot;Pallino and Mimì&quot;.

In 1909 the first part of &quot;I Vecchi e I Giovani&quot; was published in episodes. This novel retraces the history of the failure and repression of the Fasci Siciliani in the period from 1893 to 1894. When the novel came out in 1913 Pirandello sent a copy of it to his parents for their fiftieth wedding anniversary along with a dedication which said that &quot;their names, Stefano and Caterina, live heroically.&quot; However, while the mother is transfigured in the novel into the otherworldly figure of Caterina Laurentano, the father, represented by the husband of Caterina, Stefano Auriti, appears only in memories and flashbacks, since, as was observed by Leonardo Sciascia, &quot;he died censured in a Freudian sense by his son who, in the bottom of his soul, is his enemy.&quot; Also in 1909, Pirandello began his collaboration with the prestigious journal &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; in which he published the novellas &quot;Mondo di Carta&quot; (&quot;World of Paper&quot;), &quot;La Giara&quot;, and, in 1910, &quot;Non è una cosa seria&quot; and &quot;Pensaci, Giacomino!&quot; (&quot;Think it over, Giacomino!&quot;). At this point Pirandello&#x27;s fame as a writer was continually increasing. His private life, however, was poisoned by the suspicion and obsessive jealousy of Antonietta who began turning physically violent.

In 1911, while the publication of novellas and short stories continued, Pirandello finished his fourth novel, &quot;Suo Marito&quot;, republished posthumously (1941), and completely revised in the first four chapters, with the title &quot;Giustino Roncella nato Boggiòlo&quot;. During his life the author never republished this novel for reasons of discretion (within are implicit references to the writer Grazia Deledda). But the work which absorbed most of his energies at this time was the collection of stories &quot;La vendetta del cane&quot;, &quot;Quando s&#x27;è capito il giuoco&quot;, &quot;Il treno ha fischiato&quot;, &quot;Filo d&#x27;aria&quot; and &quot;Berecche e la guerra&quot;. They were all published from 1913 to 1914 and are all now considered classics of Italian literature.

===First World War===
As Italy entered the First World War, Pirandello&#x27;s son Stefano volunteered for service and was taken prisoner by the Austro-Hungarians. In 1916 the actor Angelo Musco successfully recited the three-act comedy that the writer had extracted from the novella &quot;Pensaci, Giacomino!&quot; and the &quot;pastoral&quot; comedy &quot;Liolà&quot;.

In 1917 the collection of novellas &quot;E domani Lunedì&quot; (&quot;And Tomorrow, Monday...&quot;) was published, but the year was mostly marked by important theatrical representations: &quot;Così è (se vi pare)&quot; (&quot;Right you are (if you think so)&quot;), &quot;A birrita cu&#x27; i ciancianeddi&quot; and &quot;Il Piacere dell&#x27;onestà&quot; (&quot;The Pleasure Of Honesty&quot;). A year later, &quot;Ma non è una cosa seria&quot; (&quot;But It&#x27;s Nothing Serious&quot;) and &quot;Il Gioco delle Parti&quot; (&quot;The Game of Roles&quot;) were all produced on stage. Pirandello&#x27;s son Stefano returned home when the war ended.

In 1919 Pirandello had his wife placed in an asylum. The separation from his wife, despite her morbid jealousies and hallucinations, caused great suffering for Pirandello who, even as late as 1924, believed he could still properly care for her at home. She never left the asylum.

1920 was the year of comedies such as &quot;Tutto per bene&quot;, &quot;Come prima meglio di prima&quot;, and &quot;La Signora Morli&quot;. In 1921, the &quot;Compagnia di Dario Niccodemi&quot; staged, at the Valle di Roma, the play, &quot;Sei Personaggi in Cerca d&#x27;Autore&quot;, &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot;. It was a clamorous failure. The public divided into supporters and adversaries, the latter of whom shouted, &quot;Asylum, Asylum!&quot; The author, who was present at the performance with his daughter Lietta, left through a side exit to avoid the crowd of enemies. The same drama, however, was a great success when presented in Milan. In 1922 in Milan, &quot;Enrico IV&quot; was performed for the first time and was acclaimed universally as a success. Pirandello&#x27;s international reputation was developing as well. The &quot;Sei personaggi&quot; was performed in London and New York.

===Italy under the Fascists===

Pirandello was an Italian nationalist and supported Italian fascism in a moderate way. In 1924, he wrote a letter to Benito Mussolini asking him to be accepted as a member of the National Fascist Party. In 1925 Pirandello, with the help of Mussolini, assumed the artistic direction and ownership of the Teatro d&#x27;Arte di Roma, founded by the Gruppo degli Undici. He described himself as &quot;a Fascist because I am Italian.&quot; For his devotion to Mussolini, the satirical magazine &quot;Il Becco Giallo&quot; used to call him &quot;P. Randello&quot; (&quot;randello&quot; in Italian means cudgel).

He expressed publicly apolitical belief, saying &quot;I&#x27;m apolitical, I&#x27;m only a man in the world.&quot; During these years, he had continuous conflicts with fascist leaders. In 1927 he tore his fascist membership card to pieces in front of the startled secretary-general of the Fascist Party. For the remainder of his life, Pirandello was always under close surveillance by the secret fascist police OVRA.

His play, &quot;I Giganti della Montagna&quot; (&quot;The Giants of the Mountain&quot;), has been interpreted as evidence of his realization that the fascists were hostile to culture; yet, during a later appearance in New York, Pirandello distributed a statement announcing his support of Italy&#x27;s annexation of Abyssinia. He then gave his Nobel Prize medal to the Fascist government to be melted down as part of the 1935 Oro alla Patria (&quot;Gold to the Fatherland&quot;) campaign during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War.

Pirandello&#x27;s conception of the theatre underwent a significant change at this point. The idea of the actor as an inevitable betrayer of the text, as in the &quot;Sei Personaggi&quot;, gave way to the identification of the actor with the character that they play. The company took their act throughout the major cities of Europe, and the Pirandellian repertoire became increasingly well known. Between 1925 and 1926 Pirandello&#x27;s last and perhaps greatest novel, &quot;Uno, Nessuno e Centomila&quot; (&quot;One, No one and One Hundred Thousand&quot;), was published serially in the magazine &quot;La Fiera Letteraria&quot;. He was one of the contributors of the nationalist women&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Lidel&quot;, and the Fascist daily &quot;Il Tevere&quot;.

== Legacy ==

On 14 July 1930, a version of his short play &quot;The Man with the Flower in His Mouth&quot;, adapted and produced by Lance Sieveking, co-produced with John Logie Baird&#x27;s company and starring Val Gielgud and Lionel Millard, became the first drama broadcast in both picture and sound when the British Broadcasting Corporation showed it for London audiences.

Pirandello was nominated &quot;Academic of Italy&quot; in 1929, and in 1934 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature after he had been nominated by Guglielmo Marconi, member of the Royal Academy of Italy. He was the last Italian playwright to be chosen for the award until Dario Fo won on 9 October 1997.

Pirandello died alone in his home at Via Bosio, Rome, on 10 December 1936. He refused a State funeral offered by Mussolini and only in 1947 were his cremated remains buried in Sicily. The Via Luigi Pirandello in Acquaviva delle Fonti is named after him.

In the context of playwriting during the early and mid-1900s, Pirandello&#x27;s impact is notable. Pirandello inspired playwrights such as Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter to write plays that echo the themes of existential exploration and metaphysical questioning that he focused on in his works. His influence goes beyond playwrights; French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre was also inspired by Pirandello&#x27;s ideas to explore one of the main pillars of his philosophy: existentialism. The playwright&#x27;s portrayal of fractured identities and the ambiguity of existence in his plays served as inspiration for Sartre&#x27;s concepts of freedom, authenticity, and existential angst. Pirandello&#x27;s character narratives and metaphysical themes not only aligned with but also enriched Sartre&#x27;s philosophical discourses, creating a link between existential thought in theater and philosophy, where each medium deepened and reflected upon the complexities and theories of the other. The dialogues between self and other, freedom and responsibility, authenticity and bad faith, found meaning in the intersection of their respective domains. His legacy pushes further reflection into the complexities of characters, human consciousness, and identity.

Pirandello&#x27;s contributions to theater and philosophy provide a rich tapestry of existential themes interwoven with detailed character narratives. His thorough and insightful examinations of the intricacies of the human psyche and identity have left a mark that is palpable in contemporary theater and academe. This influence, while rooted in a specific historical context, manages to bridge the gap between past and present. The careful juxtaposition of simplicity and depth in his works not only invites but stimulates discourse, resonating deeply with modern artists, playwrights, and thinkers. As a result, discussions on existential concepts, identity, and the nature of reality continue to be enriched by Pirandello&#x27;s foundational ideas.

<text>Luke the Evangelist was one of the Four Evangelists—the four traditionally ascribed authors of the canonical gospels. The Early Church Fathers ascribed to him authorship of both the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles. Prominent figures in early Christianity such as Jerome and Eusebius later reaffirmed his authorship, although a lack of conclusive evidence as to the identity of the author of the works has led to discussion in scholarly circles, both secular and religious.

The New Testament mentions Luke briefly a few times, and the Epistle to the Colossians refers to him as a physician (from Greek for &#x27;one who heals&#x27;); thus he is thought to have been both a physician and a disciple of Paul.

Since the early years of the faith, Christians have regarded him as a saint. He is believed to have been a martyr, reportedly having been hanged from an olive tree, though some believe otherwise. The Catholic Church and other major denominations venerate him as Saint Luke the Evangelist and as a patron saint of artists, physicians, bachelors, notaries, butchers, brewers, and others; his feast day is 18 October.

== Life ==
Many scholars believe that Luke was a physician who lived in the Hellenistic city of Antioch in Ancient Syria, born of a Greek family, although some scholars and theologians think Luke was a Hellenic Jew. While it has been widely accepted that the theology of Luke–Acts points to a gentile Christian writing for a gentile audience, some have concluded that it is more plausible that Luke–Acts is directed to a community made up of both Jewish and gentile Christians since there is stress on the scriptural roots of the gentile mission (see the use of Isaiah 49:6 in Luke–Acts). DNA testing on what Christian tradition holds to be his body has revealed it to be of Syrian ancestry.

Whether Luke was a Jew or gentile, or something in between, it is clear from the quality of the Greek language used in Luke-Acts that the author, held in Christian tradition to be Luke, was one of the most highly educated of the authors of the New Testament. The author&#x27;s conscious and intentional allusions and references to, and quotations of, ancient Classical and Hellenistic Greek authors, such as Homer, Aesop, Epimenides, Euripides, Plato, and Aratus indicate that he was familiar with actual Greek literary texts. This familiarity most likely derived from his experiences as a youth of the very homogeneous Hellenistic educational curriculum () that had been, and would continue to be, used for centuries throughout the eastern Mediterranean.

Luke&#x27;s earliest mention is in the Epistle to Philemon, chapter 1, verse 24. He is also mentioned in Colossians 4:14 and 2 Timothy 4:11, both traditionally held to be Pauline epistles (see Authorship of the Pauline epistles).

Epiphanius states that Luke was one of the Seventy Apostles (&quot;Panarion&quot; 51.11), and John Chrysostom indicates at one point that the &quot;brother&quot; that Paul mentions in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians 8:18 is either Luke or Barnabas (&quot;Homily 18 on Second Corinthians&quot; on 2 Corinthians 8:18).

If one accepts that Luke was indeed the author of the Gospel bearing his name and the Acts of the Apostles, certain details of his personal life can be reasonably assumed. While he does exclude himself from those who were eyewitnesses to Jesus&#x27; ministry, he repeatedly uses the word &quot;we&quot; in describing the Pauline missions in Acts of the Apostles, indicating that he was personally there at those times.

The composition of the writings, as well as the range of vocabulary used, indicate that the author was an educated man. A quote in the Epistle to the Colossians differentiates between Luke and other colleagues &quot;of the circumcision.&quot;

This comment has traditionally caused commentators to conclude that Luke was a gentile. If this were true, it would make Luke the only writer of the New Testament who can clearly be identified as not being Jewish. However, that is not the only possibility. Although Luke is considered likely to have been a gentile Christian, some scholars believe him to have been a Hellenized Jew. The phrase could just as easily be used to differentiate between those Christians who strictly observed the rituals of Judaism and those who did not.

Luke&#x27;s presence in Rome with the Apostle Paul near the end of Paul&#x27;s life was attested by 2 Timothy 4:11: &quot;Only Luke is with me&quot;. In the last chapter of the Book of Acts, widely attributed to Luke, there are several accounts in the first person also affirming Luke&#x27;s presence in Rome, including Acts 28:16: &quot;And when we came to Rome...&quot; According to some accounts, Luke also contributed to the authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews.

Luke died at age 84 in Boeotia, according to a &quot;fairly early and widespread tradition&quot;. According to Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos, Greek historian of the 14th century (and others), Luke&#x27;s tomb was located in Thebes, whence his relics were transferred to Constantinople in the year 357.

== Authorship of Luke and Acts ==

The Gospel of Luke does not name its author. The Gospel was not, nor does it claim to be, written by direct witnesses to the reported events, unlike Acts beginning in the sixteenth chapter. However, in most translations the author suggests that they have investigated the book&#x27;s events and notes the name (Theophilus) of that to whom they are writing.

The earliest manuscript of the Gospel (Papyrus 75 = Papyrus Bodmer XIV-XV), dated AD 200, ascribes the work to Luke; as did Irenaeus writing AD 180, and the Muratorian fragment, a 7th-century Latin manuscript thought to be copied and translated from a Greek manuscript as old as AD 170.

The Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles make up a two-volume work which scholars call Luke–Acts. Together they account for 27.5% of the New Testament, the largest contribution by a single author.
== As a historian ==
Most scholars understand Luke&#x27;s works (Luke–Acts) in the tradition of Greek historiography. Luke 1:1–4, drawing on historical investigation, identified the work to the readers as belonging to the genre of history. There is disagreement about how best to treat Luke&#x27;s writings, with some historians regarding Luke as highly accurate, and others taking a more critical approach.

Based on his accurate description of towns, cities and islands, as well as correctly naming various official titles, archaeologist William Mitchell Ramsay wrote that &quot;Luke is a historian of the first rank; not merely are his statements of fact trustworthy. …[He] should be placed along with the very greatest of historians.&quot; Professor of Classics at Auckland University, Edward Musgrave Blaiklock, wrote: &quot;For accuracy of detail, and for evocation of atmosphere, Luke stands, in fact, with Thucydides. The Acts of the Apostles is not shoddy product of pious imagining, but a trustworthy record. …It was the spadework of archaeology which first revealed the truth.&quot; New Testament scholar Colin Hemer has made a number of advancements in understanding the historical nature and accuracy of Luke&#x27;s writings.

On the purpose of Acts, New Testament scholar Luke Timothy Johnson has noted that &quot;Luke&#x27;s account is selected and shaped to suit his apologetic interests, not in defiance of but in conformity to ancient standards of historiography.&quot; Such a position is shared by Richard Heard, who sees historical deficiencies as arising from &quot;special objects in writing and to the limitations of his sources of information.&quot;

In modern times, Luke&#x27;s competence as a historian is questioned, depending upon one&#x27;s &quot;a priori&quot; view of the supernatural. Since post-Enlightenment historians work with methodological naturalism, such historians would see a narrative that relates supernatural, fantastic things like angels, demons etc., as problematic as a historical source. Mark Powell claims that &quot;it is doubtful whether the writing of history was ever Luke&#x27;s intent. Luke wrote to proclaim, to persuade, and to interpret; he did not write to preserve records for posterity. An awareness of this, has been, for many, the final nail in Luke the historian&#x27;s coffin.&quot;

Robert M. Grant has noted that although Luke saw himself within the historical tradition, his work contains a number of statistical improbabilities, such as the sizable crowd addressed by Peter in Acts 4:4. He has also noted chronological difficulties whereby Luke &quot;has Gamaliel refer to Theudas and Judas in the wrong order, and Theudas actually rebelled about a decade after Gamaliel spoke (5:36–7)&quot;, though this report&#x27;s status as a chronological difficulty is hotly disputed.

Brent Landau writes:
== As an artist ==

Christian tradition, starting from the 8th century, states that Luke was the first icon painter. He is said to have painted pictures of the Virgin Mary and Child, in particular the Hodegetria image in Constantinople (now lost). Starting from the 11th century, a number of painted images were venerated as his autograph works, including the Black Madonna of Częstochowa, Our Lady of Vladimir, and &quot;Madonna del Rosario&quot;. He was also said to have painted Saints Peter and Paul, and to have illustrated a gospel book with a full cycle of miniatures.

The late medieval Guilds of Saint Luke gathered together and protected painters in many cities of Europe, especially Flanders. The Academy of Saint Luke, in Rome, was imitated in many other European cities during the 16th century. The tradition that Luke painted icons of Mary and Jesus has been common, particularly in Eastern Orthodoxy. The tradition also has support from the Saint Thomas Christians of India who claim to still have one of the Theotokos icons that Saint Luke painted and which Saint Thomas brought to India.

The art critic writes that the icons attributed to the brush of the Evangelist Luke have a completely Byzantine character that was fully established only in the 5th-6th centuries.

In traditional depictions, such as paintings, evangelist portraits, and church mosaics, Saint Luke is often accompanied by an ox or bull, usually having wings. The ox is mentioned in both Ezechiel 1:10 and Revelation 4:7. Sometimes only the symbol is shown, especially when in a combination of those of all Four Evangelists. &quot;St Luke is suggested by the ox, a sacrificial animal, because his Gospel stresses the sacrificial nature of Christ&#x27;s ministry and opens with Zechariah performing his priestly duties.&quot;

==Veneration==
=== Eastern Orthodoxy ===
The Eastern Orthodox Church commemorated Saint Luke, Apostle of the Seventy, Evangelist, companion (coworker) of the holy Apostle Paul, hieromartyr, physician, first icon painter with several feast days. The following are fixed feast days:

* 4 January - The Synaxis of the Seventy Apostles.
* 22 April - Feast of Apostles Nathaniel (Nathanael), Luke the Evangelist, Clement of Sardice or Clement of Rome and Apelles of Heraklion (Greek sources say that Saint Luke (Loukias) was someone other than the Evangelist Luke). This feast is held also on 10 September.
* 20 June - Translation of the relics and garments of the Apostles Luke, Andrew, and Thomas, the Prophet Eliseus, and Martyr Lazarus of Persia found , during the time of the emperor Romanos Lakapenos (919–44) in a monastery of Saint Augusta into the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople under Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus (c. 956–70) by Saint Patriarch Polyeuctus of Constantinople (956–70).
* 10 September - Feast of Apostles of the Seventy: Nathaniel (Nathanael), Luke the Evangelist, Clement of Sardice or Clement of Rome and Apelles of Heraklion (Greek sources say that Saint Luke (Loukias) was someone other than the Evangelist Luke). The commemoration is held again on 22 April.
* 18 October - Feast of the Apostle and Evangelist Luke.
There are also moveable feasts in which Luke is commemorated:
* Synaxis of All Saints of Achaia - Moveable holiday the Sunday before the feast of Saint Andrew (30 November).
* Synaxis of All Saints of Boeotia - Moveable holiday on the last Saturday of May.

=== Roman Catholicism ===
The Roman Catholic Church commemorates Luke the Evangelist on 18 October.

=== Oriental Orthodoxy ===
The Coptic Orthodox Church commemorates the martyrdom of Luke on Paopi 22.

=== Anglicanism ===
The Church of England commemorates Luke the Evangelist on 18 October.

== Relics ==
Eight bodies and nine heads, located in different places, are presented as the relics of the Apostle Luke.

Despot George of Serbia purportedly bought the relics from the Ottoman sultan Murad II for 30,000 gold coins. After the Ottoman conquest of Bosnia, the kingdom&#x27;s last queen, George&#x27;s granddaughter Mary, who had brought the relics with her from Serbia as her dowry, sold them to the Venetian Republic.

In 1992, the then Greek Orthodox Metropolitan Ieronymos of Thebes and Livadeia (who subsequently became Archbishop Ieronymos II of Athens and All Greece) requested from Bishop Antonio Mattiazzo of Padua the return of &quot;a significant fragment of the relics of St. Luke to be placed on the site where the holy tomb of the Evangelist is located and venerated today&quot;. This prompted a scientific investigation of the relics in Padua, and by numerous lines of empirical evidence (archeological analyses of the Tomb in Thebes and the Reliquary of Padua, anatomical analyses of the remains, carbon-14 dating, comparison with the purported skull of the Evangelist located in Prague) confirmed that these were the remains of an individual of Syrian descent who died between AD 72 and AD 416. The Bishop of Padua then delivered to Metropolitan Ieronymos the rib of Saint Luke that was closest to his heart to be kept at his tomb in Thebes.

Thus, the relics of Saint Luke are divided as follows:
* The body, in the Abbey of Santa Giustina in Padua;
* The skull, in the St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague;
* A rib, at his tomb at the Holy Church of Luke the Evangelist in Thebes.

<doc id="18713" wikidata="Q158462" url="?curid=18713" title="Lynyrd Skynyrd">
<text>Lynyrd Skynyrd (, ) is an American rock band formed in Jacksonville, Florida in 1964. The group originally formed as My Backyard and comprised Ronnie Van Zant (vocals), Gary Rossington (guitar), Allen Collins (guitar), Larry Junstrom (bass), and Bob Burns (drums). The band spent four years touring small venues under various names and with several lineup changes before deciding on &quot;Lynyrd Skynyrd&quot; in 1968. The band released its first album, &quot;(Pronounced &#x27;Lĕh-&#x27;nérd &#x27;Skin-&#x27;nérd)&quot;, in 1973. By then, they had settled on a lineup that included bassist Leon Wilkeson, keyboardist Billy Powell, and guitarist Ed King. Burns left and was replaced by Artimus Pyle in 1974. King left in 1975 and was replaced by Steve Gaines in 1976. At the height of their fame in the 1970s, the band popularized the Southern rock genre with songs such as &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; and &quot;Free Bird&quot;. After releasing five studio albums and one live album, the band&#x27;s career was abruptly halted on October 20, 1977, when their chartered airplane crashed, killing Van Zant, Steve Gaines, and backup singer Cassie Gaines, and seriously injuring the rest of the band.

Lynyrd Skynyrd reformed in 1987 for a reunion tour with Ronnie&#x27;s brother, Johnny Van Zant, as lead vocalist. They continued to tour and record with co-founder Rossington, Johnny Van Zant, and Rickey Medlocke, who first wrote and recorded with the band from 1971 to 1972 before his return in 1996. Over the years, other founding members of the band have died either during—or after—their time in the band. In January 2018, Lynyrd Skynyrd announced its farewell tour, and continued touring until 2022. Members were still working on the band&#x27;s fifteenth album at the time of Rossington&#x27;s death in 2023, after which no founding members remained in the band.

In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked Lynyrd Skynyrd No. 95 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;. Lynyrd Skynyrd was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 13, 2006. As of 2023, the band has sold more than 28 million records in the United States. AllMusic called them &quot;the definitive Southern rock band&quot;.

==History==
===Early years (1963–1973)===
Allen Collins received his first guitar in 1963 and was later in a band called The Mods in Jacksonville, Florida. The Mods membership included J.R. Rice and Larry Steele. In early 1964, Ronnie Van Zant joined another local band, The Squires, that he soon renamed to Us. That year, at a local &#x27;Battle of the Bands&#x27;, Us performed against The Mods and won the competition. Van Zant, however, left Us shortly afterward. In the early summer of 1964, bassist Larry Junstrom, drummer Bob Burns, and guitarist Gary Rossington formed a trio called Me, You, and Him.

Later in the summer of 1964, teenagers Van Zant, Rossington, and Burns all became acquainted while playing on rival baseball teams. The trio decided to jam together one afternoon after Burns was injured by a ball hit by Van Zant. They set up their equipment in the carport of Burns&#x27; parents&#x27; house and played The Rolling Stones&#x27; hit &quot;Time Is on My Side&quot;. Liking what they heard, they immediately decided to form a band. Bassist Larry Junstrom rounded out the lineup. They soon approached guitarist Allen Collins to join the band just two weeks later, and he agreed to join. The band later rehearsed in Junstrom&#x27;s carport after Burns&#x27; parents said the band was too loud. The band settled on the name My Backyard, later changed to Conquer the Worm for a day or two, then The Noble Five, and finally The One Percent by 1967.
In 1968, Van Zant sought a new name after growing tired of taunts from audiences that the band had &quot;one percent talent&quot;. At Burns&#x27; suggestion, the group settled on &quot;Leonard Skinnerd&quot;, which was in part a reference to a character named &quot;Leonard Skinner&quot; in Allan Sherman&#x27;s novelty song &quot;Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh&quot; and in part a mocking tribute to P.E. teacher Leonard Skinner at Robert E. Lee High School. Skinner was notorious for strictly enforcing the school&#x27;s policy against boys having long hair. Rossington dropped out of school, tired of being hassled about his hair. The more distinctive spelling &quot;Lynyrd Skynyrd&quot; was adopted at least as early as 1969.

By 1970, Lynyrd Skynyrd had become a top band in Jacksonville, headlining at some local concerts, and opening for several national acts. Pat Armstrong, a Jacksonville native and partner in Macon, Georgia-based Hustlers Inc.; along with Phil Walden&#x27;s younger brother, Alan, became the band&#x27;s managers. Armstrong left Hustlers shortly thereafter to start his own agency. Walden stayed with the band until 1974, when management was transferred to Peter Rudge. The band continued to perform throughout the South in the early 1970s, further developing their hard-driving blues rock sound and image, and experimenting with recording their sound in a studio. Skynyrd crafted this distinctively &quot;southern&quot; sound through a creative blend of country, blues, and a slight British rock influence.

During this time, the band experienced some lineup changes for the first time. Junstrom left and was briefly replaced by Greg T. Walker on bass. At that time, Rickey Medlocke joined as a second drummer and second vocalist to help fortify Burns&#x27; sound on the drums. Medlocke had grown up with the founding members of Lynyrd Skynyrd and his grandfather, Shorty Medlocke, was an influence in the writing of &quot;The Ballad of Curtis Loew&quot;.

===Peak (1973–1977)===

In 1972, the band (then comprising Van Zant, Collins, Rossington, Burns, Wilkeson, and Powell) was discovered by musician, songwriter, and producer Al Kooper of Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, who had attended one of their shows at Funocchio&#x27;s in Atlanta. Kooper signed them to his Sounds of the South label, which was to be distributed and supported by MCA Records, and produced their first album. Wilkeson, citing nervousness about fame, temporarily left the band during the early recording sessions, playing on only two tracks. He rejoined the band shortly after the album&#x27;s release at Van Zant&#x27;s invitation and is pictured on the album cover. To replace him, Strawberry Alarm Clock guitarist Ed King joined the band and played bass on the album (the only part that Wilkeson had not already written being the solo section in &quot;Simple Man&quot;), and also contributed to the songwriting and did some guitar work on the album. After Wilkeson rejoined, King stayed in the band and switched solely to guitar, allowing the band to replicate its three-guitar studio mix in live performances. The band released their debut album &quot;(Pronounced &#x27;Lĕh-&#x27;nérd &#x27;Skin-&#x27;nérd)&quot; on August 13, 1973. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. The album featured the hit song &quot;Free Bird&quot;, which received national airplay, eventually reaching No. 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s fan base continued to grow rapidly in 1973, thanks to their opening on the Who&#x27;s &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; tour in the United States. Their 1974 follow-up album, &quot;Second Helping&quot;, featuring King, Collins and Rossington all collaborating with Van Zant on the songwriting, cemented the band&#x27;s breakthrough. Its single &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;, a response to Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Southern Man&quot;, reached #8 on the charts that August. Young and Van Zant were not rivals, but fans of each other&#x27;s music and good friends; Young wrote the song &quot;Powderfinger&quot; for the band, but they never recorded it. During their peak years, most of their records sold over one million copies, but &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; was the only single to crack the top ten.

By 1975, personal issues began to take their toll on the band. In January, drummer Burns left the band after suffering a mental breakdown during a European tour and was replaced by Kentucky native and former US Marine Artimus Pyle. The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Nuthin&#x27; Fancy&quot;, was recorded in 17 days. Unhappy with the band&#x27;s lack of preparation for the album&#x27;s recording, Kooper and the band parted ways by mutual agreement after the tracking was completed, with Kooper mixing the album while the band left for the tour that had precipitated the constricted recording schedule. Though the album fared well, it ultimately had lower sales than its predecessors. Midway through the &quot;Nuthin&#x27; Fancy&quot; tour, guitarist Ed King abruptly left the band after a falling out with Van Zant. King&#x27;s guitar roadie and Van Zant were arrested together and spent the night in jail. With his guitar roadie unavailable, King played that night&#x27;s show with old strings that broke and caused his performance to be substandard, and Van Zant subsequently belittled him in front of his bandmates. King quit and returned home to Los Angeles, believing Van Zant had been responsible for his guitar roadie being in jail in the first place.
Collins and Rossington both had serious car accidents over Labor Day weekend in 1976, which slowed the recording of the follow-up album and forced the band to cancel some concert dates. Rossington&#x27;s accident inspired the ominous Van Zant/Collins composition &quot;That Smell&quot; – a cautionary tale about drug abuse that was aimed towards him and at least one other band member. Rossington has admitted repeatedly that he was the &quot;Prince Charming&quot; of the song who crashed his car into an oak tree while drunk and stoned on Quaaludes. With the birth of his daughter Melody in 1976, Van Zant was making a serious attempt to clean up his act and curtail the cycle of boozed-up brawling that was part of Skynyrd&#x27;s reputation.
The &quot;Street Survivors&quot; album of 1977 turned out to be a showcase for guitarist/vocalist Steve Gaines, who had joined the band just a year earlier and was making his studio debut with them. Publicly and privately, Ronnie Van Zant marveled at the multiple talents of Skynyrd&#x27;s newest member, claiming that the band would &quot;all be in his shadow one day&quot;. Gaines&#x27; contributions included his co-lead vocal with Van Zant on the co-written &quot;You Got That Right&quot; and the rousing guitar boogie &quot;I Know a Little&quot;, which he had written before he joined Skynyrd. So confident was Skynyrd&#x27;s leader of Gaines&#x27; abilities that the album (and some concerts) featured Gaines delivering his self-penned bluesy &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Good Life&quot; – the only song in the pre-crash Skynyrd catalog to feature a lead vocalist other than Ronnie Van Zant (the album &quot;Skynyrd’s First: The Complete Muscle Shoals Album&quot;, which features two songs sung by former drummer/future guitarist Rickey Medlocke, was released after the plane crash). The album also included the hit singles &quot;What&#x27;s Your Name&quot; and &quot;That Smell&quot;. The band was poised for their biggest tour yet, with shows always highlighted by the iconic rock anthem &quot;Free Bird&quot;.

===Plane crash (1977)===

Following a performance at the Greenville Memorial Auditorium in Greenville, South Carolina, on October 20, 1977, the band boarded a chartered Convair CV-240 bound for Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where they were scheduled to appear at LSU the following night. After running out of fuel, the pilots attempted an emergency landing before crashing in a heavily forested area five miles northeast of Gillsburg, Mississippi. Killed on impact were Ronnie Van Zant and Steve Gaines, along with backup singer Cassie Gaines (Steve&#x27;s older sister), assistant road manager Dean Kilpatrick, pilot Walter McCreary and co-pilot John Gray. Other band members (Collins, Rossington, Wilkeson, Powell, Pyle, and Hawkins), tour manager Ron Eckerman, and several road crew members suffered serious injuries.

The accident came just three days after the release of the group&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Street Survivors&quot;. Following the crash and the ensuing press, &quot;Street Survivors&quot; became the band&#x27;s second platinum album and reached No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, their highest position on the chart. The single &quot;What&#x27;s Your Name&quot; reached No. 13 on the single charts in 1978. The original cover sleeve for &quot;Street Survivors&quot; had featured a photograph of the band amid flames, with Steve Gaines nearly obscured by fire. Out of respect for the deceased (and at the request of Teresa Gaines, Steve&#x27;s widow), MCA Records withdrew the original cover and replaced it with the album&#x27;s back photo, a similar image of the band against a simple black background. However, the group would restore the original image for the 30th anniversary deluxe edition of the album.

===Hiatus (1977–1987)===
Lynyrd Skynyrd disbanded after the tragedy, reuniting only on one occasion to perform an instrumental version of &quot;Free Bird&quot; at Charlie Daniels&#x27; Volunteer Jam V in January 1979. Collins, Rossington, Powell, and Pyle were joined by Daniels and members of his band. Leon Wilkeson, who was still undergoing physical therapy for his badly broken left arm, was in attendance, along with Judy Van Zant, Teresa Gaines, JoJo Billingsley, and Leslie Hawkins.

Rossington, Collins, Wilkeson and Powell formed the Rossington Collins Band, which released two MCA albums, &quot;Anytime, Anyplace, Anywhere&quot; in 1980 and &quot;This Is The Way&quot; in 1981. Deliberately avoiding comparisons with Ronnie Van Zant as well as suggestions that this band was Lynyrd Skynyrd reborn, Rossington and Collins chose a woman, Dale Krantz, as the lead vocalist. However, as an acknowledgement of their past, the band&#x27;s concert encore would always be an instrumental version of &quot;Free Bird&quot;. Rossington and Collins eventually had a falling out over the affections of Dale Krantz, whom Rossington married and with whom he formed The Rossington Band, which released two albums, &quot;Returned to the Scene of the Crime&quot; in 1986 and &quot;Love Your Man&quot; in 1988 and also opened for the Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour in 1987–1988.

The other former members of Lynyrd Skynyrd continued to make music during the hiatus era. Billy Powell played keyboards in a Christian rock band named Vision, touring with established Christian rocker Mylon LeFevre. During Vision concerts, Powell&#x27;s trademark keyboard talent was often spotlighted and he spoke about his conversion to Christianity after the near-fatal plane crash. Pyle formed the Artimus Pyle Band in 1982, which occasionally featured former Honkettes JoJo Billingsley and Leslie Hawkins and released one MCA album, titled &quot;A.P.B.&quot;

In 1980, Allen Collins&#x27;s wife Kathy died of a massive hemorrhage while miscarrying their third child. He formed the Allen Collins Band in 1983 from the remnants of the Rossington Collins Band and released one MCA studio album, &quot;Here, There &amp; Back&quot;. He was visibly suffering from Kathy&#x27;s death; he excessively drank and consumed drugs. On January 29, 1986, Collins, then 33, crashed his Ford Thunderbird into a ditch near his home in Jacksonville, killing his girlfriend Debra Jean Watts and leaving himself permanently paralyzed from the chest down.

===Return (1987–1995)===
In 1987, Lynyrd Skynyrd reunited for a full-scale tour with five major members of the pre-crash band: crash survivors Gary Rossington, Billy Powell, Leon Wilkeson and Artimus Pyle, along with guitarist Ed King, who had left the band two years before the crash. Ronnie Van Zant&#x27;s younger brother, Johnny, took over as the new lead singer and primary songwriter. Due to founding member Allen Collins&#x27; paralysis from his 1986 car accident, he was only able to participate as the musical director, choosing Randall Hall, his former bandmate in the Allen Collins Band, as his stand-in. In return for avoiding prison following his guilty plea to DUI manslaughter, Collins would be wheeled out onstage each night to explain to the audience why he could no longer perform (usually before the performance of &quot;That Smell&quot;, the lyrics of which had been partially directed at him). Collins was stricken with pneumonia in 1989 and died on January 23, 1990, at age 37.

The reunited band was intended to be a one-time tribute to the original lineup, captured on the double-live album &quot;Southern by the Grace of God: Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour 1987&quot;. That the band chose to continue after the 1987 tribute tour caused legal problems for the survivors, as Judy Van Zant Jenness and Teresa Gaines Rapp (widows of Ronnie and Steve, respectively) sued the others for violating an agreement made shortly after the plane crash, stating that they would not &quot;exploit&quot; the Skynyrd name for profit. As part of the settlement, Jenness and Rapp collect nearly 30% of the band&#x27;s touring revenues (representing the shares their husbands would have earned had they lived), and hold a proviso requiring any band touring as Lynyrd Skynyrd to include Rossington and at least two of the other four surviving members from the pre-crash era, namely Wilkeson, Powell, King and Pyle. Following this rule, the band would have been forced to retire in 2001, but they have still continued to tour for another two decades.

The band released its first post-reunion album in 1991, entitled &quot;Lynyrd Skynyrd 1991&quot;. By that time, the band had added a second drummer, Kurt Custer. Artimus Pyle left the band during the same year, with Custer becoming the band&#x27;s sole drummer. That lineup released a second post-reunion album, entitled &quot;The Last Rebel&quot; in 1993. Later that year, Randall Hall was replaced by Mike Estes. In 1994, Owen Hale replaced Kurt Custer on drums.

===Member changes and deaths (1996–2019)===
Ed King had to take a break from touring in 1996 due to heart complications that required a transplant. In his absence, he was replaced by Hughie Thomasson. The band did not let King rejoin after he recovered. At the same time, Mike Estes was replaced by Rickey Medlocke, who had previously played and recorded with the band for a short time in the early 1970s. The result was a major retooling of the band&#x27;s &#x27;guitar army&#x27;. Medlocke and Thomasson would also become major contributors to the band&#x27;s songwriting along with Rossington and Van Zant.

The first album with this new lineup, released in 1997, was titled &quot;Twenty&quot;. The band released another album, &quot;Edge of Forever&quot; in 1999. By that time, Hale had left the band, and the drums on the album were played by session drummer Kenny Aronoff. Michael Cartellone became the band&#x27;s permanent drummer on the subsequent tour. Despite the growing number of post-reunion albums that the band had released up to this time, setlists showed that the band was playing mostly 1970s-era material in concert.

The band released a Christmas album, titled &quot;Christmas Time Again&quot; in 2000. Leon Wilkeson, Skynyrd&#x27;s bassist since 1972, was found dead in his hotel room on July 27, 2001. His death was found to be due to emphysema and chronic liver disease. He was replaced in 2001 by Ean Evans.

The first album to feature Evans was &quot;Vicious Cycle&quot;, released in 2003. This album had improved sales over the other post-reunion albums, and had a minor hit single in the song &quot;Red, White and Blue&quot;. The band also released a double album called &quot;&quot;, which had songs from the original lineup to the present, and also a live DVD of their Vicious Cycle Tour. On June 22, 2004, the album &quot;Lynyrd Skynyrd Lyve: The Vicious Cycle Tour&quot; was released.

Thomasson left the band in 2005 to reform The Outlaws, and Mark &quot;Sparky&quot; Matejka, formerly of the country music band Hot Apple Pie, joined in 2006 as his replacement.

On March 13, 2006, Lynyrd Skynyrd was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (also discussed later in the article), and they reunited with former members Bob Burns (drums), Artimus Pyle (drums), and Ed King (guitar) for a performance of &quot;Free Bird.&quot;

On November 2, 2007, the band performed for a crowd of 50,000 people at the University of Florida&#x27;s Gator Growl student-run pep rally in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium (&quot;The Swamp&quot; football stadium). This was the largest crowd that Lynyrd Skynyrd had played to in the U.S., until the July 2008 Bama Jam in Enterprise, Alabama where more than 111,000 people attended.

On January 28, 2009, keyboardist Billy Powell died of a suspected heart attack at age 56 at his home near Jacksonville, Florida. No autopsy was carried out. He was replaced by Peter Keys.

On March 17, 2009, it was announced that Skynyrd had signed a worldwide deal with Roadrunner Records, in association with their label, Loud &amp; Proud Records, and released their new album &quot;God &amp; Guns&quot; on September 29 of that year. They toured Europe and the U.S. in 2009 with Keys on keyboards and Robert Kearns of the Bottle Rockets on bass; bassist Ean Evans died of cancer at age 48 on May 6, 2009. Scottish rock band Gun performed as special guests for the UK leg of Skynyrd&#x27;s tour in 2010.
In addition to the tour, Skynyrd appeared at the Sean Hannity Freedom Concert series in late 2010. Hannity had been actively promoting the &quot;God &amp; Guns&quot; album, frequently playing portions of the track &quot;That Ain&#x27;t My America&quot; on his radio show. The tour is titled &quot;Rebels and Bandoleros&quot;. The band continued to tour throughout 2011, playing alongside ZZ Top and the Doobie Brothers.

On May 2, 2012, the band announced the impending release of a new studio album, &quot;Last of a Dyin&#x27; Breed&quot;, along with a North American and European tour. On August 21, 2012, &quot;Last of a Dyin&#x27; Breed&quot; was released. In celebration, the band did four autograph signings throughout the southeast. Lynyrd Skynyrd used a Confederate flag from the 1970s until the 2010s, and several criticisms have been raised against them because of this. While promoting the album on CNN on September 9, 2012, members of the band talked about its discontinued use of Confederate imagery. In September 2012, the band briefly did not display the Confederate flag, which had for years been a part of their stage show, because they did not want to be associated with racists that adopted the flag. However, after protests from fans, they reversed this decision, citing it as part of their Southern American heritage and states&#x27; rights symbolism. The band would later cease use of the Confederate flag starting with their 2019 tour.

Original drummer Bob Burns died at age 64 on April 3, 2015; his car crashed into a tree while he was driving alone near his home in Cartersville, Georgia. From 2015 through 2017, the band had periods of being sidelined or having to cancel shows due to health problems suffered by founding member Gary Rossington.

Former member Ed King, who had been battling cancer, died in his Nashville, Tennessee, home on August 22, 2018, at 68 years of age.

===Farewell tour, upcoming fifteenth album and the death of Rossington (2018–present)===
On January 25, 2018, Lynyrd Skynyrd announced their Last of the Street Survivors Farewell Tour, which started on May 4, 2018. Supporting acts included Kid Rock, Hank Williams Jr., Bad Company, the Charlie Daniels Band, the Marshall Tucker Band, .38 Special, Cheap Trick, Blackberry Smoke, the Randy Bachman Band, Blackfoot, Massive Wagons, and Status Quo. Concerts were usually on Fridays and Saturdays. On January 8, 2020, Rossington stated in an interview that while they would no longer be touring, they will continue to play occasional live shows.

On March 19, 2019, Johnny Van Zant announced that the band intended to go into the studio to record one last album after completing the tour with several songs ready or &quot;in the can&quot;. They appeared at the Kaaboo Texas festival on May 11, 2019.

Lynyrd Skynyrd was among hundreds of recording artists whose original master recordings were believed to have been destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Though it is not known with certainty which, if any, of the band&#x27;s master recordings were lost in the blaze, Lynyrd Skynyrd was among the artists listed in an internal Universal Music Group document listing the artists whose master recordings the company believed had been lost and subsequently spent tens of millions of dollars trying to replace.

Rossington, the last founding member of the band, died on March 5, 2023, leaving no original members left alive. In April 2023, the band confirmed that they would continue as a band. There had previously been agreements about how many pre-crash members had to be in the band in order for it to be active and &quot;legal&quot;, but this appears to be no longer applicable since Rossington&#x27;s death.

In November 2023, Dolly Parton released a cover of &quot;Free Bird&quot; on her rock album Rockstar; this version also featured contributions from members of Lynyrd Skynyrd (including slide guitar from Rossington, recorded before his death), along with former drummer Artimus Pyle and his band, and even part of the late Ronnie van Zant&#x27;s vocal track from the original recording of &quot;Free Bird&quot; (with the permission of Ronnie van Zant&#x27;s widow). A similar version was featured on a Pyle-led tribute album of re-recorded collaborations with other musicians on Skynyrd songs, and Skynyrd also plans (as of 2023) to release their own similar version; however, according to Parton, only her version was allowed to use Ronnie van Zant&#x27;s original vocal track.

==Recognition==
===Honors===

<doc id="18717" wikidata="Q993310" url="?curid=18717" title="List of Latin place names in Continental Europe, Ireland and Scandinavia">
<text>This list includes European countries and regions that were part of the Roman Empire, or that were given Latin place names in historical references. As a large portion of the latter were only created during the Middle Ages, often based on scholarly etiology, this is not to be confused with a list of the actual names modern regions and settlements bore during the classical era.

==Background==
Until the Modern Era, Latin was the common language for scholarship and mapmaking. During the 19th and 20th centuries, German scholars in particular have made significant contributions to the study of historical place names, or &quot;Ortsnamenkunde&quot;. These studies have, in turn, contributed to the study of genealogy. For genealogists and historians of pre-Modern Europe, knowing alternate names of places is vital to extracting information from both public and private records. Even specialists in this field point out, however, that the information can be easily taken out of context, since there is a great deal of repetition of place names throughout Europe; reliance purely on apparent connections should therefore be tempered with valid historical methodology.

==Caveats and notes==
Latin place names are not always exclusive to one place — for example, there were several Roman cities whose names began with &quot;Colonia&quot; and then a more descriptive term. During the Middle Ages, these were often shortened to just &quot;Colonia&quot;. One of these, &quot;Colonia Agrippinensis&quot;, retains the name today in the form of Cologne.

Early sources for Roman names show numerous variants and spellings of the Latin names.

The modern canonical name is listed first. Sources are listed chronologically. In general, only the earliest source is shown for each name, although many of the names are recorded in more than one of the sources. Where the source differs in spelling, or has other alternatives, these are listed following the source. As an aid to searching, variants are spelled completely, and listed in most likely chronology.

Superscripts indicate:
# Latinized form of the Greek-derived name.
# Latinized form of the Asian-derived name via Greek.
# Altered Latinized form of the Greek-derived name.

<doc id="18720" wikidata="Q310783" url="?curid=18720" title="Lodovico Ferrari">
<text>Lodovico de Ferrari (2 February 1522 – 5 October 1565) was an Italian mathematician best known today for solving the biquadratic equation.

==Biography==
Born in Bologna, Lodovico&#x27;s grandfather, Bartolomeo Ferrari, was forced out of Milan to Bologna. Lodovico settled in Bologna, and he began his career as the servant of Gerolamo Cardano. He was extremely bright, so Cardano started teaching him mathematics. Ferrari aided Cardano on his solutions for biquadratic equations and cubic equations, and was mainly responsible for the solution of biquadratic equations that Cardano published. While still in his teens, Ferrari was able to obtain a prestigious teaching post in Rome after Cardano resigned from it and recommended him. Ferrari retired when young at 42 years old, and wealthy. He then moved back to his home town of Bologna where he lived with his widowed sister Maddalena to take up a professorship of mathematics at the University of Bologna in 1565. Shortly thereafter, he died of white arsenic poisoning, according to a legend, by his sister.

==Cardano–Tartaglia formula==
In 1545 a famous dispute erupted between Ferrari and Cardano&#x27;s contemporary Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia, involving the solution to cubic equations. Widespread stories that Tartaglia devoted the rest of his life to ruining Ferrari&#x27;s teacher and erstwhile master Cardano, however, appear to be fabricated. Mathematical historians now credit both Cardano and Tartaglia with the formula to solve cubic equations, referring to it as the &quot;Cardano–Tartaglia formula&quot;.

<doc id="18722" wikidata="Q916398" url="?curid=18722" title="Lymphedema">
<text>Lymphedema, also known as lymphoedema and lymphatic edema, is a condition of localized swelling caused by a compromised lymphatic system. The lymphatic system functions as a critical portion of the body&#x27;s immune system and returns interstitial fluid to the bloodstream.

Lymphedema is most frequently a complication of cancer treatment or parasitic infections, but it can also be seen in a number of genetic disorders. Tissues with lymphedema are at high risk of infection because the lymphatic system has been compromised.
Though incurable and progressive, a number of treatments may improve symptoms. This commonly includes compression therapy, good skin care, exercise, and manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), which together are known as combined decongestive therapy. Diuretics are not useful.
==Signs and symptoms==
The most common manifestation of lymphedema is soft tissue swelling (edema). As the disorder progresses, worsening edema and skin changes including discoloration, verrucous (wart-like) hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, papillomatosis, dermal thickening, and ulcers may be seen. Additionally, there is increased risk of infection of the skin, known as erysipelas.

===Complications===
When lymphatic impairment becomes so great that the collected lymph fluid exceeds the lymphatic system&#x27;s ability to transport it, an abnormal amount of protein-rich fluid collects in the tissues. Left untreated, this stagnant, protein-rich fluid causes tissue channels to increase in size and number, reducing oxygen availability. This interferes with wound healing and provides a rich medium for bacterial growth which can result in skin infections, lymphangitis, lymphadenitis, and, in severe cases, skin ulcers. It is vital for lymphedema patients to be aware of the symptoms of infection and to seek immediate treatment, since recurrent infections or cellulitis, in addition to their inherent danger, further damage the lymphatic system and set up a vicious circle.

In rare cases, lymphedema may lead to a form of cancer called lymphangiosarcoma, although the mechanism of carcinogenesis is not understood. Lymphedema-associated lymphangiosarcoma is called Stewart–Treves syndrome. Lymphangiosarcoma most frequently occurs in cases of long-standing lymphedema. The incidence of angiosarcoma five years after radical mastectomy is estimated to be 0.45% in surviving patients. Lymphedema is also associated with a low grade form of cancer called retiform hemangioendothelioma (a low grade angiosarcoma).

Lymphedema can be disfiguring, and may result in a poor body image and psychological distress. Complications of lymphedema can cause difficulties in activities of daily living.

==Causes and risk factors==
Lymphedema may be inherited (primary) or caused by injury to the lymphatic vessels (secondary). There are also risk factors that may increase one&#x27;s risk of developing lymphedema such as old age, being overweight or obese, and having rheumatic or psoriatic arthritis.

===Lymph node damage===
Lymphedema is most commonly seen after lymph node dissection, surgery or radiation therapy for the treatment of cancer, most notably breast cancer. In many patients the condition does not develop until months or even years after therapy has concluded. Lymphedema may also be associated with accidents or certain diseases or conditions that may inhibit the lymphatic system from functioning properly. It can also be caused by damage to the lymphatic system from infections such as cellulitis. In tropical areas of the world where parasitic filarial worms are endemic, a common cause of secondary lymphedema is filariasis.

Primary lymphedema may be congenital or may arise sporadically. Multiple syndromes are associated with primary lymphedema, including Turner syndrome, Milroy&#x27;s disease, and Klippel–Trénaunay syndrome. In these syndromes it may occur as a result of absent or malformed lymph nodes or lymphatic channels. Lymphedema can be present at birth, develop at the onset of puberty (praecox), or not become apparent for many years into adulthood (tarda). In men, lower-limb primary lymphedema is most common, occurring in one or both legs. Some cases of lymphedema may be associated with other vascular abnormalities.

Secondary lymphedema affects both men and women, and, in Western countries, is most commonly due to cancer treatment. In women, it is most prevalent in an upper limb after breast cancer surgery, especially axillary lymph node dissection, and occurs on the same side of the body as the surgery. Breast and trunk lymphedema can also occur but go unrecognised as there is swelling in the area after surgery, and its symptoms (peau d&#x27;orange and an inverted nipple) can be confused with post surgery fat necrosis. Between 38 and 89% of breast cancer patients have lymphedema due to axillary lymph node dissection or radiation. Unilateral lymphedema of a lower limb occurs in up to 41% of patients after gynecologic cancer. For men treated for prostate cancer, a 5-66% incidence has been reported, with the incidence rate depending on whether staging or radical removal of lymph glands was done in addition to radiotherapy.

Head and neck lymphedema can be caused by surgery or radiation therapy for tongue or throat cancer. It may also occur in the lower limbs or groin after surgery for colon, ovarian or uterine cancer, if removal of lymph nodes or radiation therapy is required. Surgery or treatment for prostate, colon and testicular cancers may result in secondary lymphedema, particularly when lymph nodes have been removed or damaged.

The onset of secondary lymphedema in patients who have had cancer surgery has also been linked to aircraft flight (likely due to decreased cabin pressure or relative immobility). For cancer survivors wearing a prescribed and properly fitted compression garment may help decrease swelling during air travel.

Some cases of lower-limb lymphedema have been associated with the use of tamoxifen, due to blood clots and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) associated with this medication. Resolution of the blood clots or DVT is needed before lymphedema treatment can be initiated.

===At birth===
Hereditary lymphedema is a primary lymphedema – swelling that results from abnormalities in the lymphatic system that are present from birth. Swelling may be present in a single limb, several limbs, genitalia, or the face. It is sometimes diagnosed prenatally by a nuchal scan or postnatally by lymphoscintigraphy.

The most common cause is Meige disease which usually presents at puberty. Another form of hereditary lymphedema is Milroy&#x27;s disease, caused by mutations in the VEGFR3 gene. Hereditary lymphedema is frequently syndromic and is associated with Turner syndrome, lymphedema–distichiasis syndrome, yellow nail syndrome, and Klippel–Trénaunay syndrome.

One defined genetic cause for hereditary lymphedema is GATA2 deficiency. This deficiency is a grouping of several disorders caused by a single defect: familial or sporadic inactivating mutations in one of the two parental &quot;GATA2&quot; genes. These autosomal dominant mutations cause a reduction, i.e. a haploinsufficiency, in the cellular levels of the gene&#x27;s product, GATA2. The GATA2 protein is a transcription factor critical for the development, maintenance, and functionality of blood-forming, lymphatic-forming, and other tissue-forming stem cells. Due to these mutations cellular levels of GATA2 are deficient and over time individuals develop hematological, immunological, lymphatic, and other disorders. GATA2 deficiency-induced defects in the lymphatic vessels and valves underlies the development of lymphedema, primarily in the lower extremities but may also occur in places such as the face or testes. This form of the deficiency, when coupled with sensorineural hearing loss, which may also be due to faulty development of the lymphatic system, is sometimes termed Emberger syndrome.

Primary lymphedema occurs in approximately one to three births out of every 10,000 births, with a female to male ratio of 3.5:1. In North America, the incidence of primary lymphedema is approximately 1.15 births out of every 100,000 births. Compared to secondary lymphedema, primary lymphedema is relatively rare.

=== Inflammatory lymphedema ===

Bilateral lower extremity inflammatory lymphedema (BLEIL) is a distinct type of lymphedema occurring in a setting of acute and prolonged standing, such as in new recruits during basic training. Possible underlying mechanisms may include venous congestion and inflammatory vasculitis.

==Physiology==
Lymph is formed from the fluid that filters out of blood and contains proteins, cellular debris, bacteria, etc. This fluid is collected by the initial lymph collectors that are blind-ended endothelial-lined vessels with fenestrated openings that allow fluids and particles as large as cells to enter. Once inside the lumen of the lymphatic vessels, the fluid is guided along increasingly larger vessels, first with rudimentary valves to prevent backflow, later with complete valves similar to the venous valve. Once the lymph enters the fully valved lymphatic vessels, it is pumped by a rhythmic peristaltic-like action by smooth muscle cells within the lymphatic vessel walls. This peristaltic action is the primary driving force moving lymph within its vessel walls. The sympathetic nervous system regulates the frequency and power of the contractions. Lymph movement can be influenced by the pressure of nearby muscle contraction, arterial pulse pressure and the vacuum created in the chest cavity during respiration, but these passive forces contribute only a minor percentage of lymph transport. The fluids collected are pumped into continually larger vessels and through lymph nodes, which remove debris and police the fluid for dangerous microbes. The lymph ends its journey in the thoracic duct or right lymphatic duct, which drain into the blood circulation.

Several research groups have hypothesized that chronic inflammation is a key regulator in the development of lymphedema. Th cells, particularly Th2 differentiation, play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of lymphedema. Research has shown that increased expression of Th2-inducing cytokines in the epidermal cells of the lymphoedematous limb. Treatment with QBX258 has been found to decrease hyperkeratosis and fibrosis, reduce the number of CD4+ cells, and normalize the expression of Th2-inducing cytokines and IL13R by keratinocytes. These findings suggest that epidermal cells may initiate or coordinate chronic Th2 responses in lymphedema.

=== Role of T-Cell inflammation and Th2 response ===
Lymphedema involves a complex interplay of inflammatory processes. Recent research has shed light on the role of T-cell inflammation and the Th2 immune response in the initiation of lymphedema.

==== T-Cell inflammation and fibrosis ====
Studies have revealed that sustained lymphatic stasis results in the infiltration of CD4+ T-cells, leading to inflammation and fibrosis within affected tissues.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is generally based on signs and symptoms, with testing used to rule out other potential causes. An accurate diagnosis and staging may help with management. A swollen limb can result from different conditions that require different treatments. Diagnosis of lymphedema is currently based on history, physical exam, and limb measurements. Imaging studies such as lymphoscintigraphy and indocyanine green lymphography are only required when surgery is being considered. However, the ideal method of staging to guide treatment is controversial because of several different proposed protocols.

Lymphedema can occur in both the upper and lower extremities, and in some cases, the head and neck. Assessment of the extremities first begins with a visual inspection; color, presence of hair, visible veins, size and any sores or ulcerations are noted. Lack of hair may indicate an arterial circulation problem. In cases of swelling, the extremities&#x27; circumference is measured over time for reference. In early stages of lymphedema, elevating the limb may reduce or eliminate the swelling. Palpation of the wrist or ankle can determine the degree of swelling; assessment includes a check of the pulses. The axillary or inguinal lymph nodes may be enlarged due to the swelling. Enlargement of the nodes lasting more than three weeks may indicate infection or other illnesses (such as sequela from breast cancer surgery) requiring further medical attention.

Diagnosis or early detection of lymphedema is difficult. The first signs may be subjective observations such as a feeling of heaviness in the affected extremity. These may be symptomatic of early-stage lymphedema where accumulation of lymph is mild and not detectable by changes in volume or circumference. As lymphedema progresses, definitive diagnosis is commonly based upon an objective measurement of differences between the affected or at-risk limb and the opposite unaffected limb, e.g. in volume or circumference. No generally accepted criterion is definitively diagnostic, although a volume difference of 200 ml between limbs or a difference (at a single measurement site or set intervals along the limb) is often used. Bioimpedance measurement (which measures the amount of fluid in a limb) offers greater sensitivity than other methods. Devices like SOZO utilize Bioimpedence Analysis (BIA) by sending a current through the body and measuring the resultant impedance. Another approach involves Tissue Dielectric Constant (TDC) measurement, used by devices such as Delfin Technology&#x27;s MoistureMeterD and LymphScanner, which employ microwaves to detect changes in the dielectric properties of tissue. These innovative techniques have become integral to official protocols for lymphedema detection.

Chronic venous stasis changes can mimic early lymphedema, but are more often bilateral and symmetric. Lipedema can also mimic lymphedema, however lipedema characteristically spares the feet beginning abruptly at the malleolus (ankle). As a part of the initial work-up before diagnosing lymphedema, it may be necessary to exclude other potential causes of lower extremity swelling such as kidney failure, hypoalbuminemia, congestive heart-failure, protein-losing kidney disease, pulmonary hypertension, obesity, pregnancy and drug-induced edema.

===Classification===

The International Society of Lymphology (ISL) Staging System is based solely on subjective symptoms, making it prone to substantial observer bias. Imaging modalities have been suggested as useful adjuncts to the ISL staging to clarify the diagnosis, such as Cheng&#x27;s Lymphedema Grading tool, which assesses the severity of extremity lymphedema based on objective limb measurements and provides appropriate options for management.

==== I. Grading ====

* Grade 1: Spontaneously reversible on elevation. Mostly pitting edema.
* Grade 2: Non-spontaneously reversible on elevation. Mostly non-pitting edema.
* Grade 3: Gross increase in volume and circumference of Grade 2 lymphedema, with eight stages of severity given below based on clinical assessments.

===== II. Staging =====
As described by the Fifth WHO Expert Committee on Filariasis, and endorsed by the American Society of Lymphology, the staging system helps to identify the severity of lymphedema. With the assistance of medical imaging, such as MRI or CT, staging can be established by the physician, and therapeutic or medical interventions may be applied:
* Stage 0: The lymphatic vessels have sustained some damage that is not yet apparent. Transport capacity is sufficient for the amount of lymph being removed. Lymphedema is not present.
* Stage 1 : Swelling increases during the day and disappears overnight as the patient lies flat in bed. Tissue is still at the pitting stage: when pressed by the fingertips, the affected area indents and reverses with elevation. Usually, upon waking in the morning, the limb or affected area is normal or almost normal in size. Treatment is not necessarily required at this point.
* Stage 2: Swelling is not reversible overnight, and does not disappear without proper management. The tissue now has a spongy consistency and is considered non-pitting: when pressed by the fingertips, the affected area bounces back without indentation. Fibrosis found in Stage 2 lymphedema marks the beginning of the hardening of the limbs and increasing size.
* Stage 3: Swelling is irreversible and usually the limb(s) or affected area becomes increasingly large. The tissue is hard (fibrotic) and unresponsive; some patients consider undergoing reconstructive surgery, called &quot;debulking&quot;. This remains controversial, however, since the risks may outweigh the benefits and further damage done to the lymphatic system may make the lymphedema worse.
* Stage 4: The size and circumference of the affected limb(s) become noticeably larger. Bumps, lumps, or protrusions (also called knobs) on the skin begin to appear.
* Stage 5: The affected limb(s) become grossly large; one or more deep skin folds is present.
* Stage 6: Knobs of small elongated or rounded sizes cluster together, giving mossy-like shapes on the limb. Mobility of the patient becomes increasingly impaired.
* Stage 7: The person becomes &quot;handicapped&quot;, and is unable to independently perform daily routine activities such as walking, bathing and cooking. Assistance from the family and health care system is needed.

====Grades====
Lymphedema can also be categorized by its severity (usually compared to a healthy extremity):
* Grade 1 (mild edema): Involves the distal parts such as a forearm and hand or a lower leg and foot. The difference in circumference is less than and no other tissue changes are present.
* Grade 2 (moderate edema): Involves an entire limb or corresponding quadrant of the trunk. Difference in circumference is . Tissue changes, such as pitting, are apparent. The patient may experience erysipelas.
* Grade 3a (severe edema): Lymphedema is present in one limb and its associated trunk quadrant. Circumferential difference is greater than . Significant skin alterations, such as cornification, keratosis, cysts or fistulae, are present. Additionally, the patient may experience repeated attacks of erysipelas.
* Grade 3b (massive edema): The same symptoms as grade 3a, except that two or more extremities are affected.
* Grade 4 (gigantic edema): In this stage of lymphedema, the affected extremities are huge, due to almost complete blockage of the lymph channels.

===Differential===
Lymphedema should not be confused with edema arising from chronic venous insufficiency, which is caused by compromise of venous drainage rather than lymphatic drainage. However, untreated venous insufficiency can progress into a combined venous/lymphatic disorder known as phlebetic lymphedema (or phlebolymphedema).

==Treatment==
While there is no cure, treatment may improve outcomes. This commonly include compression therapy, good skin care, exercise, manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) and the use of an intermittent pneumatic compression pump, which together is known as combined decongestive therapy. MLD is most effective in mild to moderate disease. In breast cancer-related lymphedema, MLD is safe and may offer added benefit to compression bandages for reducing swelling. Most people with lymphedema can be medically managed with conservative treatment. Diuretics are not useful. Surgery is generally only used if symptoms are not improved by other measures.

===Compression===

====Garments====
Once a person is diagnosed with lymphedema, compression becomes imperative in the management of the condition. Garments are often intended to be worn all day but may be taken off for sleep, unless otherwise prescribed. Elastic compression garments are worn on the affected limb following complete de-congestive therapy to maintain edema reduction. Inelastic garments provide containment and reduction. Available styles, options, and prices vary widely. A professional garment fitter or certified lymphedema therapist can help determine the best option for the patient.

====Bandaging====
Compression bandaging, also called wrapping, is the application of layers of padding and short-stretch bandages to the involved areas. Short-stretch bandages are preferred over long-stretch bandages (such as those normally used to treat sprains), as the long-stretch bandages cannot produce the proper therapeutic tension necessary to safely reduce lymphedema and may produce a tourniquet effect. Compression bandages provide resistance that assists in pumping fluid out of the affected area during exercise. This counter-force results in increased lymphatic drainage and therefore a decrease in size of the swollen area.

====Intermittent pneumatic compression therapy====
Intermittent pneumatic compression therapy (IPC) utilizes a multi-chambered pneumatic sleeve with overlapping cells to promote movement of lymph fluid. Pump therapy should only be used in addition to other treatments such as compression bandaging and manual lymph drainage. Pump therapy has been used in the past to help with controlling lymphedema. In some cases, pump therapy helps soften fibrotic tissue and therefore potentially enable more efficient lymphatic drainage. However, reports link pump therapy to increased incidence of edema proximal to the affected limb, such as genital edema arising after pump therapy in the lower limb. Current literature has suggested the use of IPC treatment in conjunction with an elastic therapeutic tape is more effective in the overall reduction of lymphedema as well as increasing shoulder range of motion than the traditional treatment of IPC paired with complete decongestive therapy. The tape is an elastic cotton strip with an acrylic adhesive that is used commonly used to relieve the discomfort and disability associated with sports injuries, but in the context of lymphedema, this increases the space between the dermis and the muscle which increases the opportunity for lymphatic fluid to flow out naturally. The use of IPC treatments with tape, as well as subsequent lymphatic drainage, has proven to significantly reduce the circumference of lymphatic limbs in patients experiencing lymphedema secondary to breast cancer post-mastectomy.

===Exercise and massage===
In those with lymphedema or at risk of developing lymphedema, such as following breast cancer treatment, resistance training did not increase swelling and led to decreases in some, in addition to other potential beneficial effects on cardiovascular health. Moreover, resistance training and other forms of exercise were not associated with an increased risk of developing lymphedema in people who previously received breast cancer-related treatment. Compression garments should be worn during exercise.

Physical therapy for patients with lymphedema may include trigger point release, soft tissue massage, postural improvement, patient education on condition management, strengthening, and stretching exercises. Exercises may increase in intensity and difficulty over time, beginning with passive movements to increase range of motion and progressing towards using external weights and resistance in various postures.

=== Surgery ===
The treatment of lymphedema is usually conservative, however the use of surgery is proposed for some cases.

Suction assisted lipectomy (SAL), also known as liposuction for lymphedema, may help improve chronic non pitting edema. The procedure removes fat and protein and is done alongside continued compression therapy.

Vascularized lymph node transfers (VLNT) and lymphovenous bypass are supported by tentative evidence but are associated with a number of complications.

===Laser therapy===
Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) was cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of lymphedema in November 2006. According to the US National Cancer Institute, LLLT may be effective in reducing lymphedema in some women. Two cycles of laser treatment were found to reduce the volume of the affected arm in approximately one-third of people with post-mastectomy lymphedema at three months post-treatment.

A new therapeutic approach involving the drug QBX258 has shown promising results in the treatment of lymphedema. Although it did not reach statistical significance, QBX258 treatment modestly decreased periostin expression and the number of CD4+ and CD4+IL4+ cells in lymphoedematous skin. Notably, QBX258 significantly reduced the expression of Th2-inducing cytokines, improving physical and social quality-of-life measures for patients. However, psychological improvements were not observed.

==Epidemiology==
Lymphedema affects approximately 200 million people worldwide.

<text>Laurens Janszoon Coster (; in Haarlem – ), or Laurens Jansz Koster, is the purported inventor of a printing press from Haarlem. He allegedly invented printing simultaneously with Johannes Gutenberg and was regarded by some in the Netherlands well into the 20th century as having invented printing first.

==Biography==
 He was an important citizen of Haarlem and held the position of sexton (&quot;Koster&quot;) of Sint-Bavokerk. He is mentioned in contemporary documents between 1417 and 1434 as a member of the great council, an assessor (scabinus), and as the city treasurer. He probably perished in the plague that visited Haarlem in 1439 and 1440; his widow is mentioned in the latter year.

There are no known works printed by Laurens.

==Junius story==

Hadrianus Junius, otherwise known as Adriaen de Jonghe, wrote this story around 1567 in his book &quot;Batavia&quot;, published only in 1588, and was quoted by Cornelis de Bie. Now known primarily for his &quot;Emblemata&quot;, Junius moved to Haarlem in 1550, and wrote several books, acting shortly as the rector of the Latin School there, as the city physician and as historiographer of the States of Holland (as of 1565/66). His story was echoed by his friend Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert, who started a printing business in Haarlem in 1560. Later Samuel Ampzing (with the help of Petrus Scriverius) repeated the story in &quot;Lavre-Kranz Voor Lavrens Koster Van Haerlem, Eerste Vinder vande Boek-Druckerye&quot; (1628) with illustrations of the invention. According to Junius, sometime in the 1420s, Coster was in the Haarlemmerhout carving letters from bark for the amusement of his grandchildren, and observed that the letters left impressions on the sand. He proceeded to invent a new type of ink that did not run, and he began a printing company based on his invention with a primitive typesetting arrangement using moveable type. Since the Haarlemmerhout was burned during a siege by the Kennemers in 1426 during the Hook and Cod wars, this must have been early in the 1420s. Using wooden letters at first, he later used lead and tin movable type. His company prospered and grew. He is said to have printed several books including &quot;Speculum Humanae Salvationis&quot; with several assistants including the letter cutter Johann Fust, and it was this letter cutter Fust (often spelled &quot;Faust&quot;) who, when Laurens was nearing death, broke his promise of secrecy and stole his presses and type and took them to Mainz where he started his own printing company.

==Story by Ulrich Zell==
There is support for the claim that Coster might be the inventor. In the anonymous &quot;Kölner Chronik&quot; of 1499, Ulrich Zell, a printing assistant from Cologne, who was then between the age of 60 and 69 years old, claimed that printing had started in Mainz. He based this statement on knowledge that Holland used to print Latin grammar texts (&quot;Donatus&quot;). Neither Coster nor Haarlem are mentioned in that chronicle. If true, this points to Johann Gutenberg about a decade after Coster&#x27;s death. However, the first securely dated book by Dutch printers is from 1471, long after Gutenberg. Either way, Coster is somewhat of a Haarlem local &quot;hero&quot;, and apart from a statue on the &quot;Grote Markt&quot; his name can be found in many places in the city.

==Earliest known Haarlem printer==
Between 1483 and 1486, Jacob Bellaert worked in Haarlem. His books were known for their artistic woodcuts. Haarlem, Gouda, and Delft were all cities with early printing presses. This was because these cities did not have powerful religious institutions or universities, where competing copyist production (&quot;scriptoria&quot;) took place. Bellart did not enjoy much success, however, because there were few buyers for his books in the &quot;Nederduits&quot; language. Most people who could afford a book wanted it to be in French, since that was the common language of the ruling classes. Perhaps the strongest evidence in favor of Gutenberg is therefore that Mainz has in its possession today a first-edition of Erasmus&#x27; &quot; Lof der Zotheid&quot; (English translation: &quot;The Praise of Folly&quot;), which was written in Gouda, but printed in Mainz in 1511. The earliest printed book from the Netherlands that has been dated with any certainty is from 1473. It is in the possession of the Museum Meermanno-Westreenianum and was printed in Utrecht, not Haarlem.

==300th anniversary==

In 1740 Martin Holtzhey produced a medal to commemorate 300 years of printing and Coster&#x27;s invention. At the top of the allegorical scene, the heraldic shields of 4 men can be seen in addition to the coat of arms of Haarlem. They were all mayors of Haarlem and their names were Anthony van Styrum (1679-1756), who also served in the admiralty of Amsterdam, Pieter van der Camer (1666-1747), who commissioned his own commemorative medal to celebrate 50 years in the service of the &quot;vroedschap&quot; of Haarlem in 1743, Jan van Dyck, and Cornelis Ascanius van Sypesteyn (1694-1744), who himself was a collector of medals and who lived at Brederode. This medal set a historical precedent in Haarlem for commemorative medals; Sypesteyn&#x27;s son Cornelis Ascanius van Sypesteyn (1723-1788) later became the founding director of the learned society Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen and its offshoot, the &quot;Oeconomische Tak&quot;, and he hired Holtzhey&#x27;s son Johann Georg to commission prize medals for both societies.
==400th anniversary==
In 1823 Haarlem celebrated the 400th anniversary of Coster&#x27;s invention with a monument in the Haarlemmerhout. The monument is decorated with Latin inscriptions and a memorial text in Dutch, with symbolic &quot;A&quot; decorations at the top. The celebration was organized by Abraham de Vries, a Coster fan who became Haarlem&#x27;s first librarian in 1821 and who received a commission from the city fathers to acquire &quot;Costeriana&quot;, or material relating to Coster&#x27;s claim to fame. De Vries was supported by the professor and city council member David Jacob van Lennep, who believed the legend and sponsored De Vries by obtaining funds from the city council for the monument. In the period after the Flanders Campaign which led to the French occupation of the Netherlands from 1794 to 1815, Haarlem&#x27;s economy was severely depressed and the city council sought a local hero. In 1817, Van Lennep (who was in the city council at the time) had also placed the monument De Naald (Heemstede) at his own home in nearby Heemstede.

==Joh. Enschedé==
Behind the St. Bavochurch the printing factory of Joh. Enschedé was located, which from 1737 to 1940 printed the Oprechte Haerlemsche Courant and from 1810 onwards became a mint that printed banknotes and later postage stamps. Just as it had been in Coornhert&#x27;s time, supporting the Coster legend became a publicity stunt for one of Haarlem&#x27;s most important businesses, and the Enschedé company complied by offering tours of the printing presses, and even opened the Museum Enschedé in 1904 on the Klokhuisplein (now the location of a memorial plaque). Today, &quot;Costeriana&quot; still can be viewed (by appointment) in the collections of the Haarlem Public Library, the Museum Enschedé, and the Teyler&#x27;s Museum.

<text>Land Rover is a British brand of predominantly four-wheel drive, off-road capable vehicles, owned by multinational car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), since 2008 a subsidiary of India&#x27;s Tata Motors. JLR builds Land Rovers in Brazil, China, India, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom. The Land Rover name was created in 1948 by the Rover Company for a utilitarian 4WD off-road vehicle. Currently, the Land Rover range consists solely of upmarket and luxury sport utility vehicles.

Land Rover was granted a Royal Warrant by King George VI in 1951. In 2001, it received a Queen&#x27;s Award for Enterprise for outstanding contribution to international trade. Over time, Land Rover grew into its own brand, and for a while also a company, encompassing a consistently growing range of four-wheel drive, off-road capable models. Starting with the much more upmarket 1970 Range Rover, and subsequent introductions of the mid-range Discovery and entry-level Freelander line, in 1989 and 1997, as well as the 1990 Land Rover Defender refresh, the marque today includes two models of Discovery, four distinct models of Range Rover, and after a three-year hiatus, a second generation of Defenders have gone into production for the 2020 model year – in short or long wheelbase, as before.

For half a century, from the original 1948 model, to 1997, when the Freelander was introduced, Land Rovers and Range Rovers exclusively relied on their trademark boxed-section vehicle frames. Land Rover used boxed frames in a direct product bloodline until the termination of the original Defender in 2016. Their last body-on-frame model was replaced by a monocoque with the third generation Discovery in 2017. Since then, all Land Rovers and Range Rovers have a unified body and frame structure.

Since 2010, Land Rover has introduced two-wheel drive variants, both of the Freelander, and of the Evoque, after having built exclusively 4WD cars for 62 years. The 2WD Freelander has been succeeded by a 2WD Discovery Sport, available in some markets.

== History ==
Originally, these vehicles were simply called the &#x27;Land Rover&#x27; – an off-road capable car model of the Rover Company. As &#x27;Land Rover&#x27; became established as a brand, the &#x27;Series&#x27; indication later became a retronym model name. The Range Rover was introduced in 1970, and the company became a British Leyland subsidiary in 1978. In 1983 and 1984, the long and the short wheelbase Land Rovers were given official names – the One Ten, and the Ninety respectively. Together they were badged the Defender models in 1990, after the 1989 introduction of the new Discovery model.

=== Rover era ===


The design for the original vehicle was started in 1947 by Maurice Wilks. Wilks, chief designer at the Rover Company, on his farm in Newborough, Anglesey, worked in conjunction with his brother Spencer who was the managing director of Rover. The design may have been influenced by the Jeep and the prototype, later nicknamed Centre Steer, was built on a Jeep chassis and axles. The early choice of colour was dictated by military surplus supplies of aircraft cockpit paint, so early vehicles only came in various shades of light green. Starting with the series I Land Rover, all models in this era featured sturdy box-section ladder-frame chassis. Early vehicles like the Series I were field-tested at Long Bennington and designed to be field-serviced.

After the formation of Land Rover Limited in 1978 the hyphen in Land-Rover – as shown in the logo – began to be dropped.

=== Land Rover Ltd – subsidiary of BL ===
Land Rover as a company has existed since 1978. Prior to this, it was a product line of the Rover Company, which was absorbed into the Rover-Triumph division of the British Leyland Motor Corporation (BL) following Leyland Motor Corporation&#x27;s takeover of Rover in 1967. The ongoing commercial success of the original Land Rover series models and the Range Rover in the 1970s, in the midst of BL&#x27;s well-documented business troubles, prompted the establishment of a separate Land Rover company under the BL umbrella, remaining part of the subsequent Rover Group in 1988 under the ownership of British Aerospace, after British Leyland was broken up and privatised.

=== BMW era ===
On 31 January 1994, Rover Group plc, including Land Rover, was acquired by BMW. In 2000, Rover Group was broken up by BMW and Land Rover was sold on to Ford Motor Company, becoming part of its Premier Automotive Group. The transition to BMW ownership only just preceded the introduction of the second generation Range Rover, prior to launching Land Rover&#x27;s first unibody model, the Freelander in 1997. BMW was then responsible for much of the development of the Range Rover III – the first to have a monocoque structure and independent suspension, introduced under Ford in late 2001.

=== Ford era ===
After the introduction of the all-new Range Rover in 2001, Ford moved Land Rover further away from its traditional boxed ladder-frames, by introducing a new generation Discovery featuring &quot;Integrated Body Frame&quot;, in 2004. From then on, only the Defender continued on Land Rover&#x27;s traditional since 1948 underpinnings. Use of the Rover V8 engine in Land Rovers also ended with the replacement of the mk. II Discovery.

In 2006 Ford also purchased the Rover brand from BMW for around £6 million. BMW had retained ownership of the brand to protect the integrity of the Land Rover brand, with which &#x27;Rover&#x27; might be confused in the US – market, and allowed it to be used under licence by MG Rover until it collapsed in 2005, at which point it was offered to the Ford Motor Company, who by then owned Land Rover. On 11 June 2007, Ford announced that it planned to sell Land Rover along with Jaguar Cars. Private equity firms such as Alchemy Partners of the UK, TPG Capital, Ripplewood Holdings, Cerberus Capital Management and One Equity Partners of the US, Tata Motors of India and a consortium comprising Mahindra &amp; Mahindra of India and Apollo Management all initially expressed interest in purchasing the marques from the Ford Motor Company. On 1 January 2008, Ford formally declared that Tata was the preferred bidder. On 26 March 2008, Ford announced that it had agreed to sell its Jaguar and Land Rover operations to Tata Motors, and that it expected to complete the sale by the end of the second quarter of 2008.

=== Tata Motors era ===
On 18 January 2008, Tata Motors, a part of the Tata Group, established Jaguar Land Rover Limited as a British-registered and wholly owned subsidiary. The new company was to be used as a holding company for the acquisition of the two businesses from Ford – Jaguar Cars Limited and Land Rover. That acquisition was completed on 2 June 2008 at a cost of £1.7 billion. Included in the deal to buy Land Rover and Jaguar Cars were the rights to three other British brands: the Daimler marque, as well as two dormant brands Lanchester and Rover.

On 1 January 2013, the group, which had been operating as two separate companies (Jaguar Cars Limited and Land Rover), although on an integrated basis, underwent a fundamental restructuring. The parent company was renamed to Jaguar Land Rover Automotive PLC, Jaguar Cars Limited was renamed to Jaguar Land Rover Limited and the assets (excluding certain Chinese interests) of Land Rover were transferred to it. The consequence was that Jaguar Land Rover Limited became responsible in the UK for the design, manufacture and marketing of both Jaguar and Land Rover branded products, and Land Rover and Jaguar Cars ceased to be separate vehicle producing entities.

== Manufacturing ==
Jaguar Land Rover manufactures Land Rover cars in plants in five countries. In the United Kingdom the Range Rover, Range Rover Sport and Range Rover Velar are built at their Solihull plant near Birmingham and the Discovery Sport and Evoque are built at their Halewood plant near Liverpool. In October 2018 JLR opened a new plant in Nitra, Slovakia to build the Discovery, and are now also building the 2020 Defender there. In Brazil the company builds both the Discovery Sport and Evoque in their plant in Itatiaia which was opened in June 2016. JLR has been building cars since 2011 in Pune, India and currently builds the Discovery Sport and Evoque there. Under a 50/50 joint venture with Chery at Changshu in China Discovery Sports and Evoques are also built.

Historically Land Rovers were manufactured primarily at the Solihull plant until production of the Freelander was moved to the Halewood plant. The Freelander was also assembled in CKD form at Land Rover&#x27;s facility in Pune, India. As of 2015, the company continued to expand by building locally in India as well as increasing the number of models made at JLR&#x27;s Chikhali facility near Pune to include the Discovery Sport and Evoque.

Defender models were assembled under licence in several locations worldwide, including Spain (Santana Motors), Iran (Pazhan Morattab), Brazil (Karmann), and Turkey (Otokar).

== Global sales ==
=== Global and regional unit sales ===
Worldwide sales of Land Rover tripled from model year 2008/&#x27;09 to 2014/&#x27;15 (from almost 130,000 to some 385,000 units), to peak at a further 10% higher in &#x27;15/&#x27;16 and &#x27;16/&#x27;17, and have since slid by some 100,000 (to 320,000 units) in 2018/&#x27;19. In spite of the facts, that Australia and New Zealand were important Land Rover markets in the 20th century, and sales in the Asia Pacific region have quadrupled from 2008/&#x27;09 to 2014/&#x27;15, Land Rover have stopped publishing sales of that region separately – instead including them in &quot;Rest of World&quot; starting 2015/&#x27;16.

Overall, Europe is the firm&#x27;s primary market, consistently yielding 40% to 50% of global units sold. Generally, half of that is down to the home (UK) market. Sales in the U.K. and the U.S. have generally kept equal pace, but since 2012 China has taken the lead as Land Rover&#x27;s biggest single country market, except for 2018/&#x27;19.

Per calendar year: 
Per model year: 
=== Unit sales by model ===
The Discovery Sport is the most successful Land Rover model, selling 95,520 units globally in 2018. This was followed by another &#x27;sports&#x27; model, the Range Rover Sport, at 77,847 units.
The Discovery Sport is the successor to the brands Freelander model, which was Europe&#x27;s best selling – for five years in a row, after its market introduction in 1997.

Land Rover DC100 – Land Rover&#x27;s third concept vehicle, first unveiled at the 2011 Frankfurt Auto Show, designed to be a replacement for the Land Rover Defender, though it is unlikely that the Defender&#x27;s replacement will be exactly the same as the DC100 concept.

Land Rover Discovery Vision Concept – Land Rover&#x27;s fourth concept vehicle, first unveiled at the 2014, was designed to be a replacement for the Land Rover Discovery, This concept features Transparent Bonnet, Suicide doors, and Laser assisted lamps (there is a very little chance this will be included in any future production vehicles).

=== Engines ===
During the history of the Land Rover many different engines have been fitted:
* The inlet-over-exhaust petrol engines (&quot;semi side-valve&quot;), in both four- and six-cylinder variants, which were used for the first Land Rovers in 1948, and which had their origins in pre-war Rover cars. Displacement of the first models was 1,600 cc.
* The four-cylinder overhead-valve engines, both petrol and diesel, which first appeared (in diesel form) in 1957, near the end of Series One production, and evolved over the years to the 300 TDi turbodiesel, which remains in production today for some overseas markets.
* The Buick-sourced all aluminium Rover V8 engine.
* 1,997 cc Petrol, inlet-over-exhaust: Series I engine, carried over for the first few months of Series II production.
* 2,052 cc Diesel, overhead-valve: Land Rover&#x27;s first diesel engine, and one of the first small high-speed diesels produced in the UK. It appeared in 1957, and was used in Series II production until 1961. Looks almost identical to the later 2,286 cc engine, but many internal differences. It produced .
* 2,286 cc Petrol, overhead-valve, three-bearing crank:
* 2,286 cc Diesel, overhead-valve, three-bearing crank: Appeared in 1961 alongside the redesigned 2,286 cc petrol engine at the start of Series IIA production, and shared its cylinder block and some other components. It produced .
* 2,625 cc Petrol, inlet-over-exhaust: Borrowed from the Rover saloon range, in response to demands from mid-1960s Land Rover users for more power and torque.
* 2,286 cc petrol/diesel, overhead-valve type 11J: five-bearing crank: In 1980, Land Rover finally did something about the crank failures which had plagued its four-cylinder engines for 22 years. These engines lasted beyond the end of Series III production and into the first couple of years of the new Ninety and One Ten ranges.
* 3,258 cc V8 Petrol: The ex-Buick all alloy V8 engine appeared in the Range Rover right from the start of production in 1970, but did not make its way into the company&#x27;s utility vehicles until 1979.
* 2,495 cc petrol, overhead valve: The final development of Land Rover&#x27;s ohv petrol &#x27;four&#x27;, with hardened valve seats which allow running on unleaded (or LPG).
* 2,495 cc diesel, overhead valve, type 12J: Land Rover reworked the old &#x27;two and a quarter&#x27; diesel for the 1980s. The injection pump was driven off a toothed belt at the front of the engine (together with the camshaft), a change compared with the older diesels.

, most Land Rovers in production are powered by Ford engines. Under the terms of the acquisition, Tata has the right to buy engines from Ford until 2019.

== Electric vehicles ==
Integrated Electric Rear Axle Drive (ERAD) technology, dubbed e-terrain technology, will allow the vehicle to without starting the engine as well as supplying extra power over tough terrain. Land Rover&#x27;s Diesel ERAD Hybrid was developed as part of a multimillion-pound project supported by the UK Government&#x27;s Energy Saving Trust, under the low carbon research and development programme. ERAD programme is one of a broad range of sustainability-focused engineering programmes that Land Rover is pursuing, brought together by the company under the collective name &quot;e TERRAIN Technologies&quot;.

Land Rover presented at the 2008 London Motor Show its new ERAD diesel–electric hybrid in a pair of Freelander 2 (LR2) prototypes. The new hybrid system is being designed as a scalable and modular system that could be applied across a variety of Land Rover models and powertrains.

Land Rover unveiled the LRX hybrid concept at the 2008 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, for it to be going into production. An ERAD will enable the car to run on electric power at speeds below .

In September 2011, the Range Rover Evoque was launched, though it was based on the LRX hybrid concept presented at the 2008 North American International Auto Show, it did not include the ERAD system, included in the original concept.

In February 2013, Land Rover unveiled at the 83rd Geneva Motor Show an All-Terrain Electric Defender that produces zero emissions. The electric vehicle was developed for research purposes following successful trials of the Defender-based electric vehicle, Leopard 1. The vehicle is capable of producing 70kW and 330Nm of torque and has a range of 80 kilometres or in low speed off-road use it can last for up to eight hours before recharging.

== Abilities ==

Power take-off (PTO) was integral to the Land Rover concept from 1948, enabling farm machinery and many other items to be run with the vehicle stationary. Maurice Wilks&#x27; original instruction was &quot;...to have power take-offs everywhere!&quot; The 1949 report by British National Institute of Agricultural Engineering and Scottish Machinery Testing Station contained this description: &quot;the power take-off is driven through a Hardy Spicer propeller shaft from the main gearbox output and two interchangeable pinions giving two ratios. 

The PTO gearbox casing is bolted to the rear chassis cross-member and an belt pulley driven from the PTO shaft through two bevel gears can be bolted to the PTO gearbox casing.&quot; PTOs remained regular options on Series I, II and III Land Rovers up to the demise of the Series Land Rover in 1985. An agricultural PTO on a Defender is possible as a special order.

Land Rovers (the Series/Defender models) are available in a variety of body styles, from a simple canvas-topped pick-up truck to a twelve-seat fully trimmed station wagon. Both Land Rover and out-of-house contractors have offered conversions and adaptations to the basic vehicle, such as fire engines, excavators, &#x27;cherry picker&#x27; hydraulic platforms, ambulances, snowploughs, and six-wheel-drive versions, as well as one-off special builds including amphibious Land Rovers and vehicles fitted with tracks instead of wheels.

=== Military use ===

Various Land Rover models have been used in a military capacity, most notably by the British Army and Australian Army. Modifications may include military &quot;blackout&quot; lights, heavy-duty suspension, uprated brakes, 24 volt electrics, convoy lights, electronic suppression of the ignition system, blackout curtains and mounts for special equipment and small arms. Dedicated military models have been produced such as the 101 Forward Control and the air-portable 1/2 ton Lightweight. Military uses include light utility vehicle; communications platform; weapon platform for recoilless rifles, Anti-tank (e.g. TOW or M40 recoilless rifle) / Surface-to-Air Guided Weapons or machine guns; ambulances and workshops. The Discovery has also been used in small numbers, mostly as liaison vehicles.

Two models that have been designed for military use from the ground up are the 101 Forward Control from the early 1970s and the Lightweight or Airportable from the late 1960s. The latter was intended to be transported under a helicopter. The Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service (RAFMRS) teams were early users in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and their convoys of Land Rovers and larger military trucks are a sight often seen in the mountain areas of the United Kingdom. Originally RAFMRS Land Rovers had blue bodies and bright yellow tops, to be better seen from above. In 1981, the colour scheme was changed to green with yellow stripes. More recently, vehicles have been painted white, and are issued with fittings similar to civilian UK Mountain Rescue teams.
An adaptation of Land Rovers to military purposes is the &quot;Pink Panther&quot; models. Approximately 100 Series IIA models were adapted to reconnaissance use by British special operations forces the SAS. For desert use they were often painted pink, hence the name. The vehicles were fitted with among other gear a sun compass, machine guns, larger fuel tanks and smoke dischargers. Similar adaptations were later made to Series IIIs and 90/110/Defenders.

The Australian Army adapted the Land Rover Series 2 into the Long Range Patrol Vehicle for use by the Special Air Service Regiment and as an anti-tank &quot;gunbuggy&quot; fitted with an M40 recoilless rifle.

The 75th Ranger Regiment of the United States Army also adapted twelve versions of the Land Rover that were officially designated the Ranger Special Operations Vehicle.

Series and Defender models have also been armoured. The most widespread of these is the Shorts Shorland, built by Shorts Brothers of Belfast. The first of these were delivered in 1965 to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the Northern Ireland police force. They were originally wheelbase models with an armoured body and a turret from the Ferret armoured car. By 1990, there had been more than 1,000 produced.

In the 1970s, a more conventional armoured Land Rover was built for the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Wales called the Hotspur. The Land Rover Tangi was built by the Royal Ulster Constabulary&#x27;s own vehicle engineering team during the 1990s. The British Army has used various armoured Land Rovers, first in Northern Ireland but also in more recent campaigns. They first added protective panels to Series General Service vehicles, the Vehicle Protection Kit (VPK). 

Later they procured the Glover Webb APV and finally the Courtaulds (later NP Aerospace) Composite Armoured Vehicle, commonly known as Snatch. These were originally based on heavy-duty V8 110 chassis but some have recently been re-mounted on new chassis from Otokar of Turkey and fitted with diesel engines and air-conditioning for Iraq. Although these now have more in common with the &#x27;Wolf&#x27; (Defender XD) Land Rovers that many mistakenly confuse them with, the Snatch and the Wolf are different vehicles.

The most radical conversion of a Land Rover for military purposes was the Centaur half-track. It was based on a Series III with a V8 engine and a shortened belt drive from the Alvis Scorpion light tank. A small number was manufactured, and they were used by Ghana, among others.

The Land Rover is used by military forces throughout the world. The current generation of Land Rover used by British Army, the Snatch 2, have upgraded and strengthened chassis and suspension compared to civilian-specification vehicles. There is also the Land Rover WMIK (weapon mounted installation kit) used by British Army. The WMIK consists of a driver, a raised gun, usually a Browning heavy machine gun or a grenade machine gun, this used for ground support, and a GPMG (general-purpose machine gunner) located next to the driver, this used for vehicle protection.

=== Competitive use ===
Highly modified Land Rovers have competed in the Dakar Rally and won the Macmillan – UK Challenge almost every year, as well as having been the vehicle used for the Camel Trophy. Now, Land Rover has its own G4 challenge.

== Driver training ==
Land Rover Experience was established in 1990, and consists of a network of centres throughout the world, set up to help customers get the most out of their vehicles&#x27; on and off-road capability. The flagship centres are Land Rover&#x27;s bases at Solihull, Eastnor, Gaydon and Halewood. Courses offered include off-road driving, winching and trailer handling, along with a variety of corporate and individual &#x27;Adventure Days&#x27;. The factory centres at Solihull and Halewood have manufacturing tours, while Gaydon has an engineering tour.

== Safety ==

Model-by-model road accident statistics from the UK Department for Transport published in 2006 showed that the Land Rover Defender was one of the safest cars on British roads as measured by chance of death in two-car injury accidents. The figures, which were based on data collected by police forces following accidents between 2000 and 2004 in Great Britain, showed that Defender drivers had a 1% chance of being killed or seriously injured and a 33% chance of sustaining any kind of injury. Other four-wheel-drive vehicles scored equally highly, and collectively these vehicles were much safer for their passengers than those in other classes such as passenger cars and MPVs. These figures reflect the fact that drivers of large mass vehicles are likely to be safer, often at the expense of other drivers if they collide with smaller cars.

== Clubs ==
The original Land Rover Owners Club was set up by the Rover Company in 1954. The company published the &quot;Land Rover Owners Club Review&quot; magazine for members from 1957 to 1968 when the club became the Rover Owners Association. This original association fell away when the company merged with British Leyland.

There are many Land Rover clubs throughout the UK and internationally. Land Rover clubs break down into a number of groups of varying interests.

Single Marque Clubs – Bring together owners of a specific model or series of vehicle such as the Land Rover Series One Club, or the Discovery Owners Club. Single marque clubs have a global membership.

Special Vehicle Clubs – At various times Land Rover have produced vehicles for specific events or on a specific theme, most notable are the Camel Trophy and G4 Challenge vehicles which have been sold on to the general public, and a range of Defenders that were loosely based on the custom vehicles produced for the Tomb Raider motion picture.

Regional Clubs in the UK break down into two groups, competitive and non-competitive. The non-competitive clubs activities generally relate to social events, off-road driving or green laning on un-surfaced public highways or &#x27;pay and play&#x27; days at off-road centres. Competitive clubs are a phenomenon almost exclusively found within the UK, who as well as the non-competitive activities detailed above run competitive events such as Tyro, Road Taxed Vehicle (RTV) and Cross Country Vehicle (CCV) trials, winch and recovery challenges or speed events such as Competitive Safaries. All UK competitive events are run within the framework of rules created by the Motor Sports Association (MSA) with further vehicle specific rules applied by the host club or association. Outside of the UK regional clubs are independent and mostly non-competitive.

A number of clubs are affiliated to the Association of Land Rover Clubs (ALRC); formerly known as the Association of Rover Clubs (ARC) the association applies its own vehicle regulations to all of its member clubs who have the opportunity to compete together at regional events and an annual national event with vehicles approved to the same standard. In recent years some non-competitive clubs have dropped their affiliation fifth ALRC. Few clubs outside of the UK are affiliated with ALRC. Other than ALRC and the short lived Association of North American Rover Clubs (ANARC), which was created 1998 to celebrate Land Rover&#x27;s 50th anniversary and disbanded in 2001, other groups of Land Rover clubs have affiliated with each other.

Land Rover owners were also early adopters of virtual clubs that are entirely based online. Bill Caloccia created the original Land Rover Owner email list (LRO) as single marque offshoot of the British Cars email list in May 1990. Bill later created email lists in the mid-1990s for Range Rovers (RRO) and various regions (e.g., UK-LRO, AU-LRO, ZA-LRO, EU-LRO, IT-LRO, NL-LRO). In California members of the LRO list created mendo_recce in 1995.

In 2005, under Ford ownership, Land Rover became more interested in the club environment. An internal club was formed, The Land Rover Club, exclusive to employees of Ford&#x27;s Premier Automotive Group (Now exclusive to the new &#x27;Jaguar – Land Rover&#x27; group since the brand moved away from the Ford stable). Also, an agreement was generated to allow other clubs to use the Land Rover green oval logo under licence. In 2006, the Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire club were the pilot licensees for the new agreement, who now benefit from a reciprocal arrangement where their own logo is trade marked and owned by Land Rover and they can refer to themselves as a &#x27;Land Rover Approved Club&#x27;.

== Brand extensions ==
=== Bicycles ===
In 1995, Land Rover endorsed the production of a hand-made bicycle using its logo. The bicycle, called the Land Rover APB and manufactured by Pashley Cycles of Stratford-upon-Avon, was the collapsible version of Pashley Cycles&#x27; Moulton APB (All Purpose Bicycle) model, with leading link front suspension and adjustable damping and stroke. Two more models immediately followed: the Land Rover XCB V-20, aimed primarily at younger riders (children); and the Land Rover XCB D-26, also available as the M26 with hydraulic rim brakes, front suspension and suspension seat pillar.

In June 2004, Land Rover released a comprehensive 25 model range of bicycles. The three main ranges are the &quot;Defender&quot;, the &quot;Discovery&quot;, and the &quot;Freelander&quot;, each with different attributes. The &quot;Discovery&quot; is an all-rounder bicycle suited to a variety of terrains, &quot;Defender&quot; is most suited to rugged terrain and off-road pursuits, whereas the &quot;Freelander&quot; is designed for an urban lifestyle. All bikes are made from lightweight aluminium.

In 2010 the range was relaunched in conjunction with British manufacturer 2x2.

=== Coffee ===
Land Rover has had its name associated with coffee since 2005, when the Land Rover Coffee company was established.

=== Pushchairs ===
Land Rover gave UK pram company Pegasus a licence to produce a three-wheeler range of Land Rover ATP pushchairs. The design reflected the heritage of the marque, with a light metal frame with canvas seating, held together with push-studs and tough simple parts like brakes and hinges. They could be collapsed completely flat, with wheels removed in seconds. The basic frame could be adapted with modules to allow a baby to lie flat or a bubble windscreen to completely enclose the child. The frame also came in long or short-handled versions, and could be repaired with home tools. The design was simple, light, and rugged and able to travel in all terrains (hence the ATP for all-terrain pushchair.) It came in three military looking colours: a light blue, a sand colour and olive drab. Production was discontinued in 2002.

<doc id="18727" wikidata="Q10372079" url="?curid=18727" title="International Numbering System for Food Additives">
<text>The International Numbering System for Food Additives (INS) is an international naming system for food additives, aimed at providing a short designation of what may be a lengthy actual name. It is defined by Codex Alimentarius, the international food standards organisation of the World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN). The information is published in the document &quot;Class Names and the International Numbering System for Food Additives&quot;, first published in 1989, with revisions in 2008 and 2011. The INS is an open list, &quot;subject to the inclusion of additional additives or removal of existing ones on an ongoing basis&quot;.

==Numbering system==
INS numbers consist of three or four digits, optionally followed by an alphabetical suffix to further characterize individual additives. On packaging in the European Union (EU), approved food additives are written with a prefix of &quot;E&quot;. An additive that appears in the INS does not automatically have a corresponding E number.

INS numbers are assigned by the committee to identify each food additive. INS numbers generally correspond to E numbers for the same compound, e.g. INS 102, Tartrazine, is also E102. INS numbers are not unique and, in fact, one number may be assigned to a group of similar compounds.

==List of INS numbers==

*Except where stated, the list of INS numbers and associated food additives is based on the most recent publication of the Codex Alimentarius, &quot;Class Names and the International Numbering System for Food Additives&quot;, first published in 1989, with revisions in 2008 and 2011.
*E number and American approval flags are derived from other sources.
*In the table below, food additives approved for the EU are listed with an &#x27;E&#x27;, and those approved for Australia and New Zealand with an &#x27;A&#x27;. and for the US with a U, even though the US does not use the INS numbering system.

<text>Wilhelm Ostwald’s dilution law is a relationship proposed in 1888 between the dissociation constant &#x27; and the [[Dissociation (chemistry)#Dissociation degree|degree of dissociation]]&#x27; of a weak electrolyte. The law takes the form

:formula_1

Where the square brackets denote concentration, and is the total concentration of electrolyte.

Using formula_2, where formula_3 is the molar conductivity at concentration c and formula_4 is the limiting value of molar conductivity extrapolated to zero concentration or infinite dilution, this results in the following relation:

:formula_5

==Derivation==

Consider a binary electrolyte AB which dissociates reversibly into A+ and B− ions. Ostwald noted that the law of mass action can be applied to such systems as dissociating electrolytes. The equilibrium state is represented by the equation:

:&lt;chem&gt;AB &lt;=&gt; {A+} + B^-&lt;/chem&gt;

If &#x27; is the fraction of dissociated electrolyte, then &#x27; is the concentration of each ionic species. must, therefore be the fraction of &quot;undissociated&quot; electrolyte, and the concentration of same. The dissociation constant may therefore be given as

:formula_6

For very weak electrolytes (however, neglecting &#x27;α&#x27; for most weak electrolytes yields counterproductive result) , implying that .

:formula_7

This gives the following results;

:formula_8

Thus, the degree of dissociation of a weak electrolyte is proportional to the inverse square root of the concentration, or the square root of the dilution. The concentration of any one ionic species is given by the root of the product of the dissociation constant and the concentration of the electrolyte.

:formula_9

==Limitations==

The Ostwald law of dilution provides a satisfactory description of the concentration dependence of the conductivity of weak electrolytes like CH3COOH and NH4OH. The variation of molar conductivity is essentially due to the incomplete dissociation of weak electrolytes into ions. 

For strong electrolytes, however, Lewis and Randall recognized that the law fails badly since the supposed equilibrium constant is actually far from constant. This is because the dissociation of strong electrolytes into ions is essentially complete below a concentration threshold value. The decrease in molar conductivity as a function of concentration is actually due to attraction between ions of opposite charge as expressed in the Debye-Hückel-Onsager equation and later revisions.

Even for weak electrolytes the equation is not exact. Chemical thermodynamics shows that the true equilibrium constant is a ratio of thermodynamic activities, and that each concentration must be multiplied by an activity coefficient. This correction is important for ionic solutions due to the strong forces between ionic charges. An estimate of their values is given by the Debye–Hückel theory at low concentrations.

<text>Lleida (, ; ; &quot;see below&quot;) is a city in the west of Catalonia, Spain. It is the capital and largest town in Segrià county, the Ponent region and the province of Lleida. Geographically, it is located in the Catalan Central Depression. It had 140,797 inhabitants .

Lleida is one of the oldest towns in Catalonia, with recorded settlements dating back to the Bronze Age period. Until the Roman conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, the area served as a settlement for an Iberian people, the Ilergetes. The town became a municipality, named Ilerda, under the reign of Augustus. It was ruled by Muslims from the 8th century until reconquered in 1149. In 1297, the University of Lleida was founded, becoming the third oldest in the whole of Spain. During the following centuries, the town was damaged by several wars such as the Reapers&#x27; War in the 17th century and the Spanish Civil War in the 20th century. Since then, the city has been in constant urban, commercial and demographic growth.

==Name==
Although the usual Spanish form of the town&#x27;s name is , pronounced , the associations of that name with enforced Castilianization under the Francoist regime have led to the Catalan form being used for official purposes even in Spanish. The local pronunciation of the name is , while the standard pronunciation is .

==History==
In ancient times the city, named &quot;Iltrida&quot; and &quot;Ilerda&quot;, was the chief city of the Ilergetes, an Iberian tribe. Indíbil, king of the Ilergetes, and Mandoni, king of the Ausetanes, defended it against the Carthaginian and Roman invasions.

Under the Romans the city was incorporated into the Roman province of Hispania Tarraconensis, and was a place of considerable importance, historically as well as geographically. It stood upon an eminence, on the right (west) bank of the river Sicoris (the modern Segre), the principal tributary of the Ebre, and some distance above its confluence with the Cinga (modern Cinca); thus commanding the country between those rivers, as well as the great road from Tarraco (modern Tarragona), the provincial capital, to the northwest of Spain, which here crossed the Sicoris.

Its situation induced the legates of Pompey in Spain to make it the key of their defense against Caesar, in the first year of the Civil War (49 BC). Afranius and Marcus Petreius threw themselves into the place with five legions; and their siege by Caesar himself (Battle of Ilerda), as narrated in his own words, forms one of the most interesting passages of military history. Caesar&#x27;s skill as a general, in a contest where the formation of the district and a series of natural events seemed very favorable to his enemies, ultimately gained him victory. It was ended by the capitulation of Afranius and Petreius. In consequence of the battle, the Latin phrase &quot;Ilerdam videas&quot; is said to have been used by people who wanted to cast bad luck on someone else.

Under the Roman Empire Ilerda was a prosperous city and a &quot;municipium&quot;. It minted its own coins. It had a fine stone bridge over the Sicoris, which was so sturdy that its foundations support a bridge to this day. In the time of Ausonius the city had fallen into decay but it rose again into importance in the Middle Ages.

It was part of Visigothic and Muslim Hispania until it was conquered from the Moors by Count Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona in 1149.

It used to be the seat of a major university, the oldest in the Crown of Aragon, until 1717, when it was moved by Philip V to the nearby town of Cervera. The University of Lleida is nowadays active again since 1991.

During the Reapers&#x27; War Lleida was occupied by the French and rebel forces. In 1644 the city was conquered by the Spanish under Felipe da Silva.

Lleida served as a key defence point for Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War and fell to the Insurgents, whose air forces bombed it extensively in 1937 and 1938. The 2 November 1937 Condor Legion attacks against Lleida became especially infamous since they targeted the school known as &quot;Liceu Escolar de Lleida&quot;. 48 children and several teachers died in it that day, 300 people were killed in the 2 November bombings altogether and the town would be bombed and besieged again in 1938, when it was conquered by Francisco Franco&#x27;s forces.

After some decades without any kind of population growth it experienced a massive influx of Andalusians, who helped the town undergo a relative demographic growth. Nowadays it is home to immigrants of 146 different nationalities.

Lleida was the Capital of Catalan Culture in 2007.

=== Jewish History ===

The &quot;Juderia&quot;, or Jewish quarter in Lleida dates back to the 11th century. The Jewish quarter in Lleida was also referred to as La Cuirassa. This name distinction is unique compared to other Jewish communities in Spain, and historians believe that the origin of the term is linked to the former Jewish quarter that existed in the times of the Moors, which was connected to the &quot;coiraça&quot;, a protrusion of the city wall. The Jews established their quarter next to this wall, leading to the name &quot;La Cuirassa.&quot; A street named &quot;Judería&quot;, which still exists in today&#x27;s Lleida dates back to the time where the Jewish quarter was still active. The Jewish quarter was located in the fortified area of Lleida; in this area, a ring with the name &quot;Goig&quot; carved in Hebrew was found in 1870.
A Jewish ritual bath, or mikveh dating to the 9th century, one of the oldest in Europe, was found in Lleida.

==Climate==
Lleida has a temperate semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;). Winters are mild and foggy though cooler than places on the coast while summers are hot and dry. Frosts are common during winter although snowfall can occasionally fall, averaging 1 or 2 days. Precipitation is low, with an annual average of with a peak in April and May and another peak in September and October. 

==Districts and neighbourhoods==

Lleida is divided in the following districts by the Socioeconomic Observatory of Lleida:

*Balàfia

==Transport==
===Railway===

Lleida is served by Renfe&#x27;s Madrid–Barcelona high-speed rail line, serving Barcelona, Zaragoza, Calatayud, Guadalajara, and Madrid. Lleida has a new airport opened in January 2010, and a minor airfield located in Alfès. Also, the town is the western terminus of the Eix Transversal Lleida-Girona, and a railway covering the same distance (&quot;Eix Transversal Ferroviari&quot;) is currently under planning.

Lleida&#x27;s only passenger railway station is Lleida Pirineus. It is served by both Renfe and Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya train lines. In the future a Rodalies Lleida commuter network will connect the town with its adjacent area and the main towns of its province, improving the existing network with more train frequency and newly built infrastructure. A second railway station is Pla de la Vilanoveta in an industrial area, and only used by freight trains. A future railway museum will be located in its facilities. Since 2008 the bulk of public transport of Lleida&#x27;s surrounding area, mainly buses operated by several companies, is managed by Autoritat Territorial de la Mobilitat de l&#x27;Àrea de Lleida.

===Bus===
The urban buses, coloured yellow with blue stripes and owned by &quot;Autobusos de Lleida&quot;, include the following lines:
*L-1 Interior
*L-2 Ronda
*L-3 Pardinyes
*L-4 Mariola – 
*L-5 Bordeta
*L-6 Magraners
*L-7 Secà
*L-8 Balàfia-Gualda
*L-9 Hospitals
*L-10 Exterior
*L-11 Llívia-Caparrella
*L-11B Llívia-Caparrella-Butsenit
*L-12 C.Històric-Universitat
*L-13 Cappont
*L-14 Agrònoms
*L-P Polígons
*L-17 Bordeta-Ciutat Jardí
*L-18 Palau de Congressos- Rambla de la Mercé
*L-19 Butsenit
*L-N Wonder (Regular night service)
*L-Bus Turístic (tourist bus)
*L-Aeroport
*L-Llotja

In addition to these, there&#x27;s a tourist bus and a regular night service to nearby clubs.

===Lleida-Pirineus airport===

Lleida has depended long time on nearby airports and had no local air transit. The Lleida-Alguaire airport opened in 2010.

===Future and planned services===
A tram-train system is pending approval. Using an existing but outdated passenger line, it would link Balaguer and Lleida, crossing both towns in a much needed move towards better public transportation, both inner-city and between localities.

==Languages==
Lleida is a traditionally Catalan-speaking city, with a characteristic dialect (known as Western or, more specifically, Northwestern Catalan, or colloquially &quot;lleidatà&quot;). Most of the population is actively bilingual in Spanish.

==Culture==

Lleida was the Capital of Catalan Culture in 2007.

===Theatre and music venues===
Enric Granados Auditorium is the city&#x27;s concert hall and main music institution and conservatory. It is named after the composer Enric Granados, who was born in the city. CaixaForum Lleida (formerly known as &quot;Centre Cultural de la Fundació La Caixa&quot;) includes a concert hall. Teatre Municipal de l&#x27;Escorxador is the town&#x27;s main theatre; it includes a concert venue, Cafè del Teatre. A theatre and congress centre, La Llotja de Lleida, opened in 2010.

===Music festivals===
There are two important music festivals in Lleida; MÚSIQUES DISPERSES Folk Festival in March, and the jazz festival JAZZ TARDOR in November. Concerts are also a regular fixture of the two local feasts, Sant Anastasi in May, and Sant Miquel in September.

===Film===
CaixaForum Lleida is the usual venue for film-related events and screenings. A Latin-American film festival is held yearly in the town (&quot;Mostra de Cinema Llatinoamericà de Lleida&quot;), and an animation film festival called &quot;Animac&quot; is held every May.

===Art and museums===
The Lleida Museum opened in 2008 and displays historical artefacts and works of art from various periods. The Institut d&#x27;Estudis Ilerdencs, a historically relevant building, exhibits both ancient and contemporary art. The Centre d&#x27;Art La Panera is a contemporary art institution. The Museu d&#x27;Art Jaume Morera displays art from the 20th and 21st centuries (as well as artwork by its namesake).

The city has a number of small municipal galleries, such as the Sala Municipal d&#x27;Exposicions de Sant Joan and the Sala Manel Garcia Sarramona. There are also several institutions dedicated to local artists, such as the Sala Leandre Cristòfol, containing artwork by the sculptor and painter Leandre Cristòfol (1908–1998); and the Sala Coma Estadella, dedicated to the sculptor and painter Albert Coma Estadella (1933–1991).

Private art galleries include the Espai Cavallers. The private foundation CaixaForum Lleida and the Public Library of Lleida also offer regular exhibits. The now defunct Petite Galerie was an innovative and influential gallery in the 1970s.

The Escola Municipal de Belles Arts provides higher education in the arts.

===Traditional culture===

Traditional celebrations include the main annual town festivity: &quot;Festa Major&quot;; &quot;Fira de Sant Miquel&quot; and &quot;L’Aplec del Caragol&quot; (escargot-eating festival, the biggest in the world of this sort, held at the Camps Elisis since 1980).

The latter is a gastronomical festivity focused on escargot cooking and is celebrated yearly at the end of May. &quot;L&#x27;Aplec&quot; gathers thousands of people around the table to taste the most traditional dishes from Lleida.

Due to its strong popularity, it was declared a traditional festivity of national interest in 2002 by the Generalitat of Catalonia and two years later it was also declared as such by the Spanish Government.

The main traditional celebrations in Lleida are chaired by the twelve emblematic &quot;Gegants de la Paeria&quot; (Giants of the Town Hall), the two oldest made in 1840.

===Nightlife===
Lleida has a bar and clubbing area, informally known as &quot;Els Vins&quot;. The oldest part of the quarter, known as &quot;Els Vins Vells&quot;, has been largely replaced by &quot;Els Vins Nous&quot;, an architecturally newer and more upscale area. Most big clubs in Lleida are located outside the town and are not easily accessible without a car, though on Saturday nights there is a bus.

==Main sights==


*La Seu Vella, a cathedral built in a blend of Romanesque and Gothic styles over time, and made a military fortress in the 18th century. There is also an older, and mostly destroyed &quot;Palau de la Suda&quot;, built during Arab rule and later used as a royal residence by the counts of Barcelona and kings of Aragon. Both medieval buildings are situated over the so-called &quot;Turó de la Seu&quot;, a medium-sized hill that overlooks the town.
*La Seu Nova, the baroque cathedral, in use since Bourbon rule. It was burnt during the Spanish Civil War by the anarchists commanded by Durruti.
*Institut d&#x27;Estudis Ilerdencs, used to be a hospital (&quot;Antic Hospital de Santa Maria&quot;) built in Gothic style, but today is a historical museum and research centre open to visitors, with historically significant artworks and artefacts from the Iberian, Roman, Arab, medieval and modern times, as well as an exhibit area usually showcasing contemporary local artists.
*La Paeria, the city council and also a historical site with remains and artefacts from Roman times through to the Moorish rule, Mediaeval and Modern times, including old prison cells.
*Gardeny is a hill hosting a fortress built between the 12th and 13th centuries. Used by the Knights Templar in the Middle Ages after the area (a fifth of the town) had been granted to them by King Ramon Berenguer IV.
*The gardens known as Camps Elisis, already used by the Romans. The Mermaid Fountain is a nice piece.
*La Mitjana, a park at the edge of town with wilderness areas adjacent to an old dam on the river Segre.
*Les Basses d&#x27;Alpicat, a park. It is currently closed, awaiting reforms.
*Church of Sant Llorenç, a 12th-century Romanesque church with 15th-century Gothic additions. The interior is well preserved.
*Church of Sant Martí, a 12th-century Romanesque church.
*The bishop of Lleida’s Palace on Rambla d&#x27;Aragó, which also serves as an art museum displaying pieces spanning from Romanesque to Baroque times.
*El Roser, a 13th-century convent built by the Dominican Order. It hosted a fine arts academy of the same name and has recently been controversially reformed and turned into a Parador (a luxury hotel using a historical location).
*The (Municipal Cemetery) to the West of the city is listed in the Inventari del Patrimoni Arquitectònic de Catalunya (Inventory of the Architectural Heritage of Catalonia). The oldest portion dates from 1784.
*Lleida Public Library, on Rambla d&#x27;Aragó, in the building previously known as La Maternitat, a mid-19th century orphanage.
*Museum of Lleida, opened in 2008, and owned by the Diocese of Lleida focusing on the town&#x27;s history. Some of the artefacts it contains, which come from areas historically belonging to the diocese but not currently part of the province of Lleida&#x27;s territory and jurisdiction, have been the object of contention with the neighbouring dioceses and the government of the autonomous community of Aragon.
*Sala Cristòfol, a museum devoted to the works of the avant-garde sculptor Leandre Cristòfol.
*Sala Mercat del Pla, an art gallery.
*Museu d&#x27;Art Jaume Morera, an art museum displaying art from the 20th and 21st centuries in a modernist building.
*Centre d&#x27;Art de la Panera, a small contemporary art institution.
*Museu de l&#x27;Aigua, in &quot;Parc de l&#x27;Aigua&quot;.

* Hefei, China
* Lérida, Colombia
* Perpignan, France
* Monterey, California, United States

==References in culture==
The city is the subject of the Catalan folk song &quot;La Presó de Lleida&quot;, &quot;The prison of Lleida&quot;, which was already attested in the 17th century and may be even older. It is a very popular tune, covered by many artists such as Joan Manuel Serrat.

<text>Le Mans (; ) is a city in Northwestern France on the Sarthe River where it meets the Huisne. Traditionally the capital of the province of Maine, it is now the capital of the Sarthe department and the seat of the Roman Catholic diocese of Le Mans. Le Mans is a part of the Pays de la Loire region.

Its inhabitants are called &quot;Manceaux&quot; (male) and &quot;Mancelles&quot; (female). Since 1923, the city has hosted the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the world&#x27;s oldest active endurance sports car race. The event is among the most attended and prestigious motor sports events in the world.

==History==
First mentioned by Claudius Ptolemy, the Roman city &quot;Vindinium&quot; was the capital of the Aulerci, a sub tribe of the Aedui. Le Mans is also known as &quot;Civitas Cenomanorum&quot; (City of the Cenomani), or &quot;Cenomanus&quot;. Their city, seized by the Romans in 47 BC, was within the ancient Roman province of Gallia Lugdunensis. A 3rd-century amphitheatre is still visible. The &quot;thermae&quot; were demolished during the crisis of the third century when workers were mobilized to build the city&#x27;s defensive walls. The ancient wall around Le Mans is one of the most complete circuits of Gallo-Roman city walls to survive.

As the use of the French language replaced late Vulgar Latin in the area, &quot;Cenomanus&quot;, with dissimilation, became known as &quot;Celmins.&quot; &quot;Cel-&quot; was taken to be a form of the French word for &quot;this&quot; and &quot;that&quot;, and was replaced by &quot;le&quot;, which means &quot;the&quot;.

As the principal city of Maine, Le Mans was the stage for struggles in the eleventh century between the counts of Anjou and the dukes of Normandy. When the Normans had control of Maine, William the Conqueror successfully invaded England and established an occupation. In 1069 the citizens of Maine revolted and expelled the Normans, resulting in Hugh V being proclaimed count of Maine. Geoffrey V of Anjou married Matilda of England in the cathedral. Their son Henry II Plantagenet, king of England, was born in the town.

In the 13th century Le Mans came under the control of the French crown. It was subsequently invaded by England during the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

Industrialization took place in the 19th century which saw the development of railway and motor vehicle production as well as textiles and tobacco manufacture.

Wilbur Wright began official public demonstrations of the airplane he had developed with his younger brother Orville on 8 August 1908, at the Hunaudières horse racing track near Le Mans.

===World War II===
Soon after Le Mans was liberated by the U.S. 79th and 90th Infantry Divisions on 8 August 1944, engineers of the Ninth Air Force IX Engineering Command began construction of a combat Advanced Landing Ground outside of the town. The airfield was declared operational on 3 September and designated as &quot;A-35&quot;. It was used by several American fighter and transport units until late November of that year in additional offensives across France; the airfield was closed.

==Climate==
Le Mans has a temperate oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) influenced by the mild Atlantic air travelling inland. Summers are warm and occasionally hot, whereas winters are mild and cloudy. Precipitation is relatively uniform and moderate year round.

==Demographics==
, there were 367,082 inhabitants in the metropolitan area (&quot;aire d&#x27;attraction&quot;) of Le Mans, with 143,252 of these living in the city proper (commune). In 1855 Le Mans absorbed four neighbouring communes. The population data for 1851 and earlier in the table and graph below refer to the pre-1855 borders.
==Transportation==

==Sport==
===Motorsport===

The first French Grand Prix took place on a 64-mile (103 km) circuit based at Le Mans in 1906.

Since the 1920s, the city has been best known for its connection with motorsports. There are two official and separate racing tracks at Le Mans, though they share certain portions. The smaller is the Bugatti Circuit (named after Ettore Bugatti, founder of the car company bearing his name), a relatively short permanent circuit, which is used for racing throughout the year and regularly hosts the French motorcycle Grand Prix. The longer and more famous Circuit de la Sarthe is composed partly of public roads. These are closed to the public when the track is in use for racing. Since 1923, this route has been used for the famous 24 Hours of Le Mans sports car endurance race. Boutiques and shops are set up during the race, selling merchandise and promoting products for cars.

The &quot;Le Mans start&quot; was formerly used in the 24-hour race: drivers lined up across the track from their cars, ran across the track, jumped into their cars and started them to begin the race.

The 1955 Le Mans disaster was a large accident during the race that killed eighty-four spectators.

===Basketball===
The city is home to Le Mans Sarthe Basket, 2006 Champion of the LNB Pro A, France&#x27;s top professional basketball division.

The team plays its home games at the Antarès, which served as one of the host arenas of the FIBA EuroBasket 1999.

<text>Lois McMaster Bujold ( ; born November 2, 1949) is an American speculative fiction writer. She has won the Hugo Award for best novel four times, matching Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s record (not counting his Retro Hugos). Her novella &quot;The Mountains of Mourning&quot; won both the Hugo Award and Nebula Award. In the fantasy genre, &quot;The Curse of Chalion&quot; won the Mythopoeic Award for Adult Literature and was nominated for the 2002 World Fantasy Award for best novel, and both her fourth Hugo Award and second Nebula Award were for &quot;Paladin of Souls&quot;. In 2011 she was awarded the Skylark Award. She has won two Hugo Awards for Best Series, in 2017 for the Vorkosigan Saga and in 2018 for the World of the Five Gods. The Science Fiction Writers of America named her its 36th SFWA Grand Master in 2019.

The bulk of Bujold&#x27;s works comprises three series: the Vorkosigan Saga, the World of the Five Gods, and the Sharing Knife series.

==Biography==
Bujold is the daughter of Robert Charles McMaster and attributes her early interest in science fiction, as well as certain aspects of the Vorkosigan Saga, to his influence. He was editor of the &quot;Nondestructive Testing Handbook&quot;.

Bujold writes that her experience growing up with a famous father is reflected in the same experience that her characters (Miles, Fiametta) have of growing up in the shadow of a &quot;Great Man&quot;. Having observed this tendency in both genders, she wonders why it is always called &quot;great man&#x27;s son syndrome&quot;, and never &quot;great man&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s syndrome.&quot; Her brother, an engineer like their father, helped provide technical details to support her writing of &quot;Falling Free&quot;.

She has stated that she was always a &quot;voracious reader&quot;. She started reading adult science fiction at the age of nine, picking up the habit from her father. She became a member of science fiction fandom, joined the Central Ohio Science Fiction Society, and co-published &quot;StarDate&quot;, a science fiction fanzine in which a story of hers appeared under the byline Lois McMaster. Her reading tastes later expanded and she stated she now reads &quot;history, mysteries, romance, travel, war, poetry, etc&quot;.

She attended Ohio State University from 1968 to 1972. While she was interested in writing, she didn&#x27;t pursue an English major, feeling it was too concerned with literary criticism instead of literary creation.

She married John Fredric Bujold in 1971, but they divorced in the early 1990s. The marriage produced two children, a daughter named Anne (born 1979) and a son named Paul (born 1981). Anne Bujold is currently (January 2020) Artist-In-Residence for the Metals Department at the Appalachian Center for Craft, a campus of Tennessee Tech; formerly she was a metal artist and welder in Portland, Oregon and vice president of the Northwest Blacksmith Association. Bujold currently lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

==Inspiration==
Bujold had been friends with Lillian Stewart Carl since high school, where they &quot;collaborated on extended story lines [but where] only a fragment of the total was written out.&quot;. At one point, she even co-produced a &quot;Star Trek&quot; zine called &quot;StarDate&quot; which she wrote for. In college, she wrote a Sherlock Holmes mystery as well. However, she stopped writing after that, being busy with marriage, family, and a career in hospital patient care.

It wasn&#x27;t until her thirties that she returned to writing. Bujold has credited her friend Lillian Stewart Carl&#x27;s first book sales with inspiring her to return to the field: &quot;it occurred to me that if she could do it, I could do it too.&quot; She originally planned to write as a hobby again, but discovered the amount of work required was too much for anything other than a profession, so she decided to turn professional. With support from Carl and Patricia Wrede, she was able to complete her first novel.

==Science fiction==
Lois Bujold wrote three books (&quot;Shards of Honor&quot;, &quot;The Warrior&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; and &quot;Ethan of Athos&quot;) before &quot;The Warrior&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; was finally accepted, after four rejections. &quot;The Warrior&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; was the first book purchased, though not the first Vorkosigan book written, nor would it be the first one to be published. On the strength of &quot;The Warrior&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, Baen Books agreed to a three-book deal to include the two bracketing novels. By 2010, Baen Books claimed to have sold two million copies of Bujold&#x27;s books.

Bujold is best known for her Vorkosigan Saga, a series of novels featuring Miles Vorkosigan, a physically impaired interstellar spy and mercenary admiral from the planet Barrayar, set approximately 1000 years in the future. The series also includes prequels starring Miles&#x27; parents, along with companion novels centered on secondary characters. Earlier titles are generally firmly in the space opera tradition with no shortage of battles, conspiracies, and wild twists, while in more recent volumes, Miles becomes more of a detective. In &quot;A Civil Campaign&quot;, Bujold explores yet another genre: a high-society romance with a plot that pays tribute to Regency romance novelist Georgette Heyer (as acknowledged in the dedication). It centers on a catastrophic dinner party, with misunderstandings and dialogue justifying the subtitle &quot;A Comedy of Biology and Manners&quot;.

The author has stated that the series structure is modeled after the Horatio Hornblower books, documenting the life of a single person. In themes and echoes, they also reflect Dorothy L. Sayers&#x27; mystery character Lord Peter Wimsey. Bujold has also said that part of the challenge of writing a series is that many readers will encounter the stories in &quot;utterly random order&quot;, so she must provide sufficient background in each of them without being excessively repetitious. Most recent printings of her Vorkosigan tales do include an appendix at the end of each book, summarizing the internal chronology of the series.

Bujold has discussed her own views on the optimum reading order for the Vorkosigan series in her blog.

==Fantasy==
Bujold also wanted to break into the fantasy genre, but met with early setbacks. Her first foray into fantasy was &quot;The Spirit Ring&quot;. She wrote the book &quot;on spec&quot;, shopped it around, and found low offers, sending her back to Baen Books, where Jim Baen bought it for a fair price in exchange for the promise of more Vorkosigan books. Bujold called this experience very educational; the book received little critical acclaim, and had only mediocre sales.

She would not attempt to break into the fantasy market again for almost another decade, with &quot;The Curse of Chalion&quot;. This book was also written on spec and offered up to a book auction. This time, she met with considerable critical and commercial success by tapping into a crossover market of fantasy and romance genre fans. The fantasy world of Chalion was first conceived as a result of a University of Minnesota course she was taking about medieval Spain in her spare time. She would eventually expand the setting into the &quot;World of the Five Gods&quot; series, including &quot;Paladin of Souls&quot;, &quot;The Hallowed Hunt&quot;, and the sixteen novels, novellas, and short stories of the Penric and Desdemona series.

The next fantasy world she created was the tetralogy set in the universe of &quot;The Sharing Knife&quot;, borrowing inspiration for its landscapes and for the dialect of the &quot;farmers&quot; from ones she grew up with in central Ohio. She writes that her first readers who helped proofread it said she got it exactly right and they could recognize Ohio features in the descriptions and dialects.

== Relation to fan fiction ==
Bujold has generally been supportive of fan fiction written about her characters and universe. Amy H. Sturgis, in her essay &quot;From Both Sides Now: Bujold and the Fan Fiction Phenomenon&quot;, notes that this is unusual for writers of Bujold&#x27;s generation, most of whom are opposed to fan fiction. Sturgis relates this to Bujold&#x27;s own production of &quot;Star Trek&quot; and Sherlock Holmes fan fiction early in her life, which Sturgis saw as an apprenticeship for her professional writing career.

Bujold herself ties her appreciation of fan fiction to her appreciation of &quot;active&quot; readers. To her, good readers are the &quot;unsung collaborators&quot; who make the story work, by actually constructing the world and characters in their heads. Books, to her, don&#x27;t actually exist until they enter the reader&#x27;s head and grow there. And sometimes, the characters and stories in a book grow so much that they escape the writer&#x27;s original confines and become fan fiction. To Bujold, great literature is never &quot;sterile&quot;, stopping with only what the original author wrote. She further believes that fan fiction gives authors a unique chance to see into the minds of those &quot;invisible collaborators&quot;, the readers.

Despite this, she no longer reads fan fiction about her own characters due to legal and financial concerns, &quot;fascinating as [she] finds it&quot;.

==Awards and nominations==

Bujold has also received the following accolades:

* John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer: Nominated (1987)
* &quot;The Mountains of Mourning&quot; (1990) won the Hugo and Nebula Awards for Best Novella.
* &quot;Komarr&quot; (1999) won the Minnesota Book Award.

<doc id="18735" wikidata="Q208130" url="?curid=18735" title="Lycopene">
<text>Lycopene is an organic compound classified as a tetraterpene and a carotene. Lycopene (from the Neo-Latin &quot;Lycopersicon&quot;, the name of a former tomato genus) is a bright red carotenoid hydrocarbon found in tomatoes and other red fruits and vegetables.

==Occurrence==
Aside from tomatoes or tomato products like ketchup, it is found in watermelons, grapefruits, red guavas, and baked beans. It has no vitamin A activity.

In plants, algae, and other photosynthetic organisms, lycopene is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of many carotenoids, including beta-carotene, which is responsible for yellow, orange, or red pigmentation, photosynthesis, and photoprotection. 

Like all carotenoids, lycopene is a tetraterpene. It is soluble in fat, but insoluble in water. Eleven conjugated double bonds give lycopene its deep red color.

Owing to the strong color, lycopene is used as a food coloring (registered as E160d) and is approved for use in the US, Australia and New Zealand (registered as 160d), and the European Union (E160d).

==Structure and physical properties==
Lycopene is a symmetrical tetraterpene because it consists entirely of carbon and hydrogen and is derived from eight isoprene subunits. Isolation procedures for lycopene were first reported in 1910, and the structure of the molecule was determined by 1931. In its natural, all-&quot;trans&quot; form, the molecule is long and somewhat flat, constrained by its system of 11 conjugated double bonds. The extended conjugation is responsible for its deep red color.

Plants and photosynthetic bacteria produce all-&quot;trans&quot; lycopene. When exposed to light or heat, lycopene can undergo isomerization to any of a number of &quot;cis&quot;-isomers, which have a less linear shape. Isomers distinct stabilities, with highest stability: 5-cis ≥ all-trans ≥ 9-cis ≥ 13-cis &gt; 15-cis &gt; 7-cis &gt; 11-cis: lowest. In human blood, various &quot;cis&quot;-isomers constitute more than 60% of the total lycopene concentration, but the biological effects of individual isomers have not been investigated.

Carotenoids like lycopene are found in photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes in plants, photosynthetic bacteria, fungi, and algae. They are responsible for the bright orange–red colors of fruits and vegetables, perform various functions in photosynthesis, and protect photosynthetic organisms from excessive light damage. Lycopene is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, and xanthophylls.

Dispersed lycopene molecules can be encapsulated into carbon nanotubes enhancing their optical properties. Efficient energy transfer occurs between the encapsulated dye and nanotube—light is absorbed by the dye and without significant loss is transferred to the nanotube. Encapsulation increases chemical and thermal stability of lycopene molecules; it also allows their isolation and individual characterization.

===Biosynthesis===
The unconditioned biosynthesis of lycopene in eukaryotic plants and in prokaryotic cyanobacteria is similar, as are the enzymes involved. Synthesis begins with mevalonic acid, which is converted into dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. This is then condensed with three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (an isomer of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate), to give the 20-carbon geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Two molecules of this product are then condensed in a tail-to-tail configuration to give the 40-carbon phytoene, the first committed step in carotenoid biosynthesis. Through several desaturation steps, phytoene is converted into lycopene. The two terminal isoprene groups of lycopene can be cyclized to produce beta-carotene, which can then be transformed into a wide variety of xanthophylls.

===Staining and removal===
Lycopene is the pigment in tomato sauces that turns plastic cookware orange. It is insoluble in plain water, but it can be dissolved in organic solvents and oils. Because of its non-polarity, lycopene in food preparations will stain any sufficiently porous material, including most plastics. To remove this staining, the plastics may be soaked in a solution containing a small amount of chlorine bleach.
The bleach oxidizes the lycopene, thus rendering it colourless.

==Diet==
===Consumption by humans===

Absorption of lycopene requires that it be combined with bile salts and fat to form micelles. Intestinal absorption of lycopene is enhanced by the presence of fat and by cooking. Lycopene dietary supplements (in oil) may be more efficiently absorbed than lycopene from food.

Lycopene is not an essential nutrient for humans, but is commonly found in the diet mainly from dishes prepared from tomatoes. The median and 99th percentile of dietary lycopene intake have been estimated to be 5.2 and 123 mg/d, respectively.

Fruits and vegetables that are high in lycopene include autumn olive, gac, tomatoes, watermelon, pink grapefruit, pink guava, papaya, seabuckthorn, wolfberry (goji, a berry relative of tomato), and rosehip. Ketchup is a common dietary source of lycopene. Although gac (&quot;Momordica cochinchinensis&quot; Spreng) has the highest content of lycopene of any known fruit or vegetable (multiple times more than tomatoes), tomatoes and tomato-based sauces, juices, and ketchup account for more than 85% of the dietary intake of lycopene for most people. The lycopene content of tomatoes depends on variety and increases as the fruit ripens.

Unlike other fruits and vegetables, where nutritional content such as vitamin C is diminished upon cooking, processing of tomatoes increases the concentration of bioavailable lycopene. Lycopene in tomato paste is up to four times more bioavailable than in fresh tomatoes. Processed tomato products such as pasteurized tomato juice, soup, sauce, and ketchup contain a higher concentration of bioavailable lycopene compared to raw tomatoes.

Cooking and crushing tomatoes (as in the canning process) and serving in oil-rich dishes (such as spaghetti sauce or pizza) greatly increases assimilation from the digestive tract into the bloodstream. Lycopene is fat-soluble, so the oil is said to help absorption. Gac has high lycopene content derived mainly from its seed coats. Cara Cara navel oranges, and other citrus fruit, such as pink grapefruits, also contain lycopene. Some foods that do not appear red also contain lycopene, e.g., baked beans. 
When lycopene is used as a food additive (E160d), it is usually obtained from tomatoes.

===Adverse effects===
Lycopene is non-toxic and commonly found in the diet, mainly from tomato products. There are cases of intolerance or allergic reaction to dietary lycopene, which may cause diarrhea, nausea, stomach pain or cramps, gas, and loss of appetite. Lycopene may increase the risk of bleeding when taken with anticoagulant drugs. Because lycopene may cause low blood pressure, interactions with drugs that affect blood pressure may occur. Lycopene may affect the immune system, the nervous system, sensitivity to sunlight, or drugs used for stomach ailments.

Lycopenemia is an orange discoloration of the skin that is observed with high intakes of lycopene. The discoloration is expected to fade after discontinuing excessive lycopene intake.

==Research and potential health effects==
A 2020 review of randomized controlled trials found conflicting evidence for lycopene having an effect on cardiovascular risk factors, whereas a 2017 review concluded that tomato products and lycopene supplementation reduced blood lipids and blood pressure. 

A 2015 review found that dietary lycopene was associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer, whereas a 2021 meta-analysis found that dietary lycopene did not affect prostate cancer risk. Other reviews concluded that research has been insufficient to establish whether lycopene consumption affects human health.

===Regulatory status in Europe and the United States===

In a review of literature on lycopene and its potential benefit in the diet, the European Food Safety Authority concluded there was insufficient evidence for lycopene having antioxidant effects in humans, particularly in skin, heart function, or vision protection from ultraviolet light.

Although lycopene from tomatoes has been tested in humans for cardiovascular diseases and prostate cancer, no effect on any disease was found. The US Food and Drug Administration, in rejecting manufacturers&#x27; requests in 2005 to allow &quot;qualified labeling&quot; for lycopene and the reduction of various cancer risks, provided a conclusion that remains in effect :
In a review of research through 2024, the US National Cancer Institute concluded that the FDA has not approved the use of lycopene as effective for treating any medical condition, including various types of cancer.

<text>Landau (), officially Landau in der Pfalz (, ), is an autonomous (&quot;kreisfrei&quot;) town surrounded by the Südliche Weinstraße (&quot;Southern Wine Route&quot;) district of southern Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is a university town (since 1990), a long-standing cultural centre, and a market and shopping town, surrounded by vineyards and wine-growing villages of the Palatinate wine region. Landau lies east of the Palatinate forest, on the German Wine Route.

It contains the districts (&quot;Ortsteile&quot;) of Arzheim, Dammheim, Godramstein, Mörlheim, Mörzheim, Nussdorf, Queichheim, and Wollmesheim.

==History and other settings==
Landau was first mentioned as a settlement in 1106. It was in the possession of the counts of Leiningen-Dagsburg-Landeck, whose arms, differenced by an escutcheon of the Imperial eagle, served as the arms of Landau until 1955. The town was granted a charter in 1274 by King Rudolf I of Germany, who declared the town a Free Imperial Town in 1291; nevertheless Prince-Bishop Emich of Speyer, a major landowner in the district, seized the town in 1324. The town did not regain its ancient rights until 1511 from Maximilian I. An Augustinian monastery was founded in 1276. It is also a company which is an enterprise which helps provide education as a temporary kind of college provided education for the past 28 years.

After the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, control of Landau was ceded to France, although with certain ill-defined reservations. Landau was later part of France from 1680 to 1815, during which it was one of the &quot;Décapole&quot;, the ten free cities of Alsace, and received its modern fortifications by Louis XIV&#x27;s military architect Vauban in 1688–99, making the little town (its 1789 population was approximately 5,000) one of Europe&#x27;s strongest citadels. In the War of the Spanish Succession it had four sieges. After the siege of 1702 lost by the French, an Imperial garrison was installed in Landau. In a subsequent siege from 13 October to 15 November 1703 the French regained the town, following their victory in the Battle of Speyerbach. A third siege, begun on 12 September 1704 by Louis, Margrave of Baden-Baden, ended on 23 November 1704 with a French defeat. During this siege King Joseph I arrived at Landau coming from Vienna in a newly developed convertible carriage. This carriage would become very popular and became named the landau in English, or Landauer in German. The French recaptured Landau once more in a final siege which lasted from 6 June to 20 August 1713 by Marshal General Villars.

Landau was part of Bas-Rhin department between 1789 and 1815. After Napoleon&#x27;s Hundred Days following his escape from Elba, Landau, which had remained French, was granted to the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1815 and became the capital of one of the thirteen &quot;Bezirksämter&quot; (counties) of the Bavarian Rheinkreis, later renamed Pfalz.

In 1840 famous political cartoonist Thomas Nast was born in Landau.

Following World War II, Landau was an important barracks town for the French occupation.

==Main sites==

Landau&#x27;s large main square (&quot;Rathausplatz&quot;) is dominated by the town hall (&quot;Rathaus&quot;) and the market hall (&quot;Altes Kaufhaus&quot;). In the 19th century, the former fortifications gave way to a ring road that encircles the old town centre, from which the old industrial buildings have been excluded. A convention hall, the &quot;Festhalle&quot;, was built in Art Nouveau style, 1905–07 on a rise overlooking the town park and facing the modernist &quot;Bundesamt&quot;, the regional government building.
The Protestant Collegiate Church (Stiftskirche) in Landau in der Pfalz is one of the oldest buildings in the town. With the construction of the church started in the 14th century, was completed in the mid-16th century.

The zoo is located close to the center of Landau alongside the historical fortifications. Animals are held in natural enclosures. The zoo contains numerous exotic species such as tigers and cheetahs, but also seals, penguins, kangaroos and flamingos and many more.

==Economy==
Wine-making continues to be an important industry of Landau.

==Culture==
The &quot;landau,&quot; a luxury open carriage with a pair of folding tops, was invented in the town during the War of the Spanish Succession.

A frequent Ashkenazi surname originates in this town. Probably its most famous bearer was Yechezkel Landau, an 18th-century talmudist and halakhist and the chief rabbi of Prague.

<doc id="18738" wikidata="Q191064" url="?curid=18738" title="Liv Ullmann">
<text>Liv Johanne Ullmann (born 16 December 1938) is a Norwegian actress. Recognised as one of the greatest European actresses of all time, Ullmann is known as the muse and frequent collaborator of filmmaker Ingmar Bergman. She acted in many of his films, including &quot;Persona&quot; (1966), &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; (1972), &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot; (1973), &quot;The Passion of Anna&quot; (1969), and &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot; (1978).

Ullmann won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama in 1972 for the film &quot;The Emigrants&quot; and has been nominated for another four. In 2000, she was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or for her second directorial feature film, &quot;Faithless&quot;. She has received two BAFTA Award nominations, and two nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress, for &quot;The Emigrants&quot; and Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Face to Face&quot;. On March 25, 2022, Ullmann was presented with an Honorary Academy Award in recognition of her &quot;bravery and emotional transparency that has gifted audiences with deeply affecting screen portrayals&quot;.

== Early life ==
Ullmann was born in Tokyo, Japan, the daughter of Norwegian parents, Erik Viggo Ullmann (1907–1945), an aircraft engineer who was working in Tokyo at the time, and Janna Erbe (&quot;née&quot; Lund; 1910–1996). 

Her grandfather was sent to the Dachau concentration camp during World War II for helping Jews escape from the town where he lived in Norway; he died in this camp. When she was two years old, the family moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where her father worked at the Norwegian air force base on Toronto Island (in Lake Ontario) during the Second World War. The family moved to New York, where four years later, her father died after a lengthy hospitalization from head injuries due to being struck by an airplane propeller; his death affecting her greatly. Her mother worked as a bookseller, while raising two daughters. They eventually moved to Norway, settling in Trondheim.

== Career ==

Ullmann began her acting career as a stage actress in Norway during the mid-1950s. She continued to act in theatre for most of her career and became noted for her portrayal of Nora in Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s play &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;.

She became better known once she started to work with Swedish movie director Ingmar Bergman. She later acted, with acclaim, in 10 of his movies, including &quot;Persona&quot; (1966), &quot;The Passion of Anna&quot; (1969), &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; (1972), and &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot; (1978), in the last of which her co-actress Ingrid Bergman resumed her own Swedish cinema career. She co-acted often with Swedish actor and fellow Bergman collaborator Erland Josephson, with whom she made the Swedish television drama &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot; (1973), which was also edited to feature-movie length and distributed theatrically. Ullmann acted with Laurence Olivier in &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977), directed by Richard Attenborough.

Nominated more than 40 times for awards, including various lifetime achievement awards, she won the best-actress prize three times from the National Society of Film Critics and three times from the National Board of Review, received three awards from the New York Film Critics Circle, and a Golden Globe. During 1971, Ullmann was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for the movie &quot;The Emigrants&quot;, and again during 1976 for the movie &quot;Face to Face&quot;.

Ullmann made her New York City stage debut in 1975, also in &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;. Appearances in &quot;Anna Christie&quot; and &quot;Ghosts&quot; followed, as well as the less-than-successful musical version of &quot;I Remember Mama&quot;. This show, composed by Richard Rodgers, experienced numerous revisions during a long preview period, then closed after 108 performances. She also featured in the widely deprecated musical movie remake of &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; during 1973. In 1977, when she appeared on Broadway at the Imperial Theatre in Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Anna Christie&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that she &quot;glowed with despair and hope, and was everything one could have wished her to have been&quot; in a performance &quot;not to be missed and never to be forgotten&quot;, with her &quot;grace and authority&quot; that was &quot;perhaps more than Garbo...born for Anna Christie:--Or more properly, Anna Christie was born for her.&quot;

In 1980, Brian De Palma, who directed &quot;Carrie&quot;, wanted Liv Ullmann to play the role of Kate Miller in the erotic crime thriller &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot; and offered it to her, but she declined because of the violence. The role subsequently went to Angie Dickinson. In 1982, Ingmar Bergman wanted Ullmann to play Emelie Ekdahl in his last feature film, &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot;, and wrote the role with this in mind. She declined it, feeling the role was too sad. She later stated in interviews that turning it down was one of the few things she really regretted.

During 1984, she was chairperson of the jury at the 34th Berlin International Film Festival, and during 2001 chaired the jury of the Cannes Film Festival. She introduced her daughter, Linn Ullmann, to the audience with the words: &quot;Here comes the woman whom Ingmar Bergman loves the most&quot;. Her daughter was there to receive the Prize of Honour on behalf of her father; she would return to serve the jury herself during 2011. She published two autobiographies, &quot;Changing&quot; (1977) and &quot;Choices&quot; (1984).

Ullmann&#x27;s first film as a director was &quot;Sofie&quot; (1992); her friend and former co-actor, Erland Josephson, starred on it. She later directed the Bergman-composed movie &quot;Faithless&quot; (2000). &quot;Faithless&quot; garnered nominations for both the Palme d&#x27;Or and Best Actress category at the Cannes Film Festival.

In 2003, Ullmann reprised her role for &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot; in &quot;Saraband&quot; (2003), Bergman&#x27;s final telemovie. Her previous screen role had been in the Swedish movie &quot;Zorn&quot; (1994).

In 2004, Ullmann revealed that she had received an offer in November 2003 to play in three episodes of the American television series, &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. She was amused by the offer, and said that it was one of the few programs she regularly watched, but she turned it down. Later that year, Steven Soderbergh wrote a role in the movie &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 12&quot; especially for her, but she also turned that down.

During 2006, Ullmann announced that she had been forced to end her longtime wish of making a film based on &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;. According to her statement, the Norwegian Film Fund was preventing writer Ketil Bjørnstad and her from pursuing the project. Australian actress Cate Blanchett and British actress Kate Winslet had been intended to have been cast in the main roles of the movie. She later directed Blanchett in the play &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, by Tennessee Williams, at the Sydney Theatre Company in Sydney, which was performed September through October 2009, and then continued from 29 October to 21 November 2009 at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC, where it won a Helen Hayes Award for Outstanding Non-resident Production, as well as actress and supporting performer for 2009. The play was also performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in Brooklyn, New York. Ullmann narrated the Canada–Norway co-produced animated short movie &quot;The Danish Poet&quot; (2006), which won the Academy Award for Animated Short Film at the 79th Academy Awards during 2007. 

In 2008, she was the head of the jury at the 30th Moscow International Film Festival.

During 2012, she attended the International Indian Film Academy Awards in Singapore, where she was honored for her Outstanding Contributions to International Cinema and she also showed her movie on her relationship with Ingmar Bergman. In 2013, Ullmann directed a film adaptation of &quot;Miss Julie&quot;. The film, released in September 2014, stars Jessica Chastain, Colin Farrell, and Samantha Morton. It was widely praised by the Norwegian press.

In 2018, Ullmann narrated &quot;Wars Don&#x27;t End&quot;, a documentary about the Lebensborn war children.

In March 2022, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced that Ullmann would receive the Academy Honorary Award. John Lithgow presented her with the statue at the Governors Awards, saying, &quot;For those few who claim that she never would&#x27;ve been called one of our greatest actors without Ingmar Bergman, I would answer, Bergman would probably never been called one of our greatest filmmakers without Liv Ullman&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Ullmann was married to Norwegian psychiatrist Hans Jakob Stang from 1960 until 1965. She met Swedish director Ingmar Bergman and the two had a relationship that lasted from 1965 to 1970. Writer Linn Ullmann (b. 1966) is their daughter. In 1985, Ullman married Boston real-estate developer Donald Saunders, and they remained together after their 1995 divorce.

=== Honors and causes ===
She is a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, and has traveled widely for the organization. She is also co-founder and honorary chair of the Women&#x27;s Refugee Commission.

In 2005, King Harald V of Norway made Ullmann a Commander with Star of the Order of St. Olav. She received an honorary degree, a doctorate of philosophy, from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in 2006.

<doc id="18739" wikidata="Q53662" url="?curid=18739" title="Laika">
<text>Laika ( ; , ; – 3 November 1957) was a Soviet space dog who was one of the first animals in space and the first to orbit the Earth. A stray mongrel from the streets of Moscow, she flew aboard the Sputnik 2 spacecraft, launched into low orbit on 3 November 1957. As the technology to re-enter the atmosphere had not yet been developed, Laika&#x27;s survival was never expected. She died of hyperthermia hours into the flight, on the craft&#x27;s fourth orbit.

Little was known about the effects of spaceflight on living creatures at the time of Laika&#x27;s mission, and animal flights were viewed by engineers as a necessary precursor to human missions. The experiment, which monitored Laika&#x27;s vital signs, aimed to prove that a living organism could survive being launched into orbit and continue to function under conditions of weakened gravity and increased radiation, providing scientists with some of the first data on the biological effects of spaceflight.

Laika&#x27;s death was possibly caused by a failure of the central R7 sustainer to separate from the payload. The true cause and time of her death were not made public until 2002; instead, it was widely reported that she died when her oxygen ran out on day six or, as the Soviet government initially claimed, she was euthanised prior to oxygen depletion. In 2008, a small monument to Laika depicting her standing atop a rocket was unveiled near the military research facility in Moscow that prepared her flight. She also appears on the &quot;Monument to the Conquerors of Space&quot; in Moscow.

==Sputnik 2==
After the success of Sputnik 1 in October 1957, Nikita Khrushchev, leader of the Soviet Union, wanted a spacecraft launched on 7 November 1957 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. Khrushchev specifically wanted to deliver a &quot;space spectacular&quot;, a mission that would repeat the triumph of Sputnik1, stunning the world with Soviet prowess. 

While Construction had already started on Sputnik 3, a more sophisticated satellite, it would not be ready until December. To meet the November deadline, a new simple satellite would need to be built. Sergei Korolev proposed that a dog be placed in the satellite, an idea which was quickly adopted by planners. Soviet rocket engineers had long intended a canine orbit before attempting human spaceflight; since 1951, they had lofted 12 dogs into sub-orbital space on ballistic flights, working gradually toward an orbital mission set for some time in 1958. To satisfy Khrushchev&#x27;s demands, they expedited the orbital canine flight for the November launch.

According to Russian sources, the official decision to launch Sputnik2 was made on 10 or 12 October, leaving less than four weeks to design and build the spacecraft. Sputnik2, therefore, was something of a rushed job, with most elements of the spacecraft being constructed from rough sketches. Aside from the primary mission of sending a living passenger into space, Sputnik2 also contained instrumentation for measuring solar irradiance and cosmic rays.

The craft was equipped with a life-support system consisting of an oxygen generator and devices to avoid oxygen poisoning and to absorb carbon dioxide. A fan, designed to activate whenever the cabin temperature exceeded , was added to keep the dog cool. Enough food (in a gelatinous form) was provided for a seven-day flight, and the dog was fitted with a bag to collect waste. A harness was designed to be fitted to the dog, and there were chains to restrict her movements to standing, sitting, or lying down; there was no room to turn around in the cabin. An electrocardiogram monitored heart rate and further instrumentation tracked respiration rate, maximum arterial pressure, and the dog&#x27;s movements.

==Training==
Laika was found as a stray wandering the streets of Moscow. Soviet scientists chose to use Moscow strays since they assumed that such animals had already learned to endure conditions of extreme cold and hunger. She was a mongrel female, approximately three years old. Another account reported that she weighed about . Soviet personnel gave her several names and nicknames, among them Kudryavka (Russian for &quot;Little Curly&quot;), Zhuchka (&quot;Little Bug&quot;), and Limonchik (&quot;Little Lemon&quot;). Laika, the Russian name for several breeds of dogs similar to the husky, was the name popularised around the world. Its literal translation would be &quot;Barker&quot;, from the Russian verb &quot;layat&quot; (&quot;лаять&quot;), &quot;to bark&quot;. According to some accounts, the technicians actually renamed her from Kudryavka to Laika due to her loud barking. The American press dubbed her Muttnik (&quot;mutt&quot; + suffix &quot;-nik&quot;) as a pun on Sputnik, or referred to her as &quot;Curly&quot;. Her true pedigree is unknown, although it is generally accepted that she was part husky or other Nordic breed, and possibly part terrier. NASA refers to Laika as a &quot;part-Samoyed terrier&quot;. A Russian magazine described her temperament as phlegmatic, saying that she did not quarrel with other dogs.

The Soviet Union and United States had previously sent animals only on sub-orbital flights. Three dogs were trained for the Sputnik2 flight: Albina, Mushka, and Laika. Soviet space-life scientists Vladimir Yazdovsky and Oleg Gazenko trained the dogs.

To adapt the dogs to the confines of the tiny cabin of Sputnik2, they were kept in progressively smaller cages for periods of up to twenty days. The extensive close confinement caused them to stop urinating or defecating, made them restless, and caused their general condition to deteriorate. Laxatives did not improve their condition, and the researchers found that only long periods of training proved effective. The dogs were placed in centrifuges that simulated the acceleration of a rocket launch and were placed in machines that simulated the noises of the spacecraft. This caused their pulses to double and their blood pressure to increase by . The dogs were trained to eat a special high-nutrition gel that would be their food in space.

Ten days before the launch, Vladimir Yazdovsky chose Laika to be the primary flight dog. Before the launch, Yazdovsky took Laika home to play with his children. In a book chronicling the story of Soviet space medicine, he wrote, &quot;Laika was quiet and charming... I wanted to do something nice for her: She had so little time left to live.&quot;

==Preflight preparations==
Yazdovsky made the final selection of dogs and their designated roles. Laika was to be the &quot;flight dog&quot;a sacrifice to science on a one-way mission to space. Albina, who had already flown twice on a high-altitude test rocket, was to act as Laika&#x27;s backup. The third dog, Mushka, was a &quot;control dog&quot;she was to stay on the ground and be used to test instrumentation and life support.

Before leaving for the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Yazdovsky and Gazenko conducted surgery on the dogs, routing the cables from the transmitters to the sensors that would measure breathing, pulse, and blood pressure.

Because the existing airstrip at Turatam near the cosmodrome was small, the dogs and crew had to be first flown aboard a Tu104 plane to Tashkent. From there, a smaller and lighter Il14 plane took them to Turatam. Training of dogs continued upon arrival; one after another they were placed in the capsules to get familiar with the feeding system.

According to a NASA document, Laika was placed in the capsule of the satellite on 31 October 1957three days before the start of the mission. At that time of year, the temperatures at the launch site were extremely low, and a hose connected to a heater was used to keep her container warm. Two assistants were assigned to keep a constant watch on Laika before launch. Just prior to liftoff on 3 November 1957, from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Laika&#x27;s fur was sponged in a weak ethanol solution and carefully groomed, while iodine was painted onto the areas where sensors would be placed to monitor her bodily functions.

One of the technicians preparing the capsule before final lift-off stated: &quot;After placing Laika in the container and before closing the hatch, we kissed her nose and wished her bon voyage, knowing that she would not survive the flight.&quot;

==Voyage==
Accounts of the time of launch vary from source to source, given as 05:30:42 Moscow Time or 07:22 Moscow Time.

At peak acceleration, Laika&#x27;s respiration increased to between three and four times the pre-launch rate. The sensors showed her heart rate was 103 beats/min before launch and increased to 240 beats/min during the early acceleration. After reaching orbit, Sputnik2&#x27;s nose cone was jettisoned successfully; however, the &quot;Block A&quot; core did not separate as planned, preventing the thermal control system from operating correctly. Some of the thermal insulation tore loose, raising the cabin temperature to . After three hours of weightlessness, Laika&#x27;s pulse rate had settled back to 102 beats/min, three times longer than it had taken during earlier ground tests, an indication of the stress she was under. The early telemetry indicated that Laika was agitated but eating her food. After approximately five to seven hours into the flight, no further signs of life were received from the spacecraft.

The Soviet scientists had planned to euthanise Laika with a serving of poisoned food. For many years, the Soviet Union gave conflicting statements that she had died either from asphyxia, when the batteries failed, or that she had been euthanised. Many rumours circulated about the exact manner of her death. In 1999, several Russian sources reported that Laika had died when the cabin overheated on the fourth day. In October 2002, Dimitri Malashenkov, one of the scientists behind the Sputnik2 mission, revealed that Laika had died by the fourth circuit of flight from overheating. According to a paper he presented to the World Space Congress in Houston, Texas, &quot;It turned out that it was practically impossible to create a reliable temperature control system in such limited time constraints.&quot;

Over five months later, after 2,570 orbits, Sputnik2 (including Laika&#x27;s remains) disintegrated during re-entry on 14 April 1958.

==Ethics of animal testing==
Due to the overshadowing issue of the Soviet–U.S. Space Race, the ethical issues raised by this experiment went largely unaddressed for some time. As newspaper clippings from 1957 show, the press was initially focused on reporting the political perspective, while Laika&#x27;s health and retrievalor lack thereofonly became an issue later.

Sputnik 2 was not designed to be retrievable, and it had always been accepted that Laika would die. The mission sparked a debate across the globe on the mistreatment of animals and animal testing in general to advance science. In the United Kingdom, the National Canine Defence League called on all dog owners to observe a minute&#x27;s silence on each day Laika remained in space, while the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) received protests even before Radio Moscow had finished announcing the launch. Animal rights groups at the time called on members of the public to protest at Soviet embassies. Others demonstrated outside the United Nations in New York. Laboratory researchers in the US offered some support for the Soviets, at least before the news of Laika&#x27;s death.

In the Soviet Union, there was less controversy. Neither the media, books in the following years, nor the public openly questioned the decision to send a dog into space. In 1998, after the collapse of the Soviet regime, Oleg Gazenko, one of the scientists responsible for sending Laika into space, expressed regret for allowing her to die:
In other Warsaw Pact countries, open criticism of the Soviet space program was difficult because of political censorship, but there were notable cases of criticism in Polish scientific circles. A Polish scientific periodical, &quot;Kto, Kiedy, Dlaczego&quot; (&quot;Who, When, Why&quot;), published in 1958, discussed the mission of Sputnik2. In the periodical&#x27;s section dedicated to astronautics, Krzysztof Boruń described the Sputnik2 mission as &quot;regrettable&quot; and criticised not bringing Laika back to Earth alive as &quot;undoubtedly a great loss for science&quot;.

==Legacy==
Laika is memorialised in the form of a statue and plaque at Star City, the Russian Cosmonaut training facility. Created in 1997, Laika is positioned behind the cosmonauts with her ears erect. The Monument to the Conquerors of Space in Moscow, constructed in 1964, also includes Laika. On 11 April 2008 at the military research facility where staff had been responsible for readying Laika for the flight, officials unveiled a monument of her poised on top of a space rocket. Stamps and envelopes picturing Laika were produced, as well as branded cigarettes and matches.

Future space missions carrying dogs would be designed to be recovered; the first successful recovery followed the flight of Korabl-Sputnik 2, wherein the dogs Belka and Strelka, alongside dozens of other organisms, safely returned to Earth. Nonetheless, four other dogs later died in Soviet space missions: Bars and Lisichka were killed when their R7 rocket exploded shortly after launch on 28 July 1960, while Pchyolka and Mushka died when Korabl-Sputnik 3 suffered an emergency and had to be detonated.

Norwegian singer Emmy released a song in 2025 titled &quot;Laika Party&quot; to compete in the Irish &quot;Eurosong&quot; selection for the 2025 Eurovision Song Contest. The song tells a story about the singer wishing that Laika had never died and was living happily in space. Emmy won the selection and went on to represent Ireland at the contest that year.

<text>Master of Puppets is the third studio album by the American heavy metal band Metallica, released on March 3, 1986, by Elektra Records. Recorded in Copenhagen, Denmark, at Sweet Silence Studios with producer Flemming Rasmussen, it is the band&#x27;s final album to feature bassist Cliff Burton. While touring in support of &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, he died on September 27, 1986, after the band&#x27;s tour bus was involved in an accident in Dörarp, Sweden.

The album&#x27;s artwork, designed by Metallica and Peter Mensch and painted by Don Brautigam, depicts a cemetery field of white crosses tethered to strings, manipulated by a pair of hands in a clouded, blood-red sky, with a fiery orange glow on the horizon. The album is the band’s most recent to date to feature a runtime of under an hour. Instead of releasing a single or video in advance of the album&#x27;s release, Metallica embarked on a five-month American tour in support of Ozzy Osbourne. The European leg was canceled after Burton&#x27;s death in September 1986, and the band returned home to audition a new bassist.

&quot;Master of Puppets&quot; peaked at number 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its music and political lyrics. It is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential metal albums of all time, and is credited with consolidating the American thrash metal scene. It was certified six times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2003 for shipping six million copies in the United States, and was later certified six times platinum by Music Canada and platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). In 2015, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; became the first metal recording to be selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Background and recording==
Metallica&#x27;s 1983 debut &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; laid the foundation for thrash metal with its aggressive musicianship and vitriolic lyrics. The album revitalized the American underground scene, and inspired similar records by contemporaries. The band&#x27;s second album &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; extended the limits of the genre with its more sophisticated songwriting and improved production. The album caught the attention of Elektra Records representative Michael Alago, who signed the group to an eight-album deal in the fall of 1984. Elektra reissued &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; on November 19, and the band began touring larger venues and festivals throughout 1985. After parting with manager Jon Zazula, Metallica hired Q Prime executives Cliff Burnstein and Peter Mensch. During the summer, the band played the Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington, alongside Bon Jovi and Ratt to an audience of 70,000.

Metallica was motivated to make an album that would impress critics and fans, and began writing new material in mid-1985. Lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich were the main songwriters on the album, already titled &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;. The two developed ideas at a garage in El Cerrito, California, before inviting bassist Cliff Burton and guitarist Kirk Hammett for rehearsals. Hetfield and Ulrich described the songwriting process as starting with &quot;guitar riffs, assembled and reassembled until they start to sound like a song&quot;. After that, the band came up with a song title and topic, and Hetfield wrote lyrics to match the title. &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is Metallica&#x27;s first album not to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine. Mustaine claimed he had co-written &quot;Leper Messiah&quot;, based on an old song called &quot;The Hills Ran Red&quot;. The band denied this, but stated that one section incorporated Mustaine&#x27;s ideas.

The band was not satisfied with the acoustics of the American studios they considered, and decided to record in Ulrich&#x27;s native Denmark. Ulrich took drum lessons, and Hammett worked with Joe Satriani to learn how to record more efficiently. Ulrich was in talks with Rush&#x27;s bassist and vocalist Geddy Lee to produce the album, but the collaboration never materialized because of uncoordinated schedules. Metallica recorded the album with producer Flemming Rasmussen at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark, from September 1 to December 27, 1985. The writing of all the songs except &quot;Orion&quot; and &quot;The Thing That Should Not Be&quot; was completed before the band&#x27;s arrival in Copenhagen. Rasmussen stated that the band brought well-prepared demos of the songs, and only slight changes were made to the compositions in the studio. The recording took longer than the previous album because Metallica had developed a sense of perfectionism and had higher ambitions.

Metallica eschewed the slick production and synthesizers of contemporary hard rock and glam metal albums. With a reputation for drinking, the band stayed sober on recording days. Hammett recalled that the group was &quot;just making another album&quot; at the time and &quot;had no idea that the record would have such a range of influence that it went on to have&quot;. He also said that the group was &quot;definitely peaking&quot; at the time and that the album had &quot;the sound of a band really gelling, really learning how to work well together.&quot;

Rasmussen and Metallica did not manage to complete the mixtapes as planned. Instead, the multitrack recordings were sent in January 1986 to Michael Wagener, who finished the album&#x27;s mixing. The cover was designed by Metallica and Peter Mensch and painted by Don Brautigam. It depicts a cemetery field of white crosses tethered to strings, manipulated by a pair of hands in a blood-red sky. Ulrich explained that the artwork summarized the lyrical content of the album—people being subconsciously manipulated. The original artwork was sold at Rockefeller Plaza, New York City for $28,000 in 2008. The band mocked the warning stickers promoted by the PMRC with a facetious Parental Advisory label on the cover: &quot;The only track you probably won&#x27;t want to play is &#x27;Damage, Inc.&#x27; due to multiple use of the infamous &#x27;F&#x27; word. Otherwise, there aren&#x27;t any &#x27;shits&#x27;, &#x27;fucks&#x27;, &#x27;pisses&#x27;, &#x27;cunts&#x27;, &#x27;motherfuckers&#x27;, or &#x27;cocksuckers&#x27; anywhere on this record&quot;.

The album was recorded with the following equipment: Hammett&#x27;s guitars were a 1974 Gibson Flying V, a Jackson Randy Rhoads, and a Fernandes Stratocaster copy; Hetfield used a Jackson King V played through a Mesa Boogie Mark IIC+ amplifier modified as a pre-amp; Burton played an Aria Pro II SB1000 through Mesa Boogie amplifier heads and cabinets; Ulrich played Tama drum equipment, and borrowed a rare Ludwig Black Beauty snare drum from Def Leppard drummer Rick Allen.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Master of Puppets&quot; features dynamic music and thick arrangements. Metallica delivered a more refined approach and performance compared to the previous two albums, with multilayered songs and technical dexterity. This album and its predecessor &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; follow a similar track sequencing: both open with an up-tempo song with an acoustic intro, followed by a lengthy title track, and a fourth track with ballad qualities. Although both albums are similarly structured, the musicianship on &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is more powerful and epic in scope, with tight rhythms and delicate guitar solos. According to music writer Joel McIver, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; introduced a new level of heaviness and complexity in thrash metal, displaying atmospheric and precisely executed songs. Hetfield&#x27;s vocals had matured from the hoarse shouting of the first two albums to a deeper, in-control, yet aggressive style.

The songs explore themes such as control and the abuse of power. The lyrics describe the consequences of alienation, oppression, and feelings of powerlessness. Author Ryan Moore thought the lyrics depicted &quot;ominous yet unnamed forces of power wielding total control over helpless human subjects&quot;. The lyrics were considered perceptive and harrowing, and were praised for being honest and socially conscious by writer Brock Helander. Referring to the epic proportions of the songs, BBC Music&#x27;s Eamonn Stack stated that &quot;at this stage in their careers Metallica weren&#x27;t even doing songs, they were telling stories&quot;. The compositions and arrangements benefited from bassist Cliff Burton&#x27;s classical training and understanding of harmony.

&quot;Battery&quot; refers to angry violence, as in the term &quot;assault and battery&quot;. Some critics contended that the title actually refers to an artillery battery, and interpreted it as &quot;Hetfield of a war tactic as the aggressor&quot; personifying destruction. The song begins with bass-heavy acoustic guitars that build upon multitracked layers until they are joined by a sonic wall of distorted electric guitars. It then breaks into fast, aggressive riffing, featuring off-beat rhythms and heavily distorted minor dyads where root-fifth power chords might be expected. Hetfield improvised the riff while relaxing in London.

&quot;Master of Puppets&quot; consists of several riffs with odd meters and a cleanly picked middle section with melodic solo. The song shares a similar structure with &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot; from the band&#x27;s first album: two verse-chorus sets lead to a lengthy interlude to another verse-chorus set. The opening and pre-verse sections feature fast downpicked chromatic riffing at around 212 beats per minute in mostly time. Every fourth bar of each verse and the outro is cut short by more than a beat; the time signature of these bars is often idealistically analyzed as being , but it is performed with a delay after the third beat, making it closer to (). A lengthy interlude follows the second chorus, beginning with a clean, arpeggiated section over which Hetfield contributes a melodic solo; the riffing becomes distorted and progressively more heavy and Hammett provides a more virtuosic solo before the song eventually returns to the main verse. A riff from &quot;Andy Warhol&quot; by David Bowie (at 0:48) is quoted in the track (at 6:19). It is a homage made by Burton and Hammett to whom Bowie was a huge influence. The song closes with a fade-out of sinister laughter. The lyrical theme is cocaine addiction.

&quot;The Thing That Should Not Be&quot; was inspired by the Cthulhu Mythos created by famed horror writer H.P. Lovecraft, with notable direct references to &quot;The Shadow over Innsmouth&quot; and to Cthulhu himself, who is the subject matter of the song&#x27;s chorus. It is considered the heaviest track on the album, with the main riff emulating a beast dragging itself into the sea. The Black Sabbath-influenced guitars are down-tuned, creating slow and moody ambience.

&quot;Welcome Home (Sanitarium)&quot; was based on Ken Kesey&#x27;s novel &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; and conveys the thoughts of a patient unjustly caged in a mental institution. The song opens with a section of clean single strings and harmonics. The clean, arpeggiated main riff is played in alternating and time signatures. The song is structured with alternating somber clean guitars in the verses, and distorted heavy riffing in the choruses, unfolding into an aggressive finale. This structure follows a pattern of power ballads Metallica set with &quot;Fade to Black&quot; on &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; and would follow with &quot;One&quot; on &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; and later &quot;The Day That Never Comes&quot; on &quot;Death Magnetic&quot;.

&quot;Disposable Heroes&quot; is an anti-war song about a young soldier whose fate is controlled by his superiors. With sections performed at 220 beats per minute, it is one of the most intense tracks on the record. The guitar passage at the end of each verse was Hammett&#x27;s imitation of the sort of music he found in war films.

The syncopated riffing of &quot;Leper Messiah&quot; challenges the hypocrisy of the televangelism that emerged in the 1980s. The song describes how people are willingly turned into blind religious followers who mindlessly do whatever they are told. The 136 beats per minute mid-tempo riffing of the verses culminates in a descending chromatic riff in the chorus; it increases to a galloping 184 beats per minute for the middle section that climaxes in a distorted scream of &quot;Lie!&quot;. The title derives from the lyrics to the David Bowie song &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;.

&quot;Orion&quot; is a multipart instrumental highlighting Burton&#x27;s bass playing. It opens with a fade-in bass section, heavily processed to resemble an orchestra. It continues with mid-tempo riffing, followed by a bass riff at half-tempo. The tempo accelerates during the latter part, and ends with music fading out. Burton arranged the middle section, which features its moody bass line and multipart guitar harmonies.

&quot;Damage, Inc.&quot; rants about senseless violence and reprisal at an unspecified target. It starts with a series of reversed bass chords based on the chorale prelude of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Come, Sweet Death&quot;. The song then jumps into a rapid rhythm with a pedal-point riff in E that Hammett says was influenced by Deep Purple.

==Reception==
&quot;Master of Puppets&quot; was hailed as a masterpiece by critics outside of the thrash metal audience and cited by some as the genre&#x27;s greatest album. In a contemporary review, Tim Holmes of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; asserted that the band had redefined heavy metal with the technical skill and subtlety showcased on the album, which he described as &quot;the sound of global paranoia&quot;. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; wrote that &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; &quot;finally put Metallica into the big leagues where they belong&quot;. Editor Tom King said Metallica was at an &quot;incredible song-writing peak&quot; during the recording sessions, partially because Burton contributed to the songwriting. By contrast, &quot;Spin&quot;″s Judge I-Rankin was disappointed with the album and said, although the production is exceptional and Metallica&#x27;s experimentation is commendable, it eschews the less &quot;intellectual&quot; approach of &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; for a MDC-inspired direction that is inconsistent.

In a retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey viewed &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; as Metallica&#x27;s best album and remarked that, although it was not as unexpected as &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;, it is a more musically and thematically consistent album. Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said the songs were the band&#x27;s most intense at that point, and veer toward &quot;the progressive tendency of Rush.&quot; Adrien Begrand of &quot;PopMatters&quot; praised the production as &quot;a metal version of Phil Spector&#x27;s Wall of Sound&quot; and believed none of Metallica&#x27;s subsequent albums could match its passionate and intense musical quality. BBC Music&#x27;s Eamonn Stack called the album &quot;hard, fast, rock with substance&quot; and likened the songs to stories of &quot;biblical proportions&quot;. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff compared the album to &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; and found &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; not a remake, though similar in &quot;awesome power and effect&quot;. Robert Christgau was more critical. Writing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: The &#x27;80s&quot; (1990), he said the band&#x27;s energy and political motivations are respectable, but the music evokes clichéd images of &quot;revolutionary heroes&quot; who are &quot;male chauvinists too inexperienced to know better&quot;.

Released on March 3, 1986, the album had a 72-week run on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album charts and earned the band its first gold certification. The album debuted on March 29 at number 128 and peaked at number 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that 300,000 copies were sold in its first three weeks. More than 500,000 copies were sold in its first year, even with virtually no radio airplay and no music videos. In 2003, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; was certified 6× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with six million copies shipped in the United States. Between the beginning of the Nielsen SoundScan era in 1991 and 2023, 7,980,000 copies were sold. The album was less successful on an international level, despite entering the top 5 on the Finnish and the top 40 on the German and Swiss album charts in its inaugural year. In 2004, it peaked within the top 15 in Sweden. In 2008, the album reached the top 40 on the Australian and Norwegian album charts. It received 6× platinum certification from Music Canada and a gold certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments of 600,000 and 100,000 copies, respectively.

Bassist Robert Trujillo cited &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; as his favorite album, &quot;I feel &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; has a lot of everything. It&#x27;s got instrumentals, it&#x27;s got great segues, great riffs. It&#x27;s got one of my favorite songs ever by Metallica, and that song is &quot;Disposable Heroes&quot;. So any time I can hear that particular song, count me in. &quot;Battery&quot; is an amazing song. So it&#x27;s just got everything that I love about Metallica.&quot;

==Accolades and legacy==
&quot;Master of Puppets&quot; has appeared in several publications&#x27; best album lists. It was ranked number 167 on the list of Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, and upgrading to number 97 in a 2020 revised list. The magazine would also later rank it second on its 2017 list of &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;, behind Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Paranoid&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; included the album in its list of the 100 best albums of all time. According to the magazine&#x27;s Josh Tyrangiel, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; reinforced the velocity of playing in heavy metal and diminished some of its clichés. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; placed the album at number 90 on its list of the best albums of the 1980s, saying &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is Metallica&#x27;s best and most sincere recording. The album is featured in Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. IGN named &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; the best heavy metal album of all time. The website stated it was Metallica&#x27;s best because it &quot;built upon and perfected everything they had experimented with prior&quot; and that &quot;all the pieces come together in glorious cohesion&quot;. Music journalist Martin Popoff also ranked it the best heavy metal album. &quot;Rock Hard&quot; ranked the album as the second greatest rock and metal album of all time, behind AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Back in Black&quot;. The album was voted the fourth greatest guitar album of all time by &quot;Guitar World&quot; in 2006, and the title track ranked number 61 on the magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest guitar solos. &quot;Total Guitar&quot; ranked the main riff of the title track at number 7 among the top 20 guitar riffs. The April 2006 edition of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; was dedicated to the album and gave away to readers the cover album &quot;Master of Puppets: Remastered&quot;.

&quot;Master of Puppets&quot; became thrash metal&#x27;s first platinum album and by the early 1990s thrash metal successfully challenged and redefined the mainstream of heavy metal. Metallica and a few other bands headlined arena concerts and appeared regularly on MTV, although radio play remained incommensurate with their popularity. &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is widely accepted as the genre&#x27;s most accomplished album, and paved the way for subsequent development. The album, in the words of writer Christopher Knowles, &quot;ripped Metallica away from the underground and put them atop the metal mountain&quot;. David Hayter from &quot;Guitar Planet&quot; recognized the album as one of the most influential records ever made and a benchmark by which other metal albums should be judged. MTV&#x27;s Kyle Anderson had similar thoughts, saying that 25 years after its release the album remained a &quot;stone cold classic&quot;. Carlos Ramirez from Noisecreep believes that &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; stands as one of the most representative albums of its genre.

The year 1986 is seen as a pinnacle year for thrash metal in which the genre broke out of the underground due to albums such as Megadeth&#x27;s &quot;Peace Sells... but Who&#x27;s Buying?&quot; and Slayer&#x27;s &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;. Anthrax released &quot;Among the Living&quot; in 1987, and by the end of the year these bands, alongside Metallica, were being called the &quot;Big Four&quot; of thrash metal. &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; frequently tops critic and fan polls of favorite thrash metal albums. Histories of the band tend to position &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, and &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; as a trilogy over the course of which the band&#x27;s music progressively matured and became more sophisticated. In 2015, the album was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry.

&quot;Kerrang!&quot; released a tribute album titled &quot;Master of Puppets: Remastered&quot; with the April 8, 2006, edition of the magazine to celebrate the 20th anniversary of &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;. The album featured cover versions of Metallica songs by Machine Head, Bullet for My Valentine, Chimaira, Mastodon, Mendeed, and Trivium—all of which are influenced by Metallica.

The title track was also featured in the fourth season finale of the Netflix series &quot;Stranger Things&quot;, as the character Eddie Munson plays the song in the Upside Down dimension to draw the dimension&#x27;s monsters away from his friends. Kelly McClure of &quot;Salon&quot; compares the song&#x27;s newfound popularity to Kate Bush&#x27;s &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;, another song featured in the show&#x27;s fourth season. The song&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Stranger Things&quot; saw the song resurging on Spotify&#x27;s charts, behind &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;, and the band stated on social media that &quot;It’s an incredible honor to be such a big part of Eddie’s journey and to once again be keeping company with all of the amazing artists featured in the show.&quot;

==Tour and Burton&#x27;s death==
Metallica opted for extensive touring instead of releasing a single or video to promote the album. The Damage, Inc. Tour began in March 1986, and the band spent March to August touring as the opening act for Ozzy Osbourne in the United States, the first tour Metallica played to arena-sized audiences. During sound checks, the group played riffs from Osbourne&#x27;s previous band Black Sabbath, which Osbourne perceived as mockery. Ulrich, however, stated that Metallica was honored to play with Osbourne, who treated the band well on the tour. Metallica was noted by the media for their excessive drinking habit while touring and earned the nickname &quot;Alcoholica&quot;. The band members occasionally even wore satirical T-shirts reading &quot;Alcoholica/Drank &#x27;Em All&quot;.

The band usually played a 45-minute set often followed by an encore. According to Ulrich, the audiences in bigger cities were already familiar with Metallica&#x27;s music, unlike in the smaller towns they&#x27;ve visited. &quot;In the B-markets, people really don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re all about. But after 45 or 50 minutes we can tell we&#x27;ve won them over. And fans who come to hear Ozzy go home liking Metallica.&quot; Metallica won over Osbourne&#x27;s fans and slowly began to establish a mainstream following. Hetfield broke his wrist in a mid-tour skateboarding accident, and guitar technician John Marshall played rhythm guitar on several dates.

The European leg of the tour commenced in September, with Anthrax as the supporting band. The morning after a performance on September 26 in Stockholm, the band&#x27;s bus rolled off the road, and Burton was thrown through a window and killed instantly. The driver claimed he hit a patch of black ice, but others believed he was either drunk or fell asleep at the wheel. The driver was charged with manslaughter but was not convicted. The band returned to San Francisco and hired Flotsam and Jetsam bassist Jason Newsted to replace Burton. Many of the songs that appeared on the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;...And Justice for All&quot;, were composed during Burton&#x27;s career with the band.

===Later live performances===
All of the songs have been performed live, and some became permanent setlist features. Four tracks were featured on the nine-song set list for the album&#x27;s promotional tour: &quot;Battery&quot; as opener, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, &quot;Welcome Home (Sanitarium)&quot;, and &quot;Damage, Inc.&quot; The title track, which was issued as a single in France, became a live staple and the most-played Metallica song. &quot;Loudwire&quot;″s Chad Childers characterized the band&#x27;s performance as &quot;furious&quot; and the song as the set&#x27;s highlight. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the live performance as &quot;a classic in all its eight-minute glory&quot;. While filming its 3D movie &quot;&quot; (2013) at Rogers Arena in Vancouver, crosses were rising from the stage during the song, reminiscent of the album&#x27;s cover art.

&quot;Welcome Home (Sanitarium)&quot; is the second-most performed song from the album. The live performance is often accompanied by lasers, pyrotechnical effects and film screens. &quot;Battery&quot; is usually played at the beginning of the setlist or during the encore, accompanied by lasers and flame plumes. &quot;Disposable Heroes&quot; is featured in the video album &quot;Orgullo, Pasión, y Gloria: Tres Noches en la Ciudad de México&quot; (2009) filmed in Mexico City, in which the song was played on the second of three nights at the Foro Sol. &quot;Orion&quot; is the least-performed song from the album. Its first live performance was during the Escape from the Studio &#x27;06 tour, when the band performed the album in its entirety, honoring the 20th anniversary of its release. The band performed the album in the middle of the set. &quot;Battery&quot;, &quot;Welcome Home (Sanitarium)&quot;, &quot;Damage, Inc.&quot; and the full-length &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; were revived for the band&#x27;s concerts in 1997 and 1998, after having been retired for a number of years.

<doc id="18758" wikidata="Q190989" url="?curid=18758" title="Ride the Lightning">
<text>Ride the Lightning is the second studio album by the American heavy metal band Metallica, released on July 27, 1984, by the independent record label Megaforce Records. The album was recorded in three weeks with producer Flemming Rasmussen at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an electric chair being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;The Stand&quot;, in which a character uses the phrase to refer to execution by electric chair.

Although rooted in the thrash metal genre, the album showcased the band&#x27;s musical growth and lyrical sophistication. Bassist Cliff Burton introduced the basics of music theory to the band and had more input in the songwriting. Beyond the fast tempos of its debut &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;, Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica&#x27;s European label Music for Nations because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It is the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, and the first to feature contributions from successor Kirk Hammett.

&quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; received a highly positive response from music critics, who saw it as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor. Metallica promoted the album on the Bang That Head That Doesn&#x27;t Bang European tour in late 1984, and on its North American leg in the first half of 1985. The band performed at major music festivals such as Monsters of Rock and Day on the Green later that year. Two months after its release, Elektra Records signed Metallica to a multi-year deal and reissued the album. &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; peaked at number 100 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with virtually no radio exposure and has since reached number 48. Although 75,000 copies were initially pressed for the American market, the album sold half a million by November 1987. It was certified 6× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2012 for shipping six million copies in the United States. Many rock publications have ranked &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; on their best album lists, saying it had a lasting impact on thrash metal.

==Background and recording==
Metallica released its debut album, &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;, on the independent label Megaforce Records on July 25, 1983. The album helped to establish thrash metal, a heavy metal subgenre defined by its brisk riffs and intense percussion. After finishing its promotional tour, Metallica began composing new material, and from September, began performing the songs that were to make up &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; at concerts. Because the band had little money, its members often ate one meal a day and stayed at fans&#x27; homes while playing at clubs across the United States. An incident occurred when part of Metallica&#x27;s gear was stolen in Boston, and Anthrax lent Metallica some of its equipment to complete the remaining dates. When not gigging, the band stayed in a rented house in El Cerrito, California, called the Metallica Mansion. Frontman James Hetfield felt uneasy about performing double duty on vocals and rhythm guitar, so the band offered the job to Armored Saint singer John Bush, who turned down the offer because Armored Saint was doing well at the time.

Hetfield gradually built confidence as lead vocalist and kept his original role. Metallica started recording on February 20, 1984, at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The album was produced by Flemming Rasmussen, the founder of Sweet Silence Studios. Drummer Lars Ulrich chose Rasmussen, because he liked his work on Rainbow&#x27;s &quot;Difficult to Cure&quot; (1981) and was keen to record in Europe. Rasmussen, who had not heard of Metallica, agreed to work on the album, even though his studio employees questioned the band&#x27;s talent. Rasmussen listened to Metallica&#x27;s tapes before the members arrived and thought the band had great potential. Metallica rehearsed the album&#x27;s material at Mercyful Fate&#x27;s practice room in Copenhagen.

Before entering the studio, Metallica collected ideas on &quot;riff tape&quot; recordings of various jam sessions. Hetfield and Ulrich went through the tapes and selected the strongest riffs to assemble into songs. Instruments were recorded separately, with only Hetfield playing rhythm guitar. Rasmussen, with the support of drum roadie Flemming Larsen, taught the basics of timing and beat duration to Ulrich, who had a tendency to increase speed and had little knowledge of rhythm theory. Drums were recorded in an empty warehouse at the back of the studio, which was not soundproof, and caused reverberation. Although four tracks were already arranged, the band members were not used to creating songs in the studio, as they had not done so for &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;. &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, &quot;Trapped Under Ice&quot;, and &quot;Escape&quot; were written mostly in Copenhagen, and the band put finishing touches on &quot;Fight Fire with Fire&quot;, &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;, &quot;Creeping Death&quot;, and &quot;The Call of Ktulu&quot;, which had already been performed live.

Lead guitarist Kirk Hammett took the album&#x27;s name from a passage in Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;The Stand&quot;. The cover art, displaying an electric chair in the midst of lightning bolts, was conceived before recording began. Metallica initially had difficulty recording because gear was stolen three weeks before the band arrived in Copenhagen. The band members slept in the studio by day as they could not afford a hotel and recorded by night, because the studio was booked by other artists during the daytime. Because the group was looking for a major label deal, several A&amp;R representatives from different labels visited the studio. At first, it seemed that Metallica was going to sign with Bronze Records, but the deal was canceled, because Bronze executive Gerry Bron did not appreciate the work done at Sweet Silence Studios, and wanted the US edition to be remixed by engineer Eddie Kramer, and even considered re-recording the album in another studio. Metallica was put off by Bron&#x27;s failure to share the band&#x27;s artistic vision and decided to look for another label for the US release, though Bronze had already advertised Metallica as one of its bands.

Metallica had to record quickly because of European shows scheduled 29 days after entering the studio. Recording finished on March 14, and Megaforce released the album on July 27. Although the original album budget was $20,000, the final expense was above . Metallica&#x27;s European label Music for Nations paid the studio costs because Megaforce owner Jon Zazula could not afford them. Metallica was unhappy with the lack of promotion by Megaforce, and decided to part ways with Zazula. Major label Elektra Records A&amp;R executive Michael Alago noticed Metallica at The Stone gig in San Francisco, and invited Elektra&#x27;s chairman and the head of promotion to see the August show in New York. The performance at Roseland Ballroom, with Anthrax and Metallica opening for Raven, pleased the Elektra staff, and the band was offered a contract the following morning. On September 12, Metallica signed with Elektra, which re-released the album on November 19. Cliff Burnstein and Peter Mensch of Q Prime were concurrently appointed as the band&#x27;s new managers. &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; is the last Metallica album to feature co-writing contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, who received credit on the title track and &quot;The Call of Ktulu&quot;. The album also represented the first time Hammett was given writing credits.

==Music and lyrics==
Music writers opine that &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; exhibits greater musical maturity, with sonically broader songs than &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;, which was noted for its one-dimensional sound. This development is partially because of bassist Cliff Burton&#x27;s knowledge of music theory. He showed Hetfield how to augment core notes with complementary counter-melodies and how basic guitar harmony works, which reflected on the song compositions. Hetfield developed more socially aware lyrics, as well as ominous and semi-philosophical references. Ulrich explained that Metallica opted not to rely strictly on fast tempos as on the previous album, but to explore other musical approaches that sounded powerful and heavy. &quot;Grinder&quot; magazine&#x27;s Kevin Fisher summarized the album as &quot;ultimate thrash, destruction and total blur&quot; that reminded him of the speed and power of &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;. Music journalist Martin Popoff observed that &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; offered &quot;sophistication and brutality in equal measure&quot; and was seen as something new at the time of its release. Discussing the album&#x27;s lyrical content, philosopher William Irwin wrote: &quot;After &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;, the rebellion and aggression became much more focused as the enemy became more clearly defined. Metallica was deeply concerned about various domains in which the common man was wrongfully yet ingeniously deceived. More precisely, they were highly critical of those in power&quot;.

The major-key acoustic introduction to &quot;Fight Fire with Fire&quot; displays Metallica&#x27;s evolution towards a more harmonically complex style of songwriting. The fastest Metallica song in terms of picking speed, it is driven by nimbly tremolo-picked riffs in the verses and chorus. The extended solo at the end dissolves in a sound effect of a vast nuclear explosion. The main riff was taped during the Kill &#x27;Em All Tour and the acoustic intro was something Burton was playing on acoustic guitar at the time. The lyrical themes focused on nuclear annihilation, and specifically critiques the doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction.

&quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; is Metallica&#x27;s first song to have emphasized the misery of the criminal justice system. The lyrics are in the perspective of a death row inmate anticipating execution by the electric chair. The song, one of the two album tracks that credits Mustaine, begins in a mid-tempo which gradually accelerates as the song progresses. One of the riffs, originally composed by Mustaine, was simplified. It features an instrumental middle section highlighted by Hammett&#x27;s soloing. According to Hetfield, the song is not a criticism of capital punishment, but a tale of a man sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit, as in the opening lyrics: &quot;Guilty as charged/But damn it/It ain&#x27;t right&quot;.
&quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; begins with a bell tolling, followed by a marching riff and high-register bass melody. The chromatic introduction, which Burton wrote before he joined Metallica, is often mistaken for an electric guitar but is actually Burton&#x27;s bass guitar augmented with distortion and a wah-wah pedal. The lyrics were inspired by Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s 1940 novel of the same name, which explores the horror and dishonor of modern warfare. &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; was released as a promotional single in two versions, an edit on side A and the album version on side B.

&quot;Fade to Black&quot; is a power ballad with lyrics about suicide. Hetfield wrote the words because he felt powerless after the band&#x27;s equipment was stolen before the January 1984 show in Boston. Musically, the song begins with an acoustic guitar introduction overlaid with electric soloing. The song becomes progressively heavier and faster, ending with multi-layered guitar solos. The ballad&#x27;s arpeggiated chords and reserved singing was incongruous for thrash metal bands at the time and disappointed some of Metallica&#x27;s fans. The song&#x27;s structure foreshadows later Metallica ballads, &quot;Welcome Home (Sanitarium)&quot;, &quot;One&quot;, and &quot;The Day That Never Comes&quot;. &quot;Fade to Black&quot; was released as a promotional single in 1984, in phosphorescent green.

&quot;Trapped Under Ice&quot; is about a person who wakes from a cryonic state. Realizing there is nowhere to go, and no-one will come to the rescue, the person helplessly awaits impending doom. The song is built on a fast-picked galloping riff, reminiscent of the album&#x27;s opener. It was inspired by a track Hammett&#x27;s former band Exodus had demoed called &quot;Impaler&quot;, which was later released on that band&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;Tempo of the Damned&quot;.

&quot;Escape&quot; was originally titled &quot;The Hammer&quot; and was intended to be released as a single due to its lighter riffs and conventional song structure. The intro features a counterpoint bass melody and a chugging guitar riff that resolves into a standard down-picked riff. &quot;Escape&quot; is Hetfield&#x27;s most disliked Metallica song, due to it being the result of the record company forcing Metallica to write something more radio friendly. Book authors Mick Wall and Malcolm Dome said the song was influenced by the album-oriented rock of 1970s bands such as Journey and Foreigner, but fans perceived it as an attempt for airplay on rock radio. Metallica has so far performed &quot;Escape&quot; live only once, at the 2012 Orion Music + More festival, while performing &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; in its entirety.

&quot;Creeping Death&quot; describes the Plague of the Death of the Firstborn (Exodus 12:29). The lyrics deal with the ten plagues visited on Ancient Egypt; four of them are mentioned throughout the song, as well as the Passover. The title was inspired by a scene from &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; while the band was watching the movie at Burton&#x27;s house. The bridge, with its chant &quot;Die, by my hand!&quot;, was originally written by Hammett for the song &quot;Die by His Hand&quot; while he was playing in Exodus, who recorded it as a demo but did not feature it on a studio album. Journalist Joel McIver called the song a &quot;moshpit anthem&quot; due to its epic lyrical themes and dramatic atmosphere. &quot;Creeping Death&quot; was released as a single with a B-side titled &quot;Garage Days Revisited&quot; made up of covers of Diamond Head&#x27;s &quot;Am I Evil?&quot; and Blitzkrieg&#x27;s &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;.

&quot;The Call of Ktulu&quot;, tentatively titled &quot;When Hell Freezes Over&quot;, was inspired by H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s book &quot;The Shadow over Innsmouth&quot;, which was introduced to the rest of the band by Burton. The title was taken from one of Lovecraft&#x27;s key stories featuring Cthulhu, &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot;, although the original name was modified to &quot;Ktulu&quot; for easier pronunciation. The track begins with a D minor chord progression in the intro, written by Mustaine (Mustaine later re-used the chord structure on Megadeth&#x27;s track &quot;Hangar 18&quot;) followed by a two-minute bass solo over a rhythmic riff pattern. Conductor Michael Kamen rearranged the piece for Metallica&#x27;s 1999 &quot;S&amp;M&quot; project and won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2001.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; received widespread acclaim from music critics. According to &quot;Q&quot; magazine, the album confirmed Metallica&#x27;s status as the leading heavy metal band of the modern era. The magazine credited the group for redefining the norms of thrash metal with &quot;Fade to Black&quot;, the genre&#x27;s first power ballad. British rock magazine &quot;Kerrang!&quot; stated that the album&#x27;s maturity and musical intelligence helped Metallica expand heavy metal&#x27;s boundaries. Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; described &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; as a more refined extension of the group&#x27;s debut. In a retrospective review, Sputnikmusic&#x27;s Channing Freeman named it as one of the few albums that can be charming and powerful at the same time. He praised Hetfield&#x27;s vocal performance and concluded that Metallica was &quot;firing on all cylinders&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey saw the album as a more ambitious and remarkable effort than &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;. He called &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; an &quot;all-time metal classic&quot; because of the band&#x27;s rich musical imagination and lyrics that avoided heavy metal cliches.

&quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; viewed the album as a great step forward for the band and as an album that established the concept for Metallica&#x27;s following two records. Colin Larkin, writing in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot;, singled out &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; as an example of Metallica&#x27;s growing music potential. Popoff regards &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; as an album where &quot;extreme metal became art&quot;. &quot;This literally was the first album since (Judas Priest&#x27;s 1976) &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot; where the rulebook has changed. This was a new kind of heaviness; the soft, billowy but explosive production was amazing, the speed was superhuman&quot;, stated Popoff. Reviewing the 2016 reissue, Jason Anderson of &quot;Uncut&quot; considers &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; the second best Metallica album which set the pace for metal in the years to come.

Megaforce initially pressed 75,000 copies of the album for the US market, while Music for Nations serviced the European market. By late 1984, 85,000 copies of &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; had been sold in Europe, resulting in Metallica&#x27;s first cover story for &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in its December issue. After signing Metallica, Elektra released the single &quot;Creeping Death&quot; in a sleeve depicting a bridge and a skull painted grey and green. The album peaked at number 100 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with no radio exposure. &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; went gold by November 1987 and in 2012 was certified 6× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for six million copies shipped in the US.

The album, along with &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;, was reissued in 2016 as a boxed set including demos and live recordings. Many rock publications have ranked &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; on their best album lists. The album placed fifth on IGN Music&#x27;s &quot;Top 25 Metal Albums&quot; list. &quot;Spin&quot; listed it as a thrash metal essential, declaring it &quot;the thrashiest thrash ever&quot;. According to &quot;Guitar World&quot;, &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; &quot;didn&#x27;t just change the band&#x27;s trajectory—it reset the course of metal itself&quot;. Corey Deiterman of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; considers &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; the most influential Metallica album, saying it had a lasting impact on genres such as crossover thrash and hardcore punk. In 2017, it was ranked 11th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. In a 1991 interview, Jason Newsted stated that &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; was next to &quot;Metallica&quot;, &quot;the best album ever&quot;.

==Touring==
After recording was completed, Music for Nations founder Martin Hooker wanted to arrange a triple-bill UK tour in March / April 1984 with Exciter, Metallica, and the Rods. The Hell on Earth Tour never materialized because of poor ticket sales. To promote &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;, Metallica commenced the Bang That Head That Doesn&#x27;t Bang European tour on November 16, in Rouen, France, with English new wave band Tank as support. The tour continued with dates in Belgium, Italy, Germany, and the Nordic countries to an average crowd of 1,300. After a Christmas break, the group embarked on a 50-date North American tour, first as a co-headlining act with W.A.S.P. and then as headliners with Armored Saint supporting. At a gig in Portland, Oregon, Metallica covered &quot;The Money Will Roll Right In&quot; by Fang, with Armored Saint onstage.

The American leg ended in March 1985, and the band spent the following months working on the next studio album, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, whose recording sessions were scheduled to begin in September. Metallica performed at the Monsters of Rock festival held at Castle Donington in England on August 17 in front of 70,000 fans. The band was placed between Ratt and Bon Jovi, two glam metal groups whose sound and appearance were much unlike Metallica&#x27;s. At the start of the set, Hetfield pronounced to the audience: &quot;If you came here to see spandex, eye make-up, and the words &#x27;oh baby&#x27; in every fuckin&#x27; song, this ain&#x27;t the fuckin&#x27; band!&quot; Two weeks later, Metallica appeared on the Day on the Green festival in Oakland, California, before 90,000 people. The last show Metallica played before recording began was the Loreley Metal Hammer Festival in Germany, headlined by Venom. &quot;Disposable Heroes&quot; from the upcoming album was performed live for the first time at this festival. Metallica finished 1985 with a show at the Sacramento Memorial Auditorium on December 29 opening for Y&amp;T, and a New Year&#x27;s Eve concert at the Civic Auditorium in San Francisco on a bill with Metal Church, Exodus, and Megadeth, the first time Metallica and Megadeth shared a stage. At this gig, Metallica premiered &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; from the then-upcoming third studio album.

<doc id="18760" wikidata="Q213516" url="?curid=18760" title="Metallica (album)">
<text>Metallica (commonly known as The Black Album) is the fifth studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica. It was released on August 12, 1991, by Elektra Records. Recording sessions took place at One on One Recording Studios in Los Angeles over an eight-month span that frequently found Metallica at odds with their new producer Bob Rock. The album marked a change in the band&#x27;s music from the thrash metal style of their previous four albums to a slower, heavier, and more refined sound.

Metallica promoted &quot;Metallica&quot; with a series of tours. They also released five singles to promote the album: &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;, &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;, &quot;Wherever I May Roam&quot;, and &quot;Sad but True&quot;, all of which have been considered to be among the band&#x27;s best-known songs. The song &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread on Me&quot; was also issued to rock radio shortly after the album&#x27;s release but did not receive a commercial single release.

&quot;Metallica&quot; received widespread critical acclaim and became the band&#x27;s best-selling album. It debuted at number one in ten countries and spent four consecutive weeks at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it Metallica&#x27;s first album to top the album charts. With over 30 million copies sold worldwide, &quot;Metallica&quot; is one of the best-selling albums worldwide, and also one of the best-selling albums in the United States since Nielsen SoundScan tracking began. The album was certified 16× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2012, and has sold over sixteen million copies in the United States, being the first album in the SoundScan era to do so.

The band played &quot;Metallica&quot; in reverse order during the 2012 European Black Album Tour. In 2020, the album was ranked number 235 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list. In December 2019, &quot;Metallica&quot; became the fourth release in American history to enter the 550-week milestone on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It also became the second-longest charting traditional title in history only behind &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973) by Pink Floyd, and the second to spend 550 weeks on the album charts.

== Background and recording ==

At the time of &quot;Metallica&quot; recording, the band&#x27;s songs were written mainly by frontman James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, with Hetfield being the lyricist. The duo frequently composed together at Ulrich&#x27;s house in Berkeley, California. Several song ideas and concepts were conceived by other members of the band, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Jason Newsted. For instance, Newsted wrote the main riff of &quot;My Friend of Misery&quot;, which was originally intended to be an instrumental, one of which had been included on every previous Metallica album. The songs were written in two months in mid-1990; the ideas for some of them were originated during the Damaged Justice Tour. Metallica was impressed with Bob Rock&#x27;s production work on Mötley Crüe&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; (1989) and decided to hire him to work on their album. Initially, the band members were not interested in having Rock producing the album as well, but changed their minds. Ulrich said, &quot;We felt that we still had our best record in us and Bob Rock could help us make it&quot;.

Four demos for the album were recorded on August 13, 1990; &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;, &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; and &quot;Wherever I May Roam&quot;. The lead single &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; was the first song to be written and the last to receive lyrics. On October 4, 1990, a demo of &quot;Sad but True&quot; was recorded. In October 1990, Metallica began recording at One on One Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, to record the album, and also at Little Mountain Sound Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia, for about a week. On June 2, 1991, a demo of &quot;Holier than Thou&quot; was recorded. Hetfield stated about the recording: &quot;What we really wanted was a live feel. In the past, Lars and I constructed the rhythm parts without Kirk and Jason. This time I wanted to try playing as a band unit in the studio. It lightens things up and you get more of a vibe.&quot;

Because it was Rock&#x27;s first time producing a Metallica album, he had the band make the album in different ways; he asked them to record songs collaboratively rather than individually in separate locations. He also suggested recording tracks live and using harmonic vocals for Hetfield. Rock was expecting the production to be &quot;easy&quot; but had trouble working with the band, leading to frequent, engaged arguments with the band members over aspects of the album. Rock wanted Hetfield to write better lyrics and found his experience recording with Metallica disappointing: the recording experience was so stressful that Rock briefly swore never to work with the band again. The tension between band and producer was documented in &quot;A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica&quot; and &quot;Classic Albums: Metallica – Metallica&quot;.

Since the band was perfectionist, Rock insisted they record as many takes as needed to get the sound they wanted.&lt;ref name=&quot;AY&amp;½ITLOM (1/2)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The album was remixed three times and cost . The troubled production coincided with Ulrich, Hammett, and Newsted divorcing their wives; Hammett said this influenced their playing because they were &quot;trying to take those feeling of guilt and failure and channel them into the music, to get something positive out of it&quot;.

== Composition and lyrics ==

The album was a change in Metallica&#x27;s direction from the thrash metal style of the band&#x27;s previous four studio albums towards a more commercial, heavy metal sound, but still had characteristics of thrash metal. The band took a simpler approach partly because the members felt the songs on &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; were too long and complex. Hetfield said that radio airplay was not their intention, but because they felt &quot;we had pretty much done the longer song format to death,&quot; and considered a good change doing songs with just two riffs and &quot;only taking two minutes to get the point across&quot;. Ulrich added that the band was feeling a musical insecurity — &quot;We felt inadequate as musicians and as songwriters. That made us go too far, around &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; and &quot;Justice&quot;, in the direction of trying to prove ourselves. &#x27;We&#x27;ll do all this weird-ass shit sideways to prove that we are capable musicians and songwriters&#x27;&quot; – and Hetfield added he wanted to avoid getting stale: &quot;Sitting there and worrying about whether people are going to like the album, therefore we have to write a certain kind of song — you just end up writing for someone else. Everyone&#x27;s different. If everyone was the same, it would be boring as shit.&quot;

Instruments not usually used by heavy metal bands, such as the cellos in &quot;The Unforgiven&quot; and the orchestra in &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;, were added at Rock&#x27;s insistence. Rock also raised the volume of the bass guitar, which had been nearly inaudible on the previous album &quot;...And Justice for All&quot;. Newsted said he tried to &quot;create a real rhythm section rather than a one-dimensional sound&quot; with his bass. Newsted credited Rock with helping him find a sound that would work without killing the bass drum or messing with the lower end of the guitar, which Newsted claimed had always been a real big problem with him. Ulrich said he tried to avoid the &quot;progressive Peartian paradiddles which became boring to play live&quot; in his drumming and used a basic sound similar to those of the Rolling Stones&#x27; Charlie Watts and AC/DC&#x27;s Phil Rudd.

The lyrics of &quot;Metallica&quot; written by James Hetfield were more personal and introspective in nature than those of previous Metallica albums; Rock said Hetfield&#x27;s songwriting became more confident, and that he was inspired by Bob Dylan, Bob Marley, and John Lennon. According to Chris True of AllMusic, &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; is about &quot;nightmares and all that come with them&quot;. &quot;The God That Failed&quot; dealt with the death of Hetfield&#x27;s mother from cancer and her Christian Science beliefs, which kept her from seeking medical treatment. &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; was a love song Hetfield wrote about his recent ex-girlfriend while on tour. Hetfield said the album&#x27;s lyrical themes were more introspective because he wanted &quot;lyrics that the band could stand behind – but we are four completely different individuals. So the only way to go was in.&quot;

== Packaging ==

Metallica had many discussions about the album title; the members considered calling it &quot;Five&quot; or using the title of one of the songs, but eventually chose an eponym because they &quot;wanted to keep it simple.&quot; The album&#x27;s cover depicts the band&#x27;s logo angled against the upper left corner and a coiled snake derived from the Gadsden flag in the bottom right corner. For the initial release, both emblems were embossed so they could barely be seen against the black background, giving &quot;Metallica&quot; the nickname &quot;The Black Album&quot;. These emblems also appear on the back cover of the album. For later and current releases, both emblems are dark gray so they stand out more prominently. The motto of the Gadsden flag, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread on Me&quot;, is also the title of a song on the album. A folded, pageless booklet depicts the faces of the band&#x27;s members against a black background. The lyrics and liner notes are also printed on a grey background.

The cover is reminiscent of Spinal Tap&#x27;s album &quot;Smell the Glove&quot;, which the band jokingly acknowledged in its documentary &quot;A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica&quot;. Members of Spinal Tap appeared on the film and asked Metallica about it, with Lars Ulrich commenting that British rock group Status Quo was the original inspiration as that band&#x27;s &quot;Hello!&quot; album cover was also black.

== Marketing and sales ==
&quot;Enter Sandman&quot; was released as &quot;Metallica&quot;″s lead single on July 29, 1991; it reached number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The follow-up single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread on Me&quot;, was released promotionally but did not chart. The subsequent single, &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;, was a Top 40 hit; it peaked in the Top 10 in Australia.

&quot;Metallica&quot; was released on August 12, 1991, and was the band&#x27;s first album to debut at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 598,000 copies in its first week. It was certified platinum in two weeks and spent four consecutive weeks atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Meanwhile, more singles were released to further success. &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; reached number six in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and &quot;Wherever I May Roam&quot; peaked at number two on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks singles chart, although the 1993 single &quot;Sad but True&quot; charted only for one week on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at 98. Almost all singles were accompanied by music videos; the Wayne Isham-directed &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; promotional film won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards.
Internationally, &quot;Metallica&quot; was also a success. It debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and was certified 2× platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for selling 600,000 copies in the UK. &quot;Metallica&quot; topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. It also reached the top five in Austria, Finland, and Japan, as well as the top 10 in Spain. The album failed to reach the top 20 in Ireland, having peaked at number 27. The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) certified the album 12× platinum. It received diamond plaques from the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) and the Recorded Music NZ (RMNZ) for shipping a million and 150,000 copies, respectively.

Logging over 488 weeks on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, &quot;Metallica&quot; proved the third-longest charting album in the Nielsen SoundScan era, behind Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and Carole King&#x27;s &quot;Tapestry&quot;. In 2009, it surpassed Shania Twain&#x27;s &quot;Come On Over&quot; as the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. It became the first album in the SoundScan era to pass 16 million in sales, and with 16.4 million copies sold by 2016, &quot;Metallica&quot; is the best-selling album in the United States since Nielsen SoundScan tracking began in 1991. Of that sum, 5.8 million were purchased on cassette. The album never sold fewer than 1,000 copies in a week, and moved a weekly average of 5,000 copies in 2016. &quot;Metallica&quot; was certified 16× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2012 for shipping sixteen million copies in the US. &quot;Metallica&quot; sold 31 million copies worldwide on physical media. All five of &quot;Metallica&quot;″s singles, &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;, &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;, &quot;Wherever I May Roam&quot; and &quot;Sad but True&quot; charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

=== Touring ===

In 1991, for the fourth time, Metallica played as part of the Monsters of Rock festival tour. The last concert of the tour was held on September 28, 1991, at Tushino Airfield in Moscow; it was described as &quot;the first free outdoor Western rock concert in Soviet history&quot; and was attended by an estimated 150,000 to 500,000 people. Some unofficial estimates put the attendance as high as 1,600,000. The first tour directly intended to support the album, the Wherever We May Roam Tour, included a performance at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, at which Metallica performed a short set list, consisting of &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, &quot;Sad but True&quot;, and &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;, along with Hetfield performed the Queen song &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot; with John Deacon, Brian May, and Roger Taylor of Queen and Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath. At one of the tour&#x27;s first gigs the floor of the stage collapsed. The January 13 and 14, 1992, shows in San Diego were later released in the box set &quot;Live Shit: Binge &amp; Purge&quot;, while the tour and the album were documented in the documentary &quot;A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica&quot;.

Metallica&#x27;s Wherever We May Roam Tour also overlapped with Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; Use Your Illusion Tour. Hetfield suffered second and third degree burns to his arms, face, hands, and legs on August 8, 1992, during a Montreal show in the co-headlining Guns N&#x27; Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour. The tour included pyrotechnics, which were installed on-stage. Hetfield accidentally walked into a flame shot from a pyrotechnic during a live performance of the introduction of &quot;Fade to Black&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AY&amp;½ITLOM (2/2)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The show was cut short shortly after this accident, so that Guns N&#x27; Roses began their concert to malicious reactions from fans. Newsted said Hetfield&#x27;s skin was &quot;bubbling like on &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot;&quot;. The tour recommenced on August 25 in Phoenix, and although Hetfield could sing, he could not play guitar for the remainder of the tour. Guitar technician John Marshall, who had previously filled in on rhythm guitar and was then playing in Metal Church, played guitar for the recovering Hetfield. Brazilian musician Andreas Kisser from Sepultura was initially considered to join the tour, but Marshall ultimately was chosen.

The shows in Mexico City across February and March 1993 during the Nowhere Else to Roam tour were recorded, filmed and later also released as part of the band&#x27;s first box set, which was released in November 1993 and titled &quot;Live Shit: Binge &amp; Purge&quot;. The collection contained three live CDs, three home videos, and a book filled with riders and letters. Pressings of the box set since November 2002 includes two DVDs, the first one being filmed at San Diego on the Wherever We May Roam Tour, and the latter at Seattle on the Damaged Justice Tour. &quot;Binge &amp; Purge&quot; was packaged as a cardboard box resembling that of a typical tour equipment transport box. The box set also featured a recreated copy of an access pass to the &quot;Snakepit&quot; part of the tour stage, as well as a cardboard drawing/airbrush stencil for the &quot;Scary Guy&quot; logo. The Mexico City shows were also the first time the band met future member Robert Trujillo, who was in Suicidal Tendencies at the time.

The final tour supporting the album, the Shit Hits the Sheds Tour, included a performance at Woodstock &#x27;94 that followed Nine Inch Nails and preceded Aerosmith on August 13 in front of a crowd of 350,000. Some songs, such as &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;, and &quot;Sad but True&quot;, became permanent staples of Metallica&#x27;s concert setlists during these and subsequent tours. Other songs though, such as &quot;Holier than Thou&quot;, &quot;The God That Failed&quot;, &quot;Through the Never&quot;, and &quot;The Unforgiven&quot; were no longer included in performances after 1995 and would not be played again until the 2000s, when Metallica began performing a more extensive back catalog of songs with Robert Trujillo on bass after he joined the band upon completion of the album &quot;St. Anger&quot;.

After touring duties for the album were finished, Metallica filed a lawsuit against Elektra Records, which tried to force the record label to terminate the band&#x27;s contract and give the band ownership of their master recordings. The band based its claim on a section of the California Labor Code that allows employees to be released from a personal services contract after seven years. Metallica had sold 40 million copies worldwide upon the filing of the suit. Metallica had been signed to the label for over a decade but was still operating under the terms of its original 1984 contract, which provided a relatively low 14% royalty rate. The band members said they were taking the action because they were ambivalent about Robert Morgado&#x27;s refusal to give them another record deal along with Bob Krasnow, who retired from his job at the label shortly afterwards. Elektra responded by counter-suing the band, but in December 1994, Warner Music Group United States chairman Doug Morris offered Metallica a lucrative new deal in exchange for dropping the suit, which was reported to be even more generous than the earlier Krasnow deal. In January 1995, both parties settled out of court with a non-disclosure agreement. Metallica played the album in its entirety during the 2012 European Black Album Tour.

== Critical reception and legacy ==

&quot;Metallica&quot; was met with widespread acclaim from both heavy metal journalists and mainstream publications, including &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. In &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, David Browne called it &quot;rock&#x27;s preeminent speed-metal cyclone&quot;, and said, &quot;Metallica may have invented a new genre: progressive thrash&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s Mark Cooper said he found the album&#x27;s avoidance of metal&#x27;s typically clumsy metaphors and glossy production refreshing; he said, &quot;Metallica manage to rekindle the kind of intensity that fired the likes of Black Sabbath before metal fell in love with its own cliches&quot;. &quot;Select&quot; magazine&#x27;s David Cavanagh believed the album lacks artifice and is &quot;disarmingly genuine&quot;. In his review for &quot;Spin&quot;, Alec Foege found the music&#x27;s harmonies vividly performed and said that Metallica showcase their &quot;newfound versatility&quot; on songs such as &quot;The Unforgiven&quot; and &quot;Holier than Thou&quot;. Robert Palmer, writing in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, said that several songs sound like &quot;hard-rock classics&quot; and that, apart from &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread on Me&quot;, &quot;Metallica&quot; is an &quot;exemplary album of mature but still kickass rock &amp; roll&quot;. In his guide to Metallica&#x27;s albums up to that point, Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; recommended the album as &quot;a great place for Metallica neophytes to start, with its more concise songs and explosive production.&quot;

Some reviewers had reservations. Jonathan Gold, in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, said that while Metallica had embraced pop sensibilities &quot;quite well&quot;, there was a sense the group was &quot;no longer in love with the possibilities of its sound&quot; on an album whose difficulty being embraced by the &quot;metal cult&quot; mirrored Bob Dylan going electric in the mid-1960s. More critical was Robert Christgau, who wrote in his &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; that he &quot;put James Hetfield out of his misery in under five plays&quot; of the album and that he &quot;found life getting shorter with every song&quot;. In his 2000 collection &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Consumer Guide&quot;, Christgau later graded &quot;Metallica&quot; a &quot;dud&quot;, indicating &quot;a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought&quot;.

Retrospective appraisals have been positive. In a retrospective article, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; said &quot;Metallica&quot; is the album that &quot;propelled [the band] out of the metal ghetto to true mainstream global rock superstardom&quot;. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; said that as a deliberate departure from the band&#x27;s thrash style on &quot;...And Justice for All&quot;, &quot;&quot;Metallica&quot; was slower, less complicated, and probably twice as heavy as anything they&#x27;d done before&quot;. In his review for BBC Music, Sid Smith said that although staunch listeners of the band accused them of selling out, Metallica confidently departed from the style of their previous albums and transitioned &quot;from cult metal gods to bona fide rock stars&quot;. &quot;Classic Rock&quot; called it &quot;the absolute pinnacle of Metallica&#x27;s long and successful career&quot;, and credited the album for inspiring 1990s post-grunge music and convincing the music industry to embrace heavy metal as a genre with mass appeal. Author and philosopher Thomas Walker wrote in 2020, &quot;Its success at encapsulating...[individualist] ideas in musical form and bringing them to a global audience is truly unique.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey believed the massive popularity of &quot;Metallica&quot; inspired other speed metal bands to also embrace a simpler, less progressive sound. He deemed it &quot;a good, but not quite great, album, one whose best moments deservedly captured the heavy metal crown, but whose approach also foreshadowed a creative decline [for Metallica.]&quot;

Speaking in &quot;The Independent&quot;, Metallica biographer Paul Stenning explained that Metallica created &quot;a sound that had not really been heard in metal before, especially by a thrash band.&quot;

Iron Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson said that Metallica should be given huge credit for &quot;grabbing the opportunity when it came up, taking the risk and deservedly reaping the enormous rewards&quot;, and that their achievement with the album cannot be underestimated. He also shared his thoughts on it as well, &quot;It&#x27;s one of those seminal albums that just gets it right. It&#x27;s extremely well-produced, and every note on that album is totally under control. I admire how they did it, and what they did with the songs, and it was very effective: it undoubtedly did help push metal into the mainstream.&quot;

To celebrate the 30th anniversary of &quot;Metallica&quot;, a 53-track covers album titled &quot;The Metallica Blacklist&quot; was released on September 10, 2021. The album features covers of songs from &quot;Metallica&quot; from over 50 artists in various styles. All profits from the album are donated to the band&#x27;s All Within My Hands Foundation as well as charities of each contributing artist&#x27;s choice.

=== Accolades ===

&quot;Metallica&quot; was voted the eighth best album of 1991 in the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; ranked it number 16 in the magazine&#x27;s December 1991 list of the year&#x27;s best albums. In 1992, the album won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. In 2000, it was voted number 88 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Metallica&quot; number 255 on &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, and then number 235 in a 2020 revised edition of the list. It was also ranked 25th on the magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot; (2017). &quot;Spin&quot; ranked it number 52 on the &quot;90 Greatest Albums of the &#x27;90s&quot; (1999), with its entry reading: &quot;this record&#x27;s diamond-tipped tuneage stripped the band&#x27;s melancholy guitar excess down to melodic, radio-ready bullets and ballads&quot;. &quot;Metallica&quot; featured in &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s August 2000 list of the &quot;Best Metal Albums of All Time&quot;; the magazine said the album &quot;transformed them from cult metal heroes into global superstars, bringing a little refinement to their undoubted power&quot;. In 1999, eight years after the album&#x27;s release, &quot;Metallica&quot; won a Billboard Music Award for Catalog Album of the Year.

<text>Load is the sixth studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on June 4, 1996, by Elektra Records in the United States and by Vertigo Records internationally. The album showed more of a hard rock side of Metallica than the band&#x27;s typical thrash metal style, which alienated much of the band&#x27;s fanbase. It also featured influences from genres such as Southern rock, blues rock, country rock, and alternative rock. Drummer Lars Ulrich said about &quot;Load&quot; more exploratory nature, &quot;This album and what we&#x27;re doing with it – that, to me, is what Metallica are all about: exploring different things. The minute you stop exploring, then just sit down and fucking die.&quot; At 79 minutes, &quot;Load&quot; is Metallica&#x27;s longest studio album.

&quot;Load&quot; received mixed reviews from critics but was a commercial success, debuting and spending four consecutive weeks at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. &quot;Load&quot; sold 680,000 units in its first week, making it the biggest opening week for Metallica as well as the biggest debut of 1996. It was certified 5× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping five million copies in the United States. Four singles—&quot;Until It Sleeps&quot;, &quot;Hero of the Day&quot;, &quot;Mama Said&quot;, and &quot;King Nothing&quot;—were released as part of the marketing campaign for the album.

==Background==
&quot;Load&quot;, released approximately five years after the commercially successful album &quot;Metallica&quot;, saw the band shifting toward hard rock and further away from their thrash metal roots. As on previous releases, the album&#x27;s fourteen songs began as rough demos created by principal songwriters James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich in Ulrich&#x27;s basement recording studio, &quot;The Dungeon&quot;. In early 1995, the band took over thirty demos into The Plant Studios, where they would work for approximately one year. Metallica worked with producer Bob Rock, who had been at the helm during the recording process for &quot;Metallica&quot;.

The songwriting dispensed almost entirely with the thrash metal style that characterized the band&#x27;s sound in the 1980s. Metallica had listed several artists and bands from which they took inspiration while writing &quot;Load&quot; and &quot;Reload&quot; that strayed from the types of bands that influenced them for their earlier albums, including Kyuss, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Primus, ZZ Top, Pantera, Corrosion of Conformity, Ted Nugent, Aerosmith, and even more mainstream acts like Oasis, Alanis Morissette, and Garth Brooks, among others. This resulted in &quot;Load&quot; having a much more mid-paced, groovier sound that verged on hard rock. In place of staccato riffs, Hetfield and lead guitarist Kirk Hammett experimented with blues rock-based tones and styles. Additionally, Ulrich adopted a minimalist approach to his drum recording, abandoning the speed and complex double bass drumming patterns of previous albums, and using simpler techniques and playing styles. 

The album&#x27;s lyrical themes show a striking departure from Metallica&#x27;s previously social and politically charged subjects; many of &quot;Load&quot;&#x27;s tracks discuss themes of depression, including &quot;Bleeding Me&quot;, &quot;Mama Said&quot;, and &quot;Until It Sleeps&quot;, all of which are about the death of Hetfield&#x27;s mother, and &quot;The Outlaw Torn&quot;, which is said to be about the band coping with Cliff Burton&#x27;s death. Other songs, such as &quot;The House Jack Built&quot; and &quot;Cure&quot;, discuss themes of drug and alcohol addiction, and &quot;Thorn Within&quot; and &quot;Poor Twisted Me&quot; reflect James&#x27;s struggles with depression.

Hammett, encouraged by producer Bob Rock, also played rhythm guitar on a Metallica album for the first time, having previously only played lead parts with Hetfield playing all the rhythm parts to achieve a tighter feel, in contrast to the looser feel they were looking for here. Hammett continued playing rhythm until &quot;Death Magnetic&quot; when Hetfield once again played all the rhythm parts.

At 79 minutes, &quot;Load&quot; is Metallica&#x27;s longest studio album. With the CD length at 78:59, initial pressings of the album were affixed with stickers boasting of its long playtime, simply reading &quot;78:59&quot;. &quot;The Outlaw Torn&quot; had to be shortened by about one minute to fit on the album; the full version of the track was released on the single &quot;The Memory Remains&quot; as &quot;The Outlaw Torn (Unencumbered by Manufacturing Restrictions Version)&quot;, with a running time of 10:48. An explanation on the single&#x27;s back cover stated:

&quot;Load&quot; was Metallica&#x27;s first album on which all tracks were down-tuned to E♭ tuning. Hammett states:

The band had recorded songs on earlier albums in tunings lower than E: &quot;The God That Failed&quot; (&quot;Metallica&quot;) was in E♭, and &quot;Sad but True&quot; (&quot;Metallica&quot;) and &quot;The Thing That Should Not Be&quot; (&quot;Master of Puppets&quot;) were in D tuning. Hetfield also felt that the change to E♭ was a bonus, as it was easier to perform string bends in the riffs.

The Australian CD release of &quot;Load&quot; includes a bonus interview CD that is unavailable elsewhere. 10 songs from the album have been played live including &quot;King Nothing&quot;, &quot;Until It Sleeps&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t My Bitch&quot;, &quot;Bleeding Me&quot;, &quot;Wasting My Hate&quot;, &quot;Hero of the Day&quot;, &quot;The Outlaw Torn&quot;, &quot;2 X 4&quot;, &quot;Poor Twisted Me&quot;, &quot;Mama Said&quot;. Songs that have not been played live in their entirety are &quot;The House Jack Built&quot;, &quot;Cure&quot;, &quot;Thorn Within&quot;, and &quot;Ronnie&quot;.

==Artwork==
The cover of &quot;Load&quot; is an original artwork titled &quot;Semen and Blood III&quot;. It is one of three photographic studies that Andres Serrano created in 1990 by mingling bovine blood and his own semen between two sheets of Plexiglas. The liner notes simply state &quot;cover art by Andres Serrano&quot; rather than listing the title of the work. Hammett learned of Serrano&#x27;s work from Godflesh frontman Justin Broadrick when he was shown the music video Serrano had directed for the Godflesh song &quot;Crush My Soul&quot;. Broadrick claimed that no one in Metallica knew about Serrano before the &quot;Crush My Soul&quot; music video. 

In a 2009 interview with &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, Hetfield expressed his dislike of the album cover and its inspiration:

&quot;Load&quot; also marked the first appearance of a new Metallica logo that rounded off the stabbing edges of the band&#x27;s earlier logo, greatly simplifying its appearance. The M from the original logo was used to make a shuriken-like symbol known as the &quot;ninja star&quot;, which was used as an alternate logo on this and future albums, and on related artwork. The album featured an expansive booklet containing photographs by Anton Corbijn. These photographs depict the band in various dress, including white A-shirts with suspenders, Cuban suits, and gothic. In the aforementioned 2009 interview, James Hetfield said:

==Reception==

&quot;Load&quot; received mixed to positive reviews from critics. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said, &quot;The foursome dams the bombast and chugs half-speed ahead, settling into a wholly magnetizing groove that bridges old-school biker rock and the doomier side of post-grunge &#x27;90s rock.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; enthused, &quot;These boys set up their tents in the darkest place of all, in the naked horror of their own heads... Metallica make existential metal and they&#x27;ve never needed the props... Metallica are still awesome... What is new is streamlined attack, the focus and, yes, the tunes.&quot;

&quot;Melody Maker&quot; expressed reservations about &quot;Load&quot;&#x27;s heaviness compared to its predecessors: &quot;A Metallica album is traditionally an exhausting event. It should rock you to exhaustion, leave you brutalised and drained. This one is no exception. It is, however, the first Metallica album to make me wonder at any point, &#x27;What the fuck was that?&#x27; It&#x27;s as if the jackboot grinding the human face were to take occasional breaks for a pedicure.&quot; AllMusic considered &quot;Load&quot; repetitive, uninteresting and poorly executed. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau said &quot;this is just a metal record with less solo room, which is good because it concentrates their chops, and more singing, which isn&#x27;t because they can&#x27;t.&quot;

&quot;Some of that stuff was pretty cool,&quot; remarked Lars Ulrich of the album and its follow-up. &quot;With &quot;Load&quot;, it was disappointing that some people&#x27;s reaction to the music was biased by how they dealt with the pictures – the hair and all that crap &quot;[see Artwork, above]&quot;. People have come up to me years afterwards and said, &#x27;I never gave the record a fair chance because I couldn&#x27;t get beyond Jason Newsted wearing eyeliner.&#x27; But &#x27;The Outlaw Torn&#x27;, some of that shit is pretty fucking awesome.&quot;
