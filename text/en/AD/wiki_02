<text>Islamism is a range of religious and political ideological movements that believe that Islam should influence political systems. Its proponents believe Islam is innately political, and that Islam as a political system is superior to communism, liberal democracy, capitalism, and other alternatives in achieving a just, successful society. Islamism is considered anti-colonialist, anti-Zionist, anti-capitalist, and anti-communist; Islamists support family values, sharia, the abolition of interest-based finance, and the Quranic command of &#x27;Enjoining good and forbidding wrong.&#x27;

The advocates of Islamism, also known as &quot;al-Islamiyyun&quot;, are usually affiliated with Islamic institutions or social mobilization movements, emphasizing the implementation of &quot;sharia&quot;, pan-Islamic political unity, and the creation of Islamic states.

In its original formulation, Islamism described an ideology seeking to revive Islam to its past assertiveness and glory, purifying it of foreign elements, reasserting its role into &quot;social and political as well as personal life&quot;; and in particular &quot;reordering government and society in accordance with laws prescribed by Islam&quot; (i.e. Sharia). According to at least one observer (author Robin Wright), Islamist movements have &quot;arguably altered the Middle East more than any trend since the modern states gained independence&quot;, redefining &quot;politics and even borders&quot;. Another sole author (Graham E. Fuller) has argued for a broader notion of Islamism as a form of identity politics, involving &quot;support for [Muslim] identity, authenticity, broader regionalism, revivalism, [and] revitalization of the community.&quot;

Central and prominent figures in 20th-century Islamism include Sayyid Rashid Riḍā, Hassan al-Banna (founder of the Muslim Brotherhood), Sayyid Qutb, Abul A&#x27;la Maududi, Ruhollah Khomeini (founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran), Hassan Al-Turabi. Syrian Sunni cleric Muhammad Rashid Riḍā, a fervent opponent of Westernization, Zionism and nationalism, advocated Sunni internationalism through revolutionary restoration of a pan-Islamic Caliphate to politically unite the Muslim world. Riḍā was a strong exponent of Islamic vanguardism, the belief that Muslim community should be guided by clerical elites (&quot;ulema&quot;) who steered the efforts for religious education and Islamic revival. Riḍā&#x27;s Salafi-Arabist synthesis and Islamist ideals greatly influenced his disciples like Hasan al-Banna, an Egyptian schoolteacher who founded the Muslim Brotherhood movement, and Hajji Amin al-Husayni, the anti-Zionist Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. Al-Banna and Maududi called for a &quot;reformist&quot; strategy to re-Islamizing society through grassroots social and political activism. Other Islamists (Al-Turabi) are proponents of a &quot;revolutionary&quot; strategy of Islamizing society through exercise of state power, or (Sayyid Qutb) for combining grassroots Islamization with armed revolution. The term has been applied to non-state reform movements, political parties, militias and revolutionary groups.

Islamists themselves prefer terms such as &quot;Islamic movement&quot;, or &quot;Islamic activism&quot; to &quot;Islamism&quot;, objecting to the insinuation that Islamism is anything other than Islam renewed and revived. In public and academic contexts, the term &quot;Islamism&quot; has been criticized as having been given connotations of violence, extremism, and violations of human rights, by the Western mass media, leading to Islamophobia and stereotyping.

Prominent Islamist groups and parties across the world include the Muslim Brotherhood, Turkey&#x27;s Justice and Development Party, Hamas, Hay&#x27;at Tahrir al-Sham, the Algerian Movement of Society for Peace, the Malaysian National Trust Party, Jamaat-e-Islami in Bangladesh and Pakistan and Bosnia&#x27;s Party of Democratic Action. Following the Arab Spring, many post-Islamist currents became heavily involved in democratic politics, while others spawned &quot;the most aggressive and ambitious Islamist militia&quot; to date, such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). ISIL has been rejected as blasphemous by the majority of Islamists.

==Terminology==
Originally the term &quot;Islamism&quot; was simply used to mean the religion of Islam, not an ideology or movement. It first appeared in the English language as &quot;Islamismus&quot; in 1696, and as &quot;Islamism&quot; in 1712. The term appears in the U.S. Supreme Court decision in &quot;In Re Ross&quot; (1891). By the turn of the twentieth century the shorter and purely Arabic term &quot;Islam&quot; had begun to displace it, and by 1938, when Orientalist scholars completed &quot;The Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot;, &quot;Islamism&quot; seems to have virtually disappeared from English usage. The term remained &quot;practically absent from the vocabulary&quot; of scholars, writers or journalists until the Iranian Islamic Revolution of 1978–79, which brought Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s concept of &quot;Islamic government&quot; to Iran.

This new usage appeared without taking into consideration how the term &quot;Islamist&quot; (m. sing.: &quot;Islami&quot;, pl. nom/acc: &quot;Islamiyyun&quot;, gen. &quot;Islamiyyin;&quot; f. sing/pl: &quot;Islamiyyah&quot;) was already being used in traditional Arabic scholarship in a theological sense as in relating to the religion of Islam, not a political ideology. In heresiographical, theological and historical works, such as al-Ash&#x27;ari&#x27;s well-known encyclopaedia &quot;Maqālāt al-Islāmiyyīn&quot; (&quot;The Opinions of The Islamists&quot;), an Islamist refers to any person who attributes himself to Islam without affirming nor negating that attribution. If used consistently, it is for impartiality, but if used in reference to a certain person or group in particular without others, it implies that the author is either unsure whether to affirm or negate their attribution to Islam, or trying to insinuate his disapproval of the attribution without controversy. In contrast, referring to a person as a Muslim or a Kafir implies an explicit affirmation or a negation of that person&#x27;s attribution to Islam. To evade the problem resulting from the confusion between the Western and Arabic usage of the term Islamist, Arab journalists invented the term &quot;Islamawi&quot; (&quot;Islamian&quot;) instead of &quot;Islami&quot; (&quot;Islamist&quot;) in reference to the political movement, though this term is sometimes criticized as grammatically incorrect.

===Definitions===
Islamism has been defined as:
* &quot;the belief that Islam should guide social and political as well as personal life&quot; (Sheri Berman);
* the belief that Islam should influence political systems (Cambridge English Dictionary);
* &quot;the [Islamic] ideology that guides society as a whole and that [teaches] law must be in conformity with the Islamic sharia&quot;, (W. E. Shepard);
* a combination of two pre-existing trends 
** movements to revive the faith, weakened by &quot;foreign influence, political opportunism, moral laxity, and the forgetting of sacred texts&quot;;
** the more recent movement against imperialism/colonialism, morphed into a more simple anti-Westernism; formerly embraced by leftists and nationalists but whose supporters have turned to Islam.
* a form of &quot;religionized politics&quot; and an instance of religious fundamentalism that imagines an Islamic community claiming global hegemony for its values (Bassam Tibi);
* &quot;political movement that favors reordering government and society in accordance with laws prescribed by Islam&quot; (Associated Press stylebook);
* a political ideology which seeks to enforce Islamic precepts and norms as generally applicable rules for people&#x27;s conduct; and whose adherents seek a state based on Islamic values and laws (sharia) and rejecting Western guiding principles, such as freedom of opinion, freedom of the press, artistic freedom and freedom of religion (Thomas Volk);
* a broad set of political ideologies that use and draw inspiration from Islamic symbols and traditions in pursuit of a sociopolitical objective—also called &quot;political Islam&quot; (Britannica);
* &quot;[...] [has become shorthand for] &#x27;Muslims we don&#x27;t like.&#x27;&quot; (Council on American–Islamic Relations—in complaint about AP&#x27;s earlier definition of Islamist); 
** In &quot;Western popular discourse generally uses &#x27;Islamism&#x27; when discussing the negative or &#x27;that-which-is-bad&#x27; in Muslim communities. The signifier, &#x27;Islam,&#x27; on the other hand, is reserved for the positive or neutral.&quot; (David Belt).
* a movement so broad and flexible it reaches out to &quot;everything to everyone&quot; in Islam, making it &quot;unsustainable&quot; (Tarek Osman);
** an alternative social provider to the poor masses;
** an angry platform for the disillusioned young;
** a loud trumpet-call announcing &quot;a return to the pure religion&quot; to those seeking an identity;
** a &quot;progressive, moderate religious platform&quot; for the affluent and liberal;
** &quot;[...] and at the extremes, a violent vehicle for rejectionists and radicals.
* an Islamic &quot;movement that seeks cultural differentiation from the West and reconnection with the pre-colonial symbolic universe&quot;, (François Burgat);
* &quot;the active assertion and promotion of beliefs, prescriptions, laws or policies that are held to be Islamic in character,&quot; (International Crisis Group);

* &quot;All who seek to Islamize their environment, whether in relation to their lives in society, their family circumstances, or the workplace ...&quot;, (Olivier Roy).

===Relationship between Islam and Islamism===
Islamists simply believe that their movement is either a corrected version or a revival of Islam, but others believe that Islamism is a modern deviation from Islam which should either be denounced or dismissed.

A writer for the International Crisis Group maintains that &quot;the conception of &#x27;political Islam&#x27;&quot; is a creation of Americans to explain the Iranian Islamic Revolution, ignoring the fact that (according to the writer) Islam is by definition political. In fact it is quietist/non-political Islam, not Islamism, that requires explanation, which the author gives—calling it an historical fluke of the &quot;short-lived era of the heyday of secular Arab nationalism between 1945 and 1970&quot;.

Hayri Abaza argues that the failure to distinguish Islam from Islamism leads many in the West to equate the two; they think that by supporting illiberal Islamic (Islamist) regimes, they are being respectful of Islam, to the detriment of those who seek to separate religion from politics.

Another source distinguishes Islamist from Islam by emphasizing the fact that Islam &quot;refers to a religion and culture in existence over a millennium&quot;, whereas Islamism &quot;is a political/religious phenomenon linked to the great events of the 20th century&quot;. Islamists have, at least at times, defined themselves as &quot;Islamiyyoun/Islamists&quot; to differentiate themselves from &quot;Muslimun/Muslims&quot;. Daniel Pipes describes Islamism as a modern ideology that owes more to European utopian political ideologies and &quot;isms&quot; than to the traditional Islamic religion.

According to Salman Sayyid, &quot;Islamism is not a replacement of Islam akin to the way it could be argued that communism and fascism are secularized substitutes for Christianity.&quot; Rather, it is &quot;a constellation of political projects that seek to position Islam in the centre of any social order&quot;.

==Ideology==
===Islamic revival===
The modern revival of Islamic devotion and the attraction to things Islamic can be traced to several events.

By the end of World War I, most Muslim states were seen to be dominated by the Christian-leaning Western states. Explanations offered were: that the claims of Islam were false and the Christian or post-Christian West had finally come up with another system that was superior; or Islam had failed through not being true to itself. The second explanation being preferred by Muslims, a redoubling of faith and devotion by the faithful was called for to reverse this tide.

The connection between the lack of an Islamic spirit and the lack of victory was underscored by the disastrous defeat of Arab nationalist-led armies fighting Israel under the slogan &quot;Land, Sea and Air&quot; in the 1967 Six-Day War, compared to the (perceived) near-victory of the Yom Kippur War six years later. In that war the military&#x27;s slogan was &quot;God is Great&quot;.

Along with the Yom Kippur War came the Arab oil embargo where the (Muslim) Persian Gulf oil-producing states&#x27; dramatic decision to cut back on production and quadruple the price of oil, made the terms oil, Arabs and Islam synonymous with power throughout the world, and especially in the Muslim world&#x27;s public imagination. Many Muslims believe as Saudi Prince Saud al Faisal did that the hundreds of billions of dollars in wealth obtained from the Persian Gulf&#x27;s huge oil deposits were nothing less than a gift from God to the Islamic faithful.

As the Islamic revival gained momentum, governments such as Egypt&#x27;s, which had previously repressed (and was still continuing to repress) Islamists, joined the bandwagon. They banned alcohol and flooded the airwaves with religious programming, giving the movement even more exposure.

=== Restoration of the Caliphate ===
The abolition of the Ottoman Sultanate by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey on 1 November 1922 ended the Ottoman Empire, which had lasted since 1299. On 11 November 1922, at the Conference of Lausanne, the sovereignty of the Grand National Assembly exercised by the Government in Angora (now Ankara) over Turkey was recognized. The last sultan, Mehmed VI, departed the Ottoman capital, Constantinople (now Istanbul), on 17 November 1922. The legal position was solidified with the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne on 24 July 1923. In March 1924, the Caliphate was abolished legally by the Turkish National Assembly, marking the end of Ottoman influence. This shocked the Sunni clerical world, and many felt the need to present Islam not as a traditional religion but as an innovative socio-political ideology of a modern nation-state.

The reaction to new realities of the modern world gave birth to Islamist ideologues like Rashid Rida and Abul A&#x27;la Maududi and organizations such as the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Majlis-e-Ahrar-ul-Islam in India. Rashid Rida, a prominent Syrian-born Salafi theologian based in Egypt, was known as a revivalist of Hadith studies in Sunni seminaries and a pioneering theoretician of Islamism in the modern age. During 1922–1923, Rida published a series of articles in seminal &quot;Al-Manar&quot; magazine titled &quot;The Caliphate or the Supreme Imamate&quot;. In this highly influential treatise, Rida advocates for the restoration of Caliphate guided by Islamic jurists and proposes gradualist measures of education, reformation and purification through the efforts of &quot;Salafiyya&quot; reform movements across the globe.

Sayyid Rashid Rida had visited India in 1912 and was impressed by the Deoband and Nadwatul Ulama seminaries. These seminaries carried the legacy of Sayyid Ahmad Shahid and his pre-modern Islamic emirate. In British India, the Khilafat movement (1919–24) following World War I led by Shaukat Ali, Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar, Hakim Ajmal Khan and Maulana Azad came to exemplify South Asian Muslims&#x27; aspirations for Caliphate.

===Anti-Westernization===
Muslim alienation from Western ways, including its political ways.
* The memory in Muslim societies of the many centuries of &quot;cultural and institutional success&quot; of Islamic civilization that have created an &quot;intense resistance to an alternative &#x27;civilizational order&#x27;&quot;, such as Western civilization.
* The proximity of the core of the Muslim world to Europe and Christendom where it first conquered and then was conquered. Iberia in the eighth century, the Crusades which began in the eleventh century, then for centuries the Ottoman Empire, were all fields of war between Europe and Islam.

:In the words of Bernard Lewis:
:For almost a thousand years, from the first Moorish landing in Spain to the second Turkish siege of Vienna, Europe was under constant threat from Islam. In the early centuries it was a double threat—not only of invasion and conquest, but also of conversion and assimilation. All but the easternmost provinces of the Islamic realm had been taken from Christian rulers, and the vast majority of the first Muslims west of Iran and Arabia were converts from Christianity ... Their loss was sorely felt and it heightened the fear that a similar fate was in store for Europe.

For Islamists, the primary threat of the West is cultural rather than political or economic. Cultural dependency robs one of faith and identity and thus destroys Islam and the Islamic community (&quot;ummah&quot;) far more effectively than political rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haddad/Esposito1&quot;&gt;Haddad/Esposito p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strength of identity politics ===
Islamism is described by Graham E. Fuller as part of identity politics, specifically the religiously oriented nationalism that emerged in the Third World in the 1970s: &quot;resurgent Hinduism in India, Religious Zionism in Israel, militant Buddhism in Sri Lanka, resurgent Sikh nationalism in the Punjab, &#x27;Liberation Theology&#x27; of Catholicism in Latin America, and Islamism in the Muslim world.&quot;

=== Anti-communist stances ===

By the late 1960s, non-Soviet Muslim-majority countries had won their independence and they tended to fall into one of the two cold-war blocs – with &quot;Nasser&#x27;s Egypt, Baathist Syria and Iraq, Muammar el-Qaddafi&#x27;s Libya, Algeria under Ahmed Ben Bella and Houari Boumedienne, Southern Yemen, and Sukarno&#x27;s Indonesia&quot; aligned with Moscow. Aware of the close attachment of the population with Islam, &quot;school books of the 1960s in these countries &quot;went out of their way to impress upon children that socialism was simply Islam properly understood.&quot;
Olivier Roy writes that the &quot;failure of the &#x27;Arab socialist&#x27; model ... left room for new protest ideologies to emerge in deconstructed societies ...&quot; Gilles Kepel notes that when a collapse in oil prices led to widespread violent and destructive rioting by the urban poor in Algeria in 1988, what might have appeared to be a natural opening for the left, was instead the beginning of major victories for the Islamist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) party. The reason being the corruption and economic malfunction of the policies of the Third World socialist ruling party (FNL) had &quot;largely discredited&quot; the &quot;vocabulary of socialism&quot;.
In the post-colonial era, many Muslim-majority states such as Indonesia, Egypt, Syria, and Iraq, were ruled by authoritarian regimes which were often continuously dominated by the same individuals or their cadres for decades. Simultaneously, the military played a significant part in the government decisions in many of these states (the outsized role played by the military could be seen also in democratic Turkey).

The authoritarian regimes, backed by military support, took extra measures to silence leftist opposition forces, often with the help of foreign powers. Silencing of leftist opposition deprived the masses a channel to express their economic grievances and frustration toward the lack of democratic processes. As a result, in the post-Cold War era, civil society-based Islamist movements such as the Muslim Brotherhood were the only organizations capable to provide avenues of protest.

The dynamic was repeated after the states had gone through a democratic transition. In Indonesia, some secular political parties have contributed to the enactment of religious bylaws to counter the popularity of Islamist oppositions. In Egypt, during the short period of the democratic experiment, Muslim Brotherhood seized the momentum by being the most cohesive political movement among the opposition.

==Influence==

Few observers contest the immense influence of Islamism within the Muslim world. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, political movements based on the liberal ideology of free expression and democratic rule have led the opposition in other parts of the world such as Latin America, Eastern Europe and many parts of Asia; however &quot;the simple fact is that political Islam currently reigns [circa 2002-3] as the most powerful ideological force across the Muslim world today&quot;.

The strength of Islamism also draws from the strength of religiosity in general in the Muslim world. Compared to other societies around the globe, &quot;[w]hat is striking about the Islamic world is that ... it seems to have been the least penetrated by irreligion&quot;. Where other peoples may look to the physical or social sciences for answers in areas which their ancestors regarded as best left to scripture, in the Muslim world, religion has become more encompassing, not less, as &quot;in the last few decades, it has been the fundamentalists who have increasingly represented the cutting edge&quot; of Muslim culture.

Writing in 2009, German journalist Sonja Zekri described Islamists in Egypt and other Muslim countries as &quot;extremely influential. ... They determine how one dresses, what one eats. In these areas, they are incredibly successful. ... Even if the Islamists never come to power, they have transformed their countries.&quot; Political Islamists were described as &quot;competing in the democratic public square in places like Turkey, Tunisia, Malaysia and Indonesia&quot;.

==Types==
Islamism is not a united movement and takes different forms and spans a wide range of strategies and tactics towards the powers in place—&quot;destruction, opposition, collaboration, indifference&quot;—not because (or not just because) of differences of opinions, but because it varies as circumstances change.p. 54

Moderate and reformist Islamists who accept and work within the democratic process include parties like the Tunisian Ennahda Movement. Some Islamists can be religious populists or far-right. 
Jamaat-e-Islami of Pakistan is basically a socio-political and &quot;vanguard party&quot; working with in Pakistan&#x27;s Democratic political process, but has also gained political influence through military coup d&#x27;états in the past. Other Islamist groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine claim to participate in the democratic and political process as well as armed attacks by their powerful paramilitary wings. Jihadist organizations like al-Qaeda and the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and groups such as the Taliban, entirely reject democracy, seeing it as a form of &quot;kufr&quot; (disbelief) calling for offensive jihad on a religious basis.

Another major division within Islamism is between what Graham E. Fuller has described as the conservative &quot;guardians of the tradition&quot; (Salafis, such as those in the Wahhabi movement) and the revolutionary &quot;vanguard of change and Islamic reform&quot; centered around the Muslim Brotherhood. Olivier Roy argues that &quot;Sunni pan-Islamism underwent a remarkable shift in the second half of the 20th century&quot; when the Muslim Brotherhood movement and its focus on Islamisation of pan-Arabism was eclipsed by the Salafi movement with its emphasis on &quot;sharia rather than the building of Islamic institutions&quot;. Following the Arab Spring (starting in 2011), Roy has described Islamism as &quot;increasingly interdependent&quot; with democracy in much of the Arab Muslim world, such that &quot;neither can now survive without the other.&quot; While Islamist political culture itself may not be democratic, Islamists need democratic elections to maintain their legitimacy. At the same time, their popularity is such that no government can call itself democratic that excludes mainstream Islamist groups.

Arguing distinctions between &quot;radical/moderate&quot; or &quot;violent/peaceful&quot; Islamism were &quot;simplistic&quot;, circa 2017, 
scholar Morten Valbjørn put forth these &quot;much more sophisticated typologies&quot; of Islamism:
===Moderate and reformist Islamism===
Throughout the 80s and 90s, major moderate Islamist movements such as the Muslim Brotherhood and the Ennahda were excluded from democratic political participation. At least in part for that reason, Islamists attempted to overthrow the government in the Algerian Civil War (1991–2002) and waged a terror campaign in Egypt in the 90s. These attempts were crushed and in the 21st century, Islamists turned increasingly to non-violent methods, and &quot;moderate Islamists&quot; now make up the majority of the contemporary Islamist movements.

Among some Islamists, Democracy has been harmonized with Islam by means of &quot;Shura&quot; (consultation). The tradition of consultation by the ruler being considered Sunnah of the prophet Muhammad, (&quot;Majlis-ash-Shura&quot; being a common name for legislative bodies in Islamic countries).

Among the varying goals, strategies, and outcomes of &quot;moderate Islamist movements&quot; are a formal abandonment of their original vision of implementing &quot;sharia&quot; (also termed Post-Islamism) – done by the Ennahda Movement of Tunisia, and Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) of Indonesia. Others, such as the National Congress of Sudan, have implemented the sharia with support from wealthy, conservative states (primarily Saudi Arabia).

According to one theory – &quot;inclusion-moderation&quot;—the interdependence of political outcome with strategy means that the more moderate the Islamists become, the more likely they are to be politically included (or unsuppressed); and the more accommodating the government is, the less &quot;extreme&quot; Islamists become. A prototype of harmonizing Islamist principles within the modern state framework was the &quot;Turkish model&quot;, based on the apparent success of the rule of the Turkish Justice and Development Party (AKP) led by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Turkish model, however, came &quot;unstuck&quot; after a purge and violations of democratic principles by the Erdoğan regime. Critics of the concept – which include both Islamists who reject democracy and anti-Islamists – hold that Islamist aspirations are fundamentally incompatible with the democratic principles.

===Salafi movement===

The contemporary Salafi movement is sometimes described as a variety of Islamism and sometimes as a different school of Islam, such as a &quot;phase between fundamentalism and Islamism&quot;.
Originally a reformist movement of Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, Muhammad Abdul, and Rashid Rida, that rejected maraboutism (Sufism), the established schools of fiqh, and demanded individual interpretation (&quot;ijtihad&quot;) of the Quran and Sunnah; it evolved into a movement embracing the conservative doctrines of the medieval Hanbali theologian Ibn Taymiyyah. While all salafi believe Islam covers every aspect of life, that sharia law must be implemented completely and that the Caliphate must be recreated to rule the Muslim world, they differ in strategies and priorities, which generally fall into three groups: 
* The &quot;quietist&quot; school advocates Islamization through preaching, educating the masses on sharia and &quot;purification&quot; of religious practices and ignoring government. 
* Activist (or &quot;haraki&quot;) Salafi activism encourages political participation—opposing government loans with interest or normalization of relations with Israel, etc. As of 2013, this school makes up the majority of Salafism. Salafist political parties in the Muslim world include the Al-Nour Party of Egypt, the Al-Islah Party of Yemen, and the Al-Asalah Society of Bahrain.
* Salafi jihadism, (see below) is inspired by the ideology of Sayyid Qutb (Qutbism, see below), and sees secular institutions as an enemy of Islam, advocating revolution to pave the way for the establishment of a new Caliphate.

===Militant Islamism/Jihadism===

====Qutbism====
Qutbism refers to the Jihadist ideology formulated by Sayyid Qutb, (an influential figure of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt during the 50s and 60s). Qutbism argued that not only was sharia essential for Islam, but that since it was not in force, Islam did not really exist in the Muslim world, which was in &quot;Jahiliyya&quot; (the state of pre-Islamic ignorance). To remedy this situation he urged a two-pronged attack of 1) preaching to convert, and 2) jihad to forcibly eliminate the &quot;structures&quot; of &quot;Jahiliyya&quot;. Defensive jihad against &quot;Jahiliyya&quot; Muslim governments would not be enough. &quot;Truth and falsehood cannot coexist on this earth&quot;, so offensive Jihad was needed to eliminate &quot;Jahiliyya&quot; not only from the Islamic homeland but from the face of the Earth. In addition, vigilance against Western and Jewish conspiracies against Islam would-be needed.

Although Qutb was executed before he could fully spell out his ideology, his ideas were disseminated and expanded on by the later generations, among them Abdullah Yusuf Azzam and Ayman Al-Zawahiri, who was a student of Qutb&#x27;s brother Muhammad Qutb and later became a mentor of Osama bin Laden. Al-Zawahiri helped to pass on stories of &quot;the purity of Qutb&#x27;s character&quot; and persecution he suffered, and played an extensive role in the normalization of offensive Jihad among followers of Qutb.

====Salafi Jihadism====
Salafi Jihadism or revolutionary Salafism emerged prominent during the 80s when Osama bin Laden and thousands of other militant Muslims came from around the Muslim world to unite against the Soviet Union after it invaded Afghanistan. Local Afghan Muslims (mujahideen) had declared jihad against the Soviets and were aided with financial, logistical and military support by Saudi Arabia and the United States, but after Soviet forces left Afghanistan, this funding and interest by America and Saudi ceased. The international volunteers, (originally organized by Abdullah Azzam), were triumphant in victory, away from the moderating influence of home and family, among the 
radicalized influence of other militants. Wanting to capitalize on financial, logistical and military network that had been developed they sought to continue waging jihad elsewhere. Their new targets, however, included the United States—funder of the mujahideen but &quot;perceived as the greatest enemy of the faith&quot;; and governments of majority-Muslims countries—perceived of as apostates from Islam.

Salafist-jihadist ideology combined the literal and traditional interpretations of scripture of Salafists, with the promotion and fighting of jihad against military and civilian targets in the pursuit of the establishment of an Islamic state and eventually a new Caliphate.

Other characteristics of the movement include the formal process of taking &quot;bay&#x27;ah&quot; (oath of allegiance) to the leader (&quot;amir&quot;), which is inspired by Hadiths and early Muslim practice and included in Wahhabi teaching; and the concepts of &quot;near enemy&quot; (governments of majority-Muslims countries) and &quot;far enemy&quot; (United States and other Western countries). (The term &quot;near enemy&quot; was coined by Mohammed Abdul-Salam Farag who led the assassination of Anwar al-Sadat with Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) in 1981.) The &quot;far enemy&quot; was introduced and formally declared under attack by al-Qaeda in 1996.

The ideology saw its rise during the 90s when the Muslim world experienced numerous geopolitical crisis, notably the Algerian Civil War (1991–2002), Bosnian War (1992–1995), and the First Chechen War (1994–1996). Within these conflicts, political Islam often acted as a mobilizing factor for the local belligerents, who demanded financial, logistical and military support from al-Qaeda, in the exchange for active proliferation of the ideology. After the 1998 bombings of US embassies, September 11 attacks (2001), the US-led invasion of Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003), Salafi Jihadism lost its momentum, being devastated by the US counterterrorism operations, culminating in bin Laden&#x27;s death in 2011. After the Arab Spring (2011) and subsequent Syrian civil war (2011–present), the remnants of al-Qaeda franchise in Iraq restored their capacity, rapidly developing into the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, spreading its influence throughout the conflict zones of MENA region and the globe. Salafi Jihadism makes up a minority of the contemporary Islamist movements.

===Shi&#x27;i Islamism===
Although most of the research and reporting about Islamism or political Islam has been focused on Sunni Islamist movements,
Islamism exists in Twelver Shia Islam (the second largest branch of Islam that makes up approximately 10% of all Muslims.). Islamist Shi&#x27;ism, also known as Shi&#x27;i Islamism, is primarily but not exclusively
 associated with the thought of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, with the Islamist Revolution he led, Islamic Republic of Iran that he founded, and the religious-political activities and resources of the republic.

Compared to the &quot;Types&quot; of Islamism mentioned above, Khomeinism differs from Wahhabism (which does not consider Shi&#x27;ism truly Islamic), Salafism (both orthodox or Jihadi—Shi&#x27;a do not consider some of the most prominent salaf worthy of emulation), reformist Islamism (the Islamic Republic executed more than 3,400 political dissidents between June 1981 and March 1982 in the process of consolidating power).

Khomeini and his followers helped translate the works of Maududi and Qutb into Persian and were influenced by them, but their views differed from them and other Sunni Islamists in being &quot;more leftist and more clerical&quot;: 
*more leftist in the propaganda campaign leading up to the revolution, emphasizing exploitation of the poor by the rich and of Muslims by imperialism; 
*more clerical in the new post-revolutionary state, where clerics were in control of the levers of power (the Supreme Leader, Guardian Council, etc., under the concept of Velayat-e Faqih.).

Khomeini was a &quot;radical&quot; Islamist, like Qutb and unlike Maudidi. He believed that foreigners, Jews and their agents were conspiring &quot;to keep us backward, to keep us in our present miserable state&quot;. Those who call themselves Muslims but were secular and Westernizing, were not just corrupt or misguided, but &quot;agents&quot; of the Western governments, helping to &quot;plunder&quot; Muslim lands as part of a long-term conspiracy against Islam. Only the rule of an Islamic jurist, administering Sharia law, stood between this abomination and justice, and could not wait for peaceful, gradual transition. It is the duty of Muslims to &quot;destroy&quot; &quot;all traces&quot; of any other sort of government other than true Islamic governance because these are &quot;systems of unbelief&quot;. &quot;Troublesome&quot; groups that cause &quot;corruption in Muslim society,&quot; and damage &quot;Islam and the Islamic state&quot; are to be eliminated just as the Prophet Muhammad eliminated the Jews of Bani Qurayza. Islamic revolution to install &quot;the form of government willed by Islam&quot; will not end with one Islamic state in Iran. Once this government comes &quot;into being, none of the governments now existing in the world&quot; will &quot;be able to resist it;&quot; they will &quot;all capitulate&quot;.

====Ruling Islamic Jurist====
Khomeini&#x27;s form of Islamism was particularly unique in the world because it completely swept the old regime away, created a new regime with a new constitution, new institutions and a new concept of governance (the &quot;Velayat-e Faqih&quot;). A historical event, it changed militant Islam from a topic of limited impact and interest to a topic that few either inside or outside the Muslim world were unaware of. As he originally described it in lectures to his students, the system of &quot;Islamic Government&quot; was one where the leading Islamic jurist would enforce sharia law—law which &quot;has absolute authority over all individuals and the Islamic government&quot;. The jurist would not be elected, and no legislature would be needed since divine law called for rule by jurist and &quot;there is not a single topic in human life for which Islam has not provided instruction and established a norm&quot;. Without this system, injustice, corruption, waste, exploitation and sin would reign, and Islam would decay. This plan was disclosed to his students and the religious community but not widely publicized. The constitution of the Islamic Republic written after the revolution did include a legislature and president, but supervising the entire government was a &quot;Supreme Leader&quot;/guardian jurist.

Islamist Shi&#x27;ism has been crucial to the development of worldwide Islamism, because the Iranian regime attempted to export its revolution. Although, the Islamist ideology was originally imported from Muslim Brotherhood, Iranian relations between the Muslim Brotherhood and Islamic Republic of Iran deteriorated due to its involvement in the Syrian civil war. However, the majority Usuli Shi&#x27;ism rejects the idea of an Islamist State in the period of Occultation of the Hidden Imam.

====Shi&#x27;ism and Iran====
Twelver Shia Muslim live mainly in a half dozen or so countries scattered around the Middle East and South Asia.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has become &quot;the de facto leader&quot; of the Shi&#x27;i world by virtue of being the largest Shia-majority state, having a long history of national cohesion and Shia-rule, being the site of the first and &quot;only true&quot; Islamist revolution (see History section below), and having the financial resources of a major petroleum exporter. Iran&#x27;s influence has spread into a cultural-geographic area of &quot;Irano-Arab Shiism&quot;, establishing Iranian regional power, supporting &quot;Shia militias and parties beyond its borders&quot;, intertwining assistance to fellow Shi&#x27;a with &quot;Iranization&quot; of them.

Shi&#x27;i Islamism in Iran has been influenced by the Sunni Islamists and their organizations, particularly Sayyid Rashid Rida, Hassan al-Banna (founder of the Muslim Brotherhood organization), Sayyid Qutb, Abul A&#x27;la Maududi, 
but has also been described as &quot;distinct&quot; from Sunni Muslim Brotherhood Islamism, &quot;more leftist and more clerical&quot;, with its own historical influencers:

====Historical figures====
*Sheikh Fazlullah Nouri, a cleric of the Qajar dynasty court and the leader of the anti-constitutionalists during the Persian Constitutional Revolution of 1905–1911, who declared the new constitution contrary to sharia law.
* Navvab Safavi, a religious student who founded the &quot;Fada&#x27;iyan-e Islam&quot;, seeking to purify Islam in Iran by killing off &#x27;corrupting individuals&#x27;, i.e. certain leading intellectual and political figures (including both a former and current prime minister). After the group was crushed by the government, surviving members reportedly chose Ayatollah Khomeini as a new spiritual leader.
* Ali Shariati, a non-cleric &quot;socialist Shi&#x27;i&quot; who absorbed Marxist ideas in France and had considerable influence on young Iranians through his preaching that Imam Hussein was not just a holy figure but the original oppressed one (&quot;muzloun&quot;), and his killer, the Sunni Umayyad Caliphate, the &quot;analog&quot; of the modern Iranian people&#x27;s &quot;oppression by the shah&quot;.
* Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, a Shi&#x27;i Islamic scholar in Iraq who critiqued Marxism, socialism and capitalism and helped lead Shi&#x27;i opposition to Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Baath regime before being executed by them.
* Mahmoud Taleghani, an ayatollah and contemporary of Khomeini, was more leftist, more tolerant and more sympathetic to democracy, but less influential, though he still had a substantial following. Was deposed from revolutionary leadership after warning of a &quot;return to despotism&quot; by the revolutionary leadership.

==Explanations for the growth and popularity of Islamism ==
===Sociological, economic and political ===
Some Western political scientists see the unchanging socio-economic condition in the Muslim world as a major factor. Olivier Roy believes &quot;the socioeconomic realities that sustained the Islamist wave are still here and are not going to change: poverty, uprootedness, crises in values and identities, the decay of the educational systems, the North-South opposition, and the problem of immigrant integration into the host societies&quot;.

====Charitable work====
Islamist movements such as the Muslim Brotherhood, &quot;are well known for providing shelters, educational assistance, free or low cost medical clinics, housing assistance to students from out of town, student advisory groups, facilitation of inexpensive mass marriage ceremonies to avoid prohibitively costly dowry demands, legal assistance, sports facilities, and women&#x27;s groups.&quot; All this compares very favourably against incompetent, inefficient, or neglectful governments whose commitment to social justice is limited to rhetoric.

====Economic stagnation====
The Arab world—the original heart of the Muslim world—has been afflicted with economic stagnation. For example, it has been estimated that in the mid-1990s the exports of Finland, a country of five million, exceeded those of the entire Arab world of 260 million, excluding oil revenue.

====Sociology of rural migration==== 
Demographic transition (caused by the gap in time between the lowering of death rates from medical advances and the lowering of fertility rates), leads to population growth beyond the ability of housing, employment, public transit, sewer and water to provide. Combined with economic stagnation, urban agglomerations have been created in Cairo, Istanbul, Tehran, Karachi, Dhaka, and Jakarta, each with well over 12 million citizens, millions of them young and unemployed or underemployed. Such a demographic, alienated from the westernized ways of the urban elite, but uprooted from the comforts and more passive traditions of the villages they came from, is understandably favourably disposed to an Islamic system promising a better world—an ideology providing an &quot;emotionally familiar basis for group identity, solidarity, and exclusion; an acceptable basis for legitimacy and authority; an immediately intelligible formulation of principles for both a critique of the present and a program for the future.&quot; One American anthropologist in Iran in the early 1970s (before the revolution), when comparing a &quot;stable village with a new urban slum&quot;, discovered that where &quot;the villagers took religion with a grain of salt and even ridiculed visiting preachers&quot;, the slum dwellers—all recently dispossessed peasants – &quot;used religion as a substitute for their lost communities, oriented social life around the mosque, and accepted with zeal the teachings of the local mullah&quot;.

Gilles Kepel also notes that Islamist uprisings in Iran and Algeria, though a decade apart, coincided with the large numbers of youth who were &quot;the first generation taught en masse to read and write and had been separated from their own rural, illiterate progenitors by a cultural gulf that radical Islamist ideology could exploit&quot;. Their &quot;rural, illiterate&quot; parents were too settled in tradition to be interested in Islamism and their children &quot;more likely to call into question the utopian dreams of the 1970s generation&quot;, but they embraced revolutionary political Islam. Olivier Roy also asserts &quot;it is not by chance that the Iranian Revolution took place the very year the proportion of city-dweller in Iran passed the 50% mark&quot;. and offers statistics in support for other countries (in 1990 Algeria, housing was so crowded that there was an average of eight inhabitants to a room, and 80% of youth aged 16 to 29 still lived with their parents). &quot;The old clan or ethnic solidarities, the clout of the elders, and family control are fading little by little in the face of changes in the social structure ...&quot;
This theory implies that a decline in illiteracy and rural emigration will mean a decline in Islamism.

==Geopolitics==
===State-sponsorship===
====Saudi Arabia====
Starting in the mid-1970s the Islamic resurgence was funded by an abundance of money from Saudi Arabian oil exports. The tens of billions of dollars in &quot;petro-Islam&quot; largesse obtained from the recently heightened price of oil funded an estimated &quot;90% of the expenses of the entire faith.&quot;

Throughout the Muslim world, religious institutions for people both young and old, from children&#x27;s madrassas to high-level scholarships received Saudi funding,
&quot;books, scholarships, fellowships, and mosques&quot; (for example, &quot;more than 1500 mosques were built and paid for with money obtained from public Saudi funds over the last 50 years&quot;), along with training in the Kingdom for the preachers and teachers who went on to teach and work at these universities, schools, mosques, etc.

The funding was also used to reward journalists and academics who followed the Saudis&#x27; strict interpretation of Islam; and satellite campuses were built around Egypt for Al-Azhar University, the world&#x27;s oldest and most influential Islamic university.

The interpretation of Islam promoted by this funding was the strict, conservative Saudi-based Wahhabism or Salafism. In its harshest form it preached that Muslims should not only &quot;always oppose&quot; infidels &quot;in every way,&quot; but &quot;hate them for their religion ... for Allah&#x27;s sake,&quot; that democracy &quot;is responsible for all the horrible wars of the 20th century,&quot; that Shia and other non-Wahhabi Muslims were infidels, etc. While this effort has by no means converted all, or even most Muslims to the Wahhabist interpretation of Islam, it has done much to overwhelm more moderate local interpretations, and has set the Saudi-interpretation of Islam as the &quot;gold standard&quot; of religion in minds of some or many Muslims.

==== Qatar ====
Though the much smaller Qatar could not provide the same level of funding as Saudi Arabia, it was also a petroleum exporter and also sponsored Islamist groups. Qatar backed the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt even after the 2013 overthrow of the MB regime of Mohamed Morsi, with Qatar ruler Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani denouncing the coup. In June 2016, Mohamed Morsi was sentenced to life for passing state secrets to Qatar.

Qatar has also backed Islamist factions in Libya, Syria and Yemen.
In Libya, Qatar supported Islamists with tens of millions of dollars in aid, military training and &quot;more than 20,000 tons of weapons&quot;, both before and after the 2011 fall of Muammar Gaddafi.

Hamas, in Palestine, has received considerable financial support as well as diplomatic help.

====Western support of Islamism during the Cold War====

During the Cold War, particularly during the 1950s, during the 1960s, and during most of the 1970s, the U.S. and other countries in the Western Bloc occasionally attempted to take advantage of the rise of Islamic religiousity by directing it against secular leftist/communist/nationalist insurgents/adversaries, particularly against the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc states, whose ideology was not just secular but anti-religious.

In 1957, U.S. President Eisenhower and senior U.S. foreign policy officials, agreed on a policy of using the communists&#x27; lack of religion against them: &quot;We should do everything possible to stress the &#x27;holy war&#x27; aspect&quot; that has currency in the Middle East.

During the 1970s and sometimes later, this aid sometimes went to fledgling Islamists and Islamist groups that later came to be seen as dangerous enemies. The US spent billions of dollars to aid the mujahideen Muslim Afghanistan enemies of the Soviet Union, and non-Afghan veterans of the war (such as Osama bin Laden) returned home with their prestige, &quot;experience, ideology, and weapons&quot;, and had considerable impact.

Although it is a strong opponent of Israel&#x27;s existence, Hamas, officially founded in 1987, traces its origins back to institutions and clerics which were supported by Israel in the 1970s and 1980s. Israel tolerated and supported Islamist movements in Gaza, with figures like Ahmed Yassin, as Israel perceived them preferable to the secular and then more powerful al-Fatah with the PLO.

Egyptian President Anwar Sadatwhose policies included opening Egypt to Western investment (&quot;infitah&quot;); transferring Egypt&#x27;s allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States; and making peace with Israel—released Islamists from prison and welcomed home exiles in tacit exchange for political support in his struggle against leftists. His &quot;encouraging of the emergence of the Islamist movement&quot; was said to have been &quot;imitated by many other Muslim leaders in the years that followed.&quot; This &quot;gentlemen&#x27;s agreement&quot; between Sadat and Islamists broke down in 1975 but not before Islamists came to completely dominate university student unions. Sadat was later assassinated and a formidable insurgency was formed in Egypt in the 1990s. The French government has also been reported to have promoted Islamist preachers &quot;in the hope of channeling Muslim energies into zones of piety and charity.&quot;

==History==
Olivier Roy dates the beginning of the Islamism movement &quot;more or less in 1940&quot;, and its development proceeding &quot;over half a century&quot;.

===Preceding movements===
Some Islamic revivalist movements and leaders which pre-date Islamism but share some characteristics with it include:
* Ahmad Sirhindi (~1564–1624) was largely responsible for the purification, reassertion and revival of conservative orthodox Sunni Islam in India during Islam&#x27;s second millennium.
* Ibn Taymiyyah, a Syrian Islamic jurist during the 13th and 14th centuries argued against the practices such as the celebration of Muhammad&#x27;s birthday, and seeking assistance at the grave of the Prophet.
* Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab, the founder of Wahhabism, advocated doing away with the later religious accretions like worship at graves.
* Shah Waliullah of India was a forerunner of reformist Islamists like Muhammad Abduh, Muhammad Iqbal and Muhammad Asad in his belief that there was &quot;a constant need for new ijtihad as the Muslim community progressed.
* Sayyid Ahmad Barelvi was a disciple and successor of Shah Waliullah&#x27;s son who led a jihadist movement and attempted to create an Islamic state based on the enforcement of Islamic law.
* the Deobandi movement, founded after the defeat of the Indian Rebellion, around 1867, led to the establishment of thousands of conservative Islamic schools or madrasahs throughout modern-day India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

===Early history===
The end of the 19th century saw the dismemberment of most of the Muslim Ottoman Empire by non-Muslim European colonial powers, despite the empire&#x27;s spending massive sums on Western civilian and military technology to try to modernize and compete with the encroaching European powers. In the process the Ottomans went deep into debt to these powers.

Preaching Islamic alternatives to this humiliating decline were Jamal ad-din al-Afghani (1837–97), Muhammad Abduh (1849–1905) and Rashid Rida (1865–1935). Abduh&#x27;s student Rida is widely regarded as one of the &quot;ideological forefathers&quot; of contemporary Islamist movement, and along with early Salafiyya Hassan al-Banna,and Mustafa al-Siba&#x27;i, preached that a truly Islamic society would follow sharia law, reject taqlid, (the blind imitation of earlier authorities), restore the Caliphate.

==== Sayyid Rashid Rida ====

Syrian-Egyptian Islamic cleric Muhammad Rashid Rida was one of the earliest 20th-century Sunni scholars to articulate the modern concept of an Islamic state, influencing the Muslim Brotherhood and other Sunni Islamist movements. In his influential book &quot;al-Khilafa aw al-Imama al-&#x27;Uzma&quot; (&quot;The Caliphate or the Grand Imamate&quot;); Rida explained that that societies that properly obeyed &quot;Sharia&quot; would be successful alternatives to the disorder and injustice of both capitalism and socialism.

This society would be ruled by a Caliphate; the ruling Caliph (&quot;Khalifa&quot;) governing through &quot;shura&quot; (consultation), and applying Sharia (Islamic laws) in partnership with Islamic juristic clergy, who would use &quot;Ijtihad&quot; to update &quot;fiqh&quot; by evaluating scripture. With the &quot;Khilafa&quot; providing true Islamic governance, Islamic civilization would be revitalised, the political and legal independence of the Muslim &quot;umma&quot; (community of Muslim believers) would be restored, and the heretical influences of Sufism would be cleansed from Islam. This doctrine would become the blueprint of future Islamist movements.

====Muhammad Iqbal====

Muhammad Iqbal was a philosopher, poet and politician in British India, widely regarded as having inspired the Islamic Nationalism and Pakistan Movement in British India.

Iqbal expressed fears of secularism and secular nationalism weakening the spiritual foundations of Islam and Muslim society, and of India&#x27;s Hindu-majority population crowding out Muslim heritage, culture and political influence. In 
1930, Iqbal outlined a vision of an independent state for Muslim-majority provinces in northwestern India which inspired the Pakistan movement.

He also promoted pan-Islamic unity in his travels to Egypt, Afghanistan, Palestine and Syria.

His ideas later influenced many reformist Islamists, e.g., Muhammad Asad, Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi and Ali Shariati.

====Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi====

Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi was an important early twentieth-century figure in the Islamic revival in India, and then after independence from Britain, in Pakistan. Maududi was an Islamist ideologue and Hanafi Sunni scholar active in Hyderabad Deccan and later in Pakistan. Maududi was born to a clerical family and got his early education at home. At the age of eleven, he was admitted to a public school in Aurangabad. In 1919, he joined the Khilafat Movement and got closer to the scholars of Deoband. He commenced the &quot;Dars-i Nizami&quot; education under supervision of Deobandi seminary at the Fatihpuri mosque in Delhi. Trained as a lawyer he worked as a journalist, and gained a wide audience with his books (translated into many languages) which placed Islam in a modern context. His writings had a profound impact on Sayyid Qutb. Maududi also founded the Jamaat-e-Islami party in 1941 and remained its leader until 1972.

In 1925, he wrote a book on Jihad, &quot;al-Jihad fil-Islam&quot; (), that can be regarded as his first contribution to Islamism. Maududi believed that Muslim society could not be Islamic without Sharia (influencing Qutb and Khomeini), and the establishment of an Islamic state to enforce it. The state would be based on the principles of: &quot;tawhid&quot; (unity of God), &quot;risala&quot; (prophethood) and &quot;khilafa&quot; (caliphate). Maududi was uninterested in violent revolution or populist policies such as those of the Iranian Revolution, but sought gradual change in the hearts and minds of individuals from the top of society downward through an educational process or &quot;da&#x27;wah&quot;. Maududi believed that Islam was all-encompassing: &quot;Everything in the universe is &#x27;Muslim&#x27; for it obeys God by submission to His laws.&quot; &quot;The man who denies God is called Kafir (concealer) because he conceals by his disbelief what is inherent in his nature and embalmed in his own soul.&quot;

====Muslim Brotherhood====
Roughly contemporaneous with Maududi was the founding of the Muslim Brotherhood in Ismailiyah, Egypt in 1928 by Hassan al Banna. His was arguably the first, largest and most influential modern Islamic political/religious organization. Under the motto &quot;the Qur&#x27;an is our constitution&quot;,
it sought Islamic revival through preaching and also by providing basic community services including schools, mosques, and workshops. Like Maududi, Al Banna believed in the necessity of government rule based on Shariah law implemented gradually and by persuasion, and of eliminating all Western imperialist influence in the Muslim world.

Some elements of the Brotherhood did engage in violence, assassinating Egypt&#x27;s premier Mahmoud Fahmy El Nokrashy in 1948. MB founder Al-Banna was assassinated in retaliation three months later. The Brotherhood has suffered periodic repression in Egypt and has been banned several times, in 1948 and several years later following confrontations with Egyptian president Gamal Abdul Nasser, who jailed thousands of members for several years.

The Brotherhood expanded to many other countries, particularly in the Arab world. In Egypt, despite periodic repression—for many years it was
described as &quot;semi-legal&quot;—it was the only opposition group in Egypt able to field candidates during elections. In the 2011–12 Egyptian parliamentary election, the political parties identified as &quot;Islamist&quot; (the Brotherhood&#x27;s Freedom and Justice Party, Salafi Al-Nour Party and liberal Islamist Al-Wasat Party) won 75% of the total seats. Mohamed Morsi, the candidate of the Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s party, was the first democratically elected president of Egypt. However, he was deposed during the 2013 Egyptian coup d&#x27;état, after mass protests against what were perceived as undemocratic moves by him. Today, the Muslim Brotherhood is designated as a terrorist organization by Bahrain, Russia, Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

====Sayyid Qutb (1906–1966)====


Qutb, a leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood movement, is considered by some (Fawaz A. Gerges) to be &quot;the founding father and leading theoretician&quot; of modern jihadists, such as Osama bin Laden. He was executed for allegedly participating in a presidential assassination plot in 1966.

Maududi&#x27;s political ideas influenced Sayyid Qutb. Like Maududi, he believed Sharia was crucial to Islam, so the restoration of its full enforcement was vital to the world. Since Sharia had not been fully enforced for centuries, Islam had &quot;been extinct for a few centuries&quot;. Qutb preached that Muslims must engage in a two-pronged attack of converting individuals through preaching Islam peacefully but also using &quot;physical power and jihad&quot;. Force was necessary because &quot;those who have usurped the authority of God&quot; would not give up their power through friendly persuasion.
Like Khomeini, whom he influenced he believed the West was engaged in a vicious centuries long war against Islam.

=== Six-Day War (1967) ===
The defeat of the armies of several Arab states by Israel during the Six-Day War marked a significant moment in the Arab world. The loss, coupled with economic stagnation in these countries, was attributed by some to the secular Arab nationalism of the ruling regimes. This period saw a decline in the popularity and credibility of secular, socialist, and nationalist ideologies, such as Ba&#x27;athism, Arab socialism, and Arab nationalism. In contrast, various Islamist movements, both democratic and anti-democratic, inspired by figures like Maududi and Sayyid Qutb, began to gain influence.

=== Iranian Revolution (1978–1979) ===


The first modern &quot;Islamist state&quot; (with the possible exception of Zia&#x27;s Pakistan) was established among the Shia of Iran. In a major shock to the rest of the world, Muslim and non-Muslim, a revolution led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini overthrew the secular, oil-rich, well-armed, pro-American monarchy of Shah Muhammad Reza Pahlavi. The revolution was an &quot;indisputable sea change&quot;; Islamism had been a topic of limited impact and interest before 1979, but after the revolution, &quot;nobody within the Muslim world or outside it&quot; remained unaware of militant Islam.

Enthusiasm for the Iranian revolution in the Muslim world could be intense; 
and there were many reasons for optimism among Islamists outside Iran. Khomeini was implementing Islamic law. He was interested in Pan-Islamic (and pan-Islamist) unity and made efforts to &quot;bridge the gap&quot; between Shiites and Sunnis, declaring &quot;it permissible for Shiites to pray behind Sunni imams&quot;, and forbidding Shiites from &quot;criticizing the Caliphs who preceded Ali&quot; (revered by Sunnis but not Shia). The Islamic Republic also downplayed Shia rituals (such as the Day of Ashura), and shrines Before the Revolution, Khomeini acolytes (such as today&#x27;s Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei), translated and championed the works of the Muslim Brotherhood jihadist theorist, Sayyid Qutb, and other Sunni Islamists/revivalists.

This campaign did not survive his death however. As previously submissive Shia (usually minorities) became more assertive, Sunnis saw mostly &quot;Shia mischief&quot; and a challenge to Sunni dominance. &quot;What followed was a Sunni-versus-Shia contest for dominance, and it grew intense.&quot; Animosity between the two sects in Iran and its neighbors is systemic as of 2014, with thousands killed from sectarian fighting in Iraq and Pakistan. Also tarnishing the revolution&#x27;s image have been &quot;purges, executions, and atrocities&quot;, and periodic and increasingly widespread domestic unrest and protest by young Iranians.

Among the &quot;most important by-products of the Iranian revolution&quot; (according to Mehrzad Boroujerdi as of 2014) include &quot;the emergence of Hezbollah in Lebanon, the moral boost provided to Shia forces in Iraq, the regional cold war against Saudi Arabia and Israel, lending an Islamic flavour to the anti-imperialist, anti-American sentiment in the Middle East, and inadvertently widening the Sunni-Shia cleavage&quot;. The Islamic Republic has also maintained its hold on power in Iran in spite of US economic sanctions, and has created or assisted like-minded Shia terrorist groups in Iraq (SCIRI) and Lebanon (Hezbollah) (two Muslim countries that also have a large percentage of Shiites).

The campaign to overthrow the shah led by Khomeini had had a strong class flavor (Khomeini preached that the shah was widening the gap between rich and poor; condemning the working class to a life of poverty, misery, and drudgery, etc.); and the &quot;pro-rural and pro-poor&quot; approach has led to almost universal access to electricity and clean water, but critics of the regime complain of promises made and not kept: the &quot;sons of the revolution&#x27;s leaders and the business class that decides to work within the rules of the regime ... flaunt their wealth, driving luxury sportscars around Tehran, posting Instagram pictures of their ski trips and beach trips around the world, all while the poor and the middle class are struggling to survive or maintain the appearance of a dignified life&quot; (according to Shadi Mokhtari). One commitment made (to his followers if not the Iranian public) that has been kept is Guardianship by the Islamic jurist. But Rather than strengthening Islam and eliminating secular values and practices, the &quot;regime has ruined the Iranian people&#x27;s belief in religion&quot; (&quot;anonymous expert&quot;).

=== Grand Mosque seizure (1979) ===
The strength of the Islamist movement was manifest in an event which might have seemed sure to turn Muslim public opinion against fundamentalism, but did just the opposite. In 1979 the Grand Mosque in Mecca Saudi Arabia was seized by an armed fundamentalist group and held for over a week. Scores were killed, including many pilgrim bystanders in a gross violation of one of the most holy sites in Islam (and one where arms and violence are strictly forbidden).

Instead of prompting a backlash against the movement that inspired the attackers, however, Saudi Arabia, already very conservative, responded by shoring up its fundamentalist credentials with even more Islamic restrictions. Crackdowns followed on everything from shopkeepers who did not close for prayer and newspapers that published pictures of women, to the selling of dolls, teddy bears (images of animate objects are considered haraam), and dog food (dogs are considered unclean).

In other Muslim countries, blame for and wrath against the seizure was directed not against fundamentalists, but against Islamic fundamentalism&#x27;s foremost geopolitical enemy—the United States. Ayatollah Khomeini sparked attacks on American embassies when he announced: &quot;It is not beyond guessing that this is the work of criminal American imperialism and international Zionism&quot;, despite the fact that the object of the fundamentalists&#x27; revolt was the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, America&#x27;s major ally in the region. Anti-American demonstrations followed in the Philippines, Turkey, Bangladesh, India, the UAE, Pakistan, and Kuwait. The US Embassy in Libya was burned by protesters chanting pro-Khomeini slogans and the embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan was burned to the ground.

=== Pakistan&#x27;s Islamization (1979) ===

In 1979 after the coup by Zia al-Haq, the leader brought in Hudud Ordinances. Some of these laws continue to exist in Pakistan to this day.

=== Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (1979–1989) ===

In 1979, the Soviet Union deployed its 40th Army into Afghanistan, attempting to suppress an Islamic rebellion against an allied Marxist regime in the Afghan Civil War. The conflict, pitting indigenous impoverished Muslims (mujahideen) against an anti-religious superpower, galvanized thousands of Muslims around the world to send aid and sometimes to go themselves to fight for their faith. Leading this pan-Islamic effort was Palestinian &#x27;alim Abdullah Yusuf Azzam. While the military effectiveness of these &quot;Afghan Arabs&quot; was marginal, an estimated 16,000 to 35,000 Muslim volunteers came from around the world to fight in Afghanistan.

When the Soviet Union abandoned the Marxist Najibullah regime and withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 (the regime finally fell in 1992), the victory was seen by many Muslims as the triumph of Islamic faith over superior military power and technology that could be duplicated elsewhere.

The jihadists gained legitimacy and prestige from their triumph both within the militant community and among ordinary Muslims, as well as the confidence to carry their jihad to other countries where they believed Muslims required assistance.

The collapse of the Soviet Union itself, in 1991, was seen by many Islamists, including Bin Laden, as the defeat of a superpower at the hands of Islam. Concerning the $6 billion in aid given by the US and Pakistan&#x27;s military training and intelligence support to the mujahideen, bin Laden wrote: &quot;[T]he US has no mentionable role&quot; in &quot;the collapse of the Soviet Union... rather the credit goes to God and the &quot;mujahidin&quot;&quot; of Afghanistan.
=== Persian Gulf War (1990–1991) ===

Another factor in the early 1990s that worked to radicalize the Islamist movement was the Gulf War, which brought several hundred thousand US and allied non-Muslim military personnel to Saudi Arabian soil to put an end to Saddam Hussein&#x27;s occupation of Kuwait. Prior to 1990 Saudi Arabia played an important role in restraining the many Islamist groups that received its aid. But when Saddam, secularist and Ba&#x27;athist dictator of neighboring Iraq, attacked Kuwait (his enemy in the war), western troops came to protect the Saudi monarchy. Islamists accused the Saudi regime of being a puppet of the west.

These attacks resonated with conservative Muslims and the problem did not go away with Saddam&#x27;s defeat either, since American troops remained stationed in the kingdom, and a de facto cooperation with the Palestinian-Israeli peace process developed. Saudi Arabia attempted to compensate for its loss of prestige among these groups by repressing those domestic Islamists who attacked it (bin Laden being a prime example), and increasing aid to Islamic groups (Islamist madrassas around the world and even aiding some violent Islamist groups) that did not, but its pre-war influence on behalf of moderation was greatly reduced. One result of this was a campaign of attacks on government officials and tourists in Egypt, a bloody civil war in Algeria and Osama bin Laden&#x27;s terror attacks climaxing in the 9/11 attack.

=== Social and cultural triumph in the 2000s ===
By the beginning of the twenty first century, &quot;the word secular, a label proudly worn&quot; in the 1960s and 70s was &quot;shunned&quot; and &quot;used to besmirch&quot; political foes in Egypt and the rest of the Muslim world. Islamists surpassed the small secular opposition parties in terms of &quot;doggedness, courage,&quot; &quot;risk-taking&quot; or &quot;organizational skills&quot;. As of 2002,
In the Middle East and Pakistan, religious discourse dominates societies, the airwaves, and thinking about the world. Radical mosques have proliferated throughout Egypt. Book stores are dominated by works with religious themes ... The demand for sharia, the belief that their governments are unfaithful to Islam and that Islam is the answer to all problems, and the certainty that the West has declared war on Islam; these are the themes that dominate public discussion. Islamists may not control parliaments or government palaces, but they have occupied the popular imagination.

Opinion polls in a variety of Islamic countries showed that significant majorities opposed groups like ISIS, but also wanted religion to play a greater role in public life.

=== &quot;Post-Islamism&quot; ===

By 2020, approximately 40 years after the Islamic overthrow of the Shah of Iran and the seizure of the Grand Mosque by extremists, a number of observers (Olivier Roy, Mustafa Akyol, Nader Hashemi) detected a decline in the vigor and popularity of Islamism. Islamism had been an idealized/utopian concept to compare with the grim reality of the status quo, but in more than four decades it had failed to establish a &quot;concrete and viable blueprint for society&quot; despite repeated efforts (Olivier Roy); and instead had left a less than inspiring track record of its impact on the world (Nader Hashemi). Consequently,
in addition to the trend towards moderation by Islamist or formerly Islamist parties (such as PKS of Indonesia, AKP of Turkey, and PAS of Malaysia) mentioned above, there has been a social/religious and sometimes political backlash against Islamist rule in countries like Turkey, Iran, and Sudan (Mustafa Akyol).

Writing in 2020, Mustafa Akyol argues there has been a strong reaction by many Muslims against political Islam, including a weakening of religious faith—the very thing Islamism was intended to strengthen. He suggests this backlash against Islamism among Muslim youth has come from all the &quot;terrible things&quot; that have happened in the Arab world in the twenty first century &quot;in the name of Islam&quot;—such as the &quot;sectarian civil wars in Syria, Iraq and Yemen&quot;.

Polls taken by Arab Barometer in six Arab countries – Algeria, Egypt, Tunisia, Jordan, Iraq and Libya – found &quot;Arabs are losing faith in religious parties and leaders.&quot; In 2018–19, in all six countries, fewer than 20% of those asked whether they trusted Islamist parties answered in the affirmative. That percentage had fallen (in all six countries) from when the same question was asked in 2012–14. Mosque attendance also declined more than 10 points on average, and the share of those Arabs describing themselves as &quot;not religious&quot; went from 8% in 2013 to 13% in 2018–19. In Syria, Sham al-Ali reports &quot;rising apostasy among Syrian youths&quot;.

Writing in 2021, Nader Hashemi notes that in Iraq, Sudan, Tunisia, Egypt, Gaza, Jordan and other places were Islamist parties have come to power or campaigned to, &quot;one general theme stands. The popular prestige of political Islam has been tarnished by its experience with state power.&quot;
In Iran, hardline Ayatollah Mohammad-Taqi Mesbah Yazdi has complained, &quot;Iranians are evading religious teachings and turning to secularism.&quot;
Even Islamist terrorism was in decline and tended &quot;to be local&quot; rather than pan-Islamic. As of 2021, Al-Qaeda consisted of &quot;a bunch of militias&quot; with no effective central command (Fareed Zakaria).

==Criticism==

Islamism, or elements of Islamism, have been criticized on numerous grounds, including repression of free expression and individual rights, rigidity, hypocrisy, anti-semitism, misinterpreting the Quran and Sunnah, lack of true understanding of and innovations to Islam (bid&#x27;ah) – notwithstanding proclaimed opposition to any such innovation by Islamists.

<text>An instructional theory is &quot;a theory that offers explicit guidance on how to better help people learn and develop.&quot; It provides insights about what is likely to happen and why with respect to different kinds of teaching and learning activities while helping indicate approaches for their evaluation. Instructional designers focus on how to best structure material and instructional behavior to facilitate learning.

== Development ==
Originating in the United States in the late 1970s, &quot;instructional theory&quot; is influenced by three basic theories in educational thought: behaviorism, the theory that helps us understand how people conform to predetermined standards; cognitivism, the theory that learning occurs through mental associations; and constructivism, the theory explores the value of human activity as a critical function of gaining knowledge. Instructional theory is heavily influenced by the 1956 work of Benjamin Bloom, a University of Chicago professor, and the results of his Taxonomy of Education Objectives—one of the first modern codifications of the learning process. One of the first instructional theorists was Robert M. Gagne, who in 1965 published &quot;Conditions of Learning&quot; for the Florida State University&#x27;s Department of Educational Research.

==Definition==
Instructional theory is different than learning theory. A learning theory &quot;describes&quot; how learning takes place, and an instructional theory &quot;prescribes&quot; how to better help people learn. Learning theories often inform instructional theory, and three general theoretical stances take part in this influence: behaviorism (learning as response acquisition), cognitivism (learning as knowledge acquisition), and constructivism (learning as knowledge construction). Instructional theory helps us create conditions that increases the probability of learning. Its goal is understanding the instructional system and to improve the process of instruction.

== Overview ==

Instructional theories identify what instruction or teaching should be like. It outlines strategies that an educator may adopt to achieve the learning objectives. Instructional theories are adapted based on the educational content and more importantly the learning style of the students. They are used as teaching guidelines/tools by teachers/trainers to facilitate learning. Instructional theories encompass different instructional methods, models and strategies.

David Merrill&#x27;s First Principles of Instruction discusses universal methods of instruction, situational methods and core ideas of the post-industrial paradigm of instruction.

Universal Methods of Instruction:

* Task-Centered Principle - instruction should use a progression of increasingly complex whole tasks.
* Demonstration Principle - instruction should guide learners through a skill and engage peer discussion/demonstration.
* Application Principle - instruction should provide intrinsic or corrective feedback and engage peer-collaboration.
* Activation Principle - instruction should build upon prior knowledge and encourage learners to acquire a structure for organizing new knowledge.
* Integration Principle - instruction should engage learners in peer-critiques and synthesizing newly acquired knowledge.
Situational Methods:

based on different approaches to instruction
* Role play
* Synectics
* Mastery learning
* Direct instruction
* Discussion
* Conflict resolution
* Peer learning
* Experiential learning
* Problem-based learning
* Simulation-based learning
based on different learning outcomes:
* Knowledge
* Comprehension
* Application
* Analysis
* Synthesis
* Evaluation
* Affective development
* Integrated learning
Core ideas for the Post-industrial Paradigm of Instruction:
* Learner centered vs. teacher centered instruction – with respect to the focus, instruction can be based on the capability and style of the learner or the teacher.
* Learning by doing vs. teacher presenting – Students often learn more by doing rather than simply listening to instructions given by the teacher.
* Attainment based vs. time based progress – The instruction can either be based on the focus on the mastery of the concept or the time spent on learning the concept.
* Customized vs. standardized instruction – The instruction can be different for different learners or the instruction can be given in general to the entire classroom
* Criterion referenced vs. norm referenced instruction – Instruction related to different types of evaluations.
* Collaborative vs. individual instruction – Instruction can be for a team of students or individual students.
* Enjoyable vs. unpleasant instructions – Instructions can create a pleasant learning experience or a negative one (often to enforce discipline). Teachers must take care to ensure positive experiences.
Four tasks of Instructional theory:
* Knowledge selection
* Knowledge sequence
* Interaction management
* Setting of interaction environment

==Critiques ==
Paulo Freire&#x27;s work appears to critique instructional approaches that adhere to the knowledge acquisition stance, and his work &quot;Pedagogy of the Oppressed&quot; has had a broad influence over a generation of American educators with his critique of various &quot;banking&quot; models of education and analysis of the teacher-student relationship.

Freire explains, &quot;Narration (with the teacher as narrator) leads the students to memorize mechanically the narrated content. Worse yet, it turns them into &quot;containers&quot;, into &quot;receptacles&quot; to be &quot;filled&quot; by the teacher. The more completely she fills the receptacles, the better a teacher she is. The more meekly the receptacles permit themselves to be filled, the better students they are.&quot; In this way he explains educator creates an act of depositing knowledge in a student. The student thus becomes a repository of knowledge. Freire explains that this system that diminishes creativity and knowledge suffers. Knowledge, according to Freire, comes about only through the learner by inquiry and pursuing the subjects in the world and through interpersonal interaction.

Freire further states, &quot;In the banking concept of education, knowledge is a gift bestowed by those who consider themselves knowledgeable upon those whom they consider to know nothing. Projecting an absolute ignorance onto others, a characteristic of the ideology of oppression, negates education and knowledge as processes of inquiry. The teacher presents himself to his students as their necessary opposite; by considering their ignorance absolute, he justifies his own existence. The students, alienated like the slave in the Hegelian dialectic, accept their ignorance as justifying the teacher&#x27;s existence—but, unlike the slave, they never discover that they educate the teacher.&quot;
Freire then offered an alternative stance and wrote, &quot;The raison d&#x27;etre of libertarian education, on the other hand, lies in its drive towards reconciliation. Education must begin with the solution of the teacher-student contradiction, by reconciling the poles of the contradiction so that both are simultaneously teachers and students.&quot;

In the article, &quot;A process for the critical analysis of instructional theory&quot;, the authors use an ontology-building process to review and analyze concepts across different instructional theories. Here are their findings:
* Concepts exist in theoretical writing that theorists do not address directly.
* These tacit concepts, which supply the ontological categories, enable a more detailed comparison of theories beyond specific terminologies.
* Divergences between theories can be concealed behind common terms used by different theorists.
* A false sense of understanding often arises from a cursory, uncritical reading of the theories.
* Discontinuities and gaps are revealed within the theoretical literature when the tacit concepts are elicited.

<text>Infusoria is a word used to describe various freshwater microorganisms, including ciliates, copepods, euglenoids, planktonic crustaceans, protozoa, unicellular algae and small invertebrates. Some authors (e.g., Bütschli) have used the term as a synonym for Ciliophora. In modern, formal classifications, the term is considered obsolete; the microorganisms previously and colloquially referred to as Infusoria are mostly assigned to the clades Diaphoretickes (e.g. ciliates, most algae), Amorphea (e.g. crustaceans and other small animals) and Discoba (euglenids).

In other contexts, the term is used to define various aquatic microorganisms found in decomposing matter.

==Aquarium use==
Certain microorganisms, including cyclops and daphnia (among others), are sold as a supplemental fish food. Some fish stores or pet shops may have these infusoria available for live purchase, but typically they are sold in frozen cubes—for example, by the Japan-based fish food brand Hikari. Still, some advanced aquarists, with especially large collections of fish, will breed and cultivate their own supplies of the microorganisms.

Infusoria are especially used by aquarists and fish breeders to feed fish fry; because of their small sizes, infusoria can be used to rear newly-hatched offspring of many common (and also less common) aquarium species. Many average home aquaria are unable to naturally supply sufficient infusoria for fish-rearing, so hobbyists may create and maintain their own cultures, either through utilizing their own existing aquarium water or by using one of the many commercial cultures available. 

Infusoria can be cultured at-home by soaking any decomposing vegetative matter, such as papaya or cucumber peels, in a jar of aged (i.e., chlorine-free) water, preferably from an existing aquarium setup. The culture starts to proliferate in two to three days, depending on temperature and light received. The water first turns cloudy because of a rise in levels of bacteria, but clears up once the infusoria consume them. At this point, the infusoria are usually visible to the naked eye as small, white motile specks. They can be easily fed to fish with the use of a large turkey-baster or by gently scooping with a very fine net. Additionally, the water in which the infusoria are kept in can be changed periodically, even one to two times per week, by draining and replacing up to 50% of the volume of water (for hygienic and maintenance purposes).

<text>ISO/IEC 8859-1:1998, &quot;Information technology—8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets—Part 1: Latin alphabet No. 1&quot;, is part of the ISO/IEC 8859 series of ASCII-based standard character encodings, first edition published in 1987. ISO/IEC 8859-1 encodes what it refers to as &quot;Latin alphabet no. 1&quot;, consisting of 191 characters from the Latin script. This character-encoding scheme is used throughout the Americas, Western Europe, Oceania, and much of Africa. It is the basis for some popular 8-bit character sets and the first two blocks of characters in Unicode.

, 1.1% of all web sites use . It is the most declared single-byte character encoding, but as Web browsers and the HTML5 standard interpret them as the superset Windows-1252, these documents may include characters from that set. Some countries or languages show a higher usage than the global average, in 2024 Brazil according to website use, use is at 2.9%, and in Germany at 2.5%.

ISO-8859-1 was (according to the standard, at least) the default encoding of documents delivered via HTTP with a MIME type beginning with , the default encoding of the values of certain descriptive HTTP headers, and defined the repertoire of characters allowed in HTML 3.2 documents. It is specified by many other standards. In practice, the superset encoding Windows-1252 is the more likely effective default and it is increasingly common for UTF-8 to work whether or not a standard specifies it.

ISO-8859-1 is the IANA preferred name for this standard when supplemented with the C0 and C1 control codes from ISO/IEC 6429. The following other aliases are registered: iso-ir-100, csISOLatin1, latin1, l1, IBM819, Code page 28591 a.k.a. Windows-28591 is used for it in Windows. IBM calls it code page 819 or CP819 ([[CCSID]] 819). Oracle calls it WE8ISO8859P1.

== Coverage ==

Each character is encoded as a single eight-bit code value. These code values can be used in almost any data interchange system to communicate in the following languages (while it may exclude correct quotation marks such as for many languages including German and Icelandic):

=== Modern languages with complete coverage ===
;Notes
=== Languages with incomplete coverage ===
ISO-8859-1 was commonly used for certain languages, even though it lacks characters used by these languages. In most cases, only a few letters are missing or they are rarely used, and they can be replaced with characters that are in ISO-8859-1 using some form of typographic approximation. The following table lists such languages.


The letter &quot;ÿ&quot;, which appears in French only very rarely, mainly in city names such as L&#x27;Haÿ-les-Roses and never at the beginning of words, is included only in lowercase form. The slot corresponding to its uppercase form is occupied by the lowercase letter &quot;ß&quot; from the German language, which did not have an uppercase form at the time when the standard was created.

=== Quotation marks ===
For some languages listed above, the correct typographical quotation marks are missing, as only , , and are included. Also, this scheme does not provide for oriented (6- or 9-shaped) single or double quotation marks. Some fonts will display the spacing grave accent (0x60) and the apostrophe (0x27) as a matching pair of oriented single quotation marks (see ), but this is not considered part of the modern standard.

=== Superscript digits ===
Only 3 superscript digits have been encoded: codice_1 at 0xB2, codice_2 at 0xB3, and codice_3 at 0xB9, lacking the superscript digit 0 and digits 4–9. Additionally, none of the subscript digits have been encoded. A workaround would be to use rich text formatting for the digits not covered by this standard.

== History ==
ISO 8859-1 was based on the Multinational Character Set (MCS) used by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in the popular VT220 terminal in 1983. It was developed within the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA), and published in March 1985 as ECMA-94, by which name it is still sometimes known. The second edition of ECMA-94 (June 1986) also included ISO 8859-2, ISO 8859-3, and ISO 8859-4 as part of the specification.

The original draft of ISO 8859-1 placed French &quot;Œ&quot; and &quot;œ&quot; at code points 215 (0xD7) and 247 (0xF7), as in the MCS. However, the delegate from France, being neither a linguist nor a typographer, falsely stated that these are not independent French letters on their own, but mere ligatures (like &quot;ﬁ&quot; or &quot;ﬂ&quot;), supported by the delegate team from Bull Publishing Company, who regularly did not print French with &quot;Œ/œ&quot; in their house style at the time. An anglophone delegate from Canada insisted on retaining &quot;Œ/œ&quot; but was rebuffed by the French delegate and the team from Bull. These code points were soon filled with × and ÷ under the suggestion of the German delegation. Support for French was further reduced when it was again falsely stated that the letter &quot;ÿ&quot; is &quot;not French&quot;, resulting in the absence of the capital &quot;Ÿ&quot;. In fact, the letter &quot;ÿ&quot; is found in a number of French proper names, and the capital letter has been used in dictionaries and encyclopedias. These characters were added to ISO/IEC 8859-15:1999. BraSCII matches the original draft.

In 1985, Commodore adopted ECMA-94 for its new AmigaOS operating system. The Seikosha MP-1300AI impact dot-matrix printer, used with the Amiga 1000, included this encoding.

In 1990, the first version of Unicode used the code points of ISO-8859-1 as the first 256 Unicode code points.

In 1992, the IANA registered the character map ISO_8859-1:1987, more commonly known by its preferred MIME name of ISO-8859-1 (note the extra hyphen over ISO 8859-1), a superset of ISO 8859-1, for use on the Internet. This map assigns the C0 and C1 control codes to the unassigned code values thus provides for 256 characters via every possible 8-bit value.

=== ISO/IEC 8859-15 ===
ISO/IEC 8859-15 was developed in 1999, as an update of ISO/IEC 8859-1. It provides some characters for French and Finnish text and the euro sign, which are missing from ISO/IEC 8859-1. This required the removal of some infrequently used characters from ISO/IEC 8859-1, including fraction symbols and letter-free diacritics: , , , , , , , and . Ironically, three of the newly added characters (, , and ) had already been present in DEC&#x27;s 1983 Multinational Character Set (MCS), the predecessor to ISO/IEC 8859-1 (1987). Since their original code points were now reused for other purposes, the characters had to be reintroduced under different, less logical code points.

ISO-IR-204, a more minor modification (called code page 61235 by FreeDOS), had been registered in 1998, altering ISO-8859-1 by replacing the universal currency sign (¤) with the euro sign (the same substitution made by ISO-8859-15).

=== Windows-1252 ===
The popular Windows-1252 character set adds all the missing characters provided by ISO/IEC 8859-15, plus a number of typographic symbols, by replacing the rarely used C1 controls in the range 128 to 159 (hex 80 to 9F). It is very common for Windows-1252 text to be mislabelled as ISO-8859-1. A common result was that all the quotes and apostrophes (produced by &quot;smart quotes&quot; in word-processing software) were replaced with question marks or boxes on non-Windows operating systems, making text difficult to read. Many Web browsers and e-mail clients will interpret ISO-8859-1 control codes as Windows-1252 characters, and that behavior was later standardized in HTML5.

=== Mac Roman ===
The Apple Macintosh computer introduced a character encoding called Mac Roman in 1984. It was meant to be suitable for Western European desktop publishing. It is a superset of ASCII, and has most of the characters that are in ISO-8859-1 and all the extra characters from Windows-1252, but in a totally different arrangement. The few printable characters that are in ISO/IEC 8859-1, but not in this set, are often a source of trouble when editing text on Web sites using older Macintosh browsers, including the last version of Internet Explorer for Mac.

=== Other ===
DOS has code page 850, which has all printable characters that ISO-8859-1 has, albeit in a totally different arrangement, plus the most widely used graphic characters from code page 437.

Between 1989 and 2015, Hewlett-Packard used another superset of ISO-8859-1 on many of their calculators. This proprietary character set was sometimes referred to simply as &quot;ECMA-94&quot; as well. HP also has code page 1053, which adds the medium shade (▒, U+2592) at 0x7F.

Several EBCDIC code pages were purposely designed to have the same set of characters as ISO-8859-1, to allow easy conversion between them.

<doc id="15020" wikidata="Q221738" url="?curid=15020" title="ISO/IEC 8859">
<text>ISO/IEC 8859 is a joint ISO and IEC series of standards for 8-bit character encodings. The series of standards consists of numbered parts, such as ISO/IEC 8859-1, ISO/IEC 8859-2, etc. There are 15 parts, excluding the abandoned ISO/IEC 8859-12. The ISO working group maintaining this series of standards has been disbanded.

ISO/IEC 8859 parts 1, 2, 3, and 4 were originally Ecma International standard ECMA-94.

==Introduction==
While the bit patterns of the 95 printable ASCII characters are sufficient to exchange information in modern English, most other languages that use Latin alphabets need additional symbols not covered by ASCII. ISO/IEC 8859 sought to remedy this problem by utilizing the eighth bit in an 8-bit byte to allow positions for another 96 printable characters. Early encodings were limited to 7 bits because of restrictions of some data transmission protocols, and partially for historical reasons. However, more characters were needed than could fit in a single 8-bit character encoding, so several mappings were developed, including at least ten suitable for various Latin alphabets.

The ISO/IEC 8859 standard parts only define printable characters, although they explicitly set apart the byte ranges 0x00–1F and 0x7F–9F as &quot;combinations that do not represent graphic characters&quot; (i.e. which are reserved for use as control characters) in accordance with ISO/IEC 4873; they were designed to be used in conjunction with a separate standard defining the control functions associated with these bytes, such as ISO 6429 or ISO 6630. To this end a series of encodings registered with the IANA add the C0 control set (control characters mapped to bytes 0 to 31) from ISO 646 and the C1 control set (control characters mapped to bytes 128 to 159) from ISO 6429, resulting in full 8-bit character maps with most, if not all, bytes assigned. These sets have ISO-8859-&quot;n&quot; as their preferred MIME name or, in cases where a preferred MIME name is not specified, their canonical name. Many people use the terms ISO/IEC 8859-&quot;n&quot; and ISO-8859-&quot;n&quot; interchangeably. ISO/IEC 8859-11 did not get such a charset assigned, presumably because it was almost identical to TIS 620.

==Characters==
The ISO/IEC 8859 standard is designed for reliable information exchange, not typography; the standard omits symbols needed for high-quality typography, such as optional ligatures, curly quotation marks, dashes, etc. As a result, high-quality typesetting systems often use proprietary or idiosyncratic extensions on top of the ASCII and ISO/IEC 8859 standards, or use Unicode instead.

An inexact rule based on practical experience states that if a character or symbol was not already part of a widely used data-processing character set and was also not usually provided on typewriter keyboards for a national language, it did not get in. Hence the directional double quotation marks &quot;«&quot; and &quot;»&quot; used for some European languages were included, but not the directional double quotation marks &quot;“&quot; and &quot;”&quot; used for English and some other languages.

French did not get its &quot;œ&quot; and &quot;Œ&quot; ligatures because they could be typed as &#x27;oe&#x27;. Likewise, &quot;Ÿ&quot;, needed for all-caps text, was dropped as well. Albeit under different codepoints, these three characters were later reintroduced with ISO/IEC 8859-15 in 1999, which also introduced the new euro sign character €. Likewise Dutch did not get the &quot;ĳ&quot; and &quot;Ĳ&quot; letters, because Dutch speakers had become used to typing these as two letters instead.

Romanian did not initially get its &quot;Ș&quot;/&quot;ș&quot; and &quot;Ț&quot;/&quot;ț&quot; (with comma) letters, because these letters were initially unified with &quot;Ş&quot;/&quot;ş&quot; and &quot;Ţ&quot;/&quot;ţ&quot; (with cedilla) by the Unicode Consortium, considering the shapes with comma beneath to be glyph variants of the shapes with cedilla. However, the letters with explicit comma below were later added to the Unicode standard and are also in ISO/IEC 8859-16.

Most of the ISO/IEC 8859 encodings provide diacritic marks required for various European languages using the Latin script. Others provide non-Latin alphabets: Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic and Thai. Most of the encodings contain only spacing characters, although the Thai, Hebrew, and Arabic ones do also contain combining characters.

The standard makes no provision for the scripts of East Asian languages (&quot;CJK&quot;), as their ideographic writing systems require many thousands of code points. Although it uses Latin based characters, Vietnamese does not fit into 96 positions (without using combining diacritics such as in Windows-1258) either. Each Japanese syllabic alphabet (hiragana or katakana, see Kana) would fit, as in JIS X 0201, but like several other alphabets of the world they are not encoded in the ISO/IEC 8859 system.

==The parts of ISO/IEC 8859==
ISO/IEC 8859 is divided into the following parts:

Each part of ISO/IEC 8859 is designed to support languages that often borrow from each other, so the characters needed by each language are usually accommodated by a single part. However, there are some characters and language combinations that are not accommodated without transcriptions. Efforts were made to make conversions as smooth as possible. For example, German has all of its seven special characters at the same positions in all Latin variants (1–4, 9, 10, 13–16), and in many positions the characters only differ in the diacritics between the sets. In particular, variants 1–4 were designed jointly, and have the property that every encoded character appears either at a given position or not at all.

==Relationship to Unicode and the UCS==
Since 1991, the Unicode Consortium has been working with ISO and IEC to develop the Unicode Standard and ISO/IEC 10646: the Universal Character Set (UCS) in tandem. Newer editions of ISO/IEC 8859 express characters in terms of their Unicode/UCS names and the &quot;U+nnnn&quot; notation, effectively causing each part of ISO/IEC 8859 to be a Unicode/UCS character encoding scheme that maps a very small subset of the UCS to single 8-bit bytes. The first 256 characters in Unicode and the UCS are identical to those in ISO/IEC-8859-1 (Latin-1).

Single-byte character sets including the parts of ISO/IEC 8859 and derivatives of them were favoured throughout the 1990s, having the advantages of being well-established and more easily implemented in software: the equation of one byte to one character is simple and adequate for most single-language applications, and there are no combining characters or variant forms. As Unicode-enabled operating systems became more widespread, ISO/IEC 8859 and other legacy encodings became less popular. While remnants of ISO 8859 and single-byte character models remain entrenched in many operating systems, programming languages, data storage systems, networking applications, display hardware, and end-user application software, most modern computing applications use Unicode internally, and rely on conversion tables to map to and from other encodings, when necessary.

==Current status==
The ISO/IEC 8859 standard was maintained by ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 2, Working Group 3 (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2/WG 3). In June 2004, WG 3 disbanded, and maintenance duties were transferred to SC 2. The standard is not currently being updated, as the Subcommittee&#x27;s only remaining working group, WG 2, is concentrating on development of Unicode&#x27;s Universal Coded Character Set.

The WHATWG Encoding Standard, which specifies the character encodings permitted in HTML5 which compliant browsers must support, includes most parts of ISO/IEC 8859, except for parts 1, 9 and 11, which are instead interpreted as Windows-1252, Windows-1254 and Windows-874 respectively. Authors of new pages and the designers of new protocols are instructed to use UTF-8 instead.

<doc id="15022" wikidata="Q11388" url="?curid=15022" title="Infrared">
<text>Infrared (IR; sometimes called infrared light) is electromagnetic radiation (EMR) with wavelengths longer than that of visible light but shorter than microwaves. The infrared spectral band begins with the waves that are just longer than those of red light (the longest waves in the visible spectrum), so IR is invisible to the human eye. IR is generally understood to include wavelengths from around to . IR is commonly divided between longer-wavelength thermal IR, emitted from terrestrial sources, and shorter-wavelength IR or near-IR, part of the solar spectrum. Longer IR wavelengths (30–100 μm) are sometimes included as part of the terahertz radiation band. Almost all black-body radiation from objects near room temperature is in the IR band. As a form of EMR, IR carries energy and momentum, exerts radiation pressure, and has properties corresponding to both those of a wave and of a particle, the photon.

It was long known that fires emit invisible heat; in 1681 the pioneering experimenter Edme Mariotte showed that glass, though transparent to sunlight, obstructed radiant heat. In 1800 the astronomer Sir William Herschel discovered that infrared radiation is a type of invisible radiation in the spectrum lower in energy than red light, by means of its effect on a thermometer. Slightly more than half of the energy from the Sun was eventually found, through Herschel&#x27;s studies, to arrive on Earth in the form of infrared. The balance between absorbed and emitted infrared radiation has an important effect on Earth&#x27;s climate.

Infrared radiation is emitted or absorbed by molecules when changing rotational-vibrational movements. It excites vibrational modes in a molecule through a change in the dipole moment, making it a useful frequency range for study of these energy states for molecules of the proper symmetry. Infrared spectroscopy examines absorption and transmission of photons in the infrared range.

Infrared radiation is used in industrial, scientific, military, commercial, and medical applications. Night-vision devices using active near-infrared illumination allow people or animals to be observed without the observer being detected. Infrared astronomy uses sensor-equipped telescopes to penetrate dusty regions of space such as molecular clouds, to detect objects such as planets, and to view highly red-shifted objects from the early days of the universe. Infrared thermal-imaging cameras are used to detect heat loss in insulated systems, to observe changing blood flow in the skin, to assist firefighting, and to detect the overheating of electrical components. Military and civilian applications include target acquisition, surveillance, night vision, homing, and tracking. Humans at normal body temperature radiate chiefly at wavelengths around 10 μm. Non-military uses include thermal efficiency analysis, environmental monitoring, industrial facility inspections, detection of grow-ops, remote temperature sensing, short-range wireless communication, spectroscopy, and weather forecasting.

== Definition and relationship to the electromagnetic spectrum ==

There is no universally accepted definition of the range of infrared radiation. Typically, it is taken to extend from the nominal red edge of the visible spectrum at 780 nm to 1 mm. This range of wavelengths corresponds to a frequency range of approximately 430 THz down to 300 GHz. Beyond infrared is the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Increasingly, terahertz radiation is counted as part of the microwave band, not infrared, moving the band edge of infrared to 0.1 mm (3 THz).

== Nature ==

Sunlight, at an effective temperature of 5,780 K (5,510 °C, 9,940 °F), is composed of near-thermal-spectrum radiation that is slightly more than half infrared. At zenith, sunlight provides an irradiance of just over 1 kW per square meter at sea level. Of this energy, 527 W is infrared radiation, 445 W is visible light, and 32 W is ultraviolet radiation. Nearly all the infrared radiation in sunlight is near infrared, shorter than 4 μm.

On the surface of Earth, at far lower temperatures than the surface of the Sun, some thermal radiation consists of infrared in the mid-infrared region, much longer than in sunlight. Black-body, or thermal, radiation is continuous: it radiates at all wavelengths. Of these natural thermal radiation processes, only lightning and natural fires are hot enough to produce much visible energy, and fires produce far more infrared than visible-light energy.

==Regions==

In general, objects emit infrared radiation across a spectrum of wavelengths, but sometimes only a limited region of the spectrum is of interest because sensors usually collect radiation only within a specific bandwidth. Thermal infrared radiation also has a maximum emission wavelength, which is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature of object, in accordance with Wien&#x27;s displacement law. The infrared band is often subdivided into smaller sections, although how the IR spectrum is thereby divided varies between different areas in which IR is employed.

=== Visible limit ===

Infrared radiation is generally considered to begin with wavelengths longer than visible by the human eye. There is no hard wavelength limit to what is visible, as the eye&#x27;s sensitivity decreases rapidly but smoothly, for wavelengths exceeding about 700 nm. Therefore wavelengths just longer than that can be seen if they are sufficiently bright, though they may still be classified as infrared according to usual definitions. Light from a near-IR laser may thus appear dim red and can present a hazard since it may actually be quite bright. Even IR at wavelengths up to 1,050 nm from pulsed lasers can be seen by humans under certain conditions.

=== Commonly used subdivision scheme ===

A commonly used subdivision scheme is:

NIR and SWIR together is sometimes called &quot;reflected infrared&quot;, whereas MWIR and LWIR is sometimes referred to as &quot;thermal infrared&quot;.

=== CIE division scheme ===

The International Commission on Illumination (CIE) recommended the division of infrared radiation into the following three bands:
=== ISO 20473 scheme ===

ISO 20473 specifies the following scheme:

=== Astronomy division scheme ===

Astronomers typically divide the infrared spectrum as follows:

These divisions are not precise and can vary depending on the publication. The three regions are used for observation of different temperature ranges, and hence different environments in space.

The most common photometric system used in astronomy allocates capital letters to different spectral regions according to filters used; I, J, H, and K cover the near-infrared wavelengths; L, M, N, and Q refer to the mid-infrared region. These letters are commonly understood in reference to atmospheric windows and appear, for instance, in the titles of many papers.

=== Sensor response division scheme ===

A third scheme divides up the band based on the response of various detectors:
* Near-infrared: from 0.7 to 1.0 μm (from the approximate end of the response of the human eye to that of silicon).
* Short-wave infrared: 1.0 to 3 μm (from the cut-off of silicon to that of the MWIR atmospheric window). InGaAs covers to about 1.8 μm; the less sensitive lead salts cover this region. Cryogenically cooled MCT detectors can cover the region of 1.0–2.5μm.
* Mid-wave infrared: 3 to 5 μm (defined by the atmospheric window and covered by indium antimonide, InSb and mercury cadmium telluride, HgCdTe, and partially by lead selenide, PbSe).
* Long-wave infrared: 8 to 12, or 7 to 14 μm (this is the atmospheric window covered by HgCdTe and microbolometers).
* Very-long wave infrared (VLWIR) (12 to about 30 μm, covered by doped silicon).

Near-infrared is the region closest in wavelength to the radiation detectable by the human eye. mid- and far-infrared are progressively further from the visible spectrum. Other definitions follow different physical mechanisms (emission peaks, vs. bands, water absorption) and the newest follow technical reasons (the common silicon detectors are sensitive to about 1,050 nm, while InGaAs&#x27;s sensitivity starts around 950 nm and ends between 1,700 and 2,600 nm, depending on the specific configuration). No international standards for these specifications are currently available.

The onset of infrared is defined (according to different standards) at various values typically between 700 nm and 800 nm, but the boundary between visible and infrared light is not precisely defined. The human eye is markedly less sensitive to light above 700 nm wavelength, so longer wavelengths make insignificant contributions to scenes illuminated by common light sources. Particularly intense near-IR light (e.g., from lasers, LEDs or bright daylight with the visible light filtered out) can be detected up to approximately 780 nm, and will be perceived as red light. Intense light sources providing wavelengths as long as 1,050 nm can be seen as a dull red glow, causing some difficulty in near-IR illumination of scenes in the dark (usually this practical problem is solved by indirect illumination). Leaves are particularly bright in the near IR, and if all visible light leaks from around an IR-filter are blocked, and the eye is given a moment to adjust to the extremely dim image coming through a visually opaque IR-passing photographic filter, it is possible to see the Wood effect that consists of IR-glowing foliage.

=== Telecommunication bands ===

In optical communications, the part of the infrared spectrum that is used is divided into seven bands based on availability of light sources, transmitting/absorbing materials (fibers), and detectors:

The C-band is the dominant band for long-distance telecommunications networks. The S and L bands are based on less well established technology, and are not as widely deployed.

== Heat ==

Infrared radiation is popularly known as &quot;heat radiation&quot;, but light and electromagnetic waves of any frequency will heat surfaces that absorb them. Infrared light from the Sun accounts for 49% of the heating of Earth, with the rest being caused by visible light that is absorbed then re-radiated at longer wavelengths. Visible light or ultraviolet-emitting lasers can char paper and incandescently hot objects emit visible radiation. Objects at room temperature will emit radiation concentrated mostly in the 8 to 25 μm band, but this is not distinct from the emission of visible light by incandescent objects and ultraviolet by even hotter objects (see black body and Wien&#x27;s displacement law).

Heat is energy in transit that flows due to a temperature difference. Unlike heat transmitted by thermal conduction or thermal convection, thermal radiation can propagate through a vacuum. Thermal radiation is characterized by a particular spectrum of many wavelengths that are associated with emission from an object, due to the vibration of its molecules at a given temperature. Thermal radiation can be emitted from objects at any wavelength, and at very high temperatures such radiation is associated with spectra far above the infrared, extending into visible, ultraviolet, and even X-ray regions (e.g. the solar corona). Thus, the popular association of infrared radiation with thermal radiation is only a coincidence based on typical (comparatively low) temperatures often found near the surface of planet Earth.

The concept of emissivity is important in understanding the infrared emissions of objects. This is a property of a surface that describes how its thermal emissions deviate from the ideal of a black body. To further explain, two objects at the same physical temperature may not show the same infrared image if they have differing emissivity. For example, for any pre-set emissivity value, objects with higher emissivity will appear hotter, and those with a lower emissivity will appear cooler (assuming, as is often the case, that the surrounding environment is cooler than the objects being viewed). When an object has less than perfect emissivity, it obtains properties of reflectivity and/or transparency, and so the temperature of the surrounding environment is partially reflected by and/or transmitted through the object. If the object were in a hotter environment, then a lower emissivity object at the same temperature would likely appear to be hotter than a more emissive one. For that reason, incorrect selection of emissivity and not accounting for environmental temperatures will give inaccurate results when using infrared cameras and pyrometers.

== Applications ==

=== Night vision ===
 Infrared is used in night vision equipment when there is insufficient visible light to see. Night vision devices operate through a process involving the conversion of ambient light photons into electrons that are then amplified by a chemical and electrical process and then converted back into visible light. Infrared light sources can be used to augment the available ambient light for conversion by night vision devices, increasing in-the-dark visibility without actually using a visible light source.

The use of infrared light and night vision devices should not be confused with thermal imaging, which creates images based on differences in surface temperature by detecting infrared radiation (heat) that emanates from objects and their surrounding environment.

=== Thermography ===
Infrared radiation can be used to remotely determine the temperature of objects (if the emissivity is known). This is termed thermography, or in the case of very hot objects in the NIR or visible it is termed pyrometry. Thermography (thermal imaging) is mainly used in military and industrial applications but the technology is reaching the public market in the form of infrared cameras on cars due to greatly reduced production costs.

Thermographic cameras detect radiation in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum (roughly 9,000–14,000 nm or 9–14 μm) and produce images of that radiation. Since infrared radiation is emitted by all objects based on their temperatures, according to the black-body radiation law, thermography makes it possible to &quot;see&quot; one&#x27;s environment with or without visible illumination. The amount of radiation emitted by an object increases with temperature, therefore thermography allows one to see variations in temperature (hence the name).

=== Hyperspectral imaging ===


A hyperspectral image is a &quot;picture&quot; containing continuous spectrum through a wide spectral range at each pixel. Hyperspectral imaging is gaining importance in the field of applied spectroscopy particularly with NIR, SWIR, MWIR, and LWIR spectral regions. Typical applications include biological, mineralogical, defence, and industrial measurements.

Thermal infrared hyperspectral imaging can be similarly performed using a thermographic camera, with the fundamental difference that each pixel contains a full LWIR spectrum. Consequently, chemical identification of the object can be performed without a need for an external light source such as the Sun or the Moon. Such cameras are typically applied for geological measurements, outdoor surveillance and UAV applications.

=== Other imaging ===

In infrared photography, infrared filters are used to capture the near-infrared spectrum. Digital cameras often use infrared blockers. Cheaper digital cameras and camera phones have less effective filters and can view intense near-infrared, appearing as a bright purple-white color. This is especially pronounced when taking pictures of subjects near IR-bright areas (such as near a lamp), where the resulting infrared interference can wash out the image. There is also a technique called &#x27;T-ray&#x27; imaging, which is imaging using far-infrared or terahertz radiation. Lack of bright sources can make terahertz photography more challenging than most other infrared imaging techniques. Recently T-ray imaging has been of considerable interest due to a number of new developments such as terahertz time-domain spectroscopy.
=== Tracking ===
Infrared tracking, also known as infrared homing, refers to a passive missile guidance system, which uses the emission from a target of electromagnetic radiation in the infrared part of the spectrum to track it. Missiles that use infrared seeking are often referred to as &quot;heat-seekers&quot; since infrared (IR) is just below the visible spectrum of light in frequency and is radiated strongly by hot bodies. Many objects such as people, vehicle engines, and aircraft generate and retain heat, and as such, are especially visible in the infrared wavelengths of light compared to objects in the background.

=== Heating ===

Infrared radiation can be used as a deliberate heating source. For example, it is used in infrared saunas to heat the occupants. It may also be used in other heating applications, such as to remove ice from the wings of aircraft (de-icing).

Infrared heating is also becoming more popular in industrial manufacturing processes, e.g. curing of coatings, forming of plastics, annealing, plastic welding, and print drying. In these applications, infrared heaters replace convection ovens and contact heating.

=== Cooling ===

A variety of technologies or proposed technologies take advantage of infrared emissions to cool buildings or other systems. The LWIR (8–15 μm) region is especially useful since some radiation at these wavelengths can escape into space through the atmosphere&#x27;s infrared window. This is how passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) surfaces are able to achieve sub-ambient cooling temperatures under direct solar intensity, enhancing terrestrial heat flow to outer space with zero energy consumption or pollution. PDRC surfaces maximize shortwave solar reflectance to lessen heat gain while maintaining strong longwave infrared (LWIR) thermal radiation heat transfer. When imagined on a worldwide scale, this cooling method has been proposed as a way to slow and even reverse global warming, with some estimates proposing a global surface area coverage of 1-2% to balance global heat fluxes.

=== Communications ===

IR data transmission is also employed in short-range communication among computer peripherals and personal digital assistants. These devices usually conform to standards published by IrDA, the Infrared Data Association. Remote controls and IrDA devices use infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to emit infrared radiation that may be concentrated by a lens into a beam that the user aims at the detector. The beam is modulated, i.e. switched on and off, according to a code which the receiver interprets. Usually very near-IR is used (below 800 nm) for practical reasons. This wavelength is efficiently detected by inexpensive silicon photodiodes, which the receiver uses to convert the detected radiation to an electric current. That electrical signal is passed through a high-pass filter which retains the rapid pulsations due to the IR transmitter but filters out slowly changing infrared radiation from ambient light. Infrared communications are useful for indoor use in areas of high population density. IR does not penetrate walls and so does not interfere with other devices in adjoining rooms. Infrared is the most common way for remote controls to command appliances.
Infrared remote control protocols like RC-5, SIRC, are used to communicate with infrared.

Free-space optical communication using infrared lasers can be a relatively inexpensive way to install a communications link in an urban area operating at up to 4 gigabit/s, compared to the cost of burying fiber optic cable, except for the radiation damage. &quot;Since the eye cannot detect IR, blinking or closing the eyes to help prevent or reduce damage may not happen.&quot;

Infrared lasers are used to provide the light for optical fiber communications systems. Wavelengths around 1,330 nm (least dispersion) or 1,550 nm (best transmission) are the best choices for standard silica fibers.

IR data transmission of audio versions of printed signs is being researched as an aid for visually impaired people through the Remote infrared audible signage project.
Transmitting IR data from one device to another is sometimes referred to as beaming.

IR is sometimes used for assistive audio as an alternative to an audio induction loop.

=== Spectroscopy ===

Infrared vibrational spectroscopy (see also near-infrared spectroscopy) is a technique that can be used to identify molecules by analysis of their constituent bonds. Each chemical bond in a molecule vibrates at a frequency characteristic of that bond. A group of atoms in a molecule (e.g., CH2) may have multiple modes of oscillation caused by the stretching and bending motions of the group as a whole. If an oscillation leads to a change in dipole in the molecule then it will absorb a photon that has the same frequency. The vibrational frequencies of most molecules correspond to the frequencies of infrared light. Typically, the technique is used to study organic compounds using light radiation from the mid-infrared, 4,000–400 cm−1. A spectrum of all the frequencies of absorption in a sample is recorded. This can be used to gain information about the sample composition in terms of chemical groups present and also its purity (for example, a wet sample will show a broad O-H absorption around 3200 cm−1). The unit for expressing radiation in this application, cm−1, is the spectroscopic wavenumber. It is the frequency divided by the speed of light in vacuum.

=== Thin film metrology ===

In the semiconductor industry, infrared light can be used to characterize materials such as thin films and periodic trench structures. By measuring the reflectance of light from the surface of a semiconductor wafer, the index of refraction (n) and the extinction Coefficient (k) can be determined via the Forouhi–Bloomer dispersion equations. The reflectance from the infrared light can also be used to determine the critical dimension, depth, and sidewall angle of high aspect ratio trench structures.

=== Meteorology ===
Weather satellites equipped with scanning radiometers produce thermal or infrared images, which can then enable a trained analyst to determine cloud heights and types, to calculate land and surface water temperatures, and to locate ocean surface features. The scanning is typically in the range 10.3–12.5 μm (IR4 and IR5 channels).

Clouds with high and cold tops, such as cyclones or cumulonimbus clouds, are often displayed as red or black, lower warmer clouds such as stratus or stratocumulus are displayed as blue or grey, with intermediate clouds shaded accordingly. Hot land surfaces are shown as dark-grey or black. One disadvantage of infrared imagery is that low clouds such as stratus or fog can have a temperature similar to the surrounding land or sea surface and do not show up. However, using the difference in brightness of the IR4 channel (10.3–11.5 μm) and the near-infrared channel (1.58–1.64 μm), low clouds can be distinguished, producing a &quot;fog&quot; satellite picture. The main advantage of infrared is that images can be produced at night, allowing a continuous sequence of weather to be studied.

These infrared pictures can depict ocean eddies or vortices and map currents such as the Gulf Stream, which are valuable to the shipping industry. Fishermen and farmers are interested in knowing land and water temperatures to protect their crops against frost or increase their catch from the sea. Even El Niño phenomena can be spotted. Using color-digitized techniques, the gray-shaded thermal images can be converted to color for easier identification of desired information.

The main water vapour channel at 6.40 to 7.08 μm can be imaged by some weather satellites and shows the amount of moisture in the atmosphere.
=== Climatology ===
In the field of climatology, atmospheric infrared radiation is monitored to detect trends in the energy exchange between the Earth and the atmosphere. These trends provide information on long-term changes in Earth&#x27;s climate. It is one of the primary parameters studied in research into global warming, together with solar radiation.

A pyrgeometer is utilized in this field of research to perform continuous outdoor measurements. This is a broadband infrared radiometer with sensitivity for infrared radiation between approximately 4.5 μm and 50 μm.

=== Astronomy ===

Astronomers observe objects in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum using optical components, including mirrors, lenses and solid state digital detectors. For this reason it is classified as part of optical astronomy. To form an image, the components of an infrared telescope need to be carefully shielded from heat sources, and the detectors are chilled using liquid helium.

The sensitivity of Earth-based infrared telescopes is significantly limited by water vapor in the atmosphere, which absorbs a portion of the infrared radiation arriving from space outside of selected atmospheric windows. This limitation can be partially alleviated by placing the telescope observatory at a high altitude, or by carrying the telescope aloft with a balloon or an aircraft. Space telescopes do not suffer from this handicap, and so outer space is considered the ideal location for infrared astronomy.

The infrared portion of the spectrum has several useful benefits for astronomers. Cold, dark molecular clouds of gas and dust in our galaxy will glow with radiated heat as they are irradiated by imbedded stars. Infrared can also be used to detect protostars before they begin to emit visible light. Stars emit a smaller portion of their energy in the infrared spectrum, so nearby cool objects such as planets can be more readily detected. (In the visible light spectrum, the glare from the star will drown out the reflected light from a planet.)

Infrared light is also useful for observing the cores of active galaxies, which are often cloaked in gas and dust. Distant galaxies with a high redshift will have the peak portion of their spectrum shifted toward longer wavelengths, so they are more readily observed in the infrared.

=== Cleaning ===

Infrared cleaning is a technique used by some motion picture film scanners, film scanners and flatbed scanners to reduce or remove the effect of dust and scratches upon the finished scan. It works by collecting an additional infrared channel from the scan at the same position and resolution as the three visible color channels (red, green, and blue). The infrared channel, in combination with the other channels, is used to detect the location of scratches and dust. Once located, those defects can be corrected by scaling or replaced by inpainting.

=== Art conservation and analysis ===

Infrared reflectography can be applied to paintings to reveal underlying layers in a non-destructive manner, in particular the artist&#x27;s underdrawing or outline drawn as a guide. Art conservators use the technique to examine how the visible layers of paint differ from the underdrawing or layers in between (such alterations are called pentimenti when made by the original artist). This is very useful information in deciding whether a painting is the prime version by the original artist or a copy, and whether it has been altered by over-enthusiastic restoration work. In general, the more pentimenti, the more likely a painting is to be the prime version. It also gives useful insights into working practices. Reflectography often reveals the artist&#x27;s use of carbon black, which shows up well in reflectograms, as long as it has not also been used in the ground underlying the whole painting.
Recent progress in the design of infrared-sensitive cameras makes it possible to discover and depict not only underpaintings and pentimenti, but entire paintings that were later overpainted by the artist. Notable examples are Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Woman Ironing&quot; and &quot;Blue Room&quot;, where in both cases a portrait of a man has been made visible under the painting as it is known today.

Similar uses of infrared are made by conservators and scientists on various types of objects, especially very old written documents such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Roman works in the Villa of the Papyri, and the Silk Road texts found in the Dunhuang Caves. Carbon black used in ink can show up extremely well.

=== Biological systems ===


The pit viper has a pair of infrared sensory pits on its head. There is uncertainty regarding the exact thermal sensitivity of this biological infrared detection system.

Other organisms that have thermoreceptive organs are pythons (family Pythonidae), some boas (family Boidae), the Common Vampire Bat (&quot;Desmodus rotundus&quot;), a variety of jewel beetles (&quot;Melanophila acuminata&quot;), darkly pigmented butterflies (&quot;Pachliopta aristolochiae&quot; and &quot;Troides rhadamantus plateni&quot;), and possibly blood-sucking bugs (&quot;Triatoma infestans&quot;). By detecting the heat that their prey emits, crotaline and boid snakes identify and capture their prey using their IR-sensitive pit organs. Comparably, IR-sensitive pits on the Common Vampire Bat (&quot;Desmodus rotundus&quot;) aid in the identification of blood-rich regions on its warm-blooded victim. The jewel beetle, &quot;Melanophila acuminata&quot;, locates forest fires via infrared pit organs, where on recently burnt trees, they deposit their eggs. Thermoreceptors on the wings and antennae of butterflies with dark pigmentation, such &quot;Pachliopta aristolochiae&quot; and &quot;Troides rhadamantus plateni&quot;, shield them from heat damage as they sunbathe in the sun. Additionally, it&#x27;s hypothesised that thermoreceptors let bloodsucking bugs (&quot;Triatoma infestans&quot;) locate their warm-blooded victims by sensing their body heat.

Some fungi like &quot;Venturia inaequalis&quot; require near-infrared light for ejection.

Although near-infrared vision (780–1,000 nm) has long been deemed impossible due to noise in visual pigments, sensation of near-infrared light was reported in the common carp and in three cichlid species. Fish use NIR to capture prey and for phototactic swimming orientation. NIR sensation in fish may be relevant under poor lighting conditions during twilight and in turbid surface waters.

=== Photobiomodulation ===

Near-infrared light, or photobiomodulation, is used for treatment of chemotherapy-induced oral ulceration as well as wound healing. There is some work relating to anti-herpes virus treatment. Research projects include work on central nervous system healing effects via cytochrome c oxidase upregulation and other possible mechanisms.

=== Health hazards ===

Strong infrared radiation in certain industry high-heat settings may be hazardous to the eyes, resulting in damage or blindness to the user. Since the radiation is invisible, special IR-proof goggles must be worn in such places.

== Scientific history ==

The discovery of infrared radiation is ascribed to William Herschel, the astronomer, in the early 19th century. Herschel published his results in 1800 before the Royal Society of London. Herschel used a prism to refract light from the sun and detected the infrared, beyond the red part of the spectrum, through an increase in the temperature recorded on a thermometer. He was surprised at the result and called them &quot;Calorific Rays&quot;. The term &quot;infrared&quot; did not appear until late 19th century. An earlier experiment in 1790 by Marc-Auguste Pictet demonstrated the reflection and focusing of radiant heat via mirrors in the absence of visible light.

<text>In geometry, an icosidodecahedron or pentagonal gyrobirotunda is a polyhedron with twenty (&quot;icosi-&quot;) triangular faces and twelve (&quot;dodeca-&quot;) pentagonal faces. An icosidodecahedron has 30 identical vertices, with two triangles and two pentagons meeting at each, and 60 identical edges, each separating a triangle from a pentagon. As such, it is one of the Archimedean solids and more particularly, a quasiregular polyhedron.

== Construction ==
One way to construct the icosidodecahedron is to start with two pentagonal rotunda by attaching them to their bases. These rotundas cover their decagonal base so that the resulting polyhedron has 32 faces, 30 vertices, and 60 edges. This construction is similar to one of the Johnson solids, the pentagonal orthobirotunda. The difference is that the icosidodecahedron is constructed by twisting its rotundas by 36°, a process known as gyration, resulting in the pentagonal face connecting to the triangular one. The icosidodecahedron has an alternative name, &quot;pentagonal gyrobirotunda&quot;.
Convenient Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of an icosidodecahedron with unit edges are given by the even permutations of:
formula_1
where denotes the golden ratio.

== Properties ==
The surface area of an icosidodecahedron can be determined by calculating the area of all pentagonal faces. The volume of an icosidodecahedron can be determined by slicing it off into two pentagonal rotunda, after which summing up their volumes. Therefore, its surface area and volume can be formulated as:
formula_2

The dihedral angle of an icosidodecahedron between pentagon-to-triangle is
formula_3
determined by calculating the angle of a pentagonal rotunda.

An icosidodecahedron has icosahedral symmetry, and its first stellation is the compound of a dodecahedron and its dual icosahedron, with the vertices of the icosidodecahedron located at the midpoints of the edges of either.

The icosidodecahedron is an Archimedean solid, meaning it is a highly symmetric and semi-regular polyhedron, and two or more different regular polygonal faces meet in a vertex. The polygonal faces that meet for every vertex are two equilateral triangles and two regular pentagons, and the vertex figure of an icosidodecahedron is {{nowrap|(3·5)2 {{=}} 32·52}. Its dual polyhedron is rhombic triacontahedron, a Catalan solid.{{r|williams}}

 | image1 = Polyhedron 12-20, davinci.png
 | image2 = Spherical icosidodecahedron with colored cicles.png
 | footer = The 60 edges form 6 decagons corresponding to great circles in the spherical tiling.
The icosidodecahedron has 6 central decagons. Projected into a sphere, they define 6 great circles. {{harvtxt|Fuller|1975}} used these 6 great circles, along with 15 and 10 others in two other polyhedra to define his 31 great circles of the spherical icosahedron.{{r|fuller}}

The long radius (center to vertex) of the icosidodecahedron is in the golden ratio to its edge length; thus its radius is {{mvar|φ}} if its edge length is 1, and its edge length is {{math|{{sfrac|1|&quot;φ&quot;}}}} if its radius is 1.{{r|williams}} Only a few uniform polytopes have this property, including the four-dimensional 600-cell, the three-dimensional icosidodecahedron, and the two-dimensional decagon. (The icosidodecahedron is the equatorial cross-section of the 600-cell, and the decagon is the equatorial cross-section of the icosidodecahedron.) These &quot;radially golden&quot; polytopes can be constructed, with their radii, from golden triangles which meet at the center, each contributing two radii and an edge.

==Related polytopes==
The icosidodecahedron is a rectified dodecahedron and also a rectified icosahedron, existing as the full-edge truncation between these regular solids.

The icosidodecahedron contains 12 pentagons of the dodecahedron and 20 triangles of the icosahedron:
{{Icosahedral truncations}}

The icosidodecahedron exists in a sequence of symmetries of quasiregular polyhedra and tilings with vertex configurations (3.&quot;n&quot;)2, progressing from tilings of the sphere to the Euclidean plane and into the hyperbolic plane. With orbifold notation symmetry of *&quot;n&quot;32 all of these tilings are wythoff construction within a fundamental domain of symmetry, with generator points at the right angle corner of the domain.

=== Related polyhedra ===

The truncated cube can be turned into an icosidodecahedron by dividing the octagons into two pentagons and two triangles. It has pyritohedral symmetry.

Eight uniform star polyhedra share the same vertex arrangement. Of these, two also share the same edge arrangement: the small icosihemidodecahedron (having the triangular faces in common), and the small dodecahemidodecahedron (having the pentagonal faces in common). The vertex arrangement is also shared with the compounds of five octahedra and of five tetrahemihexahedra.
=== Related polychora ===

In four-dimensional geometry, the icosidodecahedron appears in the regular 600-cell as the equatorial slice that belongs to the vertex-first passage of the 600-cell through 3D space. In other words: the 30 vertices of the 600-cell which lie at arc distances of 90 degrees on its circumscribed hypersphere from a pair of opposite vertices, are the vertices of an icosidodecahedron. The wireframe figure of the 600-cell consists of 72 flat regular decagons. Six of these are the equatorial decagons to a pair of opposite vertices, and these six form the wireframe figure of an icosidodecahedron.

If a 600-cell is stereographically projected to 3-space about any vertex and all points are normalised, the geodesics upon which edges fall comprise the icosidodecahedron&#x27;s barycentric subdivision.

== Graph ==
The skeleton of an icosidodecahedron can be represented as the graph with 30 vertices and 60 edges, one of the Archimedean graphs. It is quartic, meaning that each of its vertex is connected by four other vertices.

== Applications ==
The icosidodecahedron may appear in structures, as in the geodesic dome or the Hoberman sphere.

Icosidodecahedra can be found in all eukaryotic cells, including human cells, as Sec13/31 COPII coat-protein formations.{{r|rs}}

The icosidodecahedron may also found in popular culture. In Star Trek universe, the Vulcan game of logic Kal-Toh has the goal of creating a shape with two nested holographic icosidodecahedra joined at the midpoints of their segments.

<text>ISO 8601 is an international standard covering the worldwide exchange and communication of date and time-related data. It is maintained by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was first published in 1988, with updates in 1991, 2000, 2004, and 2019, and an amendment in 2022. The standard provides a well-defined, unambiguous method of representing calendar dates and times in worldwide communications, especially to avoid misinterpreting numeric dates and times when such data is transferred between countries with different conventions for writing numeric dates and times.

ISO 8601 applies to these representations and formats: &quot;dates&quot;, in the Gregorian calendar (including the proleptic Gregorian calendar); &quot;times&quot;, based on the 24-hour timekeeping system, with optional UTC offset; &quot;time intervals&quot;; and combinations thereof. The standard does not assign specific meaning to any element of the dates/times represented: the meaning of any element depends on the context of its use. Dates and times represented cannot use words that do not have a specified numerical meaning within the standard (thus excluding names of years in the Chinese calendar), or that do not use computer characters (excludes images or sounds).

In representations that adhere to the ISO 8601 &quot;interchange standard&quot;, dates and times are arranged such that the greatest temporal term (typically a year) is placed at the left and each successively lesser term is placed to the right of the previous term. Representations must be written in a combination of Arabic numerals and the specific computer characters (such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;:&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;) that are assigned specific meanings within the standard; that is, such commonplace descriptors of dates (or parts of dates) as &quot;January&quot;, &quot;Thursday&quot;, or &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot; are not allowed in interchange representations within the standard.

==History==
The first edition of the ISO 8601 standard was published as &quot;ISO 8601:1988&quot; in 1988. It unified and replaced a number of older ISO standards on various aspects of date and time notation: ISO 2014, ISO 2015, ISO 2711, ISO 3307, and ISO 4031. It has been superseded by a second edition &quot;ISO 8601:2000&quot; in 2000, by a third edition &quot;ISO 8601:2004&quot; published on 1 December 2004, and withdrawn and revised by &quot;ISO 8601-1:2019&quot; and &quot;ISO 8601-2:2019&quot; on 25 February 2019. ISO 8601 was prepared by, and is under the direct responsibility of, ISO Technical Committee TC 154.

ISO 2014, though superseded, is the standard that originally introduced the all-numeric date notation in most-to-least-significant order . The ISO week numbering system was introduced in ISO 2015, and the identification of days by ordinal dates was originally defined in ISO 2711.

Issued in February 2019, the fourth revision of the standard ISO 8601-1:2019 represents slightly updated contents of the previous ISO 8601:2004 standard, whereas the new ISO 8601-2:2019 defines various extensions such as uncertainties or parts of the Extended Date/Time Format (EDTF).

An amendment was published in October 2022 featuring minor technical clarifications and attempts to remove ambiguities in definitions. The most significant change, however, was the reintroduction of the &quot;24:00:00&quot; format to refer to the instant at the &quot;end&quot; of a calendar day.

==General principles==
*Date and time values are ordered from the largest to smallest unit of time: year, month (or week), day, hour, minute, second, and fraction of second. The lexicographical order of the representation thus corresponds to chronological order, except for date representations involving negative years or time offset. This allows dates to be naturally sorted by, for example, file systems.
*Each date and time value has a fixed number of digits that must be padded with leading zeros.
*Representations can be done in one of two formatsa &quot;basic format&quot; with a minimal number of separators or an &quot;extended format&quot; with separators added to enhance human readability. The standard notes that &quot;The basic format should be avoided in plain text.&quot; The separator used between date values (year, month, week, and day) is the hyphen, while the colon is used as the separator between time values (hours, minutes, and seconds). For example, the 6th day of the 1st month of the year 2009 may be written as in the extended format or as &quot;20090106&quot; in the basic format without ambiguity.
* For reduced precision, any number of values may be dropped from any of the date and time representations, but in the order from the least to the most significant. For example, &quot;2004-05&quot; is a valid ISO 8601 date, which indicates May (the fifth month) 2004. This format will never represent the 5th day of an unspecified month in 2004, nor will it represent a time-span extending from 2004 into 2005.
*If necessary for a particular application, the standard supports the addition of a decimal fraction to the smallest time value in the representation.

==Dates==

The standard uses the Gregorian calendar, which &quot;serves as an international standard for civil use&quot;.

ISO 8601 allows Gregorian dates from the introduction of the calendar on 15 October 1582. For earlier (pre-Gregorian) dates, the calendar may be extended before its introduction (the proleptic Gregorian calendar) by explicit agreement of the parties involved. Such proleptic dates may not be adjusted to reconcile them with Julian dates.

===Years===

ISO 8601 prescribes, as a minimum, a four-digit year [YYYY] to avoid the year 2000 problem. It therefore represents years from 0000 to 9999, year 0000 being equal to 1 BC and all others AD, similar to astronomical year numbering. However, years before 1583 (the first full year following the introduction of the Gregorian calendar) are not automatically allowed by the standard. Instead, the standard states that &quot;values in the range [0000] through [1582] shall only be used by mutual agreement of the partners in information interchange&quot;.

To represent years before 0000 or after 9999, the standard also permits the expansion of the year representation but only by prior agreement between the sender and the receiver. An expanded year representation [±YYYYY] must have an agreed-upon number of extra year digits beyond the four-digit minimum, and it must be prefixed with a + or − sign instead of the more common AD/BC (or CE/BCE) notation; by convention 1 BC is labelled +0000, 2 BC is labeled −0001, and so on.

===Calendar dates===
Calendar date representations are in the form shown in the adjacent box. [YYYY] indicates a four-digit year, 0000 through 9999. [MM] indicates a two-digit month of the year, 01 through 12. [DD] indicates a two-digit day of that month, 01 through 31. For example, &quot;5 April 1981&quot; may be represented as either in the &quot;extended format&quot; or &quot;19810405&quot; in the &quot;basic format&quot;.

The standard also allows for calendar dates to be written with reduced precision. For example, one may write to mean &quot;1981 April&quot;. One may simply write &quot;1981&quot; to refer to that year, &quot;198&quot; to refer to the decade from 1980 to 1989 inclusive, or &quot;19&quot; to refer to the century from 1900 to 1999 inclusive. Although the standard allows both the and YYYYMMDD formats for complete calendar date representations, if the day [DD] is omitted then only the format is allowed. By disallowing dates of the form YYYYMM, the standard avoids confusion with the truncated representation YYMMDD (still often used). The 2000 version also allowed writing the truncation to mean &quot;April 5&quot; but the 2004 version does not allow omitting the year when a month is present.

Examples:

* 7 January 2000 can be written as &quot;2000-01-07&quot; or &quot;20000107&quot;

===Week dates===
Week date representations are in the formats as shown in the adjacent box. [YYYY] indicates the &quot;ISO week-numbering year&quot; which is slightly different from the traditional Gregorian calendar year (see below). [Www] is the &quot;week number&quot; prefixed by the letter &quot;W&quot;, from W01 through W53. [D] is the &quot;weekday number&quot;, from 1 through 7, beginning with Monday and ending with Sunday.

There are several mutually equivalent and compatible descriptions of week 01:
* the week with the first business day in the starting year (considering that Saturdays, Sundays and 1 January are non-working days),
* the week with the starting year&#x27;s first Thursday in it (the formal ISO definition),
* the week with 4 January in it,
* the first week with the majority (four or more) of its days in the starting year, and
* the week starting with the Monday in the period 29 December to 4 January.

As a consequence, if 1 January is on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, it is in week 01. If 1 January is on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday, it is in week 52 or 53 of the previous year (there is no week 00). 28 December is always in the last week of its year.

The week number can be described by counting the Thursdays: week 12 contains the 12th Thursday of the year.

The &quot;ISO week-numbering year&quot; starts at the first day (Monday) of week 01 and ends at the Sunday before the new ISO year (hence without overlap or gap). It consists of 52 or 53 full weeks. The first ISO week of a year may have up to three days that are actually in the Gregorian calendar year that is ending; if three, they are Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Similarly, the last ISO week of a year may have up to three days that are actually in the Gregorian calendar year that is starting; if three, they are Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The Thursday of each ISO week is always in the Gregorian calendar year denoted by the ISO week-numbering year.

Examples:
* is written &quot;
* is written &quot;

===Ordinal dates===
An &quot;ordinal date&quot; is an ordinal format for the multiples of a day elapsed since the start of year.
It is represented as &quot;YYYY-DDD&quot; (or YYYYDDD), where [YYYY] indicates a year and [DDD] is the &quot;day of year&quot;, from 001 through 365 (366 in leap years). For example, is the same as .

This simple form is preferable for occasions when the arbitrary nature of week and month definitions are more of an impediment than an aid, for instance, when comparing dates from different calendars. 
This format is used with simple hardware systems that have a need for a date system, but where including full calendar calculation software may be a significant nuisance. This system is sometimes referred to as &quot;Julian Date&quot;, but this can cause confusion with the astronomical Julian day, a sequential count of the number of days since day 0 beginning Greenwich noon, Julian proleptic calendar (or noon on ISO date which uses the Gregorian proleptic calendar with a year 0000).

==Times==
ISO 8601 uses the 24-hour clock system. As of ISO 8601-1:2019, the &quot;basic format&quot; is T[hh][mm][ss] and the &quot;extended format&quot; is T[hh]:[mm]:[ss]. Earlier versions omitted the T (representing time) in both formats.
*[hh] refers to a zero-padded hour between 00 and 24.
*[mm] refers to a zero-padded minute between 00 and 59.
*[ss] refers to a zero-padded second between 00 and 60 (where 60 is only used to denote an added leap second).
So a time might appear as either &quot;T134730&quot; in the &quot;basic format&quot; or &quot;T13:47:30&quot; in the &quot;extended format&quot;. ISO 8601-1:2019 allows the T to be omitted in the extended format, as in &quot;13:47:30&quot;, but only allows the T to be omitted in the basic format when there is no risk of confusion with date expressions.

Either the seconds, or the minutes and seconds, may be omitted from the basic or extended time formats for greater brevity but decreased precision; the resulting reduced precision time formats are:
*T[hh][mm] in &quot;basic format&quot; or T[hh]:[mm] in &quot;extended format&quot;, when seconds are omitted.
*T[hh], when both seconds and minutes are omitted.

As of ISO 8601-1:2019/Amd 1:2022, &quot;00:00:00&quot; may be used to refer to &quot;midnight&quot; corresponding to the instant at the beginning of a calendar day; and &quot;24:00:00&quot; to refer to midnight corresponding to the instant at the end of a calendar day. ISO 8601-1:2019 as originally published removed &quot;24:00:00&quot; as a representation for the end of day although it had been permitted in earlier versions of the standard.

A decimal fraction may be added to the lowest order time element present in any of these representations. A decimal mark, either a comma or a dot on the baseline, is used as a separator between the time element and its fraction. (Following ISO 80000-1 according to ISO 8601:1-2019, it does not stipulate a preference except within International Standards, but with a preference for a comma according to ISO 8601:2004.)
For example, to denote &quot;14 hours, 30 and one half minutes&quot;, do not include a seconds figure; represent it as &quot;14:30,5&quot;, &quot;T1430,5&quot;, &quot;14:30.5&quot;, or &quot;T1430.5&quot;.

There is no limit on the number of decimal places for the decimal fraction. However, the number of decimal places needs to be agreed to by the communicating parties. For example, in Microsoft SQL Server, the precision of a decimal fraction is 3 for a DATETIME, i.e., &quot;yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss[.mmm]&quot;.

===Time zone designators===
Time zones in ISO 8601 are represented as local time (with the location unspecified), as UTC, or as an offset from UTC.

====Local time (unqualified)====
If no UTC relation information is given with a time representation, the time is assumed to be in local time. While it &quot;may&quot; be safe to assume local time when communicating in the same time zone, it is ambiguous when used in communicating across different time zones. Even within a single geographic time zone, some local times will be ambiguous if the region observes daylight saving time. It is usually preferable to indicate a time zone (zone designator) using the standard&#x27;s notation.

====Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)====
If the time is in UTC, add a &quot;Z&quot; directly after the time without a space. &quot;Z&quot; is the zone designator for the zero UTC offset. &quot;09:30 UTC&quot; is therefore represented as &quot;09:30Z&quot; or &quot;T0930Z&quot;. &quot;14:45:15 UTC&quot; would be &quot;14:45:15Z&quot; or &quot;T144515Z&quot;.

The &quot;Z&quot; suffix in the ISO 8601 time representation is sometimes referred to as &quot;Zulu time&quot; or &quot;Zulu meridian&quot; because the same letter is used to designate the Zulu time zone. However the ACP 121 standard that defines the list of military time zones makes no mention of UTC and derives the &quot;Zulu time&quot; from the Greenwich Mean Time which was formerly used as the international civil time standard. GMT is no longer precisely defined by the scientific community and can refer to either UTC or UT1 depending on context.

====Time offsets from UTC====
The UTC offset is appended directly to the time instead of &quot;Z&quot; suffix above; other nautical time zone letters are not used. The offset is applied to UTC to get the civil time in the designated time zone in the format &#x27;±[hh]:[mm]&#x27;, &#x27;±[hh][mm]&#x27;, or &#x27;±[hh]&#x27;.

A negative UTC offset describes a time zone west of the prime meridian where the civil time is behind UTC. So the zone designation for New York (on standard time) would be &quot;−05:00&quot;,&quot;−0500&quot;, or &quot;−05&quot;.
Conversely, a positive UTC offset describes a time zone east of the prime meridian where the civil time is ahead of UTC. So the zone designation for Cairo will be &quot;+02:00&quot;,&quot;+0200&quot;, or &quot;+02&quot;.

A time zone where the civil time coincides with UTC is always designated as positive, though the offset is zero (see related specifications below). So the zone designation for London (on standard time) would be &quot;+00:00&quot;, &quot;+0000&quot;, or &quot;+00&quot;.

=====Additional examples=====
* &quot;−10:00&quot; for Honolulu
* &quot;−06:00&quot; for Chicago on standard time, or Denver on daylight saving time
* &quot;−03:00&quot; for Brasília
* &quot;+01:00&quot; for London on British Summer Time
* &quot;+04:00&quot; for Dubai
* &quot;+05:30&quot; for India
* &quot;+09:00&quot; for Japan
See List of UTC offsets for other UTC offsets.

=====Other time offset specifications=====
It is not permitted to state a zero value time offset with a negative sign, as &quot;−00:00&quot;, &quot;−0000&quot;, or &quot;−00&quot;. The section dictating sign usage states that a plus sign must be used for a positive or zero value, and a minus sign for a negative value. A plus-minus-sign () may also be used if it is available. 

Contrary to this rule, RFC 3339, which is otherwise a profile of ISO 8601, permits the use of &quot;−00&quot; with the same denotation as &quot;+00&quot; but a differing connotation: an unknown UTC offset.

To represent a negative offset, ISO 8601 specifies using a minus sign (). If the interchange character set is limited and does not have a minus sign character, then the hyphen-minus should be used (). ASCII does not have a minus sign, so its hyphen-minus character (code 4510) would be used. If the character set has a minus sign, such as in Unicode, then that character should be used. The HTML character entity invocation for is codice_1.

ISO 8601-2:2019 allows for general durations for time offsets. For example, more precision can be added to the time offset with the format &#x27;&lt;time&gt;±[hh]:[mm]:[ss].[sss]&#x27; or &#x27;&lt;time&gt;±[n]H[n]M[n]S&#x27; as below.

==Combined date and time representations==
A single point in time can be represented by concatenating a complete date expression, the letter &quot;T&quot; as a delimiter, and a valid time expression. For example, . In ISO 8601:2004 it was permitted to omit the &quot;T&quot; character by mutual agreement as in , but this provision was removed in ISO 8601-1:2019.
Separating date and time parts with other characters such as space is not allowed in ISO 8601, but allowed in its profile RFC 3339.

If a time zone designator is required, it follows the combined date and time. For example, or .

Either basic or extended formats may be used, but both date and time must use the same format. The date expression may be calendar, week, or ordinal, and must use a complete representation. The time may be represented using a specified reduced precision format.

==Durations==

Durations define the amount of intervening time in a time interval and are represented by the format P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S or P[n]W as shown on the aside. In these representations, the [n] is replaced by the value for each of the date and time elements that follow the [n]. Leading zeros are not required, but the maximum number of digits for each element should be agreed to by the communicating parties. The capital letters &quot;P&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, and &quot;S&quot; are designators for each of the date and time elements and are not replaced.

*&quot;P&quot; is the duration designator (for &quot;period&quot;) placed at the start of the duration representation.
**&quot;Y&quot; is the year designator that follows the value for the number of calendar years.
**&quot;M&quot; is the month designator that follows the value for the number of calendar months.
**&quot;W&quot; is the week designator that follows the value for the number of weeks.
**&quot;D&quot; is the day designator that follows the value for the number of calendar days.
*&quot;T&quot; is the time designator that precedes the time components of the representation.
**&quot;H&quot; is the hour designator that follows the value for the number of hours.
**&quot;M&quot; is the minute designator that follows the value for the number of minutes.
**&quot;S&quot; is the second designator that follows the value for the number of seconds.

For example, &quot;P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S&quot; represents a duration of &quot;three years, six months, four days, twelve hours, thirty minutes, and five seconds&quot;.

Date and time elements including their designator may be omitted if their value is zero, and lower-order elements may also be omitted for reduced precision. For example, &quot;P23DT23H&quot; and &quot;P4Y&quot; are both acceptable duration representations. However, at least one element must be present, thus &quot;P&quot; is not a valid representation for a duration of 0 seconds. &quot;PT0S&quot; or &quot;P0D&quot;, however, are both valid and represent the same duration.

To resolve ambiguity, &quot;P1M&quot; is a one-month duration and &quot;PT1M&quot; is a one-minute duration (note the time designator, T, that precedes the time value). The smallest value used may also have a decimal fraction, as in &quot;P0.5Y&quot; to indicate half a year. This decimal fraction may be specified with either a comma or a full stop, as in &quot;P0,5Y&quot; or &quot;P0.5Y&quot;. The standard does not prohibit date and time values in a duration representation from exceeding their &quot;carry over points&quot; except as noted below. Thus, &quot;PT36H&quot; could be used as well as &quot;P1DT12H&quot; for representing the same duration. But keep in mind that &quot;PT36H&quot; is not the same as &quot;P1DT12H&quot; when switching from or to Daylight saving time.

Alternatively, a format for duration based on combined date and time representations may be used by agreement between the communicating parties either in the basic format PYYYYMMDDThhmmss or in the extended format . For example, the first duration shown above would be . However, individual date and time values cannot exceed their moduli (e.g. a value of 13 for the month or 25 for the hour would not be permissible).

The standard describes a duration as part of time intervals, which are discussed in the next section. The duration format on its own is ambiguous regarding the total number of days in a calendar year and calendar month. The number of seconds in a calendar day is also ambiguous because of leap seconds. For example &quot;P1M&quot; on its own could be 28, 29, 30, or 31 days. There is no ambiguity when used in a time interval. Using example &quot;P2M&quot; duration of two calendar months:

* interval 2003-02-15T00:00:00Z/P2M ends two calendar months later at 2003-04-15T00:00:00Z which is 59 days later
* interval 2003-07-15T00:00:00Z/P2M ends two calendar months later at 2003-09-15T00:00:00Z which is 62 days later
The duration format (or a subset thereof) is widely used independent of time intervals, as with the Java 8 Duration class which supports a subset of the duration format.

==Time intervals==

A time interval is the intervening time between two time points. The amount of intervening time is expressed by a duration (as described in the previous section). The two time points (start and end) are expressed by either a combined date and time representation or just a date representation.

There are four ways to express a time interval:

#Start and end, such as &quot;2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z&quot;
#Start and duration, such as &quot;2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/P1Y2M10DT2H30M&quot;
#Duration and end, such as &quot;P1Y2M10DT2H30M/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z&quot;
#Duration only, such as &quot;P1Y2M10DT2H30M&quot;, with additional context information

Of these, the first three require two values separated by an &quot;interval designator&quot; which is usually a solidus (more commonly referred to as a forward slash &quot;/&quot;). Section 3.2.6 of ISO 8601-1:2019 notes that &quot;A solidus may be replaced by a double hyphen [&quot;--&quot;] by mutual agreement of the communicating partners&quot;, and previous versions used notations like &quot;2000--2002&quot;. Use of a double hyphen instead of a solidus allows inclusion in computer filenames; in common operating systems, a solidus is a reserved character and is not allowed in a filename.

For &lt;start&gt;/&lt;end&gt; expressions, if any elements are missing from the end value, they are assumed to be the same as for the start value including the time zone. This feature of the standard allows for concise representations of time intervals. For example, the date of a two-hour meeting including the start and finish times could be shown as &quot;2007-12-14T13:30/15:30&quot;, where &quot;/15:30&quot; implies &quot;/2007-12-14T15:30&quot; (the same date as the start), or the beginning and end dates of a monthly billing period as &quot;2008-02-15/03-14&quot;, where &quot;/03-14&quot; implies &quot;/2008-03-14&quot; (the same year as the start).

If greater precision is desirable to represent the time interval, then more time elements can be added to the representation. An interval denoted can start at any time on and end at any time on , whereas includes the start and end times.
To explicitly include all of the start and end dates, the interval would be represented as .

===Repeating intervals===

Repeating intervals are specified in clause &quot;4.5 Recurring time interval&quot;. They are formed by adding &quot;R[n]/&quot; to the beginning of an interval expression, where &quot;R&quot; is used as the letter itself and [n] is replaced by the number of repetitions. Leaving out the value for [n] or specifying a value of -1, means an unbounded number of repetitions. A value of 0 for [n] means the interval is not repeated.

If the interval specifies the start (forms 1 and 2 above), then this is the start of the repeating interval. If the interval specifies the end but not the start (form 3 above), then this is the end of the repeating interval. For example, to repeat the interval of &quot;P1Y2M10DT2H30M&quot; five times starting at , use .

==Truncated representations (deprecated)==
ISO 8601:2000 allowed truncation (by agreement), where leading components of a date or time are omitted. Notably, this allowed two-digit years to be used as well as the ambiguous formats YY-MM-DD and YYMMDD. This provision was removed in ISO 8601:2004.

The first and seventh examples given above omit the leading codice_2 for century. Other formats have one leading codice_2 per omitted century, year, month, week, hour and minute as necessary to disambiguate the format.

== Standardised extensions==
ISO 8601-2:2019 defines a set of standardised extensions to the ISO 8601 date and time formats.

; Extended Date/Time Format (EDTF)
: The EDTF is given as an example of a profile of ISO 8601. Some of its features are:
:* Uncertain and approximate qualifiers, &#x27;?&#x27; and &#x27;~&#x27;, as well as their combined used, &#x27;%&#x27;; they can be applied to the whole date or to individual components.
:* Time intervals with an open (unbounded) end or an unknown end.
:* Exponential and significant figure notation in years.
:* Special &quot;month&quot; values indicating sub-year groupings such as seasons and quarters.
:* Syntax for serializing a list of dates.
: The EDTF features are described in the &quot;Date and Time Extensions&quot; section of ISO 8601-2:2019.

; Repeat rules for recurring time intervals
: ISO 8601-2:2019 also defines a format to constrain repeating intervals based on syntax from iCalendar.

==Implementations==

GNU CoreUtils&#x27;s date command has implement an --iso-8601 option among other formating patterns:
$ date --iso-8601=ns

2025-02-16T12:03:17,646296349+01:00

$ date -u --rfc-3339=ns

2025-02-16 10:58:44.966864492+00:00

$ date -u +&quot;%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%6NZ&quot;

2025-02-16T10:58:44.965071Z

==Usage==
On the Internet, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) uses the IETF standard based on ISO 8601 in defining a profile of the standard that restricts the supported date and time formats to reduce the chance of error and the complexity of software. The very simple specification is based on a draft of the RFC 3339 mentioned below.

ISO 8601 is referenced by several specifications, but the full range of options of ISO 8601 is not always used. For example, the various electronic program guide standards for TV, digital radio, etc. use several forms to describe points in time and durations. The ID3 audio meta-data specification also makes use of a subset of ISO 8601.
The X.690 encoding standard&#x27;s GeneralizedTime makes use of another subset of ISO 8601.

=== Commerce ===
As of 2006, the ISO week date appears in its basic form on major brand commercial packaging in the United States. Its appearance depended on the particular packaging, canning, or bottling plant more than any particular brand. The format is particularly useful for quality assurance, so that production errors can be readily traced.

=== RFCs ===
IETF RFC 3339 defines a profile of ISO 8601 for use in Internet protocols and standards. It explicitly excludes durations and dates before the common era. The more complex formats such as week numbers and ordinal days are not permitted.

RFC 3339 deviates from ISO 8601 in allowing a zero time zone offset to be specified as &quot;-00:00&quot;, which ISO 8601 forbids. RFC 3339 intends &quot;-00:00&quot; to carry the connotation that it is not stating a preferred time zone, whereas the conforming &quot;+00:00&quot; or any non-zero offset connotes that the offset being used is preferred. This convention regarding &quot;-00:00&quot; is derived from earlier RFCs, such as RFC 2822 which uses it for timestamps in email headers. RFC 2822 made no claim that any part of its timestamp format conforms to ISO 8601, and so was free to use this convention without conflict.

Building upon the foundations of RFC 3339, the IETF introduced the Internet Extended Date/Time Format (IXDTF) in RFC 9557. This format extends the timestamp representation to include additional information such as an associated time zone name. The inclusion of time zone names is particularly useful for applications that need to account for events like daylight saving time transitions. Furthermore, IXDTF maintains compatibility with pre-existing syntax for attaching time zone names to timestamps, providing a standardized and flexible approach to timestamp representation on the internet. Example:

codice_4

<text>The International Seabed Authority (ISA) () is a Kingston, Jamaica-based intergovernmental body of 167 member states and the European Union. It was established under the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and its 1994 Agreement on Implementation. The ISA&#x27;s dual mission is to authorize and control the development of mineral related operations in the international seabed, which is considered the &quot;common heritage of all mankind&quot;, and to protect the ecosystem of the seabed, ocean floor and subsoil in &quot;The Area&quot; beyond national jurisdiction. The ISA is responsible for safeguarding the international deep sea, defined as waters below 200 meters (656 feet), where photosynthesis is hampered by inadequate light. Governing approximately half of the total area of the world&#x27;s oceans, the ISA oversees activities that might threaten biological diversity and harm the marine environment. 

Since its inception in 1994, the ISA has approved over two dozen ocean floor mining exploration contracts in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. The majority of these contracts are for exploration in the Clarion–Clipperton zone between Hawaii and Mexico, where polymetallic nodules contain copper, cobalt and other minerals essential for powering electric batteries. To date, the Authority has not authorized any commercial mining contracts as it continues to deliberate over regulations amid global calls for a moratorium on deep sea mining. Scientists and environmentalists warn that such mining could wreak havoc on the ocean, a crucial carbon sink and home to rare and diverse species.

Funded by UNCLOS members and mining contractors, the Authority operates as an autonomous international organization with its own Assembly, Council, and Secretariat. The current Secretary-General of the agency is Leticia Carvalho, whose four-year term began on 1 January 2025.

==Origin==
The Authority held its inaugural meeting in its host country, Jamaica, on 16 November 1994, the day the Convention came into force. The articles governing the Authority have been made &quot;noting the political and economic changes, including market-oriented approaches, affecting the implementation&quot; of the convention. The Authority obtained its observer status to the United Nations in October 1996. The Authority has 167 members and the European Union, composed of all parties to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The Authority operates by contracting with private and public corporations and other entities authorizing them to explore, and potentially exploit, specified areas on the deep seabed for mineral resources, such as cobalt, nickel and manganese.

=== &quot;Common Heritage of All Mankind&quot; ===
Under UNCLOS, Part XI, Section 2. &quot;The Area and its resources are the common heritage of mankind.&quot; As a result, ISA must ensure that activities in the Area are undertaken only for peaceful purposes and for the benefit of all humankind, with economic benefits shared equitably and special consideration given to the needs of developing nations.

=== Governance and operations ===
Along with a Secretary-General, two principal organs establish the policies and govern the work of the Authority: the Assembly, in which all UNCLOS parties are represented, and a 36-member Council elected by the Assembly.

==== Secretary-General ====
The Assembly elects a Secretary-General to serve a four-year term as the ISA&#x27;s chief administrative officer, oversee Authority staff and issue an annual report to the Assembly. The Secretary-General is prohibited from holding a financial interest in any mining operations authorized by the Authority.

There have been four Secretary-Generals since ISA&#x27;s creation in 1996:

==== Assembly ====
The Assembly, which consists of all members of the Authority, elects the 36-member Council, as well as the Secretary-General from among candidates the Council recommends. The Assembly also has the power to approve or reject the council&#x27;s recommendations for the following: rules and regulations governing seabed mining, distribution of financial benefits accrued from authorized mining and the Authority&#x27;s annual budget.

==== Council ====
The 36-member Council, elected by the Assembly, authorizes contracts with governments and private corporations to explore and mine the international seabed and sets rules and procedures, subject to the Assembly&#x27;s approval, for ISA governance. The council also nominates a Secretary-General, who then must be elected by the full Assembly to serve a four-year term. The ISA&#x27;s annual plenary sessions, which usually last two weeks, are held in Kingston.

==== Advisory bodies ====
Also established is a 30-member Legal and Technical Commission which advises the Council and a 15-member Finance Committee that deals with budgetary and related matters. All members are experts nominated by governments and elected to serve in their individual capacity.

==== Enterprise ====
The convention also established a body called the Enterprise which is to serve as the Authority&#x27;s own mining operator, potentially generating &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties&quot; to be shared with developing nations.&quot; The environmental organization Greenpeace has expressed concerns over the ISA&#x27;s alleged conflict of interest as both regulator and business operator, though the ISA denies the conflict of interest charge.

==Status==
The Authority has a Secretariat of 37 authorized posts and a 2022 biennial budget of approximately $10,000,000.

== Jurisdiction ==
UNCLOS defines the international seabed area—the part under ISA jurisdiction—as &quot;the seabed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction&quot; UNCLOS outlines the areas of national jurisdiction as a &quot;12 nautical-mile territorial sea; an exclusive economic zone of up to 200 nautical miles and a continental shelf&quot;, unless a nation can demonstrate that its continental shelf is naturally prolonged beyond that limit, in which case it may claim up to . ISA has no role in determining this boundary. Rather, this task is left to another body established by UNCLOS, the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, which examines scientific data submitted by coastal states that claim a broader reach. 
==Exploration contracts and commercial mining ==

=== Commercial ===
Although the ISA has yet to approve commercial mining contracts, the Authority anticipates commercial mining could begin as early as 2023–2024 with the completion of much-debated ISA regulations. In 2021, the Pacific Island nation of Nauru triggered a deadline that requires the ISA to approve final commercial mining regulations by July 2023 or allow contractors to mine under existing draft regulations.

=== Exploratory ===
Exploratory mining involves &quot;deep-sea mapping, manned submersibles or remotely-operated vehicles, photographic and video systems, and drilling devices.&quot;

==== Clarion–Clipperton zone ====
Most areas of exploration are in the Clarion–Clipperton zone (CCZ), in the Equatorial North Pacific Ocean, south and southeast of Hawaii, between Hawaii and Mexico. The quiet CCZ, as wide as the continental U.S., is home to polymetallic nodules or trillions of potato-size lumps of matter formed over millions of years that contain nickel, manganese, copper, zinc and cobalt, as well as deep water coral, sponges and unusual species (&quot;ghost octopus&quot;, crustaceans, worms and sea cucumbers) that in a near light-less environment attach to the rock-like nodules for shelter. Contractors want to mine polymetallic nodules for battery storage for electric vehicles, smartphones, and solar and wind energy.

==== Other areas of exploration ====
Exploration contracts for polymetallic nodules have also been issued for contractors operating in the Central Indian Ocean Basin and Western Pacific Ocean. The ISA has issued exploration contracts for polymetallic sulphides in the South West Indian Ridge, Central Indian Ridge and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and contracts for exploration for cobalt-rich crusts in the Western Pacific Ocean.

==== Requirements of contractors ====
Each contractor is required to develop a contingency plan should something go wrong during exploration, report annually on its activities in its assigned area and propose a training program for developing countries .

==== List of exploratory contractors ====
The ISA has signed 15-year contracts for exploration with 22 contractors seeking polymetallic nodules, polymetallic sulphides and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts in the deep seabed.

In 2001-2002 the ISA signed contracts with Yuzhmorgeologya (Russian Federation); Interoceanmetal Joint Organization (IOM) (Bulgaria, Cuba, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Poland and Russian Federation); the Government of the Republic of Korea; China Ocean Minerals Research and Development Association (COMRA) (China); Deep Ocean Resources Development Company (DORD) (Japan); Institut français de recherche pour l’exploitation de la mer (IFREMER) (France); the Government of India. In 2006, the Authority signed a 15-year contract with the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources of Germany.

In 2008, the Authority received two new applications for authorization to explore for polymetallic nodules, coming for the first time from private firms in developing island nations of the Pacific. Sponsored by their respective governments, they were submitted by Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. and Tonga Offshore Mining Limited. A 15-year exploration contract was granted by the Authority to Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. on 22 July 2011 and to Tonga Offshore Mining Limited on 12 January 2012.

Fifteen-year exploration contracts for polymetallic nodules were also granted to G-TECH Sea Mineral Resources NV (Belgium) on 14 January 2013; Marawa Research and Exploration Ltd (Kiribati) on 19 January 2015; Ocean Mineral Singapore Pte Ltd on 22 January 2015; UK Seabed Resources Ltd (two contracts on 8 February 2013 and 29 March 2016 respectively); Cook Islands Investment Corporation on 15 July 2016 and more recently China Minmetals Corporation on 12 May 2017.

The Authority has signed seven contracts for the exploration for polymetallic sulphides in the South West Indian Ridge, Central Indian Ridge and Mid-Atlantic Ridge with China Ocean Mineral Resources Research and Development Association (18 November 2011); the Government of Russia (29 October 2012); Government of the Republic of Korea (24 June 2014); Institut français de recherche pour l’exploitation de la mer (Ifremer, France, 18 November 2014); the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources of Germany (6 May 2015); and the Government of India (26 September 2016) and the Government of the Republic of Poland (12 February 2018).

The Authority holds five contracts for the exploration of cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts in the Western Pacific Ocean with China Ocean Mineral Resources Research and Development Association (29 April 2014); Japan Oil Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC, 27 January 2014); Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of the Russian Federation (10 March 2015), Companhia De Pesquisa de Recursos Minerais (9 November 2015) and the Government of the Republic of Korea (27 March 2018).

== Controversy ==

=== Environmental concerns and climate crisis ===
Environmentalists, scientists from 44 countries, Google, BMW and Volvo, World Wildlife Fund and several Pacific nations, including Fiji and Papua New Guinea, have called for a moratorium on deep-sea mining until more scientific research is conducted on its impact on the marine environment.

Advocates for deep sea mining argue extraction of rare metals is critical for electric car batteries necessary to develop a fossil-free economy.

Opponents argue seabed mining could wreak havoc on the world&#x27;s oceans, which act as a carbon sink absorbing a quarter of the world&#x27;s carbon emissions each year.

The environmental organization Greenpeace has raised objections about deep seabed mining disrupting the habitats of newly reported species, from crabs to whales to snails that survive without eating and congregate near bioluminescent thermal vents. Greenpeace has urged the ISA to further develop UNCLOS&#x27; foundational Article 136 principle &quot;of common heritage to all mankind&quot; to revise regulations and set conservation targets. In a 2018 Greenpeace Research Laboratories report the organization stressed the importance of protecting marine biodiversity from toxins released during seabed mining for natural gas and rare metals for photovoltaic cells. Greenpeace maintains the &quot;pro-exploitation&quot; ISA is not the appropriate authority to regulate deep sea mining (DSM). In 2019 Greenpeace activists protested outside the annual meeting of the International Seabed Authority in Jamaica, calling for a global ocean treaty to ban deep sea mining in ocean sanctuaries. Some of the activists had sailed to Jamaica aboard Greenpeace&#x27;s ship, the Esperanza, which travelled from the &quot;Lost City in the mid-Atlantic&quot;, an area Greenpeace says is threatened by exploratory mining the ISA authorized.

ISA Secretary-General Michael Lodge said Greenpeace&#x27;s support for a global ocean treaty, not the ISA, to control deep sea mining did not make sense.

=== Concern over transparency issues ===
In 2022, The Guardian reported the ISA failed to renew the contract for Earth Negotiations Bulletin (ENB), a division of the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), which covered past proceedings to maintain an independent record of the ISA. The decision came amid warnings from scientists that commercial ocean floor mining &quot;would be “dangerous”, “reckless” and “irreversible” in its harm to the ecosystem. In its defense, the ISA said ENB&#x27;s non-renewal was triggered by budget cuts. The Guardian also reported that Germany and environmentalists had raised questions about the lack of transparency by the ISA&#x27;s Legal and Technical Commission (LTC), which conducts closed meetings to set standards and issue guidelines for seabed mining.

In response to criticism, ISA Secretary-General Michael Lodge defended ISA as a &quot;transparent public forum of consensus-building.&quot;

=== Charges of conflict of interest ===
In 2022, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that the International Seabed Authority faced criticisms over conflicts of interest. The &quot;LA Times&quot; reported that the ISA was scheduled to approve seabed mining, despite concerns by scientists and environmentalists about the environmental impact. ISA head Michael Lodge had criticized these groups, saying there was &quot;a growing environmental absolutism and dogmatism bordering on fanaticism&quot; and arguing that seabed mining was &quot;predictable and manageable&quot;. Scientists and members of Lodge&#x27;s staff objected to Lodge&#x27;s appearance in a mining company video seeking investments in robotic exploration for minerals to manufacture electric vehicles. In the video, Lodge said his agency supported a 15-year exploration contract because &quot;land-based resources are becoming increasingly difficult to access.&quot;

=== United States&#x27; non-ratification of UNCLOS ===
The exact nature of the ISA&#x27;s mission and authority has been questioned by opponents of the Law of the Sea Treaty who are generally skeptical of multilateral engagement by the United States. In 2007, although the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted in favor of treaty ratification, the full Senate failed to ratify the treaty, with some Republicans arguing UNCLOS might threaten national security by interfering with ocean military operations and hinder seabed mining corporations by imposing environmental regulations.

One of the main anti-ratification arguments being a charge that the ISA is flawed or unnecessary. In its original form, the Convention included certain provisions that some found objectionable, such as:
* Use of collected money for wealth redistribution in addition to ISA administration
* Mandatory technology transfer

Because of these concerns, the United States pushed for modification of the Convention, obtaining a 1994 Agreement on Implementation that somewhat mitigates them and thus modifies the ISA&#x27;s authority. Despite this change the United States has not ratified the Convention and so is not a member of ISA, although it sends sizable delegations to participate in meetings as an observer.

As an observer, not an UNCLOS signatory, the U.S. will not be allowed to vote on approval of final commercial mining regulations and will be unable to sponsor companies to apply for contracts in international waters. This is because the ISA requires contractors be sponsored by a state that is a signatory to UNCLOS. U.S.-based military contractor Lockheed Martin, however, is participating in two British deep sea mining projects.

=== Palau&#x27;s advocacy against deep-sea mining ===
Palau was the first country to call for a moratorium, or precautionary pause, on deep-sea mining until the impact of such a practice is better understood. By July 10, 2023, 17 countries had called for a deep-sea mining moratorium or pause, including Germany, New Zealand, Spain, France, Sweden, Fiji, and the Federated States of Micronesia.

On July 29, 2024, President Surangel S. Whipps Jr. of Palau delivered an address titled &quot;Upholding the Common Heritage of Humankind&quot; to the 29th General Assembly of the International Seabed Authority (ISA) in Kingston, Jamaica. In his speech, President Whipps emphasized the importance of safeguarding the deep ocean from exploitation and modern-day colonialism. He highlighted Palau’s deep cultural and economic ties to the ocean and reiterated the call for an immediate moratorium on deep-sea mining, citing the associated environmental risks and uncertainties. In his speech he referred to the ocean as &quot;Our greatest ally in our fight against climate change,&quot; highlighting its role as the largest carbon sink on the planet. He underscored the critical role deep ocean ecosystems play in global environmental health and advocated for prioritizing long-term sustainability over short-term economic gains. He urged the assembly to act responsibly on behalf of future generations, reinforcing the deep seabed’s status as the &quot;common heritage of (hu)mankind.&quot;

The number of countries against the imminent start of mining for metallic nodules on the seafloor increased to 32 during the 29th ISA annual assembly, with Austria, Guatemala, Honduras, Malta, and Tuvalu joining the list.

==Activities==

=== Legislative ===
The Authority&#x27;s main legislative accomplishment has been the adoption, in the year 2000, of regulations governing exploration for polymetallic nodules. These resources, also called manganese nodules, contain varying amounts of manganese, cobalt, copper and nickel. They occur as potato-sized lumps scattered about on the surface of the ocean floor, mainly in the central Pacific Ocean in the Clarion–Clipperton zone but with some deposits in the Indian Ocean.

In 2013, the ISA approved amendments to its mining code on deep sea exploration, stating a prospector should take a precautionary approach to avoid polluting the ocean and should immediately inform the Secretary-General of any prospect-related incidents that threaten the marine environment. The amended regulations also said a contractor can recover &quot;a reasonable amount of material&quot; for testing but not for sale.

In July 2019, the ISA&#x27;s Legal and Trade Commission prepared &quot;Draft regulations on exploitation of mineral resources in the Area.&quot;

In 2010, the ISA adopted Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for Polymetallic Sulphides.

In 2012, the Authority adopted Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for Cobalt-Rich Ferromanganese Crusts.

The Council of the Authority began work in August 2002 on another set of regulations, covering polymetallic sulfides and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts, which are rich sources of such minerals as copper, iron, zinc, silver and gold, as well as cobalt. The sulphides are found around volcanic hot springs, especially in the western Pacific Ocean, while the crusts occur on oceanic ridges and elsewhere at several locations around the world. The Council decided in 2006 to prepare separate sets of regulations for sulphides and for crusts, with priority given to sulphides. It devoted most of its sessions in 2007 and 2008 to this task, but several issues remained unresolved. Chief among these were the definition and configuration of the area to be allocated to contractors for exploration, the fees to be paid to the Authority and the question of how to deal with any overlapping claims that might arise. Meanwhile, the Legal and Technical Commission reported progress on ferromanganese crusts.

=== Workshops and research ===
In addition to its legislative work, the Authority organizes annual workshops on various aspects of seabed exploration, with emphasis on measures to protect the marine environment from any harmful consequences. It disseminates the results of these meetings through publications. Studies over several years covering the key mineral area of the Central Pacific resulted in a technical study on biodiversity, species ranges and gene flow in the abyssal Pacific nodule province, with emphasis on predicting and managing the impacts of deep seabed mining A workshop at Manoa, Hawaii, in October 2007 produced a rationale and recommendations for the establishment of &quot;preservation reference areas&quot; in the Clarion–Clipperton zone, where nodule mining would be prohibited in order to leave the natural environment intact. In recent years, the ISA hosted workshops on enhancing the role of women in conducting deep-sea scientific studies, sustainable management of deep seabed resources, a series for Africa on resources and technologies for DSM and a session on sharing the economic benefits of DSM.

== National trends in seabed mining ==
In recent years, however, interest in deep sea mining, especially with regard to ferromanganese crusts and polymetallic sulphides, has picked up among several firms now operating in waters within the national zones of Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Tonga. Papua New Guinea was the first country in the world to grant commercial exploration licenses for seafloor massive sulphide deposits when it granted the initial license to Nautilus Minerals in 1997. Japan&#x27;s new ocean policy emphasizes the need to develop methane hydrate and hydrothermal deposits within Japan&#x27;s exclusive economic zone and calls for the commercialization of these resources within the next 10 years. Reporting on these developments in his annual report to the Authority in April 2008, Secretary-General Nandan referred also to the upward trend in demand and prices for cobalt, copper, nickel and manganese, the main metals that would be derived from seabed mining, and he noted that technologies being developed for offshore extraction could be adapted for deep sea mining.

Recently, there has been much interest in the possibility of exploiting seabed resources in the Arctic Ocean, bordered by Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Russia and the United States (see Territorial claims in the Arctic). In 2020, an international coalition of environmental groups urged the government of Norway to not only abandon plans for deep sea mining under national jurisdiction, but to also speak out against DSM Arctic mining before the International Seaboard Authority.

==Endowment fund==
In 2006 the Authority established an Endowment Fund to Support Collaborative Marine Scientific Research on the International Seabed Area. The Fund will aid experienced scientists and technicians from developing countries to participate in deep-sea research organized by international and national institutions. A campaign was launched in February 2008 to identify participants, establish a network of cooperating bodies and seek outside funds to augment the initial $3 million endowment from the Authority.

==Voluntary commitments==
In 2017, the Authority registered seven voluntary commitments with the UN Oceans Conference for Sustainable Development Goal 14. These were:
#OceanAction15467 – Enhancing the role of women in marine scientific research through capacity building
#OceanAction15796 – Encouraging dissemination of research results through the ISA Secretary-General Award for Excellence in Deep-Sea Research
#OceanAction16538 – Abyssal Initiative for Blue Growth (with UN-DESA)
#OceanAction16494 – Fostering cooperation to promote the sustainable development of Africa&#x27;s deep seabed resources in support of Africas Blue Economy
#OceanAction17746 – Enhancing the assessment of essential ecological functions of the deep sea oceans through long-term underwater oceanographic observatories in the Area; 
#OceanAction17776 – Enhancing deep sea marine biodiversity assessment through the creation of online taxonomic atlases linked to deep sea mining activities in the Area

<text>Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) is the 16-bit internal bus of IBM PC/AT and similar computers based on the Intel 80286 and its immediate successors during the 1980s. The bus was (largely) backward compatible with the 8-bit bus of the 8088-based IBM PC, including the IBM PC/XT as well as IBM PC compatibles.

Originally referred to as the PC bus (8-bit) or AT bus (16-bit), it was also termed &quot;I/O Channel&quot; by IBM. The ISA term was coined as a retronym by IBM PC clone manufacturers in the late 1980s or early 1990s as a reaction to IBM attempts to replace the AT bus with its new and incompatible Micro Channel architecture.

The 16-bit ISA bus was also used with 32-bit processors for several years. An attempt to extend it to 32 bits, called Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA), was not very successful, however. Later buses such as VESA Local Bus and PCI were used instead, often along with ISA slots on the same mainboard. Derivatives of the AT bus structure were and still are used in ATA/IDE, the PCMCIA standard, CompactFlash, the PC/104 bus, and internally within Super I/O chips.

Even though ISA disappeared from consumer desktops many years ago, it is still used in industrial PCs, where certain specialized expansion cards that never transitioned to PCI and PCI Express are used.

==History==



The original PC bus was developed by a team led by Mark Dean at IBM as part of the IBM PC project in 1981. It was an 8-bit bus based on the I/O bus of the IBM System/23 Datamaster system - it used the same physical connector, and a similar signal protocol and pinout. A 16-bit version, the IBM AT bus, was introduced with the release of the IBM PC/AT in 1984. The AT bus was a mostly backward-compatible extension of the PC bus—the AT bus connector was a superset of the PC bus connector. In 1988, the 32-bit EISA standard was proposed by the &quot;Gang of Nine&quot; group of PC-compatible manufacturers that included Compaq. Compaq created the term &quot;Industry Standard Architecture&quot; (ISA) to replace &quot;PC compatible&quot;. In the process, they retroactively renamed the AT bus to ISA to avoid infringing IBM&#x27;s trademark on its PC and PC/AT systems (and to avoid giving their major competitor, IBM, free advertisement). 

IBM designed the 8-bit version as a buffered interface to the motherboard buses of the Intel 8088 (16/8 bit) CPU in the IBM PC and PC/XT, augmented with prioritized interrupts and DMA channels. The 16-bit version was an upgrade for the motherboard buses of the Intel 80286 CPU (and expanded interrupt and DMA facilities) used in the IBM AT, with improved support for bus mastering. The ISA bus was therefore synchronous with the CPU clock until sophisticated buffering methods were implemented by chipsets to interface ISA to much faster CPUs.

ISA was designed to connect peripheral cards to the motherboard and allows for bus mastering. Only the first 16 MB of main memory is addressable. The original 8-bit bus ran from the 4.77 MHz clock of the 8088 CPU in the IBM PC and PC/XT. The original 16-bit bus ran from the CPU clock of the 80286 in IBM PC/AT computers, which was 6 MHz in the first models and 8 MHz in later models. The IBM RT PC also used the 16-bit bus. ISA was also used in some non-IBM compatible machines such as Motorola 68k-based Apollo (68020) and Amiga 3000 (68030) workstations, the short-lived AT&amp;T Hobbit and the later PowerPC-based BeBox.

Companies like Dell improved the AT bus&#x27;s performance but in 1987, IBM replaced the AT bus with its proprietary Micro Channel Architecture (MCA). MCA overcame many of the limitations then apparent in ISA but was also an effort by IBM to regain control of the PC architecture and the PC market. MCA was far more advanced than ISA and had many features that would later appear in PCI. However, MCA was also a closed standard whereas IBM had released full specifications and circuit schematics for ISA. Computer manufacturers responded to MCA by developing the Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) and the later VESA Local Bus (VLB). VLB used some electronic parts originally intended for MCA because component manufacturers were already equipped to manufacture them. Both EISA and VLB were backward-compatible expansions of the AT (ISA) bus.

Users of ISA-based machines had to know special information about the hardware they were adding to the system. While a handful of devices were essentially plug-n-play, this was rare. Users frequently had to configure parameters when adding a new device, such as the IRQ line, I/O address, or DMA channel. MCA had done away with this complication and PCI actually incorporated many of the ideas first explored with MCA, though it was more directly descended from EISA.

This trouble with configuration eventually led to the creation of ISA PnP, a plug-n-play system that used a combination of modifications to hardware, the system BIOS, and operating system software to automatically manage resource allocations. In reality, ISA PnP could be troublesome and did not become well-supported until the architecture was in its final days.

A PnP ISA, EISA or VLB device may have a 5-byte &quot;EISA ID&quot; (3-byte manufacturer ID + 2-byte hex number) to identify the device. For example, CTL0044 corresponds to Creative Sound Blaster 16/32 PnP.

PCI slots were the first physically incompatible expansion ports to directly squeeze ISA off the motherboard. At first, motherboards were largely ISA, including a few PCI slots. By the mid-1990s, the two slot types were roughly balanced, and ISA slots soon were in the minority of consumer systems. Microsoft&#x27;s PC-99 specification recommended that ISA slots be removed entirely, though the system architecture still required ISA to be present in some vestigial way internally to handle the floppy drive, serial ports, etc., which was why the software compatible LPC bus was created. ISA slots remained for a few more years and towards the turn of the century it was common to see systems with an Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) sitting near the central processing unit, an array of PCI slots, and one or two ISA slots near the end. In late 2008, even floppy disk drives and serial ports were disappearing, and the extinction of vestigial ISA (by then the LPC bus) from chipsets was on the horizon.

PCI slots are rotated compared to their ISA counterparts—PCI cards were essentially inserted upside-down, allowing ISA and PCI connectors to squeeze together on the motherboard. Only one of the two connectors can be used in each slot at a time, but this allowed for greater flexibility.

The AT Attachment (ATA) hard disk interface is directly descended from the 16-bit ISA of the PC/AT. ATA has its origins in the IBM Personal Computer Fixed Disk and Diskette Adapter, the standard dual-function floppy disk controller and hard disk controller card for the IBM PC AT; the fixed disk controller on this card implemented the register set and the basic command set which became the basis of the ATA interface (and which differed greatly from the interface of IBM&#x27;s fixed disk controller card for the PC XT). Direct precursors to ATA were third-party ISA hardcards that integrated a hard disk drive (HDD) and a hard disk controller (HDC) onto one card. This was at best awkward and at worst damaging to the motherboard, as ISA slots were not designed to support such heavy devices as HDDs. The next generation of Integrated Drive Electronics drives moved both the drive and controller to a drive bay and used a ribbon cable and a very simple interface board to connect it to an ISA slot. ATA is basically a standardization of this arrangement plus a uniform command structure for software to interface with the HDC within the drive. ATA has since been separated from the ISA bus and connected directly to the local bus, usually by integration into the chipset, for much higher clock rates and data throughput than ISA could support. ATA has clear characteristics of 16-bit ISA, such as a 16-bit transfer size, signal timing in the PIO modes and the interrupt and DMA mechanisms.

==ISA bus architecture==
The PC/XT-bus is an eight-bit ISA bus used by Intel 8086 and Intel 8088 systems in the IBM PC and IBM PC XT in the 1980s. Among its 62 pins were demultiplexed and electrically buffered versions of the 8 data and 20 address lines of the 8088 processor, along with power lines, clocks, read/write strobes, interrupt lines, etc. Power lines included −5 V and ±12 V in order to directly support pMOS and enhancement mode nMOS circuits such as dynamic RAMs among other things. The XT bus architecture uses a single Intel 8259 PIC, giving eight vectorized and prioritized interrupt lines. It has four DMA channels originally provided by the Intel 8237. Three of the DMA channels are brought out to the XT bus expansion slots; of these, 2 are normally already allocated to machine functions (diskette drive and hard disk controller):
The PC/AT-bus, a 16-bit (or 80286-) version of the PC/XT bus, was introduced with the IBM PC/AT. This bus was officially termed &quot;I/O Channel&quot; by IBM. It extends the XT-bus by adding a second shorter edge connector in-line with the eight-bit XT-bus connector, which is unchanged, retaining compatibility with most 8-bit cards. The second connector adds four additional address lines for a total of 24, and 8 additional data lines for a total of 16. It also adds new interrupt lines connected to a second 8259 PIC (connected to one of the lines of the first) and 4 × 16-bit DMA channels, as well as control lines to select 8- or 16-bit transfers.

The 16-bit AT bus slot originally used two standard edge connector sockets in early IBM PC/AT machines. However, with the popularity of the AT architecture and the 16-bit ISA bus, manufacturers introduced specialized 98-pin connectors that integrated the two sockets into one unit. These can be found in almost every AT-class PC manufactured after the mid-1980s. The ISA slot connector is typically black (distinguishing it from the brown EISA connectors and white PCI connectors).

===Number of devices===
Motherboard devices have dedicated IRQs (not present in the slots). 16-bit devices can use either PC-bus or PC/AT-bus IRQs. It is therefore possible to connect up to 6 devices that use one 8-bit IRQ each and up to 5 devices that use one 16-bit IRQ each. At the same time, up to 4 devices may use one 8-bit DMA channel each, while up to 3 devices can use one 16-bit DMA channel each.

===Varying bus speeds===
Originally, the bus clock was synchronous with the CPU clock, resulting in varying bus clock frequencies among the many different IBM clones on the market (sometimes as high as 16 or 20 MHz), leading to software or electrical timing problems for certain ISA cards at bus speeds they were not designed for. Later motherboards or integrated chipsets used a separate clock generator, or a clock divider which either fixed the ISA bus frequency at 4, 6, or 8 MHz or allowed the user to adjust the frequency via the BIOS setup. When used at a higher bus frequency, some ISA cards (certain Hercules-compatible video cards, for instance), could show significant performance improvements.

===8/16-bit incompatibilities===
Memory address decoding for the selection of 8 or 16-bit transfer mode was limited to 128 KB sections, leading to problems when mixing 8- and 16-bit cards as they could not co-exist in the same 128 KB area. This is because the MEMCS16 line is required to be set based on the value of LA17-23 only.

==Past and current use==
ISA is still used today for specialized industrial purposes. In 2008, IEI Technologies released a modern motherboard for Intel Core 2 Duo processors which, in addition to other special I/O features, is equipped with two ISA slots. It was marketed to industrial and military users who had invested in expensive specialized ISA bus adaptors, which were not available in PCI bus versions.

Similarly, ADEK Industrial Computers released a modern motherboard in early 2013 for Intel Core i3/i5/i7 processors, which contains one (non-DMA) ISA slot. Also, MSI released a modern motherboard with one ISA slot in 2020.

The PC/104 bus, used in industrial and embedded applications, is a derivative of the ISA bus, utilizing the same signal lines with different connectors. The LPC bus has replaced the ISA bus as the connection to the legacy I/O devices on current motherboards; while physically quite different, LPC looks just like ISA to software, so the peculiarities of ISA such as the 16 MiB DMA limit (which corresponds to the full address space of the Intel 80286 CPU used in the original IBM AT) are likely to stick around for a while.

=== ATA ===
As explained in the &quot;History&quot; section, ISA was the basis for development of the ATA interface, used for ATA (a.k.a. IDE) hard disks. Physically, ATA is essentially a simple subset of ISA, with 16 data bits, support for exactly one IRQ and one DMA channel, and 3 address bits. To this ISA subset, ATA adds two IDE address select (&quot;chip select&quot;) lines (i.e. address decodes, effectively equivalent to address bits) and a few unique signal lines specific to ATA/IDE hard disks (such as the Cable Select/Spindle Sync. line.) In addition to the physical interface channel, ATA goes beyond and far outside the scope of ISA by also specifying a set of physical device registers to be implemented on every ATA (IDE) drive and a full set of protocols and device commands for controlling fixed disk drives using these registers. The ATA device registers are accessed using the address bits and address select signals in the ATA physical interface channel, and all operations of ATA hard disks are performed using the ATA-specified protocols through the ATA command set. The earliest versions of the ATA standard featured a few simple protocols and a basic command set comparable to the command sets of MFM and RLL controllers (which preceded ATA controllers), but the latest ATA standards have much more complex protocols and instruction sets that include optional commands and protocols providing such advanced optional-use features as sizable hidden system storage areas, password security locking, and programmable geometry translation.

In the mid-1990s, the ATA host controller (usually integrated into the chipset) was moved to PCI form. A further deviation between ISA and ATA is that while the ISA bus remained locked into a single standard clock rate (for backward hardware compatibility), the ATA interface offered many different speed modes, could select among them to match the maximum speed supported by the attached drives, and kept adding faster speeds with later versions of the ATA standard (up to for ATA-6, the latest.) In most forms, ATA ran much faster than ISA, provided it was connected directly to a local bus (e.g. southbridge-integrated IDE interfaces) faster than the ISA bus.

=== XT-IDE ===
Before the 16-bit ATA/IDE interface, there was an 8-bit XT-IDE (also known as XTA) interface for hard disks. It was not nearly as popular as ATA has become, and XT-IDE hardware is now fairly hard to find. Some XT-IDE adapters were available as 8-bit ISA cards, and XTA sockets were also present on the motherboards of Amstrad&#x27;s later XT clones as well as a short-lived line of Philips units. The XTA pinout was very similar to ATA, but only eight data lines and two address lines were used, and the physical device registers had completely different meanings. A few hard drives (such as the Seagate ST351A/X) could support either type of interface, selected with a jumper.

Many later AT (and AT successor) motherboards had no integrated hard drive interface but relied on a separate hard drive interface plugged into an ISA/EISA/VLB slot. There were even a few 80486-based units shipped with MFM/RLL interfaces and drives instead of the increasingly common AT-IDE.

Commodore built the XT-IDE-based peripheral hard drive and memory expansion unit A590 for their Amiga 500 and 500+ computers that also supported a SCSI drive. Later models – the A600, A1200, and the Amiga 4000 series – use AT-IDE drives.

=== PCMCIA ===
The PCMCIA specification can be seen as a superset of ATA. The standard for PCMCIA hard disk interfaces, which included PCMCIA flash drives, allows for the mutual configuration of the port and the drive in an ATA mode. As a de facto extension, most PCMCIA flash drives additionally allow for a simple ATA mode that is enabled by pulling a single pin low, so that PCMCIA hardware and firmware are unnecessary to use them as an ATA drive connected to an ATA port. PCMCIA flash drive to ATA adapters are thus simple and inexpensive but are not guaranteed to work with any and every standard PCMCIA flash drive. Further, such adapters cannot be used as generic PCMCIA ports, as the PCMCIA interface is much more complex than ATA.

==Emulation by embedded chips==
Although most modern computers do not have physical ISA buses, almost all PCs — IA-32, and x86-64 — have ISA buses allocated in physical address space. Some Southbridges and some CPUs themselves provide services such as temperature monitoring and voltage readings through ISA buses as ISA devices.

==Standardization==
IEEE started a standardization of the ISA bus in 1985, called the P996 specification. However, despite books being published on the P996 specification, it never officially progressed past draft status.

==Modern ISA cards==
There still is an existing user base with old computers, so some ISA cards are still manufactured, e.g. with USB ports or complete single-board computers based on modern processors, USB 3.0, and SATA.

<text>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an intergovernmental body of the United Nations. Its job is to advance scientific knowledge about climate change caused by human activities. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) set up the IPCC in 1988. The United Nations endorsed the creation of the IPCC later that year. It has a secretariat in Geneva, Switzerland, hosted by the WMO. It has 195 member states who govern the IPCC. The member states elect a bureau of scientists to serve through an assessment cycle. A cycle is usually six to seven years. The bureau selects experts in their fields to prepare IPCC reports. There is a formal nomination process by governments and observer organizations to find these experts. The IPCC has three working groups and a task force, which carry out its scientific work.

The IPCC informs governments about the state of knowledge of climate change. It does this by examining all the relevant scientific literature on the subject. This includes the natural, economic and social impacts and risks. It also covers possible response options. The IPCC does not conduct its own original research. It aims to be objective and comprehensive. Thousands of scientists and other experts volunteer to review the publications. They compile key findings into &quot;Assessment Reports&quot; for policymakers and the general public; Experts have described this work as the biggest peer review process in the scientific community.

Leading climate scientists and all member governments endorse the IPCC&#x27;s findings. This underscores that the IPCC is a well-respected authority on climate change. Governments, civil society organizations, and the media regularly quote from the panel&#x27;s reports. IPCC reports play a key role in the annual climate negotiations held by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report was an important influence on the landmark Paris Agreement in 2015. The IPCC shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore for contributions to the understanding of climate change.

The seventh assessment cycle of the IPCC began in 2023. In August 2021, the IPCC published its Working Group I contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report on the physical science basis of climate change. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described this report as the &quot;starkest warning yet&quot; of &quot;major inevitable and irreversible climate changes&quot;. Many newspapers around the world echoed this theme. In February 2022, the IPCC released its Working Group II report on impacts and adaptation. It published Working Group III&#x27;s &quot;mitigation of climate change&quot; contribution to the Sixth Assessment in April 2022. The Sixth Assessment Report concluded with a Synthesis Report in March 2023.

During the period of the Sixth Assessment Report, the IPCC released three special reports. The first and most influential was the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C in 2018. In 2019 the Special Report on Climate Change and Land, and the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate came out. The IPCC also updated its methodologies in 2019. So the sixth assessment cycle was the most ambitious in the IPCC&#x27;s history.

== Origins ==
The predecessor of the IPCC was the Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases (AGGG). Three organizations set up the AGGG in 1986. These were the International Council of Scientific Unions, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The AGGG reviewed scientific research on greenhouse gases. It also studied increases in greenhouse gases. Climate science was becoming more complicated and covering more disciplines. This small group of scientists lacked the resources to cover climate science.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency sought an international convention to restrict greenhouse gas emissions. The Reagan Administration worried that independent scientists would have too much influence. The WMO and UNEP therefore created the IPCC as an intergovernmental body in 1988. Scientists take part in the IPCC as both experts and government representatives. The IPCC produces reports backed by all leading relevant scientists. Member governments must also endorse the reports by consensus agreement. So the IPCC is both a scientific body and an organization of governments. Its job is to tell governments what scientists know about climate change. It also examines the impacts of climate change and options for dealing with it. The IPCC does this by assessing peer-reviewed scientific literature.

The United Nations endorsed the creation of the IPCC in 1988. The General Assembly resolution noted that human activity could change the climate. This could lead to severe economic and social consequences. It said increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases could warm the planet. This would cause the sea level to rise. The effects on humanity would be disastrous if timely steps were not taken.

== Organization ==
=== Way of working ===
The IPCC does not conduct original research. It produces comprehensive assessments on the state of knowledge of climate change. It prepares reports on special topics relevant to climate change. It also produces methodologies. These methodologies help countries estimate their greenhouse gas emissions and removals through sinks. Its assessments build on previous reports and scientific publications. Throughout six assessments the reports reflect the growing evidence for a changing climate. And they show how this is due to human activity.

=== Rules and governing principles ===
The IPCC has adopted its rules of procedure in the &quot;Principles Governing IPCC Work&quot;. These state that the IPCC will assess:
* the risk of climate change caused by human activities,
* its potential impacts, and
* possible options for prevention.
Under IPCC rules its assessments are comprehensive, objective, open, and transparent. They cover all the information relevant to the scientific understanding of climate change. This draws on scientific, technical, and socioeconomic information. IPCC reports must be neutral regarding policy recommendations. However, they may address the objective factors relevant to enacting policies.

=== Structure ===
The IPCC has the following structure:
* IPCC Panel: Meets in plenary session about twice a year. It may meet more often for the approval of reports. It controls the IPCC&#x27;s structure, procedures, work programme, and budget. It accepts and approves IPCC reports. The Panel is the IPCC corporate entity.
* Chair: Elected by the Panel. Chairs the Bureau and other bodies. Represents the organization.
* Bureau: Elected by the Panel. It currently has 34 members from different geographic regions. Besides the Chair and three IPCC Vice-Chairs, they provide the leadership for the IPCC&#x27;s three Working Groups and Task Force. It provides guidance to the Panel on the scientific and technical aspects of its work.
* Working Groups: Each has two Co-Chairs, one from a developed and one from a developing country. A technical support unit supports each Working Group. Working Group sessions approve the Summary for Policymakers of assessment and special reports. Each Working Group has a Bureau. This consists of its Co-Chairs and Vice-Chairs, who are also members of the IPCC Bureau.
** Working Group I: Assesses scientific aspects of the climate system and climate change. Co-Chairs: Robert Vautard (France) and Xiaoye Zhang (China)
** Working Group II: Assesses the impacts of climate change on human and natural systems. Assesses adaptation options. Co-Chairs: Bart van den Hurk (Netherlands) and Winston Chow (Singapore)
** Working Group III: Assesses how to stop climate change by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. (Known as &quot;mitigation&quot;.) Co-Chairs: Katherine Calvin (United States) and Joy Jacqueline Pereira (Malaysia)
* Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. Develops methodologies for estimating greenhouse gas emissions. Co-Chairs: Takeshi Enoki (Japan) and Mazhar Hayat (Pakistan)
** Task Force Bureau: Consists of two Co-Chairs, who are also members of the IPCC Bureau, and 12 members.
* Executive Committee: Consists of the Chair, IPCC Vice-Chairs and the Co-Chairs of the Working Groups and Task Force. It addresses urgent issues that arise between sessions of the Panel.
* Secretariat: Administers activities, supports the Chair and Bureau, point of contact for governments. Supported by UNEP and the WMO.

==== Chair ====
The chair of the IPCC is British energy scientist Jim Skea, who is hosted by the International Institute for Environment and Development. Skea has served since 28 July 2023 with the election of the new IPCC Bureau. His predecessor was Korean economist Hoesung Lee, elected in 2015. The previous chairs were Rajendra K. Pachauri, elected in 2002, Robert Watson, elected in 1997, and Bert Bolin, elected in 1988.

==== Panel ====
The Panel consists of representatives appointed by governments. They take part in plenary sessions of the IPCC and its Working Groups. Non-governmental and intergovernmental organizations may attend as observers. Meetings of IPCC bodies are by invitation only. About 500 people from 130 countries attended the 48th Session of the Panel in Incheon, Republic of Korea. This took place in October 2018. They included 290 government officials and 60 representatives of observer organizations. The opening ceremonies of sessions of the Panel and of Lead Author Meetings are open to media. Otherwise, IPCC meetings are closed.

=== Funding ===
The IPCC receives funding through a dedicated trust fund. UNEP and the WMO established the fund in 1989. The trust fund receives annual financial contributions from member governments. The WMO, UNEP, and other organizations also contribute. Payments are voluntary and there is no set amount required. The WMO covers the operating costs of the secretariat. It also sets the IPCC&#x27;s financial regulations and rules. The Panel sets the annual budget.

In 2021, the IPCC&#x27;s annual budget amounts to approximately six million euros, financed by the 195 UN Member states, who contribute &quot;independently and voluntarily&quot;. In 2021, the countries giving the most money include the United States, Japan, France, Germany and Norway. Other countries, often developing ones, give an &quot;in-kind contribution, by hosting IPCC meetings&quot;. In 2022, this budget was a little less than eight million euros.

=== List of all reports ===
=== Activities other than report preparation ===
The IPCC bases its work on the decisions of the WMO and UNEP, which established the IPCC. It also supports the work of the UNFCCC. The main work of the IPCC is to prepare assessments and other reports. It also supports other activities such as the Data Distribution Centre. This helps manage data related to IPCC reports.

The IPCC has a &quot;Gender Policy and Implementation Plan&quot; to pay attention to gender in its work. It aims to carry out its work inclusively and respectfully. The IPCC aims for balance in participation in IPCC work. This should offer all participants equal opportunity.

==== Communications and dissemination activities ====
The IPCC enhanced its communications activities for the Fifth Assessment Report. For instance, it made the approved report and press release available to registered media under embargo before the release. And it expanded its outreach activities with an outreach calendar. The IPCC held an Expert Meeting on Communication in February 2016, at the start of the Sixth Assessment Report cycle. Members of the old and new Bureaus worked with communications experts and practitioners at this meeting. This meeting produced a series of recommendations. The IPCC adopted many of them. One was to bring people with communications expertise into the Working Group Technical Support Units. Another was to consider communication questions early on in the preparation of reports.

Following these steps in communications, the IPCC saw a significant increase in media coverage of its reports. This was particularly the case with the &quot;Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C&quot; in 2018 and &quot;Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis&quot;, the Working Group I contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report, in 2021. There was also much greater public interest, reflected in the youth and other movements that emerged in 2018.

IPCC reports are important for public awareness of climate change and related policymaking. This has led to several academic studies of IPCC communications, for example in 2021.

==== Archiving ====
The IPCC archives its reports and electronic files on its website. They include the review comments on drafts of reports. The Environmental Science and Public Policy Archives in the Harvard Library also archives them.

==Assessment reports==

Between 1990 and 2023, the IPCC published six comprehensive assessment reports reviewing the latest climate science. The IPCC has also produced 14 special reports on particular topics. Each assessment report has four parts. These are a contribution from each of the three working groups, plus a synthesis report. The synthesis report integrates the working group contributions. It also integrates any special reports produced in that assessment cycle.

=== Review process of scientific literature ===
The IPCC does not carry out research. It does not monitor climate-related data. The reports by IPCC assess scientific papers and independent results from other scientific bodies. The IPCC sets a deadline for publication of scientific papers that a report will cover. That report will not include new information that emerges after this deadline. However, there is a steady evolution of key findings and levels of scientific confidence from one assessment report to the next. Each IPCC report notes areas where the science has improved since the previous report. It also notes areas that would benefit from further research.

The First Assessment Report was published in 1990 and received an update in 1992. In intervals of about six years, new editions of IPCC Assessment Report followed.

===Selection and role of authors===
The focal points of the Member states — the individual appointed by each state to liaise with the IPCC — and the observer organizations submit to the IPCC Bureau a list of personalities, which they have freely constituted. The Bureau (more precisely, the co-chairs of the relevant working group, with the help of its technical support unit) uses these lists as a basis for appointing authors while retaining the possibility of appointing people who are not on the list, primarily based on scientific excellence and diversity of viewpoints, and to a lesser extent by ensuring geographical diversity, experience within the IPCC and gender. Authors may include, in addition to researchers, personalities from the private sector and experts from NGOs.

The IPCC Bureau or Working Group Bureau selects the authors of the reports from government nominations. Lead authors of IPCC reports assess the available information about climate change based on published sources. According to IPCC guidelines, authors should give priority to peer-reviewed sources. Authors may refer to non-peer-reviewed sources (&quot;grey literature&quot;), if they are of sufficient quality. These could include reports from government agencies and non-governmental organizations. Industry journals and model results are other examples of non-peer-reviewed sources.

Authors prepare drafts of a full report divided into chapters. They also prepare a technical summary of the report, and a summary for policymakers.

Each chapter has many authors to write and edit the material. A typical chapter has two coordinating lead authors, ten to fifteen lead authors, and a larger number of contributing authors. The coordinating lead authors assemble the contributions of the other authors. They ensure that contributions meet stylistic and formatting requirements. They report to the Working Group co-chairs. Lead authors write sections of chapters. They invite contributing authors to prepare text, graphs, or data for inclusion. Review editors must ensure that authors respond to comments received during the two stages of drafts review: the first is only open to external experts and researchers, while the second is also open to government representatives.

The Bureau aims for a range of views, expertise, and geographical representation in its choice of authors. This ensures the author team includes experts from both developing and developed countries. The Bureau also seeks a balance between male and female authors. It aims for a balance between those who have worked previously on IPCC reports and those new to the process.

Scientists who work as authors on IPCC reports do not receive any compensation for this work, and all work voluntarily. They depend on the salaries they receive from their home institutions or other work. The work is labour-intensive with a big time commitment. It can disrupt participating scientists&#x27; research. This has led to concern that the IPCC process may discourage qualified scientists from participating. More than 3,000 authors (coordinating lead authors, lead authors, review editors) have participated in the drafting of IPCC reports since its creation.

=== Review process for assessment reports ===
Expert reviewers comment at different stages on the drafts. Reviewers come from member governments and IPCC observers. Also, anyone may become an IPCC reviewer by stating they have the relevant expertise.

There are generally three stages in the review process. First comes an expert review of the first draft of the chapters. The next stage is a review by governments and experts of the revised draft of the chapters and the first draft of the Summary for Policymakers. The third stage is a government review of the revised Summary for Policymakers. Review comments and author responses remain in an open archive for at least five years. Finally, government representatives together with the authors review the Summary for Policymakers. They go through the Summary for Policymakers line by line to ensure it is a good summary of the underlying report. This final review of the Summary of Policymakers takes place at sessions of the responsible working group or of the Panel.

There are several types of endorsement that documents receive:
* Approval - Material has been subject to detailed, line-by-line discussion and agreement. (The relevant Working Groups &quot;approve&quot; Working Group Summaries for Policymakers. The Panel &quot;approves&quot; the Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers.)
* Adoption - Endorsed section by section (not line by line). (The Panel &quot;adopts&quot; the full IPCC Synthesis Report. It also &quot;adopts&quot; Overview Chapters of Methodology Reports.)
* Acceptance - Not been subject to line-by-line discussion and agreement. But it presents a comprehensive, objective, and balanced view of the subject matter. (Working Groups &quot;accept&quot; their reports. The Panel &quot;accepts&quot; Working Group Summaries for Policymakers after working group approval. The Panel &quot;accepts&quot; Methodology Reports.)

=== Key findings and impacts ===
==== Assessment reports one to five (1990 to 2014) ====

* The IPCC&#x27;s First Assessment Report (FAR) appeared in 1990. The report gave a broad overview of climate change science. It discussed uncertainties and provided evidence of warming. The authors said they are certain that greenhouse gases are increasing in the atmosphere because of human activity. This is resulting in more warming of the Earth&#x27;s surface. The report led to the establishment of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
* The Second Assessment Report (SAR), was published in 1995. It strengthened the findings of the First Assessment Report. The evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on the global climate, it said. The Second Assessment Report provided important material for the negotiations leading to the UNFCCC&#x27;s Kyoto Protocol.
* The Third Assessment Report (TAR) was completed in 2001. It found more evidence that most of the global warming seen over the previous 50 years was due to human activity. The report includes a graph reconstructing global temperature since the year 1000. The sharp rise in temperature in recent years gave it the name &quot;hockey stick&quot;. This became a powerful image of how temperature is soaring with climate change. The report also shows how adaptation to the effects of climate change can reduce some of its ill effects.
* The IPCC&#x27;s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) was published in 2007. It gives much greater certainty about climate change. It states: &quot;Warming of the climate system is unequivocal...&quot; The report helped make people around the world aware of climate change. The IPCC shared the Nobel Peace Prize in the year of the report&#x27;s publication for this work (see below).
* The Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) was published in 2013 and 2014. This report again stated the fact of climate change. It warned of the dangerous risks. And it emphasizes how the world can counter climate change. Three key findings were for example: Firstly, human influence on the climate system is clear. Secondly, the more we disrupt our climate, the more we risk severe, pervasive, and irreversible impacts. And thirdly, we have the means to limit climate change and build a more prosperous, sustainable future. The report&#x27;s findings were the scientific foundation of the UNFCCC&#x27;s 2015 Paris Agreement.

====Sixth assessment report (2021/2022)====
The IPCC&#x27;s most recent report is the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). The first three installments of AR6 appeared in 2021 and 2022. The final synthesis report was completed in March 2023.

The IPCC published the Working Group I report, &quot;Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis&quot;, in August 2021. It confirms that the climate is already changing in every region. Many of these changes have not been seen in thousands of years. Many of them such as sea-level rise are irreversible over hundreds of thousands of years. Strong reductions in greenhouse gas emissions would limit climate change. But it could take 20–30 years for the climate to stabilize. This report attracted enormous media and public attention. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres described it as &quot;code red for humanity&quot;.

The IPCC published the Working Group II report, &quot;Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability&quot;, in February 2022. Climate change due to human activities is already affecting the lives of billions of people, it said. It is disrupting nature. The world faces unavoidable hazards over the next two decades even with global warming of 1.5 °C, it said.

The IPCC published the Working Group III report, &quot;Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change&quot;, in April 2022. It will be impossible to limit warming to 1.5 °C without immediate and deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. It is still possible to halve emissions by 2050, it said.

== Other reports ==

===Special reports===
The IPCC also publishes other types of reports. It produces Special Reports on topics proposed by governments or observer organizations. Between 1994 and 2019 the IPCC published 14 special reports. Now usually more than one working group cooperates to produce a special report. The preparation and approval process is the same as for assessment reports.

==== Special reports in 2011 ====
During the fifth assessment cycle, the IPCC produced two special reports. It completed the Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation in 2011. Working Group III prepared this report. The report examined options to use different types of renewable energy to replace fossil fuels. The report noted that the cost of most renewable technologies had fallen. It was likely to fall even more with further advances in technology. It said renewables could increase access to energy. The report reviewed 164 scenarios that examine how renewables could help stop climate change. In more than half of these scenarios, renewables would contribute more than 27% of the primary energy supply in the mid-century. This would be more than double the 13% share in 2008. In the scenarios with the highest shares for renewable energy, it will contribute 77% by 2050.

Later in 2011, the IPCC released the Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation. This was a collaboration between Working Groups I and II. It was the first time two IPCC working groups worked together on a special report. The report shows how climate change has contributed to changes in extreme weather. And it shows how policies to avoid and prepare for extreme weather events can reduce their impact. In the same way, policies to respond to events and recover from them can make societies more resilient.

==== Special reports 2018–2019 ====
During the sixth assessment cycle, the IPCC produced three special reports. This made it the most ambitious cycle in IPCC history. The UNFCCC set a goal of keeping global warming well below while trying to hold it at , when it reached the Paris Agreement at COP21 in 2015. But at the time there was little understanding of what warming of 1.5 °C meant. There was little scientific research explaining how the impacts of 1.5 °C would differ from 2 °C. And there was little understanding about how to keep warming to 1.5 °C. So the UNFCCC invited the IPCC to prepare a report on global warming of 1.5 °C. The IPCC subsequently released the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C (SR15) in 2018. The report showed that it was possible to keep warming below 1.5 °C during the 21st century. But this would mean deep cuts in emissions. It would also mean rapid, far-reaching changes in all aspects of society. The report showed warming of 2 °C would have much more severe impacts than 1.5 °C. In other words: every bit of warming matters. SR15 had an unprecedented impact on an IPCC report in the media and with the public. It put the 1.5 °C target at the centre of climate activism.

In 2019 the IPCC released two more special reports that examine different parts of the climate system. The Special Report on Climate Change and Land examined how the way we use land affects the climate. It looked at emissions from activities such as farming and forestry rather than from energy and transport. It also looked at how climate change is affecting land. All three IPCC working groups and its Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories collaborated on the report. The report found that climate change is adding to the pressures we are putting on the land we use to live on and grow our food. It will only be possible to keep warming well below 2 °C if we reduce emissions from all sectors including land and food, it said.

The Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate examined how the ocean and frozen parts of the planet interact with climate change. (The cryosphere includes frozen systems such as ice sheets, glaciers, and permafrost.) IPCC Working Groups I and II prepared the report. The report highlighted the need to tackle unprecedented changes in the ocean and cryosphere. It also showed how adaptation could help sustainable development.

The IPCC will prepare a special report on climate change and cities during the seventh assessment cycle.

===Methodology Reports===
The IPCC has a National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme. It develops methodologies and software for countries to report their greenhouse gas emissions. The IPCC&#x27;s Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (TFI) has managed the program since 1998. Japan&#x27;s Institute for Global Environmental Strategies hosts the TFI&#x27;s Technical Support Unit.

The IPCC approves its methodology reports at sessions of the Panel. The Panel adopts the Methodology Report&#x27;s Overview Chapter by endorsing it section by section.

==== Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines ====
The IPCC released its first Methodology Report, the IPCC &quot;Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories&quot;, in 1994. The &quot;Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories&quot; updated this report. Two &quot;good practice reports&quot; complete these guidelines. These are the &quot;Good Practice Guidance&quot; &quot;and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories&quot; and &quot;Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry&quot;. Parties to the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol use the 1996 guidelines and two good practice reports for their annual submissions of inventories.

==== 2006 IPCC Guidelines ====
The &quot;2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories&quot; further update these methodologies. They include a large number of &quot;default emission factors&quot;. These are factors to estimate the amount of emissions for an activity. The IPCC prepared this new version of the guidelines at the request of the UNFCCC. The UNFCCC accepted them for use at its 2013 Climate Change Conference, COP19, in Warsaw. The IPCC added further material in its &quot;2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories&quot;.

The TFI has started preparations for a methodology report on short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs). It will complete this report in the next assessment cycle, the seventh.

== Challenges and controversies ==
IPCC reports also attract criticism. Criticisms come from both people who say the reports exaggerate the risks and people who say they understate them. The IPCC consensus approach has faced internal and external challenges.

===Conservative nature of IPCC reports===
Some critics have argued that IPCC reports tend to be too conservative in their assessments of climate risk. In 2012, it was reported that the IPCC has been criticized by some scientists, who argue that the reports consistently underestimate the pace and impacts of global warming. As a result, they believe this leads to findings that are the &quot;lowest common denominator&quot;. Similar claims have also been made by scientists who found that for the last several assessment reports, the focus of the IPCC reports skewed more and more towards lower temperatures, especially 1.5°C. Temperatures above 2°C however, have seen much less attention, even though they seem more likely given current emission trajectories. 

David Biello, writing in the Scientific American, argues that, because of the need to secure consensus among governmental representatives, the IPCC reports give conservative estimates of the likely extent and effects of global warming. &quot;Science&quot; editor Brooks Hanson states in a 2010 editorial: &quot;The IPCC reports have underestimated the pace of climate change while overestimating societies&#x27; abilities to curb greenhouse gas emissions.&quot;

Climate scientist James E. Hansen argues that the IPCC&#x27;s conservativeness seriously underestimates the risk of sea-level rise on the order of meters—enough to inundate many low-lying areas, such as the southern third of Florida. In January 2024, he told the Guardian, &quot;We are now in the process of moving into the 1.5C world.&quot; He added that &quot;passing through the 1.5C world is a significant milestone because it shows that the story being told by the United Nations, with the acquiescence of its scientific advisory body, the IPCC, is a load of bullshit.&quot;

Roger A. Pielke Sr. has also stated &quot;Humans are significantly altering the global climate, but in a variety of diverse ways beyond the radiative effect of carbon dioxide. The IPCC assessments have been too conservative in recognizing the importance of these human climate forcings as they alter regional and global climate.&quot;

Stefan Rahmstorf, a professor of physics and oceanography at University of Potsdam, argued in 2007 that the IPCC&#x27;s tendency to make conservative risk assessments had benefits. Rahmstorf argued that &quot;In a way, it is one of the strengths of the IPCC to be very conservative and cautious and not overstate any climate change risk&quot;. IPCC reports aim to inform policymakers about the state of knowledge on climate change. They do this by assessing the findings of the thousands of scientific papers available on the subject at a given time. Individual publications may have different conclusions from IPCC reports. This includes those appearing just after the release of an IPCC report. This can lead to criticism that the IPCC is either alarmist or conservative. New findings must wait for the next assessment for consideration.

=== Potential industry and political influence ===
A memo by ExxonMobil to the Bush administration in the United States in 2002 was an example of possible political influence on the IPCC. The memo led to strong Bush administration lobbying to oust Robert Watson, a climate scientist, as IPCC chair. They sought to replace him with Rajendra Pachauri. Many considered Pachauri at the time as more mild-mannered and industry-friendly.

Governments form the membership of the IPCC. They are the prime audience for IPCC reports. IPCC rules give them a formal role in the scoping, preparation, and approval of reports. For instance governments take part in the review process and work with authors to approve the Summary for Policymakers of reports. But some activists have argued that governments abuse this role to influence the outcome of reports.

In 2023, it was reported that pressure from Brazil and Argentina, two countries with large beef industries, caused the IPCC to abandon text recommending the adoption of plant-based diets. An earlier draft of the report, which noted &quot;plant-based diets can reduce GHG emissions by up to 50% compared to the average emission-intensive Western diet&quot;, was leaked online in March 2023.

=== Controversy and review after Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 ===
The IPCC came under unprecedented media scrutiny in 2009 in the run-up to the Copenhagen climate conference. This &quot;Climatic Research Unit email controversy&quot; involved the leak of emails from climate scientists. Many of these scientists were authors of the Fourth Assessment Report which came out in 2007. The discovery of an error in this report that the Himalayan glaciers would melt by 2035 put the IPCC under further pressure. Scientific bodies upheld the general findings of the Fourth Assessment Report and the IPCC&#x27;s approach. But many people thought the IPCC should review the way it works.

==== InterAcademy Council review in 2010 ====
Public debate after the publication of AR4 in 2009 put the IPCC under scrutiny, with controversies over alleged bias and inaccuracy in its reports. In 2010, this prompted U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and IPCC chair Rajendra K. Pachauri to request that the InterAcademy Council (IAC) review the IPCC and recommend ways to strengthen its processes and procedures for the preparation of AR5. The IAC report made recommendations to fortify IPCC&#x27;s management structure, to further develop its conflict-of-interest policy, to strengthen the review process, to clarify the guidelines on the use of so-called gray literature, to ensure consistency in the use of probabilities for the likelihood of outcomes, and to improve its communications strategy, especially regarding transparency and rapidity of response.

The United Nations Secretary-General and the Chair of the IPCC asked the InterAcademy Council (IAC) in March 2010 to review the IPCC&#x27;s processes for preparing its reports. The IAC panel, chaired by Harold Tafler Shapiro, released its report on 1 September 2010. The IAC panel made seven formal recommendations for improving the IPCC&#x27;s assessment process. The IPCC implemented most of the review&#x27;s recommendations by 2012. One of these was the introduction of a protocol to handle errors in reports. Other recommendations included strengthening the science-review process and improving communications. However, the IPCC did not adopt the proposal to appoint a full-time executive secretary.

=== Issues with consensual approach ===

Michael Oppenheimer, a long-time participant in the IPCC, has said the IPCC consensus approach has some limitations. Oppenheimer, a coordinating lead author of the Fifth Assessment Report, called for concurring, smaller assessments of special problems instead of the large-scale approach of previous IPCC assessments. Others see &quot;mixed blessings&quot; in the drive for consensus within the IPCC. They suggest including dissenting or minority positions. Others suggest improving statements about uncertainties.

=== Criticism by experts involved with the IPCC process ===
Some of the criticism has originated from experts invited by the IPCC to submit reports or serve on its panels. For example, John Christy, a contributing author who works at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, explained in 2007 the difficulties of establishing scientific consensus on the precise extent of human action on climate change. &quot;Contributing authors essentially are asked to contribute a little text at the beginning and to review the first two drafts. We have no control over editing decisions. Even less influence is granted to the 2,000 or so reviewers. Thus, to say that 800 contributing authors or 2,000 reviewers reached consensus on anything describes a situation that is not reality&quot;, he wrote. Christopher Landsea, a hurricane researcher, said of &quot;the part of the IPCC to which my expertise is relevant&quot; that &quot;I personally cannot in good faith continue to contribute to a process that I view as both being motivated by pre-conceived agendas and being scientifically unsound,&quot; because of comments made at a press conference by Kevin Trenberth of which Landsea disapproved. Trenberth said &quot;Landsea&#x27;s comments were not correct&quot;; the IPCC replied &quot;individual scientists can do what they wish in their own rights, as long as they are not saying anything on behalf of the IPCC&quot;.

== Endorsements and awards ==

=== Endorsements from scientific bodies ===
IPCC reports are the benchmark for climate science. There is widespread support for the IPCC in the scientific community. Publications by other scientific bodies and experts show this. Many scientific bodies have issued official statements that endorse the findings of the IPCC. For example:
* For the Third Assessment Report in 2001 endorsements came from the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences, United States National Research Council and European Geosciences Union.
* For the Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 endorsements came from the International Council for Science (ICSU), and the Network of African Science Academies.

=== Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 ===

In December 2007, the IPCC received the Nobel Peace Prize &quot;for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change&quot;. It shared the award with former U.S. Vice-president Al Gore for his work on climate change and the documentary &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot;.

===Gulbenkian Prize for Humanity in 2022===

In October 2022, the IPCC and IPBES shared the Gulbenkian Prize for Humanity. The two intergovernmental bodies won the prize because they &quot;produce scientific knowledge, alert society, and inform decision-makers to make better choices for combatting climate change and the loss of biodiversity&quot;.

<text>The IBM Personal Computer (model 5150, commonly known as the IBM PC) is the first microcomputer released in the IBM PC model line and the basis for the IBM PC compatible &quot;de facto&quot; standard. Released on August 12, 1981, it was created by a team of engineers and designers at International Business Machines (IBM), directed by William C. Lowe and Philip Don Estridge in Boca Raton, Florida.

Powered by an x86-architecture Intel 8088 processor, the machine was based on open architecture and third-party peripherals. Over time, expansion cards and software technology increased to support it. The PC had a substantial influence on the personal computer market; the specifications of the IBM PC became one of the most popular computer design standards in the world. The only significant competition it faced from a non-compatible platform throughout the 1980s was from Apple&#x27;s Macintosh product line, as well as consumer-grade platforms created by companies like Commodore and Atari. Most present-day personal computers share architectural features in common with the original IBM PC, including the Intel-based Mac computers manufactured from 2006 to 2022.

== History ==
Prior to the 1980s, IBM had largely been known as a provider of business computer systems. As the 1980s opened, their market share in the growing minicomputer market failed to keep up with competitors, while other manufacturers were beginning to see impressive profits in the microcomputer space. The market for personal computers was dominated at the time by Tandy, Commodore, and Apple, whose machines sold for several hundred dollars each and had become very popular. The microcomputer market was large enough for IBM&#x27;s attention, with $15 billion in sales by 1979 and projected annual growth of more than 40% during the early 1980s. Other large technology companies had entered it, such as Hewlett-Packard, Texas Instruments and Data General, and some large IBM customers were buying Apples.

As early as 1980 there were rumors of IBM developing a personal computer, possibly a miniaturized version of the IBM System/370, and Matsushita acknowledged publicly that it had discussed with IBM the possibility of manufacturing a personal computer in partnership, although this project was abandoned. The public responded to these rumors with skepticism, owing to IBM&#x27;s tendency towards slow-moving, bureaucratic business practices tailored towards the production of large, sophisticated and expensive business systems. As with other large computer companies, its new products typically required about four to five years for development, and a well publicized quote from an industry analyst was, &quot;IBM bringing out a personal computer would be like teaching an elephant to tap dance.&quot;

IBM had previously produced microcomputers, such as 1975&#x27;s IBM 5100, but targeted them towards businesses; the 5100 had a price tag as high as $20,000. Their entry into the home computer market needed to be competitively priced.

In the summer of 1979, Ron Mion, IBM’s Senior Business Trends Advisor for entry-level systems, proposed a plan for IBM to enter the emerging microcomputer market. At that time, the likes of Apple and Tandy were starting to encroach on the small-business marketplace that IBM intended to dominate. Mion believed that that market would grow significantly and that IBM should aggressively pursue it. However, he felt that they wouldn’t be successful unless IBM departed from its long-standing business model.

Mion’s plan called for three major departures from how IBM traditionally did business. Mion felt that, if IBM wanted to compete in the microcomputer market, it would need to:
:a) Greatly reduce manufacturing costs by using standard, off-the-shelf components (e.g., disk drives, CRTs, power supplies, keyboards) in order to produce a competitively priced microcomputer
:b) Use a low-cost, third-party operating system. Mion felt that this was imperative in order to foster a cottage industry that could develop a broad array of applications that would help small businesses justify the purchase of a computer. Mion recommended Digital Research’s CP/M and a new O/S called MS-DOS from a little-known company named Microsoft.
:c) Allow its microcomputers to be sold and serviced by a distribution channel consisting of independent resellers. (At that time, IBM had been experimenting with a chain of IBM Business Systems Center storefronts but their least-expensive computer cost $14,000.)

That plan made its way up the chain of command but was ultimately rejected in the fall. The top IBM executives reaffirmed that all “IBM” computers, and their major components, must be developed, manufactured, sold, and serviced by IBM.

In January of 1980, Tandy released their Annual Report and, as was predicted in Mion&#x27;s plan, it confirmed that their 1979 shipments had exceeded 100,000 TRS-80s (about $50 million worth). IBM quickly dusted off Mion’s marketing plan.

In 1980, IBM president John Opel, recognizing the value of entering this growing market, assigned William C. Lowe and Philip Don Estridge as heads of the new Entry Level Systems unit in Boca Raton, Florida. Market research found that computer dealers were very interested in selling an IBM product, but they insisted the company use a design based on standard parts, not IBM-designed ones so that stores could perform their own repairs rather than requiring customers to send machines back to IBM for service. Another source cites time pressure as the reason for the decision to use third-party components.

Atari proposed to IBM in 1980 that it act as original equipment manufacturer for an IBM microcomputer, a potential solution to IBM&#x27;s known inability to move quickly to meet a rapidly changing market. The idea of acquiring Atari was considered but rejected in favor of a proposal by Lowe that by forming an independent internal working group and abandoning all traditional IBM methods, a design could be delivered within a year and a prototype within 30 days. The prototype worked poorly but was presented with a detailed business plan which proposed that the new computer have an open architecture, use non-proprietary components and software, and be sold through retail stores, all contrary to IBM practice. It also estimated sales of 220,000 computers over three years, more than IBM&#x27;s entire installed base.

This swayed the Corporate Management Committee, which converted the group into a business unit named &quot;Project Chess&quot;, and provided the necessary funding and authority to do whatever was needed to develop the computer in the given timeframe. The team received permission to expand to 150 people by the end of 1980, and in one day more than 500 IBM employees called in asking to join.

=== Design process ===
The design process was kept under a policy of strict secrecy, with all other IBM divisions kept in the dark about the project.

Several CPUs were considered, including the Texas Instruments TMS9900, Motorola 68000 and Intel 8088. The 68000 was considered the best choice, but was not production-ready like the others. The IBM 801 RISC processor was also considered, since it was considerably more powerful than the other options, but rejected due to the design constraint to use off-the-shelf parts. The TMS9900 was rejected as it was inferior to the Intel 8088.

IBM chose the 8088 over the similar but superior 8086 because Intel offered a better price for the former and could provide more units, and the 8088&#x27;s 8-bit bus reduced the cost of the rest of the computer. The 8088 had the advantage that IBM already had familiarity with the 8085 from designing the IBM System/23 Datamaster. The 62-pin expansion bus slots were also designed to be similar to the Datamaster slots, and its keyboard design and layout became the Model F keyboard shipped with the PC, but otherwise the PC design differed in many ways.

The 8088 motherboard was designed in 40 days, with a working prototype created in four months, demonstrated in January 1981. The design was essentially complete by April 1981, when it was handed off to the manufacturing team. PCs were assembled in an IBM plant in Boca Raton, with components made at various IBM and third party factories. The monitor was an existing design from IBM Japan; the printer was manufactured by Epson. Because none of the functional components were designed by IBM, they obtained only a handful of patents on the PC, covering such features as the bytecoding for color monitors, DMA access operation, and the keyboard interface. They were never enforced. 

Many of the designers were computer hobbyists who owned their own computers, including many Apple II owners, which influenced the decisions to design the computer with an open architecture and publish technical information so others could create compatible software and expansion slot peripherals.

During the design process IBM avoided vertical integration as much as possible, for example choosing to license Microsoft BASIC rather than utilizing the in-house version of BASIC used for mainframes due to the better existing public familiarity with the Microsoft version.

=== Debut ===
The IBM PC debuted on August 12, 1981, after a twelve-month development. Pricing started at $1,565 for a configuration with 16 KB RAM, Color Graphics Adapter, keyboard, and no disk drives. The price was designed to compete with comparable machines in the market. For comparison, the Datamaster, announced two weeks earlier as IBM&#x27;s least expensive computer, cost $10,000.

IBM&#x27;s marketing campaign licensed the likeness of Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s character &quot;The Little Tramp&quot; for a series of advertisements based on Chaplin&#x27;s movies, played by Billy Scudder.

The PC was IBM&#x27;s first attempt to sell a computer through retail channels rather than directly to customers. Because IBM did not have retail experience, they partnered with the retail chains ComputerLand and Sears, who provided important knowledge of the marketplace and became the main outlets for the PC. More than 190 ComputerLand stores already existed, while Sears was in the process of creating a handful of in-store computer centers for sale of the new product.

Reception was overwhelmingly positive, with analysts estimating sales volume in the billions of dollars in the first few years after release. After release, IBM&#x27;s PC immediately became the talk of the entire computing industry. Dealers were overwhelmed with orders, including customers offering pre-payment for machines with no guaranteed delivery date. By the time the machine began shipping, the term &quot;PC&quot; was becoming a household name.

=== Success ===
Sales exceeded IBM&#x27;s expectations by as much as 800% (9x), with the company at one point shipping as many as 40,000 PCs per month. IBM estimated that home users made up 50 to 70% of purchases from retail stores. In 1983, IBM sold more than 750,000 machines, while Digital Equipment Corporation, one of the companies whose success had spurred IBM to enter the market, sold only 69,000.

Software support from the industry grew rapidly, with the IBM nearly instantly becoming the primary target for most microcomputer software development. One publication counted 753 software packages available a year after the PC&#x27;s release, four times as many as were available for the Macintosh a year after its launch. Hardware support also grew rapidly, with 30–40 companies competing to sell memory expansion cards within a year.

By 1984, IBM&#x27;s revenue from the PC market was $4 billion, more than twice that of Apple. A 1983 study of corporate customers found that two thirds of large customers standardizing on one computer chose the PC, while only 9% chose Apple. A 1985 &quot;Fortune&quot; survey found that 56% of American companies with personal computers used PCs while 16% used Apple.

Almost as soon as the PC reached the market, rumors of clones began, and the first legal PC-compatible clone—the MPC 1600 by Columbia Data Products—was released in June 1982, less than a year after the PC&#x27;s debut.

Eventually, IBM sold its PC business to Lenovo in 2004.

== Hardware ==

For low cost and a quick design turnaround time, the hardware design of the IBM PC used entirely &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; parts from third party manufacturers, rather than unique hardware designed by IBM.

The PC is housed in a wide, short steel chassis intended to support the weight of a CRT monitor. The front panel is made of plastic, with an opening where one or two disk drives can be installed. The back panel houses a power inlet and switch, a keyboard connector, a cassette connector and a series of tall vertical slots with blank metal panels which can be removed in order to install expansion cards.

Internally, the chassis is dominated by a motherboard which houses the CPU, built-in RAM, expansion RAM sockets, and slots for expansion cards.

The IBM PC was highly expandable and upgradeable, but the base factory configuration included:
=== Motherboard ===
The PC is built around a single large circuit board called a motherboard which carries the processor, built-in RAM, expansion slots, keyboard and cassette ports, and the various peripheral integrated circuits that connected and controlled the components of the machine.

The peripheral chips included an Intel 8259 PIC, an Intel 8237 DMA controller, and an Intel 8253 PIT. The PIT provides clock &quot;ticks&quot; and dynamic memory refresh timing.

=== CPU and RAM ===
The CPU is an Intel 8088, a cost-reduced form of the Intel 8086 which largely retains the 8086&#x27;s internal 16-bit logic, but exposes only an 8-bit bus. The CPU is clocked at 4.77 MHz, which would eventually become an issue when clones and later PC models offered higher CPU speeds that broke compatibility with software developed for the original PC. The single base clock frequency for the system was 14.31818 MHz, which when divided by 3, yielded the 4.77 MHz for the CPU (which was considered close enough to the then 5 MHz limit of the 8088), and when divided by 4, yielded the required 3.579545 MHz for the NTSC color carrier frequency.

The PC motherboard included a second, empty socket, described by IBM simply as an &quot;auxiliary processor socket&quot;, although the most obvious use was the addition of an Intel 8087 math coprocessor, which improved floating-point math performance.

PC mainboards were manufactured with the first memory bank of initially Mostek 4116-compatible, or later 4164-compatible DIP DRAMs soldered to the board, for a minimum configuration of first just 16 KB, or later 64 KB of RAM.Memory upgrades were provided by IBM and third parties both for socketed installation in three further onboard banks, and as ISA expansion cards. The early 16 KB mainboards could be upgraded to a maximum of 64 KB onboard, and the more common 64 KB revision to a maximum of 256 KB on the motherboard.RAM cards could upgrade either variant further, for a total of 640 KB conventional memory, and possibly several megabytes of expanded memory beyond that, though on PC/XT-class machines, the latter was a very expensive third-party hardware option only available later in the IBM 5150&#x27;s lifecycle and only usable with dedicated software support (i.e. only accessible via a RAM window in the Upper Memory Area); this was relatively rarely equipped and utilized on the original IBM PC, much less fully so, thus the machine&#x27;s maximum RAM configuration as commonly understood was 640 KB.

=== ROM BIOS ===
The BIOS is the firmware of the IBM PC, occupying one 8 KB chip on the motherboard. It provides bootstrap code and a library of common functions that all software can use for many purposes, such as video output, keyboard input, disk access, interrupt handling, testing memory, and other functions. IBM shipped three versions of the BIOS throughout the PC&#x27;s lifespan.

=== Display ===

While most home computers had built-in video output hardware, IBM took the unusual approach of offering two different graphics options, the MDA and CGA cards. The former provided high-resolution monochrome text, but could not display anything except text, while the latter provided medium- and low-resolution color graphics and text.

CGA used the same scan rate as NTSC television, allowing it to provide a composite video output which could be used with any compatible television or composite monitor, as well as a direct-drive TTL output suitable for use with any RGBI monitor using an NTSC scan rate. IBM also sold the 5153 color monitor for this purpose, but it was not available at release and was not released until March 1983.

MDA scanned at a higher frequency and required a proprietary monitor, the IBM 5151. The card also included a built-in printer port.

Both cards could also be installed simultaneously for mixed graphics and text applications. For instance, AutoCAD, Lotus 1-2-3 and other software allowed use of a CGA Monitor for graphics and a separate monochrome monitor for text menus. Third parties went on to provide an enormous variety of aftermarket graphics adapters, such as the Hercules Graphics Card.

The software and hardware of the PC, at release, was designed around a single 8-bit adaptation of the ASCII character set, now known as code page 437.

=== Storage ===
The two bays in the front of the machine could be populated with one or two 5.25″ floppy disk drives, storing 160 KB per disk side for a total of 320 KB of storage on one disk. The floppy drives require a controller card inserted in an expansion slot, and connect with a single ribbon cable with two edge connectors. The IBM floppy controller card provides an external 37-pin D-sub connector for attachment of an external disk drive, although IBM did not offer one for purchase until 1986.

As was common for home computers of the era, the IBM PC offered a port for connecting a cassette data recorder. Unlike the typical home computer however, this was never a major avenue for software distribution, probably because very few PCs were sold without floppy drives. The port was removed on the very next PC model, the XT.

At release, IBM did not offer any hard disk drive option and adding one was difficult - the PC&#x27;s stock power supply had inadequate power to run a hard drive, the motherboard did not support BIOS expansion ROMs which was needed to support a hard drive controller, and both PC DOS and the BIOS had no support for hard disks. After the XT was released, IBM altered the design of the 5150 to add most of these capabilities, except for the upgraded power supply. At this point adding a hard drive was possible, but required the purchase of the IBM 5161 Expansion Unit, which contained a dedicated power supply and included a hard drive.

Although official hard drive support did not exist, the third party market did provide early hard drives that connected to the floppy disk controller, but required a patched version of PC DOS to support the larger disk sizes.

=== Human interface ===

The only option for human interface provided in the base PC was the built-in keyboard port, meant to connect to the included Model F keyboard. The Model F was initially developed for the IBM Datamaster, and was substantially better than the keyboards provided with virtually all home computers on the market at that time in many regards - number of keys, reliability and ergonomics. While some home computers of the time utilized chiclet keyboards or inexpensive mechanical designs, the IBM keyboard provided good ergonomics, reliable and positive tactile key mechanisms and flip-up feet to adjust its angle. Public reception of the keyboard was extremely positive, with some sources describing it as a major selling point of the PC and even as &quot;the best keyboard available on any microcomputer.&quot;

At release, IBM provided a Game Control Adapter which offered a 15-pin port intended for the connection of up to two joysticks, each having two analog axes and two buttons. (The early PCs predated the advent of the &quot;Windows, Icons, Mouse, Pointer&quot; concept and so did not have a mouse.)

=== Communications ===
Connectivity to other computers and peripherals was initially provided through serial and parallel ports.

IBM provided a serial card based on an 8250 UART. The BIOS supports up to two serial ports.

IBM provided two different options for connecting Centronics-compatible parallel printers. One was the IBM Printer Adapter, and the other was integrated into the MDA as the IBM Monochrome Display and Printer Adapter.

=== Expansion ===
The expansion capability of the IBM PC was very significant to its success in the market. Some publications highlighted IBM&#x27;s uncharacteristic decision to publish complete, thorough specifications of the system bus and memory map immediately on release, with the intention of fostering a market of compatible third-party hardware and software.

The motherboard includes five 62-pin card edge connectors which are connected to the CPU&#x27;s I/O lines. IBM referred to these as &quot;I/O slots&quot;, but after the expansion of the PC clone industry they became retroactively known as the ISA bus. At the back of the machine is a metal panel, integrated into the steel chassis of the system unit, with a series of vertical slots lined up with each card slot.

Most expansion cards have a matching metal bracket which slots into one of these openings, serving two purposes. First, a screw inserted through a tab on the bracket into the chassis fastens the card securely in place, preventing the card from wiggling out of place. Second, any ports the card provides for external attachment are bolted to the bracket, keeping them secured in place as well.

The PC expansion slots can accept an enormous variety of expansion hardware, adding capabilities such as:

* Graphics
* Sound
* Mouse support
* Expanded memory
* Joystick port
* Additional serial or parallel ports
* Networking
* Connection to proprietary industrial or scientific equipment

The market reacted as IBM had intended, and within a year or two of the PC&#x27;s release the available options for expansion hardware were immense.

==== 5161 Expansion Unit ====
The expandability of the PC was important, but had significant limitations.

One major limitation was the inability to install a hard drive, as described above. Another was that there were only five expansion slots, which tended to get filled up by essential hardware - a PC with a graphics card, memory expansion, parallel card and serial card was left with only one open slot, for instance.

IBM rectified these problems in the later XT, which included more slots and support for an internal hard drive, but at the same time released the 5161 Expansion Unit, which could be used with either the XT or the original PC. The 5161 connected to the PC system unit using a cable and a card plugged into an expansion slot, and provided a second system chassis with more expansion slots and a hard drive.

==Software==

IBM initially announced intent to support multiple operating systems: CP/M-86, UCSD p-System, and an in-house product called IBM PC DOS, based on 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products and provided by Microsoft. In practice, IBM&#x27;s expectation and intent was for the market to primarily use PC DOS. CP/M-86 was not available for six months after the PC&#x27;s release and received extremely few orders once it was, and p-System was also not available at release. PC DOS rapidly established itself as the standard OS for the PC and remained the standard for over a decade, with a variant being sold by Microsoft themselves as MS-DOS.

The PC included BASIC in ROM (four 8 KB chips), a common feature of 1980s home computers. Its ROM BASIC supported the cassette tape interface, but PC DOS did not, limiting use of that interface to BASIC only.

PC DOS version 1.00 supported only 160 KB SSDD floppies, but version 1.1, which was released nine months after the PC&#x27;s introduction, supported 160 KB SSDD and 320 KB DSDD floppies. Support for the slightly larger nine sector per track 180 KB and 360 KB formats was added in March 1983.

Third-party software support grew extremely quickly, and within a year the PC platform was supplied with a vast array of titles for any conceivable purpose.

==Reception==
Reception of the IBM PC was extremely positive. Even before its release reviewers were impressed by the advertised specifications of the machine, and upon its release reviews praised virtually every aspect of its design both in comparison to contemporary machines and with regards to new and unexpected features.

Praise was directed at the build quality of the PC, in particular its keyboard, IBM&#x27;s decision to use open specifications to encourage third party software and hardware development, their speed at delivering documentation and the quality therein, the quality of the video display, and the use of commodity components from established suppliers in the electronics industry. The price was considered extremely competitive compared to the value per dollar of competing machines.

Two years after its release, &quot;Byte&quot; magazine retrospectively concluded that the PC had succeeded both because of its features – an 80-column screen, open architecture, and high-quality keyboard – and the failure of other computer manufacturers to achieve these features first:

&quot;Creative Computing&quot; that year named the PC the best desktop computer between $2,000 and $4,000, praising its vast hardware and software selection, manufacturer support, and resale value.

Many IBM PCs remained in service long after their technology became largely obsolete. For instance, as of June 2006 (23–25 years after release) IBM PC and XT models were still in use at the majority of U.S. National Weather Service upper-air observing sites, processing data returned from radiosondes attached to weather balloons.

Due to its status as the first entry in the extremely influential PC industry, the original IBM PC remains valuable as a collector&#x27;s item. , the system had a market value of $50–$500.

==Model line==

IBM sold a number of computers under the &quot;Personal Computer&quot; or &quot;PC&quot; name throughout the 1980s. The name was not used for several years before being reused for the IBM PC Series in the 1990s and early 2000s.
As with all PC-derived systems, all IBM PC models are nominally software-compatible, although some timing-sensitive software will not run correctly on models with faster CPUs.

==Clones==

Because the IBM PC was based on commodity hardware rather than unique IBM components, and because its operation was extensively documented by IBM, creating machines that were fully compatible with the PC offered few challenges other than the creation of a compatible BIOS ROM.

Simple duplication of the IBM PC BIOS was a direct violation of copyright law, but soon into the PC&#x27;s life the BIOS was reverse-engineered by companies like Compaq, Phoenix Software Associates, American Megatrends and Award, who either built their own computers that could run the same software and use the same expansion hardware as the PC, or sold their BIOS code to other manufacturers who wished to build their own machines.

These machines became known as IBM compatibles or &quot;clones&quot;, and software was widely marketed as compatible with &quot;IBM PC or 100% compatible&quot;. Shortly thereafter, clone manufacturers began to make improvements and extensions to the hardware, such as by using faster processors like the NEC V20, which executed the same software as the 8088 at a higher speed up to 10 MHz.

The clone market eventually became so large that it lost its associations with the original PC and became a set of de facto standards established by various hardware manufacturers.

<text>The counties of Ireland (Irish: ) are historic administrative divisions of the island. They began as Norman structures, and as the powers exercised by the Cambro-Norman barons and the Old English nobility waned over time, new offices of political control came to be established at a county level. The number of counties varied depending on the time period, however thirty-two is the traditionally accepted and used number.

Upon the partition of Ireland in 1921, six of the traditional counties became part of Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland, counties ceased to be used for local government in 1973; districts are instead used. In the Republic of Ireland, some counties have been split resulting in the creation of new counties: there are currently 26 counties, 3 cities and 2 cities and counties that demarcate areas of local government in the Republic.

==Terminology==
The word &quot;county&quot; has come to be used in different senses for different purposes. In common usage, it can mean the 32 counties that existed prior to 1838 – the so-called traditional counties, 26 of which are in the Republic of Ireland. However, the Local Government Acts define counties to include separate counties within the traditional county of Dublin.

In Ireland, the word &quot;county&quot; nearly always precedes the county name; thus &quot;&quot;County&quot; Roscommon&quot; in Ireland as opposed to &quot;Roscommon &quot;County&quot;&quot; in Michigan, United States. The former &quot;King&#x27;s County&quot; and &quot;Queen&#x27;s County&quot; were exceptions; however, these are now County Offaly and County Laois, respectively. The abbreviation Co. is used, as in &quot;Co. Roscommon&quot;. The counties in Dublin created in 1994 often drop the word &quot;county&quot; entirely, or use it after the name; thus, for example, internet search engines show many more uses (on Irish sites) of &quot;Fingal&quot; than of either &quot;County Fingal&quot; or &quot;Fingal County&quot;. Although official guidance does not use the term county as part of its name, the local council uses all three forms. In informal use, the word &quot;county&quot; is often dropped except where necessary to distinguish between county and town or city; thus &quot;Offaly&quot; rather than &quot;County Offaly&quot;, but &quot;County Antrim&quot; to distinguish it from Antrim town. The synonym &quot;shire&quot; is not used for Irish counties, although the Marquessate of Downshire was named in 1789 after County Down.

Parts of some towns and cities were exempt from the jurisdiction of the counties that surrounded them. These towns and cities had the status of a county corporate, often granted by royal charter, which had all the judicial, administrative and revenue-raising powers of the regular counties.

==History==

===Pre-Norman divisions of Ireland===
The political geography of Ireland can be traced with some accuracy from the 6th century. At that time Ireland was divided into a patchwork of petty kingdoms with a fluid political hierarchy which, in general, had three traditional grades of king. The lowest level of political control existed at the level of the (pl. ). A was an autonomous group of people of independent political jurisdiction under a rí túaithe, that is, a local petty king. About 150 such units of government existed. Each &quot;rí túaithe&quot; was in turn subject to a regional or &quot;over-king&quot; (). There may have been as many as 20 genuine ruiri in Ireland at any time.

A &quot;king of over-kings&quot; () was often a provincial () or semi-provincial king to whom several ruiri were subordinate. No more than six genuine rí ruirech were ever contemporary. Usually, only five such &quot;king of over-kings&quot; existed contemporaneously and so are described in the Irish annals as &quot;fifths&quot; (). The areas under the control of these kings were: Ulster (), Leinster (), Connacht (), Munster () and Mide (). Later record-makers dubbed them &quot;provinces&quot;, in imitation of Roman provinces. In the Norman period, the historic fifths of Leinster and Meath gradually merged, mainly due to the impact of the Pale, which straddled both, thereby forming the present-day province of Leinster.

The use of provinces as divisions of political power was supplanted by the system of counties after the Norman invasion. In modern times clusters of counties have been attributed to certain provinces but these clusters have no legal status. They are today seen mainly in a sporting context, as Ireland&#x27;s four professional rugby teams play under the names of the provinces, and the Gaelic Athletic Association has separate Provincial councils and Provincial championships.

===Plantagenet era===
====Lordships====
With the arrival of Cambro-Norman knights in 1169, the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland commenced. This was followed in 1172 by the invasion of King Henry II of England, commencing English royal involvement.

After his intervention in Ireland, Henry II effectively divided the English colony into liberties also known as lordships. These were effectively palatine counties and differed from ordinary counties in that they were disjoined from the crown and that whoever they were granted to essentially had the same authority as the king and that the king&#x27;s writ had no effect except a writ of error. This covered all land within the county that was not church land. The reason for the creation of such powerful entities in Ireland was due to the lack of authority the English crown had there. The same process occurred after the Norman conquest of England where despite there being a strong central government, county palatines were needed in border areas with Wales and Scotland. In Ireland this meant that the land was divided and granted to Richard de Clare and his followers who became lords (and sometimes called earls), with the only land which the English crown had any direct control over being the sea-coast towns and territories immediately adjacent.

Of Henry II&#x27;s grants, at least three of them—Leinster to Richard de Clare; Meath to Walter de Lacy; Ulster to John de Courcy—were equivalent to palatine counties in their bestowing of royal jurisdiction to the grantees. Other grants include the liberties of Connaught and Tipperary.

====Division of lordships====
These initial lordships were later subdivided into smaller &quot;liberties&quot;, which appear to have enjoyed the same privileges as their predecessors. The division of Leinster and Munster into smaller counties is commonly attributed to King John, mostly due to a lack of prior documentary evidence, which has been destroyed. However, they may have had an earlier origin. These counties were: in Leinster: Carlow (also known as Catherlogh), Dublin, Kildare, Kilkenny, Louth (also known as Uriel), Meath, Wexford, Waterford; in Munster: Cork, Limerick, Kerry and Tipperary. It is thought that these counties did not have the administrative purpose later attached to them until late in the reign of King John and that no new counties were created until the Tudor dynasty.

The most important office in those that were palatine was that of seneschal. In those liberties that came under Crown control this office was held by a sheriff. The sovereign could and did appoint sheriffs in palatines; however, their power was confined to the church lands, and they became known as sheriffs of a County of the Cross, of which there seem to have been as many in Ireland as there were counties palatine.

The exact boundaries of the liberties and shrievalties appear to have been in constant flux throughout the Plantagenet period, seemingly in line with the extent of English control. For example, in 1297 it is recorded that Kildare had extended to include the lands that now comprise the modern-day counties of Offaly, Laois (Leix) and Wicklow (Arklow). Some attempts had also been made to extend the county system to Ulster.

However the Bruce Invasion of Ireland in 1315 resulted in the collapse of effective English rule in Ireland, with the land controlled by the crown continually shrinking to encompass Dublin, and parts of Meath, Louth and Kildare. Throughout the rest of Ireland, English rule was upheld by the earls of Desmond, Ormond, and Kildare (all created in the 14th-century), with the extension of the county system all but impossible. During the reign of Edward III (1327–77) all franchises, grants and liberties had been temporarily revoked with power passed to the king&#x27;s sheriffs over the seneschals. This may have been due to the disorganisation caused by the Bruce invasion as well as the renouncing of the Connaught Burkes of their allegiance to the crown.

The Earls of Ulster divided their territory up into counties; however, these are not considered part of the Crown&#x27;s shiring of Ireland. In 1333, the Earldom of Ulster is recorded as consisting of seven counties: Antrim, Blathewyc, Cragferus, Coulrath, del Art, Dun (also known as Ladcathel), and Twescard.

===Passage to the Crown===
Of the original lordships or palatine counties:
*Leinster had passed from Richard de Clare to his daughter, Isabel de Clare, who had married William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke (second creation of title). This marriage was confirmed by King John, with Isabel&#x27;s lands given to William as consort. The liberty was afterwards divided into five—Carlow, Kildare, Kilkenny, Leix and Wexford—one for each of Marshal&#x27;s co-heiresses.
*Meath was divided between the granddaughters of Walter de Lacy: Maud and Margery. Maud&#x27;s half became the liberty of Trim, and she married Geoffrey de Geneville. Margery&#x27;s half retained the name Meath, and she married John de Verdon. After the marriage of Maud&#x27;s daughter Joan to Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, Trim later passed via their descendants to the English Crown. Meath, which had passed to the Talbots, was resumed by Henry VIII under the Statute of Absentees.
*Ulster was regranted to the de Lacys from John de Courcy, whilst Connaught, which had been granted to William de Burgh, was at some point divided into the liberties of Connaught and Roscommon. William&#x27;s grandson Walter de Burgh was in 1264 also made lord of Ulster, bringing both Connaught and Ulster under the same lord. In 1352 Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster married Lionel of Antwerp, a son of king Edward III. Their daughter Philippa married Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March. Upon the death of Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March in 1425, both lordships were inherited by Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York and thus passed to the Crown.
*Tipperary was resumed by King James I, however under Charles II in 1662 was reconstituted for James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde.

With the passing of liberties to the Crown, the number of Counties of the Cross declined, and only one, Tipperary, survived into the Stuart era; the others had ceased to exist by the reign of Henry VIII.

===Tudor era===
It was not until the Tudors, specifically the reign of Henry VIII (1509–47), that crown control started to once again extend throughout Ireland. Having declared himself King of Ireland in 1541, Henry VIII went about converting Irish chiefs into feudal subjects of the crown with land divided into districts, which were eventually amalgamated into the modern counties. County boundaries were still ill-defined; however, in 1543 Meath was split into Meath and Westmeath. Around 1545, the Byrnes and O&#x27;Tooles, both native septs who had constantly been a pain for the English administration of the Pale, petitioned the Lord Deputy of Ireland to turn their district into its own county, Wicklow. However, this was ignored.

During the reigns of the last two Tudor monarchs, Mary I (1553–58) and Elizabeth I (1558–1603), the majority of the work for the foundation of the modern counties was carried out under the auspices of three Lord Deputies: Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, Sir Henry Sydney, and Sir John Perrot.

Mary&#x27;s reign saw the first addition of actual new counties since the reign of King John. Radclyffe had conquered the districts of Glenmaliry, Irry, Leix, Offaly, and Slewmargy from the O&#x27;Moores and O&#x27;Connors, and in 1556 a statute decreed that Offaly and part of Glenmaliry would be made into the county of King&#x27;s County, whilst the rest of Glenmarliry along with Irry, Leix and Slewmargy was formed into Queen&#x27;s County. Radclyffe brought forth legislation to shire all land as yet unshired throughout Ireland and sought to divide the island into six parts—Connaught, Leinster, Meath, Nether Munster, Ulster, and Upper Munster. However, his administrative reign in Ireland was cut short, and it was not until the reign of Mary&#x27;s successor, Elizabeth, that this legislation was re-adopted. Under Elizabeth, Radclyffe was brought back to implement it.

Sydney during his three tenures as Lord Deputy created two presidencies to administer Connaught and Munster. He shired Connaught into the counties of Galway, Mayo, Roscommon, and Sligo. In 1565 the territory of the O&#x27;Rourkes within Roscommon was made into the county of Leitrim. In an attempt to reduce the importance of the province of Munster, Sydney, using the River Shannon as a natural boundary took the former kingdom of Thomond (North Munster) and made it into the county of Clare as part of the presidency of Connaught in 1569. In 1569 the Irish Parliament passed &quot;An Act for turning of Countries that be not yet Shire Grounds into Shire Grounds&quot;. A commission headed by Perrot and others in 1571 declared that the territory of Desmond in Munster was to be made a county of itself, and it had its own sheriff appointed, however in 1606 it was merged with the county of Kerry. In 1575 Sydney made an expedition to Ulster to plan its shiring. However, nothing came to bear.

In 1578 the go-ahead was given for turning the districts of the Byrnes and O&#x27;Tooles into the county of Wicklow. However, with the outbreak of war in Munster and then Ulster, they resumed their independence. Sydney also sought to split Wexford into two smaller counties, the northern half of which was to be called Ferns, but the matter was dropped as it was considered impossible to properly administer. The territory of the O&#x27;Farrells of Annaly, however, which was in Westmeath, in 1583 was formed into the county of Longford and transferred to Connaught. The Desmond rebellion (1579–83) that was taking place in Munster stopped Sydney&#x27;s work and by the time it had been defeated Sir John Perrot was now Lord Deputy, being appointed in 1584.

Perrot would be most remembered for shiring the only province of Ireland that remained effectively outside of English control, that of Ulster. Prior to his tenancy the only proper county in Ulster was Louth, which had been part of the Pale. There were two other long recognised entities north of Louth—Antrim and Down—that had at one time been &quot;counties&quot; of the Earldom of Ulster and were regarded as apart from the unreformed parts of the province. The date Antrim and Down became constituted is unknown. Perrot was recalled in 1588 and the shiring of Ulster would for two decades basically exist on paper as the territory affected remained firmly outside of English control until the defeat of Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone in the Nine Years&#x27; War. These counties were: Armagh, Cavan, Coleraine, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan, and Tyrone. Cavan was formed from the territory of the O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s of East Breifne in 1584 and had been transferred from Connaught to Ulster. After O&#x27;Neill and his allies fled Ireland in 1607 in the Flight of the Earls, their lands became escheated to the Crown and the county divisions designed by Perrot were used as the basis for the grants of the subsequent Plantation of Ulster effected by King James I, which officially started in 1609.

Around 1600 near the end of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, Clare was made an entirely distinct presidency of its own under the Earls of Thomond and would not return to being part of Munster until after the Restoration in 1660.

It was not until the subjugation of the Byrnes and O&#x27;Tooles by Lord Deputy Sir Arthur Chichester that in 1606 Wicklow was finally shired. This county was one of the last to be created, yet was the closest to the centre of English power in Ireland.

County Londonderry was incorporated in 1613 by the merger of County Coleraine with the barony of Loughinsholin (in County Tyrone), the North West Liberties of Londonderry (in County Donegal), and the North East Liberties of Coleraine (in County Antrim).

===Demarcation of counties and Tipperary===
Throughout the Elizabethan era and the reign of her successor James I, the exact boundaries of the provinces and the counties they consisted of remained uncertain. In 1598 Meath is considered a province in Hayne&#x27;s &quot;Description of Ireland&quot;, and included the counties of Cavan, East Meath, Longford, and Westmeath. This contrasts to George Carew&#x27;s 1602 survey where there were only four provinces with Longford part of Connaught and Cavan not mentioned at all with only three counties mentioned for Ulster. During Perrot&#x27;s tenure as Lord President of Munster before he became Lord Deputy, Munster contained as many as eight counties rather than the six it later consisted of. These eight counties were: the five English counties of Cork, Limerick, Kerry, Tipperary, and Waterford; and the three Irish counties of Desmond, Ormond, and Thomond.

Perrot&#x27;s divisions in Ulster were for the main confirmed by a series of inquisitions between 1606 and 1610 that settled the demarcation of the counties of Connaught and Ulster. John Speed&#x27;s &quot;Description of the Kingdom of Ireland&quot; in 1610 showed that there was still a vagueness over what counties constituted the provinces, however, Meath was no longer reckoned a province. By 1616 when the Attorney General for Ireland Sir John Davies departed Ireland, almost all counties had been delimited. The only exception was the county of Tipperary, which still belonged to the palatinate of Ormond.

Tipperary would remain an anomaly being in effect two counties, one palatine, the other of the Cross until 1715 during the reign of King George I when an act abolished the &quot;royalties and liberties of the County of Tipperary&quot; and &quot;that whatsoever hath been denominated or called Tipperary or Cross Tipperary, shall henceforth be and remain one county forever, under the name of the County of Tipperary.&quot; Between 1838 and 2014, County Tipperary was divided into two ridings/counties, North Tipperary and South Tipperary.

===Sub-divisions of counties===
To correspond with the subdivisions of the English shires into honours or baronies, Irish counties were granted out to the Anglo-Norman noblemen in cantreds, later known as baronies, which in turn were subdivided, as in England, into parishes. Parishes were composed of townlands. However, in many cases, these divisions correspond to earlier, pre-Norman, divisions. While there are 331 baronies in Ireland, and more than a thousand civil parishes, there are around sixty thousand townlands that range in size from one to several thousand hectares. Townlands were often traditionally divided into smaller units called &quot;quarters&quot;, but these subdivisions are not legally defined.

===Counties corporate===
The following towns/cities had charters specifically granting them the status of a county corporate:
* County of the Town of Carrickfergus (by 1325)
* County of the City of Cork (1608)
* County of the Town of Drogheda (1412)
* County of the City of Dublin (1548)
* County of the Town of Galway (1610)
* County of the City of Kilkenny (1610)
* County of the City of Limerick (1609)
* County of the City of Waterford (1574)
The only entirely new counties created in 1898 were the county boroughs of Londonderry and Belfast. Carrickfergus, Drogheda and Kilkenny were abolished; Galway was also abolished, but recreated in 1986.

===Exceptions to the county system of control===
Regional presidencies of Connacht and Munster remained in existence until 1672, with special powers over their subsidiary counties. Tipperary remained a county palatine until the passing of the County Palatine of Tipperary Act 1715, with different officials and procedures from other counties. At the same time, Dublin, until the 19th century, had ecclesiastical liberties with rules outside those applying to the rest of Dublin city and county. Exclaves of the county of Dublin existed in counties Kildare and Wicklow. At least eight other enclaves of one county inside another, or between two others, existed. The various enclaves and exclaves were merged into neighbouring and surrounding counties, primarily in the mid-19th century under a series of Orders in Council.

===Evolution of functions===
The Church of Ireland exercised functions at the level of a civil parish that would later be exercised by county authorities. Vestigial feudal power structures of major old estates remained well into the 18th century. Urban corporations operated individual royal charters. Management of counties came to be exercised by grand juries. Members of grand juries were the local payers of rates who historically held judicial functions, taking maintenance roles in regard to roads and bridges, and the collection of &quot;county cess&quot; taxes. They were usually composed of wealthy &quot;country gentlemen&quot; (i.e. landowners, farmers and merchants):A country gentleman as a member of a Grand Jury...levied the local taxes, appointed the nephews of his old friends to collect them, and spent them when they were gathered in. He controlled the boards of guardians and appointed the dispensary doctors, regulated the diet of paupers, inflicted fines and administered the law at petty sessions. The counties were initially used for judicial purposes, but began to take on some governmental functions in the 17th century, notably with grand juries.

===19th and 20th centuries===
In 1836, the use of counties as local government units was further developed, with grand-jury powers extended under the Grand Jury (Ireland) Act 1836. The traditional county of Tipperary was split into two judicial counties (or ridings) following the establishment of assize courts in 1838. Also in that year, local poor law boards, with a mix of magistrates and elected &quot;guardians&quot; took over the health and social welfare functions of the grand juries.

Sixty years later, a more radical reorganisation of local government took place with the passage of the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898. This Act established a county council for each of the thirty-three Irish administrative counties. Elected county councils took over the powers of the grand juries. The boundaries of the traditional counties changed on a number of occasions. The 1898 Act changed the boundaries of Counties Galway, Clare, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo, Waterford, Kilkenny, Meath and Louth, and others. County Tipperary was divided into two regions: North Riding and South Riding. Areas of the cities of Belfast, Cork, Dublin, Limerick, Derry and Waterford were carved from their surrounding counties to become county boroughs in their own right and given powers equivalent to those of administrative counties.

Under the Government of Ireland Act 1920, the island was partitioned between Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland. For the purposes of the Act, ... Northern Ireland shall consist of the parliamentary counties of Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry and Tyrone, and the parliamentary boroughs of Belfast and Londonderry, and Southern Ireland shall consist of so much of Ireland as is not comprised within the said parliamentary counties and boroughs.

The county and county borough borders were thus used to determine the line of partition. Southern Ireland shortly afterwards became the Irish Free State. This partition was entrenched in the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which was ratified in 1922, by which the Irish Free State left the United Kingdom with Northern Ireland making the decision to not separate two days later.

====Historic and traditional counties====
Areas that were shired by 1607 and continued as counties until the local government reforms of 1836, 1898 and 2001 are sometimes referred to as &quot;traditional&quot; or &quot;historic&quot; counties. These were distinct from the counties corporate that existed in some of the larger towns and cities, although linked to the county at large for other purposes. From 1898 to 2001, areas with county councils were known as administrative counties, while the counties corporate were designated as county boroughs. From 2001, local government areas were divided between counties and cities. From 2014, they were divided into counties, cities, and cities and counties.

==Current usage==
===In the Republic of Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland, the traditional counties are, in general, the basis for local government, planning and community development purposes and are still generally respected for other purposes. They are governed by county councils. Administrative borders have been altered to allocate various towns exclusively into one county having been originally split between two counties.

At the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922, there were 27 administrative counties (with County Tipperary divided into the administrative counties of North Tipperary and South Tipperary) and 4 county boroughs, Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.

Rural districts were abolished by the Local Government Act 1925 and the Local Government (Dublin) Act 1930 amidst widespread allegations of corruption.

Under the Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation Act 1976, part of the urban area of Drogheda, which lay in County Meath, was transferred to County Louth on 1 January 1977. This resulted in the land area of County Louth increasing slightly at the expense of County Meath. The possibility of a similar action with regard to Waterford City has been raised in recent years, though opposition from Kilkenny has been strong.

In 1985, Galway became a county borough.

County Dublin was abolished as an administrative county in 1994 and divided into three administrative counties: Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Fingal, and South Dublin.

Under the Local Government Act 2001, the county boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford were re-styled as cities, with the same status in law as counties. The term administrative county was replaced with the term &quot;county&quot;.

The cities of Limerick and Waterford were merged with their respective counties by the Local Government Reform Act 2014, to form new &quot;cities and counties&quot;. The same Act also abolished North Tipperary and South Tipperary and re-established County Tipperary as an administrative unit.

There are now 31 local government areas: 26 counties, three cities, and two cities and counties.

Since 2014, local authorities send representatives to Regional Assemblies overseeing three regions for the purposes of European Structural and Investment Funds: Southern Region, the Eastern and Midland Region, and the Northern and Western Region. From 1994 to 2014, there were eight Regional Authorities, dissolved under the Local Government Reform Act 2014.

As placenames, there is a distinction between the traditional counties, listed as &quot;counties&quot;, and those created as local government areas, listed as &quot;administrative counties&quot;.

====Education====
In 2013 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) were formed throughout the Republic of Ireland, replacing the system of Vocational Education Committees (VECs) created in 1930. Originally, VECs were formed for each administrative county and county borough, and also in a number of larger towns, and were legally sub-committees of the relevant authorities. In 1997 the majority of town VECs were absorbed by the surrounding county authorities. The 33 VEC areas were reduced to 16 ETB areas, with each consisting of one or more local government county or city areas.

The Institute of technology system was organised by committee areas or &quot;functional areas&quot;; these areas retain their legal basis but are not as important as originally envisioned as the institutes are now more national in character. The functional areas are only of significance today when selecting governing councils; similarly, Dublin Institute of Technology was originally a group of several colleges within the aegis of the City of Dublin VEC.

====Elections====
Where possible, Dáil constituencies follow county boundaries. Under the Electoral Act 1997, as amended, a Constituency Commission is established following the publication of preliminary census figures every five years. The commission is charged with defining constituency boundaries, and the 1997 Act provides that &quot;the breaching of county boundaries shall be avoided as far as practicable&quot;. This provision does not apply to the boundaries between cities and counties, or between the three counties in the Dublin area.

This system usually results in more populated counties having several constituencies: Dublin, including Dublin city, is subdivided into twelve constituencies, Cork into five. On the other hand, smaller counties such as Carlow and Kilkenny or Laois and Offaly may be paired to form constituencies. Leitrim, Ireland&#x27;s least populated county, was divided between the constituencies of Sligo–North Leitrim and Roscommon–South Leitrim from 2007 to 2016.

Each county, city, and city and county is divided into local electoral areas for the election of councillors. The boundaries of the areas and the number of councillors assigned are fixed from time to time by order of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, following a report by the Local Government Commission, and based on population changes recorded in the census.

===In Northern Ireland===
In Northern Ireland, a major reorganisation of local government in 1973 replaced the six traditional counties and two county boroughs (Belfast and Derry) with 26 single-tier districts for local government purposes. In 2015, as a result of a reform process that started in 2005, these districts were merged to form 11 new single-tier &quot;super districts&quot;.

The six traditional counties remain in use for some purposes, including the three-letter coding of vehicle number plates, the Royal Mail Postcode Address File (which records counties in all addresses although they are no longer required for postcoded mail) and Lord Lieutenancies (for which the former county boroughs are also used). There are no longer official &#x27;county towns&#x27;. However, the counties are still very widely acknowledged, for example as administrative divisions for sporting and cultural organisations.

===Other uses===
The administrative division of the island along the lines of the traditional 32 counties was also adopted by non-governmental and cultural organisations. In particular, the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) continues to organise its activities on the basis of its own system of counties that, throughout the island, correspond almost exactly to the 32 traditional counties in use at the time of the foundation of that organisation in 1884. The GAA also uses the term &quot;county&quot; for some of its organisational units in Britain and further afield. Legal adjustments to county bounds since 1884 have not been reflected in GAA county boards (e.g. Ballaghaderreen GAA which is located in County Roscommon but affiliated to Mayo GAA county board).

==List of counties==
The 35 divisions listed below include the traditional counties of Ireland as well as three created in Dublin in 1994. Twenty-four counties still delimit the remit of local government areas in the Republic of Ireland (in some cases with slightly redrawn boundaries). County Dublin, which was abolished as a distinct administrative entity in 1994, is included, as are the three new administrative counties which took over the functions of the former County Dublin. In Northern Ireland, the counties listed no longer serve this purpose. The Irish-language names of counties in the Republic of Ireland are prescribed by ministerial order, which in the case of three newer counties, omits the word (county). Irish names form the basis for all English-language county names except Waterford, Wexford, and Wicklow, which are of Norse origin.

The &quot;Region&quot; column of the table below, except for the six Northern Ireland counties, indicates Regions as defined under the Local Government Act 1991. These are NUTS 2 statistical regions of Ireland. &quot;County town&quot; is the current or former administrative capital of the county.

The cities of Cork, Dublin, and Galway, which are separate local government areas with the same legal status as counties, are not shown separately. Also omitted are the former county boroughs of Londonderry and Belfast which in Northern Ireland had the same legal status as the six counties until the reorganisation of local government in 1973.

<text>The USC Information Sciences Institute (ISI) is a component of the University of Southern California (USC) Viterbi School of Engineering, and specializes in research and development in information processing, computing, and communications technologies. It is located in Marina del Rey, California.

ISI actively participated in the information revolution, and it played a leading role in developing and managing the early Internet and its predecessor ARPAnet. The Institute conducts basic and applied research supported by more than 20 U.S. government agencies involved in defense, science, health, homeland security, energy and other areas. Annual funding is about $100 million.

ISI employs about 400 research scientists, research programmers, graduate students and administrative staff at its Marina del Rey, California headquarters, in Arlington, Virginia, and in Boston, Massachusetts. About half of the research staff hold PhD degrees, and about 40 are research faculty who teach at USC and advise graduate students. Several senior researchers are tenured USC faculty in the Viterbi School.

==Research and sponsors==
ISI research spans artificial intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, grid computing, cloud computing, quantum computing, microelectronics, supercomputing, nano-satellites and many other areas. AI expertise includes natural language processing, in which ISI has an international reputation, reconfigurable robotics, information integration, motion analysis and social media analysis. Hardware/software expertise includes cyber-physical system security, data mining, reconfigurable computing and cloud computing. In networking, ISI explores Internet resilience, Internet traffic analysis and photonics, among other areas. Researchers also work in scientific data management, wireless technologies, biomimetics and electrical smart grid, in which ISI is advising the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power on a major demonstration project. Another current initiative involves big data brain imaging jointly with the Keck School of Medicine of USC.

Federal agency sponsors include the Air Force Research Laboratory, DARPA, Department of Education, Department of Energy, Department of Homeland Security, National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, and other scientific, technical, and defense-related agencies.

Corporate partners include Chevron Corporation in the Center for Interactive Smart Oilfield Technologies (CiSoft), Lockheed Martin in the USC-Lockheed Martin Quantum Computing Center, and Sparta Inc., a subsidiary of Parsons Corporation in the DETER Project, a cybersecurity research initiative and international testbed. ISI also has partnered with businesses including IBM, Samsung Electronics, Raytheon, GlobalFoundries, Northrop Grumman and Carl Zeiss AG, and currently is working with Micron Technology, Inc., Altera Corporation and Fujitsu Ltd.

ISI also operates MOSIS, a multi-project electronic circuit wafer service that has prototyped more than 60,000 chips since 1981. MOSIS provides design tools and pools circuit designs to produce specialty and low-volume chips for corporations, universities and other research entities worldwide. The Institute also has given rise to several startup and spinoff companies in grid software, geospatial information fusion, machine translation, data integration and other technologies.

==History==
ISI was founded by Keith Uncapher, who headed the computer research group at RAND Corporation in the 1960s and early 1970s. Uncapher decided to leave RAND after his group&#x27;s funding was cut in 1971. He approached the University of California, Los Angeles about creating an off-campus technology institute, but was told that a decision would take 15 months. He then presented the concept to USC, which approved the proposal in five days. ISI was launched with three employees in 1972. Its first proposal was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 30 days for $6 million.

ISI became one of the earliest nodes on ARPANET, the predecessor to the Internet, and in 1977 figured prominently in a demonstration of its international viability. ISI also helped refine the TCP/IP communications protocols fundamental to Net operations, and researcher Paul Mockapetris developed the now-familiar Domain Name System characterized by .com, .org, .net, .gov, and .edu on which the Net still operates. (The names .com, .org et al. were invented at SRI International, an ongoing collaborator.) Steve Crocker originated the Request for Comments (RFC) series, the written record of the network&#x27;s technical structure and operation that both documented and shaped the emerging Internet. Another ISI researcher, Danny Cohen, became first to implement packet voice and packet video over ARPANET, demonstrating the viability of packet switching for real-time applications.

Jonathan Postel collaborated in development of TCP/IP, DNS and the SMTP protocol that supports email. He also edited the RFC for nearly three decades until his sudden death in 1998, when ISI colleagues assumed responsibility. The Institute retained that role until 2009. Postel simultaneously directed the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and its predecessor, which assign Internet addresses. IANA was administered from ISI until a nonprofit organization, ICANN, was created for that purpose in 1998.

==Other achievements==
Some of the first Net security applications, and one of the world&#x27;s first portable computers, also originated at ISI.

ISI researchers also created or co-created the:
*GLOBUS grid computing standard
*LOOM knowledge representation language and environment, or LOOM (ontology) 
*MONARCH supercomputer-on-a-chip
*Soar (cognitive architecture) for developing intelligent behavioral systems
*Pegasus (workflow management)

In 2011, several ISI natural language experts advised the IBM team that created Watson, the computer that became the first machine to win against human competitors on the &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; TV show. In 2012, ISI&#x27;s Kevin Knight spearheaded a successful drive to crack the Copiale cipher, a lengthy encrypted manuscript that had remained unreadable for 250 years. Also in 2012, the USC-Lockheed Martin Quantum Computing Center (QCC) became the first organization to operate a quantum annealing system outside of its manufacturer, D-Wave Systems, Inc. USC, ISI and Lockheed Martin now are performing basic and applied research into quantum computing. A second quantum annealing system is located at NASA Ames Research Center, and is operated jointly by NASA and Google.

The USC Andrew and Erna Viterbi School of Engineering was ranked among the nation&#x27;s top 10 engineering graduate schools by &quot;US News &amp; World Report&quot; in 2015. Including ISI, USC is ranked first nationally in federal computer science research and development expenditures.

==Organizational structure==
ISI is organized into seven divisions focused on differing areas of research expertise:

*Advanced Electronics: MOSIS shared-services integrated circuit research and fabrication, CMOS and post-CMOS concepts, and biomimetics
*Computational Systems and Technology: quantum computing; supercomputing; cloud, wireless, reconfigurable and multicore computing; microarchitecture and electronics; science automation technologies; social networks and space systems
*Informatics Systems Research: grid computing, information security, service-oriented architectures, imaging and medical informatics that aim to transform healthcare discovery processes, practice and delivery.
*Artificial Intelligence: artificial intelligence in natural language, machine translation, information integration, education, robotics and other disciplines.
*Networking and Cybersecurity: internet security research and international testbed, internet measurement and monitoring approaches, and sensor networks that emphasize both networking theory and practice.
*Space Technology and Systems: space research and hands-on involvement for students through the Space Engineering Research Center, operated jointly by ISI and USC.
*Vision, Image, Speech and Text Analytics: ISI&#x27;s Center for Vision, Image, Speech and Text Analytics (VISTA) is an internationally recognized leader in areas such as multimedia signal processing, computer vision, and natural language analysis.

Smaller, specialized research groups operate within almost all divisions.

ISI is led by Executive Director Craig Knoblock, the previous director to the AI division.

<text>Information security is the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks. It is part of information risk management. It typically involves preventing or reducing the probability of unauthorized or inappropriate access to data or the unlawful use, disclosure, disruption, deletion, corruption, modification, inspection, recording, or devaluation of information. It also involves actions intended to reduce the adverse impacts of such incidents. Protected information may take any form, e.g., electronic or physical, tangible (e.g., paperwork), or intangible (e.g., knowledge). Information security&#x27;s primary focus is the balanced protection of data confidentiality, integrity, and availability (also known as the &#x27;CIA&#x27; triad) while maintaining a focus on efficient policy implementation, all without hampering organization productivity. This is largely achieved through a structured risk management process. 

To standardize this discipline, academics and professionals collaborate to offer guidance, policies, and industry standards on passwords, antivirus software, firewalls, encryption software, legal liability, security awareness and training, and so forth. This standardization may be further driven by a wide variety of laws and regulations that affect how data is accessed, processed, stored, transferred, and destroyed. 

While paper-based business operations are still prevalent, requiring their own set of information security practices, enterprise digital initiatives are increasingly being emphasized, with information assurance now typically being dealt with by information technology (IT) security specialists. These specialists apply information security to technology (most often some form of computer system). 

IT security specialists are almost always found in any major enterprise/establishment due to the nature and value of the data within larger businesses. They are responsible for keeping all of the technology within the company secure from malicious attacks that often attempt to acquire critical private information or gain control of the internal systems.

There are many specialist roles in Information Security including securing networks and allied infrastructure, securing applications and databases, security testing, information systems auditing, business continuity planning, electronic record discovery, and digital forensics.
== Definitions ==
Information security standards are techniques generally outlined in published materials that attempt to protect the information of a user or organization. This environment includes users themselves, networks, devices, all software, processes, information in storage or transit, applications, services, and systems that can be connected directly or indirectly to networks.

The principal objective is to reduce the risks, including preventing or mitigating attacks. These published materials consist of tools, policies, security concepts, security safeguards, guidelines, risk management approaches, actions, training, best practices, assurance and technologies.
Various definitions of information security are suggested below, summarized from different sources:

# &quot;Preservation of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Note: In addition, other properties, such as authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation and reliability can also be involved.&quot; (ISO/IEC 27000:2018)
# &quot;The protection of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability.&quot; (CNSS, 2010)
# &quot;Ensures that only authorized users (confidentiality) have access to accurate and complete information (integrity) when required (availability).&quot; (ISACA, 2008)
# &quot;Information Security is the process of protecting the intellectual property of an organisation.&quot; (Pipkin, 2000)
# &quot;...information security is a risk management discipline, whose job is to manage the cost of information risk to the business.&quot; (McDermott and Geer, 2001)
# &quot;A well-informed sense of assurance that information risks and controls are in balance.&quot; (Anderson, J., 2003)
# &quot;Information security is the protection of information and minimizes the risk of exposing information to unauthorized parties.&quot; (Venter and Eloff, 2003)
# &quot;Information Security is a multidisciplinary area of study and professional activity which is concerned with the development and implementation of security mechanisms of all available types (technical, organizational, human-oriented and legal) in order to keep information in all its locations (within and outside the organization&#x27;s perimeter) and, consequently, information systems, where information is created, processed, stored, transmitted and destroyed, free from threats.
#Information and information resource security using telecommunication system or devices means protecting information, information systems or books from unauthorized access, damage, theft, or destruction (Kurose and Ross, 2010).
== Threats ==
Information security threats come in many different forms. Some of the most common threats today are software attacks, theft of intellectual property, theft of identity, theft of equipment or information, sabotage, and information extortion. Viruses, worms, phishing attacks, and Trojan horses are a few common examples of software attacks. The theft of intellectual property has also been an extensive issue for many businesses. Identity theft is the attempt to act as someone else usually to obtain that person&#x27;s personal information or to take advantage of their access to vital information through social engineering. Sabotage usually consists of the destruction of an organization&#x27;s website in an attempt to cause loss of confidence on the part of its customers. Information extortion consists of theft of a company&#x27;s property or information as an attempt to receive a payment in exchange for returning the information or property back to its owner, as with ransomware. One of the most functional precautions against these attacks is to conduct periodical user awareness.

Governments, military, corporations, financial institutions, hospitals, non-profit organisations, and private businesses amass a great deal of confidential information about their employees, customers, products, research, and financial status. Should confidential information about a business&#x27;s customers or finances or new product line fall into the hands of a competitor or hacker, a business and its customers could suffer widespread, irreparable financial loss, as well as damage to the company&#x27;s reputation. From a business perspective, information security must be balanced against cost; the Gordon-Loeb Model provides a mathematical economic approach for addressing this concern.

For the individual, information security has a significant effect on privacy, which is viewed very differently in various cultures.

== History ==
Since the early days of communication, diplomats and military commanders understood that it was necessary to provide some mechanism to protect the confidentiality of correspondence and to have some means of detecting tampering. Julius Caesar is credited with the invention of the Caesar cipher c. 50 B.C., which was created in order to prevent his secret messages from being read should a message fall into the wrong hands. However, for the most part protection was achieved through the application of procedural handling controls. Sensitive information was marked up to indicate that it should be protected and transported by trusted persons, guarded and stored in a secure environment or strong box. As postal services expanded, governments created official organizations to intercept, decipher, read, and reseal letters (e.g., the U.K.&#x27;s Secret Office, founded in 1653).

In the mid-nineteenth century more complex classification systems were developed to allow governments to manage their information according to the degree of sensitivity. For example, the British Government codified this, to some extent, with the publication of the Official Secrets Act in 1889. Section 1 of the law concerned espionage and unlawful disclosures of information, while Section 2 dealt with breaches of official trust. A public interest defense was soon added to defend disclosures in the interest of the state. A similar law was passed in India in 1889, The Indian Official Secrets Act, which was associated with the British colonial era and used to crack down on newspapers that opposed the Raj&#x27;s policies. A newer version was passed in 1923 that extended to all matters of confidential or secret information for governance. By the time of the First World War, multi-tier classification systems were used to communicate information to and from various fronts, which encouraged greater use of code making and breaking sections in diplomatic and military headquarters. Encoding became more sophisticated between the wars as machines were employed to scramble and unscramble information.

The establishment of computer security inaugurated the history of information security. The need for such appeared during World War II. The volume of information shared by the Allied countries during the Second World War necessitated formal alignment of classification systems and procedural controls. An arcane range of markings evolved to indicate who could handle documents (usually officers rather than enlisted troops) and where they should be stored as increasingly complex safes and storage facilities were developed. The Enigma Machine, which was employed by the Germans to encrypt the data of warfare and was successfully decrypted by Alan Turing, can be regarded as a striking example of creating and using secured information. Procedures evolved to ensure documents were destroyed properly, and it was the failure to follow these procedures which led to some of the greatest intelligence coups of the war (e.g., the capture of U-570).

Various mainframe computers were connected online during the Cold War to complete more sophisticated tasks, in a communication process easier than mailing magnetic tapes back and forth by computer centers. As such, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), of the United States Department of Defense, started researching the feasibility of a networked system of communication to trade information within the United States Armed Forces. In 1968, the ARPANET project was formulated by Larry Roberts, which would later evolve into what is known as the internet.

In 1973, important elements of ARPANET security were found by internet pioneer Robert Metcalfe to have many flaws such as the: &quot;vulnerability of password structure and formats; lack of safety procedures for dial-up connections; and nonexistent user identification and authorizations&quot;, aside from the lack of controls and safeguards to keep data safe from unauthorized access. Hackers had effortless access to ARPANET, as phone numbers were known by the public. Due to these problems, coupled with the constant violation of computer security, as well as the exponential increase in the number of hosts and users of the system, &quot;network security&quot; was often alluded to as &quot;network insecurity&quot;.

The end of the twentieth century and the early years of the twenty-first century saw rapid advancements in telecommunications, computing hardware and software, and data encryption. The availability of smaller, more powerful, and less expensive computing equipment made electronic data processing within the reach of small business and home users. The establishment of Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP) in the early 1980s enabled different types of computers to communicate. These computers quickly became interconnected through the internet.

The rapid growth and widespread use of electronic data processing and electronic business conducted through the internet, along with numerous occurrences of international terrorism, fueled the need for better methods of protecting the computers and the information they store, process, and transmit. The academic disciplines of computer security and information assurance emerged along with numerous professional organizations, all sharing the common goals of ensuring the security and reliability of information systems.

== Security Goals ==

=== CIA triad ===
The &quot;CIA triad&quot; of &quot;confidentiality, integrity, and availability&quot; is at the heart of information security. The concept was introduced in the Anderson Report in 1972 and later repeated in &quot;The Protection of Information in Computer Systems.&quot; The abbreviation was coined by Steve Lipner around 1986. 

Debate continues about whether or not this triad is sufficient to address rapidly changing technology and business requirements, with recommendations to consider expanding on the intersections between availability and confidentiality, as well as the relationship between security and privacy. Other principles such as &quot;accountability&quot; have sometimes been proposed; it has been pointed out that issues such as non-repudiation do not fit well within the three core concepts.

==== Confidentiality ====
In information security, confidentiality &quot;is the property, that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.&quot; While similar to &quot;privacy,&quot; the two words are not interchangeable. Rather, confidentiality is a component of privacy that implements to protect our data from unauthorized viewers. Examples of confidentiality of electronic data being compromised include laptop theft, password theft, or sensitive emails being sent to the incorrect individuals.

==== Integrity ====
In IT security, data integrity means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle. This means that data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner. This is not the same thing as referential integrity in databases, although it can be viewed as a special case of consistency as understood in the classic ACID model of transaction processing. Information security systems typically incorporate controls to ensure their own integrity, in particular protecting the kernel or core functions against both deliberate and accidental threats. Multi-purpose and multi-user computer systems aim to compartmentalize the data and processing such that no user or process can adversely impact another: the controls may not succeed however, as we see in incidents such as malware infections, hacks, data theft, fraud, and privacy breaches.

More broadly, integrity is an information security principle that involves human/social, process, and commercial integrity, as well as data integrity. As such it touches on aspects such as credibility, consistency, truthfulness, completeness, accuracy, timeliness, and assurance.

==== Availability ====
For any information system to serve its purpose, the information must be available when it is needed. This means the computing systems used to store and process the information, the security controls used to protect it, and the communication channels used to access it must be functioning correctly. High availability systems aim to remain available at all times, preventing service disruptions due to power outages, hardware failures, and system upgrades. Ensuring availability also involves preventing denial-of-service attacks, such as a flood of incoming messages to the target system, essentially forcing it to shut down.

In the realm of information security, availability can often be viewed as one of the most important parts of a successful information security program. Ultimately end-users need to be able to perform job functions; by ensuring availability an organization is able to perform to the standards that an organization&#x27;s stakeholders expect. This can involve topics such as proxy configurations, outside web access, the ability to access shared drives and the ability to send emails. Executives oftentimes do not understand the technical side of information security and look at availability as an easy fix, but this often requires collaboration from many different organizational teams, such as network operations, development operations, incident response, and policy/change management. A successful information security team involves many different key roles to mesh and align for the &quot;CIA&quot; triad to be provided effectively.

=== Additional security goals ===
In addition to the classic CIA triad of security goals, some organisations may want to include security goals like authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation, and reliability. 

==== Non-repudiation ====
In law, non-repudiation implies one&#x27;s intention to fulfill their obligations to a contract. It also implies that one party of a transaction cannot deny having received a transaction, nor can the other party deny having sent a transaction.

It is important to note that while technology such as cryptographic systems can assist in non-repudiation efforts, the concept is at its core a legal concept transcending the realm of technology. It is not, for instance, sufficient to show that the message matches a digital signature signed with the sender&#x27;s private key, and thus only the sender could have sent the message, and nobody else could have altered it in transit (data integrity). The alleged sender could in return demonstrate that the digital signature algorithm is vulnerable or flawed, or allege or prove that his signing key has been compromised. The fault for these violations may or may not lie with the sender, and such assertions may or may not relieve the sender of liability, but the assertion would invalidate the claim that the signature necessarily proves authenticity and integrity. As such, the sender may repudiate the message (because authenticity and integrity are pre-requisites for non-repudiation).

=== Other Models ===
In 1992 and revised in 2002, the OECD&#x27;s &quot;Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems and Networks&quot; proposed the nine generally accepted principles: awareness, responsibility, response, ethics, democracy, risk assessment, security design and implementation, security management, and reassessment. Building upon those, in 2004 the NIST&#x27;s &quot;Engineering Principles for Information Technology Security&quot; proposed 33 principles. 

In 1998, Donn Parker proposed an alternative model for the classic &quot;CIA&quot; triad that he called the six atomic elements of information. The elements are confidentiality, possession, integrity, authenticity, availability, and utility. The merits of the Parkerian Hexad are a subject of debate amongst security professionals.

In 2011, The Open Group published the information security management standard O-ISM3. This standard proposed an operational definition of the key concepts of security, with elements called &quot;security objectives&quot;, related to access control (9), availability (3), data quality (1), compliance, and technical (4).

== Risk management ==
Risk is the likelihood that something bad will happen that causes harm to an informational asset (or the loss of the asset). A vulnerability is a weakness that could be used to endanger or cause harm to an informational asset. A threat is anything (man-made or act of nature) that has the potential to cause harm. The likelihood that a threat will use a vulnerability to cause harm creates a risk. When a threat does use a vulnerability to inflict harm, it has an impact. In the context of information security, the impact is a loss of availability, integrity, and confidentiality, and possibly other losses (lost income, loss of life, loss of real property).

The &quot;Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) Review Manual 2006&quot; defines risk management as &quot;the process of identifying vulnerabilities and threats to the information resources used by an organization in achieving business objectives, and deciding what countermeasures, if any, to take in reducing risk to an acceptable level, based on the value of the information resource to the organization.&quot;

There are two things in this definition that may need some clarification. First, the &quot;process&quot; of risk management is an ongoing, iterative process. It must be repeated indefinitely. The business environment is constantly changing and new threats and vulnerabilities emerge every day. Second, the choice of countermeasures (controls) used to manage risks must strike a balance between productivity, cost, effectiveness of the countermeasure, and the value of the informational asset being protected. Furthermore, these processes have limitations as security breaches are generally rare and emerge in a specific context which may not be easily duplicated. Thus, any process and countermeasure should itself be evaluated for vulnerabilities. It is not possible to identify all risks, nor is it possible to eliminate all risk. The remaining risk is called &quot;residual risk&quot;.

A risk assessment is carried out by a team of people who have knowledge of specific areas of the business. Membership of the team may vary over time as different parts of the business are assessed. The assessment may use a subjective qualitative analysis based on informed opinion, or where reliable dollar figures and historical information is available, the analysis may use quantitative analysis.

Research has shown that the most vulnerable point in most information systems is the human user, operator, designer, or other human. The ISO/IEC 27002:2005 Code of practice for information security management recommends the following be examined during a risk assessment:
* security policy,
* organization of information security,
* asset management,
* human resources security,
* physical and environmental security,
* communications and operations management,
* access control,
* information systems acquisition, development, and maintenance,
* information security incident management,
* business continuity management
* regulatory compliance.

In broad terms, the risk management process consists of:
# Identification of assets and estimating their value. Include: people, buildings, hardware, software, data (electronic, print, other), supplies.
# Conduct a threat assessment. Include: Acts of nature, acts of war, accidents, malicious acts originating from inside or outside the organization.
# Conduct a vulnerability assessment, and for each vulnerability, calculate the probability that it will be exploited. Evaluate policies, procedures, standards, training, physical security, quality control, technical security.
# Calculate the impact that each threat would have on each asset. Use qualitative analysis or quantitative analysis.
# Identify, select and implement appropriate controls. Provide a proportional response. Consider productivity, cost effectiveness, and value of the asset.
# Evaluate the effectiveness of the control measures. Ensure the controls provide the required cost effective protection without discernible loss of productivity.

For any given risk, management can choose to accept the risk based upon the relative low value of the asset, the relative low frequency of occurrence, and the relative low impact on the business. Or, leadership may choose to mitigate the risk by selecting and implementing appropriate control measures to reduce the risk. In some cases, the risk can be transferred to another business by buying insurance or outsourcing to another business. The reality of some risks may be disputed. In such cases leadership may choose to deny the risk.

=== Security controls ===

Selecting and implementing proper security controls will initially help an organization bring down risk to acceptable levels. Control selection should follow and should be based on the risk assessment. Controls can vary in nature, but fundamentally they are ways of protecting the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information. ISO/IEC 27001 has defined controls in different areas. Organizations can implement additional controls according to requirement of the organization. ISO/IEC 27002 offers a guideline for organizational information security standards.

== Defense in depth ==
Defense in depth is a fundamental security philosophy that relies on overlapping security systems designed to maintain protection even if individual components fail. Rather than depending on a single security measure, it combines multiple layers of security controls both in the cloud and at network endpoints. This approach includes combinations like firewalls with intrusion-detection systems, email filtering services with desktop anti-virus, and cloud-based security alongside traditional network defenses.
The concept can be implemented through three distinct layers of administrative, logical, and physical controls, or visualized as an onion model with data at the core, surrounded by people, network security, host-based security, and application security layers. The strategy emphasizes that security involves not just technology, but also people and processes working together, with real-time monitoring and response being crucial components.

== Classification ==
An important aspect of information security and risk management is recognizing the value of information and defining appropriate procedures and protection requirements for the information. Not all information is equal and so not all information requires the same degree of protection. This requires information to be assigned a security classification. The first step in information classification is to identify a member of senior management as the owner of the particular information to be classified. Next, develop a classification policy. The policy should describe the different classification labels, define the criteria for information to be assigned a particular label, and list the required security controls for each classification.

Some factors that influence which classification information should be assigned include how much value that information has to the organization, how old the information is and whether or not the information has become obsolete. Laws and other regulatory requirements are also important considerations when classifying information. The Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) and its &quot;Business Model for Information Security&quot; also serves as a tool for security professionals to examine security from a systems perspective, creating an environment where security can be managed holistically, allowing actual risks to be addressed.

The type of information security classification labels selected and used will depend on the nature of the organization, with examples being:
* In the business sector, labels such as: Public, Sensitive, Private, Confidential.
* In the government sector, labels such as: Unclassified, Unofficial, Protected, Confidential, Secret, Top Secret, and their non-English equivalents.
* In cross-sectoral formations, the Traffic Light Protocol, which consists of: White, Green, Amber, and Red.
* In the personal sector, one label such as Financial. This includes activities related to managing money, such as online banking.

All employees in the organization, as well as business partners, must be trained on the classification schema and understand the required security controls and handling procedures for each classification. The classification of a particular information asset that has been assigned should be reviewed periodically to ensure the classification is still appropriate for the information and to ensure the security controls required by the classification are in place and are followed in their right procedures.

== Access control ==
Access to protected information must be restricted to people who are authorized to access the information. The computer programs, and in many cases the computers that process the information, must also be authorized. This requires that mechanisms be in place to control the access to protected information. The sophistication of the access control mechanisms should be in parity with the value of the information being protected; the more sensitive or valuable the information the stronger the control mechanisms need to be. The foundation on which access control mechanisms are built start with identification and authentication.

Access control is generally considered in three steps: identification, authentication, and authorization.

=== Identification ===
Identification is an assertion of who someone is or what something is. If a person makes the statement &quot;Hello, my name is John Doe&quot; they are making a claim of who they are. However, their claim may or may not be true. Before John Doe can be granted access to protected information it will be necessary to verify that the person claiming to be John Doe really is John Doe. Typically the claim is in the form of a username. By entering that username you are claiming &quot;I am the person the username belongs to&quot;.

=== Authentication ===
Authentication is the act of verifying a claim of identity. When John Doe goes into a bank to make a withdrawal, he tells the bank teller he is John Doe, a claim of identity. The bank teller asks to see a photo ID, so he hands the teller his driver&#x27;s license. The bank teller checks the license to make sure it has John Doe printed on it and compares the photograph on the license against the person claiming to be John Doe. If the photo and name match the person, then the teller has authenticated that John Doe is who he claimed to be. Similarly, by entering the correct password, the user is providing evidence that he/she is the person the username belongs to.

There are three different types of information that can be used for authentication:
* Something you know: things such as a PIN, a password, or your mother&#x27;s maiden name
* Something you have: a driver&#x27;s license or a magnetic swipe card
* Something you are: biometrics, including palm prints, fingerprints, voice prints, and retina (eye) scans

Strong authentication requires providing more than one type of authentication information (two-factor authentication). The username is the most common form of identification on computer systems today and the password is the most common form of authentication. Usernames and passwords have served their purpose, but they are increasingly inadequate. Usernames and passwords are slowly being replaced or supplemented with more sophisticated authentication mechanisms such as time-based one-time password algorithms.

=== Authorization ===
After a person, program or computer has successfully been identified and authenticated then it must be determined what informational resources they are permitted to access and what actions they will be allowed to perform (run, view, create, delete, or change). This is called authorization. Authorization to access information and other computing services begins with administrative policies and procedures. The policies prescribe what information and computing services can be accessed, by whom, and under what conditions. The access control mechanisms are then configured to enforce these policies. Different computing systems are equipped with different kinds of access control mechanisms. Some may even offer a choice of different access control mechanisms. The access control mechanism a system offers will be based upon one of three approaches to access control, or it may be derived from a combination of the three approaches.

The non-discretionary approach consolidates all access control under a centralized administration. The access to information and other resources is usually based on the individuals function (role) in the organization or the tasks the individual must perform. The discretionary approach gives the creator or owner of the information resource the ability to control access to those resources. In the mandatory access control approach, access is granted or denied basing upon the security classification assigned to the information resource.

Examples of common access control mechanisms in use today include role-based access control, available in many advanced database management systems; simple file permissions provided in the UNIX and Windows operating systems; Group Policy Objects provided in Windows network systems; and Kerberos, RADIUS, TACACS, and the simple access lists used in many firewalls and routers.

To be effective, policies and other security controls must be enforceable and upheld. Effective policies ensure that people are held accountable for their actions. The U.S. Treasury&#x27;s guidelines for systems processing sensitive or proprietary information, for example, states that all failed and successful authentication and access attempts must be logged, and all access to information must leave some type of audit trail.

Also, the need-to-know principle needs to be in effect when talking about access control. This principle gives access rights to a person to perform their job functions. This principle is used in the government when dealing with difference clearances. Even though two employees in different departments have a top-secret clearance, they must have a need-to-know in order for information to be exchanged. Within the need-to-know principle, network administrators grant the employee the least amount of privilege to prevent employees from accessing more than what they are supposed to. Need-to-know helps to enforce the confidentiality-integrity-availability triad. Need-to-know directly impacts the confidential area of the triad.

== Cryptography ==

Information security uses cryptography to transform usable information into a form that renders it unusable by anyone other than an authorized user; this process is called encryption. Information that has been encrypted (rendered unusable) can be transformed back into its original usable form by an authorized user who possesses the cryptographic key, through the process of decryption. Cryptography is used in information security to protect information from unauthorized or accidental disclosure while the information is in transit (either electronically or physically) and while information is in storage.

Cryptography provides information security with other useful applications as well, including improved authentication methods, message digests, digital signatures, non-repudiation, and encrypted network communications. Older, less secure applications such as Telnet and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) are slowly being replaced with more secure applications such as Secure Shell (SSH) that use encrypted network communications. Wireless communications can be encrypted using protocols such as WPA/WPA2 or the older (and less secure) WEP. Wired communications (such as ITU‑T G.hn) are secured using AES for encryption and X.1035 for authentication and key exchange. Software applications such as GnuPG or PGP can be used to encrypt data files and email.

Cryptography can introduce security problems when it is not implemented correctly. Cryptographic solutions need to be implemented using industry-accepted solutions that have undergone rigorous peer review by independent experts in cryptography. The length and strength of the encryption key is also an important consideration. A key that is weak or too short will produce weak encryption. The keys used for encryption and decryption must be protected with the same degree of rigor as any other confidential information. They must be protected from unauthorized disclosure and destruction, and they must be available when needed. Public key infrastructure (PKI) solutions address many of the problems that surround key management.

== Process ==
U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines now make it possible to hold corporate officers liable for failing to exercise due care and due diligence in the management of their information systems.

In the field of information security, Harris
offers the following definitions of due care and due diligence:

&quot;Due care are steps that are taken to show that a company has taken responsibility for the activities that take place within the corporation and has taken the necessary steps to help protect the company, its resources, and employees&quot;&quot;.&quot; And, [Due diligence are the] &quot;continual activities that make sure the protection mechanisms are continually maintained and operational.&quot;
Attention should be made to two important points in these definitions. First, in due care, steps are taken to show; this means that the steps can be verified, measured, or even produce tangible artifacts. Second, in due diligence, there are continual activities; this means that people are actually doing things to monitor and maintain the protection mechanisms, and these activities are ongoing.

Organizations have a responsibility with practicing duty of care when applying information security. The Duty of Care Risk Analysis Standard (DoCRA) provides principles and practices for evaluating risk. It considers all parties that could be affected by those risks. DoCRA helps evaluate safeguards if they are appropriate in protecting others from harm while presenting a reasonable burden. With increased data breach litigation, companies must balance security controls, compliance, and its mission.

=== Incident response plans ===
Computer security incident management is a specialized form of incident management focused on monitoring, detecting, and responding to security events on computers and networks in a predictable way. 

Organizations implement this through incident response plans (IRPs) that are activated when security breaches are detected. These plans typically involve an incident response team (IRT) with specialized skills in areas like penetration testing, computer forensics, and network security.

=== Change management ===

Change management is a formal process for directing and controlling alterations to the information processing environment. This includes alterations to desktop computers, the network, servers, and software. The objectives of change management are to reduce the risks posed by changes to the information processing environment and improve the stability and reliability of the processing environment as changes are made. It is not the objective of change management to prevent or hinder necessary changes from being implemented.

Any change to the information processing environment introduces an element of risk. Even apparently simple changes can have unexpected effects. One of management&#x27;s many responsibilities is the management of risk. Change management is a tool for managing the risks introduced by changes to the information processing environment. Part of the change management process ensures that changes are not implemented at inopportune times when they may disrupt critical business processes or interfere with other changes being implemented.

Not every change needs to be managed. Some kinds of changes are a part of the everyday routine of information processing and adhere to a predefined procedure, which reduces the overall level of risk to the processing environment. Creating a new user account or deploying a new desktop computer are examples of changes that do not generally require change management. However, relocating user file shares, or upgrading the Email server pose a much higher level of risk to the processing environment and are not a normal everyday activity. The critical first steps in change management are (a) defining change (and communicating that definition) and (b) defining the scope of the change system.

Change management is usually overseen by a change review board composed of representatives from key business areas, security, networking, systems administrators, database administration, application developers, desktop support, and the help desk. The tasks of the change review board can be facilitated with the use of automated work flow application. The responsibility of the change review board is to ensure the organization&#x27;s documented change management procedures are followed. The change management process is as follows

* Request: Anyone can request a change. The person making the change request may or may not be the same person that performs the analysis or implements the change. When a request for change is received, it may undergo a preliminary review to determine if the requested change is compatible with the organizations business model and practices, and to determine the amount of resources needed to implement the change.
* Approve: Management runs the business and controls the allocation of resources therefore, management must approve requests for changes and assign a priority for every change. Management might choose to reject a change request if the change is not compatible with the business model, industry standards or best practices. Management might also choose to reject a change request if the change requires more resources than can be allocated for the change.
* Plan: Planning a change involves discovering the scope and impact of the proposed change; analyzing the complexity of the change; allocation of resources and, developing, testing, and documenting both implementation and back-out plans. Need to define the criteria on which a decision to back out will be made.
* Test: Every change must be tested in a safe test environment, which closely reflects the actual production environment, before the change is applied to the production environment. The backout plan must also be tested.
* Schedule: Part of the change review board&#x27;s responsibility is to assist in the scheduling of changes by reviewing the proposed implementation date for potential conflicts with other scheduled changes or critical business activities.
* Communicate: Once a change has been scheduled it must be communicated. The communication is to give others the opportunity to remind the change review board about other changes or critical business activities that might have been overlooked when scheduling the change. The communication also serves to make the help desk and users aware that a change is about to occur. Another responsibility of the change review board is to ensure that scheduled changes have been properly communicated to those who will be affected by the change or otherwise have an interest in the change.
* Implement: At the appointed date and time, the changes must be implemented. Part of the planning process was to develop an implementation plan, testing plan and, a back out plan. If the implementation of the change should fail or, the post implementation testing fails or, other &quot;drop dead&quot; criteria have been met, the back out plan should be implemented.
* Document: All changes must be documented. The documentation includes the initial request for change, its approval, the priority assigned to it, the implementation, testing and back out plans, the results of the change review board critique, the date/time the change was implemented, who implemented it, and whether the change was implemented successfully, failed or postponed.
* Post-change review: The change review board should hold a post-implementation review of changes. It is particularly important to review failed and backed out changes. The review board should try to understand the problems that were encountered, and look for areas for improvement.

Change management procedures that are simple to follow and easy to use can greatly reduce the overall risks created when changes are made to the information processing environment. Good change management procedures improve the overall quality and success of changes as they are implemented. This is accomplished through planning, peer review, documentation, and communication.

ISO/IEC 20000, The Visible OPS Handbook: Implementing ITIL in 4 Practical and Auditable Steps (Full book summary), and ITIL all provide valuable guidance on implementing an efficient and effective change management program information security.

== Business continuity ==

Business continuity management (BCM) concerns arrangements aiming to protect an organization&#x27;s critical business functions from interruption due to incidents, or at least minimize the effects. BCM is essential to any organization to keep technology and business in line with current threats to the continuation of business as usual. The BCM should be included in an organizations risk analysis plan to ensure that all of the necessary business functions have what they need to keep going in the event of any type of threat to any business function.

It encompasses:
* Analysis of requirements, e.g., identifying critical business functions, dependencies and potential failure points, potential threats and hence incidents or risks of concern to the organization;
* Specification, e.g., maximum tolerable outage periods; recovery point objectives (maximum acceptable periods of data loss);
* Architecture and design, e.g., an appropriate combination of approaches including resilience (e.g. engineering IT systems and processes for high availability, avoiding or preventing situations that might interrupt the business), incident and emergency management (e.g., evacuating premises, calling the emergency services, triage/situation assessment and invoking recovery plans), recovery (e.g., rebuilding) and contingency management (generic capabilities to deal positively with whatever occurs using whatever resources are available);
* Implementation, e.g., configuring and scheduling backups, data transfers, etc., duplicating and strengthening critical elements; contracting with service and equipment suppliers;
* Testing, e.g., business continuity exercises of various types, costs and assurance levels;
* Management, e.g., defining strategies, setting objectives and goals; planning and directing the work; allocating funds, people and other resources; prioritization relative to other activities; team building, leadership, control, motivation and coordination with other business functions and activities (e.g., IT, facilities, human resources, risk management, information risk and security, operations); monitoring the situation, checking and updating the arrangements when things change; maturing the approach through continuous improvement, learning and appropriate investment;
* Assurance, e.g., testing against specified requirements; measuring, analyzing, and reporting key parameters; conducting additional tests, reviews and audits for greater confidence that the arrangements will go to plan if invoked.

Whereas BCM takes a broad approach to minimizing disaster-related risks by reducing both the probability and the severity of incidents, a disaster recovery plan (DRP) focuses specifically on resuming business operations as quickly as possible after a disaster. A disaster recovery plan, invoked soon after a disaster occurs, lays out the steps necessary to recover critical information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure. Disaster recovery planning includes establishing a planning group, performing risk assessment, establishing priorities, developing recovery strategies, preparing inventories and documentation of the plan, developing verification criteria and procedure, and lastly implementing the plan.

== Laws and regulations ==
Below is a partial listing of governmental laws and regulations in various parts of the world that have, had, or will have, a significant effect on data processing and information security. Important industry sector regulations have also been included when they have a significant impact on information security.

* The UK Data Protection Act 1998 makes new provisions for the regulation of the processing of information relating to individuals, including the obtaining, holding, use or disclosure of such information. The European Union Data Protection Directive (EUDPD) requires that all E.U. members adopt national regulations to standardize the protection of data privacy for citizens throughout the E.U.
* The Computer Misuse Act 1990 is an Act of the U.K. Parliament making computer crime (e.g., hacking) a criminal offense. The act has become a model upon which several other countries, including Canada and Ireland, have drawn inspiration from when subsequently drafting their own information security laws.
* The E.U.&#x27;s Data Retention Directive (annulled) required internet service providers and phone companies to keep data on every electronic message sent and phone call made for between six months and two years.
* The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) ( g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a U.S. Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education. Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student&#x27;s education record.
* The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council&#x27;s (FFIEC) security guidelines for auditors specifies requirements for online banking security.
* The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 requires the adoption of national standards for electronic health care transactions and national identifiers for providers, health insurance plans, and employers. Additionally, it requires health care providers, insurance providers and employers to safeguard the security and privacy of health data.
* The Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA), also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, protects the privacy and security of private financial information that financial institutions collect, hold, and process.
* Section 404 of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) requires publicly traded companies to assess the effectiveness of their internal controls for financial reporting in annual reports they submit at the end of each fiscal year. Chief information officers are responsible for the security, accuracy, and the reliability of the systems that manage and report the financial data. The act also requires publicly traded companies to engage with independent auditors who must attest to, and report on, the validity of their assessments.
* The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) establishes comprehensive requirements for enhancing payment account data security. It was developed by the founding payment brands of the PCI Security Standards Council — including American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB, MasterCard Worldwide, and Visa International — to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures on a global basis. The PCI DSS is a multifaceted security standard that includes requirements for security management, policies, procedures, network architecture, software design, and other critical protective measures.
* State security breach notification laws (California and many others) require businesses, nonprofits, and state institutions to notify consumers when unencrypted &quot;personal information&quot; may have been compromised, lost, or stolen.
* The Personal Information Protection and Electronics Document Act (PIPEDA) of Canada supports and promotes electronic commerce by protecting personal information that is collected, used or disclosed in certain circumstances, by providing for the use of electronic means to communicate or record information or transactions and by amending the Canada Evidence Act, the Statutory Instruments Act and the Statute Revision Act.
* Greece&#x27;s Hellenic Authority for Communication Security and Privacy (ADAE) (Law 165/2011) establishes and describes the minimum information security controls that should be deployed by every company which provides electronic communication networks and/or services in Greece in order to protect customers&#x27; confidentiality. These include both managerial and technical controls (e.g., log records should be stored for two years).
* Greece&#x27;s Hellenic Authority for Communication Security and Privacy (ADAE) (Law 205/2013) concentrates around the protection of the integrity and availability of the services and data offered by Greek telecommunication companies. The law forces these and other related companies to build, deploy, and test appropriate business continuity plans and redundant infrastructures.&lt;ref name=&quot;205/2013&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The US Department of Defense (DoD) issued DoD Directive 8570 in 2004, supplemented by DoD Directive 8140, requiring all DoD employees and all DoD contract personnel involved in information assurance roles and activities to earn and maintain various industry Information Technology (IT) certifications in an effort to ensure that all DoD personnel involved in network infrastructure defense have minimum levels of IT industry recognized knowledge, skills and abilities (KSA). Andersson and Reimers (2019) report these certifications range from CompTIA&#x27;s A+ and Security+ through the ICS2.org&#x27;s CISSP, etc.

== Culture ==
Describing more than simply how security aware employees are, information security culture is the ideas, customs, and social behaviors of an organization that impact information security in both positive and negative ways. Cultural concepts can help different segments of the organization work effectively or work against effectiveness towards information security within an organization. The way employees think and feel about security and the actions they take can have a big impact on information security in organizations. Roer &amp; Petric (2017) identify seven core dimensions of information security culture in organizations:

* Attitudes: employees&#x27; feelings and emotions about the various activities that pertain to the organizational security of information.
* Behaviors: actual or intended activities and risk-taking actions of employees that have direct or indirect impact on information security.
* Cognition: employees&#x27; awareness, verifiable knowledge, and beliefs regarding practices, activities, and self-efficacy relation that are related to information security.
* Communication: ways employees communicate with each other, sense of belonging, support for security issues, and incident reporting.
* Compliance: adherence to organizational security policies, awareness of the existence of such policies and the ability to recall the substance of such policies.
* Norms: perceptions of security-related organizational conduct and practices that are informally deemed either normal or deviant by employees and their peers, e.g. hidden expectations regarding security behaviors and unwritten rules regarding uses of information-communication technologies.
* Responsibilities: employees&#x27; understanding of the roles and responsibilities they have as a critical factor in sustaining or endangering the security of information, and thereby the organization.

Andersson and Reimers (2014) found that employees often do not see themselves as part of the organization Information Security &quot;effort&quot; and often take actions that ignore organizational information security best interests. Research shows information security culture needs to be improved continuously. In &quot;Information Security Culture from Analysis to Change&quot;, authors commented, &quot;It&#x27;s a never ending process, a cycle of evaluation and change or maintenance.&quot; To manage the information security culture, five steps should be taken: pre-evaluation, strategic planning, operative planning, implementation, and post-evaluation.

* Pre-evaluation: to identify the awareness of information security within employees and to analyze current security policy
* Strategic planning: to come up a better awareness-program, we need to set clear targets. Clustering people is helpful to achieve it
* Operative planning: create a good security culture based on internal communication, management buy-in, security awareness, and training programs
* Implementation: should feature commitment of management, communication with organizational members, courses for all organizational members, and commitment of the employees
* Post-evaluation: to better gauge the effectiveness of the prior steps and build on continuous improvement

<text>Income is the consumption and saving opportunity gained by an entity within a specified timeframe, which is generally expressed in monetary terms. Income is difficult to define conceptually and the definition may be different across fields. For example, a person&#x27;s income in an economic sense may be different from their income as defined by law.

An extremely important definition of income is Haig–Simons income, which defines income as &quot;Consumption + Change in net worth&quot; and is widely used in economics.

For households and individuals in the United States, income is defined by tax law as a sum that includes any wage, salary, profit, interest payment, rent, or other form of earnings received in a calendar year. Discretionary income is often defined as gross income minus taxes and other deductions (e.g., mandatory pension contributions), and is widely used as a basis to compare the welfare of taxpayers.

In the field of public economics, the concept may comprise the accumulation of both monetary and non-monetary consumption ability, with the former (monetary) being used as a proxy for total income.

For a firm, gross income can be defined as sum of all revenue minus the cost of goods sold. Net income nets out expenses: net income equals revenue minus cost of goods sold, expenses, depreciation, interest, and taxes.

==Economic definitions==
===Full and Haig–Simons income===

&quot;Full income&quot; refers to the accumulation of both the monetary and the non-monetary consumption-ability of any given entity, such as a person or a household. According to what the economist Nicholas Barr describes as the &quot;classical definition of income&quot; (the 1938 Haig–Simons definition): &quot;income may be defined as the... sum of (1) the market value of rights exercised in consumption and (2) the change in the value of the store of property rights...&quot; Since the consumption potential of non-monetary goods, such as leisure, cannot be measured, monetary income may be thought of as a proxy for full income. As such, however, it is criticized for being unreliable, &quot;i.e.&quot; failing to accurately reflect affluence (and thus the consumption opportunities) of any given agent. 

It omits the utility a person may derive from non-monetary income and, on a macroeconomic level, fails to accurately chart social welfare. According to Barr, &quot;in practice money income as a proportion of total income varies widely and unsystematically. Non-observability of full income prevents a complete characterization of the individual opportunity set, forcing us to use the unreliable yardstick of money income.

===Factor income===
In economics, &quot;factor income&quot; is the return accruing for a person, or a nation, derived from the &quot;factors of production&quot;: rental income, wages generated by labor, the interest created by capital, and profits from entrepreneurial ventures.

In consumer theory &#x27;income&#x27; is another name for the &quot;budget constraint&quot;, an amount formula_1 to be spent on different goods x and y in quantities formula_2 and formula_3 at prices formula_4 and formula_5. The basic equation for this is
:formula_6
This equation implies two things. First buying one more unit of good x implies buying formula_7 less units of good y. So, formula_7 is the &quot;relative&quot; price of a unit of x as to the number of units given up in y. Second, if the price of x falls for a fixed formula_1 and fixed formula_10 then its relative price falls. The usual hypothesis, the law of demand, is that the quantity demanded of x would increase at the lower price. The analysis can be generalized to more than two goods.

The theoretical generalization to more than one period is a multi-period wealth and income constraint. For example, the same person can gain more productive skills or acquire more productive income-earning assets to earn a higher income. In the multi-period case, something might also happen to the economy beyond the control of the individual to reduce (or increase) the flow of income. Changing measured income and its relation to consumption over time might be modeled accordingly, such as in the permanent income hypothesis.

==Legal definitions==

===Definitions under the Internal Revenue Code===


26 U.S. Code § 61 - Gross income defined. There are also some statutory exclusions from income.

===Definition under US Case law===

Income is an &quot;undeniable accessions to wealth, clearly realized, and over which the taxpayer has complete dominion.&quot; Commentators say that this is a pretty good definition of income.

Taxable income is usually lower than Haig-Simons income. This is because unrealized appreciation (e.g., the increase in the value of stock over the course of a year) is economic income but not taxable income, and because there are many statutory exclusions from taxable income, including workman&#x27;s compensation, SSI, gifts, child support, and in-kind government transfers.

==Accounting definitions==
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) uses the following definition: &quot;Income is increases in economic benefits during the accounting period in the form of inflows or enhancements of assets or decreases of liabilities that result in increases in equity, other than those relating to contributions from equity participants.&quot; [F.70] (IFRS Framework).

Previously the IFRS conceptual framework (4.29) stated: &quot;The definition of income encompasses both revenue and gains. Revenue arises in the course of the ordinary activities of an entity and is referred to by a variety of different names including sales, fees, interest, dividends, royalties and rent. 4.30: Gains represent other items that meet the definition of income and may, or may not, arise in the course of the ordinary activities of an entity. Gains represent increases in economic benefits and as such are no different in nature from revenue. Hence, they are not regarded as constituting a separate element in this Conceptual Framework.&quot;

The current IFRS conceptual framework (4.68) no longer draws a distinction between revenue and gains. Nevertheless, the distinction continues to be drawn at the standard and reporting levels. For example, IFRS 9.5.7.1 states: &quot;A gain or loss on a financial asset or financial liability that is measured at fair value shall be recognised in profit or loss ...&quot; while the IASB defined IFRS XBRL taxonomy includes OtherGainsLosses, GainsLossesOnNetMonetaryPosition and similar items.

US GAAP does not define income but does define comprehensive income (CON 8.4.E75): Comprehensive income is the change in equity of a business entity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from nonowner sources. It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.

According to John Hicks&#x27; definitions, income &quot;is the maximum amount which can be spent during a period if there is to be an expectation of maintaining intact, the capital value of prospective receipts (in money terms)&quot;.

==&quot;Nonincome&quot;==
=== Debt ===
Borrowing or repaying money is not income under any definition, for either the borrower or the lender. Interest and forgiveness of debt are income.

=== Psychic income ===
&quot;Non-monetary joy,&quot; such as watching a sunset or having sex, simply is not income. Similarly, nonmonetary suffering, such as heartbreak or labor, are not negative income. This may seem trivial, but the non-inclusion of psychic income has important effects on economics and tax policy. It encourages people to find happiness in nonmonetary, nontaxable ways and means that reported income may overstate or understate the well-being of a given individual.

== Income growth ==

Income per capita has been increasing steadily in most countries. Many factors contribute to people having a higher income, including education, globalisation and favorable political circumstances such as economic freedom and peace. Increases in income also tend to lead to people choosing to work fewer hours.
Developed countries (defined as countries with a &quot;developed economy&quot;) have higher incomes as opposed to developing countries tending to have lower incomes.

=== Factors contributing to higher income ===
Education has a positive effect on the level of income. Education increases the skills of the workforce, which in turn increases its productivity (and thus higher wages). Gary Becker developed a Human Capital Theory, which emphasizes that investment in education and training lead to efficiency gains, and by extension to economic growth.

Globalization can increase incomes by integrating markets, and allowing individuals greater possibilities of income increases through efficient allocation of resources and expanding existing wealth.

Generally, countries more open to trade have higher incomes. And while globalization tends to increase average income in a country, it does so unequally. Sachs and Warner claim, that “countries with open economies will converge to the same level of income, although admittedly it will take a long time.”

==Income inequality==
Income inequality is the extent to which income is distributed in an uneven manner. It can be measured by various methods, including the Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient. Many economists argue that certain amounts of inequality are necessary and desirable but that excessive inequality leads to efficiency problems and social injustice. Thereby necessitating initiatives like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 10 aimed at reducing inequality.

=== National Income ===
National income, measured by statistics such as net national income (NNI), measures the total income of individuals, corporations, and government in the economy. For more information see Measures of national income and output.

The total output of an economy equals its total income. From this viewpoint, GDP can be an indicator and measurement of national income since it measures a nation’s total production of goods and services produced within the borders of one country and its total income simultaneously. GDP is measured through factors of production (inputs) and the production function (the ability to turn inputs into outputs). One important note in this is income distribution working through the factor market and how national income is divided among these factors. For this examination, the Neoclassical theory of distribution and factor prices is the modern theory to look into.

== Basic income ==

Basic income models advocate for a regular, and usually unconditional, receipt of money from the public institution. There are many basic income models, with the most famous being Universal Basic Income.

=== Universal Basic Income ===

Universal Basic Income is a periodic receival of cash given to individuals on universal and unconditional basis. Unlike other programs like the Food Stamp Program, UBI provides eligible recipients with cash instead of coupons. Instead of households, it is paid to all individuals without requiring means test and regardless of employment status.

The proponents of UBI argue, that basic income is needed for social protection, mitigating automation and labour market disruptions. Opponents argue that UBI, in addition to being costly, will distort incentives for individuals to work. They might argue that there are other and more cost-effective policies that can tackle problems raised by the proponents of UBI. These policies include for example negative income tax.

==Income in philosophy and ethics==
Throughout history, many have written about the impact of income on morality and society. Saint Paul wrote &#x27;For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil:&#x27; ( (ASV)).

Some scholars have come to the conclusion that material progress and prosperity, as manifested in continuous income growth at both the individual and the national level, provide the indispensable foundation for sustaining any kind of morality. This argument was explicitly given by Adam Smith in his &quot;Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot;, and has more recently been developed by Harvard economist Benjamin Friedman in his book &quot;The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth&quot;.

==Income and health==

A landmark systematic review from Harvard University researchers in the Cochrane Collaboration found that income given in the form of unconditional cash transfers leads to reductions in disease, improvements in food security and dietary diversity, increases in children&#x27;s school attendance, decreases in extreme poverty, and higher health care spending.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1002/14651858.CD011135.pub2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1002/14651858.CD011135.pub3&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Health Foundation published an analysis where people on the lower income spectrum were more likely to describe their health negatively. Higher income was associated with self-reported better health. Another study found that “an increase in household income of £1,000 is associated with a 3.6 month increase in life expectancy for both men and women.”

A study by a Professor of Epidemiology Michael G Marmot found argues that there are two ways which could explain a positive correlation between income and health: the ability to afford goods and services necessary for biological survival, and the ability to influence life circumstances.

Russell Ecob and George Davey Smith found that there is a relationship between income and a number of health measures. Greater household equivalised income is associated with better health indicators such as height, waist–hip ratio, respiratory function, malaise, limiting long-term illness.

==History==
Income is conventionally denoted by &quot;Y&quot; in economics. John Hicks used &quot;I&quot; for income, but Keynes wrote to him in 1937, &quot;after trying both, I believe it is easier to use Y for income and I for investment.&quot; Some consider Y as an alternative letter for the phoneme I in languages like Spanish, although Y as the &quot;Greek I&quot; was actually pronounced like the modern German ü or the phonetic /y/.

<doc id="15039" wikidata="Q610" url="?curid=15039" title="Iona">
<text>Iona (; , sometimes simply &quot;Ì&quot;) is an island in the Inner Hebrides, off the Ross of Mull on the western coast of Scotland. It is mainly known for Iona Abbey, though there are other buildings on the island. Iona Abbey was a centre of Gaelic monasticism for three centuries and is today known for its relative tranquility and natural environment. It is a tourist destination and a place for spiritual retreats. Its modern Scottish Gaelic name means &quot;Iona of (Saint) Columba&quot; (formerly anglicised as &quot;Icolmkill&quot;).

In 2019, Iona&#x27;s estimated population was 120. In March 1980, the Hugh Fraser Foundation donated much of the main island (and its off-lying islands) to the current owner, the National Trust for Scotland. The abbey and some church buildings are owned by the Iona Cathedral Trust.

One publication, describing the religious significance of the island, says that the island is &quot;known as the birthplace of Celtic Christianity in Scotland,” and notes that “St Columba came here in the year 563 to establish the Abbey, which still stands&quot;.

== Etymology ==
Because the Hebrides have been successively occupied by speakers of several languages since the Iron Age, many of its islands&#x27; names have more than one possible meaning. Nonetheless, few, if any, have accumulated as many different names over the centuries as the island now known in English as &quot;Iona&quot;.

The place-name scholar William J. Watson has shown that the earliest recorded names of the island meant something like &quot;yew-place&quot;. The element &quot;Ivo-&quot;, denoting &quot;yew&quot;, occurs in inscriptions in the ogham alphabet (&quot;Iva-cattos&quot; [genitive], &quot;Iva-geni&quot; [genitive]) and in Gaulish names (&quot;Ivo-rix&quot;, &quot;Ivo-magus&quot;); it may also be the basis of early Gaelic names like &quot;Eógan&quot; (ogham: &quot;Ivo-genos&quot;). The island&#x27;s name may also be related to the name of a mythological figure, &quot;Fer hÍ mac Eogabail&quot;, the foster-son of Manannán, whose forename meaning &quot;man of the yew&quot;.

Coates (2006) disputes the &quot;yew&quot; interpretation due to a lack of archeological evidence for yew on the island. Coates instead compares the Punic term &quot;’y&quot; (&quot;island, isolated place&quot;).

Mac an Tàilleir (2003) has analyzed the more recent Gaelic names of &quot;Ì&quot;, &quot;Ì Chaluim Chille&quot; and &quot;Eilean Idhe&quot;. He notes that the name &quot;Ì&quot; was &quot;generally lengthened to avoid confusion&quot; to &quot;Ì Chaluim Chille&quot;, which means &quot;Calum&#x27;s Iona&quot; or &quot;island of Calum&#x27;s monastery&quot;. (&quot;Calum&quot;&#x27;s latinized form is &quot;Columba&quot;.) This confusion would have arisen because &quot;ì&quot;, the original name of the island, would have been confused with the now-obsolete Gaelic noun &quot;ì&quot;, meaning &quot;island&quot;, which was derived from the Old Norse word for island (&quot;ey&quot;). &quot;Eilean Idhe&quot; means &quot;the isle of Iona&quot;, also known as &quot;Ì nam ban bòidheach&quot; (&quot;the isle of beautiful women&quot;). The modern English name comes from yet another variant, &quot;Ioua&quot;, which arose either from Adomnán&#x27;s 7th century attempt to make the Gaelic name fit Latin grammar, or spontaneously, as a derivative of &quot;Ivova&quot; (&quot;yew place&quot;). The change in the island&#x27;s name from &quot;Ioua&quot;&#x27; to &quot;Iona&quot;, which is attested from c. 1274, resulted from a transcription error due to the similarity of &quot;n&quot; and &quot;u&quot; in Insular Minuscule script.

Despite the continuity of forms in Gaelic from the pre-Norse to the post-Norse era, Haswell-Smith (2004) speculates that the island&#x27;s name may be connected with the Norse word &quot;Hiōe&quot;, meaning &quot;island of the den of the brown bear&quot;. The medieval English-language version of the name was &quot;Icolmkill&quot; (and variants thereof).

=== Folk etymology ===
Murray (1966) claims that the &quot;ancient&quot; Gaelic name was &quot;Innis nan Druinich&quot; (&quot;the isle of Druidic hermits&quot;), but there is no evidence for the &quot;ancient&quot; use of such a name before the nineteenth century when it appears in the &quot;New Statistical Account&quot; and it may arise from a misunderstanding of the name &quot;Cladh nan Druineach&quot;, which means &#x27;burial ground of the embroideresses or artificers&#x27; – a cemetery on the east shore of the island. He also repeats a Gaelic story (which he admits is apocryphal) that as Columba&#x27;s coracle first drew close to the island one of his companions cried out &quot;Chì mi i&quot; meaning &quot;I see her&quot; and that Columba&#x27;s response was &quot;Henceforth we shall call her Ì&quot;.

== Geology ==
The geology of Iona is quite complex given the island&#x27;s size and quite distinct from that of nearby Mull. About half of the island&#x27;s bedrock is Scourian gneiss assigned to the Lewisian complex and dating from the Archaean eon making it some of the oldest rock in Britain and indeed Europe. Closely associated with these gneisses are mylonite and meta-anorthosite and melagabbro. Along the eastern coast facing Mull are steeply dipping Neoproterozoic age metaconglomerates, metasandstones, metamudstones and hornfelsed metasiltstones ascribed to the Iona Group, described traditionally as Torridonian. In the southwest and on parts of the west coast are pelites and semipelites of Archaean to Proterozoic age. There are small outcrops of Silurian age pink granite on southeastern beaches, similar to those of the Ross of Mull pluton cross the sound to the east. Numerous geological faults cross the island, many in an E-W or NW-SE alignment. Devonian aged microdiorite dykes are found in places and some of these are themselves cut by Palaeocene age camptonite and monchiquite dykes ascribed to the &quot;Iona-Ross of Mull dyke swarm&quot;. More recent sedimentary deposits of Quaternary age include both present day beach deposits and raised marine deposits around Iona as well as some restricted areas of blown sand.

== Geography ==

Iona lies about from the coast of Mull. It is about wide and long with a resident population of 125. Like other places swept by ocean breezes, there are few trees; most of them are near the parish church.

Iona&#x27;s highest point is Dùn Ì, , an Iron Age hill fort dating from 100 BC – A.D. 200. Iona&#x27;s geographical features include the Bay at the Back of the Ocean and &quot;Càrn Cùl ri Éirinn&quot; (the Hill/Cairn of [turning the] Back to Ireland), said to be adjacent to the beach where St. Columba first landed.

The main settlement, located at St. Ronan&#x27;s Bay on the eastern side of the island, is called &quot;Baile Mòr&quot; and is also known locally as &quot;The Village&quot;. The primary school, post office, the island&#x27;s two hotels, the Bishop&#x27;s House and the ruins of the Nunnery are here. The Abbey and MacLeod Centre are a short walk to the north. Port Bàn (white port) beach on the west side of the island is home to the Iona Beach Party.

There are numerous offshore islets and skerries: Eilean Annraidh (island of storm) and Eilean Chalbha (calf island) to the north, Rèidh Eilean and Stac MhicMhurchaidh to the west and Eilean Mùsimul (mouse holm island) and Soa Island to the south are amongst the largest. The steamer &quot;Cathcart Park&quot; carrying a cargo of salt from Runcorn to Wick ran aground on Soa on 15 April 1912, the crew of 11 escaping in two boats.

=== Subdivision ===
On a map of 1874, the following territorial subdivision is indicated (from north to south):
* Ceann Tsear (East Head);
* Sliabh Meanach (Middle Mountain);
* Machar (Low-lying Grassy Plain);
* Sliginach (Shelly Area);
* Sliabh Siar (Rear Mountain);
* Staonaig (Sloping Ground).

== History ==
=== Dál Riata ===
In the early Historic Period Iona lay within the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata, in the region controlled by the Cenél Loairn (i.e. Lorn, as it was then). The island was the site of a highly important monastery (see Iona Abbey) during the Early Middle Ages. The monastery was founded in 563 by the monk Columba, also known as Colm Cille, who sailed here from Ireland to live the monastic life. Much later legends (a thousand years later, and without any good evidence) said that he had been exiled from his native Ireland as a result of his involvement in the Battle of Cul Dreimhne. Columba and twelve companions went into exile on Iona and founded a monastery there. The monastery was hugely successful and may have played a role in the conversion to Christianity of the Picts and Gaels of present-day Scotland in the late 6th century, and was certainly central to the conversion of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria in 635. Many satellite institutions were founded, and Iona became the centre of one of the most important monastic systems in Great Britain and Ireland.

Iona became a renowned centre of learning, and its scriptorium produced highly important documents, probably including the original texts of the Iona Chronicle, thought to be the source for the early Irish annals. The monastery is often associated with the distinctive practices and traditions known as Celtic Christianity. In particular, Iona was a major supporter of the &quot;Celtic&quot; system for calculating the date of Easter at the time of the Easter controversy, which pitted supporters of the Celtic system against those favoring the &quot;Roman&quot; system used elsewhere in Western Christianity. The controversy weakened Iona&#x27;s ties to Northumbria, which adopted the Roman system at the Synod of Whitby in 664, and to Pictland, which followed suit in the early 8th century. Iona itself did not adopt the Roman system until 715, according to the Anglo-Saxon historian Bede. Iona&#x27;s prominence was further diminished over the next centuries as a result of Viking raids and the rise of other powerful monasteries in the system, such as the Abbey of Kells.

The Book of Kells may have been produced or begun on Iona towards the end of the 8th century. Around this time the island&#x27;s exemplary high crosses were sculpted; these may be the first such crosses to contain the ring around the intersection that became characteristic of the &quot;Celtic cross&quot;. The series of Viking raids on Iona began in 794 and, after its treasures had been plundered many times, Columba&#x27;s relics were removed and divided two ways between Scotland and Ireland in 849 as the monastery was abandoned.

=== Kingdom of the Isles ===
As the Norse domination of the west coast of Scotland advanced, Iona became part of the Kingdom of the Isles. The Norse &quot;Rex plurimarum insularum&quot; Amlaíb Cuarán died in 980 or 981 whilst in &quot;religious retirement&quot; on Iona. Nonetheless, the island was sacked twice by his successors, on Christmas night 986 and again in 987. Although Iona was never again important to Ireland, it rose to prominence once more in Scotland following the establishment of the Kingdom of Scotland in the later 9th century; the ruling dynasty of Scotland traced its origin to Iona, and the island thus became an important spiritual centre for the new kingdom, with many of its early kings buried there. However, a campaign by Magnus Barelegs led to the formal acknowledgement of Norwegian control of Argyll, in 1098.

Somerled, the brother-in-law of Norway&#x27;s governor of the region (the &quot;King of the Isles&quot;), launched a revolt and made the kingdom independent. A convent for Augustinian nuns was established in about 1208, with Bethóc, Somerled&#x27;s daughter, as first prioress. The present buildings are of the Benedictine abbey, Iona Abbey, from about 1203, dissolved at the Reformation.

On Somerled&#x27;s death, nominal Norwegian overlordship of the Kingdom was re-established, but de facto control was split between Somerled&#x27;s sons, and his brother-in-law.

=== Kingdom of Scotland ===
Following the 1266 Treaty of Perth the Hebrides were transferred from Norwegian to Scottish overlordship. At the end of the century, King John Balliol was challenged for the throne by Robert the Bruce. By this point, Somerled&#x27;s descendants had split into three groups, the MacRory, MacDougalls, and MacDonalds. The MacDougalls backed Balliol, so when he was defeated by Bruce, the latter exiled the MacDougalls and transferred their island territories to the MacDonalds; by marrying the heir of the MacRorys, the heir of the MacDonalds re-unified most of Somerled&#x27;s realm, creating the Lordship of the Isles, under nominal Scottish authority. Iona, which had been a MacDougall territory (together with the rest of Lorn), was given to the Campbells, where it remained for half a century.

In 1354, though in exile and without control of his ancestral lands, John, the MacDougall heir, quitclaimed any rights he had over Mull and Iona to the Lord of the Isles (though this had no meaningful effect at the time). When Robert&#x27;s son, David II, became king, he spent some time in English captivity; following his release, in 1357, he restored MacDougall authority over Lorn. The 1354 quitclaim, which seems to have been an attempt to ensure peace in just such an eventuality, took automatic effect, splitting Mull and Iona from Lorn, and making it subject to the Lordship of the Isles. Iona remained part of the Lordship of the Isles for the next century and a half.

Following the 1491 Raid on Ross, the Lordship of the Isles was dismantled, and Scotland gained full control of Iona for the second time. The monastery and nunnery continued to be active until the Reformation, when buildings were demolished and all but three of the 360 carved crosses destroyed. The Augustine nunnery now only survives as a number of 13th century ruins, including a church and cloister. By the 1760s little more of the nunnery remained standing than at present, though it is the most complete remnant of a medieval nunnery in Scotland.

=== Post-Union ===
After a visit in 1773, the English writer Samuel Johnson remarked:

:The island, which was once the metropolis of learning and piety, now has no school for education, nor temple for worship.

He estimated the population of the village at 70 families or perhaps 350 inhabitants.

In the 19th century, green-streaked marble was commercially mined in the south-east of Iona; the quarry and machinery survive, see &quot;Marble Quarry remains&quot; below.

== Iona Abbey ==


Iona Abbey, now an ecumenical church, is of particular historical and religious interest to pilgrims and visitors alike. It is the most elaborate and best-preserved ecclesiastical building surviving from the Middle Ages in the Western Isles of Scotland. Though modest in scale in comparison to medieval abbeys elsewhere in Western Europe, it has a wealth of fine architectural detail and monuments of many periods. The enabling endowments, the core economic strength and life-blood of the Abbey came from successive Clan Donald Lords of the Isles and for 300 years were regularly confirmed, honoured, protected, increased and expanded. Endowments had &quot;carta confirmations&quot; and additional ones made by them during the 14th and 15th centuries as late as 1440 and 1485. Donald of Harlaw (1386-1421): &quot;gave lands to the monastery of Iona, and every immunity which the monastery of Iona had from his ancestors before him&quot; – MacVurich. It might be expressed that Iona Abbey had been acting as a &quot;(holy owned) land trust&quot; for Clan Donald from Somerled who built St. Oran&#x27;s Chapel.

The 8th Duke of Argyll presented the sacred buildings and sites of the island to the Iona Cathedral trust in 1899. Historic Environment Scotland also recommends visiting the Augustinian nunnery, &quot;the most complete nunnery complex to survive in Scotland&quot;. The nunnery was founded by Somerled&#x27;s son, Reginald, as was Iona Abbey and Saddell Abbey. Reginald&#x27;s sister, Beathag, was the first Prioress of the Iona Nunnery. The nunnery declined after the Scottish Reformation but was still used as a burial place for women.

In front of the Abbey stands the 9th century St Martin&#x27;s Cross, one of the best-preserved Celtic crosses in the British Isles, and a replica of the 8th century St John&#x27;s Cross (original fragments in the Abbey museum).

The ancient burial ground, called the Rèilig Odhrain (Eng: Oran&#x27;s &quot;burial place&quot; or &quot;cemetery&quot;), contains the 12th century chapel built by Somerled where the Lords of the Isles were buried and named after St Odhrán (said to be Columba&#x27;s uncle). It was restored at the same time as the Abbey itself. It contains a number of medieval grave monuments. The abbey graveyard is said to contain the graves of many early Scottish Kings, as well as Norse kings from Ireland and Norway. Iona became the burial site for the kings of Dál Riata and their successors. Notable burials there include:

* Cináed mac Ailpín, king of the Picts (also known today as &quot;Kenneth I of Scotland&quot;);
* Domnall mac Causantín, alternatively &quot;king of the Picts&quot; or &quot;king of Scotland&quot; (&quot;Donald II&quot;);
* Máel Coluim mac Domnaill, king of Scotland (&quot;Malcolm I&quot;);
* Donnchad mac Crínáin, king of Scotland (&quot;Duncan I&quot;);
* Mac Bethad mac Findlaích, king of Scotland (&quot;Macbeth&quot;);
* Domnall mac Donnchada, king of Scotland (&quot;Donald III&quot;);
* John Smith, Labour Party Leader.

In 1549 an inventory of 48 Scottish, 8 Norwegian and 4 Irish kings was recorded. None of these graves are now identifiable (their inscriptions were reported to have worn away at the end of the 17th century). Saint Baithin and Saint Failbhe may also be buried on the island. The Abbey graveyard is also the final resting place of John Smith, the former Labour Party leader, who loved Iona. His grave is marked with an epitaph quoting Alexander Pope: &quot;An honest man&#x27;s the noblest work of God&quot;.

Limited archaeological investigations commissioned by the National Trust for Scotland found some evidence for ancient burials in 2013. The excavations, conducted in the area of Martyrs Bay, revealed burials from the 6th–8th centuries, probably jumbled up and reburied in the 13–15th centuries.

Other early Christian and medieval monuments have been removed for preservation to the cloister arcade of the Abbey, and the Abbey museum (in the medieval infirmary). The ancient buildings of Iona Abbey are now cared for by Historic Environment Scotland (there is an entrance charge to visit them).

== Marble quarry remains ==
The remains of a marble quarrying enterprise are present in a small bay on the south-east shore of Iona. The quarry is the source of &quot;Iona Marble&quot;, a translucent green and white stone, much used in brooches and other jewellery. The stone has been known of for centuries and was credited with healing and other powers. While the quarry had been used in a small way, it was not until around the end of the 18th century when it was opened up on a more industrial scale by the Duke of Argyle. The difficulties of extracting the hard stone and transporting it meant that the scheme was short lived. Another attempt was started in 1907, this time more successful with considerable quantities of stone extracted and indeed exported. The First World War impacted the quarry, with little quarrying after 1914 and the operation finally closed in 1919. A painting showing the quarry in operation, &quot;The Marble Quarry, Iona&quot; (1909) by David Young Cameron, is in the collection of Cartwright Hall art gallery in Bradford. The site has been designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

== Present day ==
The island, other than the land owned by the Iona Cathedral Trust, was purchased from the Duke of Argyll by Hugh Fraser in 1979 and donated to the National Trust for Scotland. In 2001 Iona&#x27;s population was 125 and by the time of the 2011 census this had grown to 177 usual residents. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702. The estimated permanent population in 2020 was 120.

The island&#x27;s tourism bureau estimated that roughly 130,000 visitors arrived each year. Many tourists come to visit the Abbey and other ecclesiastical properties and the marble quarry or to enjoy the nine beaches that are within walking distance of the main area.
=== Iona Community ===

Not to be confused with the local island community, Iona (Abbey) Community is based within Iona Abbey.

In 1938 George MacLeod founded the Iona Community, an ecumenical Christian community of men and women from different walks of life and different traditions in the Christian church committed to seeking new ways of living the Gospel of Jesus in today&#x27;s world. This community is a leading force in the present Celtic Christian revival.

The Iona Community runs three residential centres on the Isle of Iona and on Mull, where one can live together in community with people of every background from all over the world. Weeks at the centres often follow a programme related to the concerns of the Iona Community.

The 8 tonne &quot;Fallen Christ&quot; sculpture by Ronald Rae was permanently situated outside the MacLeod Centre in February 2008.

=== Transport ===
Visitors can reach Iona by the 10 minute ferry trip across the Sound of Iona from Fionnphort on Mull. The most common route from the mainland is via Oban in Argyll and Bute, where regular ferries connect to Craignure on Mull, from where the scenic road runs to Fionnphort. Tourist coaches and local bus services meet the ferries.

Car ownership is lightly regulated, with no requirement for a MOT Certificate or payment of Road Tax for cars kept permanently on the island, but vehicular access is restricted to permanent residents and there are few cars. Visitors are not allowed to bring vehicles onto the island although &quot;blue badge holders with restricted mobility ... may apply for a permit under certain exemptions&quot;. Visitors will find the village, the shops, the post office, the cafe, the hotels and the abbey are all within walking distance. Bike hire is available at the pier, and on Mull. Taxi service is also available.


=== Tourism ===
Conde Nast Traveller recommends the island for its &quot;peaceful atmosphere ... a popular place for spiritual retreats&quot; but also recommends the &quot;sandy beaches, cliffs, rocks, fields and bogs ... &quot;wildflowers and birds such as the rare corncrake and puffins&quot; as well as the &quot;abundance of sea life&quot;.

The Iona Council advises visitors that they can find a campsite (at Cnoc Oran), a hostel (at Lagandorain), family run bed and breakfasts and two hotels on the island in addition to several self-catering houses. The agency also mentions that distances are short, with the Abbey a mere 10 minutes walk from the pier. Tourists can rent bikes or use the local taxi.

== Iona in Scottish painting ==
The island of Iona has played an important role in Scottish landscape painting, especially during the Twentieth Century. As travel to north and west Scotland became easier from the mid C18 on, artists&#x27; visits to the island steadily increased. The Abbey remains in particular became frequently recorded during this early period. Many of the artists are listed and illustrated in the valuable book, &quot;Iona Portrayed – The Island through Artists&#x27; Eyes 1760–1960&quot;, which lists over 170 artists known to have painted on the island.

The C20, however, saw the greatest period of influence on landscape painting, in particular through the many paintings of the island produced by F. C. B. Cadell and S. J. Peploe, two of the &quot;Scottish Colourists&quot;. As with many artists, both professional and amateur, they were attracted by the unique quality of light, the white sandy beaches, the aquamarine colours of the sea and the landscape of rich greens and rocky outcrops. While Cadell and Peploe are perhaps best known, many major Scottish painters of the C20 worked on Iona and visited many times – for example George Houston, D. Y. Cameron, James Shearer, John Duncan and John Maclauchlan Milne, among many.

== Media and the arts ==
Samuel Johnson wrote &quot;That man is little to be envied whose patriotism would not gain force upon the plains of Marathon or whose piety would not grow warmer amid the ruins of Iona.&quot;

In Jules Verne&#x27;s novel &quot;The Green Ray&quot;, the heroes visit Iona in chapters 13 to 16. The inspiration is romantic, the ruins of the island are conducive to daydreaming. The young heroine, Helena Campbell, argues that Scotland in general and Iona in particular are the scene of the appearance of goblins and other familiar demons.

In Jean Raspail&#x27;s novel &quot;The Fisherman&#x27;s Ring&quot; (1995), his cardinal is one of the last to support the antipope Benedict XIII and his successors.

In the novel &quot;The Carved Stone&quot; (by Guillaume Prévost), the young Samuel Faulkner is projected in time as he searches for his father and lands on Iona in the year 800, then threatened by the Vikings.

&quot;Peace of Iona&quot; is a song written by Mike Scott that appears on the studio album &quot;Universal Hall&quot; and on the live recording &quot;Karma to Burn&quot; by The Waterboys. Iona is the setting for the song &quot;Oran&quot; on the 1997 Steve McDonald album &quot;Stone of Destiny&quot;.

Kenneth C. Steven published an anthology of poetry entitled &quot;Iona: Poems&quot; in 2000 inspired by his association with the island and the surrounding area.

Iona is featured prominently in the first episode (&quot;By the Skin of Our Teeth&quot;) of the celebrated arts series &quot;&quot; (1969).

Iona is the setting of Jeanne M. Dams&#x27; Dorothy Martin mystery &quot;Holy Terror of the Hebrides&quot; (1998).

The Academy Award–nominated Irish animated film &quot;The Secret of Kells&quot; is about the creation of the Book of Kells. One of the characters, Brother Aidan, is a master illuminator from Iona Abbey who had helped to illustrate the Book, but had to escape the island with it during a Viking invasion.

Frances Macdonald the contemporary Scottish artist based in Crinian, Argyll, regularly paints landscapes on Iona.

Neil Gaiman&#x27;s poem &quot;In Relig Odhrain&quot;, published in &quot;Trigger Warning: Short Fictions and Disturbances (2015)&quot;, retells the story of Oran&#x27;s death, and the creation of the chapel on Iona. This poem was made into a short stop-motion animated film, released in 2019.

Iona&#x27;s local golf course was featured on Season 7&#x27;s &quot;Adventure&#x27;s in Golf&quot; by documentary filmmaker, Erik Anders Lang.

<doc id="15040" wikidata="Q35224" url="?curid=15040" title="Ido">
<text>Ido () is a constructed language derived from a reformed version of Esperanto, and similarly designed with the goal of being a universal second language for people of diverse backgrounds. To function as an effective &quot;international auxiliary language&quot;, Ido was specifically designed to be grammatically, orthographically, and lexicographically regular (and, above all, easy to learn and use). It is the most successful of the many Esperanto derivatives, called &quot;Esperantidoj.&quot;

Ido was created in 1907 out of a desire to reform perceived flaws in Esperanto, a language that had been created 20 years earlier to facilitate international communication. The name comes from the Esperanto word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;offspring&quot;, since the language is a &quot;descendant&quot; of Esperanto. After its inception, Ido gained support from some in the Esperanto community. A setback occurred with the sudden death in 1914 of one of its most influential proponents, Louis Couturat. In 1928, leader Otto Jespersen left the movement for his own language Novial.

Ido declined in popularity for two reasons: the emergence of further schisms arising from competing reform projects, and a general lack of awareness of Ido as a candidate for an international language. These obstacles weakened the movement and it was not until the rise of the Internet that it began to regain momentum.

Ido uses the same 26 letters as the English (Latin) alphabet, with no diacritics. It draws its vocabulary from English, French, German, Italian, Latin, Russian, Spanish and Portuguese, and is largely intelligible to those who have studied Esperanto.

Several works of literature have been translated into Ido, including &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, the Book of Psalms, and the Gospel of Luke. As of the year 2000, there were approximately 100–200 Ido speakers in the world. As of 2022, Ido has 26 native speakers in Finland.

==History==
The idea of a universal second language is not new, and constructed languages are not a recent phenomenon. The first known constructed language was Hildegard of Bingen&#x27;s Lingua Ignota, created in the 12th century. The concept did not attract significant interest until the language Volapük was created in 1879. Volapük was popular for some time and apparently had a few thousand users, but was later eclipsed by the popularity of Esperanto, which arose in 1887. Several other languages, such as Latino sine Flexione and Idiom Neutral were also put forward. It was during this time that French mathematician Louis Couturat formed the &quot;Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language&quot;.

This delegation made a formal request to the International Association of Academies in Vienna to select and endorse an international language; the request was rejected in May 1907. The Delegation then met as a Committee in Paris in October 1907 to discuss the adoption of a standard international language. Among the languages considered was a new language anonymously submitted at the last moment (and therefore against the Committee rules) under the pen name &quot;Ido&quot;. In the end the committee, always without plenary sessions and consisting of only 12 members, concluded the last day with 4 votes for and 1 abstention. They concluded that no language was completely acceptable, but that Esperanto could be accepted &quot;on condition of several modifications to be realized by the permanent Commission in the direction defined by the conclusions of the Report of the Secretaries [Louis Couturat and Léopold Leau] and by the Ido project&quot;.

Esperanto&#x27;s inventor, L. L. Zamenhof, having heard a number of complaints, had suggested in 1894 a proposal for a reformed Esperanto with several changes that Ido adopted and made it closer to French: eliminating the accented letters and the accusative case, changing the plural to an Italianesque &quot;-i&quot;, and replacing the table of correlatives with more Latinate words. However, the Esperanto community voted and rejected Zamenhof&#x27;s reformed Esperanto, and likewise most rejected the recommendations of the 1907 Committee nominally composed of 12 members. Zamenhof, undoubtedly reminiscent of his experience of the 1894 reforms, strongly supported the Esperanto Committee majority decision. Furthermore, controversy ensued when the &quot;Ido project&quot; was found to have been primarily devised by Louis de Beaufront, whom Zamenhof had chosen to represent Esperanto before the committee, as the committee&#x27;s rules dictated that the creator of a submitted language could not defend it. The Committee&#x27;s meetings were mainly conducted in French, with occasional German. When the president of the Committee asked who was the author of Ido&#x27;s project, Couturat, de Beaufront and Leau answered that they were not. De Beaufront was the person who presented Ido&#x27;s project and gave a description as a better, richer version of Esperanto. Couturat, Leau, de Beaufront and Jespersen were finally the only members who voted, all of them for Ido&#x27;s project. A month later, Couturat accidentally forwarded Jespersen a copy of a letter in which he acknowledged that de Beaufront was the author of the Ido project. Jespersen was angered by this and asked for a public confession. De Beaufront procrastinated for four months before making a public confession.

It is estimated that some 20% of Esperanto leaders and 3–4% of ordinary Esperantists switched to Ido, which from then on suffered constant modifications seeking to perfect it, but which ultimately had the effect of causing many Ido speakers to give up on trying to learn it. Although it fractured the Esperanto movement, the schism gave the remaining Esperantists the freedom to concentrate on using and promoting their language as it stood. At the same time, it gave the Idists freedom to continue working on their own language for several more years before actively promoting it. The &quot;Uniono di la Amiki di la Linguo Internaciona&quot; (&quot;Union of Friends of the International Language&quot;) was established along with an Ido Academy to work out the details of the new language.

Couturat, who was the leading proponent of Ido, was killed in an automobile accident in 1914. This, along with World War I, practically suspended the activities of the Ido Academy from 1914 to 1920. In 1928 Ido&#x27;s major intellectual supporter, the Danish linguist Otto Jespersen, published his own planned language, Novial. His leaving the Ido movement set it back even further.

===Digital era===
The language still has active speakers, numbering about 500. The Internet has sparked a renewal of interest in the language in recent years. A sample of 24 Idists on the Yahoo! group &quot;Idolisto&quot; during November 2005 showed that 57% had begun their studies of the language during the preceding three years, 32% from the mid-1990s to 2002, and 8% had known the language from before.

===Changes===
Few changes have been made to Ido since 1922.

Camiel de Cock was named secretary of linguistic issues in 1990, succeeding Roger Moureaux. He resigned after the creation of a linguistic committee in 1991. De Cock was succeeded by Robert C. Carnaghan, who held the position from 1992 to 2008. No new words were adopted between 2001 and 2006. Following the 2008–2011 elections of ULI&#x27;s direction committee, Gonçalo Neves replaced Carnaghan as secretary of linguistic issues in February 2008. Neves resigned in August 2008. A new linguistic committee was formed in 2010. In April 2010, Tiberio Madonna was appointed as secretary of linguistic issues, succeeding Neves. 
In January 2011, ULI approved eight new words. This was the first addition of words in many years. After a series of severe conflicts with the Directing Committee of ULI, Tiberio Madonna was revoked as secretary of linguistic issues on the 26th of May 2013 by official announcement from Loïs Landais, the secretary of ULI .
In January 2022, ULI approved a set of new words (34)

==Phonology==
Ido has five vowel phonemes. The values and are interchangeable depending on speaker preference, as are and . The orthographic sequences and indicate diphthongs in word roots but not when created by affixing.

All polysyllabic words are stressed on the second-to-last syllable except for verb infinitives, which are stressed on the last syllableskolo, kafeo and lernas for &quot;school&quot;, &quot;coffee&quot; and the present tense of &quot;to learn&quot;, but irar, savar and drinkar for &quot;to go&quot;, &quot;to know&quot; and &quot;to drink&quot;. If an i or u precedes another vowel, the pair is considered part of the same syllable when applying the accent rulethus radio, familio and manuo for &quot;radio&quot;, &quot;family&quot; and &quot;hand&quot;, unless the two vowels are the only ones in the word, in which case the &quot;i&quot; or &quot;u&quot; is stressed: dio, frua for &quot;day&quot; and &quot;early&quot;.

==Orthography==
Ido uses the same 26 letters as the English alphabet and ISO Basic Latin alphabet with three digraphs and no ligatures or diacritics. Where the table below lists two pronunciations, either is perfectly acceptable.

The digraphs are:

==Grammar==
The definite article is &quot;la&quot; and is invariable. The indefinite article (a/an) does not exist in Ido. Each word in the Ido vocabulary is built from a root word. A word consists of a root and a grammatical ending. Other words can be formed from that word by removing the grammatical ending and adding a new one, or by inserting certain affixes between the root and the grammatical ending.

Some of the grammatical endings are defined as follows:

These are the same as in Esperanto except for &quot;-i&quot;, &quot;-ir&quot;, &quot;-ar&quot;, &quot;-or&quot; and &quot;-ez&quot;. Esperanto marks noun plurals by an &quot;agglutinative&quot; ending &quot;-j&quot; (so plural nouns end in &quot;-oj&quot;), uses &quot;-i&quot; for verb infinitives (Esperanto infinitives are tenseless), and uses &quot;-u&quot; for the imperative. Verbs in Ido, as in Esperanto, do not conjugate depending on person, number or gender; the -as, -is, and -os endings suffice whether the subject is I, you, he, she, they, or anything else. For the word &quot;to be,&quot; Ido allows either &quot;esas&quot; or &quot;es&quot; in the present tense; however, the full forms must be used for the past tense &quot;esis&quot; and future tense &quot;esos&quot;.&quot; Adjectives and adverbs are compared in Ido by means of the words &quot;plu&quot; = more, &quot;maxim&quot; = most, &quot;min&quot; = less, &quot;minim&quot; = least, &quot;kam&quot; = than/as. There exist in Ido three categories of adverbs: the simple, the derived, and the composed. The simple adverbs do not need special endings, for example: &quot;tre&quot; = very, &quot;tro&quot; = too, &quot;olim&quot; = formerly, &quot;nun&quot; = now, &quot;nur&quot; = only. The derived and composed adverbs, not being originally adverbs but derived from nouns, adjectives and verbs, have the ending -e.

===Syntax===
Ido word order is generally the same as English (subject–verb–object), so the sentence &quot;Me havas la blua libro&quot; is the same as the English &quot;I have the blue book&quot;, both in meaning and word order. There are a few differences, however:
* Adjectives can precede the noun as in English, or follow the noun as in Spanish. Thus, &quot;Me havas la libro blua&quot; means the same thing.
* Ido has the accusative suffix &quot;-n&quot;. Unlike Esperanto, this suffix is only required when the object of the sentence is not clear, for example, when the subject-verb-object word order is not followed. Thus, &quot;La blua libron me havas&quot; also means the same thing.

Ido generally does not impose rules of grammatical agreement between grammatical categories within a sentence. For example, the verb in a sentence is invariable regardless of the number and person of the subject. Nor must the adjectives be pluralized as well the nounsin Ido &quot;the large books&quot; would be &quot;la granda libri&quot; as opposed to the Esperanto &quot;la grandaj libroj&quot;.

Negation occurs in Ido by simply adding ne before a verb: Me ne havas libro means &quot;I do not have a book&quot;. This as well does not vary, and thus the &quot;I do not&quot;, &quot;He does not&quot;, &quot;They do not&quot; before a verb are simply Me ne, Il ne, and Li ne. In the same way, past tense and future tense negatives are formed by ne before the conjugated verb. &quot;I will not go&quot; and &quot;I did not go&quot; become Me ne iros and Me ne iris respectively.

Yes/no questions are formed by the particle ka in front of the question. &quot;I have a book&quot; (me havas libro) becomes Ka me havas libro? (do I have a book?). Ka can also be placed in front of a noun without a verb to make a simple question, corresponding to the English &quot;is it?&quot; Ka Mark? can mean, &quot;Are you Mark?&quot;, &quot;Is it Mark?&quot;, &quot;Do you mean Mark?&quot; depending on the context.

===Pronouns===
The pronouns of Ido were revised to make them more acoustically distinct than those of Esperanto, which all end in &quot;i&quot;. Especially the singular and plural first-person pronouns &quot;mi&quot; and &quot;ni&quot; may be difficult to distinguish in a noisy environment, so Ido has &quot;me&quot; and &quot;ni&quot; instead. Ido also distinguishes between intimate (&quot;tu&quot;) and formal (&quot;vu&quot;) second-person singular pronouns as well as plural second-person pronouns (&quot;vi&quot;) not marked for intimacy. Furthermore, Ido has a pan-gender third-person pronoun &quot;lu&quot; (it can mean &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, or &quot;it&quot;, depending on the context) in addition to its masculine (&quot;il&quot;), feminine (&quot;el&quot;), and neuter (&quot;ol&quot;) third-person pronouns.
# &quot;ci&quot;, although technically the familiar form of the word &quot;you&quot; in Esperanto, is seldom used. Esperanto&#x27;s inventor himself did not include the pronoun in the first book on Esperanto and only later reluctantly; later he recommended against using &quot;ci&quot; because different cultures have conflicting traditions regarding the use of the familiar and formal forms of &quot;you&quot;.
#&quot;ri&quot;, &quot;iŝi&quot;, &quot;iĝi&quot; and by extension &quot;iri&quot; are proposed neologisms and are rare, but they are still used albeit seldom.

&quot;ol&quot;, like English &quot;it&quot; and Esperanto &quot;ĝi&quot;, is not limited to inanimate objects, but can be used &quot;for entities whose sex is indeterminate: &quot;babies, children, humans, youths, elders, people, individuals, horses, [cattle], cats,&quot; etc.&quot;

&quot;Lu&quot; is often mistakenly labeled an epicene pronoun, that is, one that refers to both masculine and feminine beings, but in fact, &quot;lu&quot; is more properly a &quot;pan-gender&quot; pronoun, as it is also used for referring to inanimate objects. From &quot;Kompleta Gramatiko Detaloza di la Linguo Internaciona Ido&quot; by Beaufront:

===Table of correlatives===
Ido makes correlatives by combining entire words together and changing the word ending, with some irregularities to show distinction.
# The initial &quot;i&quot; can be omitted: &quot;ta&quot;, &quot;to&quot;, &quot;ti&quot;, &quot;ta&quot;.
# One can omit the initial &quot;a&quot;: &quot;ultempe&quot;, &quot;nultempe&quot;, &quot;ulspeca&quot;, &quot;nulspeca&quot;, &quot;ulmaniere&quot;, &quot;nulmaniere&quot;.
# &quot;omnatempe&quot; is correct and usable, but &quot;sempre&quot; is the actual word.
# Instead of &quot;irga quanto&quot;, &quot;nula quanto&quot; and &quot;la tota quanto&quot; one usually says &quot;irgo&quot;, &quot;nulo&quot; and &quot;omno&quot;.
===Compound formation===

Composition in Ido obeys stricter rules than in Esperanto, especially formation of
nouns, adjectives and verbs from a radical of a different
class. The reversibility principle assumes that for each composition rule (affix addition), the corresponding decomposition rule (affix removal) is valid.

Hence, while in Esperanto an adjective (for instance ), formed on the noun radical , can mean an attribute ( &quot;paper-made encyclopedia&quot;) and a relation ( &quot;paper-making factory&quot;), Ido will distinguish the attribute (&quot;paper&quot; or &quot;of paper&quot; (not &quot;paper-made&quot; exactly)) from the relation (&quot;paper-making&quot;).

Similarly, means in both Esperanto and Ido the noun &quot;crown&quot;; where Esperanto allows formation of &quot;to crown&quot; by simply changing the ending from noun to verb (&quot;crowning&quot; is ), Ido requires an affix so the composition is reversible: (&quot;the act of crowning&quot; is ).

According to Claude Piron, some modifications brought by Ido are in practice impossible to use and ruin spontaneous expression: Ido displays, on linguistic level, other drawbacks Esperanto succeeded to avoid, but I don&#x27;t have at hand documents which would allow me to go further in detail. For instance, if I remember correctly, where Esperanto only has the suffix *, Ido has several: **, **, **, which match subtleties which were meant to make language clearer, but that, in practice, inhibit natural expression.

==Vocabulary==

Vocabulary in Ido is derived from French, Italian, Spanish, English, German, and Russian. Basing the vocabulary on various widespread languages was intended to make Ido as easy as possible for the greatest number of people possible. Early on, the first 5,371 Ido word roots were analyzed compared to the vocabulary of the six source languages, and the following result was found:

* 2024 roots (38%) belong to 6 languages
* 942 roots (17%) belong to 5 languages
* 1111 roots (21%) belong to 4 languages
* 585 roots (11%) belong to 3 languages
* 454 roots (8%) belong to 2 languages
* 255 roots (5%) belong to 1 language

Another analysis showed that:

* 4880 roots (91%) are found in French
* 4454 roots (83%) are found in Italian
* 4237 roots (79%) are found in Spanish
* 4219 roots (79%) are found in English
* 3302 roots (61%) are found in German
* 2821 roots (52%) are found in Russian

Vocabulary in Ido is often created through a number of official prefixes and suffixes that alter the meaning of the word. This allows a user to take existing words and modify them to create neologisms when necessary, and allows for a wide range of expression without the need to learn new vocabulary each time. Though their number is too large to be included in one article, some examples include:
*The diminutive suffix -et-. Domo (house) becomes dometo (cottage), and libro (book) becomes libreto (novelette or short story).
*The pejorative suffix -ach-. Domo becomes domacho (hovel), and libro becomes libracho (a shoddy piece of work, pulp fiction, etc.)
*The prefix retro-, which implies a reversal. Irar (to go) becomes retroirar (to go back, backward) and venar (to come) becomes retrovenar (to return).

New vocabulary is generally created through an analysis of the word, its etymology, and reference to the six source languages. If a word can be created through vocabulary already existing in the language then it will usually be adopted without need for a new radical (such as wikipedio for &quot;Wikipedia&quot;, which consists of wiki + enciklopedio for &quot;encyclopedia&quot;), and if not an entirely new word will be created. The word alternatoro for example was adopted in 1926, likely because five of the six source languages used largely the same orthography for the word, and because it was long enough to avoid being mistaken for other words in the existing vocabulary. Adoption of a word is done through consensus, after which the word will be made official by the union. Care must also be taken to avoid homonyms if possible, and usually a new word undergoes some discussion before being adopted. Foreign words that have a restricted sense and are not likely to be used in everyday life (such as the word &quot;intifada&quot; to refer to the conflict between Israel and Palestine) are left untouched, and often written in italics.

Ido, unlike Esperanto, does not assume the male sex by default. For example, Ido does not derive the word for &quot;waitress&quot; by adding a feminine suffix to &quot;waiter&quot;, as Esperanto does. Instead, Ido words are defined as sex-neutral, and two different suffixes derive masculine and feminine words from the root: &#x27; for a waiter of either sex, &#x27; for a male waiter, and &#x27; for a waitress. There are only two exceptions to this rule: First, &#x27; for &quot;father&quot;, &#x27; for &quot;mother&quot;, and &#x27; for &quot;parent&quot;, and second, &#x27; for &quot;man&quot;, &#x27; for &quot;woman&quot;, and &quot;&quot; for &quot;adult&quot;.

==Literature and publications==
Ido has a number of publications that can be subscribed to or downloaded for free in most cases. is a magazine produced in France every few months with a range of topics. is a magazine produced by the Spanish Ido Society every two months that has a range of topics, as well as a few dozen pages of work translated from other languages. is the official organ of the Ido movement and has been around since the inception of the movement in 1908. Other sites can be found with various stories, fables or proverbs along with a few books of the Bible translated into Ido on a smaller scale. The site has a few podcasts in Ido along with various songs and other recorded material.

Wikipedia includes an Ido-language edition (known in Ido as ); in 2018 it was the 93rd most visited Wikipedia, and is second most viewed Wikipedia edition in artificial language (after Esperanto).

==Symbols of Ido==

The Ido star or Jankó star is the main symbol of Ido. It is a six pointed star, with the points representing Ido&#x27;s six source languages: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish and Russian. Alternatively, the six points represent the six continents (excluding Antarctica). The emblem was originally a six pointed white star on a circular blue background, consisting of two concentric, equilateral triangles, with one vertically flipped. However, this was soon changed due to the similarity it presented with the Star of David, since a true international auxiliary language should not have religious affiliations.

After a search to find an appropriate new symbol, the Ido-Akademio decided on the current Ido symbol, created by their secretary, Paul von Jankó (hence the alternative name the Jankó star). The current Ido Star is a concave isotoxal hexagon, with a vertically flipped equilateral triangle overlaid on top. This new shape also had the benefit of being able to be copyrighted.

<text>Improvisational theatre, often called improvisation or improv, is the form of theatre, often comedy, in which most or all of what is performed is unplanned or unscripted, created spontaneously by the performers. In its purest form, the dialogue, action, story, and characters are created collaboratively by the players as the improvisation unfolds in present time, without use of an already prepared, written script.

Improvisational theatre exists in performance as a range of styles of improvisational comedy as well as some non-comedic theatrical performances. It is sometimes used in film and television, both to develop characters and scripts and occasionally as part of the final product.

Improvisational techniques are often used extensively in drama programs to train actors for stage, film, and television and can be an important part of the rehearsal process. However, the skills and processes of improvisation are also used outside the context of performing arts. This practice, known as applied improvisation, is used in classrooms as an educational tool and in businesses as a way to develop communication skills, creative problem solving, and supportive team-work abilities that are used by improvisational, ensemble players. It is sometimes used in psychotherapy as a tool to gain insight into a person&#x27;s thoughts, feelings, and relationships.

==History==
The earliest well-documented use of improvisational theatre in Western history is found in the Atellan Farce of 391 BC. From the 16th to the 18th centuries, &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; performers improvised based on a broad outline in the streets of Italy. In the 1890s, theatrical theorists and directors such as the Russian Konstantin Stanislavski and the French Jacques Copeau, founders of two major streams of acting theory, both heavily utilized improvisation in acting training and rehearsal.

===Modern===

Modern theatrical improvisation games began as drama exercises for children, which were a staple of drama education in the early 20th century thanks in part to the progressive education movement initiated by John Dewey in 1916. Some people credit American Dudley Riggs as the first vaudevillian to use audience suggestions to create improvised sketches on stage. Improvisation exercises were developed further by Viola Spolin in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s, and codified in her book &quot;Improvisation For The Theater&quot;, the first book that gave specific techniques for learning to do and teach improvisational theater. In 1977, Clive Barker&#x27;s book &quot;Theatre Games&quot; (several translations and editions) spread the ideas of improv internationally. British playwright and director Keith Johnstone wrote &quot;&quot;, a book outlining his ideas on improvisation, and invented Theatresports, which has become a staple of modern improvisational comedy and is the inspiration for the popular television show &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;

Viola Spolin influenced the first generation of modern American improvisers at The Compass Players in Chicago, which led to The Second City. Her son, Paul Sills, along with David Shepherd, started The Compass Players. Following the demise of the Compass Players, Paul Sills began The Second City. They were the first organized improv troupes in Chicago, and the modern Chicago improvisational comedy movement grew from their success.

Many of the current &quot;rules&quot; of comedic improv were first formalized in Chicago in the late 1950s and early 1960s, initially among The Compass Players troupe, which was directed by Paul Sills. From most accounts, David Shepherd provided the philosophical vision of the Compass Players, while Elaine May was central to the development of the premises for its improvisations. Mike Nichols, Ted Flicker, and Del Close were her most frequent collaborators in this regard. When The Second City opened its doors on December 16, 1959, directed by Paul Sills, his mother Viola Spolin began training new improvisers through a series of classes and exercises which became the cornerstone of modern improv training. By the mid-1960s, Viola Spolin&#x27;s classes were handed over to her protégé, Jo Forsberg, who further developed Spolin&#x27;s methods into a one-year course, which eventually became The Players Workshop, the first official school of improvisation in the United States. During this time, Forsberg trained many of the performers who went on to star on The Second City stage.

Many of the original cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; came from The Second City, and the franchise has produced such comedy stars as Mike Myers, Tina Fey, Bob Odenkirk, Amy Sedaris, Stephen Colbert, Eugene Levy, Jack McBrayer, Steve Carell, Chris Farley, Dan Aykroyd, and John Belushi.

Simultaneously, Keith Johnstone&#x27;s group The Theatre Machine, which originated in London, was touring Europe. This work gave birth to Theatresports, at first secretly in Johnstone&#x27;s workshops, and eventually in public when he moved to Canada. Toronto has been home to a rich improv tradition.

In 1984, Dick Chudnow (Kentucky Fried Theater) founded ComedySportz in Milwaukee, WI. Expansion began with the addition of ComedySportz-Madison (WI), in 1985. The first Comedy League of America National Tournament was held in 1988, with 10 teams participating. The league is now known as CSz Worldwide and boasts a roster of 29 international cities.

In San Francisco, The Committee theater was active in North Beach during the 1960s. It was founded by alumni of Chicago&#x27;s Second City, Alan Myerson and his wife Jessica. When The Committee disbanded in 1972, three major companies were formed: The Pitchell Players, The Wing, and Improvisation Inc. The only company that continued to perform Close&#x27;s Harold was the latter one. Its two former members, Michael Bossier and John Elk, formed Spaghetti Jam in San Francisco&#x27;s Old Spaghetti Factory in 1976, where shortform improv and Harolds were performed through 1983. Stand-up comedians performing down the street at the Intersection for the Arts would drop by and sit in. In 1979, Elk brought shortform to England, teaching workshops at Jacksons Lane Theatre, and he was the first American to perform at The Comedy Store, London, above a Soho strip club.

Modern political improvisation&#x27;s roots include Jerzy Grotowski&#x27;s work in Poland during the late 1950s and early 1960s, Peter Brook&#x27;s &quot;happenings&quot; in England during the late 1960s, Augusto Boal&#x27;s &quot;Forum Theatre&quot; in South America in the early 1970s, and San Francisco&#x27;s The Diggers&#x27; work in the 1960s. Some of this work led to pure improvisational performance styles, while others simply added to the theatrical vocabulary and were, on the whole, avant-garde experiments.

Joan Littlewood, an English actress and director who was active from the 1950s to 1960s, made extensive use of improv in developing plays for performance. However, she was successfully prosecuted twice for allowing her actors to improvise in performance. Until 1968, British law required scripts to be approved by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office. The department also sent inspectors to some performances to check that the approved script was performed exactly as approved.

In 1987, Annoyance Theatre began as a club in Chicago that emphasizes longform improvisation. The Annoyance Theatre has grown into multiple locations in Chicago and New York City. It is the home of the longest running musical improv show in history at 11 years.

In 2012, Lebanese writer and director Lucien Bourjeily used improvisational theater techniques to create a multi-sensory play entitled &quot;66 Minutes in Damascus&quot;. This play premiered at the London International Festival of Theater, and is considered one of the most extreme kinds of interactive improvised theater put on stage. The audience play the part of kidnapped tourists in today&#x27;s Syria in a hyperreal sensory environment.

Rob Wittig and Mark C. Marino have developed a form of improv for online theatrical improvisation called netprov. The form relies on social media to engage audiences in the creation of dynamic fictional scenarios that evolve in real-time.

==Comedy==

Modern improvisational comedy, as it is practiced in the West, falls generally into two categories: shortform and longform.

Shortform improv consists of short scenes usually constructed from a predetermined game, structure, or idea and driven by an audience suggestion. Many shortform exercises were first created by Viola Spolin, who called them theatre games, influenced by her training from recreational games expert Neva Boyd. The shortform improv comedy television series &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; has familiarized American and British viewers with shortform.

Longform improv performers create shows in which short scenes are often interrelated by story, characters, or themes. Longform shows may take the form of an existing type of theatre, for example a full-length play or Broadway-style musical such as Spontaneous Broadway. One of the better-known longform structures is the Harold, developed by ImprovOlympic co-founder Del Close. Many such longform structures now exist. Actors such as Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, and Steve Carrell found their start in longform improv. 

Longform improvisation is especially performed in Chicago, New York City, Los Angeles, Austin, Dallas, Boston, Minneapolis, Phoenix, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, Detroit, Toronto, Vancouver, and Washington, D.C., and is building a growing following in Baltimore, Denver, Kansas City, Montreal, Columbus, New Orleans, Omaha, Rochester, NY, and Hawaii. Outside the United States, longform improv has a growing presence in the United Kingdom, especially in cities such as London, Bristol, Glasgow, and at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

==Non-comedic, experimental, and dramatic, narrative-based improvisational theater==
Other forms of improvisational theatre training and performance techniques are experimental and avant-garde in nature and not necessarily intended to be comedic. These include Playback Theatre and Theatre of the Oppressed, the Poor Theatre, the Open Theatre, to name only a few.

The Open Theatre was founded in New York City by a group of former students of acting teacher Nola Chilton, and joined shortly thereafter by director Joseph Chaikin, formerly of The Living Theatre, and Peter Feldman. This avant-garde theatre group explored political, artistic, and social issues. The company, developing work through an improvisational process drawn from Chilton and Viola Spolin, created well-known exercises, such as &quot;sound and movement&quot; and &quot;transformations&quot;, and originated radical forms and techniques that anticipated or were contemporaneous with Jerzy Grotowski&#x27;s &quot;poor theater&quot; in Poland. During the sixties, Chaikin and the Open Theatre developed full theatrical productions with nothing but the actors, a few chairs, and a bare stage, creating character, time, and place through a series of transformations the actors physicalized and discovered through improvisations.

On the west coast, Ruth Zaporah developed Action Theatre, a physically based improvisation form that treats language, movement and voice equally. Action Theatre performances have no scripts, no preplanned ideas and create full-length shows or shorter performances. Longform, dramatic, and narrative-based improvisation is well-established on the west coast with companies such as San Francisco&#x27;s BATS Improv. This format allows for full-length plays and musicals to be created improvisationally.

==Applying improv principles in life==
Many people who have studied improv have noted that the guiding principles of improv are useful, not just on stage, but in everyday life. For example, Stephen Colbert in a commencement address said,

Tina Fey, in her book &quot;Bossypants&quot;, lists several rules of improv that apply in the workplace. There has been much interest in bringing lessons from improv into the corporate world. In a &quot;New York Times&quot; article titled &quot;Can Executives Learn to Ignore the Script?&quot;, Stanford professor and author, Patricia Ryan Madson notes, &quot;executives and engineers and people in transition are looking for support in saying yes to their own voice. Often, the systems we put in place to keep us secure are keeping us from our more creative selves.&quot;

Applying improv principles is also commonly used to enhance ideation in teams and groups.

==In film and television==
Many directors have made use of improvisation in the creation of both mainstream and experimental films. Many silent filmmakers such as Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton used improvisation in the making of their films, developing their gags while filming and altering the plot to fit. The Marx Brothers were notorious for deviating from the script they were given, their ad libs often becoming part of the standard routine and making their way into their films. Many people, however, make a distinction between ad-libbing and improvising.

The British director Mike Leigh makes extensive use of improvisation in the creation of his films, including improvising important moments in the characters&#x27; lives that will not even appear in the film. &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; and other mockumentary films of director Christopher Guest were created with a mix of scripted and unscripted material. &quot;Blue in the Face&quot; is a 1995 comedy directed by Wayne Wang and Paul Auster created in part by the improvisations during the filming of &quot;Smoke&quot;.

Some of the best known American film directors who used improvisation in their work with actors are John Cassavetes, Robert Altman, Christopher Guest, and Rob Reiner.

Improv comedy techniques have also been used in hit television shows such as HBO&#x27;s &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; created by Larry David, the UK Channel 4 and ABC television series &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway&quot; (and its spinoffs &quot;Drew Carey&#x27;s Green Screen Show&quot; and &quot;Drew Carey&#x27;s Improv-A-Ganza&quot;), Nick Cannon&#x27;s improv comedy show &quot;Wild &#x27;N Out&quot;, and &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot;. A very early American improv television program was the weekly half-hour &quot;What Happens Now?&quot; which premiered on New York&#x27;s WOR-TV on October 15, 1949, and ran for 22 episodes. &quot;The Improvisers&quot; were six actors (including Larry Blyden, Ross Martin, and Jean Alexander – Jean Pugsley at the time) who improvised skits based on situations suggested by viewers. In Canada, the series &quot;Train 48&quot; was improvised from scripts which contained a minimal outline of each scene, and the comedy series &quot;This Sitcom Is...Not to Be Repeated&quot; incorporated dialogue drawn from a hat during the course of an episode. The American show &quot;Reno 911!&quot; also contained improvised dialogue based on a plot outline. &quot;Fast and Loose&quot; is an improvisational game show, much like &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; The BBC sitcoms &quot;Outnumbered&quot; and &quot;The Thick of It&quot; also had some improvised elements in them.

==Psychology==
In the field of the psychology of consciousness, Eberhard Scheiffele explored the altered state of consciousness experienced by actors and improvisers in his scholarly paper &quot;Acting: an altered state of consciousness&quot;. According to G. William Farthing in &quot;The Psychology of Consciousness&quot; comparative study, actors routinely enter into an altered state of consciousness (ASC). Acting is seen as altering most of the 14 dimensions of changed subjective experience which characterize ASCs according to Farthing, namely: attention, perception, imagery and fantasy, inner speech, memory, higher-level thought processes, meaning or significance of experiences, time experience, emotional feeling and expression, level of arousal, self-control, suggestibility, body image, and sense of personal identity.

In the growing field of Drama Therapy, psychodramatic improvisation, along with other techniques developed for Drama Therapy, are used extensively. The &quot;&quot;Yes, and&quot;&quot; rule has been compared to Milton Erickson&#x27;s &quot;utilization&quot; process and to a variety of acceptance-based psychotherapies. Improv training has been recommended for couples therapy and therapist training, and it has been speculated that improv training may be helpful in some cases of social anxiety disorder.

==Structure and process==
Improvisational theatre often allows an interactive relationship with the audience. Improv groups frequently solicit suggestions from the audience as a source of inspiration, a way of getting the audience involved, and as a means of proving that the performance is not scripted. That charge is sometimes aimed at the masters of the art, whose performances can seem so detailed that viewers may suspect the scenes are planned.

In order for an improvised scene to be successful, the improvisers involved must work together responsively to define the parameters and action of the scene, in a process of co-creation. With each spoken word or action in the scene, an improviser makes an &quot;offer&quot;, meaning that he or she defines some element of the reality of the scene. This might include giving another character a name, identifying a relationship, location, or using mime to define the physical environment. These activities are also known as &quot;endowment&quot;. It is the responsibility of the other improvisers to accept the offers that their fellow performers make; to not do so is known as blocking, negation, or denial, which usually prevents the scene from developing. Some performers may deliberately block (or otherwise break out of character) for comedic effect—this is known as &quot;gagging&quot;—but this generally prevents the scene from advancing and is frowned upon by many improvisers. Accepting an offer is usually accompanied by adding a new offer, often building on the earlier one; this is a process improvisers refer to as &quot;Yes, and...&quot; and is considered the cornerstone of improvisational technique. Every new piece of information added helps the improvisers to refine their characters and progress the action of the scene. The &quot;Yes, and...&quot; rule, however, applies to a scene&#x27;s early stage since it is in this stage that a &quot;base (or shared) reality&quot; is established in order to be later redefined by applying the &quot;if (this is true), then (what else can also be true)&quot; practice progressing the scene into comedy, as explained in the 2013 manual by the &quot;Upright Citizens Brigade&quot; members.

The unscripted nature of improv also implies no predetermined knowledge about the props that might be useful in a scene. Improv companies may have at their disposal some number of readily accessible props that can be called upon at a moment&#x27;s notice, but many improvisers eschew props in favor of the infinite possibilities available through mime. In improv, this is more commonly known as &#x27;space object work&#x27; or &#x27;space work&#x27;, rather than &#x27;mime&#x27;, and the props and locations created by this technique, as &#x27;space objects&#x27; created out of &#x27;space substance&#x27;, developed as a technique by Viola Spolin. As with all improv &#x27;offers&#x27;, improvisers are encouraged to respect the validity and continuity of the imaginary environment defined by themselves and their fellow performers; this means, for example, taking care not to walk through the table or &quot;miraculously&quot; survive multiple bullet wounds from another improviser&#x27;s gun.

Because improvisers may be required to play a variety of roles without preparation, they need to be able to construct characters quickly with physicality, gestures, accents, voice changes, or other techniques as demanded by the situation. The improviser may be called upon to play a character of a different age or sex. Character motivations are an important part of successful improv scenes, and improvisers must therefore attempt to act according to the objectives that they believe their character seeks.

In improv formats with multiple scenes, an agreed-upon signal is used to denote scene changes. Most often, this takes the form of a performer running in front of the scene, known as a &quot;wipe&quot;. Tapping a character in or out can also be employed. The performers not currently part of the scene often stand at the side or back of the stage, and can enter or exit the scene by stepping into or out of the stage center.

==Community==
Many theatre troupes are devoted to staging improvisational performances and growing the improv community through their training centers.

In addition to for-profit theatre troupes, there are many college-based improv groups in the United States and around the world.

In Europe the special contribution to the theatre of the abstract, the surreal, the irrational and the subconscious have been part of the stage tradition for centuries. From the 1990s onwards a growing number of European Improv groups have been set up specifically to explore the possibilities offered by the use of the abstract in improvised performance, including dance, movement, sound, music, mask work, lighting, and so on. These groups are not especially interested in comedy, either as a technique or as an effect, but rather in expanding the improv genre so as to incorporate techniques and approaches that have long been a legitimate part of European theatre.

==Notable contributors to the field==

The Brave New Workshop Comedy Theater (BNW), is a sketch and improvisational comedy theater based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Started by Dudley Riggs in 1958, the artists of the BNW have been writing, performing and producing live sketch comedy and improvisation performances for 62 years – longer than any other theater in the nation. Notable alumni of the BNW include Louie Anderson, Mo Collins, Tom Davis, Al Franken, Penn Jillette, Carl Lumbly, Paul Menzel, Pat Proft, Annie Reirson, Taylor Nikolai, Nancy Steen, Peter Tolan, Linda Wallem, Lizz Winstead, Peter MacNicol, Melissa Peterman, and Cedric Yarbrough.

Some key figures in the development of improvisational theatre are Viola Spolin and her son Paul Sills, founder of Chicago&#x27;s famed Second City troupe and originator of Theater Games, and Del Close, founder of ImprovOlympic (along with Charna Halpern) and creator of a popular longform improv format known as The Harold. Others include Keith Johnstone, the British teacher and writer–author of &quot;Impro&quot;, who founded the Theatre Machine and whose teachings form the foundation of the popular shortform Theatresports format, Dick Chudnow, founder of ComedySportz which evolved its family-friendly show format from Johnstone&#x27;s Theatersports, and Bill Johnson, creator/director of The Magic Meathands, who pioneered the concept of &quot;Commun-edy Outreach&quot; by tailoring performances to non-traditional audiences, such as the homeless and foster children.

David Shepherd, with Paul Sills, founded The Compass Players in Chicago. Shepherd was intent on developing a true &quot;people&#x27;s Theatre&quot;, and hoped to bring political drama to the stockyards. The Compass went on to play in numerous forms and companies, in a number of cities including New York and Hyannis, after the founding of The Second City. A number of Compass members were also founding members of The Second City. In the 1970s, Shepherd began experimenting with group-created videos. He is the author of &quot;That Movie In Your Head&quot;, about these efforts. In the 1970s, David Shepherd and Howard Jerome created the Improvisational Olympics, a format for competition based improv. The Improv Olympics were first demonstrated at Toronto&#x27;s Homemade Theatre in 1976 and have been continued on as the Canadian Improv Games. In the United States, the Improv Olympics were later produced by Charna Halpern under the name &quot;ImprovOlympic&quot; and now as &quot;IO&quot;; IO operates training centers and theaters in Chicago and Los Angeles. At IO, Halpern combined Shepherd&#x27;s &quot;Time Dash&quot; game with Del Close&#x27;s &quot;Harold&quot; game; the revised format for the Harold became the fundamental structure for the development of modern longform improvisation.

In 1975 Jonathan Fox founded Playback Theatre, a form of improvised community theatre which is often not comedic and replays stories as shared by members of the audience.

The Groundlings is a popular and influential improv theatre and training center in Los Angeles, California. The late Gary Austin, founder of The Groundlings, taught improvisation around the country, focusing especially in Los Angeles. He was widely acclaimed as one of the greatest acting teachers in America. His work was grounded in the lessons he learned as an improviser at The Committee with Del Close, as well as in his experiences as founding director of The Groundlings. The Groundlings is often seen as the Los Angeles training ground for the &quot;second generation&quot; of improv performers and troupes. Stan Wells developed the &quot;Clap-In&quot; style of longform improvisation here, later using this as the basis for his own theatre, The Empty Stage, which in turn bred multiple troupes utilizing this style.

In the late 1990s, Matt Besser, Amy Poehler, Ian Roberts, and Matt Walsh founded the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York and later they founded one in Los Angeles, each with an accompanying improv/sketch comedy school. In September 2011 the UCB opened a third theatre in New York City&#x27;s East Village, known as UCBeast.

Hoopla Impro are the founders of the UK and London&#x27;s first improv theatre. They also run an annual UK improv festival and improv marathon.

In 2015, The Free Association opened in London as a counterpart to American improv schools.

In 2016, The Glasgow Improv Theatre started putting on shows and teaching classes in Glasgow, growing the improv scene in Scotland.

Gunter Lösel compared the existing improvisational theater theories (including Moreno, Spolin, Johnstone, and Close), structured them and wrote a general theory of improvisational theater.

Alan Alda&#x27;s book &quot;If I Understood You, Would I Have This Look on My Face?&quot; investigates the way in which improvisation improves communication in the sciences. The book is based on his work at Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science at Stony Brook University. The book has many examples of how improvisational theater games can increase communication skills and develop empathy.

<text>The International Space Station (ISS) is a large space station that was assembled and is maintained in low Earth orbit by a collaboration of five space agencies and their contractors: NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia), ESA (Europe), JAXA (Japan), and CSA (Canada). As the largest space station ever constructed, it primarily serves as a platform for conducting scientific experiments in microgravity and studying the space environment.

The station is divided into two main sections: the Russian Orbital Segment (ROS), developed by Roscosmos, and the US Orbital Segment (USOS), built by NASA, ESA, JAXA, and CSA. A striking feature of the ISS is the Integrated Truss Structure, which connect the station’s vast system of solar panels and radiators to its pressurized modules. These modules support diverse functions, including scientific research, crew habitation, storage, spacecraft control, and airlock operations. The ISS has eight docking and berthing ports for visiting spacecraft. The station orbits the Earth at an average altitude of and circles the Earth in roughly 93 minutes, completing orbits per day.

The ISS programme combines two previously planned crewed Earth-orbiting stations: the United States&#x27; Space Station &quot;Freedom&quot; and the Soviet Union&#x27;s&quot; Mir-2&quot;. The first ISS module was launched in 1998, with major components delivered by Proton and Soyuz rockets and the Space Shuttle. Long-term occupancy began on 2 November 2000, with the arrival of the Expedition 1 crew. Since then, the ISS has remained continuously inhabited for , the longest continuous human presence in space. , 279 individuals from 22 countries had visited the station.

Future plans for the ISS include the addition of at least one module, Axiom Space&#x27;s Payload Power Thermal Module. The station is expected to remain operational until the end of 2030, after which it will be de-orbited using a dedicated NASA spacecraft.

== Conception ==
==Purpose==
The ISS was originally intended to be a laboratory, observatory, and factory while providing transportation, maintenance, and a low Earth orbit staging base for possible future missions to the Moon, Mars, and asteroids. However, not all of the uses envisioned in the initial memorandum of understanding between NASA and Roscosmos have been realised. In the 2010 United States National Space Policy, the ISS was given additional roles of serving commercial, diplomatic, and educational purposes.

===Scientific research===


The ISS provides a platform to conduct scientific research, with power, data, cooling, and crew available to support experiments. Small uncrewed spacecraft can also provide platforms for experiments, especially those involving zero gravity and exposure to space, but space stations offer a long-term environment where studies can be performed potentially for decades, combined with ready access by human researchers.

The ISS simplifies individual experiments by allowing groups of experiments to share the same launches and crew time. Research is conducted in a wide variety of fields, including astrobiology, astronomy, physical sciences, materials science, space weather, meteorology, and human research including space medicine and the life sciences. Scientists on Earth have timely access to the data and can suggest experimental modifications to the crew. If follow-on experiments are necessary, the routinely scheduled launches of resupply craft allows new hardware to be launched with relative ease. Crews fly expeditions of several months&#x27; duration, providing approximately 160 man-hours per week of labour with a crew of six. However, a considerable amount of crew time is taken up by station maintenance.

Perhaps the most notable ISS experiment is the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS), which is intended to detect dark matter and answer other fundamental questions about our universe. According to NASA, the AMS is as important as the Hubble Space Telescope. Currently docked on station, it could not have been easily accommodated on a free flying satellite platform because of its power and bandwidth needs. On 3 April 2013, scientists reported that hints of dark matter may have been detected by the AMS. According to the scientists, &quot;The first results from the space-borne Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer confirm an unexplained excess of high-energy positrons in Earth-bound cosmic rays&quot;.

The space environment is hostile to life. Unprotected presence in space is characterised by an intense radiation field (consisting primarily of protons and other subatomic charged particles from the solar wind, in addition to cosmic rays), high vacuum, extreme temperatures, and microgravity. Some simple forms of life called extremophiles, as well as small invertebrates called tardigrades can survive in this environment in an extremely dry state through desiccation.

Medical research improves knowledge about the effects of long-term space exposure on the human body, including muscle atrophy, bone loss, and fluid shift. These data will be used to determine whether high duration human spaceflight and space colonisation are feasible. In 2006, data on bone loss and muscular atrophy suggested that there would be a significant risk of fractures and movement problems if astronauts landed on a planet after a lengthy interplanetary cruise, such as the six-month interval required to travel to Mars.

Medical studies are conducted aboard the ISS on behalf of the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI). Prominent among these is the Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity study in which astronauts perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts. The study considers the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions in space. Usually, there is no physician on board the ISS and diagnosis of medical conditions is a challenge. It is anticipated that remotely guided ultrasound scans will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is difficult.

In August 2020, scientists reported that bacteria from Earth, particularly &quot;Deinococcus radiodurans&quot; bacteria, which is highly resistant to environmental hazards, were found to survive for three years in outer space, based on studies conducted on the International Space Station. These findings supported the notion of panspermia, the hypothesis that life exists throughout the Universe, distributed in various ways, including space dust, meteoroids, asteroids, comets, planetoids or contaminated spacecraft.

Remote sensing of the Earth, astronomy, and deep space research on the ISS have significantly increased during the 2010s after the completion of the US Orbital Segment in 2011. Throughout the more than 20 years of the ISS program, researchers aboard the ISS and on the ground have examined aerosols, ozone, lightning, and oxides in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, as well as the Sun, cosmic rays, cosmic dust, antimatter, and dark matter in the universe. Examples of Earth-viewing remote sensing experiments that have flown on the ISS are the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3, ISS-RapidScat, ECOSTRESS, the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation, and the Cloud Aerosol Transport System. ISS-based astronomy telescopes and experiments include SOLAR, the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer, the Calorimetric Electron Telescope, the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI), and the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer.

====Freefall====

Gravity at the altitude of the ISS is approximately 90% as strong as at Earth&#x27;s surface, but objects in orbit are in a continuous state of freefall, resulting in an apparent state of weightlessness. This perceived weightlessness is disturbed by five effects:
* Drag from the residual atmosphere.
* Vibration from the movements of mechanical systems and the crew.
* Actuation of the on-board attitude control moment gyroscopes.
* Thruster firings for attitude or orbital changes.
* Gravity-gradient effects, also known as tidal effects. Items at different locations within the ISS would, if not attached to the station, follow slightly different orbits. Being mechanically connected, these items experience small forces that keep the station moving as a rigid body.

Researchers are investigating the effect of the station&#x27;s near-weightless environment on the evolution, development, growth and internal processes of plants and animals. In response to some of the data, NASA wants to investigate microgravity&#x27;s effects on the growth of three-dimensional, human-like tissues and the unusual protein crystals that can be formed in space.

Investigating the physics of fluids in microgravity will provide better models of the behaviour of fluids. Because fluids can be almost completely combined in microgravity, physicists investigate fluids that do not mix well on Earth. Examining reactions that are slowed by low gravity and low temperatures will improve our understanding of superconductivity.

The study of materials science is an important ISS research activity, with the objective of reaping economic benefits through the improvement of techniques used on Earth. Other areas of interest include the effect of low gravity on combustion, through the study of the efficiency of burning and control of emissions and pollutants. These findings may improve knowledge about energy production and lead to economic and environmental benefits.

===Exploration===
The ISS provides a location in the relative safety of low Earth orbit to test spacecraft systems that will be required for long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars. This provides experience in operations, maintenance, and repair and replacement activities on-orbit. This will help develop essential skills in operating spacecraft farther from Earth, reduce mission risks, and advance the capabilities of interplanetary spacecraft. Referring to the MARS-500 experiment, a crew isolation experiment conducted on Earth, ESA states, &quot;Whereas the ISS is essential for answering questions concerning the possible impact of weightlessness, radiation and other space-specific factors, aspects such as the effect of long-term isolation and confinement can be more appropriately addressed via ground-based simulations&quot;. Sergey Krasnov, the head of human space flight programmes for Russia&#x27;s space agency, Roscosmos, in 2011 suggested a &quot;shorter version&quot; of MARS-500 may be carried out on the ISS.

In 2009, noting the value of the partnership framework itself, Sergey Krasnov wrote, &quot;When compared with partners acting separately, partners developing complementary abilities and resources could give us much more assurance of the success and safety of space exploration. The ISS is helping further advance near-Earth space exploration and realisation of prospective programmes of research and exploration of the Solar system, including the Moon and Mars.&quot; A crewed mission to Mars may be a multinational effort involving space agencies and countries outside the current ISS partnership. In 2010, ESA Director-General Jean-Jacques Dordain stated his agency was ready to propose to the other four partners that China, India, and South Korea be invited to join the ISS partnership. NASA chief Charles Bolden stated in February 2011, &quot;Any mission to Mars is likely to be a global effort.&quot; Currently, US federal legislation prevents NASA co-operation with China on space projects without approval by the FBI and Congress.

===Education and cultural outreach===
The ISS crew provides opportunities for students on Earth by running student-developed experiments, making educational demonstrations, allowing for student participation in classroom versions of ISS experiments, and directly engaging students using radio, and email. ESA offers a wide range of free teaching materials that can be downloaded for use in classrooms. In one lesson, students can navigate a 3D model of the interior and exterior of the ISS, and face spontaneous challenges to solve in real time.

The Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) aims to inspire children to &quot;pursue craftsmanship&quot; and to heighten their &quot;awareness of the importance of life and their responsibilities in society&quot;. Through a series of education guides, students develop a deeper understanding of the past and near-term future of crewed space flight, as well as that of Earth and life. In the JAXA &quot;Seeds in Space&quot; experiments, the mutation effects of spaceflight on plant seeds aboard the ISS are explored by growing sunflower seeds that have flown on the ISS for about nine months. In the first phase of &quot;Kibō&quot; utilisation from 2008 to mid-2010, researchers from more than a dozen Japanese universities conducted experiments in diverse fields.

Cultural activities are another major objective of the ISS programme. Tetsuo Tanaka, the director of JAXA&#x27;s Space Environment and Utilization Center, has said: &quot;There is something about space that touches even people who are not interested in science.&quot;

Amateur Radio on the ISS (ARISS) is a volunteer programme that encourages students worldwide to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, through amateur radio communications opportunities with the ISS crew. ARISS is an international working group, consisting of delegations from nine countries including several in Europe, as well as Japan, Russia, Canada, and the United States. In areas where radio equipment cannot be used, speakerphones connect students to ground stations which then connect the calls to the space station.

&quot;First Orbit&quot; is a 2011 feature-length documentary film about Vostok 1, the first crewed space flight around the Earth. By matching the orbit of the ISS to that of Vostok 1 as closely as possible, in terms of ground path and time of day, documentary filmmaker Christopher Riley and ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli were able to film the view that Yuri Gagarin saw on his pioneering orbital space flight. This new footage was cut together with the original Vostok 1 mission audio recordings sourced from the Russian State Archive. Nespoli is credited as the director of photography for this documentary film, as he recorded the majority of the footage himself during Expedition 26/27. The film was streamed in a global YouTube premiere in 2011 under a free licence through the website &quot;firstorbit.org&quot;.

In May 2013, commander Chris Hadfield shot a music video of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Space Oddity&quot; on board the station, which was released on YouTube. It was the first music video filmed in space.

In November 2017, while participating in Expedition 52/53 on the ISS, Paolo Nespoli made two recordings of his spoken voice (one in English and the other in his native Italian), for use on Wikipedia articles. These were the first content made in space specifically for Wikipedia.

In November 2021, a virtual reality exhibit called The Infinite featuring life aboard the ISS was announced.

==Construction==
===Manufacturing===

The International Space Station is a product of global collaboration, with its components manufactured across the world.

The modules of the Russian Orbital Segment, including &quot;Zarya&quot; and &quot;Zvezda&quot;, were produced at the Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center in Moscow. &quot;Zvezda&quot; was initially manufactured in 1985 as a component for the &quot;Mir-2&quot; space station, which was never launched.

Much of the US Orbital Segment, including the &quot;Destiny&quot; and &quot;Unity&quot; modules, the Integrated Truss Structure, and solar arrays, were built at NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama and Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. These components underwent final assembly and processing for launch at the Operations and Checkout Building and the Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF) at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

The US Orbital Segment also hosts the &quot;Columbus&quot; module contributed by the European Space Agency and built in Germany, the &quot;Kibō&quot; module contributed by Japan and built at the Tsukuba Space Center and the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, along with the Canadarm2 and Dextre, a joint Canadian-U.S. endeavor. All of these components were shipped to the SSPF for launch processing.

===Assembly===
The assembly of the International Space Station, a major endeavour in space architecture, began in November 1998.

Modules in the Russian segment launched and docked autonomously, with the exception of &quot;Rassvet&quot;. Other modules and components were delivered by the Space Shuttle, which then had to be installed by astronauts either remotely using robotic arms or during spacewalks, more formally known as extra-vehicular activities (EVAs). By 5 June 2011 astronauts had made over 159 EVAs to add components to the station, totaling more than 1,000 hours in space.

The foundation for the ISS was laid with the launch of the Russian-built &quot;Zarya&quot; module atop a Proton rocket on 20 November 1998. &quot;Zarya&quot; provided propulsion, attitude control, communications, and electrical power. Two weeks later on 4 December 1998, the American-made &quot;Unity&quot; was ferried aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; on STS-88 and joined with &quot;Zarya&quot;. &quot;Unity&quot; provided the connection between the Russian and US segments of the station and would provide ports to connect future modules and visiting spacecraft.

While the connection of two modules built on different continents, by nations that were once bitter rivals was a significant milestone, these two initial modules lacked life support systems and the ISS remained unmanned for the next two years. At the time, the Russian station &quot;Mir&quot; was still inhabited.

The turning point arrived in July 2000 with the launch of the &quot;Zvezda&quot; module. Equipped with living quarters and life-support systems, &quot;Zvezda&quot; enabled continuous human presence aboard the station. The first crew, Expedition 1, arrived that November aboard Soyuz TM-31.

The ISS grew steadily over the following years, with modules delivered by both Russian rockets and the Space Shuttle.

Expedition 1 arrived midway between the Space Shuttle flights of missions STS-92 and STS-97. These two flights each added segments of the station&#x27;s Integrated Truss Structure, which provided the station with Ku band communications, additional attitude control needed for the additional mass of the USOS, and additional solar arrays. Over the next two years, the station continued to expand. A Soyuz-U rocket delivered the &quot;Pirs&quot; docking compartment. The Space Shuttles &quot;Discovery&quot;, &quot;Atlantis&quot;, and &quot;Endeavour&quot; delivered the American &quot;Destiny&quot; laboratory and &quot;Quest&quot; airlock, in addition to the station&#x27;s main robot arm, the Canadarm2, and several more segments of the Integrated Truss Structure.

Tragedy struck in 2003 with the loss of the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;, which grounded the rest of the Shuttle fleet, halting construction of the ISS.Assembly resumed in 2006 with the arrival of STS-115 with &quot;Atlantis&quot;, which delivered the station&#x27;s second set of solar arrays. Several more truss segments and a third set of arrays were delivered on STS-116, STS-117, and STS-118. As a result of the major expansion of the station&#x27;s power-generating capabilities, more modules could be accommodated, and the US &quot;Harmony&quot; module and &quot;Columbus&quot; European laboratory were added. These were soon followed by the first two components of the Japanese &quot;Kibō&quot; laboratory. In March 2009, STS-119 completed the Integrated Truss Structure with the installation of the fourth and final set of solar arrays. The final section of &quot;Kibō&quot; was delivered in July 2009 on STS-127, followed by the Russian &quot;Poisk&quot; module. The US &quot;Tranquility&quot; module was delivered in February 2010 during STS-130, alongside the &quot;Cupola&quot;, followed by the penultimate Russian module, &quot;Rassvet&quot;, in May 2010. &quot;Rassvet&quot; was delivered by Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; on STS-132 in exchange for the Russian Proton delivery of the US-funded &quot;Zarya&quot; module in 1998. The last pressurised module of the USOS, &quot;Leonardo&quot;, was brought to the station in February 2011 on the final flight of &quot;Discovery&quot;, STS-133.

Russia&#x27;s new primary research module &quot;Nauka&quot; docked in July 2021, along with the European Robotic Arm which can relocate itself to different parts of the Russian modules of the station. Russia&#x27;s latest addition, the &quot;Prichal&quot; module, docked in November 2021.

As of February 2025, nasa.gov states that there are 43 different modules and elements installed on the ISS. https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/international-space-station-assembly-elements/

==Structure==
The ISS functions as a modular space station, enabling the addition or removal of modules from its structure for increased adaptability.

Below is a diagram of major station components. The &quot;Unity&quot; node joins directly to the &quot;Destiny&quot; laboratory; for clarity, they are shown apart. Similar cases are also seen in other parts of the structure.

Key to box background colors:
* Pressurised component, accessible by the crew without using spacesuits
* Docking/berthing port, pressurized when a visiting spacecraft is present
* Airlock, to move people or material between pressurized and unpressurized environment
* Unpressurised station superstructure 
* Unpressurised component
* Temporarily defunct or non-commissioned component
* Former, no longer installed component
* Future, not yet installed component

















=== Pressurised modules ===
==== &quot;Zarya&quot; ====

&quot;Zarya&quot; (), also known as the &quot;Functional Cargo Block&quot; (), was the inaugural component of the ISS. Launched in 1998, it initially served as the ISS&#x27;s power source, storage, propulsion, and guidance system. As the station has grown, &quot;Zarya&quot;&#x27;s role has transitioned primarily to storage, both internally and in its external fuel tanks.

A descendant of the TKS spacecraft used in the &quot;Salyut&quot; programme, &quot;Zarya&quot; was built in Russia but is owned by the United States. Its name symbolizes the beginning of a new era of international space cooperation.

==== &quot;Unity&quot; ====

&quot;Unity&quot;, also known as &quot;Node 1&quot;, is the inaugural U.S.-built component of the ISS. Serving as the connection between the Russian and U.S. segments, this cylindrical module features six Common Berthing Mechanism locations (forward, aft, port, starboard, zenith, and nadir) for attaching additional modules. Measuring in diameter and in length, &quot;Unity&quot; was constructed of steel by Boeing for NASA at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. It was the first of three connecting nodes – &quot;Unity&quot;, &quot;Harmony&quot;, and &quot;Tranquility&quot; – that forms the structural backbone of the U.S. segment of the ISS.

==== &quot;Zvezda&quot; ====

&quot;Zvezda&quot; () launched in July 2000, is the core of the Russian Orbital Segment of the ISS. Initially providing essential living quarters and life support systems, it enabled the first continuous human presence aboard the station. While additional modules have expanded the ISS&#x27;s capabilities, Zvezda remains the command and control center for the Russian segment and it is where crews gather during emergencies.

A descendant of the Salyut programme&#x27;s DOS spacecraft, Zvezda was built by RKK Energia and launched atop a Proton rocket.

==== &quot;Destiny&quot; ====

The &quot;Destiny&quot; laboratory is the primary research facility for U.S. experiments on the ISS. NASA&#x27;s first permanent orbital research station since Skylab, the module was built by Boeing and launched aboard during STS-98. Attached to &quot;Unity&quot; over a period of five days in February 2001, &quot;Destiny&quot; has been a hub for scientific research ever since.

Within &quot;Destiny&quot;, astronauts conduct experiments in fields such as medicine, engineering, biotechnology, physics, materials science, and Earth science. Researchers worldwide benefit from these studies. The module also houses life support systems, including the Oxygen Generating System.

==== &quot;Quest Joint Airlock&quot; ====

The &quot;Quest Joint Airlock&quot; enables extravehicular activities (EVAs) using either the U.S. Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) or the Russian Orlan space suit.

Before its installation, conducting EVAs from the ISS was challenging due to a variety of system and design differences. Only the Orlan suit could be used from the Transfer Chamber on the &quot;Zvezda&quot; module (which was not a purpose-built airlock) and the EMU could only be used from the airlock on a visiting Space Shuttle, which could not accommodate the Orlan.

Launched aboard during STS-104 in July 2001 and attached to the Unity module, Quest is a , structure built by Boeing. It houses the crew airlock for astronaut egress, an equipment airlock for suit storage, and has facilities to accommodate astronauts during their overnight pre-breathe procedures to prevent decompression sickness.

The crew airlock, derived from the Space Shuttle, features essential equipment like lighting, handrails, and an Umbilical Interface Assembly (UIA) that provides life support and communication systems for up to two spacesuits simultaneously. These can be either two EMUs, two Orlan suits, or one of each design.

==== &quot;Poisk&quot; ====
&quot;Poisk&quot; (), also known as the &quot;Mini-Research Module 2&quot; (), serves as both a secondary airlock on the Russian segment of the ISS and supports docking for Soyuz and Progress spacecraft, facilitates propellant transfers from the latter. Launched on 10 November 2009 attached to a modified Progress spacecraft, called Progress M-MIM2.

&quot;Poisk&quot; provides facilities to maintain Orlan spacesuits and is equipped with two inward-opening hatches, a design change from &quot;Mir&quot;, which encountered a dangerous situation caused by an outward-opening hatch that opened too quickly because of a small amount of air pressure remaining in the airlock. Since the departure of &quot;Pirs&quot; in 2021, it&#x27;s become the sole airlock on the Russian segment.

==== &quot;Harmony&quot; ====

&quot;Harmony&quot;, or &quot;Node 2&quot;, is the central connecting hub of the US segment of the ISS, linking the U.S., European, and Japanese laboratory modules. It&#x27;s also been called the &quot;utility hub&quot; of the ISS as it provides essential power, data, and life support systems. The module also houses sleeping quarters for four crew members.

Launched on 23 October 2007 aboard on STS-120, Harmony was initially attached to the Unity before being relocated to its permanent position at the front of the Destiny laboratory on 14 November 2007. This expansion added significant living space to the ISS, marking a key milestone in the construction of the U.S. segment.

==== &quot;Tranquility&quot; ====

&quot;Tranquility&quot;, also known as &quot;Node 3&quot;, is a module of the ISS. It contains environmental control systems, life support systems, a toilet, exercise equipment, and an observation cupola.

The European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency had &quot;Tranquility&quot; manufactured by Thales Alenia Space. A ceremony on 20 November 2009 transferred ownership of the module to NASA. On 8 February 2010, NASA launched the module on the Space Shuttle&#x27;s STS-130 mission.

==== &quot;Columbus&quot; ====

&quot;Columbus&quot; is a science laboratory that is part of the ISS and is the largest single contribution to the station made by the European Space Agency.

Like the &quot;Harmony&quot; and &quot;Tranquility&quot; modules, the &quot;Columbus&quot; laboratory was constructed in Turin, Italy by Thales Alenia Space. The functional equipment and software of the lab was designed by EADS in Bremen, Germany. It was also integrated in Bremen before being flown to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in an Airbus Beluga jet. It was launched aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; on 7 February 2008, on flight STS-122. It is designed for ten years of operation. The module is controlled by the Columbus Control Centre, located at the German Space Operations Center, part of the German Aerospace Center in Oberpfaffenhofen near Munich, Germany.

The European Space Agency has spent €1.4 billion (about US$1.6 billion) on building &quot;Columbus&quot;, including the experiments it carries and the ground control infrastructure necessary to operate them.

==== &quot;Kibō&quot; ====

, also known as the &quot;Japanese Experiment Module&quot;, is Japan&#x27;s research facility on the ISS. It is the largest single module on the ISS, consisting of a pressurized lab, an exposed facility for conducting experiments in the space environment, two storage compartments, and a robotic arm. Attached to the &quot;Harmony&quot; module, &quot;Kibō&quot; was assembled in space over three Space Shuttle missions: STS-123, STS-124 and STS-127.

==== &quot;Cupola&quot; ====

The &quot;Cupola&quot; is an ESA-built observatory module of the ISS. Its name derives from the Italian word &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;dome&quot;. Its seven windows are used to conduct experiments, dockings and observations of Earth. It was launched aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-130 on 8 February 2010 and attached to the &quot;Tranquility&quot; (Node 3) module. With the &quot;Cupola&quot; attached, ISS assembly reached 85 per cent completion. The &quot;Cupola&quot; central window has a diameter of .

==== &quot;Rassvet&quot; ====

&quot;Rassvet&quot; (), also known as the &quot;Mini-Research Module 1&quot; () and formerly known as the &quot;Docking Cargo Module&quot; is primarily used for cargo storage and as a docking port for visiting spacecraft on the Russian segment of the ISS. &quot;Rassvet&quot; replaced the cancelled Docking and Storage Module and used a design largely based on the &quot;Mir Docking Module&quot; built in 1995.

Rassvet was delivered in on 14 May 2010 on STS-132 in exchange for the Russian Proton delivery of the US-funded &quot;Zarya&quot; module in 1998. &quot;Rassvet&quot; was attached to &quot;Zarya&quot; shortly thereafter.

==== &quot;Leonardo&quot; ====
The &quot;Leonardo&quot; Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM) is a module of the International Space Station. It was flown into space aboard the Space Shuttle on STS-133 on 24 February 2011 and installed on 1 March. &quot;Leonardo&quot; is primarily used for storage of spares, supplies and waste on the ISS, which was until then stored in many different places within the space station. It is also the personal hygiene area for the astronauts who live in the US Orbital Segment. The &quot;Leonardo&quot; PMM was a Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) before 2011, but was modified into its current configuration. It was formerly one of two MPLM used for bringing cargo to and from the ISS with the Space Shuttle. The module was named for Italian polymath Leonardo da Vinci.

==== Bigelow Expandable Activity Module ====
The Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM) is an experimental expandable space station module developed by Bigelow Aerospace, under contract to NASA, for testing as a temporary module on the International Space Station (ISS) from 2016 to at least 2020. It arrived at the ISS on 10 April 2016, was berthed to the station on 16 April at Tranquility Node 3, and was expanded and pressurized on 28 May 2016. In December 2021, Bigelow Aerospace conveyed ownership of the module to NASA, as a result of Bigelow&#x27;s cessation of activity.

==== International Docking Adapters ====
The International Docking Adapter (IDA) is a spacecraft docking system adapter developed to convert APAS-95 to the NASA Docking System (NDS). An IDA is placed on each of the ISS&#x27;s two open Pressurized Mating Adapters (PMAs), both of which are connected to the &quot;Harmony&quot; module.

Two International Docking Adapters are currently installed aboard the Station. Originally, IDA-1 was planned to be installed on PMA-2, located at &quot;Harmony&quot;&#x27;s forward port, and IDA-2 would be installed on PMA-3 at &quot;Harmony&quot;&#x27;s zenith. After IDA 1 was destroyed in a launch incident, IDA-2 was installed on PMA-2 on 19 August 2016, while IDA-3 was later installed on PMA-3 on 21 August 2019.

==== Bishop Airlock Module ====

The NanoRacks Bishop Airlock Module is a commercially funded airlock module launched to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-21 on 6 December 2020. The module was built by NanoRacks, Thales Alenia Space, and Boeing. It will be used to deploy CubeSats, small satellites, and other external payloads for NASA, CASIS, and other commercial and governmental customers.

==== &quot;Nauka&quot; ====


&quot;Nauka&quot; (), also known as the &quot;Multipurpose Laboratory Module, Upgrade&quot; (), is a Roscosmos-funded component of the ISS that was launched on 21 July 2021, 14:58 UTC. In the original ISS plans, &quot;Nauka&quot; was to use the location of the Docking and Stowage Module (DSM), but the DSM was later replaced by the &quot;Rassvet&quot; module and moved to &quot;Zarya&quot;″s nadir port. &quot;Nauka&quot; was successfully docked to &quot;Zvezda&quot;″s nadir port on 29 July 2021, 13:29 UTC, replacing the &quot;Pirs&quot; module.

It had a temporary docking adapter on its nadir port for crewed and uncrewed missions until Prichal arrival, where just before its arrival it was removed by a departing Progress spacecraft.

==== &quot;Prichal&quot; ====

&quot;Prichal&quot; () is a spherical module that serves as a docking hub for the Russian segment of the ISS. Launched in November 2021, Prichal provides additional docking ports for Soyuz and Progress spacecraft, as well as potential future modules. &quot;Prichal&quot; features six docking ports: forward, aft, port, starboard, zenith, and nadir. One of these ports, equipped with an active hybrid docking system, enabled it to dock with the Nauka module. The remaining five ports are passive hybrids, allowing for docking of Soyuz, Progress, and heavier modules, as well as future spacecraft with modified docking systems. As of 2024, the forward, aft, port and starboard docking ports remain covered. &quot;Prichal&quot; was initially intended to be an element of the now canceled Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex.

===Unpressurised elements===
The ISS has a large number of external components that do not require pressurisation. The largest of these is the Integrated Truss Structure (ITS), to which the station&#x27;s main solar arrays and thermal radiators are mounted. The ITS consists of ten separate segments forming a structure long.

The station was intended to have several smaller external components, such as six robotic arms, three External Stowage Platforms (ESPs) and four ExPRESS Logistics Carriers (ELCs). While these platforms allow experiments (including MISSE, the STP-H3 and the Robotic Refueling Mission) to be deployed and conducted in the vacuum of space by providing electricity and processing experimental data locally, their primary function is to store spare Orbital Replacement Units (ORUs). ORUs are parts that can be replaced when they fail or pass their design life, including pumps, storage tanks, antennas, and battery units. Such units are replaced either by astronauts during EVA or by robotic arms. Several shuttle missions were dedicated to the delivery of ORUs, including STS-129, STS-133 and STS-134. , only one other mode of transportation of ORUs had been usedthe Japanese cargo vessel HTV-2which delivered an FHRC and CTC-2 via its Exposed Pallet (EP).

There are also smaller exposure facilities mounted directly to laboratory modules; the &quot;Kibō&quot; Exposed Facility serves as an external &quot;porch&quot; for the &quot;Kibō&quot; complex, and a facility on the European &quot;Columbus&quot; laboratory provides power and data connections for experiments such as the European Technology Exposure Facility and the Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space. A remote sensing instrument, SAGE III-ISS, was delivered to the station in February 2017 aboard CRS-10, and the NICER experiment was delivered aboard CRS-11 in June 2017. The largest scientific payload externally mounted to the ISS is the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS), a particle physics experiment launched on STS-134 in May 2011, and mounted externally on the ITS. The AMS measures cosmic rays to look for evidence of dark matter and antimatter.

The commercial &quot;Bartolomeo&quot; External Payload Hosting Platform, manufactured by Airbus, was launched on 6 March 2020 aboard CRS-20 and attached to the European &quot;Columbus&quot; module. It will provide an additional 12 external payload slots, supplementing the eight on the ExPRESS Logistics Carriers, ten on &quot;Kibō&quot;, and four on &quot;Columbus&quot;. The system is designed to be robotically serviced and will require no astronaut intervention. It is named after Christopher Columbus&#x27;s younger brother.

====MLM outfittings====

In May 2010, equipment for &quot;Nauka&quot; was launched on STS-132 (as part of an agreement with NASA) and delivered by Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Weighing 1.4 metric tons, the equipment was attached to the outside of &quot;Rassvet&quot; (MRM-1). It included a spare elbow joint for the European Robotic Arm (ERA) (which was launched with &quot;Nauka&quot;) and an ERA-portable workpost used during EVAs, as well as RTOd add-on heat radiator and internal hardware alongside the pressurized experiment airlock.

The RTOd radiator adds additional cooling capability to &quot;Nauka&quot;, which enables the module to host more scientific experiments.

The ERA was used to remove the RTOd radiator from &quot;Rassvet&quot; and transferred over to &quot;Nauka&quot; during VKD-56 spacewalk. Later it was activated and fully deployed on VKD-58 spacewalk. This process took several months. A portable work platform was also transferred over in August 2023 during VKD-60 spacewalk, which can attach to the end of the ERA to allow cosmonauts to &quot;ride&quot; on the end of the arm during spacewalks. However, even after several months of outfitting EVAs and RTOd heat radiator installation, six months later, the RTOd radiator malfunctioned before active use of Nauka (the purpose of RTOd installation is to radiate heat from Nauka experiments). The malfunction, a leak, rendered the RTOd radiator unusable for Nauka. This is the third ISS radiator leak after Soyuz MS-22 and Progress MS-21 radiator leaks. If a spare RTOd is not available, Nauka experiments will have to rely on Nauka&#x27;s main launch radiator and the module could never be used to its full capacity.

Another MLM outfitting is a 4 segment external payload interface called means of attachment of large payloads (Sredstva Krepleniya Krupnogabaritnykh Obyektov, SKKO). Delivered in two parts to Nauka by Progress MS-18 (LCCS part) and Progress MS-21 (SCCCS part) as part of the module activation outfitting process. It was taken outside and installed on the ERA aft facing base point on Nauka during the VKD-55 spacewalk.

====Robotic arms and cargo cranes====
The Integrated Truss Structure (ITS) serves as a base for the station&#x27;s primary remote manipulator system, the Mobile Servicing System (MSS), which is composed of three main components:
* Canadarm2, the largest robotic arm on the ISS, has a mass of and is used to: dock and manipulate spacecraft and modules on the USOS; hold crew members and equipment in place during EVAs; and move Dextre to perform tasks.
* Dextre is a robotic manipulator that has two arms and a rotating torso, with power tools, lights, and video for replacing orbital replacement units (ORUs) and performing other tasks requiring fine control.
* The Mobile Base System (MBS) is a platform that rides on rails along the length of the station&#x27;s main truss, which serves as a mobile base for Canadarm2 and Dextre, allowing the robotic arms to reach all parts of the USOS.

A grapple fixture was added to &quot;Zarya&quot; on STS-134 to enable Canadarm2 to inchworm itself onto the ROS. Also installed during STS-134 was the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS), which had been used to inspect heat shield tiles on Space Shuttle missions and which can be used on the station to increase the reach of the MSS. Staff on Earth or the ISS can operate the MSS components using remote control, performing work outside the station without the need for space walks.

Japan&#x27;s Remote Manipulator System, which services the &quot;Kibō&quot; Exposed Facility, was launched on STS-124 and is attached to the &quot;Kibō&quot; Pressurised Module. The arm is similar to the Space Shuttle arm as it is permanently attached at one end and has a latching end effector for standard grapple fixtures at the other.

The European Robotic Arm, which will service the ROS, was launched alongside the &quot;Nauka&quot; module. The ROS does not require spacecraft or modules to be manipulated, as all spacecraft and modules dock automatically and may be discarded the same way. Crew use the two &quot;Strela&quot; () cargo cranes during EVAs for moving crew and equipment around the ROS. Each Strela crane has a mass of .

=== Former module ===

==== &quot;Pirs&quot; ====
Pirs (Russian: Пирс, lit. &#x27;Pier&#x27;) was launched on 14 September 2001, as ISS Assembly Mission 4R, on a Russian Soyuz-U rocket, using a modified Progress spacecraft, Progress M-SO1, as an upper stage. Pirs was undocked by Progress MS-16 on 26 July 2021, 10:56 UTC, and deorbited on the same day at 14:51 UTC to make room for &quot;Nauka&quot; module to be attached to the space station. Prior to its departure, Pirs served as the primary Russian airlock on the station, being used to store and refurbish the Russian Orlan spacesuits.

===Planned components===
==== Axiom segment ====
In January 2020, NASA awarded Axiom Space a contract to build a commercial module for the ISS. The contract is under the NextSTEP2 program. NASA negotiated with Axiom on a firm fixed-price contract basis to build and deliver the module, which will attach to the forward port of the space station&#x27;s &quot;Harmony (Node 2)&quot; module. Although NASA only commissioned one module, Axiom planned to build an entire segment consisting of five modules, including a node module, an orbital research and manufacturing facility, a crew habitat, and a &quot;large-windowed Earth observatory&quot;. The Axiom segment was expected to greatly increase the capabilities and value of the space station, allowing for larger crews and private spaceflight by other organisations. Axiom planned to convert the segment into a stand-alone space station once the ISS is decommissioned, with the intention that this would act as a successor to the ISS. Canadarm2 is planned to continue its operations on Axiom Station after the retirement of ISS in 2030. In December 2024, Axiom Space revised their station assembly plans to require only one module to dock with the ISS before assembling Axiom Station in an independent orbit.

, Axiom Space expects to launch one module, the Payload Power Thermal Module (PPTM), to the ISS no earlier than 2027. PPTM is expected to remain at the ISS until the launch of Axiom&#x27;s Habitat One (Hab-1) module about one year later, after which it will detach from the ISS to join with Hab-1.

==== US Deorbit Vehicle ====
The US Deorbit Vehicle (USDV) is a NASA-provided spacecraft intended to perform a controlled de-orbit and demise of the station after the end of its operational life in 2030. In June 2024, NASA awarded SpaceX a contract to build the Deorbit Vehicle. NASA plans to de-orbit ISS as soon as they have the &quot;minimum capability&quot; in orbit: &quot;the USDV and at least one commercial station.&quot;

===Cancelled components===
Several modules developed or planned for the station were cancelled over the course of the ISS programme. Reasons include budgetary constraints, the modules becoming unnecessary, and station redesigns after the 2003 &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster. The US Centrifuge Accommodations Module would have hosted science experiments in varying levels of artificial gravity. The US Habitation Module would have served as the station&#x27;s living quarters. Instead, the living quarters are now spread throughout the station. The US Interim Control Module and ISS Propulsion Module would have replaced the functions of &quot;Zvezda&quot; in case of a launch failure. Two Russian Research Modules were planned for scientific research. They would have docked to a Russian Universal Docking Module. The Russian Science Power Platform would have supplied power to the Russian Orbital Segment independent of the ITS solar arrays.

====Science Power Modules 1 and 2 (Repurposed Components)====
Science Power Module 1 (SPM-1, also known as NEM-1) and Science Power Module 2 (SPM-2, also known as NEM-2) are modules that were originally planned to arrive at the ISS no earlier than 2024, and dock to the &quot;Prichal&quot; module, which is docked to the &quot;Nauka&quot; module. In April 2021, Roscosmos announced that NEM-1 would be repurposed to function as the core module of the proposed Russian Orbital Service Station (ROSS), launching no earlier than 2027 and docking to the free-flying &quot;Nauka&quot; module. NEM-2 may be converted into another core &quot;base&quot; module, which would be launched in 2028.

====Xbase====

Designed by Bigelow Aerospace. In August 2016, Bigelow negotiated an agreement with NASA to develop a full-size ground prototype Deep Space Habitation based on the B330 under the second phase of Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships. The module was called the Expandable Bigelow Advanced Station Enhancement (XBASE), as Bigelow hoped to test the module by attaching it to the International Space Station. However, in March 2020, Bigelow laid off all 88 of its employees, and the company remains dormant and is considered defunct, making it appear unlikely that the XBASE module will ever be launched.

====Nautilus-X Centrifuge Demonstration====
A proposal was put forward in 2011 for a first in-space demonstration of a sufficiently scaled centrifuge for artificial partial-g gravity effects. It was designed to become a sleep module for the ISS crew. The project was cancelled in favour of other projects due to budget constraints.

==Onboard systems==
===Life support===

The critical systems are the atmosphere control system, the water supply system, the food supply facilities, the sanitation and hygiene equipment, and fire detection and suppression equipment. The Russian Orbital Segment&#x27;s life support systems are contained in the &quot;Zvezda&quot; service module. Some of these systems are supplemented by equipment in the USOS. The &quot;Nauka&quot; laboratory has a complete set of life support systems.

====Atmospheric control systems====

The atmosphere on board the ISS is similar to that of Earth. Normal air pressure on the ISS is ; the same as at sea level on Earth. An Earth-like atmosphere offers benefits for crew comfort, and is much safer than a pure oxygen atmosphere, because of the increased risk of a fire such as that responsible for the deaths of the Apollo 1 crew. Earth-like atmospheric conditions have been maintained on all Russian and Soviet spacecraft.

The &quot;Elektron&quot; system aboard &quot;Zvezda&quot; and a similar system in &quot;Destiny&quot; generate oxygen aboard the station. The crew has a backup option in the form of bottled oxygen and Solid Fuel Oxygen Generation (SFOG) canisters, a chemical oxygen generator system. Carbon dioxide is removed from the air by the Vozdukh system in &quot;Zvezda&quot;. Other by-products of human metabolism, such as methane from the intestines and ammonia from sweat, are removed by activated charcoal filters.

Part of the ROS atmosphere control system is the oxygen supply. Triple-redundancy is provided by the Elektron unit, solid fuel generators, and stored oxygen. The primary supply of oxygen is the Elektron unit which produces and by electrolysis of water and vents overboard. The system uses approximately one litre of water per crew member per day. This water is either brought from Earth or recycled from other systems. &quot;Mir&quot; was the first spacecraft to use recycled water for oxygen production. The secondary oxygen supply is provided by burning oxygen-producing Vika cartridges (see also ISS ECLSS). Each &#x27;candle&#x27; takes 5–20 minutes to decompose at , producing of . This unit is manually operated.

The US Orbital Segment (USOS) has redundant supplies of oxygen, from a pressurised storage tank on the &quot;Quest&quot; airlock module delivered in 2001, supplemented ten years later by ESA-built Advanced Closed-Loop System (ACLS) in the &quot;Tranquility&quot; module (Node 3), which produces by electrolysis. Hydrogen produced is combined with carbon dioxide from the cabin atmosphere and converted to water and methane.

===Power and thermal control===

Double-sided solar arrays provide electrical power to the ISS. These bifacial cells collect direct sunlight on one side and light reflected off from the Earth on the other, and are more efficient and operate at a lower temperature than single-sided cells commonly used on Earth. 

The Russian segment of the station, like most spacecraft, uses 28 V low voltage DC from two rotating solar arrays mounted on &quot;Zvezda&quot;. The USOS uses 130–180 V DC from the USOS PV array. Power is stabilised and distributed at 160 V DC and converted to the user-required 124 V DC. The higher distribution voltage allows smaller, lighter conductors, at the expense of crew safety. The two station segments share power with converters.

The USOS solar arrays are arranged as four wing pairs, for a total production of 75 to 90 kilowatts. These arrays normally track the Sun to maximise power generation. Each array is about in area and long. In the complete configuration, the solar arrays track the Sun by rotating the &quot;alpha gimbal&quot; once per orbit; the &quot;beta gimbal&quot; follows slower changes in the angle of the Sun to the orbital plane. The Night Glider mode aligns the solar arrays parallel to the ground at night to reduce the significant aerodynamic drag at the station&#x27;s relatively low orbital altitude.

The station originally used rechargeable nickel–hydrogen batteries () for continuous power during the 45 minutes of every 90-minute orbit that it is eclipsed by the Earth. The batteries are recharged on the day side of the orbit. They had a 6.5-year lifetime (over 37,000 charge/discharge cycles) and were regularly replaced over the anticipated 20-year life of the station. Starting in 2016, the nickel–hydrogen batteries were replaced by lithium-ion batteries, which are expected to last until the end of the ISS program.

The station&#x27;s large solar panels generate a high potential voltage difference between the station and the ionosphere. This could cause arcing through insulating surfaces and sputtering of conductive surfaces as ions are accelerated by the spacecraft plasma sheath. To mitigate this, plasma contactor units create current paths between the station and the ambient space plasma.
The station&#x27;s systems and experiments consume a large amount of electrical power, almost all of which is converted to heat. To keep the internal temperature within workable limits, a passive thermal control system (PTCS) is made of external surface materials, insulation such as MLI, and heat pipes. If the PTCS cannot keep up with the heat load, an External Active Thermal Control System (EATCS) maintains the temperature. The EATCS consists of an internal, non-toxic, water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere, which transfers collected heat into an external liquid ammonia loop. From the heat exchangers, ammonia is pumped into external radiators that emit heat as infrared radiation, then the ammonia is cycled back to the station. The EATCS provides cooling for all the US pressurised modules, including &quot;Kibō&quot; and &quot;Columbus&quot;, as well as the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 trusses. It can reject up to 70 kW. This is much more than the 14 kW of the Early External Active Thermal Control System (EEATCS) via the Early Ammonia Servicer (EAS), which was launched on STS-105 and installed onto the P6 Truss.

===Communications and computers===

The ISS relies on various radio communication systems to provide telemetry and scientific data links between the station and mission control centres. Radio links are also used during rendezvous and docking procedures and for audio and video communication between crew members, flight controllers and family members. As a result, the ISS is equipped with internal and external communication systems used for different purposes.

The Russian Orbital Segment primarily uses the &quot;Lira&quot; antenna mounted on &quot;Zvezda&quot; for direct ground communication. It also had the capability to utilize the &quot;Luch&quot; data relay satellite system, which was in a state of disrepair when the station was built, but was restored to operational status in 2011 and 2012 with the launch of Luch-5A and Luch-5B. Additionally, the Voskhod-M system provides internal telephone communications and VHF radio links to ground control.

The US Orbital Segment (USOS) makes use of two separate radio links: S band (audio, telemetry, commanding – located on the P1/S1 truss) and Ku band (audio, video and data – located on the Z1 truss) systems. These transmissions are routed via the United States Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) in geostationary orbit, allowing for almost continuous real-time communications with Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center (MCC-H) in Houston, Texas. Data channels for the Canadarm2, European &quot;Columbus&quot; laboratory and Japanese &quot;Kibō&quot; modules were originally also routed via the S band and Ku band systems, with the European Data Relay System and a similar Japanese system intended to eventually complement the TDRSS in this role.

UHF radio is used by astronauts and cosmonauts conducting EVAs and other spacecraft that dock to or undock from the station. Automated spacecraft are fitted with their own communications equipment; the ATV used a laser attached to the spacecraft and the Proximity Communications Equipment attached to &quot;Zvezda&quot; to accurately dock with the station.

The US Orbital Segment of the ISS is equipped with approximately 100 commercial off-the-shelf laptops running Windows or Linux. These devices are modified to use the station&#x27;s 28V DC power system and with additional ventilation since heat generated by the devices can stagnate in the weightless environment. NASA prefers to keep a high commonality between laptops and spare parts are kept on the station so astronauts can repair laptops when needed.

The laptops are divided into two groups: the Portable Computer System (PCS) and Station Support Computers (SSC).

PCS laptops run Linux and are used for connecting to the station&#x27;s primary Command &amp; Control computer (C&amp;C MDM), which runs on Debian Linux, a switch made from Windows in 2013 for reliability and flexibility. The primary computer supervises the critical systems that keep the station in orbit and supporting life. Since the primary computer has no display or keyboards, astronauts use a PCS laptop to connect as remote terminals via a USB to 1553 adapter. The primary computer experienced failures in 2001, 2007, and 2017. The 2017 failure required a spacewalk to replace external components.

SSC laptops are used for everything else on the station, including reviewing procedures, managing scientific experiments, communicating over e-mail or video chat, and for entertainment during downtime. SSC laptops connect to the station&#x27;s wireless LAN via Wi-Fi, which connects to the ground via the Ku band. While originally this provided speeds of 10 Mbit/s download and 3 Mbit/s upload from the station, NASA upgraded the system in 2019 and increased the speeds to 600 Mbit/s. ISS crew members have access to the internet.

==Operations==
===Expeditions===

Each permanent crew is given an expedition number. Expeditions run up to six months, from launch until undocking, an &#x27;increment&#x27; covers the same time period, but includes cargo spacecraft and all activities. Expeditions 1 to 6 consisted of three-person crews. After the destruction of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;, Expeditions 7 to 12 were reduced to two-person &quot;caretaker&quot; crews who could maintain the station, because a larger crew could not be fully resupplied by the small Russian Progress cargo spacecraft. After the Shuttle fleet returned to flight, three person crews also returned to the ISS beginning with Expedition 13. As the Shuttle flights expanded the station, crew sizes also expanded, eventually reaching six around 2010. With the arrival of crew on larger US commercial spacecraft beginning in 2020, crew size has been increased to seven, the number for which ISS was originally designed.

Oleg Kononenko of Roscosmos holds the record for the longest time spent in space and at the ISS, accumulating nearly 1,111 days in space over the course of five long-duration missions on the ISS (Expedition 17, 30/31, 44/45, 57/58/59 and 69/70/71). He also served as commander three times (Expedition 31, 58/59 and 70/71).

Peggy Whitson of NASA and Axiom Space has spent the most time in space of any American, accumulating over 675 days in space during her time on Expeditions 5, 16, and 50/51/52 and Axiom Mission 2.

===Private flights===
Travellers who pay for their own passage into space are termed spaceflight participants by Roscosmos and NASA, and are sometimes referred to as &quot;space tourists&quot;, a term they generally dislike. , thirteen space tourists have visited the ISS; nine were transported to the ISS on Russian Soyuz spacecraft, and four were transported on American SpaceX Dragon 2 spacecraft. For one-tourist missions, when professional crews change over in numbers not divisible by the three seats in a Soyuz, and a short-stay crewmember is not sent, the spare seat is sold by MirCorp through Space Adventures. Space tourism was halted in 2011 when the Space Shuttle was retired and the station&#x27;s crew size was reduced to six, as the partners relied on Russian transport seats for access to the station. Soyuz flight schedules increased after 2013, allowing five Soyuz flights (15 seats) with only two expeditions (12 seats) required. The remaining seats were to be sold for around US$40 million each to members of the public who could pass a medical exam. ESA and NASA criticised private spaceflight at the beginning of the ISS, and NASA initially resisted training Dennis Tito, the first person to pay for his own passage to the ISS. 

Anousheh Ansari became the first self-funded woman to fly to the ISS as well as the first Iranian in space. Officials reported that her education and experience made her much more than a tourist, and her performance in training had been &quot;excellent.&quot; She did Russian and European studies involving medicine and microbiology during her 10-day stay. The 2009 documentary &quot;Space Tourists&quot; follows her journey to the station, where she fulfilled &quot;an age-old dream of man: to leave our planet as a &#x27;normal person&#x27; and travel into outer space.&quot;

In 2008, spaceflight participant Richard Garriott placed a geocache aboard the ISS during his flight. This is currently the only non-terrestrial geocache in existence. At the same time, the Immortality Drive, an electronic record of eight digitised human DNA sequences, was placed aboard the ISS.

After a 12-year hiatus, the first two wholly space tourism-dedicated private spaceflights to the ISS were undertaken. Soyuz MS-20 launched in December 2021, carrying visiting Roscosmos cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin and two Japanese space tourists under the aegis of the private company Space Adventures; in April 2022, the company Axiom Space chartered a SpaceX Dragon 2 spacecraft and sent its own employee astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria and three space tourists to the ISS for Axiom Mission 1, followed in May 2023 by one more tourist, John Shoffner, alongside employee astronaut Peggy Whitson and two Saudi astronauts for the Axiom Mission 2.

=== Fleet operations ===
Various crewed and uncrewed spacecraft have supported the station&#x27;s activities. Flights to the ISS include 37 Space Shuttle, 91 Progress, 71 Soyuz, 5 ATV, 9 HTV, 2 Boeing Starliner, 45 SpaceX Dragon and 20 Cygnus missions.

There are currently eight docking ports for visiting spacecraft, with four additional ports installed but not yet put into service:

# &quot;Harmony&quot; forward (with &quot;PMA 2&quot; &amp; &quot;IDA 2&quot;)
# &quot;Harmony&quot; zenith (with &quot;PMA 3&quot; &amp; &quot;IDA 3&quot;)
# &quot;Harmony&quot; nadir (CBM port)
# &quot;Unity&quot; nadir (CBM port)
# &quot;Prichal&quot; aft
# &quot;Prichal&quot; forward
# &quot;Prichal&quot; nadir
# &quot;Prichal&quot; port
# &quot;Prichal&quot; starboard
# &quot;Poisk&quot; zenith
# &quot;Rassvet&quot; nadir
# &quot;Zvezda&quot; aft
Forward ports are at the front of the station according to its normal direction of travel and orientation (attitude). Aft is at the rear of the station. Nadir is Earth facing, zenith faced away from Earth. Port is to the left if pointing one&#x27;s feet towards the Earth and looking in the direction of travel and starboard is to the right.

Cargo spacecraft that will perform an orbital re-boost of the station will typically dock at an aft, forward or nadir-facing port.

==== Crewed ====

, 281 people representing 23 countries had visited the space station, many of them multiple times. The United States has sent 167 people, Russia has 61, Japan has sent 11, Canada has sent nine, Italy has sent six, France and Germany have each sent four, Saudi Arabia, Sweden and the United Arab Emirates have each sent two, and there has been one person from Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Israel, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Netherlands, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom.

==== Uncrewed ====

Uncrewed spaceflights are made primarily to deliver cargo, however several Russian modules have also docked to the outpost following uncrewed launches. Resupply missions typically use the Russian Progress spacecraft, former European ATVs, Japanese Kounotori vehicles, and the American Dragon and Cygnus spacecraft.

==== Currently docked/berthed ====

&quot;All dates are UTC. Departure dates are the earliest possible () and may change.&quot;

&quot;All dates are UTC. Launch dates are the earliest possible () and may change.&quot;

==== Docking and berthing of spacecraft ====
The Russian spacecraft and can autonomously rendezvous and dock with the station without human intervention. Once within approximately , the spacecraft begins receiving radio signals from the Kurs docking navigation system on the station. As the spacecraft nears the station, laser-based optical equipment precisely aligns the craft with the docking port and controls the final approach. While the crew on the ISS and spacecraft monitor the procedure, their role is primarily supervisory, with intervention limited to issuing abort commands in emergencies. Although initial development costs were substantial, the system&#x27;s reliability and standardized components have yielded significant cost reductions for subsequent missions.

The American SpaceX Dragon 2 cargo and crewed spacecraft can autonomously rendezvous and dock with the station without human intervention. However, on crewed Dragon missions, the astronauts have the capability to intervene and fly the vehicle manually.
Other automated cargo spacecraft typically use a semi-automated process when arriving and departing from the station. These spacecraft are instructed to approach and park near the station. Once the crew on board the station is ready, the spacecraft is commanded to come close to the station, so that it can be grappled by an astronaut using the Mobile Servicing System robotic arm. The final mating of the spacecraft to the station is achieved using the robotic arm (a process known as berthing). Spacecraft using this semi-automated process include the American Cygnus and the Japanese HTV-X. The now-retired American SpaceX Dragon 1, European ATV and Japanese HTV also used this process.

==== Launch and docking windows ====
Prior to a spacecraft&#x27;s docking to the ISS, navigation and attitude control (GNC) is handed over to the ground control of the spacecraft&#x27;s country of origin. GNC is set to allow the station to drift in space, rather than fire its thrusters or turn using gyroscopes. The solar panels of the station are turned edge-on to the incoming spacecraft, so residue from its thrusters does not damage the cells. Before its retirement, Shuttle launches were often given priority over Soyuz, with occasional priority given to Soyuz arrivals carrying crew and time-critical cargoes, such as biological experiment materials.

===Repairs===

Orbital Replacement Units (ORUs) are spare parts that can be readily replaced when a unit either passes its design life or fails. Examples of ORUs are pumps, storage tanks, controller boxes, antennas, and battery units. Some units can be replaced using robotic arms. Most are stored outside the station, either on small pallets called ExPRESS Logistics Carriers (ELCs) or share larger platforms called External Stowage Platforms (ESPs) which also hold science experiments. Both kinds of pallets provide electricity for many parts that could be damaged by the cold of space and require heating. The larger logistics carriers also have local area network (LAN) connections for telemetry to connect experiments. A heavy emphasis on stocking the USOS with ORU&#x27;s occurred around 2011, before the end of the NASA shuttle programme, as its commercial replacements, Cygnus and Dragon, carry one tenth to one quarter the payload.

Unexpected problems and failures have impacted the station&#x27;s assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and, in some cases, could have forced abandonment of the station for safety reasons. Serious problems include an air leak from the USOS in 2004, the venting of fumes from an &quot;Elektron&quot; oxygen generator in 2006, and the failure of the computers in the ROS in 2007 during STS-117 that left the station without thruster, &quot;Elektron&quot;, &quot;Vozdukh&quot; and other environmental control system operations. In the latter case, the root cause was found to be condensation inside electrical connectors leading to a short circuit.

During STS-120 in 2007 and following the relocation of the P6 truss and solar arrays, it was noted during unfurling that the solar array had torn and was not deploying properly. An EVA was carried out by Scott Parazynski, assisted by Douglas Wheelock. Extra precautions were taken to reduce the risk of electric shock, as the repairs were carried out with the solar array exposed to sunlight. The issues with the array were followed in the same year by problems with the starboard Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ), which rotates the arrays on the starboard side of the station. Excessive vibration and high-current spikes in the array drive motor were noted, resulting in a decision to substantially curtail motion of the starboard SARJ until the cause was understood. Inspections during EVAs on STS-120 and STS-123 showed extensive contamination from metallic shavings and debris in the large drive gear and confirmed damage to the large metallic bearing surfaces, so the joint was locked to prevent further damage. Repairs to the joints were carried out during STS-126 with lubrication and the replacement of 11 out of 12 trundle bearings on the joint.

In September 2008, damage to the S1 radiator was first noticed in Soyuz imagery. The problem was initially not thought to be serious. The imagery showed that the surface of one sub-panel had peeled back from the underlying central structure, possibly because of micro-meteoroid or debris impact. On 15 May 2009, the damaged radiator panel&#x27;s ammonia tubing was mechanically shut off from the rest of the cooling system by the computer-controlled closure of a valve. The same valve was then used to vent the ammonia from the damaged panel, eliminating the possibility of an ammonia leak. It is also known that a Service Module thruster cover struck the S1 radiator after being jettisoned during an EVA in 2008, but its effect, if any, has not been determined.

In the early hours of 1 August 2010, a failure in cooling Loop A (starboard side), one of two external cooling loops, left the station with only half of its normal cooling capacity and zero redundancy in some systems. The problem appeared to be in the ammonia pump module that circulates the ammonia cooling fluid. Several subsystems, including two of the four CMGs, were shut down.

Planned operations on the ISS were interrupted through a series of EVAs to address the cooling system issue. A first EVA on 7 August 2010, to replace the failed pump module, was not fully completed because of an ammonia leak in one of four quick-disconnects. A second EVA on 11 August removed the failed pump module. A third EVA was required to restore Loop A to normal functionality.

The USOS&#x27;s cooling system is largely built by the US company Boeing, which is also the manufacturer of the failed pump.

The four Main Bus Switching Units (MBSUs, located in the S0 truss), control the routing of power from the four solar array wings to the rest of the ISS. Each MBSU has two power channels that feed 160V DC from the arrays to two DC-to-DC power converters (DDCUs) that supply the 124V power used in the station. In late 2011, MBSU-1 ceased responding to commands or sending data confirming its health. While still routing power correctly, it was scheduled to be swapped out at the next available EVA. A spare MBSU was already on board, but a 30 August 2012 EVA failed to be completed when a bolt being tightened to finish installation of the spare unit jammed before the electrical connection was secured. The loss of MBSU-1 limited the station to 75% of its normal power capacity, requiring minor limitations in normal operations until the problem could be addressed.

On 5 September 2012, in a second six-hour EVA, astronauts Sunita Williams and Akihiko Hoshide successfully replaced MBSU-1 and restored the ISS to 100% power.

On 24 December 2013, astronauts installed a new ammonia pump for the station&#x27;s cooling system. The faulty cooling system had failed earlier in the month, halting many of the station&#x27;s science experiments. Astronauts had to brave a &quot;mini blizzard&quot; of ammonia while installing the new pump. It was only the second Christmas Eve spacewalk in NASA history.

=== Mission control centres ===

The components of the ISS are operated and monitored by their respective space agencies at mission control centres across the globe, primarily the Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center in Houston and the RKA Mission Control Center (TsUP) in Moscow, with support from Tsukuba Space Center in Japan, Payload Operations and Integration Center in Huntsville, Alabama, U.S., Columbus Control Center in Munich, Germany and Mobile Servicing System Control at the Canadian Space Agency&#x27;s headquarters in Saint-Hubert, Quebec.

==Life aboard==
===Living quarters===
The living and working space aboard the International Space Station (ISS) is larger than a six-bedroom house, equipped with seven private sleeping quarters, three bathrooms, two dining rooms, a gym, and a panoramic 360-degree-view bay window.

The station provides dedicated crew quarters for long-term crew members. Two &quot;sleep stations&quot; are located in the &quot;Zvezda&quot; module, one in &quot;Nauka&quot;, and four in &quot;Harmony&quot;. These soundproof, person-sized booths offer privacy, ventilation, and basic amenities such as a sleeping bag, a reading lamp, a desktop, a shelf, and storage for personal items. The quarters in &quot;Zvezda&quot; include a small window but have less ventilation and soundproofing.

Visiting crew members use tethered sleeping bags attached to available wall space. While it is possible to sleep floating freely, this is generally avoided to prevent collisions with sensitive equipment. Proper ventilation is critical, as astronauts risk oxygen deprivation if exhaled carbon dioxide accumulates in a bubble around their heads.

The station’s lighting system is adjustable, allowing for dimming, switching off, and colour temperature changes to support crew activities and rest.

===Crew activities===
The ISS operates on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). A typical day aboard the ISS begins at 06:00 with wake-up, post-sleep routines, and a morning inspection of the station. After breakfast, the crew holds a daily planning conference with Mission Control, starting work around 08:10. Morning tasks include scheduled exercise, scientific experiments, maintenance, or operational duties. Following a one-hour lunch break at 13:05, the crew resumes their afternoon schedule of work and exercise. Pre-sleep activities, including dinner and a crew conference, begin at 19:30, with the scheduled sleep period starting at 21:30.

The crew works approximately 10 hours on weekdays and 5 hours on Saturdays, with the remaining time allocated for relaxation or catching up on tasks. Free time often involves enjoying personal hobbies, communicating with family, or gazing out at Earth through the station’s windows. The crew can watch TV aboard the station.

When the Space Shuttle was operating, the ISS crew aligned with the shuttle crew&#x27;s Mission Elapsed Time, a flexible schedule based on the shuttle&#x27;s launch.

To simulate night conditions, the station’s windows are covered during designated sleep periods, as the ISS experiences 16 sunrises and sunsets daily due to its orbital speed.

=== Reflection and material culture ===
Reflection of individual and crew characteristics are found particularly in the decoration of the station and expressions in general, such as religion. The latter has produced a certain material economy between the station and Russia in particular.

The micro-society of the station, as well as wider society, and possibly the emergence of distinct station cultures, is being studied by analyzing many aspects, from art to dust accumulation, as well as archaeologically how material of the ISS has been discarded.

===Food and personal hygiene===

On the USOS, most of the food aboard is vacuum sealed in plastic bags; cans are rare because they are heavy and expensive to transport. Preserved food is not highly regarded by the crew and taste is reduced in microgravity, so efforts are taken to make the food more palatable, including using more spices than in regular cooking. The crew looks forward to the arrival of any spacecraft from Earth as they bring fresh fruit and vegetables. Care is taken that foods do not create crumbs, and liquid condiments are preferred over solid to avoid contaminating station equipment. Each crew member has individual food packages and cooks them in the galley, which has two food warmers, a refrigerator (added in November 2008), and a water dispenser that provides heated and unheated water. Drinks are provided as dehydrated powder that is mixed with water before consumption. Drinks and soups are sipped from plastic bags with straws, while solid food is eaten with a knife and fork attached to a tray with magnets to prevent them from floating away. Any food that floats away, including crumbs, must be collected to prevent it from clogging the station&#x27;s air filters and other equipment.

Showers on space stations were introduced in the early 1970s on &quot;Skylab&quot; and &quot;Salyut&quot; 3. By &quot;Salyut&quot; 6, in the early 1980s, the crew complained of the complexity of showering in space, which was a monthly activity. The ISS does not feature a shower; instead, crewmembers wash using a water jet and wet wipes, with soap dispensed from a toothpaste tube-like container. Crews are also provided with rinseless shampoo and edible toothpaste to save water.

There are two space toilets on the ISS, both of Russian design, located in &quot;Zvezda&quot; and &quot;Tranquility&quot;. These Waste and Hygiene Compartments use a fan-driven suction system similar to the Space Shuttle Waste Collection System. Astronauts first fasten themselves to the toilet seat, which is equipped with spring-loaded restraining bars to ensure a good seal. A lever operates a powerful fan and a suction hole slides open: the air stream carries the waste away. Solid waste is collected in individual bags which are stored in an aluminium container. Full containers are transferred to Progress spacecraft for disposal. Liquid waste is evacuated by a hose connected to the front of the toilet, with anatomically correct &quot;urine funnel adapters&quot; attached to the tube so that men and women can use the same toilet. The diverted urine is collected and transferred to the Water Recovery System, where it is recycled into drinking water. In 2021, the arrival of the Nauka module also brought a third toilet to the ISS.

===Crew health and safety===
====Overall====
On 12 April 2019, NASA reported medical results from the Astronaut Twin Study. Astronaut Scott Kelly spent a year in space on the ISS, while his identical twin spent the year on Earth. Several long-lasting changes were observed, including those related to alterations in DNA and cognition, when one twin was compared with the other.

In November 2019, researchers reported that astronauts experienced serious blood flow and clot problems while on board the ISS, based on a six-month study of 11 healthy astronauts. The results may influence long-term spaceflight, including a mission to the planet Mars, according to the researchers.

====Radiation====

The ISS is partially protected from the space environment by Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. From an average distance of about from the Earth&#x27;s surface, depending on Solar activity, the magnetosphere begins to deflect solar wind around Earth and the space station. Solar flares are still a hazard to the crew, who may receive only a few minutes warning. In 2005, during the initial &quot;proton storm&quot; of an X-3 class solar flare, the crew of Expedition 10 took shelter in a more heavily shielded part of the ROS designed for this purpose.

Subatomic charged particles, primarily protons from cosmic rays and solar wind, are normally absorbed by Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. When they interact in sufficient quantity, their effect is visible to the naked eye in a phenomenon called an aurora. Outside Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, ISS crews are exposed to approximately one millisievert each day (about a year&#x27;s worth of natural exposure on Earth), resulting in a higher risk of cancer. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the DNA and chromosomes of lymphocytes; being central to the immune system, any damage to these cells could contribute to the lower immunity experienced by astronauts. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in astronauts. Protective shielding and medications may lower the risks to an acceptable level.

Radiation levels on the ISS are between 12 and 28.8 milli rads per day, about five times greater than those experienced by airline passengers and crew, as Earth&#x27;s electromagnetic field provides almost the same level of protection against solar and other types of radiation in low Earth orbit as in the stratosphere. For example, on a 12-hour flight, an airline passenger would experience 0.1 millisieverts of radiation, or a rate of 0.2 millisieverts per day; this is one fifth the rate experienced by an astronaut in LEO. Additionally, airline passengers experience this level of radiation for a few hours of flight, while the ISS crew are exposed for their whole stay on board the station.

====Stress====
There is considerable evidence that psychosocial stressors are among the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance. Cosmonaut Valery Ryumin wrote in his journal during a particularly difficult period on board the &quot;Salyut&quot; 6 space station: &quot;All the conditions necessary for murder are met if you shut two men in a cabin measuring 18 feet by 20 [5.5 m × 6 m] and leave them together for two months.&quot;

NASA&#x27;s interest in psychological stress caused by space travel, initially studied when their crewed missions began, was rekindled when astronauts joined cosmonauts on the Russian space station &quot;Mir&quot;. Common sources of stress in early US missions included maintaining high performance under public scrutiny and isolation from peers and family. The latter is still often a cause of stress on the ISS, such as when the mother of NASA astronaut Daniel Tani died in a car accident, and when Michael Fincke was forced to miss the birth of his second child.

A study of the longest spaceflight concluded that the first three weeks are a critical period where attention is adversely affected because of the demand to adjust to the extreme change of environment. ISS crew flights typically last about five to six months.

The ISS working environment includes further stress caused by living and working in cramped conditions with people from very different cultures who speak a different language. First-generation space stations had crews who spoke a single language; second- and third-generation stations have crew from many cultures who speak many languages. Astronauts must speak English and Russian, and knowing additional languages is even better.

Due to the lack of gravity, confusion often occurs. Even though there is no up and down in space, some crew members feel like they are oriented upside down. They may also have difficulty measuring distances. This can cause problems like getting lost inside the space station, pulling switches in the wrong direction or misjudging the speed of an approaching vehicle during docking.

====Medical====

The physiological effects of long-term weightlessness include muscle atrophy, deterioration of the skeleton (osteopenia), fluid redistribution, a slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, and puffiness of the face.

Sleep is regularly disturbed on the ISS because of mission demands, such as incoming or departing spacecraft. Sound levels in the station are unavoidably high. The atmosphere is unable to thermosiphon naturally, so fans are required at all times to process the air which would stagnate in the freefall (zero-G) environment.

To prevent some of the adverse effects on the body, the station is equipped with: two TVIS treadmills (including the COLBERT); the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device), which enables various weightlifting exercises that add muscle without raising (or compensating for) the astronauts&#x27; reduced bone density; and a stationary bicycle. Each astronaut spends at least two hours per day exercising on the equipment. Astronauts use bungee cords to strap themselves to the treadmill.

====Microbiological environmental hazards====

Hazardous molds that can foul air and water filters may develop aboard space stations. They can produce acids that degrade metal, glass, and rubber. They can also be harmful to the crew&#x27;s health. Microbiological hazards have led to a development of the LOCAD-PTS (a portable test system) which identifies common bacteria and molds faster than standard methods of culturing, which may require a sample to be sent back to Earth. Researchers in 2018 reported, after detecting the presence of five &quot;Enterobacter bugandensis&quot; bacterial strains on the ISS (none of which are pathogenic to humans), that microorganisms on the ISS should be carefully monitored to continue assuring a medically healthy environment for astronauts.

Contamination on space stations can be prevented by reduced humidity, and by using paint that contains mold-killing chemicals, as well as the use of antiseptic solutions. All materials used in the ISS are tested for resistance against fungi. Since 2016, a series of ESA-sponsored experiments have been conducted to test the anti-bacterial properties of various materials, with the goal of developing &quot;smart surfaces&quot; that mitigate bacterial growth in multiple ways, using the best method for a particular circumstance. Dubbed &quot;Microbial Aerosol Tethering on Innovative Surfaces&quot; (MATISS), the programme involves deployment of small plaques containing an array of glass squares covered with different test coatings. They remain on the station for six months before being returned to earth for analysis. The most recent and final experiment of the series was launched on 5 June 2023 aboard the SpaceX CRS-28 cargo mission to ISS, comprising four plaques. Whereas previous experiments in the series were limited to analysis by light microsocopy, this experiment uses quartz glass made of pure silica, which will allow spectrographic analysis. Two of the plaques were returned after eight months and the remaining two after 16 months.

In April 2019, NASA reported that a comprehensive study had been conducted into the microorganisms and fungi present on the ISS. The experiment was performed over a period of 14 months on three different flight missions, and involved taking samples from 8 predefined locations inside the station, then returning them to earth for analysis. In prior experiments, analysis was limited to culture-based methods, thus overlooking microbes which cannot be grown in culture. The present study used molecular-based methods in addition to culturing, resulting in a more complete catalog. The results may be useful in improving the health and safety conditions for astronauts, as well as better understanding other closed-in environments on Earth such as clean rooms used by the pharmaceutical and medical industries.

====Noise====
Space flight is not inherently quiet, with noise levels exceeding acoustic standards as far back as the Apollo missions. For this reason, NASA and the International Space Station international partners have developed noise control and hearing loss prevention goals as part of the health program for crew members. Specifically, these goals have been the primary focus of the ISS Multilateral Medical Operations Panel (MMOP) Acoustics Subgroup since the first days of ISS assembly and operations. The effort includes contributions from acoustical engineers, audiologists, industrial hygienists, and physicians who comprise the subgroup&#x27;s membership from NASA, Roscosmos, the European Space Agency (ESA), the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).

When compared to terrestrial environments, the noise levels incurred by astronauts and cosmonauts on the ISS may seem insignificant and typically occur at levels that would not be of major concern to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration – rarely reaching 85 dBA. But crew members are exposed to these levels 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with current missions averaging six months in duration. These levels of noise also impose risks to crew health and performance in the form of sleep interference and communication, as well as reduced alarm audibility.

Over the 19 plus year history of the ISS, significant efforts have been put forth to limit and reduce noise levels on the ISS. During design and pre-flight activities, members of the Acoustic Subgroup have written acoustic limits and verification requirements, consulted to design and choose the quietest available payloads, and then conducted acoustic verification tests prior to launch. During spaceflights, the Acoustics Subgroup has assessed each ISS module&#x27;s in flight sound levels, produced by a large number of vehicle and science experiment noise sources, to assure compliance with strict acoustic standards. The acoustic environment on ISS changed when additional modules were added during its construction, and as additional spacecraft arrive at the ISS. The Acoustics Subgroup has responded to this dynamic operations schedule by successfully designing and employing acoustic covers, absorptive materials, noise barriers, and vibration isolators to reduce noise levels. Moreover, when pumps, fans, and ventilation systems age and show increased noise levels, this Acoustics Subgroup has guided ISS managers to replace the older, noisier instruments with quiet fan and pump technologies, significantly reducing ambient noise levels.

NASA has adopted most-conservative damage risk criteria (based on recommendations from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and the World Health Organization), in order to protect all crew members. The MMOP Acoustics Subgroup has adjusted its approach to managing noise risks in this unique environment by applying, or modifying, terrestrial approaches for hearing loss prevention to set these conservative limits. One innovative approach has been NASA&#x27;s Noise Exposure Estimation Tool (NEET), in which noise exposures are calculated in a task-based approach to determine the need for hearing protection devices (HPDs). Guidance for use of HPDs, either mandatory use or recommended, is then documented in the Noise Hazard Inventory, and posted for crew reference during their missions. The Acoustics Subgroup also tracks spacecraft noise exceedances, applies engineering controls, and recommends hearing protective devices to reduce crew noise exposures. Finally, hearing thresholds are monitored on-orbit, during missions.

There have been no persistent mission-related hearing threshold shifts among US Orbital Segment crewmembers (JAXA, CSA, ESA, NASA) during what is approaching 20 years of ISS mission operations, or nearly 175,000 work hours. In 2020, the MMOP Acoustics Subgroup received the Safe-In-Sound Award for Innovation for their combined efforts to mitigate any health effects of noise.

====Fire and toxic gases====
An onboard fire or a toxic gas leak are other potential hazards. Ammonia is used in the external radiators of the station and could potentially leak into the pressurised modules.

==Orbit, environment, debris and visibility==
===Altitude and orbital inclination===
The ISS is currently maintained in a nearly circular orbit with a minimum mean altitude of and a maximum of , in the centre of the thermosphere, at an inclination of 51.6 degrees to Earth&#x27;s equator with an eccentricity of 0.007. This orbit was selected because it is the lowest inclination that can be directly reached by Russian Soyuz and Progress spacecraft launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome at 46° N latitude without overflying China or dropping spent rocket stages in inhabited areas. It travels at an average speed of , and completes orbits per day (93 minutes per orbit). The station&#x27;s altitude was allowed to fall around the time of each NASA shuttle flight to permit heavier loads to be transferred to the station. After the retirement of the shuttle, the nominal orbit of the space station was raised in altitude (from about 350 km to about 400 km). Other, more frequent supply spacecraft do not require this adjustment as they are substantially higher performance vehicles.

Atmospheric drag reduces the altitude by about 2 km a month on average. Orbital boosting can be performed by the station&#x27;s two main engines on the &quot;Zvezda&quot; service module, or Russian or European spacecraft docked to &quot;Zvezda&quot; aft port. The Automated Transfer Vehicle is constructed with the possibility of adding a second docking port to its aft end, allowing other craft to dock and boost the station. It takes approximately two orbits (three hours) for the boost to a higher altitude to be completed. Maintaining ISS altitude uses about 7.5 tonnes of chemical fuel per annum at an annual cost of about $210 million.

The Russian Orbital Segment contains the Data Management System, which handles Guidance, Navigation and Control (ROS GNC) for the entire station. Initially, &quot;Zarya&quot;, the first module of the station, controlled the station until a short time after the Russian service module &quot;Zvezda&quot; docked and was transferred control. &quot;Zvezda&quot; contains the ESA built DMS-R Data Management System. Using two fault-tolerant computers (FTC), &quot;Zvezda&quot; computes the station&#x27;s position and orbital trajectory using redundant Earth horizon sensors, Solar horizon sensors as well as Sun and star trackers. The FTCs each contain three identical processing units working in parallel and provide advanced fault-masking by majority voting.

===Orientation===
&quot;Zvezda&quot; uses gyroscopes (reaction wheels) and thrusters to turn itself. Gyroscopes do not require propellant; instead they use electricity to &#x27;store&#x27; momentum in flywheels by turning in the opposite direction to the station&#x27;s movement. The USOS has its own computer-controlled gyroscopes to handle its extra mass. When gyroscopes &#x27;saturate&#x27;, thrusters are used to cancel out the stored momentum. In February 2005, during Expedition 10, an incorrect command was sent to the station&#x27;s computer, using about 14 kilograms of propellant before the fault was noticed and fixed. When attitude control computers in the ROS and USOS fail to communicate properly, this can result in a rare &#x27;force fight&#x27; where the ROS GNC computer must ignore the USOS counterpart, which itself has no thrusters.

Docked spacecraft can also be used to maintain station attitude, such as for troubleshooting or during the installation of the S3/S4 truss, which provides electrical power and data interfaces for the station&#x27;s electronics.

===Orbital debris threats===
The low altitudes at which the ISS orbits are also home to a variety of space debris, including spent rocket stages, defunct satellites, explosion fragments (including materials from anti-satellite weapon tests), paint flakes, slag from solid rocket motors, and coolant released by US-A nuclear-powered satellites. These objects, in addition to natural micrometeoroids, are a significant threat. Objects large enough to destroy the station can be tracked, and therefore are not as dangerous as smaller debris. Objects too small to be detected by optical and radar instruments, from approximately 1 cm down to microscopic size, number in the trillions. Despite their small size, some of these objects are a threat because of their kinetic energy and direction in relation to the station. Spacewalking crew in spacesuits are also at risk of suit damage and consequent exposure to vacuum.

Ballistic panels, also called micrometeorite shielding, are incorporated into the station to protect pressurised sections and critical systems. The type and thickness of these panels depend on their predicted exposure to damage. The station&#x27;s shields and structure have different designs on the ROS and the USOS. On the USOS, Whipple Shields are used. The US segment modules consist of an inner layer made from aluminium, a intermediate layers of Kevlar and Nextel (a ceramic fabric), and an outer layer of stainless steel, which causes objects to shatter into a cloud before hitting the hull, thereby spreading the energy of impact. On the ROS, a carbon fibre reinforced polymer honeycomb screen is spaced from the hull, an aluminium honeycomb screen is spaced from that, with a screen-vacuum thermal insulation covering, and glass cloth over the top.

Space debris is tracked remotely from the ground, and the station crew can be notified. If necessary, thrusters on the Russian Orbital Segment can alter the station&#x27;s orbital altitude, avoiding the debris. These Debris Avoidance Manoeuvres (DAMs) are not uncommon, taking place if computational models show the debris will approach within a certain threat distance. Ten DAMs had been performed by the end of 2009. Usually, an increase in orbital velocity of the order of 1 m/s is used to raise the orbit by one or two kilometres. If necessary, the altitude can also be lowered, although such a manoeuvre wastes propellant. If a threat from orbital debris is identified too late for a DAM to be safely conducted, the station crew close all the hatches aboard the station and retreat into their spacecraft in order to be able to evacuate in the event the station was seriously damaged by the debris. Partial station evacuations have occurred on 13 March 2009, 28 June 2011, 24 March 2012, 16 June 2015, November 2021, and 27 June 2024.

The November 2021 evacuation was caused by a Russian anti-satellite weapon test. NASA administrator Bill Nelson said it was unthinkable that Russia would endanger the lives of everyone on ISS, including their own cosmonauts.

===Visibility from Earth===
The ISS is visible in the sky to the naked eye as a visibly moving, bright white dot, when crossing the sky and being illuminated by the Sun, during twilight, the hours after sunset and before sunrise, when the station remains sunlit, outside of Earth&#x27;s shadow, but the ground and sky are dark. It crosses the skies at latitudes between the polar regions. Depending on the path it takes across the sky, the time it takes the station to move across the horizon or from one to the other may be short or up to 10 minutes, while likely being only visible part of that time because of it moving into or out of Earth&#x27;s shadow. It then returns around every 90 minutes, with the time of the day that it crosses the sky shifting over the course of some weeks, and therefore before returning to twilight and visible illumination.

Because of the size of its reflective surface area, the ISS is the brightest artificial object in the sky (excluding other satellite flares), with an approximate maximum magnitude of −4 when in sunlight and overhead (similar to Venus), and a maximum angular size of 63 arcseconds.

Tools are provided by a number of websites such as Heavens-Above (see &quot;Live viewing&quot; below) as well as smartphone applications that use orbital data and the observer&#x27;s longitude and latitude to indicate when the ISS will be visible (weather permitting), where the station will appear to rise, the altitude above the horizon it will reach and the duration of the pass before the station disappears either by setting below the horizon or entering into Earth&#x27;s shadow.

In November 2012 NASA launched its &quot;Spot the Station&quot; service, which sends people text and email alerts when the station is due to fly above their town. The station is visible from 95% of the inhabited land on Earth, but is not visible from extreme northern or southern latitudes.

Under specific conditions, the ISS can be observed at night on five consecutive orbits. Those conditions are 1) a mid-latitude observer location, 2) near the time of the solstice with 3) the ISS passing in the direction of the pole from the observer near midnight local time. The three photos show the first, middle and last of the five passes on 5–6 June 2014.

====Astrophotography====

Using a telescope-mounted camera to photograph the station is a popular hobby for astronomers, while using a mounted camera to photograph the Earth and stars is a popular hobby for crew. The use of a telescope or binoculars allows viewing of the ISS during daylight hours.

Transits of the ISS in front of the Sun, particularly during an eclipse (and so the Earth, Sun, Moon, and ISS are all positioned approximately in a single line) are of particular interest for amateur astronomers.

==International co-operation==
Involving five space programs and fifteen countries, the International Space Station is the most politically and legally complex space exploration programme in history. The 1998 Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement sets forth the primary framework for international cooperation among the parties. A series of subsequent agreements govern other aspects of the station, ranging from jurisdictional issues to a code of conduct among visiting astronauts.

Brazil was also invited to participate in the programme, the only developing country to receive such an invitation. Under the agreement framework, Brazil was to provide six pieces of hardware, and in exchange, would receive ISS utilization rights. However, Brazil was unable to deliver any of the elements due to a lack of funding and political priority within the country. Brazil officially dropped out of the ISS programme in 2007.

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, continued cooperation between Russia and other countries on the International Space Station has been put into question. Roscosmos Director General Dmitry Rogozin insinuated that Russian withdrawal could cause the International Space Station to de-orbit due to lack of reboost capabilities, writing in a series of tweets, &quot;If you block cooperation with us, who will save the ISS from an unguided de-orbit to impact on the territory of the US or Europe? There&#x27;s also the chance of impact of the 500-ton construction in India or China. Do you want to threaten them with such a prospect? The ISS doesn&#x27;t fly over Russia, so all the risk is yours. Are you ready for it?&quot; (This latter claim is untrue: the ISS flies over all parts of the Earth between 51.6 degrees latitude north and south, approximately the latitude of Saratov.) Rogozin later tweeted that normal relations between ISS partners could only be restored once sanctions have been lifted, and indicated that Roscosmos would submit proposals to the Russian government on ending cooperation. NASA stated that, if necessary, US corporation Northrop Grumman has offered a reboost capability that would keep the ISS in orbit.

On 26 July 2022, Yury Borisov, Rogozin&#x27;s successor as head of Roscosmos, submitted to Russian President Putin plans for withdrawal from the programme after 2024. However, Robyn Gatens, the NASA official in charge of the space station, responded that NASA had not received any formal notices from Roscosmos concerning withdrawal plans.

==End of mission==
Originally the ISS was planned to be a 15-year mission.
Therefore, an end of mission had been worked on, but was several times postponed due to the success and support for the operation of the station. As a result, the oldest modules of the ISS have been in orbit for more than 20 years, with their reliability having decreased. It has been proposed to use funds elsewhere instead, for example for a return to the Moon. According to the Outer Space Treaty, the parties are legally responsible for all spacecraft or modules they launch. An unmaintained station would pose an orbital and re-entry hazard.

Russia has stated that it plans to pull out of the ISS program after 2025. However, Russian modules will provide orbital station-keeping until 2028.

The US planned in 2009 to deorbit the ISS in 2016. But on 30 September 2015, Boeing&#x27;s contract with NASA as prime contractor for the ISS was extended to 30 September 2020. Part of Boeing&#x27;s services under the contract related to extending the station&#x27;s primary structural hardware past 2020 to the end of 2028. In July 2018, the Space Frontier Act of 2018 was intended to extend operations of the ISS to 2030. This bill was unanimously approved in the Senate, but failed to pass in the U.S. House. In September 2018, the Leading Human Spaceflight Act was introduced with the intent to extend operations of the ISS to 2030, and was confirmed in December 2018. Congress later passed similar provisions in its CHIPS and Science Act, signed into law by U.S. President Joe Biden on 9 August 2022.

If until 2031 Commercial LEO Destinations providers are not sufficient to accommodate NASA&#x27;s projects, NASA is suggesting to extend ISS operations beyond 2031.

===NASA&#x27;s disposal plans===
NASA considered originally several possible disposal options: natural orbital decay with random reentry (as with Skylab), boosting the station to a higher altitude (which would delay reentry), and a controlled de-orbit targeting a remote ocean area.

NASA determined that random reentry carried an unacceptable risk of producing hazardous space debris that could hit people or property and re-boosting the station would be costly and could also create hazards.

Prior to 2010, plans had contemplated using a slightly modified Progress spacecraft to de-orbit the ISS. However, NASA concluded Progress would not be adequate for the job, and decided on a spacecraft specifically designed for the job.

In January 2022, NASA announced a planned date of January 2031 to de-orbit the ISS using the &quot;U.S. Deorbit Vehicle&quot; and direct any remnants into a remote area of the South Pacific Ocean that has come to be known as the spacecraft cemetery. NASA plans to launch the deorbit vehicle in 2030, docking at the Harmony forward port. The deorbit vehicle will remain attached, dormant, for about a year as the station&#x27;s orbit naturally decays to . The spacecraft would then conduct one or more orientation burns to lower the perigee to , followed by a final deorbiting burn.

NASA began planning for the deorbit vehicle after becoming wary of Russia pulling out of the ISS abruptly, leaving the other partners with few good options for a controlled reentry. In June 2024, NASA selected SpaceX to develop the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle, a contract potentially worth $843 million. The vehicle will consist of an existing Cargo Dragon spacecraft which will be paired with a significantly lengthened trunk module which will be equipped with 46 Draco thrusters (instead of the normal 16) and will carry of propellant, nearly six times the normal load. NASA is still working to secure all the necessary funding to build, launch and operate the deorbit vehicle.

===Post mission proposals and plans===
The follow-up to NASA&#x27;s program/strategy is the Commercial LEO Destinations Program, meant to allow private industry to build and maintain their own stations, and NASA procuring access as a customer, starting in 2028. Similarly, the ESA has been seeking new private space stations to provide orbital services, as well as retrieve materials, from the ISS. Axiom Station is planned to begin as a single module temporarily hosted at the ISS in 2027. Additionally, there have been suggestions in the commercial space industry that the ISS could be converted to commercial operations after it is retired by government entities, including turning it into a space hotel.

Russia previously has planned to use its orbital segment for the construction of its OPSEK station after the ISS is decommissioned. The modules under consideration for removal from the current ISS included the Multipurpose Laboratory Module (&quot;Nauka&quot;; &quot;MLM&quot;), launched in July 2021, and the other new Russian modules that are proposed to be attached to &quot;Nauka&quot;. These newly launched modules would still be well within their useful lives in 2024. At the end of 2011, the Exploration Gateway Platform concept also proposed using leftover USOS hardware and &quot;Zvezda 2&quot; as a refuelling depot and service station located at one of the Earth–Moon Lagrange points. However, the entire USOS was not designed for disassembly and will be discarded.

Western space industry has suggested in 2022 using the ISS as a platform to develop orbital salvage capacities, by companies such as CisLunar Industries working on using space debris as fuel, instead of plunging it into the ocean.

NASA has stated that by July 2024 it has not seen any viable proposals for reuse of the ISS or parts of it.

==Cost==
The ISS has been described as the most expensive single item ever constructed. As of 2010, the total cost was US$150 billion. This includes NASA&#x27;s budget of $58.7 billion ($89.73 billion in 2021 dollars) for the station from 1985 to 2015, Russia&#x27;s $12 billion, Europe&#x27;s $5 billion, Japan&#x27;s $5 billion, Canada&#x27;s $2 billion, and the cost of 36 shuttle flights to build the station, estimated at $1.4 billion each, or $50.4 billion in total. Assuming 20,000 man-days of use from 2000 to 2015 by two- to six-person crews, each man-day would cost $7.5 million, less than half the inflation-adjusted $19.6 million ($5.5 million before inflation) per man-day of Skylab.

== In culture ==
The ISS has become an international symbol of human capabilities, particularly human cooperation and science, defining a cooperative international approach and period, instead of a looming commercialized and militarized interplanetary world.

===In film===
Beside numerous documentaries such as the IMAX documentaries &quot;Space Station 3D&quot; from 2002, or &quot;A Beautiful Planet&quot; from 2016, and films like &quot;Apogee of Fear&quot; (2012) and &quot;Yolki 5&quot; (2016) the ISS is the subject of feature films such as &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; (2004), &quot;Love&quot; (2011), together with the Chinese station Tiangong 1 in &quot;Gravity&quot; (2013), &quot;Life&quot; (2017), and &quot;I.S.S.&quot; (2023).

In 2022, the movie &quot;The Challenge&quot; (&quot;Doctor&#x27;s House Call&quot;) was filmed aboard the ISS, and was notable for being the first feature film in which both professional actors and director worked together in space.

<text>Cosmicomics () is a collection of twelve short stories by Italo Calvino first published in Italian in 1965 and in English in 1968. The stories were originally published between 1964 and 1965 in the Italian periodicals &quot;Il Caffè&quot; and &quot;Il Giorno&quot;. Each story takes a scientific theory (some of which have since become deprecated) or phenomenon and builds an imaginative story around it. An always-extant being called Qfwfq explicitly narrates all of the stories save two. Every story is a memory of an event in the history of the universe.

All of the stories in &quot;Cosmicomics&quot;, together with more of Qfwfq stories from &quot;t zero&quot; and other sources, are now available in a single volume collection, &quot;The Complete Cosmicomics&quot; (Penguin UK, 2009).

The first U.S. edition, translated by William Weaver, won the National Book Award in the Translation category.

==Contents==
* &quot;The Distance of the Moon&quot;, the first and probably the best known story. Calvino takes the fact that the Moon used to be much closer to the Earth, and builds a story about a love triangle among people who used to jump between the Earth and the Moon; the lovers gradually drift apart as the Moon recedes.
* &quot;At Daybreak&quot;: Life in a nebula before gas condenses into solid matter, a process which ultimately leads to the formation of solar systems.
* &quot;A Sign in Space&quot;: The fact that the galaxy slowly revolves is the premise of a story about a being desperate to leave behind some unique sign of its existence. This story is a direct illustration of one of the tenets of postmodern theory—that the sign is not the thing it signifies, nor can one claim to fully or properly describe a thing or an idea with a word or other symbol.
* &quot;All at One Point&quot;: The fact that before the Big Bang the cosmos existed as a single point (the initial singularity. &quot;Naturally, we were all there—old Qfwfq said—where else could we have been? Nobody knew then that there could be space. Or time, either: what use did we have for time, packed in there like sardines?&quot;
* &quot;Without Colors&quot;: Before there was an atmosphere, everything was the same shade of gray. As the atmosphere gradually appears, so do colors. Unfortunately the novelty scares off Ayl, Qfwfq&#x27;s love interest.
* &quot;Games Without End&quot;: A galactic game of marbles played using Hydrogen atoms, before the universe had created other materials.
* &quot;The Aquatic Uncle&quot;: A tale on the fact that at one stage in evolution animals left the sea and came to live on land. The story is about a family living on land that is a bit ashamed of their old uncle who still lives in the sea, refusing to come ashore like &quot;civilized&quot; people.
* &quot;How Much Shall We Bet&quot;: Qfwfq bets against his rival Dean (k)yK about the universe&#x27;s transformations, making increasingly long-term and specific conjectures.
* &quot;The Dinosaurs&quot;: How some dinosaurs lived after most of them had become extinct, and how it felt to be that last existing dinosaur in an age where all the current mammals feared his kind as demons.
* &quot;The Form of Space&quot;: As the unnamed narrator &quot;falls&quot; through space, he cannot help but notice that his trajectory is parallel to that of a beautiful woman, Ursula H&#x27;x, and that of lieutenant Fenimore, who is also in love with Ursula. The narrator dreams of the shape of space changing, so that he may touch Ursula (or fight with Fenimore).
* &quot;The Light Years&quot;: The unnamed narrator looking at other galaxies spots one with a sign pointed right at him saying &quot;I saw you.&quot; Given that there&#x27;s a gulf of 100,000,000 light years, he checks his diary to find out what he had been doing that day eons ago, and finds out that it was something he had wished to hide. He then starts to worry.
* &quot;The Spiral&quot;: A story about life as a mollusc who creates the first shell. By creating this object of beauty to behold, he enables the development of vision in other creatures and sets off a chain reaction leading to the present day.

All of the stories feature non-human characters who have been heavily anthropomorphized.

==Adaptations==
&quot;&quot;La Luna&quot; by Enrico Casarosa, 2011&quot; is a short film based on the same premise as &quot;The Distance of the Moon.&quot;

<text>IA-32 (short for &quot;Intel Architecture, 32-bit&quot;, commonly called &quot;i386&quot;) is the 32-bit version of the x86 instruction set architecture, designed by Intel and first implemented in the 80386 microprocessor in 1985. IA-32 is the first incarnation of x86 that supports 32-bit computing; as a result, the &quot;IA-32&quot; term may be used as a metonym to refer to all x86 versions that support 32-bit computing.

Within various programming language directives, IA-32 is still sometimes referred to as the &quot;i386&quot; architecture. In some other contexts, certain iterations of the IA-32 ISA are sometimes labelled &quot;i486&quot;, &quot;i586&quot; and &quot;i686&quot;, referring to the instruction supersets offered by the 80486, the P5 and the P6 microarchitectures respectively. These updates offered numerous additions alongside the base IA-32 set including floating-point capabilities and the MMX extensions.

Intel was historically the largest manufacturer of IA-32 processors, with the second biggest supplier having been AMD. During the 1990s, VIA, Transmeta and other chip manufacturers also produced IA-32 compatible processors (e.g. WinChip). In the modern era, Intel still produced IA-32 processors under the Intel Quark microcontroller platform until 2019; however, since the 2000s, the majority of manufacturers (Intel included) moved almost exclusively to implementing CPUs based on the 64-bit variant of x86, x86-64. x86-64, by specification, offers legacy operating modes that operate on the IA-32 ISA for backwards compatibility. Even given the contemporary prevalence of x86-64, as of today, IA-32 protected mode versions of many modern operating systems are still maintained, e.g. Microsoft Windows (until Windows 10), Windows Server (until Windows Server 2008) and the Debian Linux distribution. In spite of IA-32&#x27;s name (and causing some potential confusion), the 64-bit evolution of x86 that originated out of AMD would not be known as &quot;IA-64&quot;, that name instead belonging to Intel&#x27;s discontinued Itanium architecture.

== Architectural features ==

The primary defining characteristic of IA-32 is the availability of 32-bit general-purpose processor registers (for example, EAX and EBX), 32-bit integer arithmetic and logical operations, 32-bit offsets within a segment in protected mode, and the translation of segmented addresses to 32-bit linear addresses. The designers took the opportunity to make other improvements as well. Some of the most significant changes (relative to the 16-bit 286 instruction set) are:

; 32-bit integer capability: All general-purpose registers (GPRs) are expanded from 16 bits to 32 bits, and all arithmetic and logical operations, memory-to-register and register-to-memory operations, etc., can operate directly on 32-bit integers. Pushes and pops on the stack default to 4-byte strides, and non-segmented pointers are 4 bytes wide.
; More general addressing modes: Any GPR can be used as a base register, and any GPR other than ESP can be used as an index register, in a memory reference. The index register value can be multiplied by 1, 2, 4, or 8 before being added to the base register value and displacement.
; Additional segment registers: Two additional segment registers, FS and GS, are provided.
; Larger virtual address space: The IA-32 architecture defines a 48-bit segmented address format, with a 16-bit segment number and a 32-bit offset within the segment. Segmented addresses are mapped to 32-bit linear addresses.
; Demand paging: 32-bit linear addresses are virtual addresses rather than physical addresses; they are translated to physical addresses through a page table. In the 80386, 80486, and the original Pentium processors, the physical address was 32 bits; in the Pentium Pro and later processors, the Physical Address Extension allowed 36-bit physical addresses, although the linear address size was still 32 bits.

<text>Internalism and externalism are two opposite ways of integration of explaining various subjects in several areas of philosophy. These include human motivation, knowledge, justification, meaning, and truth. The distinction arises in many areas of debate with similar but distinct meanings. Internal–external distinction is a distinction used in philosophy to divide an ontology into two parts: an internal part concerning observation related to philosophy, and an external part concerning question related to philosophy.

Internalism is the thesis that no fact about the world can provide reasons for action independently of desires and beliefs. Externalism is the thesis that reasons are to be identified with objective features of the world.

== Moral philosophy ==

=== Motivation ===

In contemporary moral philosophy, motivational internalism (or moral internalism) is the view that moral convictions (which are not necessarily beliefs, e.g. feelings of moral approval or disapproval) are intrinsically motivating. That is, the motivational internalist believes that there is an internal, necessary connection between one&#x27;s conviction that X ought to be done and one&#x27;s motivation to do X. Conversely, the motivational externalist (or moral externalist) claims that there is no necessary internal connection between moral convictions and moral motives. That is, there is no necessary connection between the conviction that X is wrong and the motivational drive not to do X. (The use of these terms has roots in W.D. Falk&#x27;s (1947) paper &quot;&#x27;Ought&#x27; and Motivation&quot;).

These views in moral psychology have various implications. In particular, if motivational internalism is true, then amorality is unintelligible (and metaphysically impossible). An amoralist is not simply someone who is immoral, rather it is someone who knows what the moral things to do are, yet is not motivated to do them. Such an agent is unintelligible to the motivational internalist, because moral judgments about the right thing to do have built into them corresponding motivations to do those things that are judged by the agent to be the moral things to do. On the other hand, an amoralist is entirely intelligible to the motivational &quot;externalist&quot;, because the motivational externalist thinks that moral judgments about what is right do not necessitate some motivation to do those things that are judged to be the right thing to do; rather, an independent desire—such as the desire to do the right thing—is required (Brink, 2003), (Rosati, 2006).

=== Reasons ===
There is also a distinction in ethics and action theory, largely made popular by Bernard Williams (1979, reprinted in 1981), concerning internal and external reasons for an action. An &quot;internal reason&quot; is, roughly, something that one has in light of one&#x27;s own &quot;subjective motivational set&quot;—one&#x27;s own commitments, desires (or wants), goals, etc. On the other hand, an &quot;external reason&quot; is something that one has independent of one&#x27;s subjective motivational set. For example, suppose that Sally is going to drink a glass of poison, because she wants to commit suicide and believes that she can do so by drinking the poison. Sally has an internal reason to drink the poison, because she wants to commit suicide. However, one might say that she has an external reason not to drink the poison because, even though she wants to die, one ought not to kill oneself no matter what—regardless of whether one wants to die.

Some philosophers embrace the existence of both kinds of reason, while others deny the existence of one or the other. For example, Bernard Williams (1981) argues that there are really only internal reasons for action. Such a view is called &quot;internalism about reasons&quot; (or &quot;reasons internalism&quot;). &quot;Externalism about reasons&quot; (or &quot;reasons externalism&quot;) is the denial of reasons internalism. It is the view that there are external reasons for action; that is, there are reasons for action that one can have even if the action is not part of one&#x27;s subjective motivational set.

Consider the following situation. Suppose that it&#x27;s against the moral law to steal from the poor, and Sasha knows this. However, Sasha doesn&#x27;t desire to follow the moral law, and there is currently a poor person next to him. Is it intelligible to say that Sasha has a reason to follow the moral law right now (to not steal from the poor person next to him), even though he doesn&#x27;t care to do so? The reasons externalist answers in the affirmative (&quot;Yes, Sasha has a reason not to steal from that poor person.&quot;), since he believes that one can have reasons for action even if one does not have the relevant desire. Conversely, the reasons internalist answers the question in the negative (&quot;No, Sasha does not have a reason not to steal from that poor person, though others might.&quot;). The reasons internalist claims that external reasons are unintelligible; one has a reason for action only if one has the relevant desire (that is, only internal reasons can be reasons for action). The reasons internalist claims the following: the moral facts are a reason &quot;for Sasha&#x27;s action&quot; not to steal from the poor person next to him only if he currently &quot;wants&quot; to follow the moral law (or if not stealing from the poor person is a way to satisfy his other current goals—that is, part of what Williams calls his &quot;subjective motivational set&quot;). In short, the reasoning behind reasons internalism, according to Williams, is that reasons for action must be able to explain one&#x27;s action; and only internal reasons can do this.

== Epistemology ==

=== Justification ===

==== Internalism ====
Two main varieties of epistemic internalism about justification are access internalism and ontological internalism. Access internalists require that a believer must have internal access to the justifier(s) of their belief &quot;p&quot; in order to be justified in believing &quot;p&quot;. For the access internalist, justification amounts to something like the believer being aware (or capable of being aware) of certain facts that make her belief in &quot;p&quot; rational, or them being able to give reasons for her belief in &quot;p&quot;. At minimum, access internalism requires that the believer have some kind of reflective access or awareness to whatever justifies her belief. Ontological internalism is the view that justification for a belief is established by one&#x27;s mental states. Ontological internalism can be distinct from access internalism, but the two are often thought to go together since we are generally considered to be capable of having reflective access to mental states.

One popular argument for internalism is known as the &#x27;new evil demon problem&#x27;. The new evil demon problem indirectly supports internalism by challenging externalist views of justification, particularly reliabilism. The argument asks us to imagine a subject with beliefs and experiences identical to ours, but the subject is being systematically deceived by a malicious Cartesian demon so that all their beliefs turn out false. In spite of the subject&#x27;s unfortunate deception, the argument goes, we do not think this subject ceases to be rational in taking things to be as they appear as we do. After all, it is possible that we could be radically deceived in the same way, yet we are still justified in holding most of our beliefs in spite of this possibility. Since reliabilism maintains that one&#x27;s beliefs are justified via reliable belief-forming processes (where reliable means yielding true beliefs), the subject in the evil demon scenario would not likely have any justified beliefs according to reliabilism because all of their beliefs would be false. Since this result is supposed to clash with our intuitions that the subject is justified in their beliefs in spite of being systematically deceived, some take the new evil demon problem as a reason for rejecting externalist views of justification.

==== Externalism ====
Externalist views of justification emerged in epistemology during the late 20th century. Externalist conceptions of justification assert that facts external to the believer can serve as the justification for a belief. According to the externalist, a believer need not have any internal access or cognitive grasp of any reasons or facts which make their belief justified. The externalist&#x27;s assessment of justification can be contrasted with access internalism, which demands that the believer have internal reflective access to reasons or facts which corroborate their belief in order to be justified in holding it. Externalism, on the other hand, maintains that the justification for someone&#x27;s belief can come from facts that are entirely external to the agent&#x27;s subjective awareness.

Alvin Goldman, one of the most well-known proponents of externalism in epistemology, is known for developing a popular form of externalism called reliabilism. In his paper, “What is Justified Belief?” Goldman characterizes the reliabilist conception of justification as such:

&quot;If S’s believing &quot;p&quot; at &quot;t&quot; results from a reliable cognitive belief-forming process (or set of processes), then S’s belief in &quot;p&quot; at &quot;t&quot; is justified.”

Goldman notes that a reliable belief-forming process is one which generally produces true beliefs.

A unique consequence of reliabilism (and other forms of externalism) is that one can have a justified belief without knowing one is justified (this is not possible under most forms of epistemic internalism). In addition, we do not yet know which cognitive processes are in fact reliable, so anyone who embraces reliabilism must concede that we do not always know whether some of our beliefs are justified (even though there is a fact of the matter).

=== As a response to skepticism ===
In responding to skepticism, Hilary Putnam (1982) claims that semantic externalism yields &quot;an argument we can give that shows we are not brains in a vat (BIV). (See also DeRose, 1999.) If semantic externalism is true, then the meaning of a word or sentence is not wholly determined by what individuals think those words mean. For example, semantic externalists maintain that the word &quot;water&quot; referred to the substance whose chemical composition is H2O even before scientists had discovered that chemical composition. The fact that the substance out in the world we were calling &quot;water&quot; actually had that composition at least partially determined the meaning of the word. One way to use this in a response to skepticism is to apply the same strategy to the terms used in a skeptical argument in the following way (DeRose, 1999):

To clarify how this argument is supposed to work: Imagine that there is brain in a vat, and a whole world is being simulated for it. Call the individual who is being deceived &quot;Steve.&quot; When Steve is given an experience of walking through a park, semantic externalism allows for his thought, &quot;I am walking through a park&quot; to be true so long as the simulated reality is one in which he is walking through a park. Similarly, what it takes for his thought, &quot;I am a brain in a vat,&quot; to be true is for the simulated reality to be one where he is a brain in a vat. But in the simulated reality, he is not a brain in a vat.

Apart from disputes over the success of the argument or the plausibility of the specific type of semantic externalism required for it to work, there is question as to what is gained by defeating the skeptical worry with this strategy. Skeptics can give new skeptical cases that wouldn&#x27;t be subject to the same response (e.g., one where the person was very recently turned into a brain in a vat, so that their words &quot;brain&quot; and &quot;vat&quot; still pick out real brains and vats, rather than simulated ones). Further, if even brains in vats can correctly believe &quot;I am not a brain in a vat,&quot; then the skeptic can still press us on how we know we are not in that situation (though the externalist will point out that it may be difficult for the skeptic to describe that situation).

Another attempt to use externalism to refute skepticism is done by Brueckner and Warfield. It involves the claim that our thoughts are &quot;about&quot; things, unlike a BIV&#x27;s thoughts, which cannot be &quot;about&quot; things (DeRose, 1999).

== Semantics ==

Semantic externalism comes in two varieties, depending on whether meaning is construed cognitively or linguistically. On a cognitive construal, externalism is the thesis that what concepts (or contents) are available to a thinker is determined by their environment, or their relation to their environment. On a linguistic construal, externalism is the thesis that the meaning of a word is environmentally determined. Likewise, one can construe semantic internalism in two ways, as a denial of either of these two theses.

Externalism and internalism in semantics is closely tied to the distinction in philosophy of mind concerning mental content, since the contents of one&#x27;s thoughts (specifically, intentional mental states) are usually taken to be semantic objects that are truth-evaluable.

== Philosophy of mind ==

Within the context of the philosophy of mind, externalism is the theory that the contents of at least some of one&#x27;s mental states are dependent in part on their relationship to the external world or one&#x27;s environment.

The traditional discussion on externalism was centered around the semantic aspect of mental content. This is by no means the only meaning of externalism now. Externalism is now a broad collection of philosophical views considering all aspects of mental content and activity. There are various forms of externalism that consider either the content or the vehicles of the mind or both. Furthermore, externalism could be limited to cognition, or it could address broader issues of consciousness.

As to the traditional discussion on semantic externalism (often dubbed &quot;content externalism&quot;), some mental states, such as believing that water is wet, and fearing that the Queen has been insulted, have contents we can capture using &#x27;that&#x27; clauses. The content externalist often appeal to observations found as early as Hilary Putnam&#x27;s seminal essay, &quot;The Meaning of &#x27;Meaning&#x27;,&quot; (1975). Putnam stated that we can easily imagine pairs of individuals that are microphysical duplicates embedded in different surroundings who use the same words but mean different things when using them.

For example, suppose that Ike and Tina&#x27;s mothers are identical twins and that Ike and Tina are raised in isolation from one another in indistinguishable environments. When Ike says, &quot;I want my mommy,&quot; he expresses a want satisfied only if he is brought to his mommy. If we brought Tina&#x27;s mommy, Ike might not notice the difference, but he doesn&#x27;t get what he wants. It seems that what he wants and what he says when he says, &quot;I want my mommy,&quot; will be different from what Tina wants and what she says she wants when she says, &quot;I want my mommy.&quot;

Externalists say that if we assume competent speakers know what they think, and say what they think, the difference in what these two speakers mean corresponds to a difference in the thoughts of the two speakers that is not (necessarily) reflected by a difference in the internal make up of the speakers or thinkers. They urge us to move from externalism about meaning of the sort Putnam defended to externalism about contentful states of mind. The example pertains to singular terms, but has been extended to cover kind terms as well such as natural kinds (e.g., &#x27;water&#x27;) and for kinds of artifacts (e.g., &#x27;espresso maker&#x27;). There is no general agreement amongst content externalists as to the scope of the thesis.

Philosophers now tend to distinguish between &quot;wide content&quot; (externalist mental content) and &quot;narrow content&quot; (anti-externalist mental content). Some, then, align themselves as endorsing one view of content exclusively, or both. For example, Jerry Fodor (1980) argues for narrow content (although he comes to reject that view in his 1995), while David Chalmers (2002) argues for a two dimensional semantics according to which the contents of mental states can have both wide and narrow content.

Critics of the view have questioned the original thought experiments saying that the lessons that Putnam and later writers such as Tyler Burge (1979, 1982) have urged us to draw can be resisted. Frank Jackson and John Searle, for example, have defended internalist accounts of thought content according to which the contents of our thoughts are fixed by descriptions that pick out the individuals and kinds that our thoughts intuitively pertain to the sorts of things that we take them to. In the Ike/Tina example, one might agree that Ike&#x27;s thoughts pertain to Ike&#x27;s mother and that Tina&#x27;s thoughts pertain to Tina&#x27;s but insist that this is because Ike thinks of that woman as his mother and we can capture this by saying that he thinks of her as &#x27;the mother of the speaker&#x27;. This descriptive phrase will pick out one unique woman. Externalists claim this is implausible, as we would have to ascribe to Ike knowledge he wouldn&#x27;t need to successfully think about or refer to his mother.

Critics have also claimed that content externalists are committed to epistemological absurdities. Suppose that a speaker can have the concept of water we do only if the speaker lives in a world that contains H2O. It seems this speaker could know a priori that they think that water is wet. This is the thesis of privileged access. It also seems that they could know on the basis of simple thought experiments that they can only think that water is wet if they live in a world that contains water. What would prevent her from putting these together and coming to know a priori that the world contains water? If we should say that no one could possibly know whether water exists a priori, it seems either we cannot know content externalism to be true on the basis of thought experiments or we cannot know what we are thinking without first looking into the world to see what it is like.

As mentioned, content externalism (limited to the semantic aspects) is only one among many other options offered by externalism by and large.

== Historiography of science ==

Internalism in the historiography of science claims that science is completely distinct from social influences and pure natural science can exist in any society and at any time given the intellectual capacity. Imre Lakatos is a notable proponent of historiographical internalism.

Externalism in the historiography of science is the view that the history of science is due to its social context – the socio-political climate and the surrounding economy determines scientific progress. Thomas Kuhn is a notable proponent of historiographical externalism.
