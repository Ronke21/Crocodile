<text>The King James Version (KJV), also the King James Bible (KJB) and the Authorized Version (AV), is an Early Modern English translation of the Christian Bible for the Church of England, which was commissioned in 1604 and published in 1611, by sponsorship of King James VI and I. The 80 books of the King James Version include 39 books of the Old Testament, 14 books of Apocrypha, and the 27 books of the New Testament. 

Noted for its &quot;majesty of style&quot;, the King James Version has been described as one of the most important books in English culture and a driving force in the shaping of the English-speaking world. The King James Version remains the preferred translation of many Protestant Christians, and is considered the only valid one by some Evangelicals. It is considered one of the important literary accomplishments of early modern England.

The KJV was the third translation into English approved by the English Church authorities: The first had been the Great Bible (1535), and the second had been the Bishops&#x27; Bible (1568). In Switzerland the first generation of Protestant Reformers had produced the Geneva Bible which was published in 1560 having referred to the original Hebrew and Greek scriptures, which was influential in the writing of the Authorized King James Version.

The English Church initially used the officially sanctioned &quot;Bishops&#x27; Bible&quot;, which was hardly used by the population. More popular was the named &quot;Geneva Bible&quot;, which was created on the basis of the Tyndale translation in Geneva under the direct successor of the reformer John Calvin for his English followers. However, their footnotes represented a Calvinistic Puritanism that was too radical for James. The translators of the Geneva Bible had translated the word &quot;king&quot; as &quot;tyrant&quot; about four hundred times, while the word only appears three times in the KJV. Because of this, some have claimed that King James purposely had the translators omit the word, though there is no evidence to support this claim. As the word &quot;tyrant&quot; has no equivalent in ancient Hebrew, there is no case where the translation would be required.

James convened the Hampton Court Conference in January 1604, where a new English version was conceived in response to the problems of the earlier translations perceived by the Puritans, a faction of the Church of England. James gave translators instructions intended to ensure the new version would conform to the ecclesiology, and reflect the episcopal structure, of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament from Hebrew and Aramaic, and the Apocrypha from Greek and Latin. In the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, the text of the &quot;Authorized Version&quot; replaced the text of the Great Bible for Epistle and Gospel readings, and as such was authorized by an Act of Parliament.

By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version had become effectively unchallenged as the only English translation used in Anglican and other English Protestant churches, except for the Psalms and some short passages in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; of the Church of England. Over the 18th century, the &quot;Authorized Version&quot; supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English-speaking scholars. With the development of stereotype printing at the beginning of the 19th century, this version of the Bible had become the most widely printed book in history, almost all such printings presenting the standard text of 1769, and nearly always omitting the books of the Apocrypha. Today the unqualified title &quot;King James Version&quot; usually indicates this Oxford standard text.

==Name==
The title of the first edition of the translation, in Early Modern English, was &quot;THE HOLY BIBLE, Conteyning the Old Teſtament, &quot;AND THE NEW: Newly Tranſlated out of the Originall tongues: &amp; with the former Tranſlations diligently compared and reuiſed, by his Maiesties ſpeciall Cõmandement&quot;&quot;. The title page carries the words &quot;Appointed to be read in Churches&quot;, and F. F. Bruce suggests it was &quot;probably authorised by order in council&quot;, but no record of the authorisation survives &quot;because the Privy Council registers from 1600 to 1613 were destroyed by fire in January 1618/19&quot;.

For many years it was common not to give the translation any specific name. In his &quot;Leviathan&quot; of 1651, Thomas Hobbes referred to it as &quot;the English Translation made in the beginning of the Reign of King James&quot;. A 1761 &quot;Brief Account of the various Translations of the Bible into English&quot; refers to the 1611 version merely as &quot;a new, compleat, and more accurate Translation&quot;, despite referring to the Great Bible by its name, and despite using the name &quot;Rhemish Testament&quot; for the Douay–Rheims Bible version. Similarly, a &quot;History of England&quot;, whose fifth edition was published in 1775, writes merely that &quot;[a] new translation of the Bible, &quot;viz.&quot;, that now in Use, was begun in 1607, and published in 1611&quot;.

King James&#x27;s Bible is used as the name for the 1611 translation (on a par with the Genevan Bible or the Rhemish Testament) in Charles Butler&#x27;s &quot;Horae Biblicae&quot; (first published 1797). Other works from the early 19th century confirm the widespread use of this name on both sides of the Atlantic: it is found both in a &quot;historical sketch of the English translations of the Bible&quot; published in Massachusetts in 1815 and in an English publication from 1818, which explicitly states that the 1611 version is &quot;generally known by the name of King James&#x27;s Bible&quot;. This name was also found as King James&#x27; Bible (without the final &quot;s&quot;): for example in a book review from 1811. The phrase &quot;King James&#x27;s Bible&quot; is used as far back as 1715, although in this case it is not clear whether this is a name or merely a description.

The use of Authorized Version, capitalized and used as a name, is found as early as 1814. For some time before this, descriptive phrases such as &quot;our present, and only publicly authorised version&quot; (1783), &quot;our Authorized version&quot; (1731, 1792) and &quot;the authorized version&quot; (1801, uncapitalized) are found. A more common appellation in the 17th and 18th centuries was &quot;our English translation&quot; or &quot;our English version&quot;, as can be seen by searching one or other of the major online archives of printed books. In Britain, the 1611 translation is generally known as the &quot;Authorized Version&quot; today. The term is somewhat of a misnomer because the text itself was never formally &quot;authorized&quot;, nor were English parish churches ever ordered to procure copies of it.

King James&#x27; Version, evidently a descriptive phrase, is found being used as early as 1814. &quot;The King James Version&quot; is found, unequivocally used as a name, in a letter from 1855. The next year King James Bible, with no possessive, appears as a name in a Scottish source. In the United States, the &quot;1611 translation&quot; (actually editions following the standard text of 1769, see below) is generally known as the King James Version today.

==History==
===Earlier English translations===
There were several translations into Middle English of large portions of Scriptures in the 14th Century, with the first complete bibles probably being made by the followers of John Wycliffe. These translations were effectively but not formally banned in 1409 due to their association with the Lollards. The Wycliffite Bibles pre-dated the printing press but were circulated very widely in manuscript form.
In 1525, William Tyndale, an English contemporary of Martin Luther, undertook a translation of the New Testament into Early Modern English. Tyndale&#x27;s translation was the first printed Bible in English. Over the next ten years, Tyndale revised his New Testament in the light of rapidly advancing biblical scholarship, and embarked on a translation of the Old Testament. Despite some controversial translation choices, and in spite of Tyndale&#x27;s execution on charges of heresy for being a Lutheran, the merits of Tyndale&#x27;s work and prose style made his translation the ultimate basis for all subsequent renditions into Early Modern English.

With these translations lightly edited and adapted by Myles Coverdale to remove offensive notes, in 1539, Tyndale&#x27;s New Testament and his incomplete work on the Old Testament became the basis for the Great Bible. This was the first &quot;authorised version&quot; issued by the Church of England during the reign of King Henry VIII. When Mary I succeeded to the throne in 1553, she returned the Church of England to the communion of the Catholic faith and many English religious reformers fled the country, some establishing an English-speaking community in the Protestant city of Geneva. Under the leadership of John Calvin, Geneva became the chief international centre of Reformed Protestantism and Latin biblical scholarship.

These English expatriates undertook a translation that became known as the Geneva Bible. This translation, dated to 1560, was a revision of Tyndale&#x27;s Bible and the Great Bible on the basis of the original languages. Soon after Elizabeth I took the throne in 1558, problems with both the Great and Geneva Bibles (namely, that the latter did not &quot;conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its beliefs about an ordained clergy&quot;) became apparent to church authorities. In 1568, the Church of England responded with the Bishops&#x27; Bible, a revision of the Great Bible in the light of the Geneva version.

While officially approved, this new version failed to displace the Geneva translation as the most popular English Bible of the age, in part because the full Bible was printed only in lectern editions of prodigious size and at a cost of several pounds. Accordingly, Elizabethan lay people overwhelmingly read the Bible in the Geneva Version, as small editions were available at a relatively low cost. At the same time, there was a substantial clandestine importation of the rival Douay–Rheims New Testament of 1582, undertaken by exiled Catholics. This translation, though still derived from Tyndale, claimed to represent the text of the Latin Vulgate.

In May 1601, King James VI of Scotland attended the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland at Saint Columba&#x27;s Church in Burntisland, Fife, at which proposals were put forward for a new translation of the Bible into English. Two years later, he ascended to the throne of England as James I.

===Considerations for a new version===
The newly crowned King James convened the Hampton Court Conference in 1604. That gathering proposed a new English version in response to the perceived problems of earlier translations as detected by the Puritan faction of the Church of England. Here are three examples of problems the Puritans perceived with the &quot;Bishops&quot; and &quot;Great Bibles&quot;:

Instructions were given to the translators that were intended to use formal equivalence and limit the Puritan influence on this new translation. The Bishop of London added a qualification that the translators would add no marginal notes (which had been an issue in the &quot;Geneva Bible&quot;). King James cited two passages in the Geneva translation where he found the marginal notes offensive to the principles of divinely ordained royal supremacy: Exodus 1:19, where the &quot;Geneva Bible&quot; notes had commended the example of civil disobedience to the Egyptian Pharaoh showed by the Hebrew midwives, and also II Chronicles 15:16, where the &quot;Geneva Bible&quot; had criticized King Asa for not having executed his idolatrous &#x27;mother&#x27;, Queen Maachah (Maachah had actually been Asa&#x27;s grandmother, but James considered the Geneva Bible reference as sanctioning the execution of his own mother Mary, Queen of Scots).

Further, the King gave the translators instructions designed to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology of the Church of England. Certain Greek and Hebrew words were to be translated in a manner that reflected the traditional usage of the church. For example, old ecclesiastical words such as the word &quot;church&quot; were to be retained and not to be translated as &quot;congregation&quot;. The new translation would reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and traditional beliefs about ordained clergy.

The source material for the translation of the New Testament was the Textus Receptus version of the Greek compiled by Erasmus; for the Old Testament, the Masoretic text of the Hebrew was used; for some of the apocrypha, the Septuagint Greek text was used, or for apocrypha for which the Greek was unavailable, the Vulgate Latin.

James&#x27; instructions included several requirements that kept the new translation familiar to its listeners and readers. The text of the &quot;Bishops&#x27; Bible&quot; would serve as the primary guide for the translators, and the familiar proper names of the biblical characters would all be retained. If the &quot;Bishops&#x27; Bible&quot; was deemed problematic in any situation, the translators were permitted to consult other translations from a pre-approved list: the &quot;Tyndale Bible&quot;, the &quot;Coverdale Bible&quot;, &quot;Matthew&#x27;s Bible&quot;, the &quot;Great Bible&quot;, and the &quot;Geneva Bible&quot;. In addition, later scholars have detected an influence on the &quot;Authorized Version&quot; from the translations of &quot;Taverner&#x27;s Bible&quot; and the New Testament of the &quot;Douay–Rheims Bible.&quot;

It is for this reason that the flyleaf of most printings of the &quot;Authorized Version&quot; observes that the text had been &quot;translated out of the original tongues, and with the former translations diligently compared and revised, by His Majesty&#x27;s special commandment.&quot; As the work proceeded, more detailed rules were adopted as to how variant and uncertain readings in the Hebrew and Greek source texts should be indicated, including the requirement that words supplied in English to &#x27;complete the meaning&#x27; of the originals should be printed in a different type face.

===Translation committees===
The task of translation was undertaken by 47 scholars, although 54 were originally approved. All were members of the Church of England and all except Sir Henry Savile were clergy. The scholars worked in six committees, two based in each of the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, and Westminster. The committees included scholars with Puritan sympathies, as well as high churchmen. Forty unbound copies of the 1602 edition of the &quot;Bishops&#x27; Bible&quot; were specially printed so that the agreed changes of each committee could be recorded in the margins.

The committees worked on certain parts separately and the drafts produced by each committee were then compared and revised for harmony with each other. The scholars were not paid directly for their translation work. Instead, a circular letter was sent to bishops encouraging them to consider the translators for appointment to well-paid livings as these fell vacant. Several were supported by the various colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, while others were promoted to bishoprics, deaneries and prebends through royal patronage.

On 22 July 1604 King James VI and I sent a letter to Archbishop Bancroft asking him to contact all English churchmen requesting that they make donations to his project.

The six committees started work towards the end of 1604. The Apocrypha committee finishing first, and all six completed their sections by 1608. From January 1609, a General Committee of Review met at Stationers&#x27; Hall, London to review the completed marked texts from each of the committees, and were paid for their attendance by the Stationers&#x27; Company. The General Committee included John Bois, Andrew Downes, John Harmar, and others known only by their initials, including &quot;AL&quot; (who may be Arthur Lake). John Bois prepared a note of their deliberations (in Latin) – which has partly survived in two later transcripts. Also surviving of the translators&#x27; working papers are a bound set of marked-up corrections to one of the forty &quot;Bishops&#x27; Bibles&quot;—covering the Old Testament and Gospels; and also a manuscript translation of the text of the Epistles, excepting those verses where no change was being recommended to the readings in the &quot;Bishops&#x27; Bible&quot;. Archbishop Bancroft insisted on having a final say making fourteen further changes, of which one was the term &quot;bishopricke&quot; at Acts 1:20.

* First Westminster Company, translated Genesis to 2 Kings: Lancelot Andrewes, John Overall, Hadrian à Saravia, Richard Clarke, John Layfield, Robert Tighe, Francis Burleigh, Geoffrey King, Richard Thomson, William Bedwell;
* First Cambridge Company, translated 1 Chronicles to the Song of Solomon: Edward Lively, John Richardson, Lawrence Chaderton, Francis Dillingham, Roger Andrewes, Thomas Harrison, Robert Spaulding, Andrew Bing;
* First Oxford Company, translated Isaiah to Malachi: John Harding, John Rainolds (or Reynolds), Thomas Holland, Richard Kilby, Miles Smith, Richard Brett, Daniel Fairclough, William Thorne;
* Second Oxford Company, translated the Gospels, Acts of the Apostles, and the Book of Revelation: Thomas Ravis, George Abbot, Richard Eedes, Giles Tomson, Sir Henry Savile, John Peryn, Ralph Ravens, John Harmar, John Aglionby, Leonard Hutten;
* Second Westminster Company, translated the Epistles: William Barlow, John Spenser, Roger Fenton, Ralph Hutchinson, William Dakins, Michael Rabbet, Thomas Sanderson (who probably had already become Archdeacon of Rochester);
* Second Cambridge Company, translated the Apocrypha: John Duport, William Branthwaite, Jeremiah Radcliffe, Samuel Ward, Andrew Downes, John Bois, Robert Ward, Thomas Bilson, Richard Bancroft.

===Printing===
The original printing of the &quot;Authorized Version&quot; was published by Robert Barker, the King&#x27;s Printer, in 1611 as a complete folio Bible. It was sold looseleaf for ten shillings, or bound for twelve. Robert Barker&#x27;s father, Christopher, had, in 1589, been granted by Elizabeth I the title of royal Printer, with the perpetual Royal Privilege to print Bibles in England. Robert Barker invested very large sums in printing the new edition, and consequently ran into serious debt, such that he was compelled to sub-lease the privilege to two rival London printers, Bonham Norton and John Bill. It appears that it was initially intended that each printer would print a portion of the text, share printed sheets with the others, and split the proceeds. Bitter financial disputes broke out, as Barker accused Norton and Bill of concealing their profits, while Norton and Bill accused Barker of selling sheets properly due to them as partial Bibles for ready money. There followed decades of continual litigation, and consequent imprisonment for debt for members of the Barker and Norton printing dynasties, while each issued rival editions of the whole Bible. In 1629 the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge successfully managed to assert separate and prior royal licences for Bible printing, for their own university presses—and Cambridge University took the opportunity to print revised editions of the &quot;Authorized Version&quot; in 1629, and 1638. The editors of these editions included John Bois and Samuel Ward from the original translators. This did not, however, impede the commercial rivalries of the London printers, especially as the Barker family refused to allow any other printers access to the authoritative manuscript of the &quot;Authorized Version&quot;.

Two editions of the whole Bible are recognized as having been produced in 1611, which may be distinguished by their rendering of Ruth 3:15; the first edition reading &quot;he went into the city&quot;, where the second reads &quot;she went into the city&quot;; these are known colloquially as the &quot;He&quot; and &quot;She&quot; Bibles.

The original printing was made before English spelling was standardized, and when printers, as a matter of course, expanded and contracted the spelling of the same words in different places, so as to achieve an even column of text. They set v for initial u and v, and u for u and v everywhere else. They used the long s (ſ) for non-final s. The letter or glyph j occurs only after i, as in the final letter in a Roman numeral, such as XIIJ. Punctuation was relatively heavy (frequent) and differed from modern practice. When space needed to be saved, the printers sometimes used &quot;ye&quot; for &quot;the&quot; (replacing the Middle English thorn, Þ, with the continental y), set ã for &quot;an&quot; or &quot;am&quot; (in the style of scribe&#x27;s shorthand), and set &amp; for &quot;and&quot;. In contrast, on a few occasions, they appear to have inserted these words when they thought a line needed to be padded. Later printings regularized these spellings; the punctuation has also been standardized, but still varies from current usage.

As can be seen in the example page on the left, the first printing used a blackletter typeface instead of a roman typeface, which itself made a political and a religious statement. Like the Great Bible and the Bishops&#x27; Bible, the Authorized Version was &quot;appointed to be read in churches&quot;. It was a large folio volume meant for public use, not private devotion; the weight of the type—blackletter type was heavy physically as well as visually—mirrored the weight of establishment authority behind it. However, smaller editions and roman-type editions followed rapidly, e.g. quarto roman-type editions of the Bible in 1612. This contrasted with the Geneva Bible, which was the first English Bible printed in a roman typeface (although black-letter editions, particularly in folio format, were issued later).

In contrast to the &quot;Geneva Bible&quot; and the &quot;Bishops&#x27; Bible&quot;, which had both been extensively illustrated, there were no illustrations in the 1611 edition of the Authorized Version, the main form of decoration being the historiated initial letters provided for books and chapterstogether with the decorative title pages to the Bible itself, and to the New Testament.

In the Great Bible, readings derived from the Vulgate but not found in published Hebrew and Greek texts had been distinguished by being printed in smaller roman type. In the Geneva Bible, a distinct typeface had instead been applied to distinguish text supplied by translators, or thought needful for English grammar but not present in the Greek or Hebrew; and the original printing of the Authorized Version used roman type for this purpose, albeit sparsely and inconsistently. This results in perhaps the most significant difference between the original printed text of the King James Bible and the current text. When, from the later 17th century onwards, the Authorized Version began to be printed in roman type, the typeface for supplied words was changed to italics, this application being regularized and greatly expanded. This was intended to de-emphasize the words.

The original printing contained two prefatory texts; the first was a formal &quot;&quot; to &quot;the most high and mighty Prince&quot; King James. Many British printings reproduce this, while most non-British printings do not.

The second preface was called &quot;&quot;, a long and learned essay that defends the undertaking of the new version. It observes the translators&#x27; stated goal, that they &quot;never thought from the beginning that [they] should need to make a new translation, nor yet to make of a bad one a good one, ... but to make a good one better, or out of many good ones, one principal good one, not justly to be excepted against; that hath been our endeavour, that our mark.&quot; They also give their opinion of previous English Bible translations, stating, &quot;We do not deny, nay, we affirm and avow, that the very meanest translation of the Bible in English, set forth by men of our profession, (for we have seen none of theirs [Catholics] of the whole Bible as yet) containeth the word of God, nay, is the word of God.&quot; As with the first preface, some British printings reproduce this, while most non-British printings do not. Almost every printing that includes the second preface also includes the first.
The first printing contained a number of other apparatus, including a table for the reading of the Psalms at matins and evensong, and a calendar, an almanac, and a table of holy days and observances. Much of this material became obsolete with the adoption of the Gregorian calendar by Britain and its colonies in 1752, and thus modern editions invariably omit it.

So as to make it easier to know a particular passage, each chapter was headed by a brief précis of its contents with verse numbers. Later editors freely substituted their own chapter summaries, or omitted such material entirely. Pilcrow marks are used to indicate the beginnings of paragraphs except after the book of Acts.

===Authorized Version===
The Authorized Version was meant to replace the &quot;Bishops&#x27; Bible&quot; as the official version for readings in the Church of England. No record of its authorization exists; it was probably effected by an order of the Privy Council, but the records for the years 1600 to 1613 were destroyed by fire in January 1618/19, and it is commonly known as the Authorized Version in the United Kingdom. The King&#x27;s Printer issued no further editions of the &quot;Bishops&#x27; Bible&quot;, so necessarily the Authorized Version replaced it as the standard lectern Bible in parish church use in England.

In the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, the text of the Authorized Version finally supplanted that of the &quot;Great Bible&quot; in the Epistle and Gospel readings—though the Prayer Book Psalter nevertheless continues in the Great Bible version.

The case was different in Scotland, where the Geneva Bible had long been the standard church Bible. It was not until 1633 that a Scottish edition of the Authorized Version was printed—in conjunction with the Scots coronation in that year of Charles I. The inclusion of illustrations in the edition raised accusations of Popery from opponents of the religious policies of Charles and William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury. However, official policy favoured the Authorized Version, and this favour returned during the Commonwealth—as London printers succeeded in re-asserting their monopoly on Bible printing with support from Oliver Cromwell—and the &quot;New Translation&quot; was the only edition on the market. F. F. Bruce reports that the last recorded instance of a Scots parish continuing to use the &quot;Old Translation&quot; (i.e. Geneva) as being in 1674.

The &quot;Authorized Version&quot;″s acceptance by the general public took longer. The &quot;Geneva Bible&quot; continued to be popular, and large numbers were imported from Amsterdam, where printing continued up to 1644 in editions carrying a false London imprint. However, few if any genuine Geneva editions appear to have been printed in London after 1616, and in 1637 Archbishop Laud prohibited their printing or importation. In the period of the English Civil War, soldiers of the New Model Army were issued a book of Geneva selections called &quot;The Soldiers&#x27; Bible&quot;. In the first half of the 17th century the Authorized Version is most commonly referred to as &quot;The Bible without notes&quot;, thereby distinguishing it from the Geneva &quot;Bible with notes&quot;.

There were several printings of the Authorized Version in Amsterdam—one as late as 1715 which combined the Authorized Version translation text with the Geneva marginal notes; one such edition was printed in London in 1649. During the Commonwealth a commission was established by Parliament to recommend a revision of the Authorized Version with acceptably Protestant explanatory notes, but the project was abandoned when it became clear that these would nearly double the bulk of the Bible text. After the English Restoration, the &quot;Geneva Bible&quot; was held to be politically suspect and a reminder of the repudiated Puritan era. Furthermore, disputes over the lucrative rights to print the Authorized Version dragged on through the 17th century, so none of the printers involved saw any commercial advantage in marketing a rival translation. The Authorized Version became the only then current version circulating among English-speaking people.

A small minority of critical scholars were slow to accept the latest translation. Hugh Broughton, who was the most highly regarded English Hebraist of his time but had been excluded from the panel of translators because of his utterly uncongenial temperament, issued in 1611 a total condemnation of the new version. He especially criticized the translators&#x27; rejection of word-for-word equivalence and stated that &quot;he would rather be torn in pieces by wild horses than that this abominable translation (KJV) should ever be foisted upon the English people&quot;. Walton&#x27;s London Polyglot of 1657 disregards the Authorized Version (and indeed the English language) entirely. Walton&#x27;s reference text throughout is the Vulgate.

The Vulgate Latin is also found as the standard text of scripture in Thomas Hobbes&#x27;s &quot;Leviathan&quot; of 1651. Hobbes gives Vulgate chapter and verse numbers (e.g., Job 41:24, not Job 41:33) for his head text. In Chapter 35: &quot;″The Signification in Scripture of Kingdom of God″&quot;, Hobbes discusses Exodus 19:5, first in his own translation of the &quot;″Vulgar Latin″&quot;, and then subsequently as found in the versions he terms &quot;... the English translation made in the beginning of the reign of King James&quot;, and &quot;The Geneva French&quot; (i.e. Olivétan). Hobbes advances detailed critical arguments why the Vulgate rendering is to be preferred. For most of the 17th century the assumption remained that, while it had been of vital importance to provide the scriptures in the vernacular for ordinary people, nevertheless for those with sufficient education to do so, Biblical study was best undertaken within the international common medium of Latin. It was only in 1700 that modern bilingual Bibles appeared in which the Authorized Version was compared with counterpart Dutch and French Protestant vernacular Bibles.

In consequence of the continual disputes over printing privileges, successive printings of the Authorized Version were notably less careful than the 1611 edition had been—compositors freely varying spelling, capitalization and punctuation—and also, over the years, introducing about 1,500 misprints (some of which, like the omission of &quot;not&quot; from the commandment &quot;Thou shalt not commit adultery&quot; in the &quot;Wicked Bible&quot;, became notorious). The two Cambridge editions of 1629 and 1638 attempted to restore the proper text—while introducing over 200 revisions of the original translators&#x27; work, chiefly by incorporating into the main text a more literal reading originally presented as a marginal note. A more thoroughly corrected edition was proposed following the Restoration, in conjunction with the revised 1662 Book of Common Prayer, but Parliament then decided against it.

By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was effectively unchallenged as the sole English translation in then current use in Protestant churches, and was so dominant that the Catholic Church in England issued in 1750 a revision of the 1610 &quot;Douay–Rheims Bible&quot; by Richard Challoner that was much closer to the Authorized Version than to the original. However, general standards of spelling, punctuation, typesetting, capitalization and grammar had changed radically in the 100 years since the first edition of the Authorized Version, and all printers in the market were introducing continual piecemeal changes to their Bible texts to bring them into line with then current practice—and with public expectations of standardized spelling and grammatical construction.

Over the course of the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Hebrew, Greek and the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English speaking scholars and divines, and indeed came to be regarded by some as an inspired text in itself—so much so that any challenge to its readings or textual base came to be regarded by many as an assault on Holy Scripture.

In the 18th century there was a serious shortage of Bibles in the American colonies. To meet the demand various printers, beginning with Samuel Kneeland in 1752, printed the King James Bible without authorization from the Crown. To avert prosecution and detection of an unauthorized printing they would include the royal insignia on the title page, using the same materials in its printing as the authorized version was produced from, which were imported from England.

===Standard text of 1769===
By the mid-18th century the wide variation in the various modernized printed texts of the Authorized Version, combined with the notorious accumulation of misprints, had reached the proportion of a scandal, and the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge both sought to produce an updated standard text. First of the two was the Cambridge edition of 1760, the culmination of 20 years&#x27; work by Francis Sawyer Parris, who died in May of that year. This 1760 edition was reprinted without change in 1762 and in John Baskerville&#x27;s folio edition of 1763.

This was effectively superseded by the 1769 Oxford edition, edited by Benjamin Blayney, though with comparatively few changes from Parris&#x27;s edition; but which became the Oxford standard text, and is reproduced almost unchanged in most current printings. Parris and Blayney sought consistently to remove those elements of the 1611 and subsequent editions that they believed were due to the vagaries of printers, while incorporating most of the revised readings of the Cambridge editions of 1629 and 1638, and each also introducing a few improved readings of their own.

They undertook the mammoth task of standardizing the wide variation in punctuation and spelling of the original, making many thousands of minor changes to the text. In addition, Blayney and Parris thoroughly revised and greatly extended the italicization of &quot;supplied&quot; words not found in the original languages by cross-checking against the presumed source texts. Blayney seems to have worked from the 1550 Stephanus edition of the Textus Receptus, rather than the later editions of Theodore Beza that the translators of the 1611 New Testament had favoured; accordingly the current Oxford standard text alters around a dozen italicizations where Beza and Stephanus differ. Like the 1611 edition, the 1769 Oxford edition included the Apocrypha, although Blayney tended to remove cross-references to the Books of the Apocrypha from the margins of their Old and New Testaments wherever these had been provided by the original translators. It also includes both prefaces from the 1611 edition. Altogether, the standardization of spelling and punctuation caused Blayney&#x27;s 1769 text to differ from the 1611 text in around 24,000 places.

The 1611 and 1769 texts of the first three verses from &quot;I Corinthians 13&quot; are given below.

There are a number of superficial edits in these three verses: 11 changes of spelling, 16 changes of typesetting (including the changed conventions for the use of u and v), three changes of punctuation, and one variant text—where &quot;not charity&quot; is substituted for &quot;no charity&quot; in verse two, in the belief that the original reading was a misprint.

A particular verse for which Blayney&#x27;s 1769 text differs from Parris&#x27;s 1760 version is Matthew 5:13, where Parris (1760) has

Blayney (1769) changes &#x27;lost his savour&#x27; to &#x27;lost its savour&#x27;, and to trodden.

For a period, Cambridge continued to issue Bibles using the Parris text, but the market demand for absolute standardization was now such that they eventually adapted Blayney&#x27;s work but omitted some of the idiosyncratic Oxford spellings. By the mid-19th century, almost all printings of the Authorized Version were derived from the 1769 Oxford text—increasingly without Blayney&#x27;s variant notes and cross references, and commonly excluding the Apocrypha. One exception to this was a scrupulous original-spelling, page-for-page, and line-for-line reprint of the 1611 edition (including all chapter headings, marginalia, and original italicization, but with Roman type substituted for the black letter of the original), published by Oxford in 1833.

Another important exception was the 1873 Cambridge Paragraph Bible, thoroughly revised, modernized and re-edited by F. H. A. Scrivener, who for the first time consistently identified the source texts underlying the 1611 translation and its marginal notes. Scrivener, like Blayney, opted to revise the translation where he considered the judgement of the 1611 translators had been faulty. In 2005, Cambridge University Press released its New Cambridge Paragraph Bible with Apocrypha, edited by David Norton, which followed in the spirit of Scrivener&#x27;s work, attempting to bring spelling to present-day standards. Norton also innovated with the introduction of quotation marks, while returning to a hypothetical 1611 text, so far as possible, to the wording used by its translators, especially in the light of the re-emphasis on some of their draft documents. This text has been issued in paperback by Penguin Books.

From the early 19th century the Authorized Version has remained almost completely unchanged—and since, due to advances in printing technology, it could now be produced in very large editions for mass sale, it established complete dominance in public and ecclesiastical use in the English-speaking Protestant world. Academic debate through that century, however, increasingly reflected concerns about the Authorized Version shared by some scholars: (a) that subsequent study in oriental languages suggested a need to revise the translation of the Hebrew Bible—both in terms of specific vocabulary, and also in distinguishing descriptive terms from proper names; (b) that the Authorized Version was unsatisfactory in translating the same Greek words and phrases into different English, especially where parallel passages are found in the synoptic gospels; and (c) in the light of subsequent ancient manuscript discoveries, the New Testament translation base of the Greek Textus Receptus could no longer be considered to be the best representation of the original text.

Responding to these concerns, the Convocation of Canterbury resolved in 1870 to undertake a revision of the text of the Authorized Version, intending to retain the original text &quot;except where in the judgement of competent scholars such a change is necessary&quot;. The resulting revision was issued as the Revised Version in 1881 (New Testament), 1885 (Old Testament) and 1894 (Apocrypha); but, although it sold widely, the revision did not find popular favour, and it was only reluctantly in 1899 that Convocation approved it for reading in churches.

By the early 20th century, editing had been completed in Cambridge&#x27;s text, with at least 6 new changes since 1769, and the reversing of at least 30 of the standard Oxford readings. The distinct Cambridge text was printed in the millions, and after the Second World War &quot;the unchanging steadiness of the KJB was a huge asset.&quot;

===Editorial criticism===
F. H. A. Scrivener and D. Norton have both written in detail on editorial variations which have occurred through the history of the publishing of the Authorized Version from 1611 to 1769. In the 19th century, there were effectively three main guardians of the text. Norton identified five variations among the Oxford, Cambridge, and London (Eyre and Spottiswoode) texts of 1857, such as the spelling of &quot;farther&quot; or &quot;further&quot; at Matthew 26:39.

In the 20th century, variation between the editions was reduced to comparing the Cambridge to the Oxford. Distinctly identified Cambridge readings included &quot;or Sheba&quot;, &quot;sin&quot;, &quot;clifts&quot;, &quot;vapour&quot;, &quot;flieth&quot;, &quot;further&quot; and a number of other references. In effect the Cambridge was considered the current text in comparison to the Oxford. These are instances where both Oxford and Cambridge have now diverged from Blayney&#x27;s 1769 Edition. The distinctions between the Oxford and Cambridge editions have been a major point in the Bible version debate, and a potential theological issue, particularly in regard to the identification of the Pure Cambridge Edition.

Cambridge University Press introduced a change at 1 John 5:8 in 1985, reversing its longstanding tradition of printing the word &quot;spirit&quot; in lower case by using a capital letter &quot;S&quot;. A Rev. Hardin of Bedford, Pennsylvania, wrote a letter to Cambridge inquiring about this verse, and received a reply on 3 June 1985 from the Bible Director, Jerry L. Hooper, claiming that it was a &quot;matter of some embarrassment regarding the lower case &#x27;s&#x27; in Spirit&quot;.

==Literary attributes==
===Marginal notes===

In obedience to their instructions, the translators provided no marginal interpretation of the text, but in some 8,500 places a marginal note offers an alternative English wording. The majority of these notes offer a more literal rendering of the original, introduced as &quot;Heb&quot;, &quot;Chal&quot; (Chaldee, referring to Aramaic), &quot;Gr&quot; or &quot;Lat&quot;. Others indicate a variant reading of the source text (introduced by &quot;or&quot;). Some of the annotated variants derive from alternative editions in the original languages, or from variant forms quoted in the fathers. More commonly, though, they indicate a difference between the literal original language reading and that in the translators&#x27; preferred recent Latin versions: Tremellius for the Old Testament, Junius for the Apocrypha, and Beza for the New Testament. At thirteen places in the New Testament a marginal note records a variant reading found in some Greek manuscript copies; in almost all cases reproducing a counterpart textual note at the same place in Beza&#x27;s editions.

A few more extensive notes clarify Biblical names and units of measurement or currency. Modern reprintings rarely reproduce these annotated variants, although they are to be found in the New Cambridge Paragraph Bible. In addition, there were originally some 9,000 scriptural cross-references, in which one text was related to another. Such cross-references had long been common in Latin Bibles, and most of those in the Authorized Version were copied unaltered from this Latin tradition. Consequently the early editions of the KJV retain many Vulgate verse references—e.g. in the numbering of the Psalms. At the head of each chapter, the translators provided a short précis of its contents, with verse numbers; these are rarely included in complete form in modern editions.

===Use of typeface===
Also in obedience to their instructions, the translators indicated &#x27;supplied&#x27; words in a different typeface; but there was no attempt to regularize the instances where this practice had been applied across the different companies; and especially in the New Testament, it was used much less frequently in the 1611 edition than would later be the case. In one verse, 1 John 2:23, an entire clause was printed in roman type (as it had also been in the Great Bible and Bishop&#x27;s Bible); indicating a reading then primarily derived from the Vulgate, albeit one for which the later editions of Beza had provided a Greek text.
In the Old Testament the translators render the Tetragrammaton (YHWH) by &quot;the LORD&quot; (in later editions in small capitals as ), or &quot;the LORD God&quot; (for &quot;YHWH Elohim&quot;, יהוה אלהים), except in four places by &quot;IEHOVAH&quot;. However, if the Tetragrammaton occurs with the Hebrew word (Lord) then it is rendered not as the &quot;Lord LORD&quot; but as the &quot;Lord God&quot;. In later editions it appears as &quot;Lord &quot;, with &quot;&quot; in small capitals, indicating to the reader that God&#x27;s name appears in the original Hebrew.

===Source texts===
====Old Testament====
For the Old Testament, the translators used a text originating in the editions of the Hebrew Rabbinic Bible by Daniel Bomberg (1524/5), but adjusted this to conform to the Greek LXX or Latin Vulgate in passages to which Christian tradition had attached a Christological interpretation. For example, the Septuagint reading &quot;They pierced my hands and my feet&quot; was used in Psalm 22:16 (vs. the Masoretes&#x27; reading of the Hebrew &quot;like lions my hands and feet&quot;). Otherwise, however, the Authorized Version is closer to the Hebrew tradition than any previous English translation—especially in making use of the rabbinic commentaries, such as Kimhi, in elucidating obscure passages in the Masoretic Text; earlier versions had been more likely to adopt LXX or Vulgate readings in such places. Following the practice of the Geneva Bible, the books of 1 Esdras and 2 Esdras in the medieval Vulgate Old Testament were renamed &#x27;Ezra&#x27; and &#x27;Nehemiah&#x27;; 3 Esdras and 4 Esdras in the Apocrypha being renamed &#x27;1 Esdras&#x27; and &#x27;2 Esdras&#x27;.

====New Testament====
For the New Testament, the translators chiefly used the 1598 and 1588/89 Greek editions of Theodore Beza, which also present Beza&#x27;s Latin version of the Greek and Stephanus&#x27;s edition of the Latin Vulgate. Both of these versions were extensively referred to, as the translators conducted all discussions amongst themselves in Latin. F. H. A. Scrivener identifies 190 readings where the Authorized Version translators depart from Beza&#x27;s Greek text, generally in maintaining the wording of the &quot;Bishops&#x27; Bible&quot; and other earlier English translations. In about half of these instances, the Authorized Version translators appear to follow the earlier 1550 Greek Textus Receptus of Stephanus. For the other half, Scrivener was usually able to find corresponding Greek readings in the editions of Erasmus, or in the Complutensian Polyglot. However, in several dozen readings he notes that no printed Greek text corresponds to the English of the Authorized Version, which in these places derives directly from the Vulgate. For example, at John 10:16, the Authorized Version reads &quot;one fold&quot; (as did the &quot;Bishops&#x27; Bible&quot;, and the 16th-century vernacular versions produced in Geneva), following the Latin Vulgate &quot;unum ovile&quot;, whereas Tyndale had agreed more closely with the Greek, &quot;one flocke&quot; (μία ποίμνη). The Authorized Version New Testament owes much more to the Vulgate than does the Old Testament; still, at least 80% of the text is unaltered from Tyndale&#x27;s translation.

====Apocrypha====
Unlike the rest of the Bible, the translators of the Apocrypha identified their source texts in their marginal notes. From these it can be determined that the books of the Apocrypha were translated from the Septuagint—primarily, from the Greek Old Testament column in the Antwerp Polyglot—but with extensive reference to the counterpart Latin Vulgate text, and to Junius&#x27;s Latin translation. The translators record references to the Sixtine Septuagint of 1587, which is substantially a printing of the Old Testament text from the Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209, and also to the 1518 Greek Septuagint edition of Aldus Manutius. They had, however, no Greek texts for 2 Esdras, or for the Prayer of Manasses, and Scrivener found that they here used an unidentified Latin manuscript.

====Sources====
The translators appear to have otherwise made no first-hand study of ancient manuscript sources, even those that—like the Codex Bezae—would have been readily available to them. In addition to all previous English versions (including, and contrary to their instructions, the &quot;Rheimish New Testament&quot; which in their preface they criticized), they made wide and eclectic use of all printed editions in the original languages then available, including the ancient Syriac New Testament printed with an interlinear Latin gloss in the Antwerp Polyglot of 1573. In the preface the translators acknowledge consulting translations and commentaries in Chaldee, Hebrew, Syrian, Greek, Latin, Spanish, French, Italian, and German.

The translators took the Bishops&#x27; Bible as their source text, and where they departed from that in favour of another translation, this was most commonly the Geneva Bible. However, the degree to which readings from the Bishops&#x27; Bible survived into final text of the King James Bible varies greatly from company to company, as did the propensity of the King James translators to coin phrases of their own. John Bois&#x27;s notes of the General Committee of Review show that they discussed readings derived from a wide variety of versions and patristic sources, including explicitly both Henry Savile&#x27;s 1610 edition of the works of John Chrysostom and the Rheims New Testament, which was the primary source for many of the literal alternative readings provided for the marginal notes.

===Variations in recent translations===

A number of Bible verses in the King James Version of the New Testament are not found in more recent Bible translations, where these are based on modern critical texts. In the early seventeenth century, the source Greek texts of the New Testament which were used to produce Protestant Bible versions were mainly dependent on manuscripts of the late Byzantine text-type, and they also contained minor variations which became known as the Textus Receptus. With the subsequent identification of much earlier manuscripts, most modern textual scholars value the evidence of manuscripts which belong to the Alexandrian family as better witnesses to the original text of the biblical authors, without giving it, or any family, automatic preference.

===Style and criticism===
A primary concern of the translators was to produce an appropriate Bible, dignified and resonant in public reading. Although the Authorized Version&#x27;s written style is an important part of its influence on English, research has found only one verse—Hebrews 13:8—for which translators debated the wording&#x27;s literary merits. While they stated in the preface that they used stylistic variation, finding multiple English words or verbal forms in places where the original language employed repetition, in practice they also did the opposite; for example, 14 different Hebrew words were translated into the single English word &quot;prince&quot;.

In a period of rapid linguistic change the translators avoided contemporary idioms, tending instead towards forms that were already slightly archaic, like &quot;verily&quot; and &quot;it came to pass&quot;. The pronouns &quot;thou&quot;/&quot;thee&quot; and &quot;ye&quot;/&quot;you&quot; are consistently used as singular and plural respectively, even though by this time &quot;you&quot; was often found as the singular in general English usage, especially when addressing a social superior (as is evidenced, for example, in Shakespeare). For the possessive of the third person pronoun, the word &quot;its&quot;, first recorded in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; in 1598, is avoided. The older &quot;his&quot; is usually employed, as for example at Matthew 5:13: &quot;if the salt have lost &quot;his&quot; savour, wherewith shall it be salted?&quot;; in other places &quot;of it&quot;, &quot;thereof&quot; or bare &quot;it&quot; are found. Another sign of linguistic conservatism is the invariable use of &quot;-eth&quot; for the third person singular present form of the verb, as at Matthew 2:13: &quot;the Angel of the Lord appear&quot;eth&quot; to Joseph in a dreame&quot;. The rival ending &quot;-(e)s&quot;, as found in present-day English, was already widely used by this time (for example, it predominates over &quot;-eth&quot; in the plays of Shakespeare and Marlowe). Furthermore, the translators preferred &quot;which&quot; to &quot;who&quot; or &quot;whom&quot; as the relative pronoun for persons, as in Genesis 13:5: &quot;And Lot also &quot;which&quot; went with Abram, had flocks and heards, &amp; tents&quot; although &quot;who(m)&quot; is also found.

The Authorized Version is notably more Latinate than previous English versions, especially the Geneva Bible. This results in part from the academic stylistic preferences of a number of the translators—several of whom admitted to being more comfortable writing in Latin than in English—but was also, in part, a consequence of the royal proscription against explanatory notes. Hence, where the Geneva Bible might use a common English word, and gloss its particular application in a marginal note, the Authorized Version tends rather to prefer a technical term, frequently in Anglicized Latin. Consequently, although the King had instructed the translators to use the Bishops&#x27; Bible as a base text, the New Testament in particular owes much stylistically to the Catholic Rheims New Testament, whose translators had also been concerned to find English equivalents for Latin terminology. In addition, the translators of the New Testament books transliterate names found in the Old Testament in their Greek forms rather than in the forms closer to the Old Testament Hebrew (e.g. &quot;Elias&quot; and &quot;Noe&quot; for &quot;Elijah&quot; and &quot;Noah&quot;, respectively).

While the Authorized Version remains among the most widely sold, modern critical New Testament translations differ substantially from it in a number of passages, primarily because they rely on source manuscripts not then accessible to (or not then highly regarded by) early-17th-century Biblical scholarship. In the Old Testament, there are also many differences from modern translations that are based not on manuscript differences, but on a different understanding of Ancient Hebrew vocabulary or grammar by the translators. For example, in modern translations it is clear that Job 28:1–11 is referring throughout to mining operations, which is not at all apparent from the text of the Authorized Version.

===Mistranslations===
The King James Version contains several alleged mistranslations, especially in the Old Testament where the knowledge of Hebrew and cognate languages was uncertain at the time. Among the most commonly cited errors is in the Hebrew of Job and Deuteronomy, where with the probable meaning of &quot;wild-ox, aurochs&quot;, is translated in the KJV as &quot;unicorn&quot;; following in this the Vulgate &quot;unicornis&quot; and several medieval rabbinic commentators. The translators of the KJV note the alternative rendering, &quot;rhinocerots&quot; in the margin at Isaiah 34:7. On a similar note Martin Luther&#x27;s German translation had also relied on the Latin Vulgate on this point, consistently translating רְאֵם using the German word for unicorn, &quot;Einhorn&quot;. Otherwise, the translators are accused on several occasions to have mistakenly interpreted a Hebrew descriptive phrase as a proper name (or vice versa); as at 2 Samuel 1:18 where &#x27;the Book of Jasher&#x27; properly refers not to a work by an author of that name, but should rather be rendered as &quot;the Book of the Upright&quot; (which was proposed as an alternative reading in a marginal note to the KJV text).

==Influence==
Despite royal patronage and encouragement, there was never any overt mandate to use the new translation. It was not until 1661 that the Authorized Version replaced the &quot;Bishops&#x27; Bible&quot; in the Epistle and Gospel lessons of the Book of Common Prayer, and it never did replace the older translation in the Psalter. In 1763 &quot;The Critical Review&quot; complained that &quot;many false interpretations, ambiguous phrases, obsolete words and indelicate expressions ... excite the derision of the scorner&quot;. Blayney&#x27;s 1769 version, with its revised spelling and punctuation, helped change the public perception of the Authorized Version to a masterpiece of the English language. By the 19th century, F. W. Faber could say of the translation, &quot;It lives on the ear, like music that can never be forgotten, like the sound of church bells, which the convert hardly knows how he can forego.&quot;

Geddes MacGregor called the Authorized Version &quot;the most influential version of the most influential book in the world, in what is now its most influential language&quot;, &quot;the most important book in English religion and culture&quot;, and &quot;the most celebrated book in the English-speaking world&quot;. David Crystal has estimated that it is responsible for 257 idioms in English; examples include feet of clay and . Furthermore, prominent atheist figures such as Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins have praised the King James Version as being &quot;a giant step in the maturing of English literature&quot; and &quot;a great work of literature&quot;, respectively, with Dawkins then adding, &quot;A native speaker of English who has never read a word of the King James Bible is verging on the barbarian&quot;.

The King James Version is one of the versions authorized to be used in the services of the Episcopal Church and other parts of the Anglican Communion, as it is the historical Bible of this church. 

It was presented to King Charles III at his coronation service.

Other Christian denominations have also accepted the King James Version. The King James Version is used by English-speaking Conservative Anabaptists, along with Methodists of the conservative holiness movement, in addition to certain Baptists. In the Orthodox Church in America, it is used liturgically and was made &quot;the &#x27;official&#x27; translation for a whole generation of American Orthodox&quot;. The later Service Book of the Antiochian archdiocese, in vogue today, also uses the King James Version. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints continues to use its own edition of the Authorized Version as its official English Bible.

Although the Authorized Version&#x27;s preeminence in the English-speaking world has diminished—for example, the Church of England recommends six other versions in addition to it—it is still the most used translation in the United States, especially as the Scofield Reference Bible for Evangelicals. However, over the past forty years it has been gradually overtaken by modern versions, principally the New International Version (1973), the New Revised Standard Version (1989), and the English Standard Version (2001), the latter of which is seen as a successor to the King James Version.

===King James Only movement===
The King James Only movement advocates the belief that the King James Version is superior to all other English translations of the Bible. Most adherents of the movement believe that the Textus Receptus is very close, if not identical, to the original autographs, thereby making it the ideal Greek source for the translation. They argue that manuscripts such as the Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus, on which most modern English translations are based, are corrupted New Testament texts. One of them, Perry Demopoulos, was a director of the translation of the King James Bible into Russian. In 2010 the Russian translation of the KJV of the New Testament was released in Kyiv, Ukraine. In 2017, the first complete edition of a Russian King James Bible was released. In 2017, a Faroese translation of the King James Bible was released as well.

==Copyright status==
The Authorized Version is in the public domain in most of the world. In the United Kingdom, the right to print, publish and distribute it is a royal prerogative, and the Crown licenses publishers to reproduce it under letters patent. In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the letters patent are held by the King&#x27;s Printer; in Scotland, they are held by the Scottish Bible Board. The office of the King&#x27;s Printer has been associated with the right to reproduce the Bible for centuries, the earliest known reference coming in 1577.

In the 18th century, all surviving interests in the monopoly were bought out by John Baskett. The Baskett rights descended through a number of printers and, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the King&#x27;s Printer is now Cambridge University Press, which inherited the right when they took over the firm of Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode in 1990.

Other royal charters of similar antiquity grant Cambridge University Press and Oxford University Press the right to produce the Authorized Version independently of the King&#x27;s Printer. In Scotland, the Authorized Version is published by Collins under licence from the Scottish Bible Board. The terms of the letters patent prohibit any other than the holders, or those authorized by the holders, from printing, publishing or importing the Authorized Version into the United Kingdom. The protection that the Authorized Version, and also the &quot;Book of Common Prayer,&quot; enjoy is the last remnant of the time when the Crown held a monopoly over all printing and publishing in the United Kingdom.

Although Crown Copyright usually expires 50 years after publication, Section 171(b) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 made an exception for &#x27;any right or privilege of the Crown&#x27; not written in an act of parliament, thus preserving the rights of the Crown under the unwritten royal prerogative.

=== Permission ===
Within the United Kingdom, Cambridge University Press permits the reproduction of at most 500 verses for &quot;liturgical and non-commercial educational use&quot;, provided that their prescribed acknowledgement is included, the quoted verses do not exceed 25% of the publication quoting them and do not include a complete Bible book. For use beyond this, the Press is willing to consider permission requested on a case-by-case basis and in 2011 a spokesman said the Press generally does not charge a fee but tries to ensure that a reputable source text is used.

===Apocrypha===
Translations of the books of the biblical apocrypha were necessary for the King James version, as readings from these books were included in the daily Old Testament lectionary of the Book of Common Prayer. Protestant Bibles in the 16th century included the books of the apocrypha—generally, following the Luther Bible, in a separate section between the Old and New Testaments to indicate they were not considered part of the Old Testament text—and there is evidence that these were widely read as popular literature, especially in Puritan circles.

The apocrypha of the King James Version has the same 14 books as had been found in the apocrypha of the Bishops&#x27; Bible; however, following the practice of the Geneva Bible, the first two books of the apocrypha were renamed 1 Esdras and 2 Esdras, as compared to the names in the Thirty-nine Articles, with the corresponding Old Testament books being renamed Ezra and Nehemiah. Starting in 1630, volumes of the &quot;Geneva Bible&quot; were occasionally bound with the pages of the apocrypha section excluded. In 1644, the Long Parliament forbade the reading of the apocrypha in churches; and in 1666, the first editions of the King James Bible without the apocrypha were bound.

The standardization of the text of the Authorized Version after 1769 together with the technological development of stereotype printing made it possible to produce Bibles in large print-runs at very low unit prices. For commercial and charitable publishers, editions of the Authorized Version without the apocrypha reduced the cost, while having increased market appeal to non-Anglican Protestant readers.

With the rise of the Bible societies, most editions have omitted the whole section of apocryphal books. The British and Foreign Bible Society withdrew subsidies for Bible printing and dissemination in 1826, under the following resolution:

The American Bible Society adopted a similar policy. Both societies eventually reversed these policies in light of 20th-century ecumenical efforts on translations, the ABS doing so in 1964 and the BFBS in 1966.

<text>Kevin Spacey Fowler (born July 26, 1959) is an American actor. Known for his work on stage and screen, he has received numerous accolades, including two Academy Awards, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Tony Award, and two Laurence Olivier Awards as well as nominations for 12 Emmy Awards. Spacey was named an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2015.

Spacey began his film career with small roles in Mike Nichols&#x27;s comedy-drama films &quot;Heartburn&quot; (1986) and &quot;Working Girl&quot; (1988). He won two Academy Awards: Best Supporting Actor for playing a con man in &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; (1995) and Best Actor for playing a suburban husband and father going through a midlife crisis in &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999). His other films include &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; (1992), &quot;Outbreak&quot; (1995), &quot;Se7en&quot; (1995), &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; (1996), &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; (1997), &quot;Pay It Forward&quot; (2000), &quot;Superman Returns&quot; (2006), &quot;21&quot; (2008), &quot;Margin Call&quot; (2011), &quot;Horrible Bosses&quot; (2011), and &quot;Baby Driver&quot; (2017). He has also directed the films &quot;Albino Alligator&quot; (1996) and &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot; (2004).

In Broadway theatre, Spacey starred in a revival of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot; in 1986. He won a Tony Award in 1991 for his role in &quot;Lost in Yonkers&quot;. He won a Laurence Olivier Award for his performance in a revival of &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot; in 1999. Spacey portrayed the title role in &quot;Richard III&quot; in 2011 and Clarence Darrow in a West End production of &quot;Darrow&quot; in 2015. He was the artistic director of the Old Vic theatre in London from 2004 to 2015, for which he received the Society of London Theatre Special Award. In 2017, he hosted the 71st Tony Awards.

In television, Spacey portrayed Ron Klain in &quot;Recount&quot; (2008) and produced &quot;Bernard and Doris&quot; (2008), both for HBO Films. From 2013 to 2017, he starred as Frank Underwood in the Netflix political drama series &quot;House of Cards&quot;, which won him a Golden Globe Award and two consecutive Screen Actors Guild Awards for Best Actor. Both Spacey and the show itself were nominated for five consecutive Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and Outstanding Drama Series, respectively.

In 2017, Spacey faced several allegations of sexual misconduct. In 2018 and 2019, Spacey faced multiple criminal investigations; however, in each case Spacey was either not charged or the charges against him were dropped. He has denied the accusations and was found not liable in a 2022 lawsuit in New York. In a separate case in London, he was acquitted by a jury of sexual assault charges in 2023.

==Early life, family and education==
Kevin Spacey Fowler was born in South Orange, New Jersey, to Kathleen Ann (&quot;née&quot; Knutson), a secretary, and Thomas Geoffrey Fowler, a technical writer and data consultant. His family relocated to Southern California when he was four years old. Spacey has a sister and an older brother, Randy Fowler, from whom Spacey is estranged. His brother has stated that their father, whom he described as a racist &quot;Nazi supporter&quot;, was sexually and physically abusive, and that Spacey shut down emotionally and became &quot;very sly and smart&quot; to avoid beatings. Spacey first addressed the matter in October 2022, saying that his father was &quot;a white supremacist and a neo-Nazi&quot; who would call him &quot;an F-word that is very derogatory to the gay community&quot;. He stated that, as a result, he became extremely private about his personal life and did not come out as gay earlier in his life. Spacey had previously described his father as &quot;a very normal, middle-class man&quot;.

Spacey attended Northridge Military Academy, Canoga Park High School in the 10th and 11th grades. He graduated co-valedictorian (along with Mare Winningham) of the class of 1977 of Chatsworth High School in Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California. At Chatsworth, Spacey starred in the school&#x27;s senior production of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, playing the part of Captain Georg von Trapp, with Winningham as Maria von Trapp. He started using his middle name &quot;Spacey&quot;, which was his paternal grandmother&#x27;s maiden name. Spacey had tried to succeed as a comedian for several years before attending the Juilliard School in New York City, as a member of Group 12, where he studied drama with teacher Marian Seldes between 1979 and 1981. During this time period, he performed comedy in bowling alley talent contests.

==Career==
=== Theatre ===
==== 1981–1986: Career beginnings in theatre ====
Spacey&#x27;s first professional stage appearance was as a spear carrier in a New York Shakespeare Festival performance of &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot; in 1981. The following year, he made his first Broadway appearance, as Oswald in a production of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Ghosts&quot;, starring Liv Ullmann and director John Neville, which opened at the Eisenhower Theater in Washington&#x27;s Kennedy Center. He then portrayed Philinte in Molière&#x27;s &quot;The Misanthrope&quot;. In 1984, Spacey appeared in a production of David Rabe&#x27;s &quot;Hurlyburly&quot;, in which he rotated through each of the male parts (he would later play Mickey in the film version). Next came Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot; alongside David Strathairn and Colleen Dewhurst. In 1986, Spacey appeared in a production of &quot;Sleuth&quot; in a New Jersey dinner theatre.

==== 1986–1991: Broadway success and Tony win ====
Spacey&#x27;s prominence as a stage actor began in 1986, when he was cast opposite Jack Lemmon, Peter Gallagher, and Bethel Leslie, as Jamie, the eldest Tyrone son, in Jonathan Miller&#x27;s lauded production of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot;. Lemmon in particular would become a mentor to Spacey and was invited, along with Spacey&#x27;s high school drama teacher, to be present when Spacey received his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1999.

Spacey remained actively involved in the live theatre community. In 1991, he won a Tony Award for his portrayal of Uncle Louie in Neil Simon&#x27;s Broadway hit &quot;Lost in Yonkers&quot;. His father was unconvinced that Spacey could make a career for himself as an actor and did not change his mind until Spacey became well known. In 1999, Spacey won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor and earned another Tony Award nomination in 1999 for &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot;.

====2003–2015: Artistic director of the Old Vic====

In February 2003, Spacey announced that he was to become the artistic director of the Old Vic, one of London&#x27;s oldest theatres. Appearing at a press conference with Judi Dench and Elton John, Spacey promised both to appear on stage and to bring in big-name talent. He undertook to remain in the post for a full ten years. The Old Vic Theatre Company staged shows eight months out of the year. Spacey&#x27;s first season started in September 2004, opening with the British premiere of the play &quot;Cloaca&quot; by Maria Goos, directed by Spacey, which opened to mixed reviews. In the 2005 season, Spacey made his UK Shakespearean debut, to good notices, in the title role of &quot;Richard II&quot;, directed by Trevor Nunn.

On June 16, 2016, Spacey was awarded an knighthood for his services to theatre, arts education, and international culture in the 2015 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. The honour, Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, was given at Clarence House by then-Prince Charles. As a non-Commonwealth Realm citizen, the award is honorary and he is not entitled to the honorific &quot;Sir&quot;. Spacey had previously been awarded the lesser rank of honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for services to drama in 2010. Spacey was a patron of the Shakespeare Schools Festival, a charity that enables school children across the UK to perform Shakespeare in professional theatres. He also sits on the board of directors of the Motion Picture and Television Fund.

In mid-2006, Spacey said that he was having the time of his life working at the Old Vic; at that point in his career, he said, he was &quot;trying to do things now that are much bigger and outside [myself]&quot;. Spacey performed in productions of &quot;National Anthems&quot; by Dennis McIntyre, and &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; by Philip Barry, in which he played C.K. Dexter Haven, the Cary Grant role in the film version. Critics applauded Spacey for taking on the management of a theatre, but noted that while his acting was impressive, his skills and judgment as a producer/manager had yet to develop. In the 2006 season, Spacey suffered a major setback with a production of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Resurrection Blues&quot;, directed by Robert Altman. Despite an all-star cast (including Matthew Modine and future &quot;House of Cards&quot; co-star Neve Campbell) and the pedigree of Miller&#x27;s script, Spacey&#x27;s decision to lure Altman to the stage proved disastrous: after a fraught rehearsal period, the play opened to a critical panning, and closed after only a few weeks. Later in the year, Spacey starred in Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;A Moon for the Misbegotten&quot;, along with Colm Meaney and Eve Best. The play received excellent reviews for Spacey and Best, and was transferred to Broadway in 2007. For the spring part of the 2007–08 season, Jeff Goldblum and Laura Michelle Kelly joined Spacey as the three characters in David Mamet&#x27;s 1988 play &quot;Speed-the-Plow&quot;.

In 2009, he directed the premiere of Joe Sutton&#x27;s &quot;Complicit&quot;, with Richard Dreyfuss, David Suchet and Elizabeth McGovern. Later that year, Trevor Nunn directed Spacey in a revival of &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;. Spacey played defense lawyer Henry Drummond, a role that was made famous by Spencer Tracy in the 1960 film of the same name. Sam Mendes directed Spacey in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;; Spacey played the title role. The show began in June 2011, commencing a worldwide tour culminating in New York in early 2012. In March 2014, it was announced that Spacey would star in a one-man play at the Old Vic to celebrate his ten years as artistic director. He took on the part of Clarence Darrow in the play.

=== Film ===
==== 1986–1994: Early roles and breakthrough ====
In 1986, Spacey made his first film appearance in Mike Nichols&#x27;s &quot;Heartburn&quot; starring Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson. Spacey plays a small role credited as a subway thief. In 1988, Spacey also briefly appeared in another Nichols film, &quot;Working Girl&quot;, as businessman Bob Speck. Some of Spacey&#x27;s other early roles include a widowed millionaire on &quot;L.A. Law&quot;; the television miniseries &quot;The Murder of Mary Phagan&quot; (1988), opposite Lemmon; and the comedy &quot;See No Evil, Hear No Evil&quot; (1989). Spacey quickly developed a reputation as a character actor, and was cast in bigger roles, including the malevolent office manager in the ensemble film adaptation of the David Mamet play &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; (1992) starring Al Pacino, as well as news reporter Harry Kingsley in a film based on a 1917 dog sled race &quot;Iron Will&quot; (1994) directed by Charles Haid. Spacey also played one-half of a bickering Connecticut couple alongside Judy Davis in the dark comedy Christmas film &quot;The Ref&quot; (1994), and a malicious Hollywood studio boss in the satire &quot;Swimming with Sharks&quot; (1995).

==== 1995–1999: Rise to stardom and awards success ====

Spacey gained prominence for his role as the enigmatic criminal Verbal Kint in Bryan Singer&#x27;s neo-noir film &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; (1995). He starred opposite an ensemble cast including Gabriel Byrne, Benicio del Toro, and Chazz Palminteri. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Spacey is terrific as the mysterious weak link in the chain of thieves&quot;. The role won him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture and Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Actor in a Supporting Role. That same year, Spacey also appeared in the David Fincher detective thriller &quot;Seven&quot; (1995) starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. Spacey made a sudden entrance late in the film as serial killer John Doe after going uncredited and unmentioned in the film&#x27;s advertisements and opening credits. His work in &quot;Seven&quot;, &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; and &quot;Outbreak&quot; earned him Best Supporting Actor honors at the 1995 Society of Texas Film Critics Awards.

Spacey played an egomaniacal district attorney in &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; (1996) and founded Trigger Street Productions in 1997 with the purpose of producing and developing entertainment across various media. Spacey made his directorial debut with the film &quot;Albino Alligator&quot; (1996). The film was a box office bomb, grossing with a budget of , but critics praised Spacey&#x27;s direction. He starred in the Curtis Hanson directed neo-noir crime film &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; (1997) acting alongside Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, and Kim Basinger. Spacey played the Detective Sergeant Jack &quot;Hollywood Jack&quot; Vincennes, an officer and technical advisor for a fictional TV police drama series. The ensemble cast received praise with Jack Matthews of &quot;Newsday&quot; citing Spacey as the highlight writing, &quot;Best of ail are Spacey striking an impossible balance of smarminess and charm&quot;. The role landed Spacey a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. The following year he voiced the intimidating grasshopper, Hopper in the animated Pixar film &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; (1998). Throughout his career, Spacey has been well known for playing villains; he remarked in 2013: &quot;I think people just like me evil for some reason. They want me to be a son of a bitch.&quot;

In 1999, Spacey acted alongside Annette Bening in Sam Mendes&#x27;s &quot;American Beauty&quot;. In the film he played the role of Lester Burnham, a depressed suburban father and advertising executive who becomes attracted to his teenage daughter&#x27;s best friend. The film and its performance received widespread acclaim, particularly Spacey with critic Roger Ebert declaring, &quot;Spacey, an actor who embodies intelligence in his eyes and voice, is the right choice for Lester Burnham. He does reckless and foolish things in this movie, but he doesn&#x27;t deceive himself; he knows he&#x27;s running wild--and chooses to, burning up the future years of an empty lifetime for a few flashes of freedom&quot;. For this role, Spacey won his second Oscar, this time for Best Actor in a Leading Role. In his acceptance speech he dedicated his Oscar to Jack Lemmon, praising him as an influence, mentor, and father figure. He also stated, &quot;[Lemmon&#x27;s] performance in &quot;The Apartment&quot; stands as one of the finest we&#x27;ve ever had&quot;. For his role he also received a BAFTA Award and Screen Actors Guild Award as well as a nomination for a Golden Globe Award. That same year, he was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==== 2000–2016: Established actor ====

Spacey played a physically and emotionally scarred grade school teacher in &quot;Pay It Forward&quot; (2000), a patient in a mental institution who may or may not be an alien in &quot;K-Pax&quot; (2001), and singer Bobby Darin in &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot; (2004). The latter was a lifelong dream project for Spacey, who took on co-writing, directing, co-producing and starring duties in the biography/musical about Darin&#x27;s life, career and relationship with actress Sandra Dee. Facing little interest for backing in the U.S., Spacey went to the United Kingdom and Germany for funding. Almost all of the film was made in Berlin. Spacey provided his own vocals on the film&#x27;s soundtrack and appeared in several tribute concerts around the time of its release. Spacey received mostly positive reviews for his singing, as well as a Golden Globe nomination for his performance. However, reviewers debated the age disparity between Spacey and Darin, noting that Spacey was too old to convincingly portray Darin, particularly during the early stages of the singer&#x27;s life depicted in the film.

In 2006, Spacey played Lex Luthor in the Bryan Singer superhero film &quot;Superman Returns&quot; starring Brandon Routh. He was to return for its 2009 sequel, but the series was instead rebooted with the 2013 film &quot;Man of Steel&quot;. Spacey also appeared in &quot;Edison&quot;, which received a direct-to-video release in 2006. The film was released in theaters in Netherlands on March 12, 2006. In 2008, Spacey played a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) lecturer in the film &quot;21&quot;. The film is based on Ben Mezrich&#x27;s best seller &quot;Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six MIT Students Who Took Vegas for Millions&quot;, a story of student MIT card-counters who used mathematical probability to aid them in card games such as blackjack. In early 2010, Spacey went to China to star in writer-director Dayyan Eng&#x27;s black comedy film &quot;Inseparable&quot;, becoming the first Hollywood actor to star in a fully Chinese-funded film.
In 2011, Spacey starred in J.C. Chandor&#x27;s financial thriller &quot;Margin Call&quot; alongside Paul Bettany, Jeremy Irons, Zachary Quinto, Demi Moore, and Stanley Tucci. The story at large takes place over a 24-hour period at a large Wall Street investment bank during the initial stages of the financial crisis of 2007–2008. The film, which focuses on the actions taken by a group of employees during the subsequent financial collapse, made its debut at the Sundance Film Festival to critical acclaim. Spacey received the Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award along with the cast. That same year, Spacey co-starred in the black comedy film &quot;Horrible Bosses&quot;, which grossed over at the box office. In 2013 he executive-produced the biographical survival thriller film &quot;Captain Phillips&quot;, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

He starred as President Richard Nixon in the comedy-drama &quot;Elvis &amp; Nixon&quot; (2016), which is based on the meeting that took place between Nixon and singer Elvis Presley (Michael Shannon) in December 1970 wherein Presley requested that Nixon swear him in as an undercover agent in the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. He next starred in the comedy film &quot;Nine Lives&quot;, as a man trapped in the body of a cat. The film was released on August 5, 2016.

In January 2016 it was announced that Relativity Media, which was just emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, had acquired Trigger Street Productions and that Spacey would become chairman of Relativity Studios, while Dana Brunetti would become the studio&#x27;s president. Spacey called the move &quot;an incredible opportunity to make great entertainment&quot; and said he considered it the &quot;next evolution in my career&quot;. However, when the paperwork for the studio was filed for the court, it emerged that Spacey had opted out of assuming the chairmanship of the studios, and by the end of 2016 Brunetti had also left Relativity, while both remained executive producers on &quot;House of Cards&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

==== 2017–present: Career controversy and comeback attempts ====
In March 2017, it was announced that Spacey would portray J. Paul Getty in Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;All the Money in the World&quot;. He shot his role in the film in ten days over the summer of 2017. But because of the sexual assault allegations against Spacey, it was announced on November 8, 2017, that all of his footage would be excised, and that Christopher Plummer would replace him in reshoots. In spite of the very tight schedule, TriStar Pictures completed the new version of the film in time for a December 25 release. Spacey appeared in the film &quot;Billionaire Boys Club&quot;, which had a limited release on August 17, 2018. Vertical Entertainment stated that it would take no action to remove Spacey from the film, as it had been completed in late 2016, before the allegations made in October 2017.

Following the allegations leveled against him, Spacey maintained a lower profile and his career stalled. In May 2021, it was announced that he had been cast in a supporting role as a police detective in the crime drama film &quot;The Man Who Drew God&quot;, directed by and starring Franco Nero, which is about a blind artist who is wrongly accused of sexually abusing a child. The film reunited Spacey with Faye Dunaway, whom he directed in &quot;Albino Alligator&quot;. In August 2021, Spacey was reportedly filming in California for a small production, &quot;Peter Five Eight&quot;, in which he plays a &quot;charismatic&quot; serial killer.

On November 3, 2022, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Spacey was set to speak at the National Museum of Cinema and was going to receive a lifetime achievement award on January 16, 2023, despite the allegations against him. On November 28, 2022, after winning a sexual battery lawsuit against him filed by Anthony Rapp, Spacey was cast in the British indie thriller &quot;Control&quot;. Its director, Gene Fallaize, dismissed concerns about working with Spacey. In 2022, Spacey was cast as the late Croatian leader Franjo Tuđman in the political drama &quot;Once Upon a Time in Croatia&quot;, directed by Jakov Sedlar. In 2024, notable industry members such as actors Sharon Stone, Liam Neeson, F. Murray Abraham, and Stephen Fry, film director Paul Schrader and theatre director Trevor Nunn vocally supported Spacey&#x27;s attempts to return to acting.

=== Television ===
==== 1987–1994: Television debut and early roles ====
In 1987, Spacey made his first major television appearance in the second-season premiere of &quot;Crime Story&quot;, playing a Kennedy-esque American senator. That same year he appeared in spy thriller series &quot;The Equalizer&quot; as Detective Sergeant Cole in the episode &quot;Solo&quot;. He earned a fan base after playing the manic depressive arms dealer Mel Profitt on the television series &quot;Wiseguy&quot; (1988).

==== 2003–2012: HBO projects and other work ====
Spacey hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; twice: first in 1997 with musical guest Beck and special guests Michael Palin and John Cleese from &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; and again in May 2006 with musical guest Nelly Furtado. In 2008 Spacey starred as Ron Klain in the HBO original political drama film &quot;Recount&quot; revolving around Florida&#x27;s vote recount during the 2000 United States presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore. The film was written by Danny Strong and directed by Jay Roach and starred Bob Balaban, Laura Dern, John Hurt, Denis Leary, and Tom Wilkinson. The television film won three Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Television Movie. For his performance in the film, Spacey was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Miniseries or Television Film. That same year Spacey produced the TV movie &quot;Bernard and Doris&quot;, an HBO semi-fictionalized account of the relationship that developed between socialite heiress and philanthropist Doris Duke and her self-destructive Irish butler Bernard Lafferty later in her life. The film starred Ralph Fiennes and Susan Sarandon and was directed by Bob Balaban. The film premiered at the Hamptons International Film Festival to critical acclaim, and Spacey was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie. Spacey portrayed the antagonist Jonathan Irons in the 2014 video game &quot;Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare&quot; through motion capture.

Spacey is well known in Hollywood for his impressions. When he appeared on &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;, he imitated (at host James Lipton&#x27;s request) Jack Lemmon, James Stewart, Johnny Carson, Katharine Hepburn, Clint Eastwood, John Gielgud, Marlon Brando, Christopher Walken, and Al Pacino. On &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, Spacey admitted to using his vocal skills as a young actor in New York City to pretend to be Carson&#x27;s son to obtain free theatre tickets and to enter Studio 54. Spacey&#x27;s Capitol/EMI album &quot;Forever Cool&quot; (2007) features two duets with Spacey and an earlier recording of Dean Martin: &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Kick in the Head&quot; and &quot;King of the Road&quot;. In December 2007, Spacey co-hosted the Nobel Peace Prize Concert along with Uma Thurman.

==== 2013–2017: &quot;House of Cards&quot; and critical acclaim ====
On March 18, 2011, it was announced that Spacey was cast as Frank Underwood in the Netflix series &quot;House of Cards&quot;, adapted from a 1990 BBC political drama of the same name. He was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2013, becoming the first lead actor to be Primetime Emmy-nominated from a web television series. Spacey went on to win the Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Television Series Drama at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards and Screen Actors Guild nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards for his season 2 performance. He was fired from the series after the fifth season following multiple allegations of sexual misconduct.

== Acting credits and accolades ==

Spacey has won two Academy Awards, a Tony Award, a Golden Globe Award, four Screen Actors Guild Awards and a British Academy Film Award. He was nominated for a Grammy Award and for 12 Primetime Emmy Awards. Spacey received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1999 and was named an honorary Commander and Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2010 and 2015, respectively.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Personal life==
Spacey briefly dated American actress April Winchell after she graduated high school in the early 1980s. An article in &quot;The Sunday Times Magazine&quot; in 1999 stated that Spacey&#x27;s &quot;love affair with acting, and the absence of a visible partner in the life of an attractive 40-year-old, has resulted in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine asserting two years ago that he must be gay&quot;. Spacey responded to the rumors by telling &quot;Playboy&quot; and other interviewers that he was not gay, and by telling Lesley White of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; :I chose for a long time not to answer these questions because of the manner in which they were asked, and because I was never talking to someone I trusted, so why should I? Recently I chose to participate because it&#x27;s a little hard on the people I love.

In 1999, reports suggested Spacey was dating a script supervisor named Dianne Dreyer, with their relationship possibly dating back as far as 1992. In 2000, Spacey brought Dreyer to the Academy Awards; during the acceptance speech for his Best Actor award, Spacey said, &quot;Dianne, thank you for teaching me about caring about the right things, and I love you.&quot; In 2007, &quot;Gotham&quot; magazine quoted Spacey saying:I&#x27;ve never believed in pimping my personal life out for publicity. Although I might be interested in doing it, I will never do it. People can gossip all they want; they can speculate all they want. I just happen to believe that there&#x27;s a separation between the public life and the private life. Everybody has the right to a private life no matter what their professions are.

In 2017, Spacey came out as gay in a statement denying a sexual misconduct allegation. In 2023, Spacey was accused in court of using his decision to come out as gay to &quot;disguise&quot; his behavior.

===Political views and activism===

Spacey is a Democrat and has been described as left-leaning, with his political views mirroring some of those professed by his fictional character in &quot;House of Cards.&quot; Spacey worked on Jimmy Carter&#x27;s 1976 presidential campaign.

He is a friend of President Bill Clinton, having met Clinton before his presidency began. Spacey once described Clinton as &quot;one of the shining lights&quot; in the political process. He additionally made a cameo appearance in the short film &quot;President Clinton: Final Days&quot;, a light-hearted political satire produced by the Clinton Administration for the 2000 White House Correspondents Dinner.

Spacey has undertaken activism in the domain of HIV/AIDS. In 2002, he and fellow actor Chris Tucker accompanied Bill Clinton on a trip throughout several African countries to promote AIDS awareness on the continent. The trip gained renewed attention in 2019 amidst the sex trafficking charges against Jeffrey Epstein, whose plane was used. Spacey also participated in several fundraisers for HIV/AIDS healthcare, including amfAR Cinema Against AIDS in 2016 and the 25th Annual Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party in 2017.

Spacey met Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez in September 2007 but never spoke to the press about their encounter. During the trip, he visited the Venezuelan film studio Villa del Cine. In March 2011, following Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko&#x27;s crackdown on the Belarusian democracy movement, Spacey joined Jude Law in a street protest in London against Lukashenko&#x27;s regime.

In October 2008, Spacey started the Kevin Spacey Foundation in the UK to encourage youth involvement in the arts. Headquartered in England and Wales, its purpose was to provide grants to individuals and organizations to help young people study the arts, particularly theatre. The charity shut down in February 2018 following sexual misconduct allegations against Spacey.

In September 2006, Spacey said that he intended to take up British citizenship when it is offered to him. When asked about the UK&#x27;s 2016 European Union membership referendum, Spacey replied, &quot;I appreciate you asking me the question, but I am not a British citizen, I am a resident of Great Britain. And I have never in my twelve years ever gotten involved in politics in Great Britain. I think it&#x27;s inappropriate for me as a, really as a guest, in Great Britain, so I&#x27;ll leave that to the British people.&quot;

In 2024, Spacey endorsed Robert F. Kennedy Jr., running as an independent, in the 2024 United States presidential election.

==Sexual misconduct allegations==

In 2017, Spacey faced several allegations of sexual assault and sexual harassment. On October 29, 2017, actor Anthony Rapp was the first to accuse Spacey of sexual misconduct. In the following weeks, other accusers came forward, including actor Roberto Cavazos, filmmaker Tony Montana, Richard Dreyfuss&#x27;s son Harry, and at least eight people who worked on &quot;House of Cards&quot;.

In the wake of these claims, Netflix cut ties with Spacey, shelving his biopic of Gore Vidal and removing him from the last season of &quot;House of Cards&quot;. His completed role as J. Paul Getty in Ridley Scott&#x27;s film &quot;All the Money in the World&quot; (2017) was reshot with Christopher Plummer. Spacey has denied the accusations and was found not liable in a 2022 civil lawsuit filed by Rapp in New York. In a separate criminal case in London, he was acquitted by a jury of sexual assault charges in 2023.

<text>Kim Eric Drexler (born April 25, 1955) is an American engineer best known for introducing molecular nanotechnology (MNT), and his studies of its potential from the 1970s and 1980s. His 1991 doctoral thesis at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was revised and published as the book &quot;Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery Manufacturing and Computation&quot; (1992), which received the Association of American Publishers award for Best Computer Science Book of 1992. He has been called the &quot;godfather of nanotechnology&quot;.

==Life and work==

K. Eric Drexler was strongly influenced by ideas on limits to growth in the early 1970s. During his first year at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he sought out someone who was working on extraterrestrial resources. He found Gerard K. O&#x27;Neill of Princeton University, a physicist famous for his work on storage rings for particle accelerators and his landmark work on the concepts of space colonization. Drexler participated in NASA summer studies on space colonies in 1975 and 1976. He fabricated metal thin films a few tens of nanometers thick on a wax support to demonstrate the potentials of high-performance solar sails. He was active in space politics, helping the L5 Society defeat the Moon Treaty in 1980. Besides working summers for O&#x27;Neill, building mass driver prototypes, Drexler delivered papers at the first three Space Manufacturing conferences at Princeton. The 1977 and 1979 papers were co-authored with Keith Henson, and patents were issued on both subjects, vapor phase fabrication and space radiators.

During the late 1970s, Drexler began to develop ideas about molecular nanotechnology (MNT). In 1979, he encountered Richard Feynman&#x27;s provocative 1959 talk &quot;There&#x27;s Plenty of Room at the Bottom&quot;. In 1981, Drexler wrote a seminal research article, published by PNAS, &quot;Molecular engineering: An approach to the development of general capabilities for molecular manipulation&quot;. This article has continued to be cited, more than 620 times, during the following 35 years.

The term &quot;nano-technology&quot; had been coined by the Tokyo University of Science professor Norio Taniguchi in 1974 to describe the precision manufacture of materials with nanometer tolerances, and Drexler unknowingly used a related term in his 1986 book &quot;Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology&quot; to describe what later became known as molecular nanotechnology (MNT). In that book, he proposed the idea of a nanoscale &quot;assembler&quot; which would be able to build a copy of itself and of other items of arbitrary complexity. He also first published the term &quot;grey goo&quot; to describe what might happen if a hypothetical self-replicating molecular assembler went out of control. He has subsequently tried to clarify his concerns about out-of-control self-replicators, and make the case that molecular manufacturing does not require such devices.

===Education===

Drexler holds three degrees from MIT. He received his B.S. in Interdisciplinary Sciences in 1977 and his M.S. in 1979 in Astro/Aerospace Engineering with a master&#x27;s thesis titled &quot;Design of a High Performance Solar Sail System&quot;. In 1991, he earned a Ph.D. through the MIT Media Lab (formally, the Media Arts and Sciences Section, School of Architecture and Planning) after the department of electrical engineering and computer science refused to approve Drexler&#x27;s plan of study.

His Ph.D. work was the first doctoral degree on the topic of molecular nanotechnology and his thesis, &quot;Molecular Machinery and Manufacturing with Applications to Computation&quot;, was published (with minor editing) as &quot;Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing and Computation&quot; (1992), which received the Association of American Publishers award for Best Computer Science Book of 1992.

===Personal life===

In 1981, Drexler married Christine Peterson. The marriage ended in 2002.

In 2006, Drexler married Rosa Wang, a former investment banker who works with Ashoka: Innovators for the Public on improving the social capital markets.

Drexler has arranged to be cryonically preserved in the event of legal death.

==Reception==
Drexler&#x27;s work on nanotechnology was criticized as naive by Nobel Prize winner Richard Smalley in a 2001 &quot;Scientific American&quot; article. Smalley first argued that &quot;fat fingers&quot; made MNT impossible. He later argued that nanomachines would have to resemble chemical enzymes more than Drexler&#x27;s assemblers and could only work in water. Drexler maintained that both were straw man arguments, and in the case of enzymes, wrote that &quot;Prof. Klibanov wrote in 1994, &#x27; ... using an enzyme in organic solvents eliminates several obstacles ... &#x27;&quot; Drexler had difficulty in getting Smalley to respond, but in December 2003, Chemical and Engineering news carried a four-part debate. Ray Kurzweil disputes Smalley&#x27;s arguments.

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, in its 2006 review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative, argues that it is difficult to predict the future capabilities of nanotechnology:

===In science fiction===
Drexler is mentioned in Neal Stephenson&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;The Diamond Age&quot; as one of the heroes of a future world where nanotechnology is ubiquitous.

In the science fiction novel &quot;Newton&#x27;s Wake&quot; by Ken MacLeod, a &#x27;drexler&#x27; is a nanotech assembler of pretty much anything that can fit in the volume of the particular machine—from socks to starships.

Drexler is also mentioned in the science fiction book &quot;Decipher&quot; by Stel Pavlou; his book is mentioned as one of the starting points of nanomachine construction, as well as giving a better understanding of the way carbon 60 was to be applied.

James Rollins references Drexler&#x27;s &quot;Engines of Creation&quot; in his novel &quot;Excavation&quot;, using his theory of a molecular machine in two sections as a possible explanation for the mysterious &quot;Substance Z&quot; in the story.

Drexler gets a mention in Timothy Leary&#x27;s &quot;Design for Dying&quot; in the &quot;Mutation&quot; section, briefly detailing the 8-circuit model of consciousness (pg. 91).

Drexler is mentioned in DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; vol. 2, #57 (published July 1992).

Drexler is mentioned in Michael Crichton&#x27;s 2002 novel &quot;Prey&quot; in the introduction (pg xii).

The Drexler Facility (&quot;ドレクサー機関&quot;) of molecular nanotechnology research in the Japanese eroge visual novels &quot;Baldr Sky&quot; is named after him. The &quot;Assemblers&quot; are its key invention.

<doc id="16772" wikidata="Q8663" url="?curid=16772" title="Korean War">
<text>The Korean War (25 June 1950 – 27 July 1953) was an armed conflict on the Korean Peninsula fought between North Korea (Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea; DPRK) and South Korea (Republic of Korea; ROK) and their allies. North Korea was supported by the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Soviet Union, while South Korea was supported by the United Nations Command (UNC) led by the United States. The conflict was one of the first major proxy wars of the Cold War. Fighting ended in 1953 with an armistice but no peace treaty, leading to the ongoing Korean conflict.

After the end of World War II in 1945, Korea, which had been a Japanese colony for 35 years, was divided by the Soviet Union and the United States into two occupation zones at the 38th parallel, with plans for a future independent state. Due to political disagreements and influence from their backers, the zones formed their own governments in 1948. North Korea was led by Kim Il Sung in Pyongyang, and South Korea by Syngman Rhee in Seoul; both claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea and engaged in border clashes as internal unrest was fomented by communist groups in the south. On 25 June 1950, the Korean People&#x27;s Army (KPA), equipped and trained by the Soviets, launched an invasion of the south. In the absence of the Soviet Union&#x27;s representative, the UN Security Council denounced the attack and recommended member states to repel the invasion. UN forces comprised 21 countries, with the United States providing around 90% of military personnel.

Seoul was captured by the KPA on 28 June, and by early August, the Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) and its allies were nearly defeated, holding onto only the Pusan Perimeter in the peninsula&#x27;s southeast. On 15 September, UN forces landed at Inchon near Seoul, cutting off KPA troops and supply lines. UN forces broke out from the perimeter on 18 September, re-captured Seoul, and invaded North Korea in October, capturing Pyongyang and advancing towards the Yalu River—the border with China. On 19 October, the Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteer Army (PVA) crossed the Yalu and entered the war on the side of the north. UN forces retreated from North Korea in December, following the PVA&#x27;s first and second offensive. Communist forces captured Seoul again in January 1951 before losing it to a UN counter-offensive two months later. After an abortive Chinese spring offensive, UN forces retook territory roughly up to the 38th parallel. Armistice negotiations began in July 1951, but dragged on as the fighting became a war of attrition and the north suffered heavy damage from U.S. bombing.

Combat ended on 27 July 1953 with the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, which allowed the exchange of prisoners and created a wide Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) along the frontline, with a Joint Security Area at Panmunjom. The conflict caused more than 1 million military deaths and an estimated 2-to-3 million civilian deaths. Alleged war crimes include the mass killing of suspected communists by Seoul and the torture and starvation of prisoners of war by Pyongyang. North Korea became one of the most heavily bombed countries in history, and virtually all of Korea&#x27;s major cities were destroyed. No peace treaty has been signed, making the war a frozen conflict.

==Names==

In South Korea, the war is usually referred to as the &quot;625 War&quot; (), the &quot;625 Upheaval&quot; (), or simply &quot;625&quot;, reflecting the date of its commencement on 25 June.

In North Korea, the war is officially referred to as the &quot;Fatherland Liberation War&quot; () or the &quot;Chosŏn&quot; [Korean] &quot;War&quot; ().

In mainland China, the segment of the war after the intervention of the People&#x27;s Volunteer Army is commonly and officially known as the &quot;Resisting America and Assisting Korea War&quot; (), although the term &quot;&quot;Chosŏn&quot; War&quot; () is sometimes used unofficially. The term &quot;&quot;Hán&quot; (Korean) War&quot; () is most used in Taiwan (Republic of China), Hong Kong and Macau.

In the US, the war was initially described by President Harry S. Truman as a &quot;police action&quot; as the US never formally declared war and the operation was conducted under the auspices of the UN. It has been sometimes referred to in the English-speaking world as &quot;The Forgotten War&quot; or &quot;The Unknown War&quot; because of the lack of public attention it received relative to World War II and the Vietnam War.

==Background==
===Imperial Japanese rule (1910–1945)===

Imperial Japan diminished the influence of China over Korea in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–95). A decade later, after defeating Imperial Russia in the Russo-Japanese War, Japan made the Korean Empire its protectorate with the Eulsa Treaty in 1905, then annexed it with the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910.

Many Korean nationalists fled the country. The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was founded in 1919 in Nationalist China. It failed to achieve international recognition, failed to unite the nationalist groups, and had a fractious relationship with its US-based founding president, Syngman Rhee.

In China, the nationalist National Revolutionary Army and the communist People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) helped organize Korean refugees against the Japanese military, which had also occupied parts of China. The Nationalist-backed Koreans, led by Yi Pom-Sok, fought in the Burma campaign (1941-45). The communists, led by, among others, Kim Il Sung, fought the Japanese in Korea and Manchuria. At the Cairo Conference in 1943, China, the UK, and the US decided that &quot;in due course, Korea shall become free and independent&quot;.

===Korea divided (1945–1949)===
At the Tehran Conference in 1943 and the Yalta Conference in February 1945, the Soviet Union promised to join its allies in the Pacific War within three months of the victory in Europe. The USSR declared war on Japan and invaded Manchuria on 8 August 1945. On 10 August, Soviet forces entered northern Korea and secured most major cities in the north by 24 August. Japanese resistance was light. Having fought Japan on Korean soil, the Soviet forces were well-received by Koreans.

On 10 August in Washington, US Colonels Dean Rusk and Charles H. Bonesteel III were assigned to divide Korea into Soviet and US occupation zones and proposed the 38th parallel as the dividing line. This was incorporated into the US General Order No. 1, which responded to the Japanese surrender on 15 August. Explaining the choice of the 38th parallel, Rusk observed, &quot;Even though it was further north than could be realistically reached by U. S. [&quot;sic&quot;] forces in the event of Soviet disagreement ... we felt it important to include the capital of Korea in the area of responsibility of American troops&quot;. Joseph Stalin, however, maintained his wartime policy of cooperation, and on 16 August, the Red Army halted at the 38th parallel for three weeks to await the arrival of US forces.

On 7 September 1945, General Douglas MacArthur issued Proclamation No. 1 to the people of Korea, announcing US military control over Korea south of the 38th parallel and establishing English as the official language during military control. On 8 September, US Lieutenant General John R. Hodge arrived in Incheon to accept the Japanese surrender south of the 38th parallel. Appointed as military governor, Hodge directly controlled South Korea as head of the United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK 1945–48).

In December 1945, Korea was administered by a US–Soviet Union Joint Commission, as agreed at the Moscow Conference, to grant independence after a five-year trusteeship. Waiting five years for independence was unpopular among Koreans, and riots broke out. To contain them, the USAMGIK banned strikes on 8 December and outlawed the PRK Revolutionary Government and People&#x27;s Committees on 12 December. Following further civilian unrest, the USAMGIK declared martial law.

Citing the inability of the Joint Commission to make progress, the US government decided to hold an election under UN auspices to create an independent Korea. The Soviet authorities and Korean communists refused to cooperate on the grounds it would not be fair, and many South Korean politicians boycotted it. The 1948 South Korean general election was held in May. The resultant South Korean government promulgated a national political constitution on 17 July and elected Syngman Rhee as president on 20 July. The Republic of Korea (South Korea) was established on 15 August 1948. 

In the Soviet-Korean Zone of Occupation, the Soviets agreed to the establishment of a communist government led by Kim Il Sung. The 1948 North Korean parliamentary elections took place in August. The Soviet Union withdrew its forces in 1948 and the US in 1949.

===Chinese Civil War (1945–1949)===
With the end of the war with Japan, the Chinese Civil War resumed in earnest between the Communists and the Nationalist-led government. While the Communists were struggling for supremacy in Manchuria, they were supported by the North Korean government with matériel and manpower. According to Chinese sources, the North Koreans donated 2,000 railway cars worth of supplies while thousands of Koreans served in the Chinese PLA during the war. North Korea also provided the Chinese Communists in Manchuria with a safe refuge for non-combatants and communications with the rest of China. As a token of gratitude, between 50,000 and 70,000 Korean veterans who served in the PLA were sent back along with their weapons, and they later played a significant role in the initial invasion of South Korea. China promised to support the North Koreans in the event of a war against South Korea.

===Communist insurgency in South Korea (1948–1950)===

By 1948, a North Korea-backed insurgency had broken out in the southern half of the peninsula. This was exacerbated by the undeclared border war between the Koreas, which saw division-level engagements and thousands of deaths on both sides. The ROK was almost entirely trained and focused on counterinsurgency, rather than conventional warfare. They were equipped and advised by a force of a few hundred American officers, who were successful in helping the ROKA to subdue guerrillas and hold its own against North Korean military (Korean People&#x27;s Army, KPA) forces along the 38th parallel. Approximately 8,000 South Korean soldiers and police officers died in the insurgent war and border clashes.

The first socialist uprising occurred without direct North Korean participation, though the guerrillas still professed support for the northern government. Beginning in April 1948 on Jeju Island, the campaign saw arrests and repression by the South Korean government in the fight against the South Korean Labor Party, resulting in 30,000 violent deaths, among them 14,373 civilians, of whom ~2,000 were killed by rebels and ~12,000 by ROK security forces. The Yeosu–Suncheon rebellion overlapped with it, as several thousand army defectors waving red flags massacred right-leaning families. This resulted in another brutal suppression by the government and between 2,976 and 3,392 deaths. By May 1949, both uprisings had been crushed.

Insurgency reignited in the spring of 1949 when attacks by guerrillas in the mountainous regions (buttressed by army defectors and North Korean agents) increased. Insurgent activity peaked in late 1949 as the ROKA engaged so-called People&#x27;s Guerrilla Units. Organized and armed by the North Korean government, and backed by 2,400 KPA commandos who had infiltrated through the border, these guerrillas launched an offensive in September aimed at undermining the South Korean government and preparing the country for the KPA&#x27;s arrival in force. This offensive failed. However, the guerrillas were now entrenched in the Taebaek-san region of the North Gyeongsang Province and the border areas of the Gangwon Province.

While the insurgency was ongoing, the ROKA and KPA engaged in battalion-sized battles along the border, starting in May 1949. Border clashes between South and North continued on 4 August 1949, when thousands of North Korean troops attacked South Korean troops occupying territory north of the 38th parallel. The 2nd and 18th ROK Infantry Regiments repulsed attacks in Kuksa-bong, and KPA troops were &quot;completely routed&quot;. Border incidents decreased by the start of 1950.

Meanwhile, counterinsurgencies in the South Korean interior intensified; persistent operations, paired with worsening weather, denied the guerrillas sanctuary and wore away their fighting strength. North Korea responded by sending more troops to link up with insurgents and build more partisan cadres; North Korean infiltrators had reached 3,000 soldiers in 12 units by the start of 1950, but all were destroyed or scattered by the ROKA. 

On 1 October 1949, the ROKA launched a three-pronged assault on the insurgents in South Cholla and Taegu. By March 1950, the ROKA claimed 5,621 guerrillas killed or captured and 1,066 small arms seized. This operation crippled the insurgency. Soon after, North Korea made final attempts to keep the uprising active, sending battalion-sized units of infiltrators under the commands of Kim Sang-ho and Kim Moo-hyon. The first battalion was reduced to a single man over the course of engagements by the ROKA 8th Division. The second was annihilated by a two-battalion hammer-and-anvil maneuver by units of the ROKA 6th Division, resulting in a toll of 584 KPA guerrillas (480 killed, 104 captured) and 69 ROKA troops killed, plus 184 wounded. By the spring of 1950, guerrilla activity had mostly subsided; the border, too, was calm.

===Prelude to war (1950)===
By 1949, South Korean and US military actions had reduced indigenous communist guerrillas in the South from 5,000 to 1,000. However, Kim Il Sung believed widespread uprisings had weakened the South Korean military and that a North Korean invasion would be welcomed by much of the South Korean population. Kim began seeking Stalin&#x27;s support for an invasion in March 1949, traveling to Moscow to persuade him.

Stalin initially did not think the time was right for a war in Korea. PLA forces were still embroiled in the Chinese Civil War, while US forces remained stationed in South Korea. By spring 1950, he believed that the strategic situation had changed: PLA forces under Mao Zedong had secured final victory, US forces had withdrawn from Korea, and the Soviets had detonated their first nuclear bomb, breaking the US monopoly. As the US had not directly intervened to stop the communists in China, Stalin calculated they would be even less willing to fight in Korea, which had less strategic significance. The Soviets had cracked the codes used by the US to communicate with their embassy in Moscow, and reading dispatches convinced Stalin that Korea did not have the importance to the US that would warrant a nuclear confrontation. Stalin began a more aggressive strategy in Asia based on these developments, including promising economic and military aid to China through the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance.

In April 1950, Stalin permitted Kim to attack the government in the South, under the condition that Mao would agree to send reinforcements if needed. For Kim, this was the fulfillment of his goal to unite Korea. Stalin made it clear Soviet forces would not openly engage in combat, to avoid a direct war with the United States. 

Kim met with Mao in May 1950 and differing historical interpretations of the meeting have been put forward. According to Barbara Barnouin and Yu Changgeng, Mao agreed to support Kim despite concerns of American intervention, as China desperately needed the economic and military aid promised by the Soviets. Kathryn Weathersby cites Soviet documents which said Kim secured Mao&#x27;s support. Along with Mark O&#x27;Neill, she says this accelerated Kim&#x27;s war preparations. Chen Jian argues Mao never seriously challenged Kim&#x27;s plans and Kim had every reason to inform Stalin that he had obtained Mao&#x27;s support. Citing more recent scholarship, Zhao Suisheng contends Mao did not approve of Kim&#x27;s war proposal and requested verification from Stalin, who did so via a telegram. Mao accepted the decision made by Kim and Stalin to unify Korea but cautioned Kim over possible US intervention.

Soviet generals with extensive combat experience from World War II were sent to North Korea as the Soviet Advisory Group. They completed plans for attack by May and called for a skirmish to be initiated in the Ongjin Peninsula on the west coast of Korea. The North Koreans would then launch an attack to capture Seoul and encircle and destroy the ROK. The final stage would involve destroying South Korean government remnants and capturing the rest of South Korea, including the ports.

On 7 June 1950, Kim called for a Korea-wide election on 5–8 August 1950 and a consultative conference in Haeju on 15–17 June. On 11 June, the North sent three diplomats to the South as a peace overture, which Rhee rejected outright. On 21 June, Kim revised his war plan to involve a general attack across the 38th parallel, rather than a limited operation in Ongjin. Kim was concerned that South Korean agents had learned about the plans and that South Korean forces were strengthening their defenses. Stalin agreed to this change.

While these preparations were underway in the North, there were clashes along the 38th parallel, especially at Kaesong and Ongjin, many initiated by the South. The ROK was being trained by the US Korean Military Advisory Group (KMAG). On the eve of the war, KMAG commander General William Lynn Roberts voiced utmost confidence in the ROK and boasted that any North Korean invasion would merely provide &quot;target practice&quot;. For his part, Syngman Rhee repeatedly expressed his desire to conquer the North, including when US diplomat John Foster Dulles visited Korea on 18 June.

Though some South Korean and US intelligence officers predicted an attack, similar predictions had been made before and nothing had happened. The Central Intelligence Agency noted the southward movement by the KPA but assessed this as a &quot;defensive measure&quot; and concluded an invasion was &quot;unlikely&quot;. On 23 June UN observers inspected the border and did not detect that war was imminent.

===Comparison of forces===
Chinese involvement was extensive from the beginning, building on previous collaboration between the Chinese and Korean communists during the Chinese Civil War. Throughout 1949 and 1950, the Soviets continued arming North Korea. After the communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, ethnic Korean units in the PLA were sent to North Korea.

In the fall of 1949, two PLA divisions composed mainly of Korean-Chinese troops (the 164th and 166th) entered North Korea, followed by smaller units throughout the rest of 1949. The reinforcement of the KPA with PLA veterans continued into 1950, with the 156th Division and several other units of the former Fourth Field Army arriving in February; the PLA 156th Division was reorganized as the KPA 7th Division. By mid-1950, between 50,000 and 70,000 former PLA troops had entered North Korea, forming a significant part of the KPA&#x27;s strength on the eve of the war&#x27;s beginning. The combat veterans and equipment from China, the tanks, artillery, and aircraft supplied by the Soviets, and rigorous training increased North Korea&#x27;s military superiority over the South, armed by the U.S. military with mostly small arms, but no heavy weaponry.

Several generals, such as Lee Kwon-mu, were PLA veterans born to ethnic Koreans in China. While older histories of the conflict often referred to these ethnic Korean PLA veterans as being sent from northern Korea to fight in the Chinese Civil War before being sent back, recent Chinese archival sources studied by Kim Donggill indicate that this was not the case. Rather, the soldiers were indigenous to China, as part of China&#x27;s longstanding ethnic Korean community, and were recruited to the PLA in the same way as any other Chinese citizen.

According to the first official census in 1949, the population of North Korea numbered 9,620,000, and by mid-1950, North Korean forces numbered between 150,000 and 200,000 troops, organized into 10 infantry divisions, one tank division, and one air force division, with 210 fighter planes and 280 tanks, who captured scheduled objectives and territory, among them Kaesong, Chuncheon, Uijeongbu, and Ongjin. Their forces included 274 T-34-85 tanks, 200 artillery pieces, 110 attack bombers, 150 Yak fighter planes, and 35 reconnaissance aircraft. In addition to the invasion force, the North had 114 fighters, 78 bombers, 105 T-34-85 tanks, and some 30,000 soldiers stationed in reserve in North Korea. Although each navy consisted of only several small warships, the North and South Korean navies fought in the war as seaborne artillery for their armies.

In contrast, the South Korean population was estimated at 20 million, but its army was unprepared and ill-equipped. As of 25 June 1950, the ROK had 98,000 soldiers (65,000 combat, 33,000 support), no tanks (they had been requested from the U.S. military, but requests were denied), and a 22-plane air force comprising 12 liaison-type and 10 AT-6 advanced-trainer airplanes. Large U.S. garrisons and air forces were in Japan, but only 200–300 U.S. troops were in Korea.

==Course of the war==

=== Operation Pokpung ===
At dawn on 25 June 1950, the KPA crossed the 38th parallel behind artillery fire. It justified its assault with the claim ROK troops attacked first and that the KPA were aiming to arrest and execute the &quot;bandit traitor Syngman Rhee&quot;. Fighting began on the strategic Ongjin Peninsula in the west. There were initial South Korean claims that the 17th Regiment had counterattacked at Haeju; some scholars argue the claimed counterattack was instead the instigating attack, and therefore that the South Koreans may have fired first. However, the report that contained the Haeju claim contained errors and outright falsehoods.

KPA forces attacked all along the 38th parallel within an hour. The KPA had a combined arms force including tanks supported by heavy artillery. The ROK had no tanks, anti-tank weapons, or heavy artillery. The South Koreans committed their forces in a piecemeal fashion, and these were routed in a few days.

On 27 June, Rhee evacuated Seoul with some of the government. At 02:00 on 28 June the ROK blew up the Hangang Bridge across the Han River in an attempt to stop the KPA. The bridge was detonated while 4,000 refugees were crossing it, and hundreds were killed. Destroying the bridge trapped many ROK units north of the river. In spite of such desperate measures, Seoul fell that same day. Some South Korean National Assemblymen remained in Seoul when it fell, and 48 subsequently pledged allegiance to the North.

On 28 June, Rhee ordered the massacre of suspected political opponents in his own country. In five days, the ROK, which had 95,000 troops on 25 June, was down to less than 22,000 troops. In early July, when US forces arrived, what was left of the ROK was placed under US operational command of the United Nations Command.

===Factors in U.S. intervention===

The Truman administration was unprepared for the invasion. Korea was not included in the strategic Asian Defense Perimeter outlined by United States Secretary of State Dean Acheson. Military strategists were more concerned with the security of Europe against the Soviet Union than that of East Asia. The administration was worried a war in Korea could quickly escalate without American intervention. Diplomat John Foster Dulles stated: &quot;To sit by while Korea is overrun by unprovoked armed attack would start a disastrous chain of events leading most probably to world war.&quot;

While there was hesitance by some in the US government to get involved, considerations about Japan fed into the decision to engage on behalf of South Korea. After the fall of China to the communists, US experts saw Japan as the region&#x27;s counterweight to the Soviet Union and China. While there was no US policy dealing with South Korea directly as a national interest, its proximity to Japan increased its importance. Said Kim: &quot;The recognition that the security of Japan required a non-hostile Korea led directly to President Truman&#x27;s decision to intervene ... The essential point ... is that the American response to the North Korean attack stemmed from considerations of U.S. policy toward Japan.&quot;

Another consideration was the Soviet reaction if the US intervened. The Truman administration was fearful a Korean war was a diversionary assault that would escalate to a general war in Europe once the US committed in Korea. At the same time, &quot;[t]here was no suggestion from anyone that the United Nations or the United States could back away from [the conflict]&quot;. Yugoslavia—a possible Soviet target because of the Tito-Stalin split—was vital to the defense of Italy and Greece, and the country was first on the list of the National Security Council&#x27;s post-North Korea invasion list of &quot;chief danger spots&quot;. Truman believed if aggression went unchecked, a chain reaction would start that would marginalize the UN and encourage communist aggression elsewhere. The UN Security Council approved the use of force to help the South Koreans, and the US immediately began using air and naval forces in the area to that end. The Truman administration still refrained from committing troops on the ground, because advisers believed the North Koreans could be stopped by air and naval power alone.

The Truman administration was uncertain whether the attack was a ploy by the Soviet Union, or just a test of US resolve. The decision to commit ground troops became viable when a communiqué was received on 27 June indicating the Soviet Union would not move against US forces in Korea. The Truman administration believed it could intervene in Korea without undermining its commitments elsewhere.

===United Nations Security Council resolutions===

On 25 June 1950, the United Nations Security Council unanimously condemned the North Korean invasion of South Korea with Resolution 82. The Soviet Union, a veto-wielding power, had boycotted Council meetings since January 1950, protesting Taiwan&#x27;s occupation of China&#x27;s permanent seat. The Security Council, on 27 June 1950, published Resolution 83 recommending member states provide military assistance to the Republic of Korea. On 27 June President Truman ordered U.S. air and sea forces to help. On 4 July the Soviet deputy foreign minister accused the U.S. of starting armed intervention on behalf of South Korea.

The Soviet Union challenged the legitimacy of the war for several reasons. The ROK intelligence upon which Resolution 83 was based came from US Intelligence; North Korea was not invited as a sitting temporary member of the UN, which violated UN Charter Article 32; and the fighting was beyond the Charter&#x27;s scope, because the initial north–south border fighting was classed as a civil war. Because the Soviet Union was boycotting the Security Council, some legal scholars posited that deciding upon this type of action required the unanimous vote of all five permanent members.

Within days of the invasion, masses of ROK soldiers—of dubious loyalty to the Syngman Rhee regime—were retreating southwards or defecting en masse to the northern side, the KPA.

===United States&#x27; response (July–August 1950)===
As soon as word of the attack was received, Acheson informed Truman that the North Koreans had invaded South Korea. Truman and Acheson discussed a US invasion response and agreed the US was obligated to act, comparing the North Korean invasion with Adolf Hitler&#x27;s aggressions in the 1930s, and the mistake of appeasement must not be repeated. US industries were mobilized to supply materials, labor, capital, production facilities, and other services necessary to support the military objectives of the Korean War. Truman later explained he believed fighting the invasion was essential to the containment of communism as outlined in the National Security Council Report 68 (NSC 68):

In August 1950, Truman and Acheson obtained the consent of Congress to appropriate $12 billion for military action, equivalent to $ billion in . Because of the extensive defense cuts and emphasis on building a nuclear bomber force, none of the services were able to make a robust response with conventional military strength. General Omar Bradley, Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was faced with deploying a force that was a shadow of its World War II counterpart.

Acting on Acheson&#x27;s recommendation, Truman ordered MacArthur, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in Japan, to transfer matériel to the South Korean military, while giving air cover to evacuation of US nationals. Truman disagreed with advisers who recommended unilateral bombing of the North Korean forces and ordered the U.S. Seventh Fleet to protect Taiwan, whose government asked to fight in Korea. The US denied Taiwan&#x27;s request for combat, lest it provoke retaliation from the PRC. Because the US had sent the Seventh Fleet to &quot;neutralize&quot; the Taiwan Strait, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai criticized the UN and US initiatives as &quot;armed aggression on Chinese territory&quot;. The US supported the Kuomintang in Burma in the hope these KMT forces would harass China from the southwest, thereby diverting Chinese resources from Korea.

===The drive south and Pusan (July–September 1950)===

The Battle of Osan, the first significant US engagement, involved the 540-soldier Task Force Smith, a small forward element of the 24th Infantry Division flown in from Japan. On 5 July 1950, Task Force Smith attacked the KPA at Osan but without weapons capable of destroying KPA tanks. The KPA defeated the US, with 180 American casualties. The KPA progressed southwards, pushing back US forces at Pyongtaek, Chonan, and Chochiwon, forcing the 24th Division&#x27;s retreat to Taejeon, which the KPA captured in the Battle of Taejon. The 24th Division suffered 3,602 dead and wounded and 2,962 captured, including its commander, Major General William F. Dean.

By August, the KPA steadily pushed back the ROK and the Eighth United States Army southwards. The impact of the Truman administration&#x27;s defense budget cutbacks was keenly felt, as US troops fought costly rearguard actions. Facing a veteran and well-led KPA force, and lacking sufficient anti-tank weapons, artillery or armor, the Americans retreated and the KPA advanced down the Peninsula. By September, UN forces were hemmed into a corner of southeast Korea, near Pusan. This perimeter enclosed about 10% of Korea, in a line defined by the Nakdong River.

The KPA purged South Korea&#x27;s intelligentsia by killing civil servants and intellectuals. On 20 August, MacArthur warned Kim Il Sung he would be held responsible for KPA atrocities.

Kim&#x27;s early successes led him to predict the war would finish by the end of August. Chinese leaders were more pessimistic. To counter a possible US deployment, Zhou secured a Soviet commitment to have the Soviet Union support Chinese forces with air cover, and he deployed 260,000 soldiers along the Korean border, under the command of Gao Gang. Zhou authorized a topographical survey of Korea and directed Lei Yingfu, Zhou&#x27;s military adviser in Korea, to analyze the military situation. Lei concluded MacArthur would likely attempt a landing at Incheon. After conferring with Mao that this would be MacArthur&#x27;s most likely strategy, Zhou briefed Soviet and North Korean advisers of Lei&#x27;s findings, and issued orders to PLA commanders to prepare for US naval activity in the Korea Strait.

In the resulting Battle of Pusan Perimeter, UN forces withstood KPA attacks meant to capture the city at the Naktong Bulge, P&#x27;ohang-dong, and Taegu. The United States Air Force (USAF) interrupted KPA logistics with 40 daily ground support sorties, which destroyed 32 bridges, halting daytime road and rail traffic. KPA forces were forced to hide in tunnels by day and move only at night. To deny military equipment and supplies to the KPA, the USAF destroyed logistics depots, refineries, and harbors, while U.S. Navy aircraft attacked transport hubs. Consequently, the overextended KPA could not be supplied throughout the south. On 27 August, 67th Fighter Squadron aircraft mistakenly attacked facilities in Chinese territory, and the Soviet Union called the Security Council&#x27;s attention to China&#x27;s complaint about the incident. The US proposed a commission of India and Sweden determine what the US should pay in compensation, but the Soviets vetoed this.

Meanwhile, US garrisons in Japan continually dispatched soldiers and military supplies to reinforce defenders in the Pusan Perimeter. MacArthur went so far as to call for Japan&#x27;s rearmament. Tank battalions deployed to Korea, from the port of San Francisco to the port of Pusan, the largest Korean port. By late August, the Pusan Perimeter had 500 medium tanks battle-ready. In early September 1950, UN forces outnumbered the KPA 180,000 to 100,000 soldiers.

===Battle of Incheon (September 1950)===
Against the rested and rearmed Pusan Perimeter defenders and their reinforcements, the KPA were undermanned and poorly supplied; unlike the UN, they lacked naval and air support. To relieve the Pusan Perimeter, MacArthur recommended an amphibious landing at Incheon, near Seoul, well over behind the KPA lines. On 6 July, he ordered Major General Hobart R. Gay, commander of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, to plan an amphibious landing at Incheon; on 12–14 July, the 1st Cavalry Division embarked from Yokohama, Japan, to reinforce the 24th Infantry Division inside the Pusan Perimeter.

Soon after the war began, MacArthur began planning an Incheon landing, but the Pentagon opposed him. When authorized, he activated a combined US Army and Marine Corps, and ROK force. The X Corps, consisted of 40,000 troops of the 1st Marine Division, the 7th Infantry Division and around 8,600 ROK soldiers. By 15 September, the amphibious force faced few KPA defenders at Incheon: military intelligence, psychological warfare, guerrilla reconnaissance, and protracted bombardment facilitated a light battle. However, the bombardment destroyed most of Incheon.

===Breakout from the Pusan Perimeter===

On 16 September Eighth Army began its breakout from the Pusan Perimeter. Task Force Lynch, 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, and 70th Tank Battalion units advanced through of KPA territory to join the 7th Infantry Division at Osan on 27 September. X Corps rapidly defeated the KPA defenders around Seoul, thus threatening to trap the main KPA force.

On 18 September, Stalin dispatched General H. M. Zakharov to advise Kim to halt his offensive around the Pusan Perimeter, and redeploy his forces to defend Seoul. Chinese commanders were not briefed on North Korean troop numbers or operational plans. Zhou suggested the North Koreans should attempt to eliminate the UN forces at Incheon only if they had reserves of at least 100,000 men; otherwise, he advised the North Koreans to withdraw their forces north.

On 25 September, Seoul was recaptured by UN forces. US air raids caused heavy damage to the KPA, destroying most of its tanks and artillery. KPA troops in the south, instead of effectively withdrawing north, rapidly disintegrated, leaving Pyongyang vulnerable. During the retreat, only 25,000-30,000 KPA soldiers managed to reach the KPA lines. On 27 September, Stalin convened an emergency session of the Politburo, where he condemned the incompetence of the KPA command and held Soviet military advisers responsible for the defeat.

===UN forces invade North Korea (September–October 1950)===

On 27 September, MacArthur received secret National Security Council Memorandum 81/1 from Truman reminding him operations north of the 38th parallel were authorized only if &quot;at the time of such operation there was no entry into North Korea by major Soviet or Chinese Communist forces, no announcements of intended entry, nor a threat to counter our operations militarily&quot;. On 29 September, MacArthur restored the government of the Republic of Korea under Syngman Rhee. The Joint Chiefs of Staff on 27 September sent MacArthur a comprehensive directive: it stated the primary goal was the destruction of the KPA, with unification of the Peninsula under Rhee as a secondary objective &quot;if possible&quot;; the Joint Chiefs added this objective was dependent on whether the Chinese and Soviets would intervene, and was subject to changing conditions.
On 30 September, Zhou warned the US that China was prepared to intervene if the US crossed the 38th parallel. Zhou attempted to advise KPA commanders on how to conduct a general withdrawal by using the same tactics that allowed Chinese Communist forces to escape Nationalist encirclement campaigns in the 1930s, but KPA commanders did not use these tactics effectively. Bruce Cumings argues, however, that the KPA&#x27;s rapid withdrawal was strategic, with troops melting into the mountains from where they could launch guerrilla raids on the UN forces spread out on the coasts.

By 1 October, the UN Command had driven the KPA past the 38th parallel, and RoK forces pursued the KPA northwards. MacArthur demanded the KPA&#x27;s unconditional surrender. On 7 October, with UN authorization, the UN Command forces followed the ROK forces northwards. The Eighth US Army drove up western Korea and captured Pyongyang on 19 October. On 20 October, the US 187th Airborne Regiment made their first of their two combat jumps during the war at Sunchon and Sukchon. The mission was to cut the road north going to China, preventing North Korean leaders from escaping Pyongyang, and to rescue US prisoners of war.

At month&#x27;s end, UN forces held 135,000 KPA prisoners of war. As they neared the Sino-Korean border, the UN forces in the west were divided from those in the east by of mountainous terrain. In addition to the 135,000 captured, the KPA had suffered some 200,000 soldiers killed or wounded, for a total of 335,000 casualties since end of June 1950, and lost 313 tanks. A mere 25,000 KPA regulars retreated across the 38th parallel, as their military had collapsed. The UN forces on the peninsula numbered 229,722 combat troops (including 125,126 Americans and 82,786 South Koreans), 119,559 rear area troops, and 36,667 US Air Force personnel. MacArthur believed it necessary to extend the war into China to destroy depots supplying the North Korean effort. Truman disagreed and ordered caution at the Sino-Korean border.

===China intervenes (October–December 1950)===
On 3 October 1950, China attempted to warn the US, through its embassy in India, it would intervene if UN forces crossed the Yalu River. The US did not respond as policymakers in Washington, including Truman, considered it a bluff.

On 15 October Truman and MacArthur met at Wake Island. This was much publicized because of MacArthur&#x27;s discourteous refusal to meet the president in the contiguous US. To Truman, MacArthur speculated there was little risk of Chinese intervention in Korea, and the PRC&#x27;s opportunity for aiding the KPA had lapsed. He believed the PRC had 300,000 soldiers in Manchuria and 100,000–125,000 at the Yalu River. He concluded that, although half of those forces might cross south, &quot;if the Chinese tried to get down to Pyongyang, there would be the greatest slaughter&quot; without Soviet air force protection.

Meanwhile on 13 October, the Politburo decided China would intervene even without Soviet air support, basing its decision on a belief superior morale could defeat an enemy that had superior equipment. To that end, 200,000 Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteer Army (PVA) troops crossed the Yalu into North Korea. UN aerial reconnaissance had difficulty sighting PVA units in daytime, because their march and bivouac discipline minimized detection. The PVA marched &quot;dark-to-dark&quot; (19:00–03:00), and aerial camouflage (concealing soldiers, pack animals, and equipment) was deployed by 05:30. Meanwhile, daylight advance parties scouted for the next bivouac site. During daylight activity or marching, soldiers remained motionless if an aircraft appeared; PVA officers were under orders to shoot security violators. Such battlefield discipline allowed a three-division army to march the from An-tung, Manchuria, to the combat zone in 19 days. Another division night-marched a circuitous mountain route, averaging daily for 18 days.

After secretly crossing the Yalu River on 19 October, the PVA 13th Army Group launched the First Phase Offensive on 25 October, attacking advancing UN forces near the Sino-Korean border. This decision made solely by China changed the attitude of the Soviet Union. Twelve days after PVA troops entered the war, Stalin allowed the Soviet Air Forces to provide air cover and supported more aid to China. After inflicting heavy losses on the ROK II Corps at the Battle of Onjong, the first confrontation between Chinese and US military occurred on 1 November 1950. Deep in North Korea, thousands of soldiers from the PVA 39th Army encircled and attacked the US 8th Cavalry Regiment with three-prong assaults—from the north, northwest, and west—and overran the defensive position flanks in the Battle of Unsan.

On 13 November, Mao appointed Zhou overall commander and coordinator of the war effort, with Peng Dehuai as field commander. On 25 November, on the Korean western front, the PVA 13th Army Group attacked and overran the ROK II Corps at the Battle of the Ch&#x27;ongch&#x27;on River, and then inflicted heavy losses on the US 2nd Infantry Division on the UN forces&#x27; right flank. Believing they could not hold against the PVA, the Eighth Army began to retreat, crossing the 38th parallel in mid-December.

In the east, on 27 November, the PVA 9th Army Group initiated the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. Here, the UN forces fared better: like the Eighth Army, the surprise attack forced X Corps to retreat from northeast Korea, but they were able to break out from the attempted encirclement by the PVA and execute a successful tactical withdrawal. X Corps established a defensive perimeter at the port city of Hungnam on 11 December and evacuated by 24 December, to reinforce the depleted Eighth Army to the south. About 193 shiploads of UN forces and matériel (approximately 105,000 soldiers, 98,000 civilians, 17,500 vehicles, and 350,000 tons of supplies) were evacuated to Pusan. The SS &quot;Meredith Victory&quot; was noted for evacuating 14,000 refugees, the largest rescue operation by a single ship, even though it was designed to hold 12 passengers. Before escaping, the UN forces razed most of Hungnam, with particular attention to the port.

In early December UN forces, including the British Army&#x27;s 29th Infantry Brigade, evacuated Pyongyang along with refugees. Around 4.5 million North Koreans are estimated to have fled South or elsewhere abroad. On 16 December Truman declared a national state of emergency with Proclamation No. 2914, 3 C.F.R. 99 (1953), which remained in force until September 1978. The next day, 17 December, Kim Il Sung was deprived of the right of command of KPA by China.

===Fighting around the 38th parallel (January–June 1951)===
A ceasefire presented by the UN to the PRC, after the Battle of the Ch&#x27;ongch&#x27;on River on 11 December, was rejected by the PRC, which was convinced of the PVA&#x27;s invincibility after its victory in that battle and the wider Second Phase Offensive. With Lieutenant General Matthew Ridgway assuming command of the Eighth Army on 26 December, the PVA and the KPA launched their Third Phase Offensive on New Year&#x27;s Eve. Using night attacks in which UN fighting positions were encircled and assaulted by numerically superior troops, who had the element of surprise, the attacks were accompanied by loud trumpets and gongs, which facilitated tactical communication and disoriented the enemy. UN forces had no familiarity with this tactic, and some soldiers panicked, abandoning their weapons and retreating to the south. The offensive overwhelmed UN forces, allowing the PVA and KPA to capture Seoul for the second time on 4 January 1951.

These setbacks prompted MacArthur to consider using nuclear weapons against the Chinese or North Korean interiors, intending radioactive fallout zones to interrupt the Chinese supply chains. However, upon the arrival of the charismatic General Ridgway, the &quot;esprit de corps&quot; of the bloodied Eighth Army revived.

UN forces retreated to Suwon in the west, Wonju in the center, and the territory north of Samcheok in the east, where the battlefront stabilized and held. The PVA had outrun its logistics capability and thus were unable to press on beyond Seoul as food, ammunition, and matériel were carried nightly, on foot and bicycle, from the border at the Yalu River to the three battle lines. On 25 late January, upon finding that the PVA had abandoned their battle lines, Ridgway ordered a reconnaissance-in-force, which became Operation Thunderbolt. A full-scale advance fully exploited the UN&#x27;s air superiority, concluding with the UN forces reaching the Han River and recapturing Wonju.

Following the failure of ceasefire negotiations in January, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 498 on 1 February, condemning the PRC as an aggressor and calling upon its forces to withdraw from Korea.

In early February, the ROK 11th Division ran an operation to destroy guerrillas and pro-DPRK sympathizers in the South Gyeongsang Province. The division and police committed the Geochang and Sancheong–Hamyang massacres. In mid-February, the PVA counterattacked with the Fourth Phase Offensive and achieved victory at Hoengseong. However, the offensive was blunted by US IX Corps at Chipyong-ni in the center. The US 23rd Regimental Combat Team and French Battalion fought a short but desperate battle that broke the attack&#x27;s momentum. The battle is sometimes known as the &quot;Gettysburg of the Korean War&quot;: 5,600 U.S., and French troops were surrounded by 25,000 PVA. UN forces had previously retreated in the face of large PVA/KPA forces instead of getting cut off, but this time, they stood and won.
In the last two weeks of February 1951, Operation Thunderbolt was followed by Operation Killer, carried out by the revitalized Eighth Army. It was a full-scale, battlefront-length attack staged for maximum exploitation of firepower to kill as many KPA and PVA troops as possible. Operation Killer concluded with US I Corps re-occupying the territory south of the Han River, and IX Corps capturing Hoengseong. On 7 March the Eighth Army attacked with Operation Ripper, expelling the PVA and the KPA from Seoul on 14 March. This was the fourth and final conquest of the city in a year, leaving it a ruin; the 1.5 million pre-war population was down to 200,000 and people were suffering from food shortages.

On 6 March MacArthur gave a press conference at Suwon where he stated &quot;Assuming no diminution of the enemy’s flow of ground forces and materiel to the Korean battle area, a continuation of the existing limitation upon our freedom of counter-offensive action, and no major additions to our organizational strength, the battle lines cannot fail in time to reach a point of theoretical stalemate.&quot; No one in Washington disputed MacArthur’s prediction that a stalemate could develop out of the conditions obtaining. But a military victory, because of the commitments and risks an attempt to achieve it would entail, was no longer considered a practical objective. The preferred course, preferred because it would be consistent with the greater strategy and ongoing preparations against the possibility of world war, was to seek a cease-fire and a negotiated settlement of Korean issues. On 12 March Ridgway gave his own press conference at his command post at Yoju stating that regaining the 38th parallel would be a &quot;tremendous victory&quot; for the Eighth Army. It would mean that the encroachment of communism in Korea had been stopped - exactly what the UNC had set out to accomplish. Conversely, if the Chinese failed to drive the UNC out of Korea, they would have &quot;failed monumentally.&quot; In any case, he emphasized, &quot;we didn&#x27;t set out to conquer China.&quot;

In late April, Peng sent his deputy, Hong Xuezhi, to brief Zhou in Beijing. What Chinese soldiers feared, Hong said, was not the enemy, but having no food, bullets, or trucks to transport them to the rear when they were wounded. Zhou attempted to respond to the PVA&#x27;s logistical concerns by increasing Chinese production and improving supply methods, but these were never sufficient. Large-scale air defense training programs were carried out and the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) began participating in the war from September 1951 onward. The Fourth Phase Offensive had failed to match the achievements of the Second Phase or the limited gains of the Third Phase. The UN forces, after earlier defeats and retraining, proved much harder to infiltrate by Chinese light infantry than in previous months. From 31 January to 21 April, the Chinese suffered 53,000 casualties.

On 11 April Truman relieved General MacArthur as supreme commander in Korea for several reasons. MacArthur had crossed the 38th parallel in the mistaken belief the Chinese would not enter the war, leading to major allied losses. He believed the use of nuclear weapons should be his decision, not the president&#x27;s. MacArthur threatened to destroy China unless it surrendered. While MacArthur felt total victory was the only honorable outcome, Truman was more pessimistic about his chances once involved in a larger war, feeling a truce and orderly withdrawal could be a valid solution. MacArthur was the subject of congressional hearings in May and June 1951, which determined he had defied the orders of the president and thus violated the US Constitution. A popular criticism of MacArthur was he never spent a night in Korea and directed the war from the safety of Tokyo.

Ridgway was appointed supreme commander, and he regrouped the UN forces for successful counterattacks while General James Van Fleet assumed command of the Eighth Army. Further attacks depleted the PVA and KPA forces; Operations Courageous (23–28 March) and Tomahawk (23 March) (a combat jump by the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team) were joint ground and airborne infiltrations meant to trap PVA forces between Kaesong and Seoul. UN forces advanced to the &quot;Kansas Line&quot;, north of the 38th parallel.

The PVA counterattacked in April 1951, with the Fifth Phase Offensive, with three field armies (700,000 men). The first thrust of the offensive fell upon I Corps, which fiercely resisted in the Battle of the Imjin River (22–25 April) and Battle of Kapyong (22–25 April), blunting the impetus of the offensive, which was halted at the &quot;No-name Line&quot; north of Seoul. Casualty ratios were grievously disproportionate; Peng had expected a 1:1 or 2:1 ratio, but instead, Chinese combat casualties from 22 to 29 April totaled between 40,000 and 60,000 compared to only 4,000 for the UN—a ratio between 10:1 and 15:1. By the time Peng had called off the attack in the western sector on 29 April, the three participating armies had lost a third of their front-line combat strength within a week. On 15 May the PVA commenced the second impulse of the spring offensive and attacked the ROK and U.S. X Corps in the east at the Soyang River. Approximately 370,000 PVA and 114,000 KPA troops had been mobilized, with the bulk attacking in the eastern sector, with about a quarter attempting to pin the I Corps and IX Corps in the western sector. After initial success, they were halted by 20 May and repulsed over the following days, with Western histories generally designating 22 May as the end of the offensive.

At month&#x27;s end, the Chinese planned the third step of the Fifth Phase Offensive (withdrawal), which they estimated would take 10-15 days to complete for their 340,000 remaining men, and set the date for the night of 23 May. They were caught off guard when the Eighth Army counterattacked and regained the &quot;Kansas Line&quot; on the morning of 12 May, 23 hours before the expected withdrawal. The surprise attack turned the retreat into &quot;the most severe loss since our forces had entered Korea&quot;; between 16-23 May, the PVA suffered another 45,000 to 60,000 casualties before their soldiers managed to evacuate. The Fifth Phase Offensive as a whole had cost the PVA 102,000 soldiers (85,000 killed/wounded, 17,000 captured), with significant losses for the KPA.

The end of the Fifth Phase Offensive preceded the start of the UN May–June 1951 counteroffensive. During the counteroffensive, the US-led coalition captured land up to about north of the 38th parallel, with most forces stopping at the &quot;Kansas Line&quot; and a minority going further to the &quot;Wyoming Line.&quot; PVA and KPA forces suffered greatly, especially in the Chuncheon sector and at Chiam-ni and Hwacheon; in the latter sector alone the PVA/KPA suffered over 73,207 casualties, including 8,749 captured, compared to 2,647 total casualties of the IX Corps.

The halt at the &quot;Kansas Line&quot; and offensive action stand-down began the stalemate that lasted until the armistice of 1953. The disastrous failure of the Fifth Phase Offensive (which Peng recalled as one of only four mistakes he made in his military career) &quot;led Chinese leaders to change their goal from driving the UNF out of Korea to merely defending China&#x27;s security and ending the war through negotiations&quot;.

===Stalemate (July 1951–July 1953)===
For the rest of the war, the UN and the PVA/KPA fought but exchanged little territory. Large-scale bombing of North Korea continued, and protracted armistice negotiations began on 10 July 1951 at Kaesong in the North. On the Chinese side, Zhou directed peace talks, and Li Kenong and Qiao Guanghua headed the negotiation team. Combat continued; the goal of the UN forces was to recapture all of South Korea and avoid losing territory. The PVA and the KPA attempted similar operations and later effected military and psychological operations to test the UN Command&#x27;s resolve to continue the war.

The sides constantly traded artillery fire along the front, with American-led forces possessing a large firepower advantage over Chinese-led forces. In the last three months of 1952 the UN fired 3,553,518 field gun shells and 2,569,941 mortar shells, while the communists fired 377,782 field gun shells and 672,194 mortar shells: a 5.8:1 ratio. The communist insurgency, reinvigorated by North Korean support and scattered bands of KPA stragglers, resurged in the south.

In the autumn of 1951, Van Fleet ordered Major General Paik Sun-yup to break the back of guerrilla activity. The UN&#x27;s limited offensive (31 August – 12 November) to shorten and straighten sections of the lines, acquire better defensive terrain, and deny the enemy key vantage points, saw heavy fighting by UN forces, with I Corps and X Corps making limited tactical advances against PVA and KPA forces. The campaign resulted in approximately 60,000 casualties, including 22,000 Americans. The intense battles at Bloody Ridge, the Punchbowl and Heartbreak Ridge underscored the challenges of penetrating the Chinese &quot;active defense.&quot; Despite PVA/KPA losses of 100,000–150,000 troops, these were not crippling, and the PVA forces remained resolute. By November, the UNC abandoned major offensive operations, and the PVA launched counterattacks with some success.

From December 1951 to March 1952, ROK security forces claimed to have killed 11,090 partisans and sympathizers and captured 9,916 more.

PVA troops suffered from deficient military equipment, logistical problems, overextended communication and supply lines, and the constant threat of UN bombers. These factors led to a rate of Chinese casualties far greater than the casualties suffered by UN troops. The situation became so serious that in November 1951 Zhou called a conference in Shenyang to discuss the PVA&#x27;s logistical problems. It was decided to accelerate the construction of railways and airfields, to increase the trucks available to the army, and to improve air defense by any means possible. These commitments did little to address the problems.
In the months after the Shenyang conference, Peng went to Beijing several times to brief Mao and Zhou about the heavy casualties and the increasing difficulty of keeping front lines supplied with basic necessities. Peng was convinced the war would be protracted and that neither side would be able to achieve victory in the near future. On 24 February 1952, the Military Commission, presided over by Zhou, discussed the PVA&#x27;s logistical problems with members of government agencies. After government representatives emphasized their inability to meet the war demands, Peng shouted: &quot;You have this and that problem... You should go to the front and see with your own eyes what food and clothing the soldiers have! Not to speak of the casualties! For what are they giving their lives? We have no aircraft. We have only a few guns. Transports are not protected. More and more soldiers are dying of starvation. Can&#x27;t you overcome some of your difficulties?&quot; The atmosphere became so tense Zhou was forced to adjourn the conference. Zhou called a series of meetings, where it was agreed the PVA would be divided into three groups, to be dispatched to Korea in shifts; to accelerate training of pilots; to provide more anti-aircraft guns to front lines; to purchase more military equipment and ammunition from the Soviet Union; to provide the army with more food and clothing; and to transfer the responsibility of logistics to the central government.

With peace negotiations ongoing, the Chinese attempted a final offensive in the final weeks of the war to capture territory: on 10 June, 30,000 Chinese troops struck South Korean and U.S. divisions on a front, and on 13 July, 80,000 Chinese soldiers struck the east-central Kumsong sector, with the brunt of their attack falling on 4 South Korean divisions. The Chinese had success in penetrating South Korean lines but failed to capitalize, particularly when US forces responded with overwhelming firepower. Chinese casualties in their final major offensive (above normal wastage for the front) were about 72,000, including 25,000 killed compared to 14,000 for the UN (most were South Koreans, 1,611 were Americans).

While Chinese forces grappled with significant logistical and supply difficulties, the stalemate also stemmed from mounting frustrations within the UNC. Despite superior firepower, the war proved difficult to fight and the US public was becoming impatient of a war that was lacking a victory. By mid-1951, the stalemate had worn away Truman&#x27;s public approval, and political pressures mounted on the Truman administration to seek an end to the fighting. On 29 November 1952 U.S. President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower went to Korea to learn what might end the war. Eisenhower took office on 20 January 1953 and his administration prioritized containment over rollback and sought to reduce American involvement in the conflict, contributing to the later armistice.

===Armistice (July 1953–November 1954)===
The on-again, off-again armistice negotiations continued for two years, first at Kaesong, then Panmunjom. A problematic point was prisoner of war repatriation. The PVA, KPA and UN Command could not agree on a system of repatriation because many PVA and KPA soldiers refused to be repatriated back to the north, which was unacceptable to the Chinese and North Koreans. A Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was set up to handle the matter.

Stalin died on 5 March. The new Soviet leaders, engaged in their internal power struggle, had no desire to continue supporting China&#x27;s efforts and called for an end to the hostilities. China could not continue without Soviet aid, and North Korea was no longer a major player. Armistice talks entered a new phase. With UN acceptance of India&#x27;s proposed Korean War armistice, the KPA, PVA and UN Command signed the armistice agreement on 27 July 1953. South Korean President Syngman Rhee refused to sign. The war ended at this point, even though there was no peace treaty. North Korea nevertheless claims it won the war.

Under the agreement, the belligerents established the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) which mostly follows the 38th parallel. In the eastern part, the DMZ runs north of the 38th parallel; to the west, it travels south of it. Kaesong, site of the initial negotiations, was in pre-war South Korea but is now part of North Korea. The DMZ has since been patrolled by the KPA and the ROKA, with the US still operating as the UN Command.

Operation Glory was conducted from July to November 1954, to allow combatants to exchange their dead. The remains of 4,167 US Army and US Marine Corps dead were exchanged for 13,528 KPA and PVA dead, and 546 civilians dead in UN POW camps were delivered to the South Korean government. After Operation Glory, 416 Korean War unknown soldiers were buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, on Oahu, Hawaii. Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO) records indicate the PRC and North Korea transmitted 1,394 names, of which 858 were correct. From 4,167 containers of returned remains, forensic examination identified 4,219 individuals. Of these, 2,944 were identified as from the US, and all but 416 were identified by name. From 1996 to 2006, North Korea recovered 220 remains near the Sino-Korean border.

===Continued division (1954–present)===
The Armistice Agreement provided for monitoring by an international commission. Since 1953, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, composed of members from the Swiss and Swedish armed forces, has been stationed near the DMZ.

In April 1975, South Vietnam&#x27;s capital of Saigon was captured by the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam. Encouraged by that communist success, Kim Il Sung saw it as an opportunity to invade South Korea. Kim visited China in April 1975 and met with Mao and Zhou to ask for military aid. Despite Pyongyang&#x27;s expectations, Beijing refused to help North Korea in another war.

Since the armistice, there have been incursions and acts of aggression by North Korea. From 1966 to 1969, many cross-border incursions took place in what has been referred to as the Korean DMZ Conflict or Second Korean War. In 1968, a North Korean commando team unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate South Korean president Park Chung Hee in the Blue House Raid. In 1976, the Korean axe murder incident was widely publicized. Since 1974, 4 incursion tunnels leading to Seoul have been uncovered. In 2010, a North Korean submarine torpedoed and sank the South Korean corvette , resulting in the deaths of 46 sailors. Again in 2010, North Korea fired artillery shells on Yeonpyeong island, killing 2 military personnel and 2 civilians.

After a new wave of UN sanctions, on 11 March 2013, North Korea claimed that the armistice had become invalid. On 13 March, North Korea confirmed it ended the Armistice and declared North Korea &quot;is not restrained by the North-South declaration on non-aggression&quot;. On 30 March, North Korea stated it entered a &quot;state of war&quot; and &quot;the long-standing situation of the Korean peninsula being neither at peace nor at war is finally over&quot;. Speaking on 4 April, US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said that Pyongyang &quot;formally informed&quot; the Pentagon that it &quot;ratified&quot; the potential use of a nuclear weapon against South Korea, Japan and the US, including Guam and Hawaii. Hagel stated the US would deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-ballistic missile system to Guam because of a credible and realistic nuclear threat.

In 2016, it was revealed North Korea approached the US about conducting formal peace talks to end the war officially. While the White House agreed to secret peace talks, the plan was rejected because North Korea refused to discuss nuclear disarmament as part of the treaty. In 2018, it was announced that North Korea and South Korea agreed to talk to end the conflict. They committed themselves to the complete denuclearization of the Peninsula. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in signed the Panmunjom Declaration. In September 2021, Moon reiterated his call to end the war formally, in a speech at the UN.

==Casualties==
About 3 million people were killed in the war, mostly civilians, making it perhaps the deadliest conflict of the Cold War era. Samuel Kim lists the war as the deadliest conflict in East Asia—the region most affected by armed conflict related to the Cold War. Though only rough estimates of civilian fatalities are available, scholars have noted that the percentage of civilian casualties in Korea was higher than World War II or the Vietnam War, with Bruce Cumings putting civilian casualties at 2 million and Guenter Lewy in the range of 2-3 million.

Cumings states that civilians represent at least half the war&#x27;s casualties, while Lewy suggests it may have gone as high as 70%, compared to his estimates of 42% in World War II and 30%–46% in Vietnam. Data compiled by the Peace Research Institute Oslo lists just under 1 million battle deaths over the war and a mid-estimate of 3 million total deaths, attributing the difference to excess mortality among civilians from one-sided massacres, starvation, and disease. Compounding this devastation for civilians, virtually all major cities on the Peninsula were destroyed. In per capita and absolute terms, North Korea was the most devastated by the war. According to Charles K. Armstrong, the war resulted in the death of an estimated 12%–15% of the North Korean population ( 10 million), &quot;a figure close to or surpassing the proportion of Soviet citizens killed in World War II&quot;.

===Military===

South Korea reported some 137,899 military deaths and 24,495 missing, 450,742 wounded, 8,343 POW. The US suffered 33,686 battle deaths, 7,586 missing, along with 2,830 non-battle deaths. There were 17,730 other non-battle US military deaths that occurred outside Korea during the same period that were erroneously included as war deaths until 2000. The US suffered 103,284 wounded in action. UN losses, excluding those of the US or South Korea, amounted to 4,141 dead and 12,044 wounded in action.

American combat casualties were over 90% of non-Korean UN losses. US battle deaths were 8,516 up to their first engagement with the Chinese on 1 November 1950. The first four months prior to the Chinese intervention were by far the bloodiest per day for US forces, as they engaged the well-equipped KPA in intense fighting. American medical records show that from July to October 1950, the army sustained 31% of the combat deaths it ultimately incurred in the entire 37-month war. The US spent US$30 billion on the war. Some 1,789,000 American soldiers served in the war, accounting for 31% of the 5,720,000 Americans who served on active duty worldwide from June 1950 to July 1953.

Deaths from non-American UN militaries totaled 3,730, with another 379 missing. 

Chinese sources reported that the PVA suffered 114,000 battle deaths, 21,000 deaths from wounds, 13,000 deaths from illness, 340,000 wounded, and 7,600 missing. 7,110 Chinese POWs were repatriated to China. In 2010, the Chinese government revised their official tally of war losses to 183,108 dead (114,084 in combat, 70,000 deaths from wounds, illness and other causes) and 21,374 POW, 25,621 missing. Overall, 73% of Chinese infantry troops served in Korea (25 of 34 armies, or 79 of 109 infantry divisions, were rotated in). More than 52% of the Chinese air force, 55% of the tank units, 67% of the artillery divisions, and 100% of the railroad engineering divisions were sent to Korea as well. Chinese soldiers who served in Korea faced a greater chance of being killed than those who served in World War II or the Chinese Civil War. China spent over 10 billion yuan on the war (roughly US$3.3 billion), not counting USSR aid. This included $1.3 billion in money owed to the Soviet Union by the end of it. This was a relatively large cost, as China had only 4% of the national income of the US. Spending on the war constituted 34–43% of China&#x27;s annual government budget from 1950 to 1953, depending on the year. Despite its underdeveloped economy, Chinese military spending was the world&#x27;s fourth largest globally for most of the war after that of the US, the Soviet Union, and the UK; however, by 1953, with the winding down of the Korean War and the escalation of the First Indochina War, French spending also surpassed Chinese spending by about a third.

According to the South Korean Ministry of National Defense, North Korean military losses totaled 294,151 dead, 91,206 missing, and 229,849 wounded, giving North Korea the highest military deaths of any belligerent in absolute and relative terms. The PRIO Battle Deaths Dataset gave a similar figure for North Korean military deaths of 316,579. Chinese sources reported similar figures for the North Korean military of 290,000 &quot;casualties&quot; and 90,000 captured. The financial cost of the war for North Korea was massive in direct losses and lost economic activity; the country was devastated by the cost of the war and the American strategic bombing campaign, which, among other things, destroyed 85% of North Korea&#x27;s buildings and 95% of its power generation. The Soviet Union suffered 299 dead, with 335 planes lost.

The Chinese and North Koreans estimated that about 390,000 soldiers from the US, 660,000 soldiers from South Korea and 29,000 other UN soldiers were &quot;eliminated&quot; from the battlefield. Western sources estimate the PVA suffered about 400,000 killed and 486,000 wounded, while the KPA suffered 215,000 killed, 303,000 wounded, and over 101,000 captured or missing. Cumings cites a much higher figure of 900,000 fatalities among Chinese soldiers.

===Civilian===
According to the South Korean Ministry of National Defense, there were over 750,000 confirmed violent civilians deaths during the war, another million civilians were pronounced missing, and millions more ended up as refugees. Estimates of the number of civilians killed in the entire war range from 244,000 to 990,000 for South Korea. The North Korean government has never published estimates of civilian deaths in the war, but more than one million killed has been an estimate common among historians who have studied the Korean War. Over 1.5 million North Koreans fled to the South.

=== War crimes ===

There were numerous atrocities and massacres of civilians throughout the Korean War committed by both sides, starting in the war&#x27;s first days. In 2005–2010, a South Korean Truth and Reconciliation Commission investigated atrocities and other human rights violations through much of the 20th century, from the Japanese colonial period through the Korean War and beyond. It excavated some mass graves from the Bodo League massacres and confirmed the general outlines of those political executions. Of the Korean War-era massacres the commission was petitioned to investigate, 82% were perpetrated by South Korean forces, with 18% perpetrated by North Korean forces.

The commission also received petitions alleging more than 200 large-scale killings of South Korean civilians by the U.S. military during the war, mostly air attacks. It confirmed several such cases, including refugees crowded into a cave attacked with napalm bombs, which survivors said killed 360 people, and an air attack that killed 197 refugees gathered in a field in the far south. It recommended South Korea seek reparations from the United States, but in 2010, a reorganized commission under a new, conservative government concluded that most U.S. mass killings resulted from &quot;military necessity&quot;, while in a small number of cases, they concluded, the U.S. military had acted with &quot;low levels of unlawfulness&quot;, but the commission recommended against seeking reparations.

Almost every substantial building in North Korea was destroyed during the war. The war&#x27;s highest-ranking U.S. POW, Major General William F. Dean, reported that the majority of North Korean cities and villages he saw were either rubble or snow-covered wasteland. North Korean factories, schools, hospitals, and government offices were forced to move underground, and air defenses were &quot;non-existent&quot;. North Korea ranks as among the most heavily bombed countries in history, and the U.S. dropped a total of 635,000 tons of bombs (including 32,557 tons of napalm) on Korea, more than during the entire Pacific War. By the end of the war, eighteen of the twenty-two major cities in North Korea had been at least half obliterated according to damage assessments by the U.S. Air Force. During a Senate hearing in the spring of 1951, MacArthur expressed his horror at the devastation that the war was inflicting on the Koreans, describing it as the worst he had ever seen in his military career. As the most humane solution, MacArthur suggested that the war should be escalated in order to bring it to an end sooner.

==Characteristics==
===U.S. unpreparedness===
In postwar analysis of the unpreparedness of US forces deployed during the summer and fall of 1950, Army Major General Floyd L. Parks stated &quot;Many who never lived to tell the tale had to fight the full range of ground warfare from offensive to delaying action, unit by unit, man by man ... [T]hat we were able to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat ... does not relieve us from the blame of having placed our own flesh and blood in such a predicament.&quot;
By 1950, US Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson had established a policy of faithfully following Truman&#x27;s defense economization plans and aggressively attempted to implement it, even in the face of steadily increasing external threats. He consequently received much of the blame for the initial setbacks and widespread reports of ill-equipped and inadequately trained military forces in the war&#x27;s early stages.

As an initial response to the invasion, Truman called for a naval blockade of North Korea and was shocked to learn that such a blockade could be imposed only &quot;on paper&quot; since the U.S. Navy no longer had the warships with which to carry out his request. Army officials, desperate for weaponry, recovered Sherman tanks and other equipment from Pacific War battlefields and reconditioned them for shipment to Korea. Army ordnance officials at Fort Knox pulled down M26 Pershing tanks from display pedestals around Fort Knox in order to equip the third company of the Army&#x27;s hastily formed 70th Tank Battalion. Without adequate numbers of tactical fighter-bomber aircraft, the Air Force took F-51 (P-51) propeller-driven aircraft out of storage or from existing Air National Guard squadrons and rushed them into front-line service. A shortage of spare parts and qualified maintenance personnel resulted in improvised repairs and overhauls. A Navy helicopter pilot aboard an active duty warship recalled fixing damaged rotor blades with masking tape in the absence of spares.

U.S. Army Reserve and Army National Guard infantry soldiers and new inductees (called to duty to fill out understrength infantry divisions) found themselves short of nearly everything needed to repel the North Korean forces: artillery, ammunition, heavy tanks, ground-support aircraft, even effective anti-tank weapons such as the M20 3.5-inch (89 mm) &quot;Super Bazooka&quot;. Some Army combat units sent to Korea were supplied with worn-out, &quot;red-lined&quot; M1 rifles or carbines in immediate need of ordnance depot overhaul or repair. Only the Marine Corps, whose commanders had stored and maintained their World War II surplus inventories of equipment and weapons, proved ready for deployment, though they still were woefully understrength, as well as in need of suitable landing craft to practice amphibious operations (Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson had transferred most of the remaining craft to the Navy and reserved them for use in training Army units).

===Armored warfare===
The initial assault by KPA forces was aided by the use of Soviet T-34-85 tanks. A KPA tank corps equipped with about 120 T-34s spearheaded the invasion. These faced an ROK that had few anti-tank weapons adequate to deal with the T-34s. Additional Soviet armor was added as the offensive progressed. The KPA tanks had a good deal of early successes against ROK infantry, Task Force Smith, and the U.S. M24 Chaffee light tanks that they encountered. Interdiction by ground attack aircraft was the only means of slowing the advancing KPA armor. The tide turned in favor of the UN forces in August 1950 when the KPA suffered major tank losses during a series of battles in which the UN forces brought heavier equipment to bear, including American M4A3 Sherman and M26 medium tanks, alongside British Centurion, Churchill and Cromwell tanks.

The Incheon landings on 15 September cut off the KPA supply lines, causing their armored forces and infantry to run out of fuel, ammunition, and other supplies. As a result of this and the Pusan perimeter breakout, the KPA had to retreat, and many of the T-34s and heavy weapons had to be abandoned. By the time the KPA withdrew from the South, 239 T-34s and 74 SU-76 self-propelled guns were lost. After November 1950, KPA armor was rarely encountered.

Following the initial assault by the North, the Korean War saw limited use of tanks and featured no large-scale tank battles. The mountainous, forested terrain, especially in the eastern central zone, was poor tank country, limiting their mobility. Through the last two years of the war in Korea, UN tanks served largely as infantry support and mobile artillery pieces.

===Naval warfare===

Because neither Korea had a significant navy, the war featured few naval battles. A skirmish between North Korea and the UN Command occurred on 2 July 1950; the U.S. Navy cruiser , the Royal Navy cruiser and the Royal Navy frigate fought four North Korean torpedo boats and two mortar gunboats, and sank them. USS &quot;Juneau&quot; later sank several ammunition ships that had been present. The last sea battle of the Korean War occurred days before the Battle of Incheon; the ROK ship &quot;PC-703&quot; sank a North Korean minelayer in the Battle of Haeju Island, near Incheon. Three other supply ships were sunk by &quot;PC-703&quot; two days later in the Yellow Sea.

During most of the war, the UN navies patrolled the west and east coasts of North Korea, sinking supply and ammunition ships and denying the North Koreans the ability to resupply from the sea. Aside from very occasional gunfire from North Korean shore batteries, the main threat to UN navy ships was from magnetic mines. During the war, five U.S. Navy ships were lost to mines: two minesweepers, two minesweeper escorts, and one ocean tug. Mines and coastal artillery damaged another 87 U.S. warships.

===Aerial warfare===
The war was the first in which jet aircraft played the central role in air combat. Once-formidable fighters such as the P-51 Mustang, F4U Corsair, and Hawker Sea Fury—all piston-engined, propeller-driven, and designed during World War II—relinquished their air-superiority roles to a new generation of faster, jet-powered fighters arriving in the theater. For the initial months of the war, the P-80 Shooting Star, F9F Panther, Gloster Meteor, and other jets under the UN flag dominated the Korean People&#x27;s Air Force (KPAF) propeller-driven Soviet Yakovlev Yak-9 and Lavochkin La-9s. By early August 1950, the KPAF was reduced to only about 20 planes.
The Chinese intervention in late October 1950 bolstered the KPAF with the MiG-15, one of the world&#x27;s most advanced jet fighters. The USAF countered the MiG-15 by sending over three squadrons of its most capable fighter, the F-86 Sabre. These arrived in December 1950. The Soviet Union denied the involvement of their personnel in anything other than an advisory role, but air combat quickly resulted in Soviet pilots dropping their code signals and speaking over the radio in Russian. This known direct Soviet participation was a &quot;casus belli&quot; that the UN Command deliberately overlooked, lest the war expand to include the Soviet Union and potentially escalate into atomic warfare.

After the war and to the present day, the USAF reported an inflated F-86 Sabre kill ratio in excess of 10:1, with 792 MiG-15s and 108 other aircraft shot down by Sabres, and 78 Sabres lost to enemy fire. The Soviet Air Force reported some 1,100 air-to-air victories and 335 MiG combat losses, while China&#x27;s PLAAF reported 231 combat losses, mostly MiG-15s, and 168 other aircraft lost. The KPAF reported no data, but the UN Command estimates some 200 KPAF aircraft lost in the war&#x27;s first stage, and 70 additional aircraft after the Chinese intervention. The USAF disputes Soviet and Chinese claims of 650 and 211 downed F-86s, respectively.

More modern American estimates place the overall USAF kill ratio at around 1.8:1 with the ratio dropping to 1.3:1 against MiG-15s with Soviet pilots but increasing to a dominant 12:1 against Chinese and North Korean adversaries.

Reports by Lieutenant General Sidor Slyusarev, commander of Soviet air forces in Korea, are more favorable to the communist side. The 64th Corps claimed a total 1,097 enemy aircraft of all types during operations, for the loss of 335 aircraft (including lost to enemy ground fire, accidents, etc) and 110 pilots. Soviet reports put the overall kill ratio at 3.4:1 in favor of Soviet pilots. As reported, effectiveness of the Soviet fighters declined as the war progressed. from an overall kill ratio of 7.9:1 from November 1950 through January 1952, declining to 2.2:1 in later 1952 and 1.9:1 in 1953. This was because more advanced jet fighters appeared on the UN side as well as improved U.S. tactics.

Regardless of the actual ratio, American Sabres were very effective at controlling the skies over Korea. Since no other UN fighter could contend with the MiG-15, F-86s largely took over air combat once they arrived, relegating other aircraft to air-to-ground operations. Despite much greater numbers (the number of Sabres in theater never exceeded 150 while MiG-15s reached 900 at their peak), communist aircraft were seldom encountered south of Pyongyang. UN ground forces, supply lines, and infrastructure were not attacked from the air. Although North Korea had 75 airfields capable of supporting MiGs, after 1951, any serious effort to operate from them was abandoned. The MiGs were instead based across the Yalu River in the safety of China. This confined most air-to-air engagements to MiG Alley. UN aircraft had free rein to conduct strike missions over enemy territory with little fear of interception. Although jet dogfights are remembered as a prominent part of the Korean War, counter-air missions comprised just 12% of Far East Air Forces sorties, and four times as many sorties were performed for close air support and interdiction.

The war marked a major milestone not only for fixed-wing aircraft, but also for rotorcraft, featuring the first large-scale deployment of helicopters for medical evacuation (medevac). In 1944–45, during World War II, the YR-4 helicopter had seen limited ambulance duty. In Korea, where rough terrain prevented use of the jeep as a speedy medevac vehicle, helicopters like the Sikorsky H-19 were heavily used. This helped reduce fatal casualties to a dramatic degree when combined with complementary medical innovations such as Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals (MASH). As such, the medical evacuation and care system for the wounded was so effective for the UN forces that a wounded soldier who arrived at a MASH unit alive typically had a 97% chance of survival. The limitations of jet aircraft for close air support highlighted the helicopter&#x27;s potential in the role, leading to the development of the helicopter gunships used in the Vietnam War.

===U.S. threat of atomic warfare===
On 5 November 1950, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff issued orders for the retaliatory atomic bombing of Manchurian PRC military bases, if either of their armies crossed into Korea or if PRC or KPA bombers attacked Korea from there. President Truman ordered the transfer of nine Mark 4 nuclear bombs &quot;to the Air Force&#x27;s Ninth Bomb Group, the designated carrier of the weapons ... [and] signed an order to use them against Chinese and Korean targets&quot;, which he never transmitted.

Many U.S. officials viewed the deployment of nuclear-capable (but not nuclear-armed) B-29 bombers to Britain as helping to resolve the Berlin Blockade of 1948–1949. Truman and Eisenhower both had military experience and viewed nuclear weapons as potentially usable components of their military. During Truman&#x27;s first meeting to discuss the war on 25 June 1950, he ordered plans be prepared for attacking Soviet forces if they entered the war. By July, Truman approved another B-29 deployment to Britain, this time with bombs (but without their cores), to remind the Soviets of U.S. offensive ability. Deployment of a similar fleet to Guam was leaked to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. As UN forces retreated to Pusan, and the CIA reported that mainland China was building up forces for a possible invasion of Taiwan, the Pentagon believed that Congress and the public would demand using nuclear weapons if the situation in Korea required them.

As PVA forces pushed back the UN forces from the Yalu River, Truman stated during a 30 November 1950 press conference that using nuclear weapons was &quot;always [under] active consideration&quot;, with control under the local military commander. Indian ambassador K. Madhava Panikkar reports &quot;that Truman announced he was thinking of using the atom bomb in Korea. But the Chinese seemed unmoved by this threat ... The PRC&#x27;s propaganda against the U.S. was stepped up. The &#x27;Aid Korea to resist America&#x27; campaign was made the slogan for increased production, greater national integration, and more rigid control over anti-national activities. One could not help feeling that Truman&#x27;s threat came in useful to the leaders of the Revolution, to enable them to keep up the tempo of their activities.&quot;

After his statement caused concern in Europe, Truman met on 4 December with UK Prime Minister and Commonwealth spokesman Clement Attlee, French Premier René Pleven, and French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman to discuss their worries about atomic warfare and its likely continental expansion. The U.S.&#x27; forgoing atomic warfare was not because of &quot;a disinclination by the Soviet Union and People&#x27;s Republic of China to escalate [the Korean War]&quot;, but because UN allies—notably the UK, the Commonwealth, and France—were concerned about a geopolitical imbalance rendering NATO defenseless while the U.S. fought China, who then might persuade the Soviet Union to conquer Western Europe. The Joint Chiefs of Staff advised Truman to tell Attlee that the U.S. would use nuclear weapons only if necessary to protect an evacuation of UN troops, or to prevent a &quot;major military disaster&quot;.

On 6 December after the Chinese intervention repelled the UN armies from northern North Korea, General J. Lawton Collins (Army Chief of Staff), General MacArthur, Admiral C. Turner Joy, General George E. Stratemeyer and staff officers Major General Doyle Hickey, Major General Charles A. Willoughby and Major General Edwin K. Wright met in Tokyo to plan strategy countering the Chinese intervention; they considered three potential atomic warfare scenarios encompassing the next weeks and months of warfare.
* In the first scenario: If the PVA continued attacking in full and the UN Command was forbidden to blockade and bomb China, and without Taiwanese reinforcements, and without an increase in U.S. forces until April 1951 (four National Guard divisions were due to arrive), then atomic bombs might be used in North Korea.
* In the second scenario: If the PVA continued full attacks and the UN Command blockaded China and had effective aerial reconnaissance and bombing of the Chinese interior, and the Taiwanese soldiers were maximally exploited, and tactical atomic bombing was to hand, then the UN forces could hold positions deep in North Korea.
* In the third scenario: if China agreed not to cross the 38th parallel border, MacArthur would recommend UN acceptance of an armistice disallowing PVA and KPA troops south of the parallel, and requiring PVA and KPA guerrillas to withdraw northwards. The Eighth Army would remain to protect the Seoul–Incheon area, while X Corps would retreat to Pusan. A UN commission should supervise implementation of the armistice.

Both the Pentagon and the State Department were cautious about using nuclear weapons because of the risk of general war with China and the diplomatic ramifications. Truman and his senior advisors agreed and never seriously considered using them in early December 1950 despite the poor military situation in Korea.

In 1951, the U.S. escalated closest to atomic warfare in Korea. Because China deployed new armies to the Sino-Korean frontier, ground crews at the Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, assembled atomic bombs for Korean warfare, &quot;lacking only the essential pit nuclear cores.&quot; In October 1951, the United States effected Operation Hudson Harbor to establish a nuclear weapons capability. USAF B-29 bombers practiced individual bombing runs from Okinawa to North Korea (using dummy nuclear or conventional bombs), coordinated from Yokota Air Base in east-central Japan. Hudson Harbor tested &quot;actual functioning of all activities which would be involved in an atomic strike, including weapons assembly and testing, leading, [and] ground control of bomb aiming&quot;. The bombing run data indicated that atomic bombs would be tactically ineffective against massed infantry, because the &quot;timely identification of large masses of enemy troops was extremely rare&quot;.

Ridgway was authorized to use nuclear weapons if a major air attack originated from outside Korea. An envoy was sent to Hong Kong to deliver a warning to China. The message likely caused Chinese leaders to be more cautious about potential U.S. use of nuclear weapons, but whether they learned about the B-29 deployment is unclear, and the failure of the two major Chinese offensives that month likely was what caused them to shift to a defensive strategy in Korea. The B-29s returned to the United States in June.

Despite the greater destructive power that atomic weapons would bring to the war, their effects on determining the war&#x27;s outcome would have likely been minimal. Tactically, given the dispersed nature of PVA/KPA forces, the relatively primitive infrastructure for staging and logistics centers, and the small number of bombs available (most would have been conserved for use against the Soviets), atomic attacks would have limited effects against the ability of China to mobilize and move forces. Strategically, attacking Chinese cities to destroy civilian industry and infrastructure would cause the immediate dispersion of the leadership away from such areas and give propaganda value for the communists to galvanize the support of Chinese civilians. Since the Soviets were not expected to intervene with their few primitive atomic weapons on China or North Korea&#x27;s behalf, the threat of a possible nuclear exchange was unimportant in the decision not to deploy atomic bombs; their use offered little operational advantage and would undesirably lower the &quot;threshold&quot; for using atomic weapons against non-nuclear states in future conflicts.

When Eisenhower succeeded Truman in early 1953, he was similarly cautious about using nuclear weapons in Korea. The administration prepared contingency plans to use them against China, but like Truman, he feared that doing so would result in Soviet attacks on Japan. The war ended as it began, without U.S. nuclear weapons deployed near battle.

==Aftermath==
=== North Korea ===
As a result of the war, &quot;North Korea had been virtually destroyed as an industrial society&quot;. After the armistice, Kim Il Sung requested Soviet economic and industrial assistance. In September 1953, the Soviet government agreed to &quot;cancel or postpone repayment for all ... outstanding debts&quot;, and promised to grant North Korea one billion rubles in monetary aid, industrial equipment and consumer goods. Eastern European members of the Soviet Bloc also contributed with &quot;logistical support, technical aid, [and] medical supplies&quot;. China canceled North Korea&#x27;s war debts, provided 800 million yuan, promised trade cooperation and sent in thousands of troops to rebuild damaged infrastructure. Contemporary North Korea remains underdeveloped and continues to be a totalitarian dictatorship since the end of the war, with an elaborate cult of personality around the Kim dynasty.

Present-day North Korea follows &quot;Songun&quot;, or &quot;military-first&quot; policy and has the highest number of military and paramilitary personnel in the world, with 7,769,000 active, reserve and paramilitary personnel, or approximately of its population. Its active-duty army of 1.28 million is the fourth largest in the world, after China, the United States and India; consisting of of its population. North Korea possesses nuclear weapons. A 2014 UN inquiry into abuses of human rights in North Korea concluded that, &quot;the gravity, scale and nature of these violations reveal a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world,&quot; with Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch holding similar views.

=== South Korea ===
Postwar recovery was different in the two Koreas. South Korea, which started from a far lower industrial base than North Korea (the latter contained 80% of Korea&#x27;s heavy industry in 1945), stagnated in the first postwar decade. In 1953, South Korea and the United States signed a Mutual Defense Treaty.

South Korean anti-Americanism after the war was fueled by the presence and behavior of United States Forces Korea military personnel and U.S. support for Park&#x27;s authoritarian regime, a fact still evident during the country&#x27;s democratic transition in the 1980s. However, anti-Americanism has declined significantly in South Korea in recent years, from 46% favorable in 2003 to 74% favorable in 2011, making South Korea one of the most pro-U.S. countries.

A large number of mixed-race &quot;GI babies&quot; (offspring of U.S. and other UN soldiers and Korean women) were filling up the country&#x27;s orphanages. Because Korean traditional society places significant weight on paternal family ties, bloodlines, and purity of race, children of mixed race or those without fathers are not easily accepted in South Korean society. International adoption of Korean children began in 1954. The U.S. Immigration Act of 1952 legalized the naturalization of non-Blacks and non-Whites as U.S. citizens and made possible the entry of military spouses and children from South Korea. With the passage of the Immigration Act of 1965, which substantially changed U.S. immigration policy toward non-Europeans, Koreans became one of the fastest-growing Asian groups in the United States.

=== Communism ===
Mao Zedong&#x27;s decision to take on the United States was a direct attempt to confront what the communist bloc viewed as the strongest anti-communist power in the world, undertaken at a time when the Chinese communist regime was still consolidating its own power. Mao supported intervention not to save North Korea, but because he believed that a military conflict with the U.S. was inevitable after the U.S. entered the war, and to appease the Soviet Union to secure military dispensation and achieve Mao&#x27;s goal of making China a major world military power. Mao was equally ambitious in improving his own prestige inside the communist international community. In his later years, Mao believed that Stalin only gained a positive opinion of him after China&#x27;s entrance into the Korean War. Inside mainland China, the war improved the long-term prestige of Mao, Zhou, and Peng, allowing the Chinese Communist Party to increase its legitimacy while weakening anti-communist dissent.

The Chinese government has encouraged the viewpoint that the war was initiated by the United States and South Korea, though ComIntern documents have shown that Mao sought approval from Stalin to enter the war. In Chinese media, the Chinese war effort is considered as an example of China&#x27;s engaging the strongest power in the world with an underequipped army, forcing it to retreat, and fighting it to a military stalemate. These successes were contrasted with China&#x27;s historical humiliations by Japan and by Western powers over the previous hundred years, highlighting the abilities of the PLA and the Chinese Communist Party. The most significant negative long-term consequence of the war for China was that it led the United States to guarantee the safety of Chiang Kaishek&#x27;s regime in Taiwan, effectively ensuring that Taiwan would remain outside of PRC control through the present day. Anti-U.S. sentiments, which were already a significant factor during the Chinese Civil War, were ingrained into Chinese culture during the communist propaganda campaigns of the Korean War.

The Korean War affected other participant combatants. Turkey, for example, entered NATO in 1952, and the foundation was laid for bilateral diplomatic and trade relations with South Korea. The war also played a role in the refugee crisis in Turkey in 1950–1951.

<doc id="16774" wikidata="Q76437" url="?curid=16774" title="Karl Dönitz">
<text>Karl Dönitz (; 16 September 1891 – 24 December 1980) was a German navy officer who, following Adolf Hitler&#x27;s suicide, succeeded him as head of state of Nazi Germany in May 1945, holding the position until the dissolution of the Flensburg Government following Germany&#x27;s unconditional surrender to the Allies days later. As Supreme Commander of the Navy beginning in 1943, he played a major role in the naval history of World War II.

He began his career in the Imperial German Navy before World War I. In 1918, he was commanding , and was taken prisoner of war by British forces. As commander of &quot;UB-68&quot;, he attacked a convoy in the Mediterranean while on patrol near Malta. Sinking one ship before the rest of the convoy outran his U-boat, Dönitz began to formulate the concept of U-boats operating in attack groups &quot;Rudeltaktik&quot; (German for &quot;pack tactic&quot;, commonly called a &quot;wolfpack&quot;) for greater efficiency, rather than operating independently.

By the start of the Second World War, Dönitz was supreme commander of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; U-boat arm ( (BdU)). In January 1943, Dönitz achieved the rank of (grand admiral) and replaced Grand Admiral Erich Raeder as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. Dönitz was the main enemy of Allied naval forces in the Battle of the Atlantic. From 1939 to 1943 the U-boats fought effectively but lost the initiative from May 1943. Dönitz ordered his submarines into battle until 1945 to relieve the pressure on other branches of the (armed forces). 648 U-boats were lost—429 with no survivors. Furthermore, of these, 215 were lost on their first patrol. Around 30,000 of the 40,000 men who served in U-boats perished.

On 30 April 1945, following the suicide of Adolf Hitler and in accordance with his last will and testament, Dönitz was named Hitler&#x27;s successor as head of state in what became known as the Goebbels cabinet after his second-in-command, Joseph Goebbels, until Goebbels&#x27; suicide led to Dönitz&#x27;s cabinet being reformed into the Flensburg Government instead. On 7 May 1945, he ordered Alfred Jodl, Chief of Operations Staff of the (OKW), to sign the German instruments of surrender in Reims, France, formally ending the War in Europe. Dönitz remained as head of state with the titles of President of Germany and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces until his cabinet was dissolved by the Allied powers on 23 May &quot;de facto&quot; and on 5 June &quot;de jure&quot;.

By his own admission, Dönitz was a dedicated Nazi and supporter of Hitler. Following the war, he was indicted as a major war criminal at the Nuremberg trials on three counts: conspiracy to commit crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity; planning, initiating, and waging wars of aggression; and crimes against the laws of war. He was found not guilty of committing crimes against humanity, but guilty of committing crimes against peace and war crimes against the laws of war. He was sentenced to ten years&#x27; imprisonment; following his release, he lived in a village near Hamburg until his death in 1980.

==Early career and personal life==
Dönitz was born on 16 September 1891 in Grünau, near Berlin, to Anna Beyer and Emil Dönitz, an engineer. Karl had an older brother. In 1910, Dönitz enlisted in the (&quot;Imperial Navy&quot;).

On 27 September 1913, Dönitz was commissioned as a (acting sub-lieutenant). When World War I began, he served on the light cruiser in the Mediterranean Sea. In August 1914, the &quot;Breslau&quot; and the battlecruiser were sold to the Ottoman Navy; the ships were renamed the &quot;Midilli&quot; and the &quot;Yavuz Sultan Selim&quot;, respectively. They began operating out of Constantinople, under Rear Admiral Wilhelm Souchon, engaging Russian forces in the Black Sea. On 22 March 1916, Dönitz was promoted to . He requested a transfer to the submarine forces, which became effective on 1 October 1916. He attended the submariner&#x27;s school at Flensburg-Mürwik and passed out on 3 January 1917. He served as watch officer on , and from February 1918 onward as commander of . On 2 July 1918, he became commander of , operating in the Mediterranean. On 4 October, after suffering technical difficulties, Dönitz was forced to surface and scuttled his boat. He was captured by the British and incarcerated in the Redmires camp near Sheffield. He remained a prisoner of war until 1919 and in 1920 he returned to Germany.

On 27 May 1916, Dönitz married a nurse named Ingeborg Weber (1893–1962), the daughter of German general Erich Weber (1860–1933). They had three children whom they raised as Protestant Christians: daughter Ursula (1917–1990) and sons Klaus (1920–1944) and Peter (1922–1943). 

Both of Dönitz&#x27;s sons were killed in action during the Second World War. Peter was killed on 19 May 1943 when was sunk in the North Atlantic with all hands. Hitler had issued a policy stating that if a senior officer such as Dönitz lost a son in battle and had other sons in the military, the latter could withdraw from combat and return to civilian life. After Peter&#x27;s death, Klaus was forbidden to have any combat role and was allowed to leave the military to begin studying to become a naval doctor. However, on 13 May 1944, his 24th birthday, he persuaded his friends to let him go on the E-boat &quot;S-141&quot; for a raid on Selsey. The boat was sunk by the and Claus was killed.

==Interwar period==
He continued his naval career in the naval arm of the Weimar Republic&#x27;s armed forces. On 10 January 1921, he became a (lieutenant) in the new German navy (). Dönitz commanded torpedo boats, becoming a (lieutenant-commander) on 1 November 1928. On 1 September 1933, he became a (commander) and, in 1934, was put in command of the cruiser &quot;Emden&quot;, the ship on which cadets and midshipmen took a year-long world cruise as training.

In 1935, the was renamed . Germany was prohibited by the Treaty of Versailles from possessing a submarine fleet. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935 allowed submarines and he was placed in command of the U-boat flotilla , which comprised three boats; ; and; . On 1 September 1935, he was promoted to (naval captain).

Dönitz opposed Raeder&#x27;s views that surface ships should be given priority in the during the war, but in 1935 Dönitz doubted U-boat suitability in a naval trade war on account of their slow speed. This phenomenal contrast with Dönitz&#x27;s wartime policy is explained in the 1935 Anglo-German Naval Agreement. The accord was viewed by the navy with optimism, Dönitz included. He remarked, &quot;Britain, in the circumstances, could not possibly be included in the number of potential enemies.&quot; The statement, made after June 1935, was uttered at a time when the naval staff were sure France and the Soviet Union were likely to be Germany&#x27;s only enemies. Dönitz&#x27;s statement was partially correct. Britain was not foreseen as an immediate enemy, but the navy still held onto a cadre of imperial officers, which along with its Nazi-instigated intake, understood war would be certain in the distant future, perhaps not until the mid-1940s.

Dönitz came to recognise the need for more of these vessels. Only 26 were in commission or under construction that summer. In the time before his command of submarines, he perfected the group tactics that first appealed to him in 1917. At this time Dönitz first expressed his procurement policies. His preference for the submarine fleet was in the production of large numbers of small craft. In contrast to other warships, the fighting power of the U-boat, in his opinion, was not dependent on its size as the torpedo, not the gun, was the machine&#x27;s main weapon. Dönitz had a tendency to be critical of larger submarines and listed a number of disadvantages in their production, operation and tactical use. Dönitz recommended the Type VII submarine as the ideal submarine. The boat was reliable and had a range of . Modifications lengthened this to .

Dönitz revived Hermann Bauer&#x27;s idea of grouping several submarines together into a (&quot;pack tactic&quot;, commonly called &quot;wolfpack&quot;) to overwhelm a merchant convoy&#x27;s escorts. Implementation of wolfpacks had been difficult in World War I owing to the limitations of available radios. In the interwar years, Germany had developed ultra high frequency transmitters, (ukw) while the Enigma cipher machine was believed to have made communications secure. A 1922 paper written by Wessner of the (Defence Ministry) pointed to the success of surface attacks at night and the need to coordinate operations with multiple boats to defeat the escorts. Dönitz knew of the paper and improved the ideas suggested by Wessner. This tactic had the added advantage that a submarine on the surface was undetectable by ASDIC (an early form of sonar). Dönitz claimed after the war he would not allow his service to be intimidated by British disclosures about ASDIC and the course of the war had proven him right. In reality, Dönitz harboured fears stretching back to 1937 that the new technology would render the U-boat impotent. Dönitz published his ideas on night attacks in January 1939 in a booklet called which apparently went unnoticed by the British. The Royal Navy&#x27;s overconfidence in Asdic encouraged the Admiralty to suppose it could deal with submarines whatever strategy they adopted — in this they were proven wrong; submarines were difficult to locate and destroy under operational conditions.

In 1939 he expressed his belief that he could win the war with 300 vessels. The Nazi leadership&#x27;s rearmament program prioritized land and aerial warfare. From 1933 to 1936, the navy was granted only 13 per cent of total armament expenditure. The production of U-boats, despite the existing Z Plan, remained low. In 1935 shipyards produced 14 submarines, 21 in 1936, 1 in 1937. In 1938 nine were commissioned and in 1939 18 U-boats were built. Dönitz&#x27;s vision may have been misguided. The British had planned for contingency construction programmes for the summer, 1939. At least 78 small escorts and a crash construction programme of &quot;Whale catchers&quot; had been invoked. The British, according to one historian, had taken all the sensible steps necessary to deal with the U-boat menace as it existed in 1939 and were well placed to deal with large numbers of submarines, prior to events in 1940.

==World War II==
On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. Britain and France soon declared war on Germany, and World War II began. On Sunday 3 September, Dönitz chaired a conference at Wilhelmshaven. At 11:15 am the British Admiralty sent out a signal &quot;Total Germany&quot;. B-Dienst intercepted the message and it was promptly reported to Dönitz. Dönitz paced around the room and his staff purportedly heard him repeatedly say, &quot;My God! So it&#x27;s war with England again!&quot;

Dönitz abandoned the conference to return within the hour a far more composed man. He announced to his officers, &quot;we know our enemy. We have today the weapon and a leadership that can face up to this enemy. The war will last a long time; but if each does his duty we will win.&quot; Dönitz had only 57 boats; of those, 27 were capable of reaching the Atlantic Ocean from their German bases. A small building program was already under way but the number of U-boats did not rise noticeably until the autumn of 1941.

Dönitz&#x27;s first major action was the cover up of the sinking of the British passenger liner &quot;Athenia&quot; later the same day. Acutely sensitive to international opinion and relations with the United States, the death of more than a hundred civilians was damaging. Dönitz suppressed the truth that the ship was sunk by a German submarine. He accepted the commander&#x27;s explanation that he genuinely believed the ship was armed. Dönitz ordered the engagement to be struck from the submarine&#x27;s logbook. Dönitz did not admit the cover up until 1946.

Hitler&#x27;s original orders to wage war only in accordance with the Prize Regulations were not issued in any altruistic spirit but in the belief hostilities with the Western Allies would be brief. On 23 September 1939, Hitler, on the recommendation of Admiral Raeder, approved that all merchant ships making use of their wireless on being stopped by U-boats should be sunk or captured. This German order marked a considerable step towards unrestricted warfare. Four days later enforcement of Prize Regulations in the North Sea was withdrawn; and on 2 October complete freedom was given to attack darkened ships encountered off the British and French coasts. Two days later the Prize Regulations were cancelled in waters extending as far as 15° West, and on 17 October the German Naval Staff gave U-boats permission to attack without warning all ships identified as hostile. The zone where darkened ships could be attacked with complete freedom was extended to 20° West on 19 October. Practically the only restrictions now placed on U-boats concerned attacks on passenger liners and, on 17 November, they too were allowed to be attacked without warning if clearly identifiable as hostile.

Although the phrase was not used, by November 1939 the BdU was practicing unrestricted submarine warfare. Neutral shipping was warned by the Germans against entering the zone which, by American neutrality legislation, was forbidden to American shipping, and against steaming without lights, zigzagging or taking any defensive precautions. The complete practice of unrestricted warfare was not enforced for fear of antagonising neutral powers, particularly the Americans. Admirals Raeder and Dönitz and the German Naval Staff had always wished and intended to introduce unrestricted warfare as rapidly as Hitler could be persuaded to accept the possible consequences.

Dönitz and Raeder accepted the death of the Z Plan upon the outbreak of war. The U-boat programme would be the only portion of it to survive 1939. Both men lobbied Hitler to increase the planned production of submarines to at least 29 per month. The immediate obstacle to the proposals was Hermann Göring, head of the Four Year Plan, commander-in-chief of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and future successor to Hitler. Göring would not acquiesce and in March 1940 Raeder was forced to drop the figure from 29 to 25, but even that plan proved illusory. In the first half of 1940, two boats were delivered, increased to six in the final half of the year. In 1941 the deliveries increased to 13 to June, and then 20 to December. It was not until late 1941 the number of vessels began to increase quickly. From September 1939 through to March 1940, 15 U-boats were lost—nine to convoy escorts. The impressive tonnage sunk had little impact on the Allied war effort at that point.

===Commander of the submarine fleet===
On 1 October 1939, Dönitz became a (rear admiral) and &quot;Commander of the Submarines&quot; (, &quot;BdU&quot;). For the first part of the war, despite disagreements with Raeder where best to deploy his men, Dönitz was given considerable operational freedom for his junior rank.

From September–December 1939 U-boats sank 221 ships for 755,237 gross tons, at the cost of nine U-boats. Only 47 merchant ships were sunk in the North Atlantic, a tonnage of 249,195. Dönitz had difficulty in organising Wolfpack operations in 1939. A number of his submarines were lost en route to the Atlantic, through either the North Sea or the heavily defended English Channel. Torpedo failures plagued commanders during convoy attacks. Along with successes against single ships, Dönitz authorised the abandonment of pack attacks in the autumn. The Norwegian campaign amplified the defects. Dönitz wrote in May 1940, &quot;I doubt whether men have ever had to rely on such a useless weapon.&quot; He ordered the removal of magnetic pistols in favour of contact fuses and their faulty depth control systems. In no fewer than 40 attacks on Allied warships, not a single sinking was achieved. The statistics show that from the outbreak of war to approximately the spring, 1940, faulty German torpedoes saved 50–60 ships equating to .

Dönitz was encouraged in operations against warships by the sinking of the aircraft carrier &quot;Courageous&quot;. On 28 September 1939 he said, &quot;it is not true Britain possesses the means to eliminate the U-boat menace.&quot; The first specific operation—named &quot;Special Operation P&quot;—authorised by Dönitz was Günther Prien&#x27;s attack on Scapa Flow, which sank the battleship &quot;Royal Oak&quot;. The attack became a propaganda success though Prien purportedly was unenthusiastic about being used that way. Stephen Roskill wrote, &quot;It is now known that this operation was planned with great care by Admiral Dönitz, who was correctly informed of the weak state of the defences of the eastern entrances. Full credit must also be given to Lieutenant Prien for the nerve and determination with which he put Dönitz&#x27;s plan into execution.&quot;

In May 1940, 101 ships were sunk—but only nine in the Atlantic—followed by 140 in June; 53 of them in the Atlantic for a total of that month. The first six months in 1940 cost Dönitz 15 U-boats. Until mid-1940 there remained a chronic problem with the reliability of the G7e torpedo. As the battles of Norway and Western Europe raged, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; sank more ships than the U-boats. In May 1940, German aircraft sank 48 ships (), three times that of German submarines. The Allied evacuations from western Europe and Scandinavia in June 1940 attracted Allied warships in large numbers, leaving many of the Atlantic convoys travelling through the Western Approaches unprotected. From June 1940, the German submarines began to exact a heavy toll. In the same month, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; sank just 22 ships () in a reversal of the previous months.

Germany&#x27;s defeat of Norway gave the U-boats new bases much nearer to their main area of operations off the Western Approaches. The U-boats operated in groups or &#x27;wolf packs&#x27; which were coordinated by radio from land. With the fall of France, Germany acquired U-boat bases at Lorient, Brest, Saint-Nazaire, and La Pallice/La Rochelle and Bordeaux. This extended the range of Type VIIs. Regardless, the war with Britain continued. The admiral remained sceptical of Operation Sea Lion, a planned invasion and expected a long war. The destruction of seaborne trade became German strategy against Britain after the defeat of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; in the Battle of Britain. Hitler was content with The Blitz and cutting off Britain&#x27;s imports. Dönitz gained importance as the prospect of a quick victory faded. Dönitz concentrated groups of U-boats against the convoys and had them attack on the surface at night. In addition the Germans were helped by Italian submarines which in early 1941 actually surpassed the number of German U-boats. Having failed to persuade the Nazi leadership to prioritise U-boat construction, a task made more difficult by military victories in 1940 which convinced many people that Britain would give up the struggle, Dönitz welcomed the deployment of 26 Italian submarines to his force. Dönitz complimented Italian bravery and daring, but was critical of their training and submarine designs. Dönitz remarked they lacked the necessary toughness and discipline and consequently were &quot;of no great assistance to us in the Atlantic.&quot;

The establishment of German bases on the French Atlantic coast allowed for the prospect of aerial support. Small numbers of German aircraft, such as the long-range Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor, sank a large number of ships in the Atlantic in the last quarter of 1940. In the long term, Göring proved an insurmountable problem in effecting cooperation between the navy and the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. In early 1941, while Göring was on leave, Dönitz approached Hitler and secured from him a single bomber/maritime patrol unit for the navy. Göring succeeded in overturning this decision and both Dönitz and Raeder were forced to settle for a specialist maritime air command under &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; control. Poorly supplied, achieved modest success in 1941, but thereafter failed to have an impact as British counter-measures evolved. Cooperation between the and remained dysfunctional to the war&#x27;s end. Göring and his unassailable position at the (Air Ministry) prevented all but limited collaboration.

The U-boat fleet&#x27;s successes in 1940 and early 1941 were spearheaded by a small number of highly trained and experienced pre-war commanders. Otto Kretschmer, Joachim Schepke, and Günther Prien were the most famous, but others included Hans Jenisch, Victor Oehrn, Engelbert Endrass, Herbert Schultze and Hans-Rudolf Rösing. Although skilled and with impeccable judgement, the shipping lanes they descended upon were poorly defended. The U-boat force did not escape unscathed. Within the space of several days in March 1941, Prien and Schepke were dead and Kretschmer was a prisoner. All of them fell in battle with a convoy system. The number of boats in the Atlantic remained low. Six fewer existed in May 1940 than in September 1939. In January 1941 there were just six on station in the Atlantic—the lowest during the war, while still suffering from unreliable torpedoes. Dönitz insisted that operations continue while &quot;the smallest prospect of hits&quot; remained.

For his part, Dönitz was involved in the daily operations of his boats and all the major operational level decisions. His assistant, Eberhard Godt, was left to manage daily operations as the war continued. Dönitz was debriefed personally by his captains which helped establish a rapport between leader and led. Dönitz neglected nothing that would make the bond firmer. Often there would be a distribution of medals or awards. As an ex-submariner, Dönitz did not like to contemplate the thought of a man who had done well heading out to sea, perhaps never to return, without being rewarded or receiving recognition. Dönitz acknowledged where decorations were concerned there was no red tape and that awards were &quot;psychologically important&quot;.

===Intelligence battle===
Intelligence played an important role in the Battle of the Atlantic. In general, BdU intelligence was poor. Counter-intelligence was not much better. At the height of the battle in mid-1943 some 2,000 signals were sent from the 110 U-boats at sea. Radio traffic compromised his ciphers by giving the Allies more messages to work with. Furthermore, replies from the boats enabled the Allies to use High-frequency direction finding (HF/DF, called &quot;Huff-Duff&quot;) to locate a U-boat using its radio, track it and attack it. The over-centralised command structure of BdU and its insistence on micro-managing every aspect of U-boat operations with endless signals provided the Allied navies with ample intelligence. The enormous &quot;paper chase&quot; [cross-referencing of materials] operations pursued by Allied intelligence agencies was not thought possible by BdU. The Germans did not suspect the Allies had identified the codes broken by B-Dienst. Conversely, when Dönitz suspected the enemy had penetrated his own communications BdU&#x27;s response was to suspect internal sabotage and reduce the number of the staff officers to the most reliable, exacerbating the problem of over-centralisation. In contrast to the Allies, the was suspicious of civilian scientific advisors and generally distrusted outsiders. The Germans were never as open to new ideas or thinking of war in intelligence terms. According to one analyst BdU &quot;lacked imagination and intellectual daring&quot; in the naval war. These Allied advantages failed to avert heavy losses in the June 1940 May 1941 period, known to U-boat crews as the &quot;First Happy Time.&quot; In June 1941, 68 ships were sunk in the North Atlantic () at a cost of four U-boats, but the German submarines would not eclipse that number for the remainder of the year. Just 10 transports were sunk in November and December 1941.

On 7 May 1941, the Royal Navy captured the German Arctic meteorological vessel and took its Enigma machine intact, which allowed the Royal Navy to decode U-boat radio communications in June 1941. Two days later the capture of &quot;U-110&quot; was an intelligence coup for the British. The settings for high-level &quot;officer-only&quot; signals, &quot;short-signals&quot; () and codes standardising messages to defeat HF/DF fixes by sheer speed were found. Only the &quot;Hydra&quot; settings for May were missing. The papers were the only stores destroyed by the crew. The capture on 28 June of another weather ship, , enabled British decryption operations to read radio traffic in July 1941. Beginning in August 1941, Bletchley Park operatives could decrypt signals between Dönitz and his U-boats at sea without any restriction. The capture of the &quot;U-110&quot; allowed the Admiralty to identify individual boats, their commanders, operational readiness, damage reports, location, type, speed, endurance from working up in the Baltic to Atlantic patrols. On 1 February 1942, the Germans had introduced the M4 cipher machine, which secured communications until it was cracked in December 1942. Even so, the U-boats achieved their best success against the convoys in March 1943, due to an increase in U-boat numbers, and the protection of the shipping lanes was in jeopardy. Due to the cracked M4 and the use of radar, the Allies began to send air and surface reinforcements to convoys under threat. The shipping lanes were secured, which came as a great surprise to Dönitz. The lack of intelligence and increased numbers of U-boats contributed enormously to Allied losses that year.
Signals security aroused Dönitz&#x27;s suspicions during the war. On 12 January 1942 German supply submarine &quot;U-459&quot; arrived 800 nautical miles west of Freetown, well clear of convoy lanes. It was scheduled to rendezvous with an Italian submarine, until intercepted by a warship. The German captain&#x27;s report coincided with reports of a decrease in sightings and a period of tension between Dönitz and Raeder. The number of U-boats in the Atlantic, by logic, should have increased, not lowered the number of sightings and the reasons for this made Dönitz uneasy. Despite several investigations, the conclusion of the BdU staff was that &quot;Enigma&quot; was impenetrable. His signals officer responded to the &quot;U-459&quot; incident with answers ranging from coincidence, direction finding to Italian treachery. General Erich Fellgiebel, Chief Signal Officer of Army High Command and of Supreme Command of Armed Forces (), apparently concurred with Dönitz. He concluded that there was &quot;convincing evidence&quot; that, after an &quot;exhaustive investigation&quot; that the Allied codebreakers had been reading high level communications. Other departments in the navy downplayed or dismissed these concerns. They vaguely implied &quot;some components&quot; of Enigma had been compromised, but there was &quot;no real basis for acute anxiety as regards any compromise of operational security&quot;.

===American entry===
Following Hitler&#x27;s declaration of war on the United States on 11 December 1941, Dönitz implemented Operation Drumbeat (). The entry of the United States benefited German submarines in the short term. Dönitz intended to strike close to shore in American and Canadian waters and prevent the convoys—the most effective anti–U-boat system—from ever forming. Dönitz was determined to take advantage of Canadian and American unpreparedness before the situation changed.

The problem inhibiting Dönitz&#x27;s plan was a lack of boats. On paper he had 259, but in January 1942, 99 were still undergoing sea trials and 59 were assigned to training flotillas, leaving only 101 on war operations. 35 of these were under repair in port, leaving 66 operational, of which 18 were low on fuel and returning to base, 23 were en route to areas where fuel and torpedoes needed to be conserved, and one was heading to the Mediterranean. Therefore, on 1 January Dönitz had a fighting strength of 16–25 in the Atlantic (six of them close to Iceland on &quot;Norwegian operations&quot;), three in the Arctic Ocean, three in the Mediterranean and three operating west of Gibraltar. Dönitz was severely limited to what he could accomplish in American waters in an initial offensive.

From 13 January 1942, Dönitz planned to begin a surprise offensive from the Gulf of Saint Lawrence to Cape Hatteras. Unknown to him, Ultra had read his Enigma signals and knew the position, size, and intentions of his boats, down to the date the operation was scheduled to begin. The attacks, when they came, were not a surprise. Of the 12 U-boats that began the offensive from the Grand Banks southward, just two survived the war. The operation began the Battle of the St. Lawrence, a series of battles which lasted into 1944. It remained possible for a U-boat to operate in the Gulf into 1944, but countermeasures were strong. In 1942, the global ratio of ships-to-U-boats sunk in Canadian waters was 112:1. The global average was 10.3:1. The solitary kill was achieved by the RCAF. Canadian operations, as with American efforts, were a failure during this year.

Along with conventional U-boat operations Dönitz authorised clandestine activities in Canadian waters, including spying, mine-laying, and recovery of German prisoners of war (as Dönitz wished to extract information from rescued submariners concerning Allied tactics). All of these things tied down Canadian military power and imposed industrial, fiscal, and psychological costs. The impunity with which U-boats carried out these operations in Canadian waters into 1944 provided a propaganda effect. One of these operations was the well-known Operation Kiebitz to rescue Otto Kretschmer.

Even with operational problems great success was achieved in American waters. From January to July 1942, Dönitz&#x27;s submarines were able to attack unescorted ships off the United States&#x27; east coast and in the Caribbean Sea; U-boats sank more ships and tonnage than at any other time in the war. After a convoy system was introduced to protect the shipping, Dönitz shifted his U-boats back to the North Atlantic. The period, known in the U-boat Arm as the &quot;Second Happy Time&quot;, represented one of the greatest naval disasters of all time, and largest defeat suffered by American sea power. The success was achieved with only five U-boats initially which sank 397 ships in waters protected by the United States Navy with an additional 23 sunk at the Panama Sea Frontier. Dönitz put the successes down to the American failure to initialize a blackout along the East Coast of the United States and ship captains&#x27; insistence on following peace-time safety procedures. The failure to implement a blackout stemmed from the American government&#x27;s concern it would affect tourism trade. Dönitz wrote in his memoirs that the lighthouses and buoys &quot;shone forth, though perhaps a little less brightly than usually&quot;.

By the time improved American air and naval defences had driven German submarines from American shores, 5,000 Allied sailors had been killed for negligible losses in U-boats. Dönitz ordered simultaneous operations in the Caribbean Sea. The ensuing Battle of the Caribbean resulted in immediate dividends for U-boats. In a short time, at least 100 transports had been destroyed or sunk. The sinkings damaged inter-island trade substantially. Operation Neuland was among the most damaging naval campaigns in the region. Oil refinery production in region declined while the tanker fleet suffered losses of up to ten per cent within twenty-four hours. However, ultimately Dönitz could not hope to sink more ships than American industry could build, so he targeted the tanker fleet in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in the hope that depleting oil transports would paralyze shipyard output. 33 transports were sunk in July before Dönitz lost his first crew. The USN introduced effective convoy systems thereafter, ending the &quot;carnage&quot;.

Dönitz maintained his demands for the concentration of all his crews in the Atlantic. As the military situation in North Africa and on the Eastern Front began to deteriorate Hitler diverted a number of submarines to the Battle of the Mediterranean upon the suggestions of Admiral Eberhard Weichold. Raeder and Dönitz resisted the deployment to the Mediterranean to no avail. Hitler felt compelled to act against Allied sea forces which were having an enormous impact on Axis supply lines to North Africa. The decision defied logic, for a victory in the Atlantic would end the war in the Mediterranean. The U-boat war in the Mediterranean was a costly failure, despite successes against warships. Approximately 60 crews were lost and only one crew managed to withdraw through the Strait of Gibraltar. Albrecht Brandi was one of Dönitz&#x27;s highest performers but his record is a matter of controversy; post-war records prove systematic over-claiming of sinkings. He survived his boat&#x27;s sinking and was smuggled to Germany through Spain. Dönitz had met his end as a submarine commander in the Mediterranean two decades earlier.

In 1942 Dönitz summed up his philosophy in one simple paragraph; &quot;The enemy&#x27;s shipping constitutes one single, great entity. It is therefore immaterial where a ship is sunk. Once it has been destroyed it has to be replaced by a new ship; and that&#x27;s that.&quot; The remark was the green light to unrestricted submarine warfare and began the tonnage war proper. BdU intelligence concluded the Americans could produce 15,300,000 tons of shipping in 1942 and 1943—two million tons under actual production figures. Dönitz always calculated the worst-case scenario using the highest figures of enemy production potential. Some 700,000 tons per month needed to be sunk to win the war. The &quot;second happy time&quot; reached a peak in June 1942, with 325,000 tons sunk, up from 311,000 in May, 255,000 in April and the highest since the 327,000 tons sunk in March 1942. With support from the Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy, the new convoy systems compelled Dönitz to withdraw his captains to the mid-Atlantic once again. Nevertheless, there was still cause for optimism. B-Dienst had cracked the convoy ciphers and by July 1942 Dönitz could call upon 311 boats, 140 operational, to conduct a renewed assault. By October 1942 he had 196 operational from 365. Dönitz&#x27;s force finally reached the desired number both he and Raeder had hoped for in 1939. Unaware of it, Dönitz and his men were aided by the Ultra blackout. The addition of a fourth rotor to the Enigma left radio detection the only way to gather intelligence on dispositions and intentions of the German naval forces. German code breakers had their own success in the capture of the code book to Cipher Code Number 3 from a merchant ship. It was a treble success for the BdU.

Dönitz was content that he now had the naval power to extend U-boat operations to other areas aside the North Atlantic. The Caribbean, Brazilian waters with the coast of West Africa designated operational theatres. Waters in the southern hemisphere to South Africa could also be attacked with the new Type IX submarine. The strategy was sound and his tactical ideas were effective. The number of boats available allowed him to form Wolfpacks to comb convoy routes from east to west attacking one when found and pursuing it across the ocean. The pack then refuelled from a U-boat tanker and worked from west to east. Raeder and the operations staff disputed the value in attacking convoys heading westward with empty cargo holds. The tactics were successful but placed great strain on crews who spent up to eight days in constant action.

November 1942 was a new high in the Atlantic. 134 ships were sunk for 807,754 tons. 119 were destroyed by submarines, 83 (508,707 tons) in the Atlantic. The same month Dönitz suffered strategic defeat. His submarines failed to prevent Operation Torch, even with 196 of them operating in the Atlantic. Dönitz considered it a major self-inflicted defeat. Allied morale radically improved after the victories of Torch, the Second Battle of El Alamein and the Battle of Stalingrad; all occurred within days of one another. The U-boat war was the only military success the Germans enjoyed at the end of the year.

===Commander-in-chief and Grand Admiral===
On 30 January 1943, Dönitz replaced Erich Raeder as Commander-in-chief of the navy () and (grand admiral) of the Naval High Command (). In a communique to the navy he announced his intentions to retain practical control of the U-boats and his desire to fight to the end for Hitler. Dönitz&#x27;s inability to delegate control of the U-boat service has been construed as a weakness in the U-boat arm, contributing to the perception that Dönitz was an &quot;impatient warrior&quot;, preoccupied with fighting battles and tactics rather than a strategist or organiser.

Dönitz&#x27;s promotion earned Hitler his undying loyalty. For Dönitz, Hitler had given him a &quot;true home-coming at last, to a country in which unemployment appeared to have been abolished, the class war no longer tore the nation apart, and the shame of defeat in 1918 was being expunged.&quot; When war came, Dönitz became more firmly wedded to his Nazi faith. Hitler recognised his patriotism, professionalism but above all, his loyalty. Dönitz remained so, long after the war was lost. In so doing, he wilfully ignored the genocidal nature of the regime and claimed ignorance of the Holocaust.

In the last quarter of 1942, 69 submarines had been commissioned taking the total number to 393, with 212 operational. Dönitz was not satisfied and immediately began a naval construction programme which in contrast to Raeder&#x27;s, laid all its emphasis on torpedo boats and submarines. Dönitz&#x27;s proposed expansion ran into difficulties experienced by all of his predecessors; the lack of steel. The navy had no representation on Albert Speer&#x27;s armaments ministry, for naval production was the only sphere not under his control. Dönitz understood this worked against the navy because it lacked the elasticity to cope with breakdowns of production at any point, whereas the other services could make good production by compensating one sector at the expense of another. Without any representatives the battle of priorities was left to Speer and Göring. Dönitz had the sense to place U-boat production under Speer on the provision 40 per month were completed. Dönitz persuaded Hitler not to scrap the surface fleet capital ships, though they played no role in the Atlantic during his time in command. Dönitz reasoned the destruction of the surface fleet would provide the British with a victory and heap pressure on the U-boats, for these warships were tying down British air and naval forces that would otherwise be sent into the Atlantic.

New construction procedures, dispensing with prototypes and the abandonment of modifications reduced construction times from 460,000-man hours to 260–300,000 to meet Speer&#x27;s quota. In the spring 1944, the Type XXI submarine was scheduled to reach frontline units. In 1943 the Combined Bomber Offensive undid German plans. Dönitz and Speer were appalled by the destruction of Hamburg, a major construction site. The battles of 1943 and 1944 were fought with the existing Type VII and Type IX submarines. The Type VII remained the backbone of the fleet in 1943.

At the end of 1942, Dönitz was faced with the appearance of escort carriers, and long-range aircraft working with convoy escorts. To protect his boats against the latter, he ordered his boats to restrict their operations to the Mid-Atlantic Gap, a stretch of ocean out of the range of land-based aircraft. Allied air forces had few aircraft equipped with ASV radar for U-boat detection into April and May 1943, and such units would not exist in Newfoundland until June. Convoys relied on RAF Coastal Command aircraft operating from Northern Ireland and Iceland. The aircraft imposed restraints on U-boat captains, who feared them for their ability to sink a submarine or alert surface warships to their position. In 1942 Coastal Command began forming units combined with ASV and Leigh Light to attack U-boats at night in transit to the Atlantic via the Bay of Biscay, which continued into 1943. The Command was moderately successful after mid-1942.

1943 began with continued tactical success for Dönitz in battle. In January Convoy TM 1 was nearly destroyed. The loss of 100,000 tons of fuel in one convoy represented the most devastating loss percentage of the war—only two of nine tankers reached port. The Eighth Army were forced to ration their fuel for a time, earning Dönitz the gratitude of the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot;. The Casablanca Conference, held that month, identified the Atlantic as the priority. It was agreed that until the defeat of Dönitz and his men, there could be no amphibious landings in continental Europe. Unknown to Dönitz, Bletchley Park had broken the Shark cypher and restored the flow of Enigma information; the Admiralty was able to route convoys around wolfpacks. During January and February 1943 information was decrypted within 24 hours proving operationally useful, although this slipped at the end of the second month contributing to German interceptions. Even so, in appalling weather, the Germans sank only 44 ships during the month, even with 100 U-boats at sea, the majority stationed in the mid-Atlantic gap.

In February 1943 the strength of Allied defences were ominous for Dönitz. The battle of convoy HX 224 was ended upon the intervention of air power from Iceland. Dönitz sent 20 boats to attack SC 118 and both sides suffered heavy losses—11 merchant ships for three U-boats plus four damaged. It was &quot;what both sides considered one of the hardest fought battles of the Atlantic war&quot;. Despite sending 20 crews into action, Dönitz was concerned that most captains did not press home attacks. The majority of the ships sunk were by one crew, commanded by Siegfried von Forstner—he sank seven.

In March, Convoy SC 121 was attacked by 31 U-boats in two patrol lines. It was the most successful battle of the war for Dönitz. The battle of Convoys HX 229/SC 122 was the largest convoy battle, with 40 U-boats involved. Each operation was successful but all were fought in the mid-Atlantic. Allied losses reached a peak in March 1943. The Admiralty later issued a report on the matter; &quot;The Germans never came so near [to] disrupting communications between the new world and the old as in the first twenty days of March 1943.&quot; Dönitz later conceded the March battles were to be the U-boats&#x27; last victories. New Allied techniques, tactics and technology began to turn the tide. By April 1943 U-boat morale was reaching a crisis point. Ninety-eight new boats were sent into the Atlantic that month and although the training was thorough the crews were inexperienced and it showed. Fifteen U-boats were destroyed in March 1943 and another 15 in April. Werner Hartenstein and Johann Mohr were notable casualties over the course of these eight weeks; the former&#x27;s decision to rescue survivors of a sunken ship led to Dönitz&#x27;s Laconia Order, which later formed part of the criminal case against Dönitz.

Ominous for BdU was the sudden growth of Allied air power. The Allied command accepted that air cover over the mid-Atlantic was inadequate and had drawn attention to the fact that not one VLR (Very Long Range) aircraft was to be found at any Allied air base west of Iceland. The Americans released 255 Liberators for the North Atlantic. At the end of March 1943 20 VLR aircraft were operational rising to 41 by mid-April, all of them flown by British crews. Twenty-eight anti-submarine and 11 anti-shipping squadrons were available to RAF Coastal Command, 619 aircraft in all—a striking change since September 1939. The influx of radar equipped aircraft into mid-Atlantic was matched by air patrols over the Bay of Biscay. Dönitz detected a drop in morale among his captains, as did the British. Dönitz encouraged his commanders to show a &quot;hunter&#x27;s instinct&quot; and &quot;warrior spirit&quot; in the face of the air–surface support group threat.

Along with air power, the BdU was forced to contend with a large increase in Allied convoy escorts which fuelled from tankers in the convoys allowing escort across the ocean. The escort carrier support groups, protected by destroyers, which, in the words of the official naval historian of the Second World War, proved decisive; &quot;it was the advent of the Support Groups, the Escort Carriers and the Very Long Range Aircraft which turned the tables on the U-boats-and did so with astonishing rapidity&quot;.

A hundred and eight ships were sunk in the first 20 days of March, and just 15 in the last 10. The official naval historian wrote, &quot;The collapse of the enemy&#x27;s offensive, when it came, was so sudden that it took him completely by surprise. We now know that, in fact, a downward trend in the U-boats&#x27; recent accomplishments could have forewarned him, but was concealed from him by the exaggerated claims made by their commanders.&quot; In April Dönitz lost five crews to the Coastal Command ASV Biscay offensive. Encouraged by the isolated successes of anti-aircraft artillery installed on submarines, he ordered crews to stay on the surface and fight it out with the aircraft. The decision caused casualties—four boats were lost in the first week of May alone, and three more by the end.

For the month of April Allied losses fell to 56 ships of 327,943 tons. In May 1943 the battle reached a climax with the battles of Convoy ONS 5, Convoy SC 129, Convoy SC 130. Throughout the battles only two ships were sunk in convoy in the Atlantic while an air anti-submarine escort was present. Dönitz depended on the surface manoeuvrability of his U-boats to locate targets, assemble wolfpacks and the complicated business of positioning his forces ahead of a convoy for an attack. Allied air power determined where and when U-boats could move freely on the surface. It was the combination of convoy escorts and air power that made the Atlantic unsuitable for pack operations. The US Navy introduced the K-class blimp. They forced a commander to dive to prevent the aircraft marking his position or attacking. From 10 to 24 May 1943, ten convoys passed through the mid-Atlantic. Six of the 370 ships were sunk; three were stragglers. Thirteen U-boats were sunk; four by warships, seven by aircraft, and two shared.

By 24 May, when Dönitz conceded defeat and withdrew the surviving crews from the field of battle, they had already lost 33 U-boats. At the end of May it had risen to 41. Dönitz tried to limit the damage to morale by declaring that the withdrawal was only temporary &quot;to avoid unnecessary losses in a period when our weapons are shown to be at a disadvantage&quot; and that &quot;the battle in the north Atlantic—the decisive area—will be resumed&quot;. Dönitz did make a further attempt to regain the initiative, but the battle never reached the same pitch of intensity or hung in the balance, as during the spring of 1943. The Allied success won the Battle of the Atlantic. On 24 May Dönitz ordered the suspension of Atlantic operations, bringing an end to Black May.

Defeat in the mid-Atlantic left Dönitz in a dilemma. The U-boats had proven unable to elude convoy escorts and attack convoys with success. He was concerned about crew morale suffering from idleness and a loss of experience with the latest Allied developments in anti-submarine warfare. Aside from problems of seaworthiness among machines and crew, there were not enough Submarine pens to store idle boats and they were a target for aircraft in port. Dönitz would not withdraw his submarines from combat operations, for he felt the ships, men and aircraft engaged in suppressing the U-boats could then be turned on Germany directly; the U-boat war was to continue.

===Hunter-killer era===
From mid-June 1943 the technological and industrial superiority of the Allied navies allowed the Americans, Canadians, and British to form hunter-killer groups consisting of fast anti-submarine escorts and aircraft carriers. The purpose of naval operations changed from avoiding U-boats and safeguarding convoys to seeking them out and destroying them wherever they operated. USN hunter-killer groups operated throughout the Atlantic. Argentia had been an important base for the naval taskforces until superseded by the Royal Canadian Navy in early 1943. U-boat operations were &quot;crushed&quot; by these task forces: 14 were sunk and only two of seven crews operating in Brazilian waters returned to Germany.

Dönitz reacted by deploying his U-boats near the Azores where land-based aircraft still had difficulty reaching them. In this region he hoped to threaten the Gibraltar–Britain convoy route. Dönitz intended to concentrate his power in a rough arc from West Africa to South America and the Caribbean. He hoped to maintain a presence in the western and central Atlantic, reduce losses and await new weapons and anti-detection devices. In this, he failed to &quot;stem the tide of U-boat losses.&quot; A large portion of the 39 U-boats deployed on these operations were intercepted. From May 1943, one historian wrote &quot;U-boats rash enough to close with an Atlantic convoy...were simply inviting destruction.&quot;

Dönitz&#x27;s crews faced danger from the outset. The transit routes through the Bay of Biscay were heavily patrolled by aircraft. From May to December 1943, 25 U-boats were sunk by Coastal Command, more were sunk by the USAAF and Royal Navy—five and four respectively; with one shared by the navy and Coastal Command. To counter radar aircraft, Dönitz ordered his submarines to group together and merge their powerful anti-aircraft armament together while surfaced and recharging their batteries, after initially ordering the groups to remain surfaced throughout the journey and fight off aerial attackers with gunfire. The decision was to cost BdU heavy casualties. A group of U-boats were more likely to attract a radar contact, and Allied pilots soon learned to swarm their targets. Dönitz ordered his captains to traverse the Bay under the lee of the neutral Spanish coast, with a sharply rising coast which shielded U-boats from radar. After 4 August 1943, the number of destroyed U-boats fell from one every four days, to one every 27 until June 1944.

US hunter–killer groups extended their patrols to the central Atlantic in the summer. They sank 15 U-boats from June through to August 1943. A number of supply submarines were destroyed crippling the Germans&#x27; ability to conduct long range operations. At the end of the summer, practically all supply U-boats had been destroyed. In September 1943, Dönitz ordered his submarines back to the North Atlantic. U-boats were equipped with the G7es torpedo, an acoustic torpedo, which the grand admiral hoped would wrest the technological initiative back. The torpedo was the centrepiece to Dönitz&#x27;s plan. Great faith was also placed in the installation of radar to detect aircraft. It was intended as a successor to the Metox radar detector. A number of his boats were later retrofitted with the submarine snorkel, permitting the submarine to stay submerged. Dönitz placed much faith in the Type XXI submarine. He accepted that the older submarines were obsolete now that Allied defences in the air were complete. He required a &quot;true submarine&quot;, equipped with a snorkel to allow his crews to stay submerged, at least to snorkel-depth, and evade radar-equipped aircraft. Dönitz was pleased with the promised top speed of 18 knots.

That month, 21 boats fought a battle with two formations; Convoys ONS 18/ON 202. The battle was a failure. In October an attack on Convoy SC 143 failed, even with limited air support from the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. The battle with Convoys ONS 20/ON 206 in the same month was a comprehensive defeat. A fourth major battle, Convoy SL 138/MKS 28, developed in the last days of October and ended in another failure for Dönitz. The November battle around Convoy SL 139/MKS 30 ended in the repulse of 29 U-boats with the loss of only a single ship. Intelligence proved its worth. During the battles of convoys ONS 18/ON 202, Dönitz&#x27;s admonitions to his commanders allowed the Allied intelligence services to uncover German tactical intentions. Dönitz had tried and failed to push his forces through lethal convoy defences. The hunter-killer groups were called in to hunt the remaining members of the wolfpacks, with predictable results. In mid-December 1943, Dönitz finally conceded not only the Atlantic, but the Gibraltar routes as well.

The hunter-killer and convoy escorts brought the wolfpack era to an end at the close of 1943. Dönitz resorted to sending out single submarines to the far reaches of the oceans in a bid to escape Allied naval power. In November 1943 he sent the last U-boat into the Gulf of Mexico just after the blackout restrictions were lifted. &quot;U-193&quot; achieved one final success. The end of 1943 ended the attempt of the U-boat arm to achieve a strategic victory in the Atlantic. That left only the Arctic convoys to the Soviet Union. On Christmas Eve, this became the sole preserve of the U-boats after the dispatch of &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; at the Battle of the North Cape.

Dönitz&#x27;s plan for 1944 was simply to survive and await the XXI and Type XXIII submarines. New radars were on the horizon and a direction finding antenna for &quot;Naxos&quot; was scheduled for use. Dönitz established a naval operations scientific staff to focus on more powerful centimetric radars. Production of submarines was streamlined. Parts for eight major sections were fabricated across 60 plants in Europe and assembled at Hamburg, Danzig and Bremen to ease the pressure of bombing and congestion at shipyards. The first of the new generation boats were expected by April 1944. Dönitz hoped for 33 per month by September. In early 1944, Dönitz opted to concentrate west of Ireland, at 15 and 17° west, in the hope convoys would come to them. Single boats were still sent to the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean. With 66 vessels at sea at any one time, and with 200 boats operational, the BdU was still a viable threat and he believed the force could achieve modest success. The U-boats were painfully slow, strategically, operationally and tactically. Crossing the Atlantic took up to a month compared to a week in 1942. Positioning west of Ireland could take several weeks submerged. In the first quarter of 1944, U-boats sank only three of the 3,360 ships that passed south of Ireland. In return 29 crews were lost.

A major concern to Dönitz was Operation Overlord, the long predicted landing in France, and what role the U-boat arm and surface forces could play in the defence. He was sensitive to a landing on the Bay of Biscay but retained boats there only for operational readiness. Dönitz ended reconnaissance operations in the region. In the BdU war diary he wrote of ending operations since &quot;otherwise the strong enemy air activity will lead to high losses which would only be acceptable if an immediate landing on the Biscay coast were expected. As this is no longer considered an acute danger the boats will remain at readiness in the concrete shelters.&quot;

When the D-day landings took place on 6 June 1944, the U-boats were ordered into action with the awareness that the western flank of the invasion would be well protected at sea. Operational experience with the snorkel was too scant to devise instructions for its use. The narrow, shallow, waters of the English Channel provided few opportunities for charging the batteries. Dönitz feared the task was impossible. The group based at Brest, sent 15 submarines into action against the Cherbourg peninsula landings part of a 36-strong flotilla. Only eight had snorkels. The seven non-snorkel boats were ordered to attack on the surface. The BdU war diary entry on 6 June 1944 states that &quot;for those boats without schnorchel this means the last operation&quot;. Of the 15, only five got near to the invasion fleet. Five of the snorkel boats survived. In exchange for 10 U-boats with the survivors damaged, two frigates, four freighters, and one tank landing ship were sunk. 22 U-boats were sunk from 6 to 30 June 1944. On 5 July 1944, the Allied Operation &quot;Dredger&quot; permitted hunter-killer groups to roam the Western Approaches and Biscay making it a &quot;no-go area&quot; for U-boats. U-boat operations against Normandy landings were a fiasco. Dönitz and the high command had been ignorant of the true scale of the naval D-day effort. Dönitz claimed his men sank five escorts, 12 merchant ships and four landing craft for 20 submarines and 1,000 men, of whom 238 were rescued. Dönitz&#x27;s claims underplayed German losses, which were, in fact, 41 submarines from 82 in France, a 50 per cent loss rate.

The collapse of the German front in Normandy left only the bases in German-occupied Norway nearest to the Atlantic. The newer boats were not forthcoming either. Ninety Type XXI and 31 Type XIII boats were built by the end of 1944. Sixty of the former and 23 of the latter were in service but none were operational. Dönitz was left with the old VIIs to carry the war into 1945. A large number had snorkels, which enabled them to surface only upon reaching port. Submerged, this meant no radio or Enigma communications and far fewer sightings for the Allied intelligence network to exploit. Dönitz ordered his submarines to British coastal waters with some success in November and December 1944, achieving 85,639 tons. Admiral Andrew Cunningham remarked of the strategy, &quot;We are having a difficult time with the U-boats...the air are about 90 percent out of business and Asdic is failing us.&quot; The inshore waters impeded the use of Asdic, which became confused with wrecks, rocks, and tidal swirls. The new types could conceivably have capitalised on these developments but the war was nearly over. On 1 January 1945, Dönitz had 425 submarines; 144 operational. On 1 April 1945, it was 166 from 429. He threw into battle every available weapon as the German Reich collapsed. Dönitz supported the use of Human torpedoes; the Neger, Marder, Seehund and Biber were all used in suicide missions on his orders, perhaps inspired by the Japanese Kamikaze.

On 30 April 1945 Adolf Hitler committed suicide. Dönitz succeeded him as head of state. Admiral Hans-Georg von Friedeburg succeeded Dönitz as commander-in-chief of the . On 4 May 1945 the German surrender at Lüneburg Heath took place. Dönitz issued an order to all U-boats to cease combat operations and return to port or surrender to Allied naval vessels. The order was obeyed with a handful of notable exceptions—the Actions of 5–6 May 1945, and Actions of 7–8 May 1945 occurred after the surrender. The surrendered U-boats numbered into the hundreds and were destroyed in the postwar Operation Deadlight. The U-boat war finally came to an end on 9 May 1945, the date of the German Instrument of Surrender.

===President of Germany===
Dönitz admired Hitler and was vocal about the qualities he perceived in Hitler&#x27;s leadership. In August 1943, he praised his foresightedness and confidence; &quot;anyone who thinks he can do better than the &quot;Führer&quot; is stupid.&quot; Dönitz&#x27;s relationship with Hitler strengthened through to the end of the war, particularly after the 20 July plot, for the naval staff officers were not involved; when news of it came there was indignation in the OKM. Even after the war, Dönitz said he could never have joined the conspirators. Dönitz tried to imbue Nazi ideas among his officers, though the indoctrination of the naval officer corps was not the brainchild of Dönitz, but rather a continuation of the Nazification of the navy begun under his predecessor Raeder. Naval officers were required to attend a five-day education course in Nazi ideology. Dönitz&#x27;s loyalty to him and the cause was rewarded by Hitler, who, owing to Dönitz&#x27;s leadership, never felt abandoned by the navy. In gratitude, Hitler appointed the navy&#x27;s commander as his successor before he committed suicide.

Dönitz&#x27;s influence on military matters was also evident. Hitler acted on Dönitz&#x27;s advice in September 1944 to block the Gulf of Finland after Finland abandoned the Axis powers. Operation Tanne Ost was a poorly executed disaster. Dönitz shared Hitler&#x27;s senseless strategic judgement—with the Courland Pocket on the verge of collapse, and the air and army forces requesting a withdrawal, the two men were preoccupied in planning an attack on an isolated island in the far north. Hitler&#x27;s willingness to listen to the naval commander was based on his high opinion of the navy&#x27;s usefulness at this time. It reinforced isolated coastal garrisons along the Baltic and evacuated thousands of German soldiers and civilians in order that they might continue to participate in the war effort into the spring of 1945.

Through 1944 and 1945, the Dönitz-initiated Operation Hannibal had the distinction of being the largest naval evacuation in history. The Baltic Fleet was presented with a mass of targets, the subsequent Soviet submarine Baltic Sea campaign in 1944 and Soviet naval Baltic Sea campaign in 1945 inflicted grievous losses during &quot;Hannibal&quot;. The most notable was the sinking of the &quot;MV Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; by a Soviet submarine. The liner had nearly 10,000 people on board. The evacuations continued after the surrender. From 3 to 9 May 1945, 81,000 of the 150,000 persons waiting on the Hel Peninsula were evacuated without loss. Albrecht Brandi, commander of the eastern Baltic, initiated a counter operation, the Gulf of Finland campaign, but failed to have an impact.
In the final days of the war, after Hitler had taken refuge in the beneath the Reich Chancellery garden in Berlin, Hermann Göring was considered the obvious successor to Hitler, followed by Heinrich Himmler. Göring, however, infuriated Hitler by radioing him in Berlin to ask for permission to assume leadership of the Reich. Himmler also tried to seize power by entering into negotiations with Count Bernadotte. On 28 April 1945, the BBC reported Himmler had offered surrender to the western Allies and that the offer had been declined.

From mid-April 1945, Dönitz and elements of what remained of the Reich government moved into the buildings of the &quot;Stadtheide Barracks&quot; in Plön. In his last will and testament, dated 29 April 1945, Hitler named Dönitz his successor as (Head of State), with the titles of &quot;Reichspräsident&quot; (President) and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. The same document named Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels as Head of Government with the title of (Chancellor). Hitler would not name any successors to hold his titles of Führer or leader of the Nazi Party. Furthermore, Hitler declared both Göring and Himmler traitors and expelled them from the party. He committed suicide on 30 April.

On 1 May, the day after Hitler&#x27;s own suicide, Goebbels committed suicide. Dönitz thus became the sole representative of the collapsing German Reich. On 2 May, the new government of the Reich fled to Flensburg-Mürwik. That night, 2 May, Dönitz made a nationwide radio address in which he announced Hitler&#x27;s death and said the war would continue in the East &quot;to save Germany from destruction by the advancing Bolshevik enemy.&quot; Dönitz remained in Flensburg–Mürwik until his arrest on 23 May 1945.

Dönitz knew that Germany&#x27;s position was untenable and the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; was no longer capable of offering meaningful resistance. During his brief period in office, he devoted most of his effort to ensuring the loyalty of the German armed forces and trying to ensure German personnel would surrender to the British or Americans and not the Soviets. He feared vengeful Soviet reprisals, and hoped to strike a deal with the Western Allies. In the end, Dönitz&#x27;s tactics were moderately successful, enabling about 1.8 million German soldiers to escape Soviet capture. As many as 2.2 million may have been evacuated.

===Flensburg Government===

On 4 May, Admiral Hans-Georg von Friedeburg, representing Dönitz, surrendered all German forces in the Netherlands, Denmark, and northwestern Germany to Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery at Lüneburg Heath southeast of Hamburg, signaling the end of World War II in northwestern Europe.

A day later, Dönitz sent Friedeburg to US General Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s headquarters in Rheims, France, to negotiate a surrender to the Allies. The Chief of Staff of OKW, (Colonel-General) Alfred Jodl, arrived a day later. Dönitz had instructed them to draw out the negotiations for as long as possible so that German troops and refugees could surrender to the Western powers, but when Eisenhower let it be known he would not tolerate their stalling, Dönitz authorized Jodl to sign the instrument of unconditional surrender at 1:30 on the morning of 7 May. Just over an hour later, Jodl signed the documents. The surrender documents included the phrase, &quot;All forces under German control to cease active operations at 23:01 hours Central European Time on 8 May 1945.&quot; At Stalin&#x27;s insistence, on 8 May, shortly before midnight, () Wilhelm Keitel repeated the signing in Berlin at Marshal Georgy Zhukov&#x27;s headquarters, with General Carl Spaatz of the USAAF present as Eisenhower&#x27;s representative. At the time specified, World War II in Europe ended.

On 23 May, the Dönitz government was dissolved when Dönitz was arrested by an RAF Regiment task force. The &quot;Großadmiral&quot; &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; flag, which was removed from his headquarters, can be seen at the RAF Regiment Heritage Centre at RAF Honington. Jodl, Speer and other members were also handed over to troops of the Herefordshire Regiment at Flensburg. His ceremonial baton, awarded to him by Hitler, can be seen in the regimental museum of the Kings Shropshire Light Infantry in Shrewsbury Castle and his car pennant in the regimental museum of the Herefordshire Light Infantry.

==Nazism and antisemitism==
Dönitz was a dedicated Nazi and a passionate supporter of Hitler, something he attempted to obscure after the war. Raeder described him as &quot;a picture-book Nazi and confirmed anti-Semite&quot;. Several naval officers described him as &quot;closely tied to Hitler and Nazi ideology.&quot; On occasion, he spoke of Hitler&#x27;s humanity. His fervent pro-Hitler attitude led to him being known ironically as &quot;Hitler Youth Quex&quot;, after the fictionalised hero of a Nazi novel and feature film. He refused to help Albert Speer stop the scorched earth policy dictated by Hitler and is also noted to have declared, &quot;In comparison to Hitler we are all pipsqueaks. Anyone who believes he can do better than the Führer is stupid.&quot;

Dönitz contributed to the spread of Nazism within the . He insisted that officers share his political views and, as head of the , formally joined the Nazi Party on 1 February 1944, as member 9,664,999. He was awarded the Golden Party Badge for his loyalty to the party later that year. Dönitz&#x27;s influence over naval officers contributed to none joining the attempts to kill Hitler.

From an ideological standpoint, Dönitz was anti-Marxist and antisemitic and believed that Germany needed to fight the &quot;poison of Jewry&quot;. Several anti-Semitic statements by Dönitz are known. When Sweden closed its international waters to Germany, he blamed this action on their fear and dependence on &quot;international Jewish capital.&quot; In August 1944, he declared, &quot;I would rather eat dirt than see my grandchildren grow up in the filthy, poisonous atmosphere of Jewry.&quot;

His fellow officers noted he was under Hitler&#x27;s influence, and closely wedded to Nazi ideology. On German Heroes&#x27; Day (12 March) of 1944, Dönitz declared that, without Adolf Hitler, Germany would be beset by &quot;the poison of Jewry,&quot; and the country destroyed for lack of the &quot;uncompromising ideology&quot; of Nazism:
At the Nuremberg trials, Dönitz claimed the statement about the &quot;poison of Jewry&quot; was regarding &quot;the endurance, the power to endure, of the people, as it was composed, could be better preserved than if there were Jewish elements in the nation.&quot; Later, during the Nuremberg trials, Dönitz claimed to know nothing about the extermination of Jews and declared that nobody among &quot;my men thought about violence against Jews.&quot; Dönitz told Leon Goldensohn, an American psychiatrist at Nuremberg, &quot;I never had any idea of the goings-on as far as Jews were concerned. Hitler said each man should take care of his business and mine was U-boats and the Navy.&quot; Following the war, Dönitz tried to hide his knowledge of The Holocaust. He was present at the October 1943 Posen Conference where Himmler described the mass murder of Jews with the intent of making the audience complicit in this crime. It cannot be proven beyond doubt that he was present during Himmler&#x27;s segment of the conference, which openly discussed the mass murder of European Jews.

Even after the Nuremberg Trials, with the crimes of the Nazi state well-known, Dönitz remained an antisemite. In April 1953, he told Speer that if it was the choice of the Americans and not the Jews, he would have been released.

==Nuremberg war crimes trials==
Following the war, Dönitz was held as a prisoner of war by the Allies. He was indicted as a major war criminal at the Nuremberg trials on three counts. One: conspiracy to commit crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Two: planning, initiating, and waging wars of aggression. Three: crimes against the laws of war. Dönitz was found not guilty on count one of the indictment, but guilty on counts two and three.

During the trial, army psychologist Gustave Gilbert was allowed to examine Nazi leaders on trial for war crimes. Among other tests, a German version of the Wechsler–Bellevue IQ test was administered. Dönitz and Hermann Göring scored 138, which made them equally the third-highest among the Nazi leaders tested.

At the trial, Dönitz was charged with waging unrestricted submarine warfare against neutral shipping, permitting Hitler&#x27;s Commando Order of 18 October 1942 to remain in full force when he became commander-in-chief of the Navy, and to that extent responsibility for that crime. His defence was that the order excluded men captured in naval warfare, and that the order had not been acted upon by any men under his command. Added to that was his knowledge of 12,000 involuntary foreign workers working in the shipyards, and doing nothing to stop it. Dönitz was unable to defend himself on this charge convincingly when cross-examined by prosecutor Sir David Maxwell Fyfe.

On 25 February 1945, Hitler asked Dönitz whether the Geneva Convention should be denounced. Hitler&#x27;s motives were twofold. The first was that reprisals could be taken against Western Allied prisoners of war; second, it would deter German forces from surrendering to the Western Allies, as was happening on the Eastern Front where the convention was in abeyance. Instead of arguing the conventions should never be denounced, Dönitz suggested it was not expedient to do so, so the court found against him on this issue; but as the convention was not denounced by Germany, and British prisoners in camps under Dönitz&#x27;s jurisdiction were treated strictly according to the Convention, the Court considered these mitigating circumstances.

Among the war-crimes charges, Dönitz was accused of waging unrestricted submarine warfare for issuing War Order No. 154 in 1939, and another similar order after the &quot;Laconia&quot; incident in 1942, not to rescue survivors from ships attacked by submarine. By issuing these two orders, he was found guilty of causing Germany to be in breach of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936. However, as evidence of similar conduct by the Allies was presented at his trial, his sentence was not assessed on the grounds of this breach of international law.

On the specific war crimes charge of ordering unrestricted submarine warfare, Dönitz was found &quot;[not] guilty for his conduct of submarine warfare against British armed merchant ships&quot;, because they were often armed and equipped with radios which they used to notify the admiralty of attack. As stated by the judges:
His sentence on unrestricted submarine warfare was not assessed because of similar actions by the Allies. In particular, the British Admiralty, on 8 May 1940, had ordered all vessels in the Skagerrak sunk on sight, and Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, wartime commander-in-chief of the United States Pacific Fleet, stated the US Navy had waged unrestricted submarine warfare against Japan in the Pacific from the day the US officially entered the war. Thus, Dönitz was not charged of waging unrestricted submarine warfare against unarmed neutral shipping by ordering all ships in designated areas in international waters to be sunk without warning.

Dönitz was imprisoned for 10 years in Spandau Prison in what was then West Berlin. During his period in prison he was unrepentant, and maintained that he had done nothing wrong. He also rejected Speer&#x27;s attempts to persuade him to end his devotion to Hitler and accept responsibility for the wrongs the German Government had committed. Conversely, over 100 senior Allied officers sent letters to Dönitz conveying their disappointment over the unfairness and verdict of his trial.

==Later years and death==
Dönitz was released on 1 October 1956 and retired to the small village of Aumühle in Schleswig-Holstein in northern West Germany. There, he worked on two books. His memoirs, &quot;Zehn Jahre, Zwanzig Tage&quot; (&quot;Memoirs: Ten Years and Twenty Days&quot;), were released in Germany in 1958 and became available in an English translation the following year. This book recounted Dönitz&#x27;s experiences as U-boat commander (10 years) and President of Germany (20 days). In it, Dönitz explains the Nazi regime as a product of its time, but argues he was not a politician and thus not morally responsible for many of the regime&#x27;s crimes. He likewise criticizes dictatorship as a fundamentally flawed form of government and blames it for many of the Nazi era&#x27;s failings. Historian Alan P. Rems has written that Dönitz&#x27;s memoirs are unconvincing and that &quot;unimpeded by a meaningful Nuremberg verdict, Dönitz fashioned a legend that could be embraced by the most unregenerate Nazis as well as credulous Allied officers who accepted his sanitized version of history and showered Dönitz with letters of support as a wronged brother-in-arms&quot;.
Dönitz&#x27;s second book, (&quot;My Ever-Changing Life&quot;) is less known, perhaps because it deals with the events of his life before 1934. This book was first published in 1968, and a new edition was released in 1998 with the revised title (&quot;My Martial Life&quot;). In 1973, he appeared in the Thames Television production &quot;The World at War&quot;, in one of his few television appearances.

Dönitz was unrepentant regarding his role in World War II, saying that he had acted at all times out of duty to his nation. In 1976, Dönitz appeared in &quot;The Memory of Justice&quot;. In the documentary, Dönitz explains about the Nuremberg trials and his experience during the trials in 1946 along with Albert Speer. He lived out the rest of his life in relative obscurity in Aumühle, occasionally corresponding with collectors of German naval history. Around 1974, Dönitz was contacted by Neo-Nazi conspiracy theorist and early &quot;Reichsbürger&quot; Manfred Roeder, who tried to prove that the German Reich still existed. Roeder assumed that Dönitz remained the legal head of state, but the former admiral considered the idea ridiculous and firmly stated that he no longer considered himself President of Germany. Regarding this as a resignation declaration, Roeder subsequently declared himself the new leader of Germany and eventually became active as a terrorist.

Dönitz died in Aumühle of a heart attack on Christmas Eve 1980 at the age of 89. As the last German officer with the rank of (grand admiral), he was honoured by many former servicemen and foreign naval officers who came to pay their respects at his funeral on 6 January 1981. He was buried in Waldfriedhof Cemetery in Aumühle without military honours, and service members were not allowed to wear uniforms to the funeral.

<doc id="16775" wikidata="Q47359" url="?curid=16775" title="Kyoto Protocol">
<text>The was an international treaty which extended the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that commits state parties to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, based on the scientific consensus that global warming is occurring and that human-made CO2 emissions are driving it. The Kyoto Protocol was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, on 11 December 1997 and entered into force on 16 February 2005. There were 192 parties (Canada withdrew from the protocol, effective December 2012) to the Protocol in 2020.

The Kyoto Protocol implemented the objective of the UNFCCC to reduce the onset of global warming by reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to &quot;a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system&quot; (Article 2). The Kyoto Protocol applied to the seven greenhouse gases listed in Annex A: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). Nitrogen trifluoride was added for the second compliance period during the Doha Round.

The Protocol was based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities: it acknowledged that individual countries have different capabilities in combating climate change, owing to economic development, and therefore placed the obligation to reduce current emissions on developed countries on the basis that they are historically responsible for the current levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

The Protocol&#x27;s first commitment period started in 2008 and ended in 2012. All 36 countries that fully participated in the first commitment period complied with the Protocol. However, nine countries had to resort to the flexibility mechanisms by funding emission reductions in other countries because their national emissions were slightly greater than their targets. The 2007–2008 financial crisis reduced emissions. The greatest emission reductions were seen in the former Eastern Bloc countries because the dissolution of the Soviet Union reduced their emissions in the early 1990s. Even though the 36 developed countries reduced their emissions, the global emissions increased by 32% from 1990 to 2010.

A second commitment period was agreed to in 2012 to extend the agreement to 2020, known as the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, in which 37 countries had binding targets: Australia, the European Union (and its then 28 member states, now 27), Belarus, Iceland, Kazakhstan, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, and Ukraine. Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine stated that they may withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol or not put into legal force the Amendment with second round targets. Japan, New Zealand, and Russia had participated in Kyoto&#x27;s first-round but did not take on new targets in the second commitment period. Other developed countries without second-round targets were Canada (which withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol in 2012) and the United States (which did not ratify). If they were to remain as a part of the protocol, Canada would be hit with a $14 billion fine, which would be devastating to their economy, hence the reluctant decision to exit. As of October 2020, 147 states had accepted the Doha Amendment. It entered into force on 31 December 2020, following its acceptance by the mandated minimum of at least 144 states, although the second commitment period ended on the same day. Of the 37 parties with binding commitments, 34 had ratified.

Negotiations were held in the framework of the yearly UNFCCC Climate Change Conferences on measures to be taken after the second commitment period ended in 2020. This resulted in the 2015 adoption of the Paris Agreement, which is a separate instrument under the UNFCCC rather than an amendment of the Kyoto Protocol.

== Chronology ==
1992 – The UN Conference on the Environment and Development is held in Rio de Janeiro. It results in the Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) among other agreements.

1995 – Parties to the UNFCCC meet in Berlin (the 1st Conference of Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC) to outline specific targets on emissions.

1997 – In December the parties conclude the Kyoto Protocol in Kyoto, Japan, in which they agree to the broad outlines of emissions targets.

2004 – Russia and Canada ratify the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC bringing the treaty into effect on 16 February 2005.

2011 – Canada became the first signatory to announce its withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol.

2012 – On 31 December 2012, the first commitment period under the Protocol expired.

The official meeting of all states party to the Kyoto Protocol is the annual Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The first conference was held in 1995 in Berlin (COP 1). The first Meeting of Parties of the Kyoto Protocol (CMP) was held in 2005 in conjunction with COP 11.

==Objectives==
The main goal of the Kyoto Protocol was to control emissions of the main anthropogenic (human-emitted) greenhouse gases (GHGs) in ways that reflect underlying national differences in GHG emissions, wealth, and capacity to make the reductions. The treaty follows the main principles agreed in the original 1992 UN Framework Convention. According to the treaty, in 2012, Annex I Parties who have ratified the treaty must have fulfilled their obligations of greenhouse gas emissions limitations established for the Kyoto Protocol&#x27;s first commitment period (2008–2012). These emissions limitation commitments are listed in Annex B of the Protocol.

The Kyoto Protocol&#x27;s first round commitments are the first detailed step taken within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Protocol establishes a structure of rolling emission reduction commitment periods. It set a timetable starting in 2006 for negotiations to establish emission reduction commitments for a second commitment period. The first period emission reduction commitments expired on 31 December 2012.

The first-round Kyoto emissions limitation commitments were not sufficient to stabilize the atmospheric concentration of GHGs. Stabilization of atmospheric GHG concentrations will require further emissions reductions after the end of the first-round Kyoto commitment period in 2012.

The ultimate objective of the UNFCCC is the &quot;stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would stop dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.&quot; Even if Annex I Parties succeed in meeting their first-round commitments, much greater emission reductions will be required in future to stabilize atmospheric GHG concentrations.

For each of the different anthropogenic GHGs, different levels of emissions reductions would be required to meet the objective of stabilizing atmospheric concentrations. Carbon dioxide () is the most important anthropogenic GHG. Stabilizing the concentration of in the atmosphere would ultimately require the effective elimination of anthropogenic emissions.

To achieve stabilization, global GHG emissions must peak, then decline. The lower the desired stabilization level, the sooner this peak and decline must occur. For a given stabilization level, larger emissions reductions in the near term allow for less stringent emissions reductions later. On the other hand, less stringent near term emissions reductions would, for a given stabilization level, require more stringent emissions reductions later on.

The first period Kyoto emissions limitations can be viewed as a first-step towards achieving atmospheric stabilization of GHGs. In this sense, the first period Kyoto commitments may affect what future atmospheric stabilization level can be achieved.

== Principal concepts ==
Some of the principal concepts of the Kyoto Protocol are:
* Binding commitments for the Annex I Parties. The main feature of the Protocol is that it established legally binding commitments to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases for Annex I Parties. The commitments were based on the Berlin Mandate, which was a part of UNFCCC negotiations leading up to the Protocol.
* Implementation. In order to meet the objectives of the Protocol, Annex I Parties are required to prepare policies and measures for the reduction of greenhouse gases in their respective countries. In addition, they are required to increase the absorption of these gases and utilize all mechanisms available, such as joint implementation, the clean development mechanism and emissions trading, in order to be rewarded with credits that would allow more greenhouse gas emissions at home.
* Minimizing Impacts on Developing Countries by establishing an adaptation fund for climate change.
* Accounting, Reporting and Review in order to ensure the integrity of the Protocol.
* Compliance. Establishing a Compliance Committee to enforce compliance with the commitments under the Protocol.

=== Flexibility mechanisms ===
The Protocol defines three &quot;Flexibility Mechanisms&quot; that can be used by Annex I Parties in meeting their emission limitation commitments. The flexibility mechanisms are International Emissions Trading (IET), the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), and Joint Implementation (JI). IET allows Annex I Parties to &quot;trade&quot; their emissions (Assigned Amount Units, AAUs, or &quot;allowances&quot; for short).

The economic basis for providing this flexibility is that the marginal cost of reducing (or abating) emissions differs among countries. &quot;Marginal cost&quot; is the cost of abating the last tonne of -eq for an Annex I/non-Annex I Party. At the time of the original Kyoto targets, studies suggested that the flexibility mechanisms could reduce the overall (aggregate) cost of meeting the targets. Studies also showed that national losses in Annex I gross domestic product (GDP) could be reduced by the use of the flexibility mechanisms.

The CDM and JI are called &quot;project-based mechanisms&quot;, in that they generate emission reductions from projects. The difference between IET and the project-based mechanisms is that IET is based on the setting of a quantitative restriction of emissions, while the CDM and JI are based on the idea of &quot;production&quot; of emission reductions. The CDM is designed to encourage production of emission reductions in non-Annex I Parties, while JI encourages production of emission reductions in Annex I Parties.

The production of emission reductions generated by the CDM and JI can be used by Annex I Parties in meeting their emission limitation commitments. The emission reductions produced by the CDM and JI are both measured against a hypothetical baseline of emissions that would have occurred in the absence of a particular emission reduction project. The emission reductions produced by the CDM are called Certified emission reductions (CERs); reductions produced by JI are called emission reduction units (ERUs). The reductions are called &quot;credits&quot; because they are emission reductions credited against a hypothetical baseline of emissions.

Only emission reduction projects that do not involve using nuclear energy are eligible for accreditation under the CDM, in order to prevent nuclear technology exports from becoming the default route for obtaining credits under the CDM.

Each Annex I country is required to submit an annual report of inventories of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from sources and removals from sinks under UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol. These countries nominate a person (called a &quot;designated national authority&quot;) to create and manage its greenhouse gas inventory. Virtually all of the non-Annex I countries have also established a designated national authority to manage their Kyoto obligations, specifically the &quot;CDM process&quot;. This determines which GHG projects they wish to propose for accreditation by the CDM Executive Board.

==== International emissions trading ====
===== Intergovernmental emissions trading =====
The design of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) implicitly allows for trade of national Kyoto obligations to occur between participating countries. The Carbon Trust found that other than the trading that occurs as part of the EU ETS, no intergovernmental emissions trading had taken place.

One of the environmental problems with IET is the large surplus of allowances that are available. Russia, Ukraine, and the new EU-12 member states (the Kyoto Parties Annex I Economies-in-Transition, abbreviated &quot;EIT&quot;: Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Ukraine) have a surplus of allowances, while many OECD countries have a deficit. Some of the EITs with a surplus regard it as potential compensation for the trauma of their economic restructuring. When the Kyoto treaty was negotiated, it was recognized that emissions targets for the EITs might lead to them having an excess number of allowances. This excess of allowances were viewed by the EITs as &quot;headroom&quot; to grow their economies. The surplus has, however, also been referred to by some as &quot;hot air&quot;, a term which Russia (a country with an estimated surplus of 3.1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent allowances) views as &quot;quite offensive&quot;.

OECD countries with a deficit could meet their Kyoto commitments by buying allowances from transition countries with a surplus. Unless other commitments were made to reduce the total surplus in allowances, such trade would not actually result in emissions being reduced (see also the section below on the Green Investment Scheme).

===== &quot;Green Investment Schemes&quot; =====
The &quot;Green Investment Scheme&quot; (GIS) is a plan for achieving environmental benefits from trading surplus allowances (AAUs) under the Kyoto Protocol. The Green Investment Scheme (GIS), a mechanism in the framework of International Emissions Trading (IET), is designed to achieve greater flexibility in reaching the targets of the Kyoto Protocol while preserving environmental integrity of IET. However, using the GIS is not required under the Kyoto Protocol, and there is no official definition of the term.

Under the GIS a party to the protocol expecting that the development of its economy will not exhaust its Kyoto quota, can sell the excess of its Kyoto quota units (AAUs) to another party. The proceeds from the AAU sales should be &quot;greened&quot;, i.e. channelled to the development and implementation of the projects either acquiring the greenhouse gases emission reductions (hard greening) or building up the necessary framework for this process (soft greening).

===== Trade in AAUs =====
Latvia was one of the front-runners of GISs. World Bank (2011) reported that Latvia has stopped offering AAU sales because of low AAU prices. In 2010, Estonia was the preferred source for AAU buyers, followed by the Czech Republic and Poland.

Japan&#x27;s national policy to meet their Kyoto target includes the purchase of AAUs sold under GISs. In 2010, Japan and Japanese firms were the main buyers of AAUs. In terms of the international carbon market, trade in AAUs are a small proportion of overall market value. In 2010, 97% of trade in the international carbon market was driven by the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS).

===== Clean Development Mechanism =====
Between 2001, which was the first year Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects could be registered, and 2012, the end of the first Kyoto commitment period, the CDM is expected to produce some 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in emission reductions. Most of these reductions are through renewable energy commercialisation, energy efficiency, and fuel switching (World Bank, 2010, p. 262). By 2012, the largest potential for production of CERs are estimated in China (52% of total CERs) and India (16%). CERs produced in Latin America and the Caribbean make up 15% of the potential total, with Brazil as the largest producer in the region (7%).

===== Joint Implementation =====
The formal crediting period for Joint Implementation (JI) was aligned with the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, and did not start until January 2008 (Carbon Trust, 2009, p. 20). In November 2008, only 22 JI projects had been officially approved and registered. The total projected emission savings from JI by 2012 are about one tenth that of the CDM. Russia accounts for about two-thirds of these savings, with the remainder divided up roughly equally between Ukraine and the EU&#x27;s New Member States. Emission savings include cuts in methane, HFC, and N2O emissions.

==Details of the agreement==
The agreement is a protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) adopted at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, which did not set any legally binding limitations on emissions or enforcement mechanisms. Only Parties to the UNFCCC can become Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol was adopted at the third session of the Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan.

National emission targets specified in the Kyoto Protocol exclude international aviation and shipping. Kyoto Parties can use land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF) in meeting their targets. LULUCF activities are also called &quot;sink&quot; activities. Changes in sinks and land use can have an effect on the climate, and indeed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&#x27;s Special Report on Land use, land-use change, and forestry estimates that since 1750 a third of global warming has been caused by land use change. Particular criteria apply to the definition of forestry under the Kyoto Protocol.

Forest management, cropland management, grazing land management, and revegetation are all eligible LULUCF activities under the Protocol. Annex I Parties use of forest management in meeting their targets is capped.

=== First commitment period: 2008–2012 ===
Under the Kyoto Protocol, 37 industrialized countries and the European Community (the European Union-15, made up of 15 states at the time of the Kyoto negotiations) commit themselves to binding targets for GHG emissions. The targets apply to the four greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (), methane (), nitrous oxide (), sulphur hexafluoride (), and two groups of gases, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs). The six GHG are translated into CO2 equivalents in determining reductions in emissions. These reduction targets are in addition to the industrial gases, chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which are dealt with under the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.

Under the Protocol, only the Annex I Parties have committed themselves to national or joint reduction targets (formally called &quot;quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives&quot; (QELRO) – Article 4.1). Parties to the Kyoto Protocol not listed in Annex I of the convention (the non-Annex I Parties) are mostly low-income developing countries, and may participate in the Kyoto Protocol through the Clean Development Mechanism (explained below).

The emissions limitations of Annex I Parties varies between different Parties. Some Parties have emissions limitations reduce below the base year level, some have limitations at the base year level (no permitted increase above the base year level), while others have limitations above the base year level.

Emission limits do not include emissions by international aviation and shipping. Although Belarus and Turkey are listed in the convention&#x27;s Annex I, they do not have emissions targets as they were not Annex I Parties when the Protocol was adopted. Kazakhstan does not have a target, but has declared that it wishes to become an Annex I Party to the convention.

For most state parties, 1990 is the base year for the national GHG inventory and the calculation of the assigned amount. However, five state parties have an alternative base year:
* Bulgaria: 1988;
* Hungary: the average of the years 1985–1987;
* Poland: 1988;
* Romania: 1989;
* Slovenia: 1986.

Annex I Parties can use a range of sophisticated &quot;flexibility&quot; mechanisms (see below) to meet their targets. Annex I Parties can achieve their targets by allocating reduced annual allowances to major operators within their borders, or by allowing these operators to exceed their allocations by offsetting any excess through a mechanism that is agreed by all the parties to the UNFCCC, such as by buying emission allowances from other operators which have excess emissions credits.

===Negotiations===

Article 4.2 of the UNFCCC commits industrialized countries to &quot;[take] the lead&quot; in reducing emissions. The initial aim was for industrialized countries to stabilize their emissions at 1990 levels by 2000. The failure of key industrialized countries to move in this direction was a principal reason why Kyoto moved to binding commitments.

At the first UNFCCC Conference of the Parties in Berlin, the G77 was able to push for a mandate (the &quot;Berlin mandate&quot;) where it was recognized that:
* developed nations had contributed most to the then-current concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere (see Greenhouse gas emissions).
* developing country emissions per-capita (i.e., average emissions per head of population) were still relatively low.
* and that the share of global emissions from developing countries would grow to meet their development needs.
During negotiations, the G-77 represented 133 developing countries. China was not a member of the group but an associate. It has since become a member.

The Berlin mandate was recognized in the Kyoto Protocol in that developing countries were not subject to emission reduction commitments in the first Kyoto commitment period. However, the large potential for growth in developing country emissions made negotiations on this issue tense. In the final agreement, the Clean Development Mechanism was designed to limit emissions in developing countries, but in such a way that developing countries do not bear the costs for limiting emissions. The general assumption was that developing countries would face quantitative commitments in later commitment periods, and at the same time, developed countries would meet their first round commitments.

====Emissions cuts====
There were multiple emissions cuts proposed by UNFCCC parties during negotiations. The G77 and China were in favour of strong uniform emission cuts across the developed world. The US originally proposed for the second round of negotiations on Kyoto commitments to follow the negotiations of the first. In the end, negotiations on the second period were set to open no later than 2005. Countries over-achieving in their first period commitments can &quot;bank&quot; their unused allowances for use in the subsequent period.

The EU initially argued for only three GHGs to be included – , , and – with other gases such as HFCs regulated separately. The EU also wanted to have a &quot;bubble&quot; commitment, whereby it could make a collective commitment that allowed some EU members to increase their emissions, while others cut theirs.

The most vulnerable nations – the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) – pushed for deep uniform cuts by developed nations, with the goal of having emissions reduced to the greatest possible extent. Countries that had supported differentiation of targets had different ideas as to how it should be calculated, and many different indicators were proposed. Two examples include differentiation of targets based on gross domestic product (GDP), and differentiation based on energy intensity (energy use per unit of economic output).

The final targets negotiated in the Protocol are the result of last minute political compromises. The targets closely match those decided by Argentinian Raul Estrada, the diplomat who chaired the negotiations. The numbers given to each Party by Chairman Estrada were based on targets already pledged by Parties, information received on latest negotiating positions, and the goal of achieving the strongest possible environmental outcome. The final targets are weaker than those proposed by some Parties, e.g., the Alliance of Small Island States and the G-77 and China, but stronger than the targets proposed by others, e.g., Canada and the United States.

==== Relation to temperature targets ====
At the 16th Conference of the Parties held in 2010, Parties to the UNFCCC agreed that future global warming should be limited below 2°C relative to the pre-industrial temperature level. One of the stabilization levels discussed in relation to this temperature target is to hold atmospheric concentrations of GHGs at 450 parts per million (ppm) - eq. Stabilization at 450 ppm could be associated with a 26 to 78% risk of exceeding the 2 °C target.

Scenarios assessed by Gupta &quot;et al.&quot; (2007) suggest that Annex I emissions would need to be 25% to 40% below 1990 levels by 2020, and 80% to 95% below 1990 levels by 2050. The only Annex I Parties to have made voluntary pledges in line with this are Japan (25% below 1990 levels by 2020) and Norway (30–40% below 1990 levels by 2020).

Gupta &quot;et al.&quot; (2007) also looked at what 450 ppm scenarios projected for non-Annex I Parties. Projections indicated that by 2020, non-Annex I emissions in several regions (Latin America, the Middle East, East Asia, and centrally planned Asia) would need to be substantially reduced below &quot;business-as-usual&quot;. &quot;Business-as-usual&quot; are projected non-Annex I emissions in the absence of any new policies to control emissions. Projections indicated that by 2050, emissions in all non-Annex I regions would need to be substantially reduced below &quot;business-as-usual&quot;.

===Financial commitments===

The Protocol also reaffirms the principle that developed countries have to pay billions of dollars, and supply technology to other countries for climate-related studies and projects. The principle was originally agreed in UNFCCC. One such project is The Adaptation Fund, which has been established by the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes in developing countries that are Parties to the Kyoto Protocol.

===Implementation provisions===
The protocol left several issues open to be decided later by the sixth Conference of Parties COP6 of the UNFCCC, which attempted to resolve these issues at its meeting in the Hague in late 2000, but it was unable to reach an agreement due to disputes between the European Union (who favoured a tougher implementation) and the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia (who wanted the agreement to be less demanding and more flexible).

In 2001, a continuation of the previous meeting (COP6-bis) was held in Bonn, where the required decisions were adopted. After some concessions, the supporters of the protocol (led by the European Union) managed to secure the agreement of Japan and Russia by allowing more use of carbon dioxide sinks.

COP7 was held from 29 October 2001 through 9 November 2001 in Marrakech to establish the final details of the protocol.

The first Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (MOP1) was held in Montreal from 28 November to 9 December 2005, along with the 11th conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP11). See United Nations Climate Change Conference.

During COP13 in Bali, 36 developed Contact Group countries (plus the EU as a party in the European Union) agreed to a 10% emissions increase for Iceland; but, since the EU&#x27;s member states each have individual obligations, much larger increases (up to 27%) are allowed for some of the less developed EU countries (see below ). Reduction limitations expired in 2013.

===Mechanism of compliance===

The protocol defines a mechanism of &quot;compliance&quot; as a &quot;monitoring compliance with the commitments and penalties for non-compliance.&quot; According to Grubb (2003), the explicit consequences of non-compliance of the treaty are weak compared to domestic law. Yet, the compliance section of the treaty was highly contested in the Marrakesh Accords.

===Monitoring emissions===
Monitoring emissions in international agreements is tough as in international law, there is no police power, creating the incentive for states to find &#x27;ways around&#x27; monitoring. The Kyoto Protocol regulated six sinks and sources of Gases. Carbon dioxide, Methane, Nirous oxide, Hydroflurocarbons, Sulfur hexafluouride and Perfluorocarbons. Monitoring these gases can become quite a challenge. Methane can be monitored and measured from irrigated rice fields and can be measured by the seedling growing up to harvest. Future implications state that this can be affected by more cost effective ways to control emissions as changes in types of fertilizer can reduce emissions by 50%. In addition to this, many countries are unable to monitor certain ways of carbon absorption through trees and soils to an accurate level.

===Enforcing emission cuts===

If the enforcement branch determines that an Annex I country is not in compliance with its emissions limitation, then that country is required to make up the difference during the second commitment period plus an additional 30%. In addition, that country will be suspended from making transfers under an emissions trading program.

==Ratification process==
===Countries that ratified the Protocol===
The Protocol was adopted by COP 3 of UNFCCC on 11 December 1997 in Kyoto, Japan. It was opened on 16 March 1998 for signature during one year by parties to UNFCCC, when it was signed Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, the Maldives, Samoa, St. Lucia and Switzerland. At the end of the signature period, 82 countries and the European Community had signed. Ratification (which is required to become a party to the Protocol) started on 17 September with ratification by Fiji. Countries that did not sign acceded to the convention, which has the same legal effect.

Article 25 of the Protocol specifies that the Protocol enters into force &quot;on the ninetieth day after the date on which not less than 55 Parties to the Convention, incorporating Parties included in Annex I which accounted in total for at least 55% of the total carbon dioxide emissions for 1990 of the Annex I countries, have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession.&quot;

The EU and its Member States ratified the Protocol in May 2002. Of the two conditions, the &quot;55 parties&quot; clause was reached on 23 May 2002 when Iceland ratified the Protocol. The ratification by Russia on 18 November 2004 satisfied the &quot;55%&quot; clause and brought the treaty into force, effective 16 February 2005, after the required lapse of 90 days.

As of May 2013, 191 countries and one regional economic organization (the EC) have ratified the agreement, representing over 61.6% of the 1990 emissions from Annex I countries. One of the 191 ratifying states—Canada—has renounced the protocol.

===Non-ratification by the US===
The US signed the Protocol on 12 November 1998, during the Clinton presidency. To become binding in the US, however, the treaty had to be ratified by the Senate, which had already passed the 1997 non-binding Byrd-Hagel Resolution, expressing disapproval of any international agreement that did not require developing countries to make emission reductions and &quot;would seriously harm the economy of the United States&quot;. The resolution passed 95–0. Therefore, even though the Clinton administration signed the treaty, it was never submitted to the Senate for ratification.

At the outset of the Bush administration, Senators Chuck Hagel, Jesse Helms, Larry Craig, and Pat Roberts wrote a letter to President George W. Bush seeking to identify his position on the Kyoto Protocol and climate change policy. In a letter dated March 13, 2001, President Bush responded that his &quot;Administration takes the issue of global climate change very seriously&quot;, but that &quot;I oppose the Kyoto Protocol because it exempts 80 percent of the world, including major population centers such as China and India, from compliance, and would cause serious harm to the U.S. economy. The Senate&#x27;s vote, 95-0, shows that there is a clear consensus that the Kyoto Protocol is an unfair and ineffective means of addressing global climate change concerns.&quot; The administration also questioned the scientific certainty around climate change and cited potential harms of emissions reduction to the US economy.

The Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research reported in 2001:This policy reversal received a massive wave of criticism that was quickly picked up by the international media. Environmental groups blasted the White House, while Europeans and Japanese alike expressed deep concern and regret. ... Almost all world leaders (e.g. China, Japan, South Africa, Pacific Islands, etc.) expressed their disappointment at Bush&#x27;s decision.In response to this criticism, Bush stated: &quot;I was responding to reality, and reality is the nation has got a real problem when it comes to energy&quot;. The Tyndall Centre called this &quot;an overstatement used to cover up the big benefactors of this policy reversal, i.e., the US oil and coal industry, which has a powerful lobby with the administration and conservative Republican congressmen.&quot;

As of 2023, the US is the only signatory that has not ratified the Protocol. The US accounted for 36.1% of emissions in 1990. As such, for the treaty to go into legal effect without US ratification, it would require a coalition including the EU, Russia, Japan, and small parties. A deal, without the US Administration, was reached in the Bonn climate talks (COP-6.5), held in 2001.

===Withdrawal of Canada===


In 2011, Canada, Japan and Russia stated that they would not take on further Kyoto targets. The Canadian government announced its withdrawal—possible at any time three years after ratification—from the Kyoto Protocol on 12 December 2011, effective 15 December 2012. Canada was committed to cutting its greenhouse emissions to 6% below 1990 levels by 2012, but in 2009 emissions were 17% higher than in 1990. The Harper government prioritized oil sands development in Alberta, and deprioritized the reduction of greenhouse emissions. Environment minister Peter Kent cited Canada&#x27;s liability to &quot;enormous financial penalties&quot; under the treaty unless it withdrew. He also suggested that the recently signed Durban agreement may provide an alternative way forward. The Harper government claimed it would find a &quot;Made in Canada&quot; solution. Canada&#x27;s decision received a generally negative response from representatives of other ratifying countries.

===Other states and territories where the treaty was not applicable===
Andorra, Palestine, South Sudan, the United States and, following their withdrawal on 15 December 2012, Canada are the only UNFCCC Parties that are not party to the Protocol. Furthermore, the Protocol is not applied to UNFCCC observer the Holy See. Although the Kingdom of the Netherlands approved the protocol for the whole Kingdom, it did not deposit an instrument of ratification for Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten or the Caribbean Netherlands.

== Country types and their emissions ==
===Annex I countries===
Total aggregate GHG emissions excluding emissions/removals from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF, i.e., carbon storage in forests and soils) for all Annex I Parties (see list below) including the United States taken together decreased from 19.0 to 17.8 thousand teragrams (Tg, which is equal to 109 kg) equivalent, a decline of 6.0% during the 1990–2008 period. Several factors have contributed to this decline. The first is due to the economic restructuring in the Annex I Economies in Transition (the EITs – see Intergovernmental Emissions Trading for the list of EITs). Over the period 1990–1999, emissions fell by 40% in the EITs following the collapse of central planning in the former Soviet Union and east European countries. This led to a massive contraction of their heavy industry-based economies, with associated reductions in their fossil fuel consumption and emissions.

Emissions growth in Annex I Parties have also been limited due to policies and measures (PaMs). In particular, PaMs were strengthened after 2000, helping to enhance energy efficiency and develop renewable energy sources. Energy use also decreased during the economic crisis in 2007–2008.

====Annex I parties with targets====


Collectively the group of industrialized countries committed to a Kyoto target, i.e., the Annex I countries excluding the US, had a target of reducing their GHG emissions by 4.2% on average for the period 2008–2012 relative to the base year, which in most cases is 1990.

As noted in the preceding section, between 1990 and 1999, there was a large reduction in the emissions of the EITs. The reduction in the EITs is largely responsible for the total (aggregate) reduction (excluding LULUCF) in emissions of the Annex I countries, excluding the US. Emissions of the Annex II countries (Annex I minus the EIT countries) have experienced a limited increase in emissions from 1990 to 2006, followed by stabilization and a more marked decrease from 2007 onwards. The emissions reductions in the early nineties by the 12 EIT countries who have since joined the EU, assist the present EU-27 in meeting its collective Kyoto target.

In December 2011, Canada&#x27;s environment minister, Peter Kent, formally announced that Canada would withdraw from the Kyoto accord a day after the end of the 2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference (see the section on the withdrawal of Canada).

====Annex I parties without Kyoto targets====
Belarus, Malta, and Turkey are Annex I Parties but did not have first-round Kyoto targets. The US had a Kyoto target of a 7% reduction relative to the 1990 level, but has not ratified the treaty. If the US had ratified the Kyoto Protocol, the average percentage reduction in total GHG emissions for the Annex I group would have been a 5.2% reduction relative to the base year.

===Non-Annex I===

UNFCCC (2005) compiled and synthesized information reported to it by non-Annex I Parties. Most non-Annex I Parties belonged in the low-income group, with very few classified as middle-income. Most Parties included information on policies relating to sustainable development. Sustainable development priorities mentioned by non-Annex I Parties included poverty alleviation and access to basic education and health care. Many non-Annex I Parties are making efforts to amend and update their environmental legislation to include global concerns such as climate change.

A few Parties, e.g., South Africa and Iran, stated their concern over how efforts to reduce emissions by Annex I Parties could adversely affect their economies. The economies of these countries are highly dependent on income generated from the production, processing, and export of fossil fuels.

GHG emissions, excluding land use change and forestry (LUCF), reported by 122 non-Annex I Parties for the year 1994 or the closest year reported, totalled 11.7 billion tonnes (billion = 1,000,000,000) of CO2-eq. CO2 was the largest proportion of emissions (63%), followed by methane (26%) and nitrous oxide (N2O) (11%).

The energy sector was the largest source of emissions for 70 Parties, whereas for 45 Parties the agriculture sector was the largest. Per capita emissions (in tonnes of CO2-eq, excluding LUCF) averaged 2.8 tonnes for the 122 non-Annex I Parties.
* The Africa region&#x27;s aggregate emissions were 1.6 billion tonnes, with per capita emissions of 2.4 tonnes.
* The Asia and Pacific region&#x27;s aggregate emissions were 7.9 billion tonnes, with per capita emissions of 2.6 tonnes.
* The Latin America and Caribbean region&#x27;s aggregate emissions were 2 billion tonnes, with per capita emissions of 4.6 tonnes.
* The &quot;other&quot; region includes Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Malta, Moldova, and North Macedonia. Their aggregate emissions were 0.1 billion tonnes, with per capita emissions of 5.1 tonnes.

Parties reported a high level of uncertainty in LUCF emissions, but in aggregate, there appeared to only be a small difference of 1.7% with and without LUCF. With LUCF, emissions were 11.9 billion tonnes, without LUCF, total aggregate emissions were 11.7 billion tonnes.

==Problem areas==

=== Views and criticism of the Protocol ===
Gupta &quot;et al.&quot; (2007) assessed the literature on climate change policy. They found that no authoritative assessments of the UNFCCC or its Protocol asserted that these agreements had, or will, succeed in solving the climate problem. In these assessments, it was assumed that the UNFCCC or its Protocol would not be changed. The Framework Convention and its Protocol include provisions for future policy actions to be taken.

Gupta &quot;et al.&quot; (2007) described the Kyoto first-round commitments as &quot;modest&quot;, stating that they acted as a constraint on the treaty&#x27;s effectiveness. It was suggested that subsequent Kyoto commitments could be made more effective with measures aimed at achieving deeper cuts in emissions, as well as having policies applied to a larger share of global emissions. In 2008, countries with a Kyoto cap made up less than one-third of annual global carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion.

World Bank (2010) commented on how the Kyoto Protocol had only had a slight effect on curbing global emissions growth. The treaty was negotiated in 1997, but in 2006, energy-related carbon dioxide emissions had grown by 24%. World Bank (2010) also stated that the treaty had provided only limited financial support to developing countries to assist them in reducing their emissions and adapting to climate change.

Some environmentalists have supported the Kyoto Protocol because it is &quot;the only game in town&quot;, and possibly because they expect that future emission reduction commitments may demand more stringent emission reductions (Aldy &quot;et al.&quot;., 2003, p. 9). In 2001, seventeen national science academies stated that ratification of the Protocol represented a &quot;small but essential first step towards stabilising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.&quot; Some environmentalists and scientists have criticized the existing commitments for being too weak (Grubb, 2000, p. 5).

The United States (under former President George W. Bush) and Australia (initially, under former Prime Minister John Howard) did not ratify the Kyoto treaty. According to Stern (2006), their decision was based on the lack of quantitative emission commitments for emerging economies (see also the 2000 onwards section). Australia, under former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, has since ratified the treaty, which took effect in March 2008.

=== Compliance ===
38 developed countries committed to limiting their greenhouse gas emissions. Because the United States did not ratify and Canada withdrew, the emission limits remained in force for 36 countries. All of them complied with the Protocol. However, nine countries (Austria, Denmark, Iceland, Japan, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain and Switzerland) had to resort to the flexibility mechanisms because their national emissions were slightly greater than their targets.

In total, the 36 countries that fully participated in the Protocol were committed to reducing their aggregate emissions by 4% from the 1990 base year. Their average annual emissions in 2008–2012 were 24.2% below the 1990 level. Hence, they surpassed their aggregate commitment by a large margin. If the United States and Canada are included, the emissions decreased by 11.8%. The large reductions were mainly thanks to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which reduced the emissions of the Eastern Bloc by tens of percents in the early 1990s. In addition, the financial crisis of 2007–08 significantly reduced emissions during the first Kyoto commitment period.

The 36 countries that were committed to emission reductions only accounted for 24% of the global greenhouse gas emissions in 2010. Even though these countries significantly reduced their emissions during the Kyoto commitment period, other countries increased their emissions so much that the global emissions increased by 32% from 1990 to 2010.

=== Emission trends in developing countries ===
In several large developing countries and fast growing economies (China, India, Thailand, Indonesia, Egypt, and Iran) GHG emissions have increased rapidly (PBL, 2009). For example, emissions in China have risen strongly over the 1990–2005 period, often by more than 10% year. Emissions per-capita in non-Annex I countries are still, for the most part, much lower than in industrialized countries. Non-Annex I countries do not have quantitative emission reduction commitments, but they are committed to mitigation actions. China, for example, has had a national policy programme to reduce emissions growth, which included the closure of old, less efficient coal-fired power plants.

===Views on the flexibility mechanisms===

Another area which has been commented on is the role of the Kyoto flexibility mechanisms – carbon emission trading, Joint Implementation, and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The flexibility mechanisms have attracted both positive and negative comments.

One of the arguments made in favour of the flexibility mechanisms is that they can reduce the costs incurred by Annex I Parties in meeting their Kyoto commitments. Criticisms of flexibility have, for example, included the ineffectiveness of emissions trading in promoting investment in non-fossil energy sources, and adverse impacts of CDM projects on local communities in developing countries.

China, India, Indonesia and Brazil were not required to reduce their CO2 emissions. The remaining signatory countries were not obliged to implement a common framework nor specific measures, but to reach an emission reduction target for which they can benefit of a secondary market for carbon credits multilaterally exchanged from each other. The Emissions-trading Scheme (ETS) allowed countries to host polluting industries and to buy from other countries the property of their environmental merits and virtuous patterns.

A 2021 review considers both the institutional design and the political strategies that have affected the adoption of the Kyoto protocol. It concludes that the Kyoto protocol&#x27;s relatively small impact on global carbon dioxide emissions reflects a number of factors, including &quot;deliberate political strategy, unequal power, and the absence of leadership&quot; among and within nations. The efforts of fossil fuel interests and conservative think tanks to spread disinformation and climate change denial have influenced public opinion and political action both within the United States and beyond it. The direct lobbying of fossil fuel companies and their funding of political actors have slowed political action to address climate change at regional, national, and international levels.

==Amendment and successor==
In the non-binding &quot;Washington Declaration&quot; agreed on 16 February 2007, heads of governments from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Africa agreed in principle on the outline of a successor to the Kyoto Protocol. They envisaged a global cap-and-trade system that would apply to both industrialized nations and developing countries, and initially hoped that it would be in place by 2009.

The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December 2009 was one of the annual series of UN meetings that followed the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio. In 1997 the talks led to the Kyoto Protocol, and the conference in Copenhagen was considered to be the opportunity to agree a successor to Kyoto that would bring about meaningful carbon cuts.

The 2010 Cancún agreements include voluntary pledges made by 76 developed and developing countries to control their emissions of greenhouse gases. In 2010, these 76 countries were collectively responsible for 85% of annual global emissions.

By May 2012, the US, Japan, Russia, and Canada had indicated they would not sign up to a second Kyoto commitment period. In November 2012, Australia confirmed it would participate in a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol and New Zealand confirmed that it would not.

New Zealand&#x27;s climate minister Tim Groser said the 15-year-old Kyoto Protocol was outdated, and that New Zealand was &quot;ahead of the curve&quot; in looking for a replacement that would include developing nations. Non-profit environmental organisations such as the World Wildlife Fund criticised New Zealand&#x27;s decision to pull out.

On 8 December 2012, at the end of the 2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference, an agreement was reached to extend the Protocol to 2020 and to set a date of 2015 for the development of a successor document, to be implemented from 2020 (see lede for more information). The outcome of the Doha talks has received a mixed response, with small island states critical of the overall package. The Kyoto second commitment period applies to about 11% of annual global emissions of greenhouse gases. Other results of the conference include a timetable for a global agreement to be adopted by 2015 which includes all countries. At the Doha meeting of the parties to the UNFCCC on 8 December 2012, the European Union chief climate negotiator, Artur Runge-Metzger, pledged to extend the treaty, binding on the 27 European Member States, up to the year 2020 pending an internal ratification procedure.

Ban Ki Moon, Secretary General of the United Nations, called on world leaders to come to an agreement on halting global warming during the 69th Session of the UN General Assembly on 23 September 2014 in New York. The next climate summit was held in Paris in 2015, out of which emerged the Paris Agreement, the successor to the Kyoto Protocol.

<text>The Kaddish (, &#x27;holy&#x27; or &#x27;sanctification&#x27;), also transliterated as Qaddish, is a hymn praising God that is recited during Jewish prayer services. The central theme of the Kaddish is the magnification and sanctification of God&#x27;s name. In the liturgy, different versions of the Kaddish are functionally chanted or sung as separators of the different sections of the service.

The term &quot;Kaddish&quot; is often used to refer specifically to the Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish, which is chanted as part of the mourning rituals in Judaism in all prayer services, as well as at funerals (other than at the gravesite) and memorials; for 11 Hebrew months after the death of a parent; and in some communities for 30 days after the death of a spouse, sibling, or child. A person is described as &quot;saying Kaddish&quot; if they are carrying out these rituals of mourning. Mourners recite Kaddish to show that despite the loss they still praise God.

Along with the Shema Yisrael and the Amidah, the Kaddish is one of the most important and central elements in the Jewish liturgy. Kaddish is traditionally only recited with a minyan - a quorum of ten adult Jews.

== Variant forms ==

The various versions of the Kaddish are as follows. Each one generally has a descriptive name and an alternative name which points to a word which appears in that version of Kaddish.

* &quot;Chatzi Kaddish&quot; (חֲצִי קַדִּישׁ &#x27;Half Kaddish&#x27;), &quot;Kaddish L&#x27;eila&quot; (קַדִּישׁ לְעֵלָּא), or &quot;Reader&#x27;s Kaddish&quot;. This is used as a divider to punctuate between different sections of prayer, such as between &quot;Pesukei dezimra&quot; and the &quot;Barechu&quot; in the morning prayer, and before the &quot;Amidah&quot; in the afternoon and evening prayers.
* &quot;Kaddish Yatom&quot; (קַדִּישׁ יָתוֹם &#x27;Orphan&#x27;s Kaddish&#x27;) or &quot;Kaddish Yehe Shlama Rabba&quot; (קַדִּישׁ יְהֵא שְׁלָמָא רַבָּא), commonly referred to as , the &#x27;Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish&#x27;. Recited by a mourner at the end of a prayer service and after a memorial prayer.
* &quot;Kaddish Shalem&quot; (קַדִּישׁ שָׁלֵם &#x27;Complete Kaddish&#x27;) or &quot;Kaddish Titkabbal&quot; (קַדִּישׁ תִּתְקַבֵּל). Originally used to mark the end of a service, although in later times extra passages and hymns were added to follow it.
* &quot;Kaddish Derabbanan&quot; (קַדִּישׁ דְּרַבָּנַן &#x27;Kaddish of the Rabbis&#x27;) or &quot;Qaddish ʿal Yisraʾel&quot; (קַדִּישׁ עַל יִשְׂרָאֵל). This used after any part of the service that includes extracts from the Mishnah or the Talmud, as its original purpose was to close a study session.
* &quot;Kaddish achar Hakevura&quot; (קַדִּישׁ אַחַר הַקְּבוּרָה &#x27;Kaddish after the Burial&#x27;), also called &quot;Kaddish de&#x27;itchadata&quot; (קַדִּישׁ דְּאִתְחַדְתָּא), recited during a funeral. It is also said at a &quot;siyum&quot; following the completion of a tractate of the Talmud, where it is referred to as &quot;Kaddish achar Hashlamat Masechet&quot; (קַדִּישׁ אַחַר הַשְׁלָמַת מַסֶּכֶת &#x27;Kaddish after the completion of a tractate&#x27;). As this version is the longest form of Kaddish it is also referred to as &quot;Kaddish Hagadol&quot; (קַדִּישׁ הַגָּדוֹל &#x27;the Great Kaddish&#x27;).

All versions of the Kaddish begin with the text of the &quot;Chatzi Kaddish&quot; (in the case of the Great Kaddish, with an extra passage inserted). The other versions contain additional paragraphs, and are often named after distinctive words in those paragraphs.

Historically there existed another type of Kaddish, called &quot;Kaddish Yachid&quot; (&quot;Individual&#x27;s Kaddish&quot;). This is included in the &quot;Siddur of Amram Gaon&quot;, but is a meditation taking the place of Kaddish rather than a Kaddish in the normal sense. It had not been recited in modern times until the COVID-19 pandemic, which made coming together to form a minyan difficult. Some communities began reciting the &quot;Kaddish Yachid&quot;, or a portion thereof, in lieu of the Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish.

== Text ==

The following includes the Half, Complete, Mourner&#x27;s and Rabbis&#x27; Kaddish. The variant lines of the Great Kaddish are given below, as well as variants used by some Jewish communities.

=== Text of the burial kaddish ===

In the burial kaddish, and that after a siyum according to Ashkenazim,i, lines 2-3 are replaced by:

=== Recent changes to Oseh Shalom ===

In some recent non-Orthodox prayerbooks, for example, the American Reform Machzor, line 36 is replaced with:

This effort to extend the reach of Oseh Shalom to non-Jews is said to have been started by the British Liberal Jewish movement in 1967, with the introduction of &quot;v&#x27;al kol bnei Adam&quot; (&quot;and upon all humans&quot;); these words continue to be used by some in the UK.

=== Notes ===

* Bracketed text varies according to personal or communal traditions.
* (A) The congregation responds with &quot;amen&quot; (אָמֵן) after lines 1, 4, 7, 12, 15, 18, 27, 33, 36. In the Ashkenazi tradition, the response to line 12 is &quot;Blessed be he&quot; (בְּרִיךְ הוּא &quot;b&#x27;rikh hu&quot;), and in some communities the congregation says &quot;Blessed be He&quot; before the chazzan says it, rendering the next phrase &quot;brikh hu le&#x27;eilah&quot; (Blessed be He above) (see Darke Moshe OC 56:3).
* (B) On line 1, some say &quot;Yitgaddeyl veyitqaddeysh&quot; rather than &quot;Yitgaddal veyitqaddash&quot;, because the roots of these two words are Hebrew and not Aramaic (the Aramaic equivalent would be &quot;Yitrabay veyitkadash&quot;), some authorities (but not others) felt that both words should be rendered in pure Hebrew pronunciation. 
* (C) Line 13: in the Ashkenazi tradition the repeated &quot;le&#x27;ela&quot; is used only during the Ten Days of Repentance, or on the High Holiday themselves in the German tradition. In the Sephardi tradition it is never used. In the Yemenite and Italian traditions it is the invariable wording. The phrase &quot;le&#x27;ela le&#x27;ela&quot; is the Aramaic translation in Targum Onkelos of the Hebrew phrase &quot;ma&#x27;la ma&#x27;la&quot; (Deuteronomy 28:43). 
* (D) Lines 4 and 30–32 are not present in the Ashkenazi or Italian tradition. &quot;Revaḥ vehatzala&quot; is said aloud by the congregation.
* (E) Line 26: some Sephardi Jews say &quot;malka&quot; [or &quot;maram&quot; or &quot;mareh&quot;] &quot;di-shmaya ve-ar&#x27;a&quot; (the King [or Master] of Heaven and Earth) instead of &quot;avuhon de-vi-shmaya&quot; (their Father in Heaven); De Sola Pool uses &quot;mara&quot;; the London Spanish and Portuguese Jews use the same text as the Ashkenazim. 
* (F) During the &quot;complete kaddish&quot; some include the following congregational responses, which are not regarded as part of the text:
** Before line 16, &quot;accept our prayer with mercy and favour&quot;
** Before line 28, &quot;May the name of God be blessed, from now and forever&quot;
** Before line 34, &quot;My help is from God, creator of heaven and earth&quot;
* (G) Line 35: &quot;b&#x27;rahamav&quot; is used by Sephardim in all versions of kaddish; by some Ashkenazim only in &quot;Kaddish deRabbanan&quot; and by others never.
* (H) Line 36: &quot;ammo&quot; is used by most Sephardim, but not by some of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews or Ashkenazim. 
* (I) Lines 37 to 45: these lines are also recited by Yemenite Jews as part of every Kaddish DeRabbanan. 
* (Z) In line 22, the bracketed word is added in many communities in the Land of Israel.
* In line 1, as noted in (a), the congregation responds &quot;Amen&quot;, even though this commonly is not printed in most prayerbooks. This longstanding and widespread tradition introduces a break in the verse which leads to varying opinions regarding whether the phrase &quot;according to His will&quot; applies to &quot;which he created&quot; or to &quot;Magnified and sanctified&quot;.
* It is common that the entire congregation recites lines 8 and 9 with the leader, and it is also common that the congregation will include in its collective recitation the first word of the next line (line 10), &quot;Yitbarakh&quot;. This is commonly thought to be done to prevent any interruption before the next line (which begins with &quot;Yitbarakh&quot;) is recited by the leader. But this inclusion of &quot;Yitbarakh&quot; is subject to a major dispute among the Rishonim (medieval authorities). Maimonides and the Tur did not include it in the congregation&#x27;s recitation; Amram Gaon, the Vilna Gaon, and the Shulchan Aruch include it. In some communities, the congregation recites in an undertone through and including the words &quot;da&#x27;amiran beʻalma&quot; (middle of line 15).

== Analysis of the text ==

The opening words of the Kaddish are inspired by the vision in Ezekiel 38:23 of God becoming great in the eyes of all the nations.

The central line of the Kaddish is the congregation&#x27;s response: (&quot;Yehei shmeih rabba mevarakh lealam ulealemai alemaya&quot;, &quot;May His great name be blessed for ever, and to all eternity&quot;), a public declaration of God&#x27;s greatness and eternality. This response is similar to the wording of Daniel 2:20. It is also parallel to the Hebrew &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Blessed be the name is His glorious kingdom forever and ever]], which is commonly recited after the first verse of the Shema. Aramaic versions of both wordings appear in the various versions of Targum Pseudo-Jonathan to Genesis 49:2 and Deuteronomy 6:4.

The Mourner&#x27;s, Rabbis&#x27; and Complete Kaddish end with a supplication for peace (&quot;Oseh Shalom...&quot;), which is in Hebrew, and is somewhat similar to the Tanakh Job 25:2.

Kaddish does not contain God&#x27;s name. It is said that this is because the first section of Kaddish has 26 words, equalling the &quot;gematria&quot; (numerological value) of the Tetragrammaton, and the Kaddish text proves that from the very beginning with words &quot;May His great name be exalted and sanctified&quot;.

== Customs ==

Kaddish may be spoken or chanted. In services on certain special occasions, it may be sung to special melodies. There are different melodies in different Jewish traditions, and within each tradition the melody can change according to the version, the day it is said and even the position in the service. Many mourners recite Kaddish slowly and contemplatively.

In Sephardi synagogues the whole congregation sits for Kaddish, except:

* During the Half Kaddish immediately before the Amidah, where everyone stands;
* During the Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish, where those reciting it stand and everyone else sits.

In Ashkenazi synagogues, the custom varies. Very commonly, in both Orthodox and Reform congregations, everyone stands for the Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish; but in some (especially many Conservative and Sephardic) synagogues, most of the congregants sit. Sometimes, a distinction is made between the different forms of Kaddish, or each congregant stands or sits according to his or her own custom. The Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish is often treated differently from the other variations of Kaddish in the service, as is the Half Kaddish after a morning Torah reading.

Those standing to recite Kaddish bow, by widespread tradition, at various places. This generally includes the first word of the prayer, at each &quot;Amen&quot;, at &quot;Yitbarakh&quot;, at &quot;Brikh hu&quot;, and for the last verse &quot;Oseh shalom&quot;. For &quot;Oseh shalom&quot; it is customary to take three steps back then bow to one&#x27;s left, then to one&#x27;s right, and finally bow forward, as if taking leave of the presence of a king, in the same way as when the same words are used as the concluding line of the Amidah.

According to the original Ashkenazic custom, as well as the Yemenite custom, one mourner recites each Kaddish, and the Halachic authorities set down extensive rules to determine who has priority for each kaddish. Most (but not all) Ashkenazic communities have adopted the Sephardic custom to allow multiple mourners to recite Kaddish together.

=== Minyan requirement ===

&quot;Masekhet Soferim&quot;, an eighth-century compilation of Jewish laws regarding the preparation of holy books and public reading, states in 10:7 that Kaddish may be recited only in the presence of a minyan - a quorum of ten. The traditional view is that &quot;If &quot;kaddish&quot; is said in private, then by definition it is not &quot;kaddish&quot;,&quot;. 
However some alternatives have been suggested, including the &quot;Kaddish l&#x27;yachid&quot; &quot;Kaddish for an individual&quot;, attributed to the ninth-century Amram Gaon, and the use of kavanah prayer, asking heavenly beings to join with the individual &quot;to make a minyan of both Earth and heaven&quot;. In some Reform congregations, a minyan is not required for recitation of the Kaddish, but other Reform congregations disagree and believe that the Kaddish should be said publicly.

== History and background ==

David de Silva Pool describes the origin of Kaddish as &quot;a closing doxology to an Aggadic discourse.&quot; Most of it is written in Aramaic which, at the time of its original composition, was the lingua franca of the Jewish people. It is not composed in the vernacular Aramaic, however, but rather in a &quot;literary, jargon Aramaic&quot; that was used in the academies, and is identical to the dialect of the Targumim.

Professor , however, argues that the Kaddish was originally written in Hebrew, and later translated to Aramaic to be better understood by the masses. He notes that quotations from the Kaddish in the Talmud and Sifrei are in Hebrew, and that even today some of the words are Hebrew rather than Aramaic.

The oldest version of the Kaddish is found in the &quot;Siddur of Rab Amram Gaon&quot;, c. 900. &quot;The first mention of mourners reciting Kaddish at the end of the service is in a thirteenth century halakhic writing called the Or Zarua. The Kaddish at the end of the service became designated as Kaddish Yatom or Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish (literally, &quot;Orphan&#x27;s Kaddish&quot;).&quot;

The Kaddish was not always recited by mourners and instead became a prayer for mourners sometime between the 12th and 13th centuries when it started to be associated with a medieval legend about Rabbi Akiva who meets a dead man seeking redemption in the afterlife.

=== Hebrew reconstruction ===

Elitzur made an attempt at reconstructing the theorized original Hebrew version of Kaddish:

: יִתְגַּדֵּל וְיִתְקַדֵּשׁ שְׁמוֹ הַגָּדוֹל
: בָּעוֹלָם שֶׁבָּרָא כִּרְצוֹנוֹ
: וְתִמלוֹךְ מַלְכוּתוֹ בְּחַיֵּיכֶם וּבִימֵיכֶם וּבְחַיֵּיהֶם שֶׁל כֹּל בֵּית יִשְׂרָאֵל בִּמְהֵרָה וּבִזְמַן קָרוֹב
: יְהִי שְׁמוֹ הַגָּדוֹל מְבוֹרָךְ לְעוֹלָם וּלְעוֹלְמֵי עוֹלָמִים

==Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish==

Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish is said in most communities at all prayer services and certain other occasions. It is written in Aramaic. It is traditionally recited several times, most prominently at or towards the end of the service, after the Aleinu, closing Psalms or, on the Sabbath, following the &quot;Anim Zemirot&quot; hymn. In most communities, Kaddish is recited during the eleven months after the death of a parent, and then at every anniversary of the death (the Yahrzeit). Technically, there is no obligation to recite Kaddish for other relatives, even though there is an obligation to mourn for them.

Customs for reciting the Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish vary markedly among various communities. In Sephardi synagogues, the custom is that all the mourners stand and chant the Kaddish together. In Ashkenazi synagogues before the 19th century, one mourner was chosen to lead the prayer on behalf of the rest, but gradually over the last two centuries, most (but certainly not all) communities have adopted the Sephardi custom. In many Reform synagogues, the entire congregation recites the Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish together. This is sometimes said to be for those victims of the Holocaust who have no one left to recite the Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish on their behalf and in support of the mourners. In some congregations (especially Reform and Conservative ones), the Rabbi reads a list of the deceased who have a Yahrzeit on that day (or who have died within the past month), and then ask the congregants to name any people they are mourning for. Some synagogues, especially Orthodox and Conservative ones, multiply the number of times that the Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish is recited, for example by reciting a separate Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish after both Aleinu and then each closing Psalm. Other synagogues limit themselves to one Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish at the end of the service. And still in other communities where they preserve the original custom to only allow one person to recite each Kaddish, the number of Kaddishim recited depends on how many mourners are present.

Notably, the Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish does not mention death at all, but instead praises God. Though the Kaddish is often popularly referred to as the &quot;Jewish Prayer for the Dead,&quot; that designation more accurately belongs to the prayer called &quot;El Malei Rachamim&quot;, which specifically prays for the soul of the deceased. The Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish can be more accurately represented as an expression of &quot;justification for judgment&quot; by the mourners on their loved ones&#x27; behalf. It is believed that mourners adopted this version of the Kaddish around the 13th century during harsh persecution of Jews by crusaders in Germany because of the opening messianic line about God bringing the dead back to life, although this line is no longer said in the Ashkenazi rite.

=== Women and the Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish ===
There is evidence of some women saying the Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish for their parents at the grave, during shiva, and in daily prayers since the 17th century. Rabbi Yair Bacharach concluded that technically a woman can recite the Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish, but since this is not the common practice, it should be discouraged. As such, women reciting kaddish is controversial in some Orthodox communities, and it is almost unheard of in Haredi communities. Nevertheless, Rabbi Aharon Soloveichik ruled that in our time, we should permit women to say Kaddish, and this is a common (but not universal) practice in Modern Orthodox circles. In 2013, the Israeli Orthodox rabbinical organization Beit Hillel issued a halachic ruling that women may say the Kaddish in memory of their deceased parents (in presence of a male minyan). In Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist Judaism, the Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish is traditionally said by women who are there also counted in the minyan.

<doc id="16777" wikidata="Q130924" url="?curid=16777" title="Kalevala">
<text>The Kalevala () is a 19th-century compilation of epic poetry, compiled by Elias Lönnrot from Karelian and Finnish oral folklore and mythology, telling a story about the Creation of the Earth, describing the controversies and retaliatory voyages between the peoples of the land of Kalevala called Väinölä and the land of Pohjola and their various protagonists and antagonists, as well as the construction and robbery of the mythical wealth-making machine Sampo.

The &quot;Kalevala&quot; is regarded as the national epic of Karelia and Finland, and is one of the most significant works of Finnish literature along with J. L. Runeberg&#x27;s &quot;The Tales of Ensign Stål&quot; and Aleksis Kivi&#x27;s &quot;The Seven Brothers&quot;. The &quot;Kalevala&quot; was instrumental in the development of the Finnish national identity and the intensification of Finland&#x27;s language strife that ultimately led to Finland&#x27;s independence from Russia in 1917. The work is known internationally and has partly influenced, for example, J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium (i.e. Middle-earth mythology, especially &quot;The Children of Húrin&quot;).

The first version of the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, called the &quot;Old Kalevala&quot;, was published in 1835, consisting of 12,078 verses. The version most commonly known today was first published in 1849 and consists of 22,795 verses, divided into fifty folk stories (). An abridged version, containing all fifty poems but just 9,732 verses, was published in 1862. In connection with the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, there is another much more lyrical collection of poems, also compiled by Lönnrot, called &quot;Kanteletar&quot; from 1840, which is mostly seen as a &quot;sister collection&quot; of the &quot;Kalevala&quot;.

==Collection and compilation==

===Elias Lönnrot===

Elias Lönnrot (9 April 1802 – 19 March 1884) was a physician, botanist, linguist, and poet. At the time he was compiling the &quot;Kalevala&quot; he was the district health officer based in Kajaani responsible for the whole Kainuu region in the eastern part of what was then the Grand Duchy of Finland. He was the son of Fredrik Johan Lönnrot, a tailor, and Ulrika Lönnrot; he was born in the village of Sammatti, Uusimaa.

At the age of 21, he entered the Imperial Academy of Turku and obtained a master&#x27;s degree in 1826. His thesis was entitled &quot;De Vainamoine priscorum fennorum numine&quot; (&quot;Väinämöinen, a Divinity of the Ancient Finns&quot;). The monograph&#x27;s second volume was destroyed in the Great Fire of Turku the same year.

In the spring of 1828, he set out with the aim of collecting folk songs and poetry. Rather than continue this work, though, he decided to complete his studies and entered Imperial Alexander University in Helsinki to study medicine. He earned a master&#x27;s degree in 1832. In January 1833, he started as the district health officer of Kainuu and began his work on collecting poetry and compiling the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. Throughout his career Lönnrot made a total of eleven field trips within a period of fifteen years.

Prior to the publication of the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, Elias Lönnrot compiled several related works, including the three-part &quot;Kantele&quot; (1829–1831), the &quot;Old Kalevala&quot; (1835) and the &quot;Kanteletar&quot; (1840).

Lönnrot&#x27;s field trips and endeavours helped him to compile the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, and brought considerable enjoyment to the people he visited; he would spend much time retelling what he had collected as well as learning new poems.

===Poetry===
====History====
Before the 18th century, &quot;Kalevala&quot; poetry, also known as runic song, was common throughout Finland and Karelia, but in the 18th century it began to disappear in Finland, first in western Finland, because European rhymed poetry became more common in Finland. Finnish folk poetry was first written down in the 17th century and collected by hobbyists and scholars through the following centuries. Despite this, the majority of Finnish poetry remained only in the oral tradition.

Finnish-born nationalist and linguist Carl Axel Gottlund (1796–1875) expressed his desire for a Finnish epic in a similar vein to the &quot;Iliad&quot;, &quot;Ossian&quot; and the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; compiled from the various poems and songs spread over most of Finland. He hoped that such an endeavour would incite a sense of nationality and independence in the native Finnish people. In 1820, founded the journal &quot;Turun Wiikko-Sanomat&quot; (Turku Weekly News) and published three articles entitled &quot;Väinämöisestä&quot; (&quot;Concerning Väinämöinen&quot;). These works were an inspiration for Elias Lönnrot in creating his masters thesis at Turku University.

In the 19th century, collecting became more extensive, systematic and organised. Altogether, almost half a million pages of verse have been collected and archived by the Finnish Literature Society and other collectors in what are now Estonia and Russia&#x27;s Republic of Karelia. The publication &quot;Suomen Kansan Vanhat Runot&quot; (&quot;Ancient Poems of the Finns&quot;) published 33 volumes containing 85,000 items of poetry over a period of 40 years. They have archived 65,000 items of poetry that remain unpublished. By the end of the 19th century this pastime of collecting material relating to Karelia and the developing orientation towards eastern lands had become a fashion called Karelianism, a form of national romanticism.

The chronology of this oral tradition is uncertain. The oldest themes, the origin of Earth, have been interpreted to have their roots in distant, unrecorded history and could be as old as 3,000 years.
The newest events, e.g. the arrival of Christianity, seem to be from the Iron Age, which in Finland lasted until c. 1300 CE. Finnish folklorist Kaarle Krohn proposes that 20 of the 45 poems of the &quot;Kalevala&quot; are of possible Ancient Estonian origin or at least deal with a motif of Estonian origin (of the remainder, two are Ingrian and 23 are Western Finnish).

It is understood that during the Finnish reformation in the 16th century the clergy forbade all telling and singing of pagan rites and stories. In conjunction with the arrival of European poetry and music this caused a significant reduction in the number of traditional folk songs and their singers. Thus the tradition faded somewhat but was never totally eradicated.

====Lönnrot&#x27;s field trips====
In total, Lönnrot made eleven field trips in search of poetry. His first trip was made in 1828 after his graduation from Turku University, but it was not until 1831 and his second field trip that the real work began. By that time he had already published three articles entitled &quot;Kantele&quot; and had significant notes to build upon. This second trip was not very successful and he was called back to Helsinki to attend to victims of the Second cholera pandemic.

The third field trip was much more successful and led Elias Lönnrot to Viena in east Karelia where he visited the town of Akonlahti, which proved most successful. This trip yielded over 3,000 verses and copious notes. In 1833, Lönnrot moved to Kajaani where he was to spend the next 20 years as the district health officer for the region, living in the Hövelö croft located near the Lake Oulujärvi in the Paltaniemi village, spending his spare time searching for poems. His fourth field trip was undertaken in conjunction with his work as a doctor; a 10-day jaunt into Viena. This trip resulted in 49 poems and almost 3,000 new lines of verse. It was during this trip that Lönnrot formulated the idea that the poems might represent a wider continuity, when poem entities were performed to him along with comments in normal speech connecting them.

On the fifth field trip, Lönnrot met Arhippa Perttunen who, over two days of continuous recitation, provided him with some 4,000 verses for the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. He also met a singer called Matiska in the hamlet of Lonkka on the Russian side of the border. Although this singer had a somewhat poor memory, he did help to fill in many gaps in the work Lönnrot had already catalogued. This trip resulted in the discovery of almost 300 poems at just over 13,000 verses.

In the autumn of 1834, Lönnrot had written the vast majority of the work needed for what was to become the &quot;Old Kalevala&quot;; all that was required was to tie up some narrative loose ends and complete the work. His sixth field trip took him into Kuhmo, a municipality in Kainuu to the south of Viena. There he collected over 4,000 verses and completed the first draft of his work. He wrote the foreword and published in February of the following year.

With the &quot;Old Kalevala&quot; well into its first publication run, Lönnrot decided to continue collecting poems to supplement his existing work and to understand the culture more completely. The seventh field trip took him on a long winding path through the southern and eastern parts of the Viena poem singing region. He was delayed significantly in Kuhmo because of bad skiing conditions. By the end of that trip, Lönnrot had collected another 100 poems consisting of over 4,000 verses. Lönnrot made his eighth field trip to the Russian border town of Lapukka where the great singer Arhippa Perttunen had learned his trade. In correspondence he notes that he has written down many new poems but is unclear on the quantity.

Elias Lönnrot departed on the first part of his ninth field trip on 16 September 1836. He was granted a 14-month leave of absence and a sum of travelling expenses from the Finnish Literary Society. His funds came with some stipulations: he must travel around the Kainuu border regions and then on to the north and finally from Kainuu to the south-east along the border. For the expedition into the north he was accompanied by Juhana Fredrik Cajan. The first part of the trip took Lönnrot all the way to Inari in northern Lapland. The second, southern part of the journey was more successful than the northern part, taking Lönnrot to the town of Sortavala on Lake Ladoga then back up through Savo and eventually back to Kajaani. Although these trips were long and arduous, they resulted in very little Kalevala material; only 1,000 verses were recovered from the southern half and an unknown quantity from the northern half.

The tenth field trip is a relative unknown. What is known however, is that Lönnrot intended to gather poems and songs to compile into the upcoming work &quot;Kanteletar&quot;. He was accompanied by his friend C. H. Ståhlberg for the majority of the trip. During that journey the pair met Mateli Magdalena Kuivalatar in the small border town of Ilomantsi. Kuivalatar was very important to the development of the &quot;Kanteletar&quot;. The eleventh documented field trip was another undertaken in conjunction with his medical work. During the first part of the trip, Lönnrot returned to Akonlahti in Russian Karelia, where he gathered 80 poems and a total of 800 verses. The rest of the trip suffers from poor documentation.

====Methodology====
Lönnrot and his contemporaries, e.g. Matthias Castrén, Anders Johan Sjögren,
and David Emmanuel Daniel Europaeus collected most of the poem variants; one poem could easily have countless variants, scattered across rural areas of Karelia and Ingria. Lönnrot was not really interested in, and rarely wrote down the name of the singer except for some of the more prolific cases. His primary purpose in the region was that of a physician and of an editor, not of a biographer or counsellor. He rarely knew anything in-depth about the singer himself and primarily only catalogued verse that could be relevant or of some use in his work.

The student David Emmanuel Daniel Europaeus is credited with discovering and cataloguing the majority of the Kullervo story.

Of the dozens of poem singers who contributed to the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, significant ones are:
* Arhippa Perttunen (1769–1840)
* Juhana Kainulainen
* Matiska
* Ontrei Malinen (1780–1855)
* Vaassila Kieleväinen
* Soava Trohkimainen

====Form and structure====
The poetry was often sung to music built on a pentachord, sometimes assisted by a kantele player. The rhythm could vary but the music was arranged in either two or four lines in  metre. The poems were often performed by a duo, each person singing alternative verses or groups of verses. This method of performance is called an antiphonic performance, it is a kind of &quot;singing match&quot;.

====Metre====
Despite the vast geographical distance and customary spheres separating individual singers, the folk poetry the &quot;Kalevala&quot; is based on was always sung in the same metre.

The &quot;Kalevala&quot;″s metre is a form of trochaic tetrameter that is now known as the &quot;Kalevala metre&quot;. The metre is thought to have originated during the Proto-Finnic period. Its syllables fall into three types: strong, weak, and neutral. Its main rules are as follows:
* A long syllable (one that contains a long vowel or a diphthong, or ends in a consonant) with a main stress is metrically strong.
:In the second, third, and fourth foot of a line, a strong syllable can occur in only the rising part:
:: (1:11)
:: (&quot;Dearest friend, and much-loved brother&quot;)
:The first foot has a freer structure, allowing strong syllables in a falling position as well as a rising one:
:: (1:37)
:: (&quot;These my father sang aforetime&quot;)
* A short syllable with a main stress is metrically weak.
:In the second, third, and fourth feet, a weak syllable can occur only in the falling part:
:: (1:1)
:: (&quot;I am driven by my longing&quot;)
:Again, the first foot&#x27;s structure is more free, allowing weak syllables in a rising position as well as a falling one:
:: (1:56)
:: (&quot;Others taken from the saplings&quot;)
* All syllables without a main stress are metrically neutral. Neutral syllables can occur at any position.

There are two main types of line:
* A normal tetrameter, word-stresses and foot-stresses match, and there is a caesura between the second and third feet:
* A broken tetrameter (Finnish: &quot;murrelmasäe&quot;) has at least one stressed syllable in a falling position. There is usually no caesura:
Traditional poetry in the Kalevala metre uses both types with approximately the same frequency. The alternating normal and broken tetrameters is a characteristic difference between the Kalevala metre and other forms of trochaic tetrameter.

There are four additional rules:
* In the first foot, the length of syllables is free. It is also possible for the first foot to contain three or even four syllables.
* A one-syllable word can not occur at the end of a line.
* A word with four syllables should not stand in the middle of a line. This also applies to non-compound words.
* The last syllable of a line may not include a long vowel.

====Schemes====
There are two main schemes featured in the &quot;Kalevala&quot;:
* Alliteration
:Alliteration can be broken into two forms. Weak: where only the opening consonant is the same, and strong: where both the first vowel or vowel and consonant are the same in the different words. (e.g. ).
* Parallelism
:Parallelism in &quot;The Kalevala&quot; refers to the stylistic feature of repeating the idea presented in the previous line, often by using synonyms, rather than moving the plot forward. (e.g. ). Lönnrot has been criticised for overusing parallelism in &quot;The Kalevala&quot;: in the original poems, a line was usually followed by only one such parallel line.

The verses are sometimes inverted into chiasmus.

====Poetry example====
Verses 221 to 232 of song forty.
===Lönnrot&#x27;s contribution to the &quot;Kalevala&quot;===
Very little is actually known about Elias Lönnrot&#x27;s personal contributions to the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. Scholars to this day still argue about how much of the &quot;Kalevala&quot; is genuine folk poetry and how much is Lönnrot&#x27;s own work – and the degree to which the text is &#x27;authentic&#x27; to the oral tradition. During the compilation process it is known that he merged poem variants and characters together, left out verses that did not fit and composed lines of his own to connect certain passages into a logical plot. Similarly, as was normal in the preliterate conventions of oral poetry—according to the testimony of Arhippa Perttunen—traditional bards in his father&#x27;s days would always vary the language of songs from performance to performance when reciting from their repertoire.

The Finnish historian Väinö Kaukonen suggests that 3% of the lines are Lönnrot&#x27;s own composition, 14% are Lönnrot compositions from variants, 50% are verses which Lönnrot kept mostly unchanged except for some minor alterations, and 33% are original unedited oral poetry.

== Publishing ==

=== Finnish language ===

The first version of Lönnrot&#x27;s compilation was entitled &quot;Kalewala, taikka Wanhoja Karjalan Runoja Suomen Kansan muinoisista ajoista&quot; (&quot;The Kalevala, or old Karelian poems about ancient times of the Finnish people&quot;), also known as the &quot;Old Kalevala&quot;. It was published in two volumes in 1835–1836. The &quot;Old Kalevala&quot; consisted of 12,078 verses making up a total of thirty-two poems.

Even after the publication of the &quot;Old Kalevala&quot; Lönnrot continued to collect new material for several years. He later integrated this additional material, with significantly edited existing material, into a second version, the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. This &quot;New Kalevala&quot;, published in 1849, contains fifty poems, with a number of plot differences compared with the first version, and is the standard text of the &quot;Kalevala&quot; read and translated to this day. (Published as: Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seuran Toimituksia. 14 Osa. KALEVALA.)

The word &quot;Kalevala&quot; rarely appears in the original folk songs. The first appearance of the word in folk songs was recorded in April 1836. Lönnrot chose it as the title for his project sometime at the end of 1834, but his choice was not random. The name &quot;Kalev&quot; appears in Finnic and Baltic folklore in many locations, and the &quot;Sons of Kalev&quot; are known throughout Finnish and Estonian folklore.

Lönnrot produced &quot;Lyhennetty laitos&quot;, an abridged version of the Kalevala, in 1862. It was intended for use in schools. It retains all 50 poems from the 1849 version, but omits more than half of the verses.

=== Translations ===
Of the few complete translations into English, it is only the older translations by John Martin Crawford (1888) and William Forsell Kirby (1907) which attempt to strictly follow the original (Kalevala metre) of the poems.

A notable partial translation of Franz Anton Schiefner&#x27;s German translation was made by Prof. John Addison Porter in 1868 and published by Leypoldt &amp; Holt.

Edward Taylor Fletcher, a British-born Canadian literature enthusiast, translated selections of the &quot;Kalevala&quot; in 1869. He read them before the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec on 17 March 1869.

Francis Peabody Magoun published a scholarly translation of the &quot;Kalevala&quot; in 1963 written entirely in prose. The appendices of this version contain notes on the history of the poem, comparisons between the original &quot;Old Kalevala&quot; and the current version, and a detailed glossary of terms and names used in the poem. Magoun translated the &quot;Old Kalevala&quot;, which was published six years later entitled &quot;The Old Kalevala and Certain Antecedents&quot;.

Eino Friberg&#x27;s 1988 translation uses the original metre selectively but in general is more attuned to pleasing the ear than being an exact metrical translation; it also often reduces the length of songs for aesthetic reasons. In the introduction to his 1989 translation, Keith Bosley stated: &quot;The only way I could devise of reflecting the vitality of Kalevala metre was to invent my own, based on syllables rather than feet. While translating over 17,000 lines of Finnish folk poetry before I started on the epic, I found that a line settled usually into seven syllables of English, often less, occasionally more. I eventually arrived at seven, five and nine syllables respectively, using the &quot;impair&quot; (odd number) as a formal device and letting the stresses fall where they would.&quot;

Most recently, Finnish/Canadian author and translator Kaarina Brooks translated into English the complete runic versions of &quot;Old Kalevala&quot; 1835 (Wisteria Publications 2020) and &quot;Kalevala&quot; (Wisteria Publications 2021). These works, unlike some previous versions, faithfully follow the Kalevala meter (Trochaic tetrameter) throughout and can be sung or chanted as Elias Lönnrot had intended. Brooks says, &quot;It is essential that the translation of Kalevala into any language follows the Kalevala metre, for that was how these runes were sung in times immemorial. So that readers get the full impact of these ancient runes, it is imperative that they be presented in the same chanting style.&quot; Kaarina Brooks is also the translator of, An Illustrated Kalevala Myths and Legends from Finland, published by Floris Books UK.

Modern translations were published in the Karelian and Urdu languages between 2009 and 2015. Thus, the &quot;Kalevala&quot; was published in its originating Karelian language only after 168 years since its first translation into Swedish.

As of 2010, the &quot;Kalevala&quot; had been translated into sixty-one languages and is Finland&#x27;s most translated work of literature.

==The story==
===Introduction===
The &quot;Kalevala&quot; begins with the traditional Finnish creation myth, leading into stories of the creation of the earth, plants, creatures, and the sky. Creation, healing, combat and internal story telling are often accomplished by the character(s) involved singing of their exploits or desires. Many parts of the stories involve a character hunting or requesting lyrics (prayers) to acquire some skill, such as boatbuilding or the mastery of iron making. As well as prayer casting and singing, there are many stories of lust, romance, kidnapping and seduction. The protagonists of the stories often have to accomplish feats that are unreasonable or impossible which they often fail to achieve, leading to tragedy and humiliation.

The Sampo is a pivotal element of the whole work. Many actions and their consequences are caused by the Sampo itself or a character&#x27;s interaction with the Sampo. It is described as a device that brings its possessor great fortune and prosperity, but its precise nature has been the subject of debate to the present day.

=== Cantos ===

====First Väinämöinen Cycle====

Cantos 1 to 2: The poem begins with an introduction by the singers. The Earth is created from the shards of the egg of a sotka bird, from which the first man, Väinämöinen, is born to Ilmatar, the Holy Spirit of the Heaven. Ilmatar forms the seas and the archipelagos and the lands, while Väinämöinen brings trees and life to the barren world.

Cantos 3–5: Väinämöinen encounters the jealous Joukahainen and they engage in a battle of song. Joukahainen loses and pledges his sister&#x27;s hand in return for his life; the sister Aino soon drowns herself in the sea.

Cantos 6–10: Väinämöinen heads to Pohjola to propose to a maiden of the north, a daughter of the mistress of the north Louhi. Joukahainen attacks Väinämöinen again, and Väinämöinen floats for days on the sea until he is carried by an eagle to Pohjola. He makes a deal with Louhi to get Ilmarinen the smith to create the Sampo. Ilmarinen refuses to go to Pohjola so Väinämöinen forces him against his will. The Sampo is forged. Ilmarinen returns without a bride.

====First Lemminkäinen Cycle====

Cantos 11–15: Lemminkäinen sets out in search of a bride. He and the maid Kyllikki make vows but the happiness doesn&#x27;t last long and Lemminkäinen sets off to woo a maiden of the north. His mother tries to stop him, but he disregards her warnings and instead gives her his hairbrush, telling her that if it starts to bleed he has met his doom. At Pohjola Louhi assigns dangerous tasks to him in exchange for her daughter&#x27;s hand. While hunting for the swan of Tuonela, Lemminkäinen is killed and falls into the river of death. The brush he gave to his mother begins to bleed. Remembering her son&#x27;s words, she goes in search of him. With a rake given to her by Ilmarinen, she collects the pieces of Lemminkäinen scattered in the river and pieces him back together.

====Second Väinämöinen Cycle====

Cantos 16–18: Väinämöinen builds a boat to travel to Pohjola once again in search of a bride. He visits Tuonela and is held prisoner, but he manages to escape and sets out to gain knowledge of the necessary spells from the giant Antero Vipunen. Väinämöinen is swallowed and has to torture Antero Vipunen for the spells and his escape. With his boat completed, Väinämöinen sets sail for Pohjola. Ilmarinen learns of this and resolves to go to Pohjola himself to woo the maiden. The maiden of the north chooses Ilmarinen.

====Ilmarinen&#x27;s Wedding====

Cantos 19–25: Ilmarinen is assigned dangerous unreasonable tasks to win the hand of the maiden. He accomplishes these tasks with some help from the maiden herself. In preparation for the wedding, beer is brewed, a giant steer is slaughtered, and invitations are sent out. Lemminkäinen is uninvited. The wedding party begins and all are happy. Väinämöinen sings and lauds the people of Pohjola. The bride and bridegroom are prepared for their roles in matrimony. The couple arrive home and are greeted with drink and viands.

====Second Lemminkäinen Cycle====

Cantos 26–30: Lemminkäinen is resentful for not having been invited to the wedding and sets out immediately for Pohjola. On his arrival he is challenged to and wins a duel with Sariola, the Master of the North. Louhi is enraged and an army is conjured to enact revenge upon Lemminkäinen. He flees to his mother, who advises him to head to Saari, the Island of Refuge. On his return he finds his house burned to the ground. He goes to Pohjola with his companion Tiera to exact his revenge, but Louhi freezes the seas and Lemminkäinen has to return home. When he arrives home he is reunited with his mother and vows to build larger better houses to replace the ones burned down.

====Kullervo Cycle====

Cantos 31–36: Untamo kills his brother Kalervo&#x27;s people, but spares his wife who later conceives Kullervo. Untamo sees the boy as a threat, and after trying to have him killed several times without success, sells Kullervo as a slave to Ilmarinen. Ilmarinen&#x27;s wife torments and bullies Kullervo, so he tricks her into being torn apart by a pack of wolves and bears. Kullervo escapes from Ilmarinen&#x27;s homestead and learns from an old lady in the forest that his family is still alive, and is soon reunited with them. While returning home from paying taxes, he meets and seduces a young maiden, only to find out that she is his sister. Upon realizing this, she kills herself and Kullervo returns home distressed. He decides to wreak revenge upon Untamo and sets out to find him. Kullervo wages war on Untamo and his people, laying all to waste, and then returns home, where he finds his farm deserted. Filled with remorse and regret, he kills himself in the place where he seduced his sister.

====Second Ilmarinen Cycle====

Cantos 37–38: Grieving for his lost love, Ilmarinen forges himself a wife out of gold and silver, but finds her to be cold and discards her. He heads for Pohjola and kidnaps the youngest daughter of Louhi. The daughter insults him so badly that he instead sings a spell to turn her into a bird and returns to Kalevala without her. He tells Väinämöinen about the prosperity and wealth that has met Pohjola&#x27;s people thanks to the Sampo.

====Theft of the Sampo====

Cantos 39–44: Väinämöinen, Ilmarinen and Lemminkäinen sail to Pohjola to recover the Sampo. While on their journey they kill a monstrous pike and from its jaw bone the first is made, with which Väinämöinen sings so beautifully even deities gather to listen. The heroes arrive in Pohjola and demand a share of the Sampo&#x27;s wealth or they will take the whole Sampo by force. Louhi musters her army; however, Väinämöinen lulls everyone in Pohjola to sleep with his music. The Sampo is taken from its vault of stone and the heroes set out for home. Louhi conjures a great army, turns herself into a massive eagle and fights for the Sampo. In the battle the Sampo is lost to the sea and destroyed.

====Louhi&#x27;s Revenge on Kalevala====

Cantos 45–49: Enraged at the loss of the Sampo, Louhi sends the people of Kalevala diseases and a great bear to kill their cattle. She hides the sun and the moon and steals fire from Kalevala. Väinämöinen heals all of the ailments and, with Ilmarinen, restores the fire. Väinämöinen forces Louhi to return the Sun and the Moon to the skies.

====Marjatta cycle====

Canto 50: The shy young virgin Marjatta becomes impregnated from a lingonberry she ate while tending to her flock. She conceives a son. Väinämöinen orders the killing of the boy, but the boy begins to speak and reproaches Väinämöinen for ill judgement. The child is then baptised King of Karelia. Väinämöinen sails away leaving only his songs and kantele as legacy but vowing to return when there&#x27;s no moon or sun and happiness isn&#x27;t free anymore.

The poem ends and the singers sing a farewell and thank their audience.

===Characters===

====Väinämöinen====

Väinämöinen, the central character of &quot;The Kalevala&quot;, is a shamanistic hero with a magical power of song and music similar to that of Orpheus. He is born of Ilmatar and contributes to the creation of Earth as it is today. Many of his travels resemble shamanistic journeys, most notably one where he visits the belly of a ground-giant, Antero Vipunen, to find the songs of boat building. Väinämöinen&#x27;s search for a wife is a central element in many stories, but he never finds one.

Väinämöinen is associated with playing a , a Finnish stringed instrument that resembles and is played like a zither.

====Ilmarinen====
Seppo Ilmarinen is a heroic artificer (comparable to the Germanic Weyland and the Greek Daedalus). He crafted the dome of the sky, the Sampo and various other magical devices featured in &quot;The Kalevala&quot;. Ilmarinen, like Väinämöinen, also has many stories told of his search for a wife, reaching the point where he forges one of gold.

====Lemminkäinen====

Lemminkäinen, a handsome, arrogant and reckless seducer, is the son of . He has a close relationship with his mother, who revives him after he has been drowned in the river of Tuonela while pursuing the object of his romantic desires.

====Ukko====
 is the god of sky and thunder, and the leading deity mentioned within &quot;The Kalevala&quot;. He corresponds to Thor and Zeus.

====Joukahainen====
Joukahainen is a base young man who arrogantly challenges Väinämöinen to a singing contest, which he loses. In exchange for his life Joukahainen promises his young sister Aino to Väinämöinen. Joukahainen attempts to gain his revenge on Väinämöinen by killing him with a crossbow, but only succeeds in killing Väinämöinen&#x27;s horse. Joukahainen&#x27;s actions lead to Väinämöinen promising to build a Sampo in return for Louhi rescuing him.

====Louhi====

Louhi, the Mistress of the North, is the shamanistic matriarch of the people of Pohjola, a people rivalling those of Kalevala. She is the cause of much trouble for Kalevala and its people.

Louhi at one point saves Väinämöinen&#x27;s life. She has many daughters whom the heroes of Kalevala make many attempts, some successful, to seduce. Louhi plays a major part in the battle to prevent the heroes of Kalevala from stealing back the Sampo, which as a result is ultimately destroyed. She is a powerful witch with a skill almost on a par with that of Väinämöinen.

====Kullervo====
Kullervo is the vengeful, mentally ill, tragic son of Kalervo. He was abused as a child and sold into slavery to Ilmarinen. He is put to work and treated badly by Ilmarinen&#x27;s wife, whom he later kills. Kullervo is a misguided and troubled youth, at odds with himself and his situation. He often goes into berserk rage, and in the end commits suicide.

====Marjatta====
Marjatta is a young virgin of Kalevala. She becomes pregnant from eating a lingonberry. When her labour begins she is expelled from her parents&#x27; home and leaves to find a place where she can sauna and give birth. She is turned away from numerous places but finally finds a place in the forest and gives birth to a son. Marjatta&#x27;s nature, impregnation and searching for a place to give birth are in allegory to the Virgin Mary and the Christianisation of Finland. Marjatta&#x27;s son is later condemned to death by Väinämöinen for being born out of wedlock. The boy in turn chastises Väinämöinen and is later crowned King of Karelia. This angers Väinämöinen, who leaves Kalevala after bequeathing his songs and kantele to the people as his legacy.

==Influence==
The &quot;Kalevala&quot; is a major part of Finnish culture and history. It has influenced the arts in Finland and in other cultures around the world. In 2024, the European Commission granted the epic with a European Heritage Label.

===Finnish daily life===
The influence of the &quot;Kalevala&quot; in daily life and business in Finland is tangible. Names and places associated with the &quot;Kalevala&quot; have been adopted as company and brand names and as place names.

There are several places within Finland with &quot;Kalevala&quot;-related names, for example: the district of Tapiola in the city of Espoo; the district of Pohjola in the city of Turku, the district of Metsola in the city of Vantaa, and the districts of Kaleva and Sampo in the city of Tampere; the historic provinces of Savo and Karjala and the Russian town of Hiitola are all mentioned within the songs of the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. In addition, the Russian town of Ukhta was in 1963 renamed Kalevala. In the United States a small community founded in 1900 by Finnish immigrants is named Kaleva, Michigan; many of the street names are taken from the &quot;Kalevala&quot;.

The banking sector of Finland has had at least three &quot;Kalevala&quot;-related brands: Sampo Bank (name changed to Danske Bank in late 2012), OP-Pohjola Group and Tapiola Bank.

The jewellery company Kalevala Koru was founded in 1935 on the 100th anniversary of the publication of the &quot;Old Kalevala&quot;. It specialises in the production of unique and culturally important items of jewellery. It is co-owned by the Kalevala Women&#x27;s League and offers artistic scholarships to a certain number of organisations and individuals every year.

The Finnish dairy company Valio has a brand of ice-cream named Aino, specialising in more exotic flavours than their normal brand.

The construction group Lemminkäinen was formed in 1910 as a roofing and asphalt company. The name was chosen specifically to emphasise that they were a wholly Finnish company. They now operate internationally.

====Finnish calendar====
Kalevala Day is celebrated in Finland on 28 February, to celebrate the publication date of Elias Lönnrot&#x27;s first version of the &quot;Kalevala&quot; in 1835. By its other official name, the day is known as the Finnish Culture Day.

Several of the names in the &quot;Kalevala&quot; are celebrated as Finnish name days. The name days themselves and the dates they fall upon have no direct relationship with the &quot;Kalevala&quot; itself; however, the adoption of the names became commonplace after the release of the &quot;Kalevala&quot;.

===Art===

Several artists have been influenced by the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, most notably Akseli Gallen-Kallela.

Iittala group&#x27;s Arabia brand kilned a series of &quot;Kalevala&quot; commemorative plates, designed by Raija Uosikkinen (1923–2004). The series ran from 1976 to 1999, and the plates are highly sought-after collectibles.

One of the earliest artists to depict the &quot;Kalevala&quot; was Robert Wilhelm Ekman.

In 1989, the fourth full translation of the &quot;Kalevala&quot; into English was published, illustrated by Björn Landström.

===Literature===
The &quot;Kalevala&quot; has been translated over 150 times, into over 60 different languages. (See § translations.)

====Re-tellings====
Finnish cartoonist Kristian Huitula illustrated a comic book adaptation of the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. The &quot;Kalevala Graphic Novel&quot; contains the storyline of all the 50 chapters in original text form.

Finnish cartoonist and children&#x27;s writer Mauri Kunnas wrote and illustrated . The story is that of the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, with the characters presented as anthropomorphised dogs, wolves and cats. The story deviates from the full &quot;Kalevala&quot; to make the story more appropriate for children.

In the late 1950s, students from the Rose Bruford College of Speech and Drama performed excerpts from the Kalevala in a presentation to the poet laureate John Masefield at Oxford. Some images from this presentation can be viewed online 

The &quot;Kalevala&quot; inspired the American Disney cartoonist Don Rosa to draw a Donald Duck (who is himself a popular character in Finland) story based on the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, called &quot;The Quest for Kalevala&quot;. The comic was released on the 150th anniversary of the &quot;Kalevala&quot;.

====Works inspired by====

Franz Anton Schiefner&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Kalevala&quot; was one inspiration for Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s 1855 poem &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;, which is written in a similar trochaic tetrameter.

Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald&#x27;s Estonian national epic &quot;Kalevipoeg&quot; was inspired by the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. Both Väinämöinen and Ilmarinen are mentioned in the work, and the overall story of Kalevipoeg, Kalev&#x27;s son, bears similarities to the Kullervo story.

J. R. R. Tolkien claimed the &quot;Kalevala&quot; as one of his sources for &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. For example, the tale of Kullervo is the basis of Túrin Turambar in &quot;Narn i Chîn Húrin&quot;, including the sword that speaks when the anti-hero uses it to commit suicide. Aulë, the Lord of Matter and the Master of All Crafts, was influenced by Ilmarinen, the Eternal Hammerer. Echoes of the &quot;Kalevala&quot;″s characters, Väinämöinen in particular, can be found in Tom Bombadil of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

Poet and playwright Paavo Haavikko took influence from the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, including in his poem &quot;Kaksikymmentä ja yksi&quot; (1974), and the TV drama &quot;Rauta-aika&quot; (1982).

American science fiction and fantasy authors L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt used the &quot;Kalevala&quot; as source materials for their 1953 fantasy novella &quot;The Wall of Serpents&quot;. This is the fourth story in the authors&#x27; Harold Shea series, in which the hero and his companions visit various mythic and fictional worlds. In this story, the characters visit the world of the Kalevala, where they encounter characters from the epic, drawn with a skeptical eye.

Emil Petaja was an American science fiction and fantasy author of Finnish descent. His best known works, known as the &quot;Otava Series&quot;, were a series of novels based on the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. The series brought Petaja readers from around the world, while his mythological approach to science fiction was discussed in scholarly papers presented at academic conferences. He has a further &quot;Kalevala&quot; based work which is not part of the series, entitled &quot;The Time Twister&quot;.

British fantasy author Michael Moorcock&#x27;s sword and sorcery anti-hero, Elric of Melniboné was influenced by the character Kullervo.

British fantasy author Michael Scott Rohan&#x27;s &quot;Winter of the World&quot; series feature Louhi as a major antagonist and include many narrative threads from the &quot;Kalevela&quot;.

The web comic &quot;A Redtail&#x27;s Dream&quot;, written and illustrated by Minna Sundberg, cites the &quot;Kalevala&quot; as an influence. (Physical edition 2014.)

The British science fiction writer Ian Watson&#x27;s &quot;Books of Mana&quot; duology, &quot;Lucky&#x27;s Harvest&quot; and &quot;The Fallen Moon&quot;, both contain references to places and names from the &quot;Kalevala&quot;.

In 2008, Vietnamese author and translator Bùi Viêt Hoa published a piece of epic poetry &quot;The Children of Mon and Man&quot; (), which delves into Vietnamese folk poetry and mythology, but was partially influenced by the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. The work was written mainly in Finland and the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs co-financed it.

===Music===
Finnish music has been greatly influenced by the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, following in the tradition of the original song-poems.

====Classical music====
The first recorded example of a musician influenced by the &quot;Kalevala&quot; is Filip von Schantz. In 1860, he composed the Kullervo Overture. The piece premièred at the opening of a new theatre in Helsinki on November of the same year. Von Schantz&#x27;s work was followed by Robert Kajanus&#x27; &quot;Kullervo&#x27;s Funeral March&quot; and the symphonic poem &quot;Aino&quot; in 1880 and 1885, respectively. &quot;Aino&quot; is credited with inspiring Jean Sibelius to investigate the richness of the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. &quot;Die Kalewainen in Pochjola&quot;, the first opera freely based upon the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, was composed by Karl Müller-Berghaus in 1890.

Jean Sibelius is the best-known &quot;Kalevala&quot;-influenced classical composer. Twelve of Sibelius&#x27; best-known works are based upon or influenced by the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, including his &quot;Kullervo&quot;, a tone poem for soprano, baritone, chorus and orchestra composed in 1892. Sibelius also composed the music of to words written by Finnish soldier and writer Heikki Nurmio. The march features the line .

Other classical composers influenced by the &quot;Kalevala&quot;:
* Einojuhani Rautavaara
* Leevi Madetoja
* Uuno Klami
* Tauno Marttinen
* Aulis Sallinen
* Veljo Tormis

====Folk metal====
A number of folk metal bands have drawn on the &quot;Kalevala&quot; heavily for inspiration. In 1993, the Finnish bands Amorphis and Sentenced released two concept albums, &quot;Tales from the Thousand Lakes&quot; and &quot;North from Here&quot; respectively, which were the first of many &quot;Kalevala&quot;-inspired albums that have followed since. Amorphis&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Skyforger&quot; also draws heavily on the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. The Finnish folk metal band Ensiferum have released songs such as &quot;Old Man&quot; and &quot;Little Dreamer&quot;, which are influenced by the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. The third track of their &quot;Dragonheads&quot; EP, entitled &quot;Kalevala Melody&quot;, is an instrumental piece following the rhythm of the Kalevala metre. Another Finnish folk metal band, Turisas, have adapted several verses from song nine of the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, &quot;The Origin of Iron&quot;, for the lyrics of their song &quot;Cursed Be Iron&quot;, which is the third track of the album &quot;The Varangian Way&quot;. Finnish metal band Amberian Dawn use lyrics inspired by the &quot;Kalevala&quot; on their album &quot;River of Tuoni&quot;, as well as on its successor, &quot;The Clouds of Northland Thunder&quot;. On 3 August 2012, Finnish folk metal band Korpiklaani released a new album entitled &quot;Manala&quot;. Jonne Järvelä from the band said, &quot; is the realm of the dead – the underworld in Finnish mythology. and are used synonymously. This place is best known for its appearance in the Finnish national epic &quot;Kalevala&quot;, on which many of our new songs are based.&quot;

====Other musical genres====
In the mid-1960s, the progressive rock band Kalevala was active within Finland and in 1974, the now prolific singer-songwriter Jukka Kuoppamäki released the song &quot;Väinämöinen&quot;. These were some of the first pieces of modern popular music inspired by the &quot;Kalevala&quot;.

In 1998, Ruth MacKenzie recorded the album &quot;Kalevala: Dream of the Salmon Maiden&quot;, a song cycle covering the story of Aino and her choice to refuse the hand of the sorcerer Väinämöinen, instead transforming herself into a salmon. MacKenzie has continued to perform the piece live.

The Karelian Finnish folk music group Värttinä has based some of its lyrics on motifs from the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. The Vantaa Chamber Choir have songs influenced by the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. Their &quot;Kalevala&quot;-themed third album, &quot;Marian virsi&quot; (2005), combines contemporary folk with traditionally performed folk poetry.

In 2003, the Finnish progressive rock quarterly Colossus and French Musea Records commissioned 30 progressive rock groups from around the world to compose songs based on parts of the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. The publication assigned each band with a particular song from the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, which the band was free to interpret as they saw fit. The result, titled &quot;Kalevala&quot;, is a three-disc, multilingual, four-hour epic telling.

In the beginning of 2009, in celebration of the 160th anniversary of the &quot;Kalevala&quot;″s first published edition, the Finnish Literature Society and the Kalevala Society premièred ten new and original works inspired by the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. The works included poems, classical and contemporary music and artwork. A book was published by the Finnish Literature Society in conjunction with the event and a large exhibition of &quot;Kalevala&quot;-themed artwork and cultural artefacts was put on display at the Ateneum museum in Helsinki.

In 2017, a New York-based production &quot;Kalevala the Musical&quot; premiered in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Republic of Finland. The production featured original pop, folk and world music score written by Johanna Telander. The concert version was performed across the United States and Finland.

===Film and television===
In 1959, a joint Finnish-Soviet production entitled &quot;Sampo&quot;, also known as &quot;The Day the Earth Froze&quot;, was released, inspired by the story of the &quot;Sampo&quot; from the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, which is also featured in a 1993 episode of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

In 1982, the Finnish Broadcasting Company (YLE) produced a television mini-series called , with music composed by Aulis Sallinen and book by Paavo Haavikko. The series was set &quot;during the Kalevala times&quot; and based upon events which take place in the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. The series&#x27; part 3/4 won Prix Italia in 1983.

The martial arts film &quot;Jadesoturi&quot;, also known as &quot;Jade Warrior&quot;, released in Finland on 13 October 2006, was based upon the &quot;Kalevala&quot; and set in Finland and China. Also, the 2013 film &quot;&quot;, directed by Jari Halonen, takes place both in the ancient land of the Kalevala and also in modern Finland. The film, made with a budget of €250,000, turned out to be a box-office bomb and received a mostly negative reception from critics.

In &quot;Chapter 17: The Apostate&quot;, the first episode of the third season of &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; series, Din Djarin meets with Bo-Katan in an old Mandalorian castle, which is located in the Mandalore system planet called Kalevala. The same planet has also previously been mentioned in &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; series.

In August 2024, it was announced that Antti Jokinen has been attached to direct the upcoming film &quot;&quot;, and has been cast as the title character in the film. The film will be premiered at the beginning of 2026.

===Military===
Heinrich Himmler had designated the 41th Waffen SS Division as Grenadier Division Kalevala.

==Interpretations==

The &quot;Kalevala&quot; has attracted many scholars and enthusiasts to interpret its contents in a historical context. Many interpretations of the themes have been tabled. Some parts of the epic have been perceived as ancient conflicts between the early Finns and the Sami. In this context, the country of &quot;Kalevala&quot; could be understood as Southern Finland and &quot;Pohjola&quot; as Lapland.
However, the place names in &quot;Kalevala&quot; seem to transfer the &quot;Kalevala&quot; further south, which has been interpreted as reflecting the Finnic expansion from the South that came to push the Sami further to the north. Some scholars locate the lands of &quot;Kalevala&quot; in East Karelia, where most of the &quot;Kalevala&quot; stories were written down. In 1961, the small town of &quot;Uhtua&quot; in the then Soviet Republic of Karelia was renamed Kalevala, perhaps to promote that theory.

Finnish politician and linguist Eemil Nestor Setälä rejected the idea that the heroes of &quot;Kalevala&quot; are historical in nature and suggested they are personifications of natural phenomena. He interprets Pohjola as the northern heavens and the Sampo as the pillar of the world. Setälä suggests that the journey to regain the Sampo is a purely imaginary one with the heroes riding a mythological boat or magical steed to the heavens.

The practice of bear worship was once very common in Finland and there are strong echoes of this in the &quot;Kalevala&quot;.

The old Finnish word (a strait of deep water with a slow current) appears to be the origin of the name Väinämöinen; one of Väinämöinen&#x27;s other names is Suvantolainen, being the modern word for . Consequently, it is possible that the might be the island of Saaremaa in Estonia and &quot;Kalevala&quot; the Estonian mainland.

Finnish folklorists Matti Kuusi and Pertti Anttonen state that terms such as &quot;the people of Kalevala&quot; or &quot;the tribe of Kalevala&quot; were fabricated by Elias Lönnrot. Moreover, they contend that the word &quot;Kalevala&quot; is very rare in traditional poetry and that by emphasizing dualism (Kalevala vs. Pohjola) Elias Lönnrot created the required tension that made the &quot;Kalevala&quot; dramatically successful and thus fit for a national epic of the time.

There are similarities with mythology and folklore from other cultures, for example, the Kullervo character and his story bearing some likeness to the Greek Oedipus. The similarity of the virginal maiden Marjatta to the Christian Virgin Mary is striking. The arrival of Marjatta&#x27;s son in the final song spelling the end of Väinämöinen&#x27;s reign over Kalevala is similar to the arrival of Christianity bringing about the end of Paganism in Finland and Europe at large.

<text>The Ku Klux Klan (), commonly shortened to the KKK or the Klan, is an American Protestant-led Christian extremist, white supremacist, far-right hate group. It was founded in 1865 during Reconstruction in the devastated South. Various historians have characterized the Klan as America&#x27;s first terrorist group. The group contains several organizations structured as a secret society, which have frequently resorted to terrorism, violence and acts of intimidation to impose their criteria and oppress their victims, most notably African Americans, Jews, and Catholics. A leader of one of these organizations is called a grand wizard, and there have been three distinct iterations with various other targets relative to time and place.

Each iteration of the Klan is defined by non-overlapping time periods, comprising local chapters with little or no central direction. Each has advocated reactionary positions such as white nationalism, anti-immigration and—especially in later iterations—Nordicism, antisemitism, anti-Catholicism, right-wing populism, anti-communism, homophobia, anti-atheism, and Islamophobia. The first Klan, founded by Confederate veterans, assaulted and murdered politically active Black people and their white political allies in the South.

The second iteration of the Klan originated in the late 1910s, and was the first to use cross burnings and standardized white-hooded robes. The KKK of the 1920s had a nationwide membership in the millions and reflected a cross-section of the native born white Protestant population.

The third Klan formed in the mid 20th century, largely as a reaction to the growing civil rights movement. It used murder and bombings to achieve its aims. All three movements are far-right extremist organizations, and have called for the &quot;purification&quot; of American society. In each era, membership was secret and estimates of the total were highly exaggerated by both allies and enemies.

The first Klan, established in the Reconstruction era, for men opposed to Radical Reconstruction. Federal law enforcement began taking action against it around 1871. The Klan sought to overthrow Republican state governments in the South, especially by using voter intimidation and targeted violence against African-American leaders. The Klan was organized into numerous independent chapters across the Southern United States. Each chapter was autonomous and highly secretive about membership and plans. Members made their own, often colorful, costumes: robes, masks and pointed hats, designed to be terrifying and to hide their identities.

The second Klan started in 1915 as a small group in Georgia. It suddenly started to grow after 1920 and flourished among men nationwide in the early and mid-1920s, including urban areas of the Midwest and West. Taking inspiration from D. W. Griffith&#x27;s 1915 silent film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, which mythologized the founding of the first Klan, it employed marketing techniques and a popular fraternal organization structure. Rooted in local Protestant communities, it sought to maintain white supremacy, often took a pro-Prohibition stance, and it opposed Jews, while also stressing its opposition to the alleged political power of the pope and the Catholic Church. This second Klan flourished both in the south and northern states; it was funded by initiation fees and selling its members a standard white costume. The chapters did not have dues. It used K-words which were similar to those used by the first Klan, while adding cross burnings and mass parades to intimidate others. It rapidly declined in the latter half of the 1920s.

The third and current manifestation of the KKK emerged after 1950, in the form of localized and isolated groups that use the KKK name. They have focused on opposition to the civil rights movement, often using violence and murder to suppress activists. This manifestation is classified as a hate group by the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center. , the Anti-Defamation League puts total KKK membership nationwide at around 3,000, while the Southern Poverty Law Center puts it at 6,000 members total.

The second and third incarnations of the Ku Klux Klan made frequent references to a false mythologized perception of America&#x27;s &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; blood, hearkening back to 19th-century nativism. Although members of the KKK swear to uphold Christian morality, Christian denominations widely denounce them.

== Overview ==
=== First Klan ===
The first Klan was founded in Pulaski, Tennessee, on December 24, 1865, by six former officers of the Confederate Army: Frank McCord, Richard Reed, John Lester, John Kennedy, J. Calvin Jones, and James Crowe. It started as a fraternal social club inspired at least in part by the then largely defunct Sons of Malta. It borrowed parts of the initiation ceremony from that group, with the same purpose: &quot;ludicrous initiations, the baffling of public curiosity, and the amusement for members were the only objects of the Klan&quot;, according to Albert Stevens in 1907. The manual of rituals was printed by Laps D. McCord of Pulaski. The origins of the hood are uncertain; it may have been appropriated from the Spanish capirote hood, or it may be traced to the uniform of Southern Mardi Gras celebrations.

According to &quot;The Cyclopædia of Fraternities&quot; (1907), &quot;Beginning in April, 1867, there was a gradual transformation. ... The members had conjured up a veritable Frankenstein. They had played with an engine of power and mystery, though organized on entirely innocent lines, and found themselves overcome by a belief that something must lie behind it all—that there was, after all, a serious purpose, a work for the Klan to do.&quot;

The KKK had no organizational structure above the chapter level. However, there were similar groups across the South that adopted similar goals. Klan chapters promoted white supremacy and spread throughout the South as an insurgent movement in resistance to Reconstruction. Confederate veteran John W. Morton founded a KKK chapter in Nashville, Tennessee. As a secret vigilante group, the Klan targeted freedmen and their allies; it sought to restore white supremacy by threats and violence, including murder. &quot;They targeted white Northern leaders, Southern sympathizers and politically active Blacks.&quot; In 1870 and 1871, the federal government passed the Enforcement Acts, which were intended to prosecute and suppress Klan crimes.

The first Klan had mixed results in terms of achieving its objectives. It seriously weakened the Black political leadership through its use of assassinations and threats of violence, and it drove some people out of politics. On the other hand, it caused a sharp backlash, with passage of federal laws that historian Eric Foner says were a success in terms of &quot;restoring order, reinvigorating the morale of Southern Republicans, and enabling Blacks to exercise their rights as citizens&quot;. Historian George C. Rable argues that the Klan was a political failure and therefore was discarded by the Democratic Party leaders of the South. He says:

After the Klan was suppressed, similar insurgent paramilitary groups arose that were explicitly directed at suppressing Republican voting and turning Republicans out of office: the White League, which started in Louisiana in 1874; and the Red Shirts, which started in Mississippi and developed chapters in the Carolinas. For instance, the Red Shirts are credited with helping elect Wade Hampton as governor in South Carolina. They were described as acting as the military arm of the Democratic Party and are attributed with helping white Democrats regain control of state legislatures throughout the South.

=== Second Klan ===
In 1915, the second Klan was founded atop Stone Mountain, Georgia, by William Joseph Simmons. While Simmons relied on documents from the original Klan and memories of some surviving elders, the revived Klan was based significantly on the wildly popular film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;. The earlier Klan had not worn the white costumes and had not burned crosses; these aspects were introduced in Thomas Dixon&#x27;s book &quot;The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan,&quot; on which the film was based. When the film was shown in Atlanta in December of that year, Simmons and his new Klansmen paraded to the theater in robes and pointed hoods – many on robed horses – just like in the film. These mass parades became another hallmark of the new Klan that had not existed in the First Klan.

Beginning in 1921, the Second Klan adopted a modern business system of using full-time, paid recruiters and it appealed to new members as a fraternal organization, of which many examples were flourishing at the time. The national headquarters made its profit through a monopoly on costume sales, while the organizers were paid through initiation fees. It grew rapidly nationwide at a time of prosperity. Reflecting the social tensions pitting urban versus rural America, it spread to every state and was prominent in many cities.

Writer W. J. Cash, in his 1941 book &quot;The Mind of the South&quot; characterized the second Klan as &quot;anti-Negro, anti-Alien, anti-Red, anti-Catholic, anti-Jew, anti-Darwin, anti-Modern, anti-Liberal, Fundamentalist, vastly Moral, [and] militantly Protestant. And summing up these fears, it brought them into focus with the tradition of the past, and above all with the ancient Southern pattern of high romantic histrionics, violence and mass coercion of the scapegoat and the heretic.&quot; It preached &quot;One Hundred Percent Americanism&quot; and demanded the purification of politics, calling for strict morality and better enforcement of Prohibition. Its official rhetoric focused on the threat of the Catholic Church, using anti-Catholicism and nativism. Its appeal was directed exclusively toward white Protestants; it opposed Jews, Black people, Catholics, and newly arriving Southern and Eastern European immigrants, most of whom were Jewish or Catholic.

Some local groups threatened violence against rum runners and those they deemed &quot;notorious sinners&quot;; the relatively few violent episodes led by the Second KKK nearly all took place in the South. The Red Knights were a militant group organized in opposition to the Klan and it responded violently to Klan provocations on several occasions.

The Second Klan was a formal fraternal organization, with a national and state structure. During its heyday, its publicity was handled by the Southern Publicity Association. Within the first six months of the Association&#x27;s national recruitment campaign, Klan membership had increased by 85,000. At its peak in the mid-1920s, the organization&#x27;s membership was estimated as high as three to eight million members.

In 1923, Simmons was ousted as leader of the KKK by Hiram Wesley Evans. From September 1923 there were two Ku Klux Klan national organizations: the one founded by Simmons and led by Evans with its strength primarily in the southern United States, and a breakaway group led by Grand Dragon D. C. Stephenson based in Evansville, Indiana with its membership primarily in the midwest.

Internal divisions, criminal behavior by leaders – especially Stephenson&#x27;s conviction for the abduction, rape, and murder of Madge Oberholtzer – and external opposition brought about a collapse in the membership of both national Klan groups. The main group&#x27;s membership had dropped to about 30,000 by 1930. It finally faded away in the 1940s.

Klan organizers also operated in Canada, especially in Saskatchewan in 1926–1928, where Klansmen denounced immigrants from Eastern Europe as a threat to Canada&#x27;s &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; heritage.

=== Third Klan ===
The &quot;Ku Klux Klan&quot; name was used by numerous independent local secret groups opposing the civil rights movement and desegregation, especially in the 1950s and 1960s. They sometimes forged informal alliances with Southern police departments, as in Birmingham, Alabama; or with governor&#x27;s offices, as with George Wallace of Alabama. Several activists of the Third Klan were convicted of murder in the deaths of civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964 and of children in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham in 1963.

The United States government considers the Third Klan to be a &quot;subversive terrorist organization&quot;. In April 1997, FBI agents arrested four members of the True Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Dallas for conspiracy to commit robbery and for conspiring to blow up a natural gas processing plant. In 1999, the city council of Charleston, South Carolina, passed a resolution declaring the Klan a terrorist organization.

The Third Klan groups have been in a state of consistent decline. A variety of factors are involved: the public&#x27;s negative distaste of the group&#x27;s image, platform, and history; infiltration and prosecution by law enforcement; civil lawsuit financial forfeitures; and the radical right-wing&#x27;s perception of the Klan as outdated and unfashionable. The Southern Poverty Law Center reported that between 2016 and 2019, the number of Klan groups in America dropped from 130 to just 51. A 2016 report by the Anti-Defamation League claims an estimate of just over 30 Third Klan groups still active. Estimates of total collective membership range from about 3,000 to 8,000. In addition to its active membership, the Third Klan has an &quot;unknown number of associates and supporters&quot;.

== History ==
=== Etymology ===
The name was probably formed in 1865 by combining the Greek &#x27; (, which means circle) with &quot;clan&quot;. The word had previously been used for other fraternal organizations in the South such as Kuklos Adelphon.

=== First Klan: 1865–1871 ===

==== Creation and naming ====
Six Confederate veterans from Pulaski, Tennessee, created the First Ku Klux Klan on December 24, 1865, during the Reconstruction of the South. The group was known for a short time as the &quot;Kuklux Clan&quot;. The Ku Klux Klan was one of a number of secret, oath-bound organizations using violence, which included the Southern Cross in New Orleans (1865) and the Knights of the White Camelia (1867) in Louisiana.

Historians see the First KKK as part of the post-Civil War violent efforts to reverse the dramatically changed social situation by using extrajudicial means to restore white supremacy. In 1866, Mississippi governor William L. Sharkey reported widespread disorder, lack of control, and lawlessness. In other Southern states armed bands of Confederate soldiers roamed at will. The Klan systematically used violence against black people and their white allies as intimidation. They burned houses and attacked and killed black people, leaving their bodies on the roads.

At an 1867 meeting in Nashville, Tennessee, First Klan activists tried to create a hierarchical organization with local chapters eventually reporting to a national headquarters. Since most of the Klansmen were veterans, they were used to such military hierarchy, The effort did not succeed: the First Klan never operated under any centralized structure. Local chapters and bands were always highly independent.
Former Confederate brigadier general George Gordon developed the &quot;Prescript&quot;, which espoused white supremacist belief. For instance, an applicant should be asked if he was in favor of &quot;a white man&#x27;s government&quot;, &quot;the reenfranchisement and emancipation of the white men of the South, and the restitution of the Southern people to all their rights&quot;. The latter is a reference to the Ironclad Oath, which stripped the vote from white persons who refused to swear that they had not borne arms against the Union.

Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest was elected the first grand wizard, and claimed to be the Klan&#x27;s national leader. In an 1868 newspaper interview, Forrest stated that the Klan&#x27;s primary opposition was to the Loyal Leagues, radical Republican state governments. They opposed people such as Tennessee governor William Gannaway Brownlow, and other &quot;carpetbaggers&quot; and &quot;scalawags&quot;. Forrest argued that many Southerners believed that Black people were voting for the Republican Party because they were being hoodwinked by the Loyal Leagues. One Alabama newspaper editor declared &quot;The League is nothing more than a nigger Ku Klux Klan.&quot;

Despite Gordon&#x27;s and Forrest&#x27;s work, local Klan units never accepted the &quot;Prescript&quot; and continued to operate autonomously. There were never hierarchical levels or state headquarters. Klan members used violence to settle old personal feuds and local grudges, as they worked to restore general white dominance in the disrupted postwar society. The historian Elaine Frantz Parsons describes the membership:

Lifting the Klan mask revealed a chaotic multitude of anti-Black vigilante groups, disgruntled poor white farmers, wartime guerrilla bands, displaced Democratic politicians, illegal whiskey distillers, coercive moral reformers, sadists, rapists, white workmen fearful of Black competition, employers trying to enforce labor discipline, common thieves, neighbors with decades-old grudges, and even a few freedmen and white Republicans who allied with Democratic whites or had criminal agendas of their own. Indeed, all they had in common, besides being overwhelmingly white, southern, and Democratic, was that they were called, Klansmen.
Historian Eric Foner observed: &quot;In effect, the Klan was a military force serving the interests of the Democratic party, the planter class, and all those who desired restoration of white supremacy. Its purposes were political, but political in the broadest sense, for it sought to affect power relations, both public and private, throughout Southern society. It aimed to reverse the interlocking changes sweeping over the South during Reconstruction: to destroy the Republican party&#x27;s infrastructure, undermine the Reconstruction state, reestablish control of the Black labor force, and restore racial subordination in every aspect of Southern life.&quot; To that end they worked to curb the education, economic advancement, voting rights, and right to keep and bear arms of Black people.The First Klan soon spread into every Southern state, launching a reign of terror against Republican leaders both Black and white..

==== Activities ====
In a 1933 interview, William Sellers, born enslaved in Virginia, recalled the post-war &quot;raids of the Ku Klux, young white men of Rockingham County who would go into the huts of the recently freed negroes or catch some negro who had been working for thirty cents a day on his way home from work...and cruelly whip him, leaving him to live or die.&quot; Seemingly random whipping attacks, meant to be suggestive of previous condition of servitude, were a widespread aspect of the early Klan; for example in 1870–71 in Limestone Township (now Cherokee County), South Carolina, of 77 documented attacks, &quot;four were shot, sixty-seven whipped and six had had their ears cropped.&quot;

Klan members adopted masks and robes that hid their identities and added to the drama of their night rides. The South was heavily rural and most people knew each other&#x27;s faces, and sometimes could recognized the attackers by voice and mannerisms. &quot;The kind of thing that men are afraid or ashamed to do openly, and by day, they accomplish secretly, masked, and at night.&quot; The night riders of the First Klan &quot;sometimes claimed to be ghosts of Confederate soldiers so, as they claimed, to frighten superstitious Blacks. Few freedmen took such nonsense seriously.&quot;

The First Klan attacked Black members of the Loyal Leagues and intimidated white Republicans and Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau workers. When they killed Black political leaders, they also took heads of families, along with the leaders of churches and community groups, because these people had many roles in society. Agents of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau reported weekly assaults and murders of Black people.

&quot;Armed guerrilla warfare killed thousands of Negroes; political riots were staged; their causes or occasions were always obscure, their results always certain: ten to one hundred times as many Negroes were killed as whites.&quot; Masked men shot into houses and burned them, sometimes with the occupants still inside. They drove successful Black farmers off their land. &quot;Generally, it can be reported that in North and South Carolina, in 18 months ending in June 1867, there were 197 murders and 548 cases of aggravated assault.&quot;
Klan violence worked to suppress Black voting, and campaign seasons were deadly. More than 2,000 people were killed, wounded, or otherwise injured in Louisiana within a few weeks prior to the Presidential election of November 1868. Although St. Landry Parish had a registered Republican majority of 1,071, after the murders, no Republicans voted in the fall elections. White Democrats cast the full vote of the parish for President Grant&#x27;s opponent. The KKK killed and wounded more than 200 Black Republicans, hunting and chasing them through the woods. Thirteen captives were taken from jail and shot; a half-buried pile of 25 bodies was found in the woods. The KKK made people vote Democratic and gave them certificates of the fact.

In the April 1868 Georgia gubernatorial election, Columbia County cast 1,222 votes for Republican Rufus Bullock. By the November presidential election, Klan intimidation led to suppression of the Republican vote and only one person voted for Ulysses S. Grant.

Klansmen killed more than 150 African Americans in Jackson County, Florida, and hundreds more in other counties including Madison, Alachua, Columbia, and Hamilton. Florida Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau records provided a detailed recounting of Klansmen&#x27;s beatings and murders of freedmen and their white allies.
Milder encounters, including some against white teachers, also occurred. In Mississippi, according to the Congressional inquiry:

One of these teachers (Miss Allen of Illinois), whose school was at Cotton Gin Port in Monroe County, was visited ... between one and two o&#x27;clock in the morning in March 1871, by about fifty men mounted and disguised. Each man wore a long white robe and his face was covered by a loose mask with scarlet stripes. She was ordered to get up and dress which she did at once and then admitted to her room the captain and lieutenant who in addition to the usual disguise had long horns on their heads and a sort of device in front. The lieutenant had a pistol in his hand and he and the captain sat down while eight or ten men stood inside the door and the porch was full. They treated her &quot;gentlemanly and quietly&quot; but complained of the heavy school-tax, said she must stop teaching and go away and warned her that they never gave a second notice. She heeded the warning and left the county.

By 1868, two years after the Klan&#x27;s creation, its activity was beginning to decrease. Members were hiding behind Klan masks and robes as a way to avoid prosecution for freelance violence. Many influential Southern Democrats feared that Klan lawlessness provided an excuse for the federal government to retain its power over the South, and they began to turn against it. There were outlandish claims made, such as Georgian B. H. Hill stating &quot;that some of these outrages were actually perpetrated by the political friends of the parties slain.&quot;

==== Resistance ====
Union Army veterans in mountainous Blount County, Alabama, organized &quot;the anti-Ku Klux&quot;. They put an end to violence by threatening Klansmen with reprisals unless they stopped whipping Unionists and burning Black churches and schools. Armed Black people formed their own defense in Bennettsville, South Carolina, and patrolled the streets to protect their homes.

National sentiment gathered to crack down on the Klan, even though some Democrats at the national level questioned whether the Klan really existed, or believed that it was a creation of nervous Southern Republican governors. Many southern states began to pass anti-Klan legislation.

In January 1871, Pennsylvania Republican senator John Scott convened a congressional committee which took testimony from 52 witnesses about Klan atrocities, accumulating 12 volumes. In February, former Union general and congressman Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts introduced the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (Ku Klux Klan Act). This added to the enmity that Southern white Democrats bore toward him. While the bill was being considered, further violence in the South swung support for its passage. The governor of South Carolina appealed for federal troops to assist his efforts in keeping control of the state. A riot and massacre occurred in a Meridian, Mississippi, courthouse, from which a Black state representative escaped by fleeing to the woods. The 1871 Civil Rights Act allowed the president to suspend &quot;habeas corpus.&quot;

In 1871, President Ulysses S. Grant signed Butler&#x27;s legislation. The Ku Klux Klan Act and the Enforcement Act of 1870 were used by the federal government to enforce the civil rights provisions for individuals under the constitution. The Klan refused to voluntarily dissolve after the 1871 Klan Act, so President Grant issued a suspension of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; and stationed federal troops in nine South Carolina counties by invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807. The Klansmen were apprehended and prosecuted in federal court. Judges Hugh Lennox Bond and George S. Bryan presided over South Carolina Ku Klux Klan Trials in Columbia, S.C., during December 1871. The defendants were given from three months to five years of incarceration with fines. More Black people served on juries in federal court than on local or state juries, so they had a chance to participate in the process. Hundreds of Klan members were fined or imprisoned during the crackdown, &quot;once the national government became set upon a policy of military intervention whole populations which had scouted the authority of the weak &#x27;Radical&#x27; government of the State became meek.&quot;

==== End of the first Klan ====
Klan leader Nathan Bedford Forrest boasted that the Klan was a nationwide organization of 550,000 men and that he could muster 40,000 Klansmen within five days&#x27; notice. However, the Klan had no membership rosters, no chapters, and no local officers, so it was difficult for observers to judge its membership. It had created a sensation by the dramatic nature of its masked forays and because of its many murders.

In 1870, a federal grand jury determined that the Klan was a &quot;terrorist organization&quot; and issued hundreds of indictments for crimes of violence and terrorism. Klan members were prosecuted, and many fled from areas that were under federal government jurisdiction, particularly in South Carolina. Many people not formally inducted into the Klan had used the Klan&#x27;s costume to hide their identities when carrying out independent acts of violence. Forrest called for the Klan to disband in 1869, arguing that it was &quot;being perverted from its original honorable and patriotic purposes, becoming injurious instead of subservient to the public peace&quot;. Historian Stanley Horn argues that &quot;generally speaking, the Klan&#x27;s end was more in the form of spotty, slow, and gradual disintegration than a formal and decisive disbandment&quot;. A Georgia-based reporter wrote in 1870: &quot;A true statement of the case is not that the Ku Klux are an organized band of licensed criminals, but that men who commit crimes call themselves Ku Klux&quot;.
In many states, officials were reluctant to use Black militia against the Klan out of fear that racial tensions would be raised. Republican governor of North Carolina William Woods Holden called out the militia against the Klan in 1870, adding to his unpopularity. This and extensive violence and fraud at the polls caused the Republicans to lose their majority in the state legislature. Disaffection with Holden&#x27;s actions contributed to white Democratic legislators impeaching him and removing him from office, but their reasons for doing so were numerous.

Klan operations ended in South Carolina and gradually withered away throughout the rest of the South. Attorney General Amos Tappan Ackerman led the prosecutions.

Foner argues that:

New groups of insurgents emerged in the mid-1870s, local paramilitary organizations such as the White League, Red Shirts, saber clubs, and rifle clubs, that intimidated and murdered Black political leaders. The White League and Red Shirts were distinguished by their willingness to cultivate publicity, working directly to overturn Republican officeholders and regain control of politics.

In 1882, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;United States v. Harris&quot; that the Klan Act was partially unconstitutional. It ruled that Congress&#x27;s power under the Fourteenth Amendment did not include the right to regulate against private conspiracies. It recommended that persons who had been victimized should seek relief in state courts, which were entirely unsympathetic to such appeals.

Klan costumes, also called &quot;regalia&quot;, disappeared from use by the early 1870s, after Grand Wizard Forrest called for their destruction as part of disbanding the Klan. The Klan was broken as an organization by 1872.

=== Second Klan: 1915–1944 ===
==== Refounding in 1915 ====
In 1915, the film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; was released, mythologizing and glorifying the first Klan and its endeavors. The second Ku Klux Klan was founded in 1915 by William Joseph Simmons at Stone Mountain, near Atlanta, with fifteen &quot;charter members&quot;. Its growth was based on a new anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic, Prohibitionist and anti-Semitic agenda, which reflected contemporary social tensions, particularly recent immigration. The new organization and chapters adopted regalia featured in &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;; membership was kept secret by wearing masks in public.

===== &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; =====

Director D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; glorified the original Klan. The film was based on the book and play &quot;The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan&quot;, as well as the book &quot;The Leopard&#x27;s Spots&quot;, both by Thomas Dixon Jr. Much of the modern Klan&#x27;s iconography is derived from it, including the standardized white costume and the burning cross. Its imagery was based on Dixon&#x27;s romanticized concept of old England and Scotland, as portrayed in the novels and poetry of Sir Walter Scott. The film&#x27;s influence was enhanced by an alleged claim of endorsement by President Woodrow Wilson. Dixon was an old friend of Wilson&#x27;s and, before its release, there was a private showing of the film at the White House. A publicist claimed that Wilson said, &quot;It is like writing history with lightning, and my only regret is that it is all so terribly true.&quot; The likelihood of him saying this is doubtful, and he wrote a letter condemning the film following protests.

==== Goals ====

The first and third Klans were primarily Southeastern groups aimed against Black people. The second Klan, in contrast, broadened the scope of the organization to appeal to people in the Midwestern and Western states who considered Catholics, Jews, and foreign-born minorities to be anti-American.

The Second Klan saw threats from every direction. According to historian Brian R. Farmer, &quot;two-thirds of the national Klan lecturers were Protestant ministers&quot;. Much of the Klan&#x27;s energy went into guarding the home, and historian Kathleen Blee says that its members wanted to protect &quot;the interests of white womanhood&quot;. Joseph Simmons published the pamphlet &quot;ABC of the Invisible Empire&quot; in Atlanta in 1917; in it, he identified the Klan&#x27;s goals as &quot;to shield the sanctity of the home and the chastity of womanhood; to maintain white supremacy; to teach and faithfully inculcate a high spiritual philosophy through an exalted ritualism; and by a practical devotedness to conserve, protect and maintain the distinctive institutions, rights, privileges, principles and ideals of a pure Americanism&quot;. Such moral-sounding purpose underlay its appeal as a fraternal organization, recruiting members with a promise of aid for settling into the new urban societies of rapidly growing cities such as Dallas and Detroit. During the 1930s, particularly after James A. Colescott of Indiana took over as imperial wizard, opposition to Communism became another primary aim of the Klan.

==== Organization ====
New Klan founder William J. Simmons joined 12 different fraternal organizations and recruited for the Klan with his chest covered with fraternal badges, consciously modeling the Klan after fraternal organizations. Klan organizers called &quot;Kleagles&quot; signed up hundreds of new members, who paid initiation fees and received KKK costumes in return. The organizer kept half the money and sent the rest to state or national officials. When the organizer was done with an area, he organized a rally, often with burning crosses, and perhaps presented a Bible to a local Protestant preacher. He left town with the money collected. The local units operated like many fraternal organizations and occasionally brought in speakers.

Simmons initially met with little success in either recruiting members or in raising money, and the Klan remained a small operation in the Atlanta area until 1920. The group produced publications for national circulation from its headquarters in Atlanta: &quot;Searchlight&quot; (1919–1924), &quot;Imperial Night-Hawk&quot; (1923–1924), and &quot;The Kourier&quot;.

==== Perceived moral threats ====
The second Klan was a response to the growing power of Catholics and American Jews and the accompanying proliferation of non-Protestant cultural values, as well as some high-profile instances of violence against whites. The Klan had a nationwide reach by the mid-1920s, with its densest per capita membership in Indiana. It became most prominent in cities with high growth rates between 1910 and 1930, as rural Protestants flocked to jobs in Detroit and Dayton in the Midwest, and Atlanta, Dallas, Memphis, and Houston in the South. Close to half of Michigan&#x27;s 80,000 Klansmen lived in Detroit.

Members of the KKK swore to uphold American values and Christian morality, and some Protestant ministers became involved at the local level. However, no Protestant denomination officially endorsed the KKK; indeed, the Klan was repeatedly denounced by the major Protestant magazines, as well as by all major secular newspapers.

One notable exception was the Pillar of Fire Church, based in Zarephath, New Jersey. Founder Alma Bridwell White was a vocal Klan supporter who repeatedly endorsed the organization, allowing it to hold meetings and even cross burnings at its churches. White&#x27;s pro-Klan writings were collected in her books &quot;The Ku Klux Klan in Prophecy&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Heroes of the Fiery Cross&quot;.

Historian Robert Moats Miller reports that &quot;not a single endorsement of the Klan was found by the present writer in the Methodist press, while many of the attacks on the Klan were quite savage. ...The Southern Baptist press condoned the aims but condemned the methods of the Klan.&quot; National denominational organizations never endorsed the Klan, but they rarely condemned it by name. Many nationally and regionally prominent churchmen did condemn it by name, and none endorsed it.

The second Klan was less violent than either the first or third Klan were. However, the second Klan, especially in the Southeast, was not an entirely non-violent organization. The most violent Klan was in Dallas, Texas. In April 1921, several members of the Klan kidnapped Alex Johnson, a Black man who had been accused of having sex with a white woman. They burned the letters &quot;KKK&quot; into his forehead and gave him a severe beating by a riverbed. The police chief and district attorney refused to prosecute, explicitly and publicly stating they believed that Johnson deserved this treatment. Encouraged by the approval of this whipping, Klansmen in Dallas whipped 68 people by the riverbed in 1922 alone. Although Johnson had been Black, most of the Dallas KKK&#x27;s whipping victims were white men who were accused of offenses against their wives such as adultery, wife beating, abandoning their wives, refusing to pay child support or gambling. Klansmen often invited local newspaper reporters to attend their whippings so they could write a story about it in the next day&#x27;s newspaper. All the Dallas newspapers strongly condemned the Klan. Historians report that the &quot;Morning News&quot;: &quot;diligently published thousands of anti-Klan editorials, exposés, and critical stories, informing its readership of Klan activities in their community as well as from around the state and the nation.&quot;

The Alabama KKK whipped both white and Black women who were accused of fornication or adultery. Although many people in Alabama were outraged by the whippings of white women, no Klansmen were ever convicted for the violence. Anti-Catholicism was a main concern of the Alabama Klan, and Hugo Black built his political career in the 1920s on fighting Catholicism. Black, a Democrat, went on to the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Supreme Court.

==== Rapid growth ====
In 1920, Simmons handed the day-to-day activities of the national office over to two professional publicists, Elizabeth Tyler and Edward Young Clarke. The new leadership invigorated the Klan and it grew rapidly. It appealed to new members based on current social tensions, and stressed responses to fears raised by defiance of Prohibition and new sexual freedoms. It emphasized anti-Jewish, anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant and later anti-Communist positions. It presented itself as a fraternal, nativist and strenuously patriotic organization; and its leaders emphasized support for vigorous enforcement of Prohibition laws. It expanded membership dramatically to a 1924 peak of 1.5 million to 4 million, which was between 4–15% of the eligible population.

By the 1920s, most of its members lived in the Midwest and West. Nearly one in five of the eligible Indiana population were members. It had a national base by 1925. In the South, where the great majority of whites were Democrats, the Klansmen were Democrats. In the rest of the country, the membership comprised both Republicans and Democrats, as well as independents. Klan leaders tried to infiltrate political parties; as Cummings notes, &quot;it was non-partisan in the sense that it pressed its nativist issues to both parties&quot;. Sociologist Rory McVeigh has explained the Klan&#x27;s strategy in appealing to members of both parties:

Religion was a major selling point. Kelly J. Baker argues that Klansmen seriously embraced Protestantism as an essential component of their white supremacist, anti-Catholic, and paternalistic formulation of American democracy and national culture. Their cross was a religious symbol, and their ritual honored Bibles and local ministers. But no nationally prominent religious leader said he was a Klan member.

Economists Fryer and Levitt argue that the rapid growth of the Klan in the 1920s was partly the result of an innovative, multi-level marketing campaign. They also argue that the Klan leadership focused more intently on monetizing the organization during this period than fulfilling the political goals of the organization. Local leaders profited from expanding their membership.

==== Prohibition ====
Historians agree that the Klan&#x27;s resurgence in the 1920s was aided by the national debate over Prohibition. The historian Prendergast says that the KKK&#x27;s &quot;support for Prohibition represented the single most important bond between Klansmen throughout the nation&quot;. The Klan opposed bootleggers, sometimes with violence. In 1922, two hundred Klan members set fire to saloons in Union County, Arkansas. Membership in the Klan and in other Prohibition groups overlapped, and they sometimes coordinated activities.

==== Urbanization ====

A significant characteristic of the second Klan was that it was an organization based in urban areas, reflecting the major shifts of population to cities in the North, West, and the South. In Michigan, for instance, 40,000 members lived in Detroit, where they made up more than half of the state&#x27;s membership. Most Klansmen were lower- to middle-class whites who feared the waves of newcomers to the industrial cities: immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, who were mostly Catholic or Jewish; and Black and white migrants from the South. As new populations poured into cities, rapidly changing neighborhoods created social tensions. Because of the rapid pace of population growth in industrializing cities such as Detroit and Chicago, the Klan grew rapidly in the Midwest. The Klan also grew in booming Southern cities such as Dallas and Houston.

In the medium-size industrial city of Worcester, Massachusetts, in the 1920s, the Klan ascended to power quickly but declined as a result of opposition from the Catholic Church. There was no violence and the local newspaper ridiculed Klansmen as &quot;night-shirt knights&quot;. Half of the members were Swedish Americans, including some first-generation immigrants. The ethnic and religious conflicts among more recent immigrants contributed to the rise of the Klan in the city. Swedish Protestants were struggling against Irish Catholics, who had been entrenched longer, for political and ideological control of the city.

In some states, historians have obtained membership rosters of some local units and matched the names against city directory and local records to create statistical profiles of the membership. Big city newspapers were often hostile and ridiculed Klansmen as ignorant farmers. Detailed analysis from Indiana showed that the rural stereotype was false for that state:

Indiana&#x27;s Klansmen represented a wide cross section of society: they were not disproportionately urban or rural, nor were they significantly more or less likely than other members of society to be from the working class, middle class, or professional ranks. Klansmen were Protestants, of course, but they cannot be described exclusively or even predominantly as fundamentalists. In reality, their religious affiliations mirrored the whole of white Protestant society, including those who did not belong to any church.

The Klan attracted people but most of them did not remain in the organization for long. Membership in the Klan turned over rapidly as people found out that it was not the group which they had wanted. Millions joined and at its peak in the 1920s the organization claimed numbers that amounted to 15% of the nation&#x27;s eligible population. The lessening of social tensions contributed to the Klan&#x27;s decline.

==== Costumes and the burning cross ====

The distinctive white costume permitted large-scale public activities, especially parades and cross-burning ceremonies, while keeping the membership roles a secret. Sales of the costumes provided the main financing for the national organization, while initiation fees funded local and state organizers.

The second Klan embraced the burning Latin cross as a dramatic display of symbolism, with a tone of intimidation. No crosses had been used as a symbol by the first Klan, but it became a symbol of the Klan&#x27;s quasi-Christian message. Its lighting during meetings was often accompanied by prayer, the singing of hymns, and other overtly religious symbolism. In his novel &quot;The Clansman&quot;, Thomas Dixon Jr. borrows the idea that the first Klan had used fiery crosses from &#x27;the call to arms&#x27; of the Scottish Clans, and film director D. W. Griffith used this image in &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;; Simmons adopted the symbol wholesale from the movie, and the symbol and action have been associated with the Klan ever since.

==== Women ====

By the 1920s, the KKK developed a women&#x27;s auxiliary, with chapters in many areas. Its activities included participation in parades, cross lightings, lectures, rallies, and boycotts of local businesses owned by Catholics and Jews. The Women&#x27;s Klan was active in promoting Prohibition, stressing liquor&#x27;s negative impact on wives and children. Its efforts in public schools included distributing Bibles and petitioning for the dismissal of Catholic teachers. As a result of the Women&#x27;s Klan&#x27;s efforts, Texas would not hire Catholic teachers to work in its public schools. As sexual and financial scandals rocked the Klan leadership late in the 1920s, the organization&#x27;s popularity among both men and women dropped off sharply.

==== Political role ====
The second Klan expanded with new chapters in cities in the Midwest and West, and reached both Republicans and Democrats, as well as men without a party affiliation. The goal of Prohibition in particular helped the Klan and some Republicans to make common cause in the North.

The Klan had numerous members in every part of the United States but was particularly strong in the South and Midwest. At its peak, claimed Klan membership exceeded four million and comprised 20% of the adult white male population in many broad geographic regions, and 40% in some areas. The Klan also moved north into Canada, especially Saskatchewan, where it opposed Catholics.

In Indiana, members were American-born, white Protestants and covered a wide range of incomes and social levels. The Indiana Klan was perhaps the most prominent Ku Klux Klan in the nation. It claimed more than 30% of white male Hoosiers as members. In 1924 it supported Republican Edward Jackson in his successful campaign for governor.

Catholic and liberal Democrats—who were strongest in northeastern cities—decided to make the Klan an issue at the 1924 Democratic National Convention in New York City. Their delegates proposed a resolution indirectly attacking the Klan; it was defeated by one vote out of 1,100. The leading presidential candidates were William Gibbs McAdoo, a Protestant with a base in the South and West where the Klan was strong, and New York governor Al Smith, a Catholic with a base in the large cities. After weeks of stalemate and bitter argumentation, both candidates withdrew in favor of a compromise candidate.
In some states, such as Alabama and California, KKK chapters had worked for political reform. In 1924, Klan members were elected to the city council in Anaheim, California. The city had been controlled by an entrenched commercial-civic elite that was mostly German American. Given their tradition of moderate social drinking, the German Americans did not strongly support Prohibition laws – the mayor had been a saloon keeper. Led by the minister of the First Christian Church, the Klan represented a rising group of politically oriented non-ethnic Germans who denounced the elite as corrupt, undemocratic and self-serving. The historian Christopher Cocoltchos says the Klansmen tried to create a model, orderly community. The Klan had about 1,200 members in Orange County, California. The economic and occupational profile of the pro- and anti-Klan groups shows the two were similar and about equally prosperous. Klan members were Protestants, as were most of their opponents, but the latter also included many Catholic Germans. Individuals who joined the Klan had earlier demonstrated a much higher rate of voting and civic activism than did their opponents. Cocoltchos suggests that many of the individuals in Orange County joined the Klan out of that sense of civic activism. The Klan representatives easily won the local election in Anaheim in April 1924. They fired city employees who were known to be Catholic and replaced them with Klan appointees. The new city council tried to enforce Prohibition. After its victory, the Klan chapter held large rallies and initiation ceremonies over the summer. The opposition organized, bribed a Klansman for the secret membership list, and exposed the Klansmen running in the state primaries; they defeated most of the candidates. Klan opponents in 1925 took back local government and succeeded in a special election in recalling the Klansmen who had been elected in April 1924. The Klan in Anaheim quickly collapsed, its newspaper closed after losing a libel suit, and the minister who led the local Klavern moved to Kansas.

In the South, Klan members were still Democratic, as it was essentially a one-party region for whites. Klan chapters were closely allied with Democratic police, sheriffs, and other functionaries of local government. Due to disenfranchisement of most African Americans and many poor whites around the start of the 20th century, the only political activity for whites took place within the Democratic Party.

In Alabama, Klan members advocated better public schools, effective Prohibition enforcement, expanded road construction, and other political measures to benefit lower-class white people. By 1925, the Klan was a political force in the state, as leaders such as J. Thomas Heflin, David Bibb Graves, and Hugo Black tried to build political power against the Black Belt wealthy planters, who had long dominated the state. In 1926, with Klan support, Bibb Graves won the Alabama governor&#x27;s office. He was a former Klan chapter head. He pushed for increased education funding, better public health, new highway construction, and pro-labor legislation. Because the Alabama state legislature refused to redistrict until 1972, and then under court order, the Klan was unable to break the planters&#x27; and rural areas&#x27; hold on legislative power.

Scholars and biographers have recently examined Hugo Black&#x27;s Klan role. Ball finds regarding the KKK that Black &quot;sympathized with the group&#x27;s economic, nativist, and anti-Catholic beliefs&quot;. Newman says Black &quot;disliked the Catholic Church as an institution&quot; and gave over 100 anti-Catholic speeches to KKK meetings across Alabama in his 1926 election campaign. Black was elected US senator in 1926 as a Democrat. In 1937 President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Black to the Supreme Court without knowing how active in the Klan he had been in the 1920s. He was confirmed by his fellow Senators before the full KKK connection was known; Justice Black said he left the Klan when he became a senator.

==== Resistance and decline ====
Many groups and leaders, including prominent Protestant ministers such as Reinhold Niebuhr in Detroit, spoke out against the Klan, gaining national attention. The Jewish Anti-Defamation League of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith was formed in the early 20th century in response to attacks on Jewish Americans, including the lynching of Leo Frank in Atlanta, and to the Klan&#x27;s campaign to prohibit private schools (which was chiefly aimed at Catholic parochial schools). Opposing groups worked to penetrate the Klan&#x27;s secrecy. After one civic group in Indiana began to publish Klan membership lists, there was a rapid decline in the number of Klan members. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) launched public education campaigns in order to inform people about Klan activities and lobbied in Congress against Klan abuses. After its peak in 1925, Klan membership in most areas began to decline rapidly. Specific events contributed to the Klan&#x27;s decline as well. In Indiana, the scandal surrounding the 1925 murder trial of Grand Dragon D. C. Stephenson destroyed the image of the KKK as upholders of law and order. By 1926 the Klan was &quot;crippled and discredited&quot;. D. C. Stephenson was the grand dragon of Indiana and 22 northern states. In 1923 he had led the states under his control in order to break away from the national KKK organization. At his 1925 trial, he was convicted of second-degree murder for his part in the rape, and subsequent death, of Madge Oberholtzer. After Stephenson&#x27;s conviction, the Klan declined dramatically in Indiana.

The historian Leonard Moore says that a failure in leadership caused the Klan&#x27;s collapse:

Stephenson and the other salesmen and office seekers who maneuvered for control of Indiana&#x27;s Invisible Empire lacked both the ability and the desire to use the political system to carry out the Klan&#x27;s stated goals. They were uninterested in, or perhaps even unaware of, grass roots concerns within the movement. For them, the Klan had been nothing more than a means for gaining wealth and power. These marginal men had risen to the top of the hooded order because, until it became a political force, the Klan had never required strong, dedicated leadership. More established and experienced politicians who endorsed the Klan, or who pursued some of the interests of their Klan constituents, also accomplished little. Factionalism created one barrier, but many politicians had supported the Klan simply out of expedience. When charges of crime and corruption began to taint the movement, those concerned about their political futures had even less reason to work on the Klan&#x27;s behalf.

In Alabama, KKK vigilantes launched a wave of physical terror in 1927. They targeted both Black and white people for violations of racial norms and for perceived moral lapses. This led to a strong backlash, beginning in the media. Grover C. Hall Sr., editor of the &quot;Montgomery Advertiser&quot; from 1926, wrote a series of editorials and articles that attacked the Klan. (Today the paper says it &quot;waged war on the resurgent [KKK]&quot;.) Hall won a Pulitzer Prize for the crusade, the 1928 Editorial Writing Pulitzer, citing &quot;his editorials against gangsterism, floggings and racial and religious intolerance&quot;. Other newspapers kept up a steady, loud attack on the Klan, referring to the organization as violent and &quot;un-American&quot;. Sheriffs cracked down on activities. In the 1928 presidential election, the state voters overcame their initial opposition to the Catholic candidate Al Smith and voted the Democratic Party line as usual.

Although in decline, a measure of the Klan&#x27;s influence was still evident when it staged its march along Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., in 1928. By 1930, Klan membership in Alabama dropped to less than 6,000. Small independent units continued to be active in the industrial city of Birmingham.

KKK units were active through the 1930s in parts of Georgia, with a group of &quot;night riders&quot; in Atlanta enforcing their moral views by flogging people who violated them, whites as well as Black people. In March 1940, they were implicated in the beating murders of a young white couple taken from their car on a lovers lane, and flogged a white barber to death for drinking, both in East Point, a suburb of Atlanta. More than 20 others were &quot;brutally flogged&quot;. As the police began to investigate, they found the records of the KKK had disappeared from their East Point office. The cases were reported by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and the NAACP in its &quot;Crisis&quot; magazine, as well as local papers.

In 1940, three lynchings of Black men by whites (no KKK affiliation is known) took place in the South: Elbert Williams was the first NAACP member known to be killed for civil rights activities: he was murdered in Brownsville, Tennessee, for working to register Black people to vote, and several other activists were run out of town; Jesse Thornton was lynched in Luverne, Alabama, for a minor social infraction; and 16-year-old Austin Callaway, a suspect in the assault of a white woman, was taken from jail in the middle of the night and killed by six white men in LaGrange, Georgia. In January 2017, the police chief and mayor of LaGrange apologized for their offices&#x27; failures to protect Callaway, at a reconciliation service marking his death.

=== National changes ===
In 1939, after experiencing several years of decline due to the Great Depression, the Imperial Wizard Hiram Wesley Evans sold the national organization to James A. Colescott, an Indiana veterinary physician, and Samuel Green, an Atlanta obstetrician. They could not revive the Klan&#x27;s declining membership. In 1944, the Internal Revenue Service filed a lien for $685,000 in back taxes against the Klan, and Colescott dissolved the organization by decree on April 23 of that year. Local Klan groups closed down over the following years.

After World War II, the folklorist and author Stetson Kennedy infiltrated the Klan; he provided internal data to media and law enforcement agencies. He also provided secret code words to the writers of the &quot;Superman&quot; radio program, resulting in episodes in which Superman took on a thinly disguised version of the KKK. Kennedy stripped away the Klan&#x27;s mystique and trivialized its rituals and code words, which may have contributed to the decline in Klan recruiting and membership. In the 1950s Kennedy wrote a bestselling book about his experiences, which further damaged the Klan.

==== Historiography of the second Klan ====
The historiography of the second Klan of the 1920s has changed over time. Early histories were based on mainstream sources of the time, but since the late 20th century, other histories have been written drawing from records and analysis of members of the chapters in social histories.

===== Anti-modern interpretations =====

The KKK was a secret organization; apart from a few top leaders, most members never identified as such and wore masks in public. Investigators in the 1920s used KKK publicity, court cases, exposés by disgruntled Klansmen, newspaper reports, and speculation to write stories about what the Klan was doing. Almost all the major national newspapers and magazines were hostile to its activities. The historian Thomas R. Pegram says that published accounts exaggerated the official viewpoint of the Klan leadership and repeated the interpretations of hostile newspapers and the Klan&#x27;s enemies. There was almost no evidence in that time regarding the behavior or beliefs of individual Klansmen. According to Pegram, the resulting popular and scholarly interpretation of the Klan from the 1920s into the mid-20th century emphasized its Southern roots and the violent vigilante-style actions of the Klan in its efforts to turn back the clock of modernity. Scholars compared it to fascism in Europe. Amann states that, &quot;Undeniably, the Klan had some traits in common with European fascism—chauvinism, racism, a mystique of violence, an affirmation of a certain kind of archaic traditionalism—yet their differences were fundamental. ...[The KKK] never envisioned a change of political or economic system.&quot;

Pegram says this original interpretation:

===== New social history interpretations =====
The &quot;social history&quot; revolution in historiography from the 1960s explored history from the bottom up. In terms of the Klan, it developed evidence based on the characteristics, beliefs, and behavior of the typical membership, and downplayed accounts by elite sources. Historians discovered membership lists and the minutes of local meetings from KKK chapters scattered around the country. They discovered that the original interpretation was largely mistaken about the membership and activities of the Klan; the membership was not anti-modern, rural or rustic and consisted of fairly well-educated middle-class joiners and community activists. Half the members lived in the fast-growing industrial cities of the period: Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, Indianapolis, Denver, and Portland, Oregon, were Klan strongholds during the 1920s.

Studies find that in general, the KKK membership in these cities was from the stable, successful middle classes, with few members drawn from the elite or the working classes. Pegram, reviewing the studies, concludes, &quot;the popular Klan of the 1920s, while diverse, was more of a civic exponent of white Protestant social values than a repressive hate group.&quot;

Kelly J. Baker argues that religion was critical—the KKK based its hatred on a particular brand of Protestantism that resonated with mainstream Americans: &quot;Members embraced Protestant Christianity and a crusade to save America from domestic as well as foreign threats.&quot; Member were primarily Baptists, Methodists, and members of the Disciples of Christ, while men of &quot;more elite or liberal&quot; Protestant denominations such as Unitarians, Episcopalians, Congregationalists, and Lutherans, were less likely to join.

===== Indiana =====
In Indiana, traditional political historians focused on notorious leaders, especially D. C. Stephenson, the Grand Dragon of the Indiana Klan, whose conviction for the 1925 kidnap, rape, and murder of Madge Oberholtzer helped destroy the Ku Klux Klan movement nationwide. In his history of 1967, Kenneth T. Jackson described the Klan of the 1920s as associated with cities and urbanization, with chapters often acting as a kind of fraternal organization to aid people coming from other areas.

Social historian Leonard Moore titled his monograph &quot;Citizen Klansmen&quot; (1997) and contrasted the intolerant rhetoric of the group&#x27;s leaders with the actions of most of the membership. The Klan was white Protestant, established Americans who were fearful of change represented by new immigrants and Black migrants to the North. They were highly suspicious of Catholics, Jews and Black people, who they believed subverted ideal, Protestant moral standards. Violence was uncommon in most chapters. In Indiana, KKK members directed more threats and economic blacklisting primarily against fellow white Protestants for transgressions of community moral standards, such as adultery, wife-beating, gambling and heavy drinking. Up to one third of Indiana&#x27;s Protestant men joined the order making it, Moore argued, &quot;a kind of interest group for average white Protestants who believed that their values should be dominant in their community and state.&quot;

Northern Indiana&#x27;s industrial cities had attracted a large Catholic population of European immigrants and their descendants. They established the University of Notre Dame, a major Catholic college near South Bend. In May 1924, when the KKK scheduled a regional meeting in the city, Notre Dame students blocked the Klansmen and stole some KKK regalia. On the next day, the Klansmen counterattacked. Finally, the college president and the football coach Knute Rockne kept the students on campus to avert further violence.

===== Alabama =====
In Alabama, some young, white, urban activists joined the KKK to fight the old guard establishment. Hugo Black was a member before becoming nationally famous; he focused on anti-Catholicism. However, in rural Alabama the Klan continued to operate to enforce Jim Crow laws; its members resorted more often to violence against Black people for infringements of the social order of white supremacy.

Racial terrorism was used in smaller towns to suppress Black political activity. Elbert Williams of Brownsville, Tennessee, was lynched in 1940 for trying to organize Black residents to register and vote; also that year, Jesse Thornton of Luverne, Alabama, was lynched for failing to address a police officer as &quot;Mister&quot;.

=== Later Klans: 1950s–present ===
In 1944, the second KKK was disbanded by Imperial Wizard James A. Colescott after the IRS levied a large tax liability against the organization. In 1946, Samuel Green reestablished the KKK at a ceremony on Stone Mountain. His group primarily operated in Georgia. Green was succeeded by Samuel Roper as Imperial Wizard in 1949, and Roper was succeeded by Eldon Edwards in 1950. Based in Atlanta, Edwards worked to rebuild the organization by uniting the different factions of the KKK from other parts of the United States, but the strength of the organization was short-lived, and the group fractured as it competed with other klan organizations. In 1959, Roy Davis was elected to follow Edwards as national leader. Edwards had previously appointed Davis Grand Dragon of Texas in an effort to unite their two klan organizations. Davis was already leading the Original Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. Davis held rallies Florida and other southern states during 1961 and 1962 recruiting members. Davis had been a close associate of William J. Simmons and been active in the KKK since it first reformed in 1915.

Congress launched an investigation into the KKK in early 1964, following the assassination of John F. Kennedy in Dallas. Davis, based in Dallas, resigned as Imperial Wizard of the Original Knights shortly after the Original Knights received a Congressional subpoena. The Original Knights became increasingly fractured in the immediate aftermath as many members were forced to testify before Congress. The White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan formed in 1964 after splitting from the Original Knights. According to an FBI report published in May 1965, the KKK was divided into 14 different organizations at the time with a total membership of approximately 9,000. The FBI reported that Roy Davis&#x27;s Original Knights was the largest faction and had about 1,500 members. Robert Shelton of Alabama was leading a faction of 400–600 members. Congressional investigators found that by the end of 1965 most members of Original Knights organization joined Shelton&#x27;s United Klans and the Original Knights of the KKK disbanded. Shelton&#x27;s United Klan continued to absorb members from the competing factions and remained the largest Klan group unto the 1970s, peaking with an estimated 30,000 members and another 250,000 non-member supporters during the late 1960s.

==== 1950s–1960s: post-war opposition to civil rights ====
After the decline of the national organization, small independent groups adopted the name &quot;Ku Klux Klan&quot;, along with variations. They had no formal relationships with each other, and most had no connection to the second KKK, except for the fact that they copied its terminology and costumes. Beginning in the 1950s, for instance, individual Klan groups in Birmingham, Alabama, began to resist social change and Black people&#x27;s efforts to improve their lives by bombing houses in transitional neighborhoods. The white men worked in mining and steel industries, with access to these materials. There were so many bombings of Black people&#x27;s homes in Birmingham by Klan groups in the 1950s that the city was nicknamed &quot;Bombingham&quot;.

During the tenure of Bull Connor as police commissioner in Birmingham, Klan groups were closely allied with the police and operated with impunity. When the Freedom Riders arrived in Birmingham in 1961, Connor gave Klan members fifteen minutes to attack the riders before sending in the police to quell the attack. When local and state authorities failed to protect the Freedom Riders and activists, the federal government began to establish intervention and protection. In states such as Alabama and Mississippi, Klan members forged alliances with governors&#x27; administrations. In Birmingham and elsewhere, the KKK groups bombed the houses of civil rights activists. In some cases they used physical violence, intimidation, and assassination directly against individuals. Continuing disfranchisement of Black people across the South meant that most could not serve on juries, which were all-white and demonstrably biased verdicts and sentences.
According to a report from the Southern Regional Council in Atlanta, the homes of 40 Black Southern families were bombed during 1951 and 1952. Some of the bombing victims were social activists whose work exposed them to danger, but most were either people who refused to bow to racist convention or were innocent bystanders, unsuspecting victims of random violence.

Among the more notorious murders by Klan members in the 1950s and 1960s were:
* The 1951 Christmas Eve bombing of the home of National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) activists Harry and Harriette Moore in Mims, Florida, resulting in their deaths.
* The 1957 murder of Willie Edwards Jr., who was forced by Klansmen to jump to his death from a bridge into the Alabama River.
* The 1963 assassination of NAACP organizer Medgar Evers in Mississippi. In 1994, former Ku Klux Klansman Byron De La Beckwith was convicted.
* The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in September 1963 in Birmingham, Alabama, which killed four African American girls and injured 22 people. The perpetrators were Klan members Robert Chambliss, convicted in 1977, Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr. and Bobby Frank Cherry, convicted in 2001 and 2002. The fourth suspect, Herman Cash, died before he was indicted.
* The 1964 murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner, three civil rights workers, in Mississippi. Seven men were convicted of federal civil rights charges in the 1960s. In June 2005, Klan member Edgar Ray Killen was convicted of state manslaughter charges.
* The 1964 murder of two Black teenagers, Henry Hezekiah Dee and Charles Eddie Moore in Mississippi. In August 2007, based on the confession of Klansman Charles Marcus Edwards, James Ford Seale, a reputed Ku Klux Klansman, was convicted. Seale was sentenced to serve three life sentences. Seale, who died in prison in 2011, was a former Mississippi policeman and sheriff&#x27;s deputy.
* The 1965 Alabama murder of Viola Liuzzo. She was a Southern-raised Detroit mother of five who was visiting the state in order to attend a civil rights march. At the time of her murder, Liuzzo was transporting Civil Rights marchers related to the Selma to Montgomery March.
* The 1966 firebombing death of NAACP leader Vernon Dahmer Sr., 58, in Mississippi. In 1998 former Ku Klux Klan wizard Samuel Bowers was convicted of his murder and sentenced to life. Two other Klan members were indicted with Bowers, but one died before trial and the other&#x27;s indictment was dismissed.
* In July 1966, in Bogalusa, Louisiana, a stronghold of Klan activity, Clarence Triggs was found murdered.
* The 1967 multiple bombings in Jackson, Mississippi, of the residence of a Methodist activist, Robert Kochtitzky, the synagogue, and the residence of Rabbi Perry Nussbaum. These were carried out by Klan member Thomas Albert Tarrants III, who was convicted in 1968. Another Klan bombing was averted in Meridian the same year.

==== Resistance ====
There was considerable resistance among African Americans and white allies to the Klan. In 1953, newspaper publishers W. Horace Carter (Tabor City, North Carolina), who had campaigned for three years, and Willard Cole (Whiteville, North Carolina) shared the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service citing &quot;their successful campaign against the Ku Klux Klan, waged on their own doorstep at the risk of economic loss and personal danger, culminating in the conviction of over one hundred Klansmen and an end to terrorism in their communities&quot;. In a 1958 incident in North Carolina, the Klan burned crosses at the homes of two Lumbee Native Americans for associating with white people, and threatened more actions. When the KKK held a nighttime rally nearby, they were quickly surrounded by hundreds of armed Lumbee. Gunfire was exchanged, and the Klan was routed at what became known as the Battle of Hayes Pond.

While the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had paid informants in the Klan (for instance, in Birmingham in the early 1960s), its relations with local law enforcement agencies and the Klan were often ambiguous. The head of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, appeared more concerned about Communist links to civil rights activists than about controlling Klan excesses against citizens. In 1964, the FBI&#x27;s COINTELPRO program began attempts to infiltrate and disrupt civil rights groups.

As 20th-century Supreme Court rulings extended federal enforcement of citizens&#x27; civil rights, the government revived the Enforcement Acts and the Klan Act from Reconstruction days. Federal prosecutors used these laws as the basis for investigations and indictments in the 1964 murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner; and the 1965 murder of Viola Liuzzo. They were also the basis for prosecution in 1991 in &quot;Bray v. Alexandria Women&#x27;s Health Clinic&quot;.

In 1965, the House Un-American Activities Committee started an investigation on the Klan, putting in the public spotlight its front organizations, finances, methods and divisions.

==== 1970s–present ====

After federal legislation was passed prohibiting legal segregation and authorizing enforcement of protection of voting rights, KKK groups began to oppose court-ordered busing to desegregate schools, affirmative action, and the more open immigration authorized in the 1960s. In 1971, KKK members used bombs to destroy 10 school buses in Pontiac, Michigan. By 1975, there were known KKK groups on most college campuses in Louisiana as well as at Vanderbilt University, the University of Georgia, the University of Mississippi, the University of Akron, and the University of Southern California.

===== Massacre of Communist Workers&#x27; Party protesters =====
On November 3, 1979, five communist protesters were killed by KKK and American Nazi Party members in Greensboro, North Carolina, in what is known as the Greensboro massacre. The Communist Workers&#x27; Party had sponsored a rally against the Klan in an effort to organize predominantly Black industrial workers in the area. Klan members drove up with arms in their car trunks, and attacked marchers.

===== Jerry Thompson infiltration =====
Jerry Thompson, a newspaper reporter who infiltrated the KKK in 1979, reported that the FBI&#x27;s COINTELPRO efforts were highly successful. Rival KKK factions accused each other&#x27;s leaders of being FBI informants. William Wilkinson of the Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, was revealed to have been working for the FBI.

Thompson also related that KKK leaders showed great concern about a series of civil lawsuits filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center, claiming damages amounting to millions of dollars. These were filed after KKK members shot into a group of African Americans. Klansmen curtailed their activities in order to conserve money for defense against the lawsuits. The KKK also used lawsuits as tools; they filed a libel suit in order to prevent the publication of a paperback edition of Thompson&#x27;s book but were unsuccessful.

===== Chattanooga shooting =====
In 1980, three KKK members shot four elderly Black women (Viola Ellison, Lela Evans, Opal Jackson, and Katherine Johnson) in Chattanooga, Tennessee, following a KKK initiation rally. A fifth woman, Fannie Crumsey, was injured by flying glass in the incident. Attempted murder charges were filed against the three KKK members, two of whom—Bill Church and Larry Payne—were acquitted by an all-white jury. The third defendant, Marshall Thrash, was sentenced by the same jury to nine months on lesser charges. He was released after three months. In 1982, a jury awarded the five women $535,000 in a civil trial.

===== Michael Donald lynching =====
After Michael Donald was lynched in 1981 in Alabama, the FBI investigated his death. The US attorney prosecuted the case. Two local KKK members were convicted for his murder, including Henry Francis Hays who was sentenced to death. After exhausting the appeals process, Hays was executed by electric chair for Donald&#x27;s death in Alabama on June 6, 1997. It was the first time since 1913 that a white person had been executed in Alabama for a crime against a black person.

With the support of attorneys Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) and state senator Michael A. Figures, Donald&#x27;s mother Beulah Mae Donald sued the KKK in civil court in Alabama. Her lawsuit against the United Klans of America was tried in February 1987. The all-white jury found the Klan responsible for the lynching of Donald, and ordered the Klan to pay US$7 million, but the KKK did not have sufficient funds to pay the fine. They had to sell off their national headquarters building in Tuscaloosa.

===== Neo-Nazi alliances and Stormfront =====

In 1995, Don Black and Chloê Hardin, the ex-wife of the KKK grand wizard David Duke, began a small bulletin board system (BBS) called Stormfront, which has become a prominent online forum for white nationalism, Neo-Nazism, hate speech, racism, and antisemitism in the early 21st century.

In a 2007 article by the ADL, it was reported that many KKK groups had formed strong alliances with other white supremacist groups, such as neo-Nazis. Some KKK groups have become increasingly &quot;nazified&quot;, adopting the look and emblems of white power skinheads.

===== Current developments =====
The modern KKK is not one organization; rather, it is composed of small independent chapters across the United States. According to a 1999 ADL report, the KKK&#x27;s estimated size then was &quot;No more than a few thousand, organized into slightly more than 100 units&quot;. In 2017, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which monitors extremist groups, estimated that there were &quot;at least 29 separate, rival Klan groups currently active in the United States, and they compete with one another for members, dues, news media attention and the title of being the true heir to the Ku Klux Klan&quot;. The formation of independent chapters has made KKK groups more difficult to infiltrate, and researchers find it hard to estimate their numbers. Analysts believe that about two-thirds of KKK members are concentrated in the Southern United States, with another third situated primarily in the lower Midwest.

For some time, the Klan&#x27;s numbers have been steadily dropping. This decline has been attributed to the Klan&#x27;s lack of competence in the use of the Internet, their history of violence, a proliferation of competing hate groups, and a decline in the number of young racist activists who are willing to join groups at all.

In 2015, the number of KKK chapters nationwide grew from 72 to 190. The SPLC released a similar report stating that &quot;there were significant increases in Klan as well as Black separatist groups&quot;.

A 2016 analysis by the SPLC found that hate groups in general were on the rise in the United States. The ADL published a report in 2016 that concluded: &quot;Despite a persistent ability to attract media attention, organized Ku Klux Klan groups are actually continuing a long-term trend of decline. They remain a collection of mostly small, disjointed groups that continually change in name and leadership.&quot;

Recent KKK membership campaigns have exploited people&#x27;s anxieties about illegal immigration, urban crime, and same-sex marriage. In 2006, J. Keith Akins argued that &quot;Klan literature and propaganda is rabidly homophobic and encourages violence against gays and lesbians. ...Since the late 1970s, the Klan has increasingly focused its ire on this previously ignored population.&quot; The Klan has produced Islamophobic propaganda and distributed anti-Islamic flyers.

The American Civil Liberties Union has provided legal support to various factions of the KKK in defense of their First Amendment rights to hold public rallies, parades, and marches, as well as their right to field political candidates.
The February 14, 2019, edition of the Linden, Alabama, weekly newspaper &quot;The Democrat-Reporter&quot; carried an editorial titled &quot;Klan needs to ride again&quot; written by Goodloe Sutton—the newspaper&#x27;s owner, publisher and editor—which urged the Klan to return to staging their night rides, because proposals were being made to raise taxes in the state. In an interview, Sutton suggested that Washington, D.C., could be &quot;clean[ed] out&quot; by way of lynchings. &quot;We&#x27;ll get the hemp ropes out, loop them over a tall limb and hang all of them,&quot; Sutton said. He also specified that he was only referring to hanging &quot;socialist-communists&quot; and compared the Klan to the NAACP. The editorial and Sutton&#x27;s subsequent comments provoked calls for his resignation from Alabama politicians and the Alabama Press Association, which later censured Sutton and suspended the newspaper&#x27;s membership. In addition, the University of Southern Mississippi&#x27;s School of Communication removed Sutton—who is an alumnus of that school—from its Mass Communication and Journalism Hall of Fame, and &quot;strongly condemns&quot; his remarks. Sutton was also stripped of a distinguished community journalism award he had been presented in 2009 by Auburn University&#x27;s Journalism Advisory Council. Sutton expressed no regret and said that the editorial was intended to be &quot;ironic&quot;, but that &quot;not many people understand irony today.&quot;

===== Current Klan organizations =====
A list is maintained by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL):
* Bayou Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, prevalent in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, and other areas of the Southern U.S.
* Church of the American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
* Imperial Klans of America
* Knights of the White Camelia
* Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, headed by national director and self-claimed pastor Thomas Robb, and based in Harrison and Zinc, Arkansas. It claims to be the largest Klan organization in America today.
* Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, a North Carolina-based group headed by Will Quigg, is currently thought to be the largest KKK chapter.
* White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan

== Outside the United States and Canada ==
Aside from the Ku Klux Klan in Canada, there have been various attempts to organize KKK chapters outside the United States in places such as: Asia, Europe and Oceania, with negligible results.

=== Africa ===
In apartheid South Africa in the 1960s, some far-right activists copied KKK actions, for example by writing &quot;Ku Klux Klan Africa&quot; on the ANC Cape Town offices or by wearing their costumes. In response, American Klan leader Terry Venable attempted to establish a branch at Rhodes University.

In the 1970s, Rhodesia had a Ku Klux Klan, led by Len Idensohn, attacking Ian Smith for his perceived moderation.

=== Americas ===
On 1924 vigilantes claimed to have organized themselves into a Klan against &quot;criminals&quot;, publishing a program of &quot;social epuration&quot;.

In São Paulo, Brazil, the website of a group called Imperial Klans of Brazil was shut down in 2003, and the group&#x27;s leader was arrested.

The Klan has also been established in the Canal Zone.

The Klan was present in Cuba, under the name of Ku Klux Klan Kubano, directed against both West Indian migrant workers and Afro-Cuban and using the fear of the 1912 Negro Rebellion.

=== Asia ===
During the Vietnam War, klaverns were established on some US military bases, often tolerated by military authorities.

In the 1920s, the Klan briefly existed in Shanghai.

=== Europe ===
Recruitment activity has also been reported in the United Kingdom. In the 1960s, &quot;klaverns&quot; were established in the Midlands, the following decade saw visits by leading Klansmen, and the 1990s saw recruitment drives in London, Scotland and the Midlands and huge internal turmoil and splintering: for example a leader, Allan Beshella, had to resign after a 1972 conviction for child sex abuse was revealed. In 2018, Klan-clad far-right activists marched in front of a Northern Irish mosque.

In Germany, a KKK-related group, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Knights of the Fiery Cross&quot;), was established in 1925 by returning naturalized German-born US citizens in Berlin who managed to gather around 300 persons of middle-class occupations such as merchants and clerks. It soon saw the original founders being removed by internal conflicts, and mocking newspapers about the affair. After the Nazis took over Germany, the group disbanded and its members joined the Nazis. In 1991, Dennis Mahon, then of Oklahoma&#x27;s White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, reportedly helped to organize Klan groups. Another German KKK-related group, the European White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, has organized and it gained notoriety in 2012 when the German media reported that two police officers who held membership in the organization would be allowed to keep their jobs. In 2019, the German authorities conducted raids against a possibly dangerous group called National Socialist Knights of the Ku Klux Klan Deutschland.

In 2001, David Duke came to Moscow to network with local anti-Semitic Russian nationalists. Duke said that Russia was &quot;the key to white survival&quot; and blamed most of the events of the 20th century Russian history on the Jews.

In the 1920s, the Klan was rumoured to exist in Lithuania and Czechoslovakia.

=== Oceania ===
In Australia in the late 1990s, former One Nation member Peter Coleman established branches throughout the country, and circa 2012 the KKK has attempted to infiltrate other political parties such as Australia First. Branches of the Klan have previously existed in New South Wales and Victoria, as well as allegedly in Queensland. Unlike in the United States, the Australian branches did not require members to be Christian, but did require them to be white.

A Ku Klux Klan group was established in Fiji in 1874 by white American and British settlers wanting to enact White supremacy, although its operations were quickly put to an end by the British who, although not officially yet established as the major authority of Fiji, had played a leading role in establishing a new constitutional monarchy, the Kingdom of Fiji, that was being threatened by the activities of the Fijian Klan, which owned fortresses and artillery. By March, it had become the &quot;British Subjects&#x27; Mutual Protection Society&quot;, which included Francis Herbert Dufty.

In the 1920s, the Klan had been rumoured to exist in New Zealand.

== Titles and vocabulary ==

Membership in the Klan is secret. Like many fraternal organizations, the Klan uses signs and coded language that members can use to recognize one another. In conversation, a member may use the acronym &quot;AYAK&quot; (Are you a Klansman?) to surreptitiously identify themselves to another potential member. The response &quot;AKIA&quot; (A Klansman, I am.) completes the greeting.

Throughout its varied history, the Klan has coined many words beginning with &quot;Kl&quot;, including:
* Klabeetreasurers
* Klavernlocal organization
* Imperial Kleaglerecruiter
* Klecktokeninitiation fee
* Kligrappsecretary
* Klonvokationgathering
* Kloranritual book
* Kloreroedelegate
* Imperial Kluddchaplain

All of the above terminology was created by William Joseph Simmons, as part of his 1915 revival of the Klan. The Reconstruction-era Klan used different titles; the only titles to carry over were &quot;Wizard&quot; for the overall leader of the Klan and &quot;Night Hawk&quot; for the official in charge of security.

The Imperial Kludd was the chaplain of the Imperial Klonvocation and he performed &quot;such other duties as may be required by the Imperial Wizard&quot;.

The Imperial Kaliff was the second-highest position, after the imperial wizard.

== Symbols ==
The Ku Klux Klan has utilized a variety of symbols over its history.

=== Blood Drop Cross ===
The most identifiable symbol used by the Klan for the past century has been the &quot;Mystic Insignia of a Klansman&quot;, commonly known as the &quot;Blood Drop Cross&quot;, a white cross on a red disk with what appears to be a blood drop in the middle. It was first used in the early 1900s, with the symbol in the center originally appearing as a red and white yin-yang which in the subsequent years, lost the white part and was reinterpreted as a &quot;blood drop&quot;.

=== Triangular Klan symbol ===
The Triangular Ku Klux Klan symbol is made of what looks like a triangle inside a triangle, similar to a Sierpiński triangle, but in fact represents three letter Ks interlocked and facing inward, referencing the name of the group. A variation on this symbol has the K&#x27;s facing outwards instead of inwards. It is an old Klan symbol that has also been resurrected as a modern-day hate symbol.

=== Burning cross ===

Although predating the Klan, in modern times the symbol of the burning cross has become almost solely associated with the Ku Klux Klan and has become one of the most potent hate symbols in the United States. Burning crosses did not become associated with the Klan until Thomas Dixon&#x27;s &quot;The Clansman&quot;, and its film adaptation, D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; inspired members of the second Klan to take up the practice. In the modern day, the symbol of the burning cross is so associated with racial intimidation that it is used by many non-Klan racist elements and has spread to locations outside the United States.

<text>King Kong is a 1933 American pre-Code adventure horror monster film directed and produced by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, with special effects by Willis H. O&#x27;Brien and music by Max Steiner. Produced and distributed by RKO Radio Pictures, it is the first film in the &quot;King Kong&quot; franchise. The film stars Fay Wray, Robert Armstrong, and Bruce Cabot. The film follows a giant ape dubbed Kong who feels affection for a beautiful young woman offered to him as a sacrifice.

&quot;King Kong&quot; opened in New York City on March 2, 1933, to rave reviews, with praise for its stop-motion animation and score. In 1991, it was deemed &quot;culturally, historically and aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. In 2010 it was ranked by Rotten Tomatoes as the greatest horror film of all time and the fifty-sixth greatest film of all time. A sequel, &quot;Son of Kong,&quot; was made the same year as the original film, and several more films have been made, including two remakes in 1976 and 2005. The characters and story have since entered the public domain; the film&#x27;s copyright is set to expire in 2029.

==Plot==

In New York Harbor, filmmaker Carl Denham, known for wildlife films in remote exotic locations, is chartering Captain Englehorn&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Venture,&quot; for his new project. However, he is unable to secure an actress for a female role he has been reluctant to disclose. In the streets of New York City, he finds struggling actress Ann Darrow and promises her &quot;the thrill of a lifetime&quot;. The &quot;Venture&quot; sets off, during which Denham reveals that their destination is an uncharted island with a mountain the shape of a skull. He alludes to a mysterious entity named Kong, rumored to dwell on the island. The crew arrive and anchor offshore. They encounter a native village separated from the rest of the island by an enormous stone wall with a large wooden gate. They witness a group of natives preparing to sacrifice a young woman termed the &quot;bride of Kong&quot;. The intruders are spotted and the native chief stops the ceremony. When he sees the blonde-haired Ann, he offers to trade six of his tribal women for the &quot;golden woman&quot;. They refuse him and return to the ship.

That night, after the ship&#x27;s first mate, Jack Driscoll, admits his love for Ann, the natives kidnap Ann from the ship and take her through the gate and onto an altar. There she is offered to Kong, who is revealed to be a giant gorilla. Kong carries a terrified Ann away as Denham, Jack, and some crewmen give chase. The men encounter living dinosaurs; they manage to kill a charging &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;, but are attacked by an aggressive &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; and eventually Kong himself, leaving Jack and Denham as the only survivors. After Kong slays a &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; to save Ann, Jack continues to follow them while Denham returns to the village. Upon arriving in Kong&#x27;s mountain lair, Ann is menaced by a serpent-like &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;, which Kong also kills. When a &quot;Pteranodon&quot; tries to fly away with Ann, and is killed by Kong, Jack saves her and they climb down a vine dangling from a cliff ledge. When Kong starts pulling them back up, the two drop into the water below; they flee through the jungle back to the village, where Denham, Englehorn, and the surviving crewmen await. Kong, following, breaks open the gate and relentlessly rampages through the village. Onshore, Denham, determined to bring Kong back alive, renders him unconscious with a gas bomb.

Shackled in chains, Kong is taken to New York City and presented to a Broadway theatre audience as &quot;King Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World!&quot; Ann and Jack join him on stage, surrounded by press photographers. The ensuing flash photography causes Kong to break loose as the audience flees in terror. Ann is whisked away to a hotel room on a high floor, but Kong, scaling the building, reclaims her. He makes his way through the city with Ann in his grasp, wrecking a crowded elevated train and begins climbing the Empire State Building. Jack suggests that airplanes shoot Kong off the building without hitting Ann. Four biplanes take off; seeing the planes arrive, Jack becomes agitated for Ann&#x27;s safety and rushes inside with Denham. At the top, Kong is shot at by the planes and he swats at them. Kong destroys one, but is wounded by the gunfire. After he gazes at Ann, he is shot more, loses his strength, and plummets to the streets below to his death. Jack reunites with Ann. Denham heads back down and is allowed through a crowd surrounding Kong&#x27;s corpse in the street. When a policeman remarks that the planes got him, Denham states, &quot;Oh, no, it wasn&#x27;t the airplanes. It was Beauty killed the Beast&quot;.

===Development===

&quot;King Kong&quot; producer Ernest B. Schoedsack had earlier experience filming monkeys while directing &quot;&quot; (1927), also with Merian C. Cooper, and &quot;Rango&quot; (1931), both of which prominently featured monkeys in authentic jungle settings. Capitalizing on this trend, Congo Pictures released the hoax documentary &quot;Ingagi&quot; (1930), advertising the film as &quot;an authentic incontestable celluloid document showing the sacrifice of a living woman to mammoth gorillas.&quot; &quot;Ingagi&quot; is now often recognized as a racial exploitation film as it implicitly depicted black women having sex with gorillas and baby offspring that looked more ape than human. The film was an immediate hit, and by some estimates, it was one of the highest-grossing films of the 1930s at over $4 million. Although Cooper never listed &quot;Ingagi&quot; among his influences for &quot;King Kong,&quot; it has long been held that RKO greenlighted &quot;Kong&quot; because of the bottom-line example of &quot;Ingagi&quot; and the formula that &quot;gorillas plus sexy women in peril equals enormous profits.&quot;

Since 1929 Cooper had wanted to create a film about gorillas. Inspired by the travels of his friend W. Douglas Burden, Cooper considered filming in the jungles of Komodo. He had read Burden&#x27;s &quot;The Dragon Lizards of Komodo&quot; and as a result conceived the idea to film a gorilla fighting giant lizards. Cooper later remarked that this was &quot;the most important influence&quot; on the final film. By the time he joined RKO in 1931, Cooper decided to incorporate a &quot;beauty and the beast&quot; theme into the plot. The &quot;Arabian proverb&quot; at the beginning of the film was created by Cooper: &quot;And lo! The Beast looked upon the face of Beauty, and it stayed its hand from killing. And from that day, it was as one dead.&quot; Initially Cooper planned to film in Africa and Komodo Island, but the idea was abandoned when RKO executives decided it would be too expensive. RKO was at risk for bankruptcy because of the Great Depression. Stop-motion animator Willis O&#x27;Brien, hearing that Cooper wanted to make a gorilla film, painted a picture depicting a large gorilla carrying a woman and gave it to Cooper. Afterward Cooper requested a test reel, which was approved by Selznick. O&#x27;Brien experimented with different scenes in the test reel. These two scenes, which were incorporated into the final film, portray a fight between King Kong and a Tyrannosaurus Rex as well as Kong shaking men off a log. The test reel was created concurrently with the production of &quot;The Most Dangerous Game.&quot; Meanwhile, Cooper hired actors and had sets built for &quot;King Kong&quot;. For live-action sequences in the jungle, Cooper utilized the set of &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot;. Cooper directed the live-action sequences until Schoedsack completed work on &quot;The Most Dangerous Game.&quot; Afterward Shoedsack directed the live action scenes while Cooper focused on the live action scenes that were to be combined with the already-filmed animated sequences. while Marcel Delgado developed sample models of King Kong, the dinosaurs, and the people; the models did not have armatures. After about three months the test reel was complete. After studio executives approved the film for production, Cooper developed the story further. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s ideas also helped with story development. He suggested that King Kong be seen by the characters as a sort of deity. 

Filming commenced without a complete screenplay. Cooper hired Edgar Wallace to write the screenplay, which he started in December 1931. Cooper told Wallace what he wanted included in the script. Wallace&#x27;s draft included several instances of attempted sexual assault, which were later removed by Ruth Rose. His draft also included racial tensions between characters. While drafting he wrote, &quot;I am hoping still to get a good horror picture without corpses, and I am certain that &quot;Kong&quot; is going to be a wow.&quot; Wallace had a rough draft ready in January 1932 and died a month later&quot;.&quot; Some of his ideas ended up in the final film, such as Kong removing Ann&#x27;s clothes from her body. He also roughly outlined the New York scenes, which were similar to how they appeared in the completed film, as well as a jungle chase scene. James A. Creelman picked up work on the screenplay. In his draft he changed character roles, making Denham Ann&#x27;s cruel uncle. Cooper disliked it, remarking that &quot;The heavy is far too heavy.&quot; Creelman adapted Wallace&#x27;s jungle chase scene to appear as it does in the finished film. Creelman found it difficult to meet Cooper&#x27;s plot requests, feeling that there were too many fantastical elements for the film to be believable. He objected, &quot;[T]here is certainly such a thing as reaching a limit to the number of elements a story can contain and make sense.&quot; Though he incorporated Cooper&#x27;s requests, the dialogue proved to be too extensive. Cooper was unsatisfied with Creelman&#x27;s work, and in June Creelman decided to quit. After some difficulty finding a replacement for Creelman, in July Cooper hired Ruth Rose, who had never written a screenplay before. She rewrote the majority of Creelman&#x27;s dialogue. Though Creelman initially wrote the film&#x27;s New York prologue, Rose polished it while writing most of the city scenes. Rose was able to incorporate the love story between Ann and Jack, something the other screenwriters had struggled with. Rose also added more &quot;fairy tale-like&quot; aspects. Upon the film&#x27;s release Wallace was credited with the screenplay, as Cooper had promised to give him the credit. The studio also saw it as an opportunity to gain positive publicity because Wallace was a well-established writer.

==== Copyright concerns ====
The creators of &quot;King Kong&quot; took inspiration from other films such as &quot;Dracula&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. The influence was heavy enough that RKO executives were worried about copyright violation. Executives discussed the potential issue with RKO&#x27;s lawyers. Also among their concerns were the film&#x27;s connections to &quot;Ingagi&quot;, &quot;Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;, &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;, and &quot;The Lost World&quot;. The other works being ruled out, Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The Lost World&quot; posed the most concern. Both &quot;The Lost World&quot; and &quot;King Kong&quot; concerned primitive creatures being taken to modern society. Even though Cooper argued against the similarities, the studio purchased the novel&#x27;s copyright. Afterward Cooper feared that if the studio were to connect Doyle&#x27;s name to the film for promotional purposes, consumers might not think the film was fresh. Eventually the Doyle estate granted the studio permission to not associate the film with Doyle&#x27;s name.

===Special effects===

&quot;King Kong&quot; is well known for its groundbreaking use of special effects, such as stop-motion animation, matte painting, rear projection, and miniatures, all of which were conceived decades before the digital age. The prehistoric creatures inhabiting Skull Island were brought to life through the use of stop-motion animation by Willis H. O&#x27;Brien and his assistant animators, E. B. &quot;Buzz&quot; Gibson, Carroll Shepphird, Marcel Delgado, Orville Goldner, and Fred Reefe. The stop-motion animation scenes were painstaking and difficult to achieve and complete. The special effects crew could not leave the studio during the day because the lighting would not be consistent. The jungle scenery was created by layering glass paintings, which were created by Mario Larrinaga and Byron L. Crabbe. They were used when Denham&#x27;s crew first arrives. The scene was composited with separate bird elements and rear-projected behind the ship and actors.

The most difficult task for the special effects crew to achieve was to make live-action footage interact with separately filmed stop-motion animation, making the interaction between the humans and the creatures seem believable. The most simple of these effects were accomplished by exposing part of the frame, then running the same piece of the film through the camera again by exposing the other part of the frame with a different image. This process is called a matte. The most complex shots, where the live-action actors interacted with the stop-motion animation, were achieved via two different techniques, the Dunning process and the Williams process, to produce the effect of a traveling matte.

 Another technique that was used in combining live actors and stop-motion animation was rear-screen projection. The actor would have a translucent screen behind him where a projector would project footage onto the back of the translucent screen. This was the first film for which RKO used the method. It was used in the scene where Kong and the &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; fight while Ann watches from the branches of a nearby tree. The stop-motion animation was filmed first. Afterward Fay Wray spent a 22-hour period sitting in a fake tree acting out her observation of the battle, which was projected onto the translucent screen while the camera filmed her witnessing the projected stop-motion battle. She was sore for days after the shoot. The same process was also used for the scene where sailors from the &quot;Venture&quot; kill a Stegosaurus. O&#x27;Brien and his special effects crew also devised a way to use rear projection in miniature sets. A tiny screen was built into the miniature onto which live-action footage would then be projected. A fan was used to prevent the footage that was projected from melting or catching fire. This miniature rear projection was used in the scene where Kong tries to grab Driscoll, who is hiding in a cave. For the scene in which Kong places Ann in a tree, Wray acted out her sequences as Kong&#x27;s sequences were projected in the rear. She was unable to clearly see the projected images and had to act based on the blurs she saw. Animation for the film was completed after 55 weeks.

Cooper, wishing to create a point of authenticity, insisted that Kong not be played by an actor in a gorilla suit. Over the years, some media reports have alleged that in certain scenes Kong was played by an actor wearing a gorilla suit. However, film historians have generally agreed that all scenes involving Kong were achieved with animated models. These models were about 14-18 inches in height. They were made of metal armatures padded with cotton, latex, and rabbit fur. The fur moved as the animators handled the models, becoming an unintentional feature of Kong. The models required maintenance after each day of filming. Closeups of Kong&#x27;s face and upper body were accomplished by filming a full-size mechanical model of Kong&#x27;s head and shoulders, designed by Delgado. The model, scaled to the dimensions of a fifty-foot creature, was covered with forty bearskins. Six operators were required to manipulate the eyes and mouth to simulate a living monster. A proportionally large arm and paw were also created for closeup shots of Kong holding Ann. Dinosaur models were reused from O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s aborted film project &quot;Creation.&quot; Production was completed in January 1933. Production costs added up to $672,254.75, part of which included costs for &quot;Creation&quot;.

===Sound effects and score===
Murray Spivack developed the sound effects for the film. Kong&#x27;s roar was created by mixing the recorded vocals of lions and tigers and slowly playing them backward. Spivak himself provided Kong&#x27;s &quot;love grunts&quot; by grunting into a megaphone and playing it at a slow speed. For Kong&#x27;s footsteps, Spivak stomped across a gravel-filled box with plungers attached to his feet and wrapped in foam. The sounds of Kong&#x27;s chest beats are recordings of Spivak hitting his assistant, who had a microphone held to his back, on the chest with a drumstick. Spivak created the hisses and croaks of the dinosaurs with an air compressor for the former and his own vocals for the latter. The vocalizations of the Tyrannosaurus were additionally mixed in with puma growls. Spivak also provided the screams of the various sailors. Fay Wray herself provided all of her character&#x27;s screams in a single recording session. Wray explained that afterward she &quot;couldn&#x27;t speak even in a whisper for days&quot;. Her screams have been used in other movies such as &quot;Son of Kong&quot; and &quot;Game of Death&quot;.

Even though funding for the film was nearly gone, Cooper and Schoedsack decided it needed an original score because they worried that Kong might be too unbelievable as a character and also did not want to use a generic soundtrack. They hired Max Steiner for the job. Steiner began composing the score on December 9, 1932, and completed it after eight weeks. The orchestra comprised 46 members, but upon recording sounded so full it is sometimes described as having 80 members. A 46-member orchestra was large compared to many other film orchestras of the time. According to Steiner, Cooper paid him $50,000 of his own money to pay for the orchestra.

Steiner decided to make the music, in his own words, &quot;impressionistic and terrifying&quot;. During composition he took inspiration from Debussy and Ravel, specifically for the music that was to play during the ocean scene when Denham and his crew travel to Skull Island. During this scene &quot;Boat in the Fog&quot; begins to play; the harp reflects the waves and the stringed instruments reflect of the fog. Steiner also incorporated dissonance into the score for action scenes, such as when Kong falls to his death. Laurence MacDonald explains that this dissonance is also reflective of Debussy&#x27;s compositions. The ocean scene is the first instance in which music begins to play. This is because Steiner wanted an association between music and the film&#x27;s fantasy elements. Music historian Michael Slowik suggests that such an association invokes a sense of the unfamiliar, also pointing out that music is connected to the audience&#x27;s need to suspend belief. Music does not play during Kong&#x27;s fight with the T-rex and is replaced by animal sounds, making it the only Skull Island scene without music. Music plays in the later New York City scenes except for when the airplanes surround Kong. One of the techniques that Steiner often wrote into the score is called mickey-mousing. MacDonald dubs it &quot;perhaps the single most noteworthy aspect of Steiner&#x27;s score&quot;. According to Slowik, the score includes more mickey-mousing than other film scores of its period. He remarks that its &quot;obsessive mickey-mousing&quot; is reminiscent of the music that would play for a cartoon rather than for a Hollywood production. In one scene the chief of the island people walks toward Denham&#x27;s group and the music aligns with his steps. The score also reflects actions happening off-screen, such as when Kong walks toward the altar where Ann is to be offered to him. Formerly, this technique had been used for silent films.

Slowik identifies three musical themes throughout the score: Kong&#x27;s theme, Ann&#x27;s theme, and the jungle theme. Steiner took inspiration from Wagner in creating Kong&#x27;s theme. Steiner used a method called chromaticism in Kong&#x27;s theme, which comprises three descending notes. According to Peter Franklin, the other themes stem from the three-note sequence in Kong&#x27;s theme. &quot;King Kong March&quot;, a Broadway-style score played during Denham&#x27;s show, is an adaptation of Kong&#x27;s theme, though the notes ascend rather than descend. Ann&#x27;s theme (&quot;Stolen Love&quot;) is a Viennese waltz and begins with notes similar to those in Kong&#x27;s theme. Steiner eventually combined both themes in one song just before Kong dies. Musician biographer Steven C. Smith identifies what he calls the &quot;danger theme&quot;. It is written with four notes and is meant to sound &quot;questioning&quot;. It first appears in &quot;The Forgotten Island&quot;. Later, it is reworked into a major key when Driscoll confesses his love for Ann. Smith suggests that this points to what he calls &quot;the perils of romance&quot;. Later in life Cooper expressed that &quot;much of the reason for [&quot;King Kong&quot;&#x27;s success] is because Maxie Steiner was able to create what no other man that I knew of in Hollywood at that time could&quot;. Steiner himself remarked that the film &quot;was made for music&quot;.

Upon the film&#x27;s release its score received little critical review, being overshadowed by the film&#x27;s innovations in special effects. However, it received more attention as the movie became more famous in the years that followed. Christopher Palmer wrote that the score &quot;marked the real beginnings of Hollywood music&quot;. Mervyn Cooke adds that it &quot;almost single-handedly marked the coming-of-age of nondiegetic film music&quot;. In his book &quot;After the Silents: Hollywood Film Music in the Early Sound Era, 1926-1934,&quot; Slowik argues that &quot;King Kong&quot;&#x27;s score did not influence Hollywood film scores that many music scholars think it did. He suggests that, because the movie was unusual, the score was unable to introduce an alternate way to write film scores. He also suggests that Steiner drew upon already-established patterns of Hollywood music. He writes that rather than single-handedly shaping the Golden Age of Hollywood music, King Kong is just one film among others that helped shape it. Slowik explains that the score features both &quot;original and symphonic music&quot;, something that was not common in film scores of the time. Portions of the score were reused in &quot;Double Harness&quot;, &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot;, and &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;, among others. The island music appears as an orchestra scene in Jackson&#x27;s 2005 remake. Over the years, Steiner&#x27;s score was recorded by multiple record labels and the original motion picture soundtrack has been issued on a compact disc.

==Release and censorship==
===Initial release and box office===

King Kong’s campaign included newspaper ads, radio ads, and posters. It premiered in the Radio City Music Hall and RKO Roxy in New York City on March 2, 1933. U. S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared the four-day nationwide bank holiday three days after the film&#x27;s premiere in New York City. The film was a box-office success and during the opening weekend earned an estimated $90,000. Receipts fell by up to 50% during the second week of the film&#x27;s release because of the national bank holiday. Attendance of the film dropped within the second and third weeks of its New York release. During the film&#x27;s first run it made a profit of $650,000. Before the 1952 re-release, the film is reported to have worldwide rentals of $2,847,000 including $1,070,000 from the United States and Canada and profits of $1,310,000. The Hollywood premiere was held on March 24, 1933, in Grauman’s Chinese Theatre. The screening was preceded by a performance featuring dances of Indigenous people and trapeze performances. It was not officially released until April 7, 1933. It was re-released in 1952 following the promising re-release of &quot;Snow White&quot;. After the 1952 re-release, &quot;Variety&quot; estimated the film had earned an additional $1.6 million in the United States and Canada, bringing its total to $3.9 million in cumulative rentals in the United States. Profits from the re-release were estimated by the studio to be at about $2.5 million, which was about double of what the film earned in 1933.
===Censorship and restorations===
The Production Code&#x27;s stricter rules were put into effect in Hollywood after the film&#x27;s 1933 premiere and it was progressively censored further, with several scenes being either trimmed or excised altogether for the 1938-1956 rereleases. Censors removed the scene of the Brontosaurus mauling crewmen in the water, chasing one up a tree and killing him. They also removed the scenes where Kong undresses Ann Darrow, bites and steps on people. The scene where Kong mistakes a sleeping woman for Ann and drops her to her death after realizing his mistake was also removed. An additional scene portraying giant insects, spiders, a reptile-like predator and a tentacled creature devouring the crew members shaken off the log by Kong onto the floor of the canyon below was deemed too gruesome by RKO even by pre-Code standards. Cooper thought it &quot;stopped the story&quot;, and thus the scene was censored by the studio before the original release. Members of the preview audience also left the film early because they were concerned about the scene. The footage is considered lost, except for only a few stills and pre-production drawings. There are also claims that it was never filmed and was only in the script and novelization.RKO did not preserve copies of the film&#x27;s negative or release prints with the excised footage, and the cut scenes were considered lost for many years. In 1969, a 16mm print, including the censored footage, was found in Philadelphia. The cut scenes were added to the film, restoring it to its original theatrical running time of 100 minutes. This version was re-released to art houses by Janus Films in 1970. Over the next two decades, Universal Studios undertook further photochemical restoration of &quot;King Kong.&quot; This was based on a 1942 release print with missing censor cuts taken from a 1937 print, which &quot;contained heavy vertical scratches from projection.&quot; An original release print located in the UK in the 1980s was found to contain the cut scenes in better quality. After a 6-year worldwide search for the best surviving materials, a further, fully digital restoration utilizing 4K resolution scanning was completed by Warner Bros. in 2005. This restoration also had a 4-minute overture added, bringing the overall running time to 104 minutes. The project was funded by The Film Foundation and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Somewhat controversially, &quot;King Kong&quot; was colorized for a 1989 Turner Home Entertainment video release.
===Television and home media===
After the 1956 re-release, the film was sold to television and was first broadcast on March 5, 1956&quot;. King Kong&quot; had numerous VHS and LaserDisc releases of varying quality before receiving an official studio release on DVD. In 1984, &quot;King Kong&quot; was one of the first films to be released on LaserDisc as part of the Criterion Collection, and was the first movie to have an audio commentary track included. Criterion&#x27;s audio commentary was by film historian Ron Haver. The Haver commentary was available on the FilmStruck streaming service. Image Entertainment released another LaserDisc around 1993. The VHS release from Turner was a 60th-anniversary edition in 1992 featuring a front cover that had the sound effect of Kong roaring when his chest was pressed. It had orders for over 140,000 copies, with the colorized version being preferred. It also included a 25-minute documentary, &quot;It Was Beauty Killed the Beast&quot; (1992). 

In 2005, Warner Bros. released its digital restoration of &quot;King Kong&quot; in a US 2-disc Special Edition DVD, coinciding with the theatrical release of Peter Jackson&#x27;s remake. The restoration was funded partially by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. The DVD release had numerous extra features, including a new, third audio commentary by visual effects artists Ray Harryhausen and Ken Ralston, with archival excerpts from actress Fay Wray and producer/director Merian C. Cooper. At &quot;American Cinematographer&quot;, Kenneth Sweeney found the extras on disc 1 lackluster for such an important release. Disc 2 included more in-depth features, with a short biographical film on Cooper, and &quot;RKO Production 601: The Making of &quot;King Kong&quot;&quot;, produced by Peter Jackson. Disc 2 included additional interviews with many relevant people. The DVD was also sold in a limited edition with &quot;Son of Kong&quot; and &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; Warners issued a US digibook-packaged Blu-ray in 2010. Rudy Behlmer wrote the accompanying 32-page booklet. 
==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;King Kong&quot; received generally positive reviews upon its release. Meehan of &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot; predicted it would be &quot;one of the sensational pictures of the year&quot;, opining that &quot;no more thrilling climax ever was filmed&quot;. A &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot; review by McCarthy called &quot;King Kong&quot; &quot;imagination-stunning&quot; and praised the &quot;buildup of suspense&quot;, dubbing it &quot;a showman&#x27;s picture&quot;. A reviewer for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; claimed the film &quot;bears all the earmarks of a winner&quot;, predicting it would make &quot;plenty of money&quot;. Another review in the same periodical declared it was &quot;superbly produced-acted&quot;, a &quot;great piece of imagination, hatched in the brain of a showman for showmen&quot;. The periodical included a multi-page booklet in its March issue, featuring production stills and concept sketches alongside critical praise for the film. The booklet was the program for the film&#x27;s Los Angeles premiere. &quot;The Film Daily&quot; wrote, &quot;The picture has plenty of shocker stuff, and the terror is heightened by [Fay Wray&#x27;s screaming], while the film&#x27;s musical score adds its blare to keep the audience in a state of turmoil.&quot; The reviewer cautioned that &quot;some women and children&quot; might dislike the film&#x27;s intensity. The New York Times gave readers an enthusiastic account of the plot and thought the film a fascinating adventure. John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it &quot;ridiculous,&quot; but wrote that there were &quot;many scenes in this picture that are certainly diverting.&quot; The &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot; said it was &quot;one of the very best of all the screen thrillers, done with all the cinema&#x27;s slickest camera tricks.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called it &quot;one of the most original, thrilling and mammoth novelties to emerge from a movie studio.&quot; Joe Bigelow of &quot;Variety&quot; thought the film held &quot;power&quot; once a viewer got used to the &quot;phoney atmosphere&quot;. He remarked that &quot;a few details were too strong to swallow the picture&quot; and the technical innovations overshadowed the plot and acting. The film&#x27;s &quot;many flaws&quot;, he added, were &quot;overcome by the general results&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote that Cooper and Schoedsack were no longer &quot;scientists&quot; because the film was &quot;exaggerated in its faked views of wild life&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; pointed out Kong&#x27;s perceptible size changes, and remarked that compared to today&#x27;s filmmaking techniques, &quot;King Kong&quot; &quot;has ceased to be the thriller...and has become of the best comedies seen for years&quot;. In its review &quot;Time&quot; wrote that Kong &quot;sometimes doubled in size&quot;. Kim Newman of &quot;Empire&quot; calls &quot;Kong&#x27;s feelings for Ann...the...backbone&quot; of the film. Almar Haflidason of BBC praises the &quot;fantastic atmosphere&quot; of the score and the &quot;richness of Kong&#x27;s character.&quot; Haflidason adds that the animation is “technically brilliant [and] highly imaginative in terms of cinematic action”. The Washington City Paper called it &quot;a movie upon whose foundation we’ve built a sizable section of contemporary pop culture&quot;. TIFF wrote that it is &quot;reductive in its portrayal of humans, especially the Indigenous people&quot;. While Ed Symkus of &quot;USA Today&quot; claims the film &quot;stands tall as a groundbreaking piece of jaw-dropping, eye-widening entertainment&quot;, James Berardinelli writes that &quot;advances in technology and acting have dated aspects of the production&quot;. He also adds that the acting is weak and that he feels &quot;some sense of awe&quot; for the special effects. Film historian Michael Price calls the film &quot;the product of a remarkable group of daredevils, artists, and craftsmen.&quot; Brian Eggert claims that &quot;&quot;King Kong&#x27;s&quot; greatness remains in part because it demonstrates a compendium of Classic Hollywood production strategies.&quot; He additionally praises the music as &quot;guid[ing] every emotion&quot;. Roger Ebert included &quot;King Kong&quot; in his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list, writing that &quot;In modern times the movie has aged, as critic James Berardinelli observes, and &#x27;advances in technology and acting have dated aspects of the production.&#x27; Yes, but in the very artificiality of some of the special effects, there is a creepiness that isn&#x27;t there in today&#x27;s slick, flawless, computer-aided images... Even allowing for its slow start, wooden acting, and wall-to-wall screaming, there is something ageless and primeval about &quot;King Kong&quot; that still somehow works.&quot; On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on , with an average rating of 9/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;King Kong&quot; explores the soul of a monster – making audiences scream and cry throughout the film – in large part due to Kong&#x27;s breakthrough special effects.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 92 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

===Criticism of racism and sexism===
In the 19th and early 20th century, people of African descent were commonly represented visually as ape-like, a metaphor that fit racist stereotypes further bolstered by the emergence of scientific racism. Early films frequently mirrored racial tensions. While &quot;King Kong&quot; is often compared to the story of &quot;Beauty and the Beast,&quot; many film scholars have argued that the film was a cautionary tale about interracial romance, in which the film&#x27;s &quot;carrier of blackness is not a human being, but an ape.&quot;

Cooper and Schoedsack rejected any allegorical interpretations, insisting in interviews that the film&#x27;s story contained no hidden meanings. In an interview, which was published posthumously, Cooper explained the deeper meaning of the film. The inspiration for the climactic scene came when, &quot;as he was leaving his office in Manhattan, he heard the sound of an airplane motor. He reflexively looked up as the sun glinted off the wings of a plane flying extremely close to the tallest building in the city... he realized if he placed the giant gorilla on top of the tallest building in the world and had him shot down by the most modern of weapons, the armed airplane, he would have a story of the primitive doomed by modern civilization.&quot;

The film was later criticized for racist stereotyping of the natives and Charlie the Cook, played by Victor Wong, who upon discovering the kidnapping of Ann Darrow, exclaims &quot;Crazy black man been here!&quot;. The film has been noted for its depiction of Ann as a damsel in distress. In her autobiography, Wray wrote that Ann&#x27;s screaming was too much. However, Nick Hilton in &quot;The Independent&quot; stated that the film &quot;may look a little foolish to us (not to mention racist, sexist and, shall we say, symbolically naive) but it still packs a visceral wallop&quot;, while Ryan Britt felt that critics were willing to overlook the film&#x27;s problematic aspects as &quot;just unattractive byproducts of the era in which the film was made...that the meta-fictional aspects almost excuse some of the cultural insensitivity&quot;. In 2013 an article entitled &quot;11 of The Most Racist Movies Ever Made&quot; described the film&#x27;s natives &quot;as subhuman, or primate... (not) even have a distinct way of communicating...&quot; The article also brought up the racial allegory between Kong and black men, particularly how Kong &quot;meets his demise due to his insatiable desire for a white woman&quot;.

The film was initially banned in Nazi Germany, with the censors describing it as an &quot;attack against the nerves of the German people&quot; and a &quot;violation of German race feeling&quot;. However, according to confidant Ernst Hanfstaengl, Adolf Hitler was &quot;fascinated&quot; by the film and saw it several times. Author and historian Bill Niven remarks that there is no confirmation that Hitler watched the film.

==Legacy and franchise==
===Legacy===
Since its release the film has received some significant honors. In 1975, &quot;Kong&quot; was named one of the 50 best American films by the American Film Institute. Around this time it also gained academic attention. In 1981 a video game titled &quot;Donkey Kong,&quot; starring a character with similarities to Kong, was released. In 1991, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically and aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. In 1998, the AFI ranked the film #43 on its list of the 100 greatest movies of all time.

The film&#x27;s stop motion effects by Willis H. O&#x27;Brien left a lasting impact on the film industry worldwide and inspired other genre films such as &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot;, &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot;, &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot;, &quot;Mothra&quot;, and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. The film was also one of the biggest inspirations for &quot;Godzilla,&quot; with Tomoyuki Tanaka stating, &quot;I felt like doing something big. That was my motivation. I thought of different ideas. I like monster movies, and I was influenced by King Kong.&quot;

Daiei Film, the company which later produced &quot;Gamera&quot; and &quot;Daimajin&quot; and other tokusatsu films distributed the 1952 re-released edition of &quot;King Kong&quot; in 1952, making it the first post-war release of monster movies in Japan. The company also distributed &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot; in Japan in 1954, and these distributions presumably influenced productions of both &quot;Godzilla&quot; and &quot;Gamera&quot; franchises.

Author Daniel Loxton suggested that &quot;King Kong&quot; inspired the modern day legend of the Loch Ness Monster.

=== Sequel and franchise ===

Delos W. Lovelace was hired by Cooper to compose a novel version of &quot;King Kong&quot;. Lovelace appeared as the author alongside the credit &quot;conceived by Edgar Wallace and Merian C. Cooper&quot;. Walter Ripperger wrote a 2-part serial version for &quot;Mystery&quot;, which was credited as &quot;the last creation of Edgar Wallace&quot;.

The film and characters inspired imitations and installments. The same year of &quot;King Kong&quot;&#x27;s release,&quot;Son of Kong,&quot; a sequel, was fast-tracked and released. Later, in the 1960s, RKO licensed the King Kong character to Japanese studio Toho, which made two films, &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot;, the third film in Toho&#x27;s long-running&quot; Godzilla&quot; series, and &quot;King Kong Escapes.&quot; Both were directed by Ishirō Honda. These films are mostly unrelated to the original and follow a very different style. In 1976 producer Dino De Laurentiis released a modern remake of &quot;King Kong.&quot; It follows the same basic plot, but the setting is moved to the present day and several other details are different. This remake was followed by a 1986 sequel &quot;King Kong Lives.&quot; In 1998, a loosely-adapted direct-to-video animated version, &quot;The Mighty Kong,&quot; was distributed by Warner Bros. In 2005, Universal Pictures released another remake of &quot;King Kong,&quot; co-written and directed by Peter Jackson, which is set in the 1930s, as in the original film. Legendary Pictures and Warner Bros. made &quot;&quot; (2017), which serves as part of a cinematic universe, &quot;MonsterVerse,&quot; followed by the sequels &quot;Godzilla vs. Kong&quot; (2021) and &quot;Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire&quot; (2024).

The search for censored scenes inspired a play called &quot;Censored Scenes from King Kong,&quot; performed in 1980. A reviewer in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called it the &quot;worst offering&quot; in a bad season.

<doc id="16788" wikidata="Q952912" url="?curid=16788" title="Kenning">
<text>A kenning (Icelandic: ) is a figure of speech, a figuratively-phrased compound term that is used in place of a simple single-word noun. For instance, the Old English kenning () means , as does ().

A kenning has two parts: a base-word (also known as a head-word) and a determinant. So in &quot;whale&#x27;s road&quot;, &quot;road&quot; is the base-word, and &quot;whale&#x27;s&quot; is the determinant. This is the same structure as in the modern English term &quot;skyscraper&quot;; the base-word here would be &quot;scraper&quot;, and the determinant &quot;sky&quot;. In some languages, kennings can recurse, with one element of the kenning being replaced by another kenning.

The meaning of the kenning is known as its referent (in the case of &quot;whale&#x27;s road&quot;, &quot;sea&quot; is the referent). Note that &quot;skyscraper&quot; is not a kenning, as it is not a circumlocution for a simpler term; it just means .

Kennings are strongly associated with Old Norse-Icelandic and Old English alliterative verse. They continued to be a feature of Icelandic poetry (including ) for centuries, together with the closely related . Although kennings are sometimes hyphenated in English translation, Old Norse poetry did not require kennings to be in normal word order, nor do the parts of the kenning need to be side-by-side. The lack of grammatical cases in modern English makes this aspect of kennings difficult to translate. Kennings are now rarely used in English, but are still used in the Germanic language family.

==Etymology==

The corresponding modern verb &quot;to ken&quot; survives in Scots and English dialects and in general English through the derivative existing in the standard language in the set expression &quot;beyond one&#x27;s ken&quot;, &quot;beyond the scope of one&#x27;s knowledge&quot; and in the phonologically altered forms &quot;uncanny&quot;, , and &quot;canny&quot;, . Modern Scots retains (with slight differences between dialects) , or , Afrikaans and and . Old Norse (Modern Icelandic , Swedish , Danish , Norwegian or ) is cognate with Old English , Old Frisian , , Old Saxon () (Middle Dutch and Dutch ), Old High German (, , ) (Middle High German and German ), Gothic &lt; Proto-Germanic , originally causative of , whence Modern English &quot;can&quot; . The word ultimately derives from , the same Proto-Indo-European root that yields Modern English &quot;know&quot;, Latin-derived terms such as &quot;cognition&quot; and &quot;ignorant&quot;, and Greek .

==Structure==
Old Norse kennings take the form of a genitive phrase ( = (Þorbjörn Hornklofi: Glymdrápa 3)) or a compound word ( = (Anon.: &quot;Hervararkviða&quot; 27)). The simplest kennings consist of a base-word (Icelandic , German ) and a determinant (Icelandic , German ) which qualifies, or modifies, the meaning of the base-word. The determinant may be a noun used uninflected as the first element in a compound word, with the base-word constituting the second element of the compound word. Alternatively the determinant may be a noun in the genitive case placed before or after the base-word, either directly or separated from the base-word by intervening words.

Thus the base-words in these examples are and , the determinants and . The unstated noun which the kenning refers to is called its referent, in this case: .

The base-word of the kenning ( [SWORD], Einarr Skúlason: &quot;Øxarflokkr&quot; 9) is () and the determinant is (). The referent is .

In Old Norse poetry, either component of a kenning (base-word, determinant or both) could consist of an ordinary noun or a &quot;heiti&quot; &quot;poetic synonym&quot;. In the above examples, and are distinctively poetic lexemes; the normal word for in Old Norse prose is .

===Complex kennings===
The skalds also employed complex kennings in which the determinant, or sometimes the base-word, is itself made up of a further kenning: = = (Þorbjörn Hornklofi: &quot;Glymdrápa&quot; 6); = = (Þorbjörn Þakkaskáld: Erlingsdrápa 1) (referring to carrion birds scavenging after a battle). Where one kenning is embedded in another like this, the whole figure is said to be .&lt;ref name=&quot;Faulkes 1999, p. 5/12&quot;&gt;Faulkes (1999), p. 5/12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently, where the determinant is itself a kenning, the base-word of the kenning that makes up the determinant is attached uninflected to the front of the base-word of the whole kenning to form a compound word: = = = (Steinunn Refsdóttir: Lausavísa 2).

If the figure comprises more than three elements, it is said to be &quot;extended&quot;. Kennings of up to seven elements are recorded in skaldic verse. Snorri himself characterises five-element kennings as an acceptable license but cautions against more extreme constructions: &quot;The ninth [license] is extending a kenning to the fifth determinant, but it is out of proportion if it is extended further. Even if it can be found in the works of ancient poets, we no longer tolerate it.&quot; The longest kenning found in skaldic poetry occurs in &quot;Hafgerðingadrápa&quot; by Þórðr Sjáreksson and reads , which simply means .

===Word order and comprehension===
Word order in Old Norse was generally much freer than in Modern English because Old Norse and Old English are synthetic languages, where added prefixes and suffixes to the root word (the core noun, verb, adjective or adverb) carry grammatical meanings, whereas Middle English and Modern English use word order to carry grammatical information, as analytic languages. This freedom is exploited to the full in skaldic verse and taken to extremes far beyond what would be natural in prose. Other words can intervene between a base-word and its genitive determinant, and occasionally between the elements of a compound word (tmesis). Kennings, and even whole clauses, can be interwoven. Ambiguity is usually less than it would be if an English text were subjected to the same contortions, thanks to the more elaborate morphology of Old Norse.

Another factor aiding comprehension is that Old Norse kennings tend to be highly conventional. Most refer to the same small set of topics, and do so using a relatively small set of traditional metaphors. Thus a leader or important man will be characterised as generous, according to one common convention, and called an &quot;enemy of gold&quot;, &quot;attacker of treasure&quot;, &quot;destroyer of arm-rings&quot;, etc. and a friend of his people. Nevertheless, there are many instances of ambiguity in the corpus, some of which may be intentional, and some evidence that, rather than merely accepting it from expediency, skalds favoured contorted word order for its own sake.

===Semantics===
Kennings could be developed into extended, and sometimes vivid, metaphors: (Eyvindr Skáldaspillir: Hákonarmál 6); (Eyvindr Skáldaspillir: Hákonarmál 7). Snorri calls such examples and exemplifies them in verse 6 of his Háttatal. The effect here seems to depend on an interplay of more or less naturalistic imagery and jarring artifice. But the skalds were not averse either to arbitrary, purely decorative, use of kennings: &quot;That is, a ruler will be a distributor of gold even when he is fighting a battle and gold will be called the fire of the sea even when it is in the form of a man&#x27;s arm-ring on his arm. If the man wearing a gold ring is fighting a battle on land the mention of the sea will have no relevance to his situation at all and does not contribute to the picture of the battle being described&quot; (Faulkes (1997), pp. 8–9).

Snorri draws the line at mixed metaphor, which he terms (Snorri Sturluson: Háttatal 6), and his nephew called the practice (Óláfr hvítaskáld: Third Grammatical Treatise 80). In spite of this, it seems that &quot;many poets did not object to and some must have preferred baroque juxtapositions of unlike kennings and neutral or incongruous verbs in their verses&quot; (Foote &amp; Wilson (1970), p. 332). E.g. (Einarr skálaglamm: Vellekla 1).

Sometimes there is a kind of redundancy whereby the referent of the whole kenning, or a kenning for it, is embedded: = = (Oddr breiðfirðingr: Illugadrápa 1); = = = (Anon.: Líknarbraut 42).

While some Old Norse kennings are relatively transparent, many depend on a knowledge of specific myths or legends. Thus the sky might be called naturalistically (Markús Skeggjason: Eiríksdrápa 3) or described in mythical terms as (Arnórr jarlaskáld: Magnúsdrápa 19), referring to the idea that the sky was made out of the skull of the primeval giant Ymir. Still others name mythical entities according to certain conventions without reference to a specific story: = (Arnórr jarlaskáld: Magnúsdrápa 5).

Poets in medieval Iceland even treated Christian themes using the traditional repertoire of kennings complete with allusions to heathen myths and aristocratic epithets for saints: = &#x27;Saint Catherine&#x27; (Kálfr Hallsson: Kátrínardrápa 4).

Kennings of the type AB, where B routinely has the characteristic A and thus this AB is tautological, tend to mean &quot;like B in that it has the characteristic A&quot;, e.g. , tautological because the god Njörðr by nature has his own shield, means , i.e. . A modern English example is &quot;painted Jezebel&quot; as a disapproving expression for a woman too fond of using cosmetics.

Kennings may include proper names. A modern example of this is an ad hoc usage by a helicopter ambulance pilot: &quot;the Heathrow of hang gliders&quot; for the hills behind Hawes in Yorkshire in England, when he found the air over the emergency site crowded with hang-gliders.

Sometimes a name given to one well-known member of a species is used to mean any member of that species. For example, Old Norse means , but Old Norse mythology mentions a horse named Valr, and thus in Old Norse poetry is sometimes used to mean .

===Ellipsis===
A term may be omitted from a well-known kenning: (Haraldr Harðráði: Lausavísa 19). The full expression implied here is = = = (characterised according to convention as wearing golden jewellery, the arm-kenning being a reference to falconry). The poet relies on listeners&#x27; familiarity with such conventions to carry the meaning.

==Definitions==
Some scholars take the term kenning broadly to include any noun-substitute consisting of two or more elements, including merely descriptive epithets (such as Old Norse = (Snorri Sturluson: Skáldskaparmál 36)), while others would restrict it to metaphorical instances (such as Old Norse = (Snorri Sturluson: Skáldskaparmál 36)), specifically those where &quot;[t]he base-word identifies the referent with something which it is not, except in a specially conceived relation which the poet imagines between it and the sense of the limiting element&#x27;&quot; (Brodeur (1959) pp. 248–253). Some even exclude naturalistic metaphors such as Old English = or = : &quot;A metaphor is a kenning only if it contains an incongruity between the referent and the meaning of the base-word; in the kenning the limiting word is essential to the figure because without it the incongruity would make any identification impossible&quot; (Brodeur (1959) pp. 248–253). Descriptive epithets are a common literary device in many parts of the world, whereas kennings in this restricted sense are a distinctive feature of Old Norse and, to a lesser extent, Old English poetry.

Snorri&#x27;s own usage, however, seems to fit the looser sense: &quot;Snorri uses the term &#x27;kenning&#x27; to refer to a structural device, whereby a person or object is indicated by a periphrastic description containing two or more terms (which can be a noun with one or more dependent genitives or a compound noun or a combination of these two structures)&quot; (Faulkes (1998 a), p. xxxiv). The term is certainly applied to non-metaphorical phrases in Skáldskaparmál: Likewise in Háttatal: .

Snorri&#x27;s expression appears to be synonymous with , although Brodeur applies this more specifically to those periphrastic epithets which do not come under his strict definition of kenning.

Sverdlov approaches the question from a morphological standpoint. Noting that the modifying component in Germanic compound words can take the form of a genitive or a bare root, he points to behavioural similarities between genitive determinants and the modifying element in regular Old Norse compound words, such as the fact that neither can be modified by a free-standing (declined) adjective. According to this view, all kennings are formally compounds, notwithstanding widespread tmesis.

==Old Norse kennings in context==

In the following stanza, the Norwegian skald Eyvindr skáldaspillir (died ca. 990) compares the greed of King Harald Greycloak () to the generosity of his predecessor, Haakon the Good ():
&lt;poem&gt;

::—Eyvindr skáldaspillir, &quot;Lausavísa&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

A literal translation reveals several kennings: &quot;Ullr of the war-leek! We carried the seed of Fýrisvellir on our hawk-mountains during all of Haakon&#x27;s life; now the enemy of the people has hidden the flour of Fróði&#x27;s hapless slaves in the flesh of the mother of the enemy of the giantess.&quot;

This could be paraphrased as &quot;O warrior, we carried gold on our arms during all of King Haakon&#x27;s life; now the enemy of the people has hidden gold in the earth.&quot; The kennings are:

, , from &quot;Ullr&quot;, the name of a god, and , (literally ). By convention, the name of any god can be associated with another word to produce a kenning for a certain type of man; here &quot;Ullr of the sword&quot; means . &quot;War-leek&quot; is a kenning for that likens the shape of the sword to that of a leek. The warrior referred to may be King Harald.

, , from and . This is a reference to the sport of falconry, where a bird of prey is perched on the arm of the falconer. By convention, combined with a term for a geographic feature forms a kenning for .

, , from &quot;Fýrisvellir&quot;, the plains of the river Fýri, and , . This is an allusion to a legend retold in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; and &quot;Hrólfs saga kraka&quot; in which King Hrolf and his men scattered gold on the plains () of the river Fýri south of Gamla Uppsala to delay their pursuers.

, , is another kenning for . It alludes to the Grottasöngr legend.

, , . Here the earth is personified as the goddess Jörð, mother of Thor, enemy of the jǫtnar.

==Old English and other kennings==
The practice of forming kennings has traditionally been seen as a common Germanic inheritance, but this has been disputed since, among the early Germanic languages, their use is largely restricted to Old Norse and Old English poetry. A possible early kenning for ( &quot;Roman/Gallic grain&quot;) is attested in the Proto-Norse runic inscription on the Tjurkö (I)-C bracteate. Kennings are virtually absent from the surviving corpus of continental West Germanic verse; the Old Saxon Heliand contains only one example: = (Heliand 3453 b), a compound which, in any case, is normal in West Germanic and North Germanic prose (Old English , Old High German , , Dutch , Old Icelandic , , Old Swedish , Swedish , Danish and Norwegian Bokmål , Norwegian Nynorsk ).

Old English kennings are all of the simple type, possessing just two elements. Examples for : (Beowulf 1429 b), (Beowulf 200 a), (Andreas 513 a), (Beowulf 10), (The Seafarer 63 a). Most Old English examples take the form of compound words in which the first element is uninflected: = (Exodus 115 b). Kennings consisting of a genitive phrase occur too, but rarely: = (The Phoenix 183).

Old English poets often place a series of synonyms in apposition, and these may include kennings (loosely or strictly defined) as well as the literal referent: ... (Beowulf 456).

Old Frisian also had kennings, though they were relatively rare. In legal documents regarding the protection of children and pregnant women, the term (&#x27;fortress of the bones&#x27;) is used for &#x27;womb&#x27;.

Although the word &quot;kenning&quot; is not often used for non-Germanic languages, a similar form can be found in Biblical poetry in its use of parallelism. Some examples include Genesis 49:11, in which &quot;blood of grapes&quot; is used as a kenning for , and Job 15:14, where &quot;born of woman&quot; is a parallel for .

==Modern usage==
Figures of speech similar to kennings occur in Modern English (both in literature and in regular speech), and are often found in combination with other poetic devices. For example, the Madness song &quot;The Sun and the Rain&quot; contains the line &quot;standing up in the falling-down&quot;, where &quot;the falling-down&quot; refers to rain and is used in juxtaposition to &quot;standing up&quot;. Some recent English writers have attempted to use approximations of kennings in their work. John Steinbeck used kenning-like figures of speech in his 1950 novella &quot;Burning Bright&quot;, which was adapted into a Broadway play that same year. According to Steinbeck biographer Jay Parini, &quot;The experiment is well-intentioned, but it remains idiosyncratic to the point of absurdity. Steinbeck invented compound phrases (similar to the Old English use of kennings), such as &#x27;wife-loss&#x27; and &#x27;friend-right&#x27; and &#x27;laughter-starving,&#x27; that simply seem eccentric.&quot;

Kennings remain somewhat common in German ( for bicycle, for motorcycle, for cat, and so on).

The poet Seamus Heaney regularly employed kennings in his work; for example, &quot;bone-house&quot; for .

<doc id="16789" wikidata="Q1392276" url="?curid=16789" title="Kult (role-playing game)">
<text>Kult (Swedish for &quot;Cult&quot;, stylized as KULT) is a contemporary horror role-playing game originally created by Gunilla Jonsson and Michael Petersén with illustrations by Nils Gulliksson, first published in Sweden by Äventyrsspel (later Target Games) in 1991. &quot;Kult&quot; is notable for its philosophical and religious depth as well as for its mature and controversial content.

The first three English editions were published from 1993–2004 by Metropolis Ltd. In 2018 current licensor Helmgast released the fourth edition, Kult: Divinity Lost, created by Robin Liljenberg and Petter Nallo. This edition updated the setting from the 1990s to the 2010s and was completely rewritten with new art and layout, and a ruleset based on &quot;Powered by the Apocalypse&quot;. The fourth edition was well received by critics and fans and won two Ennies for Best Writing and Best Cover 2019, and was also nominated for Best Interior Art.

==Setting==
The default backdrop is that of our present-day large cities. Players take the roles of contemporary protagonists from across genres, such as private investigators, femmes fatales, vigilantes, drug dealers, artists, journalists, secret agents, and mad scientists. In the game, however, the entire visible world is an illusion (&quot;the&quot; Illusion) held together by a monotheistic belief which is unravelling to reveal the darker &quot;reality&quot; beneath—where nightmarish monsters lurk. The Illusion was created by the Demiurge to hold humanity prisoner and to prevent us from regaining the divinity we once had. In the absence of the Demiurge, sinister forces plot to keep humanity from realizing the truth, or even to plunge the world into an apocalyptic war to restore humanity&#x27;s ignorance and blind faith in the divine order.

Some symbols and creatures appearing in &quot;Kult&quot; also appear in other Swedish games to which the same authors and production team contributed. &quot;The Mutant Chronicles&quot; universe (created by Nils Gulliksson and Michael Stenmark) and its spin-offs share creatures such as Nepharites and Razides which appear in &quot;Kult&quot;.

==Rules==

The original system is a skill-based system using a 20-sided dice (related to Chaosium&#x27;s BRP system, which had already been used by Äventyrsspel for their &quot;Drakar och Demoner&quot; rpgs), with point-based characters. In the game, a natural 1 usually means a great success with added bonuses and a natural 20 means a complete failure. Normal characters usually have skill ratings of 3–20; to succeed in a skill roll, the player must roll equal to or lower than their skill. The lower the player rolls under their skill rating, the greater the success. Extraordinary characters and inhuman entities can have skill ratings far above the normal range.

The fourth edition, &quot;Kult: Divinity Lost&quot;, uses rules that are based on the Apocalypse World rules engine. Players roll two 10-sided dice, add possible modifications, and try to reach at least 10 to avoid failure or 15 to gain a complete success. &quot;Kult: Divinity Lost&quot; also has a system where the Gamemaster builds the campaign around the player characters and aims to evoke personal horror.

Over the various editions, there were several different rulesets for combat. The second and third English edition rules use a system based on Damage Effect Factors (DEF). The fourth edition, &quot;Kult: Divinity Lost&quot;, has less focus on combat than previous editions.

The magic rules in &quot;Kult&quot; are loosely inspired by real-world occult practices, such as Hermeticism, in order to heighten the setting&#x27;s realism. Sorcerers can cast spells from one (or rarely more) of five different Lores: Death, Dream, Madness, Passion and Time &amp; Space. Because these spells have (very) long casting times (up to several days); require highly specific and exacting verbal, material and somatic requirements; and can only be cast inside the sorcerer&#x27;s consecrated temple, they resemble religious rituals. 

=== Mental Balance ===
Early editions of the game use &quot;Mental Balance&quot; as a gauge of player characters&#x27; sanity. Both a high or low (+25/-25) Mental Balance affects how normal people and animals react to the character. Characters with an extremely high or low Mental Balance can transcend the Illusion and regain their lost divine status through Awakening. This occurs if Mental Balance reaches +500 or -500.

A character&#x27;s mental balance can move in a positive or negative direction due to trauma, influence from creatures or places, or by advantages and disadvantages from talents or traits, such as (on the positive side) animal friendship, artistic talent, body awareness, a code of honor, or (on the negative side) social ineptitude, addiction, paranoia, or a mystic curse. The further the character strays away from the zero point, the more sociopathic, strange or eccentric they become. Characters with a very high or very low mental balance start to involuntarily manifest outward physical signs. 

In the fourth edition of &quot;Kult&quot;, the mental balance system was removed, as the developers found it impractical during gameplay. Instead, characters take on different archetypes in the path toward Awakening: &quot;The Sleeper&quot;, &quot;The Aware&quot;, and &quot;The Enlightened.&quot;

== Publication history ==
&quot;Kult&quot; was originally published in Swedish by Target Games in 1991, and was later translated into German, English, Italian, Spanish, Polish and French. American game company Metropolis Ltd. published the English-language game through its first three editions, creating new supplements with a new US background, and with revised page design and editing. Terry K. Amthor left Iron Crown Enterprises in 1992 to co-found Metropolis Ltd., specifically to produce the English-language version of the game. Between 1992 and 1994, Amthor edited, co-authored and art-directed several books for the line.

The third English edition of &quot;Kult&quot; had two English books released in print form: a player&#x27;s handbook named &quot;Kult Rumours&quot; in 2001 and the core rulebook, &quot;Kult: Beyond The Veil&quot;, printed in 2004. Other editions were published 
by 7ème Cercle (French) and Raven Distribution (Italian).

The license has been the property of first Target Games, then Paradox Entertainment, and, in 2015, Cabinet Holdings. &quot;Kult&quot; is currently licensed by Helmgast. A 2016 Kickstarter campaign funded the fourth edition of the game, &quot;Kult: Divinity Lost&quot;. This edition uses a different rules engine than previous editions, based on &quot;Apocalypse World&quot; and its Powered by the Apocalypse rules. It updates the timeline to the modern setting. The fourth edition was released in 2018.

==Supplements==
Many supplements have been produced in both Swedish and English. Its first supplement was &quot;Legions of Darkness&quot; in 1993.

==Reception==
Jeff Koke reviewed &quot;Kult&quot; for &quot;Pyramid&quot; #3 (Sept./Oct., 1993), and said, &quot;All in all, Kult is a very good system and background for roleplayers who are mature enough to delve into truly dark roleplaying. Even for those players who dislike being immersed in depressing, hopeless worlds, the background has enough tidbits of bleak imagery and morsels of horrific scenery that it&#x27;s worth the cover price just to browse through the Metropolis.&quot; 

Denys Bakriges reviewed &quot;Kult&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #39 (1994), rating it a 5 out of 5 and stated that &quot;&quot;Kult&quot; is an excellent roleplaying game. It&#x27;s one of the greatest horror games released in recent years. While its mythology is steeped in Christian ideology and Jungian philosophy, its ideas are very original. However, there&#x27;s a note of &#x27;caution.&#x27; The game setting can be unremittingly bleak and depressing. This is gut-level horror. You know what you like. Take it as you will.&quot;

Writing for &quot;Gizmodo&quot;, Ed Grabianowski described shopping for &quot;Kult&quot; as a teenager: &quot;&#x27;It&#x27;s banned in Sweden,&#x27; is pretty much the best possible sales pitch you can make to a couple of 14-year-old boys. And indeed &quot;Kult&quot; turns out to be a pretty interesting, intense RPG.&quot; Grabianoski said, &quot;Some of &quot;Kult&#x27;s&quot; controversy stems from the inclusion of rape among the many horrors that could be experienced by a character. Like me, you may not be interested in dealing with those kinds of issues during a gaming session, but to its credit, &quot;Kult&quot; made it clear that rape had serious and terrible consequences for both the victim and the perpetrator.&quot; Grabianoswki concluded, &quot;Although &quot;Kult&quot; was never a big success in North America, it still holds that strange frisson of ominous allure.&quot; 

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath said, &quot;The characters all harbor sordid secrets that range from enduring supernatural curses to being the subject of medical experimentation to being possessed by a demon. The secrets taint the characters and, most likely, provide the means for their eventual destruction.&quot;

=== Moral panic in Sweden ===
Similar to the 1980s Dungeons &amp; Dragons controversies in the United States, &quot;Kult&quot; figured in several Swedish moral panics during the 1990s. At the time of the game&#x27;s initial publication, role-playing games in Sweden were still sold primarily through toy stores rather than bookstores or specialized hobby shops. &quot;Kult&quot; appeared in the press several times during the decade after its initial publication, and in 1997 the &quot;Kult&quot; core rules were quoted in a motion in the Parliament of Sweden. The motion was to stop taxpayer funding of youth groups that were active with role-playing games. It refers to the Bjuv murder, where a 15-year-old in the small southern town of Bjuv was killed by two friends, aged 16- and 17-years-old, who (according to the legal motion) were influenced by &quot;Kult&quot;.

Writer Didi Örnstedt and painter Björn Sjöstedt wrote a book, &quot;De Övergivnas Armé&quot; (&quot;Army of the Abandoned&quot;), where they warn against the role-playing game hobby, with a particular focus on &quot;Kult&quot;. The title refers to children supposedly ignored by their parents and therefore assumed to be susceptible to radicalization by RPGs.

Critics of role-playing games have also attempted to tie &quot;Kult&quot; to a 16-year-old Swedish boy who died by suicide with a shotgun in November 1996. The local newspaper &quot;Tønsbergs Blad&quot; in Tønsberg, Norway similarly attempted to link &quot;Kult&quot; to the disappearance of a boy called Andreas Hammer on July 1, 1994, who allegedly played &quot;Kult&quot; the week prior to his disappearance. He is still missing.

== Fiction == 
In 2017 Free League Publishing published Anders Fager&#x27;s novel &quot;För Gudinnan&quot; (&quot;For the Love of the Goddess&quot;) set in the &quot;Kult&quot; universe. Fager has also written a short audiobook called &quot;Faraday&quot;, set in the &quot;Kult&quot; adventure &quot;Tarroticum&quot;. 

In 2018 and 2020, Free League Publishing published two novels written by the original creators of &quot;Kult&quot;, Gunilla Jonsson and Michael Petersén. They are both set in the Kult universe called &quot;Döden är bara början&quot; (&quot;Death Is Only the Beginning&quot;, 2018) and &quot;De levande döda&quot; (&quot;The Living Dead&quot;, 2020)

== Spin-offs ==

<doc id="16790" wikidata="Q168539" url="?curid=16790" title="Carl Friedrich Abel">
<text>Carl Friedrich Abel (22 December 1723 – 20 June 1787) was a German composer of the pre-Classical era. He was a renowned player of the viola da gamba, and produced significant compositions for that instrument. He was director of music at the Dresden court from 1743, and moved to London in 1759, becoming chamber-musician to Queen Charlotte in 1764. He founded a subscription concert series there with Johann Christian Bach. According to the &quot;Catalogue of Works of Carl Friedrich Abel&quot; (AbelWV), he left 420 compositions, with a focus on chamber music.

== Life ==

Abel was born in Köthen, where his father, Christian Ferdinand Abel, had worked for years as the principal viola da gamba and cello player in the court orchestra of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. In 1723 Abel senior became director of the orchestra, when the previous director, Johann Sebastian Bach, moved to Leipzig. The young Abel later boarded at St. Thomas School, Leipzig, where he was taught by Bach.

On Bach&#x27;s recommendation in 1743 he was able to join Johann Adolph Hasse&#x27;s orchestra at the Dresden court, where he remained for fifteen years. In 1759 (or 1758 according to &quot;Chambers&quot;), he went to England and became chamber-musician to Queen Charlotte, in 1764. He gave a concert of his own compositions in London, performing on various instruments, one of which was a five-string cello known as a pentachord, which had been recently invented by John Joseph Merlin.

In 1762, Johann Christian Bach, a son of J. S. Bach, joined him in London, and the friendship between him and Abel led, in 1764 or 1765, to the establishment of the famous Bach-Abel concerts, England&#x27;s first subscription concerts. In those concerts, many celebrated guest artists appeared, and many works of Haydn received their first English performance.

For ten years the concerts were organized by Teresa Cornelys, a retired Venetian opera singer who owned a concert hall at Carlisle House in Soho Square, then the height of fashionable events. In 1775 the concerts became independent of her, to be continued by Abel and Bach until Bach&#x27;s death in 1782. Abel still remained in great demand as a player on various instruments new and old. He traveled to Germany and France between 1782 and 1785, and upon his return to London, became a leading member of the Grand Professional Concerts at the Hanover Square Rooms in Soho. Throughout his life he had enjoyed excessive living, and his drinking probably hastened his death.

Abel died in London on 20 June 1787. He was buried in the churchyard of St Pancras Old Church.

== Works ==
One of Abel&#x27;s works became famous due to a misattribution: in the 19th century, a manuscript symphony in the hand of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was catalogued as his Symphony No. 3 in E flat, K. 18, and was published as such in the first complete edition of Mozart&#x27;s works by Breitkopf &amp; Härtel. Later, it was discovered that this symphony was actually the work of Abel, copied by the boy Mozart, evidently for study purposes, while he was visiting London in 1764. That symphony was originally published as the concluding work in Abel&#x27;s Six Symphonies, Op. 7.

A first catalogue of Abel&#x27;s works was published in 1971 by , &quot;Abel-Werkverzeichnis&quot;, with 233 work numbers.

In 2015 new manuscripts of Abel&#x27;s viola da gamba music were found in the library of the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań, in a collection from the Maltzahn family palace in the town of Milicz in Poland, originally brought back from London by . Many of them were published by Edition Güntersberg.

A new catalogue, of now 420 works, was published by Ortus Musikverlag in 2023, &quot;Catalogue of Works of Carl Friedrich Abel&quot; or AbelWV, edited by Günter von Zadow. It takes into account many newly discovered works, and additional sources for known works.

== Abel Fest ==
As Abel was born in 1723, the city of Köthen announced an international tricentennial festival around his music on four days in June 2023, held at historic locations including the palace and its gardens. It was initiated by gambist and musicologist Thomas Fritzsch. The city also created a biennial Abel Prize. The first recipients in 2023 were Leonore von Zadow-Reichling and Günter von Zadow of Edition Güntersberg for their efforts to retrieve and publish Abel&#x27;s works. They published more than 150, many as first publications.

<text>Kista (, meaning &quot;place where livestock is traded&quot;, from the Old Swedish word &quot;kvi&quot;, meaning livestock, and &quot;sta(d)&quot;, meaning place) is a district in the borough of Rinkeby-Kista, Stockholm, Sweden. It has a strategic position located in between Sweden&#x27;s main airport, the Stockholm-Arlanda International Airport and central Stockholm, and alongside the main national highway E4 economic artery. Kista comprises residential and commercial areas, the latter in the highly technological telecommunications and information technology industry. There are large research efforts in this entire area, which therefore is dubbed Kista Science City. It is the research park of KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

Kista is the largest Information and Communications Technology (ICT) cluster in Europe, and was ranked the world&#x27;s second largest cluster after Silicon Valley in California during the internet boom of 2000. It is the largest corporate area in Sweden, important to the national economy due to the presence of, among others, Ericsson, one of the largest corporations in Sweden.

Kista Science City is the location where a large portion of the research and development of the world&#x27;s 4G LTE mobile telephony infrastructure is being developed, to a European ETSI standard used worldwide. A majority is done at Ericsson, with 100,000 employees worldwide, but with its research and worldwide headquarters in the Kista Science City.

Kista was named after an old farm &quot;Kista Gård&quot;, still located in the area. The construction of the modern parts were started in the 1970s. Most of the streets in Kista are named after towns and places in Denmark, Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands. Before the opening of the Mall of Scandinavia, Kista Galleria was the biggest shopping center in the Stockholm region. 
Because of its ICT industries, it became in the 1980s referred to as &quot;Chipsta&quot; and, after Sweden joined the EU in 1995, also as Europe&#x27;s &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;.

== Economy ==
Kista is the largest corporate area in Sweden and important to the national economy.
The construction of the industrial section of Kista began in the 1970s with companies such as SRA (Svenska Radioaktiebolaget, now a part of Ericsson), RIFA AB (later Ericsson Components AB, and later still Ericsson Microelectronics AB, and now Infineon Technologies), and IBM Svenska AB (the Swedish branch of IBM). Ericsson has had its headquarters in Kista since 2003. Cellmax is another local company founded and headquartered in Kista.

== Research and higher learning ==

Kista hosts entire departments of both KTH Royal Institute of Technology, such as Wireless@KTH, and Stockholm University (formerly jointly known as &quot;the IT University&quot;).

There are also Swedish national research institutes (pure research, no students) such as the Swedish Institute of Computer Science and Swedish Defence Research Agency, FOI who has its headquarters there, just as Ericsson, Swedish IBM and Tele 2, among others has.

Also the Swedish Co-location Centre of EU innovation and entrepreneurial education organisation EIT Digital is located in Kista and offers a 2-year Master program in collaboration with KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

<doc id="16792" wikidata="Q602965" url="?curid=16792" title="Klondike, Yukon">
<text>The Klondike (; ) is a region of the territory of Yukon, in northwestern Canada. It lies around the Klondike River, a small river that enters the Yukon River from the east at Dawson City. The area is merely an informal geographic region, and has no function to the territory as any kind of administrative region.

The Klondike is famed due to the Klondike Gold Rush, which started in 1896 and lasted until 1899. Since then, gold has been mined continuously in that area, except for a pause in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

In 2023, the cultural landscape of the Tr’ondëk-Klondike was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, because of its testimony to the adaptation of the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in people to the European colonization that began in the late 19th century.

==Climate and ecology==
Klondike has a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;), bordering on a tundra climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;). The climate is warm in the short summer, and very cold during the long winter. By late October, ice forms over the rivers. For the majority of the year, the ground is frozen to a depth of . The landscape is dominated by spruce, aspen, and birch trees interspersed with riparian vegetation.

Salmon have likely been migrating from the Pacific Ocean to the Klondike River to spawn for at least 65,000 years, and archeological evidence suggests that they have been fished as early as 11,500 years ago. Caribou also migrate through the Klondike region during their seasonal migrations. Other species found in the region include moose, black bear, grizzly bear, lynx, marten, wolf, wolverine, Dall&#x27;s sheep, and beaver.

There is a weather station for Klondike located along the Dempster Highway, near the southern entrance of Tombstone Territorial Park, at an elevation of 973 m (3192 ft).
== Politics ==
Klondike is a district of the Legislative Assembly of Yukon. The former Premier of the Yukon, Liberal Sandy Silver, represents the electoral district of Klondike.

== History ==

The Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in people have continuously occupied the Klondike region for over 9000 years, and UNESCO has stated this was &quot;fundamentally transformed during the colonial occupation of these lands.&quot; European traders began to arrive in the region in the mid 19th century, and in 1874, the first trading post in the Klondike (Fort Reliance) was established. Soon after, in 1876, the Indian Act was passed (without Indigenous negotiation), which restricted the ability of Indigenous Canadians to continue their cultural practices and live in their original lands. This act and the discovery of precious metals in the area led to a steady increase in the arrival of colonists during the 1880s, and in 1893, the first permanent non-Indigenous settlement was founded at Ch’ëdähdëk (Forty Mile), at the site of an ancient indigenous hunting spot. When gold was discovered nearby in 1896, several boomtowns were founded and the landscape around the Klondike transformed into an industrial hub. Nearly 30,000 people arrived in Dawson City over the next few years. In mid-1901 an expedition left California hoping to prove that the Klondike was the site of the Biblical Garden of Eden. It was sponsored ($50,000) by Morris Ketchum Jesup with an American naturalist (Norman Buxton) and two Russian scientists (Waldemar Bogoras and Waldemar Jochelson). The Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in were forced to relocate downriver to an ancestral camp called Moosehide, where it became the center of the Indigenous community until the 1950s.

After the Klondike Gold Rush ended near the turn of the 20th century, many of the boomtowns quickly became ghost towns, but Dawson City remained the capital of the Yukon until 1953 (when the capital was moved to Whitehorse).

==Tr’ondëk-Klondike World Heritage Site==

Several archaeological sites in the Klondike were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2023 as a cultural landscape, described as follows: The site contains eight subsites:

These sites show archaeological evidence of the transition from Indigenous to European land use, and the interactions between the two cultures. In total, the World Heritage Site includes 8 distinct properties.

* Fort Reliance: the first trading post in the Klondike, built in 1874.
* Ch’ëdähdëk (Forty Mile): A traditional hunting location and the oldest European settlement in the Yukon, which was abandoned during the nearby Klondike Gold Rush.
* Ch’ëdähdëk Tth’än K’et (Dënezhu Graveyard): A First Nations cemetery with approximately 22 graves.
* Fort Cudahy and Fort Constantine: Forts established in 1893 and 1895 and abandoned shortly thereafter.
* Tr&#x27;ochëk: A traditional fishing camp
* Dawson City: The major city and industrial hub of the Yukon during the Klondike Gold Rush.
* Jëjik Dhä Dënezhu Kek’it (Moosehide Village): An important gathering place for the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in First Nation and where they relocated during the European expansion.
* Tthe Zra¸y Kek’it (Black City): an archeological site and abandoned Indigenous settlement used in the 19th century to take advantage of trade with the influx of European colonists.
