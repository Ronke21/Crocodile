<text>Marion Robert Morrison (May 26, 1907 – June 11, 1979), professionally known as John Wayne and nicknamed &quot;the Duke&quot;, was an American actor who became a popular icon through his starring roles in films which were produced during Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age, especially in Western and war movies. His career flourished from the silent era of the 1920s through the American New Wave, as he appeared in a total of 179 film and television productions. He was among the top box-office draws for three decades and appeared with many other important Hollywood stars of his era. In 1999, the American Film Institute selected Wayne as one of the greatest male stars of classic American cinema.

Wayne was born in Winterset, Iowa, but grew up in Southern California. After losing his football scholarship to the University of Southern California due to a bodysurfing accident, he began working for the Fox Film Corporation. He appeared mostly in small parts, but his first leading role came in Raoul Walsh&#x27;s Western &quot;The Big Trail&quot; (1930), an early widescreen film epic that was a box-office failure. He played leading roles in numerous during the 1930s, most of them also Westerns, without becoming a major name. John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1939) made Wayne a mainstream star, and he starred in 142 motion pictures altogether. According to biographer Ronald Davis, &quot;John Wayne personified for millions the nation&#x27;s frontier heritage.&quot;

Wayne&#x27;s other roles in Westerns included a cattleman driving his herd on the Chisholm Trail in &quot;Red River&quot; (1948), a Civil War veteran whose niece is abducted by a tribe of Comanches in &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956), a troubled rancher competing with a lawyer (James Stewart) for a woman&#x27;s hand in &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot; (1962), and a cantankerous one-eyed marshal in &quot;True Grit&quot; (1969), for which he received the Academy Award for Best Actor. Wayne is also remembered for his roles in &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; (1952) with Maureen O&#x27;Hara, &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; (1959) with Dean Martin, and &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962). In his final screen performance, he starred as an aging gunfighter battling cancer in &quot;The Shootist&quot; (1976). Wayne made his last public appearance at the Academy Awards ceremony on April 9, 1979, and died of stomach cancer two months later. In 1980, he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor of the United States.

==Early life==

Wayne was born Marion Robert Morrison on May 26, 1907, at 224 South Second Street in Winterset, Iowa. The local paper, &quot;Winterset Madisonian&quot;, reported on page 4 of the edition of May 30, 1907, that Wayne weighed 13 lb (around 6 kg) at birth. Wayne claimed his middle name was soon changed from Robert to Michael when his parents decided to name their next son Robert, but extensive research has found no such legal change, although it might have been changed informally or the documentation may have been lost. Wayne&#x27;s legal name apparently remained Marion Robert Morrison his entire life although to this day his original name is almost always referred to as Marion Michael Morrison.

Wayne&#x27;s father, Clyde Leonard Morrison (1884–1937), was the son of American Civil War veteran Marion Mitchell Morrison (1845–1915). Wayne&#x27;s mother, the former Mary &quot;Molly&quot; Alberta Brown (1885–1970), was from Lancaster County, Nebraska. Wayne had Scottish, Scotch-Irish, English, and Irish ancestry. His great-great-grandfather Robert Morrison (b. 1782) left County Antrim, Ireland, with his mother, arriving in New York in 1799 and eventually settling in Adams County, Ohio. The Morrisons were originally from the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. He was raised Presbyterian.

Wayne&#x27;s family moved to Palmdale, California, and then in 1916 to Glendale at 404 Isabel Street, where his father worked as a pharmacist. He attended Glendale Union High School, where he performed well in both sports and academics. Wayne was part of his high school&#x27;s football team and its debating team. He was also the president of the Latin Society and contributed to the school&#x27;s newspaper sports column.

A local fireman at the station on his route to school in Glendale started calling him &quot;Little Duke&quot; because he never went anywhere without his huge Airedale Terrier, Duke. He preferred &quot;Duke&quot; to &quot;Marion&quot;, and the nickname stuck. Wayne attended Wilson Middle School in Glendale. As a teen, he worked in an ice-cream shop for a man who shod horses for Hollywood studios. He was also active as a member of the Order of DeMolay. He played football for the 1924 league champion Glendale High School team.

Wayne applied to the U.S. Naval Academy, but was not accepted due to poor grades. Instead, he attended the University of Southern California (USC), majoring in pre-law. He was a member of the Trojan Knights and Sigma Chi fraternities. Wayne, who stood tall, also played on the USC football team under coach Howard Jones. A broken collarbone injury curtailed his athletic career; Wayne later noted that he was too terrified of Jones&#x27; reaction to reveal the actual cause of his injury, a bodysurfing accident. He lost his athletic scholarship, and without funds, had to leave the university.

== Career ==

=== Early works and first lead role ===
As a favor to coach Jones, who had given silent Western film star Tom Mix tickets to USC games, director John Ford and Mix hired Wayne as a prop boy and extra. Wayne later credited his walk, talk, and persona to his acquaintance with Wyatt Earp, who was good friends with Tom Mix. Wayne soon moved to bit parts, establishing a longtime friendship with the director who provided most of those roles, John Ford. Early in this period, he had a minor, uncredited role as a guard in the 1926 film &quot;Bardelys the Magnificent&quot;. Wayne also appeared with his USC teammates playing football in &quot;Brown of Harvard&quot; (1926), &quot;The Dropkick&quot; (1927), and &quot;Salute&quot; (1929) and Columbia&#x27;s &quot;Maker of Men&quot; (filmed in 1930, released in 1931).While working for Fox Film Corporation in bit roles, Wayne was given on-screen credit as &quot;Duke Morrison&quot; only once, in &quot;Words and Music&quot; (1929). Director Raoul Walsh saw him moving studio furniture while working as a prop boy and cast him in his first starring role in &quot;The Big Trail&quot; (1930). For his screen name, Walsh suggested &quot;Anthony Wayne&quot;, after Revolutionary War General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne. Fox Studios chief Winfield Sheehan rejected it as sounding &quot;too Italian&quot;. Walsh then suggested &quot;John Wayne&quot;. Sheehan agreed, and the name was set. Wayne was not even present for the discussion. His pay was raised to $105 a week.

&quot;The Big Trail&quot; was to be the first big-budget outdoor spectacle of the sound era, made at a then-staggering cost over $2 million (over $32.8 million equivalent in 2021), using hundreds of extras and wide vistas of the American Southwest, still largely unpopulated at the time. To take advantage of the breathtaking scenery, it was filmed in two versions, a standard 35 mm version and another in the new 70 mm Grandeur film process, using an innovative camera and lenses. Many in the audience who saw it in Grandeur stood and cheered, but only a handful of theaters were equipped to show the film in its widescreen process, and the effort was largely wasted at the time. The film was considered a huge box-office flop at the time, but came to be highly regarded by modern critics.

=== Subsequent films, breakthrough, and war years ===



After the commercial failure of &quot;The Big Trail&quot;, Wayne was relegated to small roles in A pictures, including Columbia&#x27;s &quot;The Deceiver&quot; (1931), in which he played a corpse. He appeared in the serial &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1933), an updated version of the Alexandre Dumas novel in which the protagonists were soldiers in the French Foreign Legion in then-contemporary North Africa. He played the lead, with his name over the title, in many low-budget Poverty Row Westerns, mostly at Monogram Pictures and serials for Mascot Pictures Corporation. By Wayne&#x27;s own estimation, he appeared in about 80 of these horse operas from 1930 to 1939. In &quot;Riders of Destiny&quot; (1933), he became one of the first singing cowboys of film, albeit via dubbing. Wayne also appeared in some of the &quot;Three Mesquiteers&quot; Westerns, whose title was a play on the Dumas classic. He was mentored by stuntmen in riding and other Western skills. Stuntman Yakima Canutt and Wayne developed and perfected stunts and onscreen fisticuffs techniques that are still in use. One of the main innovations with which Wayne is credited in these early Poverty Row Westerns is allowing the good guys to fight as convincingly as the bad guys, by not always making them fight clean. Wayne claimed, &quot;Before I came along, it was standard practice that the hero must always fight clean. The heavy was allowed to hit the hero in the head with a chair or throw a kerosene lamp at him or kick him in the stomach, but the hero could only knock the villain down politely and then wait until he rose. I changed all that. I threw chairs and lamps. I fought hard and I fought dirty. I fought to win.&quot;

Wayne&#x27;s second breakthrough role came with John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1939). Because of Wayne&#x27;s B-movie status and track record in low-budget Westerns throughout the 1930s, Ford had difficulty getting financing for what was to be an A-budget film. After rejection by all the major studios, Ford struck a deal with independent producer Walter Wanger in which Claire Trevor—a much bigger star at the time—received top billing. &quot;Stagecoach&quot; was a huge critical and financial success, and Wayne became a mainstream star. Cast member Louise Platt credited Ford as saying at the time that Wayne would become the biggest star ever because of his appeal as the archetypal &quot;everyman&quot;.

America&#x27;s entry into World War II resulted in a deluge of support for the war effort from all sectors of society, and Hollywood was no exception. Wayne was exempted from service due to his age (34 at the time of Pearl Harbor) and family status (classified as 3-A – family deferment). Wayne repeatedly wrote to John Ford saying he wanted to enlist, on one occasion inquiring whether he could get into Ford&#x27;s military unit. Wayne did not attempt to prevent his reclassification as 1-A (draft eligible), but Republic Studios was emphatically resistant to losing him, since he was their only A-list actor under contract. Herbert J. Yates, president of Republic, threatened Wayne with a lawsuit if he walked away from his contract, and Republic Pictures intervened in the Selective Service process, requesting Wayne&#x27;s further deferment.

U.S. National Archives records indicate that Wayne, in fact, did make an application to serve in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), precursor to the modern CIA, but his bid was ultimately unsuccessful. Wayne toured U.S. bases and hospitals in the South Pacific for three months in 1943 and 1944, with the USO. During this trip, he carried out a request from William J. Donovan, head of the OSS, to assess whether General Douglas MacArthur, commander of the South West Pacific Area, or his staff were hindering the work of the OSS. Donovan later issued Wayne an OSS Certificate of Service to memorialize Wayne&#x27;s contribution to the OSS mission.

By many accounts, his failure to serve in the military later became the most painful part of his life. His widow later suggested that his patriotism in later decades sprang from guilt, writing: &quot;He would become a &#x27;superpatriot&#x27; for the rest of his life trying to atone for staying home.&quot;

Wayne&#x27;s first color film was &quot;The Shepherd of the Hills&quot; (1941), in which he co-starred with his longtime friend Harry Carey. The following year, he appeared in his only film directed by Cecil B. DeMille, the Technicolor epic &quot;Reap the Wild Wind&quot; (1942), in which he co-starred with Ray Milland and Paulette Goddard; it was one of the rare times he played a character with questionable values.

Like most Hollywood stars of his era, Wayne appeared as a guest on radio programs, such as: &quot;The Hedda Hopper Show&quot; and &quot;The Louella Parsons Show&quot;. He made a number of appearances in dramatic roles, mainly recreations for radio of his own film roles, on such programs as &quot;Screen Directors Playhouse&quot; and &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;. For six months in 1942, Wayne starred in his own radio adventure series, &quot;Three Sheets to the Wind&quot;, produced by film director Tay Garnett. In the series, an international spy/detective show, Wayne played Dan O&#x27;Brien, a detective who used alcoholism as a mask for his investigatory endeavors. The show was intended by Garnett to be a pilot of sorts for a film version, though the motion picture never came to fruition. No episodes of the series featuring Wayne seem to have survived, though a demonstration episode with Brian Donlevy in the leading role does exist. Wayne, not Donlevy, played the role throughout the series&#x27; run on NBC.

Director Robert Rossen offered the starring role in &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; (1949) to Wayne, but he refused, believing the script to be un-American in many ways. Broderick Crawford, who was eventually cast in the role, won the 1949 Oscar for best male actor, ironically beating out Wayne, who had been nominated for &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima&quot; (1949).

=== 1950s ===
He lost the leading role of Jimmy Ringo in &quot;The Gunfighter&quot; (1950) to Gregory Peck due to his refusal to work for Columbia Pictures because its chief, Harry Cohn, had mistreated him years before when he was a young contract player. Cohn had bought the project for Wayne, but Wayne&#x27;s grudge was too deep, and Cohn sold the script to Twentieth Century Fox, which cast Peck in the role Wayne badly wanted, but for which he refused to bend.

Batjac, the production company co-founded by Wayne in 1952, was named after the fictional shipping company Batjak in &quot;Wake of the Red Witch&quot; (1948), a film based on the novel by Garland Roark. (A spelling error by Wayne&#x27;s secretary was allowed to stand, accounting for the variation.) Batjac (and its predecessor, Wayne-Fellows Productions) was the arm through which Wayne produced many films for himself and other stars. Its best-known non-Wayne productions were &quot;Seven Men From Now&quot; (1956), which started the classic collaboration between director Budd Boetticher and star Randolph Scott, and &quot;Gun the Man Down&quot; (1956) with contract player James Arness as an outlaw.

One of Wayne&#x27;s most popular roles was in &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot; (1954), directed by William Wellman, and based on a novel by Ernest K. Gann. His portrayal of a heroic copilot won widespread acclaim. Wayne also portrayed aviators in &quot;Flying Tigers&quot; (1942), &quot;Flying Leathernecks&quot; (1951), &quot;Island in the Sky&quot; (1953), &quot;The Wings of Eagles&quot; (1957), and &quot;Jet Pilot&quot; (1957).

He appeared in nearly two dozen of John Ford&#x27;s films over 20 years, including &quot;She Wore a Yellow Ribbon&quot; (1949), &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; (1952), and &quot;The Wings of Eagles&quot; (1957). The first movie in which he called someone &quot;Pilgrim&quot;, Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956), is often considered to contain Wayne&#x27;s finest and most complex performance.

On May 14, 1958, Hal Kanter&#x27;s &quot;I Married a Woman&quot; starring George Gobel and Diana Dors had its Los Angeles opening. In it, Wayne had a cameo as himself. On October 2, John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Barbarian and the Geisha&quot;, in which Wayne played the lead and clashed with his director all the way, had its New York opening.

Howard Hawks&#x27;s &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; premiered on March 18, 1959. In it, Wayne plays the lead with a supporting cast including Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, Angie Dickinson, Walter Brennan and Ward Bond. John Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Horse Soldiers&quot; had its world premiere in Shreveport, Louisiana on June 18. Set during the Civil War, Wayne shares the lead with William Holden.

Wayne notoriously portrayed Genghis Khan in &quot;The Conqueror&quot; (1956), which was panned by critics.

=== 1960s ===

In 1960, Wayne directed and produced &quot;The Alamo&quot; portraying Davy Crockett, with Richard Widmark as Jim Bowie. Wayne was nominated for an Oscar as the producer in the Best Picture category. That year Wayne also played the lead in Henry Hathaway&#x27;s &quot;North to Alaska&quot; also starring Stewart Granger and Ernie Kovacs. In 1961, Wayne shared the lead with Stuart Whitman in Michael Curtiz&#x27;s &quot;The Comancheros&quot;.

On May 23, 1962, Wayne starred in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot; with James Stewart. May 29 marked the premiere of Howard Hawks&#x27;s &quot;Hatari!&quot;, shot on location in Africa with Wayne playing the lead capturing wild animals from the beds of trucks; all the scenes with animals in the film are real. On October 4, &quot;The Longest Day&quot; started its theatrical run, with Wayne memorably acting with an ensemble cast. Although the other top-level actors in the film accepted a token payment of only $10,000 each to play their roles, making the all-star cast feasible for the budget, Wayne was paid a quarter of a million dollars due to an earlier dispute with producer Darryl F. Zanuck. During this time, the cast of the television drama, &quot;Combat!&quot;, were preparing for the inaugural season. The principal cast (including Vic Morrow) were to go through a week of basic training at the Army&#x27;s Infantry Training Center at Fort Ord in northern California. Morrow noted that the instructors who worked with the cast at Fort Ord had one common request: not to act like John Wayne. &quot;Poor John,&quot; Morrow told a reporter. &quot;I wonder if he knows he&#x27;s almost a dirty word in the Army.&quot;

On February 20, 1963, Wayne acted in a segment of &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; directed by John Ford. On June 12, Wayne played the lead in his final John Ford film, &quot;Donovan&#x27;s Reef&quot;, co-starring Lee Marvin. On November 13, another film starring Wayne premiered, Andrew V. McLaglen&#x27;s &quot;McLintock!&quot;, once again opposite Maureen O&#x27;Hara.

In 1964, Wayne played the leading role in Henry Hathaway&#x27;s &quot;Circus World&quot; with Claudia Cardinale and Rita Hayworth.

On February 15, 1965, Wayne played the brief cameo role of a centurion in George Stevens&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;. On April 6, he shared the screen with Kirk Douglas and Patricia Neal in Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot;. On June 13, he acted in Henry Hathaway&#x27;s &quot;The Sons of Katie Elder&quot; with Dean Martin.

In 1966, Wayne appeared in a cameo role for Melville Shavelson&#x27;s &quot;Cast a Giant Shadow&quot; starring Kirk Douglas.

On May 24, 1967, Wayne played the lead in Burt Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;The War Wagon&quot; with Kirk Douglas as the second lead. His second movie that year, Howard Hawks&#x27;s &quot;El Dorado&quot;, a highly successful partial remake of &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; with Robert Mitchum playing Dean Martin&#x27;s original role, premiered on June 7.

In 1968, Wayne co-directed with Ray Kellogg &quot;The Green Berets&quot;, the only major film made during the Vietnam War in support of the war. Wayne wanted to make this movie because at that time Hollywood had little interest in making movies about the Vietnam War. During the filming of &quot;The Green Berets&quot;, the Degar or Montagnard people of Vietnam&#x27;s Central Highlands, fierce fighters against communism, bestowed on Wayne a brass bracelet that he wore in the film and all subsequent films. Also that year, Wayne played the lead in Andrew V. McLaglen&#x27;s &quot;Hellfighters&quot;, a film about the crews who put out oil rig fires. Katharine Ross played a supporting role.

On June 13, 1969, Henry Hathaway&#x27;s &quot;True Grit&quot; premiered. For his role as Rooster Cogburn, Wayne won the Best Actor Oscar at the Academy Awards. In November of that year another film starring Wayne was released, Andrew V. McLaglen&#x27;s &quot;The Undefeated&quot; with Rock Hudson.

=== 1970s: later career ===

On June 24, 1970, Andrew V. McLaglen&#x27;s &quot;Chisum&quot; started to play in cinemas. Wayne took the role of the owner of a cattle ranch, who finds out that a businessman is trying to own neighboring land illegally. On September 16, Howard Hawks&#x27; &quot;Rio Lobo&quot; premiered. Wayne played Col. Cord McNally, who confronts Confederate soldiers who stole a shipment of gold at the end of the Civil War. This was another remake of &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; albeit without a second lead the box office caliber of Dean Martin or Robert Mitchum.

In June 1971, George Sherman&#x27;s &quot;Big Jake&quot; made its debut. Wayne played the role of an estranged father who must track down a gang who kidnapped his grandson. The film was a critically acclaimed hit.

In 1972, Wayne starred in Mark Rydell&#x27;s &quot;The Cowboys.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who did not particularly care for the film, wrote: &quot;Wayne is, of course, marvelously indestructible, and he has become an almost perfect father figure&quot;. The same year, he was selected in the last round of the NFL draft by the Atlanta Falcons for his past football experience, though the pick was disallowed by league officials as he was 64 years old at the time.

On February 7, 1973, Burt Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;The Train Robbers&quot; opened; Wayne appeared alongside Ann-Margret, Rod Taylor and Ben Johnson. On June 27, Andrew V. McLaglen&#x27;s &quot;Cahill U.S. Marshal&quot; premiered, with Wayne, George Kennedy and Gary Grimes. It was a box office failure.

In 1974, Wayne took on the role of the eponymous detective in John Sturges&#x27;s crime drama &quot;McQ&quot;.

On March 25, 1975, Douglas Hickox&#x27;s &quot;Brannigan&quot; premiered. In it, Wayne played a Chicago police lieutenant named Jim Brannigan on the hunt in London for an organized-crime leader. On October 17, &quot;Rooster Cogburn&quot; started its theatrical run; Wayne reprised his role as U.S. Marshal Reuben J. &quot;Rooster&quot; Cogburn with strong elements of the plot of &quot;The African Queen&quot; along with Katharine Hepburn as his leading lady.

In 1976, Wayne starred in Don Siegel&#x27;s &quot;The Shootist&quot;, also starring Lauren Bacall, Ron Howard and James Stewart. It was Wayne&#x27;s final cinematic role, whose main character, J. B. Books, was dying of cancer, to which Wayne himself succumbed three years later. It contains numerous plot similarities to &quot;The Gunfighter&quot; of nearly 30 years before, a role which Wayne had wanted, but turned down. Upon its theatrical release, it grossed $13,406,138 domestically. About $6 million were earned as US theatrical rentals. The film received positive reviews. It was named one of the Ten Best Films of 1976 by the National Board of Review. Film critic Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; ranked &quot;The Shootist&quot; number 10 on his list of the 10 best films of 1976. The film was nominated for an Oscar, a Golden Globe, a BAFTA film award, and a Writers Guild of America award.

==Personal life==
Wayne was married three times and divorced twice. His wives included one of Spanish American descent, Josephine Alicia Saenz, and two from Latin America, Esperanza Baur and Pilar Pallete. He had four children with Josephine: Michael Wayne (1934–2003), Mary Antonia &quot;Toni&quot; Wayne LaCava (1936–2000), Patrick Wayne (born 1939), and Melinda Wayne Munoz (1940–2022). He had three more children with Pilar: Aissa Wayne (born 1956), John Ethan Wayne (born 1962), and Marisa Wayne (born 1966).

 Several of Wayne&#x27;s children entered the film and television industry. Son Ethan was billed as John Ethan Wayne in a few films, and played one of the leads in the 1990s update of the &quot;Adam-12&quot; television series. Ethan has also appeared on the History Channel show &quot;Pawn Stars&quot; to help authenticate merchandise supposedly related to his father&#x27;s career. Granddaughter Jennifer Wayne, daughter of Aissa, is a member of the country music group Runaway June.

 In 1973, Wayne was encouraged by Pilar, an avid tennis player, to build the John Wayne Tennis Club in Newport Beach, California. In 1995, the club was sold to Ken Stuart, former general manager, and became the Palisades Tennis Club. In &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; (1952), Wayne tells Michaeleen &quot;Óge&quot; Flynn (portrayed by Barry Fitzgerald) that he is six feet &quot;four and a half&quot; (194 cm), an assertion corroborated by Pilar&#x27;s book &quot;John Wayne: My Life With the Duke&quot;.

His divorce from Esperanza Baur, a Mexican former actress, was stormy. She believed that Wayne and co-star Gail Russell were having an affair, a claim that both Wayne and Russell denied. The night the film &quot;Angel and the Badman&quot; (1947) wrapped, the usual party was held for cast and crew, and Wayne came home very late. Esperanza was in a drunken rage by the time he arrived, and she attempted to shoot him as he walked through the front door.

Wayne had several high-profile affairs, including one with Merle Oberon that lasted from 1938 to 1947. After his separation from Pilar, in 1973, Wayne became romantically involved and lived with his former secretary Pat Stacy (1941–1995) until his death in 1979. Stacy published a book about her life with him in 1983, titled &quot;Duke: A Love Story&quot;.

Wayne&#x27;s hair began to thin in the 1940s, and he had begun to wear a hairpiece by the end of the decade. He was occasionally seen in public without the hairpiece (such as, according to &quot;Life&quot;, at Gary Cooper&#x27;s funeral). During an appearance at Harvard University, Wayne was asked by a student, &quot;Is it true that your toupée is real mohair?&quot; He responded: &quot;[...] sir, that&#x27;s real hair. Not mine, but real hair.&quot;

A close friend, California Congressman Alphonzo E. Bell Jr., wrote of Wayne: &quot;Duke&#x27;s personality and sense of humor were very close to what the general public saw on the big screen. It is perhaps best shown in these words he had engraved on a plaque: &#x27;Each of us is a mixture of some good and some not so good qualities. In considering one&#x27;s fellow man, it&#x27;s important to remember the good things. ... We should refrain from making judgments just because a fella happens to be a dirty, rotten S.O.B.&#x27;&quot;

Wayne was fond of literature, his favorite authors being Charles Dickens, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Agatha Christie. His favorite books were &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, and Conan Doyle&#x27;s historical novels &quot;The White Company&quot; and &quot;Sir Nigel&quot;.

Wayne was a chess player. Roger Ebert recalls that on the set of &quot;Chisum&quot;, &quot;we were playing a chess game, both of us bending over the board on an upended apple crate. Wayne, slouched in his old stitched leather director&#x27;s chair, had a crowd of kibitzers: wranglers, extras, old cronies, drinking buddies, a couple of Mexican stuntmen. He studied the board, roared with laughter, and said, &#x27;God...damn it! You&#x27;ve trapped my queen!&#x27; We studied the board. I made a decisive move. &#x27;Why the &quot;hell&quot; did I just say that?&#x27; he asked. If I hadn&#x27;t-a...said it, you wouldn&#x27;t-a...seen it.&#x27;&quot; According to Michael Munn, when Wayne was asked about Rock Hudson&#x27;s sexuality, he replied, &quot;Who the hell cares if he&#x27;s a queer? The man plays great chess.&quot;

He used the same 1873 Colt Single Action Army revolver in many of the Westerns in which he appeared.

Wayne had been a chain smoker of cigarettes since young adulthood and was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1964. He underwent successful surgery to remove his entire left lung and two ribs. Despite efforts by his business associates to prevent him from going public with his illness for fear that it would cost him work, Wayne announced he had cancer and called on the public to get preventive examinations. Five years later, Wayne was declared cancer-free. Wayne has been credited with coining the term &quot;the Big C&quot; as a euphemism for cancer. Wayne biographer Michael Munn chronicled Wayne&#x27;s drinking habits. According to Sam O&#x27;Steen&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Cut to the Chase&quot;, studio directors knew to shoot Wayne&#x27;s scenes before noon, because by afternoon, he &quot;was a mean drunk&quot;. Roger Ebert quotes him as saying: &quot;Tequila makes your head hurt. Not from your hangover. From falling over and hitting your head.&quot;

He was a very active Freemason. He was made a Master Mason at Marion McDaniel Lodge No. 56 F&amp;AM, in Tucson, Arizona. He became a 32nd Degree Scottish Rite Mason and later joined the Al Malaikah Shrine Temple in Los Angeles, along with fellow actor Roy Rogers. He later became a member of the York Rite. During his childhood, he was a member of a local Demolay chapter in Glendale.

During the early 1960s, Wayne traveled often to Panama, and he purchased the island of Taborcillo off that nation&#x27;s Pacific coast. It was sold by his estate at his death.

Wayne&#x27;s yacht, the &quot;Wild Goose&quot;, was one of his favorite possessions. He kept it docked in Newport Beach Harbor, and it was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2011.

==Political and social views==

Throughout most of his life, Wayne was a vocally prominent conservative Republican in Hollywood, supporting anti-communist positions. However, he voted for Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1936 presidential election and expressed admiration for Roosevelt&#x27;s successor, fellow Democratic President Harry S. Truman, despite having supported Republican candidate Thomas E. Dewey in 1948. He took part in creating the conservative Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals in February 1944 before being elected its president in 1949. An ardent anti-communist and vocal supporter of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), he made &quot;Big Jim McLain&quot; (1952) with himself as a HUAC investigator to demonstrate his support for the cause of anti-communism. His personal views found expression as a proactive inside enforcer of the &quot;Black List&quot;, denying employment and undermining careers of many actors and writers who had expressed their personal political beliefs earlier in life. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin is alleged to have said that Wayne should be assassinated for his frequently espoused anti-communist politics, despite being a fan of his movies. Wayne was a supporter of Senator Joseph McCarthy.

Wayne supported Vice President Richard Nixon in the presidential election of 1960, but expressed his vision of patriotism when John F. Kennedy won the election: &quot;I didn&#x27;t vote for him, but he&#x27;s my president, and I hope he does a good job.&quot; He used his star power to support conservative causes, including rallying support for the Vietnam War by producing, co-directing, and starring in the financially successful film &quot;The Green Berets&quot; (1968). In 1960, he joined the anti-communist John Birch Society, but quit after the organization denounced fluoridation of water supplies as a communist plot. In 1964, Wayne was a staunch supporter of Barry Goldwater, and actively campaigned for him.

Due to his status as the highest-profile Republican star in Hollywood, wealthy Texas Republican Party backers asked Wayne to run for national office in 1968, like his friend and fellow actor Senator George Murphy. He declined, joking that he did not believe the public would seriously consider an actor in the White House. Instead, he supported his friend Ronald Reagan&#x27;s campaigns for Governor of California in 1966 and 1970. He was asked to be the running mate for Democratic Alabama Governor George Wallace, who had been nominated for president by the American Independent Party, in his 1968 campaign, but he immediately rejected the offer and actively campaigned for Richard Nixon; Wayne addressed the 1968 Republican National Convention on its opening day.

In 1971, Wayne wrote to President Richard Nixon, who was a friend, to oppose Nixon&#x27;s planned trip to China. Wayne enclosed some hate literature on &quot;that Jew, Kissinger,&quot; who had negotiated the historic meeting with Chinese leaders.

Wayne openly differed with many conservatives over the issue of returning the Panama Canal, as he supported the Panama Canal Treaty in the mid-1970s; while Republican leaders such as Reagan, Jesse Helms, and Strom Thurmond had wanted the U.S. to retain full control of the canal, Wayne and fellow conservative William F. Buckley believed that the Panamanians had the right to the canal and sided with President Jimmy Carter. Wayne was a close friend of Panamanian leader Omar Torrijos Herrera, and Wayne&#x27;s first wife Josephine was a native of Panama. His support of the treaty brought him hate mail for the first time in his life.

In 1973, actor Marlon Brando refused an Oscar he had won, due to &quot;the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry&quot;; Brando did not attend the award ceremony but asked Native American civil rights activist Sacheen Littlefeather to attend and deliver a refusal speech in the event that he won. Wayne was allegedly waiting in the wings and was so angry about her presence there that Littlefeather said &quot;he was coming towards me to forcibly take me off the stage, and he had to be restrained by six security men to prevent him from doing so.&quot; However, an investigation in 2022 found that this is unlikely to have happened, and Littlefeather had no way of witnessing this take place.

Roger Ebert wrote that Wayne had a sense of humor about his politics. He recalls Wayne giving him a tour of his house: &quot;He pointed out autographed photos of Eisenhower, Nixon, Goldwater, and J. Edgar Hoover. I said I had to take a pee. On the wall of the bathroom opening off the den, he had a photo of Hubert Humphrey, inscribed &#x27;with warm appreciation for your continued Support.&#x27;&quot; Colorado Congresswoman Pat Schroeder recalled that &quot;John Wayne gave me a silver cigarette lighter during the Vietnam War that said &#x27;Fuck Communism&#x27; on it. I didn&#x27;t know how to do that. I still don&#x27;t.&quot;

Left-wing activist Abbie Hoffman paid tribute to Wayne&#x27;s singularity, saying, &quot;I like Wayne&#x27;s wholeness, his style. As for his politics, well—I suppose even cavemen felt a little admiration for the dinosaurs that were trying to gobble them up.&quot;

===1971 &quot;Playboy&quot; interview===

In May 1971, &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine published an interview with Wayne, in which he expressed his support for the Vietnam War, and made headlines for his opinions about social issues and race relations in the United States:

In the same &quot;Playboy&quot; interview, he also responded to questions about whether social programs were good for the country:
In February 2019, the &quot;Playboy&quot; interview resurfaced, which resulted in calls for John Wayne Airport to be renamed. John Wayne&#x27;s son, Ethan, defended him, stating: &quot;It would be an injustice to judge someone based on an interview that&#x27;s being used out of context.&quot; The calls for changing the airport&#x27;s name back to Orange County Airport were renewed during the George Floyd protests in June 2020. In October 2019, USC student activists called for removing an exhibit dedicated to Wayne, citing the interview. In July 2020, it was announced that the exhibit would be removed.

== Death ==
Although he enrolled in a cancer vaccine study in an attempt to ward off the disease, Wayne died of stomach cancer on June 11, 1979, aged 72, at the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was buried in the Pacific View Memorial Park Cemetery in Corona del Mar, Newport Beach. According to his son Patrick and his grandson Matthew Muñoz, who was a priest in the California Diocese of Orange, Wayne converted to Roman Catholicism shortly before his death. He requested that his tombstone read &quot;Feo, Fuerte y Formal&quot;, a Spanish epitaph Wayne described as meaning &quot;ugly, strong, and dignified&quot;. His grave, which was unmarked for 20 years, has been marked since 1999 with the quotation:

==Legacy==
===Acting evaluation===

In 1974, film critic Charles Champlin wrote of Wayne: &quot;Wayne is a motion picture actor, first, last and always, who defined as powerfully as anyone else what that means. From the lean and intense early days, in those low-cost dusters which still play on morning television, Wayne has had a presence which got through the lenses and shutters and onto the film undiminished.&quot; John Ford said of him: &quot;He&#x27;s not something out of a book, governed by acting rules. He portrays John Wayne, a rugged American guy. He&#x27;s not one of those method actors, like they send out here from drama schools in New York. He&#x27;s real, perfectly natural.&quot; Lee Strasberg observed that Wayne was similar to fellow actors Spencer Tracy and Gary Cooper, who &quot;try not to act but be themselves&quot;.

Wayne thought of himself as a reactor rather than an actor, and felt that the difference between good and bad acting was in acting and reacting. He explained this difference: &quot;In a bad picture, you see them acting all over the place. In a good picture, they react in a logical way to a situation they&#x27;re in, so the audience can identify with the actors.&quot; When asked about his approach to acting, Wayne commented: &quot;I read dramatic lines undramatically and react to situations normally. This is not as simple as it sounds. I&#x27;ve spent a major portion of my life trying to do it well and I am not past learning it yet.&quot; Much like many actors of his generation, Wayne disliked method acting, and once said of them: &quot;Let those actors who picked their noses get all the dialogue, just give me the close-up of reaction.&quot;

Howard Hawks, who directed him in five films, felt that after losing one of his lungs, Wayne became a much better actor. Hawks explained: &quot;Because of the lung Wayne lost, he reads his lines differently. He pauses in the strangest places simply because he hasn&#x27;t got the breath he used to have. This device is terribly effective, because you keep your eyes on him and wait for him to finish, because you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s coming next.&quot; Raoul Walsh noted: &quot;Wayne underacts, and it&#x27;s mighty effective, not because he tries to underactit&#x27;s a hard thing to do if you trybut because he can&#x27;t overact.&quot;

Despite his popularity at the box office, Wayne was often criticized for playing the same type of character during most of his career. In a 1969 interview with Roger Ebert, Wayne remarked: &quot;Of course, they give me that John Wayne stuff so much, claim I always play the same role. Seems like nobody remembers how different the fellows were in &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; or &quot;Iwo Jima,&quot; or &quot;Yellow Ribbon,&quot; where I was 35 playing a man of 65. To stay a star, you have to bring along some of your own personality. Thousands of good actors can carry a scene, but a star has to carry the scene and still, without intruding, allow some of his character into it.&quot;

Gene Hackman said that Wayne &quot;was one of the best actors ever. You must admire how really good he was as an actor, in command of the scene and with such great charisma.&quot;

===Awards, celebrations, and landmarks===

Wayne&#x27;s enduring status as an iconic American was formally recognized by the U.S. government in the form of the two highest civilian decorations. On his 72nd birthday on May 26, 1979, Wayne was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. Hollywood figures and American leaders from across the political spectrum, including Maureen O&#x27;Hara, Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, Mike Frankovich, Katharine Hepburn, General and Mrs. Omar Bradley, Gregory Peck, Robert Stack, James Arness, and Kirk Douglas, testified to Congress in support of the award. Robert Aldrich, president of the Directors Guild of America, made a particularly notable statement:

Wayne was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom on June 9, 1980, by President Jimmy Carter. He had attended Carter&#x27;s inaugural ball in 1977 &quot;as a member of the loyal opposition&quot;, as he described it. In 1998, he was awarded the Naval Heritage Award by the US Navy Memorial Foundation for his support of the Navy and military during his film career. In 1999, the American Film Institute named Wayne 13th among the Greatest Male Screen Legends of classic Hollywood cinema.

In the essay &quot;John Wayne: A Love Song&quot;, Joan Didion recalls the first time she saw Wayne in a movie: &quot;it was there, that summer of 1943 while the hot wind blew outside, that I first saw John Wayne. Saw the walk, heard the voice. Heard him tell the girl in a picture called &quot;War of the Wildcats&quot; that he would build her a house, &#x27;at the bend in the river where the cottonwoods grow.&#x27; As it happened I did not grow up to be kind of woman who is the heroine in a Western, and although the men I have known have had many virtues and have taken me to live in many places I have come to love, they have never been John Wayne, and they have never taken me to that bend in the river where the cottonwoods grow. Deep in that part of my heart where the artificial rain forever falls, that is still the line I want to hear... When John Wayne rode through my childhood, and perhaps through yours, he determined forever the shapes of certain of our dreams. It did not seem possible that such a man could fall ill, could carry within him that most inexplicable and ungovernable of diseases.&quot;

Various public locations are named in honor of Wayne, including the John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, where a bronze equestrian statue of him stands at the entrance; the John Wayne Marina for which Wayne bequeathed the land, near Sequim, Washington; John Wayne Elementary School (P.S. 380) in Brooklyn, New York, which boasts a mosaic mural commission by New York artist Knox Martin entitled &quot;John Wayne and the American Frontier&quot;; and over named the &quot;John Wayne Pioneer Trail&quot; in Washington&#x27;s Iron Horse State Park. A larger-than-life-sized bronze statue of Wayne atop a horse was erected at the corner of La Cienega Boulevard and Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, California, at the former offices of the Great Western Savings and Loan Corporation, for which Wayne had made a number of commercials. In the city of Maricopa, Arizona, part of Arizona State Route 347 is named John Wayne Parkway, which runs through the center of town.

In 2006, friends of Wayne and his former Arizona business partner, Louis Johnson, inaugurated the &quot;Louie and the Duke Classics&quot; events benefiting the John Wayne Cancer Foundation and the American Cancer Society. The weekend-long event each fall in Casa Grande, Arizona, includes a golf tournament, an auction of John Wayne memorabilia, and a team roping competition.

Several celebrations took place on May 26, 2007, the centennial of Wayne&#x27;s birth. A celebration at the John Wayne birthplace in Winterset, Iowa, included chuck-wagon suppers, concerts by Michael Martin Murphey and Riders in the Sky, a Wild West Revue in the style of Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West show, and a Cowboy Symposium with Wayne&#x27;s costars, producers, and costumers. Wayne&#x27;s films ran continuously at the local theater. Ground was broken for the new John Wayne Birthplace Museum and Learning Center at a ceremony consisting of over 30 of Wayne&#x27;s family members, including Melinda Wayne Muñoz, Aissa, Ethan, and Marisa Wayne. Later that year, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver inducted Wayne into the California Hall of Fame, located at the California Museum in Sacramento.

In 2016, Republican assemblyman Matthew Harper proposed marking May 26 as &quot;John Wayne Day&quot; in California. This resolution was struck down by a vote of 35 to 20, due to Wayne&#x27;s views on race and his support of controversial organizations such as the John Birch Society and the House Un-American Activities Committee.

===American icon===
Wayne rose beyond the typical recognition for a famous actor to that of an enduring icon who symbolized and communicated American values and ideals. Using the power of communication through silent films and radio, Wayne was instrumental in creating a national culture from disparate areas of the US, and made the creation of a national hero possible. By the middle of his career, Wayne had developed a larger-than-life image, and as his career progressed, he selected roles that would not compromise his off-screen image. Wayne embodied the image of strong American masculinity and rugged individualism in both his films and his life. At a party in 1957, Wayne confronted actor Kirk Douglas about the latter&#x27;s decision to play the role of Vincent van Gogh in the film &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, saying: &quot;Christ, Kirk, how can you play a part like that? There&#x27;s so goddamn few of us left. We got to play strong, tough characters. Not these weak queers.&quot; However, actor Marlon Brando was notably critical of Wayne&#x27;s public persona and of the cultural insensitivity of Wayne&#x27;s characters, arguing on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; that, &quot;We [Americans] like to see ourselves as perhaps John Wayne sees us. That we are a country that stands for freedom, for rightness, for justice,&quot; before adding that &quot;it just simply doesn&#x27;t apply.&quot;

Wayne&#x27;s rise to being the quintessential movie war hero began to take shape four years after World War II, when &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima&quot; (1949) was released. His footprints at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese theater in Hollywood were laid in concrete that contained sand from Iwo Jima. His status grew so large and legendary that when Japanese Emperor Hirohito visited the United States in 1975, he asked to meet John Wayne, the symbolic representation of his country&#x27;s former enemy. Likewise when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev visited the United States in 1959, he made two requests: to visit Disneyland and meet Wayne.

In the &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot; Top Ten Money-Making Western Stars poll, Wayne was listed in 1936 and 1939. He appeared in the similar &quot;Box Office&quot; poll in 1939 and 1940. While these two polls are really an indication only of the popularity of series stars, Wayne also appeared in the Top Ten Money Makers Poll of all films from 1949 to 1957 and 1958 to 1974, taking first place in 1950, 1951, 1954, and 1971. With a total of 25 years on the list, Wayne has more appearances than any other star, surpassing Clint Eastwood (21) who is in second place.

Wayne is the only actor to appear in every edition of the annual Harris Poll of Most Popular Film Actors, and the only actor to appear on the list after his death. Wayne was in the top 10 in this poll for 19 consecutive years, starting in 1994, 15 years after his death.

Mylène Demongeot declared in a 2015 filmed interview: &quot;Gary Cooper was sublime, there I have to say, now he, was part of the stars, Gary Cooper, Cary Grant, John Wayne, those great Americans who I&#x27;ve met really were unbelievable guys, there aren&#x27;t any like them anymore.&quot;

===John Wayne Cancer Foundation===
The John Wayne Cancer Foundation was founded in 1985 in honor of John Wayne, after his family granted the use of his name (and limited funding) for the continued fight against cancer. The foundation&#x27;s mission is to &quot;bring courage, strength, and grit to the fight against cancer&quot;. The foundation provides funds for innovative programs that improve cancer patient care, including research, education, awareness, and support.

===Dispute with Duke University===
Newport Beach, California-based John Wayne Enterprises, a business operated by Wayne&#x27;s heirs, sells products, including Kentucky straight Bourbon, bearing the &quot;Duke&quot; brand and using Wayne&#x27;s picture. When the company tried to trademark the image appearing on one of the bottles, Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, filed a notice of opposition. According to court documents, Duke has tried three times since 2005 to stop the company from trademarking the name. The company sought a declaration permitting registration of their trademark. The company&#x27;s complaint filed in federal court said the university did &quot;not own the word &#x27;Duke&#x27; in all contexts for all purposes.&quot; The university&#x27;s official position was not to object provided Wayne&#x27;s image appeared with the name. On September 30, 2014, Orange County, California federal judge David Carter dismissed the company&#x27;s suit, deciding the plaintiffs had chosen the wrong jurisdiction.

==Filmography==


Between 1926 and 1977, Wayne appeared in over 170 films. According to Quigley Polling, John Wayne was named the top money maker (as of 2005).

==Missed roles==
* Wayne turned down the lead role in the 1952 film &quot;High Noon&quot; because he felt the film&#x27;s story was an allegory against blacklisting, which he actively supported. In a 1971 interview, Wayne said he considered &quot;High Noon&quot; &quot;the most un-American thing I&#x27;ve ever seen in my whole life&quot;, and that he would &quot;never regret having helped run screenwriter Carl Foreman [who was later blacklisted] out of the country&quot;.
* An urban legend has it that in 1955, Wayne turned down the role of Matt Dillon in the long-running television series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; and recommended James Arness, instead. While he did suggest Arness for the part and introduced him in a prologue to the first episode, no film star of Wayne&#x27;s stature would have considered a television role at the time.
* Terry Southern&#x27;s biographer Lee Hill wrote that the role of Major T. J. &quot;King&quot; Kong in &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964) was originally written with Wayne in mind, and that Stanley Kubrick offered him the part after Peter Sellers injured his ankle during filming; he immediately turned it down. While Sellers went on to play three other roles in the film, Slim Pickens played Kong.
* In 1966, Wayne accepted the role of Major Reisman in &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; (1967), and asked Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for some script changes, but eventually withdrew from the project to make &quot;The Green Berets&quot;. He was replaced by Lee Marvin.
* Though Wayne actively campaigned for the title role in &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; (1971), Warner Bros. decided that at 63 he was too old, and cast the 41-year-old Clint Eastwood.
* In the early &#x27;70s, several years before the film was made, Wayne was offered the lead role in Michael Cimino&#x27;s &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; (1980), then under the title &quot;The Johnson County War&quot;. Wayne would later present the Best Picture prize to Cimino at the 1979 Oscars for &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; (1978).
* Director Peter Bogdanovich and screenwriter Larry McMurtry pitched a film in 1972 called &quot;The Streets of Laredo&quot; that would co-star Wayne along with James Stewart and Henry Fonda. They conceived it as a Western that would bring the final curtain down on Hollywood Westerns. Stewart and Fonda both agreed to appear in it, but after long consideration, Wayne turned it down, citing his feeling that his character was more underdeveloped and uninteresting than those of his co-stars, which was largely based on John Ford&#x27;s recommendation after perusing the script. The project was shelved for some 20 years, until McMurtry rewrote and expanded the original screenplay co-written with Bogdanovich to make the novel and subsequent TV miniseries &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;, with Tommy Lee Jones in Wayne&#x27;s role and Robert Duvall playing the part originally written for Stewart in the extremely popular miniseries.
* Mel Brooks offered Wayne the role of the Waco Kid (eventually played by Gene Wilder) in &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; (1974). After reading the script, Wayne declined, fearing the dialogue was &quot;too dirty&quot; for his family-friendly image, but told Brooks that he would be &quot;first in line&quot; to see the movie.
* Steven Spielberg offered both Wayne and Charlton Heston the role of Major General Joseph Stilwell in the film &quot;1941&quot; with Wayne also considered for a cameo in it. After reading the script, Wayne decided not to participate due to ill health, but also urged Spielberg not to pursue the project. Both Wayne and Heston felt the film was unpatriotic. Spielberg recalled, &quot;[Wayne] was really curious and so I sent him the script. He called me the next day and said he felt it was a very un-American movie, and I shouldn&#x27;t waste my time making it. He said, &#x27;You know, that was an important war, and you&#x27;re making fun of a war that cost thousands of lives at Pearl Harbor. Don&#x27;t joke about World War II&#x27;.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==

===Golden Globe Awards===

===Grammy Awards===

===Brass Balls Award===
In 1973, &quot;The Harvard Lampoon&quot;, a satirical paper run by Harvard University students, invited Wayne to receive The Brass Balls Award, created in his &quot;honor&quot;, after calling him &quot;the biggest fraud in history&quot;. Wayne accepted the invitation as a chance to promote the recently released film &quot;McQ&quot;, and a Fort Devens Army convoy offered to drive him into Harvard Square on an armored personnel carrier. The ceremony was held on January 15, 1974, at the Harvard Square Theater and the award was officially presented in honor of Wayne&#x27;s &quot;outstanding machismo and penchant for punching people&quot;. Although the convoy was met with protests by members of the American Indian Movement and others, some of whom threw snowballs, Wayne received a standing ovation from the audience when he walked onto the stage. An internal investigation was launched into the Army&#x27;s involvement in the day.

<doc id="16110" wikidata="Q319193" url="?curid=16110" title="Johnny Haynes">
<text>John Norman Haynes (17 October 1934 – 18 October 2005) was an English association footballer who played as an inside forward. He made 56 appearances for his country including 22 as captain. He was selected for three World Cup finals squads playing in the latter two of those. Nicknamed &quot;the Maestro&quot;, his attacking play was noted for two-footed passing ability, vision and deftness of touch. Haynes is widely regarded as Fulham&#x27;s greatest ever player, remaining loyal there for twenty years despite coming no nearer to a major trophy win than two FA Cup semi-final appearances. Immediately following the abolition of the £20 maximum wage in 1961, he became the first player to be paid £100 a week. He also had a spell on loan with Toronto City in 1961 and ended his playing days at Durban City, winning there the only trophy he won in his football career.

==Playing career==

The son of a post office engineer, Haynes was born in Kentish Town and supported Arsenal as a boy. He signed for Fulham as a 15-year-old amateur in 1950 when Fulham were in a three-season spell in the First Division. He was loaned to then non-League Wimbledon. He made his senior debut aged 18 in the 1952 Boxing Day visit of Southampton to Fulham, then in their first season back in the Second Division.

Haynes made his debut for England in October 1954, scoring a goal in a 2–0 victory over Northern Ireland in Belfast. He first captained England in 1960 and played for them in two World Cups.

He was one of many signatories of a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; on 17 July 1958 opposing &quot;the policy of apartheid&quot; in international sport and defending &quot;the principle of racial equality which is embodied in the Declaration of the Olympic Games&quot;.

Haynes played in his first of two FA Cup semi-finals in 1958. Fulham were eliminated in a replay by the remnants of Manchester United&#x27;s Busby Babes team that had been devastated by the Munich air disaster the month before. United were the first top-division team Fulham played in that cup run. Fulham were promoted to the top division after finishing runners-up behind Sheffield Wednesday in 1959. In the 1959–60 season, Fulham finished 10th in the First Division, which was their highest league position until finishing 9th in the 2003–04 Premier League season. Following the abolition of the £20 maximum wage in 1961, he became Britain&#x27;s first footballer to earn £100 per week. He played in a second FA Cup semi-final in 1962, losing in a replay to Burnley. In 1961, during the English off-season, he played abroad in the Eastern Canada Professional Soccer League with Toronto City.

In August 1962 on Blackpool promenade, the sports car in which he was returning late to his hotel was blown by a gust of wind into the path of another vehicle. Haynes suffered broken bones in both feet and a badly injured knee. He recounted that the police officer who attended the incident reassured him by saying &quot;Don&#x27;t worry son, you&#x27;ve only broken your legs&quot;. He missed almost the entire season and, when he returned to the Fulham side, was not quite the same player. Prior to the accident, he had captained England 22 times, and, being only 27, was expected to lead them in the 1966 FIFA World Cup, but he was never again selected for the national team.

Fulham were relegated in 1968. Haynes then had a single spell in football management, taking charge of Fulham for eighteen days in November that year after the dismissal of Bobby Robson as player-manager, but Haynes never had any ambition to go into coaching. That season, Fulham endured a second successive relegation. His last appearance for Fulham&#x27;s first team was on 17 January 1970 in a Third Division home match against Stockport County. In total, he made 657 appearances for Fulham and scored 157 goals.

In 1970, Haynes announced his retirement, aged 35, and joined Durban City, playing one season and winning South Africa&#x27;s 1970–71 National Football League. This was his only winner&#x27;s medal in senior football. During the 1972–73 season, Haynes made three league appearances for non-League club Wealdstone.

==Post-playing career==
On retiring from playing in 1970 he was already an active bookmaker. He sold his chain of bookmakers to The Tote in 1976. In 1985 he moved to Edinburgh, the city of his partner Avril. Haynes first met Avril in the 1960s when she travelled down to London to buy stock for boutiques she ran in Edinburgh. On moving to Edinburgh he ran a laundry business with Avril, played golf and watched local club, Heart of Midlothian. In 2004 he and Avril married in a private ceremony at Dalkeith registry office.

==Death==
On 17 October 2005, his 71st birthday, Haynes was driving his car, with Avril as passenger, on Edinburgh&#x27;s Dalry Road when he suffered a brain haemorrhage, instantaneously effectively rendering him brain-dead. The vehicle veered across the road and crashed into a van. After being kept on a ventilator for some 30 hours, the ventilator was turned off on the evening of 18 October 2005. The funeral at Mortonhall Crematorium was attended by ex-players Bobby Charlton, George Cohen, Sven-Göran Eriksson, Dave Mackay, Alan Mullery, Jimmy Murray and Bobby Robson, and also George Foulkes. Avril was unable to attend due to injuries from the car accident. Haynes was survived by Avril and his two stepchildren.

==Tributes==

In 2002 Haynes became an inaugural inductee into the English Football Hall of Fame in recognition of his football talents and impact on the English game.

On the day of Haynes&#x27; death, Alan Mullery, another ex-Fulham and England player, made the following tribute:
&quot;He was the only reason I went to Fulham as a young boy of 15 leaving school. He was my hero, the captain of England and Fulham. The word great rolls off the tongue quite easily these days but he really was. He was the best passer of a ball I have ever seen - I don&#x27;t know anyone who could pass a ball as accurately. Anyone who saw him will know what a great player he was.&quot;

Shortly after his death, the Stevenage Road Stand at Craven Cottage was renamed The Johnny Haynes Stand.

George Cohen, a World Cup winner for England in 1966 and a Fulham teammate of Johnny Haynes, stated:
&quot;I have a hundred individual memories of the beauty of John&#x27;s play. One stands out for the sheer perfection of his skill. It was a charity match which, but for that one second, has faded completely from my memory. The ball came to him at speed on a wet, slippery surface but with the slightest of adjustments, one that was almost imperceptible, he played it inside a full-back and into the path of an on-running winger. I looked at our coach Dave Sexton on the bench and he caught my glance and shook his head as if to say &#x27;fantastic&#x27;. Haynes could give you goose bumps on a wet night in a match that didn&#x27;t matter.&quot;

Bobby Moore, England captain from 1964 to 1973, said of him: &quot;Once you get used to watching that perfection you realised the rest of the secret. John was always available, always hungry for the ball, always wanting to play. I loved watching the player. Later I learnt to love the man.&quot; Pelé said he had &quot;never seen a better passer of the ball&quot; than Haynes.

The Fulham Supporters Trust stated: &quot;His dedication, skill, professionalism, grace and charm - both in his playing days and in retirement - serve as a poignant reminder to many of today&#x27;s footballers about what true greatness really means.&quot; On 28 July 2008, Fulham announced that fundraising had commenced, with the co-operation of a fan&#x27;s group, to produce a lasting tribute to Haynes. The Johnny Haynes Statue was unveiled outside the stadium before the 0–0 draw v Sunderland on Saturday 18 October 2008.

<text>John Thomas Sayles (born September 28, 1950) is an American independent film director, screenwriter, editor, actor, and novelist. He is known for writing and directing the films &quot;The Brother from Another Planet&quot; (1984), &quot;Matewan&quot; (1987), &quot;Eight Men Out&quot; (1988), &quot;Passion Fish&quot; (1992), &quot;The Secret of Roan Inish&quot; (1994), &quot;Lone Star&quot; (1996), and &quot;Men with Guns&quot; (1997).

For &quot;Eight Men Out&quot;, Sayles was nominated for the USC Scripter Award. He has twice been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, for &quot;Passion Fish&quot; and &quot;Lone Star&quot;. At the 56th Golden Globe Awards, &quot;Men with Guns&quot; was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film. His directorial debut, &quot;Return of the Secaucus 7&quot; (1980), as well as &quot;Matewan&quot; were added to the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 1997 and 2023, respectively.

==Early life==
Sayles was born on September 28, 1950, in Schenectady, New York, the son of Mary (&quot;née&quot; Rausch), a teacher, and Donald John Sayles, a school administrator. Both of Sayles&#x27;s parents were Catholic and of half-Irish descent. Sayles has referred to himself as a &quot;Catholic atheist&quot;. He attended Williams College with frequent collaborators Gordon Clapp and David Strathairn, as well as his longtime partner, Maggie Renzi. Sayles earned a B.A. in psychology in 1972.

==Career==

After college, Sayles moved to Boston where he worked a variety of blue-collar jobs while writing short stories for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. These writings culminated in his first novel, &quot;The Pride of the Bimbos&quot;, published in 1975.

Like Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola, Sayles began his film career working with Roger Corman. He was discovered by Frances Doel. Sayles has been called &quot;the greatest screenwriter to ever work at New World.&quot;

===Directorial debut===
In 1979, Sayles used $30,000 he earned writing scripts for Corman to fund his first film, &quot;Return of the Secaucus 7&quot;. To make the film on a limited budget, he set the film in a large house so that he did not have to travel to or get permits for different locations, set the story over a three-day weekend to limit costume changes, and wrote about people his age so he could cast his friends in it. The film received near-unanimous critical acclaim at the time and has held its reputation. In November 1997, the National Film Preservation Board announced that &quot;Return of the Secaucus 7&quot; would be one of the 25 films selected that year for preservation in the National Film Registry at the Library of Congress.

In 1983, after the films &quot;Baby It&#x27;s You&quot; (starring Rosanna Arquette) and &quot;Lianna&quot; (a story in which a married woman becomes discontented with her marriage and falls in love with another woman), Sayles received a MacArthur Fellowship. He put the money into the science fiction feature &quot;The Brother from Another Planet&quot;, a film about a three-toed humanoid who escapes bondage on another world and crash-lands in New York harbor; because he is Africanoid in appearance, he finds himself at home among the people of Harlem, being pursued by European-looking alien enslavers men in black.

In 1989, Sayles created and wrote the pilot episode for the short-lived television show &quot;Shannon&#x27;s Deal&quot; about a down-and-out Philadelphia lawyer played by Jamey Sheridan. Sayles received a 1990 Edgar Award for his teleplay for the pilot. The show ran for 16 episodes before being cancelled in 1991.

Sayles has funded most of his films by writing genre scripts, such as &quot;Piranha&quot;, &quot;Alligator&quot;, &quot;The Howling&quot;, and &quot;The Challenge&quot;. Having collaborated with Joe Dante on &quot;Piranha&quot; and &quot;The Howling&quot;, Sayles acted in Dante&#x27;s movie, &quot;Matinee&quot;. Sayles gets the rest of his funding by working as a script doctor; he did rewrites for &quot;Apollo 13&quot; and &quot;Mimic&quot;.

A genre script, called &quot;Night Skies&quot;, inspired what would eventually become the film &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;. That film&#x27;s director, Steven Spielberg, later commissioned Sayles to write a script (unused) for the fourth &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; film.

He has written and directed his own films, including &quot;Lone Star&quot;, &quot;Passion Fish&quot;, &quot;Eight Men Out&quot;, &quot;The Secret of Roan Inish,&quot; and &quot;Matewan&quot;. He serves on the advisory board for the Austin Film Society.
Maggie Renzi has been John Sayles&#x27;s long-time companion (and collaborator), but they have not married. Renzi has produced most of his films since &quot;Lianna&quot;. They met as students at Williams College.

Sayles works with a regular repertory of actors, most notably Chris Cooper, David Strathairn, and Gordon Clapp, each of whom has appeared in at least four of his films.

In early 2003, Sayles signed the Not In Our Name &quot;Statement of Conscience&quot; (along with Noam Chomsky, Steve Earle, Brian Eno, Jesse Jackson, Viggo Mortensen, Bonnie Raitt, Oliver Stone, Marisa Tomei, Susan Sarandon and others) which opposed the invasion of Iraq.

In February 2009, Sayles was reported to be writing an HBO series based on the early life of Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The drama, tentatively titled &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;, centers on Kiedis&#x27;s early years living in West Hollywood with his father. At that time, Kiedis&#x27;s father, known as Spider, sold drugs (according to legend, his clients included The Who and Led Zeppelin) and mingled with rock stars on the Sunset Strip, all while aspiring to get into show business.

In February 2010, Sayles began shooting his 17th feature film, the historical war drama &quot;Amigo&quot;, in the Philippines. The film is a fictional account of events during the Philippine–American War, with a cast that includes Joel Torre, Chris Cooper, and Garret Dillahunt.

His novel &quot;A Moment in the Sun&quot;, set during the same period as &quot;Amigo&quot;, in the Philippines, Cuba, and the U.S., was released in 2011 by McSweeney&#x27;s. It includes an account of the Wilmington Insurrection of 1898 in North Carolina, the only coup d&#x27;état in United States history in which a duly elected government was overthrown.

<text>Thomas John Digweed (born 1 January 1967) is a British DJ and record producer.As well as achieving success as a solo act, he has collaborated with Sasha as Sasha &amp; John Digweed, and with Nick Muir as Bedrock. Digweed was voted as No. 1 DJ in DJ Mag in 2001.

==Biography==
Digweed began DJing at the age of 15, and made a name for himself in his home town of Hastings, where he put on successful club nights, the most famous of which were his successful raves on Hastings Pier, where the likes of Carl Cox and The Prodigy performed. His breakthrough came in 1993, when he sent a mixtape demo to Geoff Oakes, founder of the Renaissance nightclub in Mansfield, who played it to fellow DJ Alexander Coe (aka Sasha). The two DJs struck up a long-term friendship and working relationship, despite Sasha twice failing to turn up for gigs that Digweed had booked him for in Hastings.

In partnership with Sasha, Digweed is known for promoting progressive house and notable for producing the first commercial compilation for a nightclub, when they released their 1994 compilation of mixes from Renaissance entitled &quot;&quot;. Until then, mixtapes from clubs had only been circulated by DJs on an amateur basis. The Renaissance CD was the first time that a compilation CD had been planned strategically for marketing, from artwork to promotion. The two DJs famously followed this up with their &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; compilations and those on &quot;Global Underground&quot;.

Digweed then started the record label Bedrock Records to further promote the music that he was playing at the time. He and his friend Nick Muir went on to produce under the Bedrock alias, getting their big break when their first track &quot;For What You Dream Of&quot; was used in the film Trainspotting. The Bedrock duo also produced the soundtrack for the MTV adult cartoon superhero drama series, &quot;Spider-Man: The New Animated Series&quot; in 2003. In his sets, Digweed is noted for adopting tracks with new and different styles.

Between 2000 and 2005, Digweed promoted his &quot;Bedrock&quot; sound with monthly club nights for club members and newcomers to the electronic music scene. He played on Thursday nights at Heaven in London, and on Friday nights in a smaller club night at The Beach in Brighton. These nights featured numerous guest DJs, including Danny Howells, Phil Thompson, Hernan Cattaneo and Chris Fortier. As Digweed&#x27;s international schedule increased, these events drew to a close, although occasional reunions have been held at Heaven since. He celebrated ten years of his Bedrock club night on 10 October 2008 at Matter in London, with a near on ten-hour set.

Digweed has enjoyed popularity throughout North America as well as Europe. He and Sasha established a monthly residency at the now defunct New York club Twilo, which proved a key location for the American electronic music scene. The residency began in 1997 with a lukewarm reception, but grew into one of the most popular club nights in New York City by the end of its run in 2001. He also played in 2001 for 11 hours at the legendary club Cavo Paradiso, located at the island of Mykonos in Greece. Sasha and Digweed played at Twilo on the last Friday of every month, playing sets that lasted between eight and twelve hours. In early 2001, Sasha suffered an ear injury and was unable to play for their last four dates before Twilo was closed by the New York City authorities. Digweed continued to play the time-slot by himself until 6 May 2001, when Twilo was raided by the NYPD and subsequently forced to close down.

Digweed has a cameo of himself playing music in Greg Harrison&#x27;s 2000 movie &quot;Groove&quot;, which tells the story of an all-night rave in San Francisco.

In early 2002, Digweed along with Sasha and Jimmy Van M undertook a six-week countrywide tour of the United States called Delta Heavy. The tour was promoted by Clear Channel and attendance reached 85,000. It took place in a variety of venues but was completely self-reliant from a technical point of view; sound, lights, and visual setups were brought along to every gig of the tour. Also in 2002, Digweed curated and compiled the soundtrack to the film &quot;Stark Raving Mad&quot;.

From September 2000 to January 2011, Digweed hosted a weekly two-hour radio show on Kiss 100 in the UK, in which he played the first hour of music and a guest DJ played the second hour. Beginning in September 2006, his show was available on all three Kiss radio stations. By that time, the show&#x27;s name had become Transitions, which was also the name of a four-volume series of mix albums by Digweed that was released every six months during 2006–2008. In January 2011, Transitions aired for the last time on Kiss 100, but the show continues to be broadcast online. On December 27, 2019, Transitions aired its 800th episode.

2008 saw Digweed and Sasha reuniting for a Spring Club Tour that once again featured performances all over North America. In 2011, Digweed&#x27;s music was featured in the film movie adaptation of Irvine Welsh&#x27;s best-selling novel
&quot;Irvine Welsh&#x27;s Ecstasy&quot;.

He featured among the top ten artists from 1998 to 2008 and was voted DJ Mag&#x27;s number 1 DJ in 2001. In 2010, he was voted number 29 in DJ Mag&#x27;s annual Top 100 DJs vote. In 2013, Digweed was ranked the number 17 best DJ in the world in Resident Advisor&#x27;s top 100 DJ charts; he currently is number 43 as of June 2016.

John is the brother of 28 times World Clay Shooting Champion George Digweed, MBE.

<text>Jacob, later given the name Israel, is a patriarch regarded as the forefather of the Israelites, according to Abrahamic religions such as Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Jacob first appears in the Book of Genesis, originating from the Hebrew tradition in the Torah. Described as the son of Isaac and Rebecca, and the grandson of Abraham, Sarah, and Bethuel, Jacob is presented as the second-born among Isaac&#x27;s children. His fraternal twin brother is the elder, named Esau, according to the biblical account. Jacob is said to have bought Esau&#x27;s birthright and, with his mother&#x27;s help, deceived his aging father to bless him instead of Esau. Later in the narrative, following a severe drought in his homeland of Canaan, Jacob and his descendants, with the help of his son Joseph (who had become a confidant of the pharaoh), moved to Egypt where Jacob died at the age of 147. He is supposed to have been buried in the Cave of Machpelah.

Jacob had twelve sons through four women: his wives (and cousins), Leah and Rachel, and his concubines, Bilhah and Zilpah. His sons were, in order of their birth: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, and Benjamin, all of whom became the heads of their own family groups, later known as the Twelve Tribes of Israel. He also had a daughter named Dinah. According to Genesis, Jacob displayed favoritism among his wives and children, preferring Rachel and her sons, Joseph and Benjamin, causing tension within the family—culminating in Joseph&#x27;s older brothers selling him into slavery.

Scholars have taken a mixed view as to Jacob&#x27;s historicity, with archaeology so far producing no evidence for his existence. William Albright initially dated the narratives of Jacob to the 19th century BCE, but later scholars like John J. Bimson and Nahum Sarna argued against using archaeological evidence to support such claims due to limited knowledge of that period. Recent scholars such as Thomas L. Thompson and William Dever suggest that these narratives are late literary compositions with ideological purposes rather than historical accounts.

==Etymology==
According to the folk etymology found in Genesis 25:26, the name is derived from &quot;heel&quot;, as Jacob was born grasping the heel of his twin brother Esau. The historical origin of the name is uncertain, although similar names have been recorded. is recorded as a place name in a list by Thutmose III (15th century BC), and later as the &quot;nomen&quot; of a Hyksos pharaoh. The hieroglyphs are ambiguous, and can be read as &quot;Yaqub-Har&quot;, &quot;Yaqubaal&quot;, or &quot;Yaqub El&quot;. The same name is recorded earlier still, in , in cuneiform inscriptions (spelled &quot;ya-ah-qu-ub-el&quot;, &quot;ya-qu-ub-el&quot;). The suggestion that the personal name may be shortened from this compound name, which would translate to &quot;may El protect&quot;, originates with Bright (1960). In the Amorite language, parallel forms of Jacob&#x27;s name are attested as &quot;ia-aḫ-qú-ub-DINGIR&quot; and &quot;ia-aḫ-qú-bu-um&quot;.

The name &quot;Israel&quot; given to Jacob following the episode of his wrestling with the angel (Genesis 32:22–32) is etymologized as composition of &quot;el&quot; &quot;god&quot; and the root &quot;śarah&quot; &quot;to rule, contend, have power, prevail over&quot;:  (KJV: &quot;a prince hast thou power with God&quot;); alternatively, the &quot;el&quot; can be read as the subject, for a translation of &quot;El rules/contends/struggles&quot;. The word &quot;strive&quot; is often used for the proposed etymon שרה, but as Genesis novelly uses the word without defining it, this interpretation is merely based upon the context in the story.

===Greek===
The Septuagint renders the name &quot;Iákobos&quot; (), whence Latin , English &quot;Jacob&quot;.

==Genesis narrative==

The biblical account of the life of Jacob is found in the Book of Genesis, chapters 25–50.

===Birth===
Jacob and his twin brother, Esau, were born to Isaac and Rebecca after 20 years of marriage, when Isaac was 60 years of age. Rebecca was uncomfortable during her pregnancy and went to inquire of God why she was suffering. She received the prophecy that twins were fighting in her womb and would continue to fight all their lives, even after they became two separate nations. The prophecy also said that &quot;the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger&quot; (Genesis 25:25 KJV).

When the time came for Rebecca to give birth, the firstborn, Esau, came out covered with red hair, as if he were wearing a hairy garment, and his heel was grasped by the hand of Jacob, the secondborn. According to Genesis 25, Isaac and Rebecca named the first son Esau (). The second son they named Jacob (Hebrew: יעקב, Ya&#x27;aqob or Ya&#x27;aqov, meaning &quot;heel-catcher&quot;, &quot;supplanter&quot;, &quot;leg-puller&quot;, &quot;he who follows upon the heels of one&quot;, from , &quot;″aqab&quot; or &quot;″aqav&quot;, &quot;seize by the heel&quot;, &quot;circumvent&quot;, &quot;restrain&quot;, a wordplay upon , &quot;″iqqebah&quot; or &quot;″iqqbah&quot;, &quot;heel&quot;).

The boys displayed very different natures as they matured: &quot;... and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; but Jacob was a simple man, dwelling in tents&quot;. Moreover, the attitudes of their parents toward them also differed: &quot;And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebecca loved Jacob.&quot;

===Acquiring birthright===
Genesis 25:29–34 tells the account of Esau selling his birthright to Jacob. This passage tells that Esau, returning famished from the fields, begged Jacob to give him some of the stew that Jacob had just made. (Esau referred to the dish as &quot;that same red pottage&quot;, giving rise to his nickname, (&quot;&#x27;Edom&quot;, meaning &quot;Red&quot;).) Jacob offered to give Esau a bowl of stew in exchange for his birthright, to which Esau agreed.

===Blessing of Isaac===
As Isaac aged, he became blind and was uncertain when he would die, so he decided to bestow Esau&#x27;s birthright upon him. He requested that Esau go out to the fields with his weapons (quiver and bow) to kill some venison. Isaac then requested that Esau make &quot;savory meat&quot; for him out of the venison, according to the way he enjoyed it the most, so that he could eat it and bless Esau.

Rebecca overheard this conversation. It is suggested that she realized prophetically that Isaac&#x27;s blessings would go to Jacob, since she was told before the twins&#x27; birth that the older son would serve the younger. Rebecca blessed Jacob and she quickly ordered Jacob to bring her two kid goats from their flock so that he could take Esau&#x27;s place in serving Isaac and receiving his blessing. Jacob protested that his father would recognize their deception since Esau was hairy and he himself was smooth-skinned. He feared his father would curse him as soon as he felt him, but Rebecca offered to take the curse herself, then insisted that Jacob obey her. Jacob did as his mother instructed and, when he returned with the kids, Rebecca made the savory meat that Isaac loved. Before she sent Jacob to his father, she dressed him in Esau&#x27;s garments and laid goatskins on his arms and neck to simulate hairy skin.

Disguised as Esau, Jacob entered Isaac&#x27;s room. Surprised that Esau was back so soon, Isaac asked how it could be that the hunt went so quickly. Jacob responded, &quot;Because the LORD your God brought it to me.&quot; Rashi says Isaac&#x27;s suspicions were aroused even more, because Esau never used the personal name of God. Isaac demanded that Jacob come close so he could feel him, but the goatskins felt just like Esau&#x27;s hairy skin. Confused, Isaac exclaimed, &quot;The voice is Jacob&#x27;s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau!&quot; Still trying to get at the truth, Isaac asked him directly, &quot;Art thou my very son Esau?&quot; and Jacob answered simply, &quot;I am.&quot; Isaac proceeded to eat the food and to drink the wine that Jacob gave him, and then told him to come close and kiss him. As Jacob kissed his father, Isaac smelled the clothes which belonged to Esau and finally accepted that the person in front of him was Esau. Isaac then blessed Jacob with the blessing that was meant for Esau. Genesis 27:28–29 states Isaac&#x27;s blessing: &quot;Therefore God give thee of the dew of heavens, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine: Let people serve thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother&#x27;s sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.&quot;

Jacob had scarcely left the room when Esau returned from the hunt to prepare his game and receive the blessing. The realization that he had been deceived shocked Isaac, yet he acknowledged that Jacob had received the blessings by adding, &quot;Indeed, he will be [or remain] blessed!&quot; (27:33).

Esau was heartbroken by the deception and begged for his own blessing. Having made Jacob a ruler over his brothers, Isaac could only promise, &quot;By your sword you shall live, but your brother you shall serve; yet it shall be that when you are aggrieved, you may cast off his yoke from upon your neck&quot; (27:39–40).

Although Esau sold Jacob his own birthright, which was his blessing, for &quot;red pottage,&quot; Esau still hated Jacob for receiving his blessing that their father Isaac unknowingly had given to him. He vowed to kill Jacob as soon as Isaac died. When Rebecca heard about his murderous intentions, she ordered Jacob to travel to her brother Laban&#x27;s house in Haran, until Esau&#x27;s anger subsided. She convinced Isaac to send Jacob away by telling him that she despaired of his marrying a local girl from the idol-worshipping families of Canaan (as Esau had done). After Isaac sent Jacob away to find a wife, Esau realized his own Canaanite wives were evil in his father&#x27;s eyes and so he took a daughter of Isaac&#x27;s half-brother, Ishmael, as another wife.

===Jacob&#x27;s ladder===
Near Luz en route to Haran, Jacob experienced a vision of a ladder, or staircase, reaching into heaven with angels going up and down it, subsequently referred to in popular culture as &quot;Jacob&#x27;s ladder.&quot; He heard the voice of God, who repeated many of the blessings upon him, coming from the top of the ladder.

According to Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer, the ladder signified the exiles that the Jewish people would suffer before the coming of the Jewish Messiah: the angels that represented the exiles of Babylonia, Persia, and Greece each climbed up a certain number of steps, paralleling the years of the exile, before they &quot;fell down&quot;; but the angel representing the last exile, that of Edom, kept climbing higher and higher into the clouds. Jacob feared that his descendants would never be free of Esau&#x27;s domination, but God assured him that at the End of Days, Edom too would come falling down.

In the morning, Jacob awakened and continued on his way to Haran, after naming the place where he had spent the night &quot;Bethel&quot;, &quot;God&#x27;s house.&quot;

===Marriages===

Arriving in Haran, Jacob saw a well where shepherds were gathering their flocks to water them and met Laban&#x27;s younger daughter, Rachel, Jacob&#x27;s first cousin; she was working as a shepherdess. Jacob was 77 years old, and he loved Rachel immediately. After spending a month with his relatives he asked for her hand in marriage in return for working seven years for Laban the Aramean. Laban agreed to the arrangement. These seven years seemed to Jacob &quot;but a few days, for the love he had for her.&quot; When they were complete and he was 84 years old he asked for his wife, but Laban deceived him by switching Rachel for her older sister, Leah, as the veiled bride. In the morning, when the truth became known, Laban justified his action, saying that in his country it was unheard of to give a younger daughter before the older. However, he agreed to give Rachel in marriage as well if Jacob would work another seven years. After the week of wedding celebrations with Leah, Jacob married Rachel, and he continued to work for Laban for another seven years.

In those seven years, Jacob fathered twelve children. He loved Rachel more than Leah, and Leah felt hated. God opened Leah&#x27;s womb and she gave birth to four sons rapidly: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah. Rachel, however, remained barren. Following the example of Sarah, who gave her handmaid to Abraham after years of infertility, Rachel gave her handmaid Bilhah to Jacob so that Rachel could raise children through her. Bilhah gave birth to Dan and Naphtali. Seeing that she had left off childbearing temporarily, Leah then gave her handmaid Zilpah to Jacob so that Leah could raise more children through her. Zilpah gave birth to Gad and Asher. Afterwards, Leah became fertile again and gave birth to Issachar, Zebulun, and Dinah, Jacob&#x27;s only daughter. God remembered Rachel, who gave birth to Joseph, and later, Benjamin.

After Joseph was born, Jacob decided to return home to his parents. Laban the Aramean was reluctant to release him, as God had blessed his flock on account of Jacob. Laban asked what he could pay Jacob. Jacob suggested that all the spotted, speckled, and brown goats and sheep of Laban&#x27;s flock, at any given moment, would be his wages. Jacob placed rods of poplar, hazel, and chestnut, all of which he peeled &quot;white streaks upon them,&quot; within the flocks&#x27; watering holes or troughs, associating the stripes of the rods with the growth of stripes on the livestock. Despite this practicing of magic, later on Jacob says to his wives that it was God who made the livestock give birth to the convenient offspring, in order to turn the tide against the deceptive Laban. As time passed, Laban&#x27;s sons noticed that Jacob was taking the better part of their flocks, and so Laban&#x27;s friendly attitude towards Jacob began to change. The angel of the Lord, in a dream back during the breeding season, told Jacob &quot;Now lift your eyes and see [that] all the he goats mounting the animals are ringed, speckled, and striped, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you&quot;, that he is the God whom Jacob met at Bethel, and that Jacob should leave and go back to the land where he was born, which he and his wives and children did without informing Laban. Before they left, Rachel stole the &quot;teraphim,&quot; considered to be household idols, from Laban&#x27;s house.

Laban pursued Jacob for seven days. The night before he caught up to him, God appeared to Laban in a dream and warned him not to say anything good or bad to Jacob. When the two met, Laban said to Jacob, &quot;What have you done, that you have tricked me and driven away my daughters like captives of the sword?&quot; He also asked for his stolen &quot;teraphim&quot; back. Knowing nothing about Rachel&#x27;s theft, Jacob told Laban that whoever stole them should die and stood aside to let him search. When Laban reached Rachel&#x27;s tent, she hid the &quot;teraphim&quot; by sitting on them and stating she could not get up because she was menstruating. Jacob and Laban then parted from each other with a pact to preserve the peace between them near Gilead. Laban returned to his home and Jacob continued on his way.

===Journey back to Canaan===
As Jacob neared the land of Canaan as he passed Mahanaim, he sent messengers ahead to his brother Esau. They returned with the news that Esau was coming to meet Jacob with an army of 400 men. With great apprehension, Jacob prepared for the worst. He engaged in earnest prayer to God, then sent on before him a tribute of flocks and herds to Esau, &quot;A present to my lord Esau from thy servant Jacob.&quot;

Jacob then transported his family and flocks across the ford Jabbok by night, then recrossed back to send over his possessions, being left alone in communion with God. There, a mysterious being appeared (&quot;man,&quot; Genesis 32:24, 28; or &quot;God,&quot; Genesis 32:28, 30, Hosea 12:3, 5; or &quot;angel,&quot; Hosea 12:4), and the two wrestled until daybreak. When the being saw that he did not overpower Jacob, he touched Jacob on the sinew of his thigh (the &quot;gid hanasheh&quot;, גיד הנשה), and, as a result, Jacob developed a limp (Genesis 32:31). Because of this, &quot;to this day the people of Israel do not eat the sinew of the thigh that is on the hip socket&quot; This incident is the source of the mitzvah of porging.

Jacob then demanded a blessing, and the being declared in Genesis 32:28 that, from then on, Jacob would be called יִשְׂרָאֵל, Israel (&quot;Yisra&#x27;el&quot;, meaning &quot;one that struggled with the divine angel&quot; (Josephus), &quot;one who has prevailed with God&quot; (Rashi), &quot;a man seeing God&quot; (Whiston), &quot;he will rule as God&quot; (Strong), or &quot;a prince with God&quot; (Morris), from , &quot;prevail,&quot; &quot;have power as a prince&quot;). While he is still called Jacob in later texts, his name Israel makes some consider him the eponymous ancestor of the Israelites.

Jacob asked the being&#x27;s name, but he refused to answer. Afterwards, Jacob named the place Penuel (&quot;Penuw&#x27;el&quot;, &quot;Peniy&#x27;el&quot;, meaning &quot;face of God&quot;), saying: &quot;I have seen God face to face and lived.&quot;

Because the terminology is ambiguous (&quot;el&quot; in &quot;Yisra&#x27;el&quot;) and inconsistent, and because this being refused to reveal his name, there are varying views as to whether he was a man, an angel, or God. Josephus uses only the terms &quot;angel&quot;, &quot;divine angel,&quot; and &quot;angel of God,&quot; describing the struggle as no small victory. According to Rashi, the being was the guardian angel of Esau himself, sent to destroy Jacob before he could return to the land of Canaan. Trachtenberg theorized that the being refused to identify itself for fear that, if its secret name was known, it would be conjurable by incantations. Literal Christian interpreters like Henry M. Morris say that the stranger was &quot;God Himself and, therefore, Christ in His preincarnate state&quot;, citing Jacob&#x27;s own evaluation and the name he assumed thereafter, &quot;one who fights victoriously with God&quot;, and adding that God had appeared in the human form of the Angel of the Lord to eat a meal with Abraham in Genesis 18. Geller wrote that, &quot;in the context of the wrestling bout, the name implies that Jacob won this supremacy, linked to that of God&#x27;s, by a kind of theomachy.&quot;

In the morning, Jacob assembled his four wives and 11 sons, placing the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear. Some commentators cite this placement as proof that Jacob continued to favor Joseph over Leah&#x27;s children, as presumably the rear position would have been safer from a frontal assault by Esau, which Jacob feared. Jacob himself took the foremost position. Esau&#x27;s spirit of revenge, however, was apparently appeased by Jacob&#x27;s bounteous gifts of camels, goats and flocks. Their reunion was an emotional one.
Esau offered to accompany them on their way back to Israel, but Jacob protested that his children were still young and tender (born six to 13 years prior in the narrative); Jacob suggested eventually catching up with Esau at Mount Seir. According to the Sages, this was a prophetic reference to the End of Days, when Jacob&#x27;s descendants will come to Mount Seir, the home of Edom, to deliver judgment against Esau&#x27;s descendants for persecuting them throughout the millennia. Jacob actually diverted himself to Succoth and was not recorded as rejoining Esau until, at Machpelah, the two bury their father Isaac, who lived to be 180, and was 60 years older than they were.

Jacob then arrived in Shechem, where he bought a parcel of land, now identified as Joseph&#x27;s Tomb. In Shechem, Jacob&#x27;s daughter Dinah was kidnapped and raped by the ruler&#x27;s son, who desired to marry the girl. Dinah&#x27;s brothers, Simeon and Levi, agreed in Jacob&#x27;s name to permit the marriage as long as all the men of Shechem first circumcised themselves, ostensibly to unite the children of Jacob in Abraham&#x27;s covenant of familial harmony. On the third day after the circumcisions, when all the men of Shechem were still in pain, Simeon and Levi put them all to death by the sword and rescued their sister Dinah, and their brothers plundered the property, women, and children. Jacob condemned this act, saying: &quot;You have brought trouble on me by making me a stench to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people living in this land.&quot; He later rebuked his two sons for their anger in his deathbed blessing (Genesis 49:5–7).

Jacob returned to Bethel, where he had another vision of blessing. Although the death of Rebecca, Jacob&#x27;s mother, is not explicitly recorded in the Bible, Deborah, Rebecca&#x27;s nurse, died and was buried at Bethel, at a place that Jacob calls &quot;Allon Bachuth&quot; (אלון בכות), &quot;Oak of Weepings&quot; (Genesis 35:8). According to the Midrash, the plural form of the word &quot;weeping&quot; indicates the double sorrow that Rebecca also died at this time.
Jacob then made a further move while Rachel was pregnant; near Bethlehem, Rachel went into labor and died as she gave birth to her second son, Benjamin (Jacob&#x27;s twelfth son). Jacob buried her and erected a monument over her grave. Rachel&#x27;s Tomb, just outside Bethlehem, remains a popular site for pilgrimages and prayers to this day. Jacob then settled in Migdal Eder, where his firstborn, Reuben, slept with Rachel&#x27;s servant Bilhah; Jacob&#x27;s response was not given at the time, but he did condemn Reuben for it later, in his deathbed blessing. Jacob was finally reunited with his father Isaac in Mamre (outside Hebron).

When Isaac died at the age of 180, Jacob and Esau buried him in the Cave of the Patriarchs, which Abraham had purchased as a family burial plot. At this point in the biblical narrative, two genealogies of Esau&#x27;s family appear under the headings &quot;the generations of Esau&quot;. A conservative interpretation is that, at Isaac&#x27;s burial, Jacob obtained the records of Esau, who had been married 80 years prior, and incorporated them into his own family records, and that Moses augmented and published them.

===In Hebron===
The house of Jacob dwelt in Hebron, in the land of Canaan. His flocks were often fed in the pastures of Shechem as well as Dothan. Of all the children in his household, he loved Rachel&#x27;s firstborn son, Joseph, the most. Thus Joseph&#x27;s half brothers were jealous of him and they ridiculed him often. Joseph even told his father about all of his half brothers&#x27; misdeeds. When Joseph was 17 years old, Jacob made a long coat or tunic of many colors for him. Seeing this, the half brothers began to hate Joseph. Then Joseph began to have dreams that implied that his family would bow down to him. When he told his brothers about such dreams, it drove them to conspire against him. When Jacob heard of these dreams, he rebuked his son for proposing the idea that the house of Jacob would even bow down to Joseph. Yet, he contemplated his son&#x27;s words about these dreams.
Sometime afterward, the sons of Jacob by Leah, Bilhah and Zilpah, were feeding his flocks in Shechem. Jacob wanted to know how things were doing, so he asked Joseph to go down there and return with a report. This was the last time he would ever see his son in Hebron. Later that day, the report that Jacob ended up receiving came from Joseph&#x27;s brothers who brought before him a coat laden with blood from a goat. Jacob identified the coat as the one he made for Joseph. At that moment he cried, &quot;It is my son&#x27;s tunic. A wild beast has devoured him. Without doubt Joseph is torn to pieces.&quot; He tore his clothes and put sackcloth around his waist mourning for days. No one from the house of Jacob could comfort him during this time of bereavement.

The truth was that Joseph&#x27;s older brothers had turned on him, apprehended him and ultimately sold him into slavery on a caravan headed for Egypt.

===Seven-year famine===

Twenty years later, throughout the Middle East a severe famine occurred like none other that lasted seven years. It crippled nations. The word was that the only kingdom prospering was Egypt. In the second year of this great famine, when Israel (Jacob) was about 130 years old, he told his 10 sons of Leah, Bilhah and Zilpah, to go to Egypt and buy grain. Israel&#x27;s youngest son Benjamin, born from Rachel, stayed behind by his father&#x27;s order to keep him safe.

Nine of the sons returned to their father Israel from Egypt, stockpiled with grain on their donkeys. They relayed to their father all that had happened in Egypt. They spoke of being accused as spies and that their brother Simeon had been taken prisoner. When Reuben, the eldest, mentioned that they needed to bring Benjamin to Egypt to prove their word as honest men, their father became furious with them. He couldn&#x27;t understand how they were put in a position to tell the Egyptians all about their family. When the sons of Israel opened their sacks, they saw their money that they used to pay for the grain. It was still in their possession, and so they all became afraid. Israel then became angry with the loss of Joseph, Simeon, and now possibly Benjamin.

It turned out that Joseph, who identified his brothers in Egypt, was able to secretly return the money that they used to pay for the grain, back to them. When the house of Israel consumed all the grain that they brought from Egypt, Israel told his sons to go back and buy more. This time, Judah spoke to his father in order to persuade him about having Benjamin accompany them, so as to prevent Egyptian retribution. In hopes of retrieving Simeon and ensuring Benjamin&#x27;s return, Israel told them to bring the best fruits of their land, including: balm, honey, spices, myrrh, pistachio nuts and almonds. Israel also mentioned that the money that was returned to their money sacks was probably a mistake or an oversight on their part. So, he told them to bring that money back and use double that amount to pay for the new grain. Lastly, he let Benjamin go with them and said &quot;may God Almighty give you mercy... If I am bereaved, I am bereaved!&quot;

===In Egypt===
When the sons of Israel (Jacob) returned to Hebron from their second trip, they came back with 20 additional donkeys carrying all kinds of goods and supplies as well as Egyptian transport wagons. When their father came out to meet them, his sons told him that Joseph was still alive, that he was the governor over all of Egypt and that he wanted the house of Israel to move to Egypt. Israel&#x27;s heart &quot;stood still&quot; and just couldn&#x27;t believe what he was hearing. Looking upon the wagons he declared &quot;Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.&quot;
Israel and his entire house of 70, gathered up with all their livestock and began their journey to Egypt. En route, Israel stopped at Beersheba for the night to make a sacrificial offering to his God, Yahweh. Apparently he had some reservations about leaving the land of his forefathers, but God reassured him not to fear that he would rise again. God also assured that he would be with him, he would prosper, and he would also see his son Joseph who would lay him to rest. Continuing their journey to Egypt, when they approached in proximity, Israel sent his son Judah ahead to find out where the caravans were to stop. They were directed to disembark at Goshen. It was here, after 22 years, that Jacob saw his son Joseph once again. They embraced each other and wept together for quite a while. Israel then said, &quot;Now let me die, since I have seen your face, because you are still alive.&quot;

The time had come for Joseph&#x27;s family to personally meet the Pharaoh of Egypt. After Joseph prepared his family for the meeting, the brothers came before the Pharaoh first, formally requesting to pasture in Egyptian lands. The Pharaoh honored their stay and even made the notion that if there were any competent men in their house, then they may elect a chief herdsman to oversee Egyptian livestock. Finally, Joseph&#x27;s father was brought out to meet the Pharaoh. Because the Pharaoh had such a high regard for Joseph, practically making him his equal, it was an honor to meet his father. Thus, Israel was able to bless the Pharaoh. The two chatted for a bit, the Pharaoh even inquiring of Israel&#x27;s age which happened to be 130 years old at that time. After the meeting, the families were directed to pasture in the land of Ramses where they lived in the province of Goshen. The house of Israel acquired many possessions and multiplied exceedingly during the course of 17 years, even through the worst of the seven-year famine.

=== Final days ===

Israel (Jacob) was 147 years old when he called to his favorite son Joseph and pleaded that he not be buried in Egypt. Rather, he requested to be carried to the land of Canaan to be buried with his forefathers. Joseph swore to do as his father asked of him. Not too long afterward, Israel had fallen ill, losing much of his vision. When Joseph came to visit his father, he brought with him his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. Israel declared that they would be heirs to the inheritance of the house of Israel, as if they were his own children, just as Reuben and Simeon were. Then Israel laid his right hand on the younger Ephraim&#x27;s head and his left hand on the eldest Manasseh&#x27;s head and blessed Joseph. However, Joseph was displeased that his father&#x27;s right hand was not on the head of his firstborn, so he switched his father&#x27;s hands. But Israel refused saying, &quot;but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he.&quot; A declaration he made, just as Israel himself was to his firstborn brother Esau. Then Israel called all of his sons in and prophesied their blessings or curses to all twelve of them in order of their ages.

Afterward, Israel died and the family, including the Egyptians, mourned him 70 days. Israel was embalmed for 40 days and a great ceremonial journey to Canaan was prepared by Joseph. He led the servants of Pharaoh, and the elders of the houses Israel and Egypt beyond the Jordan River to Atad where they observed seven days of mourning. Their lamentation was so great that it caught the attention of surrounding Canaanites who remarked &quot;This is a deep mourning of the Egyptians.&quot; This spot was then named Abel Mizraim. Then they buried him in the cave of Machpelah, the property of Abraham when he bought it from the Hittite Ephron.

===Children of Jacob===

Jacob, through his two wives and his two concubines had 12 biological sons; Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan, Naphtali,
Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph and Benjamin. The scene of Jacob mourning Joseph makes mention of him having a number of daughters, but no details are provided. Only one daughter, Dinah, is known by name. In addition, Jacob also adopted the two sons of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim.

The offspring of Jacob&#x27;s sons became the tribes of Israel following the Exodus, when the Israelites conquered and settled in the Land of Israel.

==Religious perspectives==
===Judaism===
There are two opinions in the Midrash as to how old Rebecca was at the time of her marriage and, consequently, at the twins&#x27; birth. According to the traditional counting cited by Rashi, Isaac was 37 years old at the time of the Binding of Isaac, and news of Rebecca&#x27;s birth reached Abraham immediately after that event. In that case, since Isaac was 60 when Jacob and Esau were born and they had been married for 20 years, then Isaac was 40 years old when he married Rebecca (Gen. 25:20), making Rebecca three years old at the time of her marriage, and 23 years old at the birth of Jacob and Esau. According to the second opinion, Rebecca was 14 years old at the time of their marriage, and 34 years old at the birth of Jacob and Esau. In either case, Isaac and Rebecca were married for 20 years before Jacob and Esau were born. The Midrash says that during Rebecca&#x27;s pregnancy whenever she would pass a house of Torah study, Jacob would struggle to come out; whenever she would pass a house of idolatry, Esau would agitate to come out.

Rashi explained that Isaac, when blessing Jacob instead of Esau, smelled the heavenly scent of Gan Eden (Paradise) when Jacob entered his room and, in contrast, perceived Gehenna opening beneath Esau when the latter entered the room, showing him that he had been deceived all along by Esau&#x27;s show of piety.

According to the Talmud, Jacob did not flee directly to Haran (as would seem from the Biblical text), but rather studied for 14 years at the study house of Shem and Eber before continuing towards Haran.

When Laban planned to deceive Jacob into marrying Leah instead of Rachel, the Midrash recounts that both Jacob and Rachel suspected that Laban would pull such a trick; Laban was known as the &quot;Aramean&quot; (deceiver), and changed Jacob&#x27;s wages ten times during his employ (Genesis 31:7). The couple therefore devised a series of signs by which Jacob could identify the veiled bride on his wedding night. But when Rachel saw her sister being taken out to the wedding canopy, her heart went out to her for the public shame Leah would suffer if she were exposed. Rachel therefore gave Leah the signs so that Jacob would not realize the switch.

Jacob had still another reason for grieving the loss of Joseph. God had promised to him: &quot;If none of your sons dies during your lifetime, you may look upon it as a token that you will not be put in (Hell of) Gehenna after your death.&quot; Thinking Joseph to be dead, Jacob had his own destiny to lament because he considered that he was doomed to that Hell.

Jewish apocalyptic literature of the Hellenistic period includes many ancient texts with narratives about Jacob, many times with details different from Genesis. The more important are the Book of Jubilees and the Book of Biblical Antiquities. Jacob is also the protagonist of the Testament of Jacob, of the Ladder of Jacob and of the Prayer of Joseph, which interpret the experience of this Patriarch in the context of merkabah mysticism.

===Christianity===
The Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite see Jacob&#x27;s dream as a prophecy of the incarnation of the Logos, whereby Jacob&#x27;s ladder is understood as a symbol of the Theotokos (Virgin Mary), who, according to Eastern Orthodox theology, united heaven and earth in her womb. The biblical account of this vision is one of the standard Old Testament readings at Vespers on Great Feasts of the Theotokos.

The Eastern and Western Churches consider Jacob as a saint along with other biblical patriarchs. Along with other patriarchs his feast day is celebrated in the Byzantine rite on the Second Sunday before the Advent (December 11–17), under the title &quot;the Sunday of the Forefathers&quot;.

===Islam===
Two further references to Isra&#x27;il (Arabic: إِسْرَآئِیل [&quot;ˈisraāˈiyl&quot;]; Classical/ Quranic Arabic: إِسْرَآءِیْل [&quot;ˈisraāãˈiyl&quot;]) are believed to be mention of Jacob. The Arabic form Ya&#x27;qūb () may be direct from the Hebrew or indirect through Syriac.

He is recognized in Islam as a prophet who received inspiration from God. He is acknowledged as a patriarch of Islam. Muslims believe that he preached the same monotheistic faith as his forefathers ʾIbrāhīm, ʾIsḥāq and Ismā&#x27;īl. Jacob is mentioned 16 times in the Quran. In the majority of these references, Jacob is mentioned alongside fellow prophets and patriarchs as an ancient and pious prophet. According to the Quran, Jacob remained in the company of the elect throughout his life. (38:47) The Quran specifically mentions that Jacob was guided (6:84) and inspired (4:163) and was chosen to enforce the awareness of the Hereafter. (38:46) Jacob is described as a good-doer (21:72) and the Quran further makes it clear that God inspired Jacob to contribute towards purification and hold the contact prayer. (21:73) Jacob is further described as being resourceful and a possessor of great vision (38:45) and is further spoken of as being granted a &quot;tongue [voice] of truthfulness to be heard.&quot; (19:50)

Of the life of Jacob, the Quran narrates two especially important events. The first is the role he plays in the story of his son Joseph. The Quran narrates the story of Joseph in detail, and Jacob, being Joseph&#x27;s father, is mentioned thrice and is referenced another 25 times. In the narrative, Jacob does not trust some of his older sons (12: 11, 18, 23) because they do not respect him. (12: 8, 16–17) Jacob&#x27;s prophetic nature is evident from his foreknowledge of Joseph&#x27;s future greatness (12:6), his foreboding and response to the supposed death of Joseph (12: 13, 18) and in his response to the sons&#x27; plight in Egypt. (12: 83, 86–87, 96) Islamic literature fleshes out the narrative of Jacob, and mentions that his wives included Rachel. Jacob is later mentioned in the Quran in the context of the promise bestowed to Zechariah, regarding the birth of John the Baptist. (19:6) Jacob&#x27;s second mention is in the Quran&#x27;s second chapter. As Jacob lay on his deathbed, he asked his 12 sons to testify their faith to him before he departed from this world to the next. (2:132) Each son testified in front of Jacob that they would promise to remain Muslim (in submission to God) until the day of their death; that is they would surrender their wholeselves to God alone and would worship only Him.

In contrast to the Judeo-Christian view of Jacob, one main difference is that the story of Jacob&#x27;s blessing, in which he deceives Isaac, is not accepted in Islam. The Quran makes it clear that Jacob was blessed by God as a prophet and, therefore, Muslims believe that his father, being a prophet as well, also knew of his son&#x27;s greatness. Jacob is also cited in the &quot;Hadith&quot; as an example of one who was patient and trusting in God in the face of suffering.

====Nation of Islam====

According to the teachings of the Nation of Islam (NOI), the original inhabitants of the world were black (referred to as the &quot;Asiatic Blackman&quot;), while the white race are &quot;devils&quot; who were created 6,000 years ago on what is today the Greek island of Patmos by the biblical and quranic Jacob, whom the group refers to as the &quot;bigheaded scientist&quot; Yakub. Though rejected by the vast majority of American Muslims, several NOI breakaway sects, including the Five-Percent Nation, subscribe to this narrative. The Nuwaubian Nation, an NOI offshoot headed by Malachi Z. York, promotes an alternative version of the Yakub story. In contrast to both the Bible and Qu’ran, the NOI and its offshoots teach that Yakub was born in Mecca.

==Historicity==

Although archaeologist and biblical scholar William F. Albright maintained (c. 1961) that the narratives of Abraham and Jacob could be dated to about the 19th century BCE, John J. Bimson wrote in 1980: &quot;Since then ... there has been a strong reaction against the use of archaeological evidence in support of the biblical traditions, and Albright&#x27;s comment could not be repeated with any truth today.&quot; Nahum M. Sarna (1978) noted that an inability to date the narratives of the patriarchs does not necessarily invalidate their historicity, a view supported by Bimson, who admitted that &quot;Our knowledge of the centuries around 2000 BCE is very small, and our ignorance very great.&quot;

Gerhard von Rad, in his &quot;Old Testament Theology&quot; (1962) postulated that the patriarchal narratives describe actual events subsequently interpreted by the community through its own experience.
Other scholars, such as Thomas L. Thompson, view the narratives as late literary compositions (6th and 5th centuries BCE) that have ideological and theological purposes but are unreliable for historical reconstruction of the pre-settlement period of the Israelites. In &quot;The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives&quot; (1974), Thompson suggested that the narratives arose in a response to some emergent situation, expressed as an imaginative picture of the past to embody hope.

In &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot; (1973), Jacob Bronowski pointed out similarities between Jacob and Bakhtyar, who lends his name to Iran&#x27;s Bakhtiari people. Both were herdsmen who had two wives, and are regarded as the ancestral patriarch of their nomadic people.

Archaeologist William G. Dever wrote in 2001: &quot;After a century of exhaustive investigation, all respectable archaeologists have given up hope of recovering any context that would make Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob &#x27;historical figures.&#x27;&quot;
Excavations in the Timna Valley produced what may be the earliest camel bones found in Israel or even outside the Arabian Peninsula, dating to around 930 BCE. This is seen by some as evidence that the stories of Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph (said to have taken place a thousand years earlier) were written no earlier than the 10th century BCE.

Israel Finkelstein proposed the Jacob-Esau narratives could have originated from 8th century BCE Kingdom of Israel because the conflict with Edom fits well not only in a Judahite context but also in 8th century BCE Israelite context. Other scholars have suggested that the story could fit also in a 2nd millennium BCE context. Finkelstein suggests there is an archaeological evidence that 8th century Israel interacted with Edom: the graffiti of Kuntillet Ajrud that mention both a &quot;YHWH of Samaria&quot; (center of Israel) and a &quot;YHWH of Teman&quot; (center of Edom). He proposed the Jacob-Laban narrative might stem from the 8th century BCE as Haran was then the western capital of the Assyrian empire. He also proposed that the earliest layer of Jacob cycle or the oldest Jacob tradition, which is the story of him and his uncle Laban establishing the border between them, might be a pre-monarchic tradition and could be originated from Gilead.

<text>Jehoshaphat (; alternatively spelled Jehosaphat, Josaphat, or Yehoshafat; ; ; ), according to the Hebrew Bible, was the son of Asa, and the fourth king of the Kingdom of Judah, in succession to his father. His children included Jehoram, who succeeded him as king. His mother was Azubah. Historically, his name has sometimes been connected with the Valley of Josaphat.

== Reign ==

2 Chronicles chapters 17 to 21 are devoted to the reign of Jehoshaphat. First Kings treats him more briefly: 1 Kings 15:24 mentions him as successor to Asa, and 1 Kings 22:1–50 summarizes the events of his life. The Jerusalem Bible states that &quot;the Chronicler sees Asa as a type of the peaceful, Jehoshaphat of the strong king&quot;. According to these passages, Jehoshaphat ascended the throne at the age of thirty-five and reigned for twenty-five years. He &quot;walked in the ways&quot; of his father or ancestor, King David. He spent the first years of his reign fortifying his kingdom against the Kingdom of Israel. His zeal in suppressing the idolatrous worship of the &quot;high places&quot; is commended in 2 Chronicles 17:6.

In the third year of his reign, Jehoshaphat sent out priests and Levites over the land to instruct the people in the Law, an activity which was commanded for a Sabbatical year in Deuteronomy 31:10–13 (taking place in Jerusalem). Later reforms in Judah instituted by Jehoshaphat appear to have included further religious reforms, appointment of judges throughout the cities of Judah and a form of &quot;court of appeal&quot; in Jerusalem. Ecclesiastical and secular jurisdictions, according to 2 Chronicles 19:11, were by royal command kept distinct.

The author of the Books of Chronicles generally praises his reign, stating that the kingdom enjoyed a great measure of peace and prosperity, the blessing of God resting on the people &quot;in their basket and their store&quot;.

== Alliances ==
Jehoshaphat also pursued alliances with the kingdom of Israel in the North. Jehoshaphat&#x27;s son Jehoram married Athaliah, daughter of king Ahab of Israel. In the eighteenth year of his reign Jehosaphat visited Ahab in Samaria, and nearly lost his life accompanying his ally to the siege of Ramoth-Gilead. While Jehoshaphat safely returned from this battle, he was reproached by the prophet Jehu, son of Hanani, about this alliance. We are told that Jehoshaphat repented, and returned to his former course of opposition to all idolatry, and promoting the worship of God and in the government of his people.

Later it appears that Jehoshaphat entered into an alliance with Ahaziah of Israel, for the purpose of carrying on maritime commerce with Ophir. He subsequently joined Jehoram of Israel in a war against the Moabites, who were under tribute to Israel. The Moabites were subdued, but seeing Mesha&#x27;s act of offering his own son (and singular heir) as a propitiatory human sacrifice on the walls of Kir of Moab filled Israel with horror, and they withdrew and returned to their own land.

==Victory over Moabite alliance==
According to &quot;Chronicles&quot;, the Moabites formed a great and powerful confederacy with the surrounding nations, and marched against Jehoshaphat. The allied forces were encamped at Ein Gedi. The king and his people were filled with alarm. The king prayed in the court of the Temple, &quot;O our God, will you not judge them? For we have no power to face this vast army that is attacking us. We do not know what to do; but our eyes are upon you.&quot; The voice of Jahaziel the Levite was heard announcing that the next day all this great host would be overthrown. So it was, for they quarreled among themselves, and slew one another, leaving to the people of Judah only to gather the rich spoils of the slain. Soon after this victory Jehoshaphat died after a reign of twenty-five years at the age of sixty. According to some sources (such as the eleventh-century Jewish commentator Rashi), he actually died two years later, but gave up his throne earlier for unknown reasons. As with his father Asa, a bonfire was lit in his honor.

He also had the ambition to emulate Solomon&#x27;s maritime ventures to Ophir, and built a large vessel for Tarshish. But when this boat was wrecked at Ezion-Geber he relinquished the project.

In I Kings xxii. 43 the piety of Jehoshaphat is briefly dwelt on. Chronicles, in keeping with its tendency, elaborates this trait of the king&#x27;s character. According to its report, Jehoshaphat organized a missionary movement by sending out his officers, the priests, and the Levites to instruct the people throughout the land in the Law of YHWH, the king himself delivering sermons.

Underlying this ascription to the king of the purpose to carry out the Priestly Code, is the historical fact that Jehoshaphat took heed to organize the administration of justice on a solid foundation, and was an honest worshiper of YHWH. In connection with this the statement that Jehoshaphat expelled the &quot;Ḳedeshim&quot; (R. V. &quot;Sodomites&quot;) from the land (1 Kings 22:46) is characteristic; while 2 Chron. 19:3 credits him with having cut down the Asherot. The report that he took away the &quot;high places&quot; (and the Asherim) conflicts with 1 Kings 22:44 (A. V. v. 43) and 2 Chron. 20:33. The account of Jehoshaphat&#x27;s tremendous army (1,160,000 men) and the rich tribute received from (among others) the Philistines and the Arabs is not historical. It is in harmony with the theory worked out in Chronicles that pious monarchs have always been the mightiest and most prosperous.

==Rabbinic literature==
The question that puzzled Heinrich Ewald and others, &quot;Where was the brazen serpent till the time of Hezekiah?&quot; occupied the Talmudists also. They answered it in a very simple way: Asa and Joshaphat, when clearing away the idols, purposely left the brazen serpent behind, in order that Hezekiah might also be able to do a praiseworthy deed in breaking it.

==Chronological notes==
William F. Albright estimated the reign of Jehoshaphat to 873–849 BCE. Edwin R. Thiele held that he became coregent with his father Asa in Asa&#x27;s 39th year, 872/871 BCE, the year Asa was infected with a severe disease in his feet, and then became sole regent when Asa died of the disease in 870/869 BCE, his own death occurring in 848/847 BCE. So Jehoshaphat&#x27;s dates are taken as one year earlier: co-regency beginning in 873/871, sole reign commencing in 871/870, and death in 849/848 BCE.

The calendars for reckoning the years of kings in Judah and Israel were offset by six months, that of Judah starting in Tishri (in the fall) and that of Israel in Nisan (in the spring). Cross-synchronizations between the two kingdoms therefore often allow narrowing of the beginning and/or ending dates of a king to within a six-month range. For Jehoshaphat, the Scriptural data allow the narrowing of the beginning of his sole reign to some time between Tishri 1 of 871 BCE and the day before Nisan 1 of 870 BCE. For calculation purposes, this should be taken as the Judean year beginning in Tishri of 871/870 BCE. His death occurred at some time between Nisan 1 of 848 BCE and Tishri 1 of that same year.

==In popular culture==

The king&#x27;s name in the oath &quot;jumping Jehosaphat&quot; was likely popularized by the name&#x27;s utility as a euphemism for Jesus. The phrase, spelled &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Geehosofat&quot;, is first recorded in the 1865–1866 novel &quot;The Headless Horseman&quot; by the Irish-American novelist Thomas Mayne Reid. The novel also uses &quot;Geehosofat&quot;, standing alone, as an exclamation. The longer version &quot;By the shaking, jumping ghost of Jehosaphat&quot; is seen in the 1865 novel &quot;Paul Peabody&quot; by the English journalist Percy Bolingbroke St John.

Another theory is that the reference is to Joel 3:11–12, where the prophet Joel says, speaking of the judgment of the dead, &quot;Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O LORD. Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about.&quot;

In the 1956 Warner Brothers Merrie Melodies theatrical cartoon short, &quot;Yankee Dood It,&quot; based on the fairy tale of The Elves and the Shoemaker, Jehosephat figures prominently as an invocation to turn elves into mice. On the TV series &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot;, the character Francis Muldoon cited his partner&#x27;s frequent use of the phrase &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jehosephat!&quot; as a source of annoyance in the episode entitled &quot;Change Your Partners&quot;. The televised &quot;Batman&quot; live-action program of the 1960s also featured Robin, played by Burt Ward, uttering the phrase as an emphatic exclamation, and it was also incorporated into the talking alarm clock alarms voiced again by Burt Ward in 1974 in the &quot;talking Batman &amp; Robin alarm clock&quot; made by Janex.

&#x27;Jehoshaphat!&#x27; was the standard curse-word used by Elijah Baley, protagonist of the first three science-fiction novels of Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Robot&quot; series.

Another reference comes in Keno Don Rosa&#x27;s &quot;The Invader of Fort Duckburg&quot;, a Scrooge McDuck &quot;Life and Times&quot; story. Theodore &quot;Teddy&quot; Roosevelt exclaims &#x27;Great Jumping Jehoshaphat!!&#x27; when confronted with Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s illegal occupation of the fictitious Fort Duckburg, also in Disney&#x27;s 1963 animated film &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;, Merlin uses &quot;Jehoshaphat&quot; to express alarm and annoyance. Furthermore, in Disney&#x27;s 1977 animated film &quot;The Rescuers&quot;, Bernard exclaims &quot;Jehoshaphat!&quot; during the bayou chase scene.

Rapper MF Doom used the phrase &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jehosephat!&quot; in his song &quot;I Hear Voices&quot;, featured on the 2001 re-release of his 1999 debut album &quot;&quot;.

In &#x27;The Five Doctors&#x27; 20th Anniversary episode of BBC series &#x27;Doctor Who&#x27; (1983), Jon Pertwee (playing the Third Doctor) used Jehoshaphat as an exclamation when recognising Anthony Ainley&#x27;s Tremus incarnation of their enemy, The Master in the Gallifreyan &#x27;Death Zone&#x27;. Whilst The Third Doctor had used this exclamation as a truncation of &#x27;Jumping Jehoshaphat&#x27; on several occasions during his tenure, many younger and casual viewers mistakenly took &#x27;Jehoshaphat&#x27; to be The Master&#x27;s real name, used by The Doctor because they had been childhood friends.

<doc id="16120" wikidata="Q313225" url="?curid=16120" title="Jehu">
<text>Jehu (; , meaning &quot;Yah is He&quot;; &quot;Ya&#x27;úa&quot; [&quot;ia-ú-a&quot;]; ) was the tenth king of the northern Kingdom of Israel since Jeroboam I, noted for exterminating the house of Ahab. He was the son of Jehoshaphat, grandson of Nimshi, and possibly great-grandson of Omri, although the latter notion is not supported by the biblical text. His reign lasted 28 years.

William F. Albright has dated Jehu&#x27;s reign to 842–815 BCE, while E. R. Thiele offers the dates 841–814 BCE. The principal source for the events of his reign comes from 2 Kings.

== Biblical narrative ==
=== Proclamation as king ===
The reign of Jehu&#x27;s predecessor, Jehoram, was marked by the Battle of Ramoth-Gilead against the army of the Arameans. Jehoram was wounded and returned to Jezreel to recover. He was attended by Ahaziah, king of Judah, who was also his nephew, son of his sister Athaliah. Meanwhile, according to the writer of the Books of Kings, the prophet Elisha ordered one of his students to go to Ramoth-Gilead and separate Jehu, a military commander at the time, from his companions. There, he was to anoint Jehu as king in an inner chamber and explain to him that he was to act as an agent of divine judgment against the house of Ahab. The student followed these instructions, and upon completion he ran away. Jehu initially dismissed the student as a &quot;madman&quot;, but nonetheless told his companions about his anointing. His companions later enthusiastically blew their trumpets and proclaimed him their king.

=== Jezreel and the deaths of Jehoram and Jezebel ===
With a chosen band, Jehu planned his conspiracy against King Jehoram and secretly entered Jezreel. Jehoram tried to flee, but Jehu shot an arrow that pierced his heart. Jehu later threw his body on Naboth&#x27;s vineyard, to avenge Naboth, whom Jehoram&#x27;s father and mother had murdered. King Ahaziah fled after seeing Jehoram&#x27;s death but Jehu wounded him. Ahaziah fled to Megiddo, where he died.

Jehu proceeded to enter the premises of the palace at Jezreel. Jezebel watched him with contempt from the palace window and mockingly compared him to King Zimri. Jehu later commanded Jezebel&#x27;s eunuchs to throw her out of the palace window. They obeyed his commands and Jezebel was instantly killed. Jehu trampled over her body, and when he decided later to arrange a proper burial due to her royal descent, only her skull, hands and feet remained. The rest of her body had been eaten by dogs.

Now master of Jezreel, Jehu wrote to command the chief men in Samaria to hunt down and kill all the royal princes. They did so, and the next day they piled the 70 heads in two heaps outside the city gate, as Jehu commanded. Ahab&#x27;s entire family was slain. Shortly afterward, Jehu encountered the 42 &quot;brothers of Ahaziah&quot; (since the brothers of Ahaziah had been taken away and probably killed by the Philistines, these must have been relatives of Ahaziah in a broader sense, like nephews and cousins) at &quot;Beth-eked of the shepherds&quot;. They told Jehu they were visiting the royal family. Jehu killed them all at &quot;the pit of Beth-eked&quot;.

After Jehu&#x27;s slaughter of the House of Ahab, he met Jehonadab the Rechabite and convinced him that he was pro-Yahwist. Jehonadab quickly allied with him, and they entered the capital together. In control of Samaria, he invited the worshippers of Baal to a ceremony, then trapped and killed them. He then destroyed their idols and temple, and turned the temple into a latrine.

=== Reign ===
Other than Jehu&#x27;s bloody seizure of power and tolerance for the golden calves at Dan and Bethel, which was criticized as a &quot;heretical&quot; interpretation of Yahwism, little else is known of his reign. He was hard pressed by Hazael, king of the Arameans, who defeated his armies &quot;throughout all of the territories of Israel&quot; beyond the Jordan River, in the lands of Gilead, Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh.

This suggests that Jehu offered tribute to Shalmaneser III, as depicted on his Black Obelisk, in order to gain a powerful ally against the Arameans. &quot;Bit-Khumri&quot; was used by Tiglath-Pileser III for the non-Omride kings Pekah (733) &amp; Hoshea (732), hence House/Land/Kingdom of Omri could apply to later Israelite kings not necessarily descended from Omri. According to others, this description should be taken very literally, as in this period Assyrians were very closely following the events in this area, with control slipping in later years.

The destruction of the house of Ahab is commended by the author of 2 Kings as a form of divine punishment. Yahweh rewards Jehu for being a willing executor of divine judgment by allowing four generations of kings to sit on the throne of Israel. Jehu and his descendants Jehoahaz, Jehoash, Jeroboam II, and Zachariah ruled Israel for 102 years. Nonetheless, according to the Book of Hosea, God punished the House of Jehu through the hands of the Assyrians for Jehu&#x27;s massacre at Jezreel, and some Biblical commentators reasoned that this was because Jehu&#x27;s motives may not have been entirely pure in his massacre.

== Archaeological evidences ==

=== Tel Dan Stele ===

The author of the Tel Dan Stele (9th century BCE, found in 1993 and 1994) claimed to have slain both Ahaziah of Judah and Jehoram of Israel. Most scholars identify Hazael of Damascus (c. 842 – 806 BCE) as the author, the Damascan king who fought a great war against Israel and Juda. Apparently the coalition that had been forged between Ahab and Hadadezer, who had provided the main force that stopped the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III at the Battle of Qarqar, had fallen apart under their successors and in the succeeding war between Israel-Juda against Aram-Damascus the kings of Israel and Juda were killed. Jehu, already an important military leader, then became king after this event.

=== Black Obelisk ===
Aside from the Hebrew Scriptures, Jehu appears in Assyrian documents, notably in the Black Obelisk, where he is depicted as kissing the ground in front of Shalmaneser III and presenting a gift (&quot;maddattu ša Ia-ú-a...kaspu mâdu&quot; &quot;tribute of Jehu...much silver&quot;). In the Assyrian documents, Jehu is simply called &quot;son of Omri&quot; (, possibly expressing his having been the ruler of &quot;the House of Omri&quot;, a later Assyrian designation for the Kingdom of Israel), but since his grandfather Nimshi might have been a son of Omri, it could have been just describing a well-known descendency. This tribute is dated ca. 841 BCE by a fragment from Calah. It is the earliest preserved depiction of an Israelite. One more argument that Jehu was or styled himself as a descendent of Omri is the fact that he moved the capital back to Samaria, which was the capital in Omri&#x27;s days.

According to the Obelisk, Jehu severed his alliances with Phoenicia and Judah, and became subject to Assyria. Apparently, faced with the aggression of Aram-Damascus in the north and also rebellion of the Moabites (see Mesha stele) in the east, Jehu had no other options then yield to the Assyrians, who would resume their attacks at Aram-Damascus, thus relieving the pressure on Israel.


== In popular culture ==
Jehu is portrayed by George Nader in the film &quot;Sins of Jezebel&quot; (1953).

Drive Like Jehu was an American post-hardcore band from San Diego active from 1990 to 1995. The band&#x27;s name was derived from 2 Kings 9:20: &quot;And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving [is] like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously&quot;.

<text>Joshua (), also known as Yehoshua ( &quot;Yəhōšuaʿ&quot;, Tiberian: &quot;Yŏhōšuaʿ,&quot; lit. &#x27;Yahweh is salvation&#x27;), Jehoshua, or Josue, functioned as Moses&#x27; assistant in the books of Exodus and Numbers, and later succeeded Moses as leader of the Israelite tribes in the Book of Joshua of the Hebrew Bible. His name was Hoshea ( &quot;Hōšēaʿ&quot;, lit. &#x27;Save&#x27;) the son of Nun, of the tribe of Ephraim, but Moses called him &quot;Yehoshua&quot; (translated as &quot;Joshua&quot; in English), the name by which he is commonly known in English. According to the Bible, he was born in Egypt prior to the Exodus.

The Hebrew Bible identifies Joshua as one of the twelve spies of Israel sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan. In and after the death of Moses, he led the Israelite tribes in the conquest of Canaan, and allocated lands to the tribes. According to biblical chronology, Joshua lived some time in the Bronze Age. According to Joshua died at the age of 110.

Joshua holds a position of respect among Muslims, who also see him as the leader of the faithful following the death of Moses. In Islam, it is also believed that Yusha bin Nun (Joshua) was the &quot;attendant&quot; of Moses mentioned in the Quran before Moses meets Khidr. Joshua plays a role in Islamic literature, with significant narration in the hadith.

==Name==
The English name &quot;Joshua&quot; is a rendering of the Hebrew &quot;Yehoshua&quot;, and is mostly interpreted as &quot;Yahweh is salvation&quot;; although others have also alternatively interpreted it as &quot;Yahweh is lordly&quot;. The theophoric name appears to be constructed from a combination of the Tetragrammaton with the Hebrew noun יְשׁוּעָה (Modern: &quot;yəšūʿa&quot;, Tiberian: &quot;yăšūʿā&quot;), meaning &quot;salvation&quot;; derived from the Hebrew root ישׁע (&quot;y-š-ʿ&quot;), meaning &quot;to save/help/deliver&quot;. Other theophoric names sharing a similar meaning can also be found throughout the Hebrew Bible, such as that of the son of David אֱלִישׁוּעַ (&quot;ʾĔlīšūaʿ&quot;), whose name means &quot;My El (God) is salvation&quot;.

&quot;Jesus&quot; is the English derivative of the Greek transliteration of &quot;Yehoshua&quot; via Latin. In the Septuagint, all instances of the word &quot;Yehoshua&quot; are rendered as &quot;&quot; (Iēsûs), the closest Greek pronunciation of the . Thus, in modern Greek, Joshua is called &quot;Jesus son of Naue&quot; (, &quot;tû Nauḗ&quot;) to differentiate him from Jesus. This is also true in some Slavic languages following the Eastern Orthodox tradition (e.g. &quot;&quot;, &quot;Iisús Navín&quot;, in Bulgarian, Serbian and Russian, but not Czech).

==Biblical narrative==
===The Exodus===
Joshua was a major figure in the events of the Exodus. He was charged by Moses with selecting and commanding a militia group for their first battle after exiting Egypt, against the Amalekites in Rephidim, in which they were victorious.

He later accompanied Moses when he ascended biblical Mount Sinai to commune with God, visualize God&#x27;s plan for the Israelite tabernacle, and receive the Ten Commandments. Joshua was with Moses when he descended from the mountain, heard the Israelites&#x27; celebrations around the Golden Calf, and broke the tablets bearing the words of the commandments. Similarly, in the narrative which refers to Moses being able to speak with God in his tent of meeting outside the camp, Joshua is seen as custodian of the tent (&#x27;tabernacle of meeting&#x27;) when Moses returned to the Israelite encampment. However, when Moses returned to the mountain to re-create the tablets recording the Ten Commandments, Joshua was not present, as the biblical text states &quot;no man shall come up with you&quot;.

Later, Joshua was identified as one of the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore and report on the land of Canaan, and only he and Caleb gave an encouraging report, a reward for which would be that only these two of their entire generation would enter the promised land.

According to Joshua 1:1, God appointed Joshua to succeed Moses as leader of the Israelites along with giving him a blessing of invincibility during his lifetime. The first part of the book of Joshua covers the period when he led the conquest of Canaan.

===Conquest of Canaan===

At the Jordan River, the waters parted, as they had for Moses at the Red Sea. The first battle after the crossing of the Jordan was the Battle of Jericho. Joshua led the destruction of Jericho, then moved on to Ai, a small neighboring city to the west. However, they were defeated with thirty-six Israelite deaths. The defeat was attributed to Achan taking an &quot;accursed thing&quot; from Jericho; and was followed by Achan and his family and animals being stoned to death to restore God&#x27;s favor. Joshua then went to defeat Ai.

The Israelites faced an alliance of five Amorite kings from Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon. At Gibeon, Joshua asked the to cause the Sun and Moon to stand still, so that he could finish the battle in daylight. According to the text, the Sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day. This event is most notable because &quot;There has been no day like it before or since, when the heeded the voice of a man, for the Lord fought for Israel.&quot; The also fought for the Israelites in this battle, for he hurled huge hailstones from the sky which killed more Canaanites than those which the Israelites slaughtered. From there on, Joshua was able to lead the Israelites to several victories, securing much of the land of Canaan. He presided over the Israelite gatherings at Gilgal and Shiloh which allocated land to the tribes of Israel (Joshua 14:1–5 and 18:1–10), and the Israelites rewarded him with the Ephraimite city of Timnath-heres or Timnath-serah, where he settled (Joshua 19:50).

According to the Talmud, Joshua in his book enumerated only those towns on the frontier.

===Death===

When he was &quot;old and well advanced in years&quot;, Joshua convened the elders and chiefs of the Israelites and exhorted them to have no fellowship with the native population, because it could lead them to be unfaithful to God. At a general assembly of the clans at Shechem, he took leave of the people, admonishing them to be loyal to their God, who had been so mightily manifested in the midst of them. As a witness of their promise to serve God, Joshua set up a great stone under an oak by the sanctuary of God. Soon afterward he died, at the age of 110, and was buried at Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.

==Historicity==
===Current mainstream opinion===
The prevailing scholarly view is that the Book of Joshua is not a factual account of historical events. The apparent setting of Joshua is the 13th century BCE which was a time of widespread city-destruction, but with a few exceptions (Hazor, Lachish) the destroyed cities are not the ones the Bible associates with Joshua, and the ones it does associate with him show little or no sign of even being occupied at the time. Given its lack of historicity, Carolyn Pressler in her commentary for the &quot;Westminster Bible Companion&quot; series suggests that readers of Joshua should give priority to its theological message (&quot;what passages teach about God&quot;) and be aware of what these would have meant to audiences in the seventh and sixth centuries BCE. Richard Nelson explained that the needs of the centralised monarchy favoured a single story of origins, combining old traditions of an exodus from Egypt, belief in a national god as &quot;divine warrior,&quot; and explanations for ruined cities, social stratification and ethnic groups, and contemporary tribes.

It has been argued that the Book of Joshua holds little historical value. The archaeological evidence shows that Jericho and Ai were not occupied in the Near Eastern Late Bronze Age, although recent excavations at Jericho have questioned this. The story of the conquest perhaps represents the nationalist propaganda of the eighth century BCE kings of Judah and their claims to the territory of the Kingdom of Israel, incorporated into an early form of Joshua written late in the reign of king Josiah (reigned 640–609 BCE). The book was probably revised and completed after the fall of Jerusalem to the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE, and possibly after the return from the Babylonian exile in 538 BCE.

===M. Noth (1930s)===
In the 1930s Martin Noth made a sweeping criticism of the usefulness of the Book of Joshua for history. Noth was a student of Albrecht Alt, who emphasized form criticism and the importance of etiology. Alt and Noth posited a peaceful movement of the Israelites into various areas of Canaan, &quot;contra&quot; the Biblical account.

===W.F. Albright (1930s)===
William Foxwell Albright questioned the &quot;tenacity&quot; of etiologies, which were key to Noth&#x27;s analysis of the campaigns in Joshua. Archaeological evidence in the 1930s showed that the city of Ai, an early target for conquest in the putative Joshua account, had existed and been destroyed, but in the 22nd century BCE. Some alternate sites for Ai have been proposed which would partially resolve the discrepancy in dates, but these sites have not been widely accepted.

===K. Kenyon (1951)===
In 1951 Kathleen Kenyon showed that City IV at Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) was destroyed at the end of the Middle Bronze Age (c. 2100–1550 BCE), not during the Late Bronze Age (c. 1550–1200 BCE). Kenyon argued that the early Israelite campaign could not be historically corroborated, but rather explained as an etiology of the location and a representation of the Israelite settlement.

===G.E. Wright (1955)===
In 1955, G. Ernest Wright discussed the correlation of archaeological data to the early Israelite campaigns, which he divided into three phases per the Book of Joshua. He pointed to two sets of archaeological findings that &quot;seem to suggest that the biblical account is in general correct regarding the nature of the late thirteenth and twelfth-eleventh centuries in the country&quot; (i.e., &quot;a period of tremendous violence&quot;). He gives particular weight to what were then recent digs at Hazor by Yigael Yadin.

==Religious views==
===In Judaism===
====In rabbinical literature====
In rabbinic literature Joshua is regarded as a faithful, humble, deserving, wise man. Biblical verses illustrative of these qualities and of their reward are applied to him. &quot;He that waits on his master shall be honored&quot; is construed as a reference to Joshua, as is also the first part of the same verse, &quot;Whoso keeps the fig-tree shall eat the fruit thereof&quot;. That &quot;honor shall uphold the humble in spirit&quot; is proved by Joshua&#x27;s victory over Amalek. Not the sons of Moses—as Moses himself had expected—but Joshua was appointed as Moses&#x27; successor. Moses was shown how Joshua reproved that Othniel.

&quot;God would speak to Moses face to face, like someone would speak to his friend. Then he would return to the camp. But his attendant, Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, would not leave the tent. Joshua never moved from the tent&quot;. Didn&#x27;t Joshua leave the tent to eat, sleep or attend to his needs? This praise shows that Joshua had complete faith in Moses, the Tzaddik. One who has this faith is cognizant of the tzaddik in everything he does; he remains steadfastly with the tzaddik whatever he does.

According to rabbinic tradition, Joshua, when dividing the Land of Canaan among the twelve tribes of Israel, planted sea squill () to mark off the butts and bounds of tribal properties.

Moreover, Joshua, on dividing the land of Canaan amongst the tribes of Israel, made the tribes agree to ten conditions, the most important of which being the common use of the forests as pasture for cattle, and the common right of fishing in the Sea of Tiberias. Natural springs were to be used for drinking and laundry by all tribes, although the tribe to which the water course fell had the first rights. Prickly burnet (&quot;Sarcopoterium spinosum&quot;) and the camelthorn (&quot;Alhagi maurorum&quot;) could be freely collected as firewood by any member of any tribe, in any tribal territory.

====In prayer====
According to Jewish religious tradition, upon making Aliyah by crossing the Jordan River to enter the Land of Israel, Joshua composed the Aleinu prayer thanking God. This idea was first cited in the Kol Bo of the late 14th Century. Several medieval commentators noticed that Joshua&#x27;s shorter birth name, Hosea, appears in the first few verses of Aleinu in reverse acrostic: ע – עלינו, ש – שלא שם, ו – ואנחנו כורעים, ה – הוא אלוקינו. The Teshuvot HaGeonim, a Geonic responsum, discussed that Joshua composed the Aleinu because although the Israelites had made Aliyah to the Promised Land, they were surrounded by other peoples, and he wanted the Jews to draw a clear distinction between themselves, who knew and accepted the sovereignty of God, and those nations of the world which did not. In the modern era, religious Jews still pray the Aliyah inspired Aleinu three times daily, including on the High Holidays. The Aleinu prayer begins:

===In Christianity===
Most modern Bibles translate to identify Jesus as a better Joshua, as Joshua led Israel into the rest of Canaan, but Jesus leads the people of God into &quot;God&#x27;s rest&quot;. Among the early Church Fathers, Joshua is considered a type of Jesus Christ.

The story of Joshua and the Canaanite kings is also alluded to in the 2 Meqabyan, a book considered canonical in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.

===In Islam===
====Quranic references====
Joshua (, &quot;Yūšaʿ ibn Nūn&quot; , is not mentioned by name in the Quran, but his name appears in other Islamic literature. In the Quranic account of the conquest of Canaan, Joshua and Caleb are referenced, but not named, as two God-fearing men on whom God &quot;had bestowed His grace&quot;.

Joshua is also referred to in the journey Musa (Moses) took with him to find Khidr. 

The narration collected by Bukhari reports that a man approached Moses after he gave a talk and asked him, &quot;Who is the most knowledgeable person on earth?&quot; Moses responded, &quot;That would be me!&quot; So Allah revealed to Moses that he should not have said this and there was in fact someone who was more knowledgeable than him. Moses was commanded to travel to meet this man, named Al-Khaḍir, at the junction of the two seas. Islamic scholars have argued this could be the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, the southern part of Sinai where the Rea Sea splits into the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba, or the Bosporus in Istanbul which is a strait between the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara.

====Hadith, exegesis, traditions====
Joshua was regarded by some classical scholars as the prophetic successor to Moses () Al-Tabari relates in his &quot;History of the Prophets and Kings&quot; that Joshua was one of the twelve spies, and Muslim scholars believe that the two believing spies referred to in the Quran are Joshua and Caleb. Joshua was exceptional among the Israelites for being one of the few faithful followers of Allah.

Significant events from Joshua&#x27;s Muslim narratives include the crossing of the Jordan river and the conquest of &quot;Bait al-Maqdis&quot;. 

The traditional Muslim scholastic commentaries has narrated the miracle which shown by Joshua as a sign that he is a prophet in Islam. Ibn Kathir gave commentary of Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal Hadith that during the siege of Jerusalem, Yoshua prayed to God to withheld the sun until he won, which resulted in the day did not cease, and the sun only set after the Israelites under Joshua manage to capture the city. &quot;al-Jalalayn&quot; says, &quot;Ahmad [b. Hanbal] reported in his Musnad, the [following] hadīth, &#x27;The sun was never detained for any human, except for Joshua during those days in which he marched towards the Holy House [of Jerusalem]&#x27;.&quot;

Muslim literature includes traditions of Joshua not found in the Hebrew Bible. Joshua is credited with being present at Moses&#x27;s death and literature records that Moses&#x27;s garments were with Joshua at the time of his departure. In Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, Joshua is mentioned as Yusha&#x27; bin Nun and is the attendant to Moses during his meeting with Khidr. This hadith episode was used by scholars for the exegesis of Quran scripture chapter Al-Kahf about the journey of Moses.

==In art and literature==

In the literary tradition of medieval Europe, Joshua is known as one of the Nine Worthies. In &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; Joshua&#x27;s spirit appears to Dante in the Heaven of Mars, where he is grouped with the other &quot;warriors of the faith.&quot;

Baroque composer Georg Frideric Handel composed the oratorio &quot;Joshua&quot; in 1747. Composer Franz Waxman composed an oratorio &quot;Joshua&quot; in 1959. Marc-Antoine Charpentier composed &quot;Josue&quot; (H.404 and H.404 a), an oratorio for soloists, double chorus, double orchestra and continuo, in 1680.

==Nomenclature in biology==
According to legend, Mormon pioneers in the United States first referred to the &quot;yucca brevifolia&quot; agave plant as the Joshua tree because its branches reminded them of Joshua stretching his arms upward in supplication, guiding the travelers westward.

Joshua is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of snake, Joshua&#x27;s blind snake (&quot;Trilepida joshuai&quot;), the holotype of which was collected at Jericó, Antioquia, Colombia.

==Jewish holidays==
===Religious holiday===
The annual commemoration of Joshua&#x27;s yahrtzeit (the anniversary of his death) is marked on the 26th of Nisan on the Hebrew calendar. Thousands make the pilgrimage to the Tomb of Joshua at Kifl Haris near Nablus, West Bank, on the preceding night.

===Israeli Zionist holiday===
Yom HaAliyah (Aliyah Day; ) is an Israeli national holiday celebrated annually on the tenth of the Hebrew month of Nisan, as per the opening clause of the Yom HaAliyah Law, as a Zionist celebration of &quot;Jewish immigration to the Land of Israel as the basis for the existence of the State of Israel&quot;, and secondarily &quot;to mark the date of entry into the Land of Israel&quot;, i.e. to commemorate Joshua having led the Israelites across the Jordan River into the Land of Israel while carrying the Ark of the Covenant.

==Tomb of Joshua==
===Samaritan and Jewish traditions===
According to a Samaritan tradition, noted in 1877, the tombs of Joshua and Caleb were in Kifl Haris.

According to , the tomb of Joshua is in Timnath-heres, and Jewish tradition also places the tombs of Joshua&#x27;s father, Nun, an his companion, Caleb, at that site, which is identified by Orthodox Jews with Kifl Haris. Thousands make the pilgrimage to the tombs on the annual commemoration of Joshua&#x27;s death, 26th of Nisan on the Hebrew calendar.

It seems that old Jewish traditions once associated Meron in the Upper Galilee with the burial site of Joshua.

===Islamic sites===
Joshua is believed by some Muslims to be buried on Joshua&#x27;s Hill in the Beykoz district of Istanbul. Alternative traditional sites for his tomb are situated in Israel (the Shia shrine at Al-Nabi Yusha&#x27;), Jordan (An-Nabi Yusha&#x27; bin Noon, a Sunni shrine near the city of Al-Salt), Iran (Historical cemetery of Takht e Foolad in Esfahan) and Iraq (the Nabi Yusha&#x27; shrine of Baghdad). A local tradition combining three versions of three different Yushas, including biblical Joshua, places the tomb inside a cave in the Tripoli Mountains, overlooking the coastal town of el-Minyieh near Tripoli, Lebanon.

<text>Jeroboam I (; Hebrew: &quot;Yārŏḇʿām&quot;; ), frequently cited Jeroboam son of Nebat, was, according to the Hebrew Bible, the first king of the northern Kingdom of Israel following a revolt of the ten tribes against Rehoboam that put an end to the United Monarchy. According to the book of 1 Kings, he reigned for 22 years and &quot;there was war continually between Rehoboam and Jeroboam&quot;. Jeroboam also fought Abijam son of Rehoboam king of Judah. Jeroboam is often described as doing &quot;evil in the sight of the Lord&quot;, and all the rest of the northern kings were also described in the same way. 

William F. Albright has dated his reign from 922 to 901 BC, while Edwin R. Thiele offers the dates 931 to 910 BC.

There has been much academic discussion in recent years on whether Jeroboam I existed and whether he may be a retrojection of Jeroboam II, though there is not a consensus on the topic.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Yārŏḇ‘ām&quot; is commonly held to have been derived from &quot;rīḇ&quot; and &quot;ʿam&quot; , signifying &quot;the people contend&quot; or &quot;he pleads the people&#x27;s cause&quot;. It is alternatively translated to mean &quot;his people are many&quot; or &quot;he increases the people&quot; (from &quot;rbb&quot;, meaning &quot;to increase&quot;), or even &quot;he that opposes the people&quot;. In the Septuagint he is called &quot;Hieroboam&quot; (Ἱεροβοάμ).

==Biblical background==
Jeroboam was the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zereda. His mother, named Zeruah (צרוע &quot;leprous&quot;) was a widow. He had at least two sons, Abijah and Nadab; Nadab succeeded Jeroboam on the throne.

King Solomon made the young Jeroboam a over his tribesmen in the building of the fortress Millo in Jerusalem and of other public works, where he became conversant with the widespread discontent caused by the extravagances which marked the reign of Solomon.

Influenced by the words of the prophet Ahijah, he began to form conspiracies with the aim of becoming king; but these plans were discovered, and he fled to Egypt, where he remained under the protection of Pharaoh Shishak until the death of Solomon. After learning of Solomon’s death, Jeroboam returned and participated in a delegation sent to ask the new king Rehoboam to reduce taxes. After Rehoboam rejected their petition, ten of the tribes withdrew their allegiance to the house of David and proclaimed Jeroboam their king, forming the northern kingdom of Israel (Samaria). Only the tribes of Judah and Benjamin remained to form the rump kingdom of Judah, loyal to Rehoboam.

===Temples===

Jeroboam rebuilt and fortified Shechem as the capital of the northern kingdom. Fearing that the pilgrimages to the temple in Jerusalem prescribed by the Law might provide an occasion for his people to go back to their old allegiances, Jeroboam built two state temples with golden calves, one in Bethel and the other in Dan. This act is condemned by an unnamed prophet in 1 Kings 13, where the LORD declares that Jeroboam has cast YHWH behind his back. Jeroboam further deviated from normative Torah law by declaring the holiday of Sukkot in the eighth month of the calendar instead of the seventh (perhaps by adding a leap month in Elul).

According to 1 Kings, while Jeroboam was engaged in offering incense at Bethel, a &quot;man of God&quot; warned him that &quot;a son named Josiah will be born to the house of David&quot;, who would destroy the altar (referring to King Josiah of Judah who would rule approximately three hundred years later). When Jeroboam attempted to have the prophet arrested for his bold words of defiance, the king&#x27;s hand was &quot;dried up&quot;, and the altar before which he stood was rent asunder. At the entreaty of the man of God, his hand was restored to him again, but the miracle made no abiding impression on him. Jeroboam offered hospitality to the man of God but this was declined, not out of contempt but in obedience to the command of God. The prophecy is fulfilled in 2 Kings.

=== Identity of related figures ===

Josephus and Jerome identify the &quot;man of God&quot; who warned Jeroboam as the seer named Iddo.

The wife of Jeroboam is a character in the Hebrew Bible. Though unnamed in the Masoretic text, she appears in the Septuagint as an Egyptian princess called Ano:
:&quot;And Sousakim gave to Jeroboam Ano the eldest sister of Thekemina his wife, to him as wife; she was great among the king&#x27;s daughters...&quot; 

In 1 Kings, Jeroboam&#x27;s son Abijah falls ill, and Jeroboam sends his wife to the prophet Ahijah. Ahijah&#x27;s message, however, is that Abijah will die, which he does. According to &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;, the good that Abijah did for which he would be laid in the grave (&quot;Rabbinical Literature: The passage, I Kings, xiv. 13, in which there is a reference to &quot;some good thing [found in him] toward the Lord God of Israel&quot;) is interpreted (M. Ḳ. 28b) as an allusion to Abijah&#x27;s courageous and pious act in removing the sentinels placed by his father on the frontier between Israel and Judah to prevent pilgrimages to Jerusalem. Some assert that Abijah himself undertook a pilgrimage.&quot; Nevertheless, these sentinels on the frontier were not removed until the reign of Hoshea, last king of the northern Kingdom of Israel. The Rabbis explain the description of Hoshea &quot;And he did what was evil in the eyes of the L‑rd, though not like the kings of Israel who had preceded him.&quot;

==War with Judah==

According to the Hebrew Bible, Jeroboam was in &quot;constant war with the house of Judah&quot;. While the southern kingdom made no serious military effort to regain power over the north, there was a long-lasting boundary dispute, fighting over which lasted most of Jeroboam’s reign. 

In the eighteenth year of Jeroboam&#x27;s reign, Abijah (also known as Abijam), Rehoboam&#x27;s son, became king of Judah. During his short reign of three years, Abijah went to considerable lengths to bring the Kingdom of Israel back under his control. He waged a major battle against Jeroboam in the mountains of Ephraim. According to the Book of Chronicles Abijah had a force of 400,000 and Jeroboam 800,000. The Biblical sources mention that Abijah addressed the armies of Israel, urging them to submit and to let the Kingdom of Israel be whole again, but his plea fell on deaf ears. The biblical account states that his elite warriors fended off a pincer movement and routed Jeroboam&#x27;s troops, killing 500,000 of them.

Jeroboam was crippled by this severe defeat to Abijah and posed little threat to the Kingdom of Judah for the rest of his reign. He also lost the towns of Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron, with their surrounding villages. Bethel was an important centre for Jeroboam&#x27;s Golden Calf cult (which used non-Levites as priests), located on Israel&#x27;s southern border, which had been allocated to the Tribe of Benjamin by Joshua, as was Ephron, which is believed to be the Ophrah that was allocated to the Tribe of Benjamin by Joshua.

Jeroboam died soon after Abijam.

==Rabbinic literature==
According to Rabbinic literature, Gehazi possessed a magnet by which he lifted up the idol made by Jeroboam, so that it was seen between heaven and earth; he had &quot;Yhwh&quot; engraved on it, and in consequence the idol (a calf) pronounced the first two words of the Decalogue (ib.).

That Ahijah, though one of the pillars of righteousness, should have been sent to Jeroboam with a divine message inducing him to establish his idolatrous kingdom is explained by the rabbis in the following manner: They say that he was entrapped by a ruse of Jeroboam&#x27;s idolatrous friends, who circulated a document requesting Jeroboam to become king and stipulating that, if he were elected, he set up a golden calf at Dan and Beth-El. Ahijah signed this document, believing firmly that Jeroboam would not belie his trust. Herein he was mistaken in his pupil. Jeroboam had shown great wisdom and learning, and appeared to Ahijah &quot;as pure as the new garment&quot; he wore when Ahijah saw him coming out of Jerusalem (I Kings, xi. 29). Moreover, as he excelled all the rest of the pupils, he had been initiated by Ahijah into the innermost secrets of the Law (Sanh. 101b et seq.). Just as the words said of Isaac, &quot;his eyes were dim, so that he could not see&quot; (Gen. xxvii. 1), are taken to refer to spiritual blindness, because he favored his wicked son Esau, so the words, &quot;Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were set by reason of his age&quot; (I Kings, xiv. 4), imply spiritual blindness on the part of Ahijah, who favored a wicked pupil and set him up as ruler (Gen. R. lxv.). For this reason Ahijah was stricken with the plague (Gen. R. lxv., Yer. Yeb. xvi. 15c and parallels).
Jeroboam became for the rabbinical writers a typical evil-doer. This appears in the Septuagint (2d recension), where even his mother is represented as a disreputable woman. The name is explained as (= &quot;one that caused strife among the people,&quot; or &quot;one that caused strife between the people and their Heavenly Father&quot;; Sanh. 108b). The name (Nebat) of his father is construed as implying some defect in his progenitor. Jeroboam is excluded from the world to come (Yalḳ., Kings, 196). Although he reached the throne because he reproved Solomon, he was nevertheless punished for doing so publicly (ib.). In the meeting between Jeroboam and the Shilonite the Rabbis detect indications of Jeroboam&#x27;s presumption, his zeal for impious innovations (ib.). His arrogance brought about his doom (Sanh. 101b). His political reasons for introducing idolatry are condemned (Sanh.90). As one that led many into sin, the sins of many cling to him (Abot v. 18). He is said to have invented one hundred and three interpretations of the law in reference to the priests to justify his course. At first God was pleased with him and his sacrifice because he was pious, and in order to prevent his going astray proposed to His council of angels to remove him from earth, but He was prevailed upon to let him live; and then Jeroboam, while still a lad, turned to wickedness. God had offered to raise him into Gan &#x27;Eden; but when Jeroboam heard that Jesse&#x27;s son would enjoy the highest honors there, he refused. Jeroboam had even learned the &quot;mysteries of the chariot&quot; (Midr. Teh.; see &quot;Sefer Midrash Abot,&quot; Warsaw, 1896).&quot;...If the person suffers indignities after his death, this too, can atone for his sins, and gain him a share in the World to Come. For example, the Talmud says that King Jeroboam, a brazen idolater who incited the population to follow his G‑dless ways, and certainly deserved to be excluded from the World to Come, will nevertheless arise when the time of resurrection arrives. Why? Because many years after he died his remains were ignominiously burned in fire.&quot;
 An account of Joshua Ben Levi reporting from hell tells how in the fourth compartment are ten nations presided by Jeroboam. The angel who punishes them is Maktiel (Matniel). Jeroboam, however, has immunity for he himself had studied the Law, and he cometh from those who had said: &quot;We will do and hearken.&quot;

==Commentary on sources==

The account of Jeroboam&#x27;s life, like that of all his successors, ends with the formula &quot;And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel&quot;.

&quot;The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel&quot;, likely compiled by or derived from these kings&#x27; own scribes, is likely the source for the basic facts of Jeroboam&#x27;s life and reign, though the compiler(s) of the extant Book of Kings clearly made selective use of it and added hostile commentaries. His family was eventually wiped out.

The prophecies of doom concerning the fall of both the House of Jeroboam and the northern kingdom as a whole (&quot;For the Lord shall smite Israel..., and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river&quot;, might have been composed retroactively, after the events described had already come to pass. Alternatively, the prophecy could have been a logical deduction. Judah had just been conquered and turned into a vassal of Egypt, while Israel stood between the Egyptian and Mesopotamian empires.

Oded and Sperling argued that the story of the golden calf in the wilderness was composed as a polemic against Jeroboam&#x27;s cultic restoration by claiming that its origins were inconsistent with worship of YHWH.

Thomas Römer argued that Jeroboam I may not have existed and that Deuteronomistic redactors transferred data from the reign of Jeroboam II to Jeroboam I, although Lester L. Grabbe finds this theory unlikely.

== In popular culture ==
Jeroboam is portrayed by Nickolas Grace in &quot;Solomon &amp; Sheba&quot; (1995) and by Richard Dillane in &quot;Solomon&quot; (1997). Both of these are television films.

Within the range of standard liquor bottle sizes, a Jeroboam (also called a Double Magnum) contains 3 liters (101.4 fluid ounces). A Rehoboam contains 4.5 liters (152.2 fluid ounces).

<text>John the Baptist ( – ) was a Jewish preacher active in the area of the Jordan River in the early first century AD. He is also known as Saint John the Forerunner in Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy, John the Immerser in some Baptist Christian traditions, and as the prophet [[John the Baptist in Islam|Yaḥyā ibn Zakariyā]] (Arabic: النبي يحيى, &quot;An-Nabī Yaḥyā&quot;) in Islam. He is sometimes alternatively referred to as John the Baptiser.

John is mentioned by the Roman Jewish historian Josephus, and he is revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Baháʼí faith, the Druze faith, and Mandaeism; in the last of these he is considered to be the final and most vital prophet. He is considered to be a prophet of God by all of the aforementioned faiths, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian denominations. According to the New Testament, John anticipated a messianic figure greater than himself; in the Gospels, he is portrayed as the precursor or forerunner of Jesus. According to the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus himself identifies John as &quot;Elijah who is to come&quot;, which is a direct reference to the Book of Malachi (Malachi 4:5), as confirmed by the angel who announced John&#x27;s birth to his father, Zechariah. According to the Gospel of Luke, John and Jesus were relatives.

Some scholars think that John belonged to the Essenes, a semi-ascetic Jewish sect who expected a messiah and practised ritual baptism. John used baptism as the central symbol or sacrament of his pre-messianic movement. Most biblical scholars agree that John baptized Jesus, and several New Testament accounts report that some of Jesus&#x27;s early followers had previously been followers of John. According to the New Testament, John was sentenced to death and subsequently beheaded by Herod Antipas around AD 30 after John rebuked him for divorcing his wife and then unlawfully wedding Herodias, the wife of his brother Herod Philip I. Josephus also mentions John in the &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; and states that he was executed by order of Herod Antipas in the fortress at Machaerus.

Followers of John existed well into the 2nd century AD, and some proclaimed him to be the Messiah awaited by Jews. In modern times, the followers of John the Baptist are the Mandaeans, an ancient ethnoreligious group who believe that he is their greatest and final prophet. In the Roman martyrology, apart from very few, John is the only saint whose birth and death are both commemorated.

==Gospel narratives==
John the Baptist is mentioned in all four canonical Gospels and the non-canonical Gospel of the Nazarenes. The Synoptic Gospels (Mark, Matthew and Luke) describe John baptising Jesus; in the Gospel of John this is inferred by many to be referred to in John 1:32.

===In Mark===
The Gospel of Mark introduces John as a fulfillment of a prophecy from the Book of Isaiah (in fact, a conflation of texts from Isaiah, Malachi and Exodus) about a messenger being sent ahead, and a voice crying out in the wilderness. John is described as wearing clothes of camel&#x27;s hair, and living on locusts and wild honey. John proclaims baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sin, and says another will come after him who will not baptize with water, but with the Holy Spirit.

Jesus comes to John, and is baptized by him in the river Jordan. The account describes how, as he emerges from the water, Jesus sees the heavens open and the Holy Spirit descends on him &quot;like a dove&quot;, and he hears a voice from heaven that says, &quot;You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased&quot;.

Later in the gospel there is an account of John&#x27;s death. It is introduced by an incident where the Tetrarch Herod Antipas, hearing stories about Jesus, imagines that this is John the Baptist raised from the dead. It then explains that John had rebuked Herod for marrying Herodias, the ex-wife of his brother (named here as Philip). Herodias demands his execution, but Herod, who &quot;liked to listen&quot; to John, is reluctant to do so because he fears him, knowing he is a &quot;righteous and holy man&quot;.

The account then describes how Herodias&#x27;s unnamed daughter dances before Herod, who is pleased and offers her anything she asks for in return. When the girl asks her mother what she should request, she is told to demand the head of John the Baptist. Reluctantly, Herod orders the beheading of John, and his head is delivered to her, at her request, on a plate. John&#x27;s disciples take the body away and bury it in a tomb.

The Gospel refers to Antipas as &quot;King&quot; and the ex-husband of Herodias is named as Philip, but he is known to have been called Herod. Although the wording clearly implies the girl was the daughter of Herodias, many texts describe her as &quot;Herod&#x27;s daughter, Herodias&quot;. Since these texts are early and significant and the reading is &#x27;difficult&#x27;, many scholars see this as the original version, altered in later versions and in Matthew and Luke. Josephus says that Herodias had a daughter by the name of Salome.

Scholars have speculated about the origins of the story. Since it shows signs of having been composed in Aramaic, which Mark apparently did not speak, he is likely to have got it from a Palestinian source. There are a variety of opinions about how much actual historical material it contains, especially given the alleged factual errors. Many scholars have seen the story of John arrested, executed, and buried in a tomb as a conscious foreshadowing of the fate of Jesus.

===In Matthew===

The Gospel of Matthew account begins with the same modified quotation from Isaiah, moving the Malachi and Exodus material to later in the text, where it is quoted by Jesus. The description of John is possibly taken directly from Mark (&quot;clothing of camel&#x27;s hair with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey&quot;), along with the proclamation that one was coming who would baptize with the Holy Spirit &quot;and fire&quot;. The book of Matthew next has Jesus coming to John to be baptized, but John objects because he is not worthy because Jesus is the one that brings the baptism in the Spirit.

Unlike Mark, Matthew describes John as critical of Pharisees and Sadducees and as preaching &quot;the kingdom of heaven is at hand&quot; and a &quot;coming judgment&quot;.

Matthew shortens the account of the beheading of John, and adds two elements: that Herod Antipas wants John dead, and that the death is reported to Jesus by his disciples. Matthew&#x27;s approach is to shift the focus away from Herod and onto John as a prototype of Jesus. Where Mark has Herod killing John reluctantly and at Herodias&#x27; insistence, Matthew describes him as wanting John dead.

===In Luke and Acts===

The Gospel of Luke adds an account of John&#x27;s infancy, introducing him as the miraculous son of Zechariah, an old priest, and his wife Elizabeth, who was past menopause and therefore unable to have children. According to this account, the birth of John was foretold by the angel Gabriel to Zechariah while he was performing his functions as a priest in the temple of Jerusalem. Since he is described as a priest of the course of Abijah and Elizabeth as one of the daughters of Aaron, this would make John a descendant of Aaron on both his father&#x27;s and mother&#x27;s side. On the basis of this account, the Catholic as well as the Anglican and Lutheran liturgical calendars placed the feast of the Nativity of John the Baptist on 24 June, six months before Christmas.

Elizabeth is described as a &quot;relative&quot; of Mary the mother of Jesus, in Luke 1:36. There is no mention of a family relationship between John and Jesus in the other Gospels, and Raymond E. Brown has described it as &quot;of dubious historicity&quot;. Géza Vermes has called it &quot;artificial and undoubtedly Luke&#x27;s creation&quot;. The many similarities between the Gospel of Luke story of the birth of John and the Old Testament account of the birth of Samuel suggest that Luke&#x27;s account of the annunciation and birth of Jesus are modeled on that of Samuel.

====Post-nativity====

Unique to the Gospel of Luke, John the Baptist explicitly teaches charity, baptizes tax-collectors, and advises soldiers.

The text briefly mentions that John is imprisoned and later beheaded by Herod, but the Gospel of Luke lacks the story of a step-daughter dancing for Herod and requesting John&#x27;s head.

The Book of Acts portrays some disciples of John becoming followers of Jesus, a development not reported by the gospels except for the early case of Andrew, Simon Peter&#x27;s brother.

===In the Gospel of John===
The fourth gospel describes John the Baptist as &quot;a man sent from God&quot; who &quot;was not the light&quot;, but &quot;came as a witness, to bear witness to the light, so that through him everyone might believe&quot;. John confirms that he is not the Christ nor Elijah nor &#x27;the prophet&#x27; when asked by Jewish priests and Pharisees; instead, he described himself as the &quot;voice of one crying in the wilderness&quot;.

Upon literary analysis, it is clear that John is the &quot;testifier and confessor &quot;par excellence&quot;&quot;, particularly when compared to figures like Nicodemus.

Jesus&#x27;s baptism is implied but not depicted. Unlike the other gospels, it is John himself who testifies to seeing &quot;the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on him&quot;. John explicitly announces that Jesus is the one &quot;who baptizes with the Holy Spirit&quot; and John even professes a &quot;belief that he is the Son of God&quot; and &quot;the Lamb of God&quot;.

The Gospel of John reports that Jesus&#x27; disciples were baptizing and that a debate broke out between some of the disciples of John and another Jew about purification. In this debate John argued that Jesus &quot;must become greater,&quot; while he (John) &quot;must become less.&quot;

The Gospel of John then points out that Jesus&#x27; disciples were baptizing more people than John. Later, the Gospel relates that Jesus regarded John as &quot;a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light&quot;.

===Comparative analysis===
All four Gospels start Jesus&#x27; ministry in association with the appearance of John the Baptist. Simon J. Joseph has argued that the Gospel demotes the historical John by depicting him only as a prophetic forerunner to Jesus whereas his ministry actually complemented Jesus&#x27;.

====The prophecy of Isaiah====

Although the Gospel of Mark implies that the arrival of John the Baptist is the fulfilment of a prophecy from the Book of Isaiah, the words quoted (&quot;I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way – a voice of one calling in the wilderness, &#x27;Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.&#x27;&quot;) are actually a composite of texts from Isaiah, Malachi and the Book of Exodus. (Matthew and Luke drop the first part of the reference.)

====Baptism of Jesus====
The gospels differ on the details of the Baptism. In Mark and Luke, Jesus himself sees the heavens open and hears a voice address him personally, saying, &quot;You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy&quot;. They do not clarify whether others saw and heard these things. Although other incidents where the &quot;voice came out of heaven&quot; are recorded in which, for the sake of the crowds, it was heard audibly, John did say in his witness that he did see the spirit coming down &quot;out of heaven&quot; (John 12:28–30, John 1:32).

In Matthew, the voice from heaven does not address Jesus personally, saying instead &quot;This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.&quot;

In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist himself sees the spirit descend as a dove, testifying about the experience as evidence of Jesus&#x27;s status.

====John&#x27;s knowledge of Jesus====

John&#x27;s knowledge of Jesus varies across gospels. In the Gospel of Mark, John preaches of a coming leader, but shows no signs of recognizing that Jesus is this leader. In Matthew, however, John immediately recognizes Jesus and John questions his own worthiness to baptize Jesus. In both Matthew and Luke, John later dispatches disciples to question Jesus about his status, asking &quot;Are you he who is to come, or shall we look for another?&quot; In Luke, John is a familial relative of Jesus whose birth was foretold by Gabriel. In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist himself sees the spirit descend like a dove and he explicitly preaches that Jesus is the Son of God.

====John and Elijah====

The Gospels vary in their depiction of John&#x27;s relationship to Elijah. Matthew and Mark describe John&#x27;s attire in a way reminiscent of the description of Elijah in 2 Kings 1:8, who also wore a garment of hair and a leather belt. In Matthew, Jesus explicitly teaches that John is &quot;Elijah who was to come&quot; (Matthew 11:14 – see also Matthew 17:11–13); many Christian theologians have taken this to mean that John was Elijah&#x27;s successor. In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist explicitly denies being Elijah. In the annunciation narrative in Luke, an angel appears to Zechariah, John&#x27;s father, and tells him that John &quot;will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God,&quot; and that he will go forth &quot;in the spirit and power of Elijah.&quot;

==In Josephus&#x27;s &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;==
An account of John the Baptist is found in all extant manuscripts of the &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; (book 18, chapter 5, 2) by Flavius Josephus (37–100):

According to this passage, the execution of John was blamed for the defeat Herod suffered. Some have claimed that this passage indicates that John died near the time of the destruction of Herod&#x27;s army in AD 36. However, in a different passage, Josephus states that the end of Herod&#x27;s marriage with Aretas&#x27;s daughter (after which John was killed) was only the beginning of hostilities between Herod and Aretas, which later escalated into the battle.

Biblical scholar John Dominic Crossan differentiates between Josephus&#x27;s account of John and Jesus, saying, &quot;John had a monopoly, but Jesus had a franchise.&quot; To get baptized, Crossan writes, a person went only to John; to stop the movement one only needed to stop John (therefore his movement ended with his death). Jesus invited all to come and see how he and his companions had already accepted the government of God, entered it and were living it. Such a communal praxis was not just for himself, but could survive without him, unlike John&#x27;s movement.

==Relics==

Matthew 14:12 records that &quot;his disciples came and took away [John&#x27;s] body and buried it.&quot; Theologian Joseph Benson refers to a belief that they managed to do so because &quot;it seems that the body had been thrown over the prison walls, without burial, probably by order of Herodias.&quot;

=== The fate of his head ===
What became of the head of John the Baptist is difficult to determine. Ancient historians Josephus, Nicephorus and Symeon Metaphrastes assumed that Herodias had it buried in the fortress of Machaerus.

An Eastern Orthodox tradition holds that, after buried, the head was discovered by John&#x27;s followers and was taken to the Mount of Olives, where it was twice buried and discovered, the latter events giving rise to the Orthodox feast of the First and Second Finding of the Head of St. John the Baptist. Other writers say that it was interred in Herod&#x27;s palace at Jerusalem; there it was found during the reign of Constantine, and thence secretly taken to Emesa (modern Homs, in Syria), where it was concealed, the place remaining unknown for years, until it was manifested by revelation in 452, an event celebrated in the Orthodox Church as the Third Finding.

An apocryphal tradition claims that after John&#x27;s death, his mother Elizabeth was told by an angel to bury him where his father lay. She was then led by the angel to the temple in which John&#x27;s father was killed by Herod I, at which point a voice called out, an earthquake rumbled, and thunder struck, and the altar of the temple opened, revealing Zechariah&#x27;s body. Elizabeth then buried John&#x27;s body under this altar.

Two Catholic churches and one mosque claim to have the head of John the Baptist: the Umayyad Mosque, in Damascus (Syria); the church of San Silvestro in Capite, in Rome; and Amiens Cathedral, in France (the French king would have had it brought from the Holy Land after the Fourth Crusade). A fourth claim is made by the Residenz Museum in Munich, Germany, which keeps a reliquary containing what the Wittelsbach rulers of Bavaria believed to be the head of Saint John.

===Right hand relics===
According to the Christian Arab Ibn Butlan, the church of Cassian in Antioch held the right arm of John the Baptist until it was smuggled to Chalcedon and later to Constantinople. An Orthodox Christian monastery in Cetinje, Montenegro, and the Catholic Cathedral of Siena, in Italy, both claim to have John the Baptist&#x27;s right arm and hand, with which he baptised Jesus. According to the Catholic account, in 1464 Pope Pius II donated what was identified as the right arm and hand of John the Baptist to the Siena Cathedral. The donation charter identifies the relic as &quot;the arm of blessed John the Baptist. And this is the very arm that baptized the Lord.&quot; The relic is displayed on the high altar of the Siena Cathedral annually in June.

Topkapi Palace, in Istanbul, claims to have John&#x27;s right hand index finger.
===Various relics and traditions===
==== Right hand – St. John the Baptist Church of Chinsurah (India) ====
John the Baptist&#x27;s right hand is allegedly preserved in the Armenian Apostolic Church of St. John at Chinsurah, West Bengal, in India, where each year on &quot;Chinsurah Day&quot; in January it blesses the Armenian Christians of Calcutta.

====Decapitation cloth====
The decapitation cloth of Saint John, the cloth which covered his head after his execution, is said to be kept at the Aachen Cathedral, in Germany.

====Historic Armenia====
According to Armenian tradition, the remains of John the Baptist would in some point have been transferred by Gregory the Illuminator to the Saint Karapet Armenian Monastery.

====Bulgaria====
In 2010, bones were discovered in the ruins of a Bulgarian church in the St. John the Forerunner Monastery (4th–17th centuries) on the Black Sea island of Sveti Ivan (Saint John) and two years later, after DNA and radio carbon testing proved the bones belonged to a Middle Eastern man who lived in the 1st century AD, scientists said that the remains could conceivably have belonged to John the Baptist. The remains, found in a reliquarium, are presently kept in the Sts. Cyril and Methodius Cathedral in Sozopol.

====Egypt====
The Coptic Orthodox Church also have claimed to hold the relics of Saint John the Baptist. A crypt and relics said to be John&#x27;s and mentioned in 11th- and 16th-century manuscripts, were discovered in 1969 during restoration of the Church of St. Macarius at the Monastery of Saint Macarius the Great in Scetes, Egypt.

====Nagorno-Karabakh====
Additional relics are claimed to reside in Gandzasar Monastery&#x27;s Cathedral of St. John the Baptist, in Nagorno-Karabakh.

==== Purported left finger bone ====
The bone of one of John the Baptist&#x27;s left fingers is said to be at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri. It is held in a Gothic-style monstrance made of gilded silver that dates back to 14th century Lower Saxony.

====Halifax, England====
Another obscure claim relates to the town of Halifax in West Yorkshire, United Kingdom, where, as patron saint of the town, John the Baptist&#x27;s head appears on the official coat-of-arms. One legend (among others) bases the etymology of the town&#x27;s place-name on &quot;halig&quot; (holy) and &quot;fax&quot; (hair), claiming that a relic of the head, or face, of John the Baptist once existed in the town.

==Religious views==
===Christianity===
The Gospels describe John the Baptist as having had a specific role ordained by God as forerunner or precursor of Jesus, who was the foretold Messiah. The New Testament Gospels speak of this role. In Luke 1:17 the role of John is referred to as being &quot;to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.&quot; In Luke 1:76 as &quot;thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways&quot; and in Luke 1:77 as being &quot;To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins.&quot;

There are several passages within the Old Testament which are interpreted by Christians as being prophetic of John the Baptist in this role. These include a passage in the Book of Malachi that refers to a prophet who would &quot;prepare the way of the Lord&quot;:

Also at the end of the next chapter in Malachi 4:5–6 it says,

The Jews of Jesus&#x27; day expected Elijah to come before the Messiah; indeed, some present day Jews continue to await Elijah&#x27;s coming as well, as in the Cup of Elijah the Prophet in the Passover Seder. This is why the disciples ask Jesus in Matthew 17:10, &quot;Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?&quot; The disciples are then told by Jesus that Elijah came in the person of John the Baptist,

These passages are applied to John in the Synoptic Gospels. But where Matthew specifically identifies John the Baptist as Elijah&#x27;s spiritual successor, the gospels of Mark and Luke are silent on the matter. The Gospel of John states that John the Baptist denied that he was Elijah.

====Influence on Paul====
Many scholars believe there was contact between the early church in the Apostolic Age and what is called the &quot;Qumran-Essene community&quot;. The Dead Sea Scrolls were found at Qumran, which the majority of historians and archaeologists identify as an Essene settlement. John the Baptist is thought to have been either an Essene or &quot;associated&quot; with the community at Khirbet Qumran. According to the Book of Acts, Paul met some &quot;disciples of John&quot; in Ephesus.

====Catholic Church====

The Catholic Church commemorates Saint John the Baptist on two feast days:
* 24 June – Nativity of Saint John the Baptist
* 29 August – Beheading of Saint John the Baptist

According to Frederick Holweck, at the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary to his mother Elizabeth, as recounted in Luke 1:39–57, John, sensing the presence of his Jesus, upon the arrival of Mary, leaped in the womb of his mother; he was then cleansed from original sin and filled with the grace of God. In her &quot;Treatise of Prayer&quot;, Saint Catherine of Siena includes a brief altercation with the Devil regarding her fight due to the Devil attempting to lure her with vanity and flattery. Speaking in the first person, Catherine responds to the Devil with the following words:

====Eastern Christianity==== 
The Eastern Catholic Churches and Eastern Orthodox faith believe that John was the last of the Old Testament prophets, thus serving as a bridge between that period of revelation and the New Covenant. They also teach that, following his death, John descended into Hades and there once more preached that Jesus the Messiah was coming, so he was the Forerunner of Christ in death as he had been in life. Eastern Catholic and Orthodox churches will often have an icon of Saint John the Baptist in a place of honor on the iconostasis, and he is frequently mentioned during the Divine Services. Every Tuesday throughout the year is dedicated to his memory.

The Eastern Orthodox Church remembers Saint John the Forerunner on six separate feast days, listed here in order in which they occur during the church year (which begins on 1 September):
* 23 September – 
* 12 October – Translation from Malta to Gatchina: of a Particle of the Life Giving Cross, the Filersk Icon of the Mother of God, and the relic of the 
* 7 January – . This is John the Baptist&#x27;s main feast day, immediately after Theophany on 6 January (7 January also commemorates the transfer of the relic of the right hand of John the Baptist from Antioch to Constantinople in 956)
January 20 In the Serbian Orthodox Church, the feast day of Saint John the Baptist is called &quot;Jovanjdan&quot; and is celebrated on January 20 (according to the Gregorian calendar). 
Key points about Jovanjdan:
Name: &quot;Jovanjdan&quot; directly translates to &quot;John&#x27;s Day&quot; in Serbian.
Significance: This is a major feast day for Serbian Orthodox Christians, often considered a family &quot;Slava&quot; (patron saint day) where families celebrate with a special feast.
Calendar note: While the Gregorian calendar date is January 20, the Serbian Orthodox Church uses the Julian calendar, which can result in a slightly different date. 
* 24 February – 
* 25 May – 
* 24 June – Nativity of Saint John the Forerunner
* 29 August – The Beheading of Saint John the Forerunner, a day of strict fast and abstinence from meat and dairy products and foods containing meat or dairy products.

In addition to the above, 5 September is the commemoration of Zacharias and Elizabeth, Saint John&#x27;s parents.

The Russian Orthodox Church observes 12 October as the Transfer of the Right Hand of the Forerunner from Malta to Gatchina (1799).

====Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches that modern revelation confirms the biblical account of John and also makes known additional events in his ministry. According to this belief, John was &quot;ordained by the angel of God&quot; when he was eight days old &quot;to overthrow the kingdom of the Jews&quot; and to prepare a people for the Lord. Latter-day Saints also believe that &quot;he was baptized while yet in his childhood.&quot;

Joseph Smith said: &quot;Let us come into New Testament times – so many are ever praising the Lord and His apostles. We will commence with John the Baptist. When Herod&#x27;s edict went forth to destroy the young children, John was about six months older than Jesus, and came under this hellish edict, and Zecharias caused his mother to take him into the mountains, where he was raised on locusts and wild honey. When his father refused to disclose his hiding place, and being the officiating high priest at the Temple that year, was slain by Herod&#x27;s order, between the porch and the altar, as Jesus said.&quot;

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints teaches that John the Baptist appeared on the banks of the Susquehanna River near Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, as a resurrected being to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery on 15 May 1829, and ordained them to the Aaronic priesthood. According to the Church&#x27;s dispensational view of religious history, John&#x27;s ministry has operated in three dispensations: he was the last of the prophets under the law of Moses; he was the first of the New Testament prophets; and he was sent to restore the Aaronic priesthood in our day (the dispensation of the fulness of times). Latter-day Saints believe John&#x27;s ministry was foretold by two prophets whose teachings are included in the Book of Mormon: Lehi and his son Nephi.

====Unification Church====

The Unification Church teaches that God intended John to help Jesus during his public ministry in Judea. In particular, John should have done everything in his power to persuade the Jewish people that Jesus was the Messiah. He was to become Jesus&#x27; main disciple and John&#x27;s disciples were to become Jesus&#x27; disciples. Unfortunately, John did not follow Jesus and continued his own way of baptizing people. Moreover, John also denied that he was Elijah when queried by several Jewish leaders, contradicting Jesus who stated John is Elijah who was to come. Many Jews therefore could not accept Jesus as the Messiah because John denied being Elijah, as the prophet&#x27;s appearance was a prerequisite for the Messiah&#x27;s arrival as stated in Malachi 4:5. According to the Unification Church, &quot;John the Baptist was in the position of representing Elijah&#x27;s physical body, making himself identical with Elijah from the standpoint of their mission.&quot;

According to Matthew 11:11, Jesus stated &quot;there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist.&quot; However, in referring to John&#x27;s blocking the way of the Jews&#x27; understanding of him as the Messiah, Jesus said &quot;yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.&quot; John&#x27;s failure to follow Jesus became the chief obstacle to the fulfillment of Jesus&#x27; mission.

====Syrian-Egyptian Gnosticism====
Among the early Judeo-Christian Gnostics the Ebionites held that John, along with Jesus and James the Just – all of whom they revered – were vegetarians. Epiphanius of Salamis records that this group had amended their Gospel of Matthew – known today as the Gospel of the Ebionites – to change where John eats &quot;locusts&quot; to read &quot;honey cakes&quot; or &quot;manna&quot;.

=== Mandaeism ===

John the Baptist, or Yuhana Maṣbana ( ) is considered the greatest prophet of the Mandaeans. Mandaeans also refer to him as (John, son of Zechariah). He plays a large part in their religious texts such as the Ginza Rabba and the Mandaean Book of John. Mandaeans believe that they descend directly from John&#x27;s original disciples but they do not believe that their religion began with John, tracing their beliefs back to their first prophet Adam. According to Mandaeism, John was a great teacher, a Nasoraean and renewer of the faith. John is a messenger of Light () and Truth () who possessed the power of healing and full Gnosis (). Mandaean texts make it abundantly clear that early Mandaeans were extremely loyal to John and viewed him as a prophetic reformer of the ancient Mandaean/Israelite tradition. Scholars such as Mark Lidzbarski, Rudolf Macúch, Ethel S. Drower, Jorunn J. Buckley, and Şinasi Gündüz believe that the Mandaeans likely have a historical connection with John&#x27;s original disciples. Mandaeans believe that John was married, with his wife named Anhar, and had children.

Enišbai (Elizabeth) is mentioned as the mother of John the Baptist in chapters 18, 21, and 32 of the Mandaean Book of John.

===Islam===

In Islam, John the Baptist is known as Yaḥyā ibn Zakariyā () and considered the maternal cousin of Jesus as well as a prophet. He is also believed by Muslims to have been a witness to the word of God who would herald the coming of Jesus. His father Zechariah was also an Islamic prophet. Islamic tradition maintains that John met Muhammad on the night of the Mi&#x27;raj, along with Jesus in the second heaven. John&#x27;s story was also told to the Abyssinian king during the Muslim refugees&#x27; Migration to Abyssinia. According to the Quran, John was one on whom God sent peace on the day that he was born and the day that he died.

====Quranic mentions====
The Quran claims that John the Baptist was the first to receive this name () but since the name Yoḥanan occurs many times before John the Baptist, this verse is referring either to Islamic scholar consensus that &quot;Yaḥyā&quot; is not the same name as &quot;Yoḥanan&quot; or to the Biblical account of the miraculous naming of John, which accounted that he was almost named &quot;Zacharias&quot; (Greek: ) after his father&#x27;s name, as no one in the lineage of his father Zacharias (also known as Zechariah) had been named &quot;John&quot; (&quot;Yohanan&quot;/&quot;Yoannes&quot;) before him.

In the Quran, God frequently mentions Zechariah&#x27;s continuous praying for the birth of a son. Zechariah&#x27;s wife, mentioned in the New Testament as Elizabeth () was barren and therefore the birth of a child seemed impossible. As a gift from God, Zechariah () was given a son by the name of &quot;Yaḥya&quot; or &quot;John&quot;, a name specially chosen for this child alone. In accordance with Zechariah&#x27;s prayer, God made John and Jesus, who according to exegesis was born six months later, renew the message of God, which had been corrupted and lost by the Israelites. The Quran says:

According to the Quran, John was exhorted to hold fast to the Scripture and was given wisdom by God while still a child. He was pure and devout, and walked well in the presence of God. He was dutiful towards his parents and he was not arrogant or rebellious. John&#x27;s reading and understanding of the scriptures, when only a child, surpassed even that of the greatest scholars of the time. Muslim exegesis narrates that Jesus sent John out with twelve disciples, who preached the message before Jesus called his own disciples. The Quran says:

John was a classical prophet, who was exalted high by God for his bold denouncing of all things sinful. Furthermore, the Quran speaks of John&#x27;s gentle piety and love and his humble attitude towards life, for which he was granted the Purity of Life:

John is also honored highly in Sufism as well as Islamic mysticism, primarily because of the Quran&#x27;s description of John&#x27;s chastity and kindness. Sufis have frequently applied commentaries on the passages on John in the Quran, primarily concerning the God-given gift of &quot;Wisdom&quot; which he acquired in youth as well as his parallels with Jesus. Although several phrases used to describe John and Jesus are virtually identical in the Quran, the manner in which they are expressed is different.

===Druze view===
Druze tradition honors several &quot;mentors&quot; and &quot;prophets&quot;, and John the Baptist is honored as a prophet. Druze venerate John the Baptist and he is considered a central figure in Druzism. Druze, like some Christians, believe that Elijah (al-Khidr) came back as John the Baptist, since they believe in reincarnation and the transmigration of the soul.

===Baháʼí view===
The Baháʼí Faith considers John to have been a prophet of God who like all other prophets was sent to instill the knowledge of God, promote unity among the people of the world, and to show people the correct way to live. There are numerous quotations in the writings of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, founder of the Baháʼí Faith, mentioning John the Baptist. He is regarded by Baháʼís as a lesser Prophet. Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh claimed that his forerunner, the Báb, was the spiritual return of John the Baptist. In his letter to Pope Pius IX, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh wrote:

John is believed to have had the specific role of foretelling and preparing the way for Jesus. In condemning those who had &#x27;turned aside&#x27; from him, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh compared them to the followers of John the Baptist, who, he said, &quot;protested against Him Who was the Spirit (Jesus) saying: &#x27;The dispensation of John hath not yet ended; wherefore hast thou come?&#x27;&quot; Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh believed that the Báb played the same role as John in preparing the people for his own coming. As such, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh refers to the Báb as &#x27;My Forerunner&#x27;, the Forerunner being a title that Christians reserve for John the Baptist. However, Baháʼís consider the Báb to be a greater Prophet (Manifestation of God) and thus possessed of a far greater station than John the Baptist.

==Scholarship==

Scholars studying John the Baptist&#x27;s relationship with Jesus of Nazareth have commented on the differences in their respective approaches.

James F. McGrath writes &quot;In the first half of the 20th century, the Mandaeans received significant attention from New Testament scholars who thought that their high view of John the Baptist might mean they were the descendants of his disciples. Many historians think that Jesus of Nazareth was a disciple of John the Baptist before breaking away to form his own movement, and I am inclined to agree.&quot;

L. Michael White says John the Baptist should be thought of &quot;...primarily as one who was calling for a return to an intensely Jewish piety [...] to follow the way of the Lord [...] to make oneself pure... to be right with God [...] And it seems to be that he calls for baptism as a sign of rededication or repurification of life in a typically Jewish way before God.&quot;

John Dominic Crossan sees John the Baptist as an apocalyptic eschatologist, whose message was that &quot;God, very soon, imminently, any moment, is going to descend to eradicate the evil of this world in a sort of an apocalyptic consummation...&quot; When Jesus says John is the greatest person ever born on earth, but the least in the Kingdom of God is greater than John, it means Jesus is changing his vision of God and the Kingdom of God from what he has taken from John. For Crossan, Jesus is an ethical eschatologist that sees &quot;...the demand that God is making on us, not us on God so much as God on us, to do something about the evil in the world.&quot;

Michael H. Crosby, O.F.M.Cap. states there was &quot;no biblical evidence indicating that John the Baptist ever became a disciple of Jesus.&quot; He believes that John&#x27;s concept of what a messiah should be was in contrast to how Jesus presented himself, and kept him from becoming a disciple of Jesus. Crosby states, &quot;an unbiased reading leaves us with the figure of John the Baptist as a reformist Jew who also may have wanted desperately to become a believer but was unable to become convinced of Jesus&#x27; messiahship...&quot; Crosby considers John&#x27;s effectiveness as a &quot;precursor&quot; in encouraging others to follow Jesus as very minimal, since the scriptures record only two of his own followers having become Jesus&#x27; disciples. Charles Croll points out that five of John&#x27;s disciples immediately followed Jesus, four of whom became apostles, one third of the twelve.

Professor Candida Moss noted that John and Jesus become &quot;de facto competitors in the ancient religious marketplace.&quot; Even after baptizing Jesus, John did not follow Jesus but maintained a separate ministry. After John&#x27;s death, Jesus&#x27; followers had to differentiate him from the executed prophet, &quot;countering the prevalent idea that Jesus was actually John raised from the dead.&quot; Moss also references the incident in Matthew 16 where disciples indicated some people believed Jesus was John the Baptist.

Pastor Robert L. Deffinbaugh views John&#x27;s sending two of his disciples to ask Jesus if he were the Messiah or whether another should be sought as the Baptist&#x27;s issuing a public challenge since the message was presented to Jesus while he was with a gathered crowd. Deffinbaugh suggests that John might have been looking for inauguration of the kingdom of God in a more dramatic way than what Jesus was presenting, as John had previously warned that the &quot;Messiah would come with fire.&quot; Jesus answered by indicating his miracle works and teachings which themselves gave evidence of his identity: &quot;The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor&quot;. Charles Croll counters this view, suggesting that John had realised that his time of preparing the way was over and he was saying to Jesus that he now had to testify himself that he was the Coming One. Jesus&#x27; affirmative yet indirect response was two fold, first by pointing out that he was doing the work expected of the Messiah, referencing his commissioning text in Isaiah. Secondly, he affirmed John&#x27;s ministry and message by identifying him as the unshakeable prophet of Malachi 3:1, who was among the greatest people who have ever lived and was not one to bend in the wind (Luke 7:18-35).

Harold W. Attridge agrees with Crossan that John was an apocalyptic preacher. Attridge says most contemporary scholars would see the idea of John as the &quot;forerunner&quot; of Jesus as a construct developed by the early church to help explain the relationship between the two. &quot;For the early church it would have been something of an embarrassment to say that Jesus, who was in their minds superior to John the Baptist, had been baptized by him, and thereby proclaimed some sort of subordination to him, some sort of disciple relationship to him...&quot;

Barbara Thiering questions the dating of the Dead Sea Scrolls and suggests that the Teacher of Righteousness (leader of the Essenes) preached coming fiery judgment, said &quot;the axe is laid to the roots of the tree&quot;, called people &quot;vipers&quot;, practised baptism and lived in the wilderness of Judea. Due to these reasons, she believes there is a strong possibility that the Teacher of Righteousness was John the Baptist. Charles Croll points out that the similarities are very superficial and there are many substantial differences between John the Baptist and the Qumran sect.

==In art==
===Early Christian art===
The earliest depictions of St John are found in the &quot;Baptism of Christ&quot;, one of the earliest scenes from the &quot;Life of Christ&quot; to be frequently depicted in Early Christian art, and John&#x27;s tall, thin, even gaunt, and bearded figure is already established by the 5th century. Only he and Jesus are consistently shown with long hair from Early Christian times, when the apostles generally have trim classical cuts; in fact John is more consistently depicted in this way than Jesus.

===Byzantine and Eastern Orthodox art===

In Byzantine and later Eastern Orthodox art, John the Baptist and the Holy Virgin Mary often flank Jesus on either side. The composition of the &quot;Deesis&quot; came to be included in every Eastern Orthodox church, as remains the case to this day. Here John and the Theotokos (Mary the &quot;God-bearer&quot;) flank a Christ Pantocrator and intercede for humanity.

In Orthodox icons, he often has angel&#x27;s wings, since Mark 1:2 describes him as a messenger.

===Western art===
After the earliest images showing the Baptism of the Lord follow ones with St John shown as an ascetic wearing camel hair, with a staff and scroll inscribed (in Western art) , or bearing a book or dish with a lamb on it.

The Baptist is very often shown on altarpieces designed for churches dedicated to him, where the donor was named for him or where there was some other patronage connection. John the Baptist is the patron saint of Florence and has often been depicted in the art of that city, and also frequently appears in baptistries, which are very often dedicated to him. Major works depicting St John the Baptist can be found in the Florence Baptistery, including the mosaics on the vault, the bronze doors by Andrea Pisano, and the great silver altar now in the Museo dell&#x27;Opera del Duomo.

A number of narrative scenes from his life were often shown on the predella of altarpieces dedicated to John, and other settings, notably in the frescoes by Giotto for the in the church of Santa Croce, the large series in grisaille fresco in the Chiostro dello Scalzo, which was Andrea del Sarto&#x27;s largest work, and the frescoed &quot;Life&quot; by Domenico Ghirlandaio in the Tornabuoni Chapel, all in Florence. There is another important fresco cycle by Filippo Lippi in Prato Cathedral. These include the typical scenes: the Annunciation to Zechariah; John&#x27;s birth; his naming by his father; the Visitation; John&#x27;s departure for the desert; his preaching in the desert; the Baptism of Christ; John before Herod; the dance of Herod&#x27;s stepdaughter, Salome; his beheading; and the daughter of Herodias Salome carrying his head on a platter.

His birth, which unlike the Nativity of Jesus allowed a relatively wealthy domestic interior to be shown, became increasingly popular as a subject in the late Middle Ages, with depictions by Jan van Eyck in the Turin-Milan Hours and Ghirlandaio in the Tornabuoni Chapel being among the best known. His execution, a church feast-day, was often shown, and by the 15th century scenes such as the dance of Salome became popular; sometimes, as in an engraving by Israhel van Meckenem, the interest of the artist is clearly in showing the life of Herod&#x27;s court, given contemporary dress, as much as the martyrdom of the saint. The execution was usually by a swordsman, with John kneeling in prayer, Salome often standing by with an empty platter, and Herod and Herodias at table in a cut-through view of a building in the background.
Salome bearing John&#x27;s head on a platter equally became a subject for the Power of Women group: a Northern Renaissance fashion for images of glamorous but dangerous women (Delilah, Judith and others). It was often painted by Lucas Cranach the Elder and engraved by the Little Masters. When the head is brought to the table by Salome, Herod may be shown as startled, if not disgusted, but Herodias is usually not. These images remained popular into the Baroque, with Carlo Dolci painting at least three versions. John preaching, in a landscape setting, was a popular subject in Dutch art from Pieter Brueghel the Elder and his successors. The isolated motif of the severed head, often on its platter, was a frequent image, often in sculpture, from the late Middle Ages onwards, known as (Latin for &quot;John on a plate&quot;).

As a child (of varying age), he is sometimes shown from the 15th century in family scenes from the life of Christ such as the Holy Family, the Presentation of Christ, the Marriage of the Virgin and the Holy Kinship. In the Baptism of Christ his presence was obligatory. Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s two versions of the &quot;Virgin of the Rocks&quot; were influential in establishing a Renaissance fashion for variations on the Madonna and Child which included John. Raphael in particular painted many compositions of the subject, such as the &quot;Alba Madonna&quot;, , the &quot;Garvagh Madonna&quot;, the , and the , which are among his best-known works.

John was also often shown by himself as an adolescent or adult, usually already wearing his distinctive dress and carrying a long thin wooden cross – another theme influenced by Leonardo, whose equivocal composition, with the camel-skin dress, was developed by Raphael, Titian and Guido Reni among many others. Often he is accompanied by a lamb, especially in the many Early Netherlandish paintings which needed this attribute as he wore normal clothes, or a red robe over a not very clearly indicated camel skin. Caravaggio painted an especially large number of works depicting John, from at least five largely nude youths attributed to him, to three late works on his death – the great &quot;Execution&quot; in Malta, and two sombre Salomes with his head, one in Madrid, and one in London.
Amiens Cathedral, which holds one of the alleged heads of the Baptist, has a biographical sequence in polychrome relief, dating from the 16th century. This includes the execution and the disposal of the saint&#x27;s remains, which according to legend were burnt in the reign of Julian the Apostate (4th century) to prevent pilgrimages.

A remarkable Pre-Raphaelite portrayal is &quot;Christ in the House of His Parents&quot; by John Everett Millais. Here the Baptist is shown as a child, wearing a loin covering of animal skins, hurrying into Joseph&#x27;s carpenter shop with a bowl of water to join Mary, Joseph, and Mary&#x27;s mother Anne in soothing the injured hand of Jesus. Artistic interest enjoyed a considerable revival at the end of the 19th century with Symbolist painters such as Gustave Moreau and Puvis de Chavannes (National Gallery, London). Oscar Wilde&#x27;s play &quot;Salome&quot; was illustrated by Aubrey Beardsley, giving rise to some of his most memorable images.

===In poetry===
The Italian Renaissance poet Lucrezia Tornabuoni chose John the Baptist as one of the biblical figures on which she wrote poetry.

He is also referenced in &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot; by T.S. Eliot in stanza 12.

===In music===
* Guido D&#x27;Arezzo (991/992 – after 1033) an Italian Benedictine monk founded the standard music stave based on a hymn to Saint John the Baptist.

* In his song &quot;Everyman Needs a Companion&quot;, the closing track to his album &quot;Fear Fun&quot;, Father John Misty sings about the friendship between John the Baptist and Jesus of Nazareth: &quot;John the Baptist took Jesus Christ/Down to the river on a Friday night/They talked about Mary like a couple of boys/With nothing to lose/Too scared to try.&quot;

===In film and television===
John the Baptist has appeared in a number of screen adaptations of the life of Jesus. Actors who have played John include James D. Ainsley in &quot;From the Manger to the Cross&quot; (1912), Nigel De Brulier in &quot;Salome&quot; (1923), Alan Badel in &quot;Salome&quot; (1953), Robert Ryan in &quot;King of Kings&quot; (1961), Mario Socrate in &quot;The Gospel According to St. Matthew&quot; (1964), Charlton Heston in &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965), David Haskell in &quot;Godspell&quot; (1973), Michael York in &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (1977), Eli Cohen in &quot;Jesus&quot; (1979), Andre Gregory in &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1988), Christopher Routh in &quot;Mary, Mother of Jesus&quot; (1999), David O&#x27;Hara in &quot;Jesus&quot; (1999), Scott Handy in &quot;The Gospel of John&quot; (2003), Aidan McArdle in &quot;Judas&quot; (2004), Daniel Percival in &quot;Son of God&quot; (2014), Abhin Galeya in &quot;Killing Jesus&quot; (2015), and David Amito in &quot;The Chosen&quot; (2019-2022).

==Commemoration==
===Denominational festivals===
Christian festivals associated with Saint John the Baptist and Forerunner are celebrated at various days by different denominations and are dedicated to his conception, birth, and death, as well as in correlation to the baptism of Jesus. The Eastern Church has feast days for the finding of his head (first, second, and third finding), as well as for his parents, Elizabeth and Zechariah. In the Russian Orthodox Church there is a feast day of the Transfer of the Right Hand of the Forerunner from Malta to Gatchina.

===Association with summer solstice===
The Feast of the nativity of Saint John closely coincides with the June solstice, also referred to as Midsummer in the Northern Hemisphere. The Christian holy day is fixed at 24 June; but in most countries festivities are mostly held the night before, on Saint John&#x27;s Eve. &quot;In England, &#x27;Saint John&#x27;s Tide&#x27; is combined with a midsummer celebration. Instead of the date of the summer solstice, they chose June 24. This may be because of the Baptist&#x27;s own words, &#x27;He must increase, but I must decrease&#x27; (John 3:30). John was, of course, referring to Jesus. John&#x27;s day comes at the time when the sun is beginning to decrease...&quot;

===Patron saint and local festivals===
====Middle East====
Saint John the Baptist&#x27;s beheading is said to have taken place in Machaerus, in central Jordan.

====Europe====
In Spain, Saint John was venerated during the feast of the Alhansara in Granada, and also in Gaztelugatxe

In the United Kingdom, Saint John is the patron of Penzance, Cornwall. In Scotland, he is the patron saint of Perth, which used to be known as St. John&#x27;s Toun of Perth. The main church in the city is still the medieval Kirk of St. John the Baptist and the city&#x27;s professional football club is called St Johnstone F.C.

Also, on the night of 23 June on to the 24th, Saint John is celebrated as the patron saint of Porto, the second largest city in Portugal. An article from June 2004 in &quot;The Guardian&quot; remarked that &quot;Porto&#x27;s is one of Europe&#x27;s liveliest street festivals, yet it is relatively unknown outside the country&quot;.

As patron saint of the original Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John, he is the patron of the Knights Hospitaller of Jerusalem, Malta, Florence, Cesena, Turin and Genoa, Italy; as well as of Malta as a whole and of Xewkija and Gozo in Malta, which remember him with a great feast on the Sunday nearest to 24 June.

====Americas====
Saint John the Baptist is the patron saint of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and its capital city, San Juan. In 1521, the island was given its formal name, , following the custom of christening a town with its formal name and the name which Christopher Columbus had originally given the island. The names and were eventually used in reference to both city and island, leading to a reversal in terminology by most inhabitants largely due to a cartographic error. By 1746, the city&#x27;s name () had become that of the entire island, while the name for the island () had become that of the city. The official motto of Puerto Rico also references the saint: .

He is also a patron saint of French Canada and Newfoundland. The Canadian cities of St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland (1497), Saint John, New Brunswick (1604), and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec (1665), were all named in his honor. His feast day of 24 June is celebrated officially in Quebec as the and was previously celebrated in Newfoundland as Discovery Day.

He is also patron of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Charleston, which covers the whole of South Carolina in the United States.

====Southeast Asia====
Calamba, Laguna, Calumpit, Bulacan, Balayan, and Lian in Batangas, Sipocot, and San Fernando in Camarines Sur, Daet, Camarines Norte, San Juan, Metro Manila, Tabuelan, Cebu, Jimenez, Misamis Occidental, Badiangan, Banate, Dingle, Igbaras, and Sara in Iloilo and the oldest in Taytay Rizal are among several places in the Philippines that venerate John as the town or city patron. A common practise of many Filipino fiestas in his honour is bathing and the dousing of people in memory of John&#x27;s iconic act. The custom is similar in form to Songkran and Holi, and serves as a playful respite from the intense tropical heat. While famed for the Black Nazarene it enshrines, Quiapo Church in Manila is actually dedicated to Saint John.

===Orders and societies===
A number of religious orders who include or have included in their name a mention of John the Baptist have been called Baptistines.

John the Baptist is the name-giving patron of the Knights Hospitaller, or also called Knights of Saint John.

Along with John the Evangelist, John the Baptist is claimed as a patron saint by the fraternal society of Freemasons.

<text>John Kilian Houston Brunner (24 September 1934 – 25 August 1995) was a British author of science fiction novels and stories. His 1968 novel &quot;Stand on Zanzibar&quot;, about an overpopulated world, won the 1969 Hugo Award for best science fiction novel and the BSFA Award the same year. &quot;The Jagged Orbit&quot; won the BSFA Award in 1970.

==Life==
Brunner was born in 1934 in Preston Crowmarsh, near Wallingford in Oxfordshire, and went to school at St Andrew&#x27;s Prep School, Pangbourne. He did his upper studies at Cheltenham College. He wrote his first novel, &quot;Galactic Storm&quot;, at 17, and published it under the pen-name Gill Hunt. He did not start writing full-time until 1958, some years after his military service.

He served as an officer in the Royal Air Force from 1953 to 1955. He married Marjorie Rosamond Sauer on 12 July 1958.

Brunner had an uneasy relationship with British new wave writers, who often considered him too American in his settings and themes. He attempted to shift to a more mainstream readership in the early 1980s, without success. Before his death, most of his books had fallen out of print. Brunner accused publishers of a conspiracy against him, although he was known to be difficult to deal with. His wife, Marjorie Brunner, had handled his publishing relations before she died.

Brunner&#x27;s health began to decline in the 1980s and worsened with the death of his wife in 1986. He remarried, to Li Yi Tan, on 27 September 1991. He died of a heart attack in Glasgow on 25 August 1995, while attending the World Science Fiction Convention there.

==Literary works==
At first writing conventional space opera, Brunner later began to experiment with the novel form. His 1968 novel &quot;Stand on Zanzibar&quot; exploits the fragmented organizational style that American writer John Dos Passos created for his &quot;U.S.A.&quot; trilogy, but updates it in terms of the theory of media popularised by Canadian academic Marshall McLuhan, a major cultural figure of the period.

&quot;The Jagged Orbit&quot; (1969) is set in a United States dominated by weapons proliferation and interracial violence. Its 100 numbered chapters vary in length from a single syllable to several pages. &quot;The Sheep Look Up&quot; (1972) depicts ecological catastrophe in America.

Brunner is credited with coining the term &quot;worm&quot; (in computing) and predicting the emergence of computer viruses in his 1975 novel &quot;The Shockwave Rider&quot;, in which he used the term to describe software that reproduces itself across a computer network. Brunner&#x27;s work has also been credited for prefiguring modern developments such as genetic engineering, same-sex marriage, online encyclopedias, the legalization of cannabis, and the development of Viagra.

These four novels &quot;Stand on Zanzibar&quot; (1968), &quot;The Jagged Orbit&quot; (1969), &quot;The Sheep Look Up&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Shockwave Rider&quot; (1975), have been called the &quot;Club of Rome Quartet&quot;, named after the Club of Rome, whose 1972 report &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot; warned of the dire effects of overpopulation.

Brunner&#x27;s pen names include K. H. Brunner (Kilian Houston Brunner), Gill Hunt, John Loxmith, Trevor Staines, Ellis Quick, Henry Crosstrees Jr., and Keith Woodcott.

In addition to his fiction, Brunner wrote poetry and published many unpaid articles in a variety of venues, particularly fanzines. He also published 13 letters to the &quot;New Scientist&quot; and an article about the educational relevance of science fiction in &quot;Physics Education&quot;. Brunner was an active member of the organisation Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and wrote the words to &quot;The H-Bomb&#x27;s Thunder&quot;, which was sung on the Aldermaston Marches. He was a linguist, translator, and Guest of Honour at the first European Science Fiction Convention &quot;Eurocon-1&quot; in Trieste in 1972.

==Film and TV==
Brunner wrote the screenplay for the science fiction film &quot;The Terrornauts&quot; (1967) by Amicus Productions.

Two of his short stories, &quot;Some Lapse of Time&quot; and &quot;The Last Lonely Man&quot;, were adapted as TV plays in the BBC science fiction series &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot;, in series 1 (1965) and series 3 (1969), respectively.

<text>Jack Butler Yeats RHA (29 August 1871 – 28 March 1957) was an Irish artist. Born into a family of impoverished Anglo-Irish landholders, his father was the painter John Butler Yeats, and his brother was the poet W. B. Yeats. Jack B. was born in London but was raised in County Sligo with his maternal grandparents, before returning to London in 1887 to live with his parents. Afterwards he travelled frequently between the two countries; while in Ireland he lived mainly in Greystones, County Wicklow and in Dublin city. 

Butlers&#x27; first solo exhibition &quot;Sketches of Life in the West of Ireland&quot; was held in 1898. He began as an illustrator and watercolourist until moving to oil paint around 1906. His early pictures are lyrical depictions of landscapes and figures predominantly from the west of Ireland. His early oil paintings are heavily influenced by Romanticism, before he adopted Expressionism c. 1910, for which he became famous.

He died in Dublin in 1957, aged 85 years. The National Gallery of Ireland holds a significant collection of his paintings, as well as his personal archive.

==Early life==
Yeats was born in London, England. He was the youngest son of the Irish portraitist John Butler Yeats and the brother of W. B. Yeats (William Butler), who received the 1923 Nobel Prize in Literature. He grew up in Sligo with his maternal grandparents, before returning to his parents&#x27; home in London in 1887. Yeats attended the Chiswick School of Art with his sisters Elizabeth and Susan, learning &quot;Freehand drawing in all its branches, practical Geometry and perspective, pottery and tile painting, design for decorative purposes – as in Wall-papers, Furniture, Metalwork, Stained Glass&quot;.
Early in his career, Yeats worked as an illustrator for magazines like the &quot;Boy&#x27;s Own Paper&quot; and &quot;Judy&quot;, drew comic strips, including the Sherlock Holmes parody &quot;Chubb-Lock Homes&quot; for &quot;Comic Cuts&quot;, and wrote articles for &quot;Punch&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;W. Bird&quot;. In 1894 he married Mary Cottenham White, a fellow student, also a native of England and two years his senior. At the 1911 Census they lived in Greystones in County Wicklow.

==Career==
From around 1920, he developed into an intensely Expressionist artist, moving from illustration to Symbolism. He was sympathetic to the Irish Republican cause, but not politically active. However, he believed that &#x27;a painter must be part of the land and of the life he paints&#x27;, and his own artistic development, as a Modernist and Expressionist, helped articulate a modern Dublin of the 20th century, partly by depicting specifically Irish subjects, but also by doing so in the light of universal themes such as the loneliness of the individual, and the universality of the plight of man. Samuel Beckett wrote that &quot;Yeats is with the great of our time... because he brings light, as only the great dare to bring light, to the issueless predicament of existence.&quot; The Marxist art critic and author John Berger also paid tribute to Yeats from a very different perspective, praising the artist as a &quot;great painter&quot; with a &quot;sense of the future, an awareness of the possibility of a world other than the one we know&quot;.

His favourite subjects included the Irish landscape, horses, circus and travelling players. His early paintings and drawings are distinguished by an energetic simplicity of line and colour, and his later paintings by an extremely vigorous and experimental treatment of often thickly applied paint. He frequently abandoned the brush altogether, applying paint in a variety of different ways, and was deeply interested in the expressive power of colour. Despite his position as the most important Irish artist of the 20th century (and the first to sell for over £1m), he took no pupils and allowed no one to watch him work, so he remains a unique figure. The artist closest to him in style is his friend, the Austrian painter Oskar Kokoschka.

In 1943, Yeats accepted Victor Waddington as his sole dealer and business manager. Waddington played a crucial role in building his career and reputation.

Besides painting, Yeats had a significant interest in theatre and in literature. He was a close friend of the playwright and novelist Samuel Beckett. He designed sets for the Abbey Theatre and three of his own plays were produced there. His literary works include &quot;The Careless Flower&quot;, &quot;The Amaranthers&quot; (much admired by Beckett), &quot;Ah Well, A Romance in Perpetuity&quot;, &quot;And To You Also&quot;, and &quot;The Charmed Life&quot;. Yeats&#x27;s paintings usually bear poetic and evocative titles. He was elected a member of the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1916. He died in Dublin in 1957, and was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery.

Yeats holds the distinction of being Ireland&#x27;s first medallist at the Olympic Games in the wake of the creation of the Irish Free State. At the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, Yeats&#x27; painting &quot;The Liffey Swim&quot; won a silver medal in the arts and culture segment of the Games. In the competition records the painting is simply entitled &quot;Swimming&quot;.

==Works==
In November 2010, one of Yeats&#x27;s works, &quot;A Horseman Enters a Town at Night&quot;, painted in 1948 and previously owned by novelist Graham Greene, sold for nearly £350,000 at a Christie&#x27;s auction in London. A smaller work, &quot;Man in a Room Thinking&quot;, painted in 1947, sold for £66,000 at the same auction. His painting &quot;Sleep Sound&quot; (1955) was bought by David Bowie in 1993 for £45,500 and sold at auction in 2016 for £233,000.

In 1999 the painting, &quot;The Wild Ones&quot;, sold at Sotheby&#x27;s in London for over £1.2m. Whyte&#x27;s Auctioneers hold the world record sale price for a Yeats painting, &quot;Reverie&quot; (1931), which sold for €1,400,000 in November 2019. The Model, Home of The Niland Collection, in Sligo cares for one of the best and most extensive collections of Jack B. Yeats&#x27;s work in existence. It presents regular curated exhibitions of his work, notably, The Outside in 2011, Enter the Clowns - The Circus as Metaphor, 2013; The Music has Come, 2014; Painted Universe, 2018; Salt Water Ballads, 2021.

<text>Joseph Elmer Yoakum (c. February 22, 1891 – December 25, 1972) was an American self-taught painter. He was of African-American and possibly of Native American–descent, and was known for his landscape paintings in the outsider art-style. He was age 76 when he started to record his memories in the form of imaginary landscapes and produced over 2,000 drawings during the last decade of his life.

==Early life==
Joseph Elmer Yoakum&#x27;s biographical information is difficult to verify but he also claimed to be of African, French, and Cherokee descent. New York Times critic Will Heinrich called his biography &quot;tricky...It’s poorly documented, and the artist himself was not a reliable narrator.&quot; His birthdates have also been given as 1886, 1888, and 1891, and his Veteran&#x27;s Administration record says he was born in Springfield, Missouri. A 9 year old Joe Yoakum does show up in the 1900 U.S. census in Greene County, Missouri, listed as Black with his father&#x27;s birthplace being listed as Indian Territory. His father John Yoakum is listed in the 1880 census as Black with his birthplace listed as Cherokee Nation.

Yoakum was born in Ash Grove, Missouri, but told a story of being born in Arizona, in 1888, as a Navajo Indian on the Window Rock Navajo reservation. Taking pride in his exaggerated Native heritage, Yoakum would pronounce &quot;Navajo&quot; as &quot;Na-va-JOE&quot; (as in &quot;Joseph&quot;). He spent his early childhood on a Missouri farm. 

Yoakum left home when he was nine years old to join the Great Wallace Circus. As a bill poster, he also traveled across the U.S. with Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show and the Ringling Brothers, among the five different circuses. He later traveled to Europe as a stowaway.

In 1908, he returned to Missouri and started a family with his girlfriend Myrtle Julian, with whom he had his first son in 1909; the couple married in 1910. Around 1916, he worked in a coal mine, Hale Coal and Mining to support his family. Yoakum was drafted into the United States Army in 1918 and worked in the 805th Pioneer Infantry repairing roads and railroads. After the war, he traveled around the United States, working odd jobs, but never returned to his family. He later remarried and moved to Chicago. In 1946, Yoakum was committed to a psychiatric hospital there. He soon left and by the early 1950s he was drawing on a regular basis.

==Artistic work==
Yoakum was again living and painting in Chicago by 1962. Tom Brand, owner of Galaxy Press on the south side of Chicago, in 1968 had some printing to deliver to a coffee shop called &quot;The Whole&quot;. While there he noticed the colored pencil drawings of Yoakum and was immediately taken by them. Brand had an account with the Ed Sherbyn Gallery on the north side of Chicago, and he persuaded Sherbyn to exhibit Yoakum&#x27;s works and even printed his own poster for this show. Norman Mark of &quot;The Chicago Daily News&quot; wrote an article about Yoakum called &quot;My drawings are a spiritual unfoldment&quot;; this article was printed on the back of the poster. Brand informed his artist friends (including Whitney Halstead) about Yoakum and encouraged them to visit &quot;The Whole&quot; coffee shop. Halstead, an artist and instructor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, became the greatest promoter of Yoakum&#x27;s work during his lifetime. He believed that his story was &quot;more invention than reality... in part myth, Yoakum&#x27;s life as he would have wished to have lived it.&quot;

In 1967, Yoakum was discovered by the mainstream art community through John Hopgood, an instructor at the Chicago State College, who saw Yoakum&#x27;s work hanging in his studio window and purchased twenty-two pictures. A group of students including Roger Brown, Gladys Nilsson, Jim Nutt, and Barbara Rossi, and teachers at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, including Ray Yoshida and Whitney Halstead, took an interest in promoting his work. In 1972, just one month before his death, Yoakum was given a one-man show at the Whitney Museum in New York City.

He started drawing familiar places, such as &quot;Green Valley Ashville Kentucky&quot;, as a method to capture his memories. However, he shifted towards imaginary landscapes in places he had never visited, like &quot;Mt Cloubelle of West India&quot; or &quot;Mt Mowbullan in Dividing Range near Brisbane Australia&quot;. Drawing outlines with ballpoint pen, rarely making corrections, he colored his drawings within the lines using watercolors and pastels. He became known for his organic forms, always using two lines to designate land masses.

During the final four months of his life Yoakum&#x27;s work was marked by a use of pure abstraction, as in his illustration &quot;Flooding of Sock River through Ash Grove Mo [Missouri] on July 4, 1914 in that [waters] drove many persons from Homes I were with the Groupe their homes for safety&quot;. That painting was one of his autobiographical works.

In 2018–19 Yoakum&#x27;s work was included in the exhibition &quot;Outliers and American Vanguard Art&quot; at the National Gallery of Art, High Museum of Art, and Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Following this event, Venus Over Manhattan presented an exhibition featuring more than sixty works on paper, which constituted the largest collection of Yoakum’s art assembled in New York since 1972. In 2021, the Museum of Modern Art presented more than 100 of his works in an exhibition called &quot;Joseph E. Yoakum: What I Saw.&quot; It was organized by the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Menil Drawing Institute, which is part of the Menil Collection. His work is represented in the National Gallery of Art, among other institutions.

<text>Jefferson F. Davis (June 3, 1808December 6, 1889) was an American politician who served as the only president of the Confederate States from 1861 to 1865. He represented Mississippi in the United States Senate and the House of Representatives as a member of the Democratic Party before the American Civil War. He was the United States Secretary of War from 1853 to 1857.

Davis, the youngest of ten children, was born in Fairview, Kentucky, but spent most of his childhood in Wilkinson County, Mississippi. His eldest brother Joseph Emory Davis secured the younger Davis&#x27;s appointment to the United States Military Academy. Upon graduating, he served six years as a lieutenant in the United States Army. After leaving the army in 1835, Davis married Sarah Knox Taylor, daughter of general and future President Zachary Taylor. Sarah died from malaria three months after the wedding. Davis became a cotton planter, building Brierfield Plantation in Mississippi on his brother Joseph&#x27;s land and eventually owning as many as 113 slaves.

In 1845, Davis married Varina Howell. During the same year, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives, serving for one year. From 1846 to 1847, he fought in the Mexican–American War as the colonel of a volunteer regiment. He was appointed to the United States Senate in 1847, resigning to unsuccessfully run as governor of Mississippi. In 1853, President Franklin Pierce appointed him Secretary of War. After Pierce&#x27;s administration ended in 1857, Davis returned to the Senate. He resigned in 1861 when Mississippi seceded from the United States.

During the Civil War, Davis guided the Confederacy&#x27;s policies and served as its commander in chief. When the Confederacy was defeated in 1865, Davis was captured, arrested for alleged complicity in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, accused of treason, and imprisoned at Fort Monroe. He was released without trial after two years. Immediately after the war, Davis was often blamed for the Confederacy&#x27;s defeat, but after his release from prison, the Lost Cause of the Confederacy movement considered him to be a hero. In the late 19th and the 20th centuries, his legacy as Confederate leader was celebrated in the South. In the twenty-first century, his leadership of the Confederacy has been seen as constituting treason, and he has been frequently criticized as a supporter of slavery and racism. Many of the memorials dedicated to him throughout the United States have been removed.

==Early life==
===Birth and family background===
Jefferson F. Davis was the youngest of ten children of Jane and Samuel Emory Davis. Samuel Davis&#x27;s father, Evan, who had a Welsh background, came to the colony of Georgia from Philadelphia. Samuel served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, and received a land grant for his service near present-day Washington, Georgia. He married Jane Cook, a woman of Scots-Irish descent whom he had met in South Carolina during his military service, in 1783. Around 1793, Samuel and Jane moved to Kentucky. Jefferson was born on June 3, 1808, at the family homestead in Davisburg, a village Samuel had established that later became Fairview, Kentucky. He was named after then-President Thomas Jefferson.

===Early education===
In 1810, the Davis family moved to Bayou Teche, Louisiana. Less than a year later, they moved to a farm near Woodville, Mississippi, where Samuel cultivated cotton, acquired twelve slaves, and built a house that Jane called Rosemont. During the War of 1812, three of Davis&#x27;s brothers served in the military. When Davis was around five, he received a rudimentary education at a small schoolhouse near Woodville. When he was about eight, his father sent him with Major Thomas Hinds and his relatives to attend Saint Thomas College, a Catholic preparatory school run by Dominicans near Springfield, Kentucky. In 1818, Davis returned to Mississippi, where he briefly studied at Jefferson College in Washington. He then attended the Wilkinson County Academy near Woodville for five years. In 1823, Davis attended Transylvania University in Lexington. While he was still in college in 1824, he learned that his father Samuel had died. Before his death, Samuel had fallen into debt and sold Rosemont and most of his slaves to his eldest son Joseph Emory Davis, who already owned a large estate in Davis Bend, Mississippi, about south of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Joseph, who was 23 years older than Davis, informally became his surrogate father.

===West Point and early military career===
His older brother Joseph got Davis appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1824, where he became friends with classmates Albert Sidney Johnston and Leonidas Polk. Davis frequently challenged the academy&#x27;s discipline. In his first year, he was court-martialed for drinking at a nearby tavern. He was found guilty but was pardoned. The following year, he was placed under house arrest for his role in the Eggnog Riot during Christmas 1826 but was not dismissed. He graduated 23rd in a class of 33.

Second Lieutenant Davis was assigned to the 1st Infantry Regiment. He was accompanied by his personal servant James Pemberton, an enslaved African American whom he inherited from his father. In early 1829, he was stationed at Forts Crawford and Winnebago in Michigan Territory under the command of Colonel Zachary Taylor, who later became president of the United States.

Throughout his life, Davis regularly suffered from ill health. During the northern winters, he had pneumonia, colds, and bronchitis. He went to Mississippi on furlough in March 1832, missing the outbreak of the Black Hawk War, and returned to duty just before the Battle of Bad Axe, which ended the war. When Black Hawk was captured, Davis escorted him for detention in St. Louis. Black Hawk stated that Davis treated him with kindness.

After Davis&#x27;s return to Fort Crawford in January 1833, he and Taylor&#x27;s daughter, Sarah, became romantically involved. Davis asked Taylor if he could marry Sarah, but Taylor refused. In spring, Taylor had him assigned to the United States Regiment of Dragoons under Colonel Henry Dodge. He was promoted to first lieutenant and deployed at Fort Gibson in Arkansas Territory. In February 1835, Davis was court-martialed for insubordination. He was acquitted. He requested a furlough, and immediately after it ended, he tendered his resignation, which was effective on June 30.

==Planting career and first marriage==

Davis decided to become a cotton planter. He returned to Mississippi where his brother Joseph had developed Davis Bend into Hurricane Plantation, which eventually had of cultivated fields with over 300 slaves. Joseph loaned him funds to buy ten slaves and provided him with , though Joseph retained the title to the property. Davis named his section Brierfield Plantation.

Davis continued his correspondence with Sarah, and they agreed to marry with Taylor giving his reluctant assent. They married at Beechland on June 17, 1835. In August, he and Sarah traveled to Locust Grove Plantation, his sister Anna Smith&#x27;s home in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana. Within days, both became severely ill with malaria. Sarah died at the age of 21 on September 15, 1835, after only three months of marriage.

For several years after Sarah&#x27;s death, Davis spent much of his time developing Brierfield. In 1836, he possessed 23 slaves; by 1840, he possessed 40; and by 1860, 113. He made his first slave, James Pemberton, Brierfield&#x27;s effective overseer, a position Pemberton held until his death around 1850. Davis continued his intellectual development by reading about politics, law and economics at the large library Joseph and his wife, Eliza, maintained at Hurricane Plantation. Around this time, Davis became increasingly engaged in politics, benefiting from his brother&#x27;s mentorship and political influence.

==Early political career and second marriage==

Davis became publicly involved in politics in 1840 when he attended a Democratic Party meeting in Vicksburg and served as a delegate to the party&#x27;s state convention in Jackson; he served again in 1842. One week before the state election in November 1843, he was chosen to be the Democratic candidate for the Mississippi House of Representatives for Warren County when the original candidate withdrew his nomination, though Davis lost the election.

In early 1844, Davis was chosen to serve as a delegate to the state convention again. On his way to Jackson, he met Varina Banks Howell, the 18-year-old daughter of William Burr Howell and Margaret Kempe Howell, when he delivered an invitation from Joseph for her to visit the Hurricane Plantation for the Christmas season. At the convention, Davis was selected as one of Mississippi&#x27;s six presidential electors for the 1844 presidential election.

Within a month of their meeting, 35-year-old Davis and Varina became engaged despite her parents&#x27; initial concerns about his age and politics. During the remainder of the year, Davis campaigned for the Democratic party, advocating for the nomination of John C. Calhoun. He preferred Calhoun because he championed Southern interests including the annexation of Texas, reduction of tariffs, and building naval defenses in southern ports. When the party chose James K. Polk for their presidential candidate, Davis campaigned for him.

Davis and Varina married on February 26, 1845. They had six children: Samuel Emory, born in 1852, who died of an undiagnosed disease two years later; Margaret Howell, born in 1855, who married, raised a family and lived to be 54; Jefferson Davis Jr., born in 1857, who died of yellow fever at age 21; Joseph Evan, born 1859, who died from an accidental fall at age five; William Howell, born 1861, who died of diphtheria at age 10; and Varina Anne, born 1864, who remained single and lived to be 34.

In July 1845, Davis became a candidate for the United States House of Representatives. He ran on a platform emphasizing a strict constructionist view of the constitution, states&#x27; rights, tariff reductions, and opposition to a national bank. He won the election and entered the 29th Congress. Davis opposed using federal monies for internal improvements, which he believed would undermine the autonomy of the states. He supported the American annexation of Oregon, but through peaceful compromise with Britain. On May 11, 1846, he voted for war with Mexico.

==Mexican–American War==

At the beginning of the Mexican–American War, Mississippi raised a volunteer unit, the First Mississippi Regiment, for the U.S. Army. Davis expressed his interest in joining the regiment if he was elected its colonel, and in the second round of elections in June 1846 he was chosen. He did not give up his position as a U.S. Representative, but left a letter of resignation with his brother Joseph to submit when he thought it was appropriate.

Davis was able to get his regiment armed with new percussion rifles instead of the smoothbore muskets used by other units. President Polk approved their purchase as a political favor in return for Davis marshalling enough votes to pass the Walker Tariff. Because of its association with the regiment, the weapon became known as the &quot;Mississippi rifle&quot;, and the regiment became known as the &quot;Mississippi Rifles&quot;.

Davis&#x27;s regiment was assigned to the army of his former father-in-law, Zachary Taylor, in northeastern Mexico. Davis distinguished himself at the Battle of Monterrey in September by leading a charge that took the fort of La Teneria. He then went on a two-month leave and returned to Mississippi, where he learned that Joseph had submitted Davis&#x27;s resignation from the House of Representatives in October. Davis returned to Mexico and fought in the Battle of Buena Vista on February 22, 1847. He was wounded in the heel during the fighting, but his actions stopped an attack by the Mexican forces that threatened to collapse the American line. In May, Polk offered him a federal commission as a brigadier general. Davis declined the appointment, arguing he could not directly command militia units because the U.S. Constitution gives the power of appointing militia officers to the states, not the federal government. Instead, he accepted an appointment by Mississippi governor Albert G. Brown to fill a vacancy in the U.S. Senate left when Jesse Speight died.

==Senator and Secretary of War==
===Senator===

Davis took his seat in December 1847 and was made a regent of the Smithsonian Institution. The Mississippi state legislature confirmed his appointment as senator in January 1848. He quickly established himself as an advocate of expanding slavery into the Western territories. He argued that because the territories were the common property of all the United States and lacked state sovereignty to ban slavery, slave owners had the equal right to settle them as any other citizens. Davis tried to amend the Oregon Bill to allow settlers to bring their slaves into Oregon Territory. He opposed ratifying the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the Mexican–American War, claiming that Nicholas Trist, who negotiated the treaty, had done so as a private citizen and not a government representative. Instead, he advocated negotiating a new treaty ceding additional land to the United States, and opposed the application of the Wilmot Proviso to the treaty, which would have banned slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico.

During the 1848 presidential election, Davis chose not to campaign against Zachary Taylor, who was the Whig candidate. After the Senate session following Taylor&#x27;s inauguration ended in March 1849, Davis returned to Brierfield. He was reelected by the state legislature for another six-year term in the Senate. Around this time, he was approached by the Venezuelan adventurer Narciso López to lead a filibuster expedition to liberate Cuba from Spain. He turned down the offer, saying it was inconsistent with his duty as a senator.

When Calhoun died in the spring of 1850, Davis became the senatorial spokesperson for the South. The Congress debated Henry Clay&#x27;s resolutions, which sought to address the sectional and territorial problems of the nation and became the basis for the Compromise of 1850. Davis was against the resolutions because he felt they would put the South at a political disadvantage. He opposed the admission of California as a free state without its first becoming a territory, asserting that a territorial government would give slaveowners the opportunity to colonize the region. He also tried to extend the Missouri Compromise Line to allow slavery to expand to the Pacific Ocean. He stated that not allowing slavery into the new territories denied the political equality of Southerners, and threatened to undermine the balance of power between Northern and Southern states in the Senate.

In the autumn of 1851, Davis was nominated to run for governor of Mississippi against Henry Stuart Foote, who had favored the Compromise of 1850. He accepted the nomination and resigned from the Senate, but Foote won the election by a slim margin. Davis turned down a reappointment to his Senate seat by outgoing Governor James Whitfield, settling in Brierfield for the next fifteen months. He remained politically active, attending the Democratic convention in January 1852 and campaigning for Democratic candidates Franklin Pierce and William R. King during the presidential election of 1852.

===Secretary of War===
In March 1853, President Franklin Pierce named Davis his Secretary of War. He championed a transcontinental railroad to the Pacific Ocean, arguing it was needed for national defense, and was entrusted with overseeing the Pacific Railroad Surveys to determine which of four possible routes was the best. He promoted the Gadsden Purchase of today&#x27;s southern Arizona from Mexico, partly because he preferred a southern route for the new railroad. The Pierce administration agreed and the land was purchased in December 1853. He presented the surveys&#x27; findings in 1855, but they failed to clarify the best route and sectional problems prevented any choice being made. Davis also argued for the acquisition of Cuba from Spain, seeing it as an opportunity to add the island, a strategic military location and potential slave state. He suggested that the size of the regular army was too small and that its salaries were too meagre. Congress agreed and authorized four new regiments and increased its pay scale. He ended the manufacture of smoothbore muskets and shifted production to rifles, working to develop the tactics that accompany them. He oversaw the building of public works in Washington D.C., including the initial construction of the Washington Aqueduct.

Davis assisted in the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854 by allowing President Pierce to endorse it before it came up for a vote. This bill, which created Kansas and Nebraska territories, repealed the Missouri Compromise&#x27;s limits on slavery and left the decision about a territory&#x27;s slaveholding status to popular sovereignty, which allowed the territory&#x27;s residents to decide. The passage of this bill led to the demise of the Whig party, which had tried to limit expansion of slavery in the territories. It also contributed to the rise of the Republican Party and the increase of civil violence in Kansas.

The Democratic nomination for the 1856 presidential election went to James Buchanan. Knowing his term was over when the Pierce administration ended in 1857, Davis ran for the Senate once more and re-entered it on March 4, 1857. In the same month, the United States Supreme Court decided the Dred Scott case, which ruled that slavery could not be barred from any territory.

===Return to Senate===

The Senate recessed in March and did not reconvene until November 1857. The session opened with a debate on the Lecompton Constitution submitted by a convention in Kansas Territory. If approved, it would have allowed Kansas to be admitted as a slave state. Davis supported it, but it was not accepted, in part because the leading Democrat in the North, Stephen Douglas, argued it did not represent the true will of the settlers in the territory. The controversy undermined the alliance between Northern and Southern Democrats.

Davis&#x27;s participation in the Senate was interrupted in early 1858 by a recurring case of iritis, which threatened the loss of his left eye. It left him bedridden for seven weeks. He spent the summer of 1858 in Portland, Maine recovering, and gave speeches in Maine, Boston, and New York, emphasizing the common heritage of all Americans and the importance of the constitution for defining the nation. His speeches angered some states&#x27; rights supporters in the South, requiring him to clarify his comments when he returned to Mississippi. Davis said that he appreciated the benefits of Union, but acknowledged that it could be dissolved if states&#x27; rights were violated or one section of the country imposed its will on another. Speaking to the Mississippi Legislature on November 16, 1858, Davis stated &quot;if an Abolitionist be chosen President of the United States... I should deem it your duty to provide for your safety outside of a Union with those who have already shown the will...to deprive you of your birthright and to reduce you to worse than the colonial dependence of your fathers.&quot;

In February 1860, Davis presented a series of resolutions defining the relationship between the states under the constitution, including the assertion that Americans had a constitutional right to bring slaves into territories. These resolutions were seen as setting the agenda for the Democratic Party nomination, ensuring that Douglas&#x27;s idea of popular sovereignty, known as the Freeport Doctrine, would be excluded from the party platform. The Democratic party split—Douglas was nominated by the North and Vice President John C. Breckinridge was nominated by the South—and the Republican Party nominee Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 presidential election. Davis counselled moderation after the election, but South Carolina adopted an ordinance of secession on December 20, 1860. Mississippi seceded on January 9, 1861, though Davis stayed in Washington until he received official notification on January 21. Calling it &quot;the saddest day of my life&quot;, he delivered a farewell address, resigned from the Senate, and returned to Mississippi.

==President of the Confederate States==
=== Inauguration ===
Before his resignation, Davis had sent a telegraph to Mississippi Governor John J. Pettus informing him that he was available to serve the state. On January 27, 1861, Pettus appointed him a major general of Mississippi&#x27;s army. On February 9, Davis was unanimously elected to the provisional presidency of the Confederacy by a constitutional convention in Montgomery, Alabama including delegates from the six states that had seceded: South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Alabama. He was chosen because of his political prominence, his military reputation, and his moderate approach to secession, which Confederate leaders thought might persuade undecided Southerners to support their cause. He learned about his election the next day. Davis had been hoping for a military command, but he committed himself fully to his new role. Davis was inaugurated on February 18.

Davis formed his cabinet by choosing a member from each of the states of the Confederacy, including Texas which had recently seceded: Robert Toombs of Georgia for Secretary of State, Christopher Memminger of South Carolina for Secretary of the Treasury, LeRoy Walker of Alabama for Secretary of War, John Reagan of Texas for Postmaster General, Judah P. Benjamin of Louisiana for Attorney General, and Stephen Mallory of Florida for Secretary of the Navy. Davis stood in for Mississippi. During his presidency, Davis&#x27;s cabinet often changed; there were fourteen different appointees for the positions, including six secretaries of war. On November 6, 1861, Davis was elected president for a six-year term. He took office on February 22, 1862.

===Civil War===
As the Southern states seceded, state authorities took over most federal facilities without bloodshed. But four forts, including Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina, had not surrendered. Davis preferred to avoid a crisis because the Confederacy needed time to organize its resources. To ensure that no attack on Fort Sumter was launched without his command, Davis had appointed Brigadier General P. G. T. Beauregard to command all Confederate troops in the vicinity of Charleston, South Carolina. Davis sent a commission to Washington to negotiate the evacuation of the forts, but President of the United States Lincoln refused to meet with it.

When Lincoln informed Davis that he intended to reprovision Fort Sumter, Davis convened with the Confederate Congress on April 8 and gave orders to demand the immediate surrender of the fort or to reduce it. The commander of the fort, Major Robert Anderson, refused to surrender, and Beauregard began the attack on Fort Sumter early on April 12. After over thirty hours of bombardment, the fort surrendered. When Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to suppress the rebellion, four more states–Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas—joined the Confederacy. The American Civil War had begun.

====1861====

In addition to being the constitutional commander-in-chief of the Confederacy, Davis was operational military leader as the military departments reported directly to him. Many people, including Generals Joseph E. Johnston and Major General Leonidas Polk, thought he would direct the fighting, but he left that to his generals.

Major fighting in the East began when a Union army advanced into northern Virginia in July 1861. It was defeated at Manassas by two Confederate forces commanded by Beauregard and Joseph Johnston. After the battle, Davis had to manage disputes with the two generals, both of whom felt they did not get the recognition they deserved.

In the West, Davis had to address a problem caused by another general. Kentucky, which was leaning toward the Confederacy, had declared its neutrality. In September 1861, Polk violated the state&#x27;s neutrality by occupying Columbus, Kentucky. Secretary of War Walker ordered him to withdraw. Davis initially agreed with Walker, but changed his mind and allowed Polk to remain. The violation led Kentucky to request aid from the Union, effectively losing the state for the Confederacy. Walker resigned as secretary of war and was replaced by Judah P. Benjamin. Davis appointed General Albert Sidney Johnston, as commander of the Western Military Department that included much of Tennessee, Kentucky, western Mississippi, and Arkansas.

====1862====
In February 1862, the Confederate defenses in the West collapsed when Union forces captured Forts Henry, Donelson, and nearly half the troops in A. S. Johnston&#x27;s department. Within weeks, Kentucky, Nashville and Memphis were lost, as well as control of the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. The commanders responsible for the defeat were Brigadier Generals Gideon Pillow and John B. Floyd, political generals that Davis had been required to appoint. Davis gathered troops defending the Gulf Coast and concentrated them with A. S. Johnston&#x27;s remaining forces. Davis favored using this concentration in an offensive. Johnston attacked the Union forces at Shiloh in southwestern Tennessee on April 6. The attack failed, and Johnston was killed. General Beauregard took command, falling back to Corinth, Mississippi, and then to Tupelo, Mississippi. When Beauregard then put himself on leave, Davis replaced him with General Braxton Bragg.
On February 22, Davis was inaugurated as president. In his inaugural speech, he admitted that the South had suffered disasters, but called on the people of the Confederacy to renew their commitment. He replaced Secretary of War Benjamin, who had been scapegoated for the defeats, with George W. Randolph. Davis kept Benjamin in the cabinet, making him secretary of state to replace Hunter, who had stepped down. In March, Davis vetoed a bill to create a commander in chief for the army, but he selected General Robert E. Lee to be his military advisor. They formed a close relationship, and Davis relied on Lee for counsel until the end of the war.

In March, Union troops in the East began an amphibious attack on the Virginia Peninsula, 75 miles from the Confederate capital of Richmond. Davis and Lee wanted Joseph Johnston, who commanded the Confederate army near Richmond, to make a stand at Yorktown. Instead, Johnston withdrew from the peninsula without informing Davis. Davis reminded Johnston that it was his duty to not let Richmond fall. On May 31, 1862, Johnston engaged the Union army less than ten miles from Richmond at the Battle of Seven Pines, where he was wounded. Davis put Lee in command. Lee began the Seven Days Battles less than a month later, pushing the Union forces back down the peninsula and eventually forcing them to withdraw from Virginia. Lee beat back another army moving into Virginia at the Battle of Second Manassas in August 1862. Knowing Davis desired an offensive into the North, Lee invaded Maryland, but retreated back to Virginia after a bloody stalemate at Antietam in September. In December, Lee stopped another invasion of Virginia at the Battle of Fredericksburg.

In the West, Bragg shifted most of his available forces from Tupelo to Chattanooga in July 1862 for an offensive toward Kentucky. Davis approved, suggesting that an attack could win Kentucky for the Confederacy and regain Tennessee, but he did not create a unified command. He formed a new department independent of Bragg under Major General Edmund Kirby Smith at Knoxville, Tennessee. In August, both Bragg and Smith invaded Kentucky. Frankfort was briefly captured and a Confederate governor was inaugurated, but the attack collapsed, in part due to lack of coordination between the two generals. After a stalemate at the Battle of Perryville, Bragg and Smith retreated to Tennessee. In December, Bragg was defeated at the Battle of Stones River.

In response to the defeat and the lack of coordination, Davis reorganized the command in the West in November, combining the armies in Tennessee and Vicksburg into a department under the overall command of Joseph Johnston. Davis expected Johnston to relieve Bragg of his command, but Johnston refused. During this time, Secretary of War Randolph resigned because he felt Davis refused to give him the autonomy to do his job; Davis replaced him with James Seddon.

In the winter of 1862, Davis decided to join the Episcopal Church; in May 1863, he was confirmed at St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Richmond.

====1863====

On January 1, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. Davis saw this as attempt to destroy the South by inciting its enslaved people to revolt, declaring the proclamation &quot;the most execrable measure recorded in the history of guilty man&quot;. He requested a law that Union officers captured in Confederate states be delivered to state authorities and put on trial for inciting slave rebellion. In response, the Congress passed a law that Union officers of United States Colored Troops could be tried and executed, though none were during the war. The law also stated that captured black soldiers would be turned over to the states they were captured in to be dealt with as the state saw fit.

In May, Lee broke up another invasion of Virginia at the Battle of Chancellorsville, and countered with an invasion into Pennsylvania. Davis approved, thinking that a victory in Union territory could gain recognition of Confederate independence, but Lee&#x27;s army was defeated at the Battle of Gettysburg in July. After retreating to Virginia, Lee blocked any major Union offensives into the state.

In April, Union forces resumed their attack on Vicksburg. Davis concentrated troops from across the south to counter the move, but Joseph Johnston did not stop the Union forces. Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton withdrew his army into Vicksburg, and after a siege, surrendered on July 4. The loss of Vicksburg and Port Hudson, Louisiana, led to Union control of the Mississippi. Davis relieved Johnston of his department command. During the summer, Bragg&#x27;s army was maneuvered out of Chattanooga and fell back to Georgia. In September, Bragg defeated the Union army at the Battle of Chickamauga, driving it back to Chattanooga, which he put under siege. Davis visited Bragg to address leadership problems in his army. Davis acknowledged that Bragg did not have the confidence of his subordinates but kept him in command. In mid-November, the Union army counterattacked and Bragg&#x27;s forces retreated to northern Georgia. Bragg resigned his command; Davis replaced him with Joseph Johnston but retained Bragg as an informal chief of staff.

Davis had to address faltering civilian morale. In early spring, there were riots in Confederate cities as people began to suffer food shortages and price inflation. During one riot in Richmond, the mayor of Richmond called the militia when a mob protesting food shortages broke into shops. Davis went to the scene and addressed the protesters, reminding them of their patriotic duty and promising them that he would get food. He then ordered them to disperse or he would command the soldiers to open fire; they dispersed. In October, Davis went on a month-long journey to rally the Confederacy, giving public speeches across the south and meeting with civic and military leaders.

====1864–1865====

In his address to the Second Confederate Congress on May 2, 1864, Davis outlined his strategy of achieving Confederate independence by exhausting the Union will to fight: If the South could show it could not be subjugated, the North would elect a president who would make peace.

In early 1864, Davis encouraged Joseph E. Johnston to take action in Tennessee, but Johnston refused. In May, the Union armies advanced toward Johnston&#x27;s army, which repeatedly retreated toward Atlanta, Georgia. In July, Davis replaced Johnston with General John B. Hood, who immediately engaged the Union forces in a series of battles around Atlanta. The battles did not stop the Union army and Hood abandoned the city on September 2. The victory raised Northern morale and assured Lincoln&#x27;s reelection. The Union forces then marched to Savannah, Georgia, capturing it. In December, they advanced into South Carolina, forcing the Confederates to evacuate Charleston. In the meantime, Hood advanced north and was repulsed in a drive toward Nashville in December 1864.

Union forces began a new advance into northern Virginia. Lee put up a strong defense and they were unable to directly advance on Richmond, but managed to cross the James River. In June 1864, Lee fought the Union armies to a standstill; both sides settled into trench warfare around Petersburg, which would continue for nine months.

Davis signed a Congressional resolution in February making Lee general-in-chief. Seddon resigned as Secretary of War and was replaced by John C. Breckinridge. Davis sent envoys to Hampton Roads for peace talks, but Lincoln refused to consider any offer that included an independent Confederacy. Davis also sent Duncan F. Kenner, the chief Confederate diplomat, on a mission to Great Britain and France, offering to gradually emancipate the enslaved people of the South for political recognition.

Major General Patrick Cleburne sent a proposal in early 1864 to Davis to enlist African Americans in the army. Davis initially suppressed it, but by the end of the year, he reconsidered and endorsed the idea. Congress passed an act supporting him. It left the principle of slavery intact by leaving it to the states and individual owners to decide which slaves could be used for military service, but Davis&#x27;s administration accepted only African Americans who had been freed by their masters as a condition of their being enlisted. The act came too late to have an effect on the war.

====End of the Confederacy and capture====

The Union army broke through the Confederate trench lines at the end of March, forcing Lee to withdraw and abandon Richmond, Virginia. Davis evacuated his family, which included Jim Limber, a free black orphan they briefly adopted, on March 29. On April 2, Davis and his cabinet escaped by rail to Danville, Virginia. He issued a proclamation on April 4, encouraging the people of the Confederacy to continue resistance, but Lee surrendered at Appomattox Courthouse on April 9. The president and his cabinet headed to Greensboro, North Carolina where they met with Joseph Johnston, Beauregard, and North Carolina Governor Zebulon Vance. Davis wanted to cross the Mississippi River and continue the war, but his generals stated that they did not have the forces. He gave Johnston authorization to negotiate the surrender of his army, but Davis headed south to carry on the fight.

When Lincoln was assassinated on April 14, the Union government implicated Davis, and a bounty of $100,000 () was put on his head. On May 2, Davis met with Secretary of War Breckinridge and Bragg in Abbeville, Georgia, to see if they could pull together an army. They said they could not. On May 5, he met with the remainder of his cabinet in Washington, Georgia, and officially dissolved the Confederate government. He moved on, hoping to join Kirby Smith&#x27;s army across the Mississippi. On May 9, Union soldiers found Davis&#x27;s encampment near Irwinville, Georgia. He tried to evade them, but was captured wearing a loose-sleeved cloak and covering his head with a black shawl, which gave rise to depictions of him in political cartoons fleeing in women&#x27;s clothes.

===Civil War policies===
====National policy====

Davis&#x27;s central concern during the war was to achieve Confederate independence. After Virginia seceded, the provisional government of the Confederacy moved the capital to Richmond. The Confederate federal government had almost no institutional structures in place, lacking an army, navy, treasury, diplomatic missions, and bureaucracy. Davis had to work with the Confederate Congress quickly to create them.

Though Davis supported states&#x27; rights, he believed the Confederate constitution empowered him with the right to centralize authority to prosecute the war. He worked with the Congress to bring military facilities in the South, which had been controlled by the states, under Confederate authority. Confederate governors wanted their states&#x27; militia available for local defense. Davis knew he needed to deploy military forces to defend the Confederacy as a whole and created a centralized army that could enlist volunteers directly. When soldiers in the volunteer army seemed unwilling to re-enlist in 1862, Davis instituted the first conscription in American history. He received authorization from Congress to suspend the writ of habeas corpus when needed. In 1864, he challenged property rights by recommending a direct 5% tax on land and slaves, and implemented the impressment of supplies and slave labor for the military effort. In 1865, Davis&#x27;s commitment to independence led him to even compromise slavery when he advocated for allowing African Americans to earn their freedom by serving in the military. These policies made him unpopular with states&#x27; rights advocates and state governors, who saw him as creating the same kind of government they had seceded from.

====Foreign policy====

The main objective of Davis&#x27;s foreign policy was to achieve foreign recognition, allowing the Confederacy to secure international loans, receive foreign aid to open trade, and provide the possibility of a military alliance. Davis was confident that most European nations&#x27; economic dependence on cotton from the South would quickly convince them to sign treaties with the Confederacy. Cotton had made up 61% of the value of all U.S. exports and the South filled most of the European cloth industry&#x27;s need for cheap imported raw cotton.

There was no consensus on how to use cotton to gain European support. Davis did not want an embargo on cotton, he wanted to make cotton available to European nations, but require them to acquire it by violating the blockade declared by the Union. The majority of Congress wanted an embargo to coerce Europe to help the South. Though there was no official policy, cotton was effectively embargoed. By 1862, the price of cotton in Europe had quadrupled and European imports of cotton from the United States were down 96%, but instead of joining with the Confederacy, European cotton manufacturers found new sources, such as India, Egypt and Brazil. By the end of the war, not a single foreign nation had recognized the Confederate States of America.

====Financial policy====

Davis did not take executive action to create the needed financial structure for the Confederacy. He knew very little about public finance, largely deferring to Secretary of the Treasury Memminger. Memminger&#x27;s knowledge of economics was limited, and he was ineffective at getting Congress to listen to his suggestions. Until 1863, Davis&#x27;s reports on the financial state of the Confederacy to Congress tended to be unduly optimistic.

Davis&#x27;s failure to argue for needed financial reform allowed Congress to avoid unpopular economic measures, such as taxing planters&#x27; property—both land and slaves—that made up two-thirds of the South&#x27;s wealth. At first the government thought it could raise money with a low export tax on cotton, but the blockade prevented this. In his opening address to the fourth session of Congress in December 1863, Davis demanded the Congress pass a direct tax on property despite the constitution. Congress complied, but the tax had too many loopholes and exceptions, and failed to produce the needed revenue. Throughout the existence of the Confederacy, taxes accounted for only one-fourteenth of the government&#x27;s income; consequently, the government printed money to fund the war, destroying the value of the Confederate currency. By 1865, the government was relying on impressments to fill the gaps caused by lack of finances.

==Imprisonment==

On May 22, Davis was imprisoned in Fort Monroe, Virginia, under the watch of Major General Nelson A. Miles. Initially, he was confined to a casemate, forced to wear fetters on his ankles, required to have guards constantly in his room, forbidden contact with his family, and given only a Bible and his prayerbook to read. Over time, his treatment improved: due to public outcry, the fetters were removed after five days; within two months, the guard was removed from his room, he could walk outside for exercise, and he was allowed to read newspapers and other books. In October, he was moved to better quarters. In April 1866, Varina was permitted to regularly visit him. In September, Miles was replaced by Brevet Brigadier General Henry S. Burton, who permitted Davis to live with Varina in a four-room apartment. In December, Pope Pius IX sent a photograph of himself to Davis.

President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s cabinet was unsure what to do with Davis. He had been arrested for complicity in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. The cabinet considered trying him by military court for war crimes—his alleged involvement in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln or the mistreatment of Union prisoners of war at Andersonville Prison—but could not find any reliable evidence directly linking Davis to either. In late summer 1865, Attorney General James Speed determined that it was best to try Davis for treason in a civil criminal trial. In June 1866, the House of Representatives passed a resolution by a vote of 105 to 19 to put Davis on trial for treason. Davis also desired a trial to vindicate his actions. His defense lawyer, Charles O&#x27;Conor wanted to argue that Davis did not commit treason because he was no longer a citizen of the United States when Mississippi left the United States. but because the trial was to be held in Richmond, Union prosecutors worried a jury might sympathize with Davis and acquit him in an act of jury nullification that would be interpreted as validating the constitutionality of secession.
After two years of imprisonment, Davis was released at Richmond on May 13, 1867, on bail of $100,000 (~$ in ), which was posted by prominent citizens including Horace Greeley, Cornelius Vanderbilt and Gerrit Smith. Davis and Varina went to Montreal, Quebec, to join their children who had been sent there while he was in prison, and they moved to Lennoxville, Quebec. Davis remained under indictment until after Johnson&#x27;s proclamation on Christmas 1868 granting amnesty and pardon to all participants in the rebellion. Davis&#x27;s case never went to trial. In February 1869, Attorney General William Evarts informed the court that the federal government declared it was no longer prosecuting the charges against him.

==Later years==
===Seeking a livelihood===
Despite his financial situation after his prison release, Davis refused work that he perceived as diminishing his status as a former senator and president. He turned down a position as head of Randolph–Macon College in Virginia because he did not want to damage the school&#x27;s reputation while he was under indictment. In the summer of 1869, he traveled to Britain and France, but found no business opportunities there. When the federal government dropped its case against him, Davis left his family in England and returned to the U.S. in October 1869 to become president of the Carolina Life Insurance Company in Tennessee. On his arrival to Tennessee, the University of the South offered him their top position, but he declined because the salary was insufficient. Davis was not able to retrieve his family from England until August 1870.
Davis received numerous invitations to speak during this time, declining most. In 1870, he delivered a eulogy to Robert E. Lee at the Lee Monument Association in Richmond in which he avoided politics and emphasized Lee&#x27;s character. Davis&#x27;s 1873 speech to the Virginia Historical Society was more political; he stated that the South would not have surrendered had it known what to expect from Reconstruction, particularly the enfranchisement of African Americans. He became a life-time member of the Southern Historical Society, which was devoted to presenting the Lost Cause explanation of the Civil War. Initially, the society had scapegoated political leaders like Davis for losing the war, but eventually shifted the blame for defeat to the former Confederate general James Longstreet. Davis avoided public disputes regarding blame, but consistently maintained he had done nothing wrong and had always upheld the Constitution.

The Panic of 1873 adversely affected the Carolina Life Company, and Davis resigned in August 1873 when the directors merged the company over his objections. He went to Europe again in 1874 to seek opportunities to earn money, but was still not able to find any. After returning to the United States in 1874, Davis continued to explore ways to make a living, including investments in railroads, mining, and manufacturing an ice-making machine. In 1876, he was offered the presidency of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas. He declined because Varina also did not want to live in Texas, recommending Thomas S. Gathright instead. He worked for an English company, the Mississippi Valley Society, to promote trade and European immigration. When he and Varina went to Europe again in 1876, he determined the company was failing. He returned to the United States while Varina stayed in England.

Davis sought to reclaim Brierfield as well. After the war, Davis Bend had been taken over by the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, which employed former enslaved African Americans as laborers. After Davis&#x27;s elder brother, Joseph, successfully applied for a pardon, he regained ownership of Davis Bend. Unable to maintain it, Joseph gave his former slave Ben Montgomery and his sons, Isaiah and William, a mortgage loan to buy the property. When Joseph died in 1870, he had made Davis one of his executors but did not deed any land to him in the will. Davis litigated to obtain Brierfield. A judge dismissed his suit in 1876. He appealed, and the Mississippi supreme court found in his favor in 1878. He foreclosed on the Montgomerys, who were in default on their mortgage. By December 1881, Brierfield was legally his, although he did not live there, and it did not produce a reliable income.

===Author===

In January 1877, the author Sarah Dorsey invited him to live on her estate at Beauvoir, Mississippi, and to begin writing his memoirs. He agreed, but insisted on paying board. At the time, Davis and Varina lived separately. When Varina came back to the United States, she initially refused to come to Beauvoir because she did not like Davis&#x27;s close relationship with Dorsey, who was serving as his amanuensis. In the summer of 1878, Varina relented, moving to Beauvoir and taking over the role of Davis&#x27;s assistant. Dorsey died in July 1879, and left Beauvoir to Davis in her will, and he lived there for most of his remaining years.

Davis&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government&quot;, was published in 1881. The book was intended as a vindication of Davis&#x27;s actions during the war and an argument for the righteousness of secession, though it downplayed slavery&#x27;s role as a cause of the war. James Redpath, editor of the &quot;North American Review&quot;, encouraged him to write a series of articles for the magazine and to complete his final book &quot;A Short History of the Confederate States of America&quot;. He also began dictating his memoirs, although they were never finished.

In 1886, Henry W. Grady, an advocate for the New South, convinced Davis to lay the cornerstone for a monument to the Confederate dead in Montgomery, Alabama, and to attend the unveilings of statues memorializing Davis&#x27;s friend Benjamin H. Hill in Savannah and the Revolutionary War hero Nathanael Greene in Atlanta. The tour was a triumph for Davis and got extensive newspaper coverage, which emphasized national unity and the South&#x27;s role as a permanent part of the United States. At each stop along the way, large crowds came out to cheer Davis, solidifying his image as an icon of the South and the Confederacy. In October 1887, Davis held his last tour, traveling to the Georgia State Fair in Macon, Georgia, for a grand reunion with Confederate veterans.

==Death==
In November 1889, Davis embarked on a steamboat in New Orleans in a cold rain, intending to visit his Brierfield plantation. He fell ill during the trip, but refused to send for a doctor. An employee sent a telegram to Varina, who came to get him. Davis was diagnosed with acute bronchitis complicated by malaria. When he returned to New Orleans, Davis&#x27;s doctor Stanford E. Chaille pronounced him too ill to travel further. He was taken to the home of Charles Erasmus Fenner, the son-in-law of his friend J. M. Payne, where he died at 12:45a.m. on Friday, December 6, 1889, in the presence of several friends and holding Varina&#x27;s hand.

===Funeral and reburial===

Davis&#x27;s body lay in state at the New Orleans City Hall from December 7 to 11. Davis&#x27;s funeral was one of the largest held in the South; over 200,000 mourners were estimated to have attended. The coffin was transported on a two-mile journey to the cemetery in a modified, four-wheeled caisson to emphasize his role as a military hero. Davis was buried according to the Episcopal rites and a brief eulogy was pronounced by Bishop John Nicholas Galleher.

After Davis&#x27;s funeral, various Southern states requested to be the final resting site for Davis&#x27;s remains. Varina decided that Davis should be buried in Richmond, which she saw as the appropriate resting place for dead Confederate heroes. She chose Hollywood Cemetery. In May 1893, Davis&#x27;s remains traveled from New Orleans to Richmond. Along the way, the train stopped at various cities, receiving military honors and visits from governors, and the coffin was allowed to lie in state in three state capitols: Montgomery, Alabama; Atlanta, Georgia; and Raleigh, North Carolina. When Davis was reburied, his children were reinterred on the site as Varina requested, and, when Varina died in 1906, she was buried beside him.

==Political views on slavery==

During his years as a senator, Davis was an advocate for the Southern states&#x27; right to slavery.
In an 1848 speech on the Oregon Bill, he argued for a strict constructionist understanding of the Constitution. He insisted that the states are sovereign, all powers of the federal government are granted by those states, the Constitution recognized the right of states to allow citizens to have slaves as property, and the federal government was obligated to defend encroachments upon this right. In his February 13–14, 1850 speech, Davis declared that slaveholders must be allowed to bring their slaves into federal territories. He stated that slavery does not need to be justified: it was sanctioned by religion and history. He claimed that African Americans were destined for bondage, and their enslavement was a civilizing blessing to them that brought economic and social good to everyone.

Davis&#x27;s speeches after secession acknowledged the relationship between the Confederacy and slavery. In his resignation speech to the Senate, delivered 12 days after his state seceded, he said Mississippi &quot;has heard proclaimed the theory that all men are created free and equal, and this made the basis of an attack upon her social institutions and the sacred Declaration of Independence has been invoked to maintain the position of the equality of the races.&quot; In his February 1861 inaugural speech as provisional president of the Confederacy, Davis asserted that the Confederate Constitution, which explicitly prevented Congress from passing any law affecting African American slavery and mandated its protection in all Confederate territories, was a return to the intent of the original founders. When he spoke to Congress in April on the ratification of the Constitution, he stated that the war was caused by Northerners whose desire to end slavery would destroy Southern property worth millions of dollars.&quot; In his 1863 address to the Confederate Congress, Davis denounced the Emancipation Proclamation as evidence of the North&#x27;s long-standing intention to abolish slavery and doom African Americans, whom he called an inferior race, to extermination.

==Performance as commander in chief==

Davis came to the role of commander in chief confident in his military abilities. He had graduated from West Point Military Academy, served in the regular army, and commanded troops in combat. He actively oversaw the military policy of the Confederacy and worked long hours attending to paperwork related to the organization, finance, and logistics needed to maintain the Confederate armies.

Some historians argue that Davis&#x27;s personality contributed to the defeat of the Confederacy. His constant attention to minor military details has been used to illustrate an inability to delegate, which led him to lose focus on larger issues. He has been accused of being a poor judge of generals: appointing people—such as Bragg, Pemberton, and Hood—–who failed to meet expectations, overly trusting long-time friends, and retaining generals—like Joseph Johnston—long after they should have been removed. His need to be seen as always in the right has also been described as a problem. Historians have argued that the time spent vindicating himself took time away from pressing problems and accomplished little. His reactions to criticism made unnecessary enemies and created hostile relationships with the politicians and generals he depended on. It has been argued that his focus on military victory at all costs undermined the values the South was fighting for, such as states&#x27; rights and slavery, but provided no alternatives to replace them.

Other historians have pointed out his strengths. Davis quickly mobilized the Confederacy despite the South&#x27;s focus on states&#x27; rights, and he stayed focused on gaining independence. He was a skilled orator who attempted to share the vision of national unity. He shared his message through newspapers, public speeches, and trips where he would meet with the public. His policies sustained the Confederate armies through numerous campaigns, buoying Southern hopes for victory and undermining the North&#x27;s will to continue the war. A few historians have argued that Davis may have been one of the best people available to serve as commander in chief. Though he was unable to win the war, he rose to the challenge of the presidency, pursuing a strategy that not only enabled the Confederacy to hold out as long as it did, but almost achieved its independence.

==Legacy==

Although Davis served the United States as a soldier and a war hero, a politician who sat in both houses of Congress, and a cabinet officer, his legacy is mainly defined by his role as president of the Confederacy. After the Civil War, journalist Edward A. Pollard, who first popularized the Lost Cause mythology, placed much of the blame for losing the war on Davis. Into the twentieth century, many biographers and historians have also emphasized Davis&#x27;s responsibility for the Confederacy&#x27;s failure to achieve independence. Since the second half of the twentieth century, this assumption has been questioned. Some scholars argued that he was a capable leader, while acknowledging his skills were insufficient to overcome the challenges the Confederacy faced and exploring how his limitations may have contributed to the war&#x27;s outcome.

Davis&#x27;s standing among white Southerners was at a low point at the end of the Civil War, but it rebounded after his release from prison. After Reconstruction, he became a venerated figure of the white South, and he was often depicted as a martyr who suffered for his nation. His birthday was made a legal holiday in six Southern states. His popularity among white Southerners remained strong in the early twentieth century. Around 200,000 people attended the unveiling of the Jefferson Davis Memorial at Richmond, Virginia, in 1907. Mississippi officials honored him with a life-size likeness in the National Statuary Hall at the U.S. Capitol in 1931. In 1961, a centennial celebration reenacted Davis&#x27;s inauguration in Montgomery, Alabama, with fireworks and a cast of thousands in period costumes. In the early twenty-first century, there were at least 144 Confederate memorials commemorating him throughout the United States.

On October 17, 1978, Davis&#x27;s U.S. citizenship was posthumously restored after the Senate passed Joint Resolution 16. President Jimmy Carter described it as an act of reconciliation reuniting the people of the United States and expressing the need to establish the nation&#x27;s founding principles for all. However, Davis&#x27;s legacy continued to spark controversy. In the twenty-first century, most historians agree that Davis&#x27;s participation in the Confederacy constituted treason. His memorials, such as the Jefferson Davis Highway, have been argued to legitimize the white supremacist, slaveholding ideology of the Confederacy, and a number have been removed, including his statues at the University of Texas at Austin, New Orleans, Memphis, Tennessee, and the Kentucky State Capitol in Frankfort. After the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, protesters toppled Davis&#x27;s statue on his Richmond monument along with the statues of other figures considered racists. As part of its initiative to dismantle Confederate monuments, the Richmond City Council funded the removal of the statue&#x27;s pedestal, which was completed in February 2022, and ownership of its artifacts was given to the Black History Museum and Cultural Center of Virginia.

<text>Jonathan Turner Meades (born 21 January 1947) is an English writer and film-maker. His work spans journalism, fiction, essays, memoir and over fifty television films, many for the BBC. 

He has described himself as a &quot;cardinal of atheism&quot; and is both an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society and a Patron of Humanists UK.

==Early life and education==
Jonathan Meades was born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, the only child of John William Meades, a biscuit company sales rep, and Margery Agnes Meades (&quot;née&quot; Hogg), a primary school teacher. The family lived in an &quot;unbelievably cramped&quot; terraced, thatched cottage in the East Harnham area of the city. Meades was educated until the age of 13 at the nearby Salisbury Cathedral School, within Salisbury Cathedral Close.

He discovered a fascination for place and the built environment whilst accompanying his father on sales trips during school holidays; he would be left unattended and free to explore while the elder Meades conducted his business with the grocer. This later developed into a full-blown passion for architecture following a visit to Edwin Lutyens&#x27; Marsh Court on a school cricket trip at the age of 13. He also developed an early love of France on the frequent trips which his family took there, made possible by his Francophile mother&#x27;s father, who worked for Southern Railway, the company which ran the Saint-Malo and Le Havre ferries.

In 1960 he was sent as a boarder to King&#x27;s College, Taunton, which he has described as &quot;a dim, backward, muscular Christian boot camp&quot;. He later &quot;walked out&quot; of the school and was sent instead to a crammer in London, where he lodged with the painter Vivien White, daughter of Augustus John.

After a year at the University of Bordeaux and unsure of what to do next, he decided to become an actor after a chance meeting with Charles Collingwood and trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) from 1966 to 1969. His contemporaries there included Robert Lindsay, David Bradley, Stephanie Beacham, Michael Kitchen and Richard Beckinsale. He later described it as a &quot;Sandhurst for chorus boys&quot; where students were &quot;martially drilled&quot;, teaching them the value of discipline, craft and technique.

Although he ultimately decided against joining the acting profession, the training which he received would prove essential in his later television career, as would his extra-curricular interest in French New Wave cinema, in particular the work of Jean-Pierre Melville and Alain Robbe-Grillet. His regular Sunday pastime of exploring the capital with his &quot;Pevsner Architectural Guide&quot; would also benefit him later. On leaving RADA, he was told by the Principal, Hugh Cruttwell, that he might as well abandon acting until he reached middle age, at which point he might become an interesting character actor. When the two met again decades later, after Meades had established himself on television, Cruttwell joked that he had not realised that the character would be called &quot;Jonathan Meades&quot;.

==Writing==
===Journalism===
Following a period as a freelance copywriter, Meades began writing for the literary magazine &quot;Books &amp; Bookmen&quot; in 1971, setting him on a career as a journalist and critic. In 1973 he reviewed a V&amp;A exhibition on Victorian architecture for the magazine, igniting a passion for the style and prompting him to explore even more of London than he had to date. Using the unlimited travel afforded by Red Rover bus passes, he rode on random buses for exactly 20 minutes and then got off, no matter where he was.

After leaving &quot;Books and Bookmen&quot; in 1975 he wrote for the sex education magazine &quot;Curious&quot; and joined the staff of &quot;Time Out&quot;, then became &quot;The Observer&quot;&#x27;s TV critic in 1977. This led to the publication of his first book, &quot;This Is Their Life&quot;, an A to Z of TV star biographies with an introduction by Mike Yarwood. He moved to &quot;Architects&#x27; Journal&quot; in 1979 and around this time worked on another book, &quot;The Illustrated Atlas of the World&#x27;s Great Buildings&quot;, with Philip Bagenal.

In 1981 he became the editor of Richard Branson&#x27;s short-lived listings magazine &quot;Event&quot;, then from 1982 was the features editor of &quot;Tatler&quot;. It was here that he first had the opportunity to write about food, filling in as restaurant critic after Julian Barnes resigned, using the pseudonym &quot;John Beaver&quot;. He was also invited to contribute to the bi-monthly restaurant magazine &quot;À la Carte&quot; around this time. In 1986 he was offered the job of restaurant critic at &quot;The Times&quot;, replacing comedy writer Stan Hey. Meades was a great success in this position, taking the job more seriously than his predecessor. He won Best Food Journalist at the 1986, 1990, 1996 and 1999 Glenfiddich Awards.

Despite his success, he often tired of the repetitive nature of the job and threatened to leave several times. The paper responded by increasing his salary. He finally quit around 2000, having been pronounced morbidly obese by his doctor: he had put on around five pounds per year, or one ounce per meal, during his tenure. He then managed to lose a third of his body weight over the course of the following twelve months, using a strict diet of protein and citrus. He remained with &quot;The Times&quot; as a columnist until 2005.

In the years since, he has done less journalism but has contributed essays and reviews to numerous publications including the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;.

===Books and other writing===
In 1982, &quot;Harpers &amp; Queen&quot; published three short stories which Meades had written about &quot;rural lowlife&quot;. These, along with four more, were collected in 1984 as &quot;Filthy English&quot;, his first volume of fiction. Andrew Billen of the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; later described them as &quot;bucolic horror stories&quot;. A few more stories appeared in his first anthology of journalism and essays, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Peter Knows What Dick Likes&quot;, the title of which is a reference to the supposed superiority of male-on-male fellatio.

He contributed to the screenplay of the 1992 French-Italian adventure film &quot;L&#x27;Atlantide&quot;, directed by Bob Swaim, and also wrote three unproduced screenplays in the 1980s and the 1990s: &quot;Millie&#x27;s Problem&quot; (1985), &quot;The Side I Dressed On&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Brute&#x27;s Price&quot; (1996).

His first novel, &quot;Pompey&quot;, was published in 1993. A dark, epic family saga centred around the titular city of Portsmouth, it was widely praised and favourably compared to Sterne, Scarfe, Steadman, Nabokov and Joyce, amongst other &quot;great stylists&quot;. On its 2013 reissue, Matthew Adams wrote in &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;Where his first collection of stories, &quot;Filthy English&quot;, achieved the distinction of covering in aggressively vivid prose the disciplines of murder, addiction, incest and bestial pornography, &quot;Pompey&quot; exhibits an even greater concentration of his aptitude for squalor ... by the end of the opening two pages, which must rank among the most startling affirmations of omniscience in 20th-century literature, the reader has met with an arresting injunction: &#x27;After using this book please wash your hands.

A second novel, &quot;The Fowler Family Business&quot;, followed in 2002. A tale of suburban sexual deceit in the funeral trade, it was described by the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; as &quot;hilarious and very black&quot;. An anthology of his food journalism, &quot;Incest and Morris Dancing: A Gastronomic Revolution&quot;, was published in the same year. In a 2010 interview with &quot;The Arts Desk&quot;, he discussed his work on a third novel.

An anthology of journalism, essays and TV scripts on the built environment, &quot;Museum Without Walls&quot;, was published by the crowdfunded imprint Unbound in 2012.

Meades&#x27; memoir of his childhood in the 1950s and early 1960s, &quot;An Encyclopaedia of Myself&quot;, was published in May 2014. It was long-listed for that year&#x27;s Samuel Johnson Prize and won Best Memoir in the Spear&#x27;s Book Awards 2014. Roger Lewis of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; said of the work that &quot;If this book is thought of less as a memoir than as a symphonic poem about post-war England and Englishness – well, then it is a masterpiece.&quot;

In 2015, the publisher and record label Test Centre released a spoken word vinyl album by Meades entitled &quot;Pedigree Mongrel&quot;, consisting of readings from &quot;Pompey&quot;, &quot;Museum Without Walls&quot;, &quot;An Encyclopaedia of Myself&quot; and unpublished fiction, combined with soundscapes created by Mordant Music. The sleeve of the album featured photography by Meades, including an abstract self-portrait on the front cover. Also in 2015, Meades, along with Laura Noble, contributed essays to Robert Clayton&#x27;s photographic collection &quot;Estate&quot;, which documented life on the soon-to-be-demolished Lion Farm housing estate in Oldbury, West Midlands in 1990.

A book of &quot;borrowed&quot; recipes, &quot;The Plagiarist in the Kitchen: A Lifetime&#x27;s Culinary Thefts&quot;, was published by Unbound in 2017. According to Meades, it is &quot;devoted to the idea that you shouldn&#x27;t try and invent anything in the kitchen, just rely on what has already been done ... I hate the idea of experimental cookery, but I like the idea of experimental literature.&quot;

&quot;Isle of Rust&quot;, a collaboration with the photographer Alex Boyd featuring text based on Meades&#x27; script for his 2009 film about Lewis and Harris, was published by Luath Press in 2019.

An anthology of uncollected writing from 1988 to 2020 entitled &quot;Pedro and Ricky Come Again&quot;, described as &quot;the best of three decades of Jonathan Meades&quot; and the sequel to &quot;Peter Knows What Dick Likes&quot;, was published by Unbound in March 2021.

==Television==
Meades&#x27; first foray into television was in 1985: a short film on the art and architecture of Barcelona for the BBC Two arts magazine programme &quot;Saturday Review&quot;. His first major project was the 1987 six-part Channel 4 architectural documentary series &quot;The Victorian House&quot;. This contained many stylistic similarities to his other work, but the producer of the series, John Marshall, received the sole writing credit and it was not a happy experience for Meades. He would be credited as the sole author of all his subsequent work.

His next series was &quot;Abroad in Britain&quot;, broadcast on BBC Two in 1990. It featured five irreverent, &quot;slightly bonkers&quot; films which explored unusual and neglected aspects of the built environment: informal plotland dwellings along the Severn Valley, nautical culture around the Solent and architectural forms associated with utopianism, bohemians and the military. Each episode was introduced by Meades as being &quot;devoted to the proposition that the exotic begins at home&quot;. The series was influenced by the work of architectural critic Ian Nairn and French New Wave film director Alain Robbe-Grillet, and it cemented Meades&#x27; uniquely incongruous on-screen persona: dark glasses, dark suits, inscrutable, didactic delivery and dense, mordant language peppered with gags and surreal interludes. Rachel Cooke of &quot;The Guardian&quot; later described his TV persona as &quot;pugnacious, sardonic and seemingly super-confident&quot;, while noting the RADA training and that it was &quot;not the real Jonathan Meades, who is an altogether more diffident and shy character ... except when drunk&quot;. The series spawned four sequels: &quot;Further Abroad&quot; (1994), &quot;Even Further Abroad&quot; (1997), &quot;Abroad Again in Britain&quot; (2005) and &quot;Abroad Again&quot; (2007), along with several other series and stand-alone films, the majority of which have been archived on the website &quot;MeadesShrine&quot;.

Preferring to be thought of as a performer rather than as a presenter, Meades has described his style as &quot;heavy entertainment&quot;; &quot;staged essays&quot; which seek to combine &quot;lecture hall&quot; and &quot;music hall&quot;, Geoffrey Hill and Benny Hill.

The 1998 film &quot;Heart By-Pass&quot; looked affectionately at Birmingham; particularly at how its architecture, transport system and ethnic mix have changed since the 1960s. It featured the music of many of the city&#x27;s best-known 1960s and 1970s rock bands such as The Moody Blues, The Move, Traffic, Black Sabbath, and ELO.

He made two films on the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner. The first, in 1998, was the Worcestershire episode of the series &quot;Travels with Pevsner&quot;, in which noted writers followed his guide books on particular counties. The second, in 2001, was a biography entitled &quot;Pevsner Revisited&quot;.

Meades made two other stand-alone films which aired earlier in 2001: &quot;Victoria Died in 1901 and is Still Alive Today&quot; examined the other-worldly legacy of Victorian architecture and culture one hundred years on, set to a soundtrack of late 1960s psychedelic rock by artists such as The Velvet Underground, The Kinks and Pink Floyd, while &quot;suRREAL FILM&quot; (or &quot;tvSSFBM EHKL&quot;, the letters of the title moved forwards then backwards) sought to expound on surrealism in a manner befitting the subject, and reflected on, &quot;inter alia&quot;, the fact that Meades had recently lost a considerable amount of weight. Both films featured the comic actor Christopher Biggins, notably as Queen Victoria herself, and were the first of Meades&#x27; films to be directed by Francis Hanly, who would go on to be his main collaborator, directing and shooting virtually all of his films from 2008 onwards.

A three-part series on food culture, &quot;Meades Eats&quot;, aired on BBC Four in 2003, again featuring Biggins and Hanly. The episodes dealt with fast food, the notion of a gastronomic revolution in the UK and with the ever-increasing influence of immigrant cuisines.

The 2008 two-part BBC Four film &quot;Jonathan Meades: Magnetic North&quot; celebrated the culture of Northern Europe, examining why the North suffers in the British popular imagination in comparison with the South. Meades travelled from the slag heaps of northern France to Belgian cities, the red-light district of Hamburg, Gdańsk, the Baltic States and finally Helsinki, musing on the architecture, food and art of the places he visited. Writing in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, James Walton praised the programme as &quot;Sparkling, thought-provoking, constantly challenging the accepted view, Meades seemed at times inspired, at others deranged. The only thing he never was, thank heaven, was obvious.&quot;

A 9-DVD box set collecting all of his BBC work to date was planned for release in April 2008, but was reduced to a 3-disc anthology due to the expense of licensing the music used in the programmes. Much of the carefully chosen popular music used in the original edits was replaced by library music, and the more music-dependent films such as &quot;Surreal Film&quot;, &quot;Victoria Died in 1901&quot; and &quot;Heart By-Pass&quot; were not included.

In 2009, Meades toured Scotland in a three-part BBC Four series entitled &quot;Jonathan Meades: Off Kilter&quot;. He visited Aberdeen, Lewis and Harris (the &#x27;Isle of Rust&#x27;) and the less-renowned footballing towns of south-west Fife, Clackmannanshire and Falkirk, guided by his foul-mouthed &#x27;ScotNav&#x27;.

In 2012, BBC Four screened &quot;Jonathan Meades on France&quot;, a series in which he explored his &quot;second country&quot;. The first episode, &quot;Fragments of an Arbitrary Encyclopaedia&quot;, focused on the Lorraine region, using a miscellany of words beginning with the letter V. The second episode, &quot;A Biased Anthology of Parisian Peripheries&quot;, focused on Frenchness and its major traits. The series concluded with &quot;Just a Few Debts France Owes to America&quot;.

The 2013 film &quot;The Joy of Essex&quot; examined that county&#x27;s little-known history of utopian communities.

A two-part series on Brutalist architecture, &quot;Bunkers, Brutalism and Bloodymindedness: Concrete Poetry&quot;, aired in 2014.

In a 2017 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Meades quoted his director, Francis Hanly, on how their production budgets had declined over the years: &quot;We used to be a convoy, now we are a Smart car&quot;. In a 2008 interview with &quot;The Independent&quot;, he indicated that the blame for this lay mostly with former BBC Two controller Jane Root.

&quot;Jonathan Meades on Jargon&quot; aired on BBC Four in May 2018. The BBC Four website described it as a &quot;provocative television essay&quot; which &quot;dissects politics, the law, football commentary, business, the arts, tabloid-speak and management consultancy to show how jargon is used to cover up, confuse and generally keep us in the dark&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described it as &quot;blisteringly brutal, clever and hilarious&quot;, while &quot;The Times&quot; also declared Meades to be &quot;on blistering form&quot;.

Over a period of 25 years, Meades has written and presented four films on the architectural legacy of 20th-century European dictators, the latest of which, &quot;Franco Building with Jonathan Meades&quot;, looking at Franco&#x27;s Spain, aired in August 2019. The previous instalments were &quot;Jerry Building&quot; (Nazi Germany, 1994), &quot;Joe Building&quot; (Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Soviet Union, 2006) and &quot;Ben Building&quot; (Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Italy, 2016).

==Photography==
Meades entered the world of photography with the 2013 collection &quot;Pidgin Snaps&quot;. Published by Unbound as a &quot;boxette&quot; of 100 postcards, it featured mostly abstract digital work. It was followed in April 2016 by an exhibition entitled &quot;Ape Forgets Medication: Treyfs and Artknacks&quot; at the Londonewcastle Project in Shoreditch, London. A second exhibition, &quot;After Medication: Random Treyfs and Artknacks&quot;, was held in October 2017 at 108 Fine Art, Harrogate.

==Personal life==
Meades has been married three times and has four daughters from his first two marriages. In 1980 he married Sally Brown, director of the British Theatre Association, and the couple had twins. His second wife was Frances Bentley, managing editor of &quot;Vogue&quot;, whom he married in 1988. They had two daughters and divorced in 1997. In 2003 he married his girlfriend Colette Forder, a colleague from &quot;The Times&quot;. In around 2007, the couple sold their penthouse flat on Tyers Gate, off Bermondsey Street, Southwark, where they had lived for 10 years, and moved to a converted mill near Bordeaux. Discovering that they found country life boring, they then moved to Marseille in around 2011, where they live in Le Corbusier&#x27;s apartment block.

During his time at RADA, he became friends with the painter Duggie Fields, whose flatmate was the former Pink Floyd singer, songwriter and guitarist Syd Barrett. He was also friendly with Aubrey &quot;Po&quot; Powell, co-founder of the graphic design company Hipgnosis, most famous for its Pink Floyd album covers. He has described himself as &quot;a hanger-on to the hangers-on&quot; around the band and has admitted to taking LSD three times, describing it as &quot;the only remotely interesting drug&quot;.

Meades was called &quot;the best amateur chef in the world&quot; by Marco Pierre White. He taught himself to cook as a young man using &quot;Mastering the Art of French Cooking&quot; (1961, 1970), by Simone Beck, Louisette Bertholle and Julia Child.

He is a football fan and supports Southampton F.C.

He has been a member of Soho&#x27;s Groucho and Academy clubs.

He won the first ever episode of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot;, broadcast in December 2002. His specialist subject was English Architecture, 1850–2002.

In the autumn of 2016, he was rushed to hospital and underwent five hours of cardiac surgery. Earlier in the year he had suffered from pleurisy and an embolism.

<text>Joe Pass (born Joseph Anthony Jacobi Passalacqua; January 13, 1929 – May 23, 1994) was an American jazz guitarist. Although Pass collaborated with pianist Oscar Peterson and vocalist Ella Fitzgerald, his status as one of the most notable jazz guitarists of the 20th century is generally attributed to his work on his solo albums, such as &quot;Virtuoso&quot;.

== Early life ==
Pass was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, on January 13, 1929. His father, Mariano Passalacqua, was a steel-mill worker who was born in Sicily. The family later moved to Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Although it is commonly believed that Pass became interested playing guitar after seeing Gene Autry perform in the Western film &quot;Ride, Tenderfoot, Ride&quot; (an account that had been given by Pass himself), Pass later stated he did not remember who or what inspired him to pursue music. 

Pass received his first guitar and started creating music when at age 9. Pass stated his first guitar was a Harmony, and that he had asked for a guitar for his birthday. He began playing for neighbors, and learned chords from his father&#x27;s Italian friends. He attended guitar lessons every Sunday with a local teacher for six to eight months and practiced for up to six hours per day, rapidly advancing in skill level. As he improved his craft, he participated in the local music scene of Johnstown, where he would enjoy the company of other guitarists and listen to the music that was being created. 

Pass was finding paying gigs at dances and weddings in Johnstown as early as age 14, playing with bands led by Tony Pastor and Charlie Barnet, honing his guitar skills while &quot;learning the ropes&quot; in the music industry. He began traveling with small jazz groups and moved from Pennsylvania to New York City. 

Pass would continue to perform with big bands until 1947, when he enlisted and served in the US military. 

Pass developed an addiction to heroin after his tenure in the military had ended. He lived in New Orleans for a year, playing bebop at strip clubs. Pass later revealed that he had suffered a &quot;nervous breakdown&quot; in New Orleans due to virtually unlimited access to drugs that enabled the musician to engage in severe benders. Pass recalled, &quot;I would come to New York a lot, then get strung out and leave.&quot; 

Pass spent much of the 1950s in and out of prison for drug-related convictions. Pass said, &quot;Staying high was my first priority; playing was second; girls were third. But the first thing really took all my energy.&quot; He recovered after a two-and-a-half-year stay in the Synanon rehabilitation program, largely putting his music on hold during his prison sentence.
== Career ==

Pass&#x27;s released his studio debut &quot;Sounds of Synanon&quot; on July 1, 1962.

Pass recorded and released a series of albums during the 1960s under Pacific Jazz Records, including &quot;Catch Me,&quot; &quot;12-String Guitar,&quot; &quot;For Django,&quot; and &quot;Simplicity.&quot; In 1963, he received &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine&#x27;s New Star Award. 
He also played on Pacific Jazz recordings by Gerald Wilson, Bud Shank, and Les McCann. Pass was a member of the George Shearing Quintet from 1965 through 1967. 

Throughout the 1960s, Pass primarily did TV and recording session work in Los Angeles, including performing in television orchestras. Norman Granz, the producer of Jazz at the Philharmonic and the founder of Verve Records, signed Pass to Pablo Records in December 1973. 

In December 1974, Pass released his solo album &quot;Virtuoso&quot; on Pablo. Also in 1974, Pablo released the album &quot;The Trio&quot; with Pass, Oscar Peterson, and Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen. He performed with them on many occasions throughout the 1970s and 1980s. At the Grammy Awards of 1975, &quot;The Trio&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Performance by a Group. As part of the Pablo roster, Pass recorded with Benny Carter, Milt Jackson, Herb Ellis, Zoot Sims, Duke Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald, and Count Basie.

Pass and Ella Fitzgerald recorded six albums together on Pablo toward the end of Fitzgerald&#x27;s career: &quot;Take Love Easy&quot; (1973), &quot;Fitzgerald and Pass... Again&quot; (1976), &quot;Hamburg Duets - 1976&quot; (1976), &quot;Sophisticated Lady&quot; (1975, 1983), &quot;Speak Love&quot; (1983), and &quot;Easy Living&quot; (1986).

== Later life and death ==
Pass was diagnosed with liver cancer in 1992. Although he was initially responsive to treatment and continued to play into 1993, his health eventually declined, forcing him to cancel his tour with Pepe Romero, Paco Peña, and Leo Kottke. Pass performed for the final time on May 7, 1994, with fellow guitarist John Pisano at a nightclub in Los Angeles. Pisano told &quot;Guitar Player&quot; that after the performance Pass said &quot;I can&#x27;t play anymore&quot;, an exchange that Pisano described as &quot;like a knife in my heart.&quot; Pass died from liver cancer in Los Angeles 16 days later, at the age of 65. Prior to his death, he recorded an album of Hank Williams songs with country guitarist Roy Clark.

Speaking about &quot;Nuages: Live at Yoshi&#x27;s, Volume 2,&quot; Jim Ferguson wrote:
The follow up to 1993&#x27;s &quot;Joe Pass &amp; Co. Live at Yoshi&#x27;s,&quot; this release was colored by sad circumstances: both bassist Monty Budwig and Pass were stricken with fatal illnesses. Nevertheless, all concerned, including drummer Colin Bailey and second guitarist John Pisano, play up to their usual high levels...Issued posthumously, this material is hardly sub-standard. Bristling with energy throughout, it helps document the final stages in the career of a player who, arguably, was the greatest mainstream guitarist since Wes Montgomery.

== Artistry ==
===Technique===
Pass&#x27;s playing style was particularly noted for his ability to simultaneously play melody, harmony and basslines at extremely high tempos. Pass&#x27;s single-note playing style is similar to the instrumental stylings of classic bebop and hard bop, drawing comparisons to the tones and timbres of wind instruments used in jazz music, such as the saxophone and trumpet, as well as other string instruments such as the piano. Jazz educator Wolf Marshall said Pass&#x27;s musical flavorings were &quot;hornlike and on par with his wealth of ideas and immense vocabulary, allowing single-note improvisations to flow like a saxophonist&#x27;s stream of consciousness.&quot; 

As Pass&#x27;s career progressed, he developed an increasingly harmonic approach to improvisation that made extensive use of chord-melody solos, which produced a similar effect to that of a piano. He also employed a variety of different picking techniques such as fingerpicking, hybrid picking and &quot;flat picking&quot;.

Pass&#x27;s style was also said to have exhibited a &quot;tougher funky aspect&quot; by incorporating string bends, double stops and partial chords that variously borrow from blues, R&amp;B and swing styles.

===Influences===
Throughout the 1940s, Pass became interested in modern jazz sounds that were emerging from New York City, where he would jam with many quintessential bebop musicians. Pass cited Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Art Tatum and Coleman Hawkins as influences during this time. Pass was later influenced by the piano stylings of Oscar Peterson. Ironically, only three of the various jazz musicians he had cited as influences on his playing were actually guitarists; he cited Charlie Christian, Django Reinhardt and Wes Montgomery as instrumental in his development as a musician.

==Equipment==
On Pass&#x27;s early recordings, he played Fender solid-body electric guitars, such as the Jaguar and Jazzmaster. Additionally, Pass experimented with a Fender Bass VI 6-string bass on his 1963 album &quot;Catch Me&quot;. In 1963, Pass was gifted a Gibson ES175D arch-top electric-acoustic guitar that had twin humbucking pickups.

== Legacy ==

&quot;New York&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;Joe Pass looks like somebody&#x27;s uncle and plays guitar like nobody&#x27;s business. He&#x27;s called &#x27;the world&#x27;s greatest&#x27; and often compared to Paganini for his virtuosity. There is a certain purity to his sound that makes him stand out easily from other first-rate jazz guitarists.&quot;

Veteran jazz writer Scott Yanow has conferred the titles of &quot;the ultimate bebop guitarist&quot;, &quot;the epitome of virtuoso guitarists&quot;, and &quot;one of the top jazz voices of his generation&quot; on Pass.

<text>Jazz guitar may refer to either a type of electric guitar or a guitar playing style in jazz, using electric amplification to increase the volume of acoustic guitars.

In the early 1930s, jazz musicians sought to amplify their sound to be heard over loud big bands. When guitarists in big bands switched from acoustic to semi-acoustic guitar and began using amplifiers, it enabled them to play solos. Jazz guitar had an important influence on jazz in the beginning of the twentieth century. Although the earliest guitars used in jazz were acoustic and acoustic guitars are still sometimes used in jazz, most jazz guitarists since the 1940s have performed on an electrically amplified guitar or electric guitar.

Traditionally, jazz electric guitarists use an archtop with a relatively broad hollow sound-box, violin-style f-holes, a &quot;floating bridge&quot;, and a magnetic pickup. Solid body guitars, mass-produced since the early 1950s, are also used.

Jazz guitar playing styles include &quot;comping&quot; with jazz chord voicings (and in some cases walking bass lines) and &quot;blowing&quot; (improvising) over jazz chord progressions with jazz-style phrasing and ornaments. Comping refers to playing chords underneath a song&#x27;s melody or another musician&#x27;s solo improvisations.

==History==

===1900–mid-1930s===
The stringed, chord-playing rhythm can be heard in groups which included military band-style instruments such as brass, saxes, clarinets, and drums, such as early jazz groups. As the acoustic guitar became a more popular instrument in the early 20th century, guitar-makers began building louder guitars which would be useful in a wider range of settings. Nick Lucas is regarded as the grandfather of Jazz Guitar, with two of his guitar compositions being the first guitar solos ever recorded in 1922. Lucas built the foundations for Jazz guitar through his development of various rhythmic, single string, and sweep picking techniques. 

The Gibson L5, an acoustic archtop guitar which was first produced in 1923, was an early “jazz”-style guitar which was used by early jazz guitarists such as Eddie Lang. By the 1930s, the guitar began to displace the banjo as the primary chordal rhythm instrument in jazz music, because the guitar could be used to voice chords of greater harmonic complexity, and it had a somewhat more muted tone that blended well with the upright bass, which, by this time, had almost completely replaced the tuba as the dominant bass instrument in jazz music.

===Late 1930s-1960s===
During the late 1930s and through the 1940s—the heyday of big band jazz and swing music—the guitar was an important rhythm section instrument. Some guitarists, such as Freddie Green of Count Basie&#x27;s band, developed a guitar-specific style of accompaniment. Few of the big bands, however, featured amplified guitar solos, which were done instead in the small combo context. The most important jazz guitar soloists of this period included the Manouche virtuoso Django Reinhardt, Oscar Moore who was featured with Nat “King” Cole&#x27;s trio, and Charlie Christian of Benny Goodman&#x27;s band and sextet, who was a major influence despite his early death at 25. Also noteworthy was Mike Danzi who performed with the Alex Hyde Orchestra in the United States as well as with several jazz orchestras throughout Germany during the 1930s. 

It was not until the large-scale emergence of small combo jazz in the post-WWII period that the guitar took off as a versatile instrument, which was used both in the rhythm section and as a featured melodic instrument and solo improviser. In the hands of George Barnes, Kenny Burrell, Herb Ellis, Barney Kessel, Jimmy Raney, and Tal Farlow, who had absorbed the language of bebop, the guitar began to be seen as a “serious” jazz instrument. Improved electric guitars such as Gibson&#x27;s ES-175 (released in 1949), gave players a larger variety of tonal options. In the 1940s through the 1960s, players such as Wes Montgomery, Joe Pass, Al Caiola Tony Mottola and Jim Hall laid the foundation of what is now known as &quot;jazz guitar&quot; playing.

===1970s===
As a result of the ubiquity of the guitar in rock and pop bands during the 1960s, jazz guitarists began to pursue rock-based styles and genres, radically changing the face of jazz guitar and developing the style of &quot;jazz fusion&quot;, which broke out of standard jazz idioms and explored rock, funk, and electronic music. As early as 1967, Larry Coryell and his band The Free Spirits recorded Out of Sight and Sound, a groundbreaking album that was one of the earliest examples of rock music being intepreted and played by jazz musicians. More prevalently, Miles Davis featured George Benson as a soloist on the track &quot;Paraphenilia&quot; off of his 1968 album Miles in the Sky, which marked the first example of his long-standing associations with guitarists. Shortly after this, he recruited John McLaughlin to play on In A Silent Way and Bitches Brew, some of the first jazz albums to be called &quot;fusion&quot; and the first serious jazz-rock albums. McLaughlin was a veteran of the British blues scene, and had cut his teeth playing with popular blues and rock groups, such as The Graham Bond Quartet, The Rolling Stones, and Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames. McLaughlin was an avowed fan of Jimi Hendrix, and utilized phrasing closer to that of blues and funk guitarists than stereotypical bebop phrasing, and even had a track off of Bitches Brew named after him. He also played with the Tony Williams Lifetime for two years, before departing, radically altering his approach, and founding a new band. Davis would continue experimenting with guitar-based music during the 1970s, spearheaded by experimental soloist Pete Cosey, and rhythm guitarists Reggie Lucas and, for some time, Dominique Gaumont. Cosey made heavy use of effects, including a synthesizer, as well as 10 string guitars and experimental tunings. His work and influence is recognized by several avant-garde guitarists, such as Television guitarist Tom Verlaine.

The Mahavishnu Orchestra, the resulting band, broke sigificant ground in both rock and jazz realms, and was headlined by McLaughlin&#x27;s newer, more experimental style. His guitar playing began to utilize bends, sustain, and distortion common to blues rock musicians, as well as a vocabulary heavily influenced by Hindustani and Carnatic styles of Indian classical music which had become popular in psychedelic rock. His aggression and virtuosity earned him and his band fame, and he became a dominant force in jazz guitar. Inspired by him, pianist Chick Corea reorganized his Latin jazz band Return to Forever into a guitar-led rock band, first with blues-based guitarist Bill Connors, then with young virtuoso Al Di Meola. Di Meola would also accrue much respect as a soloist, and influenced numerous rock and jazz guitarists after his time.

Many rock guitarists also began to utilize jazz vocabulary and jazz-based ideas, reflective of progessive rock&#x27;s convergent evolution with fusion jazz. Yes guitarists Peter Banks and Steve Howe had styles akin to that of many jazz guitarists early on, and helped define Yes&#x27;s sound apart from other bands. John Goodsall, guitarist for the seminal jazz-rock band Brand X, utilized a fusion guitar style in the context of a progressive rock sound. Most notably, though, was Allan Holdsworth, who played with numerous progessive rock groups and musicians(Soft Machine, Gong, Tempest, Bill Bruford, U.K.) before embarking on a decades-long solo career that saw him become of the most revered soloists in the guitar world. Rather than utilizing standard picking, Holdsworth relied on legato phrasing inspired by horn players like John Coltrane and wildly unique and extremely advanced harmonic ideas. Despite being an &quot;underground&quot; musician and getting very little commercial success, Holdsworth inspired several guitarists over the years, most particularly, Eddie Van Halen.

===1980s–2000s===
By the early 1980s, the radical experiments of early 1970s-era fusion gave way to a more radio-friendly sounds of smooth jazz. Guitarist Pat Metheny mixed the sounds of rock, blues, country, and “world” music, while still maintaining a strong foundation in bebop and cool jazz, playing both a flat-top acoustic guitar and an electric guitar with a softer, more mellow tone which was sweetened with a shimmering effect known as “chorusing&quot;. During the 1980s, a neo-traditional school of jazz sought to reconnect with the past. In keeping with such an aesthetic, young guitarists of this era sought a clean and round tone, and they often played traditional hollow-body arch-top guitars without electronic effects, frequently through vacuum tube amplifiers.

As players such as Bobby Broom, Peter Bernstein, Howard Alden, Russell Malone, and Mark Whitfield revived the sounds of traditional jazz guitar, there was also a resurgence of archtop luthierie (guitar-making). By the early 1990s many small independent luthiers began making archtop guitars. In the 2000s, jazz guitar playing continues to change. Some guitarists incorporate a Latin jazz influence, acid jazz-style dance club music uses samples from Wes Montgomery, and guitarists such as Bill Frisell continue to defy categorization.

Today, the jazz guitar continues to evolve, influenced by advancements in technology and the creative vision of contemporary musicians. As we look back on its journey from humble beginnings in early jazz bands to its electrifying present, one thing remains clear: the jazz guitar remains a testament to the enduring spirit of innovation and artistic exploration in music.

==Types of guitars==

===Archtop guitars===

 While jazz can be played on any type of guitar, from an acoustic instrument to a solid-bodied electric guitar such as a Fender Stratocaster, the full-depth archtop guitar has become known as the prototypical &quot;jazz guitar.&quot; Archtop guitars are steel-string acoustic guitars with a big soundbox, arched top, violin-style f-holes, a &quot;floating bridge&quot; and magnetic or piezoelectric pickups. Early makers of jazz guitars included Gibson, Epiphone, D&#x27;Angelico and Stromberg. The electric guitar is plugged into a guitar amplifier to make it sound loud enough for performance. Guitar amplifiers have equalizer controls that allow the guitarist to change the tone of the instrument, by emphasizing or de-emphasizing certain frequency bands. The use of reverb effects, often included in guitar amplifiers, has long been part of the jazz guitar sound. Particularly since the 1970s jazz fusion era, some jazz guitarists have also used effects pedals such as overdrive pedals, chorus pedals and wah pedals.

The earliest guitars used in jazz were acoustic, later superseded by a typical electric configuration of two humbucking pickups. In the 1990s, there was a resurgence of interest among jazz guitarists in acoustic archtop guitars with floating pickups. The original acoustic archtop guitars were designed to enhance volume: for that reason they were constructed for use with relatively heavy guitar strings. Even after electrification became the norm, jazz guitarists continued to fit strings of 0.012&quot; gauge or heavier for reasons of tone, and also prefer flatwound strings. The characteristic arched top can be made of a solid piece of wood that is carved into the arched shape, or a piece of laminated wood (essentially a type of plywood) that is pressed into shape. Spruce is often used for tops, and maple for backs. Archtop guitars can be mass-produced, such as the Ibanez Artcore series, or handmade by luthiers such as Robert Benedetto.

===Other guitars===
* The Selmer-Maccaferri guitar is strongly associated with Django Reinhardt and gypsy swing.
* The resonator guitar was used (but not exclusively) by Oscar Aleman.
* Nylon string guitars are associated with Latin jazz, for instance in the work of Charlie Byrd and Laurindo Almeida.
* Flat-top steel-string guitars (particularly Ovation guitars) have been used in the &quot;acoustic shredding&quot; of John McLaughlin, Larry Coryell and Al Di Meola.
* Solid-body electric guitars have been used in jazz-rock, for instance by Bill Frisell and Stanley Jordan. The Telecaster in particular has a jazz following, e.g. Ed Bickert and Ted Greene.

==Musical elements ==

===Rhythm===
Jazz rhythm guitar often consists of very textural, odd-meter playing that includes generous use of exotic, difficult-to-fret chords. In 4/4 timing, it is common to play 2.5 beat intervals such as on the 2 and then the half beat or &quot;and&quot; after 4. Jazz guitarists may play chords &quot;ahead&quot; of the beat, by playing the chord a swung eighth note before the actual chord change. Chords are not generally played in a repetitive rhythmic fashion, like a rock rhythm guitarist would play.

===Harmony===
Jazz guitarists use their knowledge of harmony and jazz theory to create jazz chord &quot;voicings,&quot; which emphasize the 3rd and 7th notes of the chord. Some more sophisticated chord voicings also include the 9th, 11th, and 13th notes of the chord. In some modern jazz styles, dominant 7th chords in a tune may contain altered 9ths (either flattened by a semitone, which is called a &quot;flat 9th&quot;, or sharpened by a semitone, which is called a &quot;sharp 9th&quot;); 11ths (sharpened by a semitone, which is called a &quot;sharp 11th&quot;); 13ths (typically flattened by a semitone, which is called a &quot;flat 13th&quot;).

Jazz guitarists need to learn about a range of different chords, including major 7th, major 6th, minor 7th, minor/major 7th, dominant 7th, diminished, half-diminished, and augmented chords. As well, they need to learn about chord transformations (e.g., altered chords, such as &quot;alt dominant chords&quot; described above), chord substitutions, and re-harmonization techniques. Some jazz guitarists use their knowledge of jazz scales and chords to provide a walking bass-style accompaniment.

Jazz guitarists learn to perform these chords over the range of different chord progressions used in jazz, such as the ubiquitous ii-V-I progression, the jazz-style blues progression (which, in contrast to a blues-style 12 bar progression, may have two or more chord changes per bar) the minor jazz-style blues form, the I-vi-ii-V based &quot;rhythm changes&quot; progression, and the variety of modulation-rich chord progressions used in jazz ballads, and jazz standards. Guitarists may also learn to use the chord types, strumming styles, and effects pedals (e.g., chorus effect or fuzzbox) used in 1970s-era jazz-Latin, jazz-funk, and jazz-rock fusion music.

===Melody===
Jazz guitarists integrate the basic building blocks of scales and arpeggio patterns into balanced rhythmic and melodic phrases that make up a cohesive solo. Jazz guitarists often try to imbue their melodic phrasing with the sense of natural breathing and legato phrasing used by horn players such as saxophone players. As well, a jazz guitarists&#x27; solo improvisations have to have a rhythmic drive and &quot;timefeel&quot; that creates a sense of &quot;swing&quot; and &quot;groove.&quot; The most experienced jazz guitarists learn to play with different &quot;timefeels&quot; such as playing &quot;ahead of the beat&quot; or &quot;behind the beat,&quot; to create or release tension.

Another aspect of the jazz guitar style is the use of stylistically appropriate ornaments, such as grace notes, slides, and muted notes. Each subgenre or era of jazz has different ornaments that are part of the style of that subgenre or era. Jazz guitarists usually learn the appropriate ornamenting styles by listening to prominent recordings from a given style or jazz era. Some jazz guitarists also borrow ornamentation techniques from other jazz instruments, such as Wes Montgomery&#x27;s borrowing of playing melodies in parallel octaves, which is a jazz piano technique. Jazz guitarists also have to learn how to add in passing tones, use &quot;guide tones&quot; and chord tones from the chord progression to structure their improvisations.

In the 1970s and 1980s, with jazz-rock fusion guitar playing, jazz guitarists incorporated rock guitar soloing approaches, such as riff-based soloing and usage of pentatonic and blues scale patterns. Some guitarists used Jimi Hendrix-influenced distortion and wah-wah effects to get a sustained, heavy tone, or even used rapid-fire guitar shredding techniques, such as tapping and tremolo bar bending. Guitarist Al Di Meola, who started his career with Return to Forever in 1974, was one of the first guitarists to perform in a &quot;shred&quot; style, a technique later used in rock and heavy metal playing. Di Meola used alternate-picking to perform very rapid sequences of notes in his solos.

===Improvisation===
When jazz guitar players improvise, they use the scales, modes, and arpeggios associated with the chords in a tune&#x27;s chord progression. The approach to improvising has changed since the earliest eras of jazz guitar. During the Swing era, many soloists improvised &quot;by ear&quot; by embellishing the melody with ornaments and passing notes. However, during the bebop era, the rapid tempo and complicated chord progressions made it increasingly harder to play &quot;by ear.&quot; Along with other improvisers, such as saxes and piano players, bebop-era jazz guitarists began to improvise over the chord changes using scales (whole tone scale, chromatic scale, etc.) and arpeggios. Jazz guitar players tend to improvise around chord/scale relationships, rather than reworking the melody, possibly due to their familiarity with chords resulting from their comping role. A source of melodic ideas for improvisation is transcribing improvised solos from recordings. This provides jazz guitarists with a source of &quot;licks&quot;, melodic phrases and ideas they incorporate either intact or in variations, and is an established way of learning from the previous generations of players.

==Playing styles==

===Big band rhythm===
In jazz big bands, popular during the 1930s and 1940s, the guitarist is considered an integral part of the rhythm section (guitar, drums and bass). They usually played a regular four strums to the bar, although an amount of harmonic improvisation is possible. Freddie Green, guitarist in the Count Basie orchestra, was a noted exponent of this style. The harmonies are often minimal; for instance, the root note is often omitted on the assumption that it will be supplied by the bassist.

===Small group comping===
When jazz guitarists play chords underneath a song&#x27;s melody or another musician&#x27;s solo improvisations, it is called &quot;comping&quot;, short for &quot;accompanying&quot;. The accompanying style in most jazz styles differs from the way chordal instruments accompany in many popular styles of music. In many popular styles of music, such as rock and pop, the rhythm guitarist usually performs the chords in rhythmic fashion which sets out the beat or groove of a tune. In contrast, in many modern jazz styles within smaller groups, the guitarist plays much more sparsely, intermingling periodic chords and delicate voicings into pauses in the melody or solo, and using periods of silence. Jazz guitarists commonly use a wide variety of inversions when comping, rather than only using standard voicings.

===Chord-melody and unaccompanied soloing===
In this style, the guitarist aims to render an entire song — harmony, melody and bass — in something like the way a classical guitarist or pianist can. Chord roots cannot be left to the bassist in this style. Chords themselves can be used sparsely or more densely, depending on both the individual player and his or her arrangement of a particular piece. In the sparse style, a full chord is often played only at the beginning of a melodic phrase. The denser chordal textures, in contrast, approach chord soloing (see below). A third approach is to maintain a steady, busy bass-line, like a New Orleans pianist. Here, no more than two or three notes are played at a time, and the full harmony is indicated by arpeggiation. Exponents of this style often come from a country, folk or ragtime background, such as Chet Atkins, although it is also sometimes employed by straight-ahead jazz practitioners, for instance Martin Taylor. Chord-melody is often played with a plectrum (see Tal Farlow, George Benson and others); whereas fingerstyle, as practised by Joe Pass, George van Eps, Ted Greene, Robert Conti, Lenny Breau or hybrid picking as practised by Ed Bickert, Laszlo Sirsom and others allows for a more complex, polyphonic approach to unaccompanied soloing.

===&quot;Blowing&quot; or single-note soloing===
Eddie Lang and Lonnie Johnson were two of the earliest practitioners of single note improvised solos. Both played with Louis Armstrong and other leading jazz and blues musicians of the 1920s and 1930s. In later years Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt, the former on electric guitar and the latter playing forcefully on an acoustic guitar, are acknowledged as the first soloists to put jazz guitar improvisation on an equal footing with that of other instruments. Over the years, jazz guitarists have been able to solo in standard jazz idioms, such as bebop, cool jazz and so on, while in also absorbing influences from rock guitarists, such as the use of electronic effects.

===Chord soloing===
Jazz guitarists are not limited to single note improvisation. When working with accompaniment, chord solos are created by improvising chords (harmony) and melody simultaneously, usually in the upper register on strings 1,2,3 and 4. Wes Montgomery was noted for playing successive choruses in single notes, then octaves and finally a chord solo - this can be heard in his improvisation on the standard Lover Man (Oh, Where Can You Be?). When playing without accompaniment, jazz guitarists may create chord solos by playing bass, melody and chords, individually or simultaneously, on any or all strings - such as the work of Lenny Breau, Joe Pass, Martin Taylor and others. This technique can also be incorporated into unaccompanied soloing: for instance Django Reinhardt&#x27;s &quot;improvisations&quot;, as he called his solo pieces.

<doc id="16142" wikidata="Q9041" url="?curid=16142" title="James Watt">
<text>James Watt (; 30 January 1736 – 25 August 1819) was a Scottish inventor, mechanical engineer, and chemist who improved on Thomas Newcomen&#x27;s 1712 Newcomen steam engine with his Watt steam engine in 1776, which was fundamental to the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution in both his native Great Britain and the rest of the world. 

While working as an instrument maker at the University of Glasgow, Watt became interested in the technology of steam engines. At the time engineers such as John Smeaton were aware of the inefficiencies of Newcomen&#x27;s engine and aimed to improve it. Watt&#x27;s insight was to realise that contemporary engine designs wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and reheating the cylinder. Watt introduced a design enhancement, the separate condenser, which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of steam engines. Eventually, he adapted his engine to produce rotary motion, greatly broadening its use beyond pumping water.

Watt attempted to commercialise his invention, but experienced great financial difficulties until he entered a partnership with Matthew Boulton in 1775. The new firm of Boulton and Watt was eventually highly successful and Watt became a wealthy man. In his retirement, Watt continued to develop new inventions though none was as significant as his steam engine work.

As Watt developed the concept of horsepower, the SI unit of power, the watt, was named after him.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
James Watt was born on 19 January 1736 in Greenock, Renfrewshire, the eldest of the five surviving children of Agnes Muirhead (1703–1755) and James Watt (1698–1782). Watt was baptised on 25 January 1736 at Old West Kirk, in Greenock. His mother came from a distinguished family, was well educated and said to be of forceful character, while his father was a shipwright, ship owner and contractor, and served as the Greenock&#x27;s chief baillie in 1751. The Watt family&#x27;s wealth came in part from Watt&#x27;s father&#x27;s trading in slaves and slave-produced goods. 
Watt&#x27;s parents were Presbyterians and strong Covenanters, but despite his religious upbringing he later became a deist. Watt&#x27;s grandfather, Thomas Watt (1642–1734), was a teacher of mathematics, surveying and navigation and baillie to the Baron of Cartsburn.

Initially, Watt was educated at home by his mother, later going on to attend Greenock Grammar School. There he exhibited an aptitude for mathematics, while Latin and Greek failed to interest him.

Watt is said to have suffered prolonged bouts of ill-health as a child and from frequent headaches all his life.

After leaving school, Watt worked in the workshops of his father&#x27;s businesses, demonstrating considerable dexterity and skill in creating engineering models. After his father suffered unsuccessful business ventures, Watt left Greenock to seek employment in Glasgow as a mathematical instrument maker.


When he was 18, Watt&#x27;s mother died and his father&#x27;s health began to fail. Watt travelled to London and was able to obtain a period of training as an instrument maker for a year (1755–56), then returned to Scotland, settling in the major commercial city of Glasgow, intent on setting up his own instrument-making business. He was still very young and, having not had a full apprenticeship, did not have the usual connections via a former master to establish himself as a journeyman instrument maker.

Watt was saved from this impasse by the arrival from Jamaica of astronomical instruments bequeathed by Alexander MacFarlane to the University of Glasgow – instruments that required expert attention. Watt restored them to working order and was remunerated. These instruments were eventually installed in the Macfarlane Observatory. Subsequently, three professors offered him the opportunity to set up a small workshop within the university. It was initiated in 1757 and two of the professors, the physicist and chemist Joseph Black as well as the famed economist Adam Smith, became Watt&#x27;s friends.

At first, he worked on maintaining and repairing scientific instruments used in the university, helping with demonstrations, and expanding the production of quadrants. He made and repaired brass reflecting quadrants, parallel rulers, scales, parts for telescopes, and barometers, among other things.

Biographers such as Samuel Smiles assert that Watt struggled to establish himself in Glasgow due to opposition from the Trades House, but this has been disputed by other historians, such as . The records from this period are fragmentary, but while it is clear that Watt encountered opposition, he was nevertheless able to work and trade as a skilled metal worker, suggesting that the Incorporation of Hammermen were satisfied that he met their requirements for membership, or that Watt managed to avoid their outright opposition.

In 1759, he formed a partnership with John Craig, an architect and businessman, to manufacture and sell a line of products including musical instruments and toys. This partnership lasted for the next six years, and employed up to 16 workers. Craig died in 1765. One employee, Alex Gardner, eventually took over the business, which lasted into the 20th century.

In 1764, Watt married his cousin Margaret (Peggy) Miller, with whom he had 5 children, 2 of whom lived to adulthood: James Jr. (1769–1848) and Margaret (1767–1796). His wife died in childbirth in 1773. In 1777, he married again, to Ann MacGregor, daughter of a Glasgow dye-maker, with whom he had 2 children: Gregory (1777–1804), who became a geologist and mineralogist, and Janet (1779–1794). Ann died in 1832. Between 1777 and 1790 he lived in Regent Place, Birmingham.

== Scientific studies and inventions ==

===Watt and the kettle===
There is a popular story that Watt was inspired to invent the steam engine by seeing a kettle boiling, the steam forcing the lid to rise and thus showing Watt the power of steam. This story is told in many forms; in some Watt is a young lad, in others he is older, sometimes it&#x27;s his mother&#x27;s kettle, sometimes his aunt&#x27;s, suggesting that it may be apocryphal. In any event, Watt did not &quot;invent&quot; the steam engine, but significantly &quot;improved the efficiency&quot; of the existing Newcomen engine by adding a separate condenser, consistent with the now-familiar principles of thermal efficiency. The story was possibly created by Watt&#x27;s son, James Watt, Jr., who was determined to preserve and embellish his father&#x27;s legacy. In this light, it can be seen as akin to the story of Isaac Newton and the falling apple and his discovery of gravity.

Although likely a myth, the story of Watt and the kettle has a basis in fact. In trying to understand the thermodynamics of heat and steam, James Watt carried out many laboratory experiments and his diaries record that in conducting these, he used a kettle as a boiler to generate steam.

===Early experiments with steam===

In 1759 Watt&#x27;s friend John Robison called his attention to the use of steam as a source of motive power. The design of the Newcomen engine, in use for almost 50 years for pumping water from mines, had hardly changed from its first implementation. Watt began to experiment with steam, though he had never seen an operating steam engine. He tried constructing a model; it failed to work satisfactorily, but he continued his experiments and began to read everything he could about the subject. He came to realise the importance of latent heat—the thermal energy released or absorbed during a constant-temperature process—in understanding the engine, which, unknown to Watt, his friend Joseph Black had previously discovered years before. Understanding of the steam engine was in a very primitive state, for the science of thermodynamics would not be formalised for nearly another 100 years.

In 1763, Watt was asked to repair a model Newcomen engine belonging to the university. Even after repair, the engine barely worked. After much experimentation, Watt demonstrated that about three-quarters of the thermal energy of the steam was being consumed in heating the engine cylinder on every cycle. This energy was wasted because, later in the cycle, cold water was injected into the cylinder to condense the steam to reduce its pressure. Thus, by repeatedly heating and cooling the cylinder, the engine wasted most of its thermal energy rather than converting it into mechanical energy.

Watt&#x27;s critical insight, arrived at in May 1765 as he crossed Glasgow Green park, was to cause the steam to condense in a separate chamber apart from the piston, and to maintain the temperature of the cylinder at the same temperature as the injected steam by surrounding it with a &quot;steam jacket&quot;. Thus, very little energy was absorbed by the cylinder on each cycle, making more available to perform useful work. Watt had a working model later that same year.


Despite a potentially workable design, there were still substantial difficulties in constructing a full-scale engine. This required more capital, some of which came from Black. More substantial backing came from John Roebuck, the founder of the celebrated Carron Iron Works near Falkirk, with whom he now formed a partnership. Roebuck lived at Kinneil House in Bo&#x27;ness, during which time Watt worked at perfecting his steam engine in a cottage adjacent to the house. The shell of the cottage, and a very large part of one of his projects, still exist to the rear.

The principal difficulty was in machining the piston and cylinder. Iron workers of the day were more like blacksmiths than modern machinists, and were unable to produce the components with sufficient precision. Much capital was spent in pursuing a patent on Watt&#x27;s invention. Strapped for resources, Watt was forced to take up employment—first as a surveyor, then as a civil engineer—for 8 years.
Roebuck went bankrupt, and Matthew Boulton, who owned the Soho Manufactory works near Birmingham, acquired his patent rights. An extension of the patent to 1800 was successfully obtained in 1775.

Through Boulton, Watt finally had access to some of the best iron workers in the world. The difficulty of the manufacture of a large cylinder with a tightly fitting piston was solved by John Wilkinson, who had developed precision boring techniques for cannon making at Bersham, near Wrexham, North Wales. Watt and Boulton formed a hugely successful partnership, Boulton and Watt, which lasted for the next 25 years.

===First engines===
In 1776, the first engines were installed and working in commercial enterprises. These first engines were used to power pumps and produced only reciprocating motion to move the pump rods at the bottom of the shaft. The design was commercially successful, and for the next five years, Watt was very busy installing more engines, mostly in Cornwall, for pumping water out of mines.

These early engines were not manufactured by Boulton and Watt, but were made by others according to drawings made by Watt, who served in the role of consulting engineer. The erection of the engine and its shakedown was supervised by Watt, at first, and then by men in the firm&#x27;s employ, with the actual work being accomplished by the purchaser of the engine. Supervising erectors included at various times William Murdoch, John Rennie, William Playfair, John Southern, Logan Henderson, James Lawson, William Brunton, Isaac Perrins, and others.

These were large machines. The first, for example, had a cylinder with a diameter of 50 inches and an overall height of about 24 feet, and required the construction of a dedicated building to house it. Boulton and Watt charged an annual payment, equal to one-third of the value of the coal saved in comparison to a Newcomen engine performing the same work.

The field of application for the invention was greatly widened when Boulton urged Watt to convert the reciprocating motion of the piston to produce rotational power for grinding, weaving and milling. Although a crank seemed the obvious solution to the conversion, Watt and Boulton were stymied by a patent for this, whose holder, James Pickard and his associates proposed to cross-license the external condenser. Watt adamantly opposed this and they circumvented the patent by their sun and planet gear in 1781.

Over the next six years, he made other improvements and modifications to the steam engine. A double-acting engine, in which the steam acted alternately on both sides of the piston, was one. He described methods for working the steam &quot;expansively&quot; (i.e., using steam at pressures well above atmospheric). A compound engine, which connected two or more engines, was described. Two more patents were granted for these in 1781 and 1782. Numerous other improvements that made for easier manufacture and installation were continually implemented. One of these included the use of the steam indicator which produced an informative plot of the pressure in the cylinder against its volume, which he kept as a trade secret. Another important invention, one which Watt was most proud of, was the parallel motion linkage, which was essential in double-acting engines as it produced the straight line motion required for the cylinder rod and pump, from the connected rocking beam, whose end moves in a circular arc. This was patented in 1784. A throttle valve to control the power of the engine, and a centrifugal governor, patented in 1788, to keep it from &quot;running away&quot; were very important. These improvements taken together produced an engine which was up to five times as fuel efficient as the Newcomen engine.

Because of the danger of exploding boilers, which were in a very primitive stage of development, and the ongoing issues with leaks, Watt restricted his use of high pressure steam – all of his engines used steam at near atmospheric pressure.

===Patent trials===

Edward Bull started constructing engines for Boulton and Watt in Cornwall in 1781. By 1792, he had started making engines of his own design, but which contained a separate condenser, and so infringed Watt&#x27;s patents. Two brothers, Jabez Carter Hornblower and Jonathan Hornblower Jnr also started to build engines about the same time. Others began to modify Newcomen engines by adding a condenser, and the mine owners in Cornwall became convinced that Watt&#x27;s patent could not be enforced. They started to withhold payments to Boulton and Watt, which by 1795 had fallen on hard times. Of the total £21,000 (equivalent to £ as of ) owed, only £2,500 had been received. Watt was forced to go to court to enforce his claims.

He first sued Bull in 1793. The jury found for Watt, but the question of whether or not the original specification of the patent was valid was left to another trial. In the meantime, injunctions were issued against the infringers, forcing their payments of the royalties to be placed in escrow. The trial on determining the validity of the specifications which was held in the following year was inconclusive, but the injunctions remained in force and the infringers, except for Jonathan Hornblower, all began to settle their cases. Hornblower was soon brought to trial in 1799, and the verdict of the four was decisively in favour of Watt. Their friend John Wilkinson, who had solved the problem of boring an accurate cylinder, was a particularly grievous case. He had erected about 20 engines without Boulton&#x27;s and Watts&#x27; knowledge. They finally agreed to settle the infringement in 1796. Boulton and Watt never collected all that was owed them, but the disputes were all settled directly between the parties or through arbitration. These trials were extremely costly in both money and time, but ultimately were successful for the firm.

===Copying machine===

Before 1780, there was no good method for making copies of letters or drawings. The only method sometimes used was a mechanical one using multiple linked pens. Watt at first experimented with improving this method, but soon gave up on this approach because it was so cumbersome. He instead decided to try to physically transfer ink from the front of the original to the back of another sheet, moistened with a solvent, and pressed to the original. The second sheet had to be thin, so that the ink could be seen through it when the copy was held up to the light, thus reproducing the original exactly.

Watt started to develop the process in 1779, and made many experiments to formulate the ink, select the thin paper, to devise a method for wetting the special thin paper, and to make a press suitable for applying the correct pressure to effect the transfer. All of these required much experimentation, but he soon had enough success to patent the process a year later. Watt formed another partnership with Boulton (who provided financing) and James Keir (to manage the business) in a firm called James Watt and Co. The perfection of the invention required much more development work before it could be routinely used by others, but this was carried out over the next few years. Boulton and Watt gave up their shares to their sons in 1794. It became a commercial success and was widely used in offices even into the 20th century.

===Chemical experiments===
From an early age, Watt was very interested in chemistry. In late 1786, while in Paris, he witnessed an experiment by Claude Louis Berthollet in which he reacted hydrochloric acid with manganese dioxide to produce chlorine. He had already found that an aqueous solution of chlorine could bleach textiles, and had published his findings, which aroused great interest among many potential rivals. When Watt returned to Britain, he began experiments along these lines with hopes of finding a commercially viable process. He discovered that a mixture of salt, manganese dioxide and sulphuric acid could produce chlorine, which Watt believed might be a cheaper method. He passed the chlorine into a weak solution of alkali, and obtained a turbid solution that appeared to have good bleaching properties. He soon communicated these results to James McGrigor, his father-in-law, who was a bleacher in Glasgow. Otherwise, he tried to keep his method a secret.

With McGrigor and his wife Annie, he started to scale up the process, and in March 1788, McGrigor was able to bleach of cloth to his satisfaction. About this time, Berthollet discovered the salt and sulphuric acid process, and published it, so it became public knowledge. Many others began to experiment with improving the process, which still had many shortcomings, not the least of which was the problem of transporting the liquid product. Watt&#x27;s rivals soon overtook him in developing the process, and he dropped out of the race. It was not until 1799, when Charles Tennant patented a process for producing solid bleaching powder (calcium hypochlorite) that it became a commercial success.

By 1794, Watt had been chosen by Thomas Beddoes to manufacture apparatuses to produce, clean and store gases for use in the new Pneumatic Institution at Hotwells in Bristol. Watt continued to experiment with various gases, but by 1797, the medical uses for the &quot;factitious airs&quot; (artificial gases) had come to a dead end.

===Personality===
Watt combined theoretical knowledge of science with the ability to apply it practically. The chemist Humphry Davy said of him, &quot;Those who consider James Watt only as a great practical mechanic form a very erroneous idea of his character; he was equally distinguished as a natural philosopher and a chemist, and his inventions demonstrate his profound knowledge of those sciences, and that peculiar characteristic of genius, the union of them for practical application&quot;.

He was greatly respected by other prominent men of the Industrial Revolution. He was an important member of the Lunar Society of Birmingham, and was a much sought-after conversationalist and companion, always interested in expanding his horizons. His personal relationships with his friends and business partners were always congenial and long-lasting.

According to Lord Liverpool (Prime Minister of the UK),
A more excllent and amikable man in all the relations of life I believe never existed.

Watt was a prolific correspondent. During his years in Cornwall, he wrote long letters to Boulton several times per week. He was averse to publishing his results in, for example, the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot; however, and instead preferred to communicate his ideas in patents. He was an excellent draughtsman.

He was a rather poor businessman, and especially hated bargaining and negotiating terms with those who sought to use the steam engine. In a letter to William Small in 1772, Watt confessed that &quot;he would rather face a loaded cannon than settle an account or make a bargain.&quot; Until he retired, he was always very concerned about his financial affairs, and was something of a worrier. His health was often poor and he suffered frequent nervous headaches and depression. When he retired in 1800, he became a rich enough man to pass the business on to his sons.

===Soho Foundry===
At first, the partnership made the drawings and specifications for the engines, and supervised the work to erect them on the customers&#x27; property. They produced almost none of the parts themselves. Watt did most of his work at his home in Harper&#x27;s Hill in Birmingham, while Boulton worked at the Soho Manufactory. Gradually, the partners began to actually manufacture more and more of the parts, and by 1795, they purchased a property about a mile away from the Soho Manufactory, on the banks of the Birmingham Canal, to establish a new foundry for the manufacture of the engines. The Soho Foundry formally opened in 1796 at a time when Watt&#x27;s sons, Gregory and James Jr. were heavily involved in the management of the enterprise. In 1800, the year of Watt&#x27;s retirement, the firm made a total of 41 engines.

===Later years===
Watt retired in 1800, the same year that his fundamental patent and partnership with Boulton expired. The famous partnership was transferred to the men&#x27;s sons, Matthew Robinson Boulton and James Watt, Junior. The long-time firm engineer William Murdoch was soon made a partner and the firm prospered.

Watt continued to invent other things before and during his semi-retirement. Within his home in Handsworth, Staffordshire, Watt made use of a garret room as a workshop, and it was here that he worked on many of his inventions. Among other things, he invented and constructed machines for copying sculptures and medallions which worked very well, but which he never patented. One of the first sculptures he produced with the machine was a small head of his old professor friend Adam Smith. He maintained his interest in civil engineering and was a consultant on several significant projects. He proposed, for example, a method for constructing a flexible pipe to be used for pumping water under the River Clyde at Glasgow.

He and his second wife travelled to France and Germany, and he purchased an estate in mid-Wales at Doldowlod House, one mile south of Llanwrthwl, which he much improved.

In 1816, he took a trip on the paddle-steamer &quot;Comet&quot;, a product of his inventions, to revisit his home town of Greenock.

He died on 25 August 1819 at his home &quot;Heathfield Hall&quot; near Handsworth in Staffordshire (now part of Birmingham) at the age of 83. He was buried on 2 September in the graveyard of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Handsworth. The church has since been extended and his grave is now inside the church.

==Family==

On 14 July 1764, Watt married his cousin Margaret Miller (d. 1773). They had two children, Margaret (1767–1796) and James (1769–1848). In 1791, their daughter married James Miller. In September 1773, while Watt was working in the Scottish Highlands, he learned that his wife, who was pregnant with their third child, was seriously ill. He immediately returned home but found that she had died and their child was stillborn.

On 29 July 1776, he married Ann MacGregor (d. 1832).

==Freemasonry==
He was Initiated into Scottish Freemasonry in The Glasgow Royal Arch Lodge, No. 77, in 1763. The Lodge ceased to exist in 1810. A Masonic Lodge was named after him in his home town of Glasgow – Lodge James Watt, No. 1215.

==Murdoch&#x27;s contributions==
William Murdoch joined Boulton and Watt in 1777. At first, he worked in the pattern shop in Soho, but soon he was erecting engines in Cornwall. He became an important part of the firm and made many contributions to its success including important inventions of his own.

John Griffiths, who wrote a biography of him in 1992, has argued that Watt&#x27;s discouragement of Murdoch&#x27;s work with high-pressure steam on his steam road locomotive experiments delayed its development: Watt rightly believed that boilers of the time would be unsafe at higher pressures.

Watt patented the application of the sun and planet gear to steam in 1781 and a steam locomotive in 1784, both of which have strong claims to have been invented by Murdoch. The patent was never contested by Murdoch, however, and Boulton and Watt&#x27;s firm continued to use the sun and planet gear in their rotative engines, even long after the patent for the crank expired in 1794. Murdoch was made a partner of the firm in 1810, where he remained until his retirement 20 years later at the age of 76.

==Legacy==

As one author states, Watt&#x27;s improvements to the steam engine &quot;converted it from a prime mover of marginal efficiency into the mechanical workhorse of the Industrial Revolution&quot;.

==Honours==
Watt was much honoured in his own time. In 1784, he was made a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and was elected as a member of the Batavian Society for Experimental Philosophy, of Rotterdam, the Netherlands, in 1787. In 1789, he was elected to the elite group, the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers. In 1806, he was conferred the honorary Doctor of Laws by the University of Glasgow. The French Academy elected him a Corresponding Member and he was made a Foreign Associate in 1814.

The watt is named after James Watt for his contributions to the development of the steam engine, and was adopted by the Second Congress of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1889 and by the 11th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960 as the unit of power incorporated in the International System of Units (or &quot;SI&quot;).

On 29 May 2009, the Bank of England announced that Boulton and Watt would appear on a new £50 note. The design is the first to feature a dual portrait on a Bank of England note, and presents the two industrialists side by side with images of Watt&#x27;s steam engine and Boulton&#x27;s Soho Manufactory. Quotations attributed to each of the men are inscribed on the note: &quot;I sell here, sir, what all the world desires to have—POWER&quot; (Boulton) and &quot;I can think of nothing else but this machine&quot; (Watt). The inclusion of Watt is the second time that a Scot has featured on a Bank of England note (the first was Adam Smith on the 2007 issue £20 note). In September 2011, it was announced that the notes would enter circulation on 2 November.

In 2011, he was one of seven inaugural inductees to the Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame.

==Memorials==
Watt was buried in the grounds of St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Handsworth, in Birmingham. Later expansion of the church, over his grave, means that his tomb is now buried &quot;inside&quot; the church.

The garret room workshop that Watt used in his retirement was left, locked and untouched, until 1853, when it was first viewed by his biographer J. P. Muirhead. Thereafter, it was occasionally visited, but left untouched, as a kind of shrine. A proposal to have it transferred to the Patent Office came to nothing. When the house was due to be demolished in 1924, the room and all its contents were presented to the Science Museum, where it was recreated in its entirety. It remained on display for visitors for many years, but was walled-off when the gallery it was housed in closed. The workshop remained intact, and preserved, and in March 2011 was put on public display as part of a new permanent Science Museum exhibition, &quot;James Watt and our world&quot;.

The approximate location of James Watt&#x27;s birth in Greenock is commemorated by a statue. Other memorials in Greenock include street names and the Watt Memorial Library, which was begun in 1816 with Watt&#x27;s donation of scientific books, and developed as part of the Watt Institution by his son (which ultimately became the James Watt College). Taken over by the local authority in 1974, the library now also houses the local history collection and archives of Inverclyde, and is dominated by a large seated statue in the vestibule. Watt is additionally commemorated by statuary in George Square, Glasgow and Princes Street, Edinburgh, as well as others in Birmingham, where he is also remembered by the Moonstones and a school is named in his honour.

The James Watt College has expanded from its original location to include campuses in Kilwinning (North Ayrshire), Finnart Street and The Waterfront in Greenock, and the Sports campus in Largs. Heriot-Watt University near Edinburgh was at one time the School of Arts of Edinburgh, founded in 1821 as the world&#x27;s first Mechanics Institute, but to commemorate George Heriot, the 16th-century financier to King James VI and I, and James Watt, after Royal Charter the name was changed to Heriot-Watt University. Dozens of university and college buildings (chiefly of science and technology) are named after him. Matthew Boulton&#x27;s home, Soho House, is now a museum, commemorating the work of both men. The University of Glasgow&#x27;s Faculty of Engineering has its headquarters in the James Watt Building, which also houses the department of Mechanical Engineering and the department of Aerospace Engineering. The huge painting &quot;James Watt contemplating the steam engine&quot; by James Eckford Lauder is now owned by the National Gallery of Scotland.

There is a statue of James Watt in Piccadilly Gardens, Manchester and City Square, Leeds.

A colossal statue of Watt by Francis Legatt Chantrey was placed in Westminster Abbey, and later was moved to St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. On the cenotaph, the inscription reads, in part, &quot;JAMES WATT ... ENLARGED THE RESOURCES OF HIS COUNTRY, INCREASED THE POWER OF MAN, AND ROSE TO AN EMINENT PLACE AMONG THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS FOLLOWERS OF SCIENCE AND THE REAL BENEFACTORS OF THE WORLD&quot;.

A bust of Watt is in the Hall of Heroes of the National Wallace Monument in Stirling, Scotland.

The French Navy submarine was named for Watt.

<doc id="16143" wikidata="Q9353" url="?curid=16143" title="John Locke">
<text>John Locke (; 29 August 1632 (O.S.) – 28 October 1704 (O.S.)) was an English philosopher and physician, widely regarded as one of the most influential of the Enlightenment thinkers and commonly known as the &quot;father of liberalism&quot;. Considered one of the first of the British empiricists, following the tradition of Francis Bacon, Locke is equally important to social contract theory. His work greatly affected the development of epistemology and political philosophy. His writings influenced Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and many Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, as well as the American Revolutionaries. His contributions to classical republicanism and liberal theory are reflected in the United States Declaration of Independence. Internationally, Locke&#x27;s political-legal principles continue to have a profound influence on the theory and practice of limited representative government and the protection of basic rights and freedoms under the rule of law.

Locke&#x27;s philosophy of mind is often cited as the origin of modern conceptions of personal identity and the psychology of self, figuring prominently in the work of later philosophers, such as Rousseau, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant. He postulated that, at birth, the mind was a blank slate, or &quot;tabula rasa&quot;. Contrary to Cartesian philosophy based on pre-existing concepts, he maintained that we are born without innate ideas, and that knowledge is instead determined only by experience derived from sense perception, a concept now known as empiricism. Locke is often credited for describing private property as a natural right, arguing that when a person—metaphorically—mixes their labour with nature, resources can be removed from the common state of nature.

==Early life==
Locke was born on 29 August 1632, in a small thatched cottage by the church in Wrington, Somerset, about from Bristol. He was baptised the same day, as both of his parents were Puritans. Locke&#x27;s father, also named John, was an attorney who served as clerk to the Justices of the Peace in Chew Magna, and as a captain of cavalry for the Parliamentarian forces during the early part of the English Civil War. His mother was Agnes Keene. Soon after Locke&#x27;s birth, the family moved to the market town of Pensford, about seven miles south of Bristol, where Locke grew up in a rural Tudor house in Belluton.

In 1647, Locke was sent to the prestigious Westminster School in London under the sponsorship of Alexander Popham, a member of Parliament and John Sr.&#x27;s former commander. At the age of 16 he was at school just half a mile away from the execution of Charles I; however, the boys were not allowed to go and watch. After completing studies at Westminster, he was admitted to Christ Church, Oxford, in the autumn of 1652 at the age of 20. The dean of the college at the time was John Owen, vice-chancellor of the university. Although a capable student, Locke was irritated by the undergraduate curriculum of the time. He found the works of modern philosophers, such as René Descartes, more interesting than the classical material taught at the university. Through his friend Richard Lower, whom he knew from the Westminster School, Locke was introduced to medicine and the experimental philosophy being pursued at other universities and in the Royal Society, of which he eventually became a member.

Locke was awarded a bachelor&#x27;s degree in February 1656 and a master&#x27;s degree in June 1658. He obtained a bachelor of medicine in February 1675, having studied the subject extensively during his time at Oxford. In addition to Lower, he worked with such noted scientists and thinkers as Robert Boyle, Thomas Willis, and Robert Hooke. In 1666, he met Anthony Ashley Cooper, Lord Ashley, who had come to Oxford seeking treatment for a liver infection. Ashley was impressed with Locke and persuaded him to become part of his retinue. At Oxford, he was exposed to the writings of Islamic scholars, such as Ibn Tufayl&#x27;s Hayy ibn Yaqdhan translated by Edward Pococke, who influenced his perspectives on philosophy and &quot;tabula rasa&quot;.

== Career ==
=== Work ===
Locke had been looking for a career and in 1667, moved into Ashley&#x27;s home at Exeter House in London, to serve as his personal physician. In London, Locke resumed his medical studies under the tutelage of Thomas Sydenham. Sydenham had a major effect on Locke&#x27;s natural philosophical thinking—an effect that would become evident in &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding.&quot; Locke&#x27;s medical knowledge was put to the test when Ashley&#x27;s liver infection became life-threatening. Locke coordinated the advice of several physicians and was probably instrumental in persuading Ashley to undergo surgery (then life-threatening in itself) to remove the cyst. Ashley survived and prospered, crediting Locke with saving his life. During this time, Locke served as Secretary of the Board of Trade and Plantations and Secretary to the Lords Proprietors of Carolina, which helped to shape his ideas on international trade and economics.

Ashley, as a founder of the Whig movement, exerted great influence on Locke&#x27;s political ideas. Locke became involved in politics when Ashley became Lord Chancellor in 1672 (Ashley being created 1st Earl of Shaftesbury in 1673). Following Shaftesbury&#x27;s fall from favour in 1675, Locke spent some time travelling across France as a tutor and medical attendant to Caleb Banks. He returned to England in 1679 when Shaftesbury&#x27;s political fortunes took a brief positive turn. Around this time, most likely at Shaftesbury&#x27;s prompting, Locke composed the bulk of the &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot;. While it was once thought that Locke wrote the &quot;Treatises&quot; to defend the Glorious Revolution of 1688, recent scholarship has shown that the work was composed well before this date. The work is now viewed as a more general argument against absolute monarchy (particularly as espoused by Robert Filmer and Thomas Hobbes) and for individual consent as the basis of political legitimacy. Although Locke was associated with the influential Whigs, his ideas about natural rights and government are considered quite revolutionary for that period in English history.

=== The Netherlands ===
Locke fled to the Netherlands in 1683 in the company of Shaftesbury, under strong suspicion of involvement in the Rye House Plot, although there is little evidence to suggest that he was directly involved in the scheme. While in the Netherlands, he lived under the pen-name dr. Van Linden. The philosopher and novelist Rebecca Newberger Goldstein argues that during his five years in Holland, Locke chose his friends &quot;from among the same freethinking members of dissenting Protestant groups as Spinoza&#x27;s small group of loyal confidants [Baruch Spinoza had died in 1677], Locke almost certainly met men in Amsterdam who spoke of the ideas of that renegade Jew who ... insisted on identifying himself through his religion of reason alone.&quot; While she says that &quot;Locke&#x27;s strong empiricist tendencies&quot; would have &quot;disinclined him to read a grandly metaphysical work such as Spinoza&#x27;s &quot;Ethics&quot;, in other ways he was deeply receptive to Spinoza&#x27;s ideas, most particularly to the rationalist&#x27;s well thought out argument for political and religious tolerance and the necessity of the separation of church and state.&quot; Among the friends he made in the Netherlands are Van Leeuwenhoek and Van Limborch, the leader of the Remonstrants. In the Netherlands, Locke had time to return to his writing, spending a great deal of time working on the &quot;Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; and composing the &quot;Letter on Toleration.&quot;

Locke did not return home until after the Glorious Revolution. Locke accompanied Mary II back to England in 1689. The bulk of Locke&#x27;s publishing took place upon his return from exile—his aforementioned &quot;Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot;, the &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot; and &quot;A Letter Concerning Toleration&quot; all appearing in quick succession. Locke&#x27;s close friend Lady Masham invited him to join her at Otes, the Mashams&#x27; country house in Essex. Although his time there was marked by variable health from asthma attacks, he nevertheless became an intellectual hero of the Whigs. During this period, he discussed matters with such figures as John Dryden and Isaac Newton.

=== Death ===

After a lengthy period of poor health, Locke died on 28 October 1704, and is buried in the churchyard of All Saints&#x27; Church in High Laver, near Harlow in Essex, where he had lived in the household of Sir Francis Masham since 1691. Locke never married nor had children. Events that happened during Locke&#x27;s lifetime include the English Restoration, the Great Plague of London, the Great Fire of London, the Glorious Revolution and war against France including the Battle of Blenheim just before his death. He did not live long enough to see the Act of Union of 1707, but the thrones of England and Scotland were held in personal union throughout his lifetime. Constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy were in their infancy during Locke&#x27;s time. Locke has an engraved floor memorial plaque at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford.

== Philosophy ==

In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, Locke&#x27;s &quot;Two Treatises&quot; were rarely cited. Historian Julian Hoppit said of the book &quot;except among some Whigs, even as a contribution to the intense debate of the 1690s it made little impression and was generally ignored until 1703 (though in Oxford in 1695 it was reported to have made &#x27;a great noise&#x27;).&quot; John Kenyon, in his study of British political debate from 1689 to 1720, has remarked that Locke&#x27;s theories were &quot;mentioned so rarely in the early stages of the [Glorious] Revolution, up to 1692, and even less thereafter, unless it was to heap abuse on them&quot; and that &quot;no one, including most Whigs, [was] ready for the idea of a notional or abstract contract of the kind adumbrated by Locke&quot;. In contrast, Kenyon adds that Algernon Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Discourses Concerning Government&quot; were &quot;certainly much more influential than Locke&#x27;s &quot;Two Treatises.&quot;&quot;

In the 50 years after Queen Anne&#x27;s death in 1714, the &quot;Two Treatises&quot; were reprinted only once (except in the collected works of Locke). However, with the rise of American resistance to British taxation, the &quot;Second Treatise of Government&quot; gained a new readership; it was frequently cited in the debates in both America and Britain. The first American printing occurred in 1773 in Boston. Locke exercised a profound influence on political philosophy, in particular on modern liberalism. Michael Zuckert has argued that Locke launched liberalism by tempering Hobbesian absolutism and clearly separating the realms of Church and State. He had a strong influence on Voltaire, who called him &quot;&quot;le sage&quot; Locke&quot;. His arguments concerning liberty and the social contract later influenced the written works of Thomas Jefferson. One passage from the &quot;Second Treatise&quot; is reproduced verbatim in the Declaration of Independence, the reference to a &quot;long train of abuses&quot;. Concerning Locke, Jefferson wrote:

Bacon, Locke and Newton ... I consider them as the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception, and as having laid the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the Physical and Moral sciences.

Locke&#x27;s influence may have been even more profound in the realm of epistemology. Locke redefined subjectivity, or the &quot;self&quot;, leading intellectual historians such as Charles Taylor and Jerrold Seigel to argue that Locke&#x27;s &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; (1689/90) marks the beginning of the modern Western conception of the &quot;self&quot;. Locke&#x27;s theory of association heavily influenced the subject matter of modern psychology. At the time, Locke&#x27;s recognition of two types of ideas, &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;complex&quot;and, more importantly, their interaction through associationinspired other philosophers, such as David Hume and George Berkeley, to revise and expand this theory and apply it to explain how humans gain knowledge in the physical world. Locke thought the state&#x27;s borders and the functioning and enforcement of the existence of the state and its constitution were metaphysically tied to &quot;the natural rights of the individual&quot;, and this inspired future liberal politicians and philosophers.

===Religious tolerance===

Writing his &quot;Letters Concerning Toleration&quot; (1689–1692) in the aftermath of the European wars of religion, Locke formulated a classic reasoning for religious tolerance, in which three arguments are central:

# earthly judges, the state in particular, and human beings generally, cannot dependably evaluate the truth-claims of competing religious standpoints;
# even if they could, enforcing a single &#x27;true religion&#x27; would not have the desired effect, because belief cannot be compelled by violence;
# coercing religious uniformity would lead to more social disorder than allowing diversity.

With regard to his position on religious tolerance, Locke was influenced by Baptist theologians like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys, who had published tracts demanding freedom of conscience in the early 17th century. Baptist theologian Roger Williams founded the colony of Rhode Island in 1636, where he combined a democratic constitution with unlimited religious freedom. His tract, &quot;The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution for Cause of Conscience&quot; (1644), which was widely read in the mother country, was a passionate plea for absolute religious freedom and the total separation of church and state. Freedom of conscience had had high priority on the theological, philosophical, and political agenda, as Martin Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms in 1521, unless he would be proved false by the Bible.

===Slavery and child labour===
Locke&#x27;s views on slavery were multifaceted. Although he wrote against slavery in general, Locke was an investor and beneficiary of the slave-trading Royal Africa Company. While secretary to the Earl of Shaftesbury, Locke also participated in drafting the &quot;Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina&quot;, which established a quasi-feudal aristocracy and gave Carolinian planters absolute power over their enslaved chattel property; the constitutions pledged that &quot;every freeman of Carolina shall have absolute power and authority over his negro slaves&quot;. Philosopher Martin Cohen observes that Locke, as secretary to the Council of Trade and Plantations and a member of the Board of Trade, was &quot;one of just half a dozen men who created and supervised both the colonies and their iniquitous systems of servitude&quot;. According to American historian James Farr, Locke never expressed any thoughts about his contradictory opinions of slavery, which Farr ascribes to his personal involvement in the Atlantic slave trade. Locke&#x27;s positions on slavery have been described as hypocritical, and laying the foundation for the Founding Fathers to hold similarly contradictory thoughts regarding freedom and slavery.

Historian Holly Brewer argues that Locke&#x27;s role in the Constitution of Carolina has been exaggerated and that he was merely paid to revise and make copies of a document that had already been partially written before he became involved; she compares Locke&#x27;s role to a lawyer writing a will. She states that Locke was paid in Royal African Company stock in lieu of money for his work as a secretary for a governmental sub-committee, and that he sold the stock after a few years. Brewer likewise argues that Locke actively worked to undermine slavery in Virginia while heading a Board of Trade created by William of Orange following the Glorious Revolution. He specifically attacked colonial policy granting land to slave owners and encouraged the baptism and Christian education of the children of enslaved Africans to undercut a major justification of slaverythat they were heathens who possessed no rights.

In his &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot;, Locke provided a justification for slavery that could never be met, thus rendering invalid all forms of slavery that existed. Moreover, because slavery is invalid, there is a moral injunction to try to throw off and escape from it. Locke also supported child labour, which was an intrinsic part of all pre-industrial societies. In his &quot;Essay on the Poor Law&quot;, he discusses the education of the poor; he laments that &quot;the children of labouring people are an ordinary burden to the parish, and are usually maintained in idleness, so that their labour also is generally lost to the public till they are 12 or 14 years old&quot;. Therefore, he suggests the setting up of &quot;working schools&quot; for poor children in each parish in England so that they will be &quot;from infancy [three years old] inured to work&quot;. He goes on to outline the economics of these schools, arguing not only that they will be profitable for the parish, but also that they will instil a good work ethic in the children.

===Government===


Locke&#x27;s political theory was founded upon that of social contract. Unlike Thomas Hobbes, Locke believed that human nature is characterised by reason and tolerance. Like Hobbes, Locke believed that human nature allows people to be selfish. This is apparent with the introduction of currency. In a natural state, all people were equal and independent, and everyone had a natural right to defend their &quot;life, health, liberty, or possessions&quot;. Most scholars trace the phrase &quot;Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness&quot; in the American Declaration of Independence to Locke&#x27;s theory of rights, although other origins have been suggested. Like Hobbes, Locke assumed that the sole right to defend in the state of nature was not enough, so people established a civil society to resolve conflicts in a civil way with help from government in a state of society. However, Locke never refers to Hobbes by name and may instead have been responding to other writers of the day. Locke also advocated governmental separation of powers and believed that revolution is not only a right but an obligation in some circumstances. These ideas would come to have profound influence on the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States.

==== Accumulation of wealth ====

According to Locke, unused property is wasteful and an offence against nature, but, with the introduction of &quot;durable&quot; goods, men could exchange their excessive perishable goods for those which would last longer and thus not offend the natural law. In his view, the introduction of money marked the culmination of this process, making possible the unlimited accumulation of property without causing waste through spoilage. He includes gold or silver as money because they may be &quot;hoarded up without injury to anyone&quot;, as they do not spoil or decay in the hands of the possessor. In his view, the introduction of money eliminates limits to accumulation. Locke stresses that inequality has come about by tacit agreement on the use of money, not by the social contract establishing civil society or the law of land regulating property. Locke was aware of a problem posed by unlimited accumulation, but did not consider it his task. He just implies that government would function to moderate the conflict between the unlimited accumulation of property and a more nearly equal distribution of wealth; he does not identify which principles that government should apply to solve this problem. However, not all elements of his thought form a consistent whole. For example, the labour theory of value in the &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot; stands side by side with the demand-and-supply theory of value developed in a letter he wrote titled &quot;Some Considerations on the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money&quot;. Moreover, Locke anchors property in labour but, in the end, upholds unlimited accumulation of wealth.

== Ideas ==

=== Economics ===
====On price theory====
Locke&#x27;s general theory of value and price is a supply-and-demand theory, set out in a letter to a member of parliament in 1691, titled &quot;Some Considerations on the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money&quot;. In it, he refers to supply as &quot;quantity&quot; and demand as &quot;rent&quot;: &quot;The price of any commodity rises or falls by the proportion of the number of buyers and sellers ... that which regulates the price ... [of goods] is nothing else but their quantity in proportion to their rent.&quot; The quantity theory of money forms a special case of this general theory. His idea is based on &quot;money answers all things&quot; (Ecclesiastes) or &quot;rent of money is always sufficient, or more than enough&quot; and &quot;varies very little&quot;. Locke concludes that, as far as money is concerned, the demand for it is exclusively regulated by its quantity, regardless of whether the demand is unlimited or constant. He also investigates the determinants of demand and supply. For supply, he explains the value of goods as based on their scarcity and ability to be exchanged and consumed. He explains demand for goods as based on their ability to yield a flow of income. Locke develops an early theory of capitalisation, such as of land, which has value because &quot;by its constant production of saleable commodities it brings in a certain yearly income&quot;. He considers the demand for money as almost the same as demand for goods or land: it depends on whether money is wanted as medium of exchange. As a medium of exchange, he states that &quot;money is capable by exchange to procure us the necessaries or conveniences of life&quot;, and for loanable funds &quot;it comes to be of the same nature with land by yielding a certain yearly income ... or interest&quot;.

====Monetary thoughts====
Locke distinguishes two functions of money: as a &quot;counter&quot; to measure value, and as a &quot;pledge&quot; to lay claim to goods. He believes that silver and gold, as opposed to paper money, are the appropriate currency for international transactions. Silver and gold, he says, are treated to have equal value by all of humanity and can thus be treated as a pledge by anyone, while the value of paper money is only valid under the government which issues it.

Locke argues that a country should seek a favourable balance of trade, lest it fall behind other countries and suffer a loss in its trade. Since the world money stock grows constantly, a country must constantly seek to enlarge its own stock. Locke develops his theory of foreign exchanges, by which in addition to commodity movements, there are also movements in country stock of money, and movements of capital determine exchange rates. He considers the latter less significant and less volatile than commodity movements. As for a country&#x27;s money stock, if it is large relative to that of other countries, he says it will cause the country&#x27;s exchange to rise above par, as an export balance would do.

Locke prepares estimates of the cash requirements for different economic groups (landholders, labourers, and brokers). In each group he posits that the cash requirements are closely related to the length of the pay period. He argues the brokers—the middlemen—whose activities enlarge the monetary circuit and whose profits eat into the earnings of labourers and landholders, have a negative influence on both personal and the public economy to which they supposedly contribute.

====Theory of value and property====
Locke uses the concept of &quot;property&quot; in both broad and narrow terms: broadly, it covers a wide range of human interests and aspirations; more particularly, it refers to material goods. He argues that property is a natural right that is derived from labour. In Chapter V of his &quot;Second Treatise&quot;, Locke argues that the individual ownership of goods and property is justified by the labour exerted to produce such goods&quot;at least where there is enough [land], and as good, left in common for others&quot; (para. 27)or to use property to produce goods beneficial to human society.

Locke states in his &quot;Second Treatise&quot; that nature on its own provides little of value to society, implying that the labour expended in the creation of goods gives them their value. From this premise, understood as a &quot;labour theory of value&quot;, Locke developed a &quot;labour theory of property&quot;, whereby ownership of property is created by the application of labour. In addition, he believed that property precedes government and government cannot &quot;dispose of the estates of the subjects arbitrarily&quot;. Karl Marx later critiqued Locke&#x27;s theory of property in his own social theory.

=== The human mind ===
====The self====
Locke defines &quot;the self&quot; as &quot;that conscious thinking thing, (whatever substance, made up of whether spiritual, or material, simple, or compounded, it matters not) which is sensible, or conscious of pleasure and pain, capable of happiness or misery, and so is concerned for itself, as far as that consciousness extends&quot;. He does not wholly ignore &quot;substance&quot;, writing that &quot;the body too goes to the making the man&quot;. In his &quot;Essay&quot;, Locke explains the gradual unfolding of this conscious mind. Arguing against both the Augustinian view of man as originally sinful and the Cartesian position, which holds that man innately knows basic logical propositions, Locke posits an &#x27;empty mind&#x27;, a &quot;tabula rasa&quot;, which is shaped by experience; and reflections being the two sources of &quot;all&quot; of our ideas. He states in &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot;:

This source of ideas every man has wholly within himself; and though it be not sense, as having nothing to do with external objects, yet it is very like it, and might properly enough be called &#x27;internal sense.&#x27;

Locke&#x27;s &quot;Some Thoughts Concerning Education&quot; is an outline on how to educate this mind. Drawing on thoughts expressed in letters written to Mary Clarke and her husband about their son, he expresses the belief that education makes the manor, more fundamentally, that the mind is an &quot;empty cabinet&quot;:

I think I may say that of all the men we meet with, nine parts of ten are what they are, good or evil, useful or not, by their education.

Locke also wrote that &quot;the little and almost insensible impressions on our tender infancies have very important and lasting consequences&quot;. He argues that the &quot;associations of ideas&quot; that one makes when young are more important than those made later because they are the foundation of the &quot;self&quot;; they are, put differently, what first mark the &quot;tabula rasa&quot;. In his &quot;Essay&quot;, in which both these concepts are introduced, Locke warns, for example, against letting &quot;a foolish maid&quot; convince a child that &quot;goblins and sprites&quot; are associated with the night, for &quot;darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear the one than the other&quot;.

This theory came to be called &quot;associationism&quot;, going on to strongly influence 18th-century thought, particularly educational theory, as nearly every educational writer warned parents not to allow their children to develop negative associations. It also led to the development of psychology and other new disciplines with David Hartley&#x27;s attempt to discover a biological mechanism for associationism in his &quot;Observations on Man&quot; (1749).

====Dream argument====
Locke was critical of Descartes&#x27;s version of the dream argument, with Locke making the counter-argument that people cannot have physical pain in dreams as they do in waking life.

=== Religion ===
====Religious beliefs====
Some scholars have seen Locke&#x27;s political convictions as being based from his religious beliefs. Locke&#x27;s religious trajectory began in Calvinist trinitarianism, but by the time of the &quot;Reflections&quot; (1695) Locke was advocating not just Socinian views on tolerance but also Socinian Christology. However Wainwright (1987) notes that in the posthumously published &quot;Paraphrase&quot; (1707) Locke&#x27;s interpretation of one verse, Ephesians 1:10, is markedly different from that of Socinians like Biddle, and may indicate that near the end of his life Locke returned nearer to an Arian position, thereby accepting Christ&#x27;s pre-existence.
Locke was at times not sure about the subject of original sin, so he was accused of Socinianism, Arianism, or Deism. Locke argued that the idea that &quot;all &quot;Adam&quot;&#x27;s Posterity [are] doomed to Eternal Infinite Punishment, for the Transgression of &quot;Adam&quot;&quot; was &quot;little consistent with the Justice or Goodness of the Great and Infinite God&quot;, leading Eric Nelson to associate him with Pelagian ideas. However, he did not deny the reality of evil. Man was capable of waging unjust wars and committing crimes. Criminals had to be punished, even with the death penalty.

With regard to the Bible, Locke was very conservative. He retained the doctrine of the verbal inspiration of the Scriptures. The miracles were proof of the divine nature of the biblical message. Locke was convinced that the entire content of the Bible was in agreement with human reason (&quot;The Reasonableness of Christianity&quot;, 1695). Although Locke was an advocate of tolerance, he urged the authorities not to tolerate atheism, because he thought the denial of God&#x27;s existence would undermine the social order and lead to chaos. That excluded all atheistic varieties of philosophy and all attempts to deduce ethics and natural law from purely secular premises. In Locke&#x27;s opinion the cosmological argument was valid and proved God&#x27;s existence. His political thought was based on Protestant Christian views. Additionally, Locke advocated a sense of piety out of gratitude to God for giving reason to men.

==== Philosophy from religion ====
Locke&#x27;s concept of man started with the belief in creation. Like philosophers Hugo Grotius and Samuel Pufendorf, Locke equated natural law with the biblical revelation. Locke derived the fundamental concepts of his political theory from biblical texts, in particular from Genesis 1 and 2 (creation), the Decalogue, the Golden Rule, the teachings of Jesus, and the letters of Paul the Apostle. The Decalogue puts a person&#x27;s life, reputation and property under God&#x27;s protection. Locke&#x27;s philosophy on freedom is also derived from the Bible. Locke derived from the Bible basic human equality (including equality of the sexes), the starting point of the theological doctrine of Imago Dei. To Locke, one of the consequences of the principle of equality was that all humans were created equally free and therefore governments needed the consent of the governed. Locke compared the English monarchy&#x27;s rule over the British people to Adam&#x27;s rule over Eve in Genesis, which was appointed by God. Following Locke&#x27;s philosophy, the American Declaration of Independence founded human rights partially on the biblical belief in creation. Locke&#x27;s doctrine that governments need the consent of the governed is also central to the Declaration of Independence.

==Library==
=== Manuscripts, books and treatises ===

Locke was an assiduous book collector and notetaker throughout his life. By his death in 1704, Locke had amassed a library of more than 3,000 books, a significant number in the seventeenth century. Unlike some of his contemporaries, Locke took care to catalogue and preserve his library, and his will made specific provisions for how his library was to be distributed after his death. Locke&#x27;s will offered Lady Masham the choice of &quot;any four folios, eight quartos and twenty books of less volume, which she shall choose out of the books in my Library.&quot; Locke also gave six titles to his &quot;good friend&quot; Anthony Collins, but Locke bequeathed the majority of his collection to his cousin Peter King (later Lord King) and to Lady Masham&#x27;s son, Francis Cudworth Masham.

Francis Masham was promised one &quot;moiety&quot; (half) of Locke&#x27;s library when he reached &quot;the age of one and twenty years.&quot; The other &quot;moiety&quot; of Locke&#x27;s books, along with his manuscripts, passed to his cousin King. Over the next two centuries, the Masham portion of Locke&#x27;s library was dispersed. The manuscripts and books left to King, however, remained with King&#x27;s descendants (later the Earls of Lovelace), until most of the collection was bought by the Bodleian Library, Oxford in 1947. Another portion of the books Locke left to King was discovered by the collector and philanthropist Paul Mellon in 1951. Mellon supplemented this discovery with books from Locke&#x27;s library which he bought privately, and in 1978, he transferred his collection to the Bodleian. 
The holdings in the Locke Room at the Bodleian have been a valuable resource for scholars interested in Locke, his philosophy, practices for information management, and the history of the book. Many of the books still contain Locke&#x27;s signature, which he often made on the pastedowns of his books. Many also include Locke&#x27;s marginalia. The printed books in Locke&#x27;s library reflected his various intellectual interests as well as his movements at different stages of his life. Locke travelled extensively in France and the Netherlands during the 1670s and 1680s, and during this time he acquired many books from the continent. Only half of the books in Locke&#x27;s library were printed in England, while close to 40% came from France and the Netherlands. These books cover a wide range of subjects. According to John Harrison and Peter Laslett, the largest genres in Locke&#x27;s library were theology (23.8% of books), medicine (11.1%), politics and law (10.7%), and classical literature (10.1%). The Bodleian library currently holds more than 800 of the books from Locke&#x27;s library. These include Locke&#x27;s copies of works by several of the most influential figures of the seventeenth century, including
* The Quaker William Penn: &quot;An address to Protestants of all perswasions&quot; (Bodleian Locke 7.69a)
* The explorer Francis Drake: &quot;The world encompassed by Sir Francis Drake&quot; (Bodleian Locke 8.37c)
* The scientist Robert Boyle: &quot;A discourse of things above reason&quot; (Bodleian Locke 7.272)
* The bishop and historian Thomas Sprat: &quot;The history of the Royal-Society of London&quot; (Bodleian Locke 9.10a)

In addition to books owned by Locke, the Bodleian possesses more than 100 manuscripts related to Locke or written in his hand. Like the books in Locke&#x27;s library, these manuscripts display a range of interests and provide different windows into Locke&#x27;s activity and relationships. Several of the manuscripts include letters to and from acquaintances like Peter King (MS Locke b. 6) and Nicolas Toinard (MS Locke c. 45). MS Locke f. 1–10 contain Locke&#x27;s journals for most years between 1675 and 1704. Some of the most significant manuscripts include early drafts of Locke&#x27;s writings, such as his &quot;Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; (MS Locke f. 26). The Bodleian also holds a copy of Robert Boyle&#x27;s &quot;General History of the Air&quot; with corrections and notes Locke made while preparing Boyle&#x27;s work for posthumous publication (MS Locke c. 37 ). Other manuscripts contain unpublished works. Among others, MS. Locke e. 18 includes some of Locke&#x27;s thoughts on the Glorious Revolution, which Locke sent to his friend Edward Clarke but never published.

One of the largest categories of manuscript at the Bodleian comprises Locke&#x27;s notebooks and commonplace books. The scholar Richard Yeo calls Locke a &quot;Master Note-taker&quot; and explains that &quot;Locke&#x27;s methodical note-taking pervaded most areas of his life.&quot; In an unpublished essay &quot;Of Study,&quot; Locke argued that a notebook should work like a &quot;chest-of-drawers&quot; for organising information, which would be a &quot;great help to the memory and means to avoid confusion in our thoughts.&quot; Locke kept several notebooks and commonplace books, which he organised according to topic. MS Locke c. 43 includes Locke&#x27;s notes on theology, while MS Locke f. 18–24 contain medical notes. Other notebooks, such as MS c. 43, incorporate several topics in the same notebook, but separated into sections.

These commonplace books were highly personal and were designed to be used by Locke himself rather than accessible to a wide audience. Locke&#x27;s notes are often abbreviated and are full of codes which he used to reference material across notebooks. Another way Locke personalised his notebooks was by devising his own method of creating indexes using a grid system and Latin keywords. Instead of recording entire words, his indexes shortened words to their first letter and vowel. Thus, the word &quot;Epistle&quot; would be classified as &quot;Ei&quot;. Locke published his method in French in 1686, and it was in 1706. Some of the books in Locke&#x27;s library at the Bodleian are a combination of manuscript and print. Locke had some of his books interleaved, meaning that they were bound with blank sheets in-between the printed pages to enable annotations. Locke interleaved and annotated his five volumes of the New Testament in French, Greek, and Latin (Bodleian Locke 9.103–107). Locke did the same with his copy of Thomas Hyde&#x27;s Bodleian Library catalogue (Bodleian Locke 16.17), which Locke used to create a catalogue of his own library.
