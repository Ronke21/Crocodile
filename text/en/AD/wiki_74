<text>Lake Champlain ( ; , ) is a natural freshwater lake in North America. It mostly lies between the U.S. states of New York and Vermont, but also extends north into the Canadian province of Quebec.

The New York portion of the Champlain Valley includes the eastern parts of Clinton County and Essex County. Most of this area is part of the Adirondack Park. There are recreational facilities in the park and along the relatively undeveloped coastline of the lake. The cities of Plattsburgh, New York, and Burlington, Vermont, are on the lake&#x27;s western and eastern shores, respectively, and the town of Ticonderoga, New York, is in the southern part of the region. The Quebec portion is in the regional county municipalities of Le Haut-Richelieu and Brome-Missisquoi. There are a number of islands in the lake; the largest include Grand Isle, Isle La Motte and North Hero: all part of Grand Isle County, Vermont.

Because of Lake Champlain&#x27;s connections both to the St. Lawrence Seaway via the Richelieu River, and to the Hudson River via the Champlain Canal, Lake Champlain is sometimes referred to as &quot;The Sixth Great Lake&quot;.

==Geology==
The Champlain Valley is the northernmost unit of a landform system known as the Great Appalachian Valley, which stretches between Quebec, Canada, to the north, and Alabama, U.S., to the south. The Champlain Valley is a physiographic section of the larger Saint Lawrence Valley, which in turn is part of the larger Appalachian physiographic division.

Lake Champlain is one of numerous large lakes scattered in an arc through Labrador, in Canada, the northern United States, and the Northwest Territories of Canada.

It is the thirteenth-largest lake by area in the U.S. Approximately in area, the lake is long and across at its widest point, and has a maximum depth of approximately . The lake varies seasonally from about above mean sea level.

===Hydrology===
Lake Champlain is in the Lake Champlain Valley between the Green Mountains of Vermont and the Adirondack Mountains of New York, drained northward by the Richelieu River into the St. Lawrence River at Sorel-Tracy, Quebec, northeast and downstream of Montreal. The Champlain basin collects waters from the northwestern slopes of the Green Mountains and the eastern portion of the Adirondack Mountains, reaching as far south as the Lake George in New York.

Lake Champlain drains nearly half of Vermont, and approximately 250,000 people get their drinking water from the lake.

The lake is fed in Vermont by the LaPlatte, Lamoille, Missisquoi, Poultney and Winooski rivers, along with Lewis Creek, Little Otter Creek and Otter Creek. In New York, it is fed by the Ausable, Boquet, Great Chazy, La Chute, Little Ausable, Little Chazy, Salmon and Saranac rivers, along with Putnam Creek. In Quebec, it is fed by the Pike River.

It is connected to the Hudson River by the Champlain Canal.

Parts of the lake freeze each winter, and in some winters the entire lake surface freezes, referred to as &quot;closing&quot;. In July and August, the lake temperature reaches an average of .

===Chazy Reef===
The Chazy Reef is an extensive Ordovician carbonate rock formation that extends from Tennessee to Quebec and Newfoundland. The oldest reefs are around &quot;The Head&quot; of the south end of Isle La Motte; slightly younger reefs are found at the Fisk Quarry, and the youngest (the famous coral reefs) are in fields to the north.

==History==

The lake has long acted as a border between indigenous nations, much as it is today between the states of New York and Vermont. The lake is located at the frontier between Abenaki and Mohawk (Iroquois Confederacy) traditional territories. The official toponym for the lake, according to the orthography established by the Grand Council of Waban-aki Nation, is Pitawbagok (alternative orthographies include Petonbowk and Bitawbagok), meaning &quot;middle lake&quot;, &quot;lake in between&quot; or &quot;double lake&quot;.

The Mohawk name in modern orthography, as standardized in 1993, is Kaniatarakwà:ronte, meaning &quot;a bulged lake&quot; or &quot;lake with a bulge in it&quot;. An alternate name is Kaniá:tare tsi kahnhokà:ronte (phonetic English spelling &quot;Caniaderi Guarunte&quot;), meaning &quot;door of the country&quot; or &quot;lake to the country&quot;. The lake is an important eastern gateway to Iroquois Confederacy lands.

The lake was named after the French explorer Samuel de Champlain, who encountered it in July 1609. While the ports of Burlington, Vermont, Port Henry, New York, and Plattsburgh, New York, today are primarily used by small craft, ferries and lake cruise ships, they were of substantial commercial and military importance in the 18th and 19th centuries.

===Colonial America and the Revolutionary War===
New France allocated concessions all along Lake Champlain to French settlers and built forts to defend the waterways. In colonial times, Lake Champlain was used as a water (or, in winter, ice) passage between the Saint Lawrence and Hudson valleys. Travelers found it easier to journey by boats and sledges on the lake rather than go overland on unpaved and frequently mud-bound roads. The lake&#x27;s northern tip at Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec (known as St. John in colonial times under British rule) is just from Montreal, Quebec. The southern tip at Whitehall (Skenesborough in revolutionary times) is north of Glens Falls on the Hudson River and north of Albany, New York.

Forts were built at Ticonderoga and Crown Point (Fort St. Frederic) to control passage on the lake in colonial times. Important battles were fought at Ticonderoga in 1758 and 1775. During the Revolutionary War, the British and Americans conducted a frenetic shipbuilding race through the spring and summer of 1776, at opposite ends of the lake, and fought a significant naval engagement on October 11 at the Battle of Valcour Island. While it was a tactical defeat for the Americans, and the small fleet led by Benedict Arnold was almost destroyed, the Americans gained a strategic victory; the British invasion was delayed long enough so the approach of winter prevented the fall of these forts until the following year. In this period, the Continental Army gained strength and was victorious at Saratoga.

====Beginning of the Revolutionary War====
At the start of the Revolutionary War, British forces occupied the Champlain Valley. However, it did not take long for rebel leaders to realize the importance of controlling Lake Champlain. Early in the war, the colonial militias attempted to expel the British from Boston; however, this undertaking could not be achieved without heavy artillery. The British forts at Ticonderoga and Crown Point, on Lake Champlain, were known to have ample supplies of artillery and were weakly-manned by the British. Thus, the colonial militias devised a plan to take control of the two forts and bring the guns back to the fight in Boston.
The necessity of controlling the two forts at Ticonderoga and Crown Point placed Lake Champlain as a strategic arena during the Revolutionary War. By taking control of these forts, Americans not only gained heavy artillery, but control of a vast water highway as well: Lake Champlain provided a direct invasion route to British Canada. However, had the British controlled the lake, they could have divided the colonies of New England and further depleted the Continental Army.

The Continental Army&#x27;s first offensive action took place in May 1775, three weeks after the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Ethan Allen, accompanied by 200 Green Mountain Boys, was ordered to capture Fort Ticonderoga and retrieve supplies for the fight in Boston. Benedict Arnold shared the command with Allen, and, in early May 1775, they captured Fort Ticonderoga, Crown Point and the southern Loyalist settlement of Skenesborough. As a result of Allen&#x27;s offensive attack on the Champlain Valley in 1775, the American forces controlled the Lake Champlain waterway.

====Siege of Quebec: 1775–1776====
The Continental Army realized the strategic advantage of controlling Lake Champlain, as it leads directly to the heart of Quebec. Immediately after taking Forts Ticonderoga and Crown Point, the Americans began planning an attack on British Canada. The American siege of Quebec was a two-pronged assault and occurred throughout the winter of 1775–1776. Brigadier General Richard Montgomery led the first assault up the Champlain Valley into Canada, while Benedict Arnold led a second army to Quebec via the Maine wilderness.

Despite the strategic advantage of controlling a direct route to Quebec by way of the Champlain Valley, the American siege of British Canada during the winter of 1775 failed. The Continental Army mistakenly assumed that it would receive support from the Canadians upon their arrival at Quebec. This was not the case, and the rebel army struggled to take Quebec with diminishing supplies, support, and harsh northern winter weather.

The Continental Army was forced to camp outside Quebec&#x27;s walls for the winter, with reinforcements from New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Connecticut allowing the soldiers to maintain their siege of the city. However, smallpox descended on both the sieging forces and their reinforcements and savaged the American force. The reinforcements traveled hundreds of miles up the frozen Lake Champlain and St. Lawrence River, but were too late and too few to influence a successful siege of Quebec. In May 1776, with the arrival of a British convoy carrying 10,000 British and Hessian troops to Canada, the Continental forces retreated back down the Champlain Valley to reevaluate their strategy.
&quot;I know of no better method than to secure the important posts of Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and by building a number of armed vessels to command the lakes, otherwise the forces now in Canada will be brought down upon us as quick as possible, having nothing to oppose them...They will doubtless try to construct some armed vessels and then endeavor to penetrate the country toward New York.&quot; (Brigadier General John Sullivan to George Washington, June 24, 1776).

Both British and American forces spent the summer of 1776 building their naval fleets, at opposite ends of Lake Champlain. By the October 1776, the Continental Army had 16 operating naval vessels on Lake Champlain: a great increase to the four small ships they had at the beginning of the summer. General Benedict Arnold commanded the American naval fleet on Lake Champlain, which was composed of volunteers and soldiers drafted from the Northern Army. With great contrast to the Continental navy, experienced Royal Navy officers, British seamen and Hessian artillerymen manned the British fleet on Lake Champlain. By the end of the summer of 1776, the opposing armies were prepared to battle over the strategic advantage of controlling Lake Champlain.

====Battle of Valcour Island====
On October 11, 1776, the British and American naval fleets met on the western side of Valcour Island, on Lake Champlain. American General Benedict Arnold established the location, as it provided the Continental fleet with a natural defensive position. The British and American vessels engaged in combat for much of the day, only stopping due to impending nightfall.

After a long day of combat, the American fleet was in worse shape than the experienced British Navy. Upon ceasefire, Arnold called a council of war with his fellow officers, proposing to escape the British fleet via rowboats under the cover of night. As the British burned Arnold&#x27;s flagship, the &quot;Royal Savage&quot;, to the east, the Americans rowed past the British lines.

The following morning, the British learned of the Americans&#x27; escape and set out after the fleeing Continental vessels. On October 13, the British fleet caught up to the struggling American ships near Split Rock Mountain. With no hope of fighting off the powerful British navy, Arnold ordered his men to run their five vessels aground in Ferris Bay, Panton, Vermont. The depleted Continental army escaped on land back to Fort Ticonderoga and Mount Independence; however, they no longer controlled the Lake Champlain waterway.

The approaching winter of 1776–1777 restricted British movement along the recently controlled Lake Champlain. As the British abandoned Crown Point and returned to Canada for the winter, the Americans reduced their garrisons in the Champlain Valley from 13,000 to 2,500 soldiers.

====General Burgoyne&#x27;s Campaign====

In early 1777, British General John Burgoyne led 8,000 troops from Canada, down Lake Champlain and into the Champlain Valley. The goal of this invasion was to divide the New England colonies, thus forcing the Continental Army into a separated fight on multiple fronts. Lake Champlain provided Burgoyne with protected passage deep into the American colonies. Burgoyne&#x27;s army reached Fort Ticonderoga and Mount Independence in late June, 1777. During the night of July 5, the American forces fled Ticonderoga as the British took control of the fort. However, Burgoyne&#x27;s southern campaign did not go uncontested.

On October 7, 1777, American General Horatio Gates, who occupied Bemis Heights, met Burgoyne&#x27;s army at the Second Battle of Freeman&#x27;s Farm. At Freeman&#x27;s Farm, Burgoyne&#x27;s army suffered its final defeat and ended its invasion south into the colonies. Ten days later, on October 17, 1777, British General Burgoyne surrendered his army at Saratoga. This defeat was instrumental to the momentum of the Revolutionary War, as the defeat of the British army along the Champlain-Hudson waterway convinced France to ally with the American army.

====Aftermath of 1777====
Following the failed British campaign led by General Burgoyne, the British still maintained control over the Champlain waterway for the duration of the Revolutionary War. The British used the Champlain waterway to supply raids across the Champlain Valley from 1778 to 1780, and Lake Champlain permitted direct transportation of supplies from the British posts at the northern end of the lake.

With the end of the Revolutionary War in 1783, the British naval fleet on Lake Champlain retreated up to St. John&#x27;s. However, British troops garrisoned at Fort Dutchman&#x27;s Point (North Hero, Vermont) and Fort au Fer (Champlain, New York), on Lake Champlain, did not leave until the 1796 Jay Treaty.

====Post-Revolutionary War period====

Eager to take back control of Lake Champlain following the end of the Revolutionary War, Americans flocked to settle the Champlain Valley. Many individuals emigrated from Massachusetts and other New England colonies, such as Salmon Dutton, a settler of Cavendish, Vermont. Dutton emigrated in 1782 and worked as a surveyor, town official and toll-road owner. His home had a dooryard garden, typical of mid-19th century New England village homes, and his experience settling in the Champlain Valley depicts the industries and lifestyles surrounding Lake Champlain following the Revolutionary War.

Similar to the experience of Salmon Dutton, former colonial militia Major General Hezekiah Barnes settled in Charlotte, Vermont, in 1787. Following the war, Barnes worked as a road surveyor; he also established an inn and trading post in Charlotte, along the main trade route from Montreal down Lake Champlain. Barnes&#x27; stagecoach inn was built in traditional Georgian style, with 10 fireplaces, a ballroom on the interior and a wraparound porch on the outside. In 1800, Continental Army Captain Benjamin Harrington established a distillery business in Shelburne, Vermont, which supplied his nearby inn. These individual accounts shed light on the significance of Lake Champlain during the post-Revolutionary War period.

===War of 1812===
During the War of 1812, British and American forces faced each other in the Battle of Lake Champlain, also known as the Battle of Plattsburgh, fought on September 11, 1814. This ended the final British invasion of the northern states during the War of 1812. It was fought just prior to the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, and the American victory denied the British any leverage to demand exclusive control over the Great Lakes or territorial gains against the New England states.

Three US Naval ships have been named after this battle: , and a cargo ship used during World War I.

Following the War of 1812, the U.S. Army began construction on &quot;Fort Blunder&quot;: an unnamed fortification built at the northernmost end of Lake Champlain to protect against attacks from British Canada. Its nickname came from a surveying error: the initial phase of construction on the fort turned out to be taking place on a point north of the Canada–U.S. border. Once this error was spotted, construction was abandoned. Locals scavenged materials used in the abandoned fort for use in their homes and public buildings.

By the Webster–Ashburton Treaty of 1842, the Canada–U.S. border was adjusted northward to include the strategically important site of &quot;Fort Blunder&quot; on the US side. In 1844, work was begun to replace the remains of the 1812-era fort with a massive new Third System masonry fortification, known as Fort Montgomery. Portions of this fort are still standing.

===Modern history===

In the early 19th century, the construction of the Champlain Canal connected Lake Champlain to the Hudson River system, allowing north–south commerce by water from New York City to Montreal and Atlantic Canada.

In 1909, 65,000 people celebrated the 300th anniversary of the French discovery of the lake. Attending dignitaries included President William Howard Taft, along with representatives from France, Canada and the United Kingdom.

In 1929, then-New York Governor Franklin Roosevelt and Vermont Governor John Weeks dedicated the first bridge to span the lake, built from Crown Point to Chimney Point. This bridge lasted until December 2009. Severe deterioration was found, and the bridge was demolished and replaced with the Lake Champlain Bridge, which opened in November 2011.

On February 19, 1932, boats were able to sail on Lake Champlain. It was the first time that the lake was known to be free of ice during the winter at that time.

Lake Champlain briefly became the nation&#x27;s sixth Great Lake on March 6, 1998, when President Clinton signed Senate Bill 927. This bill, which was led by U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont and reauthorized the National Sea Grant Program, contained a line declaring Lake Champlain to be a Great Lake. This status enabled its neighboring states to apply for additional federal research and education funds allocated to these national resources. However, following a small uproar, the Great Lake status was rescinded on March 24 (although New York and Vermont universities continue to receive funds to monitor and study the lake).

===&quot;Champ&quot;, Lake Champlain monster===
In 1609, Samuel de Champlain wrote that he saw a lake monster long, as thick as a man&#x27;s thigh, with silver-gray scales a dagger could not penetrate. The alleged monster had jaws with sharp and dangerous teeth. Native Americans claimed to have seen similar monsters long. This mysterious creature is likely the original Lake Champlain monster. The monster has been memorialized in sports teams&#x27; names and mascots, e.g., the Vermont Lake Monsters and Champ, the mascot of the state&#x27;s minor league baseball team. A Vermont Historical Society publication recounts the story and offers possible explanations for accounts of the so-called monster: &quot;floating logs, schools of large sturgeon diving in a row, or flocks of blackbirds flying close to the water&quot;. In 2022, it was reported that a feature dramatic film, &quot;Lucy and the Lake Monster&quot;, was in the works about a young orphan girl and her grandfather looking for Champ.

===Ecology===
A pollution prevention, control and restoration plan for Lake Champlain was first endorsed in October 1996 by the governors of New York and Vermont and the regional administrators of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In April 2003, the plan was updated, and Quebec signed on to it. The plan is being implemented by the Lake Champlain Basin Program and its partners at the state, provincial, federal and local levels. Renowned as a model for interstate and international cooperation, its primary goals are to reduce phosphorus inputs to Lake Champlain, reduce toxic contamination, minimize the risks to humans from water-related health hazards and control the introduction, spread, and impact of non-native nuisance species to preserve the integrity of the Lake Champlain ecosystem.

Senior staff who helped organize the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 recall that International Paper was one of the first companies to call upon the brand-new agency, because it was being pressured by both New York and Vermont with regard to a discharge of pollution into Lake Champlain.

Agricultural and urban runoff from the watershed or drainage basin is the primary source of excess phosphorus, which exacerbates algae blooms in Lake Champlain. The most problematic blooms have been cyanobacteria, commonly called blue-green algae, in the northeastern part of the lake: primarily Missisquoi Bay.

To reduce phosphorus runoff to this part of the lake, Vermont and Quebec agreed to reduce their inputs by 60% and 40%, respectively, by an agreement signed in 2002. While agricultural sources (manure and fertilizers) are the primary sources of phosphorus (about 70%) in the Missisquoi basin, runoff from developed land and suburbs is estimated to contribute about 46% of the phosphorus runoff basin-wide to Lake Champlain, and agricultural lands contributed about 38%.

In 2002, the cleanup plan noted that the lake had the capacity to absorb of phosphorus each year. In 2009, a judge noted that were still flowing in annually: more than twice what the lake could handle. Sixty municipal and industrial sewage plants discharge processed waste from the Vermont side.

In 2008, the EPA expressed concerns to the State of Vermont that the lake&#x27;s cleanup was not progressing fast enough to meet the original cleanup goal of 2016. The state, however, cites its Clean and Clear Action Plan as a model that will produce positive results for Lake Champlain.

In 2007, Vermont banned phosphates for dishwasher use starting in 2010. This will prevent an estimated from flowing into the lake. While this represents 0.6% of the phosphate pollution, it took US$1.9 million to remove the pollutant from treated wastewater: an EPA requirement.

Despite concerns about pollution, Lake Champlain is safe for swimming, fishing and boating. It is considered a world-class fishery for salmonid species (lake trout and Atlantic salmon) and bass. About 81 fish species live in the lake, and more than 300 bird species rely on it for habitat and as a resource during migrations.

By 2008, at least seven institutions were monitoring lake water health:
#Conservation Law Foundation, which in 2002 appointed a &quot;lakekeeper&quot; who reviews the state&#x27;s pollution controls
#Friends of Missisquoi Bay, formed in 2003
#Lake Champlain Committee
#Vermont Water Resources Board, which hired a water quality expert in 2008 to write water quality standards and create wetland protection rules
#Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, which in 2007 appointed a &quot;lake czar&quot; to oversee pollution control
#Clean and Clear, an agency of the Vermont state government, established in 2004
#The Nature Conservancy, a non-profit group which focuses on biodiversity and ecosystem health.

In 2001, scientists estimated that farming contributed 38% of the phosphorus runoff. By 2010, results of environmentally-conscious farming practices, enforced by law, had made a positive contribution to lake cleanliness. A federally-funded study was started to analyze this problem and to arrive at a solution.

Biologists have been trying to control lampreys in the lake since 1985 or earlier. Lampreys are native to the area, but have expanded in population to such an extent that they wounded nearly all lake trout in 2006, and 70–80% of salmon. The use of pesticides against the lamprey has reduced their damage to other fish to 35% of salmon and 31% of lake trout. The goal was 15% of salmon and 25% of lake trout.

The federal and state governments originally budgeted US$18 million for lake programs for 2010. This was later supplemented by an additional US$6.5 million from the federal government.

==Natural history==
In 2010, the estimate of cormorant population, now classified as a nuisance species because they take so much of the lake fish, ranged from 14,000 to 16,000. A Fish and Wildlife commissioner said that the ideal population would be about 3,300, amounting to . Cormorants had disappeared from the lake (and all northern lakes) due to the use of DDT in the 1940s and 1950s, which made their eggs more fragile and reduced breeding populations.

Ring-billed gulls are also considered a nuisance, and measures have been taken to reduce their population. Authorities are trying to encourage the return of black-crowned night herons, cattle egrets and great blue herons, which disappeared during the time DDT was being widely used.

In 1989, UNESCO designated the area around Lake Champlain as the Champlain-Adirondack Biosphere Reserve.

==Infrastructure==

===Lake crossings===
The Alburgh Peninsula (also known as the Alburgh Tongue), extending south from the Quebec shore of the lake into Vermont, and Province Point, the southernmost tip of a small promontory approximately in size a few miles to the northeast of the community of East Alburgh, Vermont, are connected by land to the rest of the state only via Canada. This is a distinction shared with the state of Alaska, Point Roberts, Washington, and the Northwest Angle in Minnesota. All of these are practical exclaves of the United States contiguous with Canada. Unlike the other cases, highway bridges across the lake provide direct access to the Alburgh peninsula from within the United States (from three directions), but Province Point is still accessible by land only through Canada.
====Road====
Three roadways cross the lake, two connecting New York and Vermont and one connecting two towns in New York:

*Since November 2011, the Lake Champlain Bridge has crossed the lake&#x27;s southern part, connecting Chimney Point in Vermont with Crown Point, New York. It replaced the Champlain Bridge, which was closed in 2009 because of severe structural problems that could have resulted in a collapse.

:In 2009, the bridge had been used by 3,400 drivers per day, and driving around the southern end of the lake added two hours to the trip. Ferry service was re-established to take some of the traffic burden. On December 28, 2009, the bridge was destroyed by a controlled demolition. A new bridge was rapidly constructed by a joint state commitment, opening on November 7, 2011.

*To the north, US 2 runs from Rouses Point, New York, to Grand Isle County, Vermont, in the town of Alburgh, before continuing south along a chain of islands toward Burlington. To the east, Vermont Route 78 runs from an intersection with US 2 in Alburgh through East Alburgh to Swanton. The US 2-VT 78 route technically runs from the New York mainland to an extension of the mainland between two arms of the lake and then to the Vermont mainland, but it provides a direct route across the two main arms of the lake&#x27;s northern part.
*In the southern section of the lake, New York State Route 22 crosses the South Bay connecting Whitehall, NY and Dresden, Washington County, New York

====Ferry====

North of Ticonderoga, New York, the lake widens appreciably; ferry service is operated by the Lake Champlain Transportation Company at:
*Charlotte, Vermont, to Essex, New York (may not travel when the lake is frozen)
*Grand Isle, Vermont, to Cumberland Head, part of Plattsburgh, New York (year-round icebreaking service)

While the old bridge was being demolished and the new one constructed, Lake Champlain Transportation Company operated a free, 24-hour ferry from just south of the bridge to Chimney Point, Vermont, at the expense of the states of New York and Vermont, at a cost to the states of about $10 per car.

The most southerly crossing is the Fort Ticonderoga Ferry, connecting Ticonderoga, New York, with Shoreham, Vermont, just north of the historic fort.

====Railroad====
Four significant railroad crossings were built over the lake. As of 2021, only one remains.
*The &quot;floating&quot; rail trestle from Larabees Point, Vermont, to Ticonderoga, New York, was operated by the Addison Branch of the Rutland Railroad. It was abandoned in 1918, due to a number of accidents which resulted in locomotives and rail cars falling into the lake.
*The Island Line Causeway, a marble tailings and granite rock landfill causeway that stretched from Colchester (on the mainland) north and west to South Hero, Vermont. Two breaks in the causeway were spanned by a fixed iron trestle and a swing bridge that could be opened to allow boats to pass. The Rutland Railroad (later Rutland Railway) operated trains over this causeway from 1901 to 1961, with the last passenger train operating in 1953. The railroad was officially abandoned in 1963, with tracks and trestles removed over the course of the ten years that followed. The marble tailings and granite rock causeway still remains, as does the fixed iron trestle that bridges the lesser of the two gaps. The swing bridge over the navigation channel was removed in the early 1970s.
:Now called Colchester Park, the main causeway has been adapted and preserved as a recreation area for cyclists, runners and anglers. Two smaller marble tailings and granite rock landfill causeways were also erected as part of this line that connected Grand Isle to North Hero, and spanned from North Hero to Alburgh.

*The Alburgh, Vermont – Rouses Point, New York, rail trestle. From sometime in the late 19th century until 1964, this wooden trestle carried two railroads (the Rutland Railroad and the Central Vermont Railroad) over the lake just south of the US 2 vehicular bridge. The iron swing bridge at the center (over the navigation channel) has been removed. Most of the wooden pilings remain, greatly deteriorated, and can be seen looking south from the US 2 bridge. Part of the trestle on the Rouses Point side has been converted for use as an access pier associated with the local marina.
*The Swanton – Alburgh, Vermont rail trestle. Built in the same manner as at Rouses Point, it crosses the lake just south of Missisquoi Bay and the Canada–U.S. border, within yards south of the Vermont Route 78 bridge. It is still in use by the New England Central Railroad.

===Waterways===
Lake Champlain has been connected to the Erie Canal via the Champlain Canal since the canal&#x27;s official opening on September 9, 1823, the same day as the opening of the Erie Canal from Rochester on Lake Ontario to Albany. It connects to the St. Lawrence River via the Richelieu River, with the Chambly Canal bypassing rapids on the river since 1843. Together with these waterways, the lake is part of the Lakes to Locks Passage. The Lake Champlain Seaway, a project to use the lake to bring ocean-going ships from New York City to Montreal, was proposed in the late 19th century and considered as late as the 1960s, but rejected for various reasons. The lake is also part of the Northern Forest Canoe Trail, which begins in Old Forge, New York, and ends in Fort Kent, Maine.

==Surroundings==
===Major cities===

Burlington, Vermont (pop. 44,743, 2020 census) is the largest city on the lake. The second and third most-populated cities/towns are Plattsburgh, New York, and South Burlington, Vermont, respectively. The fourth-largest community is the town of Colchester.

===Islands===

Lake Champlain contains roughly 80 islands, three of which comprise four entire Vermont towns (most of Grand Isle County). The largest islands:
*South Hero Island, the largest, containing the towns of Grand Isle and South Hero, Vermont
*North Hero Island, containing the town of North Hero, Vermont
*Isle La Motte, containing the town of Isle La Motte, Vermont
*Valcour Island, New York
*Juniper Island
*Three Sisters
*Four Brothers
*Savage Island
*Burton Island (State Park)
*Cloak Island
*Garden Island (Gunboat Island)
*Crab Island
*Dameas Island
*Hen Island
*Butler Island
*Carleton&#x27;s Prize
*Young Island 
*Providence Island
*Stave Island
*Sunset Island
===Lighthouses===

*Bluff Point Lighthouse, on Valcour Island near the New York shore, was built in 1871; it was manned by a full-time lightkeeper until 1930, making it one of the last lighthouses to be manned on the Lake
*Cumberland Head Light, which operated until 1934, is an historic stone lighthouse located on Cumberland Head which is privately owned
*Isle La Motte Light, on the northern end of the island, was originally red, but faded to pink over time; it is privately owned
*Juniper Island Light is a cast-iron lighthouse that dates from 1846; in 1954, it was deactivated and replaced by a steel tower; it is privately owned
*On Point Au Roche, part of Beekmantown, New York, there is a privately owned, historic lighthouse
*Split Rock Lighthouse is located south of Essex, New York, near a natural boundary of the territory between the Mohawk and Algonquin tribes

===Aids to navigation===

All active navigational aids on the American portion of the lake are maintained by Coast Guard Station Burlington, along with those on international Lake Memphremagog to the east.
Aids to navigation on the Canadian portion of the lake are maintained by the Canadian Coast Guard.

===Parks===
There are a number of parks in the Lake Champlain region, in both New York and Vermont.

Those on the New York side of the lake include Point Au Roche State Park, which park grounds have hiking and cross country skiing trails and a public beach; and Ausable Point Campground within the Adirondack Park. Cumberland Bay State Park is located on Cumberland Head, with a campground, city beach and sports fields.

There are various parks along the lake on the Vermont side, including Sand Bar State Park in Milton, featuring a natural sand beach, swimming, canoe and kayak rentals, food concession, picnic grounds and a play area. At , Grand Isle State Park contains camping facilities, a sand volleyball court, a nature walk trail, a horseshoe pit and a play area.

<doc id="18203" wikidata="Q242028" url="?curid=18203" title="Lambda calculus">
<text>Lambda calculus (also written as &quot;λ&quot;-calculus) is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution. Untyped lambda calculus, the topic of this article, is a universal machine, a model of computation that can be used to simulate any Turing machine (and vice versa). It was introduced by the mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930s as part of his research into the foundations of mathematics. In 1936, Church found a formulation which was logically consistent, and documented it in 1940.

Lambda calculus consists of constructing lambda terms and performing reduction operations on them. A term is defined as any valid lambda calculus expression. In the simplest form of lambda calculus, terms are built using only the following rules:

# formula_1: A variable is a character or string representing a parameter.
# formula_2: A lambda abstraction is a function definition, taking as input the bound variable formula_3 (between the λ and the punctum/dot .) and returning the body formula_4.
# formula_5: An application, applying a function formula_4 to an argument formula_7. Both formula_4 and formula_7 are lambda terms.

The reduction operations include:

* formula_10 : α-conversion, renaming the bound variables in the expression. Used to avoid name collisions.
* formula_11 : β-reduction, replacing the bound variables with the argument expression in the body of the abstraction.

If De Bruijn indexing is used, then α-conversion is no longer required as there will be no name collisions. If repeated application of the reduction steps eventually terminates, then by the Church–Rosser theorem it will produce a β-normal form.

Variable names are not needed if using a universal lambda function, such as Iota and Jot, which can create any function behavior by calling it on itself in various combinations.

== Explanation and applications ==
Lambda calculus is Turing complete, that is, it is a universal model of computation that can be used to simulate any Turing machine. Its namesake, the Greek letter lambda (λ), is used in lambda expressions and lambda terms to denote binding a variable in a function.

Lambda calculus may be &quot;untyped&quot; or &quot;typed&quot;. In typed lambda calculus, functions can be applied only if they are capable of accepting the given input&#x27;s &quot;type&quot; of data. Typed lambda calculi are strictly &quot;weaker&quot; than the untyped lambda calculus, which is the primary subject of this article, in the sense that &quot;typed lambda calculi can express less&quot; than the untyped calculus can. On the other hand, typed lambda calculi allow more things to be proven. For example, in simply typed lambda calculus, it is a theorem that every evaluation strategy terminates for every simply typed lambda-term, whereas evaluation of untyped lambda-terms need not terminate (see below). One reason there are many different typed lambda calculi has been the desire to do more (of what the untyped calculus can do) without giving up on being able to prove strong theorems about the calculus.

Lambda calculus has applications in many different areas in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science.
 Lambda calculus has played an important role in the development of the theory of programming languages. Functional programming languages implement lambda calculus. Lambda calculus is also a current research topic in category theory.

== History ==
Lambda calculus was introduced by mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930s as part of an investigation into the foundations of mathematics. The original system was shown to be logically inconsistent in 1935 when Stephen Kleene and J. B. Rosser developed the Kleene–Rosser paradox.

Subsequently, in 1936 Church isolated and published just the portion relevant to computation, what is now called the untyped lambda calculus. In 1940, he also introduced a computationally weaker, but logically consistent system, known as the simply typed lambda calculus.

Until the 1960s when its relation to programming languages was clarified, the lambda calculus was only a formalism. Thanks to Richard Montague and other linguists&#x27; applications in the semantics of natural language, the lambda calculus has begun to enjoy a respectable place in both linguistics and computer science.

=== Origin of the &quot;λ&quot; symbol ===

There is some uncertainty over the reason for Church&#x27;s use of the Greek letter lambda (λ) as the notation for function-abstraction in the lambda calculus, perhaps in part due to conflicting explanations by Church himself. According to Cardone and Hindley (2006):

By the way, why did Church choose the notation &quot;λ&quot;? In [an unpublished 1964 letter to Harald Dickson] he stated clearly that it came from the notation &quot;formula_12&quot; used for class-abstraction by Whitehead and Russell, by first modifying &quot;formula_12&quot; to &quot;formula_14&quot; to distinguish function-abstraction from class-abstraction, and then changing &quot;formula_15&quot; to &quot;λ&quot; for ease of printing.

This origin was also reported in [Rosser, 1984, p.338]. On the other hand, in his later years Church told two enquirers that the choice was more accidental: a symbol was needed and λ just happened to be chosen.

Dana Scott has also addressed this question in various public lectures.
Scott recounts that he once posed a question about the origin of the lambda symbol to Church&#x27;s former student and son-in-law John W. Addison Jr., who then wrote his father-in-law a postcard:

Dear Professor Church,

Russell had the iota operator, Hilbert had the epsilon operator. Why did you choose lambda for your operator?

According to Scott, Church&#x27;s entire response consisted of returning the postcard with the following annotation: &quot;eeny, meeny, miny, moe&quot;.

== Informal description ==

=== Motivation ===
Computable functions are a fundamental concept within computer science and mathematics. The lambda calculus provides simple semantics for computation which are useful for formally studying properties of computation. The lambda calculus incorporates two simplifications that make its semantics simple.
The first simplification is that the lambda calculus treats functions &quot;anonymously&quot;; it does not give them explicit names. For example, the function
: formula_16
can be rewritten in &quot;anonymous form&quot; as
: formula_17
(which is read as &quot;a tuple of and is mapped to formula_18&quot;). Similarly, the function
: formula_19
can be rewritten in anonymous form as
: formula_20
where the input is simply mapped to itself.

The second simplification is that the lambda calculus only uses functions of a single input. An ordinary function that requires two inputs, for instance the formula_21 function, can be reworked into an equivalent function that accepts a single input, and as output returns &quot;another&quot; function, that in turn accepts a single input. For example,
: formula_17
can be reworked into
: formula_23
This method, known as currying, transforms a function that takes multiple arguments into a chain of functions each with a single argument.

Function application of the formula_21 function to the arguments (5, 2), yields at once
: formula_25
: formula_26
: formula_27,
whereas evaluation of the curried version requires one more step
: formula_28
: formula_29 // the definition of formula_3 has been used with formula_31 in the inner expression. This is like β-reduction.
: formula_32 // the definition of formula_33 has been used with formula_34. Again, similar to β-reduction.
: formula_35
to arrive at the same result.

=== The lambda calculus ===
The lambda calculus consists of a language of &quot;lambda terms&quot;, that are defined by a certain formal syntax, and a set of transformation rules for manipulating the lambda terms. These transformation rules can be viewed as an equational theory or as an operational definition.

As described above, having no names, all functions in the lambda calculus are anonymous functions. They only accept one input variable, so currying is used to implement functions of several variables.

==== Lambda terms ====
The syntax of the lambda calculus defines some expressions as valid lambda calculus expressions and some as invalid, just as some strings of characters are valid computer programs and some are not. A valid lambda calculus expression is called a &quot;lambda term&quot;.

The following three rules give an inductive definition that can be applied to build all syntactically valid lambda terms:
* variable is itself a valid lambda term.
*if is a lambda term, and is a variable, then formula_36 is a lambda term (called an &quot;abstraction&quot;);
*if and are lambda terms, then formula_37 is a lambda term (called an &quot;application&quot;).
Nothing else is a lambda term. That is, a lambda term is valid if and only if it can be obtained by repeated application of these three rules. For convenience, some parentheses can be omitted when writing a lambda term. For example, the outermost parentheses are usually not written. See § Notation, below, for an explicit description of which parentheses are optional. It is also common to extend the syntax presented here with additional operations, which allows making sense of terms such as formula_38 The focus of this article is the pure lambda calculus without extensions, but lambda terms extended with arithmetic operations are used for explanatory purposes.

 An &quot;abstraction&quot; formula_39 denotes an § anonymous function that takes a single input and returns . For example, formula_40 is an abstraction representing the function formula_41 defined by formula_42 using the term formula_43 for . The name formula_41 is superfluous when using abstraction. The syntax formula_36 binds the variable in the term . The definition of a function with an abstraction merely &quot;sets up&quot; the function but does not invoke it.

 An &quot;application&quot; formula_46 represents the application of a function to an input , that is, it represents the act of calling function on input to produce formula_47.

A lambda term may refer to a variable that has not been bound, such as the term formula_48 (which represents the function definition formula_49). In this term, the variable has not been defined and is considered an unknown. The abstraction formula_48 is a syntactically valid term and represents a function that adds its input to the yet-unknown .

Parentheses may be used and might be needed to disambiguate terms. For example, 
#formula_51 is of form formula_52 and is therefore an abstraction, while
#formula_53 is of form formula_54 and is therefore an application.

The examples 1 and 2 denote different terms, differing only in where the parentheses are placed. They have different meanings: example 1 is a function definition, while example 2 is a function application. The lambda variable is a placeholder in both examples.

Here, example 1 &quot;defines&quot; a function formula_52, where formula_56 is formula_57, an anonymous function formula_58, with input formula_3; while example 2, formula_60 formula_61, is M applied to N, where formula_62 is the lambda term formula_63 being applied to the input formula_61 which is formula_3. Both examples 1 and 2 would evaluate to the identity function formula_66.

==== Functions that operate on functions ====
In lambda calculus, functions are taken to be &#x27;first class values&#x27;, so functions may be used as the inputs, or be returned as outputs from other functions.

For example, the lambda term formula_66 represents the identity function, formula_20. Further, formula_69 represents the &quot;constant function&quot; formula_70, the function that always returns formula_33, no matter the input. As an example of a function operating on functions, the function composition can be defined as formula_72.

There are several notions of &quot;equivalence&quot; and &quot;reduction&quot; that allow lambda terms to be &quot;reduced&quot; to &quot;equivalent&quot; lambda terms.

==== Alpha equivalence ====
A basic form of equivalence, definable on lambda terms, is &quot;alpha equivalence&quot;. It captures the intuition that the particular choice of a bound variable, in an abstraction, does not (usually) matter.
For instance, formula_66 and formula_74 are alpha-equivalent lambda terms, and they both represent the same function (the identity function).
The terms formula_3 and formula_33 are not alpha-equivalent, because they are not bound in an abstraction.
In many presentations, it is usual to identify alpha-equivalent lambda terms.

The following definitions are necessary in order to be able to define β-reduction:

==== Free variables ====
The &quot;free variables&quot;
 of a term are those variables not bound by an abstraction. The set of free variables of an expression is defined inductively:
* The free variables of formula_3 are just formula_3
* The set of free variables of formula_39 is the set of free variables of formula_80, but with formula_3 removed
* The set of free variables of formula_46 is the union of the set of free variables of formula_80 and the set of free variables of formula_84.

For example, the lambda term representing the identity formula_66 has no free variables, but the function formula_86 has a single free variable, formula_33.

==== Capture-avoiding substitutions ====
Suppose formula_80, formula_84 and formula_90 are lambda terms, and formula_3 and formula_33 are variables.
The notation formula_93 indicates substitution of formula_90 for formula_3 in formula_80 in a &quot;capture-avoiding&quot; manner. This is defined so that:
* formula_97 ; with formula_90 substituted for formula_3, formula_3 becomes formula_90
* formula_102 if formula_103 ; with formula_90 substituted for formula_3, formula_33 (which is not formula_3) remains formula_33
* formula_109 ; substitution distributes to both sides of an application
* formula_110 ; a variable bound by an abstraction is not subject to substitution; substituting such variable leaves the abstraction unchanged
* formula_111 if formula_103 and formula_33 does not appear among the free variables of formula_90 (formula_33 is said to be &quot;fresh&quot; for formula_90) ; substituting a variable which is not bound by an abstraction proceeds in the abstraction&#x27;s body, provided that the abstracted variable formula_33 is &quot;fresh&quot; for the substitution term formula_90.

For example, formula_119, and formula_120.

The freshness condition (requiring that formula_33 is not in the free variables of formula_90) is crucial in order to ensure that substitution does not change the meaning of functions.

For example, a substitution that ignores the freshness condition could lead to errors: formula_123. This erroneous substitution would turn the constant function formula_69 into the identity formula_66.

In general, failure to meet the freshness condition can be remedied by alpha-renaming first, with a suitable fresh variable.
For example, switching back to our correct notion of substitution, in formula_126 the abstraction can be renamed with a fresh variable formula_127, to obtain formula_128, and the meaning of the function is preserved by substitution.

==== β-reduction ====
The β-reduction rule states that an application of the form formula_129 reduces to the term formula_130. The notation formula_131 is used to indicate that formula_132 β-reduces to formula_133.
For example, for every formula_84, formula_135. This demonstrates that formula_136 really is the identity.
Similarly, formula_137, which demonstrates that formula_138 is a constant function.

The lambda calculus may be seen as an idealized version of a functional programming language, like Haskell or Standard ML. Under this view, β-reduction corresponds to a computational step. This step can be repeated by additional β-reductions until there are no more applications left to reduce. In the untyped lambda calculus, as presented here, this reduction process may not terminate. For instance, consider the term formula_139.
Here formula_140.
That is, the term reduces to itself in a single β-reduction, and therefore the reduction process will never terminate.

Another aspect of the untyped lambda calculus is that it does not distinguish between different kinds of data. For instance, it may be desirable to write a function that only operates on numbers. However, in the untyped lambda calculus, there is no way to prevent a function from being applied to truth values, strings, or other non-number objects.

== Formal definition ==
=== Definition ===
Lambda expressions are composed of:
* variables &quot;v&quot;1, &quot;v&quot;2, ...;
* the abstraction symbols λ (lambda) and . (dot);
* parentheses ().

The set of lambda expressions, , can be defined inductively:

# If &quot;x&quot; is a variable, then 
# If &quot;x&quot; is a variable and then 
# If then 

Instances of rule 2 are known as &quot;abstractions&quot; and instances of rule 3 are known as &quot;applications&quot;. &quot;See § reducible expression&quot;

This set of rules may be written in Backus–Naur form as:

 &lt;expression&gt; ::= &lt;abstraction&gt; | &lt;application&gt; | &lt;variable&gt;
 &lt;abstraction&gt; ::= λ &lt;variable&gt; . &lt;expression&gt;
 &lt;application&gt; ::= ( &lt;expression&gt; &lt;expression&gt; )
 &lt;variable&gt; ::= v1 | v2 | ...
=== Notation ===
To keep the notation of lambda expressions uncluttered, the following conventions are usually applied:
* Outermost parentheses are dropped: &quot;M&quot; &quot;N&quot; instead of (&quot;M&quot; &quot;N&quot;).
* Applications are assumed to be left associative: &quot;M&quot; &quot;N&quot; &quot;P&quot; may be written instead of ((&quot;M&quot; &quot;N&quot;) &quot;P&quot;).
* When all variables are single-letter, the space in applications may be omitted: &quot;MNP&quot; instead of &quot;M&quot; &quot;N&quot; &quot;P&quot;.
* The body of an abstraction extends as far right as possible: λ&quot;x&quot;.&quot;M N&quot; means λ&quot;x&quot;.(&quot;M N&quot;) and not (λ&quot;x&quot;.&quot;M&quot;) &quot;N&quot;.
* A sequence of abstractions is contracted: λ&quot;x&quot;.λ&quot;y&quot;.λ&quot;z&quot;.&quot;N&quot; is abbreviated as λ&quot;xyz&quot;.&quot;N&quot;.

=== Free and bound variables ===
The abstraction operator, λ, is said to bind its variable wherever it occurs in the body of the abstraction. Variables that fall within the scope of an abstraction are said to be &quot;bound&quot;. In an expression λ&quot;x&quot;.&quot;M&quot;, the part λ&quot;x&quot; is often called &quot;binder&quot;, as a hint that the variable &quot;x&quot; is getting bound by prepending λ&quot;x&quot; to &quot;M&quot;. All other variables are called &quot;free&quot;. For example, in the expression λ&quot;y&quot;.&quot;x x y&quot;, &quot;y&quot; is a bound variable and &quot;x&quot; is a free variable. Also a variable is bound by its nearest abstraction. In the following example the single occurrence of &quot;x&quot; in the expression is bound by the second lambda: λ&quot;x&quot;.&quot;y&quot; (λ&quot;x&quot;.&quot;z x&quot;).

The set of &quot;free variables&quot; of a lambda expression, &quot;M&quot;, is denoted as FV(&quot;M&quot;) and is defined by recursion on the structure of the terms, as follows:
# , where &quot;x&quot; is a variable.
# 

An expression that contains no free variables is said to be &quot;closed&quot;. Closed lambda expressions are also known as &quot;combinators&quot; and are equivalent to terms in combinatory logic.

== Reduction ==
The meaning of lambda expressions is defined by how expressions can be reduced.

There are three kinds of reduction:
* &quot;α-conversion&quot;: changing bound variables;
* &quot;β-reduction&quot;: applying functions to their arguments;
* &quot;η-conversion&quot;: expressing extensionality.

We also speak of the resulting equivalences: two expressions are &quot;α-equivalent&quot;, if they can be α-converted into the same expression. β-equivalence and η-equivalence are defined similarly.

The term &quot;redex&quot;, short for &quot;reducible expression&quot;, refers to subterms that can be reduced by one of the reduction rules. For example, (λ&quot;x&quot;.&quot;M&quot;) &quot;N&quot; is a β-redex in expressing the substitution of &quot;N&quot; for &quot;x&quot; in &quot;M&quot;. The expression to which a redex reduces is called its &quot;reduct&quot;; the reduct of (λ&quot;x&quot;.&quot;M&quot;) &quot;N&quot; is &quot;M&quot;[&quot;x&quot; := &quot;N&quot;].

If &quot;x&quot; is not free in &quot;M&quot;, λ&quot;x&quot;.&quot;M x&quot; is also an η-redex, with a reduct of &quot;M&quot;.

=== α-conversion ===
α-conversion (alpha-conversion), sometimes known as α-renaming, allows bound variable names to be changed. For example, α-conversion of λ&quot;x&quot;.&quot;x&quot; might yield λ&quot;y&quot;.&quot;y&quot;. Terms that differ only by α-conversion are called &quot;α-equivalent&quot;. Frequently, in uses of lambda calculus, α-equivalent terms are considered to be equivalent.

The precise rules for α-conversion are not completely trivial. First, when α-converting an abstraction, the only variable occurrences that are renamed are those that are bound to the same abstraction. For example, an α-conversion of λ&quot;x&quot;.λ&quot;x&quot;.&quot;x&quot; could result in λ&quot;y&quot;.λ&quot;x&quot;.&quot;x&quot;, but it could &quot;not&quot; result in λ&quot;y&quot;.λ&quot;x&quot;.&quot;y&quot;. The latter has a different meaning from the original. This is analogous to the programming notion of variable shadowing.

Second, α-conversion is not possible if it would result in a variable getting captured by a different abstraction. For example, if we replace &quot;x&quot; with &quot;y&quot; in λ&quot;x&quot;.λ&quot;y&quot;.&quot;x&quot;, we get λ&quot;y&quot;.λ&quot;y&quot;.&quot;y&quot;, which is not at all the same.

In programming languages with static scope, α-conversion can be used to make name resolution simpler by ensuring that no variable name masks a name in a containing scope (see α-renaming to make name resolution trivial).

In the De Bruijn index notation, any two α-equivalent terms are syntactically identical.

==== Substitution ====
Substitution, written &quot;M&quot;[&quot;x&quot; := &quot;N&quot;], is the process of replacing all &quot;free&quot; occurrences of the variable &quot;x&quot; in the expression &quot;M&quot; with expression &quot;N&quot;. Substitution on terms of the lambda calculus is defined by recursion on the structure of terms, as follows (note: x and y are only variables while M and N are any lambda expression):

: &quot;x&quot;[&quot;x&quot; := &quot;N&quot;] = &quot;N&quot;
: &quot;y&quot;[&quot;x&quot; := &quot;N&quot;] = &quot;y&quot;, if &quot;x&quot; ≠ &quot;y&quot;
: (&quot;M&quot;1 &quot;M&quot;2)[&quot;x&quot; := &quot;N&quot;] = &quot;M&quot;1[&quot;x&quot; := &quot;N&quot;] &quot;M&quot;2[&quot;x&quot; := &quot;N&quot;]
: (λ&quot;x&quot;.&quot;M&quot;)[&quot;x&quot; := &quot;N&quot;] = λ&quot;x&quot;.&quot;M&quot;
: (λ&quot;y&quot;.&quot;M&quot;)[&quot;x&quot; := &quot;N&quot;] = λ&quot;y&quot;.(&quot;M&quot;[&quot;x&quot; := &quot;N&quot;]), if &quot;x&quot; ≠ &quot;y&quot; and &quot;y&quot; ∉ FV(&quot;N&quot;) &quot;See above for the FV&quot;

To substitute into an abstraction, it is sometimes necessary to α-convert the expression. For example, it is not correct for (λ&quot;x&quot;.&quot;y&quot;)[&quot;y&quot; := &quot;x&quot;] to result in λ&quot;x&quot;.&quot;x&quot;, because the substituted &quot;x&quot; was supposed to be free but ended up being bound. The correct substitution in this case is λ&quot;z&quot;.&quot;x&quot;, up to α-equivalence. Substitution is defined uniquely up to α-equivalence. &quot;See Capture-avoiding substitutions above&quot;

=== β-reduction ===
β-reduction (beta reduction) captures the idea of function application. β-reduction is defined in terms of substitution: the β-reduction of (λ&quot;x&quot;.&quot;M&quot;) &quot;N&quot; is &quot;M&quot;[&quot;x&quot; := &quot;N&quot;].

For example, assuming some encoding of 2, 7, ×, we have the following β-reduction: (λ&quot;n&quot;.&quot;n&quot; × 2) 7 → 7 × 2.

β-reduction can be seen to be the same as the concept of &quot;local reducibility&quot; in natural deduction, via the Curry–Howard isomorphism.

=== η-conversion ===
η-conversion (eta conversion) expresses the idea of extensionality, which in this context is that two functions are the same if and only if they give the same result for all arguments. η-conversion converts between λ&quot;x&quot;.&quot;f&quot; &quot;x&quot; and &quot;f&quot; whenever &quot;x&quot; does not appear free in &quot;f&quot;. 

η-reduction changes λ&quot;x&quot;.&quot;f&quot; &quot;x&quot; to &quot;f&quot;, and η-expansion changes &quot;f&quot; to λ&quot;x&quot;.&quot;f&quot; &quot;x&quot;, under the same requirement that &quot;x&quot; does not appear free in &quot;f&quot;.

η-conversion can be seen to be the same as the concept of &quot;local completeness&quot; in natural deduction, via the Curry–Howard isomorphism.

== Normal forms and confluence ==

For the untyped lambda calculus, β-reduction as a rewriting rule is neither strongly normalising nor weakly normalising.

However, it can be shown that β-reduction is confluent when working up to α-conversion (i.e. we consider two normal forms to be equal if it is possible to α-convert one into the other).

Therefore, both strongly normalising terms and weakly normalising terms have a unique normal form. For strongly normalising terms, any reduction strategy is guaranteed to yield the normal form, whereas for weakly normalising terms, some reduction strategies may fail to find it.

== Encoding datatypes ==

The basic lambda calculus may be used to model arithmetic, Booleans, data structures, and recursion, as illustrated in the following sub-sections &quot;i&quot;, &quot;ii&quot;, &quot;iii&quot;, and &quot;§ iv&quot;.

=== Arithmetic in lambda calculus ===
There are several possible ways to define the natural numbers in lambda calculus, but by far the most common are the Church numerals, which can be defined as follows:
: 
: 
and so on. Or using the alternative syntax presented above in &quot;Notation&quot;:
: 
: 

A Church numeral is a higher-order function—it takes a single-argument function , and returns another single-argument function. The Church numeral is a function that takes a function as argument and returns the -th composition of , i.e. the function composed with itself times. This is denoted and is in fact the -th power of (considered as an operator); is defined to be the identity function. Such repeated compositions (of a single function ) obey the laws of exponents, which is why these numerals can be used for arithmetic. (In Church&#x27;s original lambda calculus, the formal parameter of a lambda expression was required to occur at least once in the function body, which made the above definition of impossible.)

One way of thinking about the Church numeral , which is often useful when analysing programs, is as an instruction &#x27;repeat &quot;n&quot; times&#x27;. For example, using the and functions defined below, one can define a function that constructs a (linked) list of &quot;n&quot; elements all equal to &quot;x&quot; by repeating &#x27;prepend another &quot;x&quot; element&#x27; &quot;n&quot; times, starting from an empty list. The lambda term is
By varying what is being repeated, and varying what argument that function being repeated is applied to, a great many different effects can be achieved.

We can define a successor function, which takes a Church numeral and returns by adding another application of , where &#x27;(mf)x&#x27; means the function &#x27;f&#x27; is applied &#x27;m&#x27; times on &#x27;x&#x27;:
Because the -th composition of composed with the -th composition of gives the -th composition of , addition can be defined as follows:
 can be thought of as a function taking two natural numbers as arguments and returning a natural number; it can be verified that
and
are β-equivalent lambda expressions. Since adding to a number can be accomplished by adding 1 times, an alternative definition is:
Similarly, multiplication can be defined as
Alternatively
since multiplying and is the same as repeating the add function times and then applying it to zero.
Exponentiation has a rather simple rendering in Church numerals, namely
The predecessor function defined by for a positive integer and is considerably more difficult. The formula
can be validated by showing inductively that if &quot;T&quot; denotes , then for . Two other definitions of are given below, one using conditionals and the other using pairs. With the predecessor function, subtraction is straightforward. Defining
 yields when and otherwise.

=== Logic and predicates ===
By convention, the following two definitions (known as Church Booleans) are used for the Boolean values and :
: 
Then, with these two lambda terms, we can define some logic operators (these are just possible formulations; other expressions could be equally correct):
: 
: 
We are now able to compute some logic functions, for example:
:: 
and we see that is equivalent to .

A &quot;predicate&quot; is a function that returns a Boolean value. The most fundamental predicate is , which returns if its argument is the Church numeral , but if its argument were any other Church numeral:
The following predicate tests whether the first argument is less-than-or-equal-to the second:
and since , if and , it is straightforward to build a predicate for numerical equality.

The availability of predicates and the above definition of and make it convenient to write &quot;if-then-else&quot; expressions in lambda calculus. For example, the predecessor function can be defined as:
which can be verified by showing inductively that is the add − 1 function for &gt; 0.

=== Pairs ===
A pair (2-tuple) can be defined in terms of and , by using the Church encoding for pairs. For example, encapsulates the pair (,), returns the first element of the pair, and returns the second.
: 
: 

A linked list can be defined as either NIL for the empty list, or the of an element and a smaller list. The predicate tests for the value . (Alternatively, with , the construct obviates the need for an explicit NULL test).

As an example of the use of pairs, the shift-and-increment function that maps to can be defined as
which allows us to give perhaps the most transparent version of the predecessor function:

== Additional programming techniques ==
There is a considerable body of programming idioms for lambda calculus. Many of these were originally developed in the context of using lambda calculus as a foundation for programming language semantics, effectively using lambda calculus as a low-level programming language. Because several programming languages include the lambda calculus (or something very similar) as a fragment, these techniques also see use in practical programming, but may then be perceived as obscure or foreign.

=== Named constants ===
In lambda calculus, a library would take the form of a collection of previously defined functions, which as lambda-terms are merely particular constants. The pure lambda calculus does not have a concept of named constants since all atomic lambda-terms are variables, but one can emulate having named constants by setting aside a variable as the name of the constant, using abstraction to bind that variable in the main body, and apply that abstraction to the intended definition. Thus to use to mean &quot;N&quot; (some explicit lambda-term) in &quot;M&quot; (another lambda-term, the &quot;main program&quot;), one can say
: &quot;M&quot; &quot;N&quot;
Authors often introduce syntactic sugar, such as , to permit writing the above in the more intuitive order
: &quot;N&quot; &quot;M&quot;
By chaining such definitions, one can write a lambda calculus &quot;program&quot; as zero or more function definitions, followed by one lambda-term using those functions that constitutes the main body of the program.

A notable restriction of this is that the name may not be referenced in &quot;N&quot;, for &quot;N&quot; is outside the scope of the abstraction binding , which is &quot;M&quot;; this means a recursive function definition cannot be written with . The construction would allow writing recursive function definitions, where the scope of the abstraction binding includes &quot;N&quot; as well as &quot;M&quot;. Or self-application a-la that which leads to combinator could be used.

=== Recursion and fixed points ===
Recursion is the definition of a function invoking itself. A definition containing itself inside itself, by value, leads to the whole value being of infinite size. Other notations which support recursion natively overcome this by referring to the function definition &quot;by name&quot;. Lambda calculus cannot express this: all functions are anonymous in lambda calculus, so we can&#x27;t refer by name to a value which is yet to be defined, inside the lambda term defining that same value. However, a lambda expression can receive itself as its own argument, for example in . Here &quot;E&quot; should be an abstraction, applying its parameter to a value to express recursion.

Consider the factorial function recursively defined by

In the lambda expression which is to represent this function, a &quot;parameter&quot; (typically the first one) will be assumed to receive the lambda expression itself as its value, so that calling it – applying it to an argument – will amount to recursion. Thus to achieve recursion, the intended-as-self-referencing argument (called here) must always be passed to itself within the function body, at a call point:
::: with to hold, so and

The self-application achieves replication here, passing the function&#x27;s lambda expression on to the next invocation as an argument value, making it available to be referenced and called there.

This solves it but requires re-writing each recursive call as self-application. We would like to have a generic solution, without a need for any re-writes:
::: with to hold, so and
: where 
::: so that 

Given a lambda term with first argument representing recursive call (e.g. here), the &quot;fixed-point&quot; combinator will return a self-replicating lambda expression representing the recursive function (here, ). The function does not need to be explicitly passed to itself at any point, for the self-replication is arranged in advance, when it is created, to be done each time it is called. Thus the original lambda expression is re-created inside itself, at call-point, achieving self-reference.

In fact, there are many possible definitions for this operator, the simplest of them being:

In the lambda calculus, is a fixed-point of , as it expands to:
: 
: 

Now, to perform the recursive call to the factorial function for an argument &quot;n&quot;, we would simply call . Given &quot;n&quot; = 4, for example, this gives:

Every recursively defined function can be seen as a fixed point of some suitably defined higher order function (also known as functional) closing over the recursive call with an extra argument, and therefore, using , every recursively defined function can be expressed as a lambda expression. In particular, we can now cleanly define the subtraction, multiplication and comparison predicate of natural numbers recursively.

When Y combinator is coded directly in a strict programming language, the applicative order of evaluation used in such languages will cause the attempt to fully expand the internal self-application formula_141 right away, causing stack overflow or, in case of tail call optimization, indefinite looping. A delayed variant of Y, the Z combinator, can be used in such languages. It has the internal self-application hidden behind an extra abstraction through eta-expansion, as formula_142, thus preventing its premature expansion:
: formula_143

=== Standard terms ===
Certain terms have commonly accepted names:

the next section. is , the smallest term that has no normal form. is another such term.
 is standard and defined above, and can also be defined as , so that . and defined above are commonly abbreviated as and .

=== Abstraction elimination ===

If &quot;N&quot; is a lambda-term without abstraction, but possibly containing named constants (combinators), then there exists a lambda-term &quot;T&quot;(,&quot;N&quot;) which is equivalent to &quot;N&quot; but lacks abstraction (except as part of the named constants, if these are considered non-atomic). This can also be viewed as anonymising variables, as &quot;T&quot;(,&quot;N&quot;) removes all occurrences of from &quot;N&quot;, while still allowing argument values to be substituted into the positions where &quot;N&quot; contains an . The conversion function &quot;T&quot; can be defined by:
: &quot;T&quot;(, ) := I
: &quot;T&quot;(, &quot;N&quot;) := K &quot;N&quot; if is not free in &quot;N&quot;.
: &quot;T&quot;(, &quot;M&quot; &quot;N&quot;) := S &quot;T&quot;(, &quot;M&quot;) &quot;T&quot;(, &quot;N&quot;)
In either case, a term of the form &quot;T&quot;(,&quot;N&quot;) &quot;P&quot; can reduce by having the initial combinator I, K, or S grab the argument &quot;P&quot;, just like β-reduction of &quot;N&quot; &quot;P&quot; would do. I returns that argument. K throws the argument away, just like &quot;N&quot; would do if has no free occurrence in &quot;N&quot;. S passes the argument on to both subterms of the application, and then applies the result of the first to the result of the second.

The combinators B and C are similar to S, but pass the argument on to only one subterm of an application (B to the &quot;argument&quot; subterm and C to the &quot;function&quot; subterm), thus saving a subsequent K if there is no occurrence of in one subterm. In comparison to B and C, the S combinator actually conflates two functionalities: rearranging arguments, and duplicating an argument so that it may be used in two places. The W combinator does only the latter, yielding the B, C, K, W system as an alternative to SKI combinator calculus.

== Typed lambda calculus ==

A &quot;typed lambda calculus&quot; is a typed formalism that uses the lambda-symbol (formula_144) to denote anonymous function abstraction. In this context, types are usually objects of a syntactic nature that are assigned to lambda terms; the exact nature of a type depends on the calculus considered (see Kinds of typed lambda calculi). From a certain point of view, typed lambda calculi can be seen as refinements of the untyped lambda calculus but from another point of view, they can also be considered the more fundamental theory and &quot;untyped lambda calculus&quot; a special case with only one type.

Typed lambda calculi are foundational programming languages and are the base of typed functional programming languages such as ML and Haskell and, more indirectly, typed imperative programming languages. Typed lambda calculi play an important role in the design of type systems for programming languages; here typability usually captures desirable properties of the program, e.g., the program will not cause a memory access violation.

Typed lambda calculi are closely related to mathematical logic and proof theory via the Curry–Howard isomorphism and they can be considered as the internal language of classes of categories, e.g., the simply typed lambda calculus is the language of a Cartesian closed category (CCC).

== Reduction strategies ==

Whether a term is normalising or not, and how much work needs to be done in normalising it if it is, depends to a large extent on the reduction strategy used. Common lambda calculus reduction strategies include:
; Normal order: The leftmost outermost redex is reduced first. That is, whenever possible, arguments are substituted into the body of an abstraction before the arguments are reduced. If a term has a beta-normal form, normal order reduction will always reach that normal form.
; Applicative order: The leftmost innermost redex is reduced first. As a consequence, a function&#x27;s arguments are always reduced before they are substituted into the function. Unlike normal order reduction, applicative order reduction may fail to find the beta-normal form of an expression, even if such a normal form exists. For example, the term formula_145 is reduced to itself by applicative order, while normal order reduces it to its beta-normal form formula_33.
; Full β-reductions: Any redex can be reduced at any time. This means essentially the lack of any particular reduction strategy—with regard to reducibility, &quot;all bets are off&quot;.

Weak reduction strategies do not reduce under lambda abstractions:
; Call by value: Like applicative order, but no reductions are performed inside abstractions. This is similar to the evaluation order of strict languages like C: the arguments to a function are evaluated before calling the function, and function bodies are not even partially evaluated until the arguments are substituted in.
; Call by name: Like normal order, but no reductions are performed inside abstractions. For example, is in normal form according to this strategy, although it contains the redex .

Strategies with sharing reduce computations that are &quot;the same&quot; in parallel:
; Optimal reduction: As normal order, but computations that have the same label are reduced simultaneously.
; Call by need: As call by name (hence weak), but function applications that would duplicate terms instead name the argument. The argument may be evaluated &quot;when needed&quot;, at which point the name binding is updated with the reduced value. This can save time compared to normal order evaluation.

== Computability ==
There is no algorithm that takes as input any two lambda expressions and outputs or depending on whether one expression reduces to the other. More precisely, no computable function can decide the question. This was historically the first problem for which undecidability could be proven. As usual for such a proof, &quot;computable&quot; means computable by any model of computation that is Turing complete. In fact computability can itself be defined via the lambda calculus: a function &quot;F&quot;: N → N of natural numbers is a computable function if and only if there exists a lambda expression &quot;f&quot; such that for every pair of &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; in N, &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)=&quot;y&quot; if and only if &quot;f&quot;  =β , where and are the Church numerals corresponding to &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, respectively and =β meaning equivalence with β-reduction. See the Church–Turing thesis for other approaches to defining computability and their equivalence.

Church&#x27;s proof of uncomputability first reduces the problem to determining whether a given lambda expression has a normal form. Then he assumes that this predicate is computable, and can hence be expressed in lambda calculus. Building on earlier work by Kleene and constructing a Gödel numbering for lambda expressions, he constructs a lambda expression that closely follows the proof of Gödel&#x27;s first incompleteness theorem. If is applied to its own Gödel number, a contradiction results.

== Complexity ==
The notion of computational complexity for the lambda calculus is a bit tricky, because the cost of a β-reduction may vary depending on how it is implemented. 
To be precise, one must somehow find the location of all of the occurrences of the bound variable in the expression , implying a time cost, or one must keep track of the locations of free variables in some way, implying a space cost. A naïve search for the locations of in is &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) in the length &quot;n&quot; of . Director strings were an early approach that traded this time cost for a quadratic space usage. More generally this has led to the study of systems that use explicit substitution.

In 2014, it was shown that the number of β-reduction steps taken by normal order reduction to reduce a term is a &quot;reasonable&quot; time cost model, that is, the reduction can be simulated on a Turing machine in time polynomially proportional to the number of steps. This was a long-standing open problem, due to &quot;size explosion&quot;, the existence of lambda terms which grow exponentially in size for each β-reduction. The result gets around this by working with a compact shared representation. The result makes clear that the amount of space needed to evaluate a lambda term is not proportional to the size of the term during reduction. It is not currently known what a good measure of space complexity would be.

An unreasonable model does not necessarily mean inefficient. Optimal reduction reduces all computations with the same label in one step, avoiding duplicated work, but the number of parallel β-reduction steps to reduce a given term to normal form is approximately linear in the size of the term. This is far too small to be a reasonable cost measure, as any Turing machine may be encoded in the lambda calculus in size linearly proportional to the size of the Turing machine. The true cost of reducing lambda terms is not due to β-reduction per se but rather the handling of the duplication of redexes during β-reduction. It is not known if optimal reduction implementations are reasonable when measured with respect to a reasonable cost model such as the number of leftmost-outermost steps to normal form, but it has been shown for fragments of the lambda calculus that the optimal reduction algorithm is efficient and has at most a quadratic overhead compared to leftmost-outermost. In addition the BOHM prototype implementation of optimal reduction outperformed both Caml Light and Haskell on pure lambda terms.

== Lambda calculus and programming languages ==
As pointed out by Peter Landin&#x27;s 1965 paper &quot;A Correspondence between ALGOL 60 and Church&#x27;s Lambda-notation&quot;, sequential procedural programming languages can be understood in terms of the lambda calculus, which provides the basic mechanisms for procedural abstraction and procedure (subprogram) application.

=== Anonymous functions ===

For example, in Python the &quot;square&quot; function can be expressed as a lambda expression as follows:
(lambda x: x**2)
The above example is an expression that evaluates to a first-class function. The symbol codice_1 creates an anonymous function, given a list of parameter names, codice_2 – just a single argument in this case, and an expression that is evaluated as the body of the function, codice_3. Anonymous functions are sometimes called lambda expressions.

For example, Pascal and many other imperative languages have long supported passing subprograms as arguments to other subprograms through the mechanism of function pointers. However, function pointers are an insufficient condition for functions to be first class datatypes, because a function is a first class datatype if and only if new instances of the function can be created at runtime. Such runtime creation of functions is supported in Smalltalk, JavaScript, Wolfram Language, and more recently in Scala, Eiffel (as agents), C# (as delegates) and C++11, among others.

=== Parallelism and concurrency ===
The Church–Rosser property of the lambda calculus means that evaluation (β-reduction) can be carried out in &quot;any order&quot;, even in parallel. This means that various nondeterministic evaluation strategies are relevant. However, the lambda calculus does not offer any explicit constructs for parallelism. One can add constructs such as futures to the lambda calculus. Other process calculi have been developed for describing communication and concurrency.

== Semantics ==
The fact that lambda calculus terms act as functions on other lambda calculus terms, and even on themselves, led to questions about the semantics of the lambda calculus. Could a sensible meaning be assigned to lambda calculus terms? The natural semantics was to find a set &quot;D&quot; isomorphic to the function space &quot;D&quot; → &quot;D&quot;, of functions on itself. However, no nontrivial such &quot;D&quot; can exist, by cardinality constraints because the set of all functions from &quot;D&quot; to &quot;D&quot; has greater cardinality than &quot;D&quot;, unless &quot;D&quot; is a singleton set.

In the 1970s, Dana Scott showed that if only continuous functions were considered, a set or domain &quot;D&quot; with the required property could be found, thus providing a model for the lambda calculus.

This work also formed the basis for the denotational semantics of programming languages.

== Variations and extensions ==
These extensions are in the lambda cube:
* Typed lambda calculus – Lambda calculus with typed variables (and functions)
* System F – A typed lambda calculus with type-variables
* Calculus of constructions – A typed lambda calculus with types as first-class values

These formal systems are extensions of lambda calculus that are not in the lambda cube:
* Binary lambda calculus – A version of lambda calculus with binary input/output (I/O), a binary encoding of terms, and a designated universal machine.
* Lambda-mu calculus – An extension of the lambda calculus for treating classical logic

These formal systems are variations of lambda calculus:
* Kappa calculus – A first-order analogue of lambda calculus

These formal systems are related to lambda calculus:
* Combinatory logic – A notation for mathematical logic without variables
* SKI combinator calculus – A computational system based on the S, K and I combinators, equivalent to lambda calculus, but reducible without variable substitutions

<doc id="18208" wikidata="Q55564" url="?curid=18208" title="Lossy compression">
<text>In information technology, lossy compression or irreversible compression is the class of data compression methods that uses inexact approximations and partial data discarding to represent the content. These techniques are used to reduce data size for storing, handling, and transmitting content. Higher degrees of approximation create coarser images as more details are removed. This is opposed to lossless data compression (reversible data compression) which does not degrade the data. The amount of data reduction possible using lossy compression is much higher than using lossless techniques.

Well-designed lossy compression technology often reduces file sizes significantly before degradation is noticed by the end-user. Even when noticeable by the user, further data reduction may be desirable (e.g., for real-time communication or to reduce transmission times or storage needs). The most widely used lossy compression algorithm is the discrete cosine transform (DCT), first published by Nasir Ahmed, T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao in 1974.

Lossy compression is most commonly used to compress multimedia data (audio, video, and images), especially in applications such as streaming media and internet telephony. By contrast, lossless compression is typically required for text and data files, such as bank records and text articles. It can be advantageous to make a master lossless file which can then be used to produce additional copies from. This allows one to avoid basing new compressed copies on a lossy source file, which would yield additional artifacts and further unnecessary information loss.

==Types==
It is possible to compress many types of digital data in a way that reduces the size of a computer file needed to store it, or the bandwidth needed to transmit it, with no loss of the full information contained in the original file. A picture, for example, is converted to a digital file by considering it to be an array of dots and specifying the color and brightness of each dot. If the picture contains an area of the same color, it can be compressed without loss by saying &quot;200 red dots&quot; instead of &quot;red dot, red dot, ...(197 more times)..., red dot.&quot;

The original data contains a certain amount of information, and there is a lower bound to the size of a file that can still carry all the information. Basic information theory says that there is an absolute limit in reducing the size of this data. When data is compressed, its entropy increases, and it cannot increase indefinitely. For example, a compressed ZIP file is smaller than its original, but repeatedly compressing the same file will not reduce the size to nothing. Most compression algorithms can recognize when further compression would be pointless and would in fact increase the size of the data.

In many cases, files or data streams contain more information than is needed. For example, a picture may have more detail than the eye can distinguish when reproduced at the largest size intended; likewise, an audio file does not need a lot of fine detail during a very loud passage. Developing lossy compression techniques as closely matched to human perception as possible is a complex task. Sometimes the ideal is a file that provides exactly the same perception as the original, with as much digital information as possible removed; other times, perceptible loss of quality is considered a valid tradeoff.

The terms &quot;irreversible&quot; and &quot;reversible&quot; are preferred over &quot;lossy&quot; and &quot;lossless&quot; respectively for some applications, such as medical image compression, to circumvent the negative implications of &quot;loss&quot;. The type and amount of loss can affect the utility of the images. Artifacts or undesirable effects of compression may be clearly discernible yet the result still useful for the intended purpose. Or lossy compressed images may be &#x27;visually lossless&#x27;, or in the case of medical images, so-called diagnostically acceptable irreversible compression (DAIC) may have been applied.

== Transform coding ==
Some forms of lossy compression can be thought of as an application of transform coding, which is a type of data compression used for digital images, digital audio signals, and digital video. The transformation is typically used to enable better (more targeted) quantization. Knowledge of the application is used to choose information to discard, thereby lowering its bandwidth. The remaining information can then be compressed via a variety of methods. When the output is decoded, the result may not be identical to the original input, but is expected to be close enough for the purpose of the application.

The most common form of lossy compression is a transform coding method, the discrete cosine transform (DCT), which was first published by Nasir Ahmed, T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao in 1974. DCT is the most widely used form of lossy compression, for popular image compression formats (such as JPEG), video coding standards (such as MPEG and H.264/AVC) and audio compression formats (such as MP3 and AAC).

In the case of audio data, a popular form of transform coding is perceptual coding, which transforms the raw data to a domain that more accurately reflects the information content. For example, rather than expressing a sound file as the amplitude levels over time, one may express it as the frequency spectrum over time, which corresponds more accurately to human audio perception. While data reduction (compression, be it lossy or lossless) is a main goal of transform coding, it also allows other goals: one may represent data more accurately for the original amount of space – for example, in principle, if one starts with an analog or high-resolution digital master, an MP3 file of a given size should provide a better representation than a raw uncompressed audio in WAV or AIFF file of the same size. This is because uncompressed audio can only reduce file size by lowering bit rate or depth, whereas compressing audio can reduce size while maintaining bit rate and depth. This compression becomes a selective loss of the least significant data, rather than losing data across the board. Further, a transform coding may provide a better domain for manipulating or otherwise editing the data – for example, equalization of audio is most naturally expressed in the frequency domain (boost the bass, for instance) rather than in the raw time domain.

From this point of view, perceptual encoding is not essentially about &quot;discarding&quot; data, but rather about a &quot;better representation&quot; of data. Another use is for backward compatibility and graceful degradation: in color television, encoding color via a luminance-chrominance transform domain (such as YUV) means that black-and-white sets display the luminance, while ignoring the color information. Another example is chroma subsampling: the use of color spaces such as YIQ, used in NTSC, allow one to reduce the resolution on the components to accord with human perception – humans have highest resolution for black-and-white (luma), lower resolution for mid-spectrum colors like yellow and green, and lowest for red and blues – thus NTSC displays approximately 350 pixels of luma per scanline, 150 pixels of yellow vs. green, and 50 pixels of blue vs. red, which are proportional to human sensitivity to each component.

== Information loss ==
Lossy compression formats suffer from generation loss: repeatedly compressing and decompressing the file will cause it to progressively lose quality. This is in contrast with lossless data compression, where data will not be lost via the use of such a procedure. Information-theoretical foundations for lossy data compression are provided by rate-distortion theory. Much like the use of probability in optimal coding theory, rate-distortion theory heavily draws on Bayesian estimation and decision theory in order to model perceptual distortion and even aesthetic judgment.

There are two basic lossy compression schemes:

* In &quot;lossy transform codecs&quot;, samples of picture or sound are taken, chopped into small segments, transformed into a new basis space, and quantized. The resulting quantized values are then entropy coded.
* In &quot;lossy predictive codecs&quot;, previous and/or subsequent decoded data is used to predict the current sound sample or image frame. The error between the predicted data and the real data, together with any extra information needed to reproduce the prediction, is then quantized and coded.

In some systems the two techniques are combined, with transform codecs being used to compress the error signals generated by the predictive stage.

==Comparison==

The advantage of lossy methods over lossless methods is that in some cases a lossy method can produce a much smaller compressed file than any lossless method, while still meeting the requirements of the application. Lossy methods are most often used for compressing sound, images or videos. This is because these types of data are intended for human interpretation where the mind can easily &quot;fill in the blanks&quot; or see past very minor errors or inconsistencies – ideally lossy compression is transparent (imperceptible), which can be verified via an ABX test. Data files using lossy compression are smaller in size and thus cost less to store and to transmit over the Internet, a crucial consideration for streaming video services such as Netflix and streaming audio services such as Spotify.

===Transparency===

When a user acquires a lossily compressed file, (for example, to reduce download time) the retrieved file can be quite different from the original at the bit level while being indistinguishable to the human ear or eye for most practical purposes. Many compression methods focus on the idiosyncrasies of human physiology, taking into account, for instance, that the human eye can see only certain wavelengths of light. The psychoacoustic model describes how sound can be highly compressed without degrading perceived quality. Flaws caused by lossy compression that are noticeable to the human eye or ear are known as compression artifacts.

===Compression ratio===
The compression ratio (that is, the size of the compressed file compared to that of the uncompressed file) of lossy video codecs is nearly always far superior to that of the audio and still-image equivalents.

* Video can be compressed immensely (e.g., 100:1) with little visible quality loss
* Audio can often be compressed at 10:1 with almost imperceptible loss of quality
* Still images are often lossily compressed at 10:1, as with audio, but the quality loss is more noticeable, especially on closer inspection.

==Transcoding and editing==
An important caveat about lossy compression (formally transcoding), is that editing lossily compressed files causes digital generation loss from the re-encoding. This can be avoided by only producing lossy files from (lossless) originals and only editing (copies of) original files, such as images in raw image format instead of JPEG. If data which has been compressed lossily is decoded and compressed losslessly, the size of the result can be comparable with the size of the data before lossy compression, but the data already lost cannot be recovered. When deciding to use lossy conversion without keeping the original, format conversion may be needed in the future to achieve compatibility with software or devices (format shifting), or to avoid paying patent royalties for decoding or distribution of compressed files.

===Editing of lossy files===

By modifying the compressed data directly without decoding and re-encoding, some editing of lossily compressed files without degradation of quality is possible. Editing which reduces the file size as if it had been compressed to a greater degree, but without more loss than this, is sometimes also possible.

====JPEG====
The primary programs for lossless editing of JPEGs are codice_1, and the derived codice_2 (which also preserves Exif information), and Jpegcrop (which provides a Windows interface).

These allow the image to be cropped, rotated, flipped, and flopped, or even converted to grayscale (by dropping the chrominance channel). While unwanted information is destroyed, the quality of the remaining portion is unchanged.

Some other transforms are possible to some extent, such as joining images with the same encoding (composing side by side, as on a grid) or pasting images such as logos onto existing images (both via Jpegjoin), or scaling.

Some changes can be made to the compression without re-encoding:
* Optimizing the compression (to reduce size without change to the decoded image)
* Converting between progressive and non-progressive encoding.

The freeware Windows-only IrfanView has some lossless JPEG operations in its codice_3 plugin.

====Metadata====
Metadata, such as ID3 tags, Vorbis comments, or Exif information, can usually be modified or removed without modifying the underlying data.

====Downsampling/compressed representation scalability====
One may wish to downsample or otherwise decrease the resolution of the represented source signal and the quantity of data used for its compressed representation without re-encoding, as in bitrate peeling, but this functionality is not supported in all designs, as not all codecs encode data in a form that allows less important detail to simply be dropped. Some well-known designs that have this capability include JPEG 2000 for still images and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC based Scalable Video Coding for video. Such schemes have also been standardized for older designs as well, such as JPEG images with progressive encoding, and MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 Part 2 video, although those prior schemes had limited success in terms of adoption into real-world common usage. Without this capacity, which is often the case in practice, to produce a representation with lower resolution or lower fidelity than a given one, one needs to start with the original source signal and encode, or start with a compressed representation and then decompress and re-encode it (transcoding), though the latter tends to cause digital generation loss.

Another approach is to encode the original signal at several different bitrates, and then either choose which to use (as when streaming over the internet – as in RealNetworks&#x27; &quot;SureStream&quot; – or offering varying downloads, as at Apple&#x27;s iTunes Store), or broadcast several, where the best that is successfully received is used, as in various implementations of hierarchical modulation. Similar techniques are used in mipmaps, pyramid representations, and more sophisticated scale space methods. Some audio formats feature a combination of a lossy format and a lossless correction which when combined reproduce the original signal; the correction can be stripped, leaving a smaller, lossily compressed, file. Such formats include MPEG-4 SLS (Scalable to Lossless), WavPack, OptimFROG DualStream, and DTS-HD Master Audio in lossless (XLL) mode).

===Other data===
Researchers have performed lossy compression on text by either using a thesaurus to substitute short words for long ones, or generative text techniques, although these sometimes fall into the related category of lossy data conversion.

== Lowering resolution ==
A general kind of lossy compression is to lower the resolution of an image, as in image scaling, particularly decimation. One may also remove less &quot;lower information&quot; parts of an image, such as by seam carving. Many media transforms, such as Gaussian blur, are, like lossy compression, irreversible: the original signal cannot be reconstructed from the transformed signal. However, in general these will have the same size as the original, and are not a form of compression. Lowering resolution has practical uses, as the NASA New Horizons craft transmitted thumbnails of its encounter with Pluto-Charon before it sent the higher resolution images. Another solution for slow connections is the usage of Image interlacing which progressively defines the image. Thus a partial transmission is enough to preview the final image, in a lower resolution version, without creating a scaled and a full version too.

<text>Lossless compression is a class of data compression that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data with no loss of information. Lossless compression is possible because most real-world data exhibits statistical redundancy. By contrast, lossy compression permits reconstruction only of an approximation of the original data, though usually with greatly improved compression rates (and therefore reduced media sizes).

By operation of the pigeonhole principle, no lossless compression algorithm can shrink the size of all possible data: Some data will get longer by at least one symbol or bit.

Compression algorithms are usually effective for human- and machine-readable documents and cannot shrink the size of random data that contain no redundancy. Different algorithms exist that are designed either with a specific type of input data in mind or with specific assumptions about what kinds of redundancy the uncompressed data are likely to contain.

Lossless data compression is used in many applications. For example, it is used in the ZIP file format and in the GNU tool gzip. It is also often used as a component within lossy data compression technologies (e.g. lossless mid/side joint stereo preprocessing by MP3 encoders and other lossy audio encoders).

Lossless compression is used in cases where it is important that the original and the decompressed data be identical, or where deviations from the original data would be unfavourable. Common examples are executable programs, text documents, and source code. Some image file formats, like PNG or GIF, use only lossless compression, while others like TIFF and MNG may use either lossless or lossy methods. Lossless audio formats are most often used for archiving or production purposes, while smaller lossy audio files are typically used on portable players and in other cases where storage space is limited or exact replication of the audio is unnecessary.

== Techniques ==
Most lossless compression programs do two things in sequence: the first step generates a &quot;statistical model&quot; for the input data, and the second step uses this model to map input data to bit sequences in such a way that &quot;probable&quot; (i.e. frequently encountered) data will produce shorter output than &quot;improbable&quot; data.

The primary encoding algorithms used to produce bit sequences are Huffman coding (also used by the deflate algorithm) and arithmetic coding. Arithmetic coding achieves compression rates close to the best possible for a particular statistical model, which is given by the information entropy, whereas Huffman compression is simpler and faster but produces poor results for models that deal with symbol probabilities close to 1.

There are two primary ways of constructing statistical models: in a &quot;static&quot; model, the data is analyzed and a model is constructed, then this model is stored with the compressed data. This approach is simple and modular, but has the disadvantage that the model itself can be expensive to store, and also that it forces using a single model for all data being compressed, and so performs poorly on files that contain heterogeneous data. &quot;Adaptive&quot; models dynamically update the model as the data is compressed. Both the encoder and decoder begin with a trivial model, yielding poor compression of initial data, but as they learn more about the data, performance improves. Most popular types of compression used in practice now use adaptive coders.

Lossless compression methods may be categorized according to the type of data they are designed to compress. While, in principle, any general-purpose lossless compression algorithm (&quot;general-purpose&quot; meaning that they can accept any bitstring) can be used on any type of data, many are unable to achieve significant compression on data that are not of the form for which they were designed to compress. Many of the lossless compression techniques used for text also work reasonably well for indexed images.

=== Multimedia ===
These techniques take advantage of the specific characteristics of images such as the common phenomenon of contiguous 2-D areas of similar tones.
Every pixel but the first is replaced by the difference to its left neighbor. This leads to small values having a much higher probability than large values.
This is often also applied to sound files, and can compress files that contain mostly low frequencies and low volumes.
For images, this step can be repeated by taking the difference to the top pixel, and then in videos, the difference to the pixel in the next frame can be taken.

A hierarchical version of this technique takes neighboring pairs of data points, stores their difference and sum, and on a higher level with lower resolution continues with the sums. This is called discrete wavelet transform. JPEG2000 additionally uses data points from other pairs and multiplication factors to mix them into the difference. These factors must be integers, so that the result is an integer under all circumstances. So the values are increased, increasing file size, but the distribution of values could be more peaked. 

The adaptive encoding uses the probabilities from the previous sample in sound encoding, from the left and upper pixel in image encoding, and additionally from the previous frame in video encoding. In the wavelet transformation, the probabilities are also passed through the hierarchy.

=== Historical legal issues ===
Many of these methods are implemented in open-source and proprietary tools, particularly LZW and its variants. Some algorithms are patented in the United States and other countries and their legal usage requires licensing by the patent holder. Because of patents on certain kinds of LZW compression, and in particular licensing practices by patent holder Unisys that many developers considered abusive, some open source proponents encouraged people to avoid using the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) for compressing still image files in favor of Portable Network Graphics (PNG), which combines the LZ77-based deflate algorithm with a selection of domain-specific prediction filters. However, the patents on LZW expired on June 20, 2003.

Many of the lossless compression techniques used for text also work reasonably well for indexed images, but there are other techniques that do not work for typical text that are useful for some images (particularly simple bitmaps), and other techniques that take advantage of the specific characteristics of images (such as the common phenomenon of contiguous 2-D areas of similar tones, and the fact that color images usually have a preponderance of a limited range of colors out of those representable in the color space).

As mentioned previously, lossless sound compression is a somewhat specialized area. Lossless sound compression algorithms can take advantage of the repeating patterns shown by the wave-like nature of the essentially using autoregressive models to predict the &quot;next&quot; value and encoding the (possibly small) difference between the expected value and the actual data. If the difference between the predicted and the actual data (called the &quot;error&quot;) tends to be small, then certain difference values (like 0, +1, −1 etc. on sample values) become very frequent, which can be exploited by encoding them in few output bits.

It is sometimes beneficial to compress only the differences between two versions of a file (or, in video compression, of successive images within a sequence). This is called delta encoding (from the Greek letter Δ, which in mathematics, denotes a difference), but the term is typically only used if both versions are meaningful outside compression and decompression. For example, while the process of compressing the error in the above-mentioned lossless audio compression scheme could be described as delta encoding from the approximated sound wave to the original sound wave, the approximated version of the sound wave is not meaningful in any other context.

== Methods ==
No lossless compression algorithm can efficiently compress all possible data . For this reason, many different algorithms exist that are designed either with a specific type of input data in mind or with specific assumptions about what kinds of redundancy the uncompressed data are likely to contain.

===Cryptography===
Cryptosystems often compress data (the &quot;plaintext&quot;) &quot;before&quot; encryption for added security. When properly implemented, compression greatly increases the unicity distance by removing patterns that might facilitate cryptanalysis. However, many ordinary lossless compression algorithms produce headers, wrappers, tables, or other predictable output that might instead make cryptanalysis easier. Thus, cryptosystems must utilize compression algorithms whose output does not contain these predictable patterns.

===Genetics and genomics ===
Genetics compression algorithms (not to be confused with genetic algorithms) are the latest generation of lossless algorithms that compress data (typically sequences of nucleotides) using both conventional compression algorithms and specific algorithms adapted to genetic data. In 2012, a team of scientists from Johns Hopkins University published the first genetic compression algorithm that does not rely on external genetic databases for compression. HAPZIPPER was tailored for HapMap data and achieves over 20-fold compression (95% reduction in file size), providing 2- to 4-fold better compression much faster than leading general-purpose compression utilities.

Genomic sequence compression algorithms, also known as DNA sequence compressors, explore the fact that DNA sequences have characteristic properties, such as inverted repeats. The most successful compressors are XM and GeCo. For eukaryotes XM is slightly better in compression ratio, though for sequences larger than 100 MB its computational requirements are impractical.

===Executables===

Self-extracting executables contain a compressed application and a decompressor. When executed, the decompressor transparently decompresses and runs the original application. This is especially often used in demo coding, where competitions are held for demos with strict size limits, as small as 1 kilobyte.
This type of compression is not strictly limited to binary executables, but can also be applied to scripts, such as JavaScript.

== Benchmarks ==
Lossless compression algorithms and their implementations are routinely tested in head-to-head benchmarks. There are a number of better-known compression benchmarks. Some benchmarks cover only the data compression ratio, so winners in these benchmarks may be unsuitable for everyday use due to the slow speed of the top performers. Another drawback of some benchmarks is that their data files are known, so some program writers may optimize their programs for best performance on a particular data set. The winners on these benchmarks often come from the class of context-mixing compression software.

Matt Mahoney, in his February 2010 edition of the free booklet &quot;Data Compression Explained&quot;, additionally lists the following:
* The Calgary Corpus dating back to 1987 is no longer widely used due to its small size. Matt Mahoney maintained the Calgary Compression Challenge, created and maintained from May 21, 1996, through May 21, 2016, by Leonid A. Broukhis.
* The Large Text Compression Benchmark and the similar Hutter Prize both use a trimmed Wikipedia XML UTF-8 data set.
* The Generic Compression Benchmark, maintained by Matt Mahoney, tests compression of data generated by random Turing machines.
* Sami Runsas (the author of NanoZip) maintained Compression Ratings, a benchmark similar to Maximum Compression multiple file test, but with minimum speed requirements. It offered the calculator that allowed the user to weight the importance of speed and compression ratio. The top programs were fairly different due to the speed requirement. In January 2010, the top program was NanoZip followed by FreeArc, CCM, flashzip, and 7-Zip.
* The Monster of Compression benchmark by Nania Francesco Antonio tested compression on 1Gb of public data with a 40-minute time limit. In December 2009, the top ranked archiver was NanoZip 0.07a and the top ranked single file compressor was ccmx 1.30c.

The Compression Ratings website published a chart summary of the &quot;frontier&quot; in compression ratio and time.

The Compression Analysis Tool is a Windows application that enables end users to benchmark the performance characteristics of streaming implementations of LZF4, Deflate, ZLIB, GZIP, BZIP2 and LZMA using their own data. It produces measurements and charts with which users can compare the compression speed, decompression speed and compression ratio of the different compression methods and to examine how the compression level, buffer size and flushing operations affect the results.

== Limitations ==
Lossless data compression algorithms cannot guarantee compression for all input data sets. In other words, for any lossless data compression algorithm, there will be an input data set that does not get smaller when processed by the algorithm, and for any lossless data compression algorithm that makes at least one file smaller, there will be at least one file that it makes larger. This is easily proven with elementary mathematics using a counting argument called the pigeonhole principle, as follows:

* Assume that each file is represented as a string of bits of some arbitrary length.
* Suppose that there is a compression algorithm that transforms every file into an output file that is no longer than the original file, and that at least one file will be compressed into an output file that is shorter than the original file.
* Let &quot;M&quot; be the least number such that there is a file &quot;F&quot; with length &quot;M&quot; bits that compresses to something shorter. Let &quot;N&quot; be the length (in bits) of the compressed version of &quot;F&quot;.
* Because &quot;N&quot;&lt;&quot;M&quot;, every file of length &quot;N&quot; keeps its size during compression. There are 2&quot;N&quot; such files possible. Together with &quot;F&quot;, this makes 2&quot;N&quot;+1 files that all compress into one of the 2&quot;N&quot; files of length &quot;N&quot;.
* But 2&quot;N&quot; is smaller than 2&quot;N&quot;+1, so by the pigeonhole principle there must be some file of length &quot;N&quot; that is simultaneously the output of the compression function on two different inputs. That file cannot be decompressed reliably (which of the two originals should that yield?), which contradicts the assumption that the algorithm was lossless.
* We must therefore conclude that our original hypothesis (that the compression function makes no file longer) is necessarily untrue.

Most practical compression algorithms provide an &quot;escape&quot; facility that can turn off the normal coding for files that would become longer by being encoded. In theory, only a single additional bit is required to tell the decoder that the normal coding has been turned off for the entire input; however, most encoding algorithms use at least one full byte (and typically more than one) for this purpose. For example, deflate compressed files never need to grow by more than 5 bytes per 65,535 bytes of input.

In fact, if we consider files of length N, if all files were equally probable, then for any lossless compression that reduces the size of some file, the expected length of a compressed file (averaged over all possible files of length N) must necessarily be &quot;greater&quot; than N. So if we know nothing about the properties of the data we are compressing, we might as well not compress it at all. A lossless compression algorithm is useful only when we are more likely to compress certain types of files than others; then the algorithm could be designed to compress those types of data better.

Thus, the main lesson from the argument is not that one risks big losses, but merely that one cannot always win. To choose an algorithm always means implicitly to select a &quot;subset&quot; of all files that will become usefully shorter. This is the theoretical reason why we need to have different compression algorithms for different kinds of files: there cannot be any algorithm that is good for all kinds of data.

The &quot;trick&quot; that allows lossless compression algorithms, used on the type of data they were designed for, to consistently compress such files to a shorter form is that the files the algorithms are designed to act on all have some form of easily modeled redundancy that the algorithm is designed to remove, and thus belong to the subset of files that that algorithm can make shorter, whereas other files would not get compressed or even get bigger. Algorithms are generally quite specifically tuned to a particular type of file: for example, lossless audio compression programs do not work well on text files, and vice versa.

In particular, files of random data cannot be consistently compressed by any conceivable lossless data compression algorithm; indeed, this result is used to &quot;define&quot; the concept of randomness in Kolmogorov complexity.

It is provably impossible to create an algorithm that can losslessly compress any data. While there have been many claims through the years of companies achieving &quot;perfect compression&quot; where an arbitrary number &quot;N&quot; of random bits can always be compressed to &quot;N&quot; − 1 bits, these kinds of claims can be safely discarded without even looking at any further details regarding the purported compression scheme. Such an algorithm contradicts fundamental laws of mathematics because, if it existed, it could be applied repeatedly to losslessly reduce any file to length 1.

On the other hand, it has also been proven that there is no algorithm to determine whether a file is incompressible in the sense of Kolmogorov complexity. Hence it is possible that any particular file, even if it appears random, may be significantly compressed, even including the size of the decompressor. An example is the digits of the mathematical constant &quot;pi&quot;, which appear random but can be generated by a very small program. However, even though it cannot be determined whether a particular file is incompressible, a simple theorem about incompressible strings shows that over 99% of files of any given length cannot be compressed by more than one byte (including the size of the decompressor).

=== Mathematical background ===
Abstractly, a compression algorithm can be viewed as a function on sequences (normally of octets). Compression is successful if the resulting sequence is shorter than the original sequence (and the instructions for the decompression map). For a compression algorithm to be lossless, the compression map must form an injection from &quot;plain&quot; to &quot;compressed&quot; bit sequences. The pigeonhole principle prohibits a bijection between the collection of sequences of length &quot;N&quot; and any subset of the collection of sequences of length &quot;N&quot;−1. Therefore, it is not possible to produce a lossless algorithm that reduces the size of every possible input sequence.

=== Points of application in real compression theory ===
Real compression algorithm designers accept that streams of high information entropy cannot be compressed, and accordingly, include facilities for detecting and handling this condition. An obvious way of detection is applying a raw compression algorithm and testing if its output is smaller than its input. Sometimes, detection is made by heuristics; for example, a compression application may consider files whose names end in &quot;.zip&quot;, &quot;.arj&quot; or &quot;.lha&quot; uncompressible without any more sophisticated detection. A common way of handling this situation is quoting input, or uncompressible parts of the input in the output, minimizing the compression overhead. For example, the zip data format specifies the &#x27;compression method&#x27; of &#x27;Stored&#x27; for input files that have been copied into the archive verbatim.

=== The Million Random Digit Challenge ===
Mark Nelson, in response to claims of &quot;magic&quot; compression algorithms appearing in comp.compression, has constructed a 415,241 byte binary file of highly entropic content, and issued a public challenge of $100 to anyone to write a program that, together with its input, would be smaller than his provided binary data yet be able to reconstitute it without error.
A similar challenge, with $5,000 as reward, was issued by Mike Goldman.

<doc id="18210" wikidata="Q316610" url="?curid=18210" title="Larry Niven">
<text>Laurence van Cott Niven (; born April 30, 1938) is an American science fiction writer. His 1970 novel &quot;Ringworld&quot; won the Hugo, Locus, Ditmar, and Nebula awards. With Jerry Pournelle he wrote &quot;The Mote in God&#x27;s Eye&quot; (1974) and &quot;Lucifer&#x27;s Hammer&quot; (1977). The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America gave him the 2015 Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award. 

His work is primarily hard science fiction, using big science concepts and theoretical physics. It also often includes elements of detective fiction and adventure stories. His fantasy includes the series &quot;The Magic Goes Away&quot;, works of rational fantasy dealing with magic as a non-renewable resource.

==Biography==
Niven was born in Los Angeles. He is a great-grandson of Edward L. Doheny, an oil tycoon who drilled the first successful well in the Los Angeles City Oil Field in 1892, and also was subsequently implicated in the Teapot Dome scandal. Niven briefly attended the California Institute of Technology and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics (with a minor in psychology) from Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas in 1962. He also completed a year of graduate work in mathematics at the University of California, Los Angeles. On September 6, 1969, he married Marilyn Wisowaty, a science fiction and Regency literature fan.

== Work ==
Niven is the author of numerous science fiction short stories and novels, beginning with his 1964 story &quot;The Coldest Place&quot;. In this story, the coldest place concerned is the dark side of Mercury, which at the time the story was written was thought to be tidally locked with the Sun (it was found to rotate in a 2:3 resonance after Niven received payment for the story, but before it was published).

Algis Budrys said in 1968 that Niven becoming a top writer despite the New Wave was evidence that &quot;trends are for second-raters&quot;. In addition to the Nebula Award in 1970 and the Hugo and Locus awards in 1971 for &quot;Ringworld&quot;, Niven won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story for &quot;Neutron Star&quot; in 1967. He won the same award in 1972, for &quot;Inconstant Moon&quot;, and in 1975 for &quot;The Hole Man&quot;. In 1976, he won the Hugo Award for Best Novelette for &quot;The Borderland of Sol&quot;.

Niven frequently collaborated with Jerry Pournelle; they wrote nine novels together, including &quot;The Mote in God&#x27;s Eye&quot;, &quot;Lucifer&#x27;s Hammer&quot; and &quot;Footfall&quot;.

Niven has written scripts for two science fiction television series: the original &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; series and &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;, for which he adapted his early story &quot;The Soft Weapon.&quot; For &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, his story &quot;Inconstant Moon&quot; was adapted into an episode of the same name by Brad Wright.

Niven has also written for the DC Comics character Green Lantern, including in his stories hard science fiction concepts such as universal entropy and the redshift effect.

Several of his stories predicted the black market in transplant organs (&quot;organlegging&quot;).

Many of Niven&#x27;s stories—sometimes called the Tales of Known Space—take place in his Known Space universe, in which humanity shares the several habitable star systems nearest to the Sun with over a dozen alien species, including the aggressive feline Kzinti and the very intelligent but cowardly Pierson&#x27;s Puppeteers, which are frequently central characters. The &quot;Ringworld&quot; series is part of the Tales of Known Space, and Niven has shared the setting with other writers since a 1988 anthology, &quot;The Man-Kzin Wars&quot; (Baen Books, jointly edited with Jerry Pournelle and Dean Ing). There have been several volumes of short stories and novellas.

Niven has also written a logical fantasy series &quot;The Magic Goes Away&quot;, which utilizes an exhaustible resource called &quot;mana&quot; to power a rule-based &quot;technological&quot; magic. &quot;The Draco Tavern&quot; series of short stories take place in a more light-hearted science fiction universe, and are told from the point of view of the proprietor of an omni-species bar. The whimsical &quot;Svetz&quot; series consists of a collection of short stories, &quot;The Flight of the Horse&quot;, and a novel, &quot;Rainbow Mars&quot;, which involve a nominal time machine sent back to retrieve long-extinct animals, but which travels, in fact, into alternative realities and brings back mythical creatures such as a roc and a unicorn. Much of his writing since the 1970s has been in collaboration, particularly with Jerry Pournelle and Steven Barnes, but also Brenda Cooper and Edward M. Lerner.

One of Niven&#x27;s best known humorous works is &quot;Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex&quot;, in which he uses real-world physics to underline the difficulties of Superman and a human woman (Lois Lane or Lana Lang) mating.

==Influence==

In the &quot;&quot; trading card game, the card Nevinyrral&#x27;s Disk uses his name, spelled backwards. This tribute was paid because the game&#x27;s system where mana from lands is used to power spells was inspired by his book &quot;The Magic Goes Away&quot;. The card Nevinyrral, Urborg Tyrant was added in Commander Legends, adding Niven&#x27;s namesake character fully to the game.

== Politics ==
According to author Michael Moorcock, in 1967, Niven, despite being a staunch conservative, voiced opposition to the Vietnam War. However, in 1968 Niven signed an advertisement in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; in support for continued US involvement in the Vietnam War.

Niven was an adviser to Ronald Reagan on the creation of the Strategic Defense Initiative antimissile policy, as part of the Citizens&#x27; Advisory Council on National Space Policy—as covered in the BBC documentary &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; by Adam Curtis.

In 2007, Niven, in conjunction with a think tank of science fiction writers known as SIGMA, founded and led by Arlan Andrews, began advising the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as to future trends affecting terror policy and other topics. Among those topics was reducing costs for hospitals to which Niven offered the solution to spread rumors in Latino communities that organs were being harvested illegally in hospitals.

==Niven&#x27;s laws==
Larry Niven is also known in science fiction fandom for &quot;Niven&#x27;s Law&quot;: &quot;There is no cause so right that one cannot find a fool following it.&quot; Over the course of his career Niven has added to this first law a list of Niven&#x27;s Laws which he describes as &quot;how the Universe works&quot; as far as he can tell.

<doc id="18212" wikidata="Q131669" url="?curid=18212" title="Linux distribution">
<text>A Linux distribution (often abbreviated as distro) is an operating system that includes the Linux kernel for its kernel functionality. Although the name does not imply product distribution per se, a distro, if distributed on its own, is often obtained via a website intended specifically for the purpose. Distros have been designed for a wide variety of systems ranging from personal computers (for example, Linux Mint) to servers (for example, Red Hat Enterprise Linux) and from embedded devices (for example, OpenWrt) to supercomputers (for example, Rocks Cluster Distribution).

A distro typically includes many components in addition to the Linux kernel. Commonly, it includes a package manager, an init system (such as systemd, OpenRC, or runit), GNU tools and libraries, documentation, IP network configuration utilities, the getty TTY setup program, and many more. To provide a desktop experience (most commonly the Mesa userspace graphics drivers) a display server (the most common being the X.org Server, or, more recently, a Wayland compositor such as Sway, KDE&#x27;s KWin, or GNOME&#x27;s Mutter), a desktop environment (most commonly GNOME, KDE Plasma, or Xfce), a sound server (usually either PulseAudio or more recently PipeWire), and other related programs may be included or installed by the user.

Typically, most of the included software is free and open-source software made available both as binary for convenience and as source code to allow for modifying it. A distro may also include proprietary software that is not available in source code form, such as a device driver binary.

A distro may be described as a particular assortment of application and utility software (various GNU tools and libraries, for example), packaged with the Linux kernel in such a way that its capabilities meet users&#x27; needs. The software is usually adapted to the distribution and then combined into software packages by the distribution&#x27;s maintainers. The software packages are available online in repositories, which are storage locations usually distributed around the world. Beside &quot;glue&quot; components, such as the distribution installers (for example, Debian-Installer and Anaconda) and the package management systems, very few packages are actually written by a distribution&#x27;s maintainers.

Distributions have been designed for a wide range of computing environments, including desktops, servers, laptops, netbooks, mobile devices (phones and tablets), and embedded systems. There are commercially backed distributions, such as Fedora Linux (Red Hat), openSUSE (SUSE) and Ubuntu (Canonical Ltd.), and entirely community-driven distributions, such as Debian, Slackware, Gentoo and Arch Linux. Most distributions come ready-to-use and prebuilt for a specific instruction set, while some (such as Gentoo) are distributed mostly in source code form and must be built before installation.

== History ==
Linus Torvalds developed the Linux kernel and distributed its first version, 0.01, in 1991. Linux was initially distributed as source code only, and later as a pair of downloadable floppy disk images: one bootable and containing the Linux kernel itself, and the other with a set of GNU utilities and tools for setting up a file system. Since the installation procedure was complicated, especially in the face of growing amounts of available software, distributions sprang up to simplify it.

Early distributions included:
* Torvalds&#x27; &quot;Boot-Root&quot; images, later maintained by Jim Winstead Jr., the aforementioned disk image pair with the kernel and the absolute minimal tools to get started (4 November 1991)
* MCC Interim Linux (3 March 1992)
* Softlanding Linux System (SLS) which included the X Window System and was the most comprehensive distribution for a short time (15 August 1992)
* H.J. Lu&#x27;s &quot;&quot;bootable rootdisks&quot; (23 September 1992), and &quot;Linux Base System&quot;&quot; (5 October 1992)
* Yggdrasil Linux/GNU/X, a commercial distribution (8 December 1992)

The two oldest, still active distribution projects started in 1993. The SLS distribution was not well maintained, so in July 1993 a new SLS-based distribution, Slackware, was released by Patrick Volkerding. Also dissatisfied with SLS, Ian Murdock set to create a free distribution by founding Debian in August 1993, with first public BETA released in January 1994 and first stable version in June 1996.

Users were attracted to Linux distributions as alternatives to the DOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems on IBM PC compatible computers, Mac OS on the Apple Macintosh, and proprietary versions of Unix. Most early adopters were familiar with Unix from work or school. They embraced Linux distributions for their low (or absent) cost, and the availability of the source code for most or all of their software.

As of 2024, Linux has become more popular in server and embedded devices markets than in the desktop market. It is used in approximately 58.9% of web servers; its current operating system market share is about 3.67%.

==Components==
Many Linux distributions provide an installation system akin to that provided with other modern operating systems. Other distributions, including Gentoo Linux, provide only the binaries of a basic kernel, compilation tools, and an installer; the installer compiles all the requested software for the specific architecture of the user&#x27;s computer, using these tools and the software&#x27;s source code.

===Package management===
Distributions are normally segmented into &quot;packages&quot;. Each package contains a specific application or service. Examples of packages are a library for handling the PNG image format, a collection of fonts, and a web browser.

The package is typically provided as compiled code, with installation and removal of packages handled by a package management system (PMS) rather than a simple file archiver. Each package intended for such a PMS contains meta-information such as its description, version number, and its dependencies (other packages it requires to run). The package management system evaluates this meta-information to allow package searches, perform automatic upgrades to newer versions, and to check that all dependencies of a package are present (and either notify the user to install them, or install them automatically). The package can also be provided as source code to be compiled on the system.

Most distributions install packages, including the kernel and other core operating system components, in a predetermined configuration. A few now require or permit configuration adjustments at first install time. This makes installation less daunting, particularly for new users, but is not always acceptable. For specific requirements, much software must be carefully configured to be useful, to work correctly with other software, or to be secure, and local administrators are often obliged to spend time reviewing and reconfiguring it.

Some (but not all) distributions go to considerable lengths to adjust and customize the software they include, and some provide configuration tools to help users do so.

By obtaining and installing &quot;everything&quot; normally provided in a distribution, an administrator may create a &quot;distributionless&quot; installation. It is possible to build such systems from scratch, avoiding distributions altogether. One needs a way to generate the first binaries until the system is &quot;self-hosting&quot;. This can be done via compilation on another system capable of building binaries for the intended target (possibly by cross-compilation). For example, see Linux From Scratch.

==Types and trends==
In broad terms, Linux distributions may be:
* Commercial or non-commercial
* Designed for enterprise users, power users, or for home users
* Supported on multiple types of hardware, or platform-specific, even to the extent of certification by the platform vendor
* Designed for servers, desktops, or embedded devices
* General purpose or highly specialized toward specific machine functionalities (e.g. firewalls, network routers, and computer clusters)
* Targeted at specific user groups, for example through language internationalization and localization, or through inclusion of many music production or scientific computing packages
* Built primarily for security, usability, portability, or comprehensiveness
* Standard release or rolling release, see below.

The diversity of Linux distributions is due to technical, organizational, and philosophical variation among vendors and users. The permissive licensing of free software means that users with sufficient knowledge and interest can customize any existing distribution, or design one to suit their own needs.

===Rolling distributions vis-à-vis standard releases===
Rolling Linux distributions are kept current using small and frequent updates. The terms &quot;partially rolling&quot; and &quot;partly rolling&quot; (along with synonyms &quot;semi-rolling&quot; and &quot;half-rolling&quot;), &quot;fully rolling&quot;, &quot;truly rolling&quot; and &quot;optionally rolling&quot; are sometimes used by software developers and users.

Repositories of rolling distributions usually contain very recent software releases—often the latest stable versions available. They have pseudo-releases and installation media that are simply snapshots of the distribution at the time of the installation image&#x27;s release. Typically, a rolling-release OS installed from older installation medium can be fully updated after it is installed.

Depending on the usage case, there can be pros and cons to both standard release and rolling release software development methodologies.

In terms of the software development process, standard releases require significant development effort to keep old versions up-to-date by propagating bug fixes back to the newest branch, versus focusing on the newest development branch. Also, unlike rolling releases, standard releases require more than one code branch to be developed and maintained, which increases the workload of the software developers and maintainers.

On the other hand, software features and technology planning are easier in standard releases due to a better understanding of upcoming features in the next version(s). Software release cycles can also be synchronized with those of major upstream software projects, such as desktop environments.

As for the user experience, standard releases are often viewed as more stable and bug-free since software conflicts can be more easily addressed and the software stack more thoroughly tested and evaluated, during the software development cycle. For this reason, they tend to be the preferred choice in enterprise environments and mission-critical tasks.

However, rolling releases offer more current software which can also provide increased stability and fewer software bugs along with the additional benefits of new features, greater functionality, faster running speeds, and improved system and application security. Regarding software security, the rolling release model can have advantages in timely security updates, fixing system or application security bugs and vulnerabilities, that standard releases may have to wait till the next release for or patch in various versions. In a rolling release distribution, where the user has &quot;chosen&quot; to run it as a highly dynamic system, the constant flux of software packages can introduce new unintended vulnerabilities.

== Installation-free distributions (live CD/USB) ==
A &quot;live&quot; distribution is a Linux distribution that can be booted from removable storage media such as optical discs or USB flash drives, instead of being installed on and booted from a hard disk drive. The portability of installation-free distributions makes them advantageous for applications such as demonstrations, borrowing someone else&#x27;s computer, rescue operations, or as installation media for a standard distribution.

When the operating system is booted from a read-only medium such as a CD or DVD, any user data that needs to be retained between sessions cannot be stored on the boot device but must be written to another storage device, such as a USB flash drive or a hard disk drive.

Many Linux distributions provide a &quot;live&quot; form in addition to their conventional form, which is a network-based or removable-media image intended to be used only for installation; such distributions include SUSE, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, MEPIS and Fedora Linux. Some distributions, including Knoppix, Puppy Linux, Devil-Linux, SuperGamer, SliTaz GNU/Linux and , are designed primarily for live use. Additionally, some minimal distributions can be run directly from as little space as one floppy disk without the need to change the contents of the system&#x27;s hard disk drive.

==Examples==

The website DistroWatch lists many Linux distributions and displays some of the ones that have the most web traffic on the site. The Wikimedia Foundation released an analysis of the browser User Agents of visitors to WMF websites until 2015, which includes details of the most popular Operating System identifiers, including some Linux distributions. Many of the popular distributions are listed below.

===Widely used GNU-based or GNU-compatible distributions===
* Debian, a non-commercial distribution and one of the earliest, maintained by a volunteer developer community with a strong commitment to free software principles and democratic project management.
** Ubuntu, a desktop and server distribution derived from Debian, maintained by British company Canonical Ltd.
*** There are several distributions based on Ubuntu that mainly replace the GNOME stock desktop environment, like: Kubuntu based on KDE, Lubuntu based on LXQT, Xubuntu based on XFCE, Ubuntu MATE based on MATE, Ubuntu Budgie based on Budgie. Other official forks have specific uses like: Ubuntu Kylin for Chinese-speaking users, or Ubuntu Studio for media content creators.
*** Linux Mint, a distribution based on and compatible with Ubuntu. Supports multiple desktop environments, among others GNOME Shell fork Cinnamon and GNOME 2 fork MATE.
*** Pop!_OS, is a Linux distribution based on Ubuntu which developed by American Linux computer manufacturer System76, and featuring a customised GNOME desktop environment known as COSMIC.
* Fedora Linux, a community distribution sponsored by American company Red Hat and the successor to the company&#x27;s previous offering, Red Hat Linux. It aims to be a technology testbed for Red Hat&#x27;s commercial Linux offering, where new open-source software is prototyped, developed, and tested in a communal setting before maturing into Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
** Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), a derivative of Fedora Linux, maintained and commercially supported by Red Hat. It seeks to provide tested, secure, and stable Linux server and workstation support to businesses.
* openSUSE, a community distribution mainly sponsored by German company SUSE.
** SUSE Linux Enterprise, derived from openSUSE, maintained and commercially supported by SUSE
* Arch Linux, a rolling release distribution targeted at experienced Linux users and maintained by a volunteer community, offers official binary packages and a wide range of unofficial user-submitted source packages. Packages are usually defined by a single PKGBUILD text file.
** Manjaro Linux, a derivative of Arch Linux that includes a graphical installer and other ease-of-use features for less experienced Linux users.
* Gentoo, a distribution targeted at power users, known for its FreeBSD Ports-like automated system for compiling applications from source code

===Linux-kernel-based operating systems===
Several operating systems include the Linux kernel, but have a userland that differs significantly from that of mainstream Linux distributions:

* Alpine Linux, which is popular on servers and uses musl C standard library and BusyBox to provide its userland.
* Android, Google&#x27;s commercial operating system based on Android OSP that runs on many devices such as smartphones, smart TVs, set-top boxes.
** There are several third-party distributions of AOSP, in turn, including: LineageOS, GrapheneOS and Android-x86.
* Chimera Linux, which is a community distribution that utilizes a FreeBSD userland, musl C standard library, Alpine Package Keeper (APK) package manager and Dinit init system. 
* ChromeOS, Google&#x27;s commercial operating system based on ChromiumOS that only runs on Chromebooks, Chromeboxes and tablet computers. Like Android, it has the Google Play Store and other Google apps. Support for applications that require GNU compatibility is available through a virtual machine called Crostini and referred to by Google as Linux support, see .

Whether such operating systems count as a &quot;Linux distribution&quot; is a controversial topic. They use the Linux kernel, so the Linux Foundation and Chris DiBona, Google&#x27;s former open-source chief, agree that Android is a Linux distribution; others, such as Google engineer Patrick Brady, disagree by noting the lack of support for many GNU tools in Android, including glibc.

Other Linux-kernel-based operating systems include Tizen, Mer/Sailfish OS, KaiOS and Amazon&#x27;s Kindle firmware.

===Lightweight distributions===

Lightweight Linux distributions are those that have been designed with support for older hardware in mind, allowing older hardware to still be used productively, or, for maximum possible speed in newer hardware by leaving more resources available for use by applications. Examples include Tiny Core Linux, Puppy Linux and Slitaz.

===Niche distributions===
Other distributions target specific niches, such as:
* Routers for example OpenWrt
* Microcontrollers without a memory management unit (MMU) for example μClinux
* Internet of things for example, targeted by Ubuntu Core and Microsoft&#x27;s Azure Sphere
* Home theater PCs for example, targeted by Plasma Bigscreen, KnoppMyth, Kodi (former XBMC) and Mythbuntu
* Specific platforms for example, Raspberry Pi OS targets the Raspberry Pi platform
* Do it yourself, that is distributions manually built from the ground up, such as Linux From Scratch.
* Education examples are Edubuntu and Karoshi, server systems based on PCLinuxOS
* Digital audio workstations for music production for example, targeted by Ubuntu Studio
* Computer security, digital forensics and penetration testing examples are Kali Linux and Parrot Security OS
* Privacy and anonymity for example, targeted by Tails, Whonix, Qubes, and FreedomBox
* Offline use for example, Endless OS 
* Gaming for example, SteamOS

==Interdistribution issues==
The Free Standards Group was an organization formed by major software and hardware vendors that aims to improve interoperability between different distributions. Among their proposed standards are the Linux Standard Base, which defines a common ABI and packaging system for Linux, and the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard which recommends a standard filenaming chart, notably the basic directory names found on the root of the tree of any Linux filesystem. Those standards, however, see limited use, even among the distributions developed by members of the organization.

The diversity of Linux distributions means that not all software runs on all distributions, depending on what libraries and other system attributes are required. Packaged software and software repositories are usually specific to a particular distribution, though cross-installation is sometimes possible on closely related distributions.

==Installation==
There are several ways to install a Linux distribution. The most common method of installing Linux is by booting from a live USB memory stick, which can be created by using a USB image writer application and the ISO image, which can be downloaded from various Linux distribution websites. DVD disks, CD disks, network installations and even other hard drives can also be used as &quot;installation media&quot;.

In the 1990s, Linux distributions were installed using sets of floppy disks but this has been abandoned by all major distributions. By the 2000s many distributions offered CD and DVD sets with the vital packages on the first disc and less important packages on later ones. Some distributions, such as Debian also enabled installation over a network after booting from either a set of floppy disks or a CD with only a small amount of data on it.

New users tend to begin by partitioning a hard drive in order to keep their previously installed operating system. The Linux distribution can then be installed on its own separate partition without affecting previously saved data.

In a Live CD setup, the computer boots the entire operating system from CD without first installing it on the computer&#x27;s hard disk. Many distributions have a Live CD &quot;installer&quot;, where the computer boots the operating system from the disk, and it can then be installed on the computer&#x27;s hard disk, providing a seamless transition from the OS running from the CD to the OS running from the hard disk.

Both servers and personal computers that come with Linux already installed are available from vendors including Hewlett-Packard, Dell and System76.

On embedded devices, Linux is typically held in the device&#x27;s firmware and may or may not be consumer-accessible.

Anaconda, one of the more popular installers, is used by Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora (which uses the Fedora Media Writer) and other distributions to simplify the installation process. Debian, Ubuntu and many others use Debian-Installer.

The process of constantly switching between distributions is often referred to as &quot;distro hopping&quot;. Virtual machine software such as VirtualBox and VMware Workstation virtualize hardware allowing users to test live media on a virtual machine without installing to the real system. Some websites like DistroWatch offer lists of distributions, and link to screenshots of operating systems as a way to get a first impression of various distributions.

===Installation via an existing operating system===
Some distributions let the user install Linux on top of their current system, such as WinLinux or coLinux. Linux is installed to the Windows hard disk partition, and can be started from inside Windows itself.

Virtual machines (such as VirtualBox or VMware) also make it possible for Linux to be run inside another OS. The VM software simulates a separate computer onto which the Linux system is installed. After installation, the virtual machine can be booted as if it were an independent computer.

Various tools are also available to perform full dual-boot installations from existing platforms without a CD, most notably:
* The (now deprecated) Wubi installer, which allows Windows users to download and install Ubuntu or its derivatives into a FAT32 or an NTFS partition without an installation CD, allowing users to easily dual boot between either operating system on the same hard drive without losing data. Replaced by Ubiquity.
* Win32-loader, which is in the process of being integrated in official Debian CDs/DVDs, and allows Windows users to install Debian without a CD, though it performs a network installation and thereby requires repartitioning
* UNetbootin, which allows Windows and Linux users to perform similar no-CD network installations for a wide variety of Linux distributions and additionally provides live USB creation support

==Proprietary software==
Some specific proprietary software products are not available in any form for Linux. As of September 2015, the Steam gaming service has over 1,500 games available on Linux, compared to 2,323 games for Mac and 6,500 Windows games. Emulation and API-translation projects like Wine and CrossOver make it possible to run non-Linux-based software on Linux systems, either by emulating a proprietary operating system or by translating proprietary API calls (e.g., calls to Microsoft&#x27;s Win32 or DirectX APIs) into native Linux API calls. A virtual machine can also be used to run a proprietary OS (like Microsoft Windows) on top of Linux.

==OEM contracts==
Computer hardware is usually sold with an operating system other than Linux already installed by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). In the case of IBM PC compatibles, the OS is usually Microsoft Windows; in the case of Apple&#x27;s Mac computers, it has always been macOS; Sun Microsystems sold SPARC hardware with the Solaris installed; video game consoles such as the Xbox, PlayStation, Wii, and the Nintendo Switch each have their own proprietary OS. This limits Linux&#x27;s market share: consumers are unaware that an alternative exists, they must make a conscious effort to use a different operating system, and they must either perform the actual installation themselves, or depend on support from a friend, relative, or computer professional.

However, it is possible to buy hardware with Linux already installed. Lenovo, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Affordy, Purism, Pine64 and System76 all sell general-purpose Linux laptops. Custom-order PC manufacturers will also build Linux systems, but possibly with the Windows key on the keyboard. Fixstars Solutions (formerly Terra Soft) sells Macintosh computers and PlayStation 3 consoles with Yellow Dog Linux installed.

It is more common to find embedded devices sold with Linux as the default manufacturer-supported OS, including the Linksys NSLU2 NAS device, TiVo&#x27;s line of personal video recorders, and Linux-based cellphones (including Android smartphones), PDAs, and portable music players.

The current Microsoft Windows license lets the manufacturer determine the refund policy. With previous versions of Windows, it was possible to obtain a refund if the manufacturer failed to provide the refund by litigation in the small claims courts. On February 15, 1999, a group of Linux users in Orange County, California held a &quot;Windows Refund Day&quot; protest in an attempt to pressure Microsoft into issuing them refunds. In France, the Linuxfrench and AFUL (French speaking Libre Software Users&#x27; Association) organizations along with free software activist Roberto Di Cosmo started a &quot;Windows Detax&quot; movement, which led to a 2006 petition against &quot;racketiciels&quot; (translation: Racketware) with 39,415 signatories and the DGCCRF branch of the French government filing several complaints against bundled software. On March 24, 2014, a new international petition was launched by AFUL on the Avaaz platform, translated into several languages and supported by many organizations around the world.

==Statistics==
There are no official figures on the popularity, adoption, downloads or installed base of Linux distributions.

There are also no official figures for the total number of Linux systems, partly due to the difficulty of quantifying the number of PCs running Linux (see Desktop Linux adoption), since many users download Linux distributions. Hence, the sales figures for Linux systems and commercial Linux distributions indicate a much lower number of Linux systems and level of Linux adoption than is the case; this is mainly due to Linux being free and open-source software that can be downloaded free of charge. A Linux Counter Project had kept track of a running guesstimate of the number of Linux systems, but did not distinguish between rolling release and standard release distributions. It ceased operation in August 2018, though a few related blog posts were created through October 2018.

Desktop usage statistical reports for particular Linux distributions have been collected and published since July 2014 by the Linux Hardware Project.

<text>The Los Angeles Dodgers are an American professional baseball team based in Los Angeles. The Dodgers compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) West Division. Founded in 1883 in Brooklyn, New York, the team joined the NL in 1890 as the Brooklyn Bridegrooms and used other monikers before settling as the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1932. From the 1940s through the mid-1950s, the Dodgers developed a fierce crosstown rivalry with the New York Yankees as the two clubs faced each other in the World Series seven times, with the Dodgers losing the first five matchups before defeating them to win the franchise&#x27;s first title in 1955. The Dodgers made history by breaking the baseball color line in 1947 with the debut of Jackie Robinson, the first African American to play in the Major Leagues since 1884. Another major milestone was reached in 1956 when Don Newcombe became the first player ever to win both the Cy Young Award and the NL MVP in the same season.

After 68 seasons in Brooklyn, Dodgers owner and president Walter O&#x27;Malley moved the franchise to Los Angeles before the 1958 season. The team played their first four seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum before moving to their current home of Dodger Stadium in 1962. The Dodgers found immediate success in Los Angeles, winning the 1959 World Series. Success continued into the 1960s; their ace pitchers Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale were the cornerstones of titles in and . In , rookie Mexican phenom pitcher Fernando Valenzuela became a sensation and led the team to a championship; he is the only player to win the Cy Young and Rookie of the Year awards in the same season. The Dodgers were once again victorious in , upsetting their heavily favored opponent in each series and becoming the only franchise to win multiple titles in the 1980s. Next came a 32-year championship drought, despite 12 postseason appearances in a 17-year span and eight consecutive division titles from 2013 to 2020. It was broken when the Dodgers won the World Series. The Dodgers signed global sensation Shohei Ohtani in 2024, who set league and franchise records with the team en route to their eighth World Series title that season.

One of the most successful and storied franchises in MLB, the Dodgers have won eight World Series championships and a record 25 National League pennants. Eleven NL MVP award winners have played for the Dodgers, winning a total of 14. Eight Cy Young Award winners have pitched for the club, winning a total of 12—by far the most of any Major League franchise. The Dodgers boast 18 Rookie of the Year Award winners, twice as many as the next club. This includes four consecutive Rookies of the Year from 1979 to 1982 and five consecutive from 1992 to 1996. From 1884 through 2024, the Dodgers&#x27; all-time record is (). Since moving to Los Angeles in 1958, the Dodgers have a win–loss record of () through the end of 2024.

Today, the Dodgers are among the most popular MLB teams, enjoying large fan support both at home and on the road; they are widely seen as one of National League&#x27;s most dominant teams. They maintain a fierce rivalry with the San Francisco Giants dating back to the two clubs&#x27; start in New York City, as well as a more recent rivalry with the American League&#x27;s Houston Astros due to the controversy over the Astros&#x27; sign stealing scandal in the 2017 World Series. As of 2024, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked the Dodgers second in MLB franchise valuation at $5.45 billion.

==History==

Although the team had no official nickname until 1932, they were informally nicknamed the Bridegrooms in the team&#x27;s earliest years, then the Superbas around the turn of the century, and then the Robins (named after manager Wilbert Robinson). In the early 1900s, sportswriter Charles Dryden nicknamed the team the Trolley Dodgers after the Brooklyn pedestrians who dodged streetcars in the city, and the Dodgers nickname was used contemporaneously with Superbas and Robins. In 1932, the team allowed the Brooklyn baseball writers to select a permanent name, and the writers chose Dodgers on January 22, 1932. The only other nickname seriously considered by the writers was Kings.

In 1941, the Dodgers captured their third National League pennant, only to lose to the New York Yankees. This marked the onset of the Dodgers–Yankees rivalry, as the Dodgers would face them in their next six World Series appearances. Led by Jackie Robinson, the first black Major League Baseball player of the modern era; and three-time National League Most Valuable Player Roy Campanella, also signed out of the Negro leagues, the Dodgers captured their first World Series title in 1955 by defeating the Yankees for the first time, a story notably described in the 1972 book &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot;.
Following the 1957 season the team left Brooklyn. In just their second season in Los Angeles, the Dodgers won their second World Series title, beating the Chicago White Sox in six games in 1959. Spearheaded by the dominant pitching style of Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale, the Dodgers captured three pennants in the 1960s and won two more World Series titles, sweeping the Yankees in four games in 1963, and edging the Minnesota Twins in seven in 1965. The 1963 sweep was their second victory against the Yankees, and their first against them as a Los Angeles team. The Dodgers won four more pennants in 1966, 1974, 1977, and 1978, but lost in each World Series appearance. They went on to win the World Series again in 1981, thanks in part to pitching sensation Fernando Valenzuela.
The early 1980s were affectionately dubbed &quot;Fernandomania&quot;. In 1988, another pitching hero, Orel Hershiser, again led them to a World Series victory, aided by one of the most memorable home runs of all time by their star outfielder Kirk Gibson coming off the bench, despite having injuries to both knees, to pinch-hit with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning of game 1, in his only appearance of the series. The Dodgers won the pennant in 2017 for the first time since their world series victory in 1988, aided by a Justin Turner walk-off home run on the same night of Gibson&#x27;s iconic walk-off home run 29 years earlier. They went on to face the Houston Astros and lost in 7 games; however, the series became embroiled in controversy due to the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal. The Dodgers won the pennant in 2018 for a second year in a row, moving on to lose to the Boston Red Sox in 5 games. They went on to win the World Series again in 2020 by defeating the Tampa Bay Rays in 6 games, after playing a season shortened to 60 games due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Dodgers share a fierce rivalry with the San Francisco Giants, dating back to when the two franchises played in New York City. Both teams moved west for the 1958 season. The Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers have appeared in the World Series 22 times, while the New York/San Francisco Giants have appeared in the World Series 20 times. The Dodgers and Giants are tied with (8) World Series titles. When the two teams were based in New York, the Giants won five World Series championships, and the Dodgers one. After the move to California, the Dodgers have won seven World Series while the Giants have won three.

In Brooklyn, the Dodgers won the NL pennant twelve times (1890, 1899, 1900, 1916, 1920, 1941, 1947, 1949, 1952, 1953, 1955, 1956) and the World Series in 1955. After moving to Los Angeles, the team won National League pennants in 1959, 1963, 1965, 1966, 1974, 1977, 1978, 1981, 1988, 2017, 2018, 2020 and 2024 with World Series championships in 1959, 1963, 1965, 1981, 1988, 2020 and 2024. In all, the Dodgers have appeared in 22 World Series: nine in Brooklyn and 13 in Los Angeles.

==Team history==
===Brooklyn Dodgers===

The Dodgers were founded in 1883 as the Brooklyn Atlantics, borrowing the name of a defunct team that had played in Brooklyn before them. The team joined the American Association in 1884 and won the AA championship in 1889 before joining the National League in 1890. They promptly won the NL Championship in their first year in the League. The team was known alternatively as the Bridegrooms, Grooms, Superbas, Robins and Trolley Dodgers, before officially becoming the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1930s.

===Jackie Robinson===

For most of the first half of the 20th century, no Major League Baseball team employed an African American player. Jackie Robinson became the first African American to play for a Major League Baseball team when he played his first major league game on April 15, 1947, as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers. This was mainly due to general manager Branch Rickey&#x27;s efforts. The deeply religious Rickey&#x27;s motivation appears to have been primarily moral, although business considerations were also a factor. Rickey was a member of The Methodist Church, the antecedent denomination to The United Methodist Church of today, which was a strong advocate for social justice and active later in the American Civil Rights Movement.

This event was the harbinger of the integration of professional sports in the United States, the concomitant demise of the Negro leagues, and is regarded as a key moment in the history of the American Civil Rights Movement. Robinson was an exceptional player, a speedy runner who sparked the team with his intensity. He was the inaugural recipient of the Rookie of the Year award, which is now named the Jackie Robinson Award in his honor. The Dodgers&#x27; willingness to integrate, when most other teams refused to, was a key factor in their 1947–1956 success. They won six pennants in those 10 years with the help of Robinson, three-time MVP Roy Campanella, Cy Young Award winner Don Newcombe, Jim Gilliam and Joe Black. Robinson would eventually go on to become the first African-American elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962.

===Move to California===
Real estate investor Walter O&#x27;Malley acquired majority ownership of the Dodgers in 1950 when he bought the 25 percent share of co-owner Branch Rickey and became allied with the widow of another equal partner, Mrs. John L. Smith. Shortly afterwards, he was working to buy new land in Brooklyn to build a more accessible and profitable ballpark than the aging Ebbets Field. Beloved as it was, Ebbets Field was no longer well-served by its aging infrastructure and the Dodgers could no longer sell out the park even in the heat of a pennant race, despite largely dominating the National League from 1946 to 1957.

O&#x27;Malley wanted to build a new, state-of-the-art stadium in Brooklyn. But City Planner Robert Moses and New York politicians refused to grant him the eminent domain authority required to build pursuant to O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s plans. To put pressure on the city, during the 1955 season, O&#x27;Malley announced that the team would play seven regular-season games and one exhibition game at Jersey City&#x27;s Roosevelt Stadium in 1956. Moses and the City considered this an empty threat, and did not believe O&#x27;Malley would go through with moving the team from New York City.

After teams began to travel to and from games by air instead of train, it became possible to include locations in the far west. Los Angeles officials attended the 1956 World Series looking to the Washington Senators to move to the West Coast. When O&#x27;Malley heard that LA was looking for a club, he sent word to the Los Angeles officials that he was interested in talking. LA offered him what New York would not: a chance to buy land suitable for building a ballpark, and own that ballpark, giving him complete control over all revenue streams. When the news came out, NYC Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr. and Moses made an offer to build a ballpark on the World&#x27;s Fair Grounds in Queens that would be shared by the Giants and Dodgers. However, O&#x27;Malley was interested in his park under only his conditions, and the plans for a new stadium in Brooklyn seemed like a pipe dream. O&#x27;Malley decided to move the Dodgers to California, convincing Giants owner Horace Stoneham to move to San Francisco instead of Minneapolis to keep the Giants-Dodgers rivalry alive on the West Coast. They were the first MLB teams both west and south of St. Louis.

The Dodgers played their final game at Ebbets Field on September 24, 1957, which the Dodgers won 2–0 over the Pittsburgh Pirates.

New York remained a one-team town with the New York Yankees until 1962, when Joan Payson founded the New York Mets and brought National League baseball back to the city. The blue background used by the Dodgers was adopted by the Mets, honoring their New York NL forebears with a blend of Dodgers blue and Giants orange.

=== Los Angeles Dodgers ===

The Dodgers were the first Major League Baseball team to ever play in Los Angeles. On April 18, 1958, the Dodgers played their first LA game, defeating the former New York and now new San Francisco Giants, 6–5, before 78,672 fans at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Catcher Roy Campanella, left partially paralyzed in an off-season accident, was never able to play in Los Angeles.
Construction on Dodger Stadium was completed in time for Opening Day 1962. With its clean, simple lines and its picturesque setting amid hills and palm trees, the ballpark quickly became an icon of the Dodgers and their new California lifestyle. O&#x27;Malley was determined that there would not be a bad seat in the house, achieving this by cantilevered grandstands that have since been widely imitated. More importantly for the team, the stadium&#x27;s spacious dimensions, along with other factors, gave defense an advantage over offense and the Dodgers moved to take advantage of this by assembling a team that would excel with its pitching.

Since moving to Los Angeles, the Dodgers have won twelve more National League Championships and seven more World Series rings. The Dodgers have had only three top-five draft picks since the MLB Draft was introduced in 1965, and have had one top-ten pick (Clayton Kershaw, No. 7) since 1985.

===Origin of the nickname===
The Dodgers&#x27; official history reports that the term &quot;Trolley Dodgers&quot; was attached to the Brooklyn ballclub due to the complex maze of trolley cars that weaved its way through the borough of Brooklyn.

In 1892, the city of Brooklyn (Brooklyn was an independent city until annexed by New York City in 1898) began replacing its slow-moving, horse-drawn trolley lines with the faster, more powerful electric trolley lines. Within less than three years, by the end of 1895, electric trolley accidents in Brooklyn had resulted in more than 130 deaths and maimed well over 500 people. Brooklyn&#x27;s high profile, the significant number of widely reported accidents, and a trolley strike in early 1895, combined to create a strong association in the public&#x27;s mind between Brooklyn and trolley dodging.

Sportswriters started using the name &quot;Trolley Dodgers&quot; to refer to the Brooklyn team early in the 1895 season. The name was shortened to, on occasion, the &quot;Brooklyn Dodgers&quot; as early as 1898.

Sportswriters in the early 20th century began referring to the Dodgers as the &quot;Bums&quot;, in reference to the team&#x27;s fans and possibly because of the &quot;street character&quot; nature of Jack Dawkins, the &quot;Artful Dodger&quot; in Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. Newspaper cartoonist Willard Mullin used a drawing of famous clown Emmett Kelly to depict &quot;Dem Bums&quot;: the team would later use &quot;Weary Willie&quot; in promotional images, and Kelly himself was a club mascot during the 1950s.

Other team names used by the franchise were the Atlantics, Grays, Grooms, Bridegrooms, Superbas, and Robins. All of these nicknames were used by fans and sportswriters to describe the team, but not in any official capacity. The team&#x27;s legal name was the Brooklyn Base Ball Club. However, the Trolley Dodger nickname was used throughout this period, simultaneously with these other nicknames, by fans and sportswriters of the day. The team did not use the name in any formal sense until 1932 when the word &quot;Dodgers&quot; appeared on team jerseys. The &quot;conclusive shift&quot; came in 1933, when both home and road jerseys for the team bore the name &quot;Dodgers&quot;.

Examples of how the many popularized names of the team were used are available from newspaper articles before 1932. A New York Times article describing a game in 1916 starts out: &quot;Jimmy Callahan, pilot of the Pirates, did his best to wreck the hopes the Dodgers have of gaining the National League pennant&quot;, but then goes on to comment: &quot;the only thing that saved the Superbas from being toppled from first place was that the Phillies lost one of the two games played&quot;. What is interesting about the use of these two nicknames is that most baseball statistics sites and baseball historians generally now refer to the pennant-winning 1916 Brooklyn team as the Robins. A 1918 New York Times article uses the nickname in its title: &quot;Buccaneers Take Last From Robins&quot;, but the subtitle of the article reads: &quot;Subdue The Superbas By 11 To 4, Making Series An Even Break&quot;.

Another example of the use of the many nicknames is found on the program issued at Ebbets Field for the 1920 World Series, which identifies the matchup in the series as &quot;Dodgers vs. Indians&quot; despite the fact that the Robins nickname had been in consistent use for around six years. The &quot;Robins&quot; nickname was derived from the name of their Hall of Fame manager, Wilbert Robinson, who led the team from 1914 to 1931.

===Uniforms===

The Dodgers&#x27; uniform has remained relatively unchanged since the 1930s. The home jersey is white with &quot;Dodgers&quot; written in script across the chest in royal. The road jersey is gray with &quot;Los Angeles&quot; written in script across the chest in royal. The word &quot;Dodgers&quot; was first used on the front of the team&#x27;s home jersey in 1933; the uniform was then white with red pinstripes and a stylized &quot;B&quot; on the left shoulder. The Dodgers also wore green outlined uniforms and green caps throughout the 1937 season but reverted to blue the following year.
The current design was created in 1939 and has remained the same ever since with only cosmetic changes. Originally intended for the 1951 World Series for which the ballclub failed to qualify, red numbers under the &quot;Dodgers&quot; script were added to the home uniform in 1952. The road jersey also has a red uniform number under the script. When the franchise moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles, the city name on the road jersey changed, and the stylized &quot;B&quot; was replaced with the interlocking &quot;LA&quot; on the caps in 1958. In 1970, the Dodgers removed the city name from the road jerseys and had &quot;Dodgers&quot; on both the home and away uniforms. The city script returned to the road jerseys in 1999, and the tradition-rich Dodgers flirted with an alternate uniform for the first time since 1944 (when all-blue satin uniforms were introduced). These 1999 alternate jerseys had a royal top with the &quot;Dodgers&quot; script in white across the chest, and the red number on the front. These were worn with white pants and a new cap with a silver brim, a top button, and a Dodger logo. These alternates proved unpopular and the team abandoned them after only one season. They would, however, bring back the blue jerseys in recent years but only wear them in spring training games. In 2014, the Dodgers introduced an alternate road jersey: a gray version with the &quot;Dodgers&quot; script instead of the city name. Since its introduction, however, the road jersey with the &quot;Dodgers&quot; script was used more often than the road jersey with the &quot;Los Angeles&quot; script, so much that the team now considers it as a primary road uniform. In 2018, the Dodgers wore their 60th anniversary patch to honor the 60 years of being in Los Angeles.

In 2021, the Dodgers again unveiled a blue alternate uniform, this time as part of the &quot;City Connect&quot; series in collaboration with Nike. This uniform was similar to the blue alternates they wore in 1999, but with the script &quot;Los Dodgers&quot; in homage to Los Angeles&#x27; Latino community. The uniform is also worn with blue pants, and black stripes are added to the sleeves. Initially, the Dodgers wore a special blue cap with the &quot;Los Dodgers&quot; script but switched in 2022 to a blue interlocking &quot;LA&quot; cap with a black brim. The &quot;Los Dodgers&quot; script was then relocated to the right side. In 2023, white pants with blue piping replaced the blue pants previously worn with the &quot;City Connect&quot; uniform.

Midway through the 2024 season, the Dodgers unveiled their second &quot;City Connect&quot; uniform. The cream-based uniform paid homage to the city of Los Angeles and various chapters of the city&#x27;s history that are connected to the team. The &quot;Los Angeles&quot; wordmark was inspired by the signage of the Dodgers&#x27; original home of Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and was slanted upward. The number font was inspired by the mid-century typefaces that were popular during the team&#x27;s early years in Los Angeles. The uniform also featured two different shades of blue: cobalt and electric, while &quot;chili red&quot; was based on the chest number colors the team had worn since the 1950s. The cobalt blue cap featured the &quot;interlocking LA&quot; and script &quot;D&quot; from the &quot;Dodgers&quot; logo merged to form the LAD team code; the said logo also appears as a sleeve patch. Above the manufacturer&#x27;s tag is the hashtag #ITFDB, a reference to broadcaster Vin Scully&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;It&#x27;s time for Dodger baseball!&quot;.

===Asian players===
The Dodgers have been groundbreaking in their signing of players from Asia; mainly Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Former owner Peter O&#x27;Malley began reaching out in 1980 by starting clinics in China and South Korea and building baseball fields in two Chinese cities. In 1998, the Dodgers became the first major league team to open an office in Asia. They were the second team to start a Japanese player (first in nearly 30 years), pitcher Hideo Nomo, the first team to start a South Korean player, pitcher Chan Ho Park and the first to start a Taiwanese player, Chin-Feng Chen. 

In addition, they were the first team to send out three Asian pitchers, from different Asian countries, in one game: Park, Hong-Chih Kuo of Taiwan, and Takashi Saito of Japan. In the 2008 season, the Dodgers had the most Asian players on its roster of any major league team with five. They included Japanese pitchers Takashi Saito and Hiroki Kuroda; South Korean pitcher Chan Ho Park; and Taiwanese pitcher Hong-Chih Kuo and infielder Chin-Lung Hu. In 2005, the Dodgers&#x27; Hee Seop Choi became the first Asian player to compete in the Home Run Derby. For the 2013 season, the Dodgers signed starting pitcher Hyun-Jin Ryu with a six-year, $36 million contract, after posting a bid of nearly $27 million to acquire him from the KBO&#x27;s Hanhwa Eagles. For the 2016 season, the Dodgers signed starting pitcher Kenta Maeda with an eight-year, $25 million contract, after posting a bid of $20 million to acquire him from the NPB&#x27;s Hiroshima Toyo Carp. For the 2024 season, the Dodgers signed free agent two-way player Shohei Ohtani with a 10-year, $700 million contract, the largest ever in professional sports history.
==Rivalries==
The Dodgers&#x27; rivalry with the San Francisco Giants dates back to the 19th century when the two teams were based in New York; the rivalry with the New York Yankees took place when the Dodgers were based in New York, but was revived with their East Coast/West Coast World Series battles in 1963, 1977, 1978, and 1981. The Dodgers&#x27; rivalries with the Philadelphia Phillies and St. Louis Cardinals also dates back to their days in New York, but were most fierce during the 1970s, 1980s, and 2000s. 

The Dodgers also shared a heated rivalry with the Cincinnati Reds during the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. The Dodgers had even shared a rather volatile rivalry with divisional foes; the Arizona Diamondbacks during most of the 2010s. Their intra-city rivalry with the Los Angeles Angels dates back to the Angels&#x27; inaugural season in 1961. The Dodgers have recently revived an old Southern California-based rivalry with the San Diego Padres dating back to the Padres&#x27; inaugural season in 1969. Most recently; the Dodgers have also regrown a heated rivalry against the former divisional foe Houston Astros after their move to the American League, due in no small part to the controversy of the 2017 World Series.

===Divisional===
====San Francisco Giants====

The Dodgers–Giants rivalry is one of the oldest and fiercest rivalries in North American sports.

The feud between the Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants began in the late 19th century when both clubs were based in New York City, with the Dodgers playing in Brooklyn and the Giants playing at the Polo Grounds in Manhattan. After the 1957 season, Dodgers owner Walter O&#x27;Malley moved the team to Los Angeles for financial and other reasons. Along the way, he managed to convince Giants owner Horace Stoneham—who was considering moving his team to Minnesota—to preserve the rivalry by bringing his team to California as well. New York baseball fans were stunned and heartbroken by the move. Given that the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco have been bitter rivals in economic, cultural, and political arenas for over a century and a half, the new venue in California became fertile ground for its transplantation.

Each team&#x27;s ability to endure for over a century while moving across an entire continent, as well as the rivalry&#x27;s leap from a cross-city to a cross-state engagement, have led to the rivalry being considered one of the greatest in American sports history.

Unlike many other historic baseball match-ups in which one team remains dominant for most of their history, the Dodgers–Giants rivalry has exhibited a persistent balance in the respective successes of the two teams. While the Giants have more wins in franchise history, the Dodgers have the most National League pennants at 24, with the Giants following close behind at 23. The Dodgers and the Giants are tied for World Series titles at eight. The 2010 World Series was the Giants&#x27; first championship since moving to California, while the Dodgers had won six World Series titles since their move, their last title coming in the 2024 World Series.

In 2021, the Dodgers and Giants both finished the regular season with over 100 wins, with the latter clinching the division with a record of 107–55. The Dodgers were one game behind with a record of 106–56, relegating them to the NL Wild Card Game, in which they defeated the St. Louis Cardinals. This resulted in the first postseason matchup between the Dodgers and Giants in the NLDS. With a combined 213 regular season wins, this is the most number of regular season wins between competing teams in any MLB postseason series. The Dodgers ultimately won in the decisive Game 5, but would lose in the NLCS to the eventual World Series champions: Atlanta Braves.

====San Diego Padres====

The Padres&#x27; rivalry with the Dodgers has often been lopsided in favor of Los Angeles; however, recent growth between the two teams in competition has added intensity on top of proximity between Los Angeles and San Diego.

The Dodgers currently lead the series 518–419, with the two teams meeting in the playoffs three times. The Dodgers swept the Padres in the 2020 NLDS, won in five games in the 2024 NLDS, and the Padres won in four games in the 2022 NLDS.

====Arizona Diamondbacks====

The rivalry between the Dodgers and the Arizona Diamondbacks was one of the fiercest divisional matchups for multiple years, particularly during the 2010s when both teams were in regular contention for control of the division. In addition to the elevated competition, animosity rose immensely between both sides resulting in multiple incidents involving either team throwing pitches at one another, occasionally escalating into several bench-clearing brawls. 

After eliminating the Diamondbacks and clinching the division on September 19, 2013, multiple Dodgers players celebrated the win by jumping into the pool at Chase Field. On December 8, 2015, Zack Greinke signed a six-year, $206.5 million contract with the Diamondbacks in free agency. Both teams met during the 2017 National League Division Series; the Diamondbacks were swept 3–0 by the Dodgers en route to their appearance in the World Series. The teams rematched in the 2023 National League Division Series, with the Diamondbacks returning the favor with a 3–0 sweep of their own as they eventually reached the World Series. The Dodgers lead the series 259–193, with the teams tied 3–3 in the postseason.

===National League===
====St. Louis Cardinals====

Primarily a playoff rivalry; since 1892, The Dodgers and St. Louis Cardinals have met 6 times in the postseason with 2 meetings in the NLCS won by the Cardinals. Both teams have recently grown a history of animosity towards one another since the late 2000s as both teams often met frequently in the postseason. The Dodgers have not fared as well against the Cardinals in the postseason. In five prior postseason series matchups, the Cardinals have won four with the Dodgers winning only the 2009 NLDS and the 2021 National League Wild Card Game.

====Cincinnati Reds====
The Dodgers&#x27; former rivalry with the Cincinnati Reds was one of the most intense during the 1970s through the early 1990s. They often competed for the NL West division title. From 1970 to 1990, they had eleven 1–2 finishes in the standings, with seven of them being within 5½ games or fewer. Both teams also played in numerous championships during this span, combining to win 10 NL Pennants and 5 World Series titles from –, most notably as the Big Red Machine teams clashed frequently with the Tommy Lasorda-era Dodgers teams. Reds manager Sparky Anderson once said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a rivalry like ours in either league. The Giants are supposed to be the Dodgers&#x27; natural rivals, but I don&#x27;t think the feeling is there anymore. It&#x27;s not there the way it is with us and the Dodgers.&quot; The rivalry ended when division realignment moved the Reds to the NL Central. However, they did face one another in the 1995 NLDS.

===American League===
====Los Angeles Angels====

This rivalry refers to a series of games played with the Los Angeles Angels. The Freeway Series takes its name from the massive freeway system in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area, the home of both teams; one could travel from one team&#x27;s stadium to the other simply by traveling along Interstate 5. The term is akin to &quot;Subway Series&quot; which refers to meetings between New York City baseball teams. The term &quot;Freeway Series&quot; also inspired the official name of the region&#x27;s NHL rivalry: the &quot;Freeway Face-Off.&quot;

Animosity between the team&#x27;s fanbases grew stronger in 2005, when the Angels&#x27; new team owner Arte Moreno changed the name of his ball club from the &#x27;Anaheim Angels&#x27;, to the &#x27;Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim&#x27;. Since the city of Anaheim is located roughly 30 miles from Downtown Los Angeles, the Angels franchise was ridiculed throughout the league for the contradictory nature surrounding the name, especially by Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, who filed a formal complaint to commissioner Bud Selig. Once the complaint was denied, McCourt devised a t-shirt mocking the crosstown rivals reading &#x27;The Los Angeles Dodgers of Los Angeles&#x27;, which remains popular amongst the fanbase to this day.

====New York Yankees====

The Dodgers&#x27; rivalry with the New York Yankees is one of the most well-known rivalries in Major League Baseball. The two teams have met twelve times in the World Series, more times than any other two teams from the American and National Leagues. The initial significance was embodied in the two teams&#x27; proximity in New York City when the Dodgers initially played in Brooklyn. After the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in 1958, the rivalry retained its significance as the two teams represented the two largest cities on opposite sides of the United States since the 1980s.

Although the rivalry&#x27;s significance arose from the two teams&#x27; numerous World Series meetings, the Yankees and Dodgers had gone 40 years without meeting in the World Series from until . They would not play each other in a non-exhibition game until 2004, when they played a three-game interleague series. Their last meeting in the regular season was in June 2024, when the Dodgers won two out of three games in New York.

====Houston Astros====
The rivalry between the Dodgers and the Houston Astros had initially begun as a divisional matchup, but hostility waned following Houston&#x27;s realignment to the American League. In 2017, the two teams played one another in the 2017 World Series in which the Astros won the championship in 7 games. The rivalry was re-intensified after the Astros&#x27; widely publicized sign-stealing scandal, in which it was revealed the team had utilized a complex system to steal pitch signs, including during the 2017 World Series. As a result of the scandal, hostility grew immensely between the two teams and their fans. The Dodgers lead the all-time series 400–334; both teams are tied in postseason wins 6–6.

==Fan support==

In 2012, a &quot;Bleacher Report&quot; article referred to Dodgers fans as the best sports fanbase in Los Angeles. Following the team&#x27;s relocation to California, attendance had gone from eleventh during their final season in Brooklyn to second in their first season in Los Angeles. Initially during construction of Dodger Stadium, Walter O&#x27;Malley feared the size of the ballpark would prove to be too difficult to fill on a regular basis once completed in 1962. This proved not to be the case as the Dodgers led the league in attendance by a sizeable margin for the 1962 season, nearly doubling that of the New York Yankees.

===Attendance records===
In 1978 the Dodgers became the first MLB team to attract more than three million fans in a season, and repeated the feat six more times before any other franchise reached three million fans overall. The Dodgers drew at least three million fans for 15 consecutive seasons from 1996 to 2010, the longest such streak among all MLB teams. The team&#x27;s largest fan club, Pantone 294 (a reference to the Pantone code of Dodger blue), regularly travels to away games to cheer for the Dodgers. The Dodgers have regularly placed in the top three in attendance, or have led the league numerous times since 2000, excluding the 2020 season; the Dodgers have recently led the league in attendance for nine straight seasons going back to 2013.

On July 3, 2007, Dodgers management announced that total franchise attendance, dating back to 1901, had reached 175 million, a record for all professional sports. In 2007, the Dodgers set a franchise record for single-season attendance, attracting over 3.8 million fans. On March 28, 2008, the Dodgers set the world record for the largest attendance for a single baseball game during an exhibition game against the Boston Red Sox at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in honor of the Dodgers&#x27; 50th anniversary, with 115,300 fans in attendance. In 2009, the Dodgers led MLB in total attendance. The Dodger baseball cap is consistently in the top three in sales.

Primarily, Dodgers fans originate from most of southern or central California and also parts of southern Nevada. The fanbase has also extended out to states across the southwest such as Arizona, New Mexico and even western Texas. In 2015, Vivid Seats reported that the Dodgers were the most popular MLB team in Utah based on ticket sales. Dodgers&#x27; away games throughout the US will usually attract substantial numbers of expats and traveling fans.

Given the team&#x27;s proximity to Hollywood, numerous celebrities can often be seen attending home games at Dodger Stadium. Celebrities such as co-owner Magic Johnson, Flea, Mary Hart, DaBaby, Larry King, Tiger Woods, Alyssa Milano, Shia LaBeouf, George Lopez, Lana Del Rey, Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher are known to frequently attend Dodger games, with some sitting at field box seats behind home plate where they sign autographs for fellow Dodger fans. Actor Bryan Cranston is a lifelong Dodger fan.

=== International ===
Abroad; the Dodgers have a strongly devoted following in Mexico due to the impact of Mexican players such as Fernando Valenzuela, Ismael Valdéz, or more recently; Julio Urias. The impact of the Dodgers&#x27; extensive fanbase across Mexico, and among the Mexican-American community is ever present, as an estimated 54% of fans in home attendance are of Mexican descent. Notably; Mel Almada, the first Mexican-born player in league history, was also a southern California native, he played for the Dodgers near the tail end of his career in 1939. The fanbase is also present throughout Asian countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan due to the impacts of Japanese players such as Hideo Nomo, Hiroki Kuroda, Kenta Maeda or Yu Darvish. The Dodgers grew fan attention in South Korea, as they became the first MLB team to sign the first South Korean-born player in league history: Chan Ho Park in 1994. The Dodgers had also strengthened their ties with their recruitment of South Korean players, following the signing of All-Star pitcher Hyun Jin Ryu in 2013. The team partnered with the Korean communities of Los Angeles and began hosting an annual Korean Heritage night since 2016. The Dodgers made history for signing the first Taiwanese player in MLB, Chin-Feng Chen in 2002; other Taiwanese players such as Chin-Lung Hu and Chin-Hui Tsao would also eventually sign with the Dodgers, largely growing fan support from the country.

The Dodgers increased their focus on growing a Japanese fanbase in 2024 amid their signing of Shohei Ohtani, including theme nights in collaboration with Japanese companies such as Sanrio (which sponsored a Hello Kitty night, headlined by the national anthem being performed by Japanese musician and X Japan member Yoshiki), and VTuber agency Hololive (which also coincided with Los Angeles&#x27; Anime Expo).

== Radio and television ==
As of 2023, the primary play-by-play announcers on television and radio, respectively, are Joe Davis and Charley Steiner, with Orel Hershiser (TV) and Rick Monday (radio) working as the primary color commentators. On some games, Stephen Nelson would fill in for Davis during his national assignments with Fox Sports, with Davis typically working as the lead voice of the MLB on Fox and as one of the play-by-play voices of the NFL on Fox. Nomar Garciaparra, Eric Karros, Dontrelle Willis and Jessica Mendoza often fill in for Hershiser on select games. On the radio side, Tim Neverett works play-by-play on select games, and also fills in for Davis on television broadcasts.

From 1950 to 2016, almost all Dodger games were called by Vin Scully. His longtime partners were Jerry Doggett (1956–1987) and Ross Porter (1977–2004). In 1976, he was selected by Dodgers fans as the Most Memorable Personality (on the field or off) in the team&#x27;s history. He is also a recipient of the Baseball Hall of Fame&#x27;s Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasters (inducted in 1982). Unlike the modern style in which multiple sportscasters have an on-air conversation (usually with one functioning as play-by-play announcer and the other[s] as color commentator), Scully, Doggett, and Porter generally called games solo, trading with each other inning-by-inning. In the 1980s and 1990s, Scully would call the entire radio broadcast except for the third and seventh inning, allowing the other Dodger commentators to broadcast an inning. Fans and critics alike frequently praised Scully due in large part for his longevity with the team, and his ability to provide peculiar details about multiple players appearing onfield. Despite his longevity and a strong relationship with the team and fanbase, Scully was also praised for his relatively unbiased view of any game he called, often referring to the listeners as &#x27;friends&#x27; instead of &#x27;fans&#x27;.

When Doggett retired after the 1987 season, he was replaced by Hall-of-Fame Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale, who previously broadcast games for the California Angels and Chicago White Sox. Drysdale died in his hotel room following a heart attack before a game in Montreal in 1993. This was a difficult broadcast for Scully and Porter who could not mention it on-air until Drysdale&#x27;s family had been notified and the official announcement made. He was replaced by former Dodgers outfielder Rick Monday. Porter&#x27;s tenure ended after the 2004 season, after which the format of play-by-play announcers and color commentators was installed, led by Monday and newcomer Charley Steiner. Scully, however, continued to announce solo.

Scully called roughly 100 games per season (all home games and road games in California and Arizona) for both flagship radio station KLAC and on television for Spectrum SportsNet LA. Scully was simulcast for the first three innings of each of his appearances, then announced only for the TV audience. If Scully was calling the game, Steiner took over play-by-play on the radio beginning with the fourth inning, with Monday as color commentator. If Scully was not calling the game, Steiner and Orel Hershiser called the entire game on television while Monday and Kevin Kennedy did the same on radio. In the event the Dodgers were in post-season play, Scully called the first three and last three innings of the radio broadcast alone, and Steiner &amp; Monday handled the middle innings. Vin Scully retired from calling games in 2016. His tenure with the Dodgers was the longest with any single sports team at 67 years. Youthful announcer Joe Davis was selected in 2017 by Dodgers management to handle play-by-play on television with Orel Hershiser as his colorman.

The Dodgers also broadcast on radio in two other languages, Spanish and Korean. Upon moving to Los Angeles in 1958, the Dodgers became the first MLB team with a Spanish-language flagship station, KWKW (), with a broadcast team that included René Cárdenas. From 1959 to 2022, the Spanish play-by-play was voiced by another Frick Award winner, Jaime Jarrín. Until his death in 2024, a color analyst for some games was former Dodger pitcher Fernando Valenzuela, for whom Jarrin once translated post-game interviews. Valenzuela was joined on the Spanish booth in 2023 and 2024 by Pepe Yñiguez and José Mota, son of Dodger legend Manny Mota. The Spanish-language radio flagship station is KTNQ. Meanwhile, the Dodgers&#x27; Korean broadcast began in 2013 through KMPC.

===Retired numbers===

Koufax, Campanella, and Robinson were the first Dodgers to have their numbers retired, in a ceremony at Dodger Stadium on June 4, 1972. Although other MLB teams had already been retiring numbers for decades, the Dodgers were late to the trend. The Dodgers had wanted to retire Robinson&#x27;s No. 42 for some time, but Robinson had consistently rejected the honor due to a long-running grudge with Dodgers owner Walter O&#x27;Malley. Robinson did not agree to appear at a number retirement ceremony until O&#x27;Malley handed over control of the team to his son Peter in 1970.

Although the Dodgers website states that there are no &quot;written &#x27;criteria&#x27; for retiring uniform numbers,&quot; the team has historically retired only the numbers of individuals who played most of their career with the Dodgers and are members of the Baseball Hall of Fame. (Underscoring the principle, Koufax, Snider, Reese, Drysdale, Lasorda, Sutton, and Hodges all had their numbers retired during the seasons in which they were inducted into the Hall. Robinson and Campanella had already been Hall of Famers for several years when their numbers were retired in 1972.) There have only been three exceptions:

* Manager Walter Alston&#x27;s number was retired in 1977, the season after he retired as the Dodgers manager. At the time he retired, he had four World Series rings and was fifth all-time in managerial wins. Alston entered the Hall in 1983.
* Infielder and assistant coach Jim Gilliam&#x27;s number was retired in 1978, two days after his untimely death. Gilliam spent 28 years with the Dodgers organization and was still coaching the team when he died.
* Pitcher and broadcaster Fernando Valenzuela&#x27;s number was retired in 2023, one year before his death from liver cancer. The Dodgers had previously declined to issue Valenzuela&#x27;s No. 34 to any new players out of respect for Valenzuela&#x27;s special role in Dodger history. In a strange coincidence, Valenzuela spent 34 years with the Dodgers organization. Like Gilliam, he was still working for the team when he died.

In 1997, 50 years after he broke the color barrier and 25 years after the Dodgers retired his number, Robinson&#x27;s No. 42 was retired throughout Major League Baseball. Robinson is the only major league baseball player so honored. Starting in the 2007 season, Jackie Robinson Day (April 15, commemorating the Opening Day of Robinson&#x27;s rookie season of 1947) has featured many or all players and coaches wearing the number 42 as a tribute to Robinson.

A broader term, the Dodgers &quot;Ring of Honor,&quot; includes both the retired numbers and three non-baseball personnel whose insignia are displayed alongside the retired numbers. Longtime broadcasters Vin Scully (English) and Jaime Jarrín (Spanish) are honored with microphone symbols. Team owner Walter O&#x27;Malley, who moved the Dodgers to Los Angeles, is honored with the team &quot;LA&quot; logo. All three have been recognized by the Hall of Fame, O&#x27;Malley by induction and Scully and Jarrín via the Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasters.

===Legends of Dodger Baseball===
In 2019, the Dodgers established &quot;Legends of Dodger Baseball&quot;, which is meant to honor Dodger greats whose numbers have not been retired. The program honors those who made an &quot;impact on the franchise, both on and off the field.&quot; Recipients are recognized with plaques at Dodger Stadium.

===Managers===

Since 1884, the Dodgers have used a total of 31 Managers, the most current being Dave Roberts, who was appointed following the 2015 postseason, after the departure of Don Mattingly.

Over the nearly 43 years from 1954 to mid-1996, the Dodgers employed only two managers, Walter Alston and Tommy Lasorda, both of whom are in the Hall of Fame. During this entire time period of extraordinary stability, the Dodgers were family-owned by Walter O&#x27;Malley and then his son Peter O&#x27;Malley. It was during this era that the Dodgers won 11 of their 24 pennants and their first six World Series championships.

The managers of the Los Angeles Dodgers (1958–present) are as follows:
*Walter Alston (1958–1976) (in Brooklyn since 1954)

===Public address announcers/organists===
From the Dodgers&#x27; move to Los Angeles from Brooklyn in 1958, the Dodgers employed a handful of well-known public address announcers; the most famous of which was John Ramsey, who served as the PA voice of the Dodgers from 1958 until his retirement in 1982; he was also well known for announcing at other venerable Los Angeles venues, including the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and Sports Arena, and the Forum. Ramsey died in 1990.

From 1958 to 1982, Doug Moore, Philip Petty, and Dennis Packer served as back-up voices for John Ramsey for the Dodgers, California Angels, Los Angeles Chargers, USC football, and Los Angeles Rams. Packer was Ramsey&#x27;s primary backup for the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Kings until Ramsey&#x27;s retirement from the Forum in 1978. Thereafter, Packer became the public address announcer for the Lakers, Kings, indoor soccer, and indoor tennis events at the Forum.

Nick Nickson, a radio broadcaster for the Los Angeles Kings, replaced John Ramsey as the Dodger Stadium public address announcer in 1983 and served in that capacity through the 1989 season to work with the Kings full-time.

Dennis Packer and Pete Arbogast were emulators of John Ramsey, using the same stentorian style of announcing Ramsey was famous for. Packer and Arbogast shared the stadium announcing chores for the 1994 FIFA World Cup matches at the Rose Bowl. Arbogast won the Dodgers job on the day that Ramsey died on January 25, 1990, by doing a verbatim imitation of Ramsey&#x27;s opening and closing remarks that were standard at each game. His replacement, in 1994 was Mike Carlucci, who remained as the Dodgers&#x27; PA voice announcer until he resigned in 2002 to concentrate on his voiceover and acting career along with his Olympics announcing duties.

From 2003 to 2014, the Dodgers public address announcer was Eric Smith, who also announces for the Los Angeles Clippers and USC Trojans.

On April 3, 2015, the Dodgers announced that former radio broadcaster Todd Leitz was hired to become their new public address announcer. Leitz was an anchor and news reporter in Los Angeles at KNX 1070 AM for 10 years, and a news reporter at KABC 790 for two years.

From 1988 to 2015, Nancy Bea Hefley enjoyed popularity behind the Dodger Stadium keyboard similar to Gladys Goodding. Since retirement in 2015, Bea&#x27;s replacement and current organist is Dieter Ruehle, who also plays at Crypto.com Arena for Los Angeles Kings games.

===Other===
Vin Scully is permanently honored in the Baseball Hall of Fame&#x27;s &quot;Scribes &amp; Mikemen&quot; exhibit as a result of winning the Ford C. Frick Award in 1982. Frick Award recipients are not official members of the Hall.

Allan Roth was the first person hired as the official statistician of a Major League team when he was hired by the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. He continued his tenure with Los Angeles until 1964.

Sue Falsone, was the first female physical therapist in Major League baseball, and from 2012 to 2013, was the first female head athletic trainer.

<text>Louis Joseph Andriessen (; 6 June 1939 – 1 July 2021) was a Dutch composer, pianist and academic teacher. Considered the most influential Dutch composer of his generation, he was a central proponent of The Hague school of composition. Although his music was initially dominated by neoclassicism and serialism, his style gradually shifted to a synthesis of American minimalism, big band jazz and the expressionism of Igor Stravinsky.

Born in Utrecht into a musical family, Andriessen studied with his father, the composer Hendrik Andriessen as well as composers Kees van Baaren and Luciano Berio. Andriessen taught at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague from 1974 to 2012, influencing notable composers. His opera &quot;La Commedia&quot;, based on Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, won the 2011 Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition and was selected in 2019 by critics at &quot;The Guardian&quot; as one of the most outstanding compositions of the 21st century.

==Life and career==
Andriessen was born in Utrecht on 6 June 1939 to a musical family, the son of the composer Hendrik Andriessen and Johanna Justina Anschütz (1898–1975). His father was professor of composition at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague, and later its director. His siblings are composers Jurriaan Andriessen and Caecilia Andriessen (1931–2019), and he is the nephew of Willem Andriessen (1887–1964).

Andriessen originally studied with his father and Kees van Baaren at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague, graduating in 1961 with a first prize, before embarking upon two years of study with Italian composer Luciano Berio in Milan and Berlin. His father introduced him to the works of Francis Poulenc and Eric Satie which he came to love. From 1961–65, Andriessen wrote for the daily &quot;De Volkskrant&quot;, and for &quot;De Gids&quot; magazine from 1966–69. Andriessen lived in Amsterdam starting in 1965.

In 1969, he was part of a group of protesters at a concert of the Concertgebouw Orchestra. They disrupted the concert with nutcrackers and bicycle horns, handing out leaflets on the dismal representation of Dutch new music in the orchestra&#x27;s programming. The next year, he and the other &quot;Nutcrackers&quot; were given one-week prison sentences, and yet their protest sparked something of a social reform in the Dutch music scene.

Andriessen was internationally recognised as a composer with his 1976 &quot;De Staat&quot; which included texts from Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;. He was one of the founders of the Hague School, an avant-garde and minimalist movement from the second half of the 20th century. In later decades, he accepted commissions from major orchestras, including the San Francisco Symphony, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic. Andriessen was the focus of festivals in Tanglewood (1994), London (1994; 2002), Tokyo (2000), Brisbane (2001) and New York (2004). In 2008, he was elected an honorary member of the International Society for Contemporary Music ISCM. He held the Richard and Barbara Debs Composer&#x27;s Chair at Carnegie Hall during the 2009–10 season.

=== Ensembles ===

In 1969, Andriessen co-founded Studio voor Elektro-Instrumentale Muziek STEIM in Amsterdam. In opposition to the classical orchestra, a structure seen as &quot;hierarchical&quot;, he also helped founding the instrumental groups Orkest de Volharding and Hoketus, both of which performed compositions of the same names, formed by classical, jazz and pop musicians. He later became closely involved with the Schonberg and Asko ensembles and inspired the formation of the British ensemble Icebreaker.

=== Teaching ===

Andriessen joined the faculty of the Royal Conservatory in 1974. He taught instrumentation from 1974 to 1978 and taught composition there from 1978 to 2012, where he influenced notable students including Michel van der Aa, Richard Ayres and Steve Martland. Yale University invited him in 1987 to lecture on theory and composition, he was also guest lecturer at New York State University, Buffalo (1989) and Princeton (1996). The arts faculty of the University of Leiden appointed him professor in 2004. One of his students was Raminta Šerkšnytė, a lithuanian pianist and composer.

=== Personal life ===
Andriessen was married to guitarist Jeanette Yanikian (1935–2008). They were a couple for over 40 years, and were married in 1996. &quot;La Commedia&quot; is dedicated to Yanikian. He was married in 2012 a second time to violinist Monica Germino, for whom he wrote several works. In December 2020, she announced that Louis was suffering from dementia. He died on 1 July 2021 in Weesp at age 82.

Andriessen had one son, Lodewijk Torenbos-Andriessen, with dancer and theatre director Betsy Torenbos.

==Style and notable works==
Andriessen began in the style of an intentionally dry neoclassicism, but then turned into a strict serialist. His early works show experimentation with various contemporary trends: post-war serialism (&quot;Series&quot;, 1958), pastiche (&quot;Anachronie I&quot;, 1966–67), and tape (&quot;Il Duce&quot;, 1973). His reaction to what he perceived as the conservatism of much of the Dutch contemporary music scene quickly moved him to form a radically alternative musical aesthetic of his own. From the early 1970s on he refused to write for conventional symphony orchestras and instead opted to write for his own idiosyncratic instrumental combinations, which often retain some traditional orchestral instruments alongside electric guitars, electric basses, and congas. Andriessen repeatedly used his music for political confessions and messages, but he also referred to painting and philosophy. His range of inspiration was wide, including the music of Charles Ives in &quot;Anachronie I&quot;, the art of Piet Mondrian in &quot;De Stijl&quot;, the visions of Beguine mystic Hadewijch in &quot;Hadewijch&quot;, and shipbuilding and atomic theory in &quot;De Materie&quot; Part I.

Andriessen&#x27;s later style is a unique blend of American sounds and European forms. His mature music combines the influences of jazz, American minimalism, and the music of Igor Stravinsky and Claude Vivier, containing minimalist-influenced polyrhythms, lyrical melodic fragments, and predominantly consonant harmonies disrupted by concentrated dissonance. Andriessen&#x27;s music thus departs from post-war European serialism and its offshoots. By the 21st century he was widely regarded as Europe&#x27;s most important minimalist composer.

His notable works include &quot;Workers Union&quot; (1975), a melodically indeterminate piece &quot;for any loud sounding group of instruments&quot; whose score specifies rhythm and contour but not exact pitch; &quot;Mausoleum&quot; (1979) for two baritones and large ensemble; &quot;De Tijd&quot; (&quot;Time&quot;, 1979–81) for female singers and ensemble; &quot;De Snelheid&quot; (&quot;Velocity&quot;, 1982–83), for three amplified ensembles; &quot;De Materie&quot; (&quot;Matter&quot;, 1984–88), a large four-part work for voices and ensemble; collaborations with filmmaker and librettist Peter Greenaway on the film &quot;M is for Man, Music, Mozart&quot; and the operas &quot;Rosa: A Horse Drama&quot; (1994) and &quot;Writing to Vermeer&quot; (1998); and &quot;La Passione&quot; (2000–02) for female voice, violin and ensemble. His 2008 opera &quot;La Commedia&quot;, based on Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, won the 2011 Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition and was selected by critics at &quot;The Guardian&quot; as one of the most outstanding classical compositions of the 21st century in 2019.

<text>Leonard Peltier (born September 12, 1944) is a Native American activist and member of the American Indian Movement (AIM) who was convicted of murdering two Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents in a June 26, 1975, shooting on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, which he denies. He was sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment. Peltier became eligible for parole in 1993. On January 19, 2025, Peltier&#x27;s sentence was commuted to indefinite house arrest by President Joe Biden shortly before he left office. On February 18, the date specified by the grant of clemency, Peltier was released and transferred. 

In his 1999 memoir &quot;Prison Writings: My Life Is My Sun Dance&quot;, Peltier admitted to participating in the shootout but said he did not kill the FBI agents. However, witnesses say he confessed, including Darlene Ka-Mook Nichols who testified against him at trial. Human rights watchdogs, such as Amnesty International, and political figures including Nelson Mandela, Mother Teresa, and the 14th Dalai Lama, campaigned for clemency for Peltier.

At the time of the shootout, Peltier was an active member of AIM, an Indigenous rights advocacy group that worked to combat the racism and police brutality experienced by Native Americans. 

Peltier ran for president of the United States in 2004, winning the nomination of the Peace and Freedom Party, and receiving 27,607 votes, limited to the ballot in California. Years later, in 2020, he ran for vice president of the United States on the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) ticket with Gloria La Riva as the presidential candidate, as well as tickets for other left-wing parties and on the ballot of the Peace and Freedom Party. For health reasons, Peltier withdrew from those tickets on August 1, 2020.

==Early life and education==
Peltier was born on September 12, 1944, at the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation of the Turtle Mountain Chippewa near Belcourt, North Dakota. He is of Lakota, Dakota, and Anishinaabe descent, and was raised among the Turtle Mountain Chippewa and Fort Totten Sioux Nations of North Dakota. He was one of 13 children. His parents divorced when he was four years old, with Leonard and his sister Betty Ann living with their paternal grandparents Alex and Mary Dubois-Peltier in the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation.

In September 1953, Leonard was enrolled at the Wahpeton Indian School in Wahpeton, North Dakota, an Indian boarding school run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The school, which was located away from his home in the Turtle Mountain Reservation, practiced forced cultural assimilation of Indigenous children into white American culture by requiring the children to use English and forbidding the inclusion of Native American culture. He graduated from Wahpeton in May 1957 and then attended the Flandreau Indian School in Flandreau, South Dakota. After finishing the ninth grade, he returned to the Turtle Mountain Reservation to live with his father. Peltier later obtained a general equivalency degree (GED).

==Career and activism==
In 1965, Peltier relocated to Seattle, Washington. Peltier worked as a welder, a construction worker, and as the co-owner of an auto shop in Seattle in his twenties. The co-owners used the upper level of the building as a stopping place, or halfway house, for American Indians who had alcohol addiction issues or had recently finished their prison sentences and were re-entering society. The halfway house took a financial toll on the shop, so they closed it.

In Seattle, Peltier became involved in a variety of causes championing Native American civil rights. In the early 1970s, he learned about the factional tensions at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota between supporters of Richard Wilson, elected tribal chairman in 1972, and traditionalist members of the Lakota tribe. It was Dennis Banks who first invited Leonard Peltier to join AIM. Consequently, Peltier became an official member of the American Indian Movement (AIM) in 1972, which was founded by urban Indians in Minneapolis in 1968, at a time of rising Indian activism for civil rights.

Wilson had created a private militia, known as the Guardians of the Oglala Nation (GOON), whose members were reputed to have attacked political opponents. Protests over a failed impeachment hearing of Wilson contributed to the AIM and Lakota armed takeover of Wounded Knee at the reservation in February 1973. Federal forces reacted, conducting a 71-day siege, which became known as the Wounded Knee Occupation. Protestors demanded the resignation of Wilson. Peltier, however, spent most of the occupation in a Milwaukee, Wisconsin jail charged with attempted murder related to a different protest. When Peltier secured bail at the end of April, he took part in an AIM protest outside the federal building in Milwaukee and was on his way to Wounded Knee with the group to deliver supplies when the incident ended.

In 1975, Peltier traveled as a member of AIM to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to help reduce violence among political opponents. At the time, he was a fugitive, with an arrest warrant having been issued in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It charged him with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution for the attempted murder of an off-duty Milwaukee police officer. (He was acquitted of the attempted murder charge in February 1978.)

During this period, Peltier had seven children from two marriages and adopted two children.

== Shootout at Pine Ridge ==

On June 26, 1975, FBI Special Agents Ronald Arthur Williams and Jack Ross Coler returned to Pine Ridge to continue searching for a young man named Jimmy Eagle, wanted for questioning in connection with the recent assault of two local ranch hands and theft of a pair of cowboy boots.

Sometime after 11 a.m., Williams and Coler, driving two separate unmarked cars, spotted, reported, and followed what has been described as a red pick-up truck or van, but was in fact a white-over-orange Chevrolet Suburban Carryall carrying Peltier, Norman Charles, and Joe Stuntz. Peltier had an outstanding federal warrant for the attempted murder of a Milwaukee police officer, although Williams and Coler were not aware of this. Charles had met with Williams and Coler the evening before, when the agents explained to Charles they were looking for Eagle. After turning off US 18 into the Jumping Bull Ranch, where the Jumping Bull family had allowed AIM to camp, the occupants of the Suburban stopped, exited the vehicle, and a firefight ensued.

Between 11:45 and 11:50, Williams radioed to a local dispatch that he and Coler had come under fire from the vehicle&#x27;s occupants and would be killed if reinforcements did not arrive. He next radioed that they both had been shot. FBI Special Agent Gary Adams was the first to respond to Williams&#x27; call for assistance from away. But he and the other responding BIA officers also came under gunfire. They were unable to reach Coler and Williams in time, as both agents died within the first ten minutes of gunfire. It was not until about 4:25 p.m. that authorities were able to recover the bodies of Williams and Coler from Coler&#x27;s vehicle. Norman Charles fired at the agents with a stolen British .308 rifle. Peltier had an AR-15 rifle. The two agents had fired a total of five shots: two from Williams&#x27; handgun, one from Coler&#x27;s handgun, one from Coler&#x27;s rifle, and one from Coler&#x27;s shotgun. In total, 125 bullet holes were found in the agents&#x27; vehicles, many from a .223 Remington AR-15 rifle. Coler was 28 years old and Williams was 27.

The FBI reported that Williams received a defensive wound to his right hand (as he attempted to shield his face) from a bullet that passed through his hand into his head. Williams was shot in the body and foot, before the lethal contact shot to the head. Coler, incapacitated from earlier bullet wounds, was shot twice in the head.

Williams&#x27;s car was driven into the AIM camp farther south on the Jumping Bull property and stripped. The agents&#x27; guns were stolen. Allegedly, Darrelle Butler took Williams&#x27; handgun, Peltier took Coler&#x27;s, and Robert Robideau took Coler&#x27;s .308 and shotgun. Stuntz was found wearing Coler&#x27;s FBI jacket after he was shot and killed by a BIA agent later that day.

=== Aftermath ===
At least three men were arrested in connection with the shooting: Peltier, Robert Robideau, and Darrelle &quot;Dino&quot; Butler, all AIM members who were present at the Jumping Bull compound at the time of the shootings.

Peltier provided numerous alibis to several people about his activities on the morning of the attacks. In an interview for Peter Matthiessen&#x27;s 1983 book &quot;In the Spirit of Crazy Horse&quot;, Peltier described working on a car in Oglala, claiming he had driven back to the Jumping Bull Compound about an hour before the shooting started. In an interview with Lee Hill, though, he described being awakened in his tent at the ranch encampment by the sound of gunshots; but to Harvey Arden, for &quot;Prison Writings&quot;, he described enjoying the beautiful morning before he heard the firing. In his 1999 memoir &quot;Prison Writings: My Life Is My Sun Dance&quot;, Peltier admitted to participating in the shootout but said he did not kill the FBI agents.

On September 5, Butler was arrested; Agent Williams&#x27; handgun and ammunition were recovered from an automobile in the vicinity. Four days later, Peltier bought a station wagon. The following day, AIM member Robideau, Charles and Anderson were injured in the accidental explosion of ammunition from Peltier&#x27;s station wagon on the Kansas Turnpike close to Wichita. Coler&#x27;s .308 and an AR-15 were found in the burned vehicle. The FBI forwarded a description of a recreational vehicle (RV) and Peltier&#x27;s Plymouth station wagon to law enforcement during the hunt for the suspects. The RV was stopped by an Oregon state trooper, but the driver, later discovered to be Peltier, fled on foot after a small shootout. Peltier&#x27;s thumbprint and Coler&#x27;s handgun were discovered under the RV&#x27;s front seat.

== Trial ==
On December 22, 1975, Peltier was named to the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. On February 6, 1976, Peltier was arrested along with Frank Blackhorse by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Hinton, Alberta, Canada at the Smallboy Camp, transported to Calgary, Alberta and taken to the Oakalla Prison Farm in Vancouver, British Columbia.

In December 1976, Peltier was extradited from Canada based on documents submitted by the FBI. Warren Allmand, Canada&#x27;s Solicitor General at the time, later stated that these documents contained false information. (Blackhorse was also extradited to the United States, but charges against him related to the reservation shootout were dropped.) One of the documents relied on in Peltier&#x27;s extradition was an affidavit signed by Myrtle Poor Bear, a Native American woman local to the area near Pine Ridge Reservation. While Poor Bear stated that she was Peltier&#x27;s girlfriend during that time and had watched the killings, Peltier and others at the scene said that Poor Bear did not know Peltier and was not present during the murders. Poor Bear later admitted to lying to the FBI, but said the agents interviewing her had coerced her into making the claims. When Poor Bear tried to testify against the FBI, the judge barred her testimony because of mental incompetence. However, the Canadian government later reviewed the extradition and concluded it had been lawful since &quot;the circumstantial evidence presented at the extradition hearing, taken alone, constituted sufficient evidence to justify Mr. Peltier&#x27;s committal on two murder charges.&quot;

Peltier fought extradition to the United States. Robideau and Butler were acquitted on grounds of self-defense by a federal jury in Cedar Rapids, Iowa since the forensic evidence showed they had not been the ones to execute the agents and the government had no witnesses at the time who could prove they knew they were attacking FBI officers. This was not the case in Peltier&#x27;s trial, where the FBI had forensic evidence and eyewitnesses that together linked Peltier directly to the killings of the officers.

Peltier&#x27;s trial was held in Fargo, North Dakota, where a jury convicted him of the murders of Coler and Williams. Unlike in the trial for Butler and Robideau, the FBI produced forensic evidence that the two FBI agents were killed by close-range shots to their heads, when they were already defenseless because of previous gunshot wounds. Consequently, Peltier could not submit a self-defense testimony like the other activists had. The jury was also shown autopsy and crime scene photographs of the two agents, which had not been shown to the jury at Cedar Rapids. In April 1977, Peltier was convicted and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences.

Some organizations have raised doubts about Peltier&#x27;s guilt and the fairness of his trial, based on alleged inconsistencies in the FBI and prosecution&#x27;s handling of the case. Two witnesses in the initial trial recanted their statements and stated they were made under duress at the hands of the FBI. At least one witness was given immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony against Peltier.

During a June 8, 2024, interview by Native News Online, Peltier&#x27;s serving attorney Kevin Sharp – who has also served as U.S. District Judge for the Middle District of Tennessee from 2011 to 2017, including as Chief Judge from 2014 to 2017 – stated the following:

=== Alleged discrepancies in material evidence ===

FBI radio intercepts indicated that the two FBI agents Williams and Coler had entered the Pine Ridge Reservation in pursuit of a suspected thief in a red pickup truck. The FBI confirmed this claim the day after the shootout, but red pickup trucks near the reservation had been stopped for weeks, and Leonard Peltier did not drive a red pickup truck. Evidence was given that Peltier was driving a Chevrolet Suburban; a large sport utility vehicle built on a pickup truck chassis, with an enclosed rear section. Peltier&#x27;s vehicle was orange with a white roof – not a red open-bed pickup truck with no white paint.

At Peltier&#x27;s trial, FBI agents changed their previous statements that they had been in search of a red pickup truck and instead said they were looking for an orange and white van, similar to the one Peltier drove. This contradictory statement by the FBI was a highly contentious matter of evidence in the trials.

Though the FBI&#x27;s investigation indicated that an AR-15 was used to kill the agents, several different AR-15s were in the area at the time of the shootout. Also, no other cartridge cases or evidence about them was offered by the prosecutor&#x27;s office, though other bullets were fired at the crime scene. However, the appeals court confirmed his conviction in 1986, noting that even though later evidence suggested there were multiple AR-15s in the area, the government&#x27;s expert witness had testified during the trial that he could not match 14 shell casings to the AR-15 that killed the agents. The appeals court stated further that the fact was ultimately irrelevant given these shells were ejected in locations such that &quot;it would have been very difficult, if not impossible, for anyone to have fired at Coler and Williams from these points,&quot; instead concluding that &quot;it is more likely that these casings were ejected from an AR-15 in the firefight that occurred after Coler and Williams were killed and other agents had joined in the shooting.&quot;

During the trial, all the bullets and bullet fragments found at the scene were provided as evidence and detailed by Cortland Cunningham, FBI firearms expert, in testimony (Ref &quot;US v. Leonard Peltier&quot;, Vol 9). Years later, in 2004, a request under the Freedom of Information Act prompted another examination of the FBI ballistics report used to convict Peltier. An impartial expert evaluated the firing pin linked to the gun that shot Williams and Coler and concluded that some cartridge cases from the scene of the crime did not come from the rifle tied to Peltier. Again, the appeals court rejected the defense&#x27;s argument, because the information included in the FOIA request &quot;did not refer to the .223 casing found in the agents’ car, but to other casings found at the scene.&quot; The court concluded that given the immaterial nature of this new evidence, it was not probable that the jury would have reached a different verdict had that information been available.

=== 1979 prison escape ===
Peltier began serving his sentences in 1977. On July 20, 1979, he and two other inmates escaped from Federal Correctional Institution, Lompoc. One inmate was shot dead by a guard outside the prison and another was captured 90 minutes later, approximately away. Peltier remained at large until he was captured by a search party three days later near Santa Maria, California, after a farmer alerted authorities that Peltier, armed with a Ruger Mini-14 rifle, had consumed some of his crops and stolen his shoes, wallet, and pickup truck key. Peltier attempted to drive the truck away at high speed down the rough gravel road, resulting in a broken transmission, after which he again fled on foot. Peltier was later apprehended without incident. After a six-week trial held in Los Angeles before Judge Lawrence T. Lydick, Peltier was convicted and sentenced to serve a five-year sentence for escape and a two-year sentence for a felon in possession of a firearm, in addition to his preexisting two life sentences.

==Clemency and commutation of sentence==

=== Support for clemency ===
Peltier&#x27;s conviction sparked great controversy and drew criticism from a number of prominent figures across a wide range of disciplines. In 1999, Peltier asserted on CNN that he did not commit the murders and does not know who did. Peltier has described himself as a political prisoner. Numerous public and legal appeals were filed on his behalf; however, because of the consistent objection of the FBI, none of the resulting rulings were made in his favor. His appeals for clemency received support from world-famous civil rights advocates, including Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Rev. Jesse Jackson, Tenzin Gyatso (the 14th Dalai Lama), Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and activist Rigoberta Menchú, and Mother Teresa. International and national government entities such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights, the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations, the European Parliament, and the Belgian Parliament, have all passed resolutions in favor of Peltier&#x27;s clemency. Several human rights groups, including the International Federation for Human Rights and Amnesty International launched campaigns advocating for Peltier&#x27;s clemency. In the United States, the Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights, the Committee of Concerned Scientists, Inc., the National Lawyers Guild, and the American Association of Jurists are all supporters of clemency for Peltier.

The police officer who arrested Peltier, Bob Newbrook, is convinced that he &quot;was extradited illegally and that he didn&#x27;t get a fair trial in the United States&quot;.

On June 7, 2022, the United Nations Human Rights Council&#x27;s Working Group on Arbitrary Detention released a seventeen-page analysis of Peltier&#x27;s detention, rendering the opinion that it contravenes &quot;articles 2, 7, and 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 2 (1), 9 and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, is arbitrary and falls within categories III and V.&quot; The Working Group urged a &quot;full and independent investigation&quot; surrounding his detention and requested that the US government remedy his situation &quot;without delay and bring it into conformity with the relevant international norms&quot;.

=== Clemency denial and commutation===
In 1999, Peltier filed a &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition, but it was rejected by the 10th Circuit Court on November 4, 2003. Near the end of the Clinton administration in 2001, rumors began circulating that Bill Clinton was considering granting Peltier clemency. Opponents of Peltier campaigned against his possible clemency; about 500 FBI agents and families protested outside the White House, and FBI director Louis Freeh sent a letter opposing Peltier&#x27;s clemency to the White House. Clinton did not grant Peltier clemency. In 2002, Peltier filed a civil rights lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the FBI, Louis Freeh and FBI agents who had participated in the campaign against his clemency petition, alleging that they &quot;engaged in a systematic and officially sanctioned campaign of misinformation and disinformation.&quot; On March 22, 2004, the suit was dismissed. In January 2009, President George W. Bush denied Peltier&#x27;s clemency petition before leaving office.

In 2016, Peltier&#x27;s attorneys filed a clemency application with the White House&#x27;s Office of the Pardon Attorney, and his supporters organized a campaign to convince President Barack Obama to commute Peltier&#x27;s sentence, a campaign which included an appeal by Pope Francis, as well as James H. Reynolds, a senior attorney and former US Attorney who supervised the prosecution against Peltier in the appeal period following his initial trial. In a letter to the United States Department of Justice, Reynolds wrote that clemency was &quot;in the best interest of justice in considering the totality of all matters involved&quot;. In a subsequent letter to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Reynolds added that the case against Peltier &quot;was a very thin case that likely would not be upheld by courts today. It is a gross overstatement to label Peltier a &#x27;cold-blooded murderer&#x27; on the basis of the minimal proof that survived the appeals in his case.&quot; On January 18, 2017, two days before President Obama left office, the Office of the Pardon Attorney announced that Obama had denied Peltier&#x27;s application for clemency. On June 8, 2018, KFGO Radio in Fargo, N.D., reported that Peltier filed a formal clemency request with President Trump. KFGO obtained and published a letter that was sent by Peltier&#x27;s attorney to the White House. On July 9, 2021, Reynolds wrote a letter to President Biden in which he stated: “I have realized that the prosecution and continued incarceration of Mr. Peltier was and is unjust. We were not able to prove that Mr. Peltier personally committed any offense on the Pine Ridge Reservation.&quot;

On February 6, 2023, Leonard Peltier again made a plea for clemency.

On June 10, 2024, Peltier had his first parole hearing since 2009, with a decision on parole being required to come within 21 days. On July 2, 2024, Peltier was denied parole. After Peltier was denied parole, his lawyer Kevin Sharp stated that an interim hearing to discuss parole was set in 2026, while another full hearing was set for 2039. Ahead of the 2024 parole hearing, Sharp described the hearing as &quot;probably&quot; Peltier&#x27;s &quot;last chance&quot; to make a case for parole. From 2014 until 2025, Peltier was housed at Coleman I, the high-security penitentiary wing of the Coleman Federal Correctional Complex in Coleman, Florida.

===Presidential commutation and release from prison===

On January 19, 2025, the last full day of his presidency, Joe Biden commuted Peltier&#x27;s life sentence to home confinement beginning on February 18, 2025. Peltier was released on that date. His son said that the Turtle Mountain Band has a home arranged for him on the reservation in Belcourt, North Dakota. Upon his release, Peltier&#x27;s younger sister Shelia confirmed to the Minnesota-based newspaper &quot;Star Tribune&quot; that he opted to be transferred to the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation in Belcourt, North Dakota, where he could reunite with his family more. On February 19, 2025, Peltier spoke publicly at Belcourt&#x27;s Sky Dance Casino and Resort during an event welcoming him home.

== Other concerns and incidents ==

=== 2002 editorial about deaths of agents and Anna Mae Aquash ===
In January 2002 in the &quot;News from Indian Country&quot;, publisher Paul DeMain wrote an editorial that an &quot;unnamed delegation&quot; told him that Peltier had murdered the FBI agents. DeMain described the delegation as &quot;grandfathers and grandmothers, AIM activists, pipe carriers and others who have carried a heavy unhealthy burden within them that has taken its toll.&quot; DeMain said he was also told that the motive for the execution-style murder of high-ranking AIM activist Anna Mae Aquash in December 1975 at Pine Ridge &quot;allegedly was her knowledge that Leonard Peltier had shot the two agents, as he was convicted.&quot;

DeMain did not accuse Peltier of participation in the Aquash murder. In 2003 two Native American men were indicted and later convicted of the murder.

On May 1, 2003, Peltier sued DeMain for libel for similar statements about the case published on March 10, 2003, in &quot;News from Indian Country&quot;. On May 25, 2004, Peltier withdrew the suit after he and DeMain settled the case. DeMain issued a statement saying he did not think Peltier was given a fair trial for the two murder convictions, nor did he think Peltier was connected to Aquash&#x27;s death. DeMain stated he did not retract his allegations that Peltier was guilty of the murders of the FBI agents and that the motive for Aquash&#x27;s murder was the fear that she might inform on the activist.

===Indictments and trials for the murder of Aquash===
In 2003, there were federal grand jury hearings on charges against Arlo Looking Cloud and John Graham for the kidnapping, rape and murder of Anna Mae Aquash. Bruce Ellison, Leonard Peltier&#x27;s lawyer since the 1970s, was subpoenaed and invoked his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, refusing to testify. He also refused to testify, on the same grounds, at Looking Cloud&#x27;s trial in 2004. During the trial, the federal prosecutor named Ellison as a co-conspirator in the Aquash case. Witnesses said that Ellison participated in interrogating Aquash about being an FBI informant on December 11, 1975, shortly before her murder.

Leonard Peltier is quoted in We, The People as saying, &quot;I think it was around that December when I heard that Anna Mae was dead. I was in that jail over there in Canada right around whenever they exposed who she really was and what she died from, but I believe I didn&#x27;t hear about it until December.&quot; Peltier had knowledge of Anna Mae Aquash&#x27;s death in December, months before her body was found and her family was notified of her death. 

In February 2004, Fritz Arlo Looking Cloud, an Oglala Sioux, was tried and convicted of the murder of Aquash. In Looking Cloud&#x27;s trial, the prosecution argued that AIM&#x27;s suspicion of Aquash stemmed from her having heard Peltier admit to the murders of the FBI agents. Darlene &quot;Kamook&quot; Nichols, former wife of the AIM leader Dennis Banks, testified that in late 1975, Peltier told of shooting the FBI agents. He was talking to a small group of AIM activists who were fugitives from law enforcement. They included Nichols, her sister Bernie Nichols (later Lafferty), Nichols&#x27; husband Dennis Banks, and Aquash, among several others. Nichols testified that Peltier said, &quot;The motherfucker was begging for his life, but I shot him anyway.&quot; Bernie Nichols-Lafferty gave the same account of Peltier&#x27;s statement. At the time, all were fleeing law enforcement after the Pine Ridge shootout.

Earlier in 1975, AIM member Douglass Durham had been revealed to be an undercover FBI agent and dismissed from the organization. AIM leaders were fearful of infiltration. Other witnesses have testified that, when Aquash was suspected of being an informant, Peltier interrogated her while holding a gun to her head. Peltier and David Hill were said to have Aquash participate in bomb-making so that her fingerprints would be on the bombs. Prosecutors alleged in court documents that the trio planted these bombs at two power plants on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation on Columbus Day 1975.

During the trial, Nichols acknowledged receiving $42,000 from the FBI in connection with her cooperation on the case. She said it was compensation for travel expenses to collect evidence and moving expenses to be farther from her ex-husband Dennis Banks, whom she feared because she had implicated him as a witness. Peltier has claimed that Kamook Nichols committed perjury with her testimony.

No investigation has been opened into the allegedly perjured testimony of Kamook Nichols, now married to a former FBI Chief Agent and living under the name Darlene Ecoffey. During the Looking Cloud trial, the Honorable Lawrence L. Piersol admitted the testimony with the following statement: &quot;The requested testimony is hearsay, but I am going to admit it for a limited purpose only. This is a limiting instruction. It isn&#x27;t admitted nor received for the truth of the matter stated. In other words, whether the rumor is true or not. It is simply received as to what the rumor was. So it is limited to what the rumor was, it is not admitted for the truth of the statement as to whether the rumor was true or not.&quot;

On June 26, 2007, the Supreme Court of British Columbia ordered the extradition of John Graham to the United States to stand trial for his alleged role in the murder of Aquash. He was eventually tried by the state of South Dakota in 2010. During Graham&#x27;s trial, Darlene &quot;Kamook&quot; Ecoffey said Peltier told both her and Aquash that he had killed the FBI agents in 1975. Ecoffey testified under oath, &quot;He (Peltier) held his hand like this&quot;, she said, pointing her index finger like a gun, &quot;and he said &#x27;that (expletive) was begging for his life but I shot him anyway.&#x27;&quot; Graham was convicted of murdering Aquash and sentenced to life in prison.

=== Media interviews ===
In the documentary film &quot;Incident at Oglala&quot; (1992), AIM activist Robert Robideau said that the FBI agents had been shot by a &#x27;Mr X&#x27;. When Peltier was interviewed about &#x27;Mr X&#x27;, he said he knew who the man was. Dino Butler, in a 1995 interview with E.K. Caldwell of &quot;News From Indian Country&quot;, contended that &#x27;Mr X&#x27; was a creation of Peltier&#x27;s supporters and had been named as the murderer in an attempt to gain Peltier&#x27;s release from prison. In a 2001 interview with &quot;News From Indian Country&quot;, Bernie Lafferty said that she had witnessed Peltier&#x27;s referring to his murder of one of the agents.

===Presidential politics===
Peltier was the candidate for the Peace and Freedom Party in the 2004 election for President of the United States. While numerous states have laws that prohibit prison inmates convicted of felonies from voting (Maine and Vermont are exceptions), the United States Constitution has no prohibition against felons being elected to federal offices, including President. The Peace and Freedom Party secured ballot status for Peltier only in California. His presidential candidacy received 27,607 votes, approximately 0.2% of the vote in that state.

In 2020, he ran as the vice-presidential running mate of Gloria La Riva on the ticket of the Party for Socialism and Liberation in the presidential campaign. He was forced to resign from the ticket for health reasons in early August 2020, and was replaced with Sunil Freeman.

===Ruling on FBI documents===
In a February 27, 2006, decision, U.S. District Judge William Skretny ruled that the FBI did not have to release five of 812 documents relating to Peltier and held at their Buffalo field office. He ruled that the particular documents were exempted on the grounds of &quot;national security and FBI agent/informant protection&quot;. In his opinion, Judge Skretny wrote, &quot;Plaintiff has not established the existence of bad faith or provided any evidence contradicting (the FBI&#x27;s) claim that the release of these documents would endanger national security or would impair this country&#x27;s relationship with a foreign government.&quot; In response, Michael Kuzma, a member of Peltier&#x27;s defense team, said, &quot;We&#x27;re appealing. It&#x27;s incredible that it took him 254 days to render a decision.&quot; Kuzma added, &quot;The pages we were most intrigued about revolved around a teletype from Buffalo ... a three-page document that seems to indicate that a confidential source was being advised by the FBI not to engage in conduct that would compromise attorney-client privilege.&quot; Several of Peltier&#x27;s supporters have taken legal action in an attempt to obtain more than 100,000 pages of documents from FBI field offices, claiming that the files should have been turned over at the time of his trial or following a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed soon after.

===Victim of prison violence===
On January 13, 2009, Peltier was beaten by inmates at the United States Penitentiary, Canaan, where he had been transferred from USP Lewisburg. He was sent back to Lewisburg, where he remained until the fall of 2011, when he was transferred to a federal penitentiary in Florida. According to &quot;High Country News&quot; in 2016: &quot;Everywhere he&#x27;s been, inmates have jumped and beaten him, likely with the collusion of guards.&quot;

=== Health issues ===
Over the years in prison, Peltier&#x27;s health has declined and suffers from various ailments; by 2016 his diabetes had led to impaired vision [and] kidney issues. In April 2024, the International Indian Treaty Council (IITC) joined other groups appealing for his parole, citing his declining health: &quot;Mr. Peltier is almost 80 years old and has several compounding health conditions, including kidney disease, diabetes, near-total blindness, and an untreated aortic aneurysm. He requires a wheelchair.&quot; COVID-19 further weakened Peltier, according to his clemency lawyer. Still in prison six months later, and after a recent hospitalization, allies renewed the call for his release, or at least a transfer to a Minnesota prison, where he could be closer to family and friends. They accused the Bureau of Prisons of medical neglect, even &quot;cruel and unusual punishment”, violating the Eighth Amendment. They said Peltier is not getting a healthy diet or insulin treatment for his diabetes and is unable to use his CPAP machine for sleep apnea treatment due to lack of an electrical outlet in his cell. At the time his sentence was commuted in January 2025, Peltier&#x27;s sister Betty Ann informed the &quot;Minnesota Reformer&quot; that Peltier now also uses a walker.

==Prison writings: &quot;My Life Is My Sun Dance&quot;==

===Introduction and Preface===
Chief Arvol Looking Horse and former Attorney Clark Ramsey Clark contributed the introduction and preface, respectively, to &quot;My Life is My Sun Dance&quot;. Chief Looking Horse is a spiritual leader and an activist, who notably was involved in recent protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Clark has provided legal counsel to Peltier in relation to his appeals for clemency.

In his introduction, Chief Looking Horse emphasizes Peltier&#x27;s suffering and role of a Sun Dancer- &quot;...(Peltier) offered himself to Wakan Tanka so that the People might have peace and happiness once again&quot; (pg. ix). Looking Horse also makes a call for the freedom of Peltier, that his freedom mirrors the return of Indigenous land, and that action must be made to ensure these things occur.

Former Attorney General Ramsey Clark notes in his preface that Peltier&#x27;s struggle is representative of human rights and Indigenous rights as a whole, and he is known the whole world over yet seemingly hidden from Americans. He makes a case for Peltier&#x27;s innocence at Pine Ridge, and mentions the repeating of history that has occurred since Wounded Knee in 1973. Clark praises the efforts of the American Indian Movement taking initiative to protect their people, and berates the FBI and American judicial system on their willful ignorance of Peltier&#x27;s case of innocence (pg. xxi).

In both the preface and introduction, these figureheads—one who champions Indigenous peoples’ rights, and the other who has worked extensively within the American judicial system—both call for the release of Peltier.

===Part i – In My Own Voice===
Leonard Peltier starts his memoir by explaining the uncomfortable and unsafe conditions in which he writes his passages. He expresses gratitude, welcoming his reader, unsure if his book will ever reach anyone. Despite his worries, his writing is personal, soaked in a humanizing tone of not only himself but of his reader. Peltier explains his intention behind writing his personal testimony on the 23rd year of his life sentence, proclaiming, &quot;[I&#x27;m writing] not because I&#x27;m planning to die, but because I&#x27;m planning to live&quot; (p. 8). He spends much of this part reclaiming his identity, commonly restating his names, both Leonard Peltier and Gwarth-ee-lass, to allow his reader to view him as a person beyond any other label or event that has been used to strip him of his identity. As an Indigenous man to the Great Turtle Island, Peltier writes about his struggle against imprisonment, not as his sole struggle but as a struggle of his people, a struggle he would continue to endure for his people. He does not view himself as powerful until he aligns himself with his people, and only then does he find strength in the struggle he endures. Furthermore, he talks about the wisdom passed down to him from elders, that speaking out from the heart against injustice is the duty of all and is an Indigenous way of living. Peltier gives a detailed account of Sun Dance, a spiritual ceremony in which one sacrifices his flesh and life to the Great Spirit. This spiritual journey, like his Indigenous ancestors, allows him to resist his oppressors rather than abandon his people. As a Sun Dancer, he embodies an unbreakable resistance often misunderstood by settlers. Through the parts that follow, he shows the reader the power behind Sun Dance.

===Part ii – Who I Am===
In part 2 of &quot;My Life is My Sun Dance&quot;, Peltier discusses what it means to be Indigenous in North America but more specifically the United States. He explains that his story is not specific to him but &quot;is the story of my people, the Indian people of this Great Turtle Island.&quot; He discusses some key point in history that outline what he describes as a history saddened in tragedy, deceit, and genocide. He describes how Indigenous peoples&#x27; lands have been stolen from them and how they were pushed onto reservations. He describes the events of the Wounded Knee Massacre, South Dakota on December 29, 1890, which was a crucial part in what he describes as the genocide of Indigenous people. He also describes how the genocide is being carried on into modern day by citing statistics such as the fact that some of the highest levels of poverty, unemployment, infant mortality, and teen suicide rates in the country are on the reservations in South Dakota. He highlights the American Indian Movement which has sought to reveal to the world the crimes against humanity that were committed against Indigenous people. Part 2 also contains a poem titled &quot;an eagle&#x27;s cry&quot; which is about wanting to be heard as the lines &quot;Listen to me!&quot; and &quot;hear us&quot; are uttered many times throughout.

===Part iii – Growing Up Indian===
Peltier writes about the importance of names in this section of his memoir. As they relate to Indigenous identity, Peltier notes how names give individuals a sense of who they are and their possibilities. He highlights that names provide individuals with something to live up to and that names can point to where a person is supposed to be in life. Peltier explains the different names he has, such as Tate Wikuw, which translates to &quot;Wind Chases the Sun&quot; in the Dakota language, which was his great-grandfather&#x27;s name, and Gwarth-ee-lass which translates to &quot;He Leads the People&quot; (Peltier 61). This section of his memoir also showcases the struggles of Indigenous sovereignty and agency, as Peltier notes that he, along with every other person of the Ikce Wicasa (the Common/Original people), have their land and identities under occupation. He highlights the frequency of racial profiling of Indigenous people like himself and how the prison–industrial complex (PIC) targets and thrives off of them. Peltier illuminates the genocidal projects of the PIC by showcasing the harmful effects of colonization, and the PIC replicating colonization in prisons, these systems have had on Indigenous peoples.

===Part iv – Becoming Political===
Peltier writes about his entry into and work for Indigenous movements. Upon seeing Indigenous people being brutalized for trying to maintain and protect their rights, which are guaranteed under federal treaties and not upheld by the U.S. government, he began fighting for civil and Indigenous rights with AIM. He discusses how the U.S. government was primarily interested in taking Indigenous land through means of brutalization, murder, and wrongful incarceration for colonial and extractive reasons. As an AIM member, he participated in the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) takeover in November 1972, which began as a peace march called the &quot;Trail of Broken Treaties&quot; that escalated due to BIA and security officials attempting to forcefully remove protestors. He also worked with AIM to help find work for Indigenous people and worked in an alcohol rehab program, as well as spiritual work. In 1975, Peltier arrived at the Oglala nation to help protect the Indigenous people living there who were being murdered. He and other AIM warriors were sent to defend the residents of the land, not as a para-military force. However, they were ambushed and forced to defend themselves with the small supply of defensive arms they had. Peltier reflects on how the government hid information and lied to place blame on him and AIM members as aggressors in the exchange.

===Part v – That Day at Oglala===
This section goes over Peltier&#x27;s recounting of the day of the attack on his people at Oglala that led to his eventual arrest and imprisonment. Peltier was staying in a &quot;tent city&quot; with other AIM members on Harry and Cecilia Jumping Bull&#x27;s property. The Lakota Elders had asked for their protection from the GOON squads who had been &quot;terrorizing&quot; the Pine Ridge Reservation &quot;for months&quot; (Peltier 126). On June 26, 1975, their group, which included women, children, and elders, was attacked by &quot;lawmen, GOONs, SWAT teams, vigilantes, BIA police, you name it&quot; (129). Peltier&#x27;s group did not want to immediately retaliate. However, two FBI agents, Jack R. Coler and Ronald A. Williams were killed and the violence against Peltier&#x27;s group escalated. Despite being convicted for their murders, Peltier denies killing the two FBI agents and says that he would have tried to stop whoever was the true assailant. Peltier and his people managed to escape the attack and all survived, except for Joe Killsright Stuntz. While running away, the group stopped for prayer and Peltier says they were led to safety by an eagle. Peltier thanks those who gave them sanctuary after the attack and those who cheered on and aided their escape. While Peltier&#x27;s group hid, police went on a large manhunt and terrorized the Pine Ridge Reservation looking for them. Elders in Peltier&#x27;s group decided they would hide until Sun Dance in August where they could thank Wakan Tanka for saving their lives, but police caught and arrested members of the group one by one until Peltier decided to flee to Canada. He hoped for safety among the Indigenous communities there and possibly being granted political asylum, as he did not trust the American government to give him a fair trial, or even to let him live.

===Part vi – A Life in Hell===
Peltier accounts his arrest in Canada on February 6, 1976. Following his arrest, the FBI suborned and coerced Myrtle Poor Bear to provide false affidavits against Peltier, claiming she was an eyewitness to the killing of two FBI agents on the Pine Ridge Reservation in June 1975 and an ex-girlfriend of Peltier&#x27;s. Despite Peltier&#x27;s unjust and inhumane treatment since his arrest in Canada, he refuses to be made a victim, emphasizing his status as a warrior who finds his strength in Sun Dance. After being falsely promised a fair trial, Peltier signed the extradition papers to facilitate his return to the United States, where he received two life sentences on June 1, 1977, and was transferred to the U.S. Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas. The FBI elaborately orchestrated Peltier&#x27;s sentencing through fabricated evidence and &quot;willful illegality&quot; as they desperately needed a public &quot;scapegoat&quot; to pay for the deaths of two of their agents. Peltier describes the &quot;unconstitutional&quot; treatment he has experienced since his imprisonment, including surviving an assassination plot and prison escape during his transfer to Lompoc prison in 1979. Further, Peltier recounts a recurring and changing dream he experienced while in solitary confinement, which he conveys in the form of a story titled &quot;The Last Battle&quot;. Peltier also describes the &quot;&quot;inipi&quot;, or sweat-lodge ceremony&quot; he participated in every Saturday at Leavenworth, through which he was able to feel a “blessed freedom” and total escape despite his imprisonment.

===Part vii – A Message to Humanity===
In the final section of his memoir, Peltier envisions humanity&#x27;s mutual future. He discusses the necessity of respect, compassion, and collaboration among all people. He encourages the reader to celebrate humanity&#x27;s differences and to find strength in togetherness and common humanity. He finds hope in children and anticipates a &quot;Great Healing&quot; toward a better future. To realize this vision, Peltier emphasizes the necessity for sincere effort and change in the present. He writes about the importance of individual action and underlines the need for Indigenous sovereignty.

<text>LambdaMOO is an online community of the variety called a MOO. It is the oldest MOO today.

&quot;LambdaMOO&quot; was founded in 1990 by Pavel Curtis at Xerox PARC. Now hosted in the state of Washington, it is operated and administered entirely on a volunteer basis. Guests are allowed, and membership is free to anyone with an e-mail address.

&quot;LambdaMOO&quot; gained some notoriety when Julian Dibbell wrote a book called &quot;My Tiny Life&quot; describing his experiences there. Over its history, &quot;LambdaMOO&quot; has been highly influential in the examination of virtual-world social issues.

==History==
LambdaMOO has its roots in the 1978–1980 work by Roy Trubshaw and Richard Bartle to create and expand the concept of Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) – virtual communities. Around 1987–1988, the expansion of the global Internet allowed more users to experience the MUD. Pavel Curtis at Xerox PARC noted that they were &quot;almost exclusively for recreational purposes.&quot; Curtis determined to explore whether the MUD could be non-recreational. He developed &quot;LambdaMOO&quot; software to run on the LambdaMOO server, which implements the MOO programming language. This software was subsequently made available to the public. Several starter databases, known as cores, are available for MOOs; &quot;LambdaMOO&quot; itself uses the LambdaCore database. The &quot;Lambda&quot; name is from Curtis&#x27;s own username on earlier MUD systems.

LambdaMOO can refer to the software, the server, or the community of users.

==Geography==
&quot;LambdaMOO&quot; central geography was based on Pavel Curtis&#x27;s California home. New players and guests traditionally connected in &quot;The Coat Closet&quot;, but a second area, &quot;The Linen Closet&quot; (specially programmed as a silent area) was later added as an alternative connection point. The coat closet opens onto the center of the house in The Living Room, a common hangout and place for conversation; its fixtures include a fireplace (where things can be roasted), The Living Room Couch (which periodically causes players&#x27; objects to &#x27;fall through&#x27; to underneath the couch), and a pet Cockatoo who repeats overheard phrases (which is sometimes found with its beak gagged). Occasionally, the Cockatoo is replaced with a more seasonal creature: a Turkey near Thanksgiving, a Raven near Halloween, et cetera.

To the north of the Living Room is the Entrance Hall, the Front Yard, and a limited residential area along LambdaStreet. There is an extensive subterranean complex located down the manhole, including a sewage system. Players walking to the far west along LambdaStreet may be given the option to &#x27;jump off the edge of the world&#x27;, which disables access to their account for three months.

To the south of the Living Room is a pool deck, a hot tub, and some of the extensive grounds of the mansion, featuring gardens, hot air balloon landing pads, open fields, fishing holes, and the like.

To the northwest of the living room are the laundry room, garage, dining room, smoking room, drawing room, housekeeper&#x27;s quarters, and kitchen.

To the east of the entry hall, hallways provide access to some individual rooms, the Linen Closet, and to the eastern wing of the house. In the eastern wing can be found the Library of online books, the Museum of generic objects (which account-holders may create instances of), and an extensive area for the &quot;LambdaMOO&quot; RPG.

Since the creation of the original LambdaMOO map, many users have expanded the MOO by making additional rooms with the command &quot;@dig.&quot;

==Politics==
While most MOOs are run by administrative fiat, in summer of 1993 &quot;LambdaMOO&quot; implemented a petition/ballot mechanism, allowing the community to propose and vote on new policies and other administrative actions. A petition may be created by anyone eligible to participate in politics (those who have maintained accounts at the MOO for at least 30 days), can be signed by other players, and may then be submitted for administrative &#x27;vetting&#x27;. Once vetted, the petition has a limited time to collect enough signatures to become valid and be made into a ballot. Ballots are subsequently voted on; those with a 66% approval rating are passed and will be implemented. This system suffered quite a lot of evolution and eventually passed into a state where wizards took back the power they&#x27;d passed into the hands of the people, but still maintain the ballot system as a way for the community to express its opinions.

==Demographics==
The population of &quot;LambdaMOO&quot; numbered close to 10,000 around 1994, with over 300 actively connected at any time.

<text>The lorica segmentata (), also called lorica lamminata, or banded armour is a type of personal armour that was used by soldiers of the Roman army, consisting of metal strips fashioned into circular bands, fastened to internal leather straps.

The &quot;lorica segmentata&quot; has come to be viewed as symbolic of the Roman legions in popular culture.
== Name ==
In Latin, the name &quot;lorica segmentata&quot; translates to &quot;segmented cuirass.&quot; However, this name was not given to the armor by the Romans. Instead, it was given by scholars in the 16th century. Despite the lack of knowledge on the Roman name for the armor, scholars can make educated guesses on the Roman name. It is obvious the name had the word &quot;lorica&quot; in it. However, the following part of the name is unknown. Some scholars believe that the name was &quot;lorica lamminata&quot;. This theory is based on the Romans referring to sheets of metal as lamina, although no firm evidence for any theory regarding the name of the armor currently exists.

== History ==
Despite the armor being commonly associated with the Romans, the technology behind the &quot;lorica segmentata&quot; was old by the time it was introduced into the Roman infantry. The Dendra panoply is an example from the 15th century BC of articulated plate defense using a similar technique of overlapping curved plates. Laminated armor was also used by the Parthians and possibly the Dacians, Scythians, or Sarmatians before the Romans adopted it. Some sets of limb armor of this type combined with scale armor dating back to the 4th century BC have been found in archaeological sites located in the steppe. It is possible the Manica (armguard) was worn by gladiators before it was introduced for military use. 

Although the exact time at which the Romans adopted the armor remains unknown, it is possible that the &quot;lorica segmentata&quot; was introduced after Crassus&#x27; defeat at Carrhae in 53 BC. Another possibility is that the armor was adopted in 21 AD after the Revolt of Julius Sacrovir and Julius Florus. Since an archeological research conducted in Kalkriese confirmed that the soldiers at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD wore the &quot;lorica segmentata&quot;, it is assumed that this armor must have been in use before 9 AD. 

Around the middle of the third century the &quot;lorica segmentata&quot; fell out of favor with the Roman army, although it did remain in use during the Late Roman Empire. Soldiers wearing the &quot;lorica segmentata&quot; were depicted on the Arch of Constantine, a monument erected in Rome in 315. However, it has been argued that these depictions are from an earlier monument by Marcus Aurelius, from which Constantine the Great incorporated portions into his Arch. The latest known use of the armor was therefore in the 4th century.

Over time the type of &quot;lorica segmentata&quot; would change. From 9 BC to 43 AD the Roman soldier wore the Dangstetten-Kalkriese-Vindonissa types, from 69 to 100 the Corbridge-Carnuntum type was used. From 164 to 180, the Newstead type was used. The time the armors were used overlapped. It is possible that there was a fourth type, covering the body with segmented armor joined to scale shoulder defenses. However, this is only known from one badly damaged statue originating at Alba Iulia in Romania. This armor was used from about 14 BC to the late 3rd century AD. The &quot;lorica segmentata&#x27;s&quot; use in the Roman army was geographically widespread, but the mail armor &quot;lorica hamata&quot; may have been more common at all times.

== Construction ==

The plates in the &quot;lorica segmentata&quot; armor were made by overlapping ferrous plates that were then riveted to straps made from leather. It is unknown what animal was used to make the leather and if it was tanned or tawed. The plates were made of soft iron on the inside and rolled mild steel on the outside. This made the plates hardened against damage without making them brittle. This case hardening was done by packing organic matter tightly around them and heating them in a forge, transferring carbon from the burnt materials into the surface of the metal. The plates were made from beating out ingots. 

The strips were arranged horizontally on the body, overlapping downwards, and they surrounded the torso in two halves, being fastened at the front and back. Additional strips, shoulder guards, breastplates, and backplates were used to protect the upper body and the shoulders. The form of the armor allowed it to be stored very compactly, since it was possible to separate it into four sections, each of which would collapse on itself into a compact mass. The fitments that closed the various plate sections together (buckles, lobate hinges, hinged straps, tie-hooks, tie-rings, etc.) were made of brass. In later variants dating from around 75–80 C.E., the fastenings of the armor were simplified. 

Bronze hinges were removed in favor of simple rivets, belt fastenings used small hooks, and the lowest two girdle plates were replaced by one broad plate. The component parts of the &quot;lorica segmentata&quot; moved in synchronization with the other parts. This made the armor more flexible. The armor was very long lasting. The Kalkriese type of armor lasted 55 years, the Corbridge armor lasted 70 years, and the Newsteadtype lasted 90 years. 

== Usage ==

It is unclear who used this armor. On monuments, &quot;Auxilia&quot; are generally shown wearing mail, not cuirasses, and carrying oval shields. Roman depictions of legionaries, such as those found on Trajan&#x27;s column often depict them wearing the &quot;lorica segmentata&quot;. On this basis, it has been supposed that &quot;lorica segmentata&quot; was exclusively used by legionaries and praetorians. However, some historians consider Trajan&#x27;s Column to be inaccurate as a historical source due to its inaccurate and stylized portrayal of Roman armor. These historians also say that &quot;it is probably safest to interpret the Column reliefs as &#x27;impressions&#x27;, rather than accurate representations.&quot; 

The discovery of parts of the &quot;lorica segmentata&quot; at areas where auxiliary soldiers would have been stationed implies that auxiliary troops used the &quot;lorica segmentata&quot;. However, it is entirely possible that the reason behind the presence of the &quot;lorica segmentata&quot; in these areas could be that these areas had a small number of legionaries stationed there. On the Adamclisi &quot;Tropaeum&quot;, the &quot;lorica segmentata&quot; does not appear at all, and legionaries and &quot;auxilia&quot; alike are depicted wearing the &quot;lorica squamata&quot;. Some experts are of the opinion that the Adamclisi monument is a more accurate portrayal of the situation.

It may have been used rarely, maybe only for set-piece battles and parades. This viewpoint considers the figures in Trajan&#x27;s Column to be highly stereotyped, in order to distinguish clearly between different types of troops. It&#x27;s also debated if the lorica segmentata was only used in the west. Every archaeological find of such armor has been made in the western part of the Roman Empire but never in the east.

== Cultural impact ==

The tendency to portray Roman legionaries clad in this type of armour often extends to periods of time that are too early or too late in history.

<doc id="18224" wikidata="Q3122718" url="?curid=18224" title="Known Space">
<text>Known Space is the fictional setting of about a dozen science fiction novels and several collections of short stories by American writer Larry Niven. It has also become a shared universe in the spin-off &quot;Man-Kzin Wars&quot; anthologies. The Internet Speculative Fiction Database (ISFDB) catalogs all works set in the fictional universe that includes Known Space under the series name Tales of Known Space, which was the title of a 1975 collection of Niven&#x27;s short stories. The first-published work in the series, which was Niven&#x27;s first published piece, was &quot;The Coldest Place&quot;, in the December 1964 issue of &quot;If&quot; magazine, edited by Frederik Pohl. This was the first-published work in the 1975 collection.

The stories span approximately one thousand years of future history, from the first human explorations of the Solar System to the colonization of dozens of nearby systems. Late in the series, Known Space is an irregularly shaped &quot;bubble&quot; about 60 light-years across.

The epithet &quot;Known Space&quot; refers to a small region in the Milky Way galaxy, one centered on Earth. In the future that the series depicts, spanning roughly the third millennium, humans have explored this region and colonized many of its worlds. Contact has been made with other species, such as the two-headed Pierson&#x27;s Puppeteers and the aggressive felinoid Kzinti. Stories in the Known Space series include events and places outside of the region called &quot;Known Space&quot; such as the Ringworld, the Pierson&#x27;s Puppeteers&#x27; Fleet of Worlds and the Pak homeworld.

The Tales were originally conceived as two separate series, the &quot;Belter&quot; stories set roughly from 2000 to 2350 CE and the &quot;Neutron Star&quot; / &quot;Ringworld&quot; stories set in 2651 CE and later. The earlier, &quot;Belter&quot; period features solar-system colonization and slower-than-light travel with fusion-powered and Bussard ramjet ships. The later, &quot;Neutron Star&quot;, period features faster-than-light ships using &quot;hyperdrive&quot;. Niven implicitly joined the two settings as a single fictional universe in the short story &quot;A Relic of the Empire&quot; (&quot;If&quot;, December 1966), by using background elements of the Slaver civilization from the &quot;Belter&quot; series as a plot element in the faster-than-light setting. In the late 1980s—having written almost no Tales of Known Space in more than a decade—Niven opened the 300-year gap in the Known Space timeline as a shared universe, and the stories of the &quot;Man-Kzin Wars&quot; volumes fill in that history, bridging the two settings.

==Locations==
One aspect of the &quot;Known Space&quot; universe is that most of the early human colonies are on planets suboptimal for &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. During the first phase of human interstellar colonization (i.e. before humanity acquired FTL), simple robotic probes were sent to nearby stars to assess their planets for habitation. The programming of these probes was flawed: they sent back a &quot;good for colonization&quot; message if they found a habitable &quot;point&quot;, rather than a habitable &quot;planet&quot;. Sleeper ships containing human colonists were sent to the indicated star systems. Too often, those colonists had to make the best of a bad situation.

=== Solar System ===
* Earth, the human homeworld, is ruled by the United Nations, a direct democracy, but not a utopia. An important organization is the ARM, a global police force tasked to deal with organlegging and crimes committed by cutting-edge technologies. For centuries, due to the perfection of organ transplant technology, all state executions were done in hospitals to provide organ transplants, and to maximize their availability nearly &quot;all&quot; crimes carried the death penalty, including such offenses as multiple traffic tickets or tax evasion. This period ended when Jack Brennan, who had consumed the Tree-of-Life root and become a human version of the Pak Protector, used his superior intelligence to engineer social change in medical technology and social attitudes that eventually reduced the use of organ banks to reasonable levels. Part of Brennan&#x27;s manipulation was the development of a science known as &quot;psychistry&quot;. Psychistry was used to &quot;correct&quot; all forms of &quot;mental aberration&quot; – the populace is extremely docile. To combat overpopulation (one estimate is 18 billion people), a license is required to procreate, only available after exhaustive testing has determined that a prospect is free of &quot;abnormalities&quot;; unlicensed procreation is a capital crime. This policy, in addition to the existence of the transfer booth and a one-world language and economy, has led to the populace eventually becoming fairly genetically homogeneous. To prevent the development of new WMDs, all scientific research is regulated by the government and potentially dangerous technology is suppressed. Due to such suppression, Earth has had fewer real breakthroughs in science than would be expected. A common title for people born on Earth is &quot;Flatlander&quot;; having been born and raised in the only environment in Known Space to which humans are well-adapted, they are considered naïve and a bit helpless by humans from colony worlds.
* The Moon is a separate entity, with its own distinct culture but is under the control of the same government as Earth. Humans native to the Moon are called &quot;Lunies&quot;, and tend toward tall, lean body types regularly reaching eight feet in height. They are frequently referred to as looking much like Tolkien&#x27;s Elves due to their physiques and alien allure.
* Mars, fourth planet in the Solar System and the first planetary colony in Known Space. Native &quot;Martians&quot; were exterminated by the Brennan genocide. No one goes there, as resources are easier to mine in the Belt and Jovian moons. Earth ultimately colonized Mars specifically to study the descent landing pod used by Phssthpok the Pak in 2124 AD and the research colony was still in existence in 2183 when the Martians were exterminated by Brennan. The colony expanded greatly during the first Man–Kzin war 2367–2433.
* The Sol Belt possesses an abundance of valuable ores, which are easily accessible due to the low to negligible gravity of the rocks containing them. Originally a harsh frontier under U.N. control, the Belt declared independence after creating Confinement Asteroid, a habitat with spin gravity that permitted safe gestation of children, and Farmer&#x27;s Asteroid, the Belt&#x27;s primary food source. Almost immediately a lively competition began between the fiercely independent &quot;Belters&quot; and the technology police of the U.N. Several years of tension and economic conflicts followed, but soon settled into a relatively peaceful trade relationship as the Belt has so many resources that the UN and the Earth need.
* Mercury is also a colony world with a small number of inhabitants, used mainly for mining and as a gravitational anchor for orbiting solar power stations which beam power to the more remote colonies using gigantic lasers. At the time of the First Man–Kzin War, human society is so pacifistic that no weapons exist; those who are able to even contemplate killing another sentient being or constructing a weapon for that purpose are regarded as mental aberrations and must take drugs to control their thoughts. However, an enormous laser, whether constructed as a weapon or not, makes a highly effective one, and it is strongly implied that the existence of the Mercury power satellites is a large part of what enabled Sol System to hold off the Kzinti in the early part of the war.

=== Other planets ===
* Down is the home world of the Grogs and a former Kzinti colony. It orbits &quot;L5-1668&quot;, a faint, cool M-type star, significantly redder and cooler than Sol and 12.3 light-years from it. Down is made habitable in part because of its large moon, Sheila. Grogs, though friendly, are feared by humanity, due to their telepathic ability to control the minds of animals (and possibly sentient species as well). Because of this fear, humans have placed a Bussard ramjet field generator in close orbit around Down&#x27;s sun, thus enabling them to destroy the Grog population should they ever take hostile action against any sentient species.
* Jinx, orbiting Sirius A, is a massive moon of a gas giant (called &quot;Primary&quot;), stretched by tidal forces into an egg shape and tidally locked. It has habitable areas but has high surface gravity of 1.78 times Earth, near the limits of human extended tolerance. The points nearest to and farthest from Primary (called the &quot;East&quot; and &quot;West&quot; ends) lie elevated out of the atmosphere in vacuum. The atmosphere of the belt-region halfway between them is too dense and too hot to breathe, and is inhabited only by the Bandersnatchi. The zones between the vacuum areas and the high-density belt area have atmosphere breathable by humans. Jinx&#x27;s &quot;East&quot; and &quot;West&quot; ends become a major &quot;in vacuo&quot; manufacturing area. Jinxian humans are short and squat, the strongest bipeds in Known Space. They tend to die early, from heart and circulatory problems. There is a tourist industry which provides substantial useful interplanetary trade credits for the Bandersnatchi, who allow themselves to be hunted by humans under strict protocols.
* Wunderland is a planet circling Alpha Centauri, and was the earliest extra-solar colony in Known Space&#x27;s human history. It has a surface gravity of 60% that of Earth&#x27;s and is hospitable to human life. Wunderland was invaded and its population enslaved by the Kzinti during the first Man–Kzin War. It was freed near the end of the First War by the human Hyperdrive Armada from We Made It. The system has an asteroid belt in the shape of a crescent, which gives it its name—the Serpent Swarm. The capital asteroid, Tiamat, houses one of the largest Kzin populations in Known Space.
* We Made It, orbiting Procyon A, got its name because the first colony ship crash-landed. Gravity is about three-fifths Earth&#x27;s. The planet&#x27;s axis is pointed along the plane of its ecliptic (like Uranus), creating ferocious winds on the order of during half of the planet&#x27;s year, forcing the people to live underground. Natives are known as &quot;Crashlanders&quot;, tend to be very tall, and many are albinos. Their capital, which was the site of their colony ship&#x27;s landing, is called Crashlanding City. We Made It also has viscous, algae-choked &quot;oceans&quot; and a big icy moon, ironically named Desert Isle.
* Plateau in the Tau Ceti system is Venus-like, with a plateau (called Mount Lookitthat), half the size of California, rising high enough out of the dense atmosphere to be habitable. Inhabitants (&quot;Mountaineers&quot;) are divided into two rigid hereditary castes, the &quot;crew&quot; and the &quot;colonists&quot;, depending on whether their ancestors piloted the colonizing vessel. The crew are the upper caste, and hold power through their monopoly on organ transplantation and control of the police. The original colonists signed the &quot;Covenant of Planetfall&quot;, agreeing that this outcome was just recompense for the labors of the crew during the voyage; that they signed at gunpoint as they were awakened from hibernation is kept secret from later generations, and also that those who refused, died. This repressive system is overthrown in &quot;A Gift From Earth&quot;, and the former inequality and caste system appears to have disappeared by the time &quot;The Ethics of Madness&quot; takes place.
* Home orbits the star Epsilon Indi, about 12 light years from Earth. The planet received its name because of its remarkable similarity to Earth; its day is nearly 24 hours long and its surface gravity is a comfortable 1.08 g. Oceans, mean global temperature, seasons, and moon (Home&#x27;s moon is called Metaluna, but is often referred to as &quot;the Moon&quot; by Homers) are also similar. According to &quot;Protector&quot;, the original colonists had planned to call their world &quot;Flatland&quot; as a sort of joke, but once settled on Home they had changed their minds—&quot;a belated attack of patriotism&quot;, Elroy Truesdale of &quot;Protector&quot; muses. The entire population of Home is secretly destroyed as a consequence of Brennan&#x27;s and Truesdale&#x27;s war with the Pak—Brennan turns the entire population into human Protectors to create an army to fight the Pak invaders. Home is resettled quickly though, since another ramjet with colonists is already on its way when the colony &quot;fails&quot;. In &quot;Procrustes&quot; and other later stories, Home is once again presented as a vibrant colony.
* Canyon was once an uninhabitable Mars-like world known as Warhead. It is the second of seven planets around p Eridani A, 22 light-years from Earth. It was used as a military outpost by the Kzinti, until the planet was hit by a weapon called the &quot;Wunderland Treatymaker&quot; during the Third War. The attack tore a long, narrow, kilometers-deep crater into the crust approximately the size of the Baja Peninsula. The air and moisture in the thin atmosphere gathered at the bottom of this artificial canyon, creating a breathable environment, complete with a sea at the bottom. The planet was then renamed for the crater, and settled by humans in a huge city running up the crater wall. Archaic (hyper-aggressive and intractable) Kzinti were entombed in stasis field shells during the attack and are still beneath the lava, and someday, somebody will have to deal with them. The attack by the Wunderland Treatymaker is detailed as a part of &quot;Destiny&#x27;s Forge&quot; by Paul Chafe, a part of the Man–Kzin Wars shared universe.
* Gummidgy is a jungle world popular with hunters. It is home to the Gummidgy Orchid-Thing, a sessile carnivore which hangs from trees and is a popular trophy for the wealthy. It orbits CY Aquarii, a blue giant SX Phoenicis variable star; due to the resulting high levels of ultraviolet light, most humans (except Jinxians) require melanin-boosting medication to venture outdoors.
* Fafnir is a former Kzin colony covered almost entirely in water. When under Kzinti control it was called Shasht, a Kzin word meaning &quot;burrowing murder&quot;. It was captured by humans during the Man–Kzin Wars. Humans and Kzinti now cohabitate. The humans prefer to live on the coral islands while the Kzinti prefer the single large continent which they continue to call Shasht.
* Margrave is a late addition to the family of Human colonies. In the &quot;Ringworld&quot; era it is still a frontier world, and is home to enormous birds the inhabitants have dubbed &quot;rocs&quot;. It orbits Lambda Serpentis (27 Serpentis), a G0 star 34.7 light-years from Earth. It is named after its discoverer, J. Margrave Julland.
* Silvereyes is, at the time of &quot;Ringworld&quot;, the furthest Human world from Earth (21.3 light-years, 60 days at Quantum-I hyperdrive speeds), orbiting Beta Hydri. In Niven&#x27;s obscure story &quot;The Color of Sunfire&quot; it has entire continents covered with Slaver sunflowers (bred as defense for Thrint manors, they focus sunlight using silver leaves as parabolic reflectors), giving it an appearance from orbit of having &quot;silver eyes&quot;. The &quot;Man–Kzin Wars&quot; books, conversely, have it entirely covered by a world ocean, with groves of sunflowers growing up from the bottom of the ocean. The &quot;Ringworld Roleplaying Game&quot; describes it as an ocean planet dotted with island shield volcanoes.
* Hearth is the homeworld of the Pierson&#x27;s Puppeteers. With a population of around one trillion, it is covered by arcologies, most over one mile tall. Its industries and population generate so much waste heat it no longer requires a star for warmth (the four other &quot;farmworlds&quot;, simply named &quot;Nature Preserves&quot; or NP1, NP2, etc., use artificial orbital lights to grow food). Together these five planets (with a sixth added later, as detailed in &quot;Fleet of Worlds&quot;) are often referred as the Fleet of Worlds and do not orbit any star, but use Outsider-manufactured drives to move in order to flee the galactic core explosion discovered by Beowulf Schaeffer. They orbit about each other in a Klemperer rosette.
* Kobold was a tiny artificial world created in the outer Sol system by Jack Brennan, a human Protector, composed of a small sphere of neutronium in the center ringed by a larger torus. Gravity generators facilitated movement between the two sections and were used in games and art. Brennan destroyed Kobold just prior to leaving for his war with the Pak Protectors.
* The Ringworld is an artificial world structure with three million times the surface area of Earth, built in the shape of a giant ring circling its sun, a million miles wide and with a diameter of 186 million miles. It was built by the Pak, who either abandoned it, or more likely died out much as the Earth Pak did, due to a lack of the Tree-of-Life, a yamlike root which produces the conversion to Protector-stage Pak (which required a very specifically targeted soil chemistry to grow). It is inhabited by a number of different evolved hominid species, and includes representative samples of Bandersnatchi, Martians and Kzinti, and possibly other alien races that existed at the time of its construction.
* Sheathclaws is a planet colonized by humans aboard &quot;Angel&#x27;s Pencil&quot; and descendants of a rogue Kzin telepath. It orbits an as-yet-unspecified star 98 light-years from Earth, and kept its existence secret for several centuries. The Patriarchy would dearly love to capture the entire population of potential Telepaths and press them into service.
* Kzin (so called by Humans) is the homeworld of the Kzinti. Its name in the Hero&#x27;s Tongue translates as &quot;Home-of-the-Kzinti&quot; or &quot;Kzinhome&quot;. It orbits 61 Ursae Majoris and has higher gravity than Earth and more oxygen in the atmosphere. It has two moons, known as the Hunter&#x27;s Moon and the Traveler&#x27;s Moon.
* Cue Ball is an uninhabitable ice world orbiting Beta Lyrae.
* Jm&#x27;ho is a moon similar to Europa, homeworld to the Gw&#x27;oth. It orbits a gas giant called Tl&#x27;ho. The star is simply called G567-X2 in the Puppeteers&#x27; catalogue
* Kl&#x27;mo is a Gw&#x27;oth colony founded by Ol&#x27;t&#x27;ro. Not much is explained about this world, except that it seems very primitive and has a very strong gravity.
* Oceanus is a primitive world briefly surveyed by the crew of &quot;Explorer&quot; in &quot;Fleet of Worlds&quot;.

==Technology==
The series features a number of &quot;superscience&quot; inventions which figure as plot devices. Stories earlier in the timeline feature technology such as Bussard ramjets and drouds (wires capable of directly stimulating the pleasure centers of the brain), and explore how organ transplantation technology enables the new crime of &quot;organlegging&quot; (as well as the general sociological effects of widespread transplant technology), while later stories feature hyperdrive, invulnerable starship hulls, stasis fields, molecular monofilaments, transfer booths (teleporters used only on planetary surfaces), the lifespan-extending drug boosterspice, and the tasp which is an extension of the droud which works without direct contact.

===Boosterspice===
&quot;Boosterspice&quot; is a compound that increases the longevity and reverses aging of human beings. With the use of boosterspice, humans can easily live hundreds of years and, theoretically, indefinitely.

Developed by the Institute of Knowledge on Jinx, it is said to be made from genetically engineered ragweed (although early stories have it ingested in the form of edible seeds). In &quot;Ringworld&#x27;s Children&quot;, it is suggested boosterspice may actually be adapted from Tree-of-Life, without the symbiotic virus that enabled hominids to metamorphose from Pak Breeder stage to Pak Protector stage (mutated Pak breeders were the ancestors of both &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; and the hominids of the Ringworld).

On the Ringworld, there is an analogous (and apparently more potent) compound developed from Tree-of-Life, but they are mutually incompatible; in &quot;The Ringworld Engineers&quot;, Louis Wu learns that the character Halrloprillalar died when in ARM custody after leaving the Ringworld, as a result of having taken boosterspice after having used the Ringworld equivalent. Boosterspice only works on &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, whereas the Tree-of-Life compound will work on any hominid descended from the Pak.

===Hyperdrive===
Faster-than-light (FTL) propulsion, or hyperdrive, was obtained from the Outsiders at the end of the First Man–Kzin War. In addition to winning the war for humanity, it allowed the re-integration of all the human colonies, which were previously separated by distance. Standard (Quantum I) hyperdrive covers a distance of one light-year every three days (121.75 &quot;c&quot;). A more advanced Quantum II hyperdrive introduced later is able to cover the same distance in one and a quarter minutes (420,768 &quot;c&quot;).

In Niven&#x27;s first novel, &quot;World of Ptavvs&quot;, the hyperdrive used by the Thrintun required a ship to be going faster than 93% of the speed of light. However, this is the only time that hyperdrive is described this way.

In the vast majority of &quot;Known Space&quot; material, hyperdrive requires that a ship be outside a star&#x27;s gravity well to use. Ships which activate hyperdrive close to a star are likely to disappear without a trace. This effect is regarded as a limitation based on the laws of physics. In Niven&#x27;s novel &quot;Ringworld&#x27;s Children&quot; the Ringworld itself is converted into a gigantic Quantum II hyperdrive and launched into hyperspace while within its star&#x27;s gravity well. &quot;Ringworld&#x27;s Children&quot; reveals that there is life in hyperspace around gravity wells and that hyperspace predators eat spaceships which appear in hyperspace close to large masses, thus explaining why a structure as large as the Ringworld can safely engage the hyperdrive in a star&#x27;s gravity well.

One phenomenon travelers in hyperspace can experience is the so-called &#x27;blind spot&#x27; should they look through a porthole or camera screen, giving the impression that the walls around the porthole or sides of the camera view screen are expanding to &#x27;cover up the outside&#x27;. The phenomenon is the result of hyperspace being so fundamentally different from normal/&#x27;Einsteinian&#x27; space that a traveler&#x27;s senses cannot truly comprehend it, and instead the observer &#x27;sees&#x27; a form of nothingness that can be hypnotic and dangerous. Staring too long into the &#x27;blind spot&#x27; can be insanity-inducing, so as a precaution all view ports on ships are blinded when a ship enters hyperspace.

===Invulnerable hulls===
The Puppeteer firm, General Products, produces a series of invulnerable starship hulls, known simply as the General Products hull. The hulls are impervious to any type of matter or energy, with the exception of antimatter (which destroys the hull, as demonstrated in &quot;Flatlander&quot;), gravitation (demonstrated in &quot;Neutron Star&quot;), and visible light (which passes through the hull). While invulnerable themselves, this is no guarantee that the contents are likewise protected. For example, though a high speed impact with the surface of a planet or star may cause no harm to the hull, the occupants will be crushed if they are not protected by additional measures such as a stasis field (&quot;Ringworld&quot;) or a gravity compensating field.

In &quot;Fleet of Worlds&quot;, the characters tour a General Products factory and receive clues that allow them to destroy a General Products hull from the inside using only a high-powered interstellar communications laser. In &quot;Juggler of Worlds&quot;, the Puppeteers, attempting to surmise how this was done without antimatter, identify another technique which can be used to destroy the otherwise invulnerable hulls, one which does suggest some potential defense options.

The strength of the hulls was revealed to be based on the fact that they were essentially one giant molecule.

===Organ transplantation===
On Earth in the mid-21st century, it became possible to transplant any organ from any person to another, with the exception of brain and central nervous system tissue. Individuals were categorized according to their so-called &quot;rejection spectrum&quot; which allowed doctors to counter any immune system responses to the new organs, allowing transplants to &quot;take&quot; for life. It also enabled the crime of &quot;organlegging&quot; which lasted well into the 24th century.

===Stasis fields===
A Slaver stasis field creates a bubble of spacetime disconnected from the entropy gradient of the rest of the universe. Time slows effectively to a stop for an object in stasis, at a ratio of some billions of years outside to a second inside. An object in stasis is invulnerable to anything occurring outside the field, as well as being preserved indefinitely. A stasis field may be recognized by its perfectly reflecting surface, so perfect that it reflects 100% of all radiation and particles, including neutrinos. However one stasis field cannot exist inside another. This is used in &quot;World of Ptavvs&quot; where humans develop a stasis field technology and realize that a mirrored artifact known as the &quot;Sea Statue&quot; must be actually an alien in a stasis field. They place it with a human envoy, who is a telepath, and envelop both in field. By doing this, they unleash the last living member of the Slaver species on the world.

===Stepping disks===
Stepping disks are a teleportation technology. They were invented by the Pierson&#x27;s Puppeteers, and their existence is not generally known to other races until the events of &quot;The Ringworld Engineers&quot;.

The stepping disks are an outgrowth and improvement of the transfer booth technology used by humans and other Known Space races. Unlike the booths, the disks do not require an enclosed chamber, and somehow can differentiate between solid masses and air, for example. They also have a far greater range than transfer booths, extending several astronomical units.

Several limitations to stepping disks are mentioned in the &quot;Ringworld&quot; novels. If there is a difference in velocity between two disks, any matter transferred between them must be accelerated by the disk accordingly. If there is not enough energy to do so, the transfer cannot take place. This becomes a problem with disks that are a significant distance apart on the Ringworld&#x27;s surface, as they will have different velocities: same speed, different direction.

===Transfer booths===
Transfer booths or displacement booths are an inexpensive form of teleportation. Short-range booths are similar in appearance to an old style telephone booth: one enters, &quot;dials&quot; one&#x27;s desired destination, and is immediately deposited in a corresponding booth at the destination. Longer-range booths operate similarly, but are housed in former airports due to requiring &quot;equipment to compensate for the difference in rotational velocity between different points on the Earth&quot;. They are inexpensive: a trip anywhere on Earth costs only a &quot;tenth-star&quot; (presumably equivalent to a dime). Introduced by one of Gregory Pelton&#x27;s ancestors, apparently bought from, and based on, Puppeteer technology.

&quot;A displacement booth was a glass cylinder with a rounded top. The machinery that made the magic work was invisible, buried beneath the booth. Coin slots and a telephone dial were set into the glass at sternum level&quot; (from &quot;Flash Crowd&quot;).

===Paranormal abilities===
Some individuals in the stories display limited paranormal or &quot;psionic&quot; abilities. Gil Hamilton can move objects with his mind using his phantom arm, which he gained after losing an arm in an asteroid mining accident. When he finally had the arm replaced from an organ bank on Earth, the ability persisted. &quot;Plateau Eyes&quot; (introduced in &quot;A Gift From Earth&quot;) is an ability on the part of some to hide in plain sight, by causing others not to notice them. Population control is tight on Earth, but these abilities can gain the possessor a license to have more children. The Pierson&#x27;s Puppeteers engineer a lottery for child licenses on Earth to increase the occurrence of &quot;luck&quot;, which they think is a paranormal ability humans have that has enabled them to defeat races such as the Kzinti. In &quot;Ringworld&quot;, the character Teela Brown is said to have this ability (although possibly not to the same extent as others who avoided being included in the expedition).

==Organizations== 
The ARM is the police force of the United Nations. ARM originated as an acronym for &quot;Amalgamation of Regional Militia&quot;, though this is not a term in current usage by the time of the &quot;Known Space&quot; novels. An agent of the ARM, Gil Hamilton, is the protagonist of Niven&#x27;s science fictional detective stories, a series-within-a-series gathered in the collection &quot;Flatlander&quot;. (Confusingly, &quot;Flatlander&quot; is also the name of an unrelated &quot;Known Space&quot; story.)

Their basic function is to enforce mandatory birth control on overcrowded Earth, and restrict research which might lead to dangerous weapons. In short, the ARM hunts down women who have illegal pregnancies and suppresses all new technologies. They also hunt organleggers, especially in the era of the &quot;organ bank problem&quot;. Among the many technologies they control and outlaw are all trained forms of armed and unarmed combat. By the 25th century, ARM agents were kept in an artificially induced state of paranoid schizophrenia to enhance their usefulness as law enforcement officials, which led to them sometimes being referred to as &quot;Schizes&quot;. Agents with natural tendencies toward paranoia were medicated into docility during their off duty hours, through the aforementioned science of psychistry (see &quot;Madness Has Its Place&quot; and &quot;Juggler of Worlds&quot;).

Their jurisdiction is limited to the Earth-Moon system; other human colonies have their own militia. Nevertheless, in many &quot;Known Space&quot; stories, ARM agents operate or exert influence in other human star systems through the &quot;Bureau of Alien Affairs&quot; (see &quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot;, &quot;Procrustes&quot;, &quot;The Borderland of Sol&quot;, and &quot;Neutron Star&quot;). These interventions begin following the Man-Kzin Wars and the introduction of hyperdrive, presumably as part of a general re-integration of human societies.

== Stories in Known Space ==
The Tales of Known Space were first published primarily as short stories or serials in science fiction magazines. Generally the short fiction was subsequently released in one or more collections and the serial novels as books. Some of the shorter novels (novellas) published in magazines were expanded as, or incorporated in, book-length novels. There are also two or three short stories which share common themes and some background elements with Known Space stories, but which are not considered a part of the Known Space universe: &quot;One Face&quot; (1965) and &quot;Bordered in Black&quot; (1966)—both in the 1979 collection &quot;Convergent Series&quot;—and possibly &quot;The Color of Sunfire&quot;, published online and listed here.

In the Known Space stories, Niven had created a number of technological devices (GP hull, stasis field, Ringworld material) which, combined with the &quot;Teela Brown gene&quot;, made it very difficult to construct engaging stories beyond a certain date—the combination of factors made it tricky to produce any kind of creditable threat/problem without complex contrivances. Niven demonstrated this, to his own satisfaction, with &quot;Safe at Any Speed&quot; (1967). He used the setting for much less short fiction after 1968 and much less for novels after two published in 1980. Late in that decade, Niven invited other authors to participate in a series of shared-universe novels, with the Man–Kzin Wars as their setting. The first volume was published in 1988.

&quot;Ringworld&quot; (1970) won the annual Nebula, Hugo, and Locus best novel awards.
&quot;Protector&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Ringworld Engineers&quot; (1980) were nominated for the Hugo and Locus Awards.

===Man-Kzin Wars===
==Playground==
Niven has described his fiction as &quot;playground equipment&quot;, encouraging fans to speculate and extrapolate on the events described. Debates have been made, for example, on who built the Ringworld (Pak Protectors and the Outsiders being the traditional favorites, but see &quot;Ringworld&#x27;s Children&quot; for a possibly definitive answer), and what happened to the Tnuctipun. Niven also states that this is not an invitation to violate his copyrights, warning potential publishers and editors not to proceed without permission.

Niven was also reported to have said that &quot;Known Space should be seen as a possible future history told by people that may or may not have all their facts right.&quot;

The author also published an &quot;outline&quot; for a story which would &quot;destroy&quot; the Known Space Series (or more precisely, reveal much of the Known Space background to be an in-universe hoax), in an article entitled &quot;Down in Flames&quot; . Although the article is written as though Niven intended to write the story, he later wrote that the article was only an elaborate joke, and he never intended to write such a novel. The article itself notes that the outline was made obsolete by the publication of &quot;Ringworld&quot;. &quot;Down in Flames&quot; was a result of a conversation between Norman Spinrad and Niven in 1968, but at the time of its first publication in 1977 some of the concepts were invalidated by Niven&#x27;s writings between 1968 and 1977. (A further edited version of the outline was published in &quot;N-Space&quot; in 1990.)

<text>LeRoy Wilton Homer Jr. (August 27, 1965 – September 11, 2001) was the First Officer of United Airlines Flight 93, which was hijacked as part of the September 11 attacks in 2001, and crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing all 37 passengers and seven crewmembers, including LeRoy.

==Early life==

Homer, son of a West German woman and an American soldier who was stationed in West Germany, grew up on Long Island in New York. He was one of nine children, and seven of his siblings were girls. As a child, he assembled model airplanes, collected aviation memorabilia and read books on aviation. Whenever the family held events where men weren&#x27;t invited, his father would take him to McArthur Airport where they would watch the planes takeoff and land. He was 15 years old when he started flight instruction in a Cessna 152. Working part-time jobs after school to pay for flying lessons, he completed his first solo trip at the age of 16 and obtained his private pilot&#x27;s certificate in 1983. Homer graduated from Ss. Cyril and Methodius School in 1979 and St. John the Baptist Diocesan High School in 1983.

==Career and personal life==
He entered the United States Air Force Academy as a member of the class of 1987. As an upperclassman, he was a member of Cadet Squadron 31. He graduated on May 27, 1987, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force.

After completing his USAF pilot training in 1988, he was assigned to McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey, flying a Lockheed C-141 Starlifter. While on active duty, he served in the Gulf War and later supported operations in Somalia. He received many commendations, awards and medals during his military career. In 1993, he was named the Twenty-First Air Force &quot;Aircrew Instructor of the Year&quot;. Homer achieved the rank of captain before his honorable discharge from active duty in 1995 and his acceptance of a reserve commission in order to continue his career as an Air Force officer.

Homer continued his military career as a member of the U.S. Air Force Reserve, initially as a C-141 instructor pilot with the 356th Airlift Squadron at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, then subsequently as an Academy Liaison Officer, recruiting potential candidates for both the Air Force Academy and the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps. During his time in the Air Force Reserve, he achieved the rank of major.

Homer continued his flying career by joining United Airlines in May 1995. He briefly worked as a flight engineer, before becoming a First Officer on the Boeing 757/Boeing 767 in 1996, where he remained until his death.

Homer married his wife, Melodie, on May 24, 1998, and his daughter, Laurel, was born in late November 2000. They resided together in Marlton, New Jersey.

==September 11 attacks==
On September 11, 2001, Homer was flying with Captain Jason M. Dahl on United Airlines Flight 93 from Newark, New Jersey, to San Francisco. The plane was hijacked by four al-Qaeda terrorists, as they carried out the September 11 attacks. Homer and Dahl struggled with the hijackers, which was transmitted to Air Traffic Control.

After learning of the earlier crashes at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the crew and passengers attempted to foil the hijacking and reclaim the aircraft. Given the uprising of crew and passengers, and knowing they would not make it to their intended target, which was the US Capitol, the hijackers instead chose to crash the plane into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

Homer received many awards and citations posthumously, including honorary membership in the historic Tuskegee Airmen; the Congress of Racial Equality&#x27;s Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Award; the Southern Christian Leadership Conference Drum Major for Justice Award; and the Westchester County Trailblazer Award.

He was survived by his wife, Melodie, and his only child, daughter Laurel. Other family members include his mother, seven sisters, and his brother. His widow Melodie Homer established the LeRoy W. Homer Jr. Foundation, which awards scholarships related to aviation.

At the National 9/11 Memorial, Homer Jr. is memorialized at the South Pool, on Panel S-67, along with other crew and passengers on Flight 93.

On May 7, 2021, United States Air Force Academy&#x27;s graduating class of 2024 named Homer Jr as the class Exemplar, an honor that academy&#x27;s graduating class has bestowed every year since 2000 upon the individual who &quot;exemplifies&quot; the type of person the cadets wish to emulate.

<text>La Jetée () is a 1962 French science fiction featurette directed by Chris Marker and associated with the Left Bank artistic movement. Constructed almost entirely from still photos, it tells the stable time loop story of a post-nuclear war experiment in time travel. It is 28 minutes long and shot in black and white.

It won the Prix Jean Vigo for short film. The 1995 science fiction film &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; was inspired by and borrows several concepts directly from &quot;La Jetée&quot;, as does the 2015 TV series of the same name.

==Plot ==
A man is a prisoner in the aftermath of World War III in post-apocalyptic Paris, where survivors live underground in the &quot;Palais de Chaillot&quot; galleries. Scientists research time travel, hoping to send test subjects to different time periods &quot;to call past and future to the rescue of the present.&quot; They have difficulty finding subjects who can mentally withstand the shock of time travel. The scientists eventually settle upon the protagonist; his key to the past is a vague but obsessive memory from his pre-war childhood of a woman he had seen on the observation platform (&quot;the jetty&quot;) at Orly Airport shortly before witnessing a startling incident there. He did not understand exactly what happened, but knew he had seen a man die.

After several attempts, he reaches the pre-war period. He meets the woman from his memory, and they develop a romantic relationship. After his successful passages to the past, the experimenters attempt to send him into the far future. In a brief meeting with the technologically advanced people of the future, he is given a power unit sufficient to regenerate his own destroyed society.

Upon his return, with his mission accomplished, he discerns that he is to be executed by his jailers. He is contacted by the people of the future, who offer to help him escape to their time permanently; but he asks instead to be returned to the pre-war time of his childhood, hoping to find the woman again. He is returned to the past, placed on the jetty at the airport, and it occurs to him that the child version of himself is probably also there at the same time. He is more concerned with locating the woman, and quickly spots her. However, as he rushes to her, he notices an agent of his jailers who has followed him and realizes the agent is about to kill him. In his final moments, he comes to understand that the incident he witnessed as a child, which has haunted him ever since, was his own death.

==Cast==
* Jean Négroni as Narrator
* Hélène Châtelain as The Woman
* Davos Hanich as The Man
* Jacques Ledoux as The Experimenter
* Ligia Branice as Woman From The Future
* Janine Kleina as Woman From The Future
* William Klein as Man From The Future

==Production==
&quot;La Jetée&quot; is constructed almost entirely from optically printed photographs playing out as a photomontage of varying rhythm. It contains only one brief shot (of the woman mentioned above sleeping and suddenly waking up) originating on a motion-picture camera, this due to the fact that Marker could only afford to hire one for an afternoon. The stills were taken with a Pentax Spotmatic and the motion-picture segment was shot with a 35 mm Arriflex. The film has no dialogue aside from small sections of muttering in German and people talking in an airport terminal. The story is told by a voice-over narrator. The scene in which the hero and the woman look at a cut-away trunk of a tree is a reference to Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1958 film &quot;Vertigo&quot; which Marker also references in his 1983 film &quot;Sans soleil&quot;.

The editing of &quot;La Jetée&quot; adds to the intensity of the film. With the use of cut-ins and fade-outs, it produces the eerie and unsettling nature adding to the theme of the apocalyptic destruction of World War III. Terry Gilliam, director of &quot;12 Monkeys&quot;, describes the editing as &quot;simply poetic&quot; in the combination of editing and soundtrack that is used in the short film.

As the film plays out as a photomontage, the only continuous variable is the sound. The sound used in this production is minimal, showing up in the form of narration, orchestral score and sound effect. The rhythmic patterns of the soundtrack act as a framework to add to the intensity of the film. &quot;The dissolve is synchronized with the sound. As the story moves from the past to the present, &quot;La Jetee&quot; creates mental continuity.&quot; The soundtrack adds to the illusion of movement within the film and the change of time.

==Interpretation==
In &quot;Black and Blue&quot;, her study of postwar French fiction, Carol Mavor describes &quot;La Jetée&quot; as &quot;taking place in a no-place (u-topia) in no-time (u-chronia)&quot; which she connects to the time and place of the fairy tale. She further elaborates: &quot;even the sound of the title resonates with the fairy-tale surprise of finding oneself in another world: &quot;La Jetée&quot; evokes &#x27;là j&#x27;étais&#x27; (there I was)&quot;. By &quot;u-topia&quot;, Mavor does not refer to &quot;utopia&quot; as the word is commonly used; she also describes an ambiguity of dystopia/utopia in the film: &quot;It is dystopia with the hope of utopia, or is it utopia cut by the threat of dystopia.&quot;

Tor Books blogger Jake Hinkson summed up his interpretation in the title of an essay about the film, &quot;There&#x27;s No Escape Out of Time&quot;. He elaborated:

Hinkson also addresses the symbolic use of imagery: &quot;The Man is blindfolded with some kind of padded device and he sees images. The Man is chosen for this assignment because ... he has maintained a sharp mind because of his attachment to certain images. Thus a film told through the use of still photos becomes about looking at images.&quot; He further observes that Marker himself did not refer to &quot;La Jetée&quot; as a film, but as photo novel.

Yannis Karpouzis makes a structuralistic analysis on &quot;La Jetée&quot;, examining it as an intermedial artwork: Chris Marker creates an &quot;archive&quot; of objects and conditions that have a photographic quality of their own and they are followed by the same predicates as pictures. The dialogue between the media (photography and cinematography) and the filmic signifier (film stills, storyline and narration) is constantly in the backdrop.

==Reception and legacy==

=== Release, awards, and recognition ===
In 1963, Prix Jean Vigo awarded &quot;La Jetée&quot; for &quot;Best Short Film&quot;. That same year, &quot;La Jetée&quot; was included in the Locarno International Film Festival, the Trieste Science+Fiction Festival, and the Mannheim-Heidelberg International Film Festival. The film has since been included in several contemporary film festivals, including the Buenos Aires Festival Internacional de Cine Independiente in 2009, the &quot;Cine//B Film Festival&quot; in 2011, and the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam in 2019.

&quot;La Jetée&quot; was included by producer Steven Schneider in the 2003 film reference book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;. In 2010, &quot;Time&quot; ranked &quot;La Jetée&quot; first in its list of &quot;Top 10 time-travel movies&quot;. In 2012, in correspondence with the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll, the British Film Institute deemed &quot;La Jetée&quot; as the 50th greatest film of all time. In 2022, it took the spot of 67th greatest film on the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll, and 35th greatest film on the director&#x27;s poll, respectively.

=== In popular culture ===
Science fiction writer William Gibson considers the film one of his main influences.

On November 8, 2022 the Chicago Fringe Opera staged a world-premiere concert performance of Seth Boustead and J. Robert Lennon&#x27;s chamber opera adaptation of the film.

==== Music ====
The video for Sigue Sigue Sputnik&#x27;s 1989 single &quot;Dancerama&quot; is an homage to &quot;La Jetée&quot;. The film is also one of the influences in the video for David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Jump They Say&quot; (1993).

The Chicago-based band Isotope 217 recorded the track &quot;La Jetée&quot; for their 1997 album&quot;The Unstable Molecule&quot;. On the 1998 album &quot;TNT&quot;, the post-rock band Tortoise, of which Isotope 217 is a side-project, featured an alternate version of the same song, titled &quot;Jetty&quot;. Both are inspired by the film.

Kode9, in collaboration with Ms. Haptic, Marcel Weber (aka MFO), and Lucy Benson created an homage to &quot;La Jetée&quot; in 2011, for the Unsound Festival.

Northern Irish rock band Two Door Cinema Club screened the film at the launch party for their 2016 album &quot;Gameshow&quot;. The final track on the album, &quot;Je viens de la&quot;, is inspired by &quot;La Jetée&quot; and describes the journey of the film&#x27;s protagonist.

==== Film ====
Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; (1995) was inspired by and takes several concepts directly from &quot;La Jetée&quot; (acknowledging this debt in the opening credits). The 2003 short film &quot;La puppé&quot; is both an homage to and a parody of &quot;La Jetée&quot;.

The 2007 Mexican film &quot;Year of the Nail&quot;, which is told entirely through still photographs, was inspired by &quot;La Jetée&quot;. The 2018 Spanish film &quot;Entre Oscuros Sueños&quot;, where the still-image movie concept is also used, was entirely inspired by &quot;La Jetée&quot;. &quot;Friend of the World&quot;, a two-hander film, was inspired by &quot;La Jetée,&quot; among others.

==== Games ====
Leonard Boyarsky, the art director of the initial installment of the Fallout series, was influenced by the look of the technology in &quot;La Jetée.&quot;

==Related media==
In 1992, Zone Books released a book which reproduced the film&#x27;s original images along with the script in both English and French.

==Home media==
In Region 2, the film is available with English subtitles in the &quot;La Jetée/Sans soleil&quot; digipack released by Arte Video. In Region 1, the Criterion Collection has released a &quot;La Jetée/Sans soleil&quot; combination DVD / Blu-ray, which features the option of hearing the English or French narration.

<text>The little penguin (Eudyptula minor) is the smallest species of penguin. It originates from New Zealand. It is commonly known as the fairy penguin, little blue penguin, or blue penguin, owing to its slate-blue plumage and is also known by its Māori name . It is a marine neritic species that dives for food throughout the day and returns to burrows on the shore at dusk, making it the only nocturnal penguin species on land.
The Australian little penguin (&quot;Eudyptula novaehollandiae&quot;), from Australia and the Otago region of New Zealand, is considered a separate species.

&quot;Eudyptula minor&quot; feathers are dense in melanosomes, which increase water resistance and give them their unique blue colour.

==Taxonomy==

The little penguin was first described by German naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster in 1781. Several subspecies are known, but a precise classification of these is still a matter of dispute. The holotypes of the subspecies &quot;E. m. variabilis&quot; and &quot;Eudyptula minor chathamensis&quot; are in the collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. The white-flippered penguin (&quot;E. m. albosignata&quot; or &quot;E. m. minor morpha albosignata&quot;) is currently considered by most taxonomists to be a colour morph or subspecies of &quot;Eudyptula minor.&quot; In 2008, Shirihai treated the little penguin and white-flippered penguin as allospecies. However, as of 2012, the IUCN and BirdLife International consider the white-flippered penguin to be a subspecies or morph of the little penguin.

Little penguins from New Zealand and Australia were once considered to be the same species, called &quot;Eudyptula minor&quot;. Analysis of mtDNA in 2002 revealed two clades in &quot;Eudyptula&quot;: one containing little penguins of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island, Cook Strait and Chatham Island, as well as the white-flippered penguin, and a second containing little penguins of Australia and the Otago region of New Zealand. Preliminary analysis of braying calls and cluster analysis of morphometrics partially supported these results. A 2016 study described the Australian little penguin as a new and separate species, &quot;Eudyptula novaehollandiae&quot;. &quot;E. minor&quot; is endemic to New Zealand, while &quot;E. novaehollandiae&quot; is found in Australia and Otago. A 2019 study supported the recognition of &quot;E. minor&quot; and &quot;E. novaehollandiae&quot; as separate species.
The IUCN assessment for &quot;Eudyptula minor&quot; uses &quot;Eudyptula minor&quot; and &quot;Eudyptula novaehollandiae&quot; interchangeably throughout the report to specify location, but considers them as two genetically distinct clades within the same species.

==Description==

Like those of all penguins, the wings of &quot;Eudyptula&quot; species have developed into flippers used for swimming.

&quot;Eudyptula&quot; species typically grow to between tall and on average weigh 1.5 kg (3.3 lb). The head and upper parts are blue in colour, with slate-grey ear coverts fading to white underneath, from the chin to the belly. Their flippers are blue in colour. The dark grey-black beak is 3–4 cm long, the irises pale silvery- or bluish-grey or hazel, and the feet pink above with black soles and webbing. An immature individual will have a shorter bill and lighter upperparts.

Like most seabirds, the &quot;Eudyptula&quot; species have a long lifespan. The average for the species is 6.5 years, but flipper ringing experiments show that in very exceptional cases they may live up to 25 years in captivity.

&quot;Eudyptula minor&quot; does not have the distinct bright blue feathers that distinguish &quot;Eudyptula novaehollandiae.&quot; In addition, the vocalisation patterns of the New Zealand lineage located on Tiritiri Matangi Island vary from the Australian lineage located in Oamaru. Females are known to prefer the local call of the New Zealand lineage.

There are also behavioural differences that help differentiate these penguins. Those of the Australian lineage will swim together in a large group after dusk and walk along the shore to reach their nesting sites. This may be an effective predator avoidance strategy by traveling in a large group simultaneously. This has not been seen by those of the New Zealand lineage. &quot;Eudyptula&quot; &quot;minor&quot; only recently encountered terrestrial vertebrate predators, while &quot;Eudyptula novaehollandiae&quot; would have had to deal with carnivorous marsupials.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Eudyptula minor&quot; breeds along most of the coastline of New Zealand, including the Chatham Islands. The chicks are raised in nests constructed in burrows along the shoreline, both dug by &quot;Eudyptula minor&quot; and by other animals. &quot;Eudyptula minor&quot; does not occur in Otago, which is located on the east coast of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. The Australian species &quot;Eudyptula novaehollandiae&quot; occurs in Otago. &quot;E. novaehollandiae&quot; was originally endemic to Australia. Using ancient-DNA analysis and radiocarbon dating using historical, pre-human, as well as archaeological &quot;Eudyptula&quot; remains, the arrival of the Australian species in New Zealand was determined to have occurred roughly between AD 1500 and 1900. When the &quot;E. minor&quot; population declined in New Zealand, it left a genetic opening for &quot;E. novaehollandiae&quot;. The decrease of &quot;E. minor&quot; was most likely due to anthropogenic effects, such as being hunted by humans as well as introduced predators, including dogs brought from overseas.

It has been determined using multilocus coalescent analyses that the population of &quot;Eudyptula novaehollandiae&quot; in Otago arrived less than 750 years ago, more recently than previously estimated.

Outside of the Otago region, all colonies are expected to belong to the subspecies &quot;Eudyptula novaehollandiae&quot; Many of these colonies are smaller and more patchily distributed than larger &quot;Eudyptula minor&quot; colonies that exist in Australia and Otago. Extensive research exists on Philip Island and Oamaru colonies as they are sites of large colonies which attract large groups of tourists 
Population size and trends of colonies in New Zealand remain poorly documented, what is known is colonies in New Zealand commonly consist of smaller fragmented groups in comparison to Australias larger colonies, some with &lt;10 breeding pairs, this is largely attributed to NZs fragmented coastline separating the larger colonies. This is commonly seen in Kaikōura where 6–7 smaller colonies have been found along 1.7% of coastline 

== Behaviour ==

=== Feeding ===
Little penguins are central place foragers, meaning they will travel distances to forage but always return to the same nest or colony. They are also a species where both parents are required to raise chicks, and alternate foraging trips while the other is guarding and incubating the nest during the post guard stage. These stints can last anywhere between 1–10 days during incubation. Despite nesting on the shore, little penguins forage at sea and feed on a diet ranging from small schooling fish, to cephalopods, krill, and microzooplankton. As the species is widely distributed across a range of habitats in New Zealand and Australia, variation in diet and foraging choice has also arisen. Important little penguin prey items include arrow squid, slender sprat, Graham&#x27;s gudgeon, red cod, and ahuru. 
Little penguins feed by hunting small clupeoid fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans, for which they travel and dive quite extensively, including to the sea floor. Foraging efficiency has been found to be significantly influenced by age. Foraging success appears to stabilise selection for middle-aged penguins, as feeding is a learnt behaviour but also requires good physical condition.

For the Philip Island and other southern Australian colonies, Australian anchovies are the primary food source. Although the diet of the Philip Island colony has diversified to include selections of cephalopods and krill during the post guard stage of their life cycle where greater amounts of energy is required for chick development and egg production, resident penguins predominantly rely on anchovies when more energy is required.

The nature of their diet also impacts foraging methods, which may vary by colony depending on what food is available. When prey is larger and individuals are only catching 1-2 items at a time, they are more likely to hunt alone to reduce competition, whereas smaller and more mobile prey, or schooling prey species, promote group hunting to enable efficient encirclement. The Oamaru colony predominantly feeds on smaller schooling species such as sprat and gudgeon, while penguins from the Stewart/Codfish Island colonies more often hunt alone. The latter is likely linked to a predominantly cephalopods diet (58% of prey items at &lt; 10 gm each).

===Prey availability===
Rising ocean temperatures have seen a trend towards earlier onset of breeding in &quot; Eudyptula minor&quot; which does not always align with the availability of their prey. This is because higher sea surface temperatures are associated with early onset of nesting, but also associated with lower nutrients and oxygen availability. During the breeding season, parents are restricted to a short foraging area close to their nest and are therefore vulnerable to small regional changes. La Niña events increasing the sea surface temperature along the New Zealand coastline cause prey such as schooling fish and krill to either become more regionally scarce or migrate to new habitats. Graham&#x27;s Gudgeon once dominated the diet of the Oamaru colony of &quot;Eudyptula minor&quot;, however in 1995 the availability of the species dropped from 20% in December to 0% in January the following year. Penguins were able to successfully adapt their diet to consist of slender sprat and pigfish.

===Double brooding===
If penguins produce a second clutch of eggs in a season once the first chicks have fledged, this is known as double brooding. Thus far this behaviour has only been observed in the &quot;Eudyptula novaehollandiae&quot;, the lineage of little blue penguins which inhabit Australian and Otago regions. There is no evidence to suggest this is an established behaviour within &quot;Eudyptula minor&quot;, however double broods are occasionally noticed among the colonies in the Kaikoura coastline. It is as yet unclear whether this means double brooding is a genetically mediated behaviour. A study carried out on Oamaru penguin colony found double broods to increase breeding success by up to 75% per season. Double brooding is more likely to occur in individuals who lay their first clutch, prior to mid-September. While there is some interannual variability, the most common period for little penguins to lay their first clutch is in spring, mid-September is considered early and gives individuals time left in the season to lay a second clutch of eggs after the first have fledged.

The onset of double brooding can be strongly influenced by sea surface temperature, age and food availability. Warmer sea surface temperature in summer and autumn correlated with earlier laying of first clutch of eggs increasing the chances of double brooding. In contrast, in New Zealand it was observed that during the La Niña phase of the El Niño Southern Oscillation when colder temperature water was brought to the surface, there was a delay in the onset of breeding for &quot;Eudyptula novaehollandiae&quot;, thus resulting in a lower incidence of double brooding in the Otago colonies. Age is also believed to be a factor affecting double brooding because the pairs successfully able to double brood were most commonly strategic in reclaiming successful nests and pair-bonds. Little penguins show a high nest fidelity, and the ability to reclaim success early suggests it is likely that successful double brooding is a behaviour that improves with age. Another influencing factor is the availability of food, for larger colonies such as the Philip Islands, competition for food can increase significantly during the breeding season, particularly if there is variability in the amount of prey available. If this competition results in aggression between adults, this can also influence ability to successfully raise chicks, and successfully breed in the next season. 

===Foraging behaviour===

During the breeding season, &quot;Eudyptula minor&quot; are central place foragers. They travel within their home range to find food, but will return to their nest to feed both themselves and their chicks. Their foraging range is limited by how long chicks can fast, and the high energetic of costs of constant travelling for individuals. This behaviour results in a small foraging range, and therefore a higher probability of competition when prey availability is more scarce. Particularly , In order to survive &quot;Eudyptula minor&quot; adapt to these constraints by increasing the plasticity and variability in their foraging behaviour, such as spatial, age, or diet based segregation, during breeding season when energy demands for both parents and chicks are at their highest. During chick rearing, parents will make on average one day long foraging trips within a 30 km radius of their nest.

Research conducted on the Philip Island colony found the spatial segregation of foraging behaviour was primarily determined by age rather than biological sex. Middle aged individuals foraged at greater distances from their nests and were able to dive greater distances, whereas older penguins were found to forage closer to the shore than middle aged adults.

When foraging in groups for small schooling prey, they were also observed to all be of a similar age cohort. If the groups are segregated by age, this is likely because they are at the same foraging ability and occupy the same approximate range.

== Threats ==
=== Introduced predators ===
Introduced mammalian predators present the greatest terrestrial risk to little penguins and include cats, dogs, rats, and particularly ferrets and stoats. Significant dog attacks have been recorded at the colony at Little Kaiteriteri Beach, and a suspected stoat or ferret attack at Doctor&#x27;s Point near Dunedin, New Zealand, claimed the lives of 29 little blue penguins in November 2014.

=== Oil spills ===
Little penguin populations were significantly affected by a major oil spill with the grounding of the &quot;Rena&quot; off New Zealand in 2011, which killed 2,000 seabirds (including little penguins) directly, and killed an estimated 20,000 in total based on wider ecosystem impacts. Oil spills are the most common cause of the little penguins being admitted to the rehabilitation facilities at Phillip Island Nature Park (PINP). These oil spill recurrences have endangered not just the little penguins, but the entire penguin population. This can further decline the population, which can lead to possible extinction.

===Fire===
Increased frequency of drought and extreme temperatures in Southern Australia has led to an increased fire risk. Being flightless birds that nest on land, little blue penguins are especially vulnerable to fire. Behavioural traits such as reluctancy to abandon nests and emerging mostly during daylit hours is thought to be some of the main reasons for increased vulnerability in the future. The threats it provides include nest and habitat distruption, as well as deadly to eggs and individuals, despite this &quot;Eudyptula minor&quot;appears to show no fear towards fire when directly exposed. When observed, they have been to found to remain around or under vegetation until severely burnt or injured. Some have even been observed preening their feathers near to open flames.

Fires can also significantly alter the composition of vegetation in Eudyptula minor habitats. A large fire in Marion Bay, South Australia in 1994 saw the loss of two key plant species; introduced marram grass &quot;Ammophila&quot; and coastal wattle &quot;A.sophorae&quot;. Following the fire, these grasses were replaced by invasive palms &quot;A.arenia&quot; and &quot;A.sophorae&quot;grew back in dense thickets. This habitat became no longer suitable for &quot;Eudyptula minor&quot; and colony relocated.

== Conservation ==
&quot;Eudyptula&quot; species are classified as &quot;at risk - declining&quot; under New Zealand&#x27;s Wildlife Act 1953.
Overall, little penguin populations in New Zealand have been decreasing. Some colonies have become extinct, and others continue to be at risk. Some new colonies have been established in urban areas. The species is not considered endangered in New Zealand, with the exception of the white-flippered subspecies found only on Banks Peninsula and nearby Motunau Island. Since the 1960s, the mainland population has declined by 60-70%; though a small increase has occurred on Motunau Island. A colony exists in Wellington Harbour on Matiu / Somes Island.

Protestors have opposed the development of a marina at Kennedy Point, Waiheke Island in New Zealand for the risk it poses to little penguins and their habitat. Protesters claimed that they exhausted all legal means to oppose the project and have had to resort to occupation and non-violent resistance. Several arrests were made for trespassing. Construction of the marina was upheld by the Environment Court in 2012 and completed in 2022. Since the completion of the construction, little penguin burrows have still been found in the area, as well as one dead little penguin on the boat ramp there.

The West Coast Penguin Trust and DOC have worked in collaboration to maintain data on penguin mortality, the West Coast South Island colonies are highlighted as one of the &quot;Eudyptula minor&quot; colonies currently facing decline The data shows highest level of penguin mortality is caused by roadkill, likely due to many of the colonies being close to coastal highway. To mitigate this issue, a penguin-proof fence was erected in 2019 across 3.3 km of highway where road kill was most prevalent, no roadkill deaths have been recorded since its implementation 

The risk of fire damage to habitats in Philip Island has been partially mitigated through the planting of fire-resistant indigenous vegetation in and around the nesting sites. Thus far this planting has occurred primarily in the &lt;10% of the colony most visible from tourist look-out points 

In 1997 in NSW, the &quot;Eudyptula minor&quot; was listed as an endangered species under the endangered species act 1995. Since then conservation efforts such as public education, nest monitoring and labelling it as ‘critical habitat’ were implemented. Despite these efforts, this mainland colony was met with additional challenges from threats from wild dogs and foxes, to lack of available local prey. Species is now listed as at-risk declining under the same act 

== Zoological exhibits ==
Zoological exhibits featuring purpose-built enclosures for &quot;Eudyptula&quot; species can be seen in Australia at the Adelaide Zoo, Melbourne Zoo, the National Zoo &amp; Aquarium in Canberra, Perth Zoo, Caversham Wildlife Park (Perth), Ballarat Wildlife Park, Sea Life Sydney Aquarium, and the Taronga Zoo in Sydney. Enclosures include nesting boxes or similar structures for the animals to retire into, a reconstruction of a pool and in some cases, a transparent aquarium wall to allow patrons to view the animals underwater while they swim.

&quot;Eudyptula&quot; penguin exhibit exists at Sea World, on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. In early March 2007, 25 of the 37 penguins died from an unknown toxin following a change of gravel in their enclosure. It is still not known what caused the deaths of the penguins, and it was decided not to return the 12 surviving penguins to the same enclosure where the penguins became ill. A new enclosure for the little penguin colony was opened at Sea World in 2008.

In New Zealand, &quot;Eudyptula&quot; penguin exhibits exist at the Auckland Zoo, the Wellington Zoo, the International Antarctic Centre and the National Aquarium of New Zealand. Since 2017, the National Aquarium of New Zealand, has featured a monthly &quot;Penguin of the Month&quot; board, declaring two of their resident animals the &quot;Naughty&quot; and &quot;Nice&quot; penguin for that month. Photos of the board have gone viral and gained the aquarium a large worldwide social media following.

In the United States, &quot;Eudyptula&quot; penguins can be seen at the Louisville Zoo the Bronx Zoo, and the Cincinnati Zoo.

<text>Lake Balaton () is a freshwater rift lake in the Transdanubian region of Hungary. It is the largest lake in Central Europe, and one of the region&#x27;s foremost tourist destinations. The Zala River provides the largest inflow of water to the lake, and the canalized Sió is the only outflow.

The mountainous region of the northern shore is known both for its historic character and as a major wine region, while the flat southern shore is known for its resort towns. Balatonfüred and Hévíz developed early as resorts for the wealthy, but it was not until the late 19th century when landowners, ruined by &quot;Phylloxera&quot; attacking their grape vines, began building summer homes to rent out to the burgeoning middle class.

==Name==
In distinction to all other Hungarian endonyms for lakes, which universally bear the suffix &quot;-tó&quot; &#x27;lake&#x27;, Lake Balaton is referred to in Hungarian with a definite article; that is, &quot;a Balaton&quot; &#x27;the Balaton&#x27;. It was called &quot;lacus Pelsodis&quot; or &quot;Pelso&quot; by the Romans. The name is Indo-European in origin, derived from Slavic *&quot;bolto&quot; (Czech &quot;bláto&quot;, Slovak &quot;blato&quot;, Polish &quot;błoto&quot;), meaning &#x27;mud, swamp&#x27; (from earlier Proto-Slavic &quot;boltьno&quot;, cf. , ). 
In January 846, the Slavic prince Pribina began to build a fortress as his seat of power and several churches in the region of Lake Balaton, in the territory of modern Zalavár surrounded by forests and swamps along the Zala River. His well-fortified castle and capital of the Lower Pannonian Principality became known as &quot;Blatnohrad&quot; or &quot;Moosburg&quot; (literally, &#x27;Swamp Fortress&#x27;), and it served as a bulwark against both the Bulgarians and the Moravians.

The German name for the lake is &#x27;. It is unlikely it was given that name for being shallow because the adjective &#x27; is a Greek loanword that was borrowed via French and entered general German vocabulary in the 17th century. It is also noteworthy that the average depth of Balaton () is not extraordinary for the area (cf. the average depth of the neighbouring Neusiedler See, which is roughly ).

==Climate==
Lake Balaton affects precipitation in the local area. The area receives approximately more precipitation than most of Hungary, resulting in more cloudy days and less extreme temperatures. The lake freezes over during winters. The microclimate around Lake Balaton has also made the region ideal for viticulture. The Mediterranean-like climate, combined with the soil (containing volcanic rock), has made the region notable for its production of wines since the Roman period 2,000 years ago.

==History==

It always has been an important location, both tactically and culturally(with many folk tales surrounding it). During the Ottoman wars played an important role in defending Royal Hungary where even battles were fought. While a few settlements on Lake Balaton, including Balatonfüred and Hévíz, have long been resort centres for the Hungarian aristocracy, it was only in the late 19th century that the Hungarian middle class began to visit the lake. The construction of railways in 1861 and 1909 increased tourism substantially, but the post-war boom of the 1950s was much larger.

By the turn of the 20th century, Balaton had become a center of research by Hungarian biologists, geologists, hydrologists, and other scientists, leading to the country&#x27;s first biological research institute being built on its shore in 1927.

The last major German offensive of World War II, Operation Spring Awakening, was conducted in the region of Lake Balaton in March 1945, being referred to as &quot;the Lake Balaton Offensive&quot; in many British histories of the war. The battle was a German attack by Sepp Dietrich&#x27;s Sixth Panzer Army and the Hungarian Third Army between 6 and 16 March 1945, and in the end, resulted in a Red Army victory. Several Ilyushin Il-2 wrecks have been pulled out of the lake after having been shot down during the later months of the war.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Balaton became a major tourist destination due to focused government efforts, causing the number of overnight guests in local hotels and campsites to increase from 700,000 in July 1965 to two million in July 1975. The number of weekend visitors to the region, including tens of thousands from Budapest, reached more than 600,000 by 1975. It was visited by ordinary working Hungarians, and especially for subsidised holiday excursions by National Council of Trade Union () members to exclusive hotels and small resorts () for them.
It also attracted many East Germans and other residents of the Eastern Bloc. West Germans could also visit, making Balaton a common meeting place for families and friends separated by the Berlin Wall until 1989.

==Tourism==

The major resorts around the lake are Siófok, Keszthely, and Balatonfüred. Zamárdi, another resort town on the southern shore, has been the site of Balaton Sound, a notable electronic music festival since 2007. Balatonkenese has hosted numerous traditional gastronomic events. Siófok is known for attracting young people to it because of its large clubs. Keszthely is the site of the Festetics Palace and Balatonfüred is a historical bathing town which hosts the annual Anna Ball.

The peak tourist season extends from June until the end of August. The average water temperature during the summer is , which makes bathing and swimming popular on the lake. Most of the beaches consist of either grass, rocks, or the silty sand that also makes up most of the bottom of the lake. Many resorts have artificial sandy beaches and all beaches have step access to the water. Other tourist attractions include sailing, fishing, and other water sports, as well as visiting the countryside and hills, wineries on the north coast, and nightlife on the south shore. The Tihany Peninsula is a historical district. Badacsony is a volcanic mountain and wine-growing region as well as a lakeside resort. The lake is almost completely surrounded by separated bike lanes to facilitate bicycle tourism. Although the peak season at the lake is the summer, Balaton is also frequented during the winter, when visitors go ice-fishing or even skate, sledge, or ice-sail on the lake if it freezes over.

Sármellék International Airport provides air service to Balaton (although most service is only seasonal).

Other resort towns include Balatonalmádi, Balatonboglár, Balatonlelle, Fonyód, and Vonyarcvashegy.

=== Sport ===
The annual Lake Balaton Crossing swim takes place in July. The race starts at Révfülöp and finishes at Balatonboglár for a total distance of 5.2 kilometres.

<text>The &#x27; (Spanish: &quot;Book of games&quot;), or &#x27; (&quot;Book of chess, dice and tables&quot;, in Old Spanish), was a Spanish treatise of chess which synthesized the information from other Arabic works on this same topic, dice and tables (backgammon forebears) games, commissioned by Alfonso X of Castile, Galicia and León and completed in his scriptorium in Toledo in 1283. It contains the earliest European treatise on chess as well as being the oldest document on European tables games, and is an exemplary piece of the literary legacy of the Toledo School of Translators.

== Significance ==
The is one of the most important documents for researching the history of board games. This &quot;celebrated MS book of games&quot; has been described as &quot;one of the choicest treasures of the library of the Escorial&quot; as well as &quot;perhaps the greatest source of information on board games ever compiled during the Middle Ages.&quot; It is both &quot;the earliest treatise on chess and the oldest document relating to tables which have had their origin in Europe.&quot;

==Description ==
The book consists of ninety-seven leaves of parchment, many with color illustrations, and contains 150 miniatures. The text is a treatise that addresses the playing of three game types: a game of skill, or chess; games of chance, or dice; and a third game type, tables, which combines elements of both skill and chance. These games are discussed in the final section of the book at both an astronomical and astrological level. Examining further, the text can also be read as an allegorical initiation tale and as a metaphysical guide for leading a balanced, prudent, and virtuous life. In addition to the didactic, although not overly moralistic, aspect of the text, the manuscript&#x27;s illustrations reveal a rich cultural, social, and religious complexity.

== Location ==
The earliest manuscript is in the library of the monastery of El Escorial near Madrid in Spain, as manuscript T.I.6. It is bound in sheepskin and is 40 cm high and 28 cm wide (16 in × 11 in). A 1334 copy is held in the library of the Spanish Royal Academy of History in Madrid.

==Background==
Alfonso was likely influenced by his contact with scholars in the Arab world. Unlike many contemporary texts on the topic, he does not engage the games in the text with moralistic arguments; instead, he portrays them in an astrological context. He conceives of gaming as a dichotomy between the intellect and chance. The book is divided into three parts reflecting this: the first on chess (a game purely of abstract strategy), the second on dice (with outcomes controlled strictly by chance), and the last on tables (combining elements of both). The first section of the book also speaks of some other games of abstract strategy, notably alquerque and nine men&#x27;s morris, among others. The text may have been influenced by Frederick II&#x27;s text on falconry.

==Chess==
The contains an extensive collection of writings on chess, with over 100 chess problems and variants. Among its more notable entries is a depiction of what Alfonso calls the &quot;ajedrex de los quatro tiempos&quot; (&quot;chess of the four seasons&quot;). This game is a chess variant for four players, described as representing a conflict between the four elements and the four humors. The chessmen are marked correspondingly in green, red, black, and white, and pieces are moved according to the roll of dice. Alfonso also describes a game titled &quot;astronomical chess&quot;, played on a board of seven concentric circles, divided radially into twelve areas, each associated with a constellation of the Zodiac.

Another variant described in the book is the &quot;Grant Acedrex&quot;, played over a 12x12 board with alternative pieces as the giraffe and the unicornio.

==Tables==

The book describes the rules for a number of games in the tables family. One notable entry is &quot;todas tablas&quot;, the equivalent of the Anglo-Scottish game of Irish, which some scholars have argued has several similarities to modern backgammon including an identical starting position and the same rules for movement and bearing off, albeit the accompanying image has a different opening layout. Alfonso also describes a variant played on a board with seven points in each table. Players rolled seven-sided dice to determine the movement of pieces, an example of Alfonso&#x27;s preference for the number seven.
The tables games described are:

==Art==

The miniatures in the &quot;Libro de juegos&quot; vary between half- and full-page illustrations. The half-page miniatures typically occupy the upper half of a , with text explaining the game &quot;problem&quot; solved in the image occupying the bottom half. The back or second (verso) side of Folio 1, in a half-page illustration, depicts the initial stages of the creation of the &quot;Libro de juegos&quot;, accompanied by text on the bottom half of the page, and the front or first (recto) side of Folio 2 depicts the transmission of the game of chess from an Indian Philosopher-King to three followers. The full-page illustrations are almost exclusively on the verso side of later folios and are faced by accompanying text on the recto side of the following folio. The significance of the change in miniature size and placement may indicate images of special emphasis, could merely function as a narrative or didactic technique, or could indicate different artisans at work in Alfonso&#x27;s scriptorium as the project developed over time.

Having multiple artisans working on the &quot;Libro de juegos&quot; would have been a typical practice for medieval chanceries and scriptoria, where the labor of producing a manuscript was divided amongst individuals of varying capacities, for example the positions of scribe, draftsman, and apprentice cutting pages. But in addition to performing different tasks, various artisans could have labored at the same job, such as the work of illustration in the &quot;Libro de juegos&quot;, thereby revealing a variety of hands or styles. The &quot;Libro de Juegos&quot; offers such evidence in the difference in size between the half- and full-page illustrations in addition to changes in framing techniques amongst the folios: geometrical frames with embellished corners, architectural frames established by loosely perspectival rooftops and colonnades, and games played under tents. Other stylistic variances are found in figural representation, in facial types, and in a repertoire of different postures assumed by the players in different folios in the manuscript.

For example, in a comparison of two miniatures, found on Folios 53v and 76r, examples of these different styles are apparent, although the trope of a pair of gamers is maintained. In Folio 53v, two men are playing chess, both wearing turbans and robes. Although they may be seated on rugs on the ground, as suggested by the ceramic containers that are placed on or front of the rug near the man on the right side of the board, the figures&#x27; seated positions, which are full frontal with knees bent at right angles, suggests that they are seated on stools or perhaps upholstered benches. The figures&#x27; robes display a Byzantine conservatism, with their modeled three-dimensionality and allusion to a Classical style, yet the iconic hand gestures are reminiscent of a Romanesque energy and theatricality. Although the figures are seated with their knees and torsos facing front, their shoulders and heads rotate in three-quarter profile toward the center of the page, the chess board, and each other. The proximal, inner arm of each player (the arm that is closest to the board) is raised in a speaking gesture; the distal, outside arms of the players are also raised and are bent at the elbows, creating a partial crossing of each player&#x27;s torso as the hands lift in speaking gestures. The faces reveal a striking specificity of subtle detail, particular to a limited number of miniatures throughout the &quot;Libro de juegos&quot;, perhaps indicative of a particular artist&#x27;s hand. These details include full cheeks, realistic wrinkles around the eyes and across the brow, and a red, full-lipped mouth that hints at the Gothic affectations in figural representation coming out of France during the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries.

The style in the miniature in Folio 76v is markedly different from the style in Folio 53v. In this case, the framed miniature contains two men, perhaps Spanish, with uncovered wavy light brown hair that falls to the jaw line. The men seem young, as the player on the left has no facial hair and his face is unlined. In both folios, both pairs of players are playing tables and seem to be well-dressed, although there is no addition of gold detailing to their robes as seen in the wardrobes of aristocratic players in other miniatures. These players are seated on the ground, leaning on pillows that are placed next to a tables board. In this miniature, the figure on the left side of the board faces the reader, while the figure on the right leans in to the board with his back to the reader. In other words, each player is leaning on his left elbow, using his right hand to reach across his body to play. In the miniatures of this style, the emphasis seems to be more on the posture of the player than the detail of their faces; this crossed, lounging style is only found in the folios of the &quot;Libro de tablas&quot;, the third section of the &quot;Libro de juegos&quot; which explains tables games, again perhaps indicative of the work of a particular artist.

Other visual details contemporaneous of Alfonso&#x27;s court and social and cultural milieu infuse the &quot;Libro de juegos&quot;. Although some of the miniatures are framed by simple rectangles with corners embellished by the golden castles and lions of Castile and León, other are framed by medieval Spanish architectural motifs, including Gothic and Mudéjar arcades of columns and arches. At times, the figural depictions are hierarchical, especially in scenes with representations of Alfonso, where the king is seated on a raised throne while dictating to scribes or meting out punishments to gamblers. Yet a contemporary atmosphere of Spanish &quot;convivencia&quot; is evoked by the inclusion nobility, rogues, vagrants, young and old, men, women, Christian, Muslim, and Jewish characters. Alfonso himself is depicted throughout the text, both as participant and spectator and as an older man and as a younger. The pages are filled with many social classes and ethnicities in various stages of solving the challenges presented by games.

==Iconography ==
The can be divided into three parts: the games and problems it explores textually, the actual illuminations themselves, and the metaphysical allegories, where an analysis of the texts and illuminations reveals the movements of the macrocosmos of the universe and the microcosmos of man. The symbolism within the medieval illuminations, as explained by the accompanying texts, reveal allusions to medieval literature, art, science, law and philosophy. Intended as a didactic text, the manuscript functions as a manual that documents and explains how and why one plays games ranging from pure, intellectual strategy (chess), to games of pure chance (dice), to games that incorporate both elements (tables). Conceivably, Alfonso hoped to elucidate for himself how to better play the game of life, while also providing a teaching tool for others. The game of &quot;ajedrex&quot;, or chess, is not the only game explained in the , but it does occupy the primary position in the text and is given the most attention to detail.

In the thirteenth century, chess had been played in Europe for almost two hundred years, having been introduced into Europe by Arabs around the year 1000. The Arabs had become familiar with the game as early as the eighth century when the Islamic empire conquered Persia, where the game of chess was alleged to have been originated. It is said that a royal advisor had invented the game in order to teach his king prudence without having to overtly correct him. As Arab contact with the West expanded, so too did the game and its various permutations, and by the twelfth century, chess was becoming an entertaining diversion among a growing population of Europeans, including some scholars, clergy, the aristocracy, and the merchant classes; thus, by the thirteenth century, the iconography and symbolism associated with chess would have been accessible and familiar to Alfonso and his literate court culture, who may have had access to the private library, and manuscripts, of Alfonso, including the .

The manuscript was a Castilian translation of Arabic texts, which were themselves translations of Persian manuscripts. The visual trope portrayed in the miniatures is seen in other European transcriptions of the Arabic translations, most notably the German Carmina Burana Manuscript: two figures, one on either side of the board, with the board tilted up to reveal to the readers the moves made by the players. The juxtaposition of chess and dice in Arabic tradition, indicating the opposing values of skill (chess) and ignorance (dice), was given a different spin in Alfonso&#x27;s manuscript, however. As Alfonso elucidates in the opening section of the , the &quot;Libro de ajedrex&quot; (Book of chess) demonstrates the value of the intellect, the &quot;Libro de los dados&quot; (Book of dice) illustrates that chance has supremacy over pure intellect, and the&quot; Libro de las tablas&quot; (Book of tables) celebrates a conjoined use of both intellect and chance. Further, the iconographic linkage between chess and kingship in the Western tradition continued to evolve and became symbolic of kingly virtues, including skill, prudence, and intelligence.

==Literary context==
Most of the work accomplished in Alfonso&#x27;s scriptorium consisted of translations into the Spanish vernacular from Arabic translations of Greek texts or classical Jewish medicinal texts. As a result, very few original works were produced by this scholar-king, relative to the huge amount of work that was translated under his auspices. This enormous focus on translation was perhaps an attempt by Alfonso to continue the legacy of academic openness in Castile, initiated by Islamic rulers in Córdoba, where the emirates had also employed armies of translators in order to fill their libraries with Arabic translations of classic Greek texts. Alfonso was successful in promoting Castilian society and culture through his emphasis on the use of Galaico-Portuguese and Castilian, in academic, juridical, diplomatic, literary, and historical works. This emphasis also had the effect of reducing the universality of his translated works and original academic writings, as Latin was the &quot;lingua franca&quot; in both Iberia and Europe; yet Alfonso never desisted in his promotion of the Castilian vernacular.

==Legacy==
In 1217, Alfonso had captured the Kingdom of Murcia, on the Mediterranean coast south of Valencia, for his father, King Alfonso IX, thereby unifying the kingdoms of Castile and León, bringing together the northern half of the Iberian Peninsula under one Christian throne. With the Christian &quot;Reconquista&quot; of the Peninsula underway, inroads into Islamic territories were successfully incorporating lands previously held by the &quot;taifa&quot; kingdoms. The arts and sciences prospered in the Kingdom of Castile under the confluence of Latin and Arabic traditions of academic curiosity as Alfonso sponsored scholars, translators, and artists of all three religions of the Book (Jewish, Christian, and Muslim) in his chanceries and scriptoria. Clerical and secular scholars from Europe turned their eyes to the Iberian Peninsula as the arts and sciences prospered in an early Spanish &quot;renaissance&quot; under the patronage of Alfonso X, who was continuing the tradition of (relatively) enlightened and tolerant &quot;convivencia&quot; established by the Muslim emirate several centuries earlier.

As an inheritor of a dynamic mixture of Arabic and Latin culture, Alfonso was steeped in the rich heritage of humanistic philosophy, and the production of his reveals the compendium of world views that comprised the eclectic thirteenth-century admixture of faith and science. According to this approach, man&#x27;s actions could be traced historically, and his failures and successes could be studied as lessons to be applied to his future progress. These experiences can be played out and studied as they are lived, or as game moves played and analysed in the pages of the . It is a beautiful and luxurious document, rich not only in workmanship but also in the amount of scholarship of multiple medieval disciplines that are integrated in its pages.

<text>Lithium citrate (Li3C6H5O7) is a lithium salt of citric acid that is used as a mood stabilizer in psychiatric treatment of manic states and bipolar disorder. There is extensive pharmacology of lithium, the active component of this salt.

Lithia water contains various lithium salts, including the citrate.

== History ==
An early version of Coca-Cola available in pharmacies&#x27; soda fountains called Lithia Coke was a mixture of Coca-Cola syrup and lithia water. The soft drink 7Up was originally named &quot;Bib-Label Lithiated Lemon-Lime Soda&quot; when it was formulated in 1929 because it contained lithium citrate. The beverage was a patent medicine marketed as a cure for hangover. Lithium citrate was removed from 7Up in 1948 after the Food and Drug Administration banned its use in soda.

Lithium citrate is used as a mood stabilizer and is used to treat mania, hypomania, depression and bipolar disorder. It can be administered orally in the form of a syrup.

<text>Lithium carbonate is an inorganic compound, the lithium salt of carbonic acid with the formula . This white salt is widely used in processing metal oxides. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines for its efficacy in the treatment of mood disorders such as bipolar disorder.

==Uses==
Lithium carbonate is an important industrial chemical. Its main use is as a precursor to compounds used in lithium-ion batteries.

Glasses derived from lithium carbonate are useful in ovenware. Lithium carbonate is a common ingredient in both low-fire and high-fire ceramic glaze. It forms low-melting fluxes with silica and other materials. Its alkaline properties are conducive to changing the state of metal oxide colorants in glaze, particularly red iron oxide (). Cement sets more rapidly when prepared with lithium carbonate, and is useful for tile adhesives. When added to aluminium trifluoride, it forms LiF which yields a superior electrolyte for the processing of aluminium.

===Rechargeable batteries===

Lithium carbonate-derived compounds are crucial to lithium-ion batteries. Lithium carbonate may be converted into lithium hydroxide as an intermediate. In practice, two components of the battery are made with lithium compounds: the cathode and the electrolyte. The electrolyte is a solution of lithium hexafluorophosphate, while the cathode uses one of several lithiated structures, the most popular of which are lithium cobalt oxide and lithium iron phosphate.

===Medical uses===

In 1843, lithium carbonate was used to treat stones in the bladder. In 1859, some doctors recommended a therapy with lithium salts for a number of ailments, including gout, urinary calculi, rheumatism, mania, depression, and headache.

In 1948, John Cade discovered the anti-manic effects of lithium ions. This finding led to lithium carbonate&#x27;s use as a psychiatric medication to treat mania, the elevated phase of bipolar disorder. Prescription lithium carbonate from a pharmacy is suitable for use as medicine in humans but industrial lithium carbonate is not since it may contain unsafe levels of toxic heavy metals or other toxicants. After ingestion, lithium carbonate is dissociated into pharmacologically active lithium ions (Li+) and (non-therapeutic) carbonate, with 300 mg of lithium carbonate containing approximately 8 mEq (8 mmol) of lithium ion. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 300–600 mg of lithium carbonate taken two to three times daily is typical for maintenance of bipolar I disorder in adults, where the exact dose given varies depending on factors such as the patient&#x27;s serum lithium concentrations, which must be closely monitored by a physician to avoid lithium toxicity and potential kidney damage (or even kidney failure) from lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Dehydration and certain drugs, including NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, can increase serum lithium concentrations to unsafe levels whereas other drugs, such as caffeine, may decrease concentrations. In contrast to the elemental ions sodium, potassium, and calcium, there is no known cellular mechanism specifically dedicated to regulating intracellular lithium. 
Lithium can enter cells through epithelial sodium channels. Lithium ions interfere with ion transport processes that relay and amplify messages carried to the cells of the brain. Mania is associated with irregular increases in protein kinase C (PKC) activity within the brain. Lithium carbonate and sodium valproate, another drug traditionally used to treat the disorder, act in the brain by inhibiting PKC&#x27;s activity and help to produce other compounds that also inhibit the PKC. Lithium carbonate&#x27;s mood-controlling properties are not fully understood.

====Health risks====

Taking lithium salts has risks and side effects. Extended use of lithium to treat mental disorders has been known to lead to acquired nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Lithium intoxication can affect the central nervous system and renal system and can be lethal. Over a prolonged period, lithium can accumulate in the principal cells of the collecting duct and interfere with antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which regulates the water permeability of principal cells in the collecting tubule. The medullary interstitium of the collecting duct system naturally has a high sodium concentration and attempts to maintain it. There is no known mechanism for cells to distinguish lithium ions from sodium ions, so damage to the kidney&#x27;s nephrons may occur if lithium concentrations become too high as a result of dehydration, hyponatremia, an unusually low sodium diet, or certain drugs.

===Red pyrotechnic colorant===
Lithium carbonate is used to impart a red color to fireworks.

==Properties and reactions ==
Unlike sodium carbonate, which forms at least three hydrates, lithium carbonate exists only in the anhydrous form. Its solubility in water is low relative to other lithium salts. The isolation of lithium from aqueous extracts of lithium ores capitalizes on this poor solubility. Its apparent solubility increases 10-fold under a mild pressure of carbon dioxide; this effect is due to the formation of the metastable lithium bicarbonate, which is more soluble:
: + + 2 
The extraction of lithium carbonate at high pressures of and its precipitation upon depressurizing is the basis of the Quebec process.

Lithium carbonate can also be purified by exploiting its diminished solubility in hot water. Thus, heating a saturated aqueous solution causes crystallization of .

Lithium carbonate, and other carbonates of group 1, do not decarboxylate readily. decomposes at temperatures around 1300 °C.

==Production==
Lithium is extracted from primarily two sources: spodumene in pegmatite deposits, and lithium salts in underground brine pools. About 82,000 tons were produced in 2020, showing significant and consistent growth.

===From underground brine reservoirs===
In the Salar de Atacama in the Atacama Desert of Northern Chile, lithium carbonate and hydroxide are produced from brine.

The process pumps lithium rich brine from below ground into shallow pans for evaporation. The brine contains many different dissolved ions, and as their concentration increases, salts precipitate out of solution and sink. The remaining supernatant liquid is used for the next step. The sequence of pans may vary depending on the concentration of ions in a particular source of brine.

In the first pan, halite (sodium chloride or common salt) crystallises. This has little economic value and is discarded. The supernatant, with ever increasing concentration of dissolved solids, is transferred successively to the sylvinite (sodium potassium chloride) pan, the carnalite (potassium magnesium chloride) pan and finally a pan designed to maximise the concentration of lithium chloride. The process takes about 15 months. The concentrate (30-35% lithium chloride solution) is trucked to Salar del Carmen. There, boron and magnesium are removed (typically residual boron is removed by solvent extraction and/or ion exchange and magnesium by raising the pH above 10 with sodium hydroxide) then in the final step, by addition of sodium carbonate, the desired lithium carbonate is precipitated out, separated, and processed.

Some of the by-products from the evaporation process may also have economic value.

There is considerable attention to the use of water in this water poor region. SQM commissioned a life-cycle analysis (LCA) which concluded that water consumption for SQM&#x27;s lithium hydroxide and carbonate is significantly lower than the average consumption by production from the main ore-based process, using spodumene. A more general LCA suggests the opposite for extraction from reservoirs.

The majority of brine based production is in the &quot;lithium triangle&quot; in South America.

=== From &quot;geothermal&quot; brine ===

A potential source of lithium is the leachates of geothermal wells, carried to the surface. Recovery of lithium has been demonstrated in the field; the lithium is separated by simple precipitation and filtration. The process and environmental costs are primarily those of the already-operating well; net environmental impacts may thus be positive.

The brine of United Downs Deep Geothermal Power project near Redruth is claimed by Cornish Lithium to be valuable due to its high lithium concentration (220 mg/L) with low magnesium (&lt;5 mg/L) and total dissolved solids content of &lt;29g/L, and a flow rate of 40-60l/s.

===From ore===

α-spodumene is roasted at 1100 °C for 1h to make β-spodumene, then roasted at 250 °C for 10 minutes with sulphuric acid.

As of 2020, Australia was the world&#x27;s largest producer of lithium intermediates, all based on spodumene.

In recent years mining companies have begun exploration of lithium projects throughout North America, South America and Australia to identify economic deposits that can potentially bring new supplies of lithium carbonate online to meet the growing demand for the product.

===From clay===
In 2020 Tesla Motors announced a revolutionary process to extract lithium from clay in Nevada using only salt and no acid. This was met with scepticism.

===From end-of-life batteries===
A few small companies are recycling spent batteries, focusing on recovering copper and cobalt. Some recover lithium carbonate alongside the compound Li2Al4(CO3)(OH)12⋅3H2O
also.

===Other===
In April 2017 MGX Minerals reported it had received independent confirmation of its rapid lithium extraction process to recover lithium and other valuable minerals from oil and gas wastewater brine.
Electrodialysis has been proposed to extract lithium from seawater, but it is not commercially viable.

==Natural occurrence==
Natural lithium carbonate is known as zabuyelite. This mineral is connected with deposits of some salt lakes and some pegmatites.

<text>The Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) is a battery-powered four-wheeled rover used on the Moon in the last three missions of the American Apollo program (15, 16, and 17) during 1971 and 1972. It is popularly called the Moon buggy, a play on the term &quot;dune buggy&quot;.

Built by Boeing, each LRV has a mass of without payload. It could carry a maximum payload of , including two astronauts, equipment, and cargo such as lunar samples, and was designed for a top speed of , although it achieved a top speed of on its last mission, Apollo 17.

Each LRV was carried to the Moon folded up in the Lunar Module&#x27;s Quadrant 1 Bay. After being unpacked, each was driven an average of 30 km, without major incident. These three LRVs remain on the Moon.

==History==

The concept of a lunar rover predated Apollo, with a 1952–1954 series in &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; magazine by Wernher von Braun and others, &quot;Man Will Conquer Space Soon!&quot; In this, von Braun described a six-week stay on the Moon, featuring 10-ton tractor-trailers for moving supplies.

In 1956, Mieczysław G. Bekker published two books on land locomotion while he was a University of Michigan professor and a consultant to the U.S. Army Tank-Automotive Command&#x27;s Land Locomotion Laboratory. The books provided much of the theoretical basis for future lunar vehicle development.

In 1959, Georg von Tiesenhausen conceived the lunar rover as a four-wheel-drive vehicle with noninflated, flexible wheels.

=== Early lunar mobility studies ===
In the February 1964 issue of &quot;Popular Science&quot;, von Braun, then director of NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), discussed the need for a lunar surface vehicle, and revealed that studies had been underway at Marshall in conjunction with Lockheed, Bendix, Boeing, General Motors, Brown Engineering, Grumman, and Bell Aerospace. Saverio Morea was named LRV Manager at MSFC in 1961.

Beginning in the early 1960s, a series of studies centering on lunar mobility were conducted under Marshall. This began with the lunar logistics system (LLS), followed by the mobility laboratory (MOLAB), then the lunar scientific survey module (LSSM), and finally the mobility test article (MTA). In early planning for the Apollo program, it had been assumed that two Saturn V launch vehicles would be used for each lunar mission: one for sending the crew aboard a Lunar Surface Module (LSM) to lunar orbit, landing, and returning, and a second for sending an LSM-Truck (LSM-T) with all of the equipment, supplies, and transport vehicle for use by the crew while on the surface. All of the first Marshall studies were based on this dual-launch assumption, allowing a large, heavy, roving vehicle. 

Grumman and Northrop, in the fall of 1962, began to design pressurized-cabin vehicles, with electric motors for each wheel. At about this same time, Bendix and Boeing started their internal studies on lunar transportation systems. Mieczysław Bekker, now with General Motors Defense Research Laboratories at Santa Barbara, California, was completing a study for NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory on a small, uncrewed lunar roving vehicle for the Surveyor program. Ferenc Pavlics, originally from Hungary, used a wire-mesh design for &quot;resilient wheels,&quot; a design that would be followed in future small rovers.

In early 1963, NASA selected Marshall for studies in an Apollo Logistics Support System (ALSS). Following reviews of all earlier efforts, this resulted in a 10-volume report. Included was the need for a pressurized vehicle in the weight range, accommodating two men with their expendables and instruments for traverses up to two weeks in duration. In June 1964, Marshall awarded contracts to Bendix and Boeing, with GM&#x27;s lab designated as the vehicle technology subcontractor. Bell Aerospace was already under contract for studies of Lunar Flying Vehicles.

Even as the Bendix and Boeing studies were underway, Marshall was examining a less ambitious surface exploration activity, the LSSM. This would be composed of a fixed, habitable shelter–laboratory with a small lunar-traversing vehicle that could either carry one man or be remotely controlled. This mission would still require a dual launch with the moon vehicle carried on the &quot;lunar truck&quot;. Marshall&#x27;s Propulsion and Vehicle Engineering (P&amp;VE) lab contracted with Hayes International to make a preliminary study of the shelter and its related vehicle. Because of the potential need for an enclosed vehicle for enlarged future lunar explorations, those design efforts continued for some time and resulted in several full-scale test vehicles.

With pressure from Congress to hold down Apollo costs, Saturn V production was reduced, allowing only a single launch per mission. Any roving vehicle would have to fit on the same lunar module as the astronauts. In November 1964, two-rocket models were put on indefinite hold, but Bendix and Boeing were given study contracts for small rovers. The name of the lunar excursion module was changed to simply the lunar module, indicating that the capability for powered &quot;excursions&quot; away from a lunar-lander base did not yet exist. There could be no mobile lab—the astronauts would work out of the LM. Marshall also continued to examine uncrewed robotic rovers that could be controlled from the Earth.

From the beginnings at Marshall, the Brown Engineering Company of Huntsville, Alabama, had participated in all of the lunar mobility efforts. In 1965, Brown became the prime support contractor for Marshall&#x27;s P&amp;VE Laboratory. With an urgent need to determine the feasibility of a two-man self-contained lander, von Braun bypassed the usual procurement process and had P&amp;VE&#x27;s Advanced Studies Office directly task Brown to design, build, and test a prototype vehicle. While Bendix and Boeing would continue to refine concepts and designs for a lander, test model rovers were vital for Marshall human factors studies involving spacesuit-clad astronauts interfacing with power, telemetry, navigation, and life-support rover equipment.

Brown&#x27;s team made full use of the earlier small-rover studies, and commercially available components were incorporated wherever possible. The selection of wheels was of great importance, and almost nothing was known at that time about the lunar surface. The Marshall Space Sciences Laboratory (SSL) was responsible for predicting surface properties, and Brown was also prime support contractor for this lab; Brown set up a test area to examine a wide variety of wheel-surface conditions. To simulate Pavlics&#x27;s &quot;resilient wheel,&quot; a four-foot-diameter inner tube wrapped with nylon ski rope was used. On the small test rover, each wheel had a small electric motor, with overall power provided by standard truck batteries. A roll bar gave protection from overturning accidents.

In early 1966, Brown&#x27;s vehicle became available for examining human factors and other testing. Marshall built a small test track with craters and rock debris where several different mock-ups were compared; it became obvious that a small rover would be best for the proposed missions. The test vehicle was also operated in remote mode to determine characteristics that might be dangerous to the driver, such as acceleration, bounce-height, and turn-over tendency as it traveled at higher speeds and over simulated obstacles. The test rover&#x27;s performance under one-sixth gravity was obtained through flights on a KC-135A aircraft in a Reduced Gravity parabolic maneuver; among other things, the need for a very soft wheel and suspension combination was shown. Although Pavlics&#x27; wire-mesh wheels were not initially available for the reduced gravity tests, the mesh wheels were tested on various soils at the Waterways Experiment Station of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at Vicksburg, Mississippi. Later, when wire-mesh wheels were tested on low-g flights, the need for wheel fenders to reduce dust contamination was found. The model was also extensively tested at the U.S. Army&#x27;s Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona, as well as the Army&#x27;s Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.

=== Lunar Roving Vehicle Project ===
During 1965 and 1967, the Summer Conference on Lunar Exploration and Science brought together leading scientists to assess NASA&#x27;s planning for exploring the Moon and to make recommendations. One of their findings was that the LSSM was critical to a successful program and should be given major attention. At Marshall, von Braun established a Lunar Roving Task Team, and in May 1969, NASA approved the Manned Lunar Rover Vehicle Program as a Marshall hardware development. The project was led by Eberhard Rees, Director of Research and Development at Marshall, who oversaw the design and construction of the rover, with Saverio Morea acting as project manager.

On 11 July 1969, just before the successful Moon landing of Apollo 11, a request for proposal for the final development and building the Apollo LRV was released by Marshall. Boeing, Bendix, Grumman, and Chrysler submitted proposals. Following three months of proposal evaluation and negotiations, Boeing was selected as the Apollo LRV prime contractor on 28 October 1969. Boeing would manage the LRV project under Henry Kudish in Huntsville, Alabama. Kudish was replaced the following year in 1970 by LRV Project Manager Earl Houtz. As a major subcontractor, the General Motors Defense Research Laboratories in Santa Barbara, California, would furnish the mobility system (wheels, motors, and suspension); this effort would be led by GM Program Manager Samuel Romano and Ferenc Pavlics. Boeing in Seattle, Washington, would furnish the electronics and navigation system. Vehicle testing would take place at the Boeing facility in Kent, Washington, and the chassis manufacturing and overall assembly would be completed at the Boeing facility in Huntsville.

The first cost-plus-incentive-fee contract to Boeing was for $19,000,000 and called for delivery of the first LRV by 1 April 1971. Cost overruns, however, led to a final cost of $38,000,000, which was about the same as NASA&#x27;s original estimate. Four lunar rovers were built, one each for Apollo missions 15, 16, and 17; and one used for spare parts after the cancellation of further Apollo missions. Other LRV models were built: a static model to assist with human factors design; an engineering model to design and integrate the subsystems; two one-sixth gravity models for testing the deployment mechanism; a one-gravity trainer to give the astronauts instruction in the operation of the rover and allow them to practice driving it; a mass model to test the effect of the rover on the LM structure, balance, and handling; a vibration test unit to study the LRV&#x27;s durability and handling of launch stresses; and a qualification test unit to study integration of all LRV subsystems. A paper by Saverio Morea gives details of the LRV system and its development.LRVs were used for greater surface mobility during the Apollo J-class missions, Apollo 15, Apollo 16, and Apollo 17. The rover was first used on 31 July 1971, during the Apollo 15 mission. This greatly expanded the range of the lunar explorers. Previous teams of astronauts were restricted to short walking distances around the landing site due to the bulky space suit equipment required to sustain life in the lunar environment. The range, however, was operationally restricted to remain within walking distance of the lunar module, in case the rover broke down at any point. The rovers were designed with a top speed of about , although Eugene Cernan recorded a maximum speed of , giving him the (unofficial) lunar land-speed record.

The LRV was developed in only 17 months and performed all its functions on the Moon with no major anomalies. Scientist-astronaut Harrison Schmitt of Apollo 17 said, &quot;The Lunar Rover proved to be the reliable, safe and flexible lunar exploration vehicle we expected it to be. Without it, the major scientific discoveries of Apollo 15, 16, and 17 would not have been possible; and our current understanding of lunar evolution would not have been possible.&quot;

The LRVs experienced some minor problems. The rear fender extension on the Apollo 16 LRV was lost during the mission&#x27;s second extra-vehicular activity (EVA) at station 8 when John Young bumped into it while going to assist Charles Duke. The dust thrown up from the wheel covered the crew, the console, and the communications equipment. High battery temperatures and resulting high power consumption ensued. No repair attempt was mentioned.

The fender extension on the Apollo 17 LRV broke when accidentally bumped by Eugene Cernan with a hammer handle. Cernan and Schmitt taped the extension back in place, but due to the dusty surfaces, the tape did not adhere, and the extension was lost after about one hour of driving, causing the astronauts to be covered with dust. For their second EVA, a replacement &quot;fender&quot; was made with some EVA maps, duct tape, and a pair of clamps from inside the Lunar Module that were nominally intended for the moveable overhead light. This repair was later undone so that the clamps could be taken inside for the return launch. The maps were brought back to Earth and are now on display at the National Air and Space Museum. The abrasion from the dust is evident on some portions of the makeshift fender.
The color TV camera mounted on the front of the LRV could be remotely operated by Mission Control in pan and tilt axes as well as zoom. This allowed far better television coverage of the EVA than the earlier missions. On each mission, at the conclusion of the astronauts&#x27; stay on the surface, the commander drove the LRV to a position away from the Lunar Module so that the camera could record the ascent stage launch. The camera operator in Mission Control experienced difficulty in timing the various delays so that the LM ascent stage was in frame through the launch. On the third and final attempt (Apollo 17), the launch and ascent were successfully tracked.

NASA&#x27;s rovers, left behind, are among the artificial objects on the Moon, as are the Soviet Union&#x27;s uncrewed rovers, &quot;Lunokhod 1&quot; and &quot;Lunokhod 2&quot;.

== Features and specifications ==
The Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle is a battery electric vehicle designed to operate in the low-gravity vacuum of the Moon and to be capable of traversing the lunar surface, allowing the Apollo astronauts to extend the range of their surface extravehicular activities. Three LRVs were used on the Moon: one on Apollo 15 by astronauts David Scott and Jim Irwin, one on Apollo 16 by John Young and Charles Duke, and one on Apollo 17 by Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt. The mission commander served as the driver, occupying the left-hand seat of each LRV. Features are available in papers by Morea, Baker, and Kudish.

=== Mass and payload ===

The Lunar Roving Vehicles have a mass of , and were designed to hold an additional payload of . This resulted in weights in the approximately one-sixth g on the lunar surface of empty (curb weight) and fully loaded (gross vehicle weight). The vehicle frame is long with a wheelbase of . The height of the vehicles is . The frame is made of 2219 aluminum alloy tubing welded assemblies and consisted of a three-part chassis that was hinged in the center so it could be folded up and hung in the Lunar Module Quadrant 1 bay, which was kept open to space by omission of the outer skin panel. They have two side-by-side foldable seats made of tubular aluminum with nylon webbing and aluminum floor panels. An armrest was mounted between the seats, and each seat had adjustable footrests and a Velcro-fastened seat belt. A large mesh dish antenna was mounted on a mast on the front center of the rover. The suspension consists of a double horizontal wishbone with upper and lower torsion bars and a damper unit between the chassis and upper wishbone. Fully loaded, the LRV has a ground clearance of .

=== Wheels and power ===
The wheels were designed and manufactured by General Motors Defense Research Laboratories in Santa Barbara, California. Ferenc Pavlics was given special recognition by NASA for developing the &quot;resilient wheel&quot;. They consisted of a spun aluminum hub and a , tire made of zinc-coated woven steel strands attached to the rim. Titanium chevrons covered 50% of the contact area to provide traction. Inside the tire was a titanium bump stop frame to protect the hub. Dust guards were mounted above the wheels. Each wheel had its own electric drive made by Delco, a brushed DC electric motor capable of at 10,000 rpm, attached to the wheel via an 80:1 harmonic drive, and a mechanical brake unit. In the case of drive failure, astronauts could remove pins to disengage the drive from the wheel, allowing the wheel to spin freely.

Maneuvering capability was provided through the use of front and rear steering motors. Each series-wound DC steering motor was capable of . The front and rear wheels could pivot in opposite directions to achieve a tight turning radius of , or could be decoupled so only front or rear would be used for steering. The wheels were linked in Ackermann steering geometry, where the inside tires have a greater turn angle than the outside tires, to avoid sideslip.

Power was provided by two 36-volt silver-zinc potassium hydroxide non-rechargeable batteries developed by Eagle-Picher with a charge capacity of 121 A·h each (a total of 242 A·h), yielding a range of . These were used to power the drive and steering motors and also a 36-volt utility outlet mounted on the front of the LRV to power the communications relay unit or the TV camera. LRV batteries and electronics were passively cooled, using change-of-phase wax thermal capacitor packages and reflective, upward-facing radiating surfaces. While driving, radiators were covered with mylar blankets to minimize dust accumulation. When stopped, the astronauts would open the blankets, and manually remove excess dust from the cooling surfaces with hand brushes.

=== Control and navigation ===

A T-shaped hand controller situated between the two seats controlled the four drive motors, two steering motors, and brakes. Moving the stick forward powered the LRV forward, left and right turned the vehicle left or right, and pulling backwards activated the brakes. Activating a switch on the handle before pulling back would put the LRV into reverse. Pulling the handle all the way back activated a parking brake. The control and display modules were situated in front of the handle and gave information on the speed, heading, pitch, and power and temperature levels.

Navigation was based on continuously recording direction and distance through use of a directional gyro and odometer and feeding this data to a computer that would keep track of the overall direction and distance back to the LM. There was also a Sun-shadow device that could give a manual heading based on the direction of the Sun, using the fact that the Sun moved very slowly in the sky.

== Usage ==

The LRV was used during the lunar surface operations of Apollo 15, 16 and 17, the J missions of the Apollo program. On each mission, the LRV was used on three separate EVAs, for a total of nine lunar traverses, or sorties. During operation, the commander (CDR) always drove, while the Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) was a passenger who assisted with navigation.

An operational constraint on the use of the LRV was that the astronauts must be able to walk back to the LM if the LRV were to fail at any time during the EVA (called the &quot;Walkback Limit&quot;). Thus, the traverses were limited in the distance they could go at the start and at any time later in the EVA. Therefore, they went to the farthest point away from the LM and worked their way back to it so that, as the life support consumables were depleted, their remaining walk back distance was equally diminished. This constraint was relaxed during the longest traverse on Apollo 17, based on the demonstrated reliability of the LRV and spacesuits on previous missions. A paper by Burkhalter and Sharp provides details on usage.

=== Deployment ===

Astronaut deployment of the Lunar Roving Vehicle from the LM&#x27;s open Quadrant 1 bay was achieved with a system of pulleys and braked reels using ropes and cloth tapes. The rover was folded and stored in the bay with the underside of the chassis facing out. One astronaut would climb the egress ladder on the LM and release the rover, which would then be slowly tilted out by the second astronaut on the ground through the use of reels and tapes. As the rover was let down from the bay, most of the deployment was automatic. The rear wheels folded out and locked in place. When they touched the ground, the front of the rover could be unfolded, the wheels deployed, and the entire frame let down to the surface by pulleys.

The rover components locked into place upon opening. Cabling, pins, and tripods would then be removed and the seats and footrests raised. After switching on all the electronics, the vehicle was ready to back away from the LM.

=== Locations ===
Four flight-ready LRVs were manufactured, as well as several others for testing and training. Three were transported to and left on the Moon via the Apollo 15, 16, and 17 missions (LRV-1 to 3), with the fourth (LRV-4) used for spare parts for the first three following the cancellation of Apollo 18.

The rover used on Apollo 15 was left at Hadley-Apennine (). The rover used on Apollo 16 was left at Descartes (). The rover used on Apollo 17 was left at Taurus-Littrow () and was seen by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter during passes in 2009 and 2011. In 2020 the State of Washington designated the flown rovers as historic landmarks.

Since only the upper stages of the lunar excursion modules could return to lunar orbit from the surface, the vehicles, along with the lower stages were abandoned. As a result, the only lunar rovers on display are LRV-4, test vehicles, trainers, and mock-ups.
* Lunar Roving Vehicle 4 (LRV-4) is on display at the Kennedy Space Center Visitors Complex in Cape Canaveral, Florida.
* The Engineering Mockup , intended to design and integrate subsystems, is on display at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington.

<doc id="18240" wikidata="Q6476449" url="?curid=18240" title="Lake Kickapoo">
<text>Lake Kickapoo is a reservoir located on the North Fork Little Wichita River in the Red River Basin of Archer County, Texas. It is neighbored by Archer City, Texas (population of 1,834) and Wichita Falls, Texas (population of 104,553) which reside within the Central Great Plains ecoregion.

== Hydrology ==
Lake Kickapoo reservoir was created by the impoundment of North Fork Little Wichita River, its only in-flow tributary, in 1946. The out-flow tributaries are Kickapoo Creek, Brier Creek, and Slippery Creek. It has a mean water level of 1,038 feet, surface area of 4,312 acres, and elevation of 1,060 feet above sea level as of 2022. The storage capacity, as of October 29, 2022, is 51,596 acre-feet with a maximum capacity of 86,345 acre-feet. The reservoir storage has steadily dropped by 293 acre-feet/year since 1945 when it had a total capacity of 106,000 acre-feet, due to increasing drought events in the region.

== Ecoregion ==
Lake Kickapoo resides within the Broken Red Plains subdivision of the Central Great Plains ecoregion. The Broken Red Plains ecoregion is defined by red clay and sandy soils, with irregular sandstone and shrub-covered surface of the even more specific Wichita Formation ecoregion. It is predominantly grass-/shrublands with plant species like Texas wintergrass, blue grama, buffalograss, sand bluestem, etc. The riparian vegetation includes species such as cedar elm trees, pecan trees, black willow trees, and tobosa grass. This region has an annual precipitation of 30 inches and mean air temperature of 41 degrees Fahrenheit in January and 84 degrees Fahrenheit in July.

== Uses ==

=== Water supply ===
The construction of Lake Kickapoo Dam began in January 1945 and was completed on December 15, 1945. However, the deliberate impoundment of the North Fork Little Wichita River, a tributary of the Red River, did not occur until February 1, 1946. Lake Kickapoo Dam is classified as earth-fill embankment dam with a length of 8.200 feet (including spillway) and height of 62 feet. This dam&#x27;s maximum design water surface has the capability to reach 1,060 feet above sea level but has been experiencing much lower levels due to recent droughts in the area. The dam&#x27;s uncontrolled spillway is classified as ogee concrete and has a crest elevation of 1,045 feet above sea level. Lake Kickapoo reservoir is owned by the city of Wichita Falls and operated for the continued use as a water supply. Although it is owned by the city of Wichita Falls, the dam is regulated by the government entity Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

=== U.S. Naval Space Surveillance ===
One of the nine Air Force Space Surveillance System (formerly NAVSPASUR) sites is located at Lake Kickapoo (33°32.764′N 98°45.763′W). Lake Kickapoo Field Station is one of three transmitter sites of the southern surveillance network, which is operated by the U.S. Naval Command. The purpose of these stations is to maintain an electromagnetic fence that has the capability to identify objects as far as 15,000 nautical miles. The Lake Kickapoo field station was constructed in 1951 to fill a gap in the surveillance fence. It is considered unique due to its transmitting power of 560 kilowatts via the combination of commercial FM and TV power unit frequencies.

== Recreation ==

=== Sports fishing ===
The main source of recreation for Lake Kickapoo is sports fishing. The reservoir contains sports fish species, such as Blue catfish (abundant), Channel catfish, Flathead catfish, White Bass (abundant), Largemouth Bass, and White Crappie (declining in abundance). These fish species are supported by prey fish, such as Gizzard shad (abundant) and Bluegill (decreased abundance).

Management plans have been enacted to support the genetic diversity of Largemouth Bass due to this species designation as a source for Texas Parks and Wildlife Department hatchery brood stock program. This is due to the decline in habitat for spawning and nursery areas via decreased water elevation.

== History ==

=== Namesake ===
The name was derived from the Native American Kickapoo tribe that was native to that area along with the nearby inflow stream, Kickapoo Creek.

=== Land use ===
There is an elevated abundance of honey mesquite in the Broken Red Plains that has been associated with the 19th century cattle drives and subsequent grazing pressure via land use.

=== Dam ===
Lake Kickapoo Dam was designed by F. M. Rugeley and A. J. Gates.

<doc id="18245" wikidata="Q48963" url="?curid=18245" title="Labyrinth">
<text>In Greek mythology, the Labyrinth () is an elaborate, confusing structure designed and built by the legendary artificer Daedalus for King Minos of Crete at Knossos. Its function was to hold the Minotaur, the monster eventually killed by the hero Theseus. Daedalus had so cunningly made the Labyrinth that he could barely escape it after he built it.

Although early Cretan coins occasionally exhibit branching (multicursal) patterns, the single-path (unicursal) seven-course &quot;Classical&quot; design without branching or dead ends became associated with the Labyrinth on coins as early as 430 BC, and similar non-branching patterns became widely used as visual representations of the Labyrinth – even though both logic and literary descriptions make it clear that the Minotaur was trapped in a complex branching maze. Even as the designs became more elaborate, visual depictions of the mythological Labyrinth from the Roman era until the Renaissance are almost invariably unicursal. Branching mazes were reintroduced only when hedge mazes became popular during the Renaissance.

In English, the term &quot;labyrinth&quot; is generally synonymous with &quot;maze&quot;. As a result of the long history of unicursal representation of the mythological Labyrinth, however, many contemporary scholars and enthusiasts observe a distinction between the two. In this specialized usage, &quot;maze&quot; refers to a complex branching multicursal puzzle with choices of path and direction, while a unicursal &quot;labyrinth&quot; has only a single path to the center. A labyrinth in this sense has an unambiguous route to the center and back and presents no navigational challenge.

Unicursal labyrinths appeared as designs on pottery or basketry, as body art, and in etchings on walls of caves or churches. The Romans created many primarily decorative unicursal designs on walls and floors in tile or mosaic. Many labyrinths set in floors or on the ground are large enough that the path can be walked. Unicursal patterns have been used historically both in group ritual and for private meditation, and are increasingly found for therapeutic use in hospitals and hospices.

==Etymology==

&quot;Labyrinth&quot; is a word of pre-Greek origin whose derivation and meaning are uncertain. Maximillian Mayer suggested as early as 1892 that &quot;labyrinthos&quot; might derive from &quot;labrys&quot;, a Lydian word for &quot;double-bladed axe&quot;. Arthur Evans, who excavated the Minoan palace of Knossos in Crete early in the 20th century, suggested that the ruins there inspired the story of the labyrinth, and since the double axe motif appears in the palace ruins, he asserted that &quot;labyrinth&quot; could be understood to mean &quot;the house of the double axe&quot;. The same symbol, however, was discovered in other palaces in Crete. Nilsson observed that in Crete the double axe is not a weapon and always accompanies goddesses or women and not a male god.

The association with &quot;labrys&quot; lost some traction when Linear B was deciphered in the 1950s, and an apparent Mycenaean Greek rendering of &quot;labyrinth&quot; appeared as (). This may be related to the Minoan word &quot;du-pu₂-re&quot;, which appears in Linear A on libation tablets and in connection with Mount Dikte and Mount Ida, both of which are associated with caverns. Caverns near Gortyna, the Cretan capital in the 1st century AD, were called &quot;labyrinthos&quot;.

Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; gives four examples of ancient labyrinths: the Cretan labyrinth, an Egyptian labyrinth, a Lemnian labyrinth, and an Italian labyrinth. These are all complex underground structures, and this appears to have been the standard Classical understanding of the word.

Beekes also finds the relation with &quot;labrys&quot; speculative, and suggests instead a relation with Greek (&#x27;narrow street&#x27;).

==Ancient labyrinths==
===Cretan labyrinth===
When the Bronze Age site at Knossos was excavated by archaeologist Arthur Evans, the complexity of the architecture prompted him to suggest that the palace had been the Labyrinth of Daedalus. Evans found various bull motifs, including an image of a man leaping over the horns of a bull, as well as depictions of a labrys carved into the walls. On the strength of a passage in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, it has been suggested that the palace was the site of a dancing-ground made for Ariadne by the craftsman Daedalus,
where young men and women, of the age of those sent to Crete as prey for the Minotaur, would dance together. By extension, in popular legend the palace is associated with the myth of the Minotaur.

In the 2000s, archaeologists explored other potential sites of the labyrinth. Oxford University geographer Nicholas Howarth believes that &quot;Evans&#x27;s hypothesis that the palace of Knossos is also the Labyrinth must be treated sceptically.&quot; Howarth and his team conducted a search of an underground complex known as the Skotino cave but concluded that it was formed naturally. Another contender is a series of tunnels at Gortyn, accessed by a narrow crack but expanding into interlinking caverns. Unlike the Skotino cave, these caverns have smooth walls and columns, and appear to have been at least partially man-made. This site corresponds to a labyrinth symbol on a 16th-century map of Crete in a book of maps in the library of Christ Church, Oxford. A map of the caves themselves was produced by the French in 1821. The site was also used by German soldiers to store ammunition during the Second World War. Howarth&#x27;s investigation was shown on a documentary produced for the National Geographic Channel.

===The Egyptian labyrinth===

In Book II of his &quot;Histories&quot;, Herodotus applies the term &quot;labyrinth&quot; to a building complex in Egypt &quot;near the place called the City of Crocodiles&quot;, that he considered to surpass the pyramids. The structure, which may have been a collection of funerary temples such as are commonly found near Egyptian pyramids, was destroyed in antiquity and can only be partially reconstructed. During the nineteenth century, the remains of this ancient Egyptian structure were discovered at Hawara in the Faiyum Oasis by Flinders Petrie at the foot of the pyramid of the twelfth-dynasty pharaoh Amenemhat III (reigned c. 1860 BC to c. 1814 BC).

===Pliny&#x27;s Lemnian labyrinth===
Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; (36.90) lists the legendary Smilis, reputed to be a contemporary of Daedalus, together with the historical mid-sixth-century BC architects and sculptors Rhoikos and Theodoros as two of the makers of the Lemnian labyrinth, which Andrew Stewart regards as &quot;evidently a misunderstanding of the Samian temple&#x27;s location &quot;en limnais&quot; [&#x27;in the marsh&#x27;].&quot;

===Pliny&#x27;s Italian labyrinth===
According to Pliny, the Tomb of Lars Porsena contained an underground maze. Pliny&#x27;s description of the exposed portion of the tomb is intractable; Pliny, it seems clear, had not observed this structure himself, but is quoting the historian and Roman antiquarian Varro.

===Ancient labyrinths outside Europe===

A design essentially identical to the 7-course &quot;classical&quot; pattern appeared in Native American culture, the Tohono O&#x27;odham people labyrinth which features I&#x27;itoi, the &quot;Man in the Maze.&quot; The Tonoho O&#x27;odham pattern has two distinct differences from the classical: it is radial in design, and the entrance is at the top, where traditional labyrinths have the entrance at the bottom (see below). The earliest appearances cannot be dated securely; the oldest is commonly dated to the 17th century.

Unsubstantiated claims have been made for the early appearance of labyrinth figures in India, such as a prehistoric petroglyph on a riverbank in Goa purportedly dating to circa 2500 BC. Other examples have been found among cave art in northern India and on a dolmen shrine in the Nilgiri Mountains, but are difficult to date accurately. Securely datable examples begin to appear only around 250 BC. Early labyrinths in India typically follow the Classical pattern or a local variant of it; some have been described as plans of forts or cities.

Labyrinths appear in Indian manuscripts and Tantric texts from the 17th century onward. They are often called &quot;Chakravyuha&quot; in reference to an impregnable battle formation described in the ancient Mahabharata epic. Lanka, the capital city of mythic Rāvana, is described as a labyrinth in the 1910 translation of Al-Beruni&#x27;s &quot;India&quot; (c. 1030 AD) p. 306 (with a diagram on the following page).

By the White Sea, notably on the Solovetsky Islands, there have been preserved more than 30 stone labyrinths. The most remarkable monument is the Stone labyrinths of Bolshoi Zayatsky Island – a group of some 13 stone labyrinths on 0.4 km2 area of one small island. Local archaeologists have speculated that these labyrinths may be 2,000–3,000 years old, though most researchers remain dubious.

==Labyrinth as pattern==

The 7-course &quot;Classical&quot; or &quot;Cretan&quot; pattern known from Cretan coins (ca 400–200 BC) appears in several examples from antiquity, some perhaps as early as the late Stone Age or early Bronze Age. Roman floor mosaics typically unite four copies of the classical labyrinth (or a similar pattern) interlinked around the center, squared off as the medium requires, but still recognisable. An image of the Minotaur or an allusion to the legend of the Minotaur appears at the center of many of these mosaic labyrinths.
The four-axis medieval patterns may have developed from the Roman model, but are more varied in how the four quadrants of the design are traced out. The Minotaur or other danger is retained in the center of several medieval examples. The Chartres pattern (named for its appearance in Chartres Cathedral) is the most common medieval design; it appears in manuscripts as early as the 9th century.

==Medieval labyrinths and turf mazes==

When the early humanist Benzo d&#x27;Alessandria visited Verona before 1310, he noted the &quot;&quot;Laberinthum&quot; which is now called the Arena&quot;; perhaps he was seeing the &quot;cubiculi&quot; beneath the arena&#x27;s missing floor.
The full flowering of the medieval labyrinth came about from the twelfth through fourteenth centuries with the grand pavement labyrinths of the gothic cathedrals, notably Chartres, Reims and Amiens in northern France. The symbolism or purpose behind these is unclear, and may have varied from one installation to the next. Descriptions survive of French clerics performing a ritual Easter dance along the path on Easter Sunday. Some labyrinths may have originated as allusions to the Holy City; and some modern writers have theorized that prayers and devotions may have accompanied the perambulation of their intricate paths. Although some books (in particular guidebooks) suggest that the mazes on cathedral floors served as substitutes for pilgrimage paths, the earliest attested use of the phrase &quot;chemin de Jerusalem&quot; (path to Jerusalem) dates to the late 18th century when it was used to describe mazes at Reims and Saint-Omer. The accompanying ritual, depicted in Romantic illustrations as involving pilgrims following the maze on their knees while praying, may have been practiced at Chartres during the 17th century. The cathedral labyrinths are thought to be the inspiration for the many turf mazes in the UK, such as survive at Wing, Hilton, Alkborough, and Saffron Walden.

Over the same general period, some 500 or more non-ecclesiastical labyrinths were constructed in Scandinavia. These labyrinths, generally in coastal areas, are marked out with stones, most often in the simple 7- or 11-course classical forms. They often have names which translate as &quot;Troy Town.&quot; They are thought to have been constructed by fishing communities: trapping malevolent trolls or winds in the labyrinth&#x27;s coils might ensure a safe fishing expedition. There are also stone labyrinths on the Isles of Scilly, although none is known to date from before the nineteenth century.

There are examples of labyrinths in many disparate cultures. The symbol has appeared in various forms and media (petroglyphs, classic-form, medieval-form, pavement, turf, and basketry) at some time throughout most parts of the world, from Native North and South America to Australia, Java, India, and Nepal.

== Modern labyrinths==

Starting in the late 20th century, there has been a resurgence of interest in labyrinths and a revival in labyrinth building, of both unicursal and multicursal patterns. Approximately 6,000 labyrinths have been registered with the Worldwide Labyrinth Locator; these are located around the world in private properties, libraries, schools, gardens, and recreational areas, as well as famous temples and cathedrals.

The labyrinth is also treated in contemporary fine arts. Examples include Piet Mondrian&#x27;s &quot;Pier and Ocean&quot; (1915), Joan Miró&#x27;s &quot;Labyrinth&quot; (1923), Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Minotauromachy&quot; (1935), M. C. Escher&#x27;s &quot;Relativity&quot; (1953), Friedensreich Hundertwasser&#x27;s &quot;Labyrinth&quot; (1957), Jean Dubuffet&#x27;s &quot;Logological Cabinet&quot; (1970), Richard Long&#x27;s &quot;Connemara sculpture&quot; (1971), Joe Tilson&#x27;s &quot;Earth Maze&quot; (1975), Richard Fleischner&#x27;s &quot;Chain Link Maze&quot; (1978), István Orosz&#x27;s &quot;Atlantis Anamorphosis&quot; (2000), Dmitry Rakov&#x27;s &quot;Labyrinth&quot; (2003), and drawings by contemporary American artist Mo Morales employing what the artist calls &quot;Labyrinthine projection.&quot; The Italian painter Davide Tonato has dedicated many of his artistic works to the labyrinth theme. In modern imagery, the labyrinth of Daedalus is often represented by a multicursal maze, in which one may become lost.

Mark Wallinger has created a set of 270 enamel plaques of unicursal labyrinth designs, one for every tube station in the London Underground, to mark the 150th anniversary of the Underground. The plaques were installed over a 16-month period in 2013 and 2014, and each is numbered according to its position in the route taken by the contestants in the 2009 Guinness World Record Tube Challenge.

=== Cultural meanings ===
Prehistoric labyrinths may have served as traps for malevolent spirits or as paths for ritual dances. Many Roman and Christian labyrinths appear at the entrances of buildings, suggesting that they may have served a similar purpose. In their cross-cultural study of signs and symbols, &quot;Patterns that Connect&quot;, Carl Schuster and Edmund Carpenter present various forms of the labyrinth and suggest various possible meanings, including not only a sacred path to the home of a sacred ancestor, but also, perhaps, a representation of the ancestor him/herself: &quot;...many [New World] Indians who make the labyrinth regard it as a sacred symbol, a beneficial ancestor, a deity. In this they may be preserving its original meaning: the ultimate ancestor, here evoked by two continuous lines joining its twelve primary joints.&quot; Schuster also observes the common theme of the labyrinth being a refuge for a trickster; in India, the demon Ravana has dominion over labyrinths, the trickster Djonaha lives in a labyrinth according to Sumatran Bataks, and Europeans say it is the home of a rogue.

One can think of labyrinths as symbolic of pilgrimage: people walking the path ascend toward salvation or enlightenment. Mystical teachings in traditions across centuries suggest that they can also be understood as coded maps of the spiritual path.

Many labyrinths have been constructed recently in churches, hospitals, and parks. These are often used for contemplation; walking among the turnings, one loses track of direction and of the outside world, and thus quiets the mind.

===Christian use===
Labyrinths have on various occasions been used in Christian tradition as a part of worship. The earliest known example is from a fourth-century pavement at the Basilica of St Reparatus, at Orleansville, Algeria, with the words &quot;Sancta Eclesia&quot; at the center, though it is unclear how it might have been used in worship.

In medieval times, labyrinths began to appear on church walls and floors around 1000 AD. The most famous medieval labyrinth, with great influence on later practice, was created in Chartres Cathedral.

The use of labyrinths has recently been revived in some contexts of Christian worship. Many churches in Europe and North America have constructed permanent, typically unicursal, labyrinths, or employ temporary ones (e.g., painted on canvas or outlined with candles). For example, a labyrinth was set up on the floor of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral for a week in March 2000. Some conservative Christians disapprove of labyrinths, considering them pagan practices or &quot;New Age&quot; fads.

=== Usage in media ===

Labyrinths and mazes have been embraced by the video game industry, and countless video games include such a feature. For example, the 1994 video game Marathon features many maze-like passages the player must navigate.

A number of film, game, and music creations feature labyrinths. For instance, the avant-garde multi-screen film &quot;In the Labyrinth&quot; presents a search for meaning in a symbolic modern labyrinth. The well-received 2006 film &quot;Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot; draws heavily upon labyrinth legend for symbolism. A magical labyrinth appears in the third episode, &quot;And The Horns of a Dilemma&quot;, of &quot;The Librarians&quot;. See Labyrinth (disambiguation) for a further list of titles. The cult classic film by Jim Henson Labyrinth (1986 film) features an enormous otherworldly maze which a young woman must traverse to save her younger brother.

The Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges was entranced with the idea of the labyrinth, and used it extensively in his short stories (such as &quot;The House of Asterion&quot; in &quot;The Aleph&quot;). His use of it has inspired other authors (e.g. Umberto Eco&#x27;s &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;, Mark Z. Danielewski&#x27;s &quot;House of Leaves&quot;). Additionally, Roger Zelazny&#x27;s fantasy series &quot;The Chronicles of Amber&quot; features a labyrinth, called &quot;the Pattern,&quot; which grants those who walk it the power to move between parallel worlds. In Rick Riordan&#x27;s series Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians, the events of the fourth novel, &quot;The Battle of the Labyrinth&quot;, predominantly take place within the labyrinth of Daedalus, which has followed the heart of the West to settle beneath the United States. Ursula K. Le Guin used an underground labyrinth in the second book of her Earthsea series, &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot;, in which the series hero Ged is captured by the book&#x27;s protagonist Tenar on his trip to the Kargish Empire – the spiritual power of the &quot;Nameless Ones&quot; is vested at least in part in the labyrinth. Australian author Sara Douglass incorporated some labyrinthine ideas in her series The Troy Game, in which the Labyrinth on Crete is one of several in the ancient world, created with the cities as a source of magical power. Lawrence Durrell&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Labyrinth&quot; depicts travelers trapped underground in Crete. Because a labyrinth can serve as a metaphor for situations that are difficult to be extricated from, Octavio Paz titled his book on Mexican identity &quot;The Labyrinth of Solitude&quot;, describing the Mexican condition as orphaned and lost.

<text>Lyon &amp; Healy Harps, Inc. is an American musical instrument manufacturer based in Chicago, Illinois and is a subsidiary of Salvi Harps, but also has a layered corporate structure. Today best known for concert harps, the company&#x27;s Chicago headquarters and manufacturing facility contains a showroom and concert hall. George W. Lyon and Patrick J. Healy began the company in 1864 as a sheet music shop. By the end of the 19th century, they manufactured a wide range of musical instruments—including not only harps, but pianos, guitars, mandolins, banjos, ukuleles and various brass and other percussion instruments.

Today, Lyon &amp; Healy harps are widely played by professional musicians, since they are one of the few makers of harps for orchestral use—which are known as &quot;concert harps&quot; or &quot;pedal harps&quot;. Lyon &amp; Healy also makes smaller &quot;folk harps&quot; or lever harps (based on traditional Irish and Scottish instruments) that use levers to change string pitch instead of pedals. In the 1980s, Lyon &amp; Healy also began to manufacture electroacoustic harps and, later, solid body electric harps.

==History==
George W. Lyon, a native of Northborough, Massachusetts; and Patrick J. Healy, born in Mallow, Ireland, founded the company in 1864, after they moved from Boston to start a sheet music shop for music publisher Oliver Ditson. Determining Lyon &amp; Healy&#x27;s history is complicated because its building and company records were destroyed in two fires, including the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Two smaller fires did little damage to the firm and did not result in data loss.

Company letters and trade catalogs don&#x27;t provide exact dates that would reveal when Lyon &amp; Healy began manufacturing instruments. An article in the &quot;Musical Courier&quot; states that Lyon &amp; Healy began manufacturing instruments in 1885. Clearly, Lyon &amp; Healy was making fretted string instruments in the 1880s, with Washburn (guitars, mandolins, banjos, and zithers) as their premier line. By the 1900s, if not earlier, Lyon &amp; Healy might well have been manufacturing bowed string instruments.

According to Vintage Guitar magazine, &quot;Circa 1900, the firm was so large it manufactured under a host of sub-brands; Washburn is perhaps the most recognized, though Leland, Lakeside, and American Conservatory are still seen.&quot; 

Lyon &amp; Healy also made various percussion instruments. Later, Lyon &amp; Healy began manufacturing brass instruments, possibly as early as the 1890s. Lyon &amp; Healy also repaired instruments, and offered engraving services. Complicating matters still further, Lyon &amp; Healy engraved instruments that it retailed but did not actually manufacture. In its 1892 catalog, it claimed that it manufactured 100,000 instruments annually.

For a period of time, 1876 to the Great Depression, the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of piano making, the company hand made pianos and reed organs in addition to harps. Like their harps, Lyon &amp; Healy put the highest quality and craftsmanship in building these instruments. In addition to making grand pianos, George W. Lyon patented his cottage upright in 1878. Its top-of-the-line pianos were sold under the Lyon &amp; Healy name. Their pianos have been described as being remarkably powerful, clear, and having a singing tone. Some have compared the Lyon &amp; Healy grand pianos to other high end brands of the time such as Steinway &amp; Sons, Wm. Knabe &amp; Co., and Sohmer. Lower cost pianos were sold by Lyon &amp; Healy under various other brand names. Like most other Golden Age piano companies, they stopped making pianos during the Great Depression.

Lyon retired in 1889 and Healy became the company&#x27;s first president. That year, Lyon &amp; Healy built their first harp. Healy wanted to develop a harp better suited to the rigors of the American climate than available European models. They successfully produced a harp notable for its strength, pitch reliability, and freedom from unwanted vibration. Previously, most harps in North America were made by small groups of craftsmen in France, England, Ireland, or Italy.

In 1890, Lyon &amp; Healy introduced the Style 23 Harp, still a popular and recognizable design. It has 47 strings, highly decorative floral carving on the top of the column, base, and feet, and a fleur de lis pattern at the bottom of the column. It is available in a gold version. It is tall, and weighs about . Lyon &amp; Healy produces one of the most ornate and elaborate harps in the world, the Louis XV, which includes carvings of leaves, flowers, scrolls, and shells along its neck and kneeblock, as well the soundboard edges.

Lyon would later form a new company with E.A. Potter called Lyon &amp; Potter, and remained there until his death on January 12, 1894. Healy died of pneumonia on April 3, 1905.

In the 1890s the company—which used the slogan,&quot;Everything in music&quot;—began building pipe organs. In 1894 Robert J. Bennett came to Lyon &amp; Healy from the Hutchings company of Boston to head their organ department. The largest surviving Lyon &amp; Healy pipe organ is at the Our Lady of Sorrows Basilica in Chicago. It is a large organ of four manuals and 57 ranks of pipes.

They also made small pipe organs. An example survives at St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church in Aspen Colorado. It is a two manual tracker with a 30 note straight pedalboard and 7 ranks. It is believed to have been built around 1900, and can still be pumped by hand.

By the 1900s, Lyon &amp; Healy was one of the largest music publishers in the world, and was a major producer of musical instruments. However, In late 1920s, Lyon &amp; Healy sold its brass musical instrument manufacturing branch (see &quot;New Langwill Index&quot;). In the 1970s, the firm concentrated solely upon making and selling harps.

Carlos Salzedo, the pre-eminent harpist, collaborated with Lyon &amp; Healy on the design of their Art Nouveau model Style 11, still made today. Later, in 1928, Lyon &amp; Healy introduced one of the most unusual harps ever mass-produced, the &quot;Salzedo Model&quot;. It was named for Salzedo, and designed by the artist Witold Gordon. It is an Art Deco style instrument that incorporates bold red and silver stripes on the soundboard, with squared layers of five in the base and column, and instead of the usual curved-edge sounding board, an angular one to combine the features of both the straight-sided sounding board with the expanded sound of the extended sounding board. It&#x27;s design is considered by experts to be a work of fine art, that utilizes light and shadow to give it additional dimension, as well as a distinct appearance.

Lyon &amp; Healy has mostly employed numbers to name its varied models of pedal harps, and they can be confused as sometimes a number, such as 23, was used for more than one model. The current range of models can be viewed on the company website, as well as those of major harp dealers, but in the used harp listings, you may find the older models of differing designs. All are notable for their elegance and attention to detail. There was an additional Washburn line of smaller, simpler pedal harps sold to many schools in the early 20th century. Lyon &amp; Healy&#x27;s Style 23 harp is widely considered the gold standard of tone quality. Each model may differ slightly, as the column design has some effect on the projection of the sound waves generated by the instrument. While the same woods are generally used, each instrument is to some degree individual in sound from its birth, and gains more individuality as it is played. 

In the 1960s, Lyon &amp; Healy introduced a smaller lever harp, the &quot;Troubadour&quot;, a 36-string harp marketed to beginners with rent-to-buy options and group classes. This harp stands , and weighs . Much later, they introduced the Ogden, which is a bit smaller, but has 37 strings, and then the Prelude, which is considerably larger, and styled more like a pedal harp. Between the Troubadour and Ogden models, there was an Egan model, but it was discontinued. 

In the late 1970s, Steinway &amp; Sons (then owned by CBS) purchased Lyon &amp; Healy and soon after closed all retail stores, which sold sheet music and musical instruments, to focus on harp production.

By 1985, Lyon &amp; Healy also made folk harps, also known as &quot;Irish harps&quot;, which are even smaller than the Troubadour. The &quot;Shamrock model folk harp&quot; has 34 strings. It stands tall with its legs. The legs can be removed so the player can hold the instrument lap—style on the knees. It weighs about . It features Celtic designs on the soundboard. An Irish or folk harp player is sometimes called a &quot;harper&quot; rather than &quot;harpist&quot;. 
DePaul University now owns the Wabash building. Lyon &amp; Healy harps are still in Chicago, Illinois, at 168 North Ogden Avenue. The building was once home to the recording studios of Orlando R. Marsh. They are in the process of moving to a new building farther west of the Chicago Loop.

==Craftsmanship==
Wood in harp construction varies by instrument, but Sitka Spruce (Picea sitchensis) is the most common soundboard wood. Various Lyon &amp; Healy guitars, mandolins, and many other instrument types reside in major musical instrument museums in the U.S. and Europe.

Lyon and Healy now primarily manufactures four types of harps—the &quot;lever harp&quot;, &quot;petite pedal harp&quot;, &quot;semi-grande pedal harp&quot;, and &quot;concert grand harp&quot;. They also make limited numbers of &quot;special harps&quot; called &quot;concert grands&quot;. Lyon &amp; Healy makes electric lever harps in nontraditional colors such as pink, green, blue, and red.
