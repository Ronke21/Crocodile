<text>John Hanson ( – November 15, 1783) was an American Founding Father, merchant, and politician from Maryland during the Revolutionary Era. In 1779, Hanson was elected as a delegate to the Continental Congress after serving in a variety of roles for the Patriot cause in Maryland. He signed the Articles of Confederation in 1781 after Maryland joined the other states in ratifying them. In November 1781, following ratification of the articles, he was elected President of the Confederation Congress—a mostly ceremonial and clerical position, sometimes styled &quot;President of the United States in Congress assembled&quot;—by his fellow delegates. 

He was not the first person to hold the office. Samuel Huntington and Thomas McKean had each preceded him under the Articles of Confederation, as had five other men as President of the Continental Congress before ratification. Some Hanson descendants and biographers have falsely claimed that he was actually the first holder of the office of President of the United States, an unrelated executive position created in 1789 by the Constitution of the United States.

==Early life==
Hanson was born in Port Tobacco Parish in Charles County in the Province of Maryland on April 14, 1721. Sources published prior to a 1940 genealogical study sometimes listed his birth date as April 13 or his year of birth as 1715. Hanson was born on a plantation called &quot;Mulberry Grove&quot; into a wealthy and prominent family. The Hanson Family was of English descent. His parents were Samuel (c. 1685–1740) and Elizabeth (Storey) Hanson (c. 1688–1764). Samuel Hanson was a planter who owned more than , and held a variety of political offices, including serving two terms in the Maryland General Assembly.

Hanson&#x27;s grandfather, also named John, came to Charles County, Maryland, as an indentured servant around 1661. In 1876, a writer named George Hanson placed Hanson in his family tree of Swedish-Americans descended from four Swedish brothers who emigrated to New Sweden in 1642. This story was often repeated over the next century, but scholarly research in the late 20th century showed that Hanson was not related to those Swedish-American Hansons.

Little is known about Hanson&#x27;s early life; he was presumably privately tutored as was customary among the wealthy of his time and place. He followed his father&#x27;s path as a planter, slave owner, and public official. He was often referred to as &quot;John Hanson, Jr.&quot;, to distinguish him from an older man of the same name.

==Political career==
Hanson&#x27;s career in public service began in 1750, when he was appointed sheriff of Charles County. In 1757, he was elected to represent Charles County in the lower house of the Maryland General Assembly, where he served for twelve years, sitting on many important committees. Maryland was a proprietary colony, and Hanson aligned himself with the &quot;popular&quot; or &quot;country&quot; party, which opposed any expansion of the power of the proprietary governors at the expense of the popularly elected lower house. He was a leading opponent of the 1765 Stamp Act, chairing the committee that drafted the instructions for Maryland&#x27;s delegates to the Stamp Act Congress. In protest of the Townshend Acts, in 1769 Hanson was one of the signers of a non-importation resolution that boycotted British imports until the acts were repealed.

Hanson changed course in 1769, apparently to better pursue his business interests. He resigned from the General Assembly, sold his land in Charles County, and moved to Frederick County in western Maryland. There he held a variety of offices, including deputy surveyor, sheriff, and county treasurer. When relations between Great Britain and the colonies became a crisis in 1774, Hanson became one of Frederick County&#x27;s leading Patriots. He chaired a town meeting that passed a resolution opposing the Boston Port Act. In 1775, he was a delegate to the Maryland Convention, an extralegal body convened after the colonial assembly had been prorogued. With the other delegates, he signed the Association of Freemen on July 26, 1775, which expressed hope for reconciliation with Great Britain but also called for military resistance to the enforcement of the Coercive Acts.

With hostilities underway, Hanson chaired the Frederick County Committee of Observation, part of the Patriot organization that assumed control of local governance. Responsible for recruiting and arming soldiers, Hanson proved to be an excellent organizer, and Frederick County sent the first southern troops to join George Washington&#x27;s army. Because funds were scarce, Hanson frequently paid soldiers and others with his own money. In June 1776, Hanson chaired the Frederick County meeting that urged provincial leaders in Annapolis to instruct Maryland&#x27;s delegates in the Continental Congress to declare independence from Great Britain. While Congress worked on the Declaration of Independence, Hanson was in Frederick County &quot;making gunlocks, storing powder, guarding prisoners, raising money and troops, dealing with Tories, and doing the myriad other tasks which went with being chairman of the committee of observation&quot;.

Hanson was elected to the newly reformed Maryland House of Delegates in 1777, the first of five annual terms. In December 1779, the House of Delegates named Hanson as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress; he began serving in Congress in Philadelphia in June 1780. &quot;Hanson came to Philadelphia with the reputation of having been the leading financier of the revolution in western Maryland, and soon he was a member of several committees dealing with finance.&quot;

When Hanson was elected to Congress, Maryland was holding up the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. The state, which did not have any claims on western land, refused to ratify the Articles until the other states had ceded their western land claims. When the other states finally did so, the Maryland legislature decided in January 1781 to ratify the Articles. When Congress received notice of this, Hanson joined Daniel Carroll in signing the Articles of Confederation on behalf of Maryland on March 1, 1781. With Maryland&#x27;s endorsement, the Articles officially went into effect. Many years later, some Hanson biographers claimed that Hanson had been instrumental in arranging the compromise and thus securing ratification of the Articles, but according to historian Ralph Levering, there is no documentary evidence of Hanson&#x27;s opinions or actions in resolving the controversy.

In 1782, Hanson proclaimed on behalf of the Continental Congress for a day of &quot;Solemn Thanksgiving&quot;.

===President of Congress===

On November 5, 1781, Congress elected Hanson as its president. Under the Articles of Confederation, both legislative and executive government were vested in the Congress (as it was and still is in Britain); the presidency of Congress was a mostly ceremonial position, but the office did require Hanson to serve as neutral discussion moderator, handle official correspondence, and sign documents. Hanson found the work tedious and considered resigning after just one week, citing his poor health and family responsibilities. Colleagues urged him to remain because Congress at that moment lacked a quorum to choose a successor. Out of a sense of duty, Hanson remained in office, although his term as a delegate to Congress was nearly expired. The Maryland Assembly re-elected him as a delegate on November 28, 1781, and so Hanson continued to serve as president until November 4, 1782.

The Articles of Confederation stipulated that presidents of Congress serve one-year terms, and Hanson became the first to do so. Contrary to the claims of some of his later advocates, however, he was not the first president to serve under the Articles nor the first to be elected under the Articles. When the Articles went into effect in March 1781, Congress did not bother to elect a new president; instead, Samuel Huntington continued serving a term that had already exceeded a year. On July 9, 1781, Samuel Johnston became the first man to be elected as president of Congress after the ratification of the Articles. He declined the office, however, perhaps to make himself available for North Carolina&#x27;s gubernatorial election. After Johnston turned down the office, Thomas McKean was elected. McKean served just a few months, resigning in October 1781 after hearing news of the British surrender at Yorktown. Congress asked him to remain in office until November, when a new session of Congress was scheduled to begin. It was in that session that Hanson began to serve his one-year term. A highlight of Hanson&#x27;s term was when George Washington presented Cornwallis&#x27;s sword to Congress.

==Later life==
Hanson retired from public office after his one-year term as president of Congress. In poor health, he died on November 15, 1783, while visiting Oxon Hill Manor in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, the plantation of his nephew Thomas Hawkins Hanson. He was buried there. Hanson owned at least 223 acres of land and 11 slaves at the time of his death.

==Personal life==
About 1744, he married Jane Contee (1728–1812), daughter of Alexander Contee (1692–1740). They had eight children, including:
* Jane Contee Hanson (1747–1781), who married Philip Thomas (1747–1815)
* Peter Contee Hanson (1748–1776), who died in the battle of Fort Washington during the American Revolutionary War.
* Alexander Contee Hanson Sr. (1749–1806), who was a notable essayist. Alexander Hanson is sometimes confused with his son, Alexander Contee Hanson, Jr. (1786–1819), who became a newspaper editor and U.S. Senator.

==Legacy==

In 1898, Douglas H. Thomas, a descendant of Hanson, wrote a biography promoting Hanson as the first true President of the United States. Thomas became the &quot;driving force&quot; behind the selection of Hanson as one of the two people who would represent Maryland in the National Statuary Hall Collection in Washington, D.C. Hanson was not initially on the shortlist for consideration, but he was chosen after lobbying by the Maryland Historical Society. In 1903, bronze statues of Hanson and Charles Carroll by sculptor Richard E. Brooks were added to Statuary Hall; Hanson&#x27;s is currently located on the 2nd floor of the Senate connecting corridor. Small versions of these two statues (maquettes) sit on the president&#x27;s desk in the Senate Chamber of the Maryland State House.

Some historians have questioned the appropriateness of Hanson&#x27;s selection for the honor of representing Maryland in Statuary Hall. According to historian Gregory Stiverson, Hanson was not one of Maryland&#x27;s foremost leaders of the Revolutionary era. In 1975, historian Ralph Levering said that &quot;Hanson shouldn&#x27;t have been one of the two Marylanders&quot; chosen, but he wrote that Hanson &quot;probably contributed as much as any other Marylander to the success of the American Revolution&quot;. In the 21st century, Maryland lawmakers have considered replacing Hanson&#x27;s statue in Statuary Hall with one of Harriet Tubman.

The idea that Hanson was the forgotten first president of the United States was further promoted in a 1932 biography of Hanson by journalist Seymour Wemyss Smith. Smith&#x27;s book asserts that the American Revolution had two primary leaders: George Washington on the battlefield and John Hanson in politics. Smith&#x27;s book, like Douglas H. Thomas&#x27;s 1898 book, was one of a number of biographies written seeking to promote Hanson as the &quot;first President of the United States&quot;. Regarding the opinion, historian Ralph Levering stated: &quot;They&#x27;re not biographies by professional historians; they aren&#x27;t based on research into primary sources.&quot; According to historian Richard B. Morris, if a president of Congress were to be called the &quot;first&quot; president of the United States, &quot;a stronger case could be made for Peyton Randolph of Virginia, the first president of the first and second Continental Congresses, or for John Hancock, the president of Congress when that body declared its independence.&quot; The claim that Hanson was a forgotten president of the United States was revived on the Internet, sometimes with a new assertion that he was actually a black man; an anachronistic photograph of Senator John Hanson of Liberia has been used to support this claim.

In 1972, Hanson was depicted on a 6-cent U.S. postal card, which featured his name and portrait next to the word &quot;Patriot&quot;. Historian Irving Brant criticized the selection of Hanson for the card, arguing that it was a result of the &quot;old hoax&quot; promoting Hanson as the first president of the United States. In 1981, Hanson was featured on a 20-cent U.S. postage stamp. U.S. Route 50 between Washington, D.C., and Annapolis is named the John Hanson Highway in his honor. There are also middle schools located in Oxon Hill, Maryland, and Waldorf, Maryland, named after him. A former savings bank named for him was merged in the 1990s with Industrial Bank of Washington, D.C.

In the 1970s, a descendant of Hanson, John Hanson Briscoe, served as Speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates, which passed &quot;a measure establishing April 14 as John Hanson Day.&quot; In 2009, the John Hanson Memorial Association was incorporated in Frederick, Maryland, to create the John Hanson National Memorial and to educate Americans about Hanson as well as to educate people about the many myths written about him.

<doc id="16379" wikidata="Q51724" url="?curid=16379" title="Jedi">
<text>Jedi (), Jedi Knights, or collectively the Jedi Order are fictional characters, and are the main protagonists of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, although they are not always in the forefront. Working symbiotically alongside the Old Galactic Republic, the Jedi Order is depicted as a religious, academic, meritocratic, and military-auxiliary (peacekeeping) organization whose origin dates back thousands of years before the events of the first film released in the franchise. The fictional organization has inspired a real-world new religious movement and parody religion: Jediism. The word Jedi is often used as an answer when anyone is asked which religion they are, when they don&#x27;t have one, when they could simply write down Not Applicable.

Within the &quot;Star Wars&quot; galaxy, the Jedi are powerful guardians of order and justice, who, through intuition, rigorous training, and intensive self-discipline, are able to wield a supernatural power known as the Force, thus achieving the ability to move objects with the mind, perform incredible feats of strength, and connect to certain people&#x27;s thoughts. As &quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas explains, the Jedi are &quot;warrior-monks who keep peace in the universe&quot;, avoiding the use of violence except as a last resort, with a mission to &quot;use their power to keep the governments of all the planets in line, so that they don&#x27;t do terrible things&quot;. The Jedi have the &quot;moral authority to do that&quot; since they are &quot;the most moral of anybody in the galaxy&quot;. Throughout the franchise, Jedi are often recognizable by their robes and tunics in various shades of brown and their use of lightsabers: sword-like weapons with a colorful blade made of plasma.

Along with New Age elements, Lucas developed the Jedi creed by adopting certain elements from Eastern religions—namely Buddhism and potentially Taoism. In that same vein, the Jedi creed focuses on compassion for others, mindfulness, non-attachment, and meditation, which are all characteristics of what Jedi characters call the &quot;light side&quot; of the Force. Furthermore, the Jedi view fear to be the root of suffering: fear leading to anger, anger leading to hate, and hate leading to suffering. The Jedi warn that an excess of these negative emotions can turn practitioners away from the light side of the Force towards the dark side, which embraces passions, aggression, hate, rage, fear, and bitterness as a way of life. The Sith are followers of the dark side and the traditional enemies of the Jedi. While the Sith ultimately seek violent and absolute rule over the galaxy, the Jedi work to protect democracy, harmony, and justice.

The Jedi are depicted, in the franchise&#x27;s Old Republic era, as a monastic organization well-trained in the martial arts, who cooperate intimately with the galactic government and work towards bringing &quot;peace into the galaxy by being ambassadors and troubleshooters&quot;, according to Lucas. Jedi characters investigate certain crimes ranging from high-profile murder to political corruption, act as diplomats between powerful interplanetary groups, protect the highest government officials of the Republic, track down fugitives, and are promoted as leaders in the Republic&#x27;s army during the Clone Wars. Still, their creed demands that they defend and protect all life and use their power only for knowledge and defense. With the rise of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and the Galactic Empire, the Jedi Order is outlawed and most of its members killed in the ensuing political purge. Later efforts are made to revive the organization.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Jedi&quot; is said to have been adapted by George Lucas from Japanese 時代劇 (jidaigeki) (meaning &#x27;period drama&#x27; motion pictures about samurai), or perhaps inspired by the words &quot;Jed&quot; (Leader) and &quot;Jeddak&quot; (King) in the series by , a series that Lucas considered adapting to film.

According to the &quot;Star Wars: Rogue One – The Ultimate Visual Guide&quot;, &quot;Jedi&quot; in-universe is derived from &quot;Jedha,&quot; a planet that was once home to a Jedi temple and was a source of kyber crystals. Kyber crystals are used to power lightsabers and were considered sacred by the Jedi Order.

In his book &quot;The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film&quot;, J.W. Rinzler notes that Lucas originally considered using the term &quot;Jedidiah&quot; for his knights, but ultimately settled on &quot;jedi.&quot; Rinzler also suggests that the word may have been influenced by the term &quot;bodhisattva,&quot; which refers to a Buddhist concept of an enlightened being who chooses to remain in the world to help others.

Another potential influence on the word &quot;jedi&quot; is the Hebrew term &quot;yedid,&quot; which means &quot;beloved.&quot; In his book &quot;The Secret History of Star Wars&quot;, Michael Kaminski suggests that Lucas may have been influenced by this term when creating the name for his knights. Kaminski notes that Lucas has cited Jewish mysticism as an inspiration for his work, and that he may have been drawn to the idea of his heroes being beloved protectors.

===Influences===
George Lucas acknowledged that the Jedi, Sith, and other Force concepts have been inspired by many sources. These include: knighthood, chivalry, paladinism, samurai bushido, Shaolin Monastery, Feudalism, Hinduism, Qigong, Greek philosophy and mythology, Roman history and mythology, Sufism, Confucianism, Shintō, Buddhism and Taoism, and numerous cinematic precursors. The works of philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche and mythologist Joseph Campbell, especially his book &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; (1949), directly influenced Lucas, and was what drove him to create the &#x27;modern myth&#x27; of &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

Lucas explained that the Jedi are trained, allowed and expected to love people (even their enemies, the Sith), but they are not to form attachments because attachment leads to the dark side of the Force. When one has, gets or wants a person or experience and attaches to them, one becomes afraid to lose them. The fear of loss feeds into greed, wanting to keep things, thus, an attached person is selfish and unable to let go. The fear of loss turns into anger, which will lead to hate, and hate will lead into suffering, mostly on the part of the one who is selfish, because then one will spend their lives being afraid rather than actually living. The light side is focused on compassion and giving; thus it is love, and the opposite of attachment – it is everlasting joy, devoid of fear of loss and the pain of loss. &quot;As long as you love other people and treat them kindly, you won&#x27;t be afraid&quot;.

Lucas, identifying himself as &quot;Buddhist Methodist&quot; or &quot;Methodist Buddhist&quot; stated that his philosophy of non-attachment, depicted in his movies was influenced by the fact that he was from San Francisco, the &quot;Zen Buddhism capital of the United States&quot;. In 2020, he indicated that the Jedi were &quot;designed to be a Buddhist monk who happened to be very good at fighting&quot;.

==Depiction==
As depicted in the canon, the Jedi study and utilize the Force in order to help and protect those in need. The Jedi members, known as Jedi Knights, respect all life by defending and protecting those who cannot do it for themselves, striving for peaceful and non-combative solutions to any altercations they encounter and fighting only in self-defense and for the defense of those they protect. By training the mind and the body, the Jedi seek to improve themselves by gaining unfettered access to the Force while also seeking to improve those individuals and groups they come in contact with. Like their evil counterparts, the Sith, the main weapon of the Jedi is the lightsaber. However, according to Lucas, &quot;The Force really doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the lightsaber. Anybody can have a lightsaber. It&#x27;s just a weapon like a pistol&quot;.

Qui-Gon Jinn gives an insight into the Force in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; when he tells Anakin: &quot;Your focus determines your reality&quot;. And later, he explains: &quot;Midi-chlorians are microscopic lifeforms that reside within all of your cells. And we are symbionts with them. Lifeforms living together for mutual advantage. Without the midi-chlorians, life could not exist and we would have no knowledge of the Force. They continually speak to us, telling us the will of The Force. When you learn to quiet your mind you&#x27;ll hear them speaking to you&quot;. In &quot;A New Hope&quot;, Obi-Wan Kenobi tells Luke Skywalker: &quot;The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It&#x27;s an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us, penetrates us, it binds the galaxy together.&quot; &quot;. . . a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. It [partially] controls your actions, but it also obeys your commands&quot;.

===The Skywalker Saga===
====Prequel trilogy====


The prequel trilogy depicts the Jedi in their prime, headquartered at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, and dealing with the rising presence of the dark side of the Force and the return of the Sith. In &quot;Episode I: The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999), Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) discovers nine-year-old Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), whom he believes to be the &quot;Chosen One&quot; of a Jedi prophecy, destined to bring balance to the Force. At the end of &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, following Qui-Gon&#x27;s death at the hands of Darth Maul, Anakin is paired with his apprentice, the young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), who promises to train him.

The sequel, &quot;Episode II: Attack of the Clones&quot;, establishes that the Jedi forswear attachments, being in the same category of possession and striving to cultivate compassion, unconditional love instead. As revealed in the &quot;Clone Wars&quot; series, the Jedi believed romantic feelings are natural and as such, they did not prohibit them, but for a Jedi Knight, it was essential to make the right choice for the Order and not neglect their Jedi duties in the favor of their beloved, even if that would mean the end of the relationship. This proves problematic when Anakin, now a young adult (Hayden Christensen), falls in love with Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman). The Clone Wars, first spoken of in the original 1977 film, begin with hundreds of Jedi participating in the battle of Geonosis.
In &quot;Episode III: Revenge of the Sith&quot;, Yoda confides to Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) that the prophecy of the Chosen One could have been misread. Sheev Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who is revealed to be Darth Sidious, manipulates Anakin&#x27;s attachment for Padmé and distrust and resentment of the Jedi in order to turn him to the dark side and become his Sith apprentice, Darth Vader. Betraying the Jedi and becoming a Sith, Vader begins helping Sidious hunt down and destroy the Jedi, who are nearly exterminated during the events of &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;; Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, and Ahsoka Tano are among a handful of Jedi that avoided the initial purge.

As revealed in the &quot;Clone Wars&quot; series, each of the clones were implanted with chips that Palpatine would activate with the command Order 66: &quot;Operation Knightfall&quot;. This resulted in the clone troopers being forcibly brainwashed into viewing their Jedi generals as traitors to the Republic and subsequently executing them. Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker led the 501st Legion to carry out &quot;Operation Knightfall&quot; against the Jedi Temple, burning and slaughtering all Jedi within, including Temple-Defender Shaak Ti. Sidious deceived the people of the Republic that the Jedi were corrupted warmongers responsible for prolonging the Clone Wars, labeling them criminals with bounties placed on them. Darth Vader continued to hunt and kill nearly every surviving Jedi during the early years of the Empire, in what became known as the Great Jedi Purge.

====Original trilogy====


The Jedi are first introduced in the 1977 motion picture &quot;Star Wars&quot; as an order of warrior monks who serve as &quot;the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy&quot; and embrace the mystical Force. Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) explains that the Galactic Empire has all but exterminated the Jedi, and seeks to train Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to be the Jedi Order&#x27;s last hope. Darth Vader (David Prowse/James Earl Jones) is also established as the Jedi&#x27;s main enemy. By the end of the film, which depicts the battle of Yavin, Luke is on the path to becoming a Jedi. In the sequel, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, Luke receives Jedi training from the elderly (and only surviving) Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz), even as he learns that Vader is, in fact, his father, former Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker. The third film in the original trilogy, &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, ends with Luke redeeming Vader—who kills Darth Sidious to save him, thus bringing balance to the Force—and helping destroy the Empire, thus fulfilling his destiny as a Jedi.

The two last Jedi Masters die during the events of the films, after which they return as Force spirits to help Luke.

====Sequel trilogy====


In &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, the first film in the sequel trilogy, it is revealed that Luke had attempted to rebuild the Jedi Order, but failed when his nephew Ben Solo (Adam Driver) fell to the dark side, lured by the mysterious Snoke (Andy Serkis). Ben is renamed Kylo Ren and destroys all that Luke built. After Kylo&#x27;s fall and the destruction of the New Jedi Order, Luke goes into a self-imposed exile on Ahch-To, believing himself and the Jedi to be a negative influence on the galaxy.

In the sequel &quot;The Last Jedi&quot;, the scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley) discovers Luke on Ahch-To and convinces him to train her in the ways of the Force. During her training, Luke explains that the past Jedi allowed Darth Sidious to rise to power. She also discovers several ancient Jedi texts hidden away in a tree. Rey learns the truth about Ben&#x27;s fall to the dark side and believes herself to be his only chance of redemption. Luke decides to stay on Ahch-To and attempts to burn down the tree with the texts, but cannot bring himself to do so. However, Yoda appears as a Force spirit and burns the tree, teaching him that failure is just as important as success, and those masters are defined by those who surpass them. Near the end of the film, Luke confronts Kylo on the planet Crait. It is subsequently revealed that Luke had been projecting himself from Ahch-To; he dies from the effort and becomes one with the Force. Rey is shown to have taken the sacred Jedi texts before she left Ahch-To, in order to continue her training.

In &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, the final film of the sequel trilogy, it is discovered that Darth Sidious created Snoke and has returned from death and has been secretly manipulating events from the Sith world Exegol. In his last attempt to reclaim the galaxy, Sidious unveils the Final Order, a massive fleet of &quot;Xyston&quot;-class Star Destroyers built by the Sith Eternal. The Emperor offers the Sith fleet to Kylo Ren in exchange for killing the last remaining Jedi, Rey, who is revealed to be his granddaughter. After the death of Kylo&#x27;s mother, Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), Kylo returns to the light and reclaims his identity as Ben Solo. At the end of the film, Ben joins Rey as she confronts Sidious. Rey channels the power of the past Jedi to destroy Sidious and the Sith—thus bringing balance back to the Force—before dying herself. Ben sacrifices his life to revive Rey and becomes one with the Force. With peace and justice restored to the galaxy, Rey lives on to start the Jedi Order again.

===Anthologies and derivative works===
In a deleted scene from &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, the &quot;Lost Twenty&quot; is the name given to a group of Jedi Masters—numbering twenty in total—who left the Jedi Order throughout its history. The first 12 of this Lost Twenty became &quot;Dark Jedi&quot; who eventually founded the first Sith Empire. In the years preceding the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Dooku left the Jedi Order as a result of differences with his fellow Jedi, becoming the 20th Jedi Master in the history of the Order to do so. To showcase the failures of the Jedi they created statues of the fallen Jedi and placed them in the Jedi Temple Archives.

The animated television series &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; depicts the battles of the Clone Wars, focusing on the Jedi and clone troopers they lead against the Separatists and its Sith leaders. The feature-film pilot reveals that Anakin trained an apprentice, Ahsoka Tano, between &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; and &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;. Later arcs explore the foundations of Order 66 and Darth Sidious&#x27; manipulation of the Jedi Order.

The animated television series &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; reveals that Ahsoka and a Jedi named Kanan Jarrus survived the purge; the latter trains a new apprentice, Ezra Bridger. The series also reveals that, following the start of the purge with Order 66, Sidious commissioned the Inquisitorius, a group of former Jedi who had turned to the dark side for various reasons, to aid Darth Vader in hunting down the remaining Jedi.

The &quot;Clone Wars&quot; spinoff series &quot;Star Wars: The Bad Batch&quot; follows the titular group of enhanced clones, who disobey Order 66 and instead choose to save a younger Kanan after his master is killed by the other clones.

The canon video game &quot;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order&quot; introduces Cal Kestis, a former Padawan hiding from the Empire who accidentally exposes his Force abilities to aid someone, putting him on the Inquisitors&#x27; radar. Kestis gets aid from Cere Junda, another Jedi Knight in hiding. In the 2023 sequel, &quot;Star Wars Jedi: Survivor&quot;, it is revealed that mercenary Bode Akuna was also a survivor of Order 66.

In the limited series &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot;, the Great Jedi Purge is depicted in a flashback in which Reva Sevander, future Inquisitor called Third Sister, escapes from the clones during the night of Order 66.

===Members===
The exact size of the pre-purge Jedi&#x27;s membership and operations are never specified. However, in the &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; episode &quot;Path of the Jedi&quot;, Kanan Jarrus stated: 

==== Yoda ====

Yoda was a wise, experienced, and powerful Grand Master of the Jedi of an unknown species and the oldest known prophet in existence (having lived at least 900 years), considered the wisest and most powerful Jedi Master within the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe.

==== Mace Windu ====

Mace Windu was a human Jedi Master of the Order and one of the last members of the Order&#x27;s upper echelons before the fall of the Galactic Republic.

==== Plo Koon ====

Plo Koon was a Kel Dor Jedi Master who served as a General during the Clone Wars and a member of the Jedi Council. Koon led the 442nd Siege Battalion in the Battle of Cato Neimoidia, in which he was shot down by his own troops upon the occurrence of Order 66.

==== Kit Fisto ====

Kit Fisto was a Nautolan Jedi Master, who served as a member of the Jedi Order during the Clone Wars. During the attempted arrest of Chancellor Palpatine, Fisto was killed by the Sith Lord in a duel, leaving Mace Windu to face the Chancellor alone.

==== Count Dooku ====

Count Dooku was a human Jedi Master who was trained by Yoda and mentored Qui-Gon Jinn, who later fell to the dark side and became the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus. He is one of the main antagonists of the prequel trilogy. He led the war against the Jedi and the Republic until his demise aboard General Grievous&#x27; ship in the Battle of Coruscant at the hands of Anakin Skywalker.

==== Qui-Gon Jinn ====

Qui-Gon Jinn was a wise and powerful human Jedi Master, who was trained by Count Dooku and mentored Obi-Wan Kenobi. Unlike other, more conservative Jedi, he valued living in the moment as the best way to embrace the Force. While other Jedi respected him highly, they were frequently puzzled by his beliefs. He refused to take a seat on the Jedi Council, despite him being among the wisest and most powerful of the Jedi. Jinn was both the Jedi to discover the Sith&#x27;s return after a millennium, upon being attacked by Darth Maul during a mission to protect Queen Padmé Amidala of Naboo, and the one to find the ability to become a Force spirit after death, though he wasn&#x27;t capable of having a physical body. Following his death at Darth Maul&#x27;s hands, Jinn guided both Yoda and Obi-Wan to the ability to become a physical Force spirit after death. Within the Disney+ TV series, &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot;, Qui-Gon Jinn appears as a force spirit following Darth Vader&#x27;s defeat to Obi-Wan Kenobi in a duel. He communes with Kenobi before returning to the Force. In &quot;Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, he appears as a disembodied voice alongside other past Jedi, empowering Rey to face a rejuvenated Darth Sidious.

==== Obi-Wan Kenobi ====

Obi-Wan Kenobi was a human Jedi Master who trained Anakin Skywalker, at the behest of his deceased master Qui-Gon Jinn, and later Anakin&#x27;s son Luke Skywalker, making him one of the main characters in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. Having fought in the Clone Wars, Obi-Wan proved himself an adept strategist, duelist, and spy, as his leadership style heavily favours subterfuge and misdirection while commanding clone troopers, or wielding the Force. Due to his charisma and persuasion skills, he became known as &#x27;The Negotiator&#x27; during the Clone Wars. Obi-Wan best exemplifies the Jedi Code: in spite of Darth Vader&#x27;s betrayal and his master (Qui-Gon Jinn) being killed by his nemesis, Darth Maul, he never fell into darkness. As one of the few survivors of Order 66 following the Galactic Republic&#x27;s transformation into the Galactic Empire, Obi-Wan hid on the desert planet Tatooine, watching over Anakin&#x27;s son Luke, knowing that he would one day grow to become a Jedi and defeat Vader. In &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot;, while Obi-Wan hid on Tatooine, Senator Bail Organa&#x27;s daughter, Leia Organa, was captured upon the request of the Third Sister. Obi-Wan was sent to rescue the ten-year old Princess, and, after retrieving Leia on the planet Daiyu, was forced to duel his former apprentice Darth Vader on the planet Mapuzo, before escaping. Leia Organa, who was imprisoned by the Third Sister on the planet Nur, is saved by Obi-Wan Kenobi a second time before the two escape to the planet Jabiim with aid from the Path. Vader and Kenobi duel once more following Obi-Wan&#x27;s attempted escape from the planet and Kenobi defeats his former apprentice, allowing Leia to return to her parents. Following this event, Qui-Gon Jinn appears before Kenobi as a force spirit, after years of failed attempts by Obi-Wan to communicate with the deceased Jedi Master. Obi-Wan mentored Luke Skywalker in the Jedi arts, before meeting his demise at the hands of his former apprentice aboard the Death Star, though he continued guiding Luke as a Force spirit. In &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;, Obi-Wan&#x27;s voice can briefly be heard just after Rey&#x27;s force vision when she came into contact with Anakin&#x27;s lightsaber. In &quot;Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, Obi-Wan appears as a disembodied voice alongside other past Jedi, empowering Rey to face a rejuvenated Darth Sidious.

==== Anakin Skywalker ====

Anakin Skywalker was a human Jedi Knight, one of the main protagonists of the prequel trilogy, and the central antagonist of the original trilogy. He is the Chosen One, being born of the Force. He was apprenticed to Obi-Wan Kenobi and proved to be a very gifted duelist and Force user and despite being appointed to the Jedi High Council at the age of 22, he was not given the rank of Master. He secretly married Padmé Amidala at the onset of the Clone Wars and has two children, Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa. He was eventually seduced to the dark side by the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious, and became the Sith Lord Darth Vader, serving the Galactic Empire. While he was a member of the Jedi Council, he trained a Padawan of his own, Ahsoka Tano during the Clone Wars. Vader was eventually redeemed by his son in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; and gave his own life to save Luke, killing Sidious and bringing balance to the Force, thus fulfilling the prophecy of the Chosen One. In &quot;Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, Anakin appears as a disembodied voice alongside other past Jedi, empowering Rey to face a rejuvenated Sidious.

====Ahsoka Tano====

Ahsoka Tano is a Togruta Jedi Padawan discovered on her homeworld of Shili by Jedi Master Plo Koon. Plo brought her to Coruscant to train as a Jedi. She eventually became the Padawan learner of Anakin Skywalker during the Clone Wars. Among many campaigns, Ahsoka found herself advising rebels on the planet Onderon, including Steela and Saw Gerrera, in their fight against the Confederacy. These rebels would eventually form part of the basis of the Alliance for the Restoration of the Republic, a relationship that would later prove beneficial to her. She was accused of bombing the hangar at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant before clearing her name with Anakin&#x27;s help. However, the Jedi Council&#x27;s response during the ordeal soured her faith in the Order, and she left the Order to forge her own path in the galaxy. She briefly returned in the service of the Republic during the final days of the Clone Wars, when she led part of the 501st Clone Legion in the siege of Mandalore to capture the Sith Lord Darth Maul, who attempted to warn her that Anakin would soon fall to the dark side. Shortly after capturing Maul, Ahsoka was betrayed by her clone troopers as part of Order 66, but she managed to escape alongside Clone Captain Rex (whose control chip she removed). Years later, Ahsoka served the nascent Rebel Alliance as the spymaster and head of its intelligence network, directing operations behind the codename Fulcrum. After the Galactic Civil War, she began searching for Ezra Bridger and Grand Admiral Thrawn, who had gone missing in the Unknown Regions. Ahsoka is one of the few Jedi to survive past the Imperial era and into the New Republic era. After the fall of the Empire, Ahsoka took on Sabine Wren as her apprentice. In &quot;Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, Ahsoka appears as only a voice alongside other past Jedi, empowering Rey to face a rejuvenated Darth Sidious.

====Cal Kestis====

Cal Kestis was a human Jedi Padawan and the main protagonist of &quot;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order&quot;. Trained by Jaro Tapal, Cal witnessed his master&#x27;s death during Order 66, which he himself barely managed to survive. During the Imperial era, he lived on Bracca, working as a scrapyard rigger and hiding his Force powers. While scrapping a freighter, an accident forced Cal to reveal his Force abilities to save a co-worker, exposing him to the Empire, who dispatched two Inquisitors to hunt him down. On the run, Cal was rescued by Cere Junda, a Jedi Knight also in hiding, and worked with her and other allies to find a Jedi Holocron containing a list of Force-sensitive children, which could be used to rebuild the Jedi Order. Once their mission was completed, Cal decided to destroy the Holocron, believing it to be better for those children to discover their own destinies.

====Kanan Jarrus====

Kanan Jarrus (born Caleb Dume) was a human Jedi Padawan who fought for the Rebellion during its formation. First introduced as a main character of the animated television series &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;, Jarrus was known to be the leader of a small rebel cell called the Spectres, operating on the planet Lothal. As a survivor of Order 66, Jarrus was forced to break certain Jedi traditions to avoid being detected by Imperial forces that continued their mission to eliminate any Jedi on sight, such as eschewing traditional Jedi robes or occasionally using a blaster, a weapon typically shunned by Jedi. Although he lost his master Depa Billaba to Order 66 before he could ascend the ranks of the Jedi Order, he was tasked with training the young Force-sensitive Ezra Bridger throughout his eventual service to the larger Rebellion. Ultimately, Jarrus died to save his friends, in particular Hera Syndulla, who would later give birth to her and Jarrus&#x27; son, Jacen Syndulla. In &quot;Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, he appears as a disembodied voice alongside other past Jedi, empowering Rey to face a rejuvenated Darth Sidious.

====Ezra Bridger====

Ezra Bridger is a human Jedi Padawan who was born on the planet Lothal on the same day the Galactic Empire was established. He witnessed many injustices of the Imperial occupation of his homeworld for much of his childhood and was separated from his parents from a very early age. He was able to survive alone using street smarts and skills but was discovered by Kanan Jarrus to have potential Force sensitivity after he encounters the Spectres for the first time. After discovering how much of a team player he could be during a rescue operation, they recruited Bridger, who began training him in the ways of the Jedi under Jarrus, himself still a Jedi Padawan. Bridger took a long time learning how to wield a lightsaber and use it to deflect blaster bolts, modifying his first one to fire stun blasts in the interim. He was not well skilled in lightsaber duels against Inquisitors and Darth Vader, but later discovered his unique ability to use the Force to control and command animals, a skill that proved more useful several times during his service in the Rebellion. Bridger later went missing in action during the battle to liberate Lothal from Imperial occupation, where he successfully defeated Grand Admiral Thrawn, regarded by many as the Empire&#x27;s best tactician.

==== Luke Skywalker ====

Luke Skywalker was a human Jedi Knight (later Master) and the protagonist of the original trilogy. As the last Padawan of Obi-Wan Kenobi, he became an important figure in the Rebel Alliance&#x27;s struggle against the Galactic Empire. Luke was heir to a family deeply rooted in the Force, being the twin brother of Rebellion leader Princess Leia Organa of the planet Alderaan, the son of former Queen of Naboo and Republic Senator Padmé Amidala and Jedi turned Sith Lord Darth Vader (Anakin Skywalker), and the maternal uncle of Ben Solo. After redeeming his father from the dark side of the Force, who died killing his master and the last Sith, Darth Sidious, in order to save Luke, he set out to train a new generation of Jedi to rebuild the Order, only to have them wiped out by Supreme Leader Snoke, a puppet created by a revived Sidious, who also turned Ben to the dark side, adopting the Kylo Ren persona. Skywalker then spent the rest of his life in exile on Ahch-To, the original headquarters of the Jedi Order, blaming himself for Ben&#x27;s turn and the destruction of his Order, until he was found by Rey, the Last Jedi and the secret granddaughter of Sidious, whom he reluctantly trained in the Jedi arts. Shortly after, he gave his life to distract Kylo Ren, now Supreme Leader of the First Order, on the planet Crait via a Force Projection, allowing the Resistance to escape. When Rey learned of her lineage and exiled herself on Ahch-To out of fear of turning to the dark side, Luke appeared before her as a Force spirit and encouraged her to face the Emperor. Along with the spirits of other past Jedi, he then empowered Rey during her final confrontation with Sidious, which marked the definitive defeat of the Sith. Later, he and Leia gave Rey their blessings to adopt the Skywalker surname and continue their family&#x27;s legacy.

==== Leia Organa ====

Leia Organa was the daughter of Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala, the twin sister of Luke Skywalker, and one of the main characters of the original and sequel trilogies. While Force-sensitive, she didn&#x27;t become aware of her connection to the Force or her lineage until much later in life, instead focusing on a career as a senator and, secretly, a leader of the Rebel Alliance. As seen in &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, Leia began training as a Jedi under her brother shortly after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, but quit her training when she had a vision that it would result in the death of her yet to be born son. Decades later, while leading the Resistance against the First Order, Leia also briefly mentored Rey in the ways of the Force, despite her limited knowledge about it. Ultimately, Leia gave her life to redeem her son, Ben Solo, who had turned to the dark side, and became one with the Force. Later, she and Luke gave Rey their blessings to adopt the Skywalker surname and continue their family&#x27;s legacy.

==== Grogu ====

Grogu was a Jedi Initiate of the same species as Yoda who first appeared in &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;. Raised at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant during the Clone Wars, he was rescued by Jedi Master Kelleran Beq during the Great Jedi Purge and hidden for his own safety. Decades later, the 50-year-old but still toddler Grogu was sought by a remnant of the Galactic Empire due to his connection to the Force, but was found and adopted by the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin, who sought to reunite him with the Jedi. When Grogu was eventually captured by Moff Gideon&#x27;s Imperial remnant, Djarin mounted a rescue, which would have been unsuccessful if not for the arrival of Luke Skywalker (whom Grogu had previously contacted through the Force). With Djarin&#x27;s approval, Luke took Grogu with him so that the child could be trained as a Jedi. Though Grogu briefly trained with Luke, he showed signs of not being fully committed to the Jedi path and wishing to be with Djarin instead, causing Luke to doubt his abilities as a teacher, as seen in &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot;. After speaking with Ahsoka Tano, Luke decided to let Grogu choose his own destiny, and the youngling ultimately returned to Djarin as his Mandalorian foundling.

==== Ben Solo ====

Ben Solo was a human Jedi Padawan and the central antagonist of the sequel trilogy. He was the son of smuggler and Rebel Alliance General Han Solo and Rebellion leader Princess Leia Organa, and the nephew of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, having been born shortly after the Galactic Empire&#x27;s defeat. As part of his uncle&#x27;s new generation of Jedi, Ben trained under him, but was eventually seduced to the dark side by Supreme Leader Snoke, a puppet created by a revived Darth Sidious, the last Sith, and sought to become a Sith Lord, as powerful as his late maternal grandfather, Darth Vader (Anakin Skywalker). Following the destruction of Luke&#x27;s New Jedi Order, Ben adopted the Kylo Ren persona and became a warlord of the First Order, as well as the leader of the Knights of Ren, an organization of fellow Force-wielders. He later killed his father when he unsuccessfully tried to redeem him and formed a unique connection with Rey, the last Jedi and Sidious&#x27; secret granddaughter, called a &quot;dyad in the Force&quot;. After killing Snoke, Kylo took over as Supreme Leader of the First Order, until ultimately being redeemed by his mother and Rey, and helping Rey face Sidious, giving his own life to save hers.

==== Rey Skywalker ====

Rey was a human Jedi Padawan and the protagonist of the sequel trilogy. She is the paternal granddaughter of Sheev Palpatine (Darth Sidious), the last surviving Sith Lord, and was born in the years following the Galactic Empire&#x27;s defeat. Abandoned on the desert planet of Jakku at a young age by her parents in order to keep her safe, she became involved in the conflict between the Resistance and the First Order, and formed a unique connection with Kylo Ren, called a &quot;dyad in the Force&quot;. She was briefly trained by Luke Skywalker and, following his death, continued her Jedi training under the guidance of his sister and Resistance leader Leia Organa, as well as the ancient Jedi texts. Rey eventually learned of her lineage and, with the help of a redeemed Kylo Ren and the spirits of past Jedi, faced a revived Sidious, finally killing him and ending the Sith once and for all, thus bringing balance back to the Force.

===Force-sensitive organizations===
Not every &quot;dark side&quot;-user is a Sith; nor is every &quot;light side&quot;-user a Jedi. Within the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe, people of all species have demonstrated varying &quot;force-sensitive&quot; powers and abilities. These &quot;force-wielders&quot; are often depicted with little to no formal Jedi training in the Force, originating from primitive planets.

====The Sith Organization====
=====Dark side adept=====
A dark side adept is someone with the power to use the dark side of the Force outside of the traditions of the Jedi or the Sith. They were often steeped in the lore of the dark side and opposed to those who used the light side, such as Jedi. While all Sith were technically dark side adepts, non-Sith individuals such as Asajj Ventress, Kylo Ren, and the Grand Inquisitor were also considered dark side adepts. Dark side adepts were referenced in passing in James Luceno&#x27;s canon novel &quot;Tarkin&quot;.

====Force-wielders without affiliation====
The Bendu, introduced in the &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; Season 3 episode &quot;Steps into Shadow&quot;, is a Force-sensitive individual who resided on the remote planet of Atollon and represents the &quot;center&quot; of the Force, between the light side and the dark side. When he is first met by Kanan Jarrus, he states that &quot;Jedi and Sith wield the &quot;Ashla&quot; and &quot;Bogan&quot;. The light and the dark. I&#x27;m the one in the middle. The Bendu...&quot;. He is depicted as one who seeks balance, and has been likened to Tom Bombadil of &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; The term &quot;Bendu&quot; first appeared in the original script for &quot;Star Wars&quot; as the name of the Jedi Knights, the &quot;Jedi-Bendu&quot;.

==Description==
===The Jedi Code===
The Jedi Code was a set of rules that governed the behavior of the Jedi Order. It taught its followers to not give in to feelings of anger toward other lifeforms, which would help them resist fear and prevent them from falling to the dark side of the Force.&lt;br&gt;
===The Four Councils===
The Four Branches of the Jedi Council are fictional institutions from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe. They serve the Jedi Order as an organized administrative body that provides the necessary auxiliary and support services that sustain and governed the Order&#x27;s academies, temples, interests and organizations.

====Jedi High Council====
The Jedi High Council is the main ecclesiastical leadership of the Jedi Order with both legislative and executive powers. The Jedi High Council is made up of some of the strongest, wisest and most experienced members of the Jedi Order. They are elected to lead the Jedi. The Jedi High Council has twelve members at any given time: five members who serve for life, four members who serve long-term, and three limited-term members. Sifo-Dyas had a seat on the council until his extremist views on a war that he foresaw caused his removal. Other older members include Jor Aerith, Tera Sinuba, and Yula Braylon.

In &quot;Jedi: Fallen Order - Dark Temple&quot; (which is set an unknown amount of time before &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;), the Jedi Council includes Yoda, Mace Windu, Eeth Koth, Yarael Poof, Poli Dapatian, and Jocasta Nu. In &quot;Master &amp; Apprentice&quot;, set seven years before &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, the council includes Yoda, Mace Windu, Depa Billaba, Poli Dapatian (who is in the process of retiring), Eeth Koth, and Saesee Tiin.

In the final days before the end of the Clone Wars and the extermination of the Jedi Order, the Council consisted of the following members:
*Yoda
*Mace Windu
*Plo Koon
*Stass Allie
*Shaak Ti
*Kit Fisto
*Saesee Tiin
*Coleman Kcaj
*Anakin Skywalker
*Agen Kolar
*Obi-Wan Kenobi
*Ki-Adi-Mundi
====Council of First Knowledge====
The Council of First Knowledge administered the Temple-based academy and its curriculum and funded scholars&#x27; scientific research. To this end, the Council guarded and maintained the Temple Archives and its Holocron vaults, as well as the &quot;Shadow program&quot; at the Jedi Temple: Jedi Sentinels tasked with hunting down Sith artifacts.

====Council of Reconciliation====
The Council of Reconciliation dealt with the Galactic Senate and the Republic Diplomatic Corps in order to help bring diplomatic resolutions to conflicts and end political standoffs. The &quot;first face&quot; of the Republic presented to worlds interested in joining the Republic, this council would dispatch Jedi diplomats and ambassadors to moderate debate and hammer out treaties

====Council of Reassignment====
The Council of Reassignment administered the Jedi Service Corps and each of its branch councils. Organizing work for those Initiates who failed out of the academy and Knights with special talents, the Reassignment Council oversaw this branch&#x27;s missions and assignments.

===Ranks of authority and educational progress===
Every Jedi, regardless of species or homeworld, is trained for their career at Jedi Academy. Entrance is determined by rigorous examination and psychological tests. When Jedi Sentinels, known as &quot;Seekers&quot;, discover or test a suitable &quot;force-sensitive&quot; candidate, they are taken to the Jedi Academy at the age of 5 (for humans; varies depending on the species and arbitrary calendar years) with the parent&#x27;s permission. Jedi scholarship educations are considered prestigious, as most parents are portrayed as either happy or proud of the opportunity presented to their child, who could never afford an education. However, most parents also are generally sad since they know they are unlikely to see their child again before adulthood.

Jedi members could technically leave the Order whenever they want, but most of these children were essentially orphaned. Because they were removed from their family at such a young age, they were detached, being indoctrinated into the Jedi way of life through a structured system. The Jedi Archives holds records of every known force sensitive child; Yoda destroyed these records during the Jedi Purge, before Darth Vader assaulted the Jedi Temple, to protect these children from being exploited by the Sith.

Members of the Order progress through four educational stages, at times referred to as levels:

====Initiate====
Initiation is the first part of Jedi training; they are mentored by Jedi Masters in rudimentary control over the Force and basic self-defense techniques.

Most Initiates were typically Younglings (a child Jedi-in-training), receiving an early and first-class education. The first ten years of a youngling&#x27;s training demands segregation from outside distractions and is deliberately designed to reinforce detachment from earthly emotions, including loyalty or love for their parents. Initiates are taught to abandon ego, and that discipline, selflessness and truthfulness will lead to harmony with The Force. This is why Yoda initially denied both Anakin and Luke Skywalker for being &quot;too old for training&quot;.

Younglings were portrayed training under Jedi Master Yoda in a scene on &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; and hiding during the assault on the Jedi Temple in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; before being murdered off-screen by Anakin Skywalker (as the then-newly christened Darth Vader).

The &quot;Young Jedi&quot; story arc and the episode &quot;Path of the Jedi&quot; explored the Jedi tradition called &quot;The Gathering,&quot; where initiates traveled to the &quot;Crystal Caves&quot; of Ilum to harvest kyber crystals, which they would use to build their first lightsabers. Crystals were attuned to individual Jedi and lacked color. The Force spoke to each of the younglings through their crystals. To find their crystal, each initiate had to learn a lesson: courage, hope, patience, trust, confidence, and selflessness.

====Padawan====
An Initiate who successfully completes &quot;fundamental training&quot; is given a second-class education and then undergoes Padawan training under the tutelage of a Mentor (usually a Jedi Knight or Jedi Master). They are also called &quot;Apprentices&quot; and &quot;Padawan learners&quot;. In the Old Republic, Padawans usually wore a hair braid or a bead string (for species without hair) on the right side of their head which was severed with a lightsaber by the Jedi Grand Master upon attaining knighthood. They also served as Commanders in the Clone Wars.

====Knight====
Disciplined and experienced, Jedi Knights become so only when they have completed &quot;the trials&quot; (final tests), they officially graduate, being eligible for specialized advance courses, and may continue to pursue a third-class education (see below) to obtain the equivalent of a habilitation or post-doctoral degree. As the most common and numerous rank, Knights are youthful journeyman eager to travel the galaxy, obtain new experiences and serve the Republic; thus Knights are frequently &quot;the face&quot; of the Order, with all Jedi erroneously referred to by the general public as Knights, and the rank is interchangeably referred to as &quot;Jedi&quot;, &quot;Jedi Knight&quot; and &quot;Master Jedi&quot; (although the latter are honorifics used only by Younglings and Padawans when addressing Jedi Knights or above). 

The five tests are usually known as &quot;Trial of Skill&quot;, the &quot;Trial of Courage&quot;, the &quot;Trial of the Flesh&quot;, the &quot;Trial of Spirit&quot;, and the &quot;Trial of Insight (or Knowledge)&quot;. In &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, Master Yoda gives his apprentice, Luke Skywalker, the trial of confronting Darth Vader for a second time so he might become a full-fledged Knight. Occasionally, performing an extraordinary (usually heroic) act can earn a Padawan learner Jedi status, such as when Obi-Wan Kenobi defeats the Sith Lord, Darth Maul. By the time of the Skywalker Saga films, distinct &quot;battle classes&quot; were not necessary as the Republic had not seen war in over a thousand years, and the title of Knight was simply a rank once again.

====Master====
The title of Jedi Master is bestowed upon the most powerful members of the Jedi Order. Masters are regarded as among the most accomplished and recognized polymaths in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; galaxy; generally, they have resigned from wanderlust ways of knighthood and instead apply their acquired years of wisdom and experience to meditative, administrative and educational pursuits. Upon completion of vocational or postgraduate education, a Jedi Knight becomes a Jedi Master after successfully training several Padawan learners to Knight status, such as when Obi-Wan Kenobi became a Jedi Master after he successfully trained Anakin Skywalker to the point where he was able to complete the trials and become a Jedi Knight. Though this is the most common manner, there are other ways of attaining the rank. Some Jedi masters include Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn, and Yoda.

===Specializations and occupations===
Various careers, occupations, ranks and titles were available to all Jedi. Upon a Padawan&#x27;s ascension to &quot;&quot;Knighthood&quot;-status&quot;, a Jedi pursued higher education or vocational education and training in a field of expertise; choose a career based on preference, personal talents and skills. Before the Great Jedi Purge, numerous divisions existed across the whole of the order, but most personnel are represented within the three order divisions: the Order of the Guardian, the Order of the Consular, or Order of the Sentinel. In addition to their specialization, in times of war, the High Council could demand that the members of the Order assume military ranks in order to defend the Republic.

====Hierarchy====
* Grand Master of the Jedi Order: The Grand Master is the oldest, the most experienced, the most accomplished and the best trained of all Jedi. A Grand Master is voted unanimously by the Jedi High Council. The Grand Master serves as the organization&#x27;s figurehead in charge of ceremonial duties and dictates the organization&#x27;s general policies while providing direction and guidance to the entire Jedi Order. Yoda and Luke Skywalker were Jedi Grandmasters.
* Chief Librarian of the Jedi Archives: The overseer of the &quot;Jedi Archives&quot;, &quot;Holocron Vault&quot;, &quot;Librarian&#x27;s Assembly&quot; and the &quot;Educational Corps&quot;. Second only to the Grand Master in administrative importance, the Chief Librarian worked closely with the &quot;Council of First Knowledge&quot;. Around the time of the Clone Wars, the Chief Librarian was the elderly Jedi Master Jocasta Nu.
* Chief Master of the Jedi High Council (or &#x27;Master of the Order&#x27;): The Chief Master of the High Council is elected by the Jedi High Council, which effectively acts as chairman, Chief of staff and chief operating officer. Its chief responsibilities include; presiding over High Council meetings of the assembled group, conducting Jedi businesses in an orderly fashion, managing the executive particulars of the day-to-day administration of the Jedi Order, acting as representative or spokesperson to the Galactic Senate, and serving as the Grand Master&#x27;s junior partner. Jedi Master Mace Windu filled this position at the time of the Clone Wars.
* Jedi General: A title given to those given commanding roles in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.
* Jedi Commander: This title was given to Jedi Padawans under the leadership of Jedi Knights and Jedi Masters with their roles as Jedi Generals in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars.

====Divisions====
* Jedi Guardian: Jedi Guardians are the vigilant warrior-class, being the original, most common and numerous among the Jedi, easily identified by their blue lightsabers; they focused all aspects of combat and military prowess as an extension of their being, and trained on combining and perfecting their athletic, aviation and martial art skills with mastery of the Force. The Force skills studied by the Guardians were typically those used for quickly disabling an opponent and aiding in agility and stamina. Many were stationed within Republic planetary or sectoral government&#x27;s security agencies where they worked as special peacekeepers and law enforcement agents, helping to quell riots and capture terrorists. The highest-ranking Jedi Guardians were stationed at the Jedi academies as instructors tasked with passing down their experience to the young students of the Order. Those Jedi who mastered lightsaber-combat techniques (such as Mace Windu) were dubbed Weapon Masters and were among the greatest warriors of the Order.
* Jedi Consular: Jedi Consulars are the contemplative scholar-class, being easily identified by their green lightsabers; they were deep thinkers and philosophers devoted to the mental aspects of the force, studied the greater inner workings of the force behind the scenes, focused on further mastery of the Force, the sharpening of mental faculties, and wielded a lightsaber only for self-defense. Overseen by the Council of Reconciliation, Jedi Consulars were often called upon to act as impartial advisers, diplomats, and arbiters. Most Consulars specialized as historians, archivists, librarians, archaeologists, geologists, biologists, mathematicians, and astronomers; they contributed to the growth and preservation of the Jedi Archives as &quot;Lore Keepers&quot; directed by the &quot;Librarian&#x27;s Assembly&quot;. Some Consulars worked closely with the Republic bureaucrats to assist in greeting unaligned governments and helping them join the Republic and given the authority to hammer out a compromise or treaty during tense negotiations, backed by the full support of the Senate and Jedi Order. Some Consulars joined the Circle of Jedi Healers (headquartered out of the Coruscant Temple&#x27;s &quot;Halls of Healing&quot;) and focused on the medical and humanitarian aspects of the Force, manipulating the Living Force to perform the art of healing. Those Jedi specifically predisposed to receive visions through the Force were known as &quot;Seers&quot;, maintaining and updating the Order&#x27;s holocrons; the most perceptive of these Jedi (such as Yoda) were known as Prophets and foretold the future of the galaxy.
* Jedi Sentinel: Jedi Sentinels are the pragmatic tech-class, being easily identified by their yellow lightsabers; they blended multiple schools of teaching, amplified them with a series of non-force skills, and focused on diverse inter-disciplinary talents that were not often associated with the Jedi. Sentinels applied their Force abilities as engineers, technicians, intelligence and security experts. Interestingly they stayed away from the Jedi Temple preferring to conduct their affairs within communities throughout the Galaxy. Most Sentinels tended to take a middle road approach to problems, being stationed at numerous locations for decades, to serve as liaison officers between the system or sector and the Republic. The most loyal Sentinel join the anonymous &quot;Jedi Temple Guard&quot; charged with guarding the Jedi Temple; such dedication demanded no emotional relationship or identity. Some Sentinels aided police as detectives through the use of the Force. Since Republic law required all newborns to undergo &quot;Force-sensitivity&quot; testing, Sentinels who worked as members of the &quot;Acquisition Division of the Order&quot; routinely tracked down and identified Force-sensitive children to assess whether they met the qualifications to receive training in the Jedi Order. The most elite Sentinels became &quot;Shadows&quot; or &quot;Watchmen&quot;: the Jedi-secret police who worked under the supervision of the &quot;First Knowledge Council&quot; to destroy all remnants of the Sith.

===Resources and technology===
In the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, the Jedi are usually portrayed wearing simple robes and carrying specialized field gear for their missions. Their philosophical lifestyles mirror those of real-world religious vows and evangelical counsels, as their personal possessions are provided exclusively by the Jedi Order, and are only meant to allow self-sufficiency.

====Weapons====

The most notable instrument wielded by a Jedi is the lightsaber. Both Jedi and Sith use lightsabers, though the former regard them as a tool, the latter, a weapon. The Jedi&#x27;s lightsabers emit cool colors, usually blue or green blades (sometimes yellow, or purple, as seen in the case of Mace Windu), while the Sith emit warm colors (red). Lightsabers can be of many different colors depending on the crystal fixture and reflective of the wielders&#x27; psychological profile. Most Jedi use naturally formed crystals, frequently ranging between blue, green and yellow; whereas Sith tend to use corrupted or synthetic crystals, which are usually red in color.
Although rare, spear-like, whip-like and multi-bladed lightsabers can exist, especially among Sith such as Darth Maul&#x27;s double-bladed lightsaber, the Inqusitors&#x27; double-bladed/rotating ones, or Kylo Ren&#x27;s crossguard-bladed one (due to a cracked kyber crystal).

====Vehicles====
Eta-2 Actis Jedi interceptors first appeared in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;. Delta-7B Aethersprite Jedi starfighters appear in &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;. In &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, Obi-Wan Kenobi travels via Jedi starfighter to Kamino to investigate the attempted assassination of Padmé Amidala; he also flies a Jedi starfighter to Geonosis in an attempt to track down the bounty hunter Jango Fett. Lacking a hyperdrive, the starfighter relies on an external sled to propel it through hyperspace. Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) fly updated Jedi starfighters (called Jedi interceptors) in the opening sequence of &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;. Later, Plo Koon (Matt Sloan) flies a &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;-era starfighter when he is shot down by clone troopers carrying out Darth Sidious&#x27; (Ian McDiarmid) Order 66.

The Jedi starfighter&#x27;s triangular shape in &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; stems from the shape of Imperial Star Destroyers in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. Industrial Light &amp; Magic designer Doug Chiang identified the Jedi starfighter as one of the first designs that bridges the aesthetic between the prequel and original trilogies. Chiang noted that viewers&#x27; familiarity with the Star Destroyer&#x27;s appearance and Imperial affiliation gives added symbolism to the Jedi craft&#x27;s appearance and foreshadows the Empire&#x27;s rise to power. The starfighter seen in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; is a cross between the previous film&#x27;s vessel and the Empire&#x27;s TIE fighters from the original trilogy. Hasbro&#x27;s expanding wings in the &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; Jedi starfighter toy inspired the opening wings in the &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; vessel. The starfighter in the &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; is called a Jedi interceptor.

====Jedi Archives====
The Jedi Archives, known as The Great Library of Ossus or The Great Library of the Jedi, contained the galaxy&#x27;s most priceless and ancient of texts sacred to Jedi scholars and archaeologists. Among these were Sith artifacts, considered by the Jedi Order to be the most dangerous artifacts in the galaxy, that were accessible only to those able to control the Dark Side of the Force.

The Jedi archives of the Jedi Temple in the movie &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; bear a startling resemblance to the Long Room of the Trinity College Library in Dublin. This resemblance resulted in controversy as permission had not been sought to use the building&#x27;s likeness in the film. However, Lucasfilm denied that the Long Room was the basis for the Jedi archives, and officials from Trinity College Library decided not to take any legal action.

====Jedi Academy====

The Jedi academies were established to train Force-sensitive beings accepted into the Jedi Order in the ways of the Force. Overseen by the Council of First Knowledge, each academy was governed by an advisory Council appointed by their superiors on Coruscant. Mainstreaming the majority of teachings at the Temple, certain practices were permitted to vary from world to world. However, at all sanctioned academies, a group of Jedi Masters would instruct Initiates to the Order in the ways of the Force. The size of the school varied from world to world; the smallest consisted of a single clan of younglings, and the largest was the main academy housed within the Jedi Temple of Coruscant. Most academies had been established during the Old Sith Wars and were located in the Galactic Rim. Some were located on or near Force-wellsprings or places significant to the Order like crystal caves or nexuses of dark side energies that needed constant monitoring.

In addition to the traditional academies established by the Order, the Exploration Corps maintained several spacefaring mobile academies such as the &quot;Chu&#x27;unthor&quot; so that roaming the galaxy and exploring new worlds could be achieved while still teaching traditional doctrine.

By the fall of the Galactic Republic in 19 BBY, many of the ancient academies had been shut down for decades, with the Council of First Knowledge preferring the central teachings of the Coruscant Temple. After the dissolution of the Order during the Great Jedi Purge, all orthodox Temples and academies were routed and burned in order to prevent any more Jedi from learning the secrets of the Force. However, the Galactic Empire&#x27;s chokehold on Force-education did not last and the Order was reformed following the conclusion of the Galactic Civil War. After Grand Master Luke Skywalker&#x27;s New Order became a single class of twelve students including his nephew Ben Solo, it was reduced to only himself when his nephew turned to the dark side and became Kylo Ren.

====Jedi Temple====
In the prequel trilogy, the primary Jedi Temple is located on the Republic&#x27;s capital planet of Coruscant. As the chief administrative headquarters, the Temple served the Order in three capacities: a monastery and library for the Jedi seeking enlightenment and to reflect on the will of the Force; an academy and training center for Jedi younglings and Padawans who endeavored to join the ranks of the Jedi Knights; and government, in which the Masters of the Jedi High Council guided the Order&#x27;s direction. It was originally built atop an old &quot;dark-side nexus&quot; shrine during the birth of the Republic, so as to be symbolic to the Coruscant people that the tyrannical rule of the Sith was over.

In &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, the Jedi Temple is attacked by clone troopers of the 501st Legion, led by the newly christened Darth Vader, who butchered the Jedi within and set the Temple alight. After the fall of the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic, the Temple became the Palace of the Emperor and a location for his dark side artifacts. It would serve as Sidious&#x27; residence for over two decades until his death at the battle of Endor. The Temple is visible in the celebrations on Coruscant at the end of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. After the destruction of the Sith, Luke Skywalker—the last of the Jedi—recovered fragments of a Force-sensitive tree that was once located at the heart of the Jedi Temple.

&quot;Architects&#x27; Journal&quot; rated the temple third on its top-ten architecture of &quot;Star Wars&quot; list behind the second Death Star and Jabba the Hutt’s palace on Tatooine, and ahead of Coruscant, the capital city of the Old Republic. The temple is described in the article as adapting &quot;the robust typology of Mayan temples, with durasteel cladding specified for the external stone walls for improved defensive strength&quot; and said to be a ziggurat that &quot;is built above a Force-nexus and has ample room for training facilities, accommodation and the Jedi Archive&quot;. The temple has five towers, the tallest being Tranquility Spire, that are stylistically similar to the minarets surrounding the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. &quot;Star Wars Insider&quot; listed it as the one hundredth greatest thing about &quot;Star Wars&quot; in its one hundredth issue special.

==&quot;Legends&quot; depiction of the Jedi==
With the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot; were rebranded as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.

In novels and reference books now considered &quot;Legends&quot;, the interpretation of the Jedi teaching on not forming attachments was alternating between being in line with George Lucas&#x27; vision and using &quot;attachment&quot; in the sense of affection, fondness and loving commitment, stating that the Jedi Code prohibited these emotional bonds. Furthermore, the Jedi were depicted as a quasi-militaristic organization with strict political alignment to the Galactic Republic.

===Je&#x27;daii===

Precursors to modern Jedi, the Je&#x27;daii Order studied both light and dark sides of the mysterious Force, striving to balance them equally. The preview &quot;Dawn of the Jedi&quot; issue dates the Je&#x27;daii origins to 36,453 years BBY. Before lightsabers and hyperspace travel, the Je&#x27;daii journeyed across the planet Tython, training at the Order&#x27;s nine temples and mastering the lessons of each.

===The New Jedi Order===

In novels set after the events of the film series, Luke Skywalker re-established the Jedi High Council as part of his New Jedi Order. The most notable difference between the format of the new council and the old is that only half of the council are made up of Jedi, while the other half consisted of politicians. Following the war with the Yuuzhan Vong, the Jedi withdrew their support from anyone political entity and relocated to Ossus, where Luke had a full Jedi Council re-established.

The New Jedi Order was the restored and reformed Jedi organization, in the wake of the Great Jedi Purge and the subsequent fall of the Galactic Empire. The Jedi Knights, reduced in number to only a handful, were slowly restored, primarily under the leadership of Grandmaster Luke Skywalker. Skywalker abolished the traditional Master/Padawan system. He believed all Jedi should be both teachers and students; that they should both learn from and mentor each other, and not just from one Master.

Within the Expanded Universe, &quot;The New Jedi Order&quot; indicates that the Jedi Temple on Coruscant is no longer standing but it is rebuilt as a gift to Jedi for their services and achievements during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion. The new temple is in the form of a massive pyramid made from stone and transparisteel that is designed to fit into the new look of Coruscant, though internally it is identical to the design seen in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;.

==Cultural impact and critical response==
The United States Army had a group of officers in the early 1980s who promoted maneuver warfare tactics, and who were derisively referred to as Jedi by more conventional officers who were satisfied with attrition warfare tactics and methods.

=== Analysis ===
In &quot;Star Wars and Philosophy&quot;, William Stephens compares the Jedi to Stoicism:

Functionally, the Jedi order resembles a Praetorian Guard.

===Media===
Jedi have made their way into certain areas of pop culture, such as &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s song &quot;The Saga Begins&quot;, a parody of &quot;American Pie&quot;. In the film &quot;The Men Who Stare at Goats&quot; (2009), a reporter follows a former soldier who claimed to be a &quot;Jedi warrior&quot;, a nickname for psychic spies in the US military.

===Religion===

One of the enduring influences the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga has had in popular culture is the idea of the fictional Jedi values being interpreted as a modern philosophical path or religion, spawning various movements such as the Jediism (religious) and the Jedi census phenomenon.

<text>James Tobin (March 5, 1918 – March 11, 2002) was an American economist who served on the Council of Economic Advisers and consulted with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and taught at Harvard and Yale Universities. He contributed to the development of key ideas in the Keynesian economics of his generation and advocated government intervention in particular to stabilize output and avoid recessions. His academic work included pioneering contributions to the study of investment, monetary and fiscal policy and financial markets. He also proposed an econometric model for censored dependent variables, the well-known tobit model.

Along with fellow neo-Keynesian economist James Meade in 1977, Tobin proposed nominal GDP targeting as a monetary policy rule in 1980. Tobin received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1981 for &quot;creative and extensive work on the analysis of financial markets and their relations to expenditure decisions, employment, production and prices.&quot;

Outside academia, Tobin was widely known for his suggestion of a tax on foreign exchange transactions, now known as the &quot;Tobin tax.&quot; This was designed to reduce speculation in the international currency markets, which he saw as dangerous and unproductive.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Tobin was born on March 5, 1918, in Champaign, Illinois. His father was Louis Michael Tobin (b. 1879), a journalist working at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. His father had fought in World War I, was a member of the first Greek organization at Illinois (Delta Tau Delta fraternity Beta Upsilon chapter), and was credited as the inventor of &quot;Homecoming.&quot; His mother, Margaret Edgerton Tobin (b. 1893), was a social worker. Tobin attended the University Laboratory High School of Urbana, Illinois, a laboratory school in the University&#x27;s campus.

In 1935, on his father&#x27;s advice, Tobin took the entrance exams for Harvard University. Despite no special preparation for the exams, he passed and was admitted with a national scholarship from the university. During his studies he first read Keynes&#x27; &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot;, published in 1936. Tobin graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in 1939 with a thesis centered on a critical analysis of Keynes&#x27; mechanism for introducing equilibrium involuntary unemployment. His first published article, in 1941, was based on this senior thesis.

Tobin immediately started graduate studies, also at Harvard, earning his AM degree in 1940. In 1941, he interrupted graduate studies to work for the Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply and the War Production Board in Washington, D.C. The next year, after the United States entered World War II, he enlisted in the US Navy, spending the war as an officer on destroyers including (among possibly others) the . At the end of the war he returned to Harvard and resumed studies, receiving his Ph.D. in 1947 with a thesis on the consumption function written under the supervision of Joseph Schumpeter. In 1947 Tobin was elected a Junior Fellow of Harvard&#x27;s Society of Fellows, which allowed him the freedom and funding to spend the next three years studying and doing research.

===Academic activity and consultancy===
In 1950 Tobin moved to Yale University, where he remained for the rest of his career. He joined the Cowles Foundation, which moved to Yale in 1955, also serving as its president between 1955–1961 and 1964–1965. His main research interest was to provide microfoundations to Keynesian economics, with a special focus on monetary economics. One of his frequent collaborators was his Yale colleague William Brainard. In 1957 Tobin was appointed Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.

Besides teaching and research, Tobin was also strongly involved in the public life, writing on current economic issues and serving as an economic expert and policy consultant. During 1961–62, he served as a member of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers, under the chairman Walter Heller, then acted as a consultant between 1962 and 1968. Here, in close collaboration with Arthur Okun, Robert Solow and Kenneth Arrow, he helped design the Keynesian economic policy implemented by the Kennedy administration. Tobin also served for several terms as a member of the Board of Governors of Federal Reserve System Academic Consultants and as a consultant of the US Treasury Department.

Tobin was awarded the John Bates Clark Medal in 1955 and, in 1981, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics. He was a fellow of several professional associations, holding the position of president of the American Economic Association in 1971. He was an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the United States National Academy of Sciences.

In 1972 Tobin, along with fellow Yale economics professor William Nordhaus, published &quot;Is Growth Obsolete?&quot;, an article that introduced the Measure of Economic Welfare as the first model for economic sustainability assessment, and economic sustainability measurement.

In 1982–1983, Tobin was Ford Visiting Research Professor of Economics at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1988 he formally retired from Yale, but continued to deliver some lectures as Professor Emeritus and continued to write. He died on March 11, 2002, in New Haven, Connecticut.

Tobin was a trustee of Economists for Peace and Security.

===Personal life===
James Tobin married Elizabeth Fay Ringo, a former M.I.T. student of Paul Samuelson, on September 14, 1946. They had four children.

===Legacy===
In August 2009 in a roundtable interview in Prospect &quot;magazine&quot;, Adair Turner supported the idea of new global taxes on financial transactions, warning that the &quot;swollen&quot; financial sector paying excessive salaries had grown too big for society. Lord Turner&#x27;s suggestion that a &quot;Tobin tax&quot; – named after James Tobin – should be considered for financial transactions made headlines around the world.

Tobin&#x27;s Tobit model of regression with censored endogenous variables (Tobin 1958a) is a standard econometric technique. His &quot;q&quot; theory of investment (Tobin 1969), the Baumol–Tobin model of the transactions demand for money (Tobin 1956), and his model of liquidity preference as behavior toward risk (the asset demand for money) (Tobin 1958b) are all staples of economics textbooks.

In his 1958 article Tobin also led the way in showing how to deal with utility maximization under uncertainty with an infinite number of possible states. As Palda explains &quot;One way to get out of the mess of figuring out asset prices using a model of maximizing the expected utility of investing in stocks is to make assumptions about either preferences or the probabilities of the different possible states of the world. Nobellist James Tobin (1958) took this line and discovered that in some cases you do not need to worry about the utility of income in thousands of states, and the attached probabilities, to solve the consumer&#x27;s choice on how to spread income among states. When preferences contain only a linear and a squared term (a case of diminishing returns) or the probabilities of different stock returns follow a normal distribution (an equation that contains a linear and squared terms as parameters), a simple formulation of a person&#x27;s investment choices becomes possible. Under Tobin&#x27;s assumptions we can reformulate the person&#x27;s decision problem as being one of trading off risk and expected return. Risk, or more precisely the variance of your investment portfolio creates spread in the returns you expect. People are willing to assume more risk only if compensated by a higher level of expected return. One can thus think of a tradeoff people are willing to make between risk and expected return. They invest in risky assets to the point at which their willingness to trade off risk and return is equal to the rate at which they able to trade them off. It is difficult to exaggerate how brilliant is the simplification of the investment problem that flows from these assumptions. Instead of worrying about the investor&#x27;s optimization problem in potentially millions of possible states of the world, one need only worry about how the investor can trade off risk and return in the stock market.&quot;

<doc id="16382" wikidata="Q357974" url="?curid=16382" title="Julian Lennon">
<text>Julian Charles John Lennon (born John Charles Julian Lennon; 8 April 1963) is an English musician, photographer, author, and philanthropist. He is the son of Beatles member John Lennon, and, John Lennon&#x27;s first wife, Cynthia, and he is named after his paternal grandmother, Julia Lennon. Julian inspired three Beatles songs: &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; (1967), &quot;Hey Jude&quot; (1968), and &quot;Good Night&quot; (1968). 

Lennon started a music career in 1984 with the album &quot;Valotte&quot;, best known for &quot;Too Late for Goodbyes&quot; and the title track, and has since released six more albums. He has held exhibitions of his fine-art photography and has written several children&#x27;s books. In 2006, Lennon produced the environmental documentary film &quot;Whaledreamers&quot;, which won eight international awards. In 2007, he founded The White Feather Foundation (TWFF), whose stated mission goal is to address &quot;environmental and humanitarian issues&quot;.

In 2020, Lennon was executive producer of the Netflix documentary &quot;Kiss the Ground&quot; about regenerative agriculture and the follow-up film &quot;Common Ground&quot;. In 2022, Lennon was executive producer of the documentary film &quot;Women of the White Buffalo&quot;, which chronicles the lives of women living on the Lakota Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.

== Early life ==
Julian Lennon was born John Charles Julian Lennon on 8 April 1963 at Sefton General Hospital in Liverpool, to John Lennon and Cynthia Powell. He was named after his paternal grandmother, Julia Lennon, who died five years before his birth. The Beatles&#x27; manager, Brian Epstein, was his godfather. Lennon was educated firstly at Kingsmead School, Hoylake, during 1974–1975; then, when his mother remarried, he moved to Wales and attended Ruthin School, a boarding private school in the town of Ruthin, Denbighshire, in North Wales.

Lennon inspired one of his father&#x27;s most famous songs, &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;, whose lyrics describe a picture the boy had drawn, a watercolour painting of his friend, Lucy O&#x27;Donnell, from nursery school, surrounded by stars. Another composition of his father inspired by him was the lullaby &quot;Good Night&quot;, the closing song of &quot;The Beatles&quot; (also known as The White Album). In 1967, at the age of four, he attended the set of the Beatles&#x27; film &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;.

When Julian was five years old, in 1968, his parents divorced, following his father&#x27;s infidelity with Japanese multimedia artist Yoko Ono. John Lennon married Ono on 20 March 1969. Julian would later have a younger half-brother, Sean Lennon.

Paul McCartney wrote &quot;Hey Jude&quot; to console him over the divorce; originally called &quot;Hey Jules&quot;, McCartney changed the name because he thought that &quot;Jude&quot; was an easier name to sing. After his parents&#x27; divorce, Julian had almost no contact with his father until the early 1970s when, at the request of his father&#x27;s then-girlfriend, May Pang (Yoko Ono and Lennon had temporarily separated), he began to visit his father regularly. John Lennon bought Julian a Gibson Les Paul guitar and a drum machine for Christmas 1973 and encouraged his interest in music by showing him some chords.

== Relationship with his father ==
Following his father&#x27;s murder on 8 December 1980, Julian Lennon voiced anger and resentment toward him, saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve never really wanted to know the truth about how Dad was with me. There was some very negative stuff talked about me ... like when he said I&#x27;d come out of a whiskey bottle on a Saturday night. Stuff like that. You think, where&#x27;s the love in that? Paul and I used to hang about quite a bit ... more than Dad and I did. We had a great friendship going and there seems to be far more pictures of me and Paul playing together at that age than there are pictures of me and my dad.&quot;

Julian chafed at hearing his father&#x27;s &#x27;peace and love&#x27; stance perpetually celebrated. He told &quot;The Daily Telegraph,&quot; &quot;I have to say that, from my point of view, I felt he was a hypocrite. Dad could talk about peace and love out loud to the world but he could never show it to the people who supposedly meant the most to him: his wife and son. How can you talk about peace and love and have a family in bits and pieces—no communication, adultery, divorce? You can&#x27;t do it, not if you&#x27;re being true and honest with yourself.&quot; Julian added, &quot;Mum was more about love than Dad. He sang about it, he spoke about, but he never really gave it, at least not to me as his son. The darker side definitely comes from Dad. Whenever I get too aggressive, which comes from Dad&#x27;s side, I try to calm myself down, be more positive.&quot;

Recalling his renewed contact with his father in the mid-1970s, Julian said in 2009, &quot;Dad and I got on a great deal better then. We had a lot of fun, laughed a lot and had a great time in general when he was with May Pang. My memories of that time with Dad and May are very clear—they were the happiest time I can remember with him.&quot;

Julian was excluded from his father&#x27;s will. However, a trust of £100,000 was created by his father to be shared between Julian and his half-brother, Sean. Julian sued his father&#x27;s estate and in 1996 reached a settlement agreement, authorised by Lennon&#x27;s widow, Yoko Ono, reportedly worth £20 million.

In an interview with CBS News in 2009, Julian stated, &quot;I realised if I continued to feel that anger and bitterness towards my dad, I would have a constant cloud hanging over my head my whole life. After recording the song &#x27;Lucy,&#x27; almost by nature, it felt right to fulfill the circle, forgive Dad, put the pain, anger and bitterness in the past, and focus and appreciate the good things. Writing is therapy for me and, for the first time in my life, I&#x27;m actually feeling it and believing it. It also has allowed me to actually embrace Dad and the Beatles.&quot;

== Career ==
=== Music career ===
Aside from The Beatles, Lennon was influenced by David Bowie, Keith Jarrett, Steely Dan, and AC/DC.

Lennon made his musical debut at age 11 on his father&#x27;s album &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; playing drums on &quot;Ya-Ya&quot;, later saying, &quot;Dad, had I known you were going to put it on the album, I would&#x27;ve played much better!&quot; In the sleeve notes in the album the song is credited to Julian Lennon &quot;starring on drums&quot; with &quot;dad on piano&quot;.

Lennon enjoyed immediate success with his debut album, &quot;Valotte&quot;, released in 1984. Produced by Phil Ramone, it spawned two top 10 hits, (the title track and &quot;Too Late for Goodbyes&quot;) and earned Lennon a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1986. Music videos for the two hits were made by film director Sam Peckinpah and producer Martin Lewis. After the album&#x27;s release, Paul McCartney sent Lennon a telegram wishing him good luck.

His second album, 1986&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Value of Daydreaming&quot;, was panned by critics. However, it reached number 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and produced the single &quot;Stick Around&quot;, which was Lennon&#x27;s first number-one single on the US Album Rock Tracks chart. He recorded the song &quot;Because&quot;, previously recorded by The Dave Clark Five, in the UK for Clark&#x27;s 1986 musical &quot;Time&quot;.

On 1 April 1987, Julian Lennon appeared as the Baker in Mike Batt&#x27;s musical &quot;The Hunting of the Snark&quot; (based on Lewis Carroll&#x27;s poem). The all-star lineup included Roger Daltrey, Justin Hayward and Billy Connolly, with John Hurt as the narrator. The performance, a musical benefit at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall in aid of the deaf, was attended by the Duchess of York. In October the same year he performed with Chuck Berry. Although Lennon never achieved the same level of success in the US as he had enjoyed with &quot;Valotte&quot;, his 1989 single &quot;Now You&#x27;re in Heaven&quot; peaked at number 5 in Australia and gave him his second number 1 hit on the Album Rock Tracks chart in the US.

In 1991, George Harrison sent some ideas for Lennon&#x27;s album &quot;Help Yourself&quot;, although he did not play or receive any credits. The single &quot;Saltwater&quot; reached number 6 in the UK and topped the Australian singles charts for four weeks. During this time, Lennon contributed a cover of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot; to the soundtrack of the television series &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;.

Lennon left the music business for several years in the 1990s to focus on philanthropy after his encounter with elders from the Mirning people of Australia. After he began his performing career, there was occasionally unfounded media speculation that Lennon would undertake performances with McCartney, Harrison and Ringo Starr. In the &quot;Beatles Anthology&quot; series in 1995, the three surviving Beatles confirmed there was never an idea of having Julian sit in for his father as part of a Beatles reunion, with McCartney saying, &quot;Why would we want to subject him to all of this?&quot;

In May 1998, Lennon released the album &quot;Photograph Smile&quot; on his own record label. Music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the album as &quot;well-crafted and melodic&quot;, and concluded by saying that it was &quot;the kind of music that would receive greater praise if it weren&#x27;t made by the son of a Beatle&quot;. In 2002, he recorded a version of &quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot;, from the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album, for an Allstate Insurance commercial.

In 2006, he ventured into Internet businesses, including MyStore.com with Todd Meagher and Bebo founder Michael Birch. In 2009, Lennon created a new partnership with Meagher and Birch called theRevolution, LLC. Through this company, Lennon released a tribute song and EP, &quot;Lucy&quot;, honouring the memory of Lucy Vodden (née O&#x27;Donnell), the little girl who inspired the song &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;, with 50 per cent of the proceeds going to fund Lupus research.

In October 2011, Lennon released the album &quot;Everything Changes&quot;. In 2012 he worked with music film director Dick Carruthers on the feature-length video documentary &quot;Through the Picture Window&quot;, which followed Lennon&#x27;s journey in the making of &quot;Everything Changes&quot; and includes interviews with Steven Tyler, Bono, Gregory Darling, Mark Spiro and Paul Buchanan from The Blue Nile. &quot;Through the Picture Window&quot; was also released as an app in all formats with bespoke videos for all 14 tracks from the album.

On September 9, 2022, Lennon&#x27;s album &quot;Jude&quot; was released on BMG. It included the singles &quot;Freedom&quot; and &quot;Every Little Moment&quot;. &quot;Goldmine&quot; wrote about the release, &quot;With his new album, the first in 11 years, Julian advances his body of work that has always simultaneously explored personal and global themes, but for the first time in his life, he&#x27;s embracing his inner status as someone&#x27;s son...[an] introspective masterwork from a diversely talented artist.&quot; The title is a reference to the Beatles song &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, which Paul McCartney wrote in 1968 to give Julian Lennon hope for the future. Lennon said about his album title, &quot;Calling it &quot;Jude&quot; was very coming of age for me in that regard because it was very much facing up to who I am...The content came from over three decades of songwriting. The themes and issues mostly being the same, generally about the wars within and the wars without.&quot;

On 23 August 2024, Lennon released a new version of &quot;I Should Have Known&quot;, which was remixed by Spike Stent. Lennon shared, &quot;[the song] was always a favourite of mine,” says Lennon. “I loved the way the new album [&#x27;Jude&#x27;] sounded in particular. (...) I thought maybe Mark &#x27;Spike&#x27; Stent will remix this for me and give it a new life. I want it to breathe life into the world again.&quot;

=== Film ===
Lennon&#x27;s first tour as a solo musician, in early 1985, was documented as part of the film &quot;Stand by Me: A Portrait of Julian Lennon&quot; – a film profile started by Sam Peckinpah, but completed by Martin Lewis after Peckinpah&#x27;s death. Lennon has appeared in several other films including &quot;The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus&quot; (released 1996, originally filmed in 1968), &quot;Cannes Man&quot; (1996), &quot;&quot; (1988), &quot;Chuck Berry: Hail! Hail! Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; (1987) and a cameo in &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; (1995) as a bartender. Julian provided the voice for the title role in the animated film &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1993). He was also the voice of the main character Toby the Teapot in the animated special &quot;The Real Story of I&#x27;m a Little Teapot&quot; (1990).

Lennon is also the producer of the documentary, &quot;Whaledreamers&quot;, about an Indigenous Australian tribe and the peoples&#x27; special connection with whales. It also touches on many environmental issues. This film received several awards and was shown at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival.

In 2018, Lennon was an executive producer of &quot;Women of the White Buffalo&quot;, a documentary film released in 2022 that focused on several Lakota women from Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, and their work to preserve their way of life in the face of colonialism.

In 2020, Lennon was an executive producer of &quot;Kiss the Ground&quot;, an award-winning documentary film about regenerative agriculture, narrated by Woody Harrelson.
=== Photography ===
After photographing his half-brother Sean&#x27;s music tour in 2007, Lennon took up a serious interest in photography.

On 17 September 2010, Lennon opened an exhibition of 35 photographs called &quot;Timeless: The Photography of Julian Lennon&quot; with help from long-time friend and fellow photographer Timothy White. Originally scheduled to run from 17 September to 10 October, the Morrison Hotel Gallery extended it a week to end 17 October. The photographs include shots of his brother Sean and U2 frontman Bono.

Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Alone&quot; collection was featured at the Art Basel Miami Beach Show from 6–9 December 2012, to raise money for The White Feather Foundation.

Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Horizon&quot; series was featured at the Emmanuel Fremin Gallery, NYC, 12 March 2015, to 2 May 2015.

Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Cycle&quot; exhibit was featured at the Leica Gallery in Los Angeles, in the fall of 2016.

Lennon uses the social media app Instagram to share his photography.

In 2021, Lennon became the first fine-arts photographer featured at the new gallery in Aston Martin Residences Miami.

In 2023, Lennon showed a series of photographs in an exhibition titled &quot;ATMOSPHERIA&quot; at William Turner Gallery in Santa Monica, California.

=== Books ===
Shortly after the death of his father, Lennon began collecting Beatles memorabilia. In 2010, he published a book describing his collection, entitled: &quot;Beatles Memorabilia: The Julian Lennon Collection&quot;.

In 2017, Lennon began a &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestselling trilogy, &quot;Touch the Earth&quot;, &quot;Heal the Earth&quot; and &quot;Love the Earth&quot;, which he completed in 2019.

On 9 November 2021, Lennon published a graphic novel for middle-grade children, &quot;The Morning Tribe&quot;, with co-author Bart Davis.

== Philanthropy ==
A conversation Lennon once had with his father went as follows: &quot;Dad once said to me that should he pass away, if there was some way of letting me know he was going to be OK – that we were all going to be OK – the message would come to me in the form of a white feather. ... the white feather has always represented peace to me&quot;. Then Julian, while on a tour in Australia, received a white feather from two Indigenous elders of the Mirning tribe in Adelaide, Australia, asking for him to help give them a voice. In response, he produced the documentary &quot;Whaledreamers&quot; about their tribe, and in 2007 he founded The White Feather Foundation (TWFF), whose mission &quot;embraces environmental and humanitarian issues and in conjunction with partners from around the world helps to raise funds for the betterment of all life, and to honor those who have truly made a difference.&quot;

TWFF partners with philanthropists and charities around the world to raise funds for various humanitarian projects in four major areas of giving: clean water, the preservation of Indigenous cultures, the environment and education and health. In 2008, the Prince of Monaco Albert II presented TWFF with the Better World Environmental Award.

In 2015, after the Nepal earthquake, TWFF contributed $106,347.52 to the Music for Relief&#x27;s Nepal aid fund to support the victims of the earthquake.

Lennon visited Kenya, Ethiopia and Colombia in 2014 to witness the education and environmental initiatives by TWFF. After his mother&#x27;s death the following year, Lennon announced that he would be naming TWFF&#x27;s scholarship program after her: &quot;The Cynthia Lennon Scholarship for Girls&quot;. Since then, the Foundation has awarded over 50 scholarships to girls across Africa, the U.K and the U.S.

In 2019, Lennon contributed his voice and music to the soundtrack of narrative feature film &quot;One Little Finger&quot;, which has the initiative to spread awareness about &#x27;ability in disability&#x27;. It shows how important and powerful music is to support societal and cognitive development of people with disabilities.

In September 2020, Lennon was honoured with the CC Forum Philanthropy Award in Monaco. That same month, he was named a UNESCO Center for Peace 2020 Cross-Cultural and Peace Crafter Award Laureate.

In 2022, Lennon recorded his version of his father&#x27;s 1971 song &quot;Imagine&quot; with all proceeds going to support Ukraine.

== Personal life ==
===Residence and relationships===

After living with his parents at Kenwood in Weybridge outside London from 1964 to 1968, Lennon moved with his mother to a number of British locales, eventually settling in The Wirral near Liverpool and then to a farm in North Wales. Lennon&#x27;s first step-father, Roberto Bassanini, whom his mother married in 1970, was Italian. Lennon moved to the United States in the early 1980s where he resided in New York City and then Los Angeles. In 1991, Lennon moved to Europe, and resided mainly in Italy where Bassanini had lived (Lennon dedicated &quot;Photograph Smile&quot; to Bassanini in 1998). Lennon then moved to Monaco where he currently resides, and he is a friend to Albert II, Prince of Monaco. 

Lennon has been quoted as having a reasonably &quot;cordial&quot; relationship with Ono, following the financial settlement against his late father&#x27;s estate. He remains close to her son, Sean, his half-brother. Julian saw Sean perform live for the first time in Paris on 12 November 2006 at La Boule Noire, and he and Sean spent time together on Sean&#x27;s tour in 2007.

Lennon has no children, revealing in 2011 that his difficult relationship with his father had discouraged him from doing so.

In 2020, he legally changed his name from John Charles Julian Lennon to Julian Charles John Lennon to reflect the name by which he has always been known.

===Health===
In 2020, Lennon had a cancerous mole removed from his head. In December 2024, he revealed on podcast The Joe Rogan Experience that he was waiting for the results of a biopsy recently taken from his arm.

===John Lennon&#x27;s Legacy===
In commemoration of John Lennon&#x27;s 70th birthday and as a statement for peace, Lennon and his mother, Cynthia, unveiled the John Lennon Peace Monument in his home town of Liverpool, on 9 October 2010.

Lennon remains friends with his father&#x27;s former bandmate Paul McCartney, though they experienced a brief public falling out in 2011 when Lennon was not invited to McCartney&#x27;s wedding to Nancy Shevell. According to Lennon, McCartney later assured him that &quot;someone obviously made a huge mistake&quot; and the snub had not been intentional. McCartney provided the handwritten &quot;Jude&quot; motif for Lennon&#x27;s 2022 album. He also remains friends with May Pang who provided the cover photo for &quot;Jude&quot;. He shared his memories of her and his father in Pang&#x27;s 2022 documentary &quot;The Lost Weekend: A Love Story.&quot;

<text>The FIFA World Cup is a gold trophy that is awarded to the winners of the FIFA World Cup association football tournament. Since the advent of the World Cup in 1930, two different trophies have been used: the Jules Rimet Trophy from 1930 to 1970 and thereafter the FIFA World Cup Trophy from 1974 to the present day. The production cost of the current trophy is estimated at $242,700.

The first trophy, originally named &quot;Victory&quot;, but later renamed in honour of FIFA president Jules Rimet, was made of gold plated sterling silver and a lapis lazuli base. It depicted Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. Brazil was awarded the trophy in perpetuity following their third title in 1970, prompting the commissioning of a replacement. The original Jules Rimet Trophy was stolen in 1983 and has never been recovered.

The subsequent trophy, called the &quot;FIFA World Cup Trophy&quot;, was introduced in 1974. Made of 18 karat gold with bands of malachite on its base, it stands high and weighs . The trophy was made by the GDE Bertoni company in Italy. It depicts two human figures holding up the Earth. The current holders of the trophy are Argentina, winners of the 2022 World Cup.

Only a selected few are officially allowed to touch the trophy with bare hands, including players and managers who have won the competition, heads of state, and FIFA officials.

== Jules Rimet Trophy ==
The Jules Rimet Cup was the original trophy of the FIFA World Cup. Originally called &quot;Victory&quot;, but generally known simply as the &quot;World Cup&quot; or &quot;Coupe du Monde&quot;, it was renamed in 1946 to honour the FIFA President Jules Rimet, who in 1929 passed a vote to initiate the competition. It was designed by French sculptor Abel Lafleur and made of gold-plated sterling silver on a lapis lazuli base. In 1954 the base was replaced with a taller version to accommodate more winners&#x27; details. It stood 35 centimetres (14 in) high and weighed 3.8 kilograms (8.4 lb).
It comprised a decagonal cup, supported by a winged figure representing Nike, the ancient Greek goddess of victory. The Jules Rimet Trophy was taken to Uruguay for the first FIFA World Cup aboard the &quot;Conte Verde&quot;, which set sail from Villefranche-sur-Mer, just southeast of Nice, in June 1930. This was the same ship that carried Jules Rimet and the footballers representing France, Romania, and Belgium who were participating in the tournament that year. The first team to be awarded the trophy was Uruguay, the winners of the 1930 World Cup.

During World War II, the trophy was held by 1938 champion Italy. Ottorino Barassi, the Italian vice-president of FIFA and president of FIGC, secretly transported the trophy from a bank in Rome and hid it in a shoe-box under his bed to prevent the Nazis from taking it. The 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden marked the beginning of a tradition regarding the trophy. As Brazilian captain Hilderaldo Bellini heard photographers&#x27; requests for a better view of the Jules Rimet Trophy, he lifted it up in the air. Every cup-winning captain since has repeated the gesture.

On 20 March 1966, four months before the 1966 FIFA World Cup in England, the trophy was stolen during a public exhibition at Westminster Central Hall. It was found seven days later wrapped in newspaper at the bottom of a suburban garden hedge in Beulah Hill, Upper Norwood, South London, by a black and white collie dog named Pickles.

As a security measure, The Football Association secretly manufactured a replica of the trophy for use in exhibitions rather than the original. This replica was used on occasions up until 1970 when the original trophy had to be handed back to FIFA for the next competition. Since FIFA had explicitly denied the FA permission to create a replica, the replica also had to disappear from public view and was for many years kept under its creator&#x27;s bed. This replica was sold at an auction in 1997 for £254,500, when it was purchased by FIFA. The high auction price, 10 times the reserve price of £20,000–30,000, was led by speculation that the auctioned trophy was not the replica trophy but the original itself. Testing by FIFA confirmed the auctioned trophy was a replica. Soon afterwards FIFA arranged for the replica to be lent for display at the English National Football Museum, which was then based in Preston but is now in Manchester.

The Brazilian team won the tournament for the third time in 1970, allowing them to keep the real trophy in perpetuity, as had been stipulated by Jules Rimet in 1930. It was put on display at the Brazilian Football Confederation headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, in a cabinet with a front of bullet-proof glass.

On 19 December 1983, the trophy was stolen again. The wooden rear of the cabinet was forced open with a crowbar and the cup was taken. Four men were tried and convicted in absentia for the crime. The trophy has never been recovered, and it is widely believed to have been melted down and sold into gold bars. However, some believe the trophy wasn&#x27;t melted down and was instead sold onto the black market and may still exist.

Only one piece of the Jules Rimet Trophy has been found, the original base, which FIFA had kept in a basement of the federation&#x27;s Zürich headquarters prior to 2015.

The Confederation commissioned a replica of their own, made by Eastman Kodak, using of gold. This replica was presented to Brazilian military president João Figueiredo in 1984.

== New trophy ==
A replacement trophy was commissioned by FIFA for the 1974 World Cup. Fifty-three submissions were received from sculptors in seven countries. Italian artist Silvio Gazzaniga was awarded the commission. The trophy stands tall and is made of of 18 karat (75%) gold, worth approximately US$161,000 in 2018. Its base is in diameter containing two layers of malachite. Chemist Sir Martyn Poliakoff claims that the trophy is hollow, because if it were solid gold, the trophy would weigh and would be too heavy to lift; the trophy&#x27;s original manufacturer also confirmed its hollowness.

Produced by GDE Bertoni in Paderno Dugnano, it depicts two human figures holding up the Earth. Gazzaniga described the trophy thus, &quot;The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory&quot;.

The trophy has the engraving &quot;FIFA World Cup&quot; on its base. After the 1994 FIFA World Cup, a plate was added to the bottom side of the trophy where the names of winning countries are engraved, names therefore not visible when the trophy is standing upright. The original trophy is now permanently kept at the FIFA World Football Museum in Zürich, Switzerland. It only leaves there when it goes on its FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour. It is present at the Final draw for the next World Cup, and on the pitch at the World Cup opening game and Final. The FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour was inaugurated for the 2006 FIFA World Cup competition.

The Cup used to be kept by the winning team until the final draw of the next tournament, however, that is no longer the case. Instead the winners of the tournament receive a bronze replica which is gold-plated rather than solid gold. Likewise, three-time winners keep the replica instead of the original cup. Germany became the first nation to win the new trophy for the third time when they won the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Argentina became the second nation to achieve this feat following their win in Qatar at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

The inscriptions state the year in figures and the name of the winning nation in its national language. For example, &quot;1974 or &quot;1994 . In 2010, the name of the winning nation was engraved as &quot;2010 Spain&quot;, in English, not in Spanish. This was corrected in the new plate made after the 2018 World Cup.

As of 2022, twelve winners have been engraved on the base. The plate is replaced each World Cup cycle and the names of the trophy winners are rearranged into a spiral to accommodate future winners.

<doc id="16384" wikidata="Q23858" url="?curid=16384" title="John Belushi">
<text>John Adam Belushi (; January 24, 1949 – March 5, 1982) was an American comedian, actor, and musician. He was one of seven &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast members of the first season. Along with Chevy Chase, he was arguably the most popular member of the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; ensemble. Belushi had a partnership with Dan Aykroyd. They had first met while at Chicago&#x27;s the Second City comedy club, remaining together as cast members on the inaugural season of the television show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

Born in Chicago to Albanian-American parents, Belushi started his own comedy troupe with Tino Insana and Steve Beshekas, called &quot;The West Compass Trio&quot;. Bernard Sahlins recruited him for The Second City comedy club. Once there he met Aykroyd, Brian Doyle-Murray, and Harold Ramis. In 1975, Chevy Chase and Michael O&#x27;Donoghue recommended Belushi to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; creator and showrunner Lorne Michaels, who accepted him as a new cast member of the show after an audition. Belushi developed a series of characters on the show that reached great success, with an imitation of Henry Kissinger and a portrayal of Ludwig van Beethoven. Belushi appeared in several films such as &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;, &quot;1941&quot;, &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, and &quot;Neighbors&quot;. He also pursued interests in music: with Aykroyd, Lou Marini, Tom Malone, Steve Cropper, Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn, and Paul Shaffer, he founded The Blues Brothers, which led to the film of the same name.

Belushi was dismissed from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; several times and rehired more than once. He died on March 5, 1982 at the age of 33. Cathy Smith confessed to dosing him with a lethal mixture of heroin and cocaine at the Chateau Marmont. Smith was charged with second degree murder, was convicted and sentenced to 15 months in prison. Belushi was honored with a posthumous award of the star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2004.

==Early life==
John Adam Belushi was born to Agnes Demetri (&quot;&quot; Samaras) Belushi and Adam Anastos Belushi in Humboldt Park, Chicago. Agnes was a pharmacy worker, who was born in Ohio to Albanian immigrants from Korçë, Albania. Adam Anastos Belushi was an Albanian immigrant from Qytezë, Albania, the owner of the Fair Oaks restaurant on North Avenue in Chicago.

Belushi was raised in Wheaton along with his three siblings—younger brothers Billy and Jim and sister Marian. He was Eastern Orthodox Christian, attending the Albanian Orthodox Church. He was educated at Wheaton Central High School, where he met his future wife, Judith Jacklin.

In 1965, Belushi formed a band, the Ravens, together with four fellow high-school students (Dick Blasucci, Michael Blasucci, Tony Pavilonis, and Phil Special). They recorded one single, &quot;Listen to Me Now/Jolly Green Giant&quot;. Belushi played drums and sang vocals. The record was not successful, and the band broke up when he enrolled at the College of DuPage. He also attended the University of Wisconsin–Whitewater for a year, that time being the inspiration for the &quot;Animal House&quot; scene of a motorcycle driving up stairs. Belushi acquired the iconic &quot;College&quot; crewneck, worn by his character in &quot;Animal House&quot;, at a print shop when visiting his brother Jim, who attended Southern Illinois University.

==Career==
===The Second City and National Lampoon===
Belushi started his own comedy troupe in Chicago, the West Compass Trio (named after the improvisational cabaret revue Compass Players active from 1955 to 1958 in Chicago), with Tino Insana and Steve Beshekas. Their success piqued the interest of Bernard Sahlins, the founder of The Second City, who asked Belushi to join the cast. At Second City, Belushi met and began working with Harold Ramis, Joe Flaherty, and Brian Doyle-Murray.

In 1972, Belushi was offered a role, together with Chevy Chase and Christopher Guest, in &quot;National Lampoon Lemmings&quot;, a parody of Woodstock, which played off-Broadway in 1972. Belushi and Jacklin moved to New York City. There, Belushi started working as a writer, director, and actor for &quot;The National Lampoon Radio Hour&quot;, a comedy radio show that was created, produced, and written by staff from &quot;National Lampoon&quot; magazine. Cast members on the shows produced by Belushi included Ramis, Flaherty, Guest, Brian Doyle Murray, his brother Bill Murray, Gilda Radner, and Richard Belzer. In 1974, Belushi and Chevy Chase voice-acted on a Lampoon LP record, the &quot;Official National Lampoon Stereo Test and Demonstration Record&quot;. During a trip to Toronto in 1974, Belushi met Dan Aykroyd. Jacklin became an associate producer for the show, and she and Belushi were married on December 31, 1976. &quot;The National Lampoon Show&quot; toured the country in 1974; it was produced by Ivan Reitman. &quot;Lampoon&quot; owner Matty Simmons was offered a TV show on NBC at this time, but he declined the offer.

===&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;===
In 1975, Chase and writer Michael O&#x27;Donoghue recommended Belushi to Lorne Michaels as a potential member for a television show Michaels was about to produce for NBC called &quot;NBC&#x27;s Saturday Night&quot;, later &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Michaels was initially undecided, as he was not sure if Belushi&#x27;s physical humor would fit with what he was envisioning, but he changed his mind after giving Belushi an audition. He appeared alongside O&#x27;Donoghue in &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;&#x27;s first sketch (subsequently titled &quot;the Wolverines&quot;) which aired on October 11, 1975. 

Over his four-year tenure at &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; Belushi developed a series of successful characters, including the belligerent &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; Samurai; Henry Kissinger; Ludwig van Beethoven; the Greek owner (Pete Dionisopoulos) of the Olympia Café; Captain James T. Kirk; and a contributor of furious opinion pieces on &quot;Weekend Update&quot;, during which he coined a catchphrase, &quot;But N-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O!&quot; With Aykroyd, Belushi created Jake and Elwood, the Blues Brothers. Originally intended to warm up the studio audience before broadcasts of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, the Blues Brothers were eventually featured as musical guests. Belushi also reprised his Lemmings imitation of Joe Cocker. Cocker himself joined Belushi in 1976 to sing &quot;Feelin&#x27; Alright?&quot; together.

Like many other &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast members and writers, Belushi had health issues. He attended concerts including Fleetwood Mac, Meat Loaf, Kiss, The Dead Boys, Warren Zevon, The Grateful Dead, and The Allman Brothers. In 1990, Michaels remembered him as a loyal trouper, to writers, a team player, yet he was fired and rehired at &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s February 2015 appraisal of all 141 &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast members, Belushi received their top ranking. &quot;Belushi was the &#x27;live&#x27; in &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;&quot;, they wrote, &quot;the one who made the show happen on the edge… Nobody embodied the highs and lows of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; like Belushi.&quot;

===Film career===
In 1978, Belushi performed in the films &quot;Old Boyfriends&quot; (directed by Joan Tewkesbury), &quot;Goin&#x27; South&quot; (directed by Jack Nicholson), and &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot; (directed by John Landis). Upon its initial release, &quot;Animal House&quot; received generally mixed reviews from critics, but &quot;Time&quot; magazine and Roger Ebert proclaimed it one of the year&#x27;s best movies. Filmed at a cost of $2.8million, it is one of the most profitable movies of all time, garnering an estimated gross of more than $141million in the form of theatrical rentals and home video, not including merchandising. &quot;Animal House&quot; was written by Doug Kenney, Harold Ramis, and Chris Miller, and followed in the tradition of the Marx Brothers films that featured subversive and satirical plots that took on traditional institutions. Hollywood studios tried to copy the film&#x27;s success without the satire, resulting in a string of &quot;nerds vs. jocks&quot; films in the 1980s with cheap sight gags involving nudity and gross-out humor.

Following the success of the Blues Brothers on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Belushi and Aykroyd, with the help of pianist-arranger Paul Shaffer, assembled studio talent forming a proper band. &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; saxophonist &quot;Blue&quot; Lou Marini and trombonist-saxophonist Tom Malone, who had previously played in Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears were there. At Shaffer&#x27;s suggestion, guitarist Steve Cropper and bassist Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn, the powerhouse combo from Booker T and the M.G.&#x27;s, who played on dozens of hits from Memphis&#x27;s Stax Records during the 1960s, were signed as well. In 1978 the Blues Brothers released their debut album, &quot;Briefcase Full of Blues&quot;, with Atlantic Records. The album reached number 1 on the Billboard 200 and went double platinum. Two singles were released: &quot;Rubber Biscuit&quot;, which reached number 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and &quot;Soul Man&quot;, which reached number 14.

In 1979, Belushi along with Aykroyd left &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. They filmed &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; movie, which conflicted with the schedule of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Michaels also decided to leave at the end of his contract. NBC&#x27;s pressure to use recurring characters was also a factor in their decision. Belushi and Aykroyd made two movies together after leaving: &quot;Neighbors&quot; (directed by John Avildsen), and most notably &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (directed by John Landis). Released in the U.S. on June 20, 1980, &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; received generally negative reviews. It earned just under $5million in its opening weekend, and went on to gross $115.2million in theaters worldwide before its release on home video. The Blues Brothers band toured to promote the film, which led to a third album (and second live album), &quot;Made in America&quot;, recorded at the Universal Amphitheatre in 1980. The track &quot;Who&#x27;s Making Love&quot; peaked at number 39.

The only film Belushi made without Aykroyd following their departure from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; was the romantic comedy &quot;Continental Divide&quot; (directed by Michael Apted). Released in September 1981, it starred Belushi as Chicago hometown hero writer Ernie Souchack (loosely based on newspaper columnist and long-time family friend Mike Royko), who gets an assignment researching a scientist (played by Blair Brown) who studies birds of prey in the remote Rocky Mountains.

By 1981, Belushi had become a fan and advocate of the punk rock band Fear after seeing them perform in several after-hours New York City bars and brought them to Cherokee Studios to record songs for the soundtrack of &quot;Neighbors&quot;. Blues Brothers band member Tom Scott, along with producing partner and Cherokee owner Bruce Robb, initially helped with the session, but later pulled out due to conflicts with Belushi. The session was eventually produced by Cropper. The producers of &quot;Neighbors&quot; refused to use the song in the movie. Belushi, along with O&#x27;Donoghue and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; writer Nelson Lyon, booked Fear to play &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;″s Halloween broadcast on October 31, 1981; the telecast of the performance featured then-novel moshing and stage diving, and was cut short by NBC due to the band&#x27;s profanity. The &quot;New York Post&quot; published an account of these and other sensationalistic details of the event the following day.

Up to his death, Belushi was pursuing movie projects, including an ABSCAM-related caper called &quot;Moon Over Miami&quot;, to be directed by Louis Malle; and a diamond-smuggling caper called &quot;Noble Rot&quot; with Jay Sandrich, based on a script he adapted and rewrote with former &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; writer Don Novello. However, Paramount Studios offered to produce &quot;Noble Rot&quot; only if Belushi starred in &quot;The Joy of Sex&quot;, which would have featured him in a diaper. Aykroyd advised him to turn down &quot;The Joy of Sex&quot; and return to the East Coast, where Aykroyd was writing &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. Belushi also talked about producing a film in a &quot;High Times&quot; tribute article from 1982: &quot;Belushi wanted to give these daring captains courageous of consciousness the credit they deserved, he told me. He wanted to star in a major marijuana movie to be called &quot;Kingpin&quot;. He wanted to play the title role.&quot;

Belushi made a &quot;guest-star appearance&quot; on an episode of the television series &quot;Police Squad!&quot; (1982). Each opening of the show featured a running gag that featured the guest star dying right away. Belushi died shortly before the episode was to air. The scene was cut and replaced by a segment with William Conrad.

==Drug use and death==
Belushi had health issues in the early to mid 1970s due to his drug use. Cocaine was frequently used by the cast and writers of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, but Belushi&#x27;s use quickly got out of control and he was temporarily banned from the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; set. Belushi was aware of warnings that he was headed for an early death, warnings that eventually were mentioned in the 1978 short film &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back in Anger,&quot; in which Belushi ironically is the last surviving member of the cast and remarks &quot;They all thought I’d be the first one to go. I was one of those ‘live fast, die young, leave a good-looking corpse’ types, you know?&quot; During the production of &quot;The Blues Brothers,&quot; director John Landis confronted Belushi in his trailer after finding a stash of cocaine. Belushi tearfully admitted his addiction during the argument. Belushi was also frequently late for his call times and would delay shooting by wandering off set. The production hired Smokey Wendell to prevent Belushi from accessing more drugs. He managed to quit his habit during the production of &quot;Continental Divide&quot;, but severely relapsed during the production of &quot;Neighbors&quot;. 

A few months after the filming on &quot;Neighbors&quot; ended, on the evening of February 28, 1982, he checked in to a bungalow at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. For several days, he frequented various nightclubs on the Sunset Strip and Santa Monica Boulevard.

On March 4, 1982, Belushi visited the Los Angeles office of his long-time manager Bernie Brillstein and asked him for money. Brillstein declined, suspecting that Belushi wanted more drugs. Later that day, Belushi returned and again asked for money while Brillstein was in a meeting. Brillstein was reluctant to rebuke Belushi in front of the other person and gave him the money. In the early morning hours of March 5, 1982, Belushi, while in his Chateau Marmont bungalow, was visited separately by friends Robin Williams and Robert De Niro, as well as Cathy Smith.

Around noon on March 5, 1982, Belushi&#x27;s fitness trainer and occasional bodyguard Bill Wallace arrived at Belushi&#x27;s bungalow at the Chateau Marmont to deliver a typewriter and audio recorder Belushi had requested the previous day and found Belushi dead. He was 33 years old. No one else was present in the bungalow at the time of the discovery. Neither law enforcement nor a representative of the coroner&#x27;s office revealed the details for six days. 

During a preliminary hearing held in September 1985, two pathologists testified that Belushi&#x27;s cause of death was due to an overdose from cocaine and heroin. Ronald Kornblum was acting Los Angeles County Coroner, and Michael Baden was a former coroner from New York City testifying as an expert witness.

Cathy Smith was arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department on March 5, 1982 for possession of narcotics. This arrest was not in relation to Belushi&#x27;s death. Later in 1982, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine described the circumstances of her arrest: &quot;On the afternoon of March 5th, Cathy Evelyn Smith had appeared driving the wrong way into the one-way exit of the Chateau Marmont Hotel on Sunset Strip behind the wheel of John Belushi&#x27;s rented red Mercedes… At that moment, a hundred feet away, Belushi lay naked and dead on the floor of his $200-a-day bungalow. The police who had cordoned off the area were reflexively insisting it had been &#x27;death from natural causes&#x27;.&quot; The LAPD released Smith after questioning.

In an interview with the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; in May 1982, Smith admitted that she had been with Belushi at the Chateau Marmont on the night of his death. After the appearance of the &quot;Enquirer&quot; article, Smith was extradited from Canada, and charged with second degree murder. The case delayed for four years while her lawyers negotiated. Smith pled no contest June 11, 1986, to involuntary manslaughter and three counts of furnishing and administering controlled substances to Belushi in the hours before he was found dead. She served fifteen months in prison at Chino, California Institution for Women. 

Belushi&#x27;s widow Judith arranged for a traditional Orthodox Christian funeral that was conducted by an Albanian Orthodox priest.

===Burial===
Belushi was interred at Abel&#x27;s Hill Cemetery in Chilmark, Massachusetts, on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. Belushi&#x27;s tombstone has a skull and crossbones with the inscription, &quot;I may be gone but Rock and Roll lives on.&quot;

After the success of &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, his fame further escalated after his death. Members of his family, along with Chilmark officials, gradually became more concerned over his gravesite becoming a tourist attraction like that of Jim Morrison. Reports increased of excess noise, damaging grass and disturbing the peace of others buried there, along with fans paying bizarre tributes by littering his gravesite with liquor bottles, beer cans, and other paraphernalia. His widow arranged to have him reinterred in an unmarked grave near the original site. The tombstone of Belushi&#x27;s mother at Elmwood Cemetery (River Grove, Illinois), has Belushi&#x27;s name inscribed on it and thus serves as a cenotaph.

Belushi was scheduled to present the Best Visual Effects Oscar at the 1982 Academy Awards with Dan Aykroyd. Aykroyd presented the award alone, and stated from the lectern: &quot;My partner, he would have loved to have been here tonight to present this award, since he was somewhat of a visual effect himself.&quot;

When Elizabeth Taylor learned of Belushi&#x27;s death, she referenced his comedic impersonation of her on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1978, when she had been overweight, by sardonically remarking that he had gone &quot;to such great lengths to satirize my excesses and then died of his own&quot;.

==Tributes, legacy, and popular culture==
During the first live &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; episode following Belushi&#x27;s death with host Robert Urich and musical guest Mink DeVille, airing live on March 20, 1982, cast member Brian Doyle-Murray gave a tribute to him. During the preproduction of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, Reitman remarked that Slimer bore a resemblance to Belushi&#x27;s character Bluto from &quot;Animal House&quot;. Since then, Slimer has been described as &quot;the ghost of John Belushi&quot; by Aykroyd in many interviews.

Belushi&#x27;s life was detailed in two books: the 1984 biography &quot;Wired: The Short Life and Fast Times of John Belushi&quot; by Bob Woodward, the accuracy of which has been questioned by journalists and by people close to Belushi, and the 1990 memoir &quot;Samurai Widow&quot; by his widow Judith. Woodward&#x27;s book was adapted into a film of the same name in 1989, which was denounced by Aykroyd and Judith, and was given poor reviews by critics. Belushi&#x27;s career and death were prominently featured in the 1999 memoir of his manager Bernie Brillstein, who wrote that he was haunted by the comedian&#x27;s death. He wrote that he learned how to better deal with clients.

Eddie Money wrote &quot;Passing by the Graveyard (Song for John B.)&quot;, from his 1982 album &quot;No Control&quot;, in tribute to Belushi. The two became friends after Money was a musical guest on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; during the show&#x27;s third season. The thrash metal group Anthrax penned a song about Belushi on their 1987 album &quot;Among the Living&quot;, titled &quot;Efilnikufesin (N.F.L.)&quot;. Polish rock band Lady Pank recorded a song &quot;John Belushi&quot; for their 1988 album &quot;Tacy sami&quot;, with references to his Albanian ancestry.

Belushi was portrayed in biographical films by actors Tyler Labine, Michael Chiklis and John Gemberling. Chris Farley, who was heavily influenced by Belushi, died in 1997 at age 33 due to a drug overdose, which has fueled many comparisons between Belushi and Farley.
In 2004, Belushi was posthumously inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a motion pictures star located at 6355 Hollywood Boulevard. In 2006, Biography Channel aired an episode of &quot;Final 24&quot;, a documentary following Belushi during the last 24 hours leading to his death. Four years later, Biography aired a full documentary of Belushi&#x27;s life. In 2015, Belushi was ranked by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as the greatest &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast member of all time.

Belushi&#x27;s widow later remarried and became Judith Jacklin Belushi Pisano. However, she and her second husband, Victor Pisano, divorced in 2010. Biographer Tanner Colby produced &quot;&quot;, a collection of first-person interviews and photographs of Belushi&#x27;s life, in 2005.

&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; castmate Jane Curtin, who appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; in 2011, stated that Belushi was a misogynist who would deliberately sabotage the work of female writers and comics while working on the show: &quot;So you&#x27;d go to a table read, and if a woman writer had written a piece for John, he would not read it in his full voice. He felt as though it was his duty to sabotage pieces written by women.&quot; &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; writer Anne Beatts suggested that because she was writing a book with his wife at the time, Belushi was frustrated with them spending more time on the book than with him. He complained to Michaels about Beatts and Rosie Shuster. Judith said that Belushi was a &quot;Women&#x27;s Libber&quot; and did not hate women.

Judith, who worked to keep Belushi’s legacy alive and who was credited for her role in assisting Belushi and Dan Aykroyd with &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, died in July 2024.

<text>Johann Philipp Abelin was a German chronicler whose career straddled the 16th and 17th centuries. He was born, probably, at Strasbourg, and died there between 1634 and 1637. He wrote numerous histories under the pseudonyms of Abeleus, Philipp Arlanibäus, Johann Ludwig Gottfried and Gotofredus.

==Publications==
He worked mainly as a translator for the publishing house of Lucas Jennisius, Matthäus Merian and Friedrich Hulsius in Frankfurt. Some of his works, such as a history of India, proved later to be translations of other works. His own works consisted mainly of compilations of historical records.

===Own works===
Abelin produced compilations of contemporary records and letters about the events of the wars of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden without further historical commentary:
*&quot;Arma Suecica&quot;, 1631–1634, in 12 parts
*&quot;Inventarium Sueciae&quot;, 1632
In the same style, his best known work was &quot;Theatrum Europaeum&quot;, a series of chronicles of the chief events in the history of the world down to 1619, reedited, updated and republished several times, including a translation into Dutch. Its coincidence with the needs and tastes of the time, made it a very popular work. Abelin was responsible for the first two volumes. It was continued by various writers and grew to 21 volumes (1633–1738). However, the main interest of the volumes are the beautiful copperplate engraved illustrations of Matthäus Merian (1593–1650).

===Derivative works===
*&quot;Historia Antipodum&quot;, 1655, a translation of a history of the West Indies
*&quot;Archontologia Cosmicum&quot;, translation and revision of Petrus d&#x27;Avirth&#x27;s &quot;Monde&quot;

<text>Jacob Abendana (1630 – 12 September 1685) was &quot;hakham&quot; of London from 1680 until his death.

== Biography ==
Abendana was the eldest son of Joseph Abendana and brother to Isaac Abendana. Though his family originally lived in Hamburg, Jacob and his brother were both born in Spain. At some point in time, his family moved to Amsterdam where he studied at the &quot;De los Pintos&quot; rabbinical academy in Rotterdam. In 1655, he was appointed &quot;hakham&quot; of that city. On 3 May 1655 Abendana delivered a famous memorial sermon on the Cordovan martyrs Marranos Nunez and Almeyda Bernal who had been burned at the stake.

Several years later, with his brother, Isaac, Jacob published the Bible commentary &quot;Miklal Yofi&quot; by Solomon ben Melekh which included his own commentary, &quot;Lekket Shikchah&quot; (Gleanings), on the Pentateuch, the Book of Joshua, and part of the Book of Judges. This was published by subscription in Amsterdam in 1660 with a second edition in 1685.

Having gone to Leiden seeking subscribers, Jacob met Antonius Hulsius whom he helped in his studies. Hulsius tried to convert Abendana to Christianity which began a lifelong correspondence between the two. The Abendana brothers similarly impressed other Christian scholars, such as Johannes Buxtorf (Basel), Johann Coccejus (Leyden), and Jacob Golius (Leyden).

With Hulsius, Abendana entered into a polemical discussion of Biblical verse Haggai 2:9, which Hulsius attempted to prove was a reference to the Church. The debate lasted via correspondence from 24 September 1659 to 16 June 1660. Abendana responded with a Spanish translation of Rabbi Judah Halevi&#x27;s &quot;Kuzari&quot; in 1663. Hulsius eventually published the correspondence between the two in 1669.

In 1675, Abendana addressed the community at the dedication of the new synagogue in Amsterdam. Five years later, in 1680, he was brought to London to succeed Joshua da Silva as &quot;hakham&quot; of London where he served for 15 years as the hakham of the Bevis Marks Synagogue in London. Over the following years, he completed a Spanish-language translation of the Mishnah, along with the commentaries of Maimonides and Obadiah of Bertinoro. The work was frequently cited by Christian theologians, though it was never published. Jacob Abendana died in London in 1685 and was buried in the Portuguese cemetery at Mile End.

<doc id="16388" wikidata="Q3806588" url="?curid=16388" title="James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Abercorn">
<text>James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Abercorn (1575–1618), was a Scottish diplomat for James VI and an undertaker (a term for a British colonist) in the Plantation of Ulster in the north of Ireland.

== Birth and origins ==









James was born on 12 August 1575, probably at Paisley, Scotland, the eldest son of Claud Hamilton and his wife Margaret Seton. At that time his father was only a younger brother of the 3rd Earl of Arran, but he would on 24 July 1587 be created Lord Paisley. His paternal grandfather was the 2nd Earl of Arran in the Peerage of Scotland and the Duke of Châtellerault in the Kingdom of France. His father&#x27;s family descended from Walter FitzGilbert, the founder of the House of Hamilton, who had received the barony of Cadzow from Robert the Bruce.

James&#x27;s mother was a daughter of the 7th Lord Seton. His parents had married in 1574 at Niddry Castle, West Lothian, Scotland. Both sides of the family were Scottish, Catholic, and supporters of Mary, Queen of Scots. His father and his father-in-law had both fought for her at Langside in 1568.

As eldest son he was given the courtesy title of Master of Paisley after the Scottish habit. George had four brothers and one sister, who are listed in his father&#x27;s article.

== Marriage and children ==
Shortly before or in 1592, Master Paisley married Marion, daughter of Thomas Boyd, 6th Lord Boyd. Marion was a prominent Roman Catholic and would in 1628 be excommunicated by the synod of the Church of Scotland in Glasgow after his death.
James and Marion had nine children, five boys:
# James (c. 1603 – c. 1670), succeeded as the 2nd Earl of Abercorn
# Claud (died 1638), established himself in Ireland
# William (died 1681), was created Baronet Hamilton of Westport and represented Henrietta Maria, Charles I&#x27;s widow, at the pope
# George (c. 1608 – 1679), was created Baronet Hamilton of Donalong
# Alexander (died before 4 May 1669), founded the German branch of the family

—and four girls:
# Anne (1592–1620), married Hugh Sempill, 5th Lord Sempill in 1611
# Margaret (died 1642), married Sir William Cunninghame of Caprington
# Isobel (1600–1620)
# Lucy (born before 1618), for whom a marriage was arranged with Randal MacDonnell, 1st Marquess of Antrim, but the wedding never took place

== Life in Scotland ==
In 1597, Master Paisley sat for Linlithgow in the Parliament of Scotland. He was also made a Gentleman of the Bedchamber and a member of the Privy Council to James VI of Scotland. In 1600, the King created him hereditary Sheriff of Linlithgow.
On 24 March 1603 James VI also became King of England as James I and from there on reigned both kingdoms in personal union.

On 5 April 1603, Master Paisley was created Lord Abercorn, of Linlithgowshire. This made him the first of the long line of earls, then marquesses, and finally dukes of Abercorn.

His wife was a close friend of Anne of Denmark. In May 1603 Anne of Denmark came to Stirling Castle hoping to collect her son Prince Henry, who was in the keeping of the Earl of Mar. Anne fainted at dinner and when Jean Drummond and Marion Boyd, Mistress of Paisley, carried her to bed she had a miscarriage. The lawyer Thomas Haddington wrote an account of these events, and said the queen had told her physician Martin Schöner and the Mistress of Paisley that she had taken &quot;some balm water that hastened her abort&quot;.

In 1604, Lord Abercorn, as he was now, served on a royal commission established to consider the union of the crowns of England and Scotland. Though the project failed, the king was content with his services. He received large grants of lands in Scotland.

On 10 July 1606 he was further honoured by being created Earl of Abercorn, Baron Paisley, Baron Hamilton, Baron Mountcastell, and Baron Kilpatrick. The family tree shows how the Abercorn title was inherited moving at the death of the 3rd Earl to the descendants of the 2nd son, Claud, and then at the death of the 5th Earl to the descendants of his 4th son, George.

== Plantation of Ulster ==
Lord Abercorn, as he was now, and his brothers Claud and George were undertakers in James I&#x27;s Plantation of Ulster. He does not appear on the list of undertaker of 1609, but on the list of 1611 he is granted the great proportion of Donalong (2000 acres) and the small proportion of Strabane (1000 acres). He acquired the middle (medium-sized) proportion of Shean from Boyd at a later time. He was given pieces of land called Strabane, Donnalonge and Shean in County Tyrone that had been confiscated from the O&#x27;Neill clan. He built a castle at Strabane. His brother Claude, called &quot;of Shawfield&quot;, was given land in County Cavan.

On 11 March 1613/4, he was summoned to attend the Parliament of Ireland and was granted the precedence of an earl in Ireland (confirmed by royal warrant on 31 March), although he had never been created a peer in that realm. He was appointed to the Council of Munster on 20 May 1615.

== Death, succession, and timeline ==
Lord Abercorn died on 23 March 1618, at Monkton, Ayrshire, Scotland, predeceasing his father and was buried on 29 April 1618 in Paisley Abbey church.

He predeceased his father by three years and therefore never became Lord Paisley, but, having been created Earl of Abercorn, he did not miss this title. His eldest son, James, aged 14, succeeded him as the 2nd Earl of Abercorn. His widow died in Edinburgh in 1632. His brother, Sir George Hamilton of Greenlaw and Roscrea, helped to bring up the children and to convert them to the Catholic religion.

<text>A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode. The JVM is detailed by a specification that formally describes what is required in a JVM implementation. Having a specification ensures interoperability of Java programs across different implementations so that program authors using the Java Development Kit (JDK) need not worry about idiosyncrasies of the underlying hardware platform.

The JVM reference implementation is developed by the OpenJDK project as open source code and includes a JIT compiler called HotSpot. The commercially supported Java releases available from Oracle are based on the OpenJDK runtime. Eclipse OpenJ9 is another open source JVM for OpenJDK.

==JVM specification==
The Java virtual machine is an abstract (virtual) computer defined by a specification. It is a part of the Java runtime environment. The garbage collection algorithm used and any internal optimization of the Java virtual machine instructions (their translation into machine code) are not specified. The main reason for this omission is to not unnecessarily constrain implementers. Any Java application can be run only inside some concrete implementation of the abstract specification of the Java virtual machine.

Starting with Java Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) 5.0, changes to the JVM specification have been developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 924. , changes to the specification to support changes proposed to the class file format (JSR 202) are being done as a maintenance release of JSR 924. The specification for the JVM was published as the &quot;blue book&quot;, whose preface states:
One of Oracle&#x27;s JVMs is named HotSpot; the other, inherited from BEA Systems, is JRockit. Oracle owns the Java trademark and may allow its use to certify implementation suites as fully compatible with Oracle&#x27;s specification.

===Class loader===

One of the organizational units of JVM byte code is a class. A class loader implementation must be able to recognize and load anything that conforms to the Java class file format. Any implementation is free to recognize other binary forms besides &quot;class&quot; files, but it must recognize &quot;class&quot; files.

The class loader performs three basic activities in this strict order:

#Loading: finds and imports the binary data for a type
#Linking: performs verification, preparation, and (optionally) resolution
#*Verification: ensures the correctness of the imported type
#*Preparation: allocates memory for class variables and initializing the memory to default values
#*Resolution: transforms symbolic references from the type into direct references. 
#Initialization: invokes Java code that initializes class variables to their proper starting values.

In general, there are three types of class loader: bootstrap class loader, extension class loader and System / Application class loader.

Every Java virtual machine implementation must have a bootstrap class loader that is capable of loading trusted classes, as well as an extension class loader or application class loader. The Java virtual machine specification does not specify how a class loader should locate classes.

===Virtual machine architecture===
The JVM operates on specific types of data as specified in Java Virtual Machine specifications. The data types can be divided into primitive types (integers, Floating-point, long etc.) and Reference types. The earlier JVM were only 32-bit machines. codice_1 and codice_2 types, which are 64-bits, are supported natively, but consume two units of storage in a frame&#x27;s local variables or operand stack, since each unit is 32 bits. codice_3, codice_4, codice_5, and codice_6 types are all sign-extended (except codice_6 which is zero-extended) and operated on as 32-bit integers, the same as codice_8 types. The smaller types only have a few type-specific instructions for loading, storing, and type conversion. codice_3 is operated on as 8-bit codice_4 values, with 0 representing codice_11 and 1 representing codice_12. (Although codice_3 has been treated as a type since &quot;The Java Virtual Machine Specification, Second Edition&quot; clarified this issue, in compiled and executed code there is little difference between a codice_3 and a codice_4 except for name mangling in method signatures and the type of boolean arrays. codice_3s in method signatures are mangled as codice_17 while codice_4s are mangled as codice_19. Boolean arrays carry the type codice_20 but use 8 bits per element, and the JVM has no built-in capability to pack booleans into a bit array, so except for the type they perform and behave the same as codice_4 arrays. In all other uses, the codice_3 type is effectively unknown to the JVM as all instructions to operate on booleans are also used to operate on codice_4s.) However, newer JVM releases, such as the OpenJDK HotSpot JVM, support 64-bit architecture. Consequently, you can install a 32-bit or 64-bit JVM on a 64-bit operating system. The primary advantage of running Java in a 64-bit environment is the larger address space. This allows for a much larger Java heap size and an increased maximum number of Java Threads, which is needed for certain kinds of large applications; however there is a performance hit in using 64-bit JVM compared to 32-bit JVM.

The JVM has a garbage-collected heap for storing objects and arrays. Code, constants, and other class data are stored in the &quot;method area&quot;. The method area is logically part of the heap, but implementations may treat the method area separately from the heap, and for example might not garbage collect it. Each JVM thread also has its own call stack (called a &quot;Java Virtual Machine stack&quot; for clarity), which stores frames. A new frame is created each time a method is called, and the frame is destroyed when that method exits.

Each frame provides an &quot;operand stack&quot; and an array of &quot;local variables&quot;. The operand stack is used for operands to run computations and for receiving the return value of a called method, while local variables serve the same purpose as registers and are also used to pass method arguments. Thus, the JVM is both a stack machine and a register machine. In practice, HotSpot eliminates every stack besides the native thread/call stack even when running in Interpreted mode, as its Templating Interpreter technically functions as a compiler.

===Bytecode instructions===
The JVM has instructions for the following groups of tasks:

The aim is binary compatibility. Each particular host operating system needs its own implementation of the JVM and runtime. These JVMs interpret the bytecode semantically the same way, but the actual implementation may be different. More complex than just emulating bytecode is compatibly and efficiently implementing the Java core API that must be mapped to each host operating system.

These instructions operate on a set of common rather the native data types of any specific instruction set architecture.

===JVM languages===

A JVM language is any language with functionality that can be expressed in terms of a valid class file which can be hosted by the Java Virtual Machine. A class file contains Java Virtual Machine instructions (Java byte code) and a symbol table, as well as other ancillary information. The class file format is the hardware- and operating system-independent binary format used to represent compiled classes and interfaces.

There are several JVM languages, both old languages ported to JVM and completely new languages. JRuby and Jython are perhaps the most well-known ports of existing languages, i.e. Ruby and Python respectively. Of the new languages that have been created from scratch to compile to Java bytecode, Clojure, Groovy, Scala and Kotlin may be the most popular ones. A notable feature with the JVM languages is that they are compatible with each other, so that, for example, Scala libraries can be used with Java programs and vice versa.

Java 7 JVM implements &quot;JSR 292: Supporting Dynamically Typed Languages&quot; on the Java Platform, a new feature which supports dynamically typed languages in the JVM. This feature is developed within the Da Vinci Machine project whose mission is to extend the JVM so that it supports languages other than Java.

===Bytecode verifier===
A basic philosophy of Java is that it is inherently safe from the standpoint that no user program can crash the host machine or otherwise interfere inappropriately with other operations on the host machine, and that it is possible to protect certain methods and data structures belonging to trusted code from access or corruption by untrusted code executing within the same JVM. Furthermore, common programmer errors that often led to data corruption or unpredictable behavior such as accessing off the end of an array or using an uninitialized pointer are not allowed to occur. Several features of Java combine to provide this safety, including the class model, the garbage-collected heap, and the verifier.

The JVM verifies all bytecode before it is executed. This verification consists primarily of three types of checks:

* Branches are always to valid locations
* Data is always initialized and references are always type-safe
* Access to private or package private data and methods is rigidly controlled

The first two of these checks take place primarily during the verification step that occurs when a class is loaded and made eligible for use. The third is primarily performed dynamically, when data items or methods of a class are first accessed by another class.

The verifier permits only some bytecode sequences in valid programs, e.g. a jump (branch) instruction can only target an instruction within the same method. Furthermore, the verifier ensures that any given instruction operates on a fixed stack location, allowing the JIT compiler to transform stack accesses into fixed register accesses. Because of this, that the JVM is a stack architecture does not imply a speed penalty for emulation on register-based architectures when using a JIT compiler. In the face of the code-verified JVM architecture, it makes no difference to a JIT compiler whether it gets named imaginary registers or imaginary stack positions that must be allocated to the target architecture&#x27;s registers. In fact, code verification makes the JVM different from a classic stack architecture, of which efficient emulation with a JIT compiler is more complicated and typically carried out by a slower interpreter. Additionally, the Interpreter used by the default JVM is a special type known as a Template Interpreter, which translates bytecode directly to native, register based machine language rather than emulate a stack like a typical interpreter. In many aspects the HotSpot Interpreter can be considered a JIT compiler rather than a true interpreter, meaning the stack architecture that the bytecode targets is not actually used in the implementation, but merely a specification for the intermediate representation that can well be implemented in a register based architecture. Another instance of a stack architecture being merely a specification and implemented in a register based virtual machine is the Common Language Runtime.

The original specification for the bytecode verifier used natural language that was incomplete or incorrect in some respects. A number of attempts have been made to specify the JVM as a formal system. By doing this, the security of current JVM implementations can more thoroughly be analyzed, and potential security exploits prevented. It will also be possible to optimize the JVM by skipping unnecessary safety checks, if the application being run is proven to be safe.

====Secure execution of remote code====
A virtual machine architecture allows very fine-grained control over the actions that code within the machine is permitted to take. It assumes the code is &quot;semantically&quot; correct, that is, it successfully passed the (formal) bytecode verifier process, materialized by a tool, possibly off-board the virtual machine. This is designed to allow safe execution of untrusted code from remote sources, a model used by Java applets, and other secure code downloads. Once bytecode-verified, the downloaded code runs in a restricted &quot;sandbox&quot;, which is designed to protect the user from misbehaving or malicious code. As an addition to the bytecode verification process, publishers can purchase a certificate with which to digitally sign applets as safe, giving them permission to ask the user to break out of the sandbox and access the local file system, clipboard, execute external pieces of software, or network.

Formal proof of bytecode verifiers have been done by the Javacard industry (Formal Development of an Embedded Verifier for Java Card Byte Code)

===Bytecode interpreter and just-in-time compiler===
For each hardware architecture a different Java bytecode interpreter is needed. When a computer has a Java bytecode interpreter, it can run any Java bytecode program, and the same program can be run on any computer that has such an interpreter.

When Java bytecode is executed by an interpreter, the execution will always be slower than the execution of the same program compiled into native machine language. This problem is mitigated by just-in-time (JIT) compilers for executing Java bytecode. A JIT compiler may translate Java bytecode into native machine language while executing the program. The translated parts of the program can then be executed much more quickly than they could be interpreted. This technique gets applied to those parts of a program frequently executed. This way a JIT compiler can significantly speed up the overall execution time.

There is no necessary connection between the Java programming language and Java bytecode. A program written in Java can be compiled directly into the machine language of a real computer and programs written in other languages than Java can be compiled into Java bytecode.

Java bytecode is intended to be platform-independent and secure. Some JVM implementations do not include an interpreter, but consist only of a just-in-time compiler.

==JVM in the web browser==
At the start of the Java platform&#x27;s lifetime, the JVM was marketed as a web technology for creating Rich Web Applications. , most web browsers and operating systems bundling web browsers do not ship with a Java plug-in, nor do they permit side-loading any non-Flash plug-in. The Java browser plugin was deprecated in JDK 9.

The NPAPI Java browser plug-in was designed to allow the JVM to execute so-called Java applets embedded into HTML pages. For browsers with the plug-in installed, the applet is allowed to draw into a rectangular region on the page assigned to it. Because the plug-in includes a JVM, Java applets are not restricted to the Java programming language; any language targeting the JVM may run in the plug-in. A restricted set of APIs allow applets access to the user&#x27;s microphone or 3D acceleration, although applets are not able to modify the page outside its rectangular region. Adobe Flash Player, the main competing technology, works in the same way in this respect.

 according to W3Techs, Java applet and Silverlight use had fallen to 0.1% each for all web sites, while Flash had fallen to 10.8%.

===JavaScript JVMs and interpreters===
Since May 2016, JavaPoly allows users to import unmodified Java libraries, and invoke them directly from JavaScript. JavaPoly allows websites to use unmodified Java libraries, even if the user does not have Java installed on their computer.

===Transpilation to JavaScript===
With the continuing improvements in JavaScript execution speed, combined with the increased use of mobile devices whose web browsers do not implement support for plugins, there are efforts to target those users through transpilation to JavaScript. It is possible to either transpile the source code or JVM bytecode to JavaScript.

Compiling the JVM bytecode, which is universal across JVM languages, allows building upon the language&#x27;s existing compiler to bytecode. The main JVM bytecode to JavaScript transpilers are TeaVM, the compiler contained in Dragome Web SDK, Bck2Brwsr, and j2js-compiler.

Leading transpilers from JVM languages to JavaScript include the Java-to-JavaScript transpiler contained in Google Web Toolkit, Clojurescript (Clojure), GrooScript (Apache Groovy), Scala.js (Scala) and others.

<doc id="16390" wikidata="Q581552" url="?curid=16390" title="John Abercrombie (physician)">
<text>John Abercrombie (10 October 1780 – 14 November 1844) was a Scottish physician, author, philosopher and philanthropist. His Edinburgh practice became one of the most successful medical practices in Scotland. The &quot;Chambers Biographical Dictionary&quot; says of him that after James Gregory&#x27;s death, he was &quot;recognized as the first consulting physician in Scotland&quot;. As surgeon to The Royal Public Dispensary and the New Town Dispensary he provided free medical care for the poor of the town and taught medical students and apprentices. He published extensively on medical topics and latterly on metaphysics morality and religion. A devout Christian, he gave financial support to missionary work. Abercrombie was awarded the honorary degree of MD from the University of Oxford, was elected Rector of Marischal College and University, Aberdeen and appointed Physician to the King in Scotland.

==Early life==

He was born in Aberdeen the eldest son of Rev George Abercrombie (1713-1790), the minister of East Church, Aberdeen, and his second wife Barbara Morice (d.1824). His father was to have a profound influence on his character and beliefs. After schooling at Aberdeen Grammar School he studied at Marischal College, in Aberdeen, where he graduated Master of Arts (MA) at the age of 15. He went on to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh obtaining his doctorate MD in 1803.

== Medical career ==
After graduating he went for further study at St George&#x27;s Hospital in London and, returning to Edinburgh, set up in practice at 8 Nicolson Street, next to the Edinburgh Riding School, which in 1832 was to become the site of the Playfair building of the present Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (RCSEd). In 1804 he became a Fellow of the RCSEd. His general practice rapidly became popular and in 1805 he became surgeon to the Royal. Public Dispensary in nearby Richmond Street. Here he provided free medical care for the poor of the locality and gave instruction to medical student and apprentices. By dividing the city into geographical sectors and assigning his trainees to different sectors he began a systematic training system for these trainees. In 1816 he was appointed surgeon to the newly established New Town Dispensary. From the outset he kept detailed notes on all of his patients, an unusual practice at that time. These were to form the basis for his many clinical publications, which further enhanced his reputation. From 1816 he published various papers in the &quot;Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal&quot;, which formed the basis of his more extensive works: &quot;Pathological and Practical Researches on Diseases of the Brain and Spinal Cord&quot;, regarded as the first textbook in neuropathology, and &quot;Researches on the Diseases of the Intestinal Canal, Liver and other Viscera of the Abdomen&quot;, both published in 1828. In the latter book described for the first time the symptoms and signs of perforated duodenal ulcer. This was at a time when, it was difficult for physicians to correlate clinical features with pathology. Abercrombie&#x27;s gave the first ever description of the clinical features of perforated duodenal ulcer confirmed by the post-mortem. The specimen showing the perforated ulcer was placed in Surgeons’ Hall Museum where it is on display to this day

In 1821 he was unsuccessful in his application for the Chair of the Practice of Physic at the University of Edinburgh. Thereafter he devoted himself to consulting medical practice. He became a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1823 and a Fellow of the College the following year.

In later years he wrote a series of philosophical speculations, and in 1830 he published his &quot;Inquiries concerning the Intellectual Powers and the Investigation of Truth&quot;, which was followed in 1833 by a sequel, &quot;The Philosophy of the Moral Feelings&quot;. Both works achieved wide popularity at the time of their publication. The Inquiries (1830) has been widely cited in treatises on the law of evidence, due to its discussion of probability, (the sources of) certainty, and (doubts regarding) testimony.

An elder of the Church of Scotland, he also wrote &quot;The man of faith: or the harmony of Christian faith and Christian character&quot; (1835), which he distributed freely. 
Abercrombie was a founder member in 1841of the Edinburgh Association for sending Medical Aid for Foreign Countries, which became the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society, and he gave financial support to its work.

The year after his death his &quot;Essays&quot; (1845) on Christian ethics were published.

== Honours and awards ==
He was President of the Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical Society for four years from 1829. In 1831 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposer being Thomas Charles Hope, and served as Vice-President of the Society from 1835 to 1844. The University of Oxford awarded him the honorary degree of MD (Oxon). This was a rare honour as the only other recipient in the previous 50 years was Edward Jenner. He was elected Lord Rector of Marischal College and University, Aberdeen. He became a member of the French Académie Nationale de Médecine.

== Personal life ==

In 1810 he was living at 43 York Place, Edinburgh. In 1831, while treating his colleague James Crawford Gregory, he contracted and recovered from typhus. In 1841, he was partially paralysed, but was nevertheless able to return to his medical practice.

He died suddenly while entering his carriage at the front of his home, 19 York Place, Edinburgh, 14 November 1844. An autopsy showed that the cause of death was ruptured coronary artery. The pathologist, Adam Hunter, speculated that his death had been brought about by excessive bloodletting. He is buried against the east wall of St Cuthberts Churchyard adjacent to the gateway into Princes Street Gardens.

Upon his death, his daughters donated his Abercrombie&#x27;s library of circa 1000 volumes to the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.

==Artistic recognition==

A bust of Abercrombie by John Steell is held at the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. A portrait by Benjamin Walsh, painted in 1819, hangs in the RCSEd.

<text>The Judgement of Paris is a story from Greek mythology, which was one of the events that led up to the Trojan War, and in later versions to the foundation of Rome.

Eris, the goddess of discord, was not invited to the wedding of Peleus and Thetis. In revenge, she brought a golden apple, inscribed, &quot;To the fairest one&quot;, which she threw into the wedding. Three guests, Hera, Athena and Aphrodite, after some disputation, agreed to have Paris of Troy choose the fairest one. Paris chose Aphrodite, she having bribed him with the most beautiful mortal woman in the world, Helen of Sparta, wife of Menelaus. Consequently, Paris carried Helen off to Troy, and the Greeks invaded Troy for Helen&#x27;s return. Eris&#x27;s Apple of Discord was thus the instrumental &quot;casus belli&quot; (or her not being invited to the wedding in the first place) of the Trojan War. 

==Sources of the episode==

As with many mythological tales, details vary depending on the source. The brief allusion to the Judgement in the &quot;Iliad&quot; (24.25–30) shows that the episode initiating all the subsequent action was already familiar to its audience; a fuller version was told in the &quot;Cypria&quot;, a lost work of the Epic Cycle, of which only fragments (and a reliable summary) remain. The later writers Ovid (&quot;Heroides&quot; 16.71ff, 149–152 and 5.35f), Lucian (&quot;Dialogues of the Gods&quot; 20), Pseudo-Apollodorus (&quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, E.3.2) and Hyginus (&quot;Fabulae&quot; 92), retell the story with skeptical, ironic or popularizing agendas. It appeared wordlessly on the ivory and gold votive chest of the 7th-century BC tyrant Cypselus at Olympia, which was described by Pausanias as showing:

The subject was favoured by ancient Greek vase painters as early as the sixth century BC, and remained popular in Greek and Roman art, before enjoying a significant revival as an opportunity to show three female nudes, in the Renaissance.

==Mythic narrative==

It is recounted that Zeus held a banquet in celebration of the marriage of Peleus and Thetis (parents of Achilles). However, Eris, goddess of discord, was not invited, for it was believed she would have made the party unpleasant for everyone. Angered by this snub, Eris arrived at the celebration with a golden apple from the Garden of the Hesperides, which she threw into the proceedings as a prize of beauty. According to some later versions, upon the apple was the inscription &quot;καλλίστῃ&quot; (&quot;kallistēi&quot;, &quot;To/for the fairest one&quot;).

Three goddesses claimed the apple: Hera, Athena and Aphrodite. They asked Zeus to judge which of them was fairest, and eventually he, reluctant to favour any claim himself, declared that Paris, a Trojan mortal, would judge their cases, for he had recently shown his exemplary fairness in a contest in which Ares in bull form had bested Paris&#x27;s own prize bull, and the shepherd-prince had unhesitatingly awarded the prize to the god.
With Hermes as their guide, the three candidates bathed in the spring of Ida, then met Paris on Mount Ida. While Paris inspected them, each attempted with her powers to bribe him; Hera offered to make him king of Europe and Asia, Athena offered wisdom and skill in war, and Aphrodite, who had the Charites and the Horai to enhance her charms with flowers and song (according to a fragment of the &quot;Cypria&quot; quoted by Athenagoras of Athens), offered the world&#x27;s most beautiful woman (Euripides, &quot;Andromache&quot;, l.284, &quot;Helena&quot; l. 676). This was Helen of Sparta, wife of the Greek king Menelaus. Paris accepted Aphrodite&#x27;s bribe and awarded the apple to her, receiving Helen as well as the enmity of the Greeks and especially of Hera. The Greeks&#x27; expedition to retrieve Helen from Paris in Troy is the mythological basis of the Trojan War. According to some stories, Helen of Troy was kidnapped by Paris and group of Trojans; in others, she simply followed Paris willingly because she felt affection for him, too.

The story of the Judgement of Paris naturally offered artists the opportunity to depict a sort of beauty contest between three beautiful female nudes, but the myth, at least since Euripides, rather concerns a choice among the bribes that each goddess embodies. The bribery involved is ironic and a late ingredient.

According to a tradition suggested by Alfred J. Van Windekens, &quot;cow-eyed&quot; Hera was indeed the most beautiful, before Aphrodite showed up. However, Hera was the goddess of the marital order and of cuckolded wives, amongst other things. She was often portrayed as the shrewish, jealous wife of Zeus, who himself often escaped from her controlling ways by cheating on her with other women, mortal and immortal. She had fidelity and chastity in mind and was careful to be modest when Paris was inspecting her. Aphrodite was the goddess of sexuality, and was effortlessly more sexual and charming than any goddess. Thus, she was able to sway Paris into judging her as the fairest. Athena&#x27;s beauty is rarely commented on in the myths, perhaps because Greeks held her up as an asexual being, able to &quot;overcome&quot; her &quot;womanly weaknesses&quot; to become both wise and talented in war (both considered male domains by the Greeks). Her rage at losing makes her join the Greeks in the battle against Paris&#x27;s Trojans, a key event in the turning point of the war.

==In art==
The subject became popular in art from the late Middle Ages onwards. All three goddesses were usually shown nude, though in ancient art only Aphrodite is ever unclothed, and not always. The opportunity for three female nudes was a large part of the attraction of the subject. It appeared in illuminated manuscripts and was popular in decorative art, including 15th-century Italian inkstands and other works in maiolica, and &quot;cassoni&quot;. As a subject for easel paintings, it was more common in Northern Europe, although Marcantonio Raimondi&#x27;s engraving of c. 1515, probably based on a drawing by Raphael, and using a composition derived from a Roman sarcophagus, was a highly influential treatment, which made Paris&#x27;s Phrygian cap an attribute in most later versions.

The subject was painted many (supposedly 23) times by Lucas Cranach the Elder, and was especially attractive to Northern Mannerist painters. Rubens painted several compositions of the subject at different points in his career. Watteau and Angelica Kauffman were among the artists who painted the subject in the 18th century. The Judgement of Paris was painted frequently by academic artists of the 19th century, and less often by their more progressive contemporaries such as Renoir and Cézanne. Later artists who have painted the subject include André Lhote, Enrique Simonet (&quot;El Juicio de Paris&quot; 1904), and Salvador Dalí.

Ivo Saliger (1939), Adolf Ziegler (1939), and Joseph Thorak (1941) also used the classic myth to propagate German renewal during the Nazi period.

==In other media==
The story is the basis of an opera, &quot;The Judgement of Paris&quot;, with a libretto by William Congreve, that was set to music by four composers in London, 1700–1701. Thomas Arne composed a highly successful score to the same libretto in 1742. The opera &quot;Le Cinesi&quot; (&quot;The Chinese Women&quot;) by Christoph Willibald Gluck (1754) concludes with a ballet, &quot;The Judgement of Paris&quot;, sung as a vocal quartet. Francesco Cilea&#x27;s 1902 opera &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot; also includes a &quot;Judgement of Paris&quot; ballet sequence.

The story is the basis of an earlier opera, &quot;Il pomo d&#x27;oro&quot;, in a prologue and five acts by the Italian composer Antonio Cesti, with a libretto by Francesco Sbarra (1611–1668).

==In Discordianism==
&quot;Kallistēi&quot; is the word of the ancient Greek language inscribed on Eris&#x27;s Apple of Discord. In Greek, the word is &quot;καλλίστῃ&quot; (the dative singular of the feminine superlative of καλος, beautiful). Its meaning can be rendered &quot;to the fairest one&quot;. &quot;Calliste&quot; (Καλλίστη; Mod. Gk. &quot;Kallisti&quot;) is also an ancient name for the isle of Thera.

The word &quot;Kallisti&quot; (Modern Greek) written on a golden apple, has become a principal symbol of Discordianism, a post-modernist religion. In non-philological texts (such as Discordian ones) the word is usually spelled as &quot;καλλιστι&quot;. Most versions of &quot;Principia Discordia&quot; actually spell it as καλλιχτι, but this is definitely incorrect; in the afterword of the 1979 Loompanics edition of &quot;Principia&quot;, Gregory Hill says that was because on the IBM typewriter he used, not all Greek letters coincided with Latin ones, and he didn&#x27;t know enough of the letters to spot the mistake. Zeus&#x27;s failure to invite Eris is referred to as &quot;The Original Snub&quot; in Discordian mythology.

<doc id="16392" wikidata="Q471855" url="?curid=16392" title="Jurisdiction">
<text>Jurisdiction (from Latin &#x27;law&#x27; + &#x27;speech&#x27; or &#x27;declaration&#x27;) is the legal term for the legal authority granted to a legal entity to enact justice. In federations like the United States, the concept of jurisdiction applies at multiple levels (e.g., local, state, and federal).

Jurisdiction draws its substance from international law, conflict of laws, constitutional law, and the powers of the executive and legislative branches of government to allocate resources to best serve the needs of society.

==International dimension==
Generally, international laws and treaties provide agreements which nations agree to be bound to. Such agreements are not always established or maintained. Extraterritorial jurisdiction is exercised through three principles outlined in the UN charter. These are equality of states, territorial sovereignty and non-intervention. This raises questions of when can many states prescribe or enforce jurisdiction. The &quot;Lotus&quot; case establishes two key rules to the prescription and enforcement of jurisdiction. The case outlines that jurisdiction is territorial and that a state may not exercise its jurisdiction in the territory of another state unless there is a rule that permits this. On that same note, states enjoy a wide measure of discretion to prescribe jurisdiction over persons, property and acts within their own territory unless there was a rule that prohibits this.

===Political issue===
Supranational organizations provide mechanisms whereby disputes between nations may be resolved through arbitration or mediation. When a country is recognized as , it is an acknowledgment by the other &quot;&quot; nations that the country has sovereignty and the right to exist.

However, it is often at the discretion of each nation whether to co-operate or participate. If a nation does agree to participate in activities of the supranational bodies and accept decisions, the nation is giving up its sovereign authority and thereby allocating power to these bodies.

Insofar as these bodies or nominated individuals may resolve disputes through judicial or quasi-judicial means, or promote treaty obligations in the nature of laws, the power ceded to these bodies cumulatively represents its own jurisdiction. But no matter how powerful each body may appear to be, the extent to which any of their judgments may be enforced, or proposed treaties and conventions may become, or remain, effective within the territorial boundaries of each nation is a political matter under the sovereign control of each nation.

===International and municipal===
The fact that international organizations, courts and tribunals have been created raises the difficult question of how to co-ordinate their activities with those of national courts. If the two sets of bodies do not have &quot;concurrent&quot; jurisdiction but, as in the case of the International Criminal Court (ICC), the relationship is expressly based on the principle of &quot;complementarity&quot;, i.e., the international court is subsidiary or complementary to national courts, the difficulty is avoided. But if the jurisdiction claimed is concurrent or, as in the case of International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the international tribunal is to prevail over national courts, the problems are more difficult to resolve politically.

The idea of universal jurisdiction is fundamental to the operation of global organizations such as the United Nations and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which jointly assert the benefit of maintaining legal entities with jurisdiction over a wide range of matters of significance to nations (the ICJ should not be confused with the ICC and this version of &quot;universal jurisdiction&quot; is not the same as that enacted in the War Crimes Law (Belgium), which is an assertion of extraterritorial jurisdiction that will fail to gain implementation in any other state under the standard provisions of public policy). Under Article 34 Statute of the ICJ only nations may be parties in cases before the Court and, under Article 36, the jurisdiction comprises all cases which the parties refer to it and all matters specially provided for in the Charter of the United Nations or in treaties and conventions in force. But, to invoke the jurisdiction in any given case, all the parties have to accept the prospective judgment as binding. This reduces the risk of wasting the Court&#x27;s time.

Despite the safeguards built into the constitutions of most of these organizations, courts and tribunals, the concept of universal jurisdiction is controversial among those nations which prefer unilateral to multilateral solutions through the use of executive or military authority, sometimes described as &quot;realpolitik&quot;-based diplomacy.

Within other international contexts, there are intergovernmental organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) that have socially and economically significant dispute resolution functions but, again, even though their jurisdiction may be invoked to hear the cases, the power to enforce their decisions is at the will of the nations affected, save that the WTO is permitted to allow retaliatory action by successful nations against those nations found to be in breach of international trade law. At a regional level, groups of nations can create political and legal bodies with sometimes complicated patchworks of overlapping provisions detailing the jurisdictional relationships between the member states and providing for some degree of harmonization between their national legislative and judicial functions, for example, the European Union and African Union both have the potential to become federated nations although the political barriers to such unification in the face of entrenched nationalism will be very difficult to overcome. Each such group may form transnational institutions with declared legislative or judicial powers. For example, in Europe, the European Court of Justice has been given jurisdiction as the ultimate appellate court to the member states on issues of European law. This jurisdiction is entrenched, and its authority could only be denied by a member nation if that member nation asserts its sovereignty and withdraws from the union.

====Law====
The standard treaties and conventions leave the issue of implementation to each nation, i.e. there is no general rule in international law that treaties have direct effect in municipal law, but some nations, by virtue of their membership of supranational bodies, allow the direct incorporation of rights or enact legislation to honor their international commitments. Hence, citizens in those nations can invoke the jurisdiction of local courts to enforce rights granted under international law wherever there is incorporation. If there is no direct effect or legislation, there are two theories to justify the courts incorporating international into municipal law:
* Monism
:This theory characterizes international and municipal law as a single legal system with municipal law subordinate to international law. Hence, in the Netherlands, all treaties and the orders of international organizations are effective without any action being required to convert international into municipal law. This has an interesting consequence because treaties that limit or extend the powers of the Dutch government are automatically considered a part of their constitutional law, for example, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In nations adopting this theory, the local courts automatically accept jurisdiction to adjudicate on lawsuits relying on international law principles.
* Dualism
:This theory regards international and municipal law as separate systems so that the municipal courts can only apply international law either when it has been incorporated into municipal law or when the courts incorporate international law on their own motion. In the United Kingdom, for example, a treaty is not effective until it has been incorporated, at which time it becomes enforceable in the courts by any private citizen, where appropriate, even against the UK Government. Otherwise the courts have a discretion to apply international law where it does not conflict with statute or the common law. The constitutional principle of parliamentary supremacy permits the legislature to enact any law inconsistent with any international treaty obligations even though the government is a signatory to those treaties.

In the United States, the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution makes all treaties that have been ratified under the authority of the United States and customary international law to be a part of the &quot;Supreme Law of the Land&quot; (along with the Constitution itself and acts of Congress passed pursuant to it) (U.S. Const.art. VI Cl. 2) As such, the law of the land is binding on the federal government as well as on state and local governments. According to the Supreme Court of the United States, the treaty power authorizes Congress to legislate under the Necessary and Proper Clause in areas beyond those specifically conferred on Congress (&quot;Missouri v. Holland&quot;, 252 U.S. 416 (1920)).

===International===
This concerns the relationships both between courts in different jurisdictions, and between courts within the same jurisdiction. The usual legal doctrine under which questions of jurisdiction are decided is termed .

To deal with the issue of forum shopping, nations are urged to adopt more positive rules on conflict of laws. The Hague Conference and other international bodies have made recommendations on jurisdictional matters, but litigants with the encouragement of lawyers on a contingent fee continue to shop for forums.

====Jurisdictional principles====

Under international law there are different principles that are recognized to establish a state&#x27;s ability to exercise criminal jurisdiction when it comes to a person. There is no hierarchy when it comes to any of the principles. States must therefore work together to solve issues of who may exercise their jurisdiction when it comes to issues of multiple principles being allowed. The principles are Territorial Principle, Nationality Principle, Passive Personality Principle, Protective Principle, Universality Principle

Territorial principle: This principle states that the State where the crime has been committed may exercise jurisdiction. This is one of the most straightforward and least controversial of the principles. This is also the only principle that is territorial in nature; all other forms are extraterritorial.

Nationality principle (also known as the Active Personality Principle): This principle is based around a person&#x27;s nationality and allows States to exercise jurisdiction when it comes to their nationality, both within and outside the State&#x27;s territory. Seeing as the territoriality principle already gives the State the right to exercise jurisdiction, this principle is primarily used as a justification for prosecuting crimes committed abroad by a States nationals. There is a growing trend to allow States to also apply this principle to permanent residents abroad as well (for example: Denmark Criminal Code (2005), sec 7; Finland Criminal Code (2015), sec 6; Iceland Criminal Code (2014), art 5; Latvia Criminal Code (2013), sec 4; Netherlands Criminal Code (2019), art 7; Norway Criminal Code (2005), sec 12; Swedish Criminal Code (1999), sec 2; Lithuania Criminal Code (2015), art 5).

Passive Personality Principle: This principle is similar to the Nationality Principle, except you are exercising jurisdiction against a foreign national that has committed a criminal act against its own national. The idea is that a State has a duty to protect its nationals and therefore if someone harms their nationals that State has the right to prosecute the accused.

Protective principle: This principle allows States to exercise jurisdiction when it comes to foreign nationals for acts committed outside their territory that have or are intended to have a prejudicial impact upon the State. It is especially used when it comes to matters of national security.

Universality principle: This is the broadest of all the principles. The basis is that a State has the right, sometimes even the obligation, to exercise jurisdiction when it comes to the most serious violations of international criminal law; for example genocide, crimes against humanity, extrajudicial executions, war crimes, torture, and forced disappearances. This principle also goes further than the other principles as there is attached to it the obligation to either prosecute the accused or extradite them to a State that will, known as .

===Supranational===
At a supranational level, countries have adopted a range of treaty and convention obligations to relate the right of individual litigants to invoke the jurisdiction of national courts and to enforce the judgments obtained. For example, the member nations of the EEC signed the Brussels Convention in 1968 and, subject to amendments as new nations joined, it represents the default law for all twenty-seven Member States of what is now termed the European Union on the relationships between the courts in the different countries. In addition, the Lugano Convention (1988) binds the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.

In effect from 1 March 2002, all the European Union member states except Denmark accepted Council Regulation (EC) 44/2001, which makes major changes to the Brussels Convention and is directly effective in the member nations. Council Regulation (EC) 44/2001 now also applies as between the rest of the EU Member States and Denmark due to an agreement reached between the European Community and Denmark. In some legal areas, at least, the reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgments is now more straightforward. At a national level, the traditional rules still determine jurisdiction over persons who are not domiciled or habitually resident in the European Union or the Lugano area.

===National===
Many nations are subdivided into states or provinces (i.e. a subnational &quot;state&quot;). In a federation—as can be found in Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico, and the United States—such subunits will exercise &quot;jurisdiction&quot; through the court systems as defined by the executives and legislatures.

When the jurisdictions of government entities overlap one another—for example between a state and the federation to which it belongs—their jurisdiction is a &quot;shared&quot; or &quot;concurrent&quot; jurisdiction. Otherwise, one government entity will have exclusive jurisdiction over the shared area. When jurisdiction is concurrent, one government entity may have supreme jurisdiction over the other entity if their laws conflict. If the executive or legislative powers within the jurisdiction are not restricted, or have only limited restrictions, these government branches have plenary power such as a national policing power. Otherwise, an enabling act grants only limited or enumerated powers.

Child custody cases in the U.S. are a prime example of jurisdictional dilemmas caused by different states under a federal alignment. When parents and children are in different states, there is the possibility of different state court orders over-ruling each other. The U.S. solved this problem by adopting the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act. The act established criteria for determining which state has primary jurisdiction, which allows courts to defer the hearing of a case if an appropriate administrative agency determines so.

==United States==
The primary distinctions between areas of jurisdiction are codified at the federal level. In the United States&#x27; common law system, jurisdiction is conceptually divided between jurisdiction over the &quot;subject matter&quot; of a case and personal jurisdiction over the parties to the case.

A court whose subject matter jurisdiction is limited to certain types of controversies (for example, suits in admiralty or suits where the monetary amount sought is less than a specified sum) is sometimes referred to as a &quot;court of special jurisdiction&quot; or &quot;court of limited jurisdiction&quot;.

In U.S. federal courts, courts must consider subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte and therefore recognize their own lack of jurisdiction even if neither party has raised the matter.

=== General and limited jurisdiction ===
A court whose subject matter is not limited to certain types of controversy is referred to as a &quot;court of general jurisdiction&quot;. In the U.S. states, each state has courts of general jurisdiction; most states also have some courts of limited jurisdiction. Federal courts (those operated by the federal government) are all courts of limited jurisdiction. Federal jurisdiction is divided into federal question jurisdiction and diversity jurisdiction. The United States district courts may hear only cases arising under federal law and treaties, cases involving ambassadors, admiralty cases, controversies between states or between a state and citizens of another state, lawsuits involving citizens of different states, and against foreign states and citizens.

Certain courts, particularly the United States Supreme Court and most state supreme courts, have discretionary jurisdiction, meaning that they can choose which cases to hear from among all the cases presented on appeal. Such courts generally only choose to hear cases that would settle important and controversial points of law. Though these courts have discretion to deny cases they otherwise could adjudicate, no court has the discretion to hear a case that falls outside of its subject matter jurisdiction.

=== Original and appellate jurisdiction ===
It is also necessary to distinguish between original jurisdiction and appellate jurisdiction. A court of original jurisdiction has the power to hear cases as they are first initiated by a plaintiff, while a court of appellate jurisdiction may only hear an action after the court of original jurisdiction (or a lower appellate court) has heard the matter. For example, in United States federal courts, the United States district courts have original jurisdiction over a number of different matters (as mentioned above), and the United States court of appeals have appellate jurisdiction over matters appealed from the district courts. The U.S. Supreme Court, in turn, has appellate jurisdiction (of a discretionary nature) over the Courts of Appeals, as well as the state supreme courts, by means of writ of certiorari.

However, in a special class of cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has the power to exercise original jurisdiction. Under , the Supreme court has original and exclusive jurisdiction over controversies between two or more states, and original (but non-exclusive) jurisdiction over cases involving officials of foreign states, controversies between the federal government and a state, actions by a state against the citizens of another state or foreign country.

=== Example of jurisdiction ===
As a practical example of court jurisdiction, as of 2013 Utah has five types of courts, each for different legal matters and different physical territories. One-hundred-and-eight judges oversee Justice Courts, which handle traffic and parking citations, misdemeanor crimes, and most small claims cases. Seventy-one judges preside over District Courts, which deal with civil cases exceeding small claims limits, probate law, felony criminal cases, divorce and child custody cases, some small claims, and appeals from Justice Courts. Twenty-eight judges handle Juvenile Court, which oversees most people under 18 years old who are accused of a crime, as well as cases of alleged child abuse or neglect; serious crimes committed by 16 or 17 year old persons may be referred to the District Courts. Seven judges in the Appeals Court hear most criminal appeals from District Courts, all appeals from juvenile court and all domestic/divorce cases from District Court, as well as some cases transferred to them by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court seats five judges who hear appeals on first-degree felonies (the most serious) including capital crimes, as well as all civil cases from District Court (excepting divorce/domestic cases). The Supreme Court also oversees cases involving interpretation of the state Constitution, election matters, judicial conduct, and alleged misconduct by lawyers. This example shows how matters arising in the same physical territory might be seen in different courts. A minor traffic infraction originating in Orem, Utah is handled by the Orem Justice Court. However, a second-degree felony arrest and a first-degree felony arrest in Orem would be under the jurisdiction of the District Court in Provo, Utah. If both the minor traffic offense and the felony arrests resulted in guilty verdicts, the traffic conviction could be appealed to the District Court in Provo, while the second-degree felony appeal would be heard by the Appeals Court in Salt Lake City and the first-degree felony appeal would be heard by the Supreme Court. Similarly for civil matters, a small claims case arising in Orem would probably be heard in the Orem Justice Court, while a divorce filed by an Orem resident would be heard by the District Court in Provo. The above examples apply only to cases of Utah state law; any case under Federal jurisdiction would be handled by a different court system. All Federal cases arising in Utah are under the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Utah, headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, and would be heard in one of three Federal courthouses.

== Australia ==
In Australia, unless a matter is brought before the courts in a way amounting to an abuse of process, a court recognising its jurisdiction is obliged to exercise it. But as Australia is a federal country, no court is vested with an unrestricted jurisdiction. Therefore, the rules of jurisdiction are used to determine the ambit of those restrictions upon the courts.

=== State and federal jurisdiction ===
This idea of restrictions on jurisdiction is well illustrated by the difference in competence between federal and state courts.

Federal courts are the High Court of Australia, the Federal Court of Australia, the Family Court of Australia, and other subsidiaries. Federal courts exercise federal jurisdiction - the judicial powers granted to the federal government by the constitution of Australia. The extent of that jurisdiction is outlined in both the Constitution and legislation enacted by the federal parliament. For example, section 73(ii) of the Constitution empowers the High Court to hear appeals from the supreme court of any state, and from other courts exercising federal jurisdiction. Likewise, section 39B(1A)(c) of the &quot;Judiciary Act&quot; 1903 (Cth) empowers the Federal Court of Australia to hear any matter arising under laws enacted by the federal parliament.

Similarly, the jurisdiction of state courts is created by the states’ constitutions and is further delineated by legislation passed by their respective parliaments. In the &quot;Constitution of Queensland 2001&quot; (QLD), it is written at s58(1) that the Supreme Court of the state has all jurisdiction necessary for the administration of justice in Queensland. That is the extent of its jurisdiction.

In New South Wales, the courts’ jurisdiction is not mentioned in the constitution. Instead, the state’s legislature is empowered to make laws for the peace, welfare, and good governance of New South Wales. Amongst these laws, it is stated in section 23 of the &quot;Supreme Court Act 1970&quot; (NSW) that the Supreme Court shall have all jurisdiction necessary for the administration of justice in NSW.

In Victoria, that same power is conferred by section 85(1) of its constitution.

In summary, the jurisdiction of the courts of each state extends (at a basic level) to matters occurring within their state. Meanwhile, the jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Australia is over matters arising under federal law. The jurisdiction of the High Court is to hear appeals from states’ Supreme Courts, the Federal Court, and over matters prescribed in the Constitution of Australia.

=== Original and appellate jurisdiction ===
That approach to jurisdiction is useful to determine what questions a court may answer in examining a matter before it. Original jurisdiction permits courts to answer all questions of law and fact when a matter is brought before them for the first time (for practical reasons, courts hearing appeals from administrative bodies will also exercise original jurisdiction, this does not subvert the rule).

Appellate jurisdiction is corrective in nature. There, courts examine how lower previous decision-makers answered questions of law, whether an error was made in that process, as well as whether and how that error ought to be rectified. Their job is to correct errors made in answering the said questions - essentially, to correct errors of law.

=== Cross-vesting scheme ===
The jurisdiction of Supreme Courts of states and territories may be vested in each other in special circumstances, the federal jurisdiction may also be vested in them. Technicalities aside, the scheme compels courts to transfer matters to another court if, in the interests of justice, the second court is a more appropriate place to litigate. In assessing the interests of justice in any particular matter, the court will have regard to the interests of the parties.

The mere existence of criteria to transfer matters over to different courts nonetheless means that parties have an interest in commencing proceedings in the most convenient jurisdiction to them. The advantage conferred onto first movers is not exclusive to the Australian federal court system, parties involved in international disputes will already be familiar with that concept. However, the threshold for intra-Australia transfer is notably lower than that pertaining to international transfer.

==Territorial meaning==
The word &quot;jurisdiction&quot; is also used, especially in informal writing, to refer to a state or political subdivision generally, or to its government, rather than to its legal authority.

==Franchise jurisdiction==
In the history of English common law, a jurisdiction could be held as a form of property (or more precisely an incorporeal hereditament) called a franchise. Traditional franchise jurisdictions of various powers were held by municipal corporations, religious houses, guilds, early universities, the Welsh Marches, and counties palatine. Types of franchise courts included courts baron, courts leet, merchant courts, and the stannary courts that dealt with disputes involving the tin miners of Cornwall. The original royal charters of the American colonies included broad grants of franchise jurisdiction along with other governmental powers to corporations or individuals, as did the charters for many other colonial companies such as the British East India Company and British South Africa Company. Analogous jurisdiction existed in medieval times on the European Continent. Over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, franchise jurisdictions were largely eliminated. Several formerly important franchise courts were not officially abolished until Courts Act of 1971.

<text>John Abernethy (3 April 1764 – 20 April 1831) was an English surgeon. He is popularly remembered for having given his name to the Abernethy biscuit, a coarse-meal baked good meant to aid digestion.

==Life==
John Abernethy was the grandson of John Abernethy. He was born in Coleman Street in the City of London on 3 April 1764, where his father was a merchant. Educated at Wolverhampton Grammar School, he was apprenticed in 1779 to Sir Charles Blicke (1745–1815), a surgeon at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, London. He attended the anatomical lectures of Sir William Blizard (1743–1835) at the London Hospital, and was employed to assist as &quot;demonstrator&quot;; he also attended Percivall Pott&#x27;s surgical lectures at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, as well as the lectures of John Hunter. On Pott&#x27;s resignation of the office of surgeon of St Bartholomew&#x27;s, Sir Charles Blicke, who was assistant-surgeon, succeeded him, and Abernethy was elected assistant-surgeon in 1787.

In this capacity Abernethy began to give lectures at his house in Bartholomew Close, which were so well attended that the governors of the hospital built a theatre (1790–1791), and Abernethy thus became the founder of the medical school of St Bartholomew&#x27;s. He held the office of assistant-surgeon for twenty-eight years, until, in 1815, he was elected principal surgeon. He had before that time been appointed lecturer in anatomy to the Royal College of Surgeons (1814). Abernethy was not a great operator, though his name is associated with the treatment of aneurysm by ligature of the external iliac artery.

In 1823, Abernethy was president of the Medical and Chirurgical Society of London.

Abernethy was an anti-vivisectionist. Although he carried out experiments on animals, he killed them first, for he abhorred vivisection.

Abernethy&#x27;s &quot;Surgical Observations on the Constitutional Origin and Treatment of Local Diseases&quot; (1809) – known as &quot;My Book&quot;, from the great frequency with which he referred his patients to it, and to page 72 of it in particular, under that name – was one of the earliest popular works on medical science. So great was his zeal in encouraging patients to read the book that he earned the nickname &quot;Doctor My-Book&quot;. He taught that local diseases were frequently the results of disordered states of the digestive organs, and were to be treated by purging and attention to diet. As a lecturer he was exceedingly attractive, and his success in teaching was largely attributable to the persuasiveness with which he enunciated his views. It has been said however, that the influence he exerted on those who attended his lectures was not beneficial in this respect, that his opinions were delivered so dogmatically, and all who differed from him were disparaged and denounced so contemptuously, as to repress instead of stimulating inquiry. The celebrity he attained in his practice was due not only to his great professional skill, but also in part to his eccentricity. He was very blunt with his patients, treating them often brusquely and sometimes even rudely.

Abernethy resigned his position at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in 1827. He died at his residence at Enfield on 20 April 1831 and was buried at St Andrew&#x27;s Enfield. Joined there in 1854 by his wife Anne (née Threlfal; married 1800) and by three of their children.

== Abernethy biscuit ==
Abernethy believed that a variety of diseases originated in a disordered state of the digestive organs, and that treating underlying maldigestion and dyspepsia was essential to restoring health. He invented, or at least gave his name to, a digestive biscuit called the Abernethy biscuit that he promoted from about 1829 until his death.

==Awards and works==
In 1819, Abernethy was awarded the Hunterian Professorship. He contributed articles to &quot;Rees&#x27;s Cyclopædia&quot; on Anatomy and Physiology, but the topics are not known. A collected edition of his works was published in 1830. A biography, &quot;Memoirs of John Abernethy&quot;, by George Macilwain (1797–1882), appeared in 1853.

==In literature==
John Abernethy is mentioned in Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Purloined Letter&quot; (1844).

His debate with Sir William Lawrence is believed by Marilyn Butler to have influenced Mary Shelley&#x27;s Frankenstein.

<text>The term Judeo-Christian is used to group Christianity and Judaism together, either in reference to Christianity&#x27;s derivation from Judaism, Christianity&#x27;s recognition of Jewish scripture to constitute the Old Testament of the Christian Bible, or values supposed to be shared by the two religions. The term &quot;Judæo Christian&quot; first appeared in the 19th century as a word for Jewish converts to Christianity. The term has received criticism, largely from Jewish thinkers, as relying on and perpetuating notions of supersessionism, as well as glossing over fundamental differences between Jewish and Christian thought, theology, culture and practice.

In the United States, the term was widely used during the Cold War in an attempt to invoke a unified American identity opposed to communism.

The use of the term &quot;Abrahamic religions&quot; to refer to the common grouping of faiths which are attributed to Abraham (Islam, the Baháʼí Faith, Samaritanism, Druzism, and other faiths in addition to Judaism and Christianity) is also sometimes seen as problematic.

==History==
The term &quot;Judæo Christian&quot; first appears in a letter by Alexander McCaul which is dated October 17, 1821. The term in this case referred to Jewish converts to Christianity. The term was similarly used by Joseph Wolff in 1829, in reference to a type of church that would observe some Jewish traditions in order to convert Jews. Mark Silk states in the early 19th century the term was &quot;most widely used (in French as well as English) to refer to the early followers of Jesus who opposed&quot; the wishes of Paul the Apostle and wanted &quot;to restrict the message of Jesus to Jews and who insisted on maintaining Jewish law and ritual&quot;.

Friedrich Nietzsche used the German term (&quot;Jewish-Christian&quot;) to describe and emphasize what he believed were neglected aspects of the continuity which exists between the Jewish and Christian worldviews. The expression appears in &quot;The Antichrist&quot;, published in 1895 but written several years earlier; a fuller development of Nietzsche&#x27;s argument can be found in the prior work, &quot;On the Genealogy of Morality&quot;.

The concept of Judeo-Christian ethics or Judeo-Christian values in an ethical (rather than a theological or liturgical) sense was used by George Orwell in 1939, along with the phrase &quot;the Judaeo-Christian scheme of morals&quot;. According to theologian Richard L. Rubenstein, the &quot;normative Judaeo-Christian interpretation of history&quot; is to treat human suffering, such as a plague, as punishment for human guilt.

According to historian K. Healan Gaston, the term became a descriptor of the U.S. in the 1930s, when the country sought to forge a unified cultural identity in an attempt to distinguish itself from fascism and communism in Europe. Becoming part of the American civil religion by the 1940s, the term rose to greater prominence during the Cold War, especially when it was used to express opposition to communist atheism. In the 1970s, the term became particularly associated with the American Christian right. It is sometimes employed in a separate context in political attempts to restrict immigration and LGBT rights.

==Inter-group relations==
===In the United States===
The rise of antisemitism in the 1930s led concerned Protestants, Catholics, and Jews to take steps to increase mutual understanding and lessen the level of antisemitism in the United States. In this effort, precursors of the National Conference of Christians and Jews created teams consisting of a priest, a rabbi, and a minister, to run programs across the country, and fashion a more pluralistic America, no longer defined as a Christian land, but &quot;one nurtured by three ennobling traditions: Protestantism, Catholicism and Judaism...The phrase &#x27;Judeo-Christian&#x27; entered the contemporary lexicon as the standard liberal term for the idea that Western values rest on a religious consensus that included Jews.&quot;

In the aftermath of World War II and the Holocaust, &quot;there was a revolution in Christian theology in America. […] The greatest shift in Christian attitudes towards the Jewish people since Constantine converted the Roman Empire.&quot; The rise of Christian Zionism, religiously motivated Christian interest, and support for the state of Israel increased interest in Judaism among American evangelicals. This interest is especially focused on areas of commonality between the teachings of Judaism and their own beliefs. 

During the late 1940s, evangelical proponents of the new Judeo-Christian approach lobbied Washington for diplomatic support of the new state of Israel. From the 1990s, continuing through the first two decades of the 21st century, interest in and a positive attitude towards America&#x27;s Judeo-Christian tradition has become mainstream among evangelicals and (to some extent) the political conservative movement in the United States. 

In contrast, by the 1970s, mainline Protestant denominations and the National Council of Churches were more supportive of Palestinians than Israel. Natan Sharansky observed in 2019, that for the first time, he was encountering the situation of nations with ample governmental support for Israel but disinterest and even overt hostility by the Jewish populace.

The scriptural basis for this new positive attitude towards Jews among evangelicals is found in Genesis 12:3, in which God promises that he will bless those who bless Abraham, and curse those who curse them. In the evangelical interpretation this promise includes the descendants of Abraham. Other factors in the new philo-Semitism include gratitude to the Jews for contributing to the theological foundations of Christianity and being the source of the prophets and Jesus; remorse for the Church&#x27;s history of antisemitism; and fear that God will judge the nations at the end of time based on how they treated the Jewish people. Moreover, for many evangelicals Israel is seen as the instrument through which prophecies of the end times are fulfilled.

The use of the term &quot;Judeo-Christian&quot; in 21st century discourse has been criticized for equating two different faiths and being a vector for Islamophobia by exclusion.

===In Europe===
==Jewish responses==
The Jewish community&#x27;s attitude towards the concept has been mixed. In the 1930s, &quot;In the face of worldwide anti-semitic efforts to stigmatize and destroy Judaism, influential Christians and Jews in America labored to uphold it, pushing Judaism from the margins of American religious life towards its very center.&quot; During World War II, Jewish chaplains worked with Catholic priests and Protestant ministers in order to promote goodwill, addressing servicemen who, &quot;in many cases had never seen, much less heard a Rabbi speak before.&quot; At funerals for the unknown soldier, rabbis stood alongside the other chaplains and recited prayers in Hebrew. In a much-publicized wartime tragedy, the sinking of the , the ship&#x27;s multi-faith chaplains gave up their lifebelts to evacuate seamen and stood together &quot;arm in arm in prayer&quot; as the ship sank. A 1948 postage stamp commemorated their heroism with the words: &quot;interfaith in action.&quot;

In the 1950s, &quot;a spiritual and cultural revival washed over American Jewry&quot; in response to the trauma of the Holocaust. American Jews became more confident in their desire to be identified as different.

Two notable books addressed the relationship between contemporary Judaism and Christianity, Abba Hillel Silver&#x27;s &quot;Where Judaism Differs&quot; and Leo Baeck&#x27;s &quot;Judaism and Christianity&quot;, both motivated by an impulse to clarify Judaism&#x27;s distinctiveness &quot;in a world where the term Judeo-Christian had obscured critical differences between the two faiths.&quot; Reacting against the blurring of theological distinctions, Rabbi Eliezer Berkovits wrote that &quot;Judaism is Judaism because it rejects Christianity, and Christianity is Christianity because it rejects Judaism.&quot; Theologian and author Arthur A. Cohen, in &quot;The Myth of the Judeo-Christian Tradition&quot;, questioned the theological validity of the Judeo-Christian concept and suggested that it was essentially an invention of American politics, while Jacob Neusner, in &quot;Jews and Christians: The Myth of a Common Tradition&quot;, writes, &quot;The two faiths stand for different people talking about different things to different people.&quot;

Law professor Stephen M. Feldman looking at the period before 1950, chiefly in Europe, sees invocation of a &quot;Judeo-Christian tradition&quot; as supersessionism:

<doc id="16397" wikidata="Q6120737" url="?curid=16397" title="Jacques Maroger">
<text>Jacques Maroger (; 1884–1962) was a painter and the technical director of the Louvre Museum&#x27;s laboratory in Paris. He devoted his life to understanding the oil-based media of the Old Masters. He emigrated to the United States in 1939 and became an influential teacher. His book, &quot;The Secret Formulas and Techniques of the Masters&quot;, has been criticized by some modern writers on painting who say that the painting medium Maroger promoted is unsound.

==Training and early career==
In 1907, Maroger began to study with Louis Anquetin and worked under his direction until Anquetin&#x27;s death in 1932. Anquetin worked closely and exhibited with the artists Vincent van Gogh, Charles Angrand, Émile Bernard, Paul Gauguin, Camille Pissarro, Georges Seurat, Paul Signac and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. He was very active in the Impressionist movement of the time. In his later years, Anquetin became very interested in the works of the Flemish masters. As Maroger&#x27;s teacher, Anquetin provided guidance in the study of drawing, anatomy and master painting techniques. Maroger began to become famous around 1931, when the National Academy of Design in New York City reported Maroger&#x27;s painting discoveries.

From 1930 to 1939, Maroger started to work at the Louvre Museum in Paris as Technical Director of the Louvre Laboratory. He served as a professor at the Louvre School, a Member of the Conservation Committee, General Secretary of the International Experts, and President of the Restorers of France. In 1937, he received the Légion d&#x27;honneur, and his pride at the honor is reflected in his self-portrait of the time, in which one can see his Legion pin on his lapel.

He emigrated to the United States in 1939 and became a lecturer at the Parsons School of Design in New York. His New York students, Reginald Marsh, John Koch, Fairfield Porter and Frank Mason adopted his Old Master painting techniques, and taught it in turn to their own students.

In 1942, Maroger became a Professor at the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore and established a school of painting. At the Maryland Institute he led a group of painters who came to be known as the Baltimore Realists, including the painters Earl Hofmann, Thomas Rowe, Joseph Sheppard, Ann Didusch Schuler, Frank Redelius, John Bannon, Evan Keehn, and Melvin Miller.

Maroger published &quot;The Secret Formulas and Techniques of the Masters&quot; in 1948. When Maroger&#x27;s book became available, Reginald Marsh drew on Maroger&#x27;s book-jacket an airplane dropping an atomic bomb on the Maryland Art Institute, a reference to the controversy Maroger was causing in the local press over the abstract art versus realism debate.

Maroger&#x27;s formula and techniques have been studied by many modern painters who wish to obtain the paint quality of the Old Masters. The &quot;secret formula&quot; that Maroger devised during his lifetime included the main ingredient white lead. White lead when cooked into linseed oil acts as a drying agent, accelerating the polymerization of the oil film.

Maroger claimed to have introduced to the modern day artist what the masters achieved centuries before in their paintings, a way to ensure permanence and color quality in oils without sacrificing fluid and subtle paint handling. Equipped with these formulas, the artist could once again blend his paint easily without losing control of his brush. The paint stays where it is applied and does not run off the panel. It dries very fast so that he can paint on the same areas the very next day, which speeds up painting.

Frank Redelius, one of Maroger&#x27;s protégés from the Baltimore Realists group, wrote a book that updates, builds upon and revises Jacques Maroger&#x27;s research of the painting techniques and formulas of the Old Masters. Redelius was assisting Maroger with a revision of &quot;The Secret Formulas and Techniques of the Masters&quot; before Maroger&#x27;s death in 1962. Frank Redelius&#x27; book, published in 2009, is titled &quot;The Master Keys: A Painter&#x27;s Treatise On The Pictorial Technique Of Oil Painting&quot;.

== Critics of Maroger ==
Maroger has been criticized by some modern writers on painting because of his bold claims about having found the secret formulas of the Masters. The current proprietary Maroger&#x27;s Medium is in fact the jelly-like medium also known as Megilp (Macgilp, McGuilp, etc.). This material, made by mixing heavy mastic varnish with a linseed oil that has been cooked to blackness with litharge or white lead, was introduced in the late 18th century and employed extensively during the 19th [and therefore is not, as claimed by some, of centuries old pedigree].

The archival quality of the medium itself is controversial in art circles, in part because its documented use dates back less than a century. This is from Michael Skalka, Conservation Administrator, National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC.:

See the work of Lance Mayer and Gay Myers for more information on Curry and Maroger.

This criticism can be misleading, however. Many of the media involved in Curry&#x27;s work (and other followers of Maroger) bear no resemblance whatsoever to the modern mastic varnish/black oil recipe. Maroger medium which is not made properly may contain a large amount of dirt and impurities from improperly filtered mastic varnish, or the black oil may be overcooked, both of which would contribute to darkening and weakening of the work. In addition the overuse of megilp media (or any medium for that matter) tends to create weak paint films. Conservation science has shown that the presence of natural resins like mastic in the paint film causes embrittlement, darkening, and continued solubility. See the work of Leslie Carlyle or Joyce Townsend for problems related to 18th-century painting that contain megilp.

== Lost old master formulas by Maroger ==

===Six formulas of Maroger taken from his book on painting formulas===
# Lead Medium – attributed to Antonello da Messina – One part litharge (yellow lead oxide) or lead white, combined by cooking with three to four parts linseed.
# Lead Medium – attributed to Leonardo da Vinci – One part litharge or lead white, combined by cooking with three to four parts raw linseed oil, and three to four parts water.
# Lead Medium – attributed to the Venetian painters – Giorgione, Titian and Tintoretto – One or two parts litharge or lead white, combined by cooking with 20 parts raw linseed or walnut oil.
# Lead Medium – attributed to Peter Paul Rubens -This medium was allegedly based on the black oil of Giorgione with an addition of mastic resin, Venice turpentine and beeswax. One or two parts litharge or lead white, combines by cooking with 20 parts raw linseed. A little more than one spoonful of &quot;black oil&quot; combined with even one spoonful of mastic varnish resulted in the &quot;jelly&quot; medium thought to be Megilp (another name of Maroger media).
# Lead Medium – (attributed to the &quot;Little Dutch Masters&quot;) This medium was the same as the one used by Rubens, but did not include beeswax.
# Lead Medium – attributed to Velázquez – One part verdigris (derived from copper – this material is substituted for the lead-based metallic driers), combined by cooking with 20 parts raw linseed or walnut oil.

The majority of these recipes are not employed today, as there are few companies that produce them. The primary form of &quot;Maroger medium&quot; known today is black oil (&quot;Giorgione&#x27;s&quot; medium) and mastic varnish combined in approximately equal parts to form a gel.

While Maroger medium is usually mixed directly with oil paints, its proportion should be kept to no more than 20% of the mixture. A useful technique is to rub a very thin film of Maroger medium over the area to be painted and paint into that—known as &quot;painting into the couch.&quot; This lubricates the brush stroke. Maroger medium (or any other painting medium, for that matter) should never be used as a final picture varnish, as Maroger requires reaction by admixture with oil paint in order to dry.

The reduced availability of lead, combined with injunctions against lead use in household products and other factors has caused most major paint makers to discontinue the production of Maroger&#x27;s medium. Many paint makers now offer faux-maroger&#x27;s media or faux-megilps, generally made by substituting different materials, such as lime, for genuine lead, or (as in the case of Gamblin&#x27;s Neo-Megilp) by creating a similar product out of specially thickened alkyd medium. These products produce effects similar to, but not the same as those of real Maroger medium, which depends on specific chemical reactions between leaded oil, mastic resin, and turpentine (the mastic varnish vehicle).

==Home and Studio==
The white gingerbread cottage that was Maroger&#x27;s home in Baltimore is found on the east campus of Loyola College in Maryland and is used for drawing and painting courses. The building, created in the style of a Parisian studio, is aptly called the Maroger Art Studio.

<text>Joseph Harold Greenberg (May 28, 1915 – May 7, 2001) was an American linguist, known mainly for his work concerning linguistic typology and the genetic classification of languages.

==Life==
===Early life and education===
Joseph Greenberg was born on May 28, 1915, to Jewish parents in Brooklyn, New York. His first great interest was music. At the age of 14, he gave a piano concert in Steinway Hall. He continued to play the piano frequently throughout his life.

After graduating from James Madison High School, he decided to pursue a scholarly career rather than a musical one. He enrolled at Columbia College in New York in 1932. During his senior year, he attended a class taught by Franz Boas concerning American Indian languages. He graduated in 1936 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree. With references from Boas and Ruth Benedict, he was accepted as a graduate student by Melville J. Herskovits at Northwestern University in Chicago and graduated in 1940 with a doctorate degree. During the course of his graduate studies, Greenberg did fieldwork among the Hausa people of Nigeria, where he learned the Hausa language. The subject of his doctoral dissertation was the influence of Islam on a Hausa group that, unlike most others, had not converted to it.

During 1940, he began postdoctoral studies at Yale University. These were interrupted by service in the U.S. Army Signal Corps during World War II, for which he worked as a codebreaker in North Africa and participated with the landing at Casablanca. He then served in Italy until the end of the war.

Before leaving for Europe during 1943, Greenberg married Selma Berkowitz, whom he had met during his first year at Columbia University.

===Career===
After the war, Greenberg taught at the University of Minnesota before returning to Columbia University in 1948 as a teacher of anthropology. While in New York, he became acquainted with Roman Jakobson and André Martinet. They introduced him to the Prague school of structuralism, which influenced his work.

In 1962, Greenberg relocated to the anthropology department at Stanford University in California, where he continued working for the rest of his life. In 1965 Greenberg served as president of the African Studies Association. That same year, he was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences. He was later elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1973) and the American Philosophical Society (1975). In 1996 he received the highest award for a scholar in Linguistics, the Gold Medal of Philology.

==Contributions to linguistics==
=== Linguistic typology===
Greenberg is considered the founder of modern linguistic typology, a field that he has revitalized with his publications in the 1960s and 1970s. Greenberg&#x27;s reputation rests partly on his contributions to synchronic linguistics and the quest to identify linguistic universals. During the late 1950s, Greenberg began to examine languages covering a wide geographic and genetic distribution. He located a number of interesting potential universals as well as many strong cross-linguistic tendencies.

In particular, Greenberg conceptualized the idea of &quot;implicational universal&quot;, which has the form, &quot;if a language has structure X, then it must also have structure Y.&quot; For example, X might be &quot;mid front rounded vowels&quot; and Y &quot;high front rounded vowels&quot; (for terminology see phonetics). Many scholars adopted this kind of research following Greenberg&#x27;s example and it remains important in synchronic linguistics.

Like Noam Chomsky, Greenberg sought to discover the universal structures on which human language is based. Unlike Chomsky, Greenberg&#x27;s method was functionalist, rather than formalist. An argument to reconcile the Greenbergian and Chomskyan methods can be found in &quot;Linguistic Universals&quot; (2006), edited by Ricardo Mairal and Juana Gil.

Many who are strongly opposed to Greenberg&#x27;s methods of language classification (see below) acknowledge the importance of his typological work. In 1963 he published an article : &quot;Some universals of grammar with particular reference to the order of meaningful elements&quot;.

===Mass comparison===
Greenberg rejected the opinion, prevalent among linguists since the mid-20th century, that comparative reconstruction was the only method to discover relationships between languages. He argued that genetic classification is methodologically prior to comparative reconstruction, or the first stage of it: one cannot engage in the comparative reconstruction of languages until one knows which languages to compare (1957:44).

He also criticized the prevalent opinion that comprehensive comparisons of two languages at a time (which commonly take years to perform) could establish language families of any size. He argued that, even for 8 languages, there are already 4,140 ways to classify them into distinct families, while for 25 languages there are 4,638,590,332,229,999,353 ways (1957:44). For comparison, the Niger–Congo family is said to have some 1,500 languages. He thought language families of any size needed to be established by some scholastic means other than bilateral comparison. The theory of mass comparison is an attempt to demonstrate such means.

Greenberg argued for the virtues of breadth over depth. He advocated restricting the amount of material to be compared (to basic vocabulary, morphology, and known paths of sound change) and increasing the number of languages to be compared to all the languages in a given area. This would make it possible to compare numerous languages reliably. At the same time, the process would provide a check on accidental resemblances through the sheer number of languages under review. The mathematical probability that resemblances are accidental decreases strongly with the number of languages concerned (1957:39).

Greenberg used the premise that mass &quot;borrowing&quot; of basic vocabulary is unknown. He argued that borrowing, when it occurs, is concentrated in cultural vocabulary and clusters &quot;in certain semantic areas&quot;, making it easy to detect (1957:39). With the goal of determining broad patterns of relationship, the idea was not to get every word right but to detect patterns. From the beginning with his theory of mass comparison, Greenberg addressed why chance resemblance and borrowing were not obstacles to its being useful. Despite that, critics consider those phenomena caused difficulties for his theory.

Greenberg first termed his method &quot;mass comparison&quot; in an article of 1954 (reprinted in Greenberg 1955). As of 1987, he replaced the term &quot;mass comparison&quot; with &quot;multilateral comparison&quot;, to emphasize its contrast with the bilateral comparisons recommended by linguistics textbooks. He believed that multilateral comparison was not in any way opposed to the comparative method, but is, on the contrary, its necessary first step (Greenberg, 1957:44). According to him, comparative reconstruction should have the status of an explanatory theory for facts already established by language classification (Greenberg, 1957:45).

Most historical linguists (Campbell 2001:45) reject the use of mass comparison as a method for establishing genealogical relationships between languages. Among the most outspoken critics of mass comparison have been Lyle Campbell, Donald Ringe, William Poser, and the late R. Larry Trask.

===Genetic classification of languages===
====Languages of Africa====
Greenberg is known widely for his development of a classification system for the languages of Africa, which he published as a series of articles in the &quot;Southwestern Journal of Anthropology&quot; from 1949 to 1954 (reprinted together as a book, &quot;The Languages of Africa&quot;, in 1955). He revised the book and published it again during 1963, followed by a nearly identical edition of 1966 (reprinted without change during 1970). A few more changes of the classification were made by Greenberg in an article during 1981.

Greenberg grouped the hundreds of African languages into four families, which he dubbed Afroasiatic, Nilo-Saharan, Niger–Congo, and Khoisan. During the course of his work, Greenberg invented the term &quot;Afroasiatic&quot; to replace the earlier term &quot;Hamito-Semitic&quot;, after showing that the Hamitic group, accepted widely since the 19th century, is not a valid language family. Another major feature of his work was to establish the classification of the Bantu languages, which occupy much of Central and Southern Africa, as a part of the Niger–Congo family, rather than as an independent family as many Bantuists had maintained.

Greenberg&#x27;s classification rested largely in evaluating competing earlier classifications. For a time, his classification was considered bold and speculative, especially the proposal of a Nilo-Saharan language family. Now, apart from Khoisan, it is generally accepted by African specialists and has been used as a basis for further work by other scholars.

Greenberg&#x27;s work on African languages has been criticised by Lyle Campbell and Donald Ringe, who do not believe that his classification is justified by his data and request a re-examination of his macro-phyla by &quot;reliable methods&quot; (Ringe 1993:104). Harold Fleming and Lionel Bender, who were sympathetic to Greenberg&#x27;s classification, acknowledged that at least some of his macrofamilies (particularly the Nilo-Saharan and the Khoisan macrofamilies) are not accepted completely by most linguists and may need to be divided (Campbell 1997). Their objection was methodological: if mass comparison is not a valid method, it cannot be expected to have brought order successfully out of the confusion of African languages.

By contrast, some linguists have sought to combine Greenberg&#x27;s four African families into larger units. In particular, Edgar Gregersen (1972) proposed joining Niger–Congo and Nilo-Saharan into a larger family, which he termed Kongo-Saharan. Roger Blench (1995) suggests Niger–Congo is a subfamily of Nilo-Saharan.

====The languages of New Guinea, Tasmania, and the Andaman Islands====
During 1971 Greenberg proposed the Indo-Pacific macrofamily, which groups together the Papuan languages (a large number of language families of New Guinea and nearby islands) with the native languages of the Andaman Islands and Tasmania but excludes the Australian Aboriginal languages. Its principal feature was to reduce the manifold language families of New Guinea to a single genetic unit. This excludes the Austronesian languages, which have been established as associated with a more recent migration of people.

Greenberg&#x27;s subgrouping of these languages has not been accepted by the few specialists who have worked on the classification of these languages. However, the work of Stephen Wurm (1982) and Malcolm Ross (2005) has provided considerable evidence for his once-radical idea that these languages form a single genetic unit. Wurm stated that the lexical similarities between Great Andamanese and the West Papuan and Timor–Alor families &quot;are quite striking and amount to virtual formal identity [...] in a number of instances.&quot; He believes this to be due to a linguistic substratum.

====The languages of the Americas====

Most linguists concerned with the native languages of the Americas classify them into 150 to 180 independent language families. Some believe that two language families, Eskimo–Aleut and Na-Dené, were distinct, perhaps the results of later migrations into the New World.

Early on, Greenberg (1957:41, 1960) became convinced that many of the language groups considered unrelated could be classified into larger groupings. In his 1987 book &quot;Language in the Americas&quot;, while agreeing that the Eskimo–Aleut and Na-Dené groupings as distinct, he proposed that all the other Native American languages belong to a single language macro-family, which he termed Amerind.

&quot;Language in the Americas&quot; has generated lively debate, but has been criticized strongly; it is rejected by most specialists of indigenous languages of the Americas and also by most historical linguists. Specialists of the individual language families have found extensive inaccuracies and errors in Greenberg&#x27;s data, such as including data from non-existent languages, erroneous transcriptions of the forms compared, misinterpretations of the meanings of words used for comparison, and entirely spurious forms.

Historical linguists also reject the validity of the method of multilateral (or mass) comparison upon which the classification is based. They argue that he has not provided a convincing case that the similarities presented as evidence are due to inheritance from an earlier common ancestor rather than being explained by a combination of errors, accidental similarity, excessive semantic latitude in comparisons, borrowings, onomatopoeia, etc.

However, Harvard geneticist David Reich notes that recent genetic studies have identified patterns that support Greenberg&#x27;s Amerind classification: the &quot;First American” category. &quot;The cluster of populations that he predicted to be most closely related based on language were in fact verified by the genetic patterns in populations for which data are available.” Nevertheless, this category of &quot;First American&quot; people also interbred with and contributed a significant amount of genes to the ancestors of both Eskimo-Aleut and Na-Dené populations, with 60% and 90% &quot;First American&quot; DNA respectively constituting the genetic makeup of the two groups.

==== The languages of northern Eurasia ====
Later in his life, Greenberg proposed that nearly all of the language families of northern Eurasia belong to a single higher-order family, which he termed Eurasiatic. The only exception was Yeniseian, which has been related to a wider Dené–Caucasian grouping, also including Sino-Tibetan. During 2008 Edward Vajda related Yeniseian to the Na-Dené languages of North America as a Dené–Yeniseian family.

The Eurasiatic grouping resembles the older Nostratic groupings of Holger Pedersen and Vladislav Illich-Svitych by including Indo-European, Uralic, and Altaic. It differs by including Nivkh, Japonic, Korean, and Ainu (which the Nostraticists had excluded from comparison because they are single languages rather than language families) and in excluding Afroasiatic. At about this time, Russian Nostraticists, notably Sergei Starostin, constructed a revised version of Nostratic. It was slightly larger than Greenberg&#x27;s grouping but it also excluded Afroasiatic.

Recently, a consensus has been emerging among proponents of the Nostratic hypothesis. Greenberg basically agreed with the Nostratic concept, though he stressed a deep internal division between its northern &#x27;tier&#x27; (his Eurasiatic) and a southern &#x27;tier&#x27; (principally Afroasiatic and Dravidian).

The American Nostraticist Allan Bomhard considers Eurasiatic a branch of Nostratic, alongside other branches: Afroasiatic, Elamo-Dravidian, and Kartvelian. Similarly, Georgiy Starostin (2002) arrives at a tripartite overall grouping: he considers Afroasiatic, Nostratic and Elamite to be roughly equidistant and more closely related to each other than to any other language family. Sergei Starostin&#x27;s school has now included Afroasiatic in a broadly defined Nostratic. They reserve the term Eurasiatic to designate the narrower subgrouping, which comprises the rest of the macrofamily. Recent proposals thus differ mainly on the precise inclusion of Dravidian and Kartvelian.

Greenberg continued to work on this project after he was diagnosed with incurable pancreatic cancer and until he died during May 2001. His colleague and former student Merritt Ruhlen ensured the publication of the final volume of his Eurasiatic work (2002) after his death.

<text>Jan Josephszoon van Goyen (; 13 January 1596 – 27 April 1656) was a Dutch landscape painter. The scope of his landscape subjects was very broad as he painted forest landscapes, marine paintings, river landscapes, beach scenes, winter landscapes, cityscapes, architectural views and landscapes with peasants. The list of painters he influenced is much longer. He was an extremely prolific artist who left approximately twelve hundred paintings and more than one thousand drawings.

==Biography==
Jan van Goyen was the son of a shoemaker and started as an apprentice in Leiden, the town of his birth. Like many Dutch painters of his time, he studied art in the town of Haarlem with Esaias van de Velde. At age 35, he established a permanent studio at The Hague (Den Haag). Crenshaw tells (and mentions the sources) that van Goyen&#x27;s landscape paintings rarely fetched high prices, but he made up for the modest value of individual pieces by increasing his production, painting thinly and quickly with a limited palette of inexpensive pigments. Despite his market innovations, he always sought more income, not only through related work as an art dealer and auctioneer but also by speculating in tulips (he was the last known victim of the tulip mania of the 1630s) and real estate. Although the latter was usually a safe avenue of investing money, in van Goyen&#x27;s experience it led to enormous debts. Paulus Potter rented one of his houses. Though he seems to have kept a workshop, his only registered pupils were Nicolaes van Berchem, Jan Steen, and Adriaen van der Kabel. The list of painters he influenced is much longer.

In 1652 and 1654, he was forced to sell his collection of paintings and graphic art, and he subsequently moved to a smaller house. He died in 1656 in The Hague, still unbelievably 18,000 guilders in debt, forcing his widow to sell their remaining furniture and paintings. Van Goyen&#x27;s troubles also may have affected the early business prospects of his student and son-in-law Jan Steen, who left The Hague in 1654.

==Dutch painting==

Typically, a Dutch painter of the 17th century will fall into one of four categories: a painter of portraits, landscapes, still-lifes, or genre painting. Dutch painting was highly specialized and rarely could an artist hope to achieve greatness in more than one area in a lifetime of painting. Jan van Goyen would be classified primarily as a landscape artist with an eye for the genre subjects of everyday life. He painted many of the canals in and around The Hague as well as the villages surrounding the countryside of Delft, Rotterdam, Leiden, and Gouda. Other popular Dutch landscape painters of the sixteenth and seventeenth century were
Jacob van Ruisdael, Aelbert Cuyp, Hendrick Avercamp, Ludolf Backhuysen, Meindert Hobbema, Aert van der Neer.

==Van Goyen&#x27;s technique==

Jan van Goyen would begin a painting using a support primarily of thin oak wood. To this panel, he would scrub on several layers of a thin animal hide glue. With a blade, he would then scrape over the entire surface a thin layer of tinted white lead to act as a ground and to fill the low areas of the panel. The ground was tinted light brown, sometimes reddish, or ochre in colour.

Next, van Goyen would loosely and very rapidly sketch out the scene to be painted with pen and ink without going into the small details of his subject. This walnut ink drawing can be clearly seen in some of the thinly painted areas of his work. For a guide, he would have turned to a detailed drawing. The scene would have been drawn from life outdoors and then kept in the studio as reference material. Drawings by artists of the time were rarely works of art in their own right as they are viewed today.

On his palette he would grind out a colour collection of neutral grays, umbers, ochre and earthen greens that looked like they were pulled from the very soil he painted. A varnish oil medium was used as vehicle to grind his powdered pigments into paint and then used to help apply thin layers of paint which he could easily blend.
The dark areas of the painting were kept very thin and transparent with generous amounts of the oil medium. The light striking the painting in these sections would be lost and absorbed into the painting ground. The lighter areas of the picture were treated heavier and opaque with a generous amount of white lead mixed into the paint. Light falling on the painting in a light section is reflected back at the viewer. The effect is a startling realism and three-dimensional quality. The surface of a finished painting resembles a fluid supple mousse, masterfully whipped and modeled with the brush.

According to the art historian H. U. Beck, &quot;In his freely composed seascapes of the 1650s he reached the apex of his creative work, producing paintings of striking perfection.&quot;

Some of Van Goyen&#x27;s Works can be seen at the Thyssen Bornemisza Museum in Madrid, one from the public collection (&quot;Winter landscape with figures on ice&quot;, 1643) and others from the Carmen Thyssen Collection also shown there (&quot;River Landscape with Ferry boat and Cottages&quot;, 1634).

==Legacy==
Jan van Goyen was famously influential on the landscape painters of his century. His tonal quality was a feature that many imitated. According to the Netherlands Institute for Art History, he influenced Cornelis de Bie, Jan Coelenbier, Cornelis van Noorde, Abraham Susenier, Herman Saftleven, Pieter Jansz van Asch, and Abraham van Beijeren.

Van Goyen is mentioned by his fellow countryman Vincent van Gogh in Vincent&#x27;s second letter from the asylum: &quot;Through the iron-barred window I can make out a square of wheat in an enclosure, a perspective in the manner of Van Goyen, above which in the morning I see the sun rise in its glory.&quot;

<doc id="16403" wikidata="Q185117" url="?curid=16403" title="Justin Martyr">
<text>Justin, known posthumously as Justin Martyr (; ), also known as Justin the Philosopher, was an early Christian apologist and philosopher.

Most of his works are lost, but two apologies and a dialogue did survive. The &quot;First Apology&quot;, his most well-known text, passionately defends the morality of the Christian life, and provides various ethical and philosophical arguments to convince the Roman emperor Antoninus Pius to abandon the persecution of the Church. Further, he also indicates, as St. Augustine would later, regarding the &quot;true religion&quot; that revealed itself as Christianity, that the &quot;seeds of Christianity&quot; (manifestations of the Logos acting in history) actually predated Christ&#x27;s incarnation. This notion allows him to claim many historical Greek philosophers (including Socrates and Plato), in whose works he was well studied, as unknowing Christians.

Justin was martyred, along with some of his students, and is venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, Lutheran Churches, and in Anglicanism.

==Life==
Justin Martyr was born , into a Greek family, at Flavia Neapolis (today Nablus) near the ancient biblical city of Shechem, in Samaria. He knew little or no Hebrew and Aramaic, and had only a passing acquaintance with Judaism. He was uncircumcised, and defined himself as a Gentile. His grandfather, Bacchius, had a Greek name, while his father, Priscus, bore a Latin name, which has led to speculations that his ancestors may have settled in Neapolis soon after its establishment or that they were descended from a Roman &quot;diplomatic&quot; community that had been sent there.

In the opening of the &quot;Dialogue&quot;, Justin describes his early education, stating that his initial studies left him unsatisfied due to their failure to provide a belief system that would afford theological and metaphysical inspiration to their young pupil. He says he tried first the school of a Stoic philosopher, who was unable to explain God&#x27;s being to him. He then attended a Peripatetic philosopher but was put off because the philosopher was too eager for his fee. Then he went to hear a Pythagorean philosopher who demanded that he first learn music, astronomy, and geometry, which he did not wish to do. Subsequently, he adopted Platonism after encountering a Platonist thinker who had recently settled in his city.

Some time afterwards, he chanced upon an old man, possibly a Syrian Christian, in the vicinity of the seashore, who engaged him in a dialogue about God and spoke of the testimony of the prophets as being more reliable than the reasoning of philosophers.

Moved by the aged man&#x27;s argument, Justin renounced both his former religious faith and his philosophical background, choosing instead to re-dedicate his life to the service of the Divine. His newfound convictions were only bolstered by the ascetic lives of the early Christians and the heroic example of the martyrs, whose piety convinced him of the moral and spiritual superiority of Christian doctrine. As a result, he thenceforth decided that the only option for him was to travel throughout the land, spreading the knowledge of Christianity as the &quot;true philosophy.&quot; His conversion is commonly assumed to have taken place at Ephesus though it may have occurred anywhere on the road from Syria Palestina to Rome.
He then adopted the dress of a philosopher himself and traveled about teaching. During the reign of Antoninus Pius (138–161), he arrived in Rome and started his own school. Tatian was one of his pupils. In the reign of Marcus Aurelius, after disputing with the cynic philosopher Crescens, he was denounced by the latter to the authorities, according to Tatian (Address to the Greeks 19) and Eusebius (HE IV 16.7–8). Justin was tried, together with six friends (two of them slaves educated by him; Euelpistus and Hierax), by the urban prefect Junius Rusticus, and was beheaded. Though the precise year of his death is uncertain, it can reasonably be dated by the prefectoral term of Rusticus (who governed from 162 and 168). The martyrdom of Justin preserves the court record of the trial.

==Veneration==
In 1882, Pope Leo XIII had a Mass and an Office composed for his feast day, which he set at 14 April, one day after the date of his death as indicated in the Martyrology of Florus; but since this date quite often falls within the main Paschal celebrations, the feast was moved in 1968 to 1 June, the date on which he has been celebrated in the Byzantine Rite since at least the 9th century.

Justin is remembered in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 1 June.

===Relics===

The church of St. John the Baptist in Sacrofano, a few miles north of Rome, claims to have his relics.

The Church of the Jesuits in Valletta, Malta, founded by papal decree in 1592 also boasts relics of this second century Saint.

A case is also made that the relics of St. Justin are buried in Annapolis, Maryland. During a period of unrest in Italy, a noble family in possession of his remains sent them in 1873 to a priest in Baltimore for safekeeping. They were displayed in St. Mary&#x27;s Church for a period of time before they were again locked away for safekeeping. The remains were rediscovered and given a proper burial at St. Mary&#x27;s, with Vatican approval, in 1989. It is now asserted that the bones were of St. Justin of the third century who was martyred during the persecution of Maximus.

==Writings==

The earliest mention of Justin is found in the &quot;Oratio ad Graecos&quot; by his student Tatian who, after calling him &quot;the most admirable Justin&quot;, quotes a saying of his and says that the Cynic Crescens laid snares for him. Irenaeus speaks of Justin&#x27;s martyrdom and of Tatian as his disciple. Irenaeus quotes Justin twice and shows his influence in other places. Tertullian, in his &quot;Adversus Valentinianos&quot;, calls Justin a philosopher and a martyr and the earliest antagonist of heretics. Hippolytus and Methodius of Olympus also mention or quote him. Eusebius of Caesarea deals with him at some length, and names the following works:
# The &quot;First Apology&quot; addressed to Antoninus Pius, his sons, and the Roman Senate;
# A &quot;Second Apology of Justin Martyr&quot; addressed to the Roman Senate;
# The &quot;Discourse to the Greeks&quot;, a discussion with Greek philosophers on the character of their gods;
# An &quot;Hortatory Address to the Greeks&quot; (known now not to have been written by Justin);
# A treatise &quot;On the Sovereignty of God&quot;, in which he makes use of pagan authorities as well as Christian;
# A work entitled &quot;The Psalmist&quot;;
# A treatise in scholastic form &quot;On the Soul&quot;; and
# The &quot;Dialogue with Trypho&quot;.
Eusebius implies that other works were in circulation; from St Irenaeus he knows of the apology &quot;Against Marcion,&quot; and from Justin&#x27;s &quot;Apology&quot; of a &quot;Refutation of all Heresies&quot;. St Epiphanius and St Jerome mention Justin.

Rufinus borrows from his Latin original of Hadrian&#x27;s letter.

===Spurious medieval works===

After Rufinus, Justin was known mainly from St Irenaeus and Eusebius or from spurious works. A considerable number of other works are given as Justin&#x27;s by Arethas of Caesarea, Photius of Constantinople, and other writers, but this attribution is now generally admitted to be spurious. The &quot;Expositio rectae fidei&quot; was assigned by Johann Dräseke to Apollinaris of Laodicea, but it is probably a work of as late as the 6th century. The &quot;Cohortatio ad Graecos&quot; has been attributed to Apollinaris of Laodicea, Apollinaris of Hierapolis, as well as others. The &quot;Epistola ad Zenam et Serenum&quot;, an exhortation to Christian living, is dependent upon Clement of Alexandria, and was assigned by Pierre Batiffol to the Novatian Bishop Sisinnius (). The extant work under the title &quot;On the Sovereignty of God&quot; does not correspond with Eusebius&#x27; description of it, though Adolf von Harnack regarded it as still possibly Justin&#x27;s, and at least of the 2nd century. The author of the smaller treatise &quot;To the Greeks&quot; cannot be Justin, because he is dependent on Tatian; Von Harnack placed it between 180 and 240.

===&quot;Parisinus graecus&quot; 450===
After this medieval period in which no authentic works of Justin Martyr were in widespread circulation, a single codex containing the complete works of Justin Martyr was discovered and purchased by Guillaume Pellicier, in Venice. Pellicier sent it to the Bibliothèque nationale de France where it remains today under the catalog number &quot;Parisinus graecus&quot; 450. This codex was completed on 11 September 1364 somewhere in the Byzantine Empire. The name of the scribe is unknown, although Manuel Kantakouzenos has been suggested as patron. Internal textual evidence shows that multiple older manuscripts were used to create this one, which strongly suggests that it must have originated in a major population center like Mistra, since libraries holding Justin Martyr were already rare by 1364. Other partial medieval manuscripts have been shown to be copies of this one. The &quot;editio princeps&quot; was published by Robert Estienne in 1551.

===&quot;Dialogue with Trypho&quot;===
The &quot;Dialogue&quot; is a later work than the &quot;First Apology&quot;; the date of composition of the latter, judging from the fact that it was addressed to Antoninus Pius and his adopted sons Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, must fall between 147 and 161. In the &quot;Dialogue with Trypho&quot;, after an introductory section, Justin undertakes to show that Christianity is the new law for all men.

Justin&#x27;s dialogue with Trypho is unique in that he provides information on tensions between Jewish and Gentile believers in Jesus of the second century (Dial. 47:2–3) and in acknowledging the existence of a range, and a variety, of attitudes toward the beliefs and traditions of the Jewish believers in Jesus.

===&quot;On the Resurrection&quot;===

The treatise &quot;On the Resurrection&quot; exists in extensive fragments that are preserved in the &quot;Sacra parallela&quot;. The fragments begin with the assertion that the truth, and God the author of truth, need no witness, but that as a concession to the weakness of men it is necessary to give arguments to convince those who gainsay it. It is then shown, after a denial of unfounded deductions, that the resurrection of the body is neither impossible nor unworthy of God, and that the evidence of prophecy is not lacking for it. Another fragment takes up the positive proof of the resurrection, adducing that of Christ and of those whom he recalled to life. In yet another fragment the resurrection is shown to be that of what has gone down, i.e., the body; the knowledge concerning it is the new doctrine, in contrast to that of the old philosophers. The doctrine follows from the command to keep the body in moral purity.

The authenticity of the treatise is not so generally accepted as are Justin&#x27;s other works. Even so, earlier than the &quot;Sacra parallela&quot;, it is referred to by Procopius of Gaza (c. 465–528). Methodius appeals to Justin in support of his interpretation of 1 Corinthians 15:50 in a way that makes it natural to assume the existence of a treatise on the subject, to say nothing of other traces of a connection in thought both here in Irenaeus (V., ii.-xiii. 5) and in Tertullian, where it is too close to be anything but a conscious following of the Greek. The &quot;Against Marcion&quot; is lost, as is the &quot;Refutation of all Heresies&quot; to which Justin himself refers in &quot;Apology&quot;, i. 26; Hegesippus, besides perhaps Irenaeus and Tertullian, seems to have used it.

==Role within the Church==

Flacius discovered &quot;blemishes&quot; in Justin&#x27;s theology, which he attributed to the influence of pagan philosophers; and in modern times Semler and S.G. Lange have made him out a thorough Hellene, while Semisch and Otto defend him from this charge.

In opposition to the school of Ferdinand Christian Baur, who considered him a Jewish Christian, Albrecht Ritschl has argued that it was precisely because he was a Gentile Christian that he did not fully understand the Old Testament foundation of Paul&#x27;s teaching, and explained in this way the modified character of his Paulinism and his legal mode of thought.

Engelhardt has attempted to extend this line of treatment to Justin&#x27;s entire theology, and to show that his conceptions of God, of free will and righteousness, of redemption, grace, and merit prove the influence of the cultivated Greek pagan world of the 2nd century, dominated by the Platonic and Stoic philosophy. But he admits that Justin is a Christian in his unquestioning adherence to the Church and its faith, his unqualified recognition of the Old Testament, and his faith in Christ as the Son of God the Creator, made manifest in the flesh, crucified, and risen, through which belief he succeeds in getting away from the dualism of both pagan and Gnostic philosophy.

Justin was confident that his teaching was that of the Church at large. He knows of a division among the orthodox only on the question of the millennium and on the attitude toward the milder Jewish Christianity, which he personally is willing to tolerate as long as its professors in their turn do not interfere with the liberty of the Gentile converts; his millenarianism seems to have no connection with Judaism, but he believes firmly in a millennium, and generally in the Christian eschatology.

Opposition to Judaism was common among church leaders in his day; however, Justin Martyr was hostile towards Jewry and regarded Jews as an accursed people. His anti-Judaic polemics have been cited as an origin of Christian antisemitism. However his views elaborated in the &quot;Dialogue with Trypho&quot; were tame compared to those of John Chrysostom and others.

== Christology ==
Justin, like others, thought that the Greek philosophers had derived, if not borrowed, the most essential elements of truth found in their teaching from the Old Testament. But at the same time he adopted the Stoic doctrine of the &quot;seminal word,&quot; and so philosophy was to him an operation of the Word—in fact, through his identification of the Word with Christ, it was brought into immediate connection with him.

Thus he does not hesitate to declare that Socrates and Heraclitus were Christians (&quot;Apol.&quot;, i. 46, ii. 10). His aim was to emphasize the absolute significance of Christ, so that all that ever existed of virtue and truth may be referred to him. The old philosophers and law-givers had only a part of the Logos, while the whole appears in Christ.

While the gentile peoples, seduced by devils, had deserted the true God for idols, the Jews and Samaritans possessed the revelation given through the prophets and awaited the Messiah. However, the law, while containing commandments intended to promote the true fear of God, had other prescriptions of a purely pedagogic nature, which necessarily ceased when Christ, their end, appeared; of such temporary and merely relative regulations were circumcision, animal sacrifices, the Sabbath, and the laws as to food. Through Christ, the abiding law of God has been fully proclaimed. In his character, as the teacher of the new doctrine and promulgator of the new law, lies the essential nature of his redeeming work.

The idea of an economy of grace, of a restoration of the union with God which had been destroyed by sin, is not foreign to him. It is noteworthy that in the &quot;Dialogue&quot; he no longer speaks of a &quot;seed of the Word&quot; in every man, and in his non-apologetic works the emphasis is laid upon the redeeming acts of the life of Christ rather than upon the demonstration of the reasonableness and moral value of Christianity, though the fragmentary character of the latter works make it difficult to determine exactly to what extent this is true and how far the teaching of Irenaeus on redemption is derived from him.

The 1913 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; notes that scholars have differed on whether Justin&#x27;s writings on the nature of God were meant to express his firm opinion on points of doctrine, or to speculate on these matters. Specific points Justin addressed include that the Logos is &quot;numerically distinct from the Father&quot; though &quot;born of the very substance of the Father,&quot; and that &quot;through the Word, God has made everything.&quot; Justin used the metaphor of fire to describe the Logos as spreading like a flame, rather than &quot;dividing&quot; the substance of the Father. He also defended the Holy Spirit as a member of the Trinity, as well as the virginal birth of Jesus Christ. The Encyclopedia states that Justin places the genesis of the Logos as a voluntary act of the Father at the beginning of creation, noting that this is an &quot;unfortunate&quot; conflict with later Christian teachings.
== Memoirs of the apostles ==
Justin Martyr, in his &quot;First Apology&quot; (c. 155) and &quot;Dialogue with Trypho&quot; (c. 160), sometimes refers to written sources consisting of narratives of the life of Jesus and quotations of the sayings of Jesus as &quot;memoirs of the apostles&quot; () and less frequently as gospels () which, Justin says, were read every Sunday in the church at Rome (&quot;1 Apol&quot;. 67.3 – &quot;and the memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are being read as long as it is allowable&quot;).

The designation &quot;memoirs of the apostles&quot; occurs twice in Justin&#x27;s &quot;First Apology&quot; (66.3, 67.3–4) and thirteen times in the &quot;Dialogue&quot;, mostly in his interpretation of Psalm 22, whereas the term &quot;gospel&quot; is used only three times, once in &quot;1 Apol.&quot; 66.3 and twice in the &quot;Dialogue&quot;. The single passage where Justin uses both terms (&quot;1 Apol.&quot; 66.3) makes it clear that &quot;memoirs of the apostles&quot; and &quot;gospels&quot; are equivalent, and the use of the plural indicates Justin&#x27;s awareness of more than one written gospel. (&quot;The apostles in the memoirs which have come from them, which are also called gospels, have transmitted that the Lord had commanded...&quot;). Justin may have preferred the designation &quot;memoirs of the apostles&quot; as a contrast to the &quot;gospel&quot; of his contemporary Marcion to emphasize the connections between the historical testimony of the gospels and the Old Testament prophecies which Marcion rejected.

The origin of Justin&#x27;s use of the name &quot;memoirs of the apostles&quot; as a synonym for the gospels is uncertain. Scholar David E. Aune has argued that the gospels were modeled after classical Greco-Roman biographies, and Justin&#x27;s use of the term &quot;apomnemoneumata&quot; to mean all the Synoptic Gospels should be understood as referring to a written biography such as the &quot;Memorabilia of Xenophon&quot; because they preserve the authentic teachings of Jesus. However, scholar Helmut Koester has pointed out the Latin title &quot;Memorabilia&quot; was not applied to Xenophon&#x27;s work until the Middle Ages, and it is more likely &quot;apomnemoneumata&quot; was used to describe the oral transmission of the sayings of Jesus in early Christianity. Papias uses a similar term meaning &quot;remembered&quot; (&quot;apomnemoneusen&quot;) when describing how Mark accurately recorded the &quot;recollections of Peter&quot;, and Justin also uses it in reference to Peter in &quot;Dial.&quot; 106.3, followed by a quotation found only in the Gospel of Mark (Mk 3:16–17). Therefore, according to Koester, it is likely that Justin applied the name &quot;memoirs of the apostles&quot; analogously to indicate the trustworthy recollections of the apostles found in the written record of the gospels.

Justin expounded on the gospel texts as an accurate recording of the fulfillment of prophecy, which he combined with quotations of the prophets of Israel from the LXX to demonstrate a proof from prophecy of the Christian kerygma. The importance which Justin attaches to the words of the prophets, which he regularly quotes with the formula &quot;it is written&quot;, shows his estimate of the Old Testament Scriptures. However, the scriptural authority he attributes to the &quot;memoirs of the apostles&quot; is less certain. Koester articulates a majority view among scholars that Justin considered the &quot;memoirs of the apostles&quot; to be accurate historical records but not inspired writings, whereas scholar Charles E. Hill, though acknowledging the position of mainstream scholarship, contends that Justin regarded the fulfillment quotations of the gospels to be equal in authority.

== Composition ==

=== Scriptural sources ===

==== Gospels ====
Justin uses material from the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) in the composition of the &quot;First Apology&quot; and the &quot;Dialogue&quot;, either directly, as in the case of Matthew, or indirectly through the use of a gospel harmony, which may have been composed by Justin or his school. However, his use, or even knowledge, of the Gospel of John is uncertain. One possible reference to John is a saying that is quoted in the context of a description of Christian baptism (&quot;1 Apol&quot;. 61.4 – &quot;Unless you are reborn, you cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.&quot;). However, Koester contends that Justin obtained this saying from a baptismal liturgy rather than a written gospel. Justin&#x27;s possible knowledge of John&#x27;s gospel may be suggested by verbal similarities to John 3:4 directly after the discussion about the new birth (&quot;Now, that it is impossible for those who have once been born to enter their mother&#x27;s womb is manifest to all&quot;). Justin also uses language very similar to that of John 1:20 and 1:28. Furthermore, by employing the term &quot;memoirs of the apostles&quot; and distinguishing them from the writings of their &quot;followers&quot;, Justin must have been of the belief that at least two gospels were written by actual apostles.

==== Apocalypse ====
Justin does not quote from the Book of Revelation directly, yet he clearly refers to it, naming John as its author (&quot;Dial&quot;. 81.4 &quot;Moreover also among us a man named John, one of the apostles of Christ, prophesied in a revelation made to him that those who have believed on our Christ will spend a thousand years in Jerusalem; and that hereafter the general and, in short, the eternal resurrection and judgment of all will likewise take place&quot;). Scholar Brooke Foss Westcott notes that this reference to the author of the single prophetic book of the New Testament illustrates the distinction Justin made between the role of prophecy and fulfillment quotations from the gospels, as Justin does not mention any of the individual canonical gospels by name.

==== Letters ====
The apologetic character of Justin&#x27;s habit of thought appears again in the Acts of his martyrdom, the genuineness of which is attested by internal evidence.

=== Testimony sources ===
According to scholar Oskar Skarsaune, Justin relies on two main sources for his proofs from prophecy that probably circulated as collections of scriptural testimonies within his Christian school. He refers to Justin&#x27;s primary source for demonstrating scriptural proofs in the &quot;First Apology&quot; and parallel passages in the &quot;Dialogue&quot; as a &quot;kerygma source&quot;. A second source, which was used only in the &quot;Dialogue&quot;, may be identical to a lost dialogue attributed to Aristo of Pella on the divine nature of the Messiah, the &quot;Dialogue of Jason and Papiscus&quot; (c. 140). Justin brings in biblical quotes verbatim from these sources, and he often appears to be paraphrasing his sources very closely, even in his interpretive remarks.

Justin occasionally uses the Gospel of Matthew directly as a source for Old Testament prophecies to supplement his testimony sources. However, the fulfillment quotations from these sources most often appear to be harmonizations of the gospels of Matthew and Luke. Koester suggests that Justin had composed an early harmony along the lines of his pupil Tatian&#x27;s &quot;Diatesseron&quot;. However, the existence of a harmony independent of a collection of sayings for exposition purposes has been disputed by scholar Arthur Bellinzoni. The question of whether the harmonized gospel materials found in Justin&#x27;s writings came from a preexisting gospel harmony or were assembled as part of an integral process of creating scriptural prooftexts is an ongoing subject of scholarly investigation.

==== &quot;Kerygma source&quot; ====
The following excerpt from &quot;1 Apol&quot;. 33:1,4–5 (partial parallel in &quot;Dial&quot;. 84) on the annunciation and virgin birth of Jesus shows how Justin used harmonized gospel verses from Matthew and Luke to provide a scriptural proof of the messiahship of Jesus based on fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah 7:14.

According to Skarsaune, the harmonized gospel narratives of Matthew and Luke were part of a tradition already circulating within Justin&#x27;s school that expounded on the life and work of Jesus as the Messiah and the apostolic mission. Justin then rearranged and expanded these testimonia to create his &quot;First Apology&quot;. The &quot;kerygma source&quot; of prooftexts (contained within &quot;1 Apol&quot;. 31–53) is believed to have had a Two Parousias Christology, characterized by the belief that Jesus first came in humility, in fulfillment of prophecy, and will return in glory as the Messiah to the Gentiles. There are close literary parallels between the Christology of Justin&#x27;s source and the &quot;Apocalypse of Peter&quot;.

==== &quot;Dialogue of Jason and Papiscus&quot; ====
The following excerpts from the &quot;Dialogue with Trypho&quot; of the baptism (&quot;Dial&quot;. 88:3,8) and temptation (&quot;Dial&quot;. 103:5–6) of Jesus, which are believed to have originated from the &quot;Dialogue of Jason and Papiscus&quot;, illustrate the use of gospel narratives and sayings of Jesus in a testimony source and how Justin has adopted these &quot;memoirs of the apostles&quot; for his own purposes.



The quotations refer to the fulfillment of a prophecy of Psalm 2:7 found in the Western text-type of Luke 3:22. Justin&#x27;s mention of the fire on the Jordan without comment suggests that he was relying on an intermediate source for these gospel quotations, and his literal interpretation of a pseudo-etymology of the Hebrew word Satan indicates a dependence on a testimony source with a knowledge of Hebrew, which was probably the &quot;Dialogue of Jason and Papiscus&quot;.

The &quot;Dialogue&quot; attributed to Aristo of Pella is believed to have furnished Justin with scriptural prooftexts on the divinity of the Messiah by combining a Wisdom Christology – Christ as the incarnation of preexistent Wisdom – with a Second Adam Christology – the first Adam was conquered by Satan, but this Fall of Man is reversed by Christ as the Second Adam who conquers Satan. This is implied in the pseudo-etymology in &quot;Dial&quot;. 103:5–6 linking the name of Satan to the &quot;apostate-serpent&quot;. The Christology of the source is close to that of the &quot;Ascension of Isaiah&quot;.

=== Catechetical sources ===
Justin quotes many sayings of Jesus in &quot;1 Apol&quot;. 15–17 and smaller sayings clusters in &quot;Dial&quot;. 17:3–4; 35:3; 51:2–3; and 76:4–7. The sayings are most often harmonizations of Matthew and Luke that appear to be grouped together topically and organized into sayings collections, including material that probably originated from an early Christian catechism.

The following example of an ethical teaching On Swearing Oaths in &quot;1 Apol&quot;. 16:5 shows a combination of sayings material found in Matthew and the Epistle of James:

Do not swear at all (Mt 5:34). Let your Yes be Yes and your No be No (Jas 5:12). Everything beyond these is from evil (Mt 5:37).

The saying &quot;Let your Yes be Yes and your No be No&quot; from James 5:12 is interpolated into a sayings complex from Matthew 5:34,37. The text appears in a large number of Patristic quotations and twice in the Clementine Homilies (&quot;Hom&quot;. 3:55, 19:2). Thus, it is likely that Justin was quoting this harmonized text from a catechism.

The harmonization of Matthew and Luke is evident in the following quotations of Mt 7:22–23 and Lk 13:26–27, which are used by Justin twice, in &quot;1 Apol&quot;. 16:11 and &quot;Dial&quot;. 76:5:

Many will say to me, &#x27;Lord, Lord, did we not in your name eat and drink and do powerful deeds?&#x27; And then I shall say to them, &#x27;go away from me, workers of lawlessness&#x27;.

Many will say to me on that day, &#x27;Lord, Lord, did we not in your name eat and drink and prophecy and drive out demons?&#x27; And I shall say to them, &#x27;go away from me&#x27;.

In both cases, Justin is using the same harmonized text of Matthew and Luke, although neither of the quotations includes the entire text of those gospel passages. The last phrase, &quot;workers of lawlessness&quot;, has an exact parallel with 2 Clement 4:5. This harmonized text also appears in a large number of quotations by the Church Fathers. &quot;1 Apol&quot;. 16:11 is part of a larger unit of sayings material in &quot;1 Apol&quot; 16:9–13 which combines a warning against being unprepared with a warning against false prophets. The entire unit is a carefully composed harmony of parallel texts from Matthew and Luke. This unit is part of a larger collection of sayings found in &quot;1 Apol&quot;. 15–17 that appear to have originated from a catechism used by Justin&#x27;s school in Rome, which may have had a wide circulation. Justin excerpted and rearranged the catechetical sayings material to create &quot;Apol&quot;. 15–17 and parallel passages in the &quot;Dialogue&quot;.

=== Other sources ===
Justin includes a tract on Greek mythology in &quot;1 Apol&quot;. 54 and &quot;Dial&quot;. 69 which asserts that myths about various pagan deities are imitations of the prophecies about Christ in the Old Testament. There is also a small tract in &quot;1 Apol&quot;. 59–60 on borrowings of the philosophers from Moses, particularly Plato. These two tracts may be from the same source, which may have been an early Christian &quot;Apology&quot;.

==Prophetic exegesis==
Justin&#x27;s writings constitute a storehouse of early interpretation of the prophetic Scriptures.

===Belief in prophecy===
The truth of the prophets, he declares, compels assent. He considered the Old Testament an inspired guide and counselor. He was converted by a Christian philosopher whom he paraphrased as saying:
:&quot;There existed, long before this time, certain men more ancient than all those who are esteemed philosophers, both righteous and beloved by God, who spoke by the Divine Spirit, and foretold events which would take place, and which are now taking place. They are called prophets. These alone both saw and announced the truth to men, neither reverencing nor fearing any man, not influenced by a desire for glory, but speaking those things alone which they saw and which they heard, being filled with the Holy Spirit. Their writings are still extant, and he who has read them is very much helped in his knowledge of the beginning and end of things. . . And those events which have happened, and those which are happening, compel you to assent to the utterances made by them.&quot;

Then Justin told his own experience:
:&quot;Straightway a flame was kindled in my soul; and a love of the prophets, and of those men who are friends of Christ, possessed me; and whilst revolving his words in my mind, I found this philosophy alone to be safe and profitable.&quot;

===Fulfillment===
Justin listed the following events as fulfillments of Bible prophecy:

* The prophecies concerning the Messiah, and the particulars of His life.
* The destruction of Jerusalem.
* The Gentiles accepting Christianity.
* Isaiah predicted that Jesus would be born of a virgin.
* Micah mentions Bethlehem as the place of His birth.
* Zechariah forecasts His entry into Jerusalem on the foal of an ass (a donkey).

===Second Advent and Daniel 7===
Justin connected the Second Advent with the climax of the prophecy of Daniel 7.
:&quot;But if so great a power is shown to have followed and to be still following the dispensation of His suffering, how great shall that be which shall follow His glorious advent! For He shall come on the clouds as the Son of man, so Daniel foretold, and His angels shall come with Him. [Then follows Dan. 7:9–28.]&quot;

===Antichrist===
The second advent Justin placed close upon the heels of the appearance of the &quot;man of apostasy&quot;, i.e., the Antichrist.

===Time, times, and a half===
Daniel&#x27;s &quot;time, times, and a half&quot;, Justin believed, was nearing its consummation, when the Antichrist would speak his blasphemies against the Most High.

===Eucharist===
Justin&#x27;s statements are some of the earliest Christian expressions on the Eucharist.
:&quot;And this food is called among us Εὐχαριστία [the Eucharist] ... For not as common bread and common drink do we receive these; but in like manner as Jesus Christ our Saviour, having been made flesh by the Word of God, had both flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise have we been taught that the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which our blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished, is the flesh and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh.&quot;

<doc id="16407" wikidata="Q76873" url="?curid=16407" title="Johann Tetzel">
<text>Johann Tetzel (c. 1465 – 11 August 1519) was a German Dominican friar and preacher. He was appointed Inquisitor for Poland and Saxony, later becoming the Grand Commissioner for indulgences in Germany. Tetzel was known for granting indulgences on behalf of the Catholic Church in exchange for tithes to the Church. Indulgences grant a degree of expiation of the punishments of purgatory due to sin. However, the misuse of indulgences within the Church largely contributed to Martin Luther writing his Ninety-five Theses. The main usage of the indulgences by Tetzel was to help fund and build the new St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome.

==Life==
Tetzel was born in Pirna, Saxony, and studied theology and philosophy at Leipzig University. He entered the Dominican order in 1489, became a famous preacher, and was in 1502 commissioned by Cardinal Giovanni de&#x27; Medici, later Pope Leo X, to preach the Jubilee indulgence, which he did throughout his life. In 1509 he was made an inquisitor of Poland and, in January 1517 was made commissioner of indulgences for Archbishop Albrecht von Brandenburg in the dioceses of Magdeburg and Halberstadt.

He acquired the degree of Licentiate of Sacred Theology in the University of Frankfurt an der Oder in 1517, and then of Doctor of Sacred Theology in 1518, by defending in two disputations, the doctrine of indulgences against Martin Luther. The accusation that he had sold full forgiveness for sins not yet committed caused a great scandal. It was believed that all of the money that Tetzel raised was for the ongoing reconstruction of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, although half the money went to the Archbishop of Mainz, Cardinal Albert of Brandenburg (under whose authority Tetzel was operating), to pay off the debts incurred in securing Albert&#x27;s appointment to the archbishopric. Tetzel made much of his money by selling his indulgences throughout Leipzig. The way that he persuaded many people to buy his indulgences was offering access directly to heaven even for people who were already dead and in purgatory. He was very good at his job which led him to be paid very well. Men would even announce, weeks in advance, of his arrival to town. The things that Tetzel was doing was something Luther did not agree with. Luther began to preach openly against him and was inspired to write his famous &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot; in part due to Tetzel&#x27;s actions, in which he states,

Tetzel was also accused, but exonerated, of immorality. When Karl von Miltitz accused him of perpetrating frauds and embezzlements, he withdrew to the Dominican monastery in Leipzig where, worn out by the controversies surrounding him, he died in 1519. Miltitz was later discredited to the point where his claims carry no historical weight.

When Luther heard that Tetzel was mortally ill and on his deathbed, he wrote to comfort him and bade him &quot;not to be troubled, for the matter did not begin on his account, but the child had quite a different father.&quot;
After his death, he was given an honorable burial and interred before the high altar of the Dominican Church in Leipzig.

==Doctrinal positions==
Tetzel overstated Catholic doctrine in regard to indulgences for the dead. He became known for a couplet attributed to him: 
&lt;poem&gt;
As soon as the gold in the casket rings
The rescued soul to heaven springs
&lt;/poem&gt;

This oft-quoted saying was by no means representative of the official Catholic teaching on indulgences, but rather, more a reflection of Tetzel&#x27;s capacity to exaggerate. Yet if Tetzel overstated the matter in regard to indulgences for the dead, his teaching on indulgences for the living was pure Catholic teaching. The German Catholic historian Ludwig von Pastor explains:

Above all, a most clear distinction must be made between indulgences for the living and those for the dead.&lt;br&gt;
As regards indulgences for the living, Tetzel always taught pure (Catholic) doctrine. The assertion that he put forward indulgences as being not only a remission of the temporal punishment of sin but as a remission of its guilt, is as unfounded as is that other accusation against him, that he sold the forgiveness of sin for money, without even any mention of contrition and confession, or that, for payment, he absolved from sins which might be committed in the future. His teaching was, in fact, very definite, and quite in harmony with the theology of the (Catholic) Church, as it was then and as it is now, i.e., that indulgences &quot;apply only to the temporal punishment due to sins which have been already repented of and confessed&quot;...

The case was very different from indulgences for the dead. As regards these there is no doubt that Tetzel did, according to what he considered his authoritative instructions, proclaim as Christian doctrine that nothing but an offering of money was required to gain the indulgence for the dead, without there being any question of contrition or confession. He also taught, in accordance with the opinion then held, that an indulgence could be applied to any given soul with unfailing effect. Starting from this assumption, there is no doubt that his doctrine was virtually that of the well known drastic proverb.

The Papal Bull of indulgence gave no sanction whatever to this proposition. It was a vague scholastic opinion, rejected by the Sorbonne in 1482, and again in 1518, and certainly not a doctrine of the Church, which was thus improperly put forward as dogmatic truth. The first among the theologians of the Roman court, Cardinal Cajetan, was the enemy of all such extravagances and declared emphatically that, even if theologians and preachers taught such opinions, no faith need be given them. &quot;Preachers&quot;, he said, &quot;speak in the name of the Church only so long as they proclaim the doctrine of Christ and His Church; but if, for purposes of their own, they teach that about which they know nothing, and which is only their own imagination, they must not be accepted as mouthpieces of the Church. No one must be surprised if such as these fall into error.&quot;

==Luther&#x27;s impression==
Luther claimed Tetzel had received a substantial amount of money at Leipzig from a nobleman, who asked him for a letter of indulgence for a future sin he would commit. Supposedly Tetzel answered in the affirmative, insisting that the payment had to be made at once. The nobleman did so and received a letter and seal from Tetzel.

However, when Tetzel left Leipzig, the nobleman attacked him along the way and gave him a thorough beating, sending him back empty-handed to Leipzig, saying that was the future sin which he had in mind. Duke George at first was quite furious about the incident, but when he heard the whole story, he let it go without punishing the nobleman.

Luther also claimed that at Halle, Tetzel said that an indulgence could wipe away the sin of a man guilty of raping Mary, Mother of God. However, Tetzel obtained affidavits from authorities at Halle, both civil and ecclesiastical, who swore that Tetzel never made any such claim.

==In popular culture==
Tetzel has been portrayed on stage and screen by the following:

*Jakob Tiedtke in the 1928 German film &quot;Luther&quot;.
*Alexander Gauge in the 1953 film &quot;Martin Luther&quot;.
*In John Osborne&#x27;s 1961 play &quot;Luther&quot;, Tetzel was played by Peter Bull in the original London and Broadway productions, Hugh Griffith in the 1973 film of the play, and Richard Griffiths in a 2001 National Theatre revival.
*Clive Swift in the 1983 film &quot;Martin Luther, Heretic&quot;.
*Alfred Molina in the 2003 film &quot;Luther&quot;.

<doc id="16412" wikidata="Q234928" url="?curid=16412" title="James Tiptree Jr.">
<text>Alice Bradley Sheldon, better known as James Tiptree Jr. (born Alice Hastings Bradley; August 24, 1915 – May 19, 1987) was an American science fiction and fantasy author. It was not publicly known until 1977 that James Tiptree Jr. was a pen name of a woman, which she used from 1967 until her death. From 1974 to 1985, she also occasionally used the pen name Raccoona Sheldon. Tiptree was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2012.

Tiptree&#x27;s debut story collection, &quot;Ten Thousand Light-Years from Home&quot;, was published in 1973 and her first novel, &quot;Up the Walls of the World&quot;, was published in 1978. Her other works include the 1973 novelette &quot;The Women Men Don&#x27;t See&quot;, the 1974 novella &quot;The Girl Who Was Plugged In&quot;, the 1976 novella &quot;Houston, Houston, Do You Read?&quot;, the 1985 novel &quot;Brightness Falls from the Air&quot;, and the 1974 short story &quot;Her Smoke Rose Up Forever&quot;&quot;.&quot;

==Early life, family and education==
Alice Hastings Bradley came from a family in the intellectual enclave of Hyde Park, a university neighborhood in Chicago. Her father was Herbert Edwin Bradley, a lawyer and naturalist, and her mother was Mary Hastings Bradley, a prolific writer of fiction and travel books. From an early age she traveled with her parents, and in 1921–22, the family made their first trip to central Africa. During these trips, she played the role of the &quot;perfect daughter, willing to be carried across Africa like a parcel, always neatly dressed and well behaved, a credit to her mother.&quot; This later contributed to her short story, &quot;The Women Men Don&#x27;t See.&quot;

She is the title character in two non-fiction accounts by her mother of their travels: &quot;Alice in Jungleland&quot; (1927) and &quot;Alice in Elephantland&quot; (1929). These were both travel books for children which included photos of young Alice visiting parts of Africa not yet fully discovered by Westerners. The illustrated cover of &quot;Alice in Jungleland&quot; is credited to Alice Hastings Bradley.

Between trips to Africa, Bradley attended school in Chicago. At the age of ten, she went to the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, which was an experimental teaching workshop with small classes and loose structure. When she was fourteen, she was sent to finishing school in Lausanne in Switzerland, before returning to the US to attend boarding school in Tarrytown in New York.

== Adulthood and early career: 1934–1967 ==
Bradley was encouraged by her mother to seek a career, but her mother also hoped that she would get married and settle down. In 1934, at age 19, she met William (Bill) Davey and eloped to marry him. She dropped out of Sarah Lawrence College, which did not allow married students to attend. They moved to Berkeley, California, where they took classes and Davey encouraged her to pursue art. The marriage was not a success; he was an alcoholic and irresponsible with money and she disliked keeping house. The couple divorced in 1940. Later on, she became a graphic artist, a painter, and—still under the name &quot;Alice Bradley Davey&quot;—an art critic for the &quot;Chicago Sun&quot; between 1941 and 1942.

After the divorce, Bradley joined the Women&#x27;s Army Auxiliary Corps where she became a supply officer. In 1942 she joined the United States Army Air Forces and worked in the Army Air Forces photo-intelligence group. She later was promoted to major, a high rank for women at the time. In the army, she &quot;felt she was among free women for the first time.&quot; As an intelligence officer, she became an expert in reading aerial intelligence photographs.

In 1945, at the close of the war, while she was on assignment in Paris, she married her second husband, Huntington D. Sheldon, known as &quot;Ting.&quot; She was discharged from the military in 1946, at which time she set up a small business in partnership with her husband. The same year, a non-fiction piece about Polish refugees working in Germany (entitled &quot;The Lucky Ones&quot;) was published in the November 16, 1946 issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and credited to &quot;Alice Bradley&quot; in the magazine. In 1952 she and her husband were invited to join the CIA, which she accepted. At the CIA, she worked as an intelligence officer, but she did not enjoy the work. She resigned her position in 1955 and returned to college.

She studied for her bachelor of arts degree at American University (1957–1959). She received a doctorate from George Washington University in Experimental Psychology in 1967. She wrote her doctoral dissertation on the responses of animals to novel stimuli in differing environments. During this time, she wrote and submitted a few science fiction stories under the name James Tiptree Jr., in order to protect her academic reputation.

=== Art career ===
Bradley began illustrating when she was nine years old, contributing to her mother&#x27;s book, &quot;Alice in Elephantland&quot;, a children&#x27;s book about the family&#x27;s second trip to Africa, appearing in it as herself. She later had an exhibit of her drawings of Africa at the Chicago Gallery, arranged by her parents. Although she illustrated several of her mother&#x27;s books, she only sold one illustration during her lifetime, in 1931, to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, with help from Harold Ober, a New York agent who worked with her mother. The illustration, of a horse rearing and throwing off its rider, sold for ten dollars.

In 1936, Bradley participated in a group show at the Art Institute of Chicago, to which she had connections through her family, featuring new American work. This was an important step forward for her painting career. During this time she also took private art lessons from John Sloan. Bradley disliked prudery in painting. While examining an anatomy book for an art class, she noticed that the genitals were blurred, so she restored the genitals of the figures with a pencil.

In 1939, her nude self-portrait titled &quot;Portrait in the Country&quot; was accepted for the &quot;All-American&quot; biennial show at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington D.C., where it was displayed for six weeks. While these two shows were considered big breaks, she disparaged these accomplishments, saying that &quot;only second rate painters sold&quot; and she preferred to keep her works at home.

By 1940, Bradley felt she had mastered all the techniques she needed and was ready to choose her subject matter. However, she began to doubt whether she should paint. She kept working at her painting techniques, fascinated with the questions of form, and read books on aesthetics in order to know what scientifically made a painting &quot;good.&quot; She stopped painting in 1941. As she was in need of a way to support herself, her parents helped her find a job as an art critic for the &quot;Chicago Sun&quot;.

==Science fiction career: 1967–1987==
Bradley discovered science fiction in 1924, when she read her first issue of &quot;Weird Tales,&quot; but she didn&#x27;t write any herself until years later. Unsure what to do with her new degrees and her new/old careers, she began to write science fiction. She adopted the pseudonym of James Tiptree Jr. in 1967. The name &quot;Tiptree&quot; came from a branded jar of marmalade, and the &quot;Jr.&quot; was her husband&#x27;s idea. In an interview, she said: &quot;A male name seemed like good camouflage. I had the feeling that a man would slip by less observed. I&#x27;ve had too many experiences in my life of being the first woman in some damned occupation.&quot; She also made the choice to start writing science fiction she, herself, was interested in and &quot;was surprised to find that her stories were immediately accepted for publication and quickly became popular.&quot;

Her first published short story was &quot;Birth of a Salesman&quot; in the March 1968 issue of &quot;Analog Science Fact &amp; Fiction&quot;, edited by John W. Campbell. Three more followed that year in &quot;If&quot; and &quot;Fantastic&quot;. Other pen names that she used included &quot;Alice Hastings Bradley&quot;, &quot;Major Alice Davey&quot;, &quot;Alli B. Sheldon&quot;, &quot;Dr. Alice B. Sheldon&quot;, and &quot;Raccoona Sheldon&quot;.

Writing under the pseudonym Raccoona, she was not very successful getting published until her other alter ego, Tiptree, wrote to publishers to intervene.

The pseudonym was successfully maintained until late 1977, partly because, although &quot;Tiptree&quot; was widely known to be a pseudonym, it was generally understood that its use was intended to protect the professional reputation of an intelligence community official. Readers, editors and correspondents were permitted to assume gender, and generally, but not invariably, they assumed &quot;male&quot;. There was speculation, based partially on the themes in her stories, that Tiptree might be female. In 1975, in the introduction to &quot;Warm Worlds and Otherwise,&quot; a collection of Tiptree&#x27;s short stories, Robert Silverberg wrote: &quot;[i]t has been suggested that Tiptree is female, a theory that I find absurd, for there is to me something ineluctably masculine about Tiptree&#x27;s writing.&quot; Silverberg also likened Tiptree&#x27;s writing to Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s, arguing there was a &quot;prevailing masculinity about both of them—that preoccupation with questions of courage, with absolute values, with the mysteries and passions of life and death as revealed by extreme physical tests, by pain and suffering and loss.&quot;&quot;Tiptree&quot; never made any public appearances, but she did correspond regularly with fans and other science fiction authors through the mail. When asked for biographical details, Tiptree/Sheldon was forthcoming in everything but her gender. According to her biographer, Julie Phillips, &quot;No one had ever seen or spoken to the owner of this voice. He wrote letters, warm, frank, funny letters, to other writers, editors, and science fiction fans&quot;. In her letters to fellow writers such as Ursula K. Le Guin and Joanna Russ, she would present herself as a feminist man; however, Sheldon did not present herself as male in person. Writing was a way to escape a male-dominated society, themes Tiptree explored in the short stories later collected in &quot;Her Smoke Rose Up Forever&quot;. One story in particular offers an excellent illustration of these themes. &quot;Houston, Houston, Do You Read?&quot; follows a group of astronauts who discover a future Earth whose male population has been wiped out; the remaining females have learned to get along just fine in their absence.

In 1976, &quot;Tiptree&quot; mentioned in a letter that &quot;his&quot; mother, also a writer, had died in Chicago—details that led inquiring fans to find the obituary, with its reference to Alice Sheldon; soon all was revealed. Once the initial shock was over, Sheldon wrote to Le Guin, one of her closest friends, confessing her identity. She wrote, &quot;I never wrote you anything but the exact truth, there was no calculation or intent to deceive, other than the signature which over 8 years became just another nickname; everything else is just plain me. The thing is, I am a 61-year-old woman named Alice Sheldon—nickname Alli—solitary by nature but married for 37 years to a very nice man considerably older [Huntington was 12 years her senior], who doesn&#x27;t read my stuff but is glad I like writing&quot;.

After Sheldon&#x27;s identity was revealed, several prominent science fiction writers suffered some embarrassment. Robert Silverberg, who had argued that Tiptree could not be a woman from the evidence of her stories, added a postscript to his introduction to the second edition of Tiptree&#x27;s &quot;Warm Worlds and Otherwise&quot;, published in 1979. Harlan Ellison had introduced Tiptree&#x27;s story in the anthology &quot;Again, Dangerous Visions&quot; with the opinion that &quot;[Kate] Wilhelm is the woman to beat this year, but Tiptree is the man&quot;.

Only then did she complete her first full-length novel, &quot;Up the Walls of the World&quot;, which was a Doubleday Science Fiction Book Club selection. Before that she had worked on and built a reputation only in the field of short stories.

=== Themes ===

A constant theme in Sheldon&#x27;s work is gender; she was influenced by the rise of second-wave feminism. A strong example is &quot;The Women Men Don&#x27;t See&quot; (1973), where Sheldon, as in most of her stories, devises a convincing male point of view. We see the two women in the story (Ruth Parsons and her daughter) through the eyes of Don Fenton, who assesses them critically as possible sexual partners and is also concerned to protect them. He is confused when Ruth shows courage and common sense, failing to &quot;fulfill stereotypical female roles,&quot; according to Anne Cranny-Francis. Ruth tries to explain the alienation of women in general and herself in particular, but to Fenton it seems nonsense. The Parsons&#x27; decision to leave Earth on an alien spaceship jars him into, if not understanding, at least remembering Ruth&#x27;s words. The title of the short story itself reflects the idea that women are invisible during Sheldon&#x27;s time. As Cranny-Francis states, &quot;&#x27;The Women Men Don&#x27;t See&#x27; is an outstanding example … of the subversive use of genre fiction to produce an unconventional discursive position, the feminist subject.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
Sheldon continued writing under the Tiptree pen name for another decade. In the last years of her life, she suffered from depression and heart trouble, while her husband began to lose his eyesight, becoming almost completely blind in 1986. In 1976, then 61-year-old Sheldon wrote to Silverberg expressing her desire to end her own life while she was still able-bodied and active; she said that she was reluctant to act upon this intention, as she did not want to leave her husband behind and could not bring herself to kill him. Later, she suggested to her husband that they make a suicide pact when their health began to fail. On July 21, 1977, she wrote in her diary: &quot;Ting agreed to consider suicide in 4–5 years&quot;.

Ten years later, on May 19, 1987, Sheldon shot her husband and then herself; she telephoned her attorney after the first shooting to announce her actions. They were found dead, hand-in-hand in bed, in their Virginia home. According to biographer Julie Phillips, the suicide note Sheldon left was written in September 1979 and saved until needed. Although the circumstances surrounding the Sheldons&#x27; deaths are not clear enough to rule out caregiver murder–suicide (in that perhaps her husband was not ready to die), testimony of those closest to them suggests a suicide pact.

== Sexual orientation ==
Sheldon was attracted to women throughout her life and described herself as a lesbian in the years before her death. In 1980 she wrote to Joanna Russ and stated &quot;I am a Lesbian [...] I some men a lot, but from the start, before I knew anything it was always girls and women who lit me up&quot;. Sheldon had affairs with men and &quot;passionate crushes&quot; on women during her first marriage, and later remarked &quot;the 2 or 3 great loves of my life were girls&quot;.

== James Tiptree Jr. Award ==
The James Tiptree Jr. Award, honoring works of science fiction and fantasy that expand or explore the understanding of gender, was created by authors Karen Joy Fowler and Pat Murphy in February 1991. Works of fiction such as &quot;Half Life&quot; by Shelley Jackson and &quot;Light&quot; by M. John Harrison have received the award. Due to controversy over the circumstances of her and her husband&#x27;s deaths, the name of the award was changed to the Otherwise Award in 2019.

Reviewer Jen Gunnels writes, &quot;The performance juxtaposed some of Tiptree&#x27;s short stories with Converse&#x27;s songs, mixing in biographical elements of both women while kinesthetically exploring both through dance and aerial work on trapeze, lyra (an aerial ring), and silks (two lengths of fabric which the artist manipulates to perform aerial acrobatics). The result was elegant, eerie, and deeply moving.&quot;

<text>The Otherwise Award, originally known as the James Tiptree Jr. Award, is an American annual literary prize for works of science fiction or fantasy that expand or explore one&#x27;s understanding of gender. It was initiated in February 1991 by science fiction authors Pat Murphy and Karen Joy Fowler, subsequent to a discussion at WisCon.

In addition to the award itself, the judges publish an Honor List, which they describe as &quot;a strong part of the award&#x27;s identity and ... used by many readers as a recommended reading list.&quot;

The award was originally named for Alice B. Sheldon, who wrote under the pseudonym James Tiptree Jr. Due to controversy over the appropriateness of naming an award after Tiptree, the committee administering the award announced on October 13, 2019, that the award would be renamed the Otherwise Award.

==Background==
===Choice of the Tiptree name===
By choosing a masculine &quot;nom de plume&quot;, having her stories accepted under that name and winning awards with them, Alice Sheldon helped demonstrate that the division between male and female science fiction writing was illusory. Years after &quot;Tiptree&quot; first published science fiction, Sheldon wrote some work under the female pen name &quot;Raccoona Sheldon&quot;; later, the science fiction world discovered that &quot;Tiptree&quot; had been female all along. This discovery led to widespread discussion over which aspects of writing, if any, have an intrinsic gender. To remind audiences of the role gender plays in both reading and writing, the award was named in Sheldon&#x27;s honor at the suggestion of Karen Joy Fowler.

===Controversy and name change===
In 2019, controversy arose over the appropriateness of naming an award after Tiptree. In 1987, Alice Sheldon shot and killed her ailing husband Huntington Sheldon before killing herself in the same manner. Although some have called the killing a &quot;suicide pact&quot; based on Sheldon&#x27;s personal writings, others characterize the act as &quot;caregiver murder&quot;—i.e., the murder of a disabled person by the person responsible for caring for them. In light of these allegations, the Tiptree Motherboard received requests to change the name of the award. On September 2, 2019, in response to these requests, the Motherboard made a statement that &quot;a change to the name of the Tiptree Award is [not] warranted now&quot;; but nine days later, on September 11, they announced that the award &quot;can&#x27;t go on under its existing name&quot;.

On October 13, 2019, the Tiptree Motherboard released an announcement stating that the Tiptree Award would become the Otherwise Award. The name refers to &quot;the act of imagining gender otherwise&quot; at the core of what the award has always honored, as well as being &quot;wise to the experience of being the other&quot;. The title also draws from the Black queer scholarship of Ashon Crawley around what is termed &quot;otherwise politics&quot;. According to the statement, &quot;&quot;Otherwise&quot; means finding different directions to move in—toward newly possible places, by means of emergent and multiple pathways and methods.&quot;

==Administration==
The Tiptree award is administered by the Tiptree &quot;Motherboard&quot;.

Fundraising efforts for the Tiptree include publications (two cookbooks), &quot;feminist bake sales&quot;, and auctions. The Tiptree cookbook &quot;The Bakery Men Don&#x27;t See&quot;, edited by WisCon co-founder Jeanne Gomoll, was nominated for a 1992 Hugo Award. Tiptree Award juries traditionally consist of four female and one male juror (the &quot;token man&quot;). 

In 2011, the Tiptree Motherboard received the Science Fiction Research Association&#x27;s Thomas D. Clareson Award for Distinguished Service for its &quot;outstanding service activities – promotion of SF teaching and study, editing, reviewing, editorial writing, publishing, organizing meetings, mentoring, and leadership in SF/fantasy organizations&quot;.

==Anthologies==
Selections of the winners, various short-listed fiction, and essays have appeared in four Tiptree-related collections, &quot;Flying Cups and Saucers&quot; (1999) and a series of annual anthologies published by Tachyon Publications of San Francisco. These include:
* &quot;Flying Cups and Saucers: Gender Explorations in Science Fiction and Fantasy&quot; edited by The Secret Feminist Cabal and Debbie Notkin (1999)
* &quot;The James Tiptree Award Anthology 1&quot; edited by Karen Joy Fowler, Pat Murphy, Debbie Notkin, and Jeffrey D. Smith (2005)

<doc id="16415" wikidata="Q1422" url="?curid=16415" title="Juventus FC">
<text>Juventus Football Club (from , &#x27;youth&#x27;; ), commonly known as Juventus or colloquially as Juve (), is an Italian professional football club based in Turin, Piedmont, who compete in Serie A, the top tier of the Italian football league system. Founded in 1897 by a group of Torinese students, the club played in different grounds around the city, and plays now in Juventus Stadium.

Nicknamed (&quot;the Old Lady&quot;), it has won 36 official league titles, 15 Coppa Italia trophies and nine Italian Super Cups, being the record holder for all these competitions; they also hold two Intercontinental Cups, two European Cup / UEFA Champions Leagues, one European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, three UEFA Cups (Italian record), two UEFA Super Cups and one UEFA Intertoto Cup (Italian record). Consequently, the side leads the historical Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (FIGC) classification, whilst on the international stage the club occupies the sixth position in Europe and the twelfth in the world for most confederation titles won with eleven trophies, as well as the fourth in the all-time Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) competitions ranking, having obtained the highest coefficient score during seven seasons since its introduction in 1979, the most for an Italian team in both cases and joint second overall in the last cited.

Founded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus, initially as an athletics club, it is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa&#x27;s football section (1893) and has competed every season of the premier club division (reformulated in different formats until the Serie A inception in 1929) since its debut in 1900 with the exception of the 2006–07 season, being managed by the industrial Agnelli family almost continuously since 1923. The relationship between the club and that dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports, making Juventus one of the first professional sporting clubs &quot;&quot; in the country, having established itself as a major force in the national stage since the 1930s and at confederation level since the mid-1970s, and becoming, in a nearly stable basis, one of the top-ten wealthiest in world football in terms of value, revenue and profit since the mid-1990s, being listed on the Borsa Italiana since 2001.

Under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni, the club won 13 trophies in the ten years before 1986, including six league titles and five international tournaments, and became the first to win all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations: the 1976–77 UEFA Cup (first Southern European side to do so), the 1983–84 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and the 1984–85 European Champions&#x27; Cup. With successive triumphs in the 1984 European Super Cup and 1985 Intercontinental Cup, it became the first and thus far only in the world to complete a clean sweep of all five historical confederation trophies; an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup after another successful era led by Marcello Lippi, becoming in addition, until 2022, the only professional Italian club to have won every ongoing honour available to the first team and organised by a national or international football association. In December 2000, Juventus was placed seventh in the FIFA&#x27;s historic ranking of the best clubs in the world, and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th century based on a statistical study series by the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics (IFFHS), the highest for an Italian club in both.

The club&#x27;s fan base is the largest at the national level and one of the largest worldwide. Unlike most European sporting supporters&#x27; groups, which are often concentrated around their own club&#x27;s city of origin, it is widespread throughout the whole country and the Italian diaspora, making Juventus a symbol of &quot;&quot; (&quot;anti-parochialism&quot;) and (&quot;Italianness&quot;). Juventus players have won eight Ballon d&#x27;Or awards, four of these in consecutive years (1982–1985, an overall joint record), among these Michel Platini as well as three of the five recipients with Italian nationality as the first player representing Serie A, Omar Sívori, and the former member of the youth sector Paolo Rossi; they have also won four FIFA World Player of the Year awards, with winners as Roberto Baggio and Zinedine Zidane, a national record and third and joint second highest overall, respectively, in the cited prizes. Finally, the club has also provided the most players to the Italy national team—mostly in official competitions in almost uninterrupted way since 1924—who often formed the group that led the &quot;Azzurri&quot; squad to international success, most importantly in the 1934, 1982 and 2006 FIFA World Cups.

== History ==
=== Early years (1897–1918) ===

Juventus was founded as Sport-Club Juventus in late 1897 by pupils from the Massimo d&#x27;Azeglio Lyceum school in Turin, among them Eugenio Canfari and Enrico Canfari. It was renamed as Foot-Ball Club Juventus two years later. The club joined the 1900 Italian Football Championship. Juventus played their first Italian Football Championship match on 11 March 1900 in a 1–0 defeat against Torinese.
In 1904, businessman Marco Ajmone-Marsan revived the finances of Juventus, making it possible to transfer the training field from piazza d&#x27;armi to the more appropriate Velodrome Umberto I. During this period, the team wore a pink and black kit. Juventus first won the 1905 Italian Football Championship while playing at their Velodrome Umberto I ground. By this time, the club colours had changed to black and white stripes, inspired by English side Notts County.

There was a split at the club in 1906, after some of the staff considered moving Juve out of Turin. Alfred Dick, the club&#x27;s president, was unhappy with this, and left with some prominent players to found FBC Torino, which in turn spawned the &quot;Derby della Mole&quot;. Juventus spent much of this period steadily rebuilding after the split, surviving the First World War.

In 1913, Juventus was relegated to the second division after ended in last place, but after pressure made by their executives to the Italian Federation, it was decided to increase the number of teams in the following season, that permitted Juventus to remain in the top league.

=== League dominance (1923–1980) ===

In 1922, a new stadium was inaugurated and, a year later, FIAT vice president Edoardo Agnelli was elected club&#x27;s president. These two events helped the club to its second league championship in the 1925–26 Prima Divisione, after beating Alba Roma in a two-legged final with an aggregate score of 12–1. The club established itself as a major force in Italian football in the 1930s, becoming the country&#x27;s first professional club and the first with a decentralised fan base. This led Juventus to win a record of five consecutive Italian football championships and form the core of the Italy national football team during the Vittorio Pozzo era, including the 1934 FIFA World Cup winning squad, with star players like Raimundo Orsi, Luigi Bertolini, Giovanni Ferrari, and Luis Monti, among others.

Juventus moved to the Stadio Comunale, but for the rest of the 1930s and the majority of the 1940s they were unable to recapture championship dominance. After the Second World War, Gianni Agnelli was appointed president. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the club added two more league championships to its name, winning the 1949–50 Serie A under the management of Englishman Jesse Carver, and then repeating in the 1951–52 Serie A. For the 1957–58 Serie A, two new strikers, Welshman John Charles and Italian Argentine Omar Sívori, were signed to play alongside longtime member Giampiero Boniperti. In the 1959–60 Juventus F.C. season, they beat Fiorentina to complete their first league and cup double, winning the 1959–60 Serie A and the 1960 Coppa Italia final. Boniperti retired in 1961 as the all-time top scorer at the club, with 182 goals in all competitions, a club record that stood for 45 years.

During the rest of the decade, the club only won the 1966–67 Serie A. The 1970s saw Juventus further solidify their strong position in Italian football, and under former player Čestmír Vycpálek they won the &quot;scudetto&quot; in the 1971–72 Serie A, and followed through in the 1972–73 Serie A, with players like as Roberto Bettega, Franco Causio, and José Altafini breaking through. During the rest of the decade, they won the league thrice more, with defender Gaetano Scirea contributing significantly. The latter two success in Serie A was under Giovanni Trapattoni, who also led the club to their first ever major European title, the 1976–77 UEFA Cup, and helped the club&#x27;s domination continue on into the early part of the 1980s.

=== European stage (1980–1993) ===

The club led under Trapattoni in the 1980s brought them the league title three more times by 1984. This meant Juventus had won 20 Italian league titles and were allowed to add a second golden star to their shirt, becoming the only Italian club to achieve this. Around this time, the club&#x27;s players were attracting considerable attention, and Paolo Rossi was named European Footballer of the Year following his contribution to Italy&#x27;s victory in the 1982 FIFA World Cup, where he was named Player of the Tournament.

Frenchman Michel Platini was awarded the European Footballer of the Year title for three years in a row in 1983, 1984 and 1985, which is a record. Juventus are the first and one of the only two clubs to have players from their club winning the award in four consecutive years. It was Platini who scored the winning goal in the 1985 European Cup final against Liverpool; this was marred by the Heysel Stadium disaster, which changed European football. That year, Juventus became the first club in the history of European football to have won all three major UEFA competitions; after their triumph in the 1985 Intercontinental Cup, the club also became the first and thus far the only in association football history to have won all five possible confederation competitions, an achievement that it revalidated with a sixth title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup.

With the exception of winning the closely contested 1985–86 Serie A, the rest of the 1980s were not very successful for the club. As well as having to contend with Diego Maradona&#x27;s Napoli, both of the Milanese clubs, A.C. Milan and Inter Milan, won Italian championships; Juventus achieved a double by winning the 1989–90 Coppa Italia and the 1990 UEFA Cup final under the guidance of former club legend Dino Zoff. In 1990, Juventus also moved into their new home, the Stadio delle Alpi, which was built for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Despite the arrival of Italian star Roberto Baggio later that year for a world football transfer record fee, the early 1990s under Luigi Maifredi and subsequently Trapattoni once again also saw little success for Juventus, as they only managed to win the 1993 UEFA Cup final.

=== Renewed international success (1994–2004) ===

Marcello Lippi took over as Juventus manager at the start of the 1994–95 Serie A. His first season at the helm of the club was a successful one, as Juventus recorded their first Serie A championship title since the mid-1980s, as well as the 1995 Coppa Italia final. The crop of players during this period featured Ciro Ferrara, Roberto Baggio, Gianluca Vialli, and a young Alessandro Del Piero. Lippi led Juventus to the 1995 Supercoppa Italiana and the 1995–96 UEFA Champions League, beating Ajax on penalties after a 1–1 draw in which Fabrizio Ravanelli scored for Juventus.

The club did not rest long after winning the European Cup, as more highly regarded players were brought into the fold in the form of Zinedine Zidane, Filippo Inzaghi, and Edgar Davids. At home, Juventus won the 1996–97 Serie A, successfully defended their title in the 1997–98 Serie A, won the 1996 UEFA Super Cup, and followed through with the 1996 Intercontinental Cup. Juventus reached two consecutive Champions League finals during this period but lost out to Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid, respectively in 1997 and 1998.

After a two-and-a-half-season absence, Lippi returned to the club in 2001, following his replacement Carlo Ancelotti&#x27;s dismissal, signing big name players like Gianluigi Buffon, David Trezeguet, Pavel Nedvěd, and Lilian Thuram, helping the team to win the 2001–02 Serie A, which was their first since 1998, and confirmed themselves in the 2002–03 Serie A. Juventus were also part of the all Italian 2003 UEFA Champions League final but lost out to Milan on penalties after the game ended in a 0–0 draw. At the conclusion of the following season, Lippi was appointed as the Italy national team&#x27;s head coach, bringing an end to one of the most fruitful managerial spells in Juventus&#x27;s history.

=== &quot;Calciopoli&quot; scandal (2004–2007) ===
Fabio Capello was appointed as Juventus&#x27;s coach in 2004 and led the club to two more consecutive Serie A first places. In May 2006, Juventus emerged as one of the five clubs linked to the &quot;Calciopoli&quot; scandal. In July, Juventus was placed at the bottom of the league table and relegated to Serie B for the first time in its history. The club was also stripped of the 2004–05 Serie A title, while the 2005–06 Serie A winner, after a period &quot;sub judice&quot;, was declared to be third-placed Inter Milan. This remains a much debated and controversial issue, particularly due to Inter Milan&#x27;s later revealed involvement, the 2004 championship (the sole being investigated) deemed regular and not fixed, Juventus being absolved as club in the ordinary justice proceedings, their renounce to the Italian civil courts appeal, which could have cleared the club&#x27;s name and avoid relegation, after FIFA threatened to suspend the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) and barring all Italian clubs from international play, and the motivations, such as &quot;sentimento popolare&quot; (people&#x27;s feelings), and the newly created &quot;ad-hoc&quot; rule used to relegate the club.
Many key players left following their relegation to Serie B, including Thuram, star striker Zlatan Ibrahimović, midfielders Emerson and Patrick Vieira, and defensive stalwarts Fabio Cannavaro and Gianluca Zambrotta; other big name players, such as Del Piero, Buffon, Trezeguet, and Nedvěd, as well as the club&#x27;s future defense core Giorgio Chiellini, remained to help the club return to Serie A, while youngsters from the Campionato Nazionale Primavera (youth team), such as Sebastian Giovinco and Claudio Marchisio, were integrated into the first team. Juventus won the &quot;Cadetti&quot; title (Serie B championship) despite starting with a points deduction and gained promotion straight back up to the top division, with Del Piero claiming the top scorer award with 21 goals, as league winners after the 2006–07 Serie B season.

As early as 2010, when many other clubs were implicated and Inter Milan, Livorno, and Milan liable of direct Article 6 violations in the 2011 Palazzi Report, Juventus considered challenging the stripping of their &quot;scudetto&quot; from 2005 and the non-assignment of the 2006 title, dependent on the results of Calciopoli trials connected to the 2006 scandal. When former general manager Luciano Moggi&#x27;s conviction in criminal court in connection with the scandal was partially written off by the Supreme Court in March 2015, the club sued the FIGC for €443 million for damages caused by their 2006 relegation. Then-FIGC president Carlo Tavecchio offered to discuss reinstatement of the lost &quot;scudetti&quot; in exchange for Juventus dropping the lawsuit.

In September 2015, the Supreme Court released a 150-page document that explained its final ruling of the case, based on the controversial 2006 sports ruling, which did not take in consideration the other clubs involved because they could not be put on trial due to the statute of limitations, and it would be necessary to request and open a revocation of judgment pursuant to Article 39 of the Code of Sports Justice. Despite his remaining charges being cancelled without a new trial due to statute of limitations, the court confirmed that Moggi was actively involved in the sporting fraud, which was intended to favour Juventus and increase his own personal benefits according to &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot;. As did the Naples court in 2012, the court commented that the developments and behavior of other clubs and executives were not investigated in depth. Once they exhausted their appeals in Italy&#x27;s courts, both Moggi and Giraudo appealed to the European Court of Human Rights in March 2020; Giraudo&#x27;s was accepted in September 2021. Juventus continued to present new appeals, which were declared inadmissible.

=== Return to Serie A (2007–2011) ===
After making their comeback for the 2007–08 Serie A, Juventus appointed Claudio Ranieri as manager. They finished in third place in their first season back in the top flight and qualified for the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League&#x27;s third qualifying round in the preliminary stages. Juventus reached the group stages, where they beat Real Madrid in both home and away legs, before losing in the knockout round to Chelsea. Ranieri was sacked following a string of unsuccessful results and Ciro Ferrara was appointed as manager on a temporary basis for the last two games of the 2008–09 Serie A, before being subsequently appointed as the manager for the 2009–10 Serie A.

Ferrara&#x27;s stint as Juventus manager proved to be unsuccessful, with Juventus knocked out of 2009–10 UEFA Champions League, and also of the 2009–10 Coppa Italia, as well as just lying on the sixth place in the league table at the end of January 2010, leading to the dismissal of Ferrara and the naming of Alberto Zaccheroni as caretaker manager. Zaccheroni could not help the side improve, as Juventus finished the season in seventh place in Serie A. For the 2010–11 Serie A, Jean-Claude Blanc was replaced by Andrea Agnelli as the club&#x27;s president. Agnelli&#x27;s first action was to replace Zaccheroni and director of sport Alessio Secco with Sampdoria manager Luigi Delneri and director of sport Giuseppe Marotta. Delneri failed to improve their fortunes and was dismissed, and former player and fan favourite Antonio Conte, fresh after winning promotion with Siena, was named as Delneri&#x27;s replacement. In September 2011, Juventus relocated to the new Juventus Stadium, known as the Allianz Stadium since 2017.

=== Nine consecutive &quot;scudetti&quot; (2011–2020) ===

With Conte as manager, Juventus were unbeaten for the entire 2011–12 Serie A season. Towards the second half of the season, the team was mostly competing with northern rivals Milan for first place in a tight contest. Juventus won the title on the 37th matchday after beating Cagliari 2–0 and Milan losing to Inter 4–2. After a 3–1 win in the final matchday against Atalanta, Juventus became the first team to go the season unbeaten in the current 38-game format. In 2013–14 Serie A, Juventus won a third consecutive &quot;scudetto&quot; with a record 102 points and 33 wins. The title was the 30th official league championship in the club&#x27;s history. They also achieved the semi-finals of 2013–14 UEFA Europa League, where they were eliminated at home against ten-man Benfica&#x27;s &quot;catenaccio&quot;, missing the 2014 UEFA Europa League final at the Juventus Stadium.
In the 2014–15 Serie A, Massimiliano Allegri was appointed as manager, with whom Juventus won their 31st official title, making it a fourth-straight, as well as achieving a record tenth Coppa Italia, after beating Lazio 2–2 in the 2015 Coppa Italia final, for the domestic double. The club also beat Real Madrid 3–2 on aggregate in the semi-finals of the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League to face Barcelona in the 2015 UEFA Champions League final in Berlin for the first time since the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League. Juventus lost the final against Barcelona 3–1. In the 2016 Coppa Italia final, the club won the title for the 11th time and second straight win, becoming the first team in Italy&#x27;s history to win Serie A and Coppa Italia doubles in back-to-back seasons. In the 2017 Coppa Italia final, Juventus won their 12th Coppa Italia title in a 2–0 win over Lazio, becoming the first team to win three consecutive titles. Four days later on 21 May, Juventus became the first team to win six consecutive Serie A titles. In the 2017 UEFA Champions League final, their second Champions League final in three years, Juventus were defeated 1–4 by defending champions Real Madrid; the 2017 Turin stampede happened ten minutes before the end of the match. In the 2018 Coppa Italia final, Juventus won their 13th title and fourth in a row in a 4–0 win over Milan, extending the all-time record of successive Coppa Italia titles. Juventus then secured their seventh consecutive Serie A title, extending the all-time record of successive triumphs in the competition. 

Juventus, eager to secure the Champions League title, signed Cristiano Ronaldo for £99.2 million from Real Madrid on 10 July 2018. In Italy, the signing was dubbed the &quot;deal of the century.&quot; For Juventus, the signing of Ronaldo went beyond football—it represented a step toward elevating the club&#x27;s status as a global business. Deloitte ranked the world&#x27;s richest clubs earlier in the year and Juventus ranked 10th; by leveraging Ronaldo&#x27;s massive social media following and commercial appeal, the club expected to close the financial gap with the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Manchester United. In the 2018 Supercoppa Italiana, which was held in January 2019, Juventus and Milan, who were tied for Supercoppa Italiana wins with seven each, played against each other; Juventus won their eight title after beating Milan 1–0. In April 2019, Juventus secured their eighth consecutive Serie A title, further extending the all-time record of successive triumphs in the competition. Following Allegri&#x27;s departure, Maurizio Sarri was appointed manager of the club ahead of the 2019–20 Juventus F.C. season. Juventus were confirmed 2019–20 Serie A champions, reaching an unprecedented milestone of nine consecutive league titles. Ronaldo was key to Juventus&#x27;s continuation of domestic success; notable achievements include his reaching 100 goals in Serie A quicker than anyone in the league&#x27;s history. He also equalled the record of scoring in the most consecutive Serie A matches (11).

=== Recent history (2020–present) ===
On 8 August 2020, Sarri was sacked from his managerial position, one day after Juventus were eliminated from the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League by Lyon. On the same day, former player Andrea Pirlo was announced as the new coach, signing a two-year contract. In the 2020 Supercoppa Italiana, which was held in January 2021, Juventus won their ninth title after a 2–0 victory against Napoli. With Inter Milan&#x27;s win of the 2020–21 Serie A, Juventus&#x27;s run of nine consecutive titles came to an end; the club managed to secure a fourth-place finish on the final day of the league, granting Juventus qualification to the following season&#x27;s Champions League. In the 2021 Coppa Italia final, Juventus won their 14th title. On 28 May, Juventus sacked Pirlo from his managerial position, and announced Allegri&#x27;s return to the club as manager after two years away from management on a four-year contract. During the three seasons that featured Ronaldo, the Champions League all-time top scorer, Juventus disappointingly failed to win the Champions League. Ronaldo left the club for Manchester United in late 2021.

Although Allegri had considered the victory of the &quot;scudetto&quot; as a seasonal goal, Juventus reached another fourth place in the league. After losing 4–2 after extra time to Inter Milan in the 2022 Coppa Italia final, the 2021–22 Juventus F.C. season marked the first season since 2010–11 in which the club had not won a trophy. In the 2022–23 season, Juventus had one victory and five defeats in their Champions League group, achieving their worst-ever score (3 points) and their greatest-ever number of losses in the competition&#x27;s group stage. Through their better goal difference over fourth-placed Maccabi Haifa, the team finished third and dropped down into the Europa League, in which they were defeated 2–1 by Sevilla after extra time at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium in the semi-final. On 28 November 2022, the entire board of directors resigned from their respective positions, Andrea Agnelli as president, Pavel Nedvěd as vice president, and Maurizio Arrivabene as CEO. Agnelli&#x27;s presidency was the most victorious of the club&#x27;s history, with 19 titles won. Exor, the club&#x27;s controlling shareholder, appointed Gianluca Ferrero as its new chairman ahead of the shareholders&#x27; meeting on 18 January 2023.

Two days later, after being acquitted by the FIGC&#x27;s Court of Appeal in April–May 2022, Juventus were deducted 15 points as punishment for capital gain violations, as part of an investigation related to the 2019–2021 budgets during the COVID-19 pandemic starting in November 2021. This was harsher than the point deduction recommended by the FIGC prosecutor, who said that in the standings Juventus &quot;must now finish behind Roma, outside the European Cup area&quot;. The penalty caused an uproar and protests among Juventus supporters, who cancelled, or threatened to do so, their Sky Sport and DAZN subscriptions. Following Juventus&#x27;s appeal, the decision had initially been reversed on 20 April 2023, but the club were given a new penalty, this time of ten points, on 22 May. Within the aforementioned FIGC&#x27;s inquiry, on 29 May, Juventus proposed a plea bargain for their false accounting on staff salaries; the request was accepted one day later and Juventus only received a fine of €718,240 without any further penalty. Juventus finished the 2022–23 Serie A in seventh place and qualified to the UEFA Europa Conference League with 62 points. However, on 28 July, UEFA ejected Juventus from its competitions for one year as the club violated a settlement agreement with UEFA signed in August 2022. The 2023–24 season was the first in which Juventus did not participate in UEFA competitions since 2011–12. 

Due to their UEFA competition ban, Juventus only had the Serie A title and Coppa Italia to play for during the 2023–24 season. In Serie A Juventus finished the season in third place with 71 points, qualifying for the champions league but they finished the season 23 points behind a dominant Inter Milan side. In the Coppa Italia, Juventus made the final where they would face Atalanta. Juventus would win the final 1–0 after an early goal from Dušan Vlahović, earning the Turin club their 15th Coppa Italia title. However the game was not without controversy, as manager Massimiliano Allegri was sent off in stoppage time after shouting at the 4th official. Allegri after leaving the pitch was reported to have attacked the referees, threatened a journalist and waved off sporting director Cristiano Giuntoli during the post match celebrations. 

Despite winning the Coppa Italia, two days after the final Juventus announced they had sacked Allegri, mainly due to his behaviour during the game not being in line with the club&#x27;s values, Juventus announced that former defender Paolo Montero would take charge for the final two league games of the season. 

On 12 June 2024, Juventus announced that former Bologana coach and Inter Milan midfielder Thiago Motta would become their new head coach for the 2024–25 season, on a three-year contract.

== Crest and colours ==

Juventus have played in black and white striped shirts, with white shorts, sometimes black shorts since 1901–02 season. Originally, they played in pink shirts with a black tie. The father of one of the players made the earliest shirts, but continual washing faded the colour so much that in December 1901 the club sought to replace them. Juventus asked one of their team members, Englishman John Savage, if he had any contacts in England who could supply new shirts in a colour that would better withstand the elements. He had a friend who lived in Nottingham, who being a Notts County supporter, shipped out the black and white striped shirts to Turin. Juventus have worn the shirts ever since, considering the colours to be aggressive and powerful.

Juventus&#x27;s official emblem has undergone different and small modifications since the 1920s. The previous modification of the Juventus badge took place in 2004, when the emblem of the team changed to a black-and-white oval shield of a type used by Italian ecclesiastics. It is divided in five vertical stripes: two white stripes and three black stripes, inside which are the following elements, while in its upper section the name of the society superimposed on a white convex section, over golden curvature (gold for honour). The white silhouette of a charging bull is in the lower section of the oval shield, superimposed on a black old French shield and the charging bull is a symbol of the &quot;comune&quot; of Turin. There is also a black silhouette of a mural crown above the black spherical triangle&#x27;s base. This is a reminiscence to Augusta Tourinorum, the old city of the Roman era which the present capital of Piedmont region is its cultural heiress.
In January 2017, president Andrea Agnelli announced the change to the Juventus badge for a logotype. More specifically, it is a pictogram composed by a stylised Black and White &quot;J&quot; which Agnelli said reflects &quot;the Juventus way of living.&quot; Juventus was the first team in sports history to adopt a star as a symbol associated with any competition&#x27;s triumph, who added one above their badge in 1958 to represent their tenth Italian Football Championship and Serie A title, and has since become popularized with other clubs as well.

In the past, the convex section of the emblem had a blue colour (another symbol of Turin) and it was concave in shape. The old French shield and the mural crown, also in the lower section of the emblem, had a considerably greater size. The two &quot;Golden Stars for Sport Excellence&quot; were located above the convex and concave section of Juventus&#x27;s emblem. During the 1980s, the club emblem was the blurred silhouette of a zebra, alongside the two golden stars with the club&#x27;s name forming an arc above.

Juventus unofficially won their 30th league title in 2011–12, but a dispute with the FIGC, which stripped Juventus of their 2004–05 title and did not assign them the 2005–06 title due to their involvement in the &quot;Calciopoli&quot; scandal, left their official total at 28; the club elected to wear no stars at all the following season, but added the message &quot;30 sul campo&quot; (&quot;30 on the pitch&quot;, referring to the two titles that were won but vacated) underneath the badge. Juventus won their 30th title in 2013–14 and thus earned the right to wear their third star, but Agnelli stated that the club suspended the use of the stars until another team wins their 20th championship, having the right to wear two stars &quot;to emphasise the difference&quot;. For the 2015–16 season, Juventus reintroduced the stars and added the third star to their jersey as well with new kit manufacturers Adidas, in addition to the Coppa Italia badge for winning their tenth Coppa Italia the previous season. For the 2016–17 season, Juventus re-designed their kit with a different take on the trademark black and white stripes. For the 2017–18 season, Juventus introduced the &quot;J&quot; shaped logo onto the kits.

In September 2015, Juventus officially announced a new project called JKids for its junior supporters on its website. Along with this project, Juventus also introduced a new mascot to all its fans which is called J. J is a cartoon-designed zebra, black and white stripes with golden edge piping on its body, golden shining eyes, and three golden stars on the front of its neck. J made its debut at Juventus Stadium on 12 September 2015.

During its history, the club has acquired a number of nicknames, &quot;la Vecchia Signora&quot; (the Old Lady) being the best example. The &quot;old&quot; part of the nickname is a pun on Juventus which means &quot;youth&quot; in Latin. It was derived from the age of the Juventus star players towards the middle of the 1930s. The &quot;lady&quot; part of the nickname is how fans of the club affectionately referred to it before the 1930s. The club is also nicknamed &quot;la Fidanzata d&#x27;Italia&quot; (), because over the years it has received a high level of support from Southern Italian immigrant workers (particularly from Naples and Palermo), who arrived in Turin to work for FIAT since the 1930s. Other nicknames include &quot;[la] Madama&quot; (Piedmontese for Madam), &quot;i bianconeri&quot; (), &quot;le zebre&quot; () in reference to Juventus&#x27;s colours. &quot;I gobbi&quot; () is the nickname that is used to define Juventus supporters, but is also used sometimes for team&#x27;s players. The most widely accepted origin of &quot;gobbi&quot; dates to the fifties, when the &quot;bianconeri&quot; wore a large jersey. When players ran on the field, the jersey, which had a laced opening at the chest, generated a bulge over the back (a sort of parachute effect), making the players look hunchbacked.

The official anthem of Juventus is &quot;Juve (storia di un grande amore)&quot;, or &quot;Juve (story of a great love)&quot; in English, written by Alessandra Torre and Claudio Guidetti, in the version of the singer and musician Paolo Belli composed in 2007. In 2016, a documentary film called &quot;Black and White Stripes: The Juventus Story&quot; was produced by the La Villa brothers about Juventus. On 16 February 2018, the first three episodes of a docu-series called &quot;First Team: Juventus&quot;, which followed the club throughout the season, by spending time with the players behind the scenes both on and off the field, was released on Netflix; the other three episodes were released on 6 July 2018. On 25 November 2021, an eight-episode docu-series called &quot;All or Nothing: Juventus&quot;, which followed the club throughout the season, by spending time with the players behind the scenes both on and off the field, was released on Amazon Prime.

== Stadiums ==
After the first two years (1897 and 1898), during which Juventus played in the Parco del Valentino and Parco Cittadella, their matches were held in the Piazza d&#x27;Armi Stadium until 1908, except in 1905 (the first year of the &quot;scudetto&quot;) and in 1906, years in which they played at the Corso Re Umberto.

From 1909 to 1922, Juventus played their internal competitions at Corso Sebastopoli Camp before moving the following year to Corso Marsiglia Camp, where they remained until 1933, winning four league titles. At the end of 1933, they began to play at the new Stadio Benito Mussolini inaugurated for the 1934 World Championships. After the Second World War, the stadium was renamed as Stadio Comunale Vittorio Pozzo. Juventus played home matches at the ground for 57 years, a total of 890 league matches. The team continued to host training sessions at the stadium until July 2003.

From 1990 until the 2005–06 season, the Torinese side contested their home matches at Stadio delle Alpi, built for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, although in very rare circumstances the club played some home games in other stadia such as Renzo Barbera at Palermo, Dino Manuzzi in Cesena and the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza in Milan.

In August 2006, Juventus returned to play in the Stadio Comunale, then known as Stadio Olimpico, after the restructuring of the stadium for the 2006 Winter Olympics onward. In November 2008, Juventus announced that they would invest around €120 million to build a new ground, the Juventus Stadium, on the site of delle Alpi. Unlike the old ground, there is not a running track and instead the pitch is only 7.5 metres away from the stands. The capacity is 41,507. Work began during spring 2009 and the stadium was opened on 8 September 2011, ahead of the start of the 2011–12 season. Since 1 July 2017, the Juventus Stadium is known commercially as the Allianz Stadium of Turin until 30 June 2030.

== Supporters ==

Juventus is the most-supported football club in Italy, with over 12 million fans or &quot;tifosi&quot;, which represent approximately 34% of the total Italian football fans according to a research published in September 2016 by Italian research agency Demos &amp; Pi, as well as one of the most supported football clubs in the world, with over 300 million supporters (41 million in Europe alone), particularly in the Mediterranean countries to which a large number of Italian diaspora have emigrated. The Torinese side has fan clubs branches across the globe.

Demand for Juventus tickets in occasional home games held away from Turin is high, suggesting that Juventus have stronger support in other parts of the country. Juventus is widely and especially popular throughout mainland Southern Italy, Sicily and Malta, leading the team to have one of the largest followings in its away matches, more than in Turin itself.

== Club rivalries ==
Juventus have significant rivalries with two main clubs.

Their traditional rivals are fellow Turin club Torino; matches between the two sides are known as the &quot;Derby della Mole&quot; (Turin Derby). The rivalry dates back to 1906 as Torino was founded by break-away Juventus players and staff.

Their most high-profile rivalry is with Inter Milan, another big Serie A club located in Milan, the capital of the neighbouring region of Lombardy. Matches between these two clubs are referred to as the &quot;Derby d&#x27;Italia&quot; (Derby of Italy) and the two regularly challenge each other at the top of the league table, hence the intense rivalry. Until the Calciopoli scandal which saw Juventus forcibly relegated, the two were the only Italian clubs to have never played below Serie A. Notably, the two sides are the first and the second most supported clubs in Italy and the rivalry has intensified since the later part of the 1990s; reaching its highest levels ever post-&quot;Calciopoli&quot;, with the return of Juventus to Serie A.

The rivalry with AC Milan is a rivalry between the two most titled and two of the most supported teams in Italy. The match-ups between Milan and Juventus, is regarded as the championship of Serie A, and both teams were often fighting for the top positions of the standings, sometimes even decisive for the award of the title.

They also have rivalries with Roma, Fiorentina and Napoli.

== Youth programme ==

The Juventus youth set-up has been recognised as one of the best in Italy for producing young talents. While not all graduates made it to the first team, many have enjoyed successful careers in the Italian top flight. Under long-time coach Vincenzo Chiarenza, the &quot;Primavera&quot; (under-19) squad enjoyed one of its successful periods, winning all age-group competitions from 2004 to 2006. Like Dutch club Ajax and many Premier League clubs, Juventus operates several satellite clubs and football schools outside of the country (i.e. United States, Canada, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Switzerland) and numerous camps in the local region to expand talent scouting. On 3 August 2018, Juventus founded their professional reserve team, called Juventus U23 (renamed to Juventus Next Gen in August 2022), playing in Serie C, who won the Coppa Italia Serie C in 2020. In the 2021–22 UEFA Youth League, the U19 squad reached the semi-finals, equalling the best-ever placing in the competition for a Serie A team.

The youth system is also notable for its contribution to the Italian national senior and youth teams. 1934 World Cup winner Gianpiero Combi, 1936 Gold Medal and 1938 World Cup winner Pietro Rava, Giampiero Boniperti, Roberto Bettega, 1982 World Cup hero Paolo Rossi and more recently Claudio Marchisio and Sebastian Giovinco are a number of former graduates who have gone on to make the first team and full Italy squad.

=== Chairmen history ===

Juventus have had overall 24 presidents ( or ) and two administrative committees, some of which have been members of the club&#x27;s main stakeholder group and elected since the club&#x27;s foundation by the then &quot;assemblea di soci&quot; (membership assembly) through an annual meeting. Since 1949, they have been often corporate managers that were nominated in charge by the &quot;assemblea degli azionisti&quot; (stakeholders assembly). On top of chairmen, there were several living former presidents, that were nominated as the honorary chairmen ().
=== Managerial history ===
Below is a list of Juventus managers from 1923, when the Agnelli family took over and the club became more structured and organised, until the present day.
== Honours ==
Italy&#x27;s most successful club of the 20th century and the most winning in the history of Italian football, Juventus have won the Italian League Championship, the country&#x27;s premier football club competitions and organised by Lega Nazionale Professionisti Serie A (LNPA), a record 36 times and have the records of consecutive triumphs in that tournament (nine, between 2011–12 and 2019–20). They have also won the Coppa Italia, the country&#x27;s primary single-elimination competitions, a record 15 times, becoming the first team to retain the trophy successfully with their triumph in the 1959–60 season, and the first to win it in three consecutive seasons from the 2014–15 season to the 2016–17 season, going on to win a fourth consecutive title in 2017–18 (also a record). In addition, the club holds the record for Supercoppa Italiana wins with nine, the most recent coming in 2020.

<text>Jan Długosz (; 1 December 1415 – 19 May 1480), also known in Latin as Johannes Longinus, was a Polish priest, chronicler, diplomat, soldier, and secretary to Bishop Zbigniew Oleśnicki of Kraków. He is considered Poland&#x27;s first historian.

==Life==

Jan Długosz is best known for his (&quot;Annales seu cronici incliti regni Poloniae&quot;) in 12 volumes and originally written in Latin, covering events throughout southeastern and western Europe, from 965 to 1480, the year he died. Długosz combined features of Medieval chronicles with elements of humanistic historiography. For writing the history of the Kingdom of Poland, Długosz also used Ruthenian chronicles including those that did not survive to our times (among which there could have been used the Kyiv collection of chronicles of the 11th century in the Przemysl&#x27;s edition around 1100 and the Przemysl episcopal collections of 1225–40).

His work was first printed in 1701–1703. It was originally printed at the Jan Szeliga printing house in Dobromyl financed by Jan Szczęsny Herburt. Whenever Jan Długosz bothers to mention himself in the book, he writes of himself in the third person. He belonged to the Wieniawa coat-of-arms.

Długosz was a canon at Kraków, where he lived in the Długosz House, and was educated at the University of Krakow. He was sent by King Casimir IV Jagiellon of Poland on diplomatic missions to the Papal and Imperial courts, and was involved in the King&#x27;s negotiations with the Teutonic Knights during the Thirteen Years&#x27; War (1454–66) and at the peace negotiations.

In 1434, Długosz&#x27;s uncle, the first pastor at Kłobuck, appointed him to take over his position as canon of St. Martin church there. The town was in the Opole territory of Silesia, but had recently been conquered by Władysław II Jagiełło. Długosz stayed until 1452 and while there, founded the canonical monastery.

In 1450, Długosz was sent by Queen Sophia of Halshany and King Casimir to conduct peace negotiations between John Hunyadi and the Bohemian noble Jan Jiskra of Brandýs, and after six days&#x27; of talks convinced them to sign a truce.

In 1455 in Kraków, a fire spread which destroyed much of the city and the castle, but which spared Długosz&#x27;s House.

In 1461 a Polish delegation which included Długosz met with emissaries of George of Podebrady in Bytom, Silesia. After six days of talks, they concluded an alliance between the two factions. In 1466 Długosz was sent to the legate of Wrocław, in order to attempt to obtain assurance that the legate was not biased in favor of the Teutonic Knights. He was successful, and was in 1467 entrusted with tutoring the king&#x27;s son.

Długosz declined the offer of the Archbishopric of Prague, but shortly before his death was nominated Archbishop of Lwów. This nomination was only confirmed by Pope Sixtus IV on 2 June 1480, two weeks after his death.

His work &quot;Banderia Prutenorum&quot; of 1448 is his description of the 1410 Battle of Grunwald, which took place between villages of Grunwald and Stębark.

At some point in his life Długosz loosely translated Wigand of Marburg&#x27;s &quot;Chronica nova Prutenica&quot; from Middle High German into Latin, however with many mistakes and mixup of names and places.

<text>Jadwiga (; 1373 or 137417 July 1399), also known as Hedwig (from German) and in , was the first woman to be crowned as monarch of the Kingdom of Poland. She reigned from 16 October 1384 until her death. Born in Buda, she was the youngest daughter of Louis I of Hungary and Poland, and his wife, Elizabeth of Bosnia. 

Jadwiga was a member of the Capetian House of Anjou, but she had more close forebears among the Polish Piasts than among the mostly French Angevins.

In 1375, it was planned that when becoming old enough, Jadwiga would marry William of Austria and she lived in Vienna from 1378 to 1380. Louis I is often thought to have regarded her and William as his favoured successors in Hungary after the 1378 death of her eldest sister, Catherine, since the following year the Polish nobility had pledged their homage to Louis&#x27; second daughter, Mary, and Mary&#x27;s fiancé, Sigismund of Luxembourg. However, Louis died, and in 1382, at her mother&#x27;s insistence, Mary was crowned &quot;King of Hungary&quot;. Sigismund of Luxembourg tried to take control of Poland, but the Polish nobility countered that they would be obedient to a daughter of Louis only if she settled in Poland. Queen Elizabeth then chose Jadwiga to reign in Poland but did not send her to Kraków to be crowned. During the interregnum, Siemowit IV, Duke of Masovia, became a candidate for the Polish throne. The nobility of Greater Poland favoured him and proposed that he marry Jadwiga. However, Lesser Poland&#x27;s nobility opposed him, and they persuaded Elizabeth to send Jadwiga to Poland.

Jadwiga was crowned &quot;king&quot; in Poland&#x27;s capital, Kraków, on 16 October 1384. Her coronation either reflected the Polish nobility&#x27;s opposition to her intended husband, William, becoming king without further negotiation or simply emphasized her status as queen regnant. With her mother&#x27;s consent, Jadwiga&#x27;s advisors opened negotiations with Jogaila, Grand Duke of Lithuania, who was still a pagan, concerning his potential marriage to Jadwiga. Jogaila signed the Union of Krewo, pledging to convert to Catholicism and to promote the conversion of his pagan subjects. Meanwhile, William hastened to Kraków, hoping to marry Jadwiga, but in late August 1385, the Polish nobles expelled him.

Jogaila, who took the Catholic baptismal name Władysław, married Jadwiga on 15 February 1386. Legend says that she had agreed to marry him only after a lengthy prayer, seeking divine inspiration. Jogaila, now styled in Polish as Władysław Jagiełło was crowned King of Poland on 4 March 1386 as Jadwiga&#x27;s co-ruler. Jogaila worked closely with his wife in that role. In any case, her real political power was limited. She remained passive when the rebellious nobles of the Kingdom of Hungary-Croatia murdered her mother in early 1387. After that, Jadwiga marched into the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia, which had been under Hungarian rule, and persuaded most of the inhabitants to become subjects of the Polish Crown. She mediated between her husband&#x27;s quarrelling kin and between Poland and the Teutonic Order. After her sister Mary died in 1395, Jadwiga and Jogaila laid claim to Hungary against the widowed Sigismund of Luxembourg, but the Hungarian lords did not support their claim and Sigismund easily retained his Hungarian throne. Jadwiga died four years later due to postpartum complications. In 1997, she was canonized by the Catholic Church.

== Childhood (1373 or 1374 – 1382) ==
Jadwiga was born in Buda, the capital of the Kingdom of Hungary. She was the third and youngest daughter of Louis I, King of Hungary and Poland, and his second wife, Elizabeth of Bosnia. Both her grandmothers were Polish princesses, connecting her to the native Piast dynasty of Poland. Polish historian Oscar Halecki concluded in his posthumously published work (1991) that Jadwiga&#x27;s &quot;genealogical tree clearly shows that [she] had more Polish blood than any other&quot;. She was probably born between 3 October 1373 and 18 February 1374. She was named after her distant ancestor, Saint Hedwig of Silesia, who was especially venerated in the Hungarian royal court at the time of her birth.

King Louis, who had not fathered any sons, wanted to ensure the right of his daughters to inherit his realms. Therefore, European royals regarded his three daughters as especially attractive brides. Leopold III, Duke of Austria, proposed his eldest son, William, to Jadwiga already on 18 August 1374. The envoys of the Polish nobles acknowledged that one of Louis&#x27;s daughters would succeed him in Poland after he confirmed and extended their liberties in the Privilege of Koszyce on 17 September 1374. They took an oath of loyalty to Catherine on Louis&#x27;s demand.

Louis agreed to give Jadwiga in marriage to William of Austria on 4 March 1375. The children&#x27;s &quot;sponsalia de futuro&quot;, or &quot;provisional marriage&quot;, was celebrated at Hainburg on 15 June 1378. The ceremony established the legal framework for the consummation of the marriage without any further ecclesiastical act as soon as they both reached the age of maturity. Duke Leopold agreed that Jadwiga would only receive Treviso, a town that was to be conquered from the Republic of Venice, as dowry from her father. After the ceremony, Jadwiga stayed in Austria for almost two years; she mainly lived in Vienna.

Catherine died in late 1378. Louis persuaded the most influential Polish lords to swear an oath of loyalty to her younger sister, Mary, in September 1379. She was betrothed to Sigismund of Luxemburg, a great-grandson of Casimir the Great, who had been Louis&#x27;s predecessor on the Polish throne. The &quot;promised marriage&quot; of Jadwiga and William was confirmed at their fathers&#x27; meeting in Zólyom (now Zvolen in Slovakia) on 12 February 1380. Hungarian lords also approved the document, implying that Jadwiga and William were regarded as her father&#x27;s successors in Hungary.

A delegation of the Polish lords and clergy paid formal homage to Sigismund of Luxemburg as their future king on 25 July 1382. The Poles believed that Louis planned also to persuade the Hungarian lords and prelates to accept Jadwiga and William of Austria as his heirs in Hungary. However, he died on 10 September 1382. Jadwiga was present at her father&#x27;s death bed.

== Accession negotiations (1382–84) ==
Jadwiga&#x27;s sister, Mary, was crowned king of Hungary five days after their father&#x27;s death. With the ceremony, their ambitious mother secured the right to govern Hungary on her twelve-year-old daughter&#x27;s behalf instead of Mary&#x27;s fiancé, Sigismund. Sigismund could not be present at Mary&#x27;s coronation, because Louis had sent him to Poland to crush a rebellion. After he learnt of Louis&#x27;s death, he adopted the title &quot;Lord of the Kingdom of Poland&quot;, demanding oaths of loyalty from the towns in Lesser Poland. On 25 November, the nobles of Greater Poland assembled at Radomsko and decided to obey nobody but the daughter of the late king as she would settle in Poland. On their initiative, the noblemen of Lesser Poland passed a similar agreement in Wiślica on 12 December. Queen Elizabeth sent her envoys to the assembled lords and forbade them to swear an oath of loyalty to anyone other than one of her daughters, thus invalidating the oath of loyalty that the Polish noblemen had sworn to Sigismund on the late King Louis&#x27;s demand.

Both Elizabeth&#x27;s daughters had been engaged to foreign princes (Sigismund and William, respectively) unpopular in Poland. Polish lords who were opposed to a foreign monarch regarded the members of the Piast dynasty as possible candidates to the Polish throne. Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s uncle Władysław the White had already attempted to seize Poland during Louis&#x27;s reign. However, he had taken monastic vows and settled in a Benedictine abbey in Dijon in Burgundy. Antipope Clement VII, whom King Louis had refused to recognize against Pope Urban VI, released Władysław from his vows, but he did not leave his monastery. Meanwhile, Siemowit IV, Duke of Masovia, appeared as a more ambitious candidate. He was especially popular among the nobility and townspeople of Greater Poland.

Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s representatives released the Poles from their oath of fidelity that their representatives had sworn to Mary at an assembly in Sieradz in February 1383. The envoys also announced that she was willing to send Jadwiga to be crowned instead, on condition that she return to Buda after her coronation to live there until her twelfth birthday. The Polish lords accepted the proposal, but they soon realized that thereby the interregnum would be extended by a further three years. At a new meeting in Sieradz, most noblemen were ready to elect Siemowit of Masovia king on 28 March. They proposed that Siemowit should marry Jadwiga. A member of the influential Tęczyński family, Jan, convinced them to postpone Siemowit&#x27;s election. The noblemen agreed to wait for Jadwiga until 10 May, stipulating that she was to live in Poland after her coronation. They also demanded that Dobrzyń and Gniewków (two fiefdoms which her father had granted to Vladislaus II of Opole), and &quot;Ruthenia&quot; (that had passed to Hungary in accordance with a previous treaty) be restored to the Polish Crown.

Meanwhile, Jan Tęczyński and his allies, including , seem to have started negotiations with Jogaila, Grand Duke of Lithuania. Siemowit&#x27;s supporters however, tried to enter Kraków in the retinue of Bodzanta, Archbishop of Gniezno, in May, but the townspeople closed the gates of the city before their arrival. Jadwiga had not arrived in Poland by the stipulated date (10 May). Her mother&#x27;s envoys stated that the spring floods had hindered Jadwiga&#x27;s progress over the Carpathian Mountains.

Siemowit of Mazovia took up arms and advanced as far as Kalisz. His supporters assembled in Sieradz in August in order to elect him king, but Archbishop Bodzanta refused to perform his coronation. In a meeting in Kassa, Queen Elizabeth promised the delegates of the Polish provinces to send Jadwiga to Poland before November. The queen mother and the Poles also agreed that if either Jadwiga or Mary died childless, her kingdom would pass to her surviving sister. Siemowit having laid siege to Kalisz, Queen Elizabeth sent Sigismund of Luxemburg at the head of an &quot;improvised army&quot; to Lesser Poland. Siemowit failed to take Kalisz, but news about the appalling behaviour of Sigismund&#x27;s soldiers increased Sigismund&#x27;s unpopularity in Poland. Sędziwój Pałuka, who was the castellan of Kalisz and &quot;starosta&quot; of Kraków, led a delegation to Zadar in Dalmatia to negotiate with Queen Elizabeth, but she had him imprisoned instead. She sent Hungarian soldiers to Poland to garrison them in Wawel Castle in Kraków, but Pałuka escaped and successfully obstructed her soldiers from entering the castle.

At a general assembly in Radomsko in early March, the delegates of all the Polish provinces and towns decided to elect Siemowit king, if Jadwiga did not come to Poland within two months. They set up a provisional government, stipulating that only the &quot;community of lords and citizens&quot; had the authority to administer Poland during the interregnum. Queen Elizabeth, who was only informed of the decision by an informal message, realized that she could not any longer postpone Jadwiga&#x27;s coronation and so sent her to Poland. The exact date of Jadwiga&#x27;s arrival is unknown because the main source for the history of Poland during this periodJan of Czarnków&#x27;s chronicle ended prior to this event.

== Reign ==

=== Coronation (1384) ===
The interregnum that followed Louis&#x27;s death and caused such internal strife came to an end with Jadwiga&#x27;s arrival in Poland. A large crowd of clerics, noblemen and burghers gathered at Kraków &quot;to greet her with a display of affection&quot;, according to the 15th-century Polish historian, Jan Długosz. Nobody protested when Archbishop Bodzanta crowned her on 16 October 1384. According to traditional scholarly consensus, Jadwiga was crowned king. Thereby, as Robert W. Knoll proposes, the Polish lords prevented her eventual spouse from adopting the same title without their consent. Stephen C. Rowell, who says that sources that contradict the traditional view outnumber those verifying it, suggests that sporadic contemporaneous references to Jadwiga as king only reflect that she was not a queen consort, but a queen regnant.

Bodzanta, Archbishop of Gniezno, Jan Radlica, Bishop of Kraków, Dobrogost of Nowy Dwór, Bishop of Poznań, and Duke Vladislaus II of Opole were Jadwiga&#x27;s most trusted advisers during the first years of her reign. According to a widely accepted scholarly theory, Jadwiga, who was still a minor, was &quot;a mere tool&quot; to her advisers. However, Halecki refutes this view, contending that Jadwiga matured quickly and her personality, especially her charm and kindness, only served to strengthen her position. Already in late 1384 she intervened on Duke Vladislaus&#x27;s behalf to reconcile him with her mother&#x27;s favourite, Nicholas I Garai.

=== Refusal of William (1385) ===
The Polish lords did not want to accept Jadwiga&#x27;s fourteen-year-old fiancé, William of Habsburg, as their sovereign. They thought that the inexperienced William and his Austrian kinsmen could not safeguard Poland&#x27;s interests against its powerful neighbours, especially the Luxemburgs which controlled Bohemia and Brandenburg, and had a strong claim on Hungary. According to Halecki, the lords of Lesser Poland were the first to suggest that Jadwiga should marry the pagan duke Jogaila of Lithuania.

Jogaila sent his envoysincluding his brother, Skirgaila, and a German burgher from Riga, Hanul to Kraków to request Jadwiga&#x27;s hand in January 1385. Jadwiga refused to answer, stating only that her mother would decide. Jogaila&#x27;s two envoys left for Hungary and met Queen Elizabeth. She informed them that &quot;she would allow whatever was advantageous to Poland and insisted that her daughter and the prelates and nobles of the Kingdom had to do what they considered would benefit Christianity and their kingdom&quot;, according to Jan Długosz&#x27;s chronicle. The nobles from Kraków, Sandomierz and Greater Poland assembled in Kraków in June or July and the &quot;majority of the more sensible&quot; voted for the acceptance of Jogaila&#x27;s marriage proposal.
In the meantime, William&#x27;s father, Leopold III hurried to Buda in late July 1385, demanding the consummation of the marriage between William and Jadwiga before 16 August. Queen Elizabeth confirmed the previous agreements about the marriage, ordering Vladislaus II of Opole to make preparations for the ceremony. According to canon law, Jadwiga&#x27;s marriage sacrament could only be completed before her twelfth birthday if the competent prelate testified her precocious maturity. Demetrius, Archbishop of Esztergom, issued the necessary document. William went to Kraków in the first half of August, but his entry to Wawel Castle was barred. Długosz states that Jadwiga and William would only be able to meet in the nearby Franciscan convent.

Contemporary or nearly contemporaneous records of the completion of the marriage between William and Jadwiga are contradictory and unclear. The official accounts of the municipal authorities of Kraków record that on 23 August 1385, an amnesty was granted to the prisoners in the city jail on the occasion of the celebration of the Queen&#x27;s marriage. On the other hand, a contemporary Austrian chronicle, the &quot;Continuatio Claustroneubuzgis&quot; states that the Poles had tried to murder William before he consummated the marriage. In the next century, Długosz states that William was &quot;removed in a shameful and offensive manner and driven from the castle&quot; after he entered &quot;the Queen&#x27;s bedchamber&quot;; but the same chronicler also mentions that Jadwiga was well aware that &quot;many people knew she had for a fortnight shared her bed with Duke William and that there had been physical consummation&quot;.

During the night that William entered the queen&#x27;s bedchamber, a group of Polish noblemen broke into the castle, forcing William to flee, according to Długosz. After this humiliation, Długosz continued, Jadwiga decided to leave Wawel and join William, but the gate of the castle was locked. She called for &quot;an axe and [tried] to break it open&quot;, but Dymitr of Goraj convinced her to return to the castle. Oscar Halecki says that Długosz&#x27;s narrative &quot;cannot be dismissed as a romantic legend&quot;; Robert I. Frost writes that it is a &quot;tale, almost certainly apocryphal&quot;. There is no doubt, however, that William of Austria was forced to leave Poland.

=== Marriage to Jogaila (1385–92) ===
Jogaila signed the Union of Krewo in August 1385, promising Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s representatives and the Polish lords&#x27; envoys that he would convert to Catholicism, together with his pagan kinsmen and subjects, if Jadwiga married him. He also pledged to pay 200,000 florins to William of Habsburg in compensation. William never accepted it. Two days after the Union of Krewo, the Teutonic Knights invaded Lithuania.

The &quot;Aeltere Hochmeisterchronik&quot; and other chronicles written in the Knights&#x27; territory accused the Polish prelates and lords of forcing Jadwiga to accept Jogaila&#x27;s offer. According to a Polish legend, Jadwiga agreed to marry Jogaila due to divine inspiration during her long prayers before a crucifix in Wawel Cathedral. Siemowit IV of Mazovia resigned his claim to Poland in December.

The Polish lords&#x27; envoys informed Jogaila that they would obey him if he married Jadwiga on 11 January 1386. Jogaila went to Lublin where a general assembly unanimously declared him &quot;king and lord of Poland&quot; in early February. Jogaila went on to Kraków where he was baptized, receiving the Christian name, Władysław, in Wawel Cathedral on 15 February. Three days later, Władysław-Jogaila, who was between 23- and 35-year old, married 12-year-old Jadwiga. Władysław-Jogaila styled himself as &quot;dominus et tutor regni Poloniae&quot; (&quot;lord and guardian of the Kingdom of Poland&quot;) in his first charter issued after the marriage.

Archbishop Bodzanta crowned Władysław-Jogaila king on 4 March 1386. Poland was transformed into a diarchya kingdom ruled over by two sovereigns. Jadwiga and her husband did not speak a common language, but they cooperated closely in their marriage. She accompanied him to Greater Poland to appease the local lords who were still hostile to him. The royal visit caused damage to the peasants who lived in the local prelates&#x27; domains, but Jadwiga persuaded her husband to compensate them, saying: &quot;We have, indeed, returned the peasants&#x27; cattle, but who can repair their tears?&quot;, according to Długosz&#x27;s chronicle. A court record of her order to the judges in favour of a peasant also shows that she protected the poor.

Pope Urban VI sent his legate, Maffiolus de Lampugnano, to Kraków to enquire about the marriage of the royal couple. Lampugnano did not voice any objections, but the Teutonic Knights started a propaganda campaign in favour of William of Habsburg. Queen Elizabeth pledged to assist Władysław-Jogaila against his enemies on 9 June 1386, but Hungary had sunken into anarchy. A group of Slavonian lords captured and imprisoned Jadwiga&#x27;s mother and sister on 25 July. The rebels murdered Queen Elizabeth in January 1387. A month later, Jadwiga marched at the head of Polish troops to Ruthenia where all but one of the governors submitted to her without opposition.
Duke Vladislaus of Opole also had a claim on Ruthenia but could not convince King Wenceslaus of Germany to intervene on his behalf. Jadwiga confirmed the privileges of the local inhabitants and promised that Ruthenia would never again be separated from the Polish Crown. After the reinforcements that Władysław-Jogaila sent from Lithuania arrived in August, Halych, the only fortress to resist, also surrendered. Władysław-Jogaila also came to Ruthenia in September. Voivode Petru II of Moldavia visited the royal couple and paid homage to them in Lviv on 26 September. Władysław-Jogaila confirmed the privileges that Jadwiga had granted the Ruthenians in October. She also instructed her subjects to show the same respect for her husband as for herself: in a letter addressed to the burghers of Kraków in late 1387, she stated that her husband was their &quot;natural lord&quot;.

On William&#x27;s demand, Pope Urban VI initiated a new investigation into the marriage of Jadwiga and Władysław-Jogaila. They sent Bishop Dobrogost of Poznań to Rome to inform the pope of the Christianization of Lithuania. In his letter to Bishop Dobrogost, Pope Urban jointly mentioned the royal couple in March 1388, which implied that he had already acknowledged the legality of their marriage. However, Gniewosz of Dalewice, who had been William of Habsburg&#x27;s supporter, spread rumours about secret meetings between William and Jadwiga in the royal castle. Jadwiga took a solemn oath before Jan Tęczyński, stating that she had only had marital relations with Władysław-Jogaila. After all witnesses confirmed her oath, Gniewosz of Dalewice confessed that he had lied. She did not take vengeance on him.

=== Strife with Sigismund (1392–95) ===

Jadwiga&#x27;s brother-in-law, Sigismund, who had been crowned King of Hungary, started negotiations with the Teutonic Knights about partitioning Poland in early 1392. Jadwiga met Mary in Stará Ľubovňa in May and returned to Kraków only in early July. She most probably accompanied her husband to Lithuania, according to Oscar Halecki, because she was far from Kraków till the end of August. On 4 August, Władysław-Jogaila&#x27;s cousin, Vytautas, who had earlier fled from Lithuania to the Teutonic Knights, paid homage to Władysław-Jogaila near Lida in Lithuania on 4 August.

Negotiations between Sigismund and the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, Konrad von Wallenrode, continued with the mediation of Vladislaus of Opole. However, Hungary&#x27;s southern border was exposed to Ottoman incursions, preventing Sigismund from taking military measures against Poland. Wallenrode died on 25 July 1393. His successor, Konrad von Jungingen, opened negotiations with the Poles. During the discussions, Pope Boniface IX&#x27;s legate, John of Messina, supported the Poles.

Jadwiga was a skilful mediator, famed for her impartiality and intelligence. She went to Lithuania to reconcile her brother-in-law, Skirgaila, with Vytautas in October 1393. Relations between Poland and Hungary remained tense. Sigismund invaded Moldavia, forcing Stephen I of Moldavia to accept his suzerainty in 1394. Soon after the Hungarian troops left Moldavia, Stephen sent his envoys to Jadwiga and Jogaila, promising to assist Poland against Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and the Teutonic Knights.

On 17 May 1395, Mary died after a riding accident. According to the 1383 agreement between their mother and the Polish lords, Jadwiga was her childless sister&#x27;s heir in Hungary. Vlad I of Wallachia, a Hungarian vassal, issued an act of submission on 28 May, acknowledging Jadwiga and her husband as Mary&#x27;s legitimate successors. The widowed king&#x27;s close supporter, Stibor of Stiboricz, expelled Vlad from Wallachia. Władysław-Jogaila gathered his troops on the Polish-Hungarian border, but , Palatine of Hungary, and , Archbishop of Esztergom, stopped his invasion of Hungary. In September, Konrad von Jungingen told the prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire that the union of Poland, Lithuania, and Hungary under Władysław-Jogaila&#x27;s rule would endanger Christendom. However, most of Sigismund&#x27;s opponents, who were especially numerous in Croatia, supported the claim of Ladislaus of Naples, the last male member of the Capetian House of Anjou. On 8 September, the most influential Hungarian lords declared that they would not support any change in government while Sigismund was far from Hungary fighting against the Ottoman Turks. Before the end of the year, peace negotiations between the representatives of Hungary and Poland ended with an agreement. Jadwiga adopted the title &quot;heir to Hungary&quot;, but she and her husband took no further action against Sigismund.

=== Conflict with the Teutonic Knights (1395–99) ===

The relationship between Lithuania and the Teutonic Knights remained tense. Jadwiga and her Polish advisers invited the Grand Master, Konrad von Jungingen, to Poland to open new negotiations in June 1396. Conflicts with Vladislaus of Opole and Siemowit of Masovia, who had not given up their claims to parts of Ruthenia and Cuyavia, also intensified. To demonstrate that the territories were under Jadwiga&#x27;s direct control, Władysław-Jogaila granted the Duchy of Belz (in Ruthenia) and Cuyavia to her in early 1397. However, Jadwiga and her Polish advisers wanted to avoid a war with the Teutonic Order. In response, Władysław-Jogaila replaced most Polish &quot;starostas&quot; (aldermen) in Ruthenia with local Orthodox noblemen. According to German sources, Władysław-Jogaila and Vytautas jointly asked Pope Boniface IX to sanction Vytautas&#x27; coronation as king of Lithuania and Ruthenia.

Jadwiga and Jungingen met in Włocławek in the middle of June, but they did not reach a compromise. The Teutonic Order entrusted Vladislaus of Opole with the task of representing their claims to Dobrzyń against Jadwiga. Jadwiga and her husband met Sigismund of Hungary, who had returned there after his catastrophic defeat in the Battle of Nicopolis, on 14 July. They seem to have reached a compromise because Sigismund offered to mediate between Poland, Lithuania and the Teutonic Knights. On Jadwiga&#x27;s request, Wenceslaus of Bohemia granted permission for the establishment of a college for Lithuanian students in Prague on 20 July 1397. Jadwiga, who had spent &quot;many sleepless nights&quot; thinking of this project, according to herself, issued a charter of establishment for the college on 10 November.

She opened new negotiations with the Teutonic Knights, but Konrad von Jungingen dispatched a simple knight to meet her in May 1398. Władysław-Jogaila&#x27;s cousin Vytautas also entered into negotiations with the Teutonic Knights because he wanted to unite Lithuania and Ruthenia under his rule and to receive a royal crown from the Holy See. According to the chronicle of John of Posilge, who was an official of the Teutonic Order, Jadwiga sent a letter to Vytautas, reminding him to pay the annual tribute that Władysław-Jogaila had granted her as dower. Offended by Jadwiga&#x27;s demand, Vytautas sought the opinion of the Lithuanian and Ruthenian lords who refused Jadwiga&#x27;s claim to a tribute. On 12 October 1398, he signed a peace treaty with the Teutonic Knights, without referring to Władysław-Jogaila&#x27;s right to confirm it. Oscar Halecki says that Posilge&#x27;s &quot;sensational story&quot; is either an invention based on gossip or a guess by the chronicler.

=== Pregnancy and death (1399) ===

Jadwiga was childless for over a decade, which, according to chronicles written in the Teutonic lands, caused conflicts between her and her husband. She became pregnant in late 1398 or early 1399. Sigismund, King of Hungary, came to Kraków in early March to negotiate for a campaign to defend Wallachia against the Ottoman Turks. Vytautas, in order to bolster his authority over the Rus&#x27; principalities, decided to launch an expedition against Timur, who had subdued the Golden Horde. According to Jan Długosz&#x27;s chronicle, Jadwiga warned the Polish noblemen not to join Vytautas&#x27; campaign because it would end in failure. Halecki says that the great number of Polish knights who joined Vytautas&#x27;s expedition proves that Długosz&#x27;s report is not reliable.

On the occasion of the expected birth to the royal couple, Jogaila&#x27;s cousin Vytautas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, sent expensive gifts, including a silver cradle, to the royal court on behalf of himself and his wife, Anna. The first horoscopes written for Jadwiga&#x27;s and Jogaila&#x27;s child predicted a son in mid-September 1398. However, a girl was delivered on 22 June 1399 at Wawel Castle. Reports of the time stated that the child was born prematurely. According to the horoscope, she was actually born slightly late. However, a due date of 18 June would rule out the suspicion of pregnancy as early as mid-September.

The newborn princess was named Elizabeth Bonifacia (, ), after Jadwiga&#x27;s mother and Pope Boniface IX who, in a letter of 5 May 1399, had agreed to be godfather under the condition that the infant be called Boniface or Bonifacia. She was baptised by Piotr Wysz Radoliński, Bishop of Kraków. However, the infant died after only three weeks, on 13 July 1399. Jadwiga, too, was on her deathbed. Stanisław of Skarbimierz expressed hope that she would survive, describing her as the spiritual mother of the poor, weak, and ill of Poland. She advised her husband to marry Anna of Cilli, Casimir the Great&#x27;s granddaughter—which he did—and died on 17 July 1399, four days after her newborn daughter.

Jadwiga and her daughter were buried together in Wawel Cathedral, on 24 August 1399, as stipulated in the Queen&#x27;s last will. On 12 July 1949, 550 years later, their tomb was opened; nothing remained of the child&#x27;s soft cartilage.

=== Achievements ===

Two leading historians, Oscar Halecki and S. Harrison Thomson, agree that Jadwiga was one of the greatest rulers of Poland, comparable to Bolesław the Brave and Casimir the Great. Her marriage to Władysław-Jogaila enabled the union of Poland and Lithuania, establishing a large state in East Central Europe. Jadwiga&#x27;s decision to marry the &#x27;elderly&#x27; Władysław-Jogaila instead of her beloved fiancé, William of Habsburg, has often been described as a sacrifice for her country in Polish historiography. Her biographers emphasize Jadwiga&#x27;s efforts to preserve the peace with the Teutonic Order, which enabled Poland to make preparations for a decisive war against the Knights. Jadwiga&#x27;s childless death weakened Władysław-Jogaila&#x27;s position because his claim to Poland was based on their marriage. Six days after her funeral, Władysław-Jogaila left Poland for Ruthenia, stating that he was to return to Lithuania after his wife&#x27;s death. The Polish lords sent their envoys to Lviv to open negotiations with him. The delegates took new oaths of loyalty to him, confirming his position as king. On the lords&#x27; demand, he agreed to marry Anna of Cilli. Their wedding was celebrated on 29 January 1402.

Jadwiga&#x27;s cultural and charitable activities were of exceptional value. She established new hospitals, schools and churches, and restored older ones. Jadwiga promoted the use of vernacular in church services, especially the singing of hymns in Polish. The Scriptures were translated into Polish on her order.

Casimir the Great had already in 1364 established the University of Kraków, but it did not survive his death. Władysław-Jogaila and Jadwiga jointly asked Pope Boniface IX to sanction the establishment of a faculty of theology in Kraków. The pope granted their request on 11 January 1397. Jadwiga bought houses along a central street of Kraków for the university. However, the faculty was only set up a year after Jadwiga&#x27;s death: Władysław-Jogaila issued the charter for the reestablished university on 26 July 1400. In accordance with Jadwiga&#x27;s last will, the restoration of the university was partially financed through the sale of her jewellery.

=== Holiness ===
Oscar Halecki writes that Jadwiga transmitted to the nations of East Central Europe the &quot;universal heritage of the &quot;respublica Christiana&quot;, which in the West was then waning, but in East Central Europe started flourishing and blending with the pre-Renaissance world&quot;. She was closely related to the saintly 13th-century princesses, venerated in Hungary and Poland, including Elizabeth of Hungary and her nieces, Kinga and Yolanda, and Salomea of Poland. She was born to a family famed for its religious zeal. She attended Mass every day. Following her family&#x27;s tradition, Jadwiga was especially devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary. An inscription engraved on her request on a precious chalice, which was placed in the Wawel Cathedral, asked Our Lady to place Poland under her protection.

Jadwiga was venerated in Poland soon after her death. Stanisław of Skarbimierz states that she had been &quot;the most Christian queen&quot; in his sermon composed for her funeral. Paul of Zator referred to the wax figures placed by her grave. Sermons written in the early 15th century emphasized that Jadwiga had been a representative of the traditional virtues of holy women, such as mercy and benevolence. Jadwiga&#x27;s contribution to the restoration of the University of Kraków was also mentioned by early 15th-century scholars.

Numerous legends about miracles were recounted to justify her sainthood. The two best-known are those of &quot;Jadwiga&#x27;s cross&quot; and &quot;Jadwiga&#x27;s foot&quot;:

Jadwiga often prayed before a large black crucifix hanging in the north aisle of Wawel Cathedral. During one of these prayers, the Christ on the cross is said to have spoken to her. The crucifix, &quot;Saint Jadwiga&#x27;s cross&quot;, is still there, with her relics beneath it. Because of this event, she is considered a medieval mystic. According to another legend, Jadwiga took a piece of jewellery from her foot and gave it to a poor stonemason who had begged for her help. When the queen left, he noticed her footprint in the plaster floor of his workplace, even though the plaster had already hardened before her visit. The supposed footprint, known as &quot;Jadwiga&#x27;s foot&quot;, can still be seen in one of Kraków&#x27;s churches.

In yet another legend, Jadwiga was taking part in a Corpus Christi Day procession when a coppersmith&#x27;s son drowned by falling into a river. Jadwiga threw her mantle over the boy&#x27;s body, and he regained life.

On 8 June 1979 Pope John Paul II prayed at her sarcophagus, and the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments officially affirmed her beatification on 8 August 1986. The Pope went on to canonize Jadwiga in Kraków on 8 June 1997.

== In popular culture ==

&quot;Hedvigis. Dziedziczka królestwa&quot; (2021), a Polish historical novel about the early life and reign of Jadwiga by Krzysztof Konopka, follows the story of Jadwiga, her sister Mary, and their mother. Jadwiga is the main character of the third season of Polish historical TV series &quot;Korona królów&quot; (The Crown of the Kings). She is played by Dagmara Bryzek. Child Jadwiga is played by Natalia Wolska and Amelia Zawadzka.

Jadwiga appears as the leader of the Polish civilization in the turn-based strategy game &quot;Civilization VI&quot;, specializing in religion and territorial expansion. She also features in Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition - Dawn of the Dukes in a campaign of her own.

Jadwiga is a playable character in the Mobile/PC Game &quot;Rise of Kingdoms&quot;.

<text>The John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC, originally known as the NASA Launch Operations Center), located on Merritt Island, Florida, is one of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration&#x27;s (NASA) ten field centers. Since 1968, KSC has been NASA&#x27;s primary launch center of American spaceflight, research, and technology. Launch operations for the Apollo, Skylab and Space Shuttle programs were carried out from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 and managed by KSC. Located on the east coast of Florida, KSC is adjacent to Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS). The management of the two entities work very closely together, share resources, and operate facilities on each other&#x27;s property.

Though the first Apollo flights and all Project Mercury and Project Gemini flights took off from the then-Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, the launches were managed by KSC and its previous organization, the Launch Operations Directorate. Starting with the fourth Gemini mission, the NASA launch control center in Florida (Mercury Control Center, later the Launch Control Center) began handing off control of the vehicle to the Mission Control Center in Houston, shortly after liftoff; in prior missions it held control throughout the entire mission.

Additionally, the center manages launch of robotic and commercial crew missions and researches food production and in-situ resource utilization for off-Earth exploration. Since 2010, the center has worked to become a multi-user spaceport through industry partnerships, even adding a new launch pad (LC-39C) in 2015.

There are about 700 facilities and buildings grouped throughout the center&#x27;s . Among the unique facilities at KSC are the tall Vehicle Assembly Building for stacking NASA&#x27;s largest rockets, the Launch Control Center, which conducts space launches at KSC, the Operations and Checkout Building, which houses the astronauts&#x27; dormitories and suit-up area, a Space Station factory, and a long Shuttle Landing Facility. There is also a Visitor Complex on site that is open to the public.

== Formation ==
Since 1949, the military had been performing launch operations at what would become Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. In December 1959, the Department of Defense transferred 5,000 personnel and the Missile Firing Laboratory to NASA to become the Launch Operations Directorate under NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center.

President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s 1961 goal of a crewed lunar landing by 1970 required an expansion of launch operations. On July 1, 1962, the Launch Operations Directorate was separated from MSFC to become the Launch Operations Center (LOC). Also, Cape Canaveral was inadequate to host the new launch facility design required for the mammoth tall, thrust Saturn V rocket, which would be assembled vertically in a large hangar and transported on a mobile platform to one of several launch pads. Therefore, the decision was made to build a new LOC site located adjacent to Cape Canaveral on Merritt Island.

NASA began land acquisition in 1962, buying title to and negotiating with the state of Florida for an additional . The major buildings in KSC&#x27;s Industrial Area were designed by architect Charles Luckman. Construction began in November 1962, and Kennedy visited the site twice in 1962, and again just a week before his assassination on November 22, 1963.

On November 29, 1963, the facility was named by President Lyndon B. Johnson under . Johnson&#x27;s order joined both the civilian LOC and the military Cape Canaveral station (&quot;the facilities of Station No. 1 of the Atlantic Missile Range&quot;) under the designation &quot;John F. Kennedy Space Center&quot;, spawning some confusion joining the two in the public mind. NASA administrator James E. Webb clarified this by issuing a directive stating the &quot;Kennedy Space Center&quot; name applied only to the LOC, while the Air Force issued a general order renaming the military launch site &quot;Cape Kennedy Air Force Station&quot;.

== Location ==
Located on Merritt Island, Florida, the center is north-northwest of Cape Canaveral on the Atlantic Ocean, midway between Miami and Jacksonville on Florida&#x27;s Space Coast, due east of Orlando. It is long and roughly wide, covering . KSC is a major central Florida tourist destination and is approximately one hour&#x27;s drive from the Orlando area. The Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex offers public tours of the center and Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.

== Historical programs ==
=== Apollo program ===


From 1967 through 1973, there were 13 Saturn V launches, including the ten remaining Apollo missions after Apollo 7. The first of two uncrewed flights, Apollo 4 (Apollo-Saturn 501) on November 9, 1967, was also the first rocket launch from KSC. The Saturn V&#x27;s first crewed launch on December 21, 1968, was Apollo 8&#x27;s lunar orbiting mission. The next two missions tested the Lunar Module: Apollo 9 (Earth orbit) and Apollo 10 (lunar orbit). Apollo 11, launched from Pad A on July 16, 1969, made the first Moon landing on July 20. The Apollo 11 launch included crewmembers Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Buzz Aldrin, and attracted a record-breaking 650 million television viewers. Apollo 12 followed four months later. From 1970 to 1972, the Apollo program concluded at KSC with the launches of missions 13 through 17.

=== Skylab ===
On May 14, 1973, the last Saturn V launch put the Skylab space station in orbit from Pad 39A. By this time, the Cape Kennedy pads 34 and 37 used for the Saturn IB were decommissioned, so Pad 39B was modified to accommodate the Saturn IB, and used to launch three crewed missions to Skylab that year, as well as the final Apollo spacecraft for the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project in 1975.

=== Space Shuttle ===



As the Space Shuttle was being designed, NASA received proposals for building alternative launch-and-landing sites at locations other than KSC, which demanded study. KSC had important advantages, including its existing facilities; location on the Intracoastal Waterway; and its southern latitude, which gives a velocity advantage to missions launched in easterly near-equatorial orbits. Disadvantages included: its inability to safely launch military missions into polar orbit, since spent boosters would be likely to fall on the Carolinas or Cuba; corrosion from the salt air; and frequent cloudy or stormy weather. Although building a new site at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico was seriously considered, NASA announced its decision in April 1972 to use KSC for the shuttle. Since the Shuttle could not be landed automatically or by remote control, the launch of &quot;Columbia&quot; on April 12, 1981 for its first orbital mission STS-1, was NASA&#x27;s first crewed launch of a vehicle that had not been tested in prior uncrewed launches.

In 1976, the VAB&#x27;s south parking area was the site of Third Century America, a science and technology display commemorating the U.S. bicentennial. Concurrent with this event, the U.S. flag was painted on the south side of the VAB. During the late 1970s, LC-39 was reconfigured to support the Space Shuttle. Two Orbiter Processing Facilities were built near the VAB as hangars with a third added in the 1980s.

KSC&#x27;s Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) was the orbiters&#x27; primary end-of-mission landing site, although the first KSC landing did not take place until the tenth flight, when &quot;Challenger&quot; completed STS-41-B on February 11, 1984; the primary landing site until then was Edwards Air Force Base in California, subsequently used as a backup landing site. The SLF also provided a return-to-launch-site (RTLS) abort option, which was not utilized. The SLF is among the longest runways in the world.

===Constellation===
On October 28, 2009, the Ares I-X launch from Pad 39B was the first uncrewed launch from KSC since the Skylab workshop in 1973.

=== Expendable launch vehicles (ELVs) ===
Beginning in 1958, NASA and military worked side by side on robotic mission launches (previously referred to as unmanned), cooperating as they broke ground in the field. In the early 1960s, NASA had as many as two robotic mission launches a month. The frequent number of flights allowed for quick evolution of the vehicles, as engineers gathered data, learned from anomalies and implemented upgrades. In 1963, with the intent of KSC ELV work focusing on the ground support equipment and facilities, a separate Atlas/Centaur organization was formed under NASA&#x27;s Lewis Center (now Glenn Research Center (GRC)), taking that responsibility from the Launch Operations Center (aka KSC).

Though almost all robotics missions launched from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS), KSC &quot;oversaw the final assembly and testing of rockets as they arrived at the Cape.&quot; In 1965, KSC&#x27;s Unmanned Launch Operations directorate became responsible for all NASA uncrewed launch operations, including those at Vandenberg Space Force Base. From the 1950s to 1978, KSC chose the rocket and payload processing facilities for all robotic missions launching in the U.S., overseeing their near launch processing and checkout. In addition to government missions, KSC performed this service for commercial and foreign missions also, though non-U.S. government entities provided reimbursement. NASA also funded Cape Canaveral Space Force Station launch pad maintenance and launch vehicle improvements.

All this changed with the Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984, after which NASA only coordinated its own and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) ELV launches. Companies were able to &quot;operate their own launch vehicles&quot; and utilize NASA&#x27;s launch facilities. Payload processing handled by private firms also started to occur outside of KSC. Reagan&#x27;s 1988 space policy furthered the movement of this work from KSC to commercial companies. That same year, launch complexes on Cape Canaveral Air Force Force Station started transferring from NASA to Air Force Space Command management.

In the 1990s, though KSC was not performing the hands-on ELV work, engineers still maintained an understanding of ELVs and had contracts allowing them insight into the vehicles so they could provide knowledgeable oversight. KSC also worked on ELV research and analysis and the contractors were able to utilize KSC personnel as a resource for technical issues. KSC, with the payload and launch vehicle industries, developed advances in automation of the ELV launch and ground operations to enable competitiveness of U.S. rockets against the global market.

In 1998, the Launch Services Program (LSP) formed at KSC, pulling together programs (and personnel) that already existed at KSC, GRC, Goddard Space Flight Center, and more to manage the launch of NASA and NOAA robotic missions. Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and VAFB are the primary launch sites for LSP missions, though other sites are occasionally used. LSP payloads such as the Mars Science Laboratory have been processed at KSC before being transferred to a launch pad on Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.
=== Artemis program ===

On 16 November 2022, at 06:47:44 UTC the Space Launch System (SLS) was launched from Complex 39B as part of the Artemis I mission.

=== Space station processing ===
As the International Space Station modules design began in the early 1990s, KSC began to work with other NASA centers and international partners to prepare for processing before launch onboard the Space Shuttles. KSC utilized its hands-on experience processing the 22 Spacelab missions in the Operations and Checkout Building to gather expectations of ISS processing. These experiences were incorporated into the design of the Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF), which began construction in 1991. The Space Station Directorate formed in 1996. KSC personnel were embedded at station module factories for insight into their processes.

From 1997 to 2007, KSC planned and performed on the ground integration tests and checkouts of station modules: three Multi-Element Integration Testing (MEIT) sessions and the Integration Systems Test (IST). Numerous issues were found and corrected that would have been difficult to nearly impossible to do on-orbit.

Today KSC continues to process ISS payloads from across the world before launch along with developing its experiments for on orbit. The proposed Lunar Gateway would be manufactured and processed at the Space Station Processing Facility.

== Current programs and initiatives ==


The following are current programs and initiatives at Kennedy Space Center:
* Commercial Crew Program
* Exploration Ground Systems Program
* Launch Services Program
* Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa)
* Research and Technology
* Artemis program
* Lunar Gateway
* International Space Station Payloads
* Camp KSC: educational camps for schoolchildren in spring and summer, with a focus on space, aviation and robotics.

== Facilities ==
The KSC Industrial Area, where many of the center&#x27;s support facilities are located, is south of LC-39. It includes the Headquarters Building, the Operations and Checkout Building and the Central Instrumentation Facility. The astronaut crew quarters are in the O&amp;C; before it was completed, the astronaut crew quarters were located in Hangar S at the Cape Canaveral Missile Test Annex (now Cape Canaveral Space Force Station). Located at KSC was the Merritt Island Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network station (MILA), a key radio communications and spacecraft tracking complex.

Facilities at the Kennedy Space Center are directly related to its mission to launch and recover missions. Facilities are available to prepare and maintain spacecraft and payloads for flight. The Headquarters (HQ) Building houses offices for the Center Director, library, film and photo archives, a print shop and security. When the KSC Library first opened, it was part of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency. However, in 1965, the library moved into three separate sections in the newly opened NASA headquarters before eventually becoming a single unit in 1970. The library contains over four million items related to the history and the work at Kennedy. As one of ten NASA center libraries in the country, their collection focuses on engineering, science, and technology. The archives contain planning documents, film reels, and original photographs covering the history of KSC. The library is not open to the public but is available for KSC, Space Force, and Navy employees who work on site. Many of the media items from the collection are digitized and available through NASA&#x27;s KSC Media Gallery or through their more up-to-date Flickr gallery.

A new Headquarters Building was completed in 2019 as part of the Central Campus consolidation. Groundbreaking began in 2014.

The center operated its own short-line railroad. This operation was discontinued in 2015, with the sale of its final two locomotives. A third had already been donated to a museum. The line was costing $1.3 million annually to maintain.

=== Payload manufacture and processing ===


* The Neil Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building (O&amp;C) (previously known as the Manned Spacecraft Operations Building) is a historic site on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places dating back to the 1960s and was used to receive, process, and integrate payloads for the Gemini and Apollo programs, the Skylab program in the 1970s, and for initial segments of the International Space Station through the 1990s. The Apollo and Space Shuttle astronauts would board the astronaut transfer van to launch complex 39 from the O&amp;C building.
* The three-story, Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF) consists of two enormous processing bays, an airlock, operational control rooms, laboratories, logistics areas and office space for support of non-hazardous Space Station and Shuttle payloads to ISO 14644-1 class 5 standards. Opened in 1994, it is the largest factory building in the KSC industrial area.
*The Vertical Processing Facility (VPF) features a door where payloads that are processed in the vertical position are brought in and manipulated with two overhead cranes and a hoist capable of lifting up to .
* The Hypergolic Maintenance and Checkout Facility (HMCA) comprises three buildings that are isolated from the rest of the industrial area because of the hazardous materials handled there. Hypergolic-fueled modules that made up the Space Shuttle Orbiter&#x27;s reaction control system, orbital maneuvering system and auxiliary power units were stored and serviced in the HMCF.
* The Multi-Payload Processing Facility is a building used for Orion spacecraft and payload processing.
*The Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility (PHSF) contains a service bay, with a , hook height. It also contains a payload airlock. Its temperature is maintained at .
*The Blue Origin rocket manufacturing facility is located immediately south of the KSC visitor complex. Completed in 2019, it serves as the company&#x27;s factory for the manufacture of New Glenn orbital rockets.

=== Launch Complex 39 ===

Launch Complex 39 (LC-39) was originally built for the Saturn V, the largest and most powerful operational launch vehicle until the Space Launch System, for the Apollo crewed Moon landing program. Since the end of the Apollo program in 1972, LC-39 has been used to launch every NASA human space flight, including Skylab (1973), the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project (1975), and the Space Shuttle program (1981–2011).

Since December 1968, all launch operations have been conducted from launch pads A and B at LC-39. Both pads are on the ocean, east of the VAB. From 1969 to 1972, LC-39 was the &quot;Moonport&quot; for all six Apollo crewed Moon landing missions using the Saturn V, and was used from 1981 to 2011 for all Space Shuttle launches.

Human missions to the Moon required the large three-stage Saturn V rocket, which was tall and in diameter. At KSC, Launch Complex 39 was built on Merritt Island to accommodate the new rocket. Construction of the $800 million project began in November 1962. LC-39 pads A and B were completed by October 1965 (planned Pads C, D and E were canceled), the VAB was completed in June 1965, and the infrastructure by late 1966.

The complex includes:
* the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB), a hangar capable of holding four Saturn Vs. The VAB was the largest structure in the world by volume when completed in 1965.
* a transporter capable of carrying 5,440 tons along a crawlerway to either of two launch pads;
* a mobile service structure, with three Mobile Launcher Platforms, each containing a fixed launch umbilical tower;
* the Launch Control Center; and
* a news media facility.

=== Launch Complex 48 ===


Launch Complex 48 (LC-48) is a multi-user launch site under construction for small launchers and spacecraft. It will be located between Launch Complex 39A and Space Launch Complex 41, with LC-39A to the north and SLC-41 to the south. LC-48 will be constructed as a &quot;clean pad&quot; to support multiple launch systems with differing propellant needs. While initially only planned to have a single pad, the complex is capable of being expanded to two at a later date.

=== Commercial leasing ===
As a part of promoting commercial space industry growth in the area and the overall center as a multi-user spaceport, KSC leases some of its properties. Here are some major examples:
* Exploration Park to multiple users (partnership with Space Florida)
* Shuttle Landing Facility to Space Florida (who contracts use to private companies)
* Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF)-3 to Boeing (for CST-100 Starliner)
* Launch Complex 39A, Launch Control Center Firing Room 4 and land for SpaceX&#x27;s Roberts Road facility (Hangar X) to SpaceX
* O&amp;C High Bay to Lockheed Martin (for Orion processing)
* Land for FPL&#x27;s Space Coast Next Generation Solar Energy Center to Florida Power and Light (FPL)
* Hypergolic Maintenance Facility (HMF) to United Paradyne Corporation (UPC)

=== Visitor complex ===


The Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, operated by Delaware North since 1995, has a variety of exhibits, artifacts, displays and attractions on the history and future of human and robotic spaceflight. Bus tours of KSC originate from here. The complex also includes the separate Apollo/Saturn V Center, north of the VAB and the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame, six miles west near Titusville. There were 1.5 million visitors in 2009. It had some 700 employees.

It was announced on May 29, 2015, that the Astronaut Hall of Fame exhibit would be moved from its current location to another location within the Visitor Complex to make room for an upcoming high-tech attraction entitled &quot;Heroes and Legends&quot;. The attraction, designed by Orlando-based design firm Falcon&#x27;s Treehouse, opened November 11, 2016.

In March 2016, the visitor center unveiled the new location of the iconic countdown clock at the complex&#x27;s entrance; previously, the clock was located with a flagpole at the press site. The clock was originally built and installed in 1969 and listed with the flagpole in the National Register of Historic Places in January 2000. In 2019, NASA celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Apollo program, and the launch of Apollo 10 on May 18. In summer of 2019, Lunar Module 9 (LM-9) was relocated to the Apollo/Saturn V Center as part of an initiative to rededicate the center and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Apollo Program.

===Historic locations===
NASA lists the following Historic Districts at KSC; each district has multiple associated facilities:
*Launch Complex 39: Pad A Historic District
*Launch Complex 39: Pad B Historic District
*Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) Area Historic District
*Orbiter Processing Historic District
*Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) Disassembly and Refurbishment Complex Historic District
*NASA KSC Railroad System Historic District
*NASA-owned Cape Canaveral Space Force Station Industrial Area Historic District

There are 24 historic properties outside of these historic districts, including the Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;, Vehicle Assembly Building, Crawlerway, and Operations and Checkout Building. KSC has one National Historic Landmark, 78 National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) listed or eligible sites, and 100 Archaeological Sites.

=== Other facilities ===
* The Rotation, Processing and Surge Facility (RPSF) is responsible for the preparation of solid rocket booster segments for transportation to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB). The RPSF was built in 1984 to perform SRB operations that had previously been conducted in high bays 2 and 4 of the VAB at the beginning of the Space Shuttle program. It was used until the Space Shuttle&#x27;s retirement, and will be used in the future by the Space Launch System (SLS) and OmegA rockets.

==Weather==

Florida&#x27;s peninsular shape and temperature contrasts between land and ocean provide ideal conditions for electrical storms, earning Central Florida the reputation as &quot;lightning capital of the United States&quot;. This makes extensive lightning protection and detection systems necessary to protect employees, structures and spacecraft on launch pads. On November 14, 1969, Apollo 12 was struck by lightning just after lift-off from Pad 39A, but the flight continued safely. The most powerful lightning strike recorded at KSC occurred at LC-39B on August 25, 2006, while shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; was being prepared for STS-115. NASA managers were initially concerned that the lightning strike caused damage to &quot;Atlantis&quot;, but none was found.

On September 7, 2004, Hurricane Frances directly hit the area with sustained winds of and gusts up to , the most damaging storm to date. The Vehicle Assembly Building lost 1,000 exterior panels, each x in size. This exposed of the building to the elements. Damage occurred to the south and east sides of the VAB. The shuttle&#x27;s Thermal Protection System Facility suffered extensive damage. The roof was partially torn off and the interior suffered water damage. Several rockets on display in the center were toppled. Further damage to KSC was caused by Hurricane Wilma in October 2005.

The conservative estimate by NASA is that the Space Center will experience 5 to 8 inches of sea level rise by the 2050s. Launch Complex 39A, the site of the Apollo 11 launch, is the most vulnerable to flooding, and has a 14% annual risk of flooding beginning in 2020.

== KSC directors ==

Since KSC&#x27;s formation, eleven NASA officials have served as directors, including three former astronauts (Crippen, Bridges and Cabana):

==In popular culture==

In addition to being frequently featured in documentaries, Kennedy Space Center has been portrayed on film many times. Some studio movies have even gained access and filmed scenes within the gates of the space center. If extras are needed in those scenes, space center employees are recruited (employees use personal time during filming). Films with scenes at KSC include:
*&quot;Moonraker&quot;
*&quot;Stowaway to the Moon&quot;
*&quot;SpaceCamp&quot;
*&quot;Apollo 13&quot;
*&quot;Contact&quot;
*&quot;Armageddon&quot;
*&quot;Space Cowboys&quot;
*&quot;Swades&quot;

<text>Roberta Joan Mitchell (née Anderson; born November 7, 1943) is a Canadian-American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and painter. As one of the most influential singer-songwriters to emerge from the 1960s circuit, Mitchell became known for her personal lyrics and unconventional compositions, which grew to incorporate elements of pop, jazz, and other genres. Among her accolades are eleven Grammy Awards, and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named her &quot;one of the greatest songwriters ever&quot;, and AllMusic has stated, &quot;Joni Mitchell may stand as the most important and influential female recording artist of the late 20th century.&quot;

Mitchell began singing in small nightclubs in Saskatoon and throughout western Canada, before moving on to the nightclubs of Toronto. She moved to the United States and began touring in 1965. Some of her original songs (&quot;Urge for Going&quot;, &quot;Chelsea Morning&quot;, &quot;Both Sides, Now&quot;, &quot;The Circle Game&quot;) were recorded by other singers, allowing her to sign with Reprise Records and record her debut album, &quot;Song to a Seagull&quot;, in 1968. Settling in Southern California, Mitchell helped define an era and a generation with popular songs such as &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot; and &quot;Woodstock&quot; (both 1970). Her 1971 album &quot;Blue&quot; is often cited as one of the greatest albums of all time; it was rated the 30th best album ever made in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2003 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, rising to number 3 in the 2020 edition. In 2000, &quot;The New York Times&quot; chose &quot;Blue&quot; as one of the 25 albums that represented &quot;turning points and pinnacles in 20th-century popular music&quot;. NPR ranked &quot;Blue&quot; number 1 on a 2017 list of the &quot;Greatest Albums Made By Women&quot;.

Mitchell began exploring more jazz-influenced ideas on 1974&#x27;s &quot;Court and Spark&quot;, which featured the radio hits &quot;Help Me&quot; and &quot;Free Man in Paris&quot; and became her best-selling album. Mitchell&#x27;s vocal range began to shift from mezzo-soprano to that of a wide-ranging contralto around 1975. Her distinctive piano and open-tuned guitar compositions also grew more harmonically and rhythmically complex as she melded jazz with rock and roll, R&amp;B, classical music and non-Western beats. Starting in the mid-1970s, she began working with noted jazz musicians including Jaco Pastorius, Tom Scott, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, and Pat Metheny as well as Charles Mingus, who asked her to collaborate on his final recordings. She later turned to pop and electronic music and engaged in political protest. She was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002.

Mitchell produced or co-produced most of her albums and designed most of her own album covers, describing herself as a &quot;painter derailed by circumstance&quot;. A critic of the music industry, she quit touring and released her 19th and last album of original songs in 2007. She gave occasional interviews and made appearances to speak on various causes over the next two decades, though the rupture of a brain aneurysm in 2015 led to a long period of recovery and therapy. A series of retrospective compilations were released over the time period, culminating in the Joni Mitchell Archives, a project to publish much of the unreleased material from her long career. She returned to public appearances in 2021, accepting several awards in person, including a Kennedy Center Honor. Mitchell returned to live performance with an unannounced show at the June 2022 Newport Folk Festival and has made several other appearances since, including headlining shows in 2023 and 2024.

==Early life and education==
Mitchell was born Roberta Joan Anderson on November 7, 1943, in Fort Macleod, Alberta, the daughter of Myrtle Marguerite (née McKee) and William Andrew Anderson. Her mother&#x27;s ancestors were Scottish and Irish; her father was from a Norwegian family that may have had some Sámi ancestry. Her mother was a teacher. Her father was a Royal Canadian Air Force flight lieutenant who instructed new pilots at RCAF Station Fort Macleod. During World War II, she moved with her parents to various bases in western Canada. After the war ended, her father worked as a grocer and her family moved to Saskatchewan, living in Maidstone and North Battleford. She later sang about her small-town upbringing in several of her songs, including &quot;Song for Sharon&quot;.

Mitchell contracted polio at age nine and was hospitalized for weeks. She also started smoking that year, but denies that smoking has affected her voice.

She moved with her family to Saskatoon, which she considers her hometown, at age 11. Mitchell struggled at school; her main interest was painting. During this time she briefly studied classical piano. She focused on her creative talent and considered a singing or dancing career for the first time. One unconventional teacher, Arthur Kratzmann, made an impact on her, stimulating her to write poetry; her first album includes a dedication to him. She dropped out of school in grade 12 (resuming her studies later) and hung out downtown with a rowdy set until she decided that she was getting too close to the criminal world.

Mitchell wanted to play the guitar, but as her mother associated the instrument with country music and disapproved of its hillbilly associations, she initially settled for the ukulele. Eventually she taught herself guitar from a Pete Seeger songbook. Polio had weakened her left hand, so she devised alternative tunings to compensate; she later used these tunings to create nonstandard approaches to harmony and structure in her songwriting.

Mitchell started singing with her friends at bonfires around Waskesiu Lake, northwest of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. She widened her repertoire to include her favourite performers, such as Édith Piaf and Miles Davis, at age 18. Her first paid performance was on October 31, 1962, at a Saskatoon club that featured folk and jazz performers. Although she never performed jazz herself in those days, Mitchell and her friends sought out gigs by jazz musicians. Mitchell said, &quot;My jazz background began with one of the early Lambert, Hendricks and Ross albums.&quot; That album, &quot;The Hottest New Group in Jazz&quot;, was hard to find in Canada, she says, &quot;so I saved up and bought it at a bootleg price. I considered that album to be my Beatles. I learned every song off of it, and I don&#x27;t think there is another album anywhere—including my own—on which I know every note and word of every song.&quot;

After graduating from high school at Aden Bowman Collegiate in Saskatoon, Mitchell took art classes at the Saskatoon Technical Collegiate with abstract expressionist painter Henry Bonli and left home to attend the Alberta College of Art in Calgary for the 1963–64 school year. She felt disillusioned about the high priority given to technical skill over free-class creativity there, and felt out of step with the trend toward pure abstraction and the tendency to move into commercial art. She dropped out of school after a year at age 20, due to an unexpected pregnancy (with her daughter Kilauren). She then started playing music in the nightclubs of Canada.

==Career==

===1964–1967: Career beginnings, motherhood, and first marriage===
She continued to play gigs as a folk musician on weekends at her college and at a local hotel. Around this time she took a $15-a-week job in a Calgary coffeehouse called The Depression Coffee House, &quot;singing long tragic songs in a minor key&quot;. She sang at hootenannies and made appearances on local TV and radio shows in Calgary. In 1964, at the age of 20, she told her mother that she intended to be a folk singer in Toronto. She left western Canada for the first time in her life, heading east for Ontario. Mitchell wrote her first song, &quot;Day After Day&quot;, on the three-day train ride. She stopped at the Mariposa Folk Festival to see Buffy Sainte-Marie, an American folk singer who had inspired her. A year later, Mitchell played Mariposa, her first gig for a major audience, and years later Sainte-Marie herself covered Mitchell&#x27;s work.

Lacking the $200 needed for musicians&#x27; union fees, Mitchell performed at a few gigs at the Half Beat and the Village Corner in Toronto&#x27;s Yorkville neighbourhood, but she mostly played non-union gigs &quot;in church basements and YMCA meeting halls&quot;. Rejected from major folk clubs, she resorted to busking, while she &quot;worked in the women&#x27;s wear section of a downtown department store to pay the rent.&quot; She lived in a rooming house, directly across the hall from poet Duke Redbird. Mitchell also began to realize each city&#x27;s folk scene tended to accord veteran performers the exclusive right to play their signature songs—despite not having written the songs—which Mitchell found insular, contrary to the egalitarian ideal of folk music. She found her best traditional material was already other singers&#x27; property. She said she was told You can&#x27;t sing that. That&#x27;s my song.&#x27; And I named another one. &#x27;You can&#x27;t sing that. That&#x27;s my song.&#x27; This is my introduction to territorial songs. I ran into it again in Toronto.&quot; She resolved to write her own songs.

Mitchell discovered that she was pregnant by her Calgary ex-boyfriend Brad MacMath in late 1964. She later wrote, &quot;[He] left me three months pregnant in an attic room with no money and winter coming on and only a fireplace for heat. The spindles of the banister were gap-toothed—fuel for last winter&#x27;s occupants.&quot; She gave birth to a baby girl in February 1965. Unable to provide for her daughter, Kelly Dale Anderson, she placed her for adoption. The experience remained private for most of Mitchell&#x27;s career, although she alluded to it in several songs, such as &quot;Little Green&quot;, which she performed in the 1960s and recorded for the 1971 album &quot;Blue&quot;. In &quot;Chinese Cafe&quot;, from the 1982 album &quot;Wild Things Run Fast&quot;, Mitchell sang, &quot;Your kids are coming up straight / My child&#x27;s a stranger / I bore her / But I could not raise her.&quot;

The existence of Mitchell&#x27;s daughter was not publicly known until 1993, when a roommate from Mitchell&#x27;s art school days in the 1960s sold the story of the adoption to a tabloid magazine. By that time, Mitchell&#x27;s daughter, renamed Kilauren Gibb, had already begun a search for her biological parents. Mitchell and her daughter met in 1997. After the reunion, Mitchell said that she lost interest in songwriting, and she later identified her daughter&#x27;s birth and her inability to take care of her as the moment when her songwriting inspiration had begun.

A few weeks after the birth of her daughter, Mitchell was playing gigs again around Yorkville, often with a friend, Vicky Taylor, and was beginning to sing original material for the first time, written with her unique open tunings. In March and April she found work at the Penny Farthing, a folk club in Toronto. There she met New York City-born American folk singer Charles Scott &quot;Chuck&quot; Mitchell, from Michigan. Chuck was immediately attracted to her and impressed by her performance, and he told her that he could get her steady work in the coffeehouses he knew in the United States.

Mitchell left Canada for the first time in late April 1965. She travelled with Chuck Mitchell to the US, where they began playing music together. Joni, 21 years old, married Chuck in an official ceremony in his hometown in June 1965 and took his surname. She said, &quot;I made my dress and bridesmaids&#x27; dresses. We had no money... I walked down the aisle brandishing my daisies.&quot; Mitchell is both a Canadian and US citizen.

While living at the Verona apartments in Detroit&#x27;s Cass Corridor, the couple regularly performed at area coffee houses, including the Chess Mate on Livernois, near Six Mile Road; the Alcove bar, near Wayne State University; the Rathskeller, a restaurant on the campus of the University of Detroit; and the Raven Gallery in Southfield. She began playing and composing songs in alternative guitar tunings taught to her by a fellow musician, Eric Andersen, in Detroit. Oscar Brand featured her several times on his CBC television program &quot;Let&#x27;s Sing Out&quot; in 1965 and 1966. The marriage and partnership of Joni and Chuck Mitchell ended with their divorce in early 1967, and she moved to New York City to follow her musical path as a solo artist. She played venues up and down the East Coast, including Philadelphia, Boston, and Fort Bragg, North Carolina. She performed frequently in coffeehouses and folk clubs and, by this time creating her own material, became well known for her unique songwriting and her innovative guitar style.

===1968–1969: Breakthrough with &quot;Song to a Seagull&quot; and &quot;Clouds&quot;===
Folk singer Tom Rush had met Mitchell in Toronto and was impressed with her songwriting ability. He took &quot;Urge for Going&quot; to the popular folk artist Judy Collins, but she was not interested in the song at the time, so Rush recorded it himself. Country singer George Hamilton IV heard Rush performing it and recorded a hit country version. Other artists who recorded Mitchell&#x27;s songs in the early years were Buffy Sainte-Marie (&quot;The Circle Game&quot;), Dave Van Ronk (&quot;Both Sides Now&quot;), and eventually Judy Collins (&quot;Both Sides Now&quot;, a top ten hit for her, and &quot;Michael from Mountains&quot;, both included on her 1967 album &quot;Wildflowers&quot;). Collins also covered &quot;Chelsea Morning&quot;, another recording that eclipsed Mitchell&#x27;s own commercial success early on.

While Mitchell was playing one night in 1967 in the Gaslight South, a club in Coconut Grove, Florida, David Crosby walked in and was immediately struck by her ability and her appeal as an artist. She accompanied him back to Los Angeles, where he set about introducing her and her music to his friends. Soon she was being managed by Elliot Roberts, who, after being urged by Buffy Sainte-Marie, had first seen her play in a Greenwich Village coffee house. He had a close business association with David Geffen. Roberts and Geffen were to have important influences on her career. She was signed to the Warners-affiliated Reprise label by talent scout Andy Wickham. Crosby convinced Reprise to let Mitchell record a solo acoustic album without the folk-rock overdubs in vogue at that time, and his clout earned him a producer&#x27;s credit in March 1968, when Reprise released her debut album, known either as &quot;Joni Mitchell&quot; or &quot;Song to a Seagull&quot;.

Mitchell toured steadily to promote the LP. The tour helped create eager anticipation for Mitchell&#x27;s second LP, &quot;Clouds&quot;, which was released in April 1969. This album contained Mitchell&#x27;s own versions of some of her songs already recorded and performed by other artists: &quot;Chelsea Morning&quot;, &quot;Both Sides, Now&quot;, and &quot;Tin Angel&quot;. The covers of both LPs, including a self-portrait on &quot;Clouds&quot;, were designed and painted by Mitchell, a blending of her painting and music that she continued throughout her career.

===1970–1972: &quot;Ladies of the Canyon&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;===

In March 1970, &quot;Clouds&quot; produced her first Grammy Award for Best Folk Performance. The following month, Reprise released her third album, &quot;Ladies of the Canyon&quot;. Mitchell&#x27;s sound was already beginning to expand beyond the confines of acoustic folk music and toward pop and rock, with more overdubs, percussion, and backing vocals, and for the first time, many songs composed on piano, which became a hallmark of Mitchell&#x27;s style in her most popular era. Her own version of &quot;Woodstock&quot;, slower than the cover by Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, was performed solo on a Wurlitzer electric piano. The album also included the already-familiar song &quot;The Circle Game&quot; and the environmental anthem &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot;, with its famous line, &quot;they paved paradise and put up a parking lot.&quot;

&quot;Ladies of the Canyon&quot; was an instant smash on FM radio and sold briskly, eventually becoming Mitchell&#x27;s first gold album (selling over a half million copies). She made a decision to stop touring for a year and just write and paint, yet she was still voted &quot;Top Female Performer&quot; for 1970 by &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, a leading UK pop music magazine. On the April 1971 release of James Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon&quot; album, Mitchell is credited with backup vocals on the track &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot;. The songs she wrote during the months she took off for travel and life experience appeared on her next album, &quot;Blue&quot;, released in June 1971. Comparing Joni Mitchell&#x27;s talent to his own, David Crosby said, &quot;By the time she did &quot;Blue&quot;, she was past me and rushing toward the horizon&quot;.

&quot;Blue&quot; was an almost instant critical and commercial success, peaking in the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart in September and also hitting the British Top 3. The lushly produced &quot;Carey&quot; was the single at the time, but musically, other parts of &quot;Blue&quot; departed further from the sounds of &quot;Ladies of the Canyon&quot;. Simpler, rhythmic acoustic parts allowed a focus on Mitchell&#x27;s voice and emotions (&quot;All I Want&quot;, &quot;A Case of You&quot;), while others such as &quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;River&quot; and &quot;The Last Time I Saw Richard&quot; were sung to her rolling piano accompaniment. Her most confessional album, Mitchell later said of &quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;I have, on occasion, sacrificed myself and my own emotional makeup, ... singing &#x27;I&#x27;m selfish and I&#x27;m sad&#x27;, for instance. We all suffer for our loneliness, but at the time of &quot;Blue&quot;, our pop stars never admitted these things.&quot; In its lyrics, the album was regarded as an inspired culmination of her early work, with depressed assessments of the world around her serving as counterpoint to exuberant expressions of romantic love (for example, in &quot;California&quot;). Mitchell later remarked, &quot;At that period of my life, I had no personal defenses. I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes. I felt like I had absolutely no secrets from the world and I couldn&#x27;t pretend in my life to be strong.&quot;

===1972–1975: &quot;For the Roses&quot; and &quot;Court and Spark&quot;===

Mitchell decided to return to the live stage after the great success of &quot;Blue&quot;, and she presented new songs on tour which appeared on her next album, her fifth, &quot;For the Roses&quot;. The album was released in October 1972 and immediately zoomed up the charts. She followed with the single, &quot;You Turn Me On, I&#x27;m a Radio&quot;, which peaked at No. 25 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in February 1973.

&quot;Court and Spark&quot;, released in January 1974, saw Mitchell begin the flirtation with jazz and jazz fusion that marked her experimental period ahead. &quot;Court and Spark&quot; went to No. 1 on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; Album Charts. The LP made Mitchell a widely popular act for perhaps the only time in her career, on the strength of popular tracks such as the rocker &quot;Raised on Robbery&quot;, which was released right before Christmas 1973, and &quot;Help Me&quot;, which was released in March of the following year, and became Mitchell&#x27;s only Top 10 single when it peaked at No. 7 in the first week of June. &quot;Free Man in Paris&quot; was another hit single and staple in her catalogue.

While recording &quot;Court and Spark&quot;, Mitchell had tried to make a clean break with her earlier folk sound, producing the album herself and employing jazz/pop fusion band the L.A. Express as what she called her first real backing group. In February 1974, her tour with the L.A. Express began, and they received rave notices as they travelled across the United States and Canada during the next two months. A series of shows at L.A.&#x27;s Universal Amphitheater from August 14–17 were recorded for a live album. In November, Mitchell released that album, &quot;Miles of Aisles&quot;, a two-record set including all but two songs from the L.A. concerts (one selection each from the Berkeley Community Theatre, on March 2, and the L.A. Music Center, on March 4, were also included in the set). The live album slowly moved up to No. 2, matching &quot;Court and Spark&quot;″s chart peak on &quot;Billboard&quot;. &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot;, the live version, was also released as a single and did reasonably well (she released another version of the song in 2007).

In January 1975, &quot;Court and Spark&quot; received four nominations for Grammy Awards, including Grammy Award for Album of the Year, for which Mitchell was the only woman nominated. She won only the Grammy Award for Best Arrangement, Instrumental and Vocals.

===1975–1977: &quot;The Hissing of Summer Lawns&quot; and &quot;Hejira&quot;===

Mitchell went into the studio in early 1975 to record acoustic demos of some songs that she had written since the &quot;Court and Spark&quot; tour. A few months later she recorded versions of the tunes with her band. Her musical interests were diverging from both the folk and the pop scene of the era, toward less structured, more jazz-inspired pieces, with a wider range of instruments. The new song cycle was released in November 1975 as &quot;The Hissing of Summer Lawns&quot;. On &quot;The Jungle Line&quot;, she made an early effort at sampling a recording of African musicians, something that became more commonplace among Western rock acts in the 1980s. &quot;In France They Kiss on Main Street&quot; continued the lush pop sounds of &quot;Court and Spark&quot;, and efforts such as the title song and &quot;Edith and the Kingpin&quot; chronicled the underbelly of suburban lives in Southern California.

During 1975, Mitchell also participated in several concerts in the Rolling Thunder Revue tours featuring Bob Dylan and Joan Baez, and in 1976 she performed as part of &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; by the Band. In January 1976, Mitchell received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for the album &quot;The Hissing of Summer Lawns&quot;, though the 1976 Grammy for that category went to Linda Ronstadt.

In early 1976, Mitchell travelled with friends who were driving cross country to Maine. Afterwards, she drove back to California alone and composed several songs during her journey which featured on her next album, 1976&#x27;s &quot;Hejira&quot;. She stated that &quot;This album was written mostly while I was traveling in the car. That&#x27;s why there were no piano songs ...&quot; &quot;Hejira&quot; was arguably Mitchell&#x27;s most experimental album so far, owing to her ongoing collaborations with jazz virtuoso bass guitarist Jaco Pastorius on several songs, namely the first single, &quot;Coyote&quot;, the atmospheric &quot;Hejira&quot;, the disorienting, guitar-heavy &quot;Black Crow&quot;, and the album&#x27;s last song &quot;Refuge of the Roads&quot;. The album climbed to No. 13 on the Billboard Charts, reaching gold status three weeks after release, and received airplay from album-oriented FM rock stations. Yet &quot;Coyote&quot;, backed with &quot;Blue Motel Room&quot;, failed to chart on the Hot 100. &quot;Hejira&quot; &quot;did not sell as briskly as Mitchell&#x27;s earlier, more &#x27;radio-friendly&#x27; albums, [but] its stature in her catalogue has grown over the years&quot;. Mitchell herself believes the album to be unique. In 2006 she said, &quot;I suppose a lot of people could have written a lot of my other songs, but I feel the songs on &quot;Hejira&quot; could only have come from me.&quot;

===1977–1980: &quot;Don Juan&#x27;s Reckless Daughter&quot; and &quot;Mingus&quot;===
In mid-1977, Mitchell began work on new recordings that became her first double studio album, &quot;Don Juan&#x27;s Reckless Daughter&quot;. Close to completing her contract with Asylum Records, Mitchell felt that this album could be looser in feel than any album she had done in the past. She invited Pastorius back, and he brought with him fellow members of jazz fusion pioneers Weather Report, including drummer Don Alias and saxophonist Wayne Shorter. Layered, atmospheric compositions such as &quot;Overture/Cotton Avenue&quot; featured more improvisatory collaboration, while &quot;Paprika Plains&quot; was a 16-minute epic that stretched the boundaries of pop, owing more to Mitchell&#x27;s memories of childhood in Canada and her study of classical music. &quot;Dreamland&quot; and &quot;The Tenth World&quot;, featuring Chaka Khan on backing vocals, were percussion-dominated tracks. Other songs continued the jazz-rock-folk collisions of &quot;Hejira&quot;. Mitchell also revived &quot;Jericho&quot;, written years earlier (a version is found on her 1974 live album) but never recorded in a studio setting. The album was released in December 1977, receiving mixed reviews but selling relatively well, peaking at No. 25 in the US and going gold within three months. 

Mitchell wore blackface and a pimp outfit on the album cover, one of the most controversial moments of her career that has been widely criticized as racist. She called her blackface alter ego &quot;Art Nouveau&quot;, inspired by a black man who once complimented her while walking down an LA street. She wore blackface several more times throughout her career and has consistently defended her use of it as late as 2017. However, in 2024, the album cover art on streaming services and physical reissues was changed to a photo of Mitchell’s face seemingly inside the open mouth of a wolflike dog, an outtake from the 1985 photo sessions for the later album &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;. No announcement was made about the change nor any official reason given, and Mitchell has not commented on the matter.

A few months after the release of &quot;Don Juan&#x27;s Reckless Daughter&quot;, Mitchell was contacted by the esteemed jazz composer, bandleader and bassist Charles Mingus, who had heard the orchestrated song &quot;Paprika Plains&quot;, and wanted her to work with him. She began a collaboration with Mingus, who died before the project was completed in 1979. She finished the tracks, and the resulting album, &quot;Mingus&quot;, was released in June 1979, though it was poorly received in the press. Fans were confused over such a major change in Mitchell&#x27;s overall sound, and though the album topped out at No. 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart—a higher placement than &quot;Don Juan&#x27;s Reckless Daughter&quot;—&quot;Mingus&quot; still fell short of gold status, making it her first album since the 1960s not to sell at least half a million copies.

Mitchell&#x27;s tour to promote &quot;Mingus&quot; began in August 1979 in Oklahoma City and concluded six weeks later with five shows at Los Angeles&#x27; Greek Theatre and one at the Santa Barbara County Bowl, where she recorded and filmed the concert. It was her first tour in several years, and with Pastorius, jazz guitarist Pat Metheny, and other members of her band, Mitchell also performed songs from her other jazz-inspired albums. When the tour ended she began a year of work, turning the tapes from the Santa Barbara County Bowl show into a two-album set and a concert film, both to be called &quot;Shadows and Light&quot;. Her final release on Asylum Records and her second live double album, it was released in September 1980, and made it up to No. 38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. A single from the LP, &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love?&quot;, Mitchell&#x27;s duet with The Persuasions (her opening act for the tour), bubbled under on &quot;Billboard&quot;, just missing the Hot 100.

===1981–1987: &quot;Wild Things Run Fast&quot;, &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;, and second marriage===
For a year and a half, Mitchell worked on the tracks for her next album.

While the album was being readied for release, her friend David Geffen, founder of Asylum Records, decided to start a new label, Geffen Records. Still distributed by Warner Bros. (who controlled Asylum Records), Geffen negated the remaining contractual obligations Mitchell had with Asylum and signed her to his new label. &quot;Wild Things Run Fast&quot; (1982) marked a return to pop songwriting, including &quot;Chinese Cafe/Unchained Melody&quot;, which incorporated the chorus and parts of the melody of the famous The Righteous Brothers hit, and &quot;(You&#x27;re So Square) Baby I Don&#x27;t Care&quot;, a remake of the Elvis chestnut, which charted higher than any Mitchell single since her 1970s sales peak when it climbed to No. 47 on the charts. The album peaked on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in its fifth week at No. 25. During this period she recorded with bassist and sound engineer Larry Klein, whom she married in 1982.
In early 1983, Mitchell began her &quot;Refuge&quot; world tour, visiting Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Scandinavia and then going back to the United States. A performance from the tour was videotaped and later released on home video (and later DVD) as &quot;Refuge of the Roads&quot;. As 1984 ended, Mitchell was writing new songs when she received a suggestion from Geffen that perhaps an outside producer with experience in the modern technical arenas that they wanted to explore might be a worthy addition. Mitchell hired the British synthpop musician Thomas Dolby to assist with synthesizers and production, but found working with him difficult: &quot;I was reluctant when Thomas was suggested because he had been asked to produce the record [by Geffen], and would he consider coming in as just a programmer and a player? So on that level we did have some problems ... He may be able to do it faster. He may be able to do it better, but the fact is that it then wouldn&#x27;t really be my music.&quot;

&quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;, released in October 1985, was only a moderate seller, reaching No. 63 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Albums Chart, Mitchell&#x27;s lowest chart position since her first album peaked at No. 189 almost eighteen years before. One of the songs on the album, &quot;Tax Free&quot;, created controversy by lambasting &quot;televangelists&quot; and what she saw as a drift to the religious right in American politics. &quot;The churches came after me&quot;, she wrote, &quot;they attacked me, though the Episcopalian Church, which I&#x27;ve seen described as the only church in America which actually uses its head, wrote me a letter of congratulation.&quot;

===1988–1993: &quot;Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm&quot; and &quot;Night Ride Home&quot;===
Mitchell continued experimenting with synthesizers, drum machines and sequencers for the recordings of her next album, 1988&#x27;s &quot;Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm&quot;. She also collaborated with artists including Willie Nelson, Billy Idol, Wendy &amp; Lisa, Tom Petty, Don Henley, Peter Gabriel, and Benjamin Orr of the Cars. The album&#x27;s first official single, &quot;My Secret Place&quot;, was a duet with Gabriel, and reached the top 50 on the Canadian singles chart. The song &quot;Lakota&quot; was one of many songs on the album to take on larger political themes, in this case the Wounded Knee incident, the deadly battle between Native American activists and the FBI on Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in the previous decade. Musically, several songs fit into the trend of world music popularized by Gabriel during the era. Reviews were mostly favourable towards the album, and the cameos by well-known musicians brought it considerable attention. &quot;Chalk Mark&quot; ultimately improved on the chart performance of &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;, peaking at No. 45.

In 1990, Mitchell, who by then rarely performed live, participated in Roger Waters&#x27; &quot;The Wall Concert in Berlin&quot;. She performed the song &quot;Goodbye Blue Sky&quot; and was also one of the performers on the concert&#x27;s final song &quot;The Tide Is Turning&quot; along with Waters, Cyndi Lauper, Bryan Adams, Van Morrison and Paul Carrack.

Throughout the first half of 1990, Mitchell recorded songs that appeared on her next album. She delivered the final mixes for the new album to Geffen just before Christmas, after trying nearly a hundred different sequences for the songs. The album &quot;Night Ride Home&quot; was released in March 1991. In the United States, it premiered on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Albums chart at No. 68, moving up to No. 48 in its second week, and peaking at No. 41 in its sixth week. In the United Kingdom, the album premiered at No. 25 on the albums chart. Critically, it was better received than her 1980s work. This album was also Mitchell&#x27;s first since Geffen Records was sold to MCA Inc., meaning that &quot;Night Ride Home&quot; was her first album not to be initially distributed by WEA (now Warner Music Group).

===1994–1999: &quot;Turbulent Indigo&quot;, &quot;Taming the Tiger&quot;, and divorce===

To wider audiences, the real return to form for Mitchell came with 1994&#x27;s Grammy-winning &quot;Turbulent Indigo&quot;. The recording of the album coincided with the end of Mitchell&#x27;s marriage to musician Larry Klein after 12 years; Klein was also co-producer of the album.

&quot;Indigo&quot; was seen as Mitchell&#x27;s most accessible set of songs in years. Songs such as &quot;Sex Kills&quot;, &quot;Sunny Sunday&quot;, &quot;Borderline&quot; and &quot;The Magdalene Laundries&quot; mixed social commentary and guitar-focused melodies for &quot;a startling comeback&quot;. The album won two Grammy awards, including Best Pop Album, and it coincided with a much-publicized resurgence in interest in Mitchell&#x27;s work by a younger generation of singer-songwriters.

In 1996, Mitchell agreed to release a greatest &quot;Hits&quot; collection, despite initial concerns that such a release would damage sales of her catalogue. Reprise also agreed to release a second album, called &quot;Misses&quot;, that would include some of the lesser-known songs from her career. &quot;Hits&quot; charted at No. 161 in the US, and achieved gold certification in the UK and Australia. Mitchell also included on &quot;Hits&quot;, for the first time on an album, her first recording, a version of &quot;Urge for Going&quot; which preceded &quot;Song to a Seagull&quot; but was previously released only as a B-side.
Two years later, Mitchell released her final set of &quot;original&quot; new work before nearly a decade of other pursuits, 1998&#x27;s &quot;Taming the Tiger&quot;. She promoted &quot;Tiger&quot; with a return to regular concert appearances, including a co-headlining tour with Bob Dylan and Van Morrison.

On the album, Mitchell had played a custom guitar equipped with a Roland hexaphonic pick-up that connected to a Roland VG-8 modelling processor. The device allowed Mitchell to play any of her many alternate tunings without having to re-tune the guitar. The guitar&#x27;s output, through the VG-8, was transposed to any of her tunings in real-time.

It was around this time that critics also began to notice a real change in Mitchell&#x27;s voice, particularly on her older songs; the singer later confirmed the change, explaining that &quot;I&#x27;d go to hit a note and there was nothing there&quot;. While her more limited range and huskier vocals have sometimes been attributed to her smoking (she was described by journalist Robin Eggar as &quot;one of the world&#x27;s last great smokers&quot;), Mitchell believes that the changes in her voice that became noticeable in the 1990s were because of other problems, including vocal nodules, a compressed larynx, and the lingering effects of having had polio. In an interview in 2004, she denied that &quot;my terrible habits&quot; had anything to do with her more limited range, and pointed out that singers often lose the upper register when they pass fifty. In addition, she contended that her voice had acquired a more interesting and expressive alto range when she could no longer hit the high notes, let alone hold them as she had in her youth.

===2000–2005: &quot;Both Sides Now&quot;, retirement tour and retrospectives===
The singer&#x27;s next two albums featured no new songs and, Mitchell has said, were recorded to &quot;fulfill contractual obligations&quot;, but on both she attempted to make use of her new vocal range in interpreting familiar material. &quot;Both Sides Now&quot; (2000) was an album composed mostly of covers of jazz standards, performed with an orchestra, featuring orchestral arrangements by Vince Mendoza. The album also contained remakes of &quot;A Case of You&quot; and the title track &quot;Both Sides, Now&quot;, two early hits transposed down to Mitchell&#x27;s new dusky, soulful alto range. It received mostly strong reviews and motivated a short national tour, with Mitchell accompanied by a core band featuring her ex-husband Larry Klein on bass plus a local orchestra on each tour stop. Its success led to 2002&#x27;s &quot;Travelogue&quot;, a collection of re-workings of her previous songs with lush orchestral accompaniments.

Mitchell stated at the time that &quot;Travelogue&quot; would be her final album. In a 2002 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, she voiced discontent with the state of the music industry, describing it as a &quot;cesspool&quot;. Mitchell expressed her dislike of the record industry&#x27;s dominance and her desire to control her own destiny, possibly by releasing her own music over the Internet.

During the next few years, the only albums Mitchell released were compilations of her earlier work. In 2003, her Geffen recordings were collected in a remastered four-disc box set, &quot;The Complete Geffen Recordings&quot;, including notes by Mitchell and three previously unreleased tracks. A series of themed compilations of songs from earlier albums were also released: &quot;The Beginning of Survival&quot; (2004), &quot;Dreamland&quot; (2004), and &quot;Songs of a Prairie Girl&quot; (2005), the last of which collected the threads of her Canadian upbringing and which she released after accepting an invitation to the Saskatchewan Centennial concert in Saskatoon. The concert, which featured a tribute to Mitchell, was also attended by Queen Elizabeth II. In the &quot;Prairie Girl&quot; liner notes, she wrote that the collection is &quot;my contribution to Saskatchewan&#x27;s Centennial celebrations&quot;.

In the early 1990s, Mitchell signed a deal with Random House to publish an autobiography. In 1998 she told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that her memoirs were &quot;in the works&quot;, that they would be published in as many as four volumes, and that the first line would be &quot;I was the only black man at the party.&quot; In 2005, Mitchell said that she was using a tape recorder to get her memories &quot;down in the oral tradition&quot;.

===2006–2010: &quot;Shine&quot; and other late recordings===
In an interview with the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; in October 2006, Mitchell &quot;revealed that she was recording her first collection of new songs in nearly a decade&quot;, but gave few other details. Four months later, in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Mitchell said that the forthcoming album, titled &quot;Shine&quot;, was inspired by the war in Iraq and &quot;something her grandson had said while listening to family fighting: &#x27;Bad dreams are good—in the great plan.&#x27;&quot; Early media reports characterized the album as having &quot;a minimal feel ... that harks back to [Mitchell&#x27;s] early work&quot; and a focus on political and environmental issues.

In February 2007, Mitchell returned to Calgary and served as an advisor for the Alberta Ballet Company premiere of &quot;The Fiddle and the Drum&quot;, a dance choreographed by Jean Grand-Maître to both new and old songs. She worked with the French-Canadian TV director Mario Rouleau, well known for work in art and dance for television, such as Cirque du Soleil. She also filmed portions of the rehearsals for a documentary that she was working on. Of the flurry of recent activity she quipped, &quot;I&#x27;ve never worked so hard in my life.&quot;

In mid-2007, Mitchell&#x27;s official fan-run site confirmed speculation that she had signed a two-record deal with Starbucks&#x27; Hear Music label. &quot;Shine&quot; was released by the label on September 25, 2007, debuting at number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, her highest chart position in the United States since the release of &quot;Hejira&quot; in 1976, over thirty years previously, and at number 36 on the United Kingdom albums chart. On the same day, Herbie Hancock, a longtime associate and friend of Mitchell, released &quot;&quot;, an album paying tribute to Mitchell&#x27;s work. Among the album&#x27;s contributors were Norah Jones, Tina Turner, Leonard Cohen, and Mitchell herself, who contributed a vocal to the re-recording of &quot;The Tea Leaf Prophecy (Lay Down Your Arms)&quot; (originally on her album &quot;Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm&quot;). On February 10, 2008, Hancock&#x27;s recording won Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards. It was the first time in 43 years that a jazz artist had taken the top prize at the annual award ceremony. In accepting the award, Hancock paid tribute to Mitchell as well as to Miles Davis and John Coltrane. At the same ceremony Mitchell won a Grammy for Best Instrumental Pop Performance for the opening track, &quot;One Week Last Summer&quot;, from her album &quot;Shine&quot;.

In 2009, Mitchell stated she had the skin condition Morgellons and that she would leave the music industry to work toward giving more credibility to people who suffer from Morgellons.

In a 2010 interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Mitchell was quoted as saying that singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, with whom she had worked closely in the past, was a fake and a plagiarist. The controversial remark was widely reported by other media. Mitchell did not explain the contention further, but several media outlets speculated that it may have related to the allegations of plagiarism surrounding some lyrics on Dylan&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Modern Times&quot;. In a 2013 interview with Jian Ghomeshi, she was asked about the comments and responded by denying that she had made the statement while mentioning the allegations of plagiarism that arose over the lyrics to Dylan&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Love and Theft&quot; in the general context of the flow and ebb of the creative process of artists.

===2010–2022: health problems, recovery, and archival projects===
Although Mitchell said that she would no longer tour or give concerts, she made occasional public appearances to speak on environmental issues. Mitchell divides her time between her longtime home in Los Angeles, and the property in Sechelt, British Columbia, that she has owned since the early 1970s. &quot;L.A. is my workplace&quot;, she said in 2006, &quot;B.C. is my heartbeat&quot;. Since 2011, she said she focuses mainly on her visual art, which she does not sell and displays only on rare occasions.

In March 2015, Mitchell suffered a brain aneurysm rupture, which required her to undergo physical therapy and take part in daily rehabilitation. Mitchell made her first public appearance following the aneurysm when she attended a Chick Corea concert in Los Angeles in August 2016. She made a few other appearances, and in November 2018 David Crosby said that she was learning to walk again.

Since 2018, Mitchell has approved a number of archival projects. In September 2018, Eagle Rock Entertainment released the Murray Lerner-directed documentary &quot;Both Sides Now: Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970&quot;, which included restored video footage and previously unseen interviews with Mitchell, plus a separate program featuring the complete concert uninterrupted. On November 2, 2018, Mitchell released an 8-LP vinyl reissue of &quot;Love Has Many Faces: A Quartet, A Ballet, Waiting to Be Danced&quot;. A limited-edition blue vinyl edition of &quot;Blue&quot; followed in January 2019.

On November 7, 2018, Mitchell attended the &quot;Joni 75: A Birthday Celebration&quot; concert in Los Angeles. To celebrate her 75th birthday, artists Brandi Carlile, Emmylou Harris, James Taylor, Chaka Khan, Graham Nash, Seal, Kris Kristofferson, and others interpreted songs written by Mitchell. Fellow Canadian artist Diana Krall offered two performances. Selections from that night&#x27;s performances were released on DVD, along with a separate CD release. A vinyl edition of the album was released for Record Store Day in April 2019. Mitchell later attended another tribute concert, Songs Are Like Tattoos, which featured &quot;Joni 75&quot; participant Brandi Carlile performing Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Blue&quot; album in full.

Mitchell approved &quot;Joni: The Joni Mitchell Sessions&quot;, a book of photos taken and collected by Norman Seeff, released in November 2018. Mitchell also revisited her poetry with &quot;Morning Glory on the Vine&quot;, a collection of facsimile handwritten lyrics, poetry and artwork originally compiled in 1971 as a gift for friends and family. The expanded and reformatted wide-release edition of &quot;Morning Glory on the Vine&quot; was published on October 22, 2019, in a standard hardcover edition, as well as a limited signed edition.

In September 2020, it was announced that Mitchell and Rhino Records had created the Joni Mitchell Archives, a series of catalogue releases containing material from the singer&#x27;s personal vaults. The project&#x27;s first release, a five-disc collection titled &quot;Joni Mitchell Archives – Vol. 1: The Early Years (1963–1967)&quot;, followed on October 30, 2020. In April 2022 Mitchell received a Grammy Award for &#x27;Best Historical Album&#x27; for this release. She showed up personally to collect the award. On the same day, Mitchell released &quot;Early Joni – 1963&quot; and &quot;Live at Canterbury House – 1967&quot; (both culled from the 5-CD box set) as standalone vinyl releases.

A special remastered collection of Mitchell&#x27;s first four albums (&quot;Song to a Seagull&quot;, &quot;Clouds&quot;, &quot;Ladies of the Canyon&quot; and &quot;Blue)&quot; was released on July 2, 2021, as &quot;The Reprise Albums (1968–1971)&quot;. The collection is the first to feature a new mix of Mitchell&#x27;s 1968 debut album, overseen by Mitchell herself. Commenting on the original mix of &quot;Song to a Seagull&quot;, Mitchell called it &quot;atrocious&quot; and said it sounded like it &quot;had been recorded under a bowl of Jello.&quot;

On January 28, 2022, Mitchell demanded that Spotify remove her songs from its streaming service in solidarity with her long-time friend and fellow childhood polio survivor Neil Young, who removed his tracks from the streaming platform in protest against COVID-19 misinformation on the popular Spotify-hosted podcast &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot;. She wrote on her website: &quot;Irresponsible people are spreading lies that are costing people their lives. I stand in solidarity with Neil Young and the global scientific and medical communities on this issue.&quot; British National Health Service doctor and author Rachel Clarke tweeted: &quot;Both Neil Young &amp; Joni Mitchell… know painfully well how much harm, suffering &amp; avoidable death anti-vaxxers can cause.&quot;

On April 1, 2022, Mitchell was honoured as the 2022 MusiCares Person of the Year by the Recording Academy. Mitchell was present at the Awards show accepting the award personally.

=== Since 2022: return to live performance ===

On July 24, 2022, Joni Mitchell appeared unannounced as a special guest in the closing performance of the final day of the Newport Folk Festival in Rhode Island, where she had first played in 1967, as part of a set billed as &quot;Brandi Carlile and Friends&quot;. Supported by a group of well-wisher musicians, she participated in a 13-song set of her own material and covers, including one that she played as a solo on electric guitar.

In 2017, Mitchell had been inspired by a music-making visit from an old friend, singer-songwriter Eric Andersen, to begin hosting monthly music sessions at her home in Laurel Canyon. The sessions became known as &quot;Joni Jams&quot;. Brandi Carlile organized the sessions and recruited musicians, and among those who came over the years to play music and sing in Mitchell&#x27;s living room were Elton John, Paul McCartney, Bonnie Raitt, Harry Styles, Chaka Khan, Marcus Mumford, Herbie Hancock, Jess Wolfe, Holly Laessig, Taylor Goldsmith, Blake Mills, and Hozier. 

Mitchell was delighted by the return of music to her home. The music sessions raised her spirits and assisted her recovery from the serious and disabling aneurysm she had suffered in 2015, and she began to sing in the sessions and learn to play guitar again. As her health improved, a return to live performance began to seem possible, plans were cautiously laid, a set list was prepared; and in July 2022, after a rehearsal the night before, Mitchell joined Carlile and others on stage at the Newport Festival for a live Joni Jam, her first public performance in nine years.

Mitchell was given an ecstatic reception, and she said afterwards, &quot;I was delighted and honoured. It gave me the bug for it.&quot; Songs performed included &quot;Carey&quot;, &quot;Come in from the Cold&quot;, &quot;A Case of You&quot;, &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot;, &quot;Both Sides Now&quot;, &quot;The Circle Game&quot; and Gershwin and Heyward&#x27;s &quot;Summertime&quot;. After her appearance at Newport, Mitchell told Carlile, &quot;I want to do another show. I want to play again.&quot; The Newport set was released as a live album in 2023 and won the Grammy Award for Best Folk Album in 2024.

On October 19, 2022, Carlile announced that Mitchell would play a headline concert, billed as &quot;Joni Jam 2&quot;, in a weekend event at Washington State&#x27;s Gorge Amphitheatre, &quot;one of the most beautiful venues in the world&quot;, on June 10, 2023. Mitchell&#x27;s last official headline shows had been on the Both Sides Now tour in 2000. Her 2023 appearance at Gorge Amphitheatre attracted a capacity audience of 27,000. In her first headline concert in 23 years, supported by 19 singers and musicians, Mitchell performed a nearly three-hour set of 21 songs plus a three-song encore in which she played guitar. Annie Lennox, who sang on &quot;Ladies of the Canyon&quot;, said Mitchell was &quot;a visionary, a legend and an inspiration.&quot;

Mitchell was awarded the 2023 Gershwin Prize for her lifetime contributions to popular music. She was celebrated with a concert on March 2 in Washington, D.C., where musicians taking part included Brandi Carlile, Annie Lennox, Angélique Kidjo, Herbie Hancock, Diana Krall, Cyndi Lauper, Graham Nash, James Taylor, Ledisi, Lucius, Marcus Mumford, Sara Bareilles and Celisse. Mitchell performed &quot;Summertime&quot; and participated in all-star renditions of her songs &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot; and &quot;The Circle Game&quot;.

On February 4, 2024, Mitchell performed for the first time at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards. Further Joni Jam concert dates were announced for Saturday October 19 and Sunday October 20, 2024, at the 18,000 capacity Hollywood Bowl, where Mitchell performed three-hour sets with Brandi Carlile, Marcus Mumford, Annie Lennox and numerous supporting musicians.

On March 22, 2024, Mitchell restored her music to Spotify after Neil Young did the same, ending her protest over Spotify&#x27;s hosting of &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot;.

==Legacy==

===Guitar style===
While some of Mitchell&#x27;s most popular songs were written on the piano, almost every song she composed on the guitar uses an open, or non-standard, tuning; she has written songs in some 50 tunings, playing what she has called &quot;Joni&#x27;s weird chords&quot;. The use of alternative tunings allows guitarists to produce accompaniment with more varied and wide-ranging textures. Her right-hand picking/strumming technique has evolved over the years from an initially intricate picking style, typified by the guitar songs on her first album, to a looser and more rhythmic style, sometimes incorporating percussive &quot;slaps&quot;.

In 1995, Mitchell&#x27;s friend Fred Walecki, proprietor of Westwood Music in Los Angeles, developed a solution to alleviate her continuing frustration with using multiple alternative tunings in live settings. Walecki designed a Stratocaster-style guitar to function with the Roland VG-8 virtual guitar, a system capable of configuring her numerous tunings electronically. While the guitar itself remained in standard tuning, the VG-8 encoded the pick-up signals into digital signals which were then translated into the altered tunings. This allowed Mitchell to use one guitar on stage, while an off-stage tech entered the preprogrammed tuning for each song in her set.

Mitchell was highly innovative harmonically in her early work (1966–1972), incorporating modality, chromaticism, and pedal points. On her 1968 debut album &quot;Song to a Seagull&quot;, Mitchell used both quartal and quintal harmony in &quot;The Dawntreader&quot; and quintal harmony in &quot;Song to a Seagull&quot;.

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named her the 72nd-greatest guitarist of all time; she was the highest-ranked woman on the list.

===Influence===
Mitchell&#x27;s approach to music struck a chord with many female listeners. In an era dominated by the stereotypical male rock star, she presented herself as &quot;multidimensional and conflicted ... allow[ing] her to build such a powerful identification among her female fans&quot;. Mitchell asserted her desire for artistic control throughout her career, and still holds the publishing rights for her music. She has disclaimed the notion that she is a &quot;feminist&quot;; in a 2013 interview she rejected the label, stating, &quot;I&#x27;m not a feminist. I don&#x27;t want to get a posse against men. I&#x27;d rather go toe-to-toe; work it out.&quot; David Shumway notes that Mitchell &quot;became the first woman in popular music to be recognized as an artist in the full sense of that term... Whatever Mitchell&#x27;s stated views of feminism, what she represents more than any other performer of her era is the new prominence of women&#x27;s perspectives in cultural and political life.&quot;

Mitchell&#x27;s work has had an influence on many other artists, including Taylor Swift, Björk, Prince, Ellie Goulding, Harry Styles, Corinne Bailey Rae, Gabrielle Aplin, Mikael Åkerfeldt from Opeth, Pink Floyd&#x27;s David Gilmour, Marillion members Steve Hogarth and Steve Rothery, their former vocalist and lyricist Fish, Paul Carrack, Haim, Lorde, and Clairo. Madonna has also cited Mitchell as the first female artist that really spoke to her as a teenager; &quot;I was really, really into Joni Mitchell. I knew every word to &quot;Court and Spark&quot;; I worshipped her when I was in high school. &quot;Blue&quot; is amazing. I would have to say of all the women I&#x27;ve heard, she had the most profound effect on me from a lyrical point of view.&quot;

Several artists have had success covering Mitchell&#x27;s songs. Judy Collins&#x27;s 1967 recording of &quot;Both Sides, Now&quot; reached No. 8 on &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and was a breakthrough in the career of both artists. (Mitchell&#x27;s own recording did not see release until two years later, on her second album &quot;Clouds&quot;.) This is Mitchell&#x27;s most-covered song by far, with over 1,200 versions recorded at latest count. Hole also covered &quot;Both Sides, Now&quot; in 1991 on their debut album, &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot;, retitling it &quot;Clouds&quot;, with the lyrics altered by frontwoman Courtney Love. Pop group Neighborhood in 1970 and Amy Grant in 1995 scored hits with covers of &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot;, the third-most covered song in Mitchell&#x27;s repertoire (with over 300 covers). More recent releases of this song included versions by Counting Crows in 2002 and Nena in 2007. Janet Jackson used a sample of the chorus of &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot; as the centerpiece of her 1997 hit single &quot;Got &#x27;Til It&#x27;s Gone&quot;, which also features rapper Q-Tip saying &quot;Joni Mitchell never lies&quot;. &quot;River&quot;, from Mitchell&#x27;s album &quot;Blue&quot; became the second-most covered song of Mitchell&#x27;s in 2013 as many artists chose it for their holiday albums. Rap artists Kanye West and Mac Dre have also sampled Mitchell&#x27;s vocals in their music. In addition, Annie Lennox has covered &quot;Ladies of the Canyon&quot; for the B-side of her 1995 hit &quot;No More I Love You&#x27;s&quot;. Mandy Moore covered &quot;Help Me&quot; in 2003. In 2004 singer George Michael covered her song &quot;Edith and the Kingpin&quot; for a radio show. &quot;River&quot; has been one of the most popular songs covered in recent years, with versions by Dianne Reeves (1999), James Taylor (recorded for television in 2000, and for CD release in 2004), Allison Crowe (2004), Rachael Yamagata (2004), Aimee Mann (2005), and Sarah McLachlan (2006). McLachlan also did a version of &quot;Blue&quot; in 1996, and Cat Power recorded a cover of &quot;Blue&quot; in 2008. Other Mitchell covers include the famous &quot;Woodstock&quot; by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, Eva Cassidy, and Matthews Southern Comfort; &quot;This Flight Tonight&quot; by Nazareth; and well-known versions of &quot;A Case of You&quot; by Tori Amos, Michelle Branch, Jane Monheit, Prince, Diana Krall, James Blake, and Ana Moura. A 40th anniversary version of &quot;Woodstock&quot; was released in 2009 by Nick Vernier Band featuring Ian Matthews (formerly of Matthews Southern Comfort). Fellow Canadian singer k.d. lang recorded two of Mitchell&#x27;s songs (&quot;A Case of You&quot; and &quot;Jericho&quot;) for her 2004 album &quot;Hymns of the 49th Parallel&quot; which is composed entirely of songs written by Canadian artists.

Prince&#x27;s version of &quot;A Case of U&quot; appeared on &quot;A Tribute to Joni Mitchell&quot;, a 2007 compilation released by Nonesuch Records, which also featured Björk (&quot;The Boho Dance&quot;), Caetano Veloso (&quot;Dreamland&quot;), Emmylou Harris (&quot;The Magdalene Laundries&quot;), Sufjan Stevens (&quot;Free Man in Paris&quot;) and Cassandra Wilson (&quot;For the Roses&quot;), among others.

Several other songs reference Joni Mitchell. The song &quot;Our House&quot; by Graham Nash refers to Nash&#x27;s two-year relationship with Mitchell at the time that Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young recorded the &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; album. Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Going to California&quot; was said to be written about Robert Plant and Jimmy Page&#x27;s infatuation with Mitchell, a claim that seems to be borne out by the fact that, in live performances, Plant often says &quot;Joni&quot; after the line &quot;To find a queen without a king, they say she plays guitar and cries and sings&quot;. Jimmy Page uses a double dropped D guitar tuning similar to the alternative tunings Mitchell uses. The Sonic Youth song &quot;Hey Joni&quot; is named for Mitchell. Alanis Morissette also mentions Mitchell in one of her songs, &quot;Your House&quot;. British folk singer Frank Turner mentions Mitchell in his song &quot;Sunshine State&quot;. The Prince song &quot;The Ballad of Dorothy Parker&quot; contains the lyric – Oh, my favourite song&#x27; she said – and it was Joni singing &#x27;Help me I think I&#x27;m falling. &quot;Lavender&quot; by Marillion was partly influenced by &quot;going through parks listening to Joni Mitchell&quot;, according to vocalist and lyricist Fish, and she was later mentioned in the lyrics of their song &quot;Montreal&quot; from &quot;Sounds That Can&#x27;t Be Made&quot;. John Mayer makes reference to Mitchell and her &quot;Blue&quot; album in his song &quot;Queen of California&quot;, from his 2012 album &quot;Born and Raised&quot;. The song contains the lyric &quot;Joni wrote &quot;Blue&quot; in a house by the sea&quot;. Taylor Swift also details Mitchell&#x27;s departure from the music industry in her song &quot;The Lucky One&quot; from her 2012 album &quot;Red&quot;.

In 2003, playwright Bryden MacDonald launched &quot;When All the Slaves Are Free&quot;, a musical revue based on Mitchell&#x27;s music.

Mitchell&#x27;s music and poems have deeply influenced the French painter Jacques Benoit&#x27;s work. Between 1979 and 1989 Benoit produced sixty paintings, corresponding to a selection of fifty of Mitchell&#x27;s songs.

Maynard James Keenan of the American progressive metal band Tool has cited Mitchell as an influence, claiming that her influence is what allows him to &quot;soften [staccato, rhythmic, insane mathematical paths] and bring [them] back to the center, so you can listen to it without having an eye-ache.&quot; A Perfect Circle, another band featuring Keenan as lead vocalist, recorded a rendition of Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;The Fiddle and the Drum&quot; on their 2004 album &quot;eMOTIVe&quot;, a collection of anti-war cover songs.

==Awards and honours==

In tribute to Mitchell, the TNT network presented an all-star celebration at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City on April 6, 2000. Mitchell&#x27;s songs were sung by many performers, including James Taylor, Elton John, Wynonna Judd, Bryan Adams, Cyndi Lauper, Diana Krall, and Richard Thompson. Mitchell herself ended the evening with a rendition of &quot;Both Sides, Now&quot; with a 70-piece orchestra. The version was featured on the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Love Actually&quot;.

In 2008, Mitchell was ranked 42nd on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;100 Greatest Singers&quot; list and in 2015 she was ranked ninth on their list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time.

To celebrate Mitchell&#x27;s 70th birthday, the 2013 Luminato Festival in Toronto held a set of tribute concerts entitled &quot;Joni: A Portrait in Song – A Birthday Happening Live&quot; at Massey Hall on June 18 and 19. Performers included Rufus Wainwright, Herbie Hancock, Esperanza Spalding, and rare performances by Mitchell herself.

Due to health problems, she did not attend the San Francisco gala in May 2015 to receive the SFJAZZ Lifetime Achievement Award.

In 2018, Mitchell was honoured by the city of Saskatoon, when two plaques were erected to commemorate her musical beginnings in Saskatoon. One was installed by the Broadway Theatre beside the former Louis Riel Coffee House, where Mitchell played her first paid gig. A second plaque was installed at River Landing, near the Remai Modern art gallery and Persephone Theatre performing arts centre. As well, the walkway along Spadina Crescent between Second and Third Avenues was formally named the &quot;Joni Mitchell Promenade&quot;.

In 2020, Mitchell received the Les Paul Award, becoming the first woman to be so honoured. She was named as MusiCares Person of the Year in 2022.

In 2021, Mitchell was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Historical Album, for her &quot;Archives, Vol. 1: The Early Years (1963–1967)&quot; collection. She won the award on April 3, 2022.

<doc id="16425" wikidata="Q453924" url="?curid=16425" title="Justus">
<text>Justus (died on 10 November between 627 and 631) was the fourth archbishop of Canterbury. Pope Gregory the Great sent Justus from Italy to England on a mission to Christianise the Anglo-Saxons from their native paganism; he probably arrived with the second group of missionaries despatched in 601. Justus became the first bishop of Rochester in 604 and signed a letter to the Irish bishops urging the native Celtic church to adopt the Roman method of calculating the date of Easter. He attended a church council in Paris in 614.

Following the death of King Æthelberht of Kent in 616, Justus was forced to flee to Gaul but was reinstated in his diocese the following year. In 624, he was elevated to Archbishop of Canterbury, overseeing the despatch of missionaries to Northumbria. After his death, he was revered as a saint and had a shrine in St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey, Canterbury, to which his remains were translated in the 1090s.

==Arrival in Britain==

Justus was a member of the Gregorian mission sent to England by Pope Gregory I. Almost everything known about Justus and his career is derived from the early 8th-century &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot; of Bede. As Bede does not describe Justus&#x27;s origins, nothing is known about him before he arrived in England. He probably arrived in England with the second group of missionaries, sent at the request of Augustine of Canterbury in 601. Some modern writers describe Justus as one of the original missionaries who arrived with Augustine in 597, but Bede believed that Justus came in the second group. The second group included Mellitus, who later became Bishop of London and Archbishop of Canterbury.

If Justus was a member of the second group of missionaries, then he arrived with a gift of books and &quot;all things which were needed for worship and the ministry of the Church&quot;. A 15th-century Canterbury chronicler, Thomas of Elmham, claimed that there were some books brought to England by that second group still at Canterbury in his day, although he did not identify them. An investigation of extant Canterbury manuscripts shows that one possible survivor is the St Augustine Gospels, now in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge Manuscript (MS) 286.

==Bishop of Rochester==
Augustine consecrated Justus as a bishop in 604 over a province including the Kentish town of Rochester. The historian Nicholas Brooks argues that the choice of Rochester was probably not because it had been a Roman-era bishopric, but rather because of its importance in the politics of the time. Although the town was small, with just one street, it was at the junction of Watling Street and the estuary of the Medway and was thus a fortified town. Because Justus was probably not a monk (Bede did not call him that), his cathedral clergy was very likely non-monastic too.

A charter purporting to be from King Æthelberht, dated 28 April 604, survives in the &quot;Textus Roffensis&quot;, as well as a copy based on the Textus in the 14th-century &quot;Liber Temporalium&quot;. Written mostly in Latin but using an Old English boundary clause, the charter records a land grant near Rochester to Justus&#x27;s church. Among the witnesses is Laurence, Augustine&#x27;s future successor, but not Augustine himself. The text turns to two different addressees. First, Æthelberht is made to admonish his son Eadbald, who had been established as a sub-ruler in the region of Rochester. The grant itself is addressed directly to Saint Andrew, the patron saint of the church, a usage parallelled by other charters in the same archive.

Wilhelm Levison, writing in 1946, was sceptical about the authenticity of this charter. He felt that the two separate addresses were incongruous, suggesting that the first address, occurring before the preamble, may have been inserted by someone familiar with Bede to echo Eadbald&#x27;s future conversion (see below). A more recent and more positive appraisal by John Morris argues that the charter and its witness list are authentic because they incorporate titles and phraseology that had fallen out of use by 800.

Æthelberht built Justus a cathedral church in Rochester; the foundations of a nave and chancel partly underneath the present-day Rochester Cathedral may date from that time. What remains of the foundations of an early rectangular building near the southern part of the current cathedral might also be contemporary with Justus or may be part of a Roman building.

Together with Mellitus, the bishop of London, Justus signed a letter written by Archbishop Laurence of Canterbury to the Irish bishops urging the native Celtic church to adopt the Roman method of calculating the date of Easter (the &quot;computus&quot;). This letter also mentioned the fact that Irish missionaries, such as Dagan, had refused to share meals with the missionaries. Although the letter has not survived, Bede quoted from parts of it.

In 614, Justus attended the Council of Paris, held by the Frankish king, Chlothar II. It is unclear why Justus and Peter, the abbot of Sts Peter and Paul in Canterbury, were present. It may have been just chance, but the historian James Campbell has suggested that Chlothar summoned clergy from Britain to attend in an attempt to assert overlordship over Kent. N. J. Higham offers another explanation for their attendance, arguing that Æthelberht sent the pair to the council because of shifts in Frankish policy towards the Kentish kingdom, which threatened Kentish independence, and that the two clergymen were sent to negotiate a compromise with Chlothar.

A pagan backlash against Christianity followed Æthelberht&#x27;s death in 616, forcing Justus and Mellitus to flee to Gaul. The pair probably took refuge with Chlothar, hoping that the Frankish king would intervene and restore them to their sees, and by 617 Justus had been reinstalled in his bishopric by the new king. Mellitus also returned to England, but the prevailing pagan mood did not allow him to return to London; after Laurence&#x27;s death, Mellitus became Archbishop of Canterbury. According to Bede, Justus received letters of encouragement from Pope Boniface V (r. 619–625), as did Mellitus, although Bede does not record the actual letters—the historian J. M. Wallace-Hadrill assumes both letters were general statements encouraging the missionaries.

==Archbishop==
Justus became Archbishop of Canterbury in 624, receiving his pallium—the symbol of the jurisdiction entrusted to archbishops—from Pope Boniface V, following which Justus consecrated Romanus as his successor at Rochester. Boniface also gave Justus a letter congratulating him on the conversion of King &quot;Aduluald&quot; (probably King Eadbald of Kent), a letter which is included in Bede&#x27;s &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot;. Bede&#x27;s account of Eadbald&#x27;s conversion states that it was Laurence, Justus&#x27;s predecessor at Canterbury, who converted the king to Christianity, but D. P. Kirby argues that the letter&#x27;s reference to Eadbald makes it likely that it was Justus. Other historians, including Barbara Yorke and Henry Mayr-Harting, conclude that Bede&#x27;s account is correct, and that Eadbald was converted by Laurence. Yorke argues that there were two kings of Kent during Eadbald&#x27;s reign, Eadbald and Æthelwald, and that Æthelwald was the &quot;Aduluald&quot; referred to by Boniface. Yorke argues that Justus converted Æthelwald back to Christianity after Æthelberht&#x27;s death.

Justus consecrated Paulinus as the first bishop of York, before the latter accompanied Æthelburg of Kent to Northumbria for her marriage to King Edwin of Northumbria. Bede records Justus as having died on 10 November, but does not give a year, although it is likely to have between 627 and 631. After his death, Justus was regarded as a saint, and was given a feast day on 10 November. The 9th-century Stowe Missal commemorates his feast day, along with Mellitus and Laurence. In the 1090s, his remains were translated, or ritually moved, to a shrine beside the high altar of St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey in Canterbury. At about the same time, a &quot;Life&quot; was written about him by Goscelin, as well as a poem by Reginald of Canterbury. Other material from Thomas of Elmham, Gervase of Canterbury, and William of Malmesbury, later medieval chroniclers, adds little to Bede&#x27;s account of Justus&#x27;s life.

<doc id="16426" wikidata="Q273223" url="?curid=16426" title="John Eccles (neurophysiologist)">
<text>Sir John Carew Eccles (27 January 1903 – 2 May 1997) was an Australian neurophysiologist and philosopher who won the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on the synapse. He shared the prize with Andrew Huxley and Alan Lloyd Hodgkin.

==Life and work==

===Early life===
Eccles was born in Melbourne, Australia. He grew up there with his two sisters and his parents: William and Mary Carew Eccles (both teachers, who home schooled him until he was 12). He initially attended Warrnambool High School (now Warrnambool College) (where a science wing is named in his honour), then completed his final year of schooling at Melbourne High School. Aged 17, he was awarded a senior scholarship to study medicine at the University of Melbourne. As a medical undergraduate, he was never able to find a satisfactory explanation for the interaction of mind and body; he started to think about becoming a neuroscientist. He graduated (with first class honours) in 1925, and was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study under Charles Scott Sherrington at Magdalen College, Oxford University, where he received his Doctor of Philosophy in 1929.

In 1937 Eccles returned to Australia, where he worked on military research during World War II. During this time, Eccles was the director of the Kanematsu Institute at Sydney Medical School, where he and Bernard Katz gave research lectures at the University of Sydney, strongly influencing the intellectual environment of the university. After the war, he became a professor at the University of Otago in New Zealand. From 1952 to 1962, he worked as a professor at the John Curtin School of Medical Research (JCSMR) of the Australian National University. From 1966 to 1968, Eccles worked at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago.

===Career===

In the early 1950s, Eccles and his colleagues performed the research that would lead to his receiving the Nobel Prize. To study synapses in the peripheral nervous system, Eccles and colleagues used the stretch reflex as a model, which is easily studied because it consists of only two neurones: a sensory neurone (the muscle spindle fibre) and the motor neurone. The sensory neurone synapses onto the motor neurone in the spinal cord. When a current is passed into the sensory neurone in the quadriceps, the motor neurone innervating the quadriceps produced a small excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). When a similar current is passed through the hamstring, the opposing muscle to the quadriceps, an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) is produced in the quadriceps motor neurone. Although a single EPSP was not enough to fire an action potential in the motor neurone, the sum of several EPSPs from multiple sensory neurones synapsing onto the motor neurone can cause the motor neurone to fire, thus contracting the quadriceps. On the other hand, IPSPs could subtract from this sum of EPSPs, preventing the motor neurone from firing.

Apart from these seminal experiments, Eccles was key to a number of important developments in neuroscience. Until around 1949, Eccles believed that synaptic transmission was primarily electrical rather than chemical. Although he was wrong in this hypothesis, his arguments led him and others to perform some of the experiments which proved chemical synaptic transmission. Bernard Katz and Eccles worked together on some of the experiments which elucidated the role of acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter in the brain.

===Honours===
He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in 1958 in recognition of services to physiological research.

He won the Australian of the Year Award in 1963, the same year he won the Nobel Prize.

In 1964, he became an honorary member to the American Philosophical Society, and in 1966 he moved to the United States to work as a professor at the Institute for Biomedical Research at the Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Unhappy with the working conditions there, he left to become a professor at The State University of New York at Buffalo from 1968 until he retired in 1975. After retirement, he moved to Switzerland and wrote on the mind–body problem.

In 1981, Eccles became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.

In 1990 he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in recognition of service to science, particularly in the field of neurophysiology. He died at the age of 94 in 1997 in Tenero-Contra, Locarno, Switzerland.

In March 2012, the Eccles Institute of Neuroscience was constructed in a new wing of the John Curtin School of Medical Research, with the assistance of a $63M grant from the Commonwealth Government. In 2021, a new $60M animal research building was opened at the University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand, and named the Eccles Building.

==Philosophy==
In &quot;The Understanding of the Brain&quot; (1973), Eccles summarises his philosophy: &quot;Now before discussing brain function in detail I will at the beginning give an account of my philosophical position on the so-called &#x27;brain-mind problem&#x27; so that you will be able to relate the experimental evidence to this philosophical position. I have written at length on this philosophy in my book &quot;Facing Reality&quot;. In Fig. 6-1 you will be able to see that I fully accept the recent philosophical achievements of Sir Karl Popper with his concept of three worlds. I was a dualist, now I am a trialist! Cartesian dualism has become unfashionable with many people. They embrace monism to escape the enigma of brain-mind interaction with its perplexing problems. But Sir Karl Popper and I are interactionists, and what is more, &quot;trialist interactionists&quot;! The three worlds are very easily defined. I believe that in the classification of Fig. 6-1 there is nothing left out. It takes care of everything that is in existence and in our experience. All can be classified in one or other of the categories enumerated under Worlds 1, 2 and 3.

Fig. 6-1, Three Worlds
&quot;In Fig. 6-1, World 1 is the world of physical objects and states. It comprises the whole cosmos of matter and energy, all of biology including human brains, and all artifacts that man has made for coding information, as for example, the paper and ink of books or the material base of works of art. World 1 is the total world of the materialists. They recognise nothing else. All else is fantasy.

&quot;World 2 is the world of states of consciousness and subjective knowledge of all kinds. The totality of our perceptions comes in this world. But there are several levels. In agreement with Polten, I tend to recognise three kinds of levels of World 2, as indicated in Fig. 6-2, but it may be more correct to think of it as a spectrum.

FIG. 6-2, World of Consciousness
&quot;The first level (outer sense) would be the ordinary perceptions provided by all our sense organs, hearing and touch and sight and smell and pain. All of these perceptions are in World 2, of course: vision with light and colour; sound with music and harmony; touch with all its qualities and vibration; the range of odours and tastes, and so on. These qualities do not exist in World 1, where correspondingly there are but electromagnetic waves, pressure waves in the atmosphere, material objects, and chemical substances.

&quot;In addition there is a level of &quot;inner sense&quot;, which is the world of more subtle perceptions. It is the world of your emotions, of your feelings of joy and sadness and fear and anger and so on. It includes all your memory, and all your imaginings and planning into the future. In fact there is a whole range of levels which could be described at length. All the subtle experiences of the human person are in this inner sensory world. It is all private to you but you can reveal it in linguistic expression, and by gestures of all levels of subtlety.

&quot;Finally, at the core of World 2 there is the &quot;self&quot; or &quot;pure ego&quot;, which is the basis of our unity as an experiencing being throughout our whole lifetime.

&quot;This World 2 is our &quot;primary reality&quot;. Our conscious experiences are the basis of our knowledge of World 1, which is thus a world of &quot;secondary reality&quot;, a derivative world. Whenever I am doing a scientific experiment, for example, I have to plan it cognitively, all in my thoughts, and then consciously carry out my plan of action in the experiment. Finally I have to look at the results and evaluate them in thought. For example, I have to see the traces of the oscilloscope and their photographic records or hear the signals on the loudspeaker. The various signals from the recording equipment have to be received by my sense organs, transmitted to my brain, and so to my consciousness, then appropriately measured and compared before I can begin to think about the significance of the experimental results. We are all the time, in every action we do, incessantly playing backwards and forwards between World 1 and World 2.

&quot;And what is World 3? As shown in Fig. 6-1 it is the whole world of culture. It is the world that was created by man and that reciprocally made man. This is my message in which I follow Popper unreservedly. The whole of language is here. All our means of communication, all our intellectual efforts coded in books, coded in the artistic and technological treasures in the museums, coded in every artefact left by man from primitive times—this is World 3 right up to the present time. It is the world of civilisation and culture. Education is the means whereby each human being is brought into relation with World 3. In this manner he becomes immersed in it throughout life, participating in the heritage of mankind and so becoming fully human. World 3 is the world that uniquely relates to man. It is the world which is completely unknown to animals. They are blind to all of World 3. I say that without any reservations. This is then the first part of my story.

&quot;Now I come to consider the way in which the three worlds interact...&quot;

Despite these words, in his late book &quot;How the Self Controls Its Brain&quot;, Eccles proposed a dualistic mechanism of mind.

==Personal life and death==
Eccles had nine children. Eccles married Irene Miller Eccles (1904-2002) in 1928 and divorced in 1968. After his divorce in 1968, Eccles married Helena Táboríková; a fellow neuropsychologist and M.D. of Charles University. The two often collaborated in research and they remained married until his death. Eccles died on 2 May 1997 in his home of Contra, Switzerland. He was buried in Contra, Switzerland.

<doc id="16427" wikidata="Q10305110" url="?curid=16427" title="James Scarlett, 1st Baron Abinger">
<text>James Scarlett, 1st Baron Abinger, (13 December 1769 – 17 April 1844) was a British lawyer, politician and judge.

==Early life==
James Scarlett was born in the British colony of Jamaica, where his father, Robert Scarlett, owned slave plantations. In the summer of 1785 he was sent to England to complete his education at Hawkshead Grammar School and afterwards at Trinity College, Cambridge, taking his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1789. Having entered the Inner Temple he took the advice of Samuel Romilly, studied law on his own for a year, and then was taught by George Wood. He was called to the bar in 1791, and joined the northern circuit and the Lancashire sessions.

==Legal and political career==
Though Scarlett had no professional connections, he gradually obtained a large practice, ultimately confining himself to the Court of King&#x27;s Bench and the northern circuit. He took silk in 1816, and from this time till the close of 1834 he was the most successful lawyer at the bar; he was particularly effective before a jury, and his income reached £18,500, a large sum for that period. He first entered parliament in 1819 as Whig member for Peterborough, representing that constituency with a short break (1822–1823) till 1830, when he was elected for the borough of Malton. He became Attorney General, and was made a Knight Bachelor when Canning formed his ministry in 1827; and though he resigned when the Duke of Wellington came into power in 1828, he resumed office in 1829 and went out with the Duke in 1830.

His opposition to the Reform Bill caused him to leave the Whigs and join the Tories, and he was elected, first for Cockermouth in 1831 and then in 1832 for Norwich, for which he sat until the dissolution of parliament in 1835. He was appointed Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer in 1834, and presided in that court for more than nine years. He was appointed to the Privy Council at the end of that year. He was raised to the peerage as Baron Abinger, &quot;of Abinger in the County of Surrey and of the City of Norwich&quot; in 1835, taking his title from the Surrey estate he had bought in 1813. The qualities which brought him success at the bar were not equalled on the bench; he had a reputation for unfairness, and complaints were made about his domineering attitude towards juries.

While he was studying in England, he became the guardian of Edward Moulton, who later assumed his mother&#x27;s family name, and became the father of the poet Elizabeth Barrett, later Elizabeth Barrett Browning. The Scarletts and the Barretts had been friends for many years in Jamaica, and it seems natural that James Scarlett would have been selected to keep an eye on young Moulton, while the boy was at school in England. In a note prefixed to the &quot;Collected Edition&quot; of his wife&#x27;s poems, Robert Browning tells us that &quot;On the early death of his father, he (Edward Moulton) was brought from Jamaica to England when a very young child, as ward to the late Chief Baron Lord Abinger, then Mr. Scarlett, whom he frequently accompanied in his post-chaise when on pursuit.&quot;

==Family==
Lord Abinger was twice married (the second time only six months before his death), and by his first wife (d. 1829) had three sons and two daughters, the title passing to his eldest son, Robert. His second son was General Sir James Yorke Scarlett, leader of the heavy cavalry charge at Balaklava. His third son, Peter Campbell Scarlett, was a diplomat. His elder daughter, Mary, married John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell, and was herself created Baroness Stratheden. Sir William Anglin Scarlett, Lord Abinger&#x27;s younger brother, was chief justice of Jamaica. While attending the Norfolk circuit on 2 April, Lord Abinger was suddenly seized with apoplexy, and died in his lodgings at Bury St Edmunds.

A more distant relation was the painter John Scarlett Davis.

==Cases==
*&quot;Fouldes v. Willoughby&quot; (1841)

== Property ==
In 1836, Scarlett was awarded compensation of £626 2s 2d for 30 slaves on the Spring Grove estate in Manchester, Jamaica.

<doc id="16429" wikidata="Q4095768" url="?curid=16429" title="Jewish views on marriage">
<text>Marriage in Judaism is the documentation of a contract between a Jewish man and a Jewish woman. Because marriage under Jewish law is essentially a private contractual agreement between a man and a woman, it does not require the presence of a rabbi or any other religious official. It is common, however, for rabbis to officiate and there are rules governing the process of betrothal and consecration.

Non-Orthodox developments have brought changes in who may marry whom. Intermarriage is often discouraged, though opinions vary.

In Judaism, a marriage can end either because of a divorce document given by the man to his wife, or by the death of either party. Certain details, primarily as protections for the wife, were added in Talmudic times.

==Overview==
===Historic view===
In traditional Judaism, marriage is viewed as a contractual bond commanded by God in which a Jewish man and a Jewish woman come together to create a relationship in which God is directly involved. Though procreation is not the sole purpose, a Jewish marriage is traditionally expected to fulfil the commandment to have children. In this view, marriage is understood to mean that the husband and wife are merging into a single soul, which is why a man is considered &quot;incomplete&quot; if he is not married, as his soul is only one part of a larger whole that remains to be unified.

===Recent non-Orthodox views===
Non-Orthodox Jewish denominations, such as Reconstructionist, Reform, and Conservative Judaism, recognize same-sex marriage, and de-emphasize procreation, focusing on marriage as a bond between a couple.

== Betrothal and marriage ==

In Jewish law, marriage consists of two separate acts, called or , which is the betrothal ceremony, and or , the actual Jewish wedding ceremony. changes the couple&#x27;s personal circumstances, while brings about the legal consequences of the change of circumstances. In Talmudic times, these two ceremonies usually took place up to a year apart; the bride lived with her parents until the actual marriage ceremony (), which would take place in a room or tent that the groom had set up for her. Since the Middle Ages the two ceremonies have taken place as a combined ceremony performed in public.

In Ancient Judaism a marriage could be established in three ways: money, contract, or sexual intercourse.

According to the Talmud, involves the groom handing an object to the bride – either an object of value such as a ring, or a document stating that she is being betrothed to him. In order to be valid, this must be done in the presence of two unrelated male witnesses. After , the laws of adultery apply, and the marriage cannot be dissolved without a religious divorce. After , the couple may live together.

The act of may be made by the intending parties or by their respective parents or other relatives on their behalf with their consent. A man and a woman cannot be betrothed to one another without agency and consent. The act is formalized in a document known as the , the &quot;Document of Conditions&quot; which is read prior to the . After the reading, the mothers of the future bride and groom break a plate. Today, some sign the contract on the day of the wedding, some do it as an earlier ceremony, and some do not do it at all. It should also be emphasized that this practice is not explicitly mentioned in the Hebrew Bible.

In Haredi communities, marriages may be arranged by the parents of the prospective bride and groom, who may arrange a by engaging a professional match-maker () who finds and introduces the prospective bride and groom and receives a fee for their services. The young couple is not forced to marry if either does not accept the other.

== Matrimony ==

=== Marital harmony ===

Marital harmony, known as (), is valued in Jewish tradition. The Talmud states that a man should love his wife as much as he loves himself, and honour her more than he honours himself; indeed, one who honours his wife was said, by the classical rabbis, to be rewarded with wealth. Similarly, a husband was expected to discuss with his wife any worldly matters that might arise in his life. The Talmud forbids a husband from being overbearing to his household, and domestic abuse by him was also condemned. It was said of a wife that &quot;God counts her tears&quot;.

As for the wife, the greatest praise the Talmudic rabbis offered to any woman was that given to a wife who fulfils the wishes of her husband; to this end, an early midrash states that a wife should not leave the home &quot;too frequently&quot;. A wife, also, was expected to be modest, even when alone with her husband. God&#x27;s presence dwells in a pure and loving home.

=== Conjugal rights and obligations ===
Marriage obligations and rights in Judaism are ultimately based on those apparent in the Bible, which have been clarified, defined, and expanded on by many prominent rabbinic authorities throughout history.

Traditionally, the obligations of the husband include providing for his wife. He is obligated to provide for her sustenance for her benefit; in exchange, he is also entitled to her income. However, this is a right to the wife, and she can release her husband of the obligation of sustaining her, and she can then keep her income exclusively for herself. The document that provides for this is the .

The Bible itself gives the wife protections, as per Exodus 21:10, although the rabbis may have added others later. The rights of the husband and wife are described in tractate in the Talmud, which explains how the rabbis balanced the two sets of rights of the wife and the husband.

According to the non-traditional view, in the Bible the wife is treated as a possession owned by her husband, but later Judaism imposed several obligations on the husband, effectively giving the wife several rights and freedoms; indeed, being a Jewish wife was often a more favourable situation than being a wife in many other cultures. For example, the Talmud establishes the principle that a wife is entitled, but not compelled, to the same dignity and social standing as her husband, and is entitled to keep any additional advantages she had as a result of her social status before her marriage.

==== In the Bible ====
Biblical Hebrew has two words for &quot;husband&quot;: (also meaning &quot;master&quot;), and (also meaning &quot;man&quot;, parallel to meaning &quot;woman&quot; or &quot;wife&quot;). The words are contrasted in Hosea 2:16, where God speaks to Israel as though it is his wife: &quot;On that day, says the Lord, you will call [me] &#x27;my husband&#x27; (), and will no longer call me &#x27;my master&#x27; ().&quot;

Early nomadic communities practised a form of marriage known as , in which a wife would own a tent of her own, within which she retains complete independence from her husband; this principle appears to survive in parts of early Israelite society, as some early passages of the Bible appear to portray certain wives as each owning a tent as a personal possession (specifically, Jael, Sarah, and Jacob&#x27;s wives). In later times, the Bible describes wives as being given the innermost room(s) of the husband&#x27;s house, as her own private area to which men were not permitted; in the case of wealthy husbands, the Bible describes their wives as having each been given an entire house for this purpose.

It was not, however, a life of complete freedom. The descriptions of the Bible suggest that a wife was expected to perform certain household tasks: spinning, sewing, weaving, manufacture of clothing, fetching of water, baking of bread, and animal husbandry. The Book of Proverbs contains an entire acrostic about the duties which would be performed by a virtuous wife.

The husband, too, is indirectly implied to have responsibilities to his wife. The Torah obligates a man to not deprive his wife of food, clothing, or of sexual activity (); if the husband does not provide the first wife with these things, she is to be divorced, without cost to her. The Talmud interprets this as a requirement for a man to provide food and clothing to, and have sex with, each of his wives, even if he only has one.

As a society, the Israelites did not have any laws which imposed monogamy on men. Adulterous married and betrothed women, as well as their male accomplices, were subject to the death penalty by the biblical laws against adultery. According to the Book of Numbers, if a woman was suspected of adultery, she was to be subjected to the ordeal of the bitter water, a form of trial by ordeal, but one that took a miracle to convict. The literary prophets indicate that adultery was a frequent occurrence, despite their strong protests against it, and these legal strictnesses.

==== In the Talmud and Rabbinic Judaism ====
The Talmud sets a minimum provision which a husband must provide to his wife:
* Enough bread for at least two meals a day
* Sufficient oil for cooking and for lighting purposes
* Sufficient wood for cooking
* Fruit and vegetables
* Wine, if it is customary in the locality for women to drink it
* Three meals on each shabbat consisting of fish and meat
* An allowance of a silver coin (Hebrew: ) each week

Rabbinic courts could compel the husband to make this provision, if he fails to do so voluntarily. The Chatam Sofer, a prominent 19th century halachic decisor, argued that if a man could not provide his wife with this minimum, he should be compelled to divorce her; other Jewish rabbis argued that a man should be compelled to hire himself out, as a day-labourer, if he cannot otherwise make this provision to his wife.

According to prominent Jewish writers of the Middle Ages, if a man is absent from his wife for a long period, the wife should be allowed to sell her husband&#x27;s property, if necessary to sustain herself. Similarly, they argued that if a wife had to take out a loan to pay for her sustenance during such absence, her husband had to pay the debt on his return.

In order to offset the husband&#x27;s duty to support his wife, she was required by the Talmud to surrender all her earnings to her husband, together with any profit she makes by accident, and the right of usufruct on her property; the wife was not required to do this if she wished to support herself. Although the wife always retained ownership of her property itself, if she died while still married to her husband, he was to be her heir, according to the opinion of the Talmud; this principle, though, was modified, in various ways, by the rabbis of the Middle Ages.

===== Home and household =====
In Jewish tradition, the husband was expected to provide a home for his wife, furnished in accordance to local custom and appropriate to his status; the marital couple were expected to live together in this home, although if the husband&#x27;s choice of work made it difficult to do so, the Talmud excuses him from the obligation. Traditionally, if the husband changed his usual abode, the wife was considered to have a duty to move with him. In the Middle Ages, it was argued that if a person continued to refuse to live with their spouse, the spouse in question had sufficient grounds for divorce.

Most Jewish religious authorities held that a husband must allow his wife to eat at the same table as him, even if he gave his wife enough money to provide for herself. By contrast, if a husband mistreated his wife, or lived in a disreputable neighbourhood, the Jewish religious authorities would permit the wife to move to another home elsewhere, and would compel the husband to finance her life there.

Expanding on the household tasks which the Bible implies a wife should undertake, rabbinic literature requires her to perform all the housework (such as baking, cooking, washing, caring for her children, etc.), unless her marriage had given the husband a large dowry; in the latter situation, the wife was expected only to tend to &quot;affectionate&quot; tasks, such as making his bed and serving him his food. Jewish tradition expected the husband to provide the bed linen and kitchen utensils. If the wife had young twin children, the Talmud made her husband responsible for caring for one of them.

===== Clothing =====
The Talmud elaborates on the biblical requirement of the husband to provide his wife with clothing, by insisting that each year he must provide each wife with 50 zuzim&#x27;s-worth of clothing, including garments appropriate to each season of the year. The Talmudic rabbis insist that this annual clothing gift should include one hat, one belt, and three pairs of shoes (one pair for each of the three main annual festivals: Passover, Shabu&#x27;ot, and Sukkoth). The husband was also expected by the classical rabbis to provide his wife with jewelry and perfumes if he lived in an area where this was customary.

===== Physical obligations =====
The Talmud argues that a husband is responsible for the protection of his wife&#x27;s body. If his wife became ill, then he would be compelled, by the Talmud, to defray any medical expense which might be incurred in relation to this; the Talmud requires him to ensure that the wife receives care. Although he technically had the right to divorce his wife, enabling him to avoid paying for her medical costs, several prominent rabbis throughout history condemned such a course of action as inhuman behaviour, even if the wife was suffering from a prolonged illness.

If the wife dies, even if not due to illness, the Talmud&#x27;s stipulations require the husband to arrange, and pay for, her burial; the burial must, in the opinion of the Talmud, be one conducted in a manner befitting the husband&#x27;s social status, and in accordance with the local custom. Prominent rabbis of the Middle Ages clarified this, stating that the husband must make any provisions required by local burial customs, potentially including the hiring of mourners and the erection of a tombstone. According to the Talmud, and later rabbinic writers, if the husband was absent, or refused to do these things, a rabbinical court should arrange the wife&#x27;s funeral, selling some of the husband&#x27;s property in order to defray the costs.

If the wife was captured, the husband was required by the Talmud and later writers to pay the ransom demanded for her release; there is some debate whether the husband was required only to pay up to the wife&#x27;s market value as a slave, or whether he must pay any ransom, even to the point of having to sell his possessions to raise the funds. If the husband and wife were both taken captive, the historic Jewish view was that the rabbinic courts should first pay the ransom for the wife, selling some of the husband&#x27;s property in order to raise the funds.

===== Fidelity =====
In the classical era of the rabbinic scholars, the death penalty for adultery was rarely applied. It forbids conviction if:
* the woman had been raped, rather than consenting to the crime;
* the woman had mistaken the paramour for her husband;
* the woman was unaware of the laws against adultery before she committed the crime;
* the woman had not been properly warned. This requires that the two witnesses testifying against her warn her that the Torah prohibits adultery; that the penalty for adultery is death; and that she immediately responded that she is doing so with full knowledge of those facts. Even if she was warned, but did not acknowledge those facts immediately upon hearing them, and immediately before doing the act, she is not put to death. These conditions apply in all death-penalty convictions.

These rules made it practically impossible to convict any woman of adultery; in nearly every case, women were acquitted. However, due to the belief that a priest should be untainted, a Kohen was compelled to divorce his wife if she had been raped.

In Talmudic times, once the death penalty was no longer enforced for any crime, even when a woman was convicted, the punishment was comparatively mild: adulteresses were flogged instead. Nevertheless, the husbands of convicted adulteresses were not permitted by the Talmud to forgive their guilty wives, instead being compelled to divorce them; according to Maimonides, a conviction for adultery nullified any right that the wife&#x27;s marriage contract (Hebrew: ) gave her to a compensation payment for being divorced. Once divorced, an adulteress was not permitted, according to the Talmudic writers, to marry her paramour.

As for men who committed adultery (with another man&#x27;s wife), Abba ben Joseph and Abba Arika are both quoted in the Talmud as expressing abhorrence, and arguing that such men would be condemned to Gehenna.

===== Family purity =====

The laws of &quot;family purity&quot; () are considered an important part of an Orthodox Jewish marriage, and adherence to them is (in Orthodox Judaism) regarded as a prerequisite of marriage. This involves observance of the various details of the menstrual laws. Orthodox brides and grooms attend classes on this subject prior to the wedding. The niddah laws are regarded as an intrinsic part of marital life (rather than just associated with women). Together with a few other rules, including those about the ejaculation of semen, these are collectively termed &quot;family purity&quot;.

===== Sexual relations =====
In marriage, conjugal relations are guaranteed as a fundamental right for a woman, along with food and clothing. This obligation is known as . Sex within marriage is the woman&#x27;s right, and the man&#x27;s duty. The husband is forbidden from raping his wife, they are not to be intimate while drunk or while either party is angry at the other. A woman should be granted a (divorce) if she seeks it because her husband is disgusting or loathsome to her. If either partner consistently refuses to participate, that person is considered rebellious, and the other spouse can sue for divorce. A very large number of Jewish texts attempting to regulate marital sexuality exist. This category can vary: it can mean a few biblical verse, chapters in medieval books of law, or self-standing modern traditional Jewish guides to marital sexuality. One should always remember that the fact a certain activity is recommended or forbidden, does not mean that in reality the advice is followed. We can know what generally traditional Jews were told to do or not to do in their bedrooms. We can very rarely know what actually happened.

== Age of marriage ==

Citing the primacy of the divine command given in Genesis 1:28, the time between puberty and age twenty has been considered the ideal time for men and women to be wed in traditional Jewish thought. Some rabbis have gone further to commend the age of eighteen as most ideal, while others have advocated for the time immediately following puberty, closer to the age of fourteen, essentially &quot;as early in life as possible.&quot; Babylonian rabbis understood marriage as God&#x27;s means of keeping male sexuality from going out of control, so they advocated for early marriage to prevent men from succumbing to temptation in their youth. The ḳeṭannah (children aged three to twelve) might be given in marriage by her father, and the marriage was valid, necessitating a formal divorce if separation was desired. Some commended early marriage for its benefits: Rabbi Ḥisda maintained that early marriage could lead to increased intelligence.

A large age gap between spouses, in either direction, is advised against as unwise. A younger woman marrying a significantly older man however is especially problematic: marrying one&#x27;s young daughter to an old man was declared as reprehensible as forcing her into prostitution. Moreover, it is problematic for an older man to be unmarried in the first place. Marriage is held to be uniquely mandatory for men, and an unmarried man over the age of twenty is considered &quot;cursed by God Himself.&quot;

There is evidence however that in some communities males did not marry until &quot;thirty or older.&quot; In medieval Jewish Ashkenazi communities, women continued to be married young. Since the Enlightenment, young marriage has become rarer among Jewish communities.

=== Consent ===
According to the Talmud, a father is commanded not to marry his daughter to anyone until she grows up and says, &quot;I want this one&quot;. A marriage that takes place without the consent of the girl is not an effective legal marriage.

A (literally meaning &quot;little [one]&quot;) was any girl between the age of 3 years and that of 12 years plus one day; she was subject to her father&#x27;s authority, and he could arrange a marriage for her without her agreement. However, after reaching the age of maturity, she would have to agree to the marriage to be considered as married. If the father was dead or missing, the brothers of the , collectively, had the right to arrange a marriage for her, as had her mother. In these situations, a would always have the right to annul her marriage, even if it was the first.

If the marriage did end (due to divorce or the husband&#x27;s death), any further marriages were optional; the retained her right to annul them. The choice of a to annul a marriage, known in Hebrew as (literally meaning &quot;refusal&quot;, &quot;denial&quot;, &quot;protest&quot;), led to a true annulment, not a divorce; a divorce document () was not necessary, and a who did this was not regarded by legal regulations as a divorcee, in relation to the marriage. Unlike divorce, was regarded with distaste by many rabbinic writers, even in the Talmud; in earlier classical Judaism, one major faction – the House of Shammai – argued that such annulment rights only existed during the betrothal (not engagement) period () and not once the actual marriage () had begun.

== Intermarriage ==
Rates of marriage between Jews and non-Jews have increased in countries other than Israel (the Jewish diaspora). According to the National Jewish Population Survey 2000-01, 47% of marriages involving Jews in the United States between 1996 and 2001 were with non-Jewish partners. Jewish leaders in different branches generally agree that possible assimilation is a crisis, but they differ on the proper response to intermarriage.

===Attitudes===

* All branches of Orthodox Judaism do not sanction the validity or legitimacy of intermarriages.Orthodox teachings view marriage between a Jewish man and woman as a reunion of two halves of the same soul, thus a Jewish man to have any relationship with a &quot;Shiksa&quot; (gentile woman) or a Jewish woman to have any relationship with a goy (gentile man) would be considered a disgrace. Some Orthodox families observe shiva (mourning rites) for relatives who marry outside the faith, symbolically mourning the potential loss of future generations who may not be raised as Jewish. Intermarriage is sometimes referred to in Orthodox circles as the &quot;Silent Holocaust (Judaism).&quot; The only legal way for children of such relationships to be part of a Jewish community, is for them of their own free will to willingly accept the Iron Yoke of the Torah with help from Orthodox Jewish guidance.
* Conservative Judaism does not sanction intermarriage, but encourages acceptance of the non-Jewish spouse within the family, hoping that such acceptance will lead to conversion.
* Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism permit total personal autonomy in interpretation of Jewish Law, and intermarriage is not forbidden. Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis are free to take their own approach to performing marriages between a Jewish and non-Jewish partner. Many, but not all, seek agreement from the couple that the children will be raised as Jewish.

There are also differences between streams on what constitutes an intermarriage, arising from their differing criteria for being Jewish in the first place. Orthodox Jews only consider a child to be Jewish if the mother is of Jewish ancestry or has undergone a proper conversion as conducted by proper rabbinical authorities.

Among the general Jewish population in Israel, interfaith marriages are extremely rare; only about two percent were in an interfaith marriage. In addition, about 97 percent of Jews in the same Pew Research Center study, conducted in 2014-2015, did not approve of their child marrying a Muslim while 89 percent expressed similar views when asked about a hypothetical marriage to a Christian.

=== Interracial Marriage ===
Jewish prohibitions on marriage typically concern interfaith marriages. There is no historical prohibition of interracial marriage, nor is there explicit permission of such. However, debates around Numbers 12:1 suggest that Zipporah, the wife of Moses, is described as a &quot;Cushite woman&quot; to highlight a potentially much darker skin tone. Under modern social constructs, this would constitute Moses&#x27;s marriage as an interracial one. However, there is no concrete proof that the Cushite woman referred to in Numbers is the same Zipporah from Exodus.

== Marriage in Israel ==
In Israel, the only institutionalized form of Jewish marriage is the religious one, i.e., a marriage conducted under the auspices of the rabbinate. Specifically, marriage of Israeli Jews must be conducted according to Jewish Law (), as viewed by Orthodox Judaism. One consequence is that Jews in Israel who cannot marry according to Jewish law (e.g., a and a divorcée, or a Jew and one who is not halachically Jewish), cannot marry each other. This has led for calls, mostly from the secular segment of the Israeli public, for the institution of civil marriage.

Some secular-Jewish Israelis travel abroad to have civil marriages, either because they do not wish an Orthodox wedding or because their union cannot be sanctioned by . These marriages are legally recognized by the State, but are not recognized by the State Rabbinate.

Marriages performed in Israel must be carried out by religious authorities of an official religion (Judaism, Islam, Christianity, or Druze), unless both parties are without religion.

== Divorce ==

 (Jewish Law) allows for divorce. The document of divorce is termed a . The final divorce ceremony involves the husband giving the document into the hand of the wife or her agent, but the wife may sue in rabbinical court to initiate the divorce. In such a case, a husband may be compelled to give the , if he has violated any of his numerous obligations outlined in Jewish law and the couple&#x27;s specific &quot;ketubah&quot;; Historically, this was sometimes accomplished by beating and or monetary coercion. The rationale was that since he was required to divorce his wife due to his (or her) violations of the contract, his good inclination desires to divorce her, and the community helps him to do what he wants to do anyway. In this case, the wife may or may not be entitled to a payment.

Since around the 12th century, some officials within Judaism have recognized the right of a wife abused physically or psychologically to a forced divorce.

Conservative Judaism follows halacha, although differently than Orthodox Judaism. Reform Jews usually use an egalitarian form of the at their weddings. They generally do not issue Jewish divorces, seeing a civil divorce as both necessary and sufficient; however, some Reform rabbis encourage the couple to go through a Jewish divorce procedure. Orthodox Judaism does not recognize civil law as overriding religious law, and thus does not view a civil divorce as sufficient. Therefore, a man or woman may be considered divorced by the Reform Jewish community, but still married by the Conservative community. Orthodox Judaism usually does not recognize Reform weddings because according to Talmudic law, the witnesses to the marriage must be Jews who observe , which is believed by Orthodox authorities to seldom be the case in Reform weddings.

Traditionally, when a husband fled, or his whereabouts were unknown for any reason, the woman was considered an (literally &quot;an anchored woman&quot;), and was not allowed to remarry; in traditional Judaism, divorce can only be initiated by the husband. Prior to modern communication, the death of the husband while in a distant land was a common cause of this situation. In modern times, when a husband refuses to issue a due to money, property, or custody battles, the woman who cannot remarry is considered a , not an agunah. A man in this situation would not be termed a (literally, &quot;a refuser of a divorce document&quot;), unless a legitimate Beis Din had required him to issue a Get. The term is often used in such circumstances, but it is not technically accurate.

Within both the Conservative and Orthodox communities, there are efforts to avoid situations where a woman is not able to obtain a Jewish divorce from her husband. The serves this function in Conservative Judaism in order to prevent husbands from refusing to give their wives a divorce. To do this, the has built in provisions; so, if predetermined circumstances occur, the divorce goes into effect immediately. After the fact, various Jewish and secular legal methods are used to deal with such problems. None of the legal solutions addresses the problem in the case of a missing husband.

== Same-sex marriage ==

=== In Orthodox Judaism ===

Orthodox Judaism does not have a Jewish legal construct of same-gender marriage. While any two Jewish adults may be joined by a Jewish legal contract, the rites of are reserved for a union of a man and woman.

=== In Conservative Judaism ===
In June 2012, the American branch of Conservative Judaism formally approved same-sex marriage ceremonies in a 13–0 vote with one abstention.

=== In Reform Judaism ===
In 1996, the Central Conference of American Rabbis passed a resolution approving same-sex civil marriage. However, this same resolution made a distinction between civil marriages and religious marriages; this resolution thus stated:

In 1998, an ad hoc CCAR committee on human sexuality issued its majority report (11 to 1, 1 abstention) which stated that the holiness within a Jewish marriage &quot;may be present in committed same gender relationships between two Jews and that these relationships can serve as the foundation of stable Jewish families, thus adding strength to the Jewish community.&quot; The report called for CCAR to support rabbis in officiating at same-sex marriages. Also in 1998, the Responsa Committee of the CCAR issued a lengthy (rabbinical opinion) that offered detailed argumentation in support of both sides of the question whether a rabbi may officiate at a commitment ceremony for a same-sex couple.

In March 2000, CCAR issued a new resolution stating that &quot;We do hereby resolve that the relationship of a Jewish, same gender couple is worthy of affirmation through appropriate Jewish ritual, and further resolve, that we recognize the diversity of opinions within our ranks on this issue. We support the decision of those who choose to officiate at rituals of union for same-sex couples, and we support the decision of those who do not.&quot;

=== In Reconstructionist Judaism ===
The Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association (RRA) encourages its members to officiate at same-sex marriages, though it does not require it of them.

<text>Janusz Andrzej Zajdel (15 August 1938 – 19 July 1985) was a Polish science fiction author, second in popularity in Poland to Stanisław Lem. His major genres were social science fiction and dystopia. His main recurring theme involved the gloomy prospects for a space environment into which mankind carried totalitarian ideas and habits: Red Space Republics, or Space Labor Camps, or both. His heroes desperately try to find meaning in the world around them.

The Polish science fiction fandom award was named after him: the Janusz A. Zajdel Award. He was a trustee of World SF.

==Life==
Janusz Zajdel was born 15 August 1938 in Warsaw, Poland. He studied physics at the University of Warsaw. He was a member of the Union of Polish Youth and the Polish Students&#x27; Association. After graduating, he worked many years as a radiological engineer and an expert on nuclear physics at the Central Laboratory of Radiological Protection in Poland. He published a number of academic works, handbooks of safety regulations, as well as educational and popular science texts. In 1976 he joined the Polish Writers&#x27; Union.

In his spare time, he popularized science by writing science fiction. With his brother, he started a column in a Polish magazine for young people interested in science and engineering, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Young Technician&quot;), in which they proposed various futuristic gadgets. In 1961 &quot;Młody Technik&quot; published Zajdel&#x27;s science-fiction debut, the short story &quot;Tau Ceti&quot; (). Other stories by him soon appeared in several other Polish magazines.

His first book was published in 1965, a short-story anthology, &quot;Jad mantezji&quot; (&quot;The Venom of Mantesia&quot;), which included stories from &quot;Młody Technik&quot; and some others that had already appeared a year earlier in another anthology. By 1982 he had published four more collections: &quot;Przejście przez lustro&quot; (Through the Mirror, 1975); &quot;Iluzyt&quot; (1976); &quot;Feniks&quot; (The Phoenix, 1981); and &quot;Ogon diabła&quot; (The Devil&#x27;s Tail, 1982).

His first novel, &#x27;, appeared in 1966, a year after his first short-story anthology, and was geared toward young adults. His first serious science-fiction novel was a &quot;first contact&quot;-type SF mystery, &#x27; (Right of Return, 1975); but it was his novels of the late 1970s and early 1980s – &quot;Cylinder van Troffa&quot; (Van Troff&#x27;s Cylinder, 1980); &quot;Limes inferior&quot; (The Lower Limit, 1982); &quot;Cała prawda o planecie Ksi&quot; (The Whole Truth about Planet Xi, 1983); &quot;&quot; (Out of the Shadows, 1983); and &quot;Paradyzja&quot; (Paradise: World in Orbit, 1984) – that earned him a reputation as one of the most important Polish science-fiction writers.

He was an active member of Polish and international science fiction fandom, and a Trustee of World SF. In the 1980s he was an active supporter of the Polish Solidarity movement.

On 19 July 1985 he died of lung cancer, after three years&#x27; struggle against the disease.

==Themes==
Zajdel&#x27;s early works, from the 1960s and early 1970s, focuses on scientific inventions and their role in space exploration, alien contact or artificial intelligence. As his writing career continued, however, his stories evolved to focus on the social aspects and often negative consequences of those inventions. Over time, a theme became increasingly visible in his works - a concern over dangers inherent in attempts to control the human society. He is also condemning human ignorance, warning against xenophobia, and asking philosophical questions about the nature of the universe, happiness and human destiny. Zajdel&#x27;s works from his second period - late 1970s and 1980s - and represent the genres of social and dystopian fiction. In his works, he envisions totalitarian states and societies living under extreme forms of mass surveillance.

His works are also recognized as being a critique of the totalitarian, communist state, a reality of his life in People&#x27;s Republic of Poland. Science fiction genre, with its outer-worldly, clearly fictional, and often allegorical setting and invented jargon was able to debate fundamentals of such systems with frankness that more mainstream literature would not be allowed to.

==Importance==
Zajdel has been described as the second science fiction writer in popularity in Poland after Stanisław Lem. He has also been described as the writer who replaced Lem as the &quot;top Polish SF writer&quot;, after &quot;Lem vacated [this position] earlier of his own volition&quot;.

He is recognized as an originator of the social science fiction genre in Polish science fiction, known in Poland as the sociological speculative fiction (&quot;fantastyka socjologiczna&quot;). He has been an inspiration to a number of younger Polish science fiction authors such as Maciej Parowski and Marek Oramus.

His works have been translated into Belarusian, Bulgarian, Czech, Esperanto, Finnish, German, Hungarian, Russian and Slovenian. , the only work translated into English is the short story &quot;Wyjątkowo trudny teren&quot; (&quot;Particularly Difficult Territory&quot;) that Zajdel wrote for the English language &quot;Tales from the Planet Earth&quot; anthology edited by Frederik Pohl and Elizabeth Anne Hull.

==Recognition==
In 1973 Zajdel received an honorary award Magnum Trophaeum from the &quot;Młody Technik&quot; (&quot;Young Technician&quot;) magazine for long-term cooperation. In 1980 Zajdel received the Polish Ministry of Culture and Arts Best SF Book of the Year Award for &quot;Van Troff&#x27;s Cylinder&quot;. Zajdel also received the Golden Sepulka Award two times: for &quot;Limes Inferior&quot; (1982 novel; 1983 award) and &quot;Wyjście z cienia&quot; (&quot;Out of the Shadow&quot;) (1983 novel; 1984 award). He was awarded the Medal of Merit for National Defence for his educational film scripts. Winner of Śląkfa for 1984.

In 1984 Polish fantasy and science fiction fandom (associated with the Polish SF convention Polcon) decided to establish an annual award, initially named &quot;Sfinks&quot; (&quot;Sphynx&quot;). Janusz A. Zajdel became the first winner of this award, for his 1984 novel &quot;Paradyzja&quot;. He won the award posthumously in 1985, shortly after his death, at which time it was decided to rename the award after him, and it became known as the Janusz A. Zajdel Award.

Frederik Pohl dedicated the anthology &quot;Tales From The Planet Earth&quot; to Zajdel and A. Bertram Chandler.
