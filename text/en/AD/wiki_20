<text>Joseph Conrad (born Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski, ; 3 December 1857 – 3 August 1924) was a Polish-British novelist and story writer. He is regarded as one of the greatest writers in the English language and, although he did not speak English fluently until his twenties, he became a master prose stylist who brought a non-English sensibility into English literature. He wrote novels and stories, many in nautical settings, that depict crises of human individuality in the midst of what he saw as an indifferent, inscrutable, and amoral world.

Conrad is considered a literary impressionist by some and an early modernist by others, though his works also contain elements of 19th-century realism. His narrative style and anti-heroic characters, as in &quot;Lord Jim&quot;, for example, have influenced numerous authors. Many dramatic films have been adapted from and inspired by his works. Numerous writers and critics have commented that his fictional works, written largely in the first two decades of the 20th century, seem to have anticipated later world events.

Writing near the peak of the British Empire, Conrad drew on the national experiences of his native Poland—during nearly all his life, parcelled out among three occupying empires—and on his own experiences in the French and British merchant navies, to create short stories and novels that reflect aspects of a European-dominated world—including imperialism and colonialism—and that profoundly explore the human psyche.

==Life==
===Early years===

Conrad was born on 3 December 1857 in Berdychiv (), Ukraine, then part of the Russian Empire; the region had once been part of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. He was the only child of Apollo Korzeniowski—a writer, translator, political activist, and would-be revolutionary—and his wife Ewa Bobrowska. He was christened &quot;Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski&quot; after his maternal grandfather Józef, his paternal grandfather Teodor, and the heroes (both named &quot;Konrad&quot;) of two poems by Adam Mickiewicz, &quot;Dziady&quot; and &quot;Konrad Wallenrod&quot;. His family called him &quot;Konrad&quot;, rather than &quot;Józef&quot;.

Though the vast majority of the surrounding area&#x27;s inhabitants were Ukrainians, and the great majority of Berdychiv&#x27;s residents were Jewish, almost all the countryside was owned by the Polish &quot;szlachta&quot; (nobility), to which Conrad&#x27;s family belonged as bearers of the Nałęcz coat-of-arms. Polish literature, particularly patriotic literature, was held in high esteem by the area&#x27;s Polish population.

Poland had been divided among Prussia, Austria and Russia in 1795. The Korzeniowski family had played a significant role in Polish attempts to regain independence. Conrad&#x27;s paternal grandfather Teodor had served under Prince Józef Poniatowski during Napoleon&#x27;s Russian campaign and had formed his own cavalry squadron during the November 1830 Uprising of Poland-Lithuania against the Russian Empire. Conrad&#x27;s fiercely patriotic father Apollo belonged to the &quot;Red&quot; political faction, whose goal was to re-establish the pre-partition boundaries of Poland and that also advocated land reform and the abolition of serfdom. Conrad&#x27;s subsequent refusal to follow in Apollo&#x27;s footsteps, and his choice of exile over resistance, were a source of lifelong guilt for Conrad.

Because of the father&#x27;s attempts at farming and his political activism, the family moved repeatedly. In May 1861 they moved to Warsaw, where Apollo joined the resistance against the Russian Empire. He was arrested and imprisoned in Pavilion X – the dread Tenth Pavilion – of the Warsaw Citadel. Conrad would write: &quot;[I]n the courtyard of this Citadel—characteristically for our nation—my childhood memories begin.&quot; On 9 May 1862 Apollo and his family were exiled to Vologda, north of Moscow and known for its bad climate. In January 1863 Apollo&#x27;s sentence was commuted, and the family was sent to Chernihiv in northeast Ukraine, where conditions were much better. However, on 18 April 1865 Ewa died of tuberculosis.

Apollo did his best to teach Conrad at home. The boy&#x27;s early reading introduced him to the two elements that later dominated his life: in Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Toilers of the Sea&quot;, he encountered the sphere of activity to which he would devote his youth; Shakespeare brought him into the orbit of English literature. Most of all, though, he read Polish Romantic poetry. Half a century later he explained that 
&quot;The Polishness in my works comes from Mickiewicz and Słowacki. My father read [Mickiewicz&#x27;s] &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot; aloud to me and made me read it aloud... I used to prefer [Mickiewicz&#x27;s] &quot;Konrad Wallenrod&quot; [and] &quot;Grażyna&quot;. Later I preferred Słowacki. You know why Słowacki?... [He is the soul of all Poland]&quot;.

In the autumn of 1866 young Conrad was sent for a year-long retreat, for health reasons, to Kiev and his mother&#x27;s family estate at .

In December 1867 Apollo took his son to the Austrian-held part of Poland, which for two years had been enjoying considerable internal freedom and a degree of self-government. After sojourns in Lwów and several smaller localities, on 20 February 1869 they moved to Kraków (until 1596 the capital of Poland), likewise in Austrian Poland. A few months later, on 23 May 1869, Apollo Korzeniowski died, leaving Conrad orphaned at the age of eleven. Like Conrad&#x27;s mother, Apollo had been gravely ill with tuberculosis. 

The young Conrad was placed in the care of Ewa&#x27;s brother, Tadeusz Bobrowski. Conrad&#x27;s poor health and his unsatisfactory schoolwork caused his uncle constant problems and no end of financial outlay. Conrad was not a good student; despite tutoring, he excelled only in geography. At that time he likely received only private tutoring, as there is no evidence he attended any school regularly. Since the boy&#x27;s ill health was clearly of nervous origin, the physicians supposed that fresh air and physical work would harden him; his uncle hoped that well-defined duties and the rigors of work would teach him discipline. Since he showed little inclination to study, it was essential that he learn a trade; his uncle thought he could work as a sailor-cum-businessman, who would combine maritime skills with commercial activities. In the autumn of 1871, thirteen-year-old Conrad announced his intention to become a sailor. He later recalled that as a child he had read (apparently in French translation) Leopold McClintock&#x27;s book about his 1857–59 expeditions in the &quot;Fox&quot;, in search of Sir John Franklin&#x27;s lost ships &#x27; and &#x27;. Conrad also recalled having read books by the American James Fenimore Cooper and the English Captain Frederick Marryat. A playmate of his adolescence recalled that Conrad spun fantastic yarns, always set at sea, presented so realistically that listeners thought the action was happening before their eyes.

In August 1873 Bobrowski sent fifteen-year-old Conrad to Lwów to a cousin who ran a small boarding house for boys orphaned by the 1863 Uprising; group conversation there was in French. The owner&#x27;s daughter recalled:
Conrad had been at the establishment for just over a year when in September 1874, for uncertain reasons, his uncle removed him from school in Lwów and took him back to Kraków.

On 13 October 1874 Bobrowski sent the sixteen-year-old to Marseilles, France, for Conrad&#x27;s planned merchant-marine career on French merchant ships, providing him with a monthly stipend of 150 francs. Though Conrad had not completed secondary school, his accomplishments included fluency in French (with a correct accent), some knowledge of Latin, German and Greek; probably a good knowledge of history, some geography, and probably already an interest in physics. He was well read, particularly in Polish Romantic literature. He belonged to the second generation in his family that had had to earn a living outside the family estates. They were born and reared partly in the milieu of the working intelligentsia, a social class that was starting to play an important role in Central and Eastern Europe. He had absorbed enough of the history, culture and literature of his native land to be able eventually to develop a distinctive world view and make unique contributions to the literature of his adoptive Britain.

Tensions that originated in his childhood in Poland and increasing in his adulthood abroad contributed to Conrad&#x27;s greatest literary achievements. Zdzisław Najder, himself an emigrant from Poland, observed:
Some critics have suggested that when Conrad left Poland, he wanted to break once and for all with his Polish past. In refutation of this, Najder quotes from Conrad&#x27;s 14 August 1883 letter to family friend Stefan Buszczyński, written nine years after Conrad had left Poland:

===Merchant marine===

In Marseille Conrad had an intense social life, often stretching his budget. A trace of these years can be found in the northern Corsica town of Luri, where there is a plaque to a Corsican merchant seaman, Dominique Cervoni, whom Conrad befriended. Cervoni became the inspiration for some of Conrad&#x27;s characters, such as the title character of the 1904 novel &quot;Nostromo&quot;. Conrad visited Corsica with his wife in 1921, partly in search of connections with his long-dead friend and fellow merchant seaman.
In late 1877, Conrad&#x27;s maritime career was interrupted by the refusal of the Russian consul to provide documents needed for him to continue his service. As a result, Conrad fell into debt and, in March 1878, he attempted suicide. He survived, and received further financial aid from his uncle, allowing him to resume his normal life. After nearly four years in France and on French ships, Conrad joined the British merchant marine, enlisting in April 1878 (he had most likely started learning English shortly before).

For the next fifteen years, he served under the Red Ensign. He worked on a variety of ships as crew member (steward, apprentice, able seaman) and then as third, second and first mate, until eventually achieving captain&#x27;s rank. During the 19 years from the time that Conrad had left Kraków, in October 1874, until he signed off the &quot;Adowa&quot;, in January 1894, he had worked in ships, including long periods in port, for 10 years and almost 8 months. He had spent just over 8 years at sea—9 months of it as a passenger. His sole captaincy took place in 1888–89, when he commanded the barque &quot;Otago&quot; from Sydney to Mauritius.

During a brief call in India in 1885–86, 28-year-old Conrad sent five letters to Joseph Spiridion, a Pole eight years his senior whom he had befriended at Cardiff in June 1885, just before sailing for Singapore in the clipper ship &quot;Tilkhurst&quot;. These letters are Conrad&#x27;s first preserved texts in English. His English is generally correct but stiff to the point of artificiality; many fragments suggest that his thoughts ran along the lines of Polish syntax and phraseology.

More importantly, the letters show a marked change in views from those implied in his earlier correspondence of 1881–83. He had abandoned &quot;hope for the future&quot; and the conceit of &quot;sailing [ever] toward Poland&quot;, and his Panslavic ideas. He was left with a painful sense of the hopelessness of the Polish question and an acceptance of England as a possible refuge. While he often adjusted his statements to accord to some extent with the views of his addressees, the theme of hopelessness concerning the prospects for Polish independence often occurs authentically in his correspondence and works before 1914.
The year 1890 marked Conrad&#x27;s first return to Poland, where he would visit his uncle and other relatives and acquaintances. This visit took place while he was waiting to proceed to the Congo Free State, having been hired by Albert Thys, deputy director of the &quot;Société Anonyme Belge pour le Commerce du Haut-Congo&quot;. Conrad&#x27;s association with the Belgian company, on the Congo River, would inspire his novella, &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;. During this 1890 period in the Congo, Conrad befriended Roger Casement, who was also working for Thys, operating a trading and transport station in Matadi. In 1903, as British Consul to Boma, Casement was commissioned to investigate abuses in the Congo, and later in Amazonian Peru, and was knighted in 1911 for his advocacy of human rights. Casement later became active in Irish Republicanism after leaving the British consular service.
Conrad left Africa at the end of December 1890, arriving in Brussels by late January of the following year. He rejoined the British merchant marines, as first mate, in November. When he left London on 25 October 1892 aboard the passenger clipper ship &quot;Torrens&quot;, one of the passengers was William Henry Jacques, a consumptive Cambridge University graduate who died less than a year later on 19 September 1893. According to Conrad&#x27;s &quot;A Personal Record&quot;, Jacques was the first reader of the still-unfinished manuscript of Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Almayer&#x27;s Folly&quot;. Jacques encouraged Conrad to continue writing the novel.

Conrad completed his last long-distance voyage as a seaman on 26 July 1893 when the &quot;Torrens&quot; docked at London and &quot;J. Conrad Korzemowin&quot;—per the certificate of discharge—debarked. 

When the &quot;Torrens&quot; had left Adelaide on 13 March 1893, the passengers had included two young Englishmen returning from Australia and New Zealand: 25-year-old lawyer and future novelist John Galsworthy; and Edward Lancelot Sanderson, who was going to help his father run a boys&#x27; preparatory school at Elstree. They were probably the first Englishmen and non-sailors with whom Conrad struck up a friendship and he would remain in touch with both. In one of Galsworthy&#x27;s first literary attempts, &quot;The Doldrums&quot; (1895–96), the protagonist—first mate Armand—is modelled after Conrad. 

At Cape Town, where the &quot;Torrens&quot; remained from 17 to 19 May, Galsworthy left the ship to look at the local mines. Sanderson continued his voyage and seems to have been the first to develop closer ties with Conrad. Later that year, Conrad would visit his relatives in Poland and Ukraine once again.

===Writer===

In the autumn of 1889, Conrad began writing his first novel, &quot;Almayer&#x27;s Folly&quot;.

Conrad&#x27;s later letters to literary friends show the attention that he devoted to analysis of style, to individual words and expressions, to the emotional tone of phrases, to the atmosphere created by language. In this, Conrad in his own way followed the example of Gustave Flaubert, notorious for searching days on end for &quot;le mot juste&quot;—for the right word to render the &quot;essence of the matter.&quot; Najder opined:

&quot;[W]riting in a foreign language admits a greater temerity in tackling personally sensitive problems, for it leaves uncommitted the most spontaneous, deeper reaches of the psyche, and allows a greater distance in treating matters we would hardly dare approach in the language of our childhood. As a rule it is easier both to swear and to analyze dispassionately in an acquired language.&quot;

In 1894, aged 36, Conrad reluctantly gave up the sea, partly because of poor health, partly due to unavailability of ships, and partly because he had become so fascinated with writing that he had decided on a literary career. &quot;Almayer&#x27;s Folly&quot;, set on the east coast of Borneo, was published in 1895. Its appearance marked his first use of the pen name &quot;Joseph Conrad&quot;; &quot;Konrad&quot; was, of course, the third of his Polish given names, but his use of it—in the anglicised version, &quot;Conrad&quot;—may also have been an homage to the Polish Romantic poet Adam Mickiewicz&#x27;s patriotic narrative poem, &quot;Konrad Wallenrod&quot;.

Edward Garnett, a young publisher&#x27;s reader and literary critic who would play one of the chief supporting roles in Conrad&#x27;s literary career, had—like Unwin&#x27;s first reader of &quot;Almayer&#x27;s Folly&quot;, Wilfrid Hugh Chesson—been impressed by the manuscript, but Garnett had been &quot;uncertain whether the English was good enough for publication.&quot; Garnett had shown the novel to his wife, Constance Garnett, later a translator of Russian literature. She had thought Conrad&#x27;s foreignness a positive merit.

While Conrad had only limited personal acquaintance with the peoples of Maritime Southeast Asia, the region looms large in his early work. According to Najder, Conrad, the exile and wanderer, was aware of a difficulty that he confessed more than once: the lack of a common cultural background with his Anglophone readers meant he could not compete with English-language authors writing about the English-speaking world. At the same time, the choice of a non-English colonial setting freed him from an embarrassing division of loyalty: &quot;Almayer&#x27;s Folly&quot;, and later &quot;An Outpost of Progress&quot; (1897, set in a Congo exploited by King Leopold II of Belgium) and &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; (1899, likewise set in the Congo), contain bitter reflections on colonialism. The Malay states came theoretically under the suzerainty of the Dutch government; Conrad did not write about the area&#x27;s British dependencies, which he never visited. He &quot;was apparently intrigued by... struggles aimed at preserving national independence. The prolific and destructive richness of tropical nature and the dreariness of human life within it accorded well with the pessimistic mood of his early works.&quot;

&quot;Almayer&#x27;s Folly&quot;, together with its successor, &quot;An Outcast of the Islands&quot; (1896), laid the foundation for Conrad&#x27;s reputation as a romantic teller of exotic tales—a misunderstanding of his purpose that was to frustrate him for the rest of his career.

Almost all of Conrad&#x27;s writings were first published in newspapers and magazines: influential reviews like &quot;The Fortnightly Review&quot; and the &quot;North American Review&quot;; avant-garde publications like the &quot;Savoy&quot;, &quot;New Review&quot;, and &quot;The English Review&quot;; popular short-fiction magazines like &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;; women&#x27;s journals like the &quot;Pictorial Review&quot; and &quot;Romance&quot;; mass-circulation dailies like the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and the &quot;New York Herald&quot;; and illustrated newspapers like &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; and the &quot;Illustrated Buffalo Express&quot;. He also wrote for &quot;The Outlook&quot;, an imperialist weekly magazine, between 1898 and 1906.

Financial success long eluded Conrad, who often requested advances from magazine and book publishers, and loans from acquaintances such as John Galsworthy. Eventually a government grant (&quot;civil list pension&quot;) of £100 per annum, awarded on 9 August 1910, somewhat relieved his financial worries, and in time collectors began purchasing his manuscripts. Though his talent was early on recognised by English intellectuals, popular success eluded him until the 1913 publication of &quot;Chance&quot;, which is often considered one of his weaker novels.

===Personal life===
====Temperament and health====
Conrad was a reserved man, wary of showing emotion. He scorned sentimentality; his manner of portraying emotion in his books was full of restraint, scepticism and irony. In the words of his uncle Bobrowski, as a young man Conrad was &quot;extremely sensitive, conceited, reserved, and in addition excitable. In short [...] all the defects of the &quot;Nałęcz&quot; family.&quot;

Conrad suffered throughout life from ill health, physical and mental. A newspaper review of a Conrad biography suggested that the book could have been subtitled &quot;Thirty Years of Debt, Gout, Depression and Angst&quot;. In 1891 he was hospitalised for several months, suffering from gout, neuralgic pains in his right arm and recurrent attacks of malaria. He also complained of swollen hands &quot;which made writing difficult&quot;. Taking his uncle Tadeusz Bobrowski&#x27;s advice, he convalesced at a spa in Switzerland. Conrad had a phobia of dentistry, neglecting his teeth until they had to be extracted. In one letter he remarked that every novel he had written had cost him a tooth. Conrad&#x27;s physical afflictions were, if anything, less vexatious than his mental ones. In his letters he often described symptoms of depression; &quot;the evidence&quot;, writes Najder, &quot;is so strong that it is nearly impossible to doubt it.&quot;

====Attempted suicide====
In March 1878, at the end of his Marseille period, 20-year-old Conrad attempted suicide, by shooting himself in the chest with a revolver. According to his uncle, who was summoned by a friend, Conrad had fallen into debt. Bobrowski described his subsequent &quot;study&quot; of his nephew in an extensive letter to Stefan Buszczyński, his own ideological opponent and a friend of Conrad&#x27;s late father Apollo. To what extent the suicide attempt had been made in earnest likely will never be known, but it is suggestive of a situational depression.

====Romance and marriage====
In 1888 during a stop-over on Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean, Conrad developed a couple of romantic interests. One of these would be described in his 1910 story &quot;A Smile of Fortune&quot;, which contains autobiographical elements (e.g., one of the characters is the same Chief Mate Burns who appears in &quot;The Shadow Line&quot;). The narrator, a young captain, flirts ambiguously and surreptitiously with Alice Jacobus, daughter of a local merchant living in a house surrounded by a magnificent rose garden. Research has confirmed that in Port Louis at the time there was a 17-year-old Alice Shaw, whose father, a shipping agent, owned the only rose garden in town.

More is known about Conrad&#x27;s other, more open flirtation. An old friend, Captain Gabriel Renouf of the French merchant marine, introduced him to the family of his brother-in-law. Renouf&#x27;s eldest sister was the wife of Louis Edward Schmidt, a senior official in the colony; with them lived two other sisters and two brothers. Though the island had been taken over in 1810 by Britain, many of the inhabitants were descendants of the original French colonists, and Conrad&#x27;s excellent French and perfect manners opened all local salons to him. He became a frequent guest at the Schmidts&#x27;, where he often met the Misses Renouf. A couple of days before leaving Port Louis, Conrad asked one of the Renouf brothers for the hand of his 26-year-old sister Eugenie. She was already, however, engaged to marry her pharmacist cousin. After the rebuff, Conrad did not pay a farewell visit but sent a polite letter to Gabriel Renouf, saying he would never return to Mauritius and adding that on the day of the wedding his thoughts would be with them.
On 24 March 1896 Conrad married an Englishwoman, Jessie George. The couple had two sons, Borys and John. The elder, Borys, proved a disappointment in scholarship and integrity. Jessie was an unsophisticated, working-class girl, sixteen years younger than Conrad. To his friends, she was an inexplicable choice of wife, and the subject of some rather disparaging and unkind remarks. (See Lady Ottoline Morrell&#x27;s opinion of Jessie in Impressions.) However, according to other biographers such as Frederick Karl, Jessie provided what Conrad needed, namely a &quot;straightforward, devoted, quite competent&quot; companion. Similarly, Jones remarks that, despite whatever difficulties the marriage endured, &quot;there can be no doubt that the relationship sustained Conrad&#x27;s career as a writer&quot;, which might have been much less successful without her.

When in 1923 Jessie Conrad published &quot;A Handbook of Cookery for a Small House&quot;, it came with a preface from Joseph Conrad praising &quot;the conscientious preparation of the simple food of everyday life, not the... concoction of idle feasts and rare dishes.&quot;

The couple rented a long series of successive homes, mostly in the English countryside. Conrad, who suffered frequent depressions, made great efforts to change his mood; the most important step was to move into another house. His frequent changes of home were usually signs of a search for psychological regeneration. Between 1910 and 1919 Conrad&#x27;s home was Capel House in Orlestone, Kent, which was rented to him by Lord and Lady Oliver. It was here that he wrote &quot;The Rescue&quot;, &quot;Victory&quot;, and &quot;The Arrow of Gold&quot;.

Except for several vacations in France and Italy, a 1914 vacation in his native Poland, and a 1923 visit to the United States, Conrad lived the rest of his life in England.

===Sojourn in Poland===
The 1914 vacation with his wife and sons in Poland, at the urging of Józef Retinger, coincided with the outbreak of World War I. On 28 July 1914, the day war broke out between Austro-Hungary and Serbia, Conrad and the Retingers arrived in Kraków (then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire), where Conrad visited childhood haunts. 

As the city lay only a few miles from the Russian border, there was a risk of being stranded in a battle zone. With wife Jessie and younger son John ill, Conrad decided to take refuge in the mountain resort town of Zakopane. They left Kraków on 2 August. A few days after arrival in Zakopane, they moved to the Konstantynówka &quot;pension&quot; operated by Conrad&#x27;s cousin Aniela Zagórska; it had been frequented by celebrities including the statesman Józef Piłsudski and Conrad&#x27;s acquaintance, the young concert pianist Artur Rubinstein.

Zagórska introduced Conrad to Polish writers, intellectuals, and artists who had also taken refuge in Zakopane, including novelist Stefan Żeromski and Tadeusz Nalepiński, a writer friend of anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski. Conrad aroused interest among the Poles as a famous writer and an exotic compatriot from abroad. He charmed new acquaintances, especially women. 

However, Marie Curie&#x27;s physician sister, Bronisława Dłuska, wife of fellow physician and eminent socialist activist Kazimierz Dłuski, openly berated Conrad for having used his great talent for purposes other than bettering the future of his native land.

But thirty-two-year-old Aniela Zagórska (daughter of the &quot;pension&quot; keeper), Conrad&#x27;s niece who would translate his works into Polish in 1923–39, idolised him, kept him company, and provided him with books. He particularly delighted in the stories and novels of the ten-years-older, recently deceased Bolesław Prus (who also had visited Zakopane), read everything by his fellow victim of Poland&#x27;s 1863 Uprising—&quot;my beloved Prus&quot;—that he could get his hands on, and pronounced him &quot;better than Dickens&quot;—a favourite English novelist of Conrad&#x27;s.

Conrad, who was noted by his Polish acquaintances to still be fluent in his native tongue, participated in their impassioned political discussions. He declared presciently, as Józef Piłsudski had earlier in 1914 in Paris, that in the war, for Poland to regain independence, Russia must be beaten by the Central Powers (the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires), and the Central Powers must in turn be beaten by France and Britain.

After many travails and vicissitudes, at the beginning of November 1914 Conrad managed to bring his family back to England. On his return, he was determined to work on swaying British opinion in favour of restoring Poland&#x27;s sovereignty.

Jessie Conrad would later write in her memoirs: &quot;I understood my husband so much better after those months in Poland. So many characteristics that had been strange and unfathomable to me before, took, as it were, their right proportions. I understood that his temperament was that of his countrymen.&quot;

===Politics===
Biographer Zdzisław Najder wrote: 

The most extensive and ambitious political statement that Conrad ever made was his 1905 essay, &quot;Autocracy and War&quot;, whose starting point was the Russo-Japanese War (he finished the article a month before the Battle of Tsushima Strait). The essay begins with a statement about Russia&#x27;s incurable weakness and ends with warnings against Prussia, the dangerous aggressor in a future European war. For Russia he predicted a violent outburst in the near future, but Russia&#x27;s lack of democratic traditions and the backwardness of her masses made it impossible for the revolution to have a salutary effect. Conrad regarded the formation of a representative government in Russia as unfeasible and foresaw a transition from autocracy to dictatorship. He saw western Europe as torn by antagonisms engendered by economic rivalry and commercial selfishness. In vain might a Russian revolution seek advice or help from a materialistic and egoistic western Europe that armed itself in preparation for wars far more brutal than those of the past.

Conrad&#x27;s distrust of democracy sprang from his doubts whether the propagation of democracy as an aim in itself could solve any problems. He thought that, in view of the weakness of human nature and of the &quot;criminal&quot; character of society, democracy offered boundless opportunities for demagogues and charlatans. Conrad kept his distance from partisan politics, and never voted in British national elections.

He accused social democrats of his time of acting to weaken &quot;the national sentiment, the preservation of which [was his] concern&quot;—of attempting to dissolve national identities in an impersonal melting-pot. &quot;I look at the future from the depth of a very black past and I find that nothing is left for me except fidelity to a cause lost, to an idea without future.&quot; It was Conrad&#x27;s hopeless fidelity to the memory of Poland that prevented him from believing in the idea of &quot;international fraternity&quot;, which he considered, under the circumstances, just a verbal exercise. He resented some socialists&#x27; talk of freedom and world brotherhood while keeping silent about his own partitioned and oppressed Poland.

Before that, in the early 1880s, letters to Conrad from his uncle Tadeusz show Conrad apparently having hoped for an improvement in Poland&#x27;s situation not through a liberation movement but by establishing an alliance with neighbouring Slavic nations. This had been accompanied by a faith in the Panslavic ideology—&quot;surprising&quot;, Najder writes, &quot;in a man who was later to emphasize his hostility towards Russia, a conviction that... Poland&#x27;s [superior] civilization and... historic... traditions would [let] her play a leading role... in the Panslavic community, [and his] doubts about Poland&#x27;s chances of becoming a fully sovereign nation-state.&quot;

Conrad&#x27;s alienation from &quot;partisan&quot; politics went together with an abiding sense of the thinking man&#x27;s burden imposed by his personality, as described in an 1894 letter by Conrad to a relative-by-marriage and fellow author, Marguerite Poradowska (&quot;née&quot; Gachet, and cousin of Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s physician, Paul Gachet) of Brussels:

Conrad wrote H. G. Wells that the latter&#x27;s 1901 book, &quot;Anticipations&quot;, an ambitious attempt to predict major social trends, &quot;seems to presuppose... a sort of select circle to which you address yourself, leaving the rest of the world outside the pale. [In addition,] you do not take sufficient account of human imbecility which is cunning and perfidious.&quot;

In a 23 October 1922 letter to mathematician-philosopher Bertrand Russell, in response to the latter&#x27;s book, &quot;The Problem of China&quot;, which advocated socialist reforms and an oligarchy of sages who would reshape Chinese society, Conrad explained his own distrust of political panaceas:

Leo Robson writes:

But, writes Robson, Conrad is no moral nihilist:

In an August 1901 letter to the editor of &quot;The New York Times Saturday Book Review&quot;, Conrad wrote: &quot;Egoism, which is the moving force of the world, and altruism, which is its morality, these two contradictory instincts, of which one is so plain and the other so mysterious, cannot serve us unless in the incomprehensible alliance of their irreconcilable antagonism.&quot;

===Death===

On 3 August 1924, Conrad died at his house, Oswalds, in Bishopsbourne, Kent, England, probably of a heart attack. He was interred at Canterbury Cemetery, Canterbury, under a misspelled version of his original Polish name, as &quot;Joseph Teador Conrad Korzeniowski&quot;. Inscribed on his gravestone are the lines from Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; which he had chosen as the epigraph to his last complete novel, &quot;The Rover&quot;:

Conrad&#x27;s modest funeral took place amid great crowds. His old friend Edward Garnett recalled bitterly:

Another old friend of Conrad&#x27;s, Cunninghame Graham, wrote Garnett: &quot;Aubry was saying to me... that had Anatole France died, all Paris would have been at his funeral.&quot;

Conrad&#x27;s wife Jessie died twelve years later, on 6 December 1936, and was interred with him.

In 1996 his grave was designated a Grade II listed structure.

Conrad, though nominally a Catholic, is described by biographer Jeffrey Meyers as having been an atheist.

===Themes and style===

Despite the opinions even of some who knew Conrad personally, such as fellow-novelist Henry James, Conrad—even when only writing elegantly crafted letters to his uncle and acquaintances—was always at heart a writer who sailed, rather than a sailor who wrote. He used his sailing experiences as a backdrop for many of his works, but he also produced works of similar world view, without the nautical motifs. The failure of many critics to appreciate this caused him much frustration.

He wrote more often about life at sea and in exotic parts than about life on British land because—unlike, for example, his friend John Galsworthy, author of &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot;—he knew little about everyday domestic relations in Britain. When Conrad&#x27;s &quot;The Mirror of the Sea&quot; was published in 1906 to critical acclaim, he wrote to his French translator: &quot;The critics have been vigorously swinging the censer to me. ... Behind the concert of flattery, I can hear something like a whisper: &#x27;Keep to the open sea! Don&#x27;t land!&#x27; They want to banish me to the middle of the ocean.&quot; Writing to his friend Richard Curle, Conrad remarked that &quot;the public mind fastens on externals&quot; such as his &quot;sea life&quot;, oblivious to how authors transform their material &quot;from particular to general, and appeal to universal emotions by the temperamental handling of personal experience&quot;.

Nevertheless, Conrad found much sympathetic readership, especially in the United States. H. L. Mencken was one of the earliest and most influential American readers to recognise how Conrad conjured up &quot;the general out of the particular&quot;. F. Scott Fitzgerald, writing to Mencken, complained about having been omitted from a list of Conrad imitators. Since Fitzgerald, dozens of other American writers have acknowledged their debts to Conrad, including William Faulkner, William Burroughs, Saul Bellow, Philip Roth, Joan Didion, and Thomas Pynchon.

An October 1923 visitor to Oswalds, Conrad&#x27;s home at the time—Cyril Clemens, a cousin of Mark Twain—quoted Conrad as saying: &quot;In everything I have written there is always one invariable intention, and that is to capture the reader&#x27;s attention.&quot;

Conrad the artist famously aspired, in the words of his preface to &quot;The Nigger of the &#x27;Narcissus&#x27;&quot; (1897), &quot;by the power of the written word to make you hear, to make you feel ... before all, to make you &quot;see&quot;. That—and no more, and it is everything. If I succeed, you shall find there according to your deserts: encouragement, consolation, fear, charm—all you demand—and, perhaps, also that glimpse of truth for which you have forgotten to ask.&quot;

Writing in what to the visual arts was the age of Impressionism, and what to music was the age of impressionist music, Conrad showed himself in many of his works a prose poet of the highest order: for instance, in the evocative &quot;Patna&quot; and courtroom scenes of &quot;Lord Jim&quot;; in the scenes of the &quot;melancholy-mad elephant&quot; and the &quot;French gunboat firing into a continent&quot;, in &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;; in the doubled protagonists of &quot;The Secret Sharer&quot;; and in the verbal and conceptual resonances of &quot;Nostromo&quot; and &quot;The Nigger of the &#x27;Narcissus&#x27;&quot;.

Conrad used his own memories as literary material so often that readers are tempted to treat his life and work as a single whole. His &quot;view of the world&quot;, or elements of it, is often described by citing at once both his private and public statements, passages from his letters, and citations from his books. Najder warns that this approach produces an incoherent and misleading picture. &quot;An ... uncritical linking of the two spheres, literature and private life, distorts each. Conrad used his own experiences as raw material, but the finished product should not be confused with the experiences themselves.&quot;

Many of Conrad&#x27;s characters were inspired by actual persons he had met, including, in his first novel, &quot;Almayer&#x27;s Folly&quot; (completed 1894), William Charles Olmeijer, the spelling of whose surname Conrad probably altered to &quot;Almayer&quot; inadvertently. The historic trader Olmeijer, whom Conrad encountered on his four short visits to Berau in Borneo, subsequently haunted Conrad&#x27;s imagination. Conrad often borrowed the authentic names of actual individuals, e.g., Captain McWhirr (&quot;Typhoon&quot;), Captain Beard and Mr. Mahon (&quot;Youth&quot;), Captain Lingard (&quot;Almayer&#x27;s Folly&quot; and elsewhere), and Captain Ellis (&quot;The Shadow Line&quot;). &quot;Conrad&quot;, writes J. I. M. Stewart, &quot;appears to have attached some mysterious significance to such links with actuality.&quot; Equally curious is &quot;a great deal of namelessness in Conrad, requiring some minor virtuosity to maintain.&quot; Thus we never learn the surname of the protagonist of &quot;Lord Jim&quot;. Conrad also preserves, in &quot;The Nigger of the &#x27;Narcissus&#x27;&quot;, the authentic name of the ship, the &quot;Narcissus&quot;, in which he sailed in 1884.

Apart from Conrad&#x27;s own experiences, a number of episodes in his fiction were suggested by past or contemporary publicly known events or literary works. The first half of the 1900 novel &quot;Lord Jim&quot; (the &quot;Patna&quot; episode) was inspired by the real-life 1880 story of the ; the second part, to some extent by the life of James Brooke, the first White Rajah of Sarawak. The 1901 short story &quot;Amy Foster&quot; was inspired partly by an anecdote in Ford Madox Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Cinque Ports&quot; (1900), wherein a shipwrecked sailor from a German merchant ship, unable to communicate in English, and driven away by the local country people, finally found shelter in a pigsty.

In &quot;Nostromo&quot; (completed 1904), the theft of a massive consignment of silver was suggested to Conrad by a story he had heard in the Gulf of Mexico and later read about in a &quot;volume picked up outside a second-hand bookshop.&quot; The novel&#x27;s political strand, according to Maya Jasanoff, is related to the creation of the Panama Canal. &quot;In January 1903&quot;, she writes, &quot;just as Conrad started writing &quot;Nostromo&quot;, the US and Colombian secretaries of state signed a treaty granting the United States a one-hundred-year renewable lease on a six-mile strip flanking the canal ... While the [news]papers murmured about revolution in Colombia, Conrad opened a fresh section of &quot;Nostromo&quot; with hints of dissent in Costaguana&quot;, his fictional South American country. He plotted a revolution in the Costaguanan fictional port of Sulaco that mirrored the real-life secessionist movement brewing in Panama. When Conrad finished the novel on 1 September 1904, writes Jasanoff, &quot;he left Sulaco in the condition of Panama. As Panama had gotten its independence instantly recognized by the United States and its economy bolstered by American investment in the canal, so Sulaco had &quot;its&quot; independence instantly recognized by the United States, and its economy underwritten by investment in the [fictional] San Tomé [silver] mine.&quot;

&quot;The Secret Agent&quot; (completed 1906) was inspired by the French anarchist Martial Bourdin&#x27;s 1894 death while apparently attempting to blow up the Greenwich Observatory. Conrad&#x27;s story &quot;The Secret Sharer&quot; (completed 1909) was inspired by an 1880 incident when Sydney Smith, first mate of the &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;, had killed a seaman and fled from justice, aided by the ship&#x27;s captain. The plot of &quot;Under Western Eyes&quot; (completed 1910) is kicked off by the assassination of a brutal Russian government minister, modelled after the real-life 1904 assassination of Russian Minister of the Interior Vyacheslav von Plehve. The near-novella &quot;Freya of the Seven Isles&quot; (completed in March 1911) was inspired by a story told to Conrad by a Malaya old hand and fan of Conrad&#x27;s, Captain Carlos M. Marris.

For the natural surroundings of the high seas, the Malay Archipelago and South America, which Conrad described so vividly, he could rely on his own observations. What his brief landfalls could not provide was a thorough understanding of exotic cultures. For this he resorted, like other writers, to literary sources. When writing his Malayan stories, he consulted Alfred Russel Wallace&#x27;s &quot;The Malay Archipelago&quot; (1869), James Brooke&#x27;s journals, and books with titles like &quot;Perak and the Malays&quot;, &quot;My Journal in Malayan Waters&quot;, and &quot;Life in the Forests of the Far East&quot;. When he set about writing his novel &quot;Nostromo&quot;, set in the fictional South American country of Costaguana, he turned to &quot;The War between Peru and Chile&quot;; Edward Eastwick, &quot;Venezuela: or, Sketches of Life in a South American Republic&quot; (1868); and George Frederick Masterman, &quot;Seven Eventful Years in Paraguay&quot; (1869). As a result of relying on literary sources, in &quot;Lord Jim&quot;, as J. I. M. Stewart writes, Conrad&#x27;s &quot;need to work to some extent from second-hand&quot; led to &quot;a certain thinness in Jim&#x27;s relations with the ... peoples ... of Patusan...&quot; This prompted Conrad at some points to alter the nature of Charles Marlow&#x27;s narrative to &quot;distanc[e] an uncertain command of the detail of Tuan Jim&#x27;s empire.&quot;

In keeping with his scepticism and melancholy, Conrad almost invariably gives lethal fates to the characters in his principal novels and stories. Almayer (&quot;Almayer&#x27;s Folly&quot;, 1894), abandoned by his beloved daughter, takes to opium, and dies. Peter Willems (&quot;An Outcast of the Islands&quot;, 1895) is killed by his jealous lover Aïssa. The ineffectual &quot;Nigger&quot;, James Wait (&quot;The Nigger of the &#x27;Narcissus&#x27;&quot;, 1897), dies aboard ship and is buried at sea. Mr. Kurtz (&quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, 1899) expires, uttering the words, &quot;The horror! The horror!&quot; &quot;Tuan&quot; Jim (&quot;Lord Jim&quot;, 1900), having inadvertently precipitated a massacre of his adoptive community, deliberately walks to his death at the hands of the community&#x27;s leader. In Conrad&#x27;s 1901 short story, &quot;Amy Foster&quot;, a Pole transplanted to England, Yanko Goorall (an English transliteration of the Polish &quot;Janko Góral&quot;, &quot;Johnny Highlander&quot;), falls ill and, suffering from a fever, raves in his native language, frightening his wife Amy, who flees; next morning Yanko dies of heart failure, and it transpires that he had simply been asking in Polish for water. Captain Whalley (&quot;The End of the Tether&quot;, 1902), betrayed by failing eyesight and an unscrupulous partner, drowns himself. Gian&#x27; Battista Fidanza, the eponymous respected Italian-immigrant &quot;Nostromo&quot; () of the novel &quot;Nostromo&quot; (1904), illicitly obtains a treasure of silver mined in the South American country of &quot;Costaguana&quot; and is shot dead due to mistaken identity. Mr. Verloc, &quot;The Secret Agent&quot; (1906) of divided loyalties, attempts a bombing, to be blamed on terrorists, that accidentally kills his mentally defective brother-in-law Stevie, and Verloc himself is killed by his distraught wife, who drowns herself by jumping overboard from a channel steamer. In &quot;Chance&quot; (1913), Roderick Anthony, a sailing-ship captain, and benefactor and husband of Flora de Barral, becomes the target of a poisoning attempt by her jealous disgraced financier father who, when detected, swallows the poison himself and dies (some years later, Captain Anthony drowns at sea). In &quot;Victory&quot; (1915), Lena is shot dead by Jones, who had meant to kill his accomplice Ricardo and later succeeds in doing so, then himself perishes along with another accomplice, after which Lena&#x27;s protector Axel Heyst sets fire to his bungalow and dies beside Lena&#x27;s body.

When a principal character of Conrad&#x27;s does escape with his life, he sometimes does not fare much better. In &quot;Under Western Eyes&quot; (1911), Razumov betrays a fellow University of St. Petersburg student, the revolutionist Victor Haldin, who has assassinated a savagely repressive Russian government minister. Haldin is tortured and hanged by the authorities. Later Razumov, sent as a government spy to Geneva, a centre of anti-tsarist intrigue, meets the mother and sister of Haldin, who share Haldin&#x27;s liberal convictions. Razumov falls in love with the sister and confesses his betrayal of her brother; later, he makes the same avowal to assembled revolutionists, and their professional executioner bursts his eardrums, making him deaf for life. Razumov staggers away, is knocked down by a streetcar, and finally returns as a cripple to Russia.

Conrad was keenly conscious of tragedy in the world and in his works. In 1898, at the start of his writing career, he had written to his Scottish writer-politician friend Cunninghame Graham: &quot;What makes mankind tragic is not that they are the victims of nature, it is that they are conscious of it. [A]s soon as you know of your slavery the pain, the anger, the strife—the tragedy begins.&quot; But in 1922, near the end of his life and career, when another Scottish friend, Richard Curle, sent Conrad proofs of two articles he had written about Conrad, the latter objected to being characterised as a gloomy and tragic writer. &quot;That reputation ... has deprived me of innumerable readers ... I absolutely object to being called a &quot;tragedian&quot;.&quot;

Conrad claimed that he &quot;never kept a diary and never owned a notebook.&quot; John Galsworthy, who knew him well, described this as &quot;a statement which surprised no one who knew the resources of his memory and the brooding nature of his creative spirit.&quot; Nevertheless, after Conrad&#x27;s death, Richard Curle published a heavily modified version of Conrad&#x27;s diaries describing his experiences in the Congo; in 1978 a more complete version was published as &quot;The Congo Diary and Other Uncollected Pieces&quot;. The first accurate transcription was published in Robert Hampson&#x27;s Penguin edition of &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; in 1995; Hampson&#x27;s transcription and annotations were reprinted in the Penguin edition of 2007.

Unlike many authors who make it a point not to discuss work in progress, Conrad often did discuss his current work and even showed it to select friends and fellow authors, such as Edward Garnett, and sometimes modified it in the light of their critiques and suggestions.

Edward Said was struck by the sheer quantity of Conrad&#x27;s correspondence with friends and fellow writers; by 1966, it &quot;amount[ed] to eight published volumes&quot;. Said comments: &quot;[I]t seemed to me that if Conrad wrote of himself, of the problem of self-definition, with such sustained urgency, some of what he wrote must have had meaning for his fiction. [I]t [was] difficult to believe that a man would be so uneconomical as to pour himself out in letter after letter and then not use and reformulate his insights and discoveries in his fiction.&quot; Said found especially close parallels between Conrad&#x27;s letters and his shorter fiction. &quot;Conrad ... believed ... that artistic distinction was more tellingly demonstrated in a shorter rather than a longer work... He believed that his [own] life was like a series of short episodes... because he was himself so many different people ...: he was a Pole and an Englishman, a sailor and a writer.&quot; Another scholar, Najder, wrote:

Conrad borrowed from other, Polish- and French-language authors, to an extent sometimes skirting plagiarism. When the Polish translation of his 1915 novel &quot;Victory&quot; appeared in 1931, readers noted striking similarities to Stefan Żeromski&#x27;s kitschy novel, &quot;The History of a Sin&quot; (&quot;Dzieje grzechu&quot;, 1908), including their endings. Comparative-literature scholar Yves Hervouet has demonstrated in the text of &quot;Victory&quot; a whole mosaic of influences, borrowings, similarities and allusions. He further lists hundreds of concrete borrowings from other, mostly French authors in nearly all of Conrad&#x27;s works, from &quot;Almayer&#x27;s Folly&quot; (1895) to his unfinished &quot;Suspense&quot;. Conrad seems to have used eminent writers&#x27; texts as raw material of the same kind as the content of his own memory. Materials borrowed from other authors often functioned as allusions. Moreover, he had a phenomenal memory for texts and remembered details, &quot;but [writes Najder] it was not a memory strictly categorized according to sources, marshalled into homogeneous entities; it was, rather, an enormous receptacle of images and pieces from which he would draw.&quot;

Continues Najder: &quot;[H]e can never be accused of outright plagiarism. Even when lifting sentences and scenes, Conrad changed their character, inserted them within novel structures. He did not imitate, but (as Hervouet says) &#x27;continued&#x27; his masters. He was right in saying: &#x27;I don&#x27;t resemble anybody.&#x27; Ian Watt put it succinctly: &#x27;In a sense, Conrad is the least derivative of writers; he wrote very little that could possibly be mistaken for the work of anyone else.&#x27; Conrad&#x27;s acquaintance George Bernard Shaw says it well: &quot;[A] man can no more be completely original [...] than a tree can grow out of air.&quot;

Conrad, like other artists, faced constraints arising from the need to propitiate his audience and confirm their own favourable self-regard. This may account for his describing the admirable crew of the &quot;Judea&quot; in his 1898 story &quot;Youth&quot; as &quot;Liverpool hard cases&quot;, whereas the crew of the &quot;Judea&quot;&#x27;s actual 1882 prototype, the &quot;Palestine&quot;, had included not a single Liverpudlian, and half the crew had been non-Britons; and for Conrad&#x27;s transforming the real-life 1880 criminally negligent British captain J. L. Clark, of the , in his 1900 novel &quot;Lord Jim&quot;, into the captain of the fictitious &quot;Patna&quot;—&quot;a sort of renegade New South Wales German&quot; so monstrous in physical appearance as to suggest &quot;a trained baby elephant&quot;. Similarly, in his letters Conrad—during most of his literary career, struggling for sheer financial survival—often adjusted his views to the predilections of his correspondents.
Historians have also noted that Conrad&#x27;s works which were set in European colonies and intended to critique the effects of colonialism were set in Dutch and Belgian colonies, instead of the British Empire.

The singularity of the universe depicted in Conrad&#x27;s novels, especially compared to those of near-contemporaries like his friend and frequent benefactor John Galsworthy, is such as to open him to criticism similar to that later applied to Graham Greene. But where &quot;Greeneland&quot; has been characterised as a recurring and recognisable atmosphere independent of setting, Conrad is at pains to create a sense of place, be it aboard ship or in a remote village; often he chose to have his characters play out their destinies in isolated or confined circumstances. In the view of Evelyn Waugh and Kingsley Amis, it was not until the first volumes of Anthony Powell&#x27;s sequence, &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot;, were published in the 1950s, that an English novelist achieved the same command of atmosphere and precision of language with consistency, a view supported by later critics like A. N. Wilson; Powell acknowledged his debt to Conrad. Leo Gurko, too, remarks, as &quot;one of Conrad&#x27;s special qualities, his abnormal awareness of place, an awareness magnified to almost a new dimension in art, an ecological dimension defining the relationship between earth and man.&quot;

T. E. Lawrence, one of many writers whom Conrad befriended, offered some perceptive observations about Conrad&#x27;s writing:

The Irish novelist-poet-critic Colm Tóibín captures something similar:

In a letter of 14 December 1897 to his Scottish friend, Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham, Conrad wrote that science tells us, &quot;Understand that thou art nothing, less than a shadow, more insignificant than a drop of water in the ocean, more fleeting than the illusion of a dream.&quot;

In a letter of 20 December 1897 to Cunninghame Graham, Conrad metaphorically described the universe as a huge machine:

Conrad wrote Cunninghame Graham on 31 January 1898:

Leo Robson suggests that
According to Robson,
===Language===

Conrad spoke his native Polish and the French language fluently from childhood and only acquired English in his twenties. He would probably have spoken some Ukrainian as a child; he certainly had to have some knowledge of German and Russian. His son Borys records that, though Conrad had insisted that he spoke only a few words of German, when they reached the Austrian frontier in the family&#x27;s attempt to leave Poland in 1914, Conrad spoke German &quot;at considerable length and extreme fluency&quot;. Russia, Prussia, and Austria had divided up Poland among them, and he was officially a Russian subject until his naturalization as a British subject. As a result, up to this point, his official documents were in Russian. His knowledge of Russian was good enough that his uncle Tadeusz Bobrowski wrote him (22 May 1893) advising that, when Conrad came to visit, he should &quot;telegraph for horses, but in Russian, for Oratów doesn&#x27;t receive or accept messages in an &#x27;alien&#x27; language.&quot;

Conrad chose, however, to write his fiction in English. He says in his preface to &quot;A Personal Record&quot; that writing in English was for him &quot;natural&quot;, and that the idea of his having made a deliberate choice between English and French, as some had suggested, was in error. He explained that, though he had been familiar with French from childhood, &quot;I would have been afraid to attempt expression in a language so perfectly &#x27;crystallized&#x27;.&quot; In 1915, as Jo Davidson sculpted his bust, Conrad answered his question: &quot;Ah… to write French you have to know it. English is so plastic—if you haven&#x27;t got a word you need you can make it, but to write French you have to be an artist like Anatole France.&quot; These statements, as so often in Conrad&#x27;s &quot;autobiographical&quot; writings, are subtly disingenuous. In 1897 Conrad was visited by a fellow Pole, the philosopher Wincenty Lutosławski, who asked Conrad, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you write in Polish?&quot; Lutosławski recalled Conrad explaining: &quot;I value our beautiful Polish literature too much to bring into it my clumsy efforts. But for the English my gifts are sufficient and secure my daily bread.&quot;

Conrad wrote in &quot;A Personal Record&quot; that English was &quot;the speech of my secret choice, of my future, of long friendships, of the deepest affections, of hours of toil and hours of ease, and of solitary hours, too, of books read, of thoughts pursued, of remembered emotions—of my very dreams!&quot; In 1878 Conrad&#x27;s four-year experience in the French merchant marine had been cut short when the French discovered he did not have a permit from the Imperial Russian consul to sail with the French. This, and some typically disastrous Conradian investments, had left him destitute and had precipitated a suicide attempt. With the concurrence of his mentor-uncle Tadeusz Bobrowski, who had been summoned to Marseille, Conrad decided to seek employment with the British merchant marine, which did not require Russia&#x27;s permission. Thus began Conrad&#x27;s sixteen years&#x27; seafarer&#x27;s acquaintance with the British and with the English language.

Had Conrad remained in the sphere or had he returned to Poland, the son of the Polish poet, playwright, and translator Apollo Korzeniowski—from childhood exposed to Polish and foreign literature, and ambitious to himself become a writer—he might have ended up writing in French or Polish instead of English. Certainly his Uncle Tadeusz thought Conrad might write in Polish; in an 1881 letter he advised his 23-year-old nephew:

In the opinion of some biographers, Conrad&#x27;s third language, English, remained under the influence of his first two languages—Polish and French. This makes his English seem unusual. Najder writes that:

Inevitably for a trilingual Polish–French–English-speaker, Conrad&#x27;s writings occasionally show linguistic spillover: &quot;Franglais&quot; or &quot;Poglish&quot;—the inadvertent use of French or Polish vocabulary, grammar, or syntax in his English writings. In one instance, Najder used &quot;several slips in vocabulary, typical for Conrad (Gallicisms) and grammar (usually Polonisms)&quot; as part of internal evidence against Conrad&#x27;s sometime literary collaborator Ford Madox Ford&#x27;s claim to have written a certain instalment of Conrad&#x27;s novel &quot;Nostromo&quot;, for publication in &quot;T. P.&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, on behalf of an ill Conrad.

The impracticality of working with a language which has long ceased to be one&#x27;s principal language of daily use is illustrated by Conrad&#x27;s 1921 attempt at translating into English the Polish physicist, columnist, story-writer, and comedy-writer Bruno Winawer&#x27;s short play, &quot;The Book of Job&quot;. Najder writes:

As a practical matter, by the time Conrad set about writing fiction, he had little choice but to write in English. Poles who accused Conrad of cultural apostasy because he wrote in English instead of Polish missed the point—as do Anglophones who see, in Conrad&#x27;s default choice of English as his artistic medium, a testimonial to some sort of innate superiority of the English language.

According to Conrad&#x27;s close friend and literary assistant Richard Curle, the fact of Conrad writing in English was &quot;obviously misleading&quot; because Conrad &quot;is no more completely English in his art than he is in his nationality&quot;. Conrad, according to Curle, &quot;could never have written in any other language save the English language...for he would have been dumb in any other language but the English.&quot;

Conrad always retained a strong emotional attachment to his native language. He asked his visiting Polish niece Karola Zagórska, &quot;Will you forgive me that my sons don&#x27;t speak Polish?&quot; In June 1924, shortly before his death, he apparently expressed a desire that his son John marry a Polish girl and learn Polish, and toyed with the idea of returning for good to now independent Poland.

Conrad bridled at being referred to as a Russian or &quot;Slavonic&quot; writer. The only Russian writer he admired was Ivan Turgenev. &quot;The critics&quot;, he wrote an acquaintance on 31 January 1924, six months before his death, &quot;detected in me a new note and as, just when I began to write, they had discovered the existence of Russian authors, they stuck that label on me under the name of Slavonism. What I venture to say is that it would have been more just to charge me at most with Polonism.&quot; However, though Conrad protested that Dostoyevsky was &quot;too Russian for me&quot; and that Russian literature generally was &quot;repugnant to me hereditarily and individually&quot;, &quot;Under Western Eyes&quot; is viewed as Conrad&#x27;s response to the themes explored in Dostoyevsky&#x27;s &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;.

Conrad had an awareness that, in any language, individual expressions – words, phrases, sentences – are fraught with connotations. He once wrote: &quot;No English word has clean edges.&quot; All expressions, he thought, carried so many connotations as to be little more than &quot;instruments for exciting blurred emotions.&quot; This might help elucidate the impressionistic quality of many passages in his writings. It also explains why he chose to write his literary works not in Polish or French but in English, with which for decades he had had the greatest contact.

===Controversy===
In 1975 the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe published an essay, &quot;An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad&#x27;s &#x27;Heart of Darkness&#x27;&quot;, which provoked controversy by calling Conrad a &quot;thoroughgoing racist&quot;. Achebe&#x27;s view was that &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; cannot be considered a great work of art because it is &quot;a novel which celebrates... dehumanisation, which depersonalises a portion of the human race.&quot; Referring to Conrad as a &quot;talented, tormented man&quot;, Achebe notes that Conrad (via the protagonist, Charles Marlow) reduces and degrades Africans to &quot;limbs&quot;, &quot;ankles&quot;, &quot;glistening white eyeballs&quot;, etc., while simultaneously (and fearfully) suspecting a common kinship between himself and these natives—leading Marlow to sneer the word &quot;ugly.&quot; Achebe also cited Conrad&#x27;s description of an encounter with an African: &quot;A certain enormous buck nigger encountered in Haiti fixed my conception of blind, furious, unreasoning rage, as manifested in the human animal to the end of my days.&quot; Achebe&#x27;s essay, a landmark in postcolonial discourse, provoked debate, and the questions it raised have been addressed in most subsequent literary criticism of Conrad.

Achebe&#x27;s critics argue that he fails to distinguish Marlow&#x27;s view from Conrad&#x27;s, which results in very clumsy interpretations of the novella. In their view, Conrad portrays Africans sympathetically and their plight tragically, and refers sarcastically to, and condemns outright, the supposedly noble aims of European colonists, thereby demonstrating his skepticism about the moral superiority of white men. Ending a passage that describes the condition of chained, emaciated slaves, the novelist remarks: &quot;After all, I also was a part of the great cause of these high and just proceedings.&quot; Some observers assert that Conrad, whose native country had been conquered by imperial powers, empathised by default with other subjugated peoples. Jeffrey Meyers notes that Conrad, like his acquaintance Roger Casement, &quot;was one of the first men to question the Western notion of progress, a dominant idea in Europe from the Renaissance to the Great War, to attack the hypocritical justification of colonialism and to reveal... the savage degradation of the white man in Africa.&quot; Likewise, E.D. Morel, who led international opposition to King Leopold II&#x27;s rule in the Congo, saw Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; as a condemnation of colonial brutality and referred to the novella as &quot;the most powerful thing written on the subject.&quot; More recently, Nidesh Lawtoo complicated the race debate by showing that Conrad&#x27;s images of &quot;frenzy&quot; depict rituals of &quot;possession trance&quot; that are equally central to Achebe&#x27;s &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;.

Conrad scholar Peter Firchow writes that &quot;nowhere in the novel does Conrad or any of his narrators, personified or otherwise, claim superiority on the part of Europeans on the grounds of alleged genetic or biological difference.&quot; If Conrad or his novel is racist, it is only in a weak sense, since &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; acknowledges racial distinctions &quot;but does not suggest an essential superiority&quot; of any group. Achebe&#x27;s reading of &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; can be (and has been) challenged by a reading of Conrad&#x27;s other African story, &quot;An Outpost of Progress&quot;, which has an omniscient narrator, rather than the embodied narrator, Marlow. Some younger scholars, such as Masood Ashraf Raja, have also suggested that if we read Conrad beyond &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, especially his Malay novels, racism can be further complicated by foregrounding Conrad&#x27;s positive representation of Muslims.

Adam Hochschild makes a similar point:

Conrad&#x27;s experience in the Belgian-run Congo made him one of the fiercest critics of the &quot;white man&#x27;s mission.&quot; It was also, writes Najder, Conrad&#x27;s most daring and last &quot;attempt to become a &quot;homo socialis&quot;, a cog in the mechanism of society. By accepting the job in the trading company, he joined, for once in his life, an organized, large-scale group activity on land. [...] It is not accidental that the Congo expedition remained an isolated event in Conrad&#x27;s life. Until his death he remained a recluse in the social sense and never became involved with any institution or clearly defined group of people.&quot;

==Citizenship==
Conrad was a Russian subject, having been born in the Russian part of what had once been the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. After his father&#x27;s death, Conrad&#x27;s uncle Bobrowski had attempted to secure Austrian citizenship for him—to no avail, probably because Conrad had not received permission from Russian authorities to remain abroad permanently and had not been released from being a Russian subject. Conrad could not return to the Russian Empire—he would have been liable to many years of military service and, as the son of political exiles, to harassment.

In a letter of 9 August 1877, Conrad&#x27;s uncle Bobrowski broached two important subjects: the desirability of Conrad&#x27;s naturalisation abroad (tantamount to release from being a Russian subject) and Conrad&#x27;s plans to join the British merchant marine. &quot;[D]o you speak English?... I never wished you to become naturalized in France, mainly because of the compulsory military service... I thought, however, of your getting naturalized in Switzerland...&quot; In his next letter, Bobrowski supported Conrad&#x27;s idea of seeking citizenship of the United States or of &quot;one of the more important Southern [American] Republics&quot;.

Eventually Conrad would make his home in England. On 2 July 1886 he applied for British nationality, which was granted on 19 August 1886. Yet, in spite of having become a subject of Queen Victoria, Conrad had not ceased to be a subject of Tsar Alexander III. To achieve his freedom from that subjection, he had to make many visits to the Russian Embassy in London and politely reiterate his request. He would later recall the Embassy&#x27;s home at Belgrave Square in his novel &quot;The Secret Agent&quot;. Finally, on 2 April 1889, the Russian Ministry of Home Affairs released &quot;the son of a Polish man of letters, captain of the British merchant marine&quot; from the status of Russian subject.

==Memorials==

An anchor-shaped monument to Conrad at Gdynia, on Poland&#x27;s Baltic Seacoast, features a quotation from him in Polish: &quot;Nic tak nie nęci, nie rozczarowuje i nie zniewala, jak życie na morzu&quot; (&quot;[T]here is nothing more enticing, disenchanting, and enslaving than the life at sea&quot; – ).

In Circular Quay, Sydney, Australia, a plaque in a &quot;writers walk&quot; commemorates Conrad&#x27;s visits to Australia between 1879 and 1892. The plaque notes that &quot;Many of his works reflect his &#x27;affection for that young continent.&#x27;&quot;
In San Francisco in 1979, a small triangular square at Columbus Avenue and Beach Street, near Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf, was dedicated as &quot;Joseph Conrad Square&quot; after Conrad. The square&#x27;s dedication was timed to coincide with the release of Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;-inspired film, &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;. Conrad does not appear to have ever visited San Francisco.

In the latter part of World War II, the Royal Navy cruiser &quot;HMS Danae&quot; was rechristened ORP &quot;Conrad&quot; and served as part of the Polish Navy.
Notwithstanding the undoubted sufferings that Conrad endured on many of his voyages, sentimentality and canny marketing place him at the best lodgings in several of his destinations. Hotels across the Far East still lay claim to him as an honoured guest, with, however, no evidence to back their claims: Singapore&#x27;s Raffles Hotel continues to claim he stayed there though he lodged, in fact, at the Sailors&#x27; Home nearby. His visit to Bangkok also remains in that city&#x27;s collective memory, and is recorded in the official history of The Oriental Hotel (where he never, in fact, stayed, lodging aboard his ship, the &quot;Otago&quot;) along with that of a less well-behaved guest, Somerset Maugham, who pilloried the hotel in a short story in revenge for attempts to eject him.

A plaque commemorating &quot;Joseph Conrad–Korzeniowski&quot; has been installed near Singapore&#x27;s Fullerton Hotel.

Conrad is also reported to have stayed at Hong Kong&#x27;s Peninsula Hotel—at a port that, in fact, he never visited. Later literary admirers, notably Graham Greene, followed closely in his footsteps, sometimes requesting the same room and perpetuating myths that have no basis in fact. No Caribbean resort is yet known to have claimed Conrad&#x27;s patronage, although he is believed to have stayed at a Fort-de-France &quot;pension&quot; upon arrival in Martinique on his first voyage, in 1875, when he travelled as a passenger on the &quot;Mont Blanc&quot;.

In April 2013, a monument to Conrad was unveiled in the Russian town of Vologda, where he and his parents lived in exile in 1862–63. The monument was removed, with unclear explanation, in June 2016.

==Legacy==
Conrad is regarded as one of the greatest writers in the English language. After the publication of &quot;Chance&quot; in 1913, he was the subject of more discussion and praise than any other English writer of the time. He had a genius for companionship, and his circle of friends, which he had begun assembling even prior to his first publications, included authors and other leading lights in the arts, such as Henry James, Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham, John Galsworthy, Galsworthy&#x27;s wife Ada Galsworthy (translator of French literature), Edward Garnett, Garnett&#x27;s wife Constance Garnett (translator of Russian literature), Stephen Crane, Hugh Walpole, George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells (whom Conrad dubbed &quot;the historian of the ages to come&quot;), Arnold Bennett, Norman Douglas, Jacob Epstein, T. E. Lawrence, André Gide, Paul Valéry, Maurice Ravel, Valery Larbaud, Saint-John Perse, Edith Wharton, James Huneker, anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski, Józef Retinger (later a founder of the European Movement, which led to the European Union, and author of &quot;Conrad and His Contemporaries&quot;). In the early 1900s Conrad composed a short series of novels in collaboration with Ford Madox Ford.

In 1919 and 1922 Conrad&#x27;s growing renown and prestige among writers and critics in continental Europe fostered his hopes for a Nobel Prize in Literature. It was apparently the French and Swedes—not the English—who favoured Conrad&#x27;s candidacy.

In April 1924 Conrad, who possessed a hereditary Polish status of nobility and coat-of-arms (&quot;Nałęcz&quot;), declined a (non-hereditary) British knighthood offered by Labour Party Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. Conrad kept a distance from official structures—he never voted in British national elections—and seems to have been averse to public honours generally; he had already refused honorary degrees from Cambridge, Durham, Edinburgh, Liverpool, and Yale universities.

In the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, translations of Conrad&#x27;s works were openly published, except for &quot;Under Western Eyes&quot;, which in the 1980s was published as an underground &quot;bibuła&quot;.

Conrad&#x27;s narrative style and anti-heroic characters have influenced many authors, including T. S. Eliot, Maria Dąbrowska, F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, Gerald Basil Edwards, Ernest Hemingway, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, André Malraux, George Orwell, Graham Greene, William Golding, William Burroughs, Saul Bellow, Gabriel García Márquez, Peter Matthiessen, John le Carré, V. S. Naipaul, Philip Roth, Joan Didion, Thomas Pynchon J. M. Coetzee, and Salman Rushdie. Many films have been adapted from, or inspired by, Conrad&#x27;s works.

==Impressions==
A portrait of Conrad, aged about 46, was drawn by the historian and poet Henry Newbolt, who met him about 1903:

On 12 October 1912, American music critic James Huneker visited Conrad and later recalled being received by &quot;a man of the world, neither sailor nor novelist, just a simple-mannered gentleman, whose welcome was sincere, whose glance was veiled, at times far-away, whose ways were French, Polish, anything but &#x27;literary,&#x27; bluff or English.&quot;

After respective separate visits to Conrad in August and September 1913, two British aristocrats, the socialite Lady Ottoline Morrell and the mathematician and philosopher Bertrand Russell—who were lovers at the time—recorded their impressions of the novelist. In her diary, Morrell wrote:

A month later, Bertrand Russell visited Conrad at Capel House in Orlestone, and the same day on the train wrote down his impressions:

Russell&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography&quot;, published over half a century later in 1968, confirms his original experience:

It was not only Anglophones who remarked Conrad&#x27;s strong foreign accent when speaking English. After French poet Paul Valéry and French composer Maurice Ravel made Conrad&#x27;s acquaintance in December 1922, Valéry wrote in 1924 of having been astonished at Conrad&#x27;s &quot;horrible&quot; accent in English.

The subsequent friendship and correspondence between Conrad and Russell lasted, with long intervals, to the end of Conrad&#x27;s life. In one letter, Conrad avowed his &quot;deep admiring affection, which, if you were never to see me again and forget my existence tomorrow will be unalterably yours &quot;&quot;.&quot; Conrad in his correspondence often used the Latin expression meaning &quot;to the very end&quot;, which he seems to have adopted from his faithful guardian, mentor and benefactor, his maternal uncle Tadeusz Bobrowski.

Conrad was less optimistic than Russell about the possibilities of scientific and philosophical knowledge. In a 1913 letter to acquaintances who had invited Conrad to join their society, he reiterated his belief that it was impossible to understand the essence of either reality or life: both science and art penetrate no further than the outer shapes.

Najder describes Conrad as &quot;[a]n alienated émigré... haunted by a sense of the unreality of other people – a feeling natural to someone living outside the established structures of family, social milieu, and country&quot;.

Conrad&#x27;s sense of loneliness throughout his life in exile found memorable expression in the 1901 short story &quot;Amy Foster&quot;.

<text>John Hoyer Updike (March 18, 1932 – January 27, 2009) was an American novelist, poet, short-story writer, art critic, and literary critic. One of only four writers to win the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction more than once (the others being Booth Tarkington, William Faulkner, and Colson Whitehead), Updike published more than twenty novels, more than a dozen short-story collections, as well as poetry, art and literary criticism and children&#x27;s books during his career.

Hundreds of his stories, reviews, and poems appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; starting in 1954. He also wrote regularly for &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. His most famous work is his &quot;Rabbit&quot; series (the novels &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot;; &quot;Rabbit Redux&quot;; &quot;Rabbit Is Rich&quot;; &quot;Rabbit at Rest&quot;; and the novella &quot;Rabbit Remembered&quot;), which chronicles the life of the middle-class everyman Harry &quot;Rabbit&quot; Angstrom over the course of several decades, from young adulthood to death. Both &quot;Rabbit Is Rich&quot; (1981) and &quot;Rabbit at Rest&quot; (1990) were awarded the Pulitzer Prize.

Describing his subject as &quot;the American small town, Protestant middle class&quot;, critics recognized his careful craftsmanship, his unique prose style, and his prolific outputa book a year on average. Updike populated his fiction with characters who &quot;frequently experience personal turmoil and must respond to crises relating to religion, family obligations, and marital infidelity&quot;.

His fiction is distinguished by its attention to the concerns, passions, and suffering of average Americans, its emphasis on Christian theology, and its preoccupation with sexuality and sensual detail. His work has attracted significant critical attention and praise, and he is widely considered one of the great American writers of his time. Updike&#x27;s highly distinctive prose style features a rich, unusual, sometimes arcane vocabulary as conveyed through the eyes of &quot;a wry, intelligent authorial voice that describes the physical world extravagantly while remaining squarely in the realist tradition&quot;. He described his style as an attempt &quot;to give the mundane its beautiful due&quot;.

==Early life and education==

Updike was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, the only child of Linda Grace (née Hoyer) and Wesley Russell Updike, and was raised at his childhood home in the nearby small town of Shillington. The family later moved to the unincorporated village of Plowville. His mother&#x27;s attempts to become a published writer impressed the young Updike. &quot;One of my earliest memories&quot;, he later recalled, &quot;is of seeing her at her desk ... I admired the writer&#x27;s equipment, the typewriter eraser, the boxes of clean paper. And I remember the brown envelopes that stories would go off in—and come back in.&quot;

These early years in Berks County, Pennsylvania, would influence the environment of the Rabbit Angstrom tetralogy, as well as many of his early novels and short stories. Updike graduated from Shillington High School as co-valedictorian and class president in 1950 and received a full scholarship to Harvard College, where he was the roommate of Christopher Lasch during their first year. Updike had already received recognition for his writing as a teenager by winning a Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Award, and at Harvard he soon became well known among his classmates as a talented and prolific contributor to &quot;The Harvard Lampoon&quot;, of which he was president. He studied with dramatist Robert Chapman, the director of Harvard&#x27;s Loeb Drama Center. He graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in 1954 with a degree in English and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.

Upon graduation, Updike attended the Ruskin School of Art at the University of Oxford with the ambition of becoming a cartoonist. After returning to the United States, Updike and his family moved to New York, where he became a regular contributor to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. This was the beginning of his professional writing career.

==Career as a writer==

===1950s===
Updike stayed at &quot;The New Yorker&quot; as a full staff writer for only two years, writing &quot;Talk of the Town&quot; columns and submitting poetry and short stories to the magazine. In New York, Updike wrote the poems and stories that came to fill his early books like &quot;The Carpentered Hen&quot; (1958) and &quot;The Same Door&quot; (1959). These works were influenced by Updike&#x27;s early engagement with &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. This early work also featured the influence of J. D. Salinger (&quot;A&amp;P&quot;); John Cheever (&quot;Snowing in Greenwich Village&quot;); and the Modernists Marcel Proust, Henry Green, James Joyce, and Vladimir Nabokov.

During this time, Updike underwent a profound spiritual crisis. Suffering from a loss of religious faith, he began reading Søren Kierkegaard and the theologian Karl Barth. Both deeply influenced his own religious beliefs, which in turn figured prominently in his fiction. He believed in Christianity for the remainder of his life. Updike said, &quot;As to critics, it seems to be my fate to disappoint my theological friends by not being Christian enough, while I&#x27;m too Christian for Harold Bloom&#x27;s blessing. So be it.&quot;

===1960s–1970s===
Later, Updike and his family relocated to Ipswich, Massachusetts. Many commentators, including a columnist in the local &quot;Ipswich Chronicle&quot;, asserted that the fictional town of Tarbox in &quot;Couples&quot; was based on Ipswich. Updike denied the suggestion in a letter to the paper. Impressions of Updike&#x27;s day-to-day life in Ipswich during the 1960s and 1970s are included in a letter to the same paper published soon after Updike&#x27;s death and written by a friend and contemporary. In Ipswich, Updike wrote &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot; (1960), on a Guggenheim Fellowship, and &quot;The Centaur&quot; (1963), two of his most acclaimed and famous works; the latter won the National Book Award.

&quot;Rabbit, Run&quot; featured Harry &quot;Rabbit&quot; Angstrom, a former high school basketball star and middle-class paragon who would become Updike&#x27;s most enduring and critically acclaimed character. Updike wrote three additional novels about him. &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot; was featured in &quot;Time&quot;″s All-TIME 100 Greatest Novels.

===Short stories===
Updike&#x27;s career and reputation were nurtured and expanded by his long association with &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, which published him frequently throughout his career, despite the fact that he had departed the magazine&#x27;s employment after only two years. Updike&#x27;s memoir indicates that he stayed in his &quot;corner of New England to give its domestic news&quot; with a focus on the American home from the point of view of a male writer. Updike&#x27;s contract with the magazine gave it right of first offer for his short-story manuscripts, but William Shawn, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;&#x27;s editor from 1952 to 1987, rejected several as too explicit.

The Maple short stories, collected in &quot;Too Far To Go&quot; (1979), reflected the ebb and flow of Updike&#x27;s first marriage; &quot;Separating&quot; (1974) and &quot;Here Come the Maples&quot; (1976) related to his divorce. These stories also reflect the role of alcohol in 1970s America. They were the basis for the television movie also called &quot;Too Far To Go&quot;, broadcast by NBC in 1979.

Updike&#x27;s short stories were collected in several volumes published by Alfred A. Knopf over five decades. In 2013, the Library of America issued a two-volume boxed edition of 186 stories under the title &quot;The Collected Stories&quot;.

===Novels===
In 1971, Updike published a sequel to &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot; called &quot;Rabbit Redux&quot;, his response to the 1960s; Rabbit reflected much of Updike&#x27;s resentment and hostility towards the social and political changes that beset the United States during that time.

Updike&#x27;s early Olinger period was set in the Pennsylvania of his youth; it ended around 1965 with the lyrical &quot;Of the Farm&quot;.

After his early novels, Updike became most famous for his chronicling infidelity, adultery, and marital unrest, especially in suburban America; and for his controversial depiction of the confusion and freedom inherent in this breakdown of social mores. He once wrote that it was &quot;a subject which, if I have not exhausted, has exhausted me&quot;. The most prominent of Updike&#x27;s novels in this vein is &quot;Couples&quot; (1968), about adultery in a fictional Massachusetts town. It garnered Updike an appearance on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine with the headline &quot;The Adulterous Society&quot;. &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s article and the novel contributed to national concern about whether U.S. society was abandoning its standards of conduct in sexual matters.

&quot;The Coup&quot; (1978), a lauded novel about an African dictatorship inspired by a visit he made to Africa, found Updike working in new territory.

===1980s–2000s===

In 1980, he published another novel featuring Harry Angstrom, &quot;Rabbit Is Rich&quot;, which won the National Book Award, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction—all three major American literary prizes. The novel found &quot;Rabbit the fat and happy owner of a Toyota dealership&quot;. Updike found it difficult to end the book, because he was &quot;having so much fun&quot; in the imaginary county Rabbit and his family inhabited.

After writing &quot;Rabbit Is Rich&quot;, Updike published &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot; (1984), a playful novel about witches living in Rhode Island. He described it as an attempt to &quot;make things right with my, what shall we call them, feminist detractors&quot;. One of Updike&#x27;s most popular novels, it was adapted as a film and included on Harold Bloom&#x27;s list of canonical 20th-century literature (in &quot;The Western Canon&quot;). In 2008 Updike published &quot;The Widows of Eastwick&quot;, a return to the witches in their old age. It was his last published novel.

In 1986, he published the unconventional &quot;Roger&#x27;s Version&quot;, the second volume of the so-called &quot;Scarlet Letter&quot; trilogy, about an attempt to prove God&#x27;s existence using a computer program. Author and critic Martin Amis called it a &quot;near-masterpiece&quot;. The novel &quot;S.&quot; (1989), uncharacteristically featuring a female protagonist, concluded Updike&#x27;s reworking of Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;.

Updike enjoyed working in series; in addition to the Rabbit novels and the Maples stories, a recurrent Updike alter ego is the moderately well-known, unprolific Jewish novelist and eventual Nobel laureate Henry Bech, chronicled in three comic short-story cycles: &quot;Bech, a Book&quot; (1970), &quot;Bech Is Back&quot; (1981) and &quot;Bech at Bay: A Quasi-Novel&quot; (1998). These stories were compiled as &quot;The Complete Henry Bech&quot; (2001) by Everyman&#x27;s Library. Bech is a comical and self-conscious antithesis of Updike&#x27;s own literary persona: Jewish, a World War II veteran, reclusive, and unprolific to a fault.

In 1990, he published the last Rabbit novel, &quot;Rabbit at Rest&quot;, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the National Book Critics Circle Award. Over 500 pages long, the novel is among Updike&#x27;s most celebrated. In 2000, Updike included the novella &quot;Rabbit Remembered&quot; in his collection &quot;Licks of Love&quot;, drawing the Rabbit saga to a close. His Pulitzers for the last two Rabbit novels make Updike one of only four writers to have won two Pulitzer Prizes for Fiction, the others being William Faulkner, Booth Tarkington, and Colson Whitehead.

In 1995, Everyman&#x27;s Library collected and canonized the four novels as the omnibus &quot;Rabbit Angstrom&quot;; Updike wrote an introduction in which he described Rabbit as &quot;a ticket to the America all around me. What I saw through Rabbit&#x27;s eyes was more worth telling than what I saw through my own, though the difference was often slight.&quot; Updike later called Rabbit &quot;a brother to me, and a good friend. He opened me up as a writer.&quot;

After the publication of &quot;Rabbit at Rest&quot;, Updike spent the rest of the 1990s and early 2000s publishing novels in a wide range of genres; the work of this period was frequently experimental in nature. These styles included the historical fiction of &quot;Memories of the Ford Administration&quot; (1992), the magical realism of &quot;Brazil&quot; (1994), the science fiction of &quot;Toward the End of Time&quot; (1997), the postmodernism of &quot;Gertrude and Claudius&quot; (2000), and the experimental fiction of &quot;Seek My Face&quot; (2002).

In the midst of these, he wrote what was for him a more conventional novel, &quot;In the Beauty of the Lilies&quot; (1996), a historical saga spanning several generations and exploring themes of religion and cinema in America. It is considered the most successful novel of Updike&#x27;s late career. Some critics have predicted that posterity may consider the novel a &quot;late masterpiece overlooked or praised by rote in its day, only to be rediscovered by another generation&quot;, while others, though appreciating the English mastery in the book, thought it overly dense with minute detail and swamped by its scenic depictions and spiritual malaise. In &quot;Villages&quot; (2004), Updike returned to the familiar territory of infidelities in New England. His 22nd novel, &quot;Terrorist&quot; (2006), the story of a fervent young extremist Muslim in New Jersey, garnered media attention but little critical praise.

In 2003, Updike published &quot;The Early Stories&quot;, a large collection of his short fiction spanning the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s. More than 800 pages long, with over one hundred stories, it has been called &quot;a richly episodic and lyrical &quot;Bildungsroman&quot; ... in which Updike traces the trajectory from adolescence, college, married life, fatherhood, separation and divorce&quot;. It won the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction in 2004. This lengthy volume nevertheless excluded several stories found in his short-story collections of the same period.

Updike worked in a wide array of genres, including fiction, poetry (most of it compiled in &quot;Collected Poems: 1953–1993&quot;, 1993), essays (collected in nine separate volumes), a play (&quot;Buchanan Dying&quot;, 1974), and a memoir (&quot;Self-Consciousness&quot;, 1989).

At the end of his life, Updike was working on a novel about St. Paul and early Christianity.

==Personal life and death==
Biographer Adam Begley wrote that Updike &quot;transmuted the minutiae of his life&quot; in prose, which enriched his readers at the cost of being &quot;willing to sacrifice the happiness of people around him for his art&quot;.

In 1953, while a student at Harvard, Updike married Mary Entwistle Pennington, an art student at Radcliffe College and daughter of a prominent Unitarian minister. She accompanied him to Oxford, England, where she attended art school and their first child, Elizabeth, was born in 1955. The couple had three more children together: David (born 1957), Michael (born 1959), and Miranda (born 1960).

Updike was serially unfaithful, and eventually left the marriage in 1974 for Martha Ruggles Bernhard. In 1977, Updike and Bernhard married. In 1982, his first wife married an MIT academic. Updike and Bernhard lived for more than 30 years in Beverly Farms, Massachusetts. Updike had three stepsons through Bernhard. He died of lung cancer at a hospice in Danvers, Massachusetts, on January 27, 2009, at age 76. He was survived by his wife, his four children, three stepsons, his first wife, and seven grandchildren and seven step-grandchildren.

==Poetry==
Updike published eight volumes of poetry over his career, including his first book &quot;The Carpentered Hen&quot; (1958), and one of his last, the posthumous &quot;Endpoint&quot; (2009). The &quot;New Yorker&quot; published excerpts of &quot;Endpoint&quot; in its March 16, 2009 issue. Much of Updike&#x27;s poetical output was recollected in Knopf&#x27;s &quot;Collected Poems&quot; (1993). He wrote that &quot;I began as a writer of light verse, and have tried to carry over into my serious or lyric verse something of the strictness and liveliness of the lesser form.&quot; The poet Thomas M. Disch noted that because Updike was such a well-known novelist, his poetry &quot;could be mistaken as a hobby or a foible&quot;; Disch saw Updike&#x27;s light verse instead as a poetry of &quot;epigrammatical lucidity&quot;. His poetry has been praised for its engagement with &quot;a variety of forms and topics&quot;, its &quot;wit and precision&quot;, and for its depiction of topics familiar to American readers.

British poet Gavin Ewart praised Updike for the metaphysical quality of his poetry and for his ability &quot;to make the ordinary seem strange&quot;, and called him one of the few modern novelists capable of writing good poetry. Reading &quot;Endpoint&quot; aloud, the critic Charles McGrath claimed that he found &quot;another, deeper music&quot; in Updike&#x27;s poetry, finding that Updike&#x27;s wordplay &quot;smooths and elides itself&quot; and has many subtle &quot;sound effects&quot;. John Keenan, who praised the collection &quot;Endpoint&quot; as &quot;beautiful and poignant&quot;, noted that his poetry&#x27;s engagement with &quot;the everyday world in a technically accomplished manner seems to count against him&quot;.

==Literary criticism and art criticism==
Updike was also a critic of literature and art, one frequently cited as one of the best American critics of his generation. In the introduction to &quot;Picked-Up Pieces,&quot; his 1975 collection of prose, he listed his personal rules for literary criticism:

#Try to understand what the author wished to do, and do not blame him for not achieving what he did not attempt.
#Give enough direct quotation—at least one extended passage—of the book&#x27;s prose so the review&#x27;s reader can form his own impression, can get his own taste.
#Confirm your description of the book with quotation from the book, if only phrase-long, rather than proceeding by fuzzy précis.
#Go easy on plot summary, and do not give away the ending.
#If the book is judged deficient, cite a successful example along the same lines, from the author&#x27;s œuvre or elsewhere. Try to understand the failure. Sure it&#x27;s his and not yours?

To these concrete five might be added a vaguer sixth, having to do with maintaining a chemical purity in the reaction between product and appraiser. Do not accept for review a book you are predisposed to dislike, or committed by friendship to like. Do not imagine yourself a caretaker of any tradition, an enforcer of any party standards, a warrior in any ideological battle, a corrections officer of any kind. Never, never ... try to put the author &quot;in his place,&quot; making of him a pawn in a contest with other reviewers. Review the book, not the reputation. Submit to whatever spell, weak or strong, is being cast. Better to praise and share than blame and ban. The communion between reviewer and his public is based upon the presumption of certain possible joys of reading, and all our discriminations should curve toward that end.

He reviewed &quot;nearly every major writer of the 20th century and some 19th-century authors&quot;, typically in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, always trying to make his reviews &quot;animated&quot;. He also championed young writers, comparing them to his own literary heroes including Vladimir Nabokov and Marcel Proust. Good reviews from Updike were often seen as a significant achievement in terms of literary reputation and even sales; some of his positive reviews helped jump-start the careers of such younger writers as Erica Jong, Thomas Mallon and Jonathan Safran Foer.

Bad reviews by Updike sometimes caused controversy, as when in late 2008 he gave a &quot;damning&quot; review of Toni Morrison&#x27;s novel &quot;A Mercy&quot;.

Updike was praised for his literary criticism&#x27;s conventional simplicity and profundity, for being an aestheticist critic who saw literature on its own terms, and for his longtime commitment to the practice of literary criticism.

Much of Updike&#x27;s art criticism appeared in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, where he often wrote about American art. His art criticism involved an aestheticism like that of his literary criticism.

Updike&#x27;s 2008 Jefferson Lecture, &quot;The Clarity of Things: What&#x27;s American About American Art?&quot;, dealt with the uniqueness of American art from the 18th century to the 20th. In the lecture he argued that American art, until the expressionist movement of the 20th century in which America declared its artistic &quot;independence&quot;, is characterized by an insecurity not found in the artistic tradition of Europe.

In Updike&#x27;s own words:

Two centuries after Jonathan Edwards sought a link with the divine in the beautiful clarity of things, William Carlos Williams wrote in introducing his long poem &quot;Paterson&quot; that &quot;for the poet there are no ideas but in things.&quot; &quot;No ideas but in things.&quot; The American artist, first born into a continent without museums and art schools, took Nature as his only instructor, and things as his principal study. A bias toward the empirical, toward the evidential object in the numinous fullness of its being, leads to a certain lininess, as the artist intently maps the visible in a New World that feels surrounded by chaos and emptiness.

==Critical reputation and style==
Updike is considered one of the greatest American fiction writers of his generation. He was widely praised as America&#x27;s &quot;last true man of letters&quot;, with an immense and far-reaching influence on many writers. The excellence of his prose style is acknowledged even by critics skeptical of other aspects of Updike&#x27;s work.

Several scholars have called attention to the importance of place, and especially of southeast Pennsylvania, in Updike&#x27;s life and work. Bob Batchelor has described &quot;Updike&#x27;s Pennsylvania sensibility&quot; as one with profound reaches that transcend time and place, such that in his writing, he used &quot;Pennsylvania as a character&quot; that went beyond geographic or political boundaries. SA Zylstra has compared Updike&#x27;s Pennsylvania to Faulkner&#x27;s Mississippi: &quot;As with the Mississippi of Faulkner&#x27;s novels, the world of Updike&#x27;s novels is fictional (as are such towns as Olinger and Brewer), while at the same time it is recognizable as a particular American region.&quot; Sanford Pinsker observes that &quot;Updike always felt a bit out of place&quot; in places like &quot;Ipswich, Massachusetts, where he lived for most of his life. In his heart—and, more important, in his imagination—Updike remained a staunchly Pennsylvania boy.&quot; Similarly, Sylvie Mathé maintains that &quot;Updike&#x27;s most memorable legacy appears to be his homage to Pennsylvania.&quot;

Critics emphasize his &quot;inimitable prose style&quot; and &quot;rich description and language&quot;, often favorably compared to Proust and Nabokov. Some critics consider the fluency of his prose to be a fault, questioning the intellectual depth and thematic seriousness of his work given the polish of his language and the perceived lightness of his themes, while others criticized Updike for misogynistic depictions of women and sexual relationships.

Other critics argue that Updike&#x27;s &quot;dense vocabulary and syntax functions as a distancing technique to mediate the intellectual and emotional involvement of the reader&quot;. On the whole, however, Updike is extremely well regarded as a writer who mastered many genres, wrote with intellectual vigor and a powerful prose style, with &quot;shrewd insight into the sorrows, frustrations, and banality of American life&quot;.

Updike&#x27;s character Harry &quot;Rabbit&quot; Angstrom, the protagonist of the series of novels widely considered his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, has been said to have &quot;entered the pantheon of signal American literary figures&quot;, along with Huckleberry Finn, Jay Gatsby, Holden Caulfield and others. A 2002 list by &quot;Book&quot; magazine of the 100 Best Fictional Characters Since 1900 listed Rabbit in the top five. The Rabbit novels, the Henry Bech stories, and the Maples stories have been canonized by Everyman&#x27;s Library.

After Updike&#x27;s death, Harvard&#x27;s Houghton Library acquired his papers, manuscripts, and letters, naming the collection the John Updike Archive. 2009 also saw the founding of the John Updike Society, a group of scholars dedicated to &quot;awakening and sustaining reader interest in the literature and life of John Updike, promoting literature written by Updike, and fostering and encouraging critical responses to Updike&#x27;s literary works&quot;. The Society will begin publishing &quot;The John Updike Review&quot;, a journal of critical scholarship in the field of Updike studies. The John Updike Society First Biennial Conference took place in 2010 at Alvernia University.

Eulogizing Updike in January 2009, the British novelist Ian McEwan wrote that Updike&#x27;s &quot;literary schemes and pretty conceits touched at points on the Shakespearean&quot;, and that Updike&#x27;s death marked &quot;the end of the golden age of the American novel in the 20th century&#x27;s second half&quot;.

McEwan said the Rabbit series is Updike&#x27;s &quot;masterpiece and will surely be his monument&quot;, and concluded:

Jonathan Raban, highlighting many of the virtues that have been ascribed to Updike&#x27;s prose, called &quot;Rabbit at Rest&quot; &quot;one of the very few modern novels in English ... that one can set beside the work of Dickens, Thackeray, George Eliot, Joyce, and not feel the draft ... It is a book that works by a steady accumulation of a mass of brilliant details, of shades and nuances, of the byplay between one sentence and the next, and no short review can properly honor its intricacy and richness.&quot;

The novelist Philip Roth, considered one of Updike&#x27;s chief literary rivals, wrote, &quot;John Updike is our time&#x27;s greatest man of letters, as brilliant a literary critic and essayist as he was a novelist and short story writer. He is and always will be no less a national treasure than his 19th-century precursor, Nathaniel Hawthorne.&quot;

The noted critic James Wood called Updike &quot;a prose writer of great beauty, but that prose confronts one with the question of whether beauty is enough, and whether beauty always conveys all that a novelist must convey&quot;. In a review of &quot;Licks of Love&quot; (2001), Wood concluded that Updike&#x27;s &quot;prose trusses things in very pretty ribbons&quot; but that there often exists in his work a &quot;hard, coarse, primitive, misogynistic worldview&quot;. Wood both praised and criticized Updike&#x27;s language for having &quot;an essayistic saunter; the language lifts itself up on pretty hydraulics, and hovers slightly above its subjects, generally a little too accomplished and a little too abstract&quot;. According to Wood, Updike is capable of writing &quot;the perfect sentence&quot; and his style is characterized by a &quot;delicate deferral&quot; of the sentence. Of the beauty of Updike&#x27;s language and his faith in the power of language that floats above reality, Wood wrote:

For some time now Updike&#x27;s language has seemed to encode an almost theological optimism about its capacity to refer. Updike is notably unmodern in his impermeability to silence and the interruptions of the abyss. For all his fabled Protestantism, both American Puritan and Lutheran-Barthian, with its cold glitter, its insistence on the aching gap between God and His creatures, Updike seems less like Hawthorne than Balzac, in his unstopping and limitless energy, and his cheerfully professional belief that stories can be continued; the very form of the Rabbit books—here extended a further instance—suggests continuance. Updike does not appear to believe that words ever fail us—&#x27;life&#x27;s gallant, battered ongoingness &#x27;, indeed—and part of the difficulty he has run into, late in his career, is that he shows no willingness, verbally, to acknowledge silence, failure, interruption, loss of faith, despair and so on. Supremely, better than almost any other contemporary writer, he can always describe these feelings and states; but they are not inscribed in the language itself. Updike&#x27;s language, for all that it gestures towards the usual range of human disappointment and collapse, testifies instead to its own uncanny success: to a belief that the world can always be brought out of its cloudiness and made clear in a fair season.

In direct contrast to Wood&#x27;s evaluation, the Oxford critic Thomas Karshan asserted that Updike is &quot;intensely intellectual&quot;, with a style that constitutes his &quot;manner of thought&quot; not merely &quot;a set of dainty curlicues&quot;. Karshan calls Updike an inheritor of the &quot;traditional role of the epic writer&quot;. According to Karshan, &quot;Updike&#x27;s writing picks up one voice, joins its cadence, and moves on to another, like Rabbit himself, driving south through radio zones on his flight away from his wife and child.&quot;

Disagreeing with Wood&#x27;s critique of Updike&#x27;s alleged over-stylization, Karshan evaluates Updike&#x27;s language as convincingly naturalistic:

Updike&#x27;s sentences at their frequent best are not a complacent expression of faith. Rather, like Proust&#x27;s sentences in Updike&#x27;s description, they &quot;seek an essence so fine the search itself is an act of faith.&quot; Updike aspires to &quot;this sense of self-qualification, the kind of timid reverence towards what exists that Cézanne shows when he grapples for the shape and shade of a fruit through a mist of delicate stabs.&quot; Their hesitancy and self-qualification arise as they meet obstacles, readjust and pass on. If life is bountiful in New England, it is also evasive and easily missed. In the stories Updike tells, marriages and homes are made only to be broken. His descriptiveness embodies a promiscuous love for everything in the world. But love is precarious, Updike is always saying, since it thrives on obstructions and makes them if it cannot find them.

Harold Bloom once called Updike &quot;a minor novelist with a major style. A quite beautiful and very considerable stylist ... He specializes in the easier pleasures.&quot; Bloom also edited an important collection of critical essays on Updike in 1987, in which he concluded that Updike possessed a major style and was capable of writing beautiful sentences which are &quot;beyond praise&quot;; nevertheless, Bloom went on, &quot;the American sublime will never touch his pages&quot;.

On &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; in 1981, the novelist and short-story writer John Cheever was asked why he did not write book reviews and what he would say if given the chance to review &quot;Rabbit Is Rich&quot;. He replied:

The reason I didn&#x27;t review the book is that it perhaps would have taken me three weeks. My appreciation of it is that diverse and that complicated ... John is perhaps the only contemporary writer who I know now who gives me the sense of the fact that life is—the life that we perform is in an environment that enjoys a grandeur that escapes us. Rabbit is very much possessed of a paradise lost, of a paradise known fleetingly perhaps through erotic love and a paradise that he pursues through his children. It&#x27;s the vastness of John&#x27;s scope that I would have described if I could through a review.

&quot;The Fiction Circus&quot;, an online and multimedia literary magazine, called Updike one of the &quot;four Great American Novelists&quot; of his time along with Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy, and Don DeLillo, each jokingly represented as a sign of the Zodiac. Furthermore, Updike was seen as the &quot;best prose writer in the world&quot;, like Nabokov before him. But in contrast to many literati and establishment obituaries, the &quot;Circus&quot; asserted that nobody &quot;thought of Updike as a &quot;vital&quot; writer&quot;.

Adam Gopnik of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; evaluated Updike as &quot;the first American writer since Henry James to get himself fully expressed, the man who broke the curse of incompleteness that had haunted American writing ... He sang like Henry James, but he saw like Sinclair Lewis. The two sides of American fiction—the precise, realist, encyclopedic appetite to get it all in, and the exquisite urge to make writing out of sensation rendered exactly—were both alive in him.&quot;

The critic James Wolcott, in a review of Updike&#x27;s last novel, &quot;The Widows of Eastwick&quot; (2008), noted that Updike&#x27;s penchant for observing America&#x27;s decline is coupled with an affirmation of America&#x27;s ultimate merits: &quot;Updike elegises entropy American-style with a resigned, paternal, disappointed affection that distinguishes his fiction from that of grimmer declinists: Don DeLillo, Gore Vidal, Philip Roth. America may have lost its looks and stature, but it was a beauty once, and worth every golden dab of sperm.&quot;

Gore Vidal, in a controversial essay in the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;, professed to have &quot;never taken Updike seriously as a writer&quot;. He criticizes his political and aesthetic worldview for its &quot;blandness and acceptance of authority in any form&quot;. He concludes that Updike &quot;describes to no purpose&quot;. In reference to Updike&#x27;s wide establishment acclaim, Vidal mockingly called him &quot;our good child&quot; and excoriated his alleged political conservatism. Vidal ultimately concluded, &quot;Updike&#x27;s work is more and more representative of that polarizing within a state where Authority grows ever more brutal and malign while its hired hands in the media grow ever more excited as the holy war of the few against the many heats up.&quot;

Robert B. Silvers, editor of &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, called Updike &quot;one of the most elegant and coolly observant writers of his generation&quot;. The short-story writer Lorrie Moore, who once called Updike &quot;American literature&#x27;s greatest short story writer ... and arguably our greatest writer&quot;, reviewed Updike&#x27;s body of short stories in &quot;The New York Review&quot;, praising their intricate detail and rich imagery: &quot;his eye and his prose never falter, even when the world fails to send its more socially complicated revelations directly his story&#x27;s way&quot;. In her work on Updike, Biljana Dojčinović has argued that his short story collection &quot;The Afterlife and Other Stories&quot; is a pivotal work that demonstrates a change in his writing on feminism.

Updike&#x27;s array of awards includes two Pulitzer Prizes for Fiction, two National Book Awards, three National Book Critics Circle awards, the 1989 National Medal of Arts, the 2003 National Humanities Medal, and the Rea Award for the Short Story for outstanding achievement. The National Endowment for the Humanities selected Updike to present the 2008 Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. government&#x27;s highest humanities honor; Updike&#x27;s lecture was titled &quot;The Clarity of Things: What Is American about American Art&quot;. In November 2008, the editors of the UK&#x27;s &quot;Literary Review&quot; magazine awarded Updike their Bad Sex in Fiction Lifetime Achievement Award, which celebrates &quot;crude, tasteless or ridiculous sexual passages in modern literature&quot;.

==Themes==

The principal themes in Updike&#x27;s work are religion, sex, America, and death. He often combined them, especially in his favored terrain of &quot;the American small town, Protestant middle class&quot;, of which he once said, &quot;I like middles. It is in middles that extremes clash, where ambiguity restlessly rules.&quot;

For example, the decline of religion in America is chronicled in &quot;In the Beauty of the Lilies&quot; (1996) alongside the history of cinema, and Rabbit Angstrom contemplates the merits of sex with the wife of his friend Reverend Jack Eccles while the latter is giving his sermon in &quot;Rabbit, Run&quot; (1960).

Critics have often noted that Updike imbued language itself with a kind of faith in its efficacy, and that his tendency to construct narratives spanning many years and books—the Rabbit series, the Henry Bech series, Eastwick, the Maples stories—demonstrates a similar faith in the transcendent power of fiction and language. Updike&#x27;s novels often act as dialectical theological debates between the book itself and the reader, the novel endowed with theological beliefs meant to challenge the reader as the plot runs its course. Rabbit Angstrom himself acts as a Kierkegaardian Knight of Faith.

Describing his purpose in writing prose in the introduction to his &quot;Early Stories: 1953–1975&quot; (2004), Updike wrote that his aim was always &quot;to give the mundane its beautiful due&quot;. Elsewhere he famously said, &quot;When I write, I aim my mind not towards New York City but towards a vague spot east of Kansas.&quot; Some have suggested that the &quot;best statement of Updike&#x27;s aesthetic comes in his early memoir &#x27;The Dogwood Tree&#x27;&quot; (1962): &quot;Blankness is not emptiness; we may skate upon an intense radiance we do not see because we see nothing else. And in fact there is a color, a quiet but tireless goodness that things at rest, like a brick wall or a small stone, seem to affirm.&quot;

===Sex===
Sex in Updike&#x27;s work is noted for its ubiquity and the reverence with which he described it:

The critic Edward Champion notes that Updike&#x27;s prose heavily favors &quot;external sexual imagery&quot; rife with &quot;explicit anatomical detail&quot; rather than descriptions of &quot;internal emotion&quot; in descriptions of sex. In Champion&#x27;s interview with Updike on &quot;The Bat Segundo Show&quot;, Updike replied that he perhaps favored such imagery to concretize and make sex &quot;real&quot; in his prose. Another sexual theme commonly addressed in Updike is adultery, especially in a suburban, middle class setting, most famously in &quot;Couples&quot; (1968). The Updikean narrator is often &quot;a man guilty of infidelity and abandonment of his family&quot;.

===United States===
Similarly, Updike wrote about America with a certain nostalgia, reverence, and recognition and celebration of America&#x27;s broad diversity. ZZ Packer wrote that in Updike, &quot;there seemed a strange ability to harken both America the Beautiful as well as America the Plain Jane, and the lovely Protestant backbone in his fiction and essays, when he decided to show it off, was as progressive and enlightened as it was unapologetic.&quot;

The Rabbit novels in particular can be viewed, according to Julian Barnes, as &quot;a distraction from, and a glittering confirmation of, the vast bustling ordinariness of American life&quot;. But as Updike celebrated ordinary America, he also alluded to its decline: at times, he was &quot;so clearly disturbed by the downward spin of America&quot;. Adam Gopnik concludes that &quot;Updike&#x27;s great subject was the American attempt to fill the gap left by faith with the materials produced by mass culture. He documented how the death of a credible religious belief has been offset by sex and adultery and movies and sports and Toyotas and family love and family obligation. For Updike, this effort was blessed, and very nearly successful.&quot;

Updike&#x27;s novels about America almost always contain references to political events of the time. In this sense, they are artifacts of their historical eras, showing how national leaders shape and define their times. The lives of ordinary citizens take place against this wider background.

===Death===
Updike often wrote about death, his characters providing a &quot;mosaic of reactions&quot; to mortality, ranging from terror to attempts at insulation. In &quot;The Poorhouse Fair&quot; (1959), the elderly John Hook intones, &quot;There is no goodness without belief ... And if you have not believed, at the end of your life you shall know you have buried your talent in the ground of this world and have nothing saved, to take into the next&quot;, demonstrating a religious, metaphysical faith present in much of Updike&#x27;s work.

For Rabbit Angstrom, with his constant musings on mortality, his near-witnessing of his daughter&#x27;s death, and his often shaky faith, death is more frightening and less obvious in its ramifications. At the end of &quot;Rabbit at Rest&quot; (1990), though, Rabbit demonstrates a kind of certainty, telling his son Nelson on his deathbed, &quot;... But enough. Maybe. Enough.&quot; In &quot;The Centaur&quot; (1963), George Caldwell has no religious faith and is afraid of his cancer. Death can also be a sort of unseen terror; it &quot;occurs offstage but reverberates for survivors as an absent presence&quot;.

Updike himself also experienced a &quot;crisis over the afterlife&quot;, and indeed

many of his heroes shared the same sort of existential fears the author acknowledged he had suffered as a young man: Henry Bech&#x27;s concern that he was &#x27;a fleck of dust condemned to know it is a fleck of dust,&#x27; or Colonel Ellelloû&#x27;s lament that &#x27;we will be forgotten, all of us forgotten.&#x27; Their fear of death threatens to make everything they do feel meaningless, and it also sends them running after God—looking for some reassurance that there is something beyond the familiar, everyday world with &#x27;its signals and buildings and cars and bricks.&#x27;

Updike demonstrated his own fear in some of his more personal writings, including the poem &quot;Perfection Wasted&quot; (1990):

<text>John Ernst Steinbeck ( ; February 27, 1902 – December 20, 1968) was an American writer. He won the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for his realistic and imaginative writings, combining as they do sympathetic humor and keen social perception&quot;. He has been called &quot;a giant of American letters.&quot;

During his writing career, he authored 33 books, with one book coauthored alongside Edward Ricketts, including 16 novels, six non-fiction books, and two collections of short stories. He is widely known for the comic novels &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot; (1935) and &quot;Cannery Row&quot; (1945), the multigeneration epic &quot;East of Eden&quot; (1952), and the novellas &quot;The Red Pony&quot; (1933) and &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; (1937). The Pulitzer Prize–winning &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1939) is considered Steinbeck&#x27;s masterpiece and part of the American literary canon. By the 75th anniversary of its publishing date, it had sold 14 million copies.

Much of Steinbeck&#x27;s work employs settings in his native central California, particularly in the Salinas Valley and the California Coast Ranges region. His works frequently explored the themes of fate and injustice, especially as applied to downtrodden or everyman protagonists.

==Early life==

Steinbeck was born on February 27, 1902, in Salinas, California. He was of German, English, and Irish descent. Johann Adolf Großsteinbeck (1828–1913), Steinbeck&#x27;s paternal grandfather, was a founder of Mount Hope, a short-lived farming colony in Palestine that disbanded after Arab attackers killed his brother and raped his brother&#x27;s wife and mother-in-law. He arrived in the United States in 1858, shortening the family name to Steinbeck. The family farm in Heiligenhaus, Mettmann, Germany, is still named &quot;Großsteinbeck&quot;.

His father, John Ernst Steinbeck (1862–1935), served as Monterey County treasurer. John&#x27;s mother, Olive Hamilton (1867–1934), a former school teacher, shared Steinbeck&#x27;s passion for reading and writing. The Steinbecks were members of the Episcopal Church, although Steinbeck later became agnostic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson J. Benson 1984 https://archive.org/details/trueadventuresof00bens/page/248 248&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Steinbeck lived in a small rural valley (no more than a frontier settlement) set in fertile soil, about 25 miles from the Pacific Coast. Both valley and coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. He spent his summers working on nearby ranches including the Post Ranch in Big Sur. He later labored with migrant workers on Spreckels sugar beet farms. There he learned of the harsher aspects of the migrant life and the darker side of human nature, which supplied him with material expressed in &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;. He explored his surroundings, walking across local forests, fields, and farms. While working at Spreckels Sugar Company, he sometimes worked in their laboratory, which gave him time to write. He had considerable mechanical aptitude and fondness for repairing things he owned.
Steinbeck graduated from Salinas High School in 1919 and went on to study English literature at Stanford University near Palo Alto, leaving without a degree in 1925. He traveled to New York City where he took odd jobs while trying to write. When he failed to publish his work, he returned to California and worked in 1928 as a tour guide and caretaker at Lake Tahoe, where he met Carol Henning, his first wife. They married in January 1930 in Los Angeles, where, with friends, he attempted to make money by manufacturing plaster mannequins.

When their money ran out six months later due to a slow market, Steinbeck and Carol moved back to Pacific Grove, California, to a cottage owned by his father, on the Monterey Peninsula a few blocks outside the Monterey city limits. The elder Steinbecks gave John free housing, paper for his manuscripts, and from 1928, loans that allowed him to write without looking for work. During the Great Depression, Steinbeck bought a small boat, and later claimed that he was able to live on the fish and crabs that he gathered from the sea, and fresh vegetables from his garden and local farms. When those sources failed, Steinbeck and his wife accepted welfare, and on rare occasions, stole bacon from the local produce market. Whatever food they had, they shared with their friends. Carol became the model for Mary Talbot in Steinbeck&#x27;s novel &quot;Cannery Row&quot;.

In 1930, Steinbeck met the marine biologist Ed Ricketts, who became a close friend and mentor to Steinbeck during the following decade, teaching him a great deal about philosophy and biology. Ricketts, usually very quiet, yet likable, with an inner self-sufficiency and an encyclopedic knowledge of diverse subjects, became a focus of Steinbeck&#x27;s attention. Ricketts had taken a college class from Warder Clyde Allee, a biologist and ecological theorist, who would go on to write a classic early textbook on ecology. Ricketts became a proponent of ecological thinking, in which man was only one part of a great chain of being, caught in a web of life too large for him to control or understand. Meanwhile, Ricketts operated a biological lab on the coast of Monterey, selling biological samples of small animals, fish, rays, starfish, turtles, and other marine forms to schools and colleges.

Between 1930 and 1936, Steinbeck and Ricketts became close friends. Steinbeck&#x27;s wife began working at the lab as secretary-bookkeeper. Steinbeck helped on an informal basis. They formed a common bond based on their love of music and art, and John learned biology and Ricketts&#x27;s ecological philosophy. When Steinbeck became emotionally upset, Ricketts sometimes played music for him.

==Career==

===Writing===
Steinbeck&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Cup of Gold&quot;, published in 1929, is loosely based on the life and death of privateer Henry Morgan. It centers on Morgan&#x27;s assault and sacking of Panamá Viejo, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Cup of Gold&quot;, and on the women, brighter than the sun, who were said to be found there. In 1930, Steinbeck wrote a werewolf murder mystery, &quot;Murder at Full Moon&quot;, that has never been published because Steinbeck considered it unworthy of publication.

Between 1930 and 1933, Steinbeck produced three shorter works. &quot;The Pastures of Heaven&quot;, published in 1932, consists of twelve interconnected stories about a valley near Monterey, which was discovered by a Spanish corporal while chasing runaway Indian slaves. In 1933 Steinbeck published &quot;The Red Pony&quot;, a 100-page, four-chapter story weaving in memories of Steinbeck&#x27;s childhood. &quot;To a God Unknown&quot;, named after a Vedic hymn, follows the life of a homesteader and his family in California, depicting a character with a primal and pagan worship of the land he works.

Before his novel &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot; (1935), Steinbeck was an obscure writer &quot;with little success&quot;. Although he had not achieved the status of a well-known writer, he never doubted that he would achieve greatness.

Steinbeck achieved his first critical success with &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot;, a novel set in post-war Monterey, California, that won the California Commonwealth Club&#x27;s gold medal. It portrays the adventures of a group of classless and usually homeless young men in Monterey after World War I, just before U.S. prohibition. They are portrayed in ironic comparison to mythic knights on a quest and reject nearly all the standard mores of American society in enjoyment of a dissolute life devoted to wine, lust, camaraderie and petty theft. In presenting the 1962 Nobel Prize to Steinbeck, the Swedish Academy cited &quot;spicy and comic tales about a gang of &quot;paisanos&quot;, asocial individuals who, in their wild revels, are almost caricatures of King Arthur&#x27;s Knights of the Round Table. It has been said that in the United States this book came as a welcome antidote to the gloom of the then prevailing depression.&quot; &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot; was adapted as a 1942 film of the same name, starring Spencer Tracy, Hedy Lamarr and John Garfield, a friend of Steinbeck. With some of the proceeds, he built a summer ranch-home in Los Gatos.

Steinbeck began to write a series of &quot;California novels&quot; and Dust Bowl fiction, set among common people during the Great Depression. These included &quot;In Dubious Battle&quot;, &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; and &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;. He also wrote an article series called &quot;The Harvest Gypsies&quot; for the &quot;San Francisco News&quot; about the plight of the migrant worker.

&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; was a drama about the dreams of two migrant agricultural laborers in California. Steinbeck, on vacations to Mexico, witnessed sold-out theater troupes with often poor and illiterate workers consisting of the audience. As such, Steinbeck chose to write &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; with a stage play in mind. It was critically acclaimed and Steinbeck&#x27;s 1962 Nobel Prize citation called it a &quot;little masterpiece&quot;.
Its stage production was a hit, starring Wallace Ford as George and Broderick Crawford as George&#x27;s companion, the mentally childlike, but physically powerful itinerant farmhand Lennie. Steinbeck refused to travel from his home in California to attend any performance of the play during its New York run, telling director George S. Kaufman that the play as it existed in his own mind was &quot;perfect&quot; and that anything presented on stage would only be a disappointment. Steinbeck wrote two more stage plays (&quot;The Moon Is Down&quot; and &quot;Burning Bright&quot;).

&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; was also adapted as a 1939 Hollywood film, with Lon Chaney Jr. as Lennie (he had filled the role in the Los Angeles stage production) and Burgess Meredith as George. Meredith and Steinbeck became close friends for the next two decades. Another film based on the novella was made in 1992 starring Gary Sinise as George and John Malkovich as Lennie.

Steinbeck followed this wave of success with &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1939), based on newspaper articles about migrant agricultural workers that he had written in San Francisco. In August 1936, the San Francisco News asked Steinbeck to personally interview multiple families in the impoverished Hoovervilles of the San Joaquin Valley. As Steinbeck visited the slums that hugged the highways across the Central Valley, he was harrowed by what he saw. He talked with multiple families and vowed to make a book depicting their struggles. It is commonly considered his greatest work. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, it was the best-selling book of 1939 and 430,000 copies had been printed by February 1940. In that month, it won the National Book Award, favorite fiction book of 1939, voted by members of the American Booksellers Association. Later that year, it won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and was adapted as a film directed by John Ford, starring Henry Fonda as Tom Joad; Fonda was nominated for the best actor Academy Award. &quot;Grapes&quot; was controversial. Steinbeck&#x27;s New Deal political views, negative portrayal of aspects of capitalism, and sympathy for the plight of workers, led to a backlash against the author for displaying communist views, especially in his hometown of Salinas. Steinbeck received so many threats that he purchased a handgun for his own safety. Claiming the book both was obscene and misrepresented conditions in the county, the Kern County Board of Supervisors banned the book from the county&#x27;s publicly funded schools and libraries in August 1939. This ban lasted until January 1941.

Of the controversy, Steinbeck wrote, &quot;The vilification of me out here from the large landowners and bankers is pretty bad. The latest is a rumor started by them that the Okies hate me and have threatened to kill me for lying about them. I&#x27;m frightened at the rolling might of this damned thing. It is completely out of hand; I mean a kind of hysteria about the book is growing that is not healthy.&quot;

The then First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, already a fan of Steinbeck&#x27;s work from &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, defended Steinbeck&#x27;s work in her nationally syndicated newspaper column, &quot;My Day&quot;. She wrote: &quot;Now I must tell you that I have just finished a book which is an unforgettable experience in reading. The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck, both repels and attracts you. The horrors of the picture, so well drawn, make you dread sometimes to begin the next chapter, and yet you cannot lay the book down or even skip a page.&quot; After visiting California labor camps in 1940, a reporter asked her if she believed that &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; was exaggerated. Roosevelt responded, &quot;I have never believed that The Grapes of Wrath was exaggerated&quot;.

===Ed Ricketts===
In the 1930s and 1940s, Ed Ricketts strongly influenced Steinbeck&#x27;s writing. Steinbeck frequently took small trips with Ricketts along the California coast to give himself time off from his writing and to collect biological specimens, which Ricketts sold for a living. Their coauthored book, &quot;Sea of Cortez&quot; (December 1941), about a collecting expedition to the Gulf of California in 1940, which was part travelogue and part natural history, published just as the U.S. entered World War II, never found an audience and did not sell well. However, in 1951, Steinbeck republished the narrative portion of the book as &quot;The Log from the Sea of Cortez&quot;, under his name only (though Ricketts had written some of it). This work remains in print today.

Although Carol accompanied Steinbeck on the trip, their marriage was beginning to suffer, and ended a year later, in 1941, even as Steinbeck worked on the manuscript for the book. In 1942, after his divorce from Carol he married Gwyndolyn &quot;Gwyn&quot; Conger.

Ricketts was Steinbeck&#x27;s model for the character of &quot;Doc&quot; in &quot;Cannery Row&quot; (1945) and &quot;Sweet Thursday&quot; (1954), &quot;Friend Ed&quot; in &quot;Burning Bright&quot;, and characters in &quot;In Dubious Battle&quot; (1936) and &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1939). Ecological themes recur in Steinbeck&#x27;s novels of the period.

Steinbeck&#x27;s close relations with Ricketts ended in 1941 when Steinbeck moved away from Pacific Grove and divorced his wife Carol. Ricketts&#x27;s biographer Eric Enno Tamm opined that, except for &quot;East of Eden&quot; (1952), Steinbeck&#x27;s writing declined after Ricketts&#x27;s untimely death in 1948.

===World War II===

Steinbeck&#x27;s novel &quot;The Moon Is Down&quot; (1942), about the Socrates-inspired spirit of resistance in an occupied village in Northern Europe, was made into a film almost immediately. It was presumed that the unnamed country of the novel was Norway and the occupiers the Germans. In 1945, Steinbeck received the King Haakon VII Freedom Cross for his literary contributions to the Norwegian resistance movement.

In 1943, Steinbeck served as a World War II war correspondent for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; and worked with the Office of Strategic Services (predecessor of the CIA). It was at that time he became friends with Will Lang Jr. of &quot;Time&quot;/&quot;Life&quot; magazine. During the war, Steinbeck accompanied the commando raids of Douglas Fairbanks Jr.&#x27;s Beach Jumpers program, which launched small-unit diversion operations against German-held islands in the Mediterranean. At one point, he accompanied Fairbanks on an invasion of an island off the coast of Italy and used a Thompson submachine gun to help capture Italian and German prisoners. Some of his writings from this period were incorporated in the documentary &quot;Once There Was a War&quot; (1958).

Steinbeck returned from the war with a number of wounds from shrapnel and some psychological trauma. He treated himself, as ever, by writing. He wrote Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s movie, &quot;Lifeboat&quot; (1944), and with screenwriter Jack Wagner, &quot;A Medal for Benny&quot; (1945), about paisanos from &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot; going to war. He later requested that his name be removed from the credits of &quot;Lifeboat,&quot; because he believed the final version of the film had racist undertones. In 1944, bruised, battered, and homesick, Steinbeck wrote &quot;Cannery Row&quot; (1945), a love letter to the city of Monterey. In 1958, Ocean View Avenue in Monterey, the setting of the book, was renamed Cannery Row in his honor.
After the war, he wrote &quot;The Pearl&quot; (1947), knowing it would be filmed eventually. Steinbeck&#x27;s relationship with Hollywood had solidified to the point where his books were being green-lit as movies as they released. The story first appeared in the December 1945 issue of &quot;Woman&#x27;s Home Companion&quot; magazine as &quot;The Pearl of the World&quot;. It was illustrated by John Alan Maxwell. The novel is an imaginative telling of a story which Steinbeck had heard in La Paz in 1940, as related in &quot;The Log From the Sea of Cortez&quot;, which he described in Chapter 11 as being &quot;so much like a parable that it almost can&#x27;t be&quot;. Steinbeck traveled to Cuernavaca, Mexico for the filming with Wagner who helped with the script; on this trip he would be inspired by the story of Emiliano Zapata, and subsequently wrote a film script (&quot;Viva Zapata!&quot;) directed by Elia Kazan and starring Marlon Brando and Anthony Quinn.

In 1947, Steinbeck made his first trip to the Soviet Union with photographer Robert Capa. They visited Moscow, Kyiv, Tbilisi, Batumi and Stalingrad, some of the first Americans to visit many parts of the USSR since the communist revolution. Steinbeck&#x27;s 1948 book about their experiences, &quot;A Russian Journal&quot;, was illustrated with Capa&#x27;s photos. In 1948, the year the book was published, Steinbeck was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

===New York===
Over the course of 276 days in 1952, Steinbeck wrote the first draft of &quot;East of Eden,&quot; a book he considered his ultimate test as a writer. He wrote a daily letter to his editor while writing the book. Through them, Steinbeck explored himself, his creative process, his love for writing, and his family life, for he had just married his third wife, Elaine Scott, the year prior. Steinbeck, according to Elaine Scott, considered &quot;East of Eden&quot; his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, his greatest novel. As the book was released, he wrote to John Beskow, a Swedish artist and a confidant of his: &quot;I have put all the things I have wanted to write all my life. This is &#x27;the book&#x27;... having done this, I can do anything I want&quot;. Also in 1952, John Steinbeck appeared as the on-screen narrator of 20th Century Fox&#x27;s film, &quot;O. Henry&#x27;s Full House&quot;. Although Steinbeck later admitted he was uncomfortable before the camera, he provided interesting introductions to several filmed adaptations of short stories by the legendary writer O. Henry. About the same time, Steinbeck recorded readings of several of his short stories for Columbia Records; the recordings provide a record of Steinbeck&#x27;s deep, resonant voice.

Following the success of &quot;Viva Zapata!&quot;, Steinbeck collaborated with Kazan on the 1955 film &quot;East of Eden&quot;, James Dean&#x27;s movie debut. Jack Moffitt of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, in a review that appeared after the March 1955 premiere, wrote &quot;Beautifully acted, and superbly directed by Elia Kazan, it is bound to be one of the year’s important contributions to screen literature.&quot;

From March to October 1959, Steinbeck and his third wife Elaine rented a cottage in the hamlet of Discove, Redlynch, near Bruton in Somerset, England, while Steinbeck researched his retelling of the Arthurian legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. Glastonbury Tor was visible from the cottage, and Steinbeck also visited the nearby hillfort of Cadbury Castle, the supposed site of King Arthur&#x27;s court of Camelot. The unfinished manuscript was published after his death in 1976, as &quot;The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights&quot;. Steinbeck grew up enthralled by the stories of King Arthur, and the Steinbecks recounted the time spent in Somerset as the happiest of their life together.
&quot;Travels with Charley: In Search of America&quot; is a travelogue of his 1960 road trip with his poodle Charley. Steinbeck bemoans his lost youth and roots, while dispensing both criticism and praise for the United States. According to Steinbeck&#x27;s son Thom, Steinbeck made the journey because he knew he was dying and wanted to see the country one last time.

Steinbeck&#x27;s last novel, &quot;The Winter of Our Discontent&quot; (1961), examines moral decline in the United States. The protagonist Ethan grows discontented with his own moral decline and that of those around him. The book has a very different tone from Steinbeck&#x27;s amoral and ecological stance in earlier works such as &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot; and &quot;Cannery Row&quot;. It was not a critical success. Many reviewers recognized the importance of the novel but were disappointed that it was not another &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot;.
In the Nobel Prize presentation speech the next year, however, the Swedish Academy cited it most favorably: &quot;Here he attained the same standard which he set in The Grapes of Wrath. Again he holds his position as an independent expounder of the truth with an unbiased instinct for what is genuinely American, be it good or bad.&quot;

Apparently taken aback by the critical reception of this novel, and the critical outcry when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962, Steinbeck published no more fiction in the remaining six years before his death.

===Nobel Prize===
In 1962, Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize for literature for his &quot;realistic and imaginative writing, combining as it does sympathetic humor and keen social perception&quot;. The selection was heavily criticized, and described as &quot;one of the Academy&#x27;s biggest mistakes&quot; in one Swedish newspaper. The reaction of American literary critics was also harsh. &quot;The New York Times&quot; asked why the Nobel committee gave the award to an author whose &quot;limited talent is, in his best books, watered down by tenth-rate philosophising&quot;, noting that &quot;[T]he international character of the award and the weight attached to it raise questions about the mechanics of selection and how close the Nobel committee is to the main currents of American writing. ... [W]e think it interesting that the laurel was not awarded to a writer ... whose significance, influence and sheer body of work had already made a more profound impression on the literature of our age&quot;. Steinbeck, when asked on the day of the announcement if he deserved the Nobel, replied: &quot;Frankly, no.&quot; Biographer Jackson Benson notes, &quot;[T]his honor was one of the few in the world that one could not buy nor gain by political maneuver. It was precisely because the committee made its judgment ... on its own criteria, rather than plugging into &#x27;the main currents of American writing&#x27; as defined by the critical establishment, that the award had value.&quot; In his acceptance speech later in the year in Stockholm, he said:

Fifty years later, in 2012, the Nobel Prize opened its archives and it was revealed that Steinbeck was a &quot;compromise choice&quot; among a shortlist consisting of Steinbeck, British authors Robert Graves and Lawrence Durrell, French dramatist Jean Anouilh and Danish author Karen Blixen. The declassified documents showed that he was chosen as the best of a bad lot. &quot;There aren&#x27;t any obvious candidates for the Nobel prize and the prize committee is in an unenviable situation,&quot; wrote committee member Henry Olsson. Although the committee believed Steinbeck&#x27;s best work was behind him by 1962, committee member Anders Österling believed the release of his novel &quot;The Winter of Our Discontent&quot; showed that &quot;after some signs of slowing down in recent years, [Steinbeck has] regained his position as a social truth-teller [and is an] authentic realist fully equal to his predecessors Sinclair Lewis and Ernest Hemingway.&quot;

Although modest about his own talent as a writer, Steinbeck talked openly of his own admiration of certain writers. In 1953, he wrote that he considered cartoonist Al Capp, creator of the satirical &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, &quot;possibly the best writer in the world today&quot;. At his own first Nobel Prize press conference he was asked his favorite authors and works and replied: &quot;Hemingway&#x27;s short stories and nearly everything Faulkner wrote.&quot;

In September 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson awarded Steinbeck the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

In 1967, at the behest of &quot;Newsday&quot; magazine, Steinbeck went to Vietnam to report on the war. He thought of the Vietnam War as a heroic venture and was considered a hawk for his position on the war. His sons served in Vietnam before his death, and Steinbeck visited one son in the battlefield. At one point he was allowed to man a machine-gun watch position at night at a firebase while his son and other members of his platoon slept.

==Personal life==

Steinbeck and his first wife, Carol Henning, married in January 1930 in Los Angeles. By 1940, their marriage was beginning to suffer, and it ended a year later. In 1942, after his divorce from Carol, Steinbeck married Gwyndolyn &quot;Gwyn&quot; Conger. With his second wife Steinbeck had two sons, Thomas (&quot;Thom&quot;) Myles Steinbeck (1944–2016) and John Steinbeck IV (1946–1991).

In May 1948, Steinbeck returned to California on an emergency trip to be with his friend Ed Ricketts, who had been seriously injured when a train struck his car. Ricketts died hours before Steinbeck arrived. Upon returning home, Steinbeck was confronted by Gwyn, who asked for a divorce, which became final in October. Steinbeck spent the year after Ricketts&#x27;s death in deep depression.

In June 1949, Steinbeck met stage manager Elaine Scott at a restaurant in Carmel, California. Steinbeck and Scott eventually began a relationship, and in December 1950 they married, within a week of Scott&#x27;s finalizing her own divorce from actor Zachary Scott. This third marriage for Steinbeck lasted until his death in 1968.

Steinbeck was an acquaintance of modernist poet Robinson Jeffers, a Californian neighbor. In a letter to Elizabeth Otis, Steinbeck wrote: &quot;Robinson Jeffers and his wife came in to call the other day. He looks a little older but that is all. And she is just the same.&quot;

In 1962, Steinbeck began acting as friend and mentor to the young writer and naturalist Jack Rudloe, who was trying to establish his own biological supply company, now Gulf Specimen Marine Laboratory in Florida. Their correspondence continued until Steinbeck&#x27;s death.

In February 1966, Steinbeck and his wife traveled to Israel. He visited in Tel Aviv the site of Mount Hope, a farm community established by his grandfather, whose brother, Friedrich Großsteinbeck, had been murdered by Arab marauders in 1858 during the Outrages at Jaffa.

==Death and legacy==

John Steinbeck died in New York City, where his writing career had begun, on December 20, 1968, during the 1968 flu pandemic of heart disease and congestive heart failure. He was 66, and had been a lifelong smoker. An autopsy showed nearly complete occlusion of the main coronary arteries.

In accordance with his wishes, his body was cremated, and interred on March 4, 1969 at the Hamilton family gravesite in Salinas, with those of his parents and maternal grandparents. His third wife, Elaine, was buried in the plot in 2004. He had written to his doctor that he felt deeply &quot;in his flesh&quot; that he would not survive his physical death, and that the biological end of his life was the final end to it.

Steinbeck&#x27;s incomplete novel based on the King Arthur legends of Malory and others, &quot;The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights&quot;, was published in 1976.

Many of Steinbeck&#x27;s works are required reading in American high schools. In England, &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; was one of the key texts used by the examining body AQA for its English Literature GCSE until its removal from the reformed specification that was first examined in June 2018. Following concerns about racist language used in the book, it was also removed from the English Literature GCSE syllabus in Wales, along with &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird,&quot; by WJEC. It continues to be studied in Northern Ireland, although calls have also been made for its removal there too. A study by the Center for the Learning and Teaching of Literature in the United States found that &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; was one of the ten most frequently read books in public high schools. Steinbeck&#x27;s works have also been banned. &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; was banned in August 1939 by the Kern County Board of Supervisors from the county&#x27;s publicly funded schools and libraries. It was burned in Salinas on two occasions. In 2003, a school board in Mississippi banned it on the grounds of profanity. According to the American Library Association, Steinbeck was one of the ten most frequently banned authors from 1990 to 2004, with &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; ranking sixth out of 100 such books in the United States.

===Literary influences===
Steinbeck grew up in California&#x27;s Salinas Valley, a culturally diverse place with a rich migratory and immigrant history. This upbringing imparted a regionalistic flavor to his writing, giving many of his works a distinct sense of place.
Salinas, Monterey and parts of the San Joaquin Valley were the setting for many of his stories. The area is now sometimes referred to as &quot;Steinbeck Country&quot;. Most of his early work dealt with subjects familiar to him from his formative years. An exception was his first novel, &quot;Cup of Gold&quot;, which concerns the pirate/privateer Henry Morgan, whose adventures had captured Steinbeck&#x27;s imagination as a child.

In his subsequent novels, Steinbeck found a more authentic voice by drawing upon direct memories of his life in California. His childhood friend, Max Wagner, a brother of Jack Wagner and who later became a film actor, served as inspiration for &quot;The Red Pony&quot;. Later he used actual American conditions and events in the first half of the 20th century, which he had experienced first-hand as a reporter. Steinbeck often populated his stories with struggling characters; his works examined the lives of the working class and migrant workers during the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression.

His later work reflected his wide range of interests, including marine biology, politics, religion, history and mythology. One of his last published works was &quot;Travels with Charley&quot;, a travelogue of a road trip he took in 1960 to rediscover America.

===Commemoration===

Steinbeck&#x27;s boyhood home, a turreted Victorian building in downtown Salinas, has been preserved and restored by the Valley Guild, a nonprofit organization. Fixed menu lunches are served Monday through Saturday, and the house is open for tours on Sunday afternoons during the summer.

The National Steinbeck Center is two blocks away at 1 Main Street. Dana Gioia (chair of the National Endowment for the Arts) told an audience at the center, &quot;This is really the best modern literary shrine in the country, and I&#x27;ve seen them all.&quot; Its &quot;Steinbeckiana&quot; includes &quot;Rocinante&quot;, the camper-truck in which Steinbeck made the cross-country trip described in &quot;Travels with Charley&quot;.

His father&#x27;s cottage on Eleventh Street in Pacific Grove, where Steinbeck wrote some of his earliest books, also survives.

In Monterey, Ed Ricketts&#x27;s laboratory survives (though it is not yet open to the public), and at the corner that Steinbeck describes in &quot;Cannery Row&quot;, also the store that once belonged to Lee Chong and the adjacent vacant lot frequented by the hoboes of Cannery Row. The site of the Hovden Sardine Cannery next to Doc&#x27;s laboratory is now occupied by the Monterey Bay Aquarium. In 1958, the street that Steinbeck described as &quot;Cannery Row&quot; in the novel, once named Ocean View Avenue, was renamed Cannery Row in honor of the novel. The town of Monterey has commemorated Steinbeck&#x27;s work with an avenue of flags depicting characters from &quot;Cannery Row&quot;, historical plaques, and sculptured busts depicting Steinbeck and Ricketts.

On February 27, 1979 (the 77th anniversary of the writer&#x27;s birth), the United States Postal Service issued a stamp featuring Steinbeck, starting the Postal Service&#x27;s Literary Arts series honoring American writers.

Steinbeck was inducted in to the DeMolay International Hall of Fame in 1995.

On December 5, 2007, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver inducted Steinbeck into the California Hall of Fame, located at the California Museum for History, Women and the Arts. His son, author Thomas Steinbeck, accepted the award on his behalf.

Monterey Bay Roller Derby was founded in 2010. Their team names over the years have referenced Steinbeck, including Beasts of Eden, Cannery Rollers, Steinwreckers and Babes of Wrath. Their juniors league was known as the Dread Ponies.

To commemorate the 112th anniversary of Steinbeck&#x27;s birthday on February 27, 2014, Google displayed an interactive doodle utilizing animation which included illustrations portraying scenes and quotes from several novels by the author.

Steinbeck and his friend Ed Ricketts appear as fictionalized characters in the 2016 novel, &quot;Monterey Bay&quot; about the founding of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, by Lindsay Hatton (Penguin Press).

In February 2016, Caltrans installed signage to identify a five-mile segment of U.S. Route 101 in Salinas as the John Steinbeck Highway, in accordance with a 2014 state legislative resolution.

In 2019 the Sag Harbor town board approved the creation of the John Steinbeck Waterfront Park across from the iconic town windmill. The structures on the parcel were demolished and park benches installed near the beach. The Beebe windmill replica already had a plaque memorializing the author who wrote from a small hut overlooking the cove during his sojourn in the literary haven.

==Religious views==
Steinbeck was affiliated to the St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church and he stayed attached throughout his life to Episcopalianism although Steinbeck later became agnostic. Especially in his works of fiction, Steinbeck was highly conscious of religion and incorporated it into his style and themes. The shaping of his characters often drew on the Bible and the theology of Anglicanism, combining elements of Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.

Steinbeck distanced himself from religious views when he left Salinas for Stanford. However, the work he produced still reflected the language of his childhood at Salinas, and his beliefs remained a powerful influence within his fiction and non-fiction work. William Ray considered his Episcopal views are prominently displayed in &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, in which themes of conversion and self-sacrifice play a major part in the characters Casy and Tom, who achieve spiritual transcendence through conversion.

==Political views==

Steinbeck&#x27;s contacts with leftist authors, journalists, and labor union figures may have influenced his writing. He joined the League of American Writers, a Communist organization, in 1935. Steinbeck was mentored by radical writers Lincoln Steffens and his wife Ella Winter. Through Francis Whitaker, a member of the Communist Party USA&#x27;s John Reed Club for writers, Steinbeck met with strike organizers from the Cannery and Agricultural Workers&#x27; Industrial Union. In 1939, he signed a letter with some other writers in support of the Soviet invasion of Finland and the Soviet-established puppet government.

Documents released by the Central Intelligence Agency in 2012 indicate that Steinbeck offered his services to the Agency in 1952, while planning a European tour, and the Director of Central Intelligence, Walter Bedell Smith, was eager to take him up on the offer. What work, if any, Steinbeck may have performed for the CIA during the Cold War is unknown. Documents released by the Security Service of Ukraine following the Revolution of Dignity in 2014 indicate that the Soviet KGB suspected him of being an American agent when he visited locations within the USSR, including Kyiv, in 1947. Consequently, they watched Steinbeck closely and solicited information about him from their informers.

Steinbeck was a close associate of playwright Arthur Miller. In June 1957, Steinbeck took a personal and professional risk by supporting him when Miller refused to name names in the House Un-American Activities Committee trials. Steinbeck called the period one of the &quot;strangest and most frightening times a government and people have ever faced&quot;.

In 1963, Steinbeck visited the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic at the behest of President John F. Kennedy. During his visit he sat for a rare portrait by painter Martiros Saryan and visited Geghard Monastery. He also met with Armenian poet Hovhannes Shiraz in Yerevan. Steinbeck&#x27;s letter of thanks for Shiraz&#x27;s hospitality is now displayed at the Shiraz house museum in Gyumri. Footage of this visit filmed by Rafael Aramyan was sold in 2013 by his granddaughter.

In 1967, when he was sent to Vietnam to report on the war, his sympathetic portrayal of the United States Army led the &quot;New York Post&quot; to denounce him for betraying his leftist past. Steinbeck&#x27;s biographer, Jay Parini, says Steinbeck&#x27;s friendship with President Lyndon B. Johnson influenced his views on Vietnam. Steinbeck may also have been concerned about the safety of his son serving in Vietnam. Steinbeck opposed the anti-war movement in the United States, denouncing the &quot;fallout, drop-out, cop-out insurgency of our children and young people, the rush to stimulant as well as hypnotic drugs, the rise of narrow, ugly, and vengeful cults of all kinds, the mistrust and revolt against all authority – this in a time of plenty such as has never been known.&quot;

Along with Albert Einstein, Steinbeck was one of the sponsors of the Peoples&#x27; World Convention (PWC), also known as Peoples&#x27; World Constituent Assembly (PWCA), which took place in 1950–51 at Palais Electoral, Geneva, Switzerland.

===Government harassment===
Steinbeck complained publicly about government harassment. Thomas Steinbeck, the author&#x27;s eldest son, said that J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the FBI at the time, could find no basis for prosecuting Steinbeck and therefore used his power to encourage the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to audit Steinbeck&#x27;s taxes every single year of his life, just to annoy him. According to Thomas, a true artist is one who &quot;without a thought for self, stands up against the stones of condemnation, and speaks for those who are given no real voice in the halls of justice, or the halls of government. By doing so, these people will naturally become the enemies of the political status quo.&quot;

In a 1942 letter to United States Attorney General Francis Biddle, John Steinbeck wrote: &quot;Do you suppose you could ask Edgar&#x27;s boys to stop stepping on my heels? They think I am an enemy alien. It is getting tiresome.&quot; The FBI denied that Steinbeck was under investigation.

==Major works==

===&quot;Tortilla Flat&quot;===
Steinbeck&#x27;s first commercial success, published in 1935, is an episodic fiction recounting adventures of a loosely attached group of delinquent locals in a shabby coastal district of California. Like other books of Steinbeck&#x27;s, &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot; was adapted into a feature film.

===&quot;In Dubious Battle&quot;===
In 1936, Steinbeck published the first of what came to be known as his Dust Bowl trilogy, which included &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; and &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;. This first novel tells the story of a fruit pickers&#x27; strike in California which is both aided and damaged by the help of &quot;the Party&quot;, generally taken to be the Communist Party, although this is never spelled out in the book.

===&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;===
&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is a 1937 tragic novel that Steinbeck rewrote as a play that same year. The story is about two traveling ranch workers, George and Lennie, trying to earn enough money to buy their own farm/ranch. As it is set in 1930s America, it provides an insight into The Great Depression, encompassing themes of racism, loneliness, prejudice against the mentally ill, and the struggle for personal independence. Along with &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, &quot;East of Eden&quot;, and &quot;The Pearl&quot;, &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; is one of Steinbeck&#x27;s best known works. It was made into movies three times: in 1939, starring Burgess Meredith, Lon Chaney Jr., and Betty Field; in 1981, starring Randy Quaid, Robert Blake and Ted Neeley; and in 1992, starring Gary Sinise and John Malkovich.

===&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;===
&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; was published during the Great Depression and had a contemporary setting, describing a family of sharecroppers, the Joads, who were driven from their land by the dust storms of the Dust Bowl. The title is a reference to the Battle Hymn of the Republic. Some critics found it too sympathetic to the workers&#x27; plight and too critical of capitalism, but it found a large audience of its own. It won both the National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize for fiction (novels) and was adapted as a film starring Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell and directed by John Ford.

===&quot;Cannery Row&quot;===
The 1945 novel tells of a marine biologist in a seedy district dotted with sardine canneries in Monterey, California, who is feted by colorful neighbors in gratitude for his kindness to them. &quot;Cannery Row&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Sweet Thursday&quot;, were adapted into a movie in 1982.

===&quot;East of Eden&quot;===
Steinbeck deals with the nature of good and evil in this 1952 Salinas Valley saga. The story follows two families: the Hamiltons – based on Steinbeck&#x27;s own maternal ancestry – and the Trasks, reprising stories about the biblical Adam and his progeny. His paternal ancestry is also reflected in the story. The book was published in 1952. Portions of the novel were made into a 1955 movie directed by Elia Kazan and starring James Dean.

===&quot;Travels with Charley&quot;===
In 1960, Steinbeck bought a pickup truck and had it modified with a custom-built camper topwhich was rare at the timeand drove across the United States with his faithful &quot;blue&quot; standard poodle, Charley. Steinbeck nicknamed his truck &quot;Rocinante&quot; after Don Quixote&#x27;s &quot;noble steed&quot;. In this sometimes comical, sometimes melancholic book, Steinbeck describes what he sees as he travels from Maine to Montana to California, and from there to Texas and Louisiana and back to his home on Long Island. However, in 2011, after his death, a reporter who had followed &quot;Travels with Charley&quot;″s trail using the author&#x27;s own diaries controverted the book&#x27;s accuracy, casting Steinbeck&#x27;s claimed reportage as largely fictionalized, allegations supported by scholars and Steinbeck&#x27;s son John.

The restored camper truck is on exhibit in the National Steinbeck Center in Salinas.

<doc id="15826" wikidata="Q194402" url="?curid=15826" title="Joshua Reynolds">
<text>Sir Joshua Reynolds (16 July 1723 – 23 February 1792) was an English painter who specialised in portraits. The art critic John Russell called him one of the major European painters of the 18th century, while Lucy Peltz says he was &quot;the leading portrait artist of the 18th-century and arguably one of the greatest artists in the history of art.&quot; He promoted the &quot;Grand Style&quot; in painting, which depended on idealisation of the imperfect. He was a founder and first president of the Royal Academy of Arts and was knighted by George III in 1769.

Reynolds had a famously prolific studio that produced over 2,000 paintings during his lifetime. EK Waterhouse estimated those works the painter did ‘think worthy’ at ‘hardly less than a hundred paintings which one would like to take into consideration, either for their success, their originality, or their influence.&#x27; Of these, &quot;Portrait of Omai&quot; is probably his best known work and has been described by Simon Schama as &quot;one of the greatest things British art has ever produced [and] one of the all time, timeless masterpieces that painting can produce.&quot; EK Waterhouse considered the &quot;Marlborough family&quot; as &#x27;the most monumental achievement of British portraiture&#x27; and that &#x27;Reynolds&#x27; genius came to full flower in the diversity and geniality he was able to give to his full-length portraits&#x27; like &quot;Portrait of Philip Gell&quot; and &quot;Portrait of the Earl of Carlisle&quot;.Thomas Lawrence rated &quot;Sarah Siddons as the Tragic Muse&quot; as &quot;indisputably the finest female portrait in the world.&quot; Neil Jeffares adds that &quot;Portrait of Robert Orme&quot; was &#x27;surely one of the great eighteenth-century European portraits.&#x27; The price paid for the exceptional &quot;Portrait of Omai&quot; in 2023 was £50 million – far more than had ever been paid for an 18th-century picture. This was followed two years later by the sale of the iconic full-length &quot;Portrait of Lady Worsley&quot; for £25 million.

==Early life==
Reynolds was born in Plympton, Devon, on 16 July 1723, as the third son of the Reverend Samuel Reynolds (1681–1745), master of the Plympton Free Grammar School in the town. His father had been a fellow of Balliol College, Oxford, but did not send any of his sons to the university.
One of his sisters, seven years his senior, was Mary Palmer (1716–1794), author of &quot;Devonshire Dialogue&quot;, whose fondness for drawing is said to have had much influence on Joshua as a boy. In 1740, she provided £60, half of the premium paid to Thomas Hudson the portrait-painter, for Joshua&#x27;s pupillage, and nine years later advanced money for his expenses in Italy. His other siblings included Frances Reynolds (1729–1807) and Elizabeth Johnson (1721–1800).

As a boy, he also came under the influence of Zachariah Mudge, whose Platonistic philosophy stayed with him all his life. Reynolds made extracts in his commonplace book from Theophrastus, Plutarch, Seneca, Marcus Antonius, Ovid, William Shakespeare, John Milton, Alexander Pope, John Dryden, Joseph Addison, Richard Steele, and Aphra Behn and copied passages on art theory by Leonardo da Vinci, Charles Alphonse Du Fresnoy, and André Félibien. The work that came to have the most influence on Reynolds was Jonathan Richardson&#x27;s &quot;An Essay on the Theory of Painting&quot; (1715). Reynolds&#x27; annotated copy was lost for nearly two hundred years until it appeared in a Cambridge bookshop, inscribed with the signature &quot;J. Reynolds Pictor&quot;. It is now in the collection of the Royal Academy of Arts, London.

==Career==

Having shown an early interest in art, Reynolds was apprenticed in 1740 to the fashionable London portrait painter Thomas Hudson, who like Reynolds had been born in Devon. Hudson had a collection of Old Master drawings, including some by Guercino, of which Reynolds made copies. Although apprenticed to Hudson for a period of four years, Reynolds remained with him only until the summer of 1743. Having left Hudson, Reynolds worked for some time as a portrait-painter in Plymouth Dock (now Devonport). He returned to London before the end of 1744, but following his father&#x27;s death in late 1745 he shared a house in Plymouth Dock with his sisters.

In 1749, Reynolds met Commodore Augustus Keppel, who invited him to join HMS &quot;Centurion&quot;, of which he had command, on a voyage to the Mediterranean. While with the ship he visited Lisbon, Cadiz, Algiers and Minorca. From Minorca he travelled to Livorno in Italy, and then to Rome, where he spent two years, studying the Old Masters and acquiring a taste for the &quot;Grand Style&quot;. Lord Edgcumbe, who had known Reynolds as a boy and introduced him to Keppel, suggested he should study with Pompeo Batoni, the leading painter in Rome, but Reynolds replied that he had nothing to learn from him. While in Rome he suffered a severe cold, which left him partially deaf, and, as a result, he began to carry the small ear trumpet with which he is often pictured.

Reynolds travelled homeward overland via Florence, Bologna, Venice, and Paris. He was accompanied by Giuseppe Marchi, then aged about 17. Apart from a brief interlude in 1770, Marchi remained in Reynolds&#x27; employment as a studio assistant for the rest of the artist&#x27;s career. Following his arrival in England in October 1752, Reynolds spent three months in Devon before establishing himself in London the following year and remaining there for the rest of his life. He took rooms in St Martin&#x27;s Lane, before moving to Great Newport Street; his sister Frances acted as his housekeeper. He achieved success rapidly, and was extremely prolific. Lord Edgecumbe recommended the Duke of Devonshire and Duke of Grafton to sit for him, and other peers followed, including the Duke of Cumberland, third son of George II, in whose portrait, according to Nicholas Penny &quot;bulk is brilliantly converted into power&quot;. In 1760, Reynolds moved into a large house, with space to show his works and accommodate his assistants, on the west side of Leicester Fields (now Leicester Square).

Alongside ambitious full-length portraits, Reynolds painted large numbers of smaller works. In the late 1750s, at the height of the social season, he received five or six sitters a day, each for an hour. By 1761, Reynolds could command a fee of 80 guineas for a full-length portrait; in 1764, he was paid 100 guineas for a portrait of Lord Burghersh.

The clothing of Reynolds&#x27; sitters was usually painted by either one of his pupils, his studio assistant Giuseppe Marchi, or the specialist drapery painter Peter Toms. James Northcote, his pupil, wrote of this arrangement that &quot;the imitation of particular stuffs is not the work of genius, but is to be acquired easily by practice, and this was what his pupils could do by care and time more than he himself chose to bestow; but his own slight and masterly work was still the best.&quot; Lay figures were used to model the clothes.

Reynolds often adapted the poses of his subjects from the works of earlier artists, a practice mocked by Nathaniel Hone in a painting called &quot;The Conjuror&quot; submitted to the Royal Academy exhibition of 1775, and now in the collection of the National Gallery of Ireland. It shows a figure representing, though not resembling, Reynolds, seated in front of a cascade of prints from which Reynolds had borrowed with varying degrees of subtlety.

Although not known principally for his landscapes, Reynolds did paint in this genre. He had an excellent vantage from his house, Wick House, on Richmond Hill, and painted the view in about 1780.
Reynolds also was recognised for his portraits of children. He emphasised the innocence and natural grace of children when depicting them. His 1788 portrait, &quot;Age of Innocence&quot;, is his best known character study of a child. The subject of the painting is not known, although suggestions include Theophila Gwatkin, his great-niece, and Lady Anne Spencer, the youngest daughter of the fourth Duke of Marlborough.

===The Club===
Reynolds worked long hours in his studio, rarely taking a holiday. He was gregarious and keenly intellectual, with many friends from London&#x27;s intelligentsia, numbered among whom were Dr Samuel Johnson, Oliver Goldsmith, Edmund Burke, Giuseppe Baretti, Henry Thrale, David Garrick, and artist Angelica Kauffman, exchanging his portrait of her for a portrait of him by Kauffman. Johnson said in 1778: &quot;Reynolds is too much under [Charles James] Fox and Burke at present. He is under the &quot;Fox star&quot; and the &quot;Irish constellation&quot; (meaning Burke). He is always under some planet&quot;.

Because of his popularity as a portrait painter, Reynolds enjoyed constant interaction with the wealthy and famous men and women of the day, and it was he who brought together the figures of &quot;The Club&quot;. It was founded in 1764 and met in a suite of rooms on the first floor of the Turks Head at 9 Gerrard Street, now marked by a plaque. Original members included Burke, Bennet Langton, Topham Beauclerk, Goldsmith, Anthony Chamier, Thomas Hawkins, and Nugent, to be joined by Garrick, Boswell, and Sheridan. In ten years the membership had risen to 35. The Club met every Monday evening for supper and conversation and continued into the early hours of Tuesday morning. In later years, it met fortnightly during Parliamentary sessions. When in 1783 the landlord of the Turks Head died and the property was sold, The Club moved to Sackville Street.

===Royal Academy===

Reynolds was one of the earliest members of the Royal Society of Arts, helped found the Society of Artists of Great Britain, and in 1768 became the first president of the Royal Academy of Arts, a position he was to hold until his death. In 1769, he was knighted by George III, only the second English artist to be so honoured. His &quot;Discourses&quot;, a series of lectures delivered at the academy between 1769 and 1790, are remembered for their sensitivity and perception. In one lecture, he expressed the opinion that &quot;invention, strictly speaking, is little more than a new combination of those images which have been previously gathered and deposited in the memory.&quot; William Jackson in his contemporary essays said of Reynolds &#x27;there is much ingenuity and originality in all his academic discourses, replete with classical knowledge of his art, acute remarks on the works of others, and general taste and discernment&#x27;.

Reynolds and the Royal Academy received a mixed reception. Critics included William Blake who published the vitriolic &quot;Annotations to Sir Joshua Reynolds&#x27; Discourses&quot; in 1808. J. M. W. Turner and Northcote were fervent acolytes: Turner requested he be laid to rest at Reynolds&#x27; side, and Northcote, who spent four years as Reynolds&#x27; pupil, wrote to his family: &quot;I know him thoroughly, and all his faults, I am sure, and yet almost worship him.&quot;
In 2018, the Royal Academy of Arts celebrated its 250th anniversary from its opening in 1768. This became an impetus for galleries and museums across the UK to celebrate &quot;the making, debating and exhibiting art at the Royal Academy&quot;. Waddesdon manor was amongst the historic houses that supported Sir Joshua Reynolds&#x27;s influence at the academy, acknowledging how:

[He] transformed British painting with portraits and subject pictures that engaged their audience&#x27;s knowledge, imagination, memory and emotions... As an eloquent teacher and art theorist, he used his role at the head of the Royal Academy to raise the status of art and artists of Britain.

===&quot;Lord Keppel&quot;===

In the Battle of Ushant against the French in 1778, Lord Keppel commanded the Channel Fleet and the outcome resulted in no clear winner; Keppel ordered the attack be renewed and was obeyed except by Sir Hugh Palliser, who commanded the rear, and the French escaped bombardment. A dispute between Keppel and Palliser arose and Palliser brought charges of misconduct and neglect of duty against Keppel and the Admiralty decided to court-martial him. On 11 February 1779, Keppel was acquitted of all charges and became a national hero. One of Keppel&#x27;s lawyers commissioned Sir Nathaniel Dance-Holland to paint a portrait of Keppel, but Keppel redirected it to Reynolds. Reynolds alluded to Keppel&#x27;s trial in the portrait by painting his hand on his sword, reflecting the presiding officer&#x27;s words at the court-martial: &quot;In delivering to you your sword, I am to congratulate you on its being restored to you with so much honour&quot;.

===Principal Painter in Ordinary to the King===
On 10 August 1784, Allan Ramsay died and the office of Principal Painter in Ordinary to King George III became vacant. Thomas Gainsborough felt that he had a good chance of securing it, but Reynolds felt he deserved it and threatened to resign the presidency of the Royal Academy if he did not receive it. Reynolds noted in his pocket book: &quot;Sept. 1, 2½, to attend at the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Office to be sworn in painter to the King&quot;. It did not make Reynolds happy, however, as he wrote to Boswell: &quot;If I had known what a shabby miserable place it is, I would not have asked for it; besides as things have turned out I think a certain person is not worth speaking to, nor speaking of&quot;, presumably meaning the king. Reynolds wrote to Jonathan Shipley, Bishop of St Asaph, a few weeks later: &quot;Your Lordship congratulation on my succeeding Mr. Ramsay I take very kindly, but it is a most miserable office, it is reduced from two hundred to thirty-eight pounds per annum, the Kings Rat catcher I believe is a better place, and I am to be paid only a fourth part of what I have from other people, so that the Portraits of their Majesties are not likely to be better done now, than they used to be, I should be ruined if I was to paint them myself&quot;.

===&quot;Lord Heathfield&quot;===

In 1787, Reynolds painted the portrait of Lord Heathfield, who became a national hero for the successful defence of Gibraltar in the Great Siege from 1779 to 1783 against the combined forces of France and Spain. Heathfield is depicted against a background of clouds and cannon smoke, wearing the uniform of the 15th Light Dragoons and clasping the key of the Rock, its chain wrapped twice around his right hand. John Constable said in the 1830s that it was &quot;almost a history of the defence of Gibraltar&quot;. Desmond Shawe-Taylor has claimed that the portrait may have a religious meaning, Heathfield holding the key similar to St. Peter (Jesus&#x27; &quot;rock&quot;) possessing the keys to Heaven, Heathfield &quot;the rock upon which Britannia builds her military interests&quot;.

==Later life==
In 1789, Reynolds lost the sight of his left eye, which forced him into retirement. In 1791 James Boswell dedicated his &quot;Life of Samuel Johnson&quot; to Reynolds. Reynolds agreed with Burke&#x27;s &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; and, writing in early 1791, expressed his belief that the &quot;ancien régime&quot; of France had fallen due to spending too much time tending, as he puts it, to the splendor of the foliage, to the neglect of the stirring the earth about the roots. They cultivated only those arts which could add splendor to the nation, to the neglect of those which supported it – They neglected Trade &amp; substantial Manufacture ... but does it follow that a total revolution is necessary that because we have given ourselves up too much to the ornaments of life, we will now have none at all. When attending a dinner at Holland House, Fox&#x27;s niece Caroline was sat next to Reynolds and &quot;burst out into glorification of the Revolution – and was grievously chilled and checked by her neighbour&#x27;s cautious and unsympathetic tone&quot;.

On 4 June 1791, at a dinner at the Freemasons&#x27; Tavern to mark the king&#x27;s birthday, Reynolds drank to the toasts &quot;GOD &quot;save the&quot; KING!&quot; and &quot;May our glorious Constitution under which the arts flourish, be immortal!&quot;, in what was reported by the &quot;Public Advertiser&quot; as &quot;a fervour truly patriotick&quot;. Reynolds &quot;filled the chair with a most convivial glee&quot;. He returned to town from Burke&#x27;s house in Beaconsfield and Edmond Malone wrote that &quot;we left his carriage at the Inn at Hayes, and walked five miles on the road, in a warm day, without his complaining of any fatigue&quot;.

Later that month Reynolds suffered from a swelling over his left eye and had to be purged by a surgeon. In October he was too ill to take the president&#x27;s chair and in November, Frances Burney recorded that I had long languished to see that kindly zealous friend, but his ill health had intimidated me from making the attempt&quot;: &quot;He had a bandage over one eye, and the other shaded with a green half-bonnet. He seemed serious even to sadness, though extremely kind. &#x27;I am very glad,&#x27; he said, in a meek voice and dejected accent, &#x27;to see you again, and I wish I could see you better! but I have only one eye now, and hardly that.&#x27; I was really quite touched. On 5 November, Reynolds, fearing he might not have an opportunity to write a will, wrote a memorandum intended to be his last will and testament, with Edmund Burke, Edmond Malone, and Philip Metcalfe named as executors. On 10 November, Reynolds wrote to Benjamin West to resign the presidency, but the General Assembly agreed he should be re-elected, with Sir William Chambers and West to deputise for him.

Doctors Richard Warren and Sir George Baker believed Reynolds&#x27; illness to be psychological and they bled his neck &quot;with a view of drawing the humour from his eyes&quot; but the effect, in the view of his niece, was that it seemed &quot;as if the &#x27;principle of life&#x27; were gone&quot; from Reynolds. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1792 Reynolds became &quot;seized with sickness&quot;, and from that time onwards could not keep food down.
Reynolds died on 23 February 1792 at his house at 47 Leicester Fields in London between eight and nine in the evening.

Burke was present on the night Reynolds died, and was moved within hours to write a eulogy of Reynolds, starting with the following sentiments: &quot;Sir Joshua Reynolds was on very many accounts one of the most memorable men of his Time. He was the first Englishman who added the praise of the elegant Arts to the other Glories of his Country. In Taste, in grace, in facility, in happy invention, and in the richness and Harmony of colouring, he was equal to the great masters of the renowned Ages.&quot; Burke&#x27;s tribute was well received and one journalist called it &quot;the eulogium of Apelles pronounced by Pericles&quot;.

Reynolds was buried at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. In 1903, a statue, by Alfred Drury, was erected in his honour in the Annenberg Courtyard of Burlington House, home of the Royal Academy. Around the statue are fountains and lights, installed in 2000, arranged in the pattern of a star chart at midnight on the night of Reynolds&#x27; birth. The planets are marked by granite discs, and the Moon by a water recess.
==Personal characteristics==

In appearance Reynolds was not striking. Slightly built, he was about 5&#x27;6&quot; tall with dark brown curls, a florid complexion and features that James Boswell thought were &quot;rather too largely and strongly limned.&quot; He had a broad face and a cleft chin, and the bridge of his nose was slightly dented; his skin was scarred by smallpox and his upper lip disfigured as a result of falling from a horse as a young man. Edmond Malone asserted however that &quot;his appearance at first sight impressed the spectator with the idea of a well-born and well-bred English gentleman.&quot;

In his mature years he suffered from deafness, as recorded by Frances Burney, although this did not impede his lively social life. Renowned for his placidity, Reynolds often claimed that he &quot;hated nobody&quot;. This may be self-idealisation. It is well known that he disliked George Romney, whom he referred to only as &quot;the man in Cavendish Square&quot; and whom he successfully prevented from becoming a member of the Royal Academy. He did not like Gainsborough, yet appreciated his achievements in the obituary he wrote of his rival. (Rump; Kidson). It is said that when he taught in one of his &quot;discourses&quot; that a painter should not amass too much of the colour blue in the foreground of an image, Gainsborough was prompted to paint his famous &quot;Blue Boy&quot;.

Never quite losing his Devonshire accent, Reynolds was not only an amiable and original conversationalist, but a friendly and generous host, so that Frances Burney recorded in her diary that he had &quot;a suavity of disposition that set everybody at their ease in his society&quot;, and William Makepeace Thackeray believed &quot;of all the polite men of that age, Joshua Reynolds was the finest gentleman&quot;. Dr Johnson commented on the &quot;inoffensiveness&quot; of his nature; Edmund Burke noted his &quot;strong turn for humor&quot;. Thomas Bernard, who later became Bishop of Killaloe, wrote in his closing verses on Reynolds stating:

&lt;poem&gt;Thou say&#x27;st not only skill is gained
But genius too may be attained
By studious imitation;
Thy temper mild, thy genius fine
I&#x27;ll copy till I make them mine
By constant application.&lt;/poem&gt;

Some people, such as Hester Lynch Piozzi, construed Reynolds&#x27; equable calm as cool and unfeeling. It is to this lukewarm temperament that Frederick W. Hilles, Bodman Professor of English Literature at Yale attributes Reynolds&#x27; never having married. In the editorial notes of his compendium &quot;Portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds&quot;, Hilles theorises that &quot;as a corollary one might say that he [Reynolds] was somewhat lacking in a capacity for love&quot;, and cites Boswell&#x27;s notary papers: &quot;He said the reason he would never marry was that every woman whom he liked had grown indifferent to him, and he had been glad he did not marry her.&quot; Reynolds&#x27; own sister, Frances, who lived with him as housekeeper, took her own negative opinion further still, thinking him &quot;a gloomy tyrant&quot;. The presence of family compensated Reynolds for the absence of a wife; he wrote on one occasion to his friend Bennet Langton, that both his sister and niece were away from home &quot;so that I am quite a bachelor&quot;. Reynolds did not marry, and had no known children.

Biographer Ian McIntyre discusses the possibility of Reynolds having enjoyed sexual relations with certain clients, such as Nelly O&#x27;Brien (or &quot;My Lady O&#x27;Brien&quot;, as he playfully dubbed her) and Kitty Fisher, who visited his house for more sittings than were strictly necessary. Dan Cruickshank in his book &quot;London&#x27;s Sinful Secret&quot; summarised Reynolds as having visited and re-visited various reputed red light districts in London after his return from Italy as a possible contributor to his medical condition and appearance due to commonly contracted disease in those areas of London.

Regarding the British debate over the abolition of slavery, abolitionist Thomas Clarkson claimed that Reynolds stated his opposition to the Atlantic slave trade at a dinner with a group of friends with Clarkson present. Clarkson had shown the group samples of cloth produced in Africa, and Reynolds &quot;gave his unqualified approbation of the abolition of this cruel traffic&quot;. Reynolds also subscribed to the second edition of Ottobah Cugoano&#x27;s abolitionist work &quot;Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil and Wicked Traffic of the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species&quot;. Reynolds also had a Black servant who appears to have joined his household around the mid-1760s. Unlike Cugoano, however, his name is not recorded despite Northcote suggesting that the servant modelled for several of Reynolds’ paintings. Northcote stated that the man had been brought to Britain by Mary Mordaunt, the wife of landowner Valentine Morris, though this account contained &quot;inconsistencies and conflicting chronologies&quot;.

== The Reynolds Research Project ==
In 2010, the Wallace Collection launched the Reynolds Research Project. With the support of the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, and in partnership with the National Gallery and in collaboration with the Yale Center for British Art, work was undertaken to conserve the museum&#x27;s portraits to improve their visual appreciation for future generations and to investigate the ways in which they were painted.

The purpose of an exhibition and accompanying catalogue, &quot;Joshua Reynolds: Experiments in Paint&quot;, 2015, was to share the discoveries of the project and to reveal Reynolds&#x27;s complex and experimental engagement with painterly materials over the course of his long career. A series of thematic groupings of works from the collection with temporary loans allowed the curators to explore the development of Reynolds&#x27;s images from both a technical and art historical viewpoint.

As well as exploring his experimentation with materials, the project also revealed the innovative ways in which Reynolds collaborated with his patrons; played with the conventions of genre, composition and pose; engaged with the work of other artists; and organised the submission and display of his work at exhibitions. The commissioning and collecting of Reynolds&#x27;s work, specifically in the context of the founders of the Wallace Collection (the Seymour-Conway family), was also examined.

<text>Joseph Alois Schumpeter (; February 8, 1883 – January 8, 1950) was an Austrian political economist. He served briefly as Finance Minister of Austria in 1919. In 1932, he emigrated to the United States to become a professor at Harvard University, where he remained until the end of his career, and in 1939 obtained American citizenship.

Schumpeter was one of the most influential economists of the early 20th century, and popularized the term &quot;creative destruction&quot;, coined by Werner Sombart. His magnum opus is considered &quot;Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Schumpeter was born in 1883 in Triesch, Habsburg Moravia (now Třešť in the Czech Republic, then part of Austria-Hungary), to German-speaking Catholic parents. Though both of his grandmothers were Czech, Schumpeter did not acknowledge his Czech ancestry. His father, who owned a factory, died when Joseph was only four years old. In 1893, Joseph and his mother moved to Vienna. Schumpeter was a loyal supporter of Franz Joseph I of Austria.

Schumpeter was educated at the Theresianum and began his career studying law at the University of Vienna under Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, an economic theorist of the Austrian School. In 1906, he received his doctoral degree from the University of Vienna&#x27;s faculty of law, with a specialisation in economics. In 1909, after some study trips, he became a professor of economics and government at the University of Czernowitz in modern-day Ukraine. In 1911, he joined the University of Graz, where he remained until World War I.

In 1913–1914, Schumpeter taught at Columbia University as an invited professor. This invitation marked, according to Wolfgang Stolper, the &quot;high point of his worldly success&quot;. He taught economic theory and met Irving Fisher and Wesley Clair Mitchell. Columbia awarded him an honorary doctorate.

In 1918, Schumpeter was a member of the Socialisation Commission established by the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies in Germany. In March 1919, he was invited to take office as Minister of Finance in the Republic of German-Austria. He proposed a capital levy as a way to tackle the war debt and opposed the socialization of the Alpine Mountain plant. In 1921, he became president of the private Biedermann Bank. He was also a board member at the Kaufmann Bank. Problems at those banks left Schumpeter in debt. His resignation was a condition of the takeover of the Biedermann Bank in September 1924.

From 1925 until 1932, Schumpeter held a chair at the University of Bonn, Germany. He lectured at Harvard in 1927–1928 and 1930. In 1931, he was a visiting professor at the Tokyo College of Commerce. In 1932, Schumpeter moved to the United States, and soon began what would become extensive efforts to help fellow central European economists displaced by Nazism. Schumpeter&#x27;s last visit to Europe was in 1937. Schumpeter also became known for his opposition to Marxism and socialism, which he thought would lead to dictatorship, and even criticized Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. In 1939, Schumpeter became a US citizen. At the beginning of World War II, the FBI investigated him and his wife, Elizabeth Boody (a prominent scholar of Japanese economics) for Nazi sympathies, but found no evidence of such leanings.

At Harvard, Schumpeter was considered a memorable character, erudite, and even showy in the classroom. He became known for his heavy teaching load and his personal and painstaking interest in his students. He served as the faculty advisor of the Graduate Economics Club and organized private seminars and discussion groups. Some colleagues thought his views were outdated by Keynesianism, which was fashionable; others resented his criticisms, particularly of their failure to offer an assistant professorship to Paul Samuelson, but recanted when they thought him likely to accept a position at Yale University. This period of his life was characterized by hard work and comparatively little recognition of his massive two-volume book &quot;Business Cycles.&quot; However, Schumpeter persevered, and in 1942 published what became the most popular of all his works, &quot;Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy&quot;, reprinted many times and in many languages in the following decades, as well as cited thousands of times.

==Career==
===Influences===
The source of Schumpeter&#x27;s dynamic, change-oriented, and innovation-based economics was the historical school of economics. Although his writings could be critical of that perspective, Schumpeter&#x27;s work on the role of innovation and entrepreneurship can be seen as a continuation of ideas originated by the historical school, especially the work of Gustav von Schmoller and Werner Sombart. Despite being born in Austria and having trained with many of the same economists, some argue he cannot be categorized with the Austrian School of economics without major qualifications while others maintain the opposite. Schumpeter was also influenced by Léon Walras and the Lausanne School, calling Walras the &quot;greatest of all economists&quot;.

The Austrian sociologist Rudolf Goldscheid&#x27;s concept of fiscal sociology influenced Schumpeter&#x27;s analysis of the tax state. A 2012 paper showed that Schumpeter&#x27;s writings displayed the influence of Francis Galton&#x27;s work.

===Evolutionary economics===

According to Christopher Freeman (2009), &quot;the central point of his whole life work [is]: that capitalism can only be understood as an evolutionary process of continuous innovation and &#x27;creative destruction&#x27;&quot;.

===&quot;History of Economic Analysis&quot;===
Schumpeter&#x27;s scholarship is apparent in his posthumous &quot;History of Economic Analysis&quot;, Schumpeter thought that the greatest 18th-century economist was Turgot rather than Adam Smith, and he considered Léon Walras to be the &quot;greatest of all economists&quot;, beside whom other economists&#x27; theories were &quot;like inadequate attempts to catch some particular aspects of Walrasian truth&quot;. Schumpeter criticized John Maynard Keynes and David Ricardo for the &quot;Ricardian vice&quot;. According to Schumpeter, both Ricardo and Keynes reasoned in terms of abstract models, where they would freeze all but a few variables. Then they could argue that one caused the other in a simple monotonic fashion. This led to the belief that one could easily deduce policy conclusions directly from a highly abstract theoretical model.

In this book, Joseph Schumpeter recognized the implication of a gold monetary standard compared to a fiat monetary standard. In &quot;History of Economic Analysis&quot;, Schumpeter stated the following: &quot;An &#x27;automatic&#x27; gold currency is part and parcel of a laissez-faire and free-trade economy. It links every nation&#x27;s money rates and price levels with the money rates and price levels of all the other nations that are &#x27;on gold.&#x27; However, gold is extremely sensitive to government expenditure and even to attitudes or policies that do not involve expenditure directly, for example, in foreign policy, certain policies of taxation, and, in general, precisely all those policies that violate the principles of [classical] liberalism. &quot;This&quot; is the reason why gold is so unpopular now and also why it was so popular in a bourgeois era.&quot;

===Business cycles===
Schumpeter&#x27;s relationships with the ideas of other economists were quite complex in his most important contributions to economic analysis – the theory of business cycles and development. Following neither Walras nor Keynes, Schumpeter starts in &quot;The Theory of Economic Development&quot; with a treatise of circular flow which, excluding any innovations and innovative activities, leads to a stationary state. The stationary state is, according to Schumpeter, described by Walrasian equilibrium. The hero of his story is the entrepreneur.

The entrepreneur disturbs this equilibrium and is the prime cause of economic development, which proceeds cyclically along with several time scales. In fashioning this theory connecting innovations, cycles, and development, Schumpeter kept alive the Russian Nikolai Kondratiev&#x27;s ideas on 50-year cycles, Kondratiev waves.

Schumpeter suggested a model in which the four main cycles, Kondratiev (54 years), Kuznets (18 years), Juglar (9 years), and Kitchin (about 4 years) can be added together to form a composite waveform. A Kondratiev wave could consist of three lower-degree Kuznets waves. Each Kuznets wave could, itself, be made up of two Juglar waves. Similarly two (or three) Kitchin waves could form a higher degree Juglar wave. If each of these were in phase; more importantly, if the downward arc of each was simultaneous so that the nadir of each was coincident, it would explain disastrous slumps and consequent depressions. As far as the segmentation of the Kondratiev Wave, Schumpeter never proposed such a fixed model. He saw these cycles varying in time – although in a tight time frame by coincidence – and for each to serve a specific purpose.

===Keynesianism===
In Schumpeter&#x27;s theory, Walrasian equilibrium is not adequate to capture the key mechanisms of economic development. Schumpeter also thought that the institution enabling the entrepreneur to buy the resources needed to realize his vision was a well-developed capitalist financial system, including a whole range of institutions for granting credit. One could divide economists among (1) those who emphasized &quot;real&quot; analysis and regarded money as merely a &quot;veil&quot; and (2) those who thought monetary institutions were important and money could be a separate driving force. Both Schumpeter and Keynes were among the latter.

===Demise of capitalism===

Schumpeter&#x27;s most popular book in English is probably &quot;Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy&quot;. While he agrees with Karl Marx that capitalism will collapse and be replaced by socialism, Schumpeter predicts a different way this will come about. While Marx predicted that capitalism would be overthrown by a violent proletarian revolution, which occurred in the least capitalist countries, Schumpeter believed that capitalism would gradually weaken itself and eventually collapse. Specifically, the success of capitalism would lead to corporatism and to values hostile to capitalism, especially among intellectuals.

&quot;Intellectuals&quot; are a social class in a position to critique societal matters for which they are not directly responsible and to stand up for the interests of other classes. Intellectuals tend to have a negative outlook on capitalism, even while relying on it for prestige because their professions rely on antagonism toward it. The growing number of people with higher education is a great advantage of capitalism, according to Schumpeter. Yet, unemployment and a lack of fulfilling work will lead to intellectual critique, discontent, and protests.

Parliaments will increasingly elect social democratic parties, and democratic majorities will vote for restrictions on entrepreneurship. Increasing workers&#x27; self-management, industrial democracy and regulatory institutions would evolve non-politically into &quot;liberal capitalism&quot;. Thus, the intellectual and social climate needed for thriving entrepreneurship will be replaced by some form of &quot;laborism&quot;. This will exacerbate &quot;creative destruction&quot; (a borrowed phrase to denote an endogenous replacement of old ways of doing things by new ways), which will ultimately undermine and destroy the capitalist structure.

Schumpeter emphasizes throughout this book that he is analyzing trends, not engaging in political advocacy.

William Fellner, in the book &quot;Schumpeter&#x27;s Vision: Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy After 40 Years&quot;, noted that Schumpeter saw any political system in which the power was fully monopolized as fascist.

===Democratic theory===
In the same book, Schumpeter expounded on a theory of democracy that sought to challenge what he called the &quot;classical doctrine&quot;. He disputed the idea that democracy was a process by which the electorate identified the common good, and politicians carried this out for them. He argued this was unrealistic, and that people&#x27;s ignorance and superficiality meant that they were largely manipulated by politicians, who set the agenda. Furthermore, he claimed that even if the common good was possible to find, it would still not make clear the means needed to reach its end, since citizens do not have the requisite knowledge to design government policy. This made a &#x27;rule by the people&#x27; concept both unlikely and undesirable. Instead, he advocated a minimalist model, much influenced by Max Weber, whereby democracy is the mechanism for competition between leaders, much like a market structure. Although periodic votes by the general public legitimize governments and keep them accountable, the policy program is very much seen as their own and not that of the people, and the participatory role of individuals is usually severely limited.

Schumpeter defined democracy as the method by which people elect representatives in competitive elections to carry out their will. This definition has been described as simple, elegant and parsimonious, making it clearer to distinguish political systems that either fulfill or fail these characteristics. This minimalist definition stands in contrast to broader definitions of democracy, which may emphasize aspects such as &quot;representation, accountability, equality, participation, justice, dignity, rationality, security, freedom&quot;. Within such a minimalist definition, states which other scholars say have experienced democratic backsliding and which lack civil liberties, a free press, the rule of law and a constrained executive, would still be considered democracies. For Schumpeter, the formation of a government is the endpoint of the democratic process, which means that for the purposes of his democratic theory, he has no comment on what kinds of decisions that the government can take to be a democracy. Schumpeter faced pushback on his theory from other democratic theorists, such as Robert Dahl, who argued that there is more to democracy than simply the formation of government through competitive elections.

Schumpeter&#x27;s view of democracy has been described as &quot;elitist&quot;, as he criticizes the rationality and knowledge of voters, and expresses a preference for politicians making decisions. Democracy is therefore in a sense a means to ensure circulation among elites. However, studies by Natasha Piano of the University of Chicago emphasize that Schumpeter had substantial disdain for elites as well.

===Entrepreneurship===
The field of entrepreneurship theory owed much to Schumpeter&#x27;s contributions. His fundamental theories are often referred to as Mark I and Mark II. In Mark I, Schumpeter argued that the innovation and technological change of a nation come from entrepreneurs or wild spirits. He coined the word &quot;Unternehmergeist&quot;, German for &quot;entrepreneur-spirit&quot;, and asserted that &quot;... the doing of new things or the doing of things that are already being done in a new way&quot; stemmed directly from the efforts of entrepreneurs.

Schumpeter developed Mark II while a professor at Harvard. Many social economists and popular authors of the day argued that large businesses had a negative effect on the standard of living of ordinary people. Contrary to this prevailing opinion, Schumpeter argued that the agents that drive innovation and the economy are large companies that have the capital to invest in research and development of new products and services and to deliver them to customers more cheaply, thus raising their standard of living. In one of his seminal works, &quot;Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy&quot;, Schumpeter wrote:

 Mark I and Mark II arguments are considered complementary.

===Cycles and long wave theory===
Schumpeter was the most influential thinker to argue that long cycles are caused by innovation and are an incident of it. His treatise on how business cycles developed was based on Kondratiev&#x27;s ideas which attributed the causes very differently. Schumpeter&#x27;s treatise brought Kondratiev&#x27;s ideas to the attention of English-speaking economists. Kondratiev fused important elements that Schumpeter missed. Yet, the Schumpeterian variant of the long-cycles hypothesis, stressing the initiating role of innovations, commands the widest attention today.
In Schumpeter&#x27;s view, technological innovation is the cause of both cyclical instability and economic growth. Fluctuations in innovation cause fluctuations in investment and those cause cycles in economic growth. Schumpeter sees innovations as clustering around certain points in time that he refers to as &quot;neighborhoods of equilibrium&quot; when entrepreneurs perceive that risk and returns warrant innovative commitments. These clusters lead to long cycles by generating periods of acceleration in aggregate growth.

The technological view of change needs to demonstrate that changes in the rate of innovation govern changes in the rate of new investments and that the combined impact of innovation clusters takes the form of fluctuation in aggregate output or employment. The process of technological innovation involves extremely complex relations among a set of key variables: inventions, innovations, diffusion paths, and investment activities. The impact of technological innovation on aggregate output is mediated through a succession of relationships that have yet to be explored systematically in the context of the long wave. New inventions are typically primitive, their performance is usually poorer than existing technologies and the cost of their production is high. A production technology may not yet exist, as is often the case in major chemical and pharmaceutical inventions. The speed with which inventions are transformed into innovations and diffused depends on the actual and expected trajectory of performance improvement and cost reduction.

===Innovation===
Schumpeter identified innovation as the critical dimension of economic change. He argued that economic change revolves around innovation, entrepreneurial activities, and market power. He sought to prove that innovation-originated market power can provide better results than the invisible hand and price competition. He argued that technological innovation often creates temporary monopolies, allowing abnormal profits that would soon be competed away by rivals and imitators. These temporary monopolies were necessary to provide the incentive for firms to develop new products and processes.

===Doing Business===
The World Bank&#x27;s &quot;Doing Business&quot; report was influenced by Schumpeter&#x27;s focus on removing impediments to creative destruction. The creation of the report is credited in part to his work.

==Personal life==
Schumpeter was married three times. His first wife was Gladys Ricarde Seaver, an Englishwoman nearly 12 years his senior (married 1907, separated 1913, divorced 1925). His best man at his wedding was his friend and Austrian jurist Hans Kelsen. His second was Anna Reisinger, 20 years his junior and daughter of the concierge of the apartment where he grew up. As a divorced man, he and his bride converted to Lutheranism to marry. They married in 1925, but within a year, she died in childbirth. The loss of his wife and newborn son came only weeks after Schumpeter&#x27;s mother had died. Five years after arriving in the US, in 1937, at the age of 54, Schumpeter married the American economic historian Dr. Elizabeth Boody (1898–1953), who helped him popularize his work and edited what became their magnum opus, the posthumously published &quot;History of Economic Analysis&quot;. Elizabeth assisted him with his research and English writing until his death.

Schumpeter claimed that he had set himself three goals in life: to be the greatest economist in the world, to be the best horseman in all of Austria, and the greatest lover in all of Vienna. He said he had reached two of his goals, but he never said which two, although he is reported to have said that there were too many fine horsemen in Austria for him to succeed in all his aspirations.

==Later life and death==
Schumpeter died in his home in Taconic, Connecticut, at the age of 66, on the night of January 8, 1950.

==Legacy==
For some time after his death, Schumpeter&#x27;s views were most influential among various heterodox economists, especially Europeans, who were interested in industrial organization, evolutionary theory, and economic development, and who tended to be on the other end of the political spectrum from Schumpeter and were also often influenced by Keynes, Karl Marx, and Thorstein Veblen. Robert Heilbroner was one of Schumpeter&#x27;s most renowned pupils, who wrote extensively about him in &quot;The Worldly Philosophers&quot;. In the journal &quot;Monthly Review&quot;, John Bellamy Foster wrote of that journal&#x27;s founder Paul Sweezy, one of the leading Marxist economists in the United States and a graduate assistant of Schumpeter&#x27;s at Harvard, that Schumpeter &quot;played a formative role in his development as a thinker&quot;. Other outstanding students of Schumpeter&#x27;s include the economists Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and Hyman Minsky and John Kenneth Galbraith and former chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan. Future Nobel Laureate Robert Solow was his student at Harvard, and he expanded on Schumpeter&#x27;s theory.

Today, Schumpeter has a following outside standard textbook economics, in areas such as economic policy, management studies, industrial policy, and the study of innovation. Schumpeter was probably the first scholar to develop theories about entrepreneurship. For instance, the European Union&#x27;s innovation program, and its main development plan, the Lisbon Strategy, are influenced by Schumpeter. The International Joseph A. Schumpeter Society awards the Schumpeter Prize.

The Schumpeter School of Business and Economics opened in October 2008 at the University of Wuppertal, Germany. According to University President Professor Lambert T. Koch, &quot;Schumpeter will not only be the name of the Faculty of Management and Economics, but this is also a research and teaching programme related to Joseph A. Schumpeter.&quot;

On September 17, 2009, &quot;The Economist&quot; inaugurated a column on business and management named &quot;Schumpeter&quot;. The publication has a history of naming columns after significant figures or symbols in the covered field, including naming its British affairs column after former editor Walter Bagehot and its European affairs column after Charlemagne. The initial Schumpeter column praised him as a &quot;champion of innovation and entrepreneurship&quot; whose writing showed an understanding of the benefits and dangers of business that proved to be far ahead of its time.

Schumpeter&#x27;s thoughts inspired the economic theory of Adam Przeworski.

<text>John Lee Hooker (August 22, 1912 or 1917 – June 21, 2001) was an American blues singer, songwriter, and guitarist. The son of a sharecropper, he rose to prominence performing an electric guitar-style adaptation of Delta blues that he developed in Detroit. Hooker often incorporated other elements, including talking blues and early North Mississippi hill country blues. He developed his own driving-rhythm boogie style, distinct from the 1930s–1940s piano-derived boogie-woogie. Hooker was ranked 35 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2015 list of 100 greatest guitarists, and has been cited as one of the greatest male blues vocalists of all time.

Some of his best known songs include &quot;Boogie Chillen&#x27;&quot; (1948), &quot;Crawling King Snake&quot; (1949), &quot;Dimples&quot; (1956), &quot;Boom Boom&quot; (1962), and &quot;One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer&quot; (1966). Several of his later albums, including &quot;The Healer&quot; (1989), &quot;Mr. Lucky&quot; (1991), &quot;Chill Out&quot; (1995), and &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; (1997), were album chart successes in the U.S. and UK. &quot;The Healer&quot; (for the song &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood&quot;) and &quot;Chill Out&quot; (for the album) both earned him Grammy wins, as well as &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;, which went on to earn him a double-Grammy win for Best Traditional Blues Recording and Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals (with Van Morrison).

==Early life==
Hooker&#x27;s date of birth is a subject of debate; the years 1912, 1915, 1917, 1920, and 1923 have all been suggested. Most official sources list 1917, though at times Hooker stated he was born in 1920. Information found in the 1920 and 1930 censuses indicates that he was actually born in 1912. In 2017, a series of events were held to celebrate the supposed centenary of his birth. In the 1920 federal census, John Hooker is seven years old and one of nine children living with William and Minnie Hooker in Tutwiler, Mississippi.

It is believed that he was born in Tutwiler, in Tallahatchie County, although some sources say his birthplace was near Clarksdale, in Coahoma County. He was the youngest of the 11 children of William Hooker (born 1871, died after 1923), a sharecropper and Baptist preacher, and Minnie Ramsey (born c. 1880, date of death unknown). In the 1920 federal census, William and Minnie were recorded as being 48 and 39 years old, respectively, which implies that Minnie was born about 1880, not 1875. She was said to have been a &quot;decade or so younger&quot; than her husband, which gives additional credibility to this census record as evidence of Hooker&#x27;s origins.

The Hooker children were homeschooled. They were permitted to listen only to religious songs; the spirituals sung in church were their earliest exposure to music. In 1921, their parents separated. The next year, their mother married William Moore, a blues singer, who provided John Lee with an introduction to the guitar (and whom he would later credit for his distinctive playing style).

Moore was his first significant blues influence. He was a local blues guitarist who, in Shreveport, Louisiana, learned to play a droning, one-chord blues that was strikingly different from the Delta blues of the time.

Another influence was Tony Hollins, who dated Hooker&#x27;s sister Alice, helped teach Hooker to play, and gave him his first guitar. For the rest of his life, Hooker regarded Hollins as a formative influence on his style of playing and his career as a musician. Among the songs that Hollins reputedly taught Hooker were versions of &quot;Crawlin&#x27; King Snake&quot; and &quot;Catfish Blues&quot;.

At the age of 14, Hooker ran away from home, reportedly never seeing his mother or stepfather again. In the mid-1930s, he lived in Memphis, Tennessee, where he performed on Beale Street, at the New Daisy Theatre and occasionally at house parties.

He worked in factories in various cities during World War II, eventually getting a job with the Ford Motor Company in Detroit in 1943. He frequented the blues clubs and bars on Hastings Street, the heart of the black entertainment district, on Detroit&#x27;s east side. In a city noted for its pianists, guitar players were scarce. Hooker&#x27;s popularity grew quickly as he performed in Detroit clubs, and, seeking an instrument louder than his acoustic guitar, he bought his first electric guitar.

==Earlier career==
Hooker was working as a janitor in a Detroit steel mill when his recording career began in 1948, when Modern Records, based in Los Angeles, released a demo he had recorded for Bernie Besman in Detroit. The single, &quot;Boogie Chillen&#x27;, became a hit and the best-selling race record of 1949. Though illiterate, Hooker was a prolific lyricist. In addition to adapting traditional blues lyrics, he composed original songs. In the 1950s, like many black musicians, Hooker earned little from record sales, and so he often recorded variations of his songs for different studios for an up-front fee. To evade his recording contract, he used various pseudonyms, including John Lee Booker (for Chess Records and Chance Records in 1951–1952), Johnny Lee (for De Luxe Records in 1953–1954), John Lee, John Lee Cooker, Texas Slim, Delta John, Birmingham Sam and his Magic Guitar, Johnny Williams, and the Boogie Man.

His early solo songs were recorded by Bernie Besman. Hooker rarely played with a standard beat, opting instead to adjust the tempo to fit the needs of the song. This often made it difficult to use backing musicians, who were not accustomed to Hooker&#x27;s musical vagaries. As a result, Besman recorded Hooker playing guitar, singing, and stomping on a wooden pallet in time with the music.

For much of this period, he recorded and toured with Eddie Kirkland. In Hooker&#x27;s later sessions for Vee-Jay Records in Chicago, studio musicians accompanied him on most of his recordings, including Eddie Taylor, who could handle his musical idiosyncrasies. &quot;Boom Boom&quot; (1962) and &quot;Dimples,&quot; two popular songs by Hooker, were originally released by Vee-Jay.

==Later career==
Beginning in 1962, Hooker gained greater exposure when he toured Europe in the annual American Folk Blues Festival. His &quot;Dimples&quot; became a successful single on the UK Singles Charts in 1964, eight years after its first US release. Hooker began to perform and record with rock musicians. One of his earliest collaborations was with British blues rock band the Groundhogs. In 1970, he recorded the joint album &quot;Hooker &#x27;n Heat&quot;, with the American blues and boogie rock group Canned Heat, whose repertoire included adaptations of Hooker songs. It became the first of Hooker&#x27;s albums to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, peaking at number 78 on the Billboard 200. Other collaboration albums soon followed, including &quot;Endless Boogie&quot; (1971) and &quot;Never Get Out of These Blues Alive&quot; (1972), which included Steve Miller, Elvin Bishop, Van Morrison, and others.

Hooker appeared in the 1980 film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; as a street musician playing &quot;Boom Boom.&quot; In 1989, he recorded the album &quot;The Healer&quot; with Carlos Santana, Bonnie Raitt, and others. The 1990s saw additional collaboration albums: &quot;Mr. Lucky&quot; (1991), &quot;Chill Out&quot; (1995), and &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; (1997) with Morrison, Santana, Los Lobos, and additional guest musicians. His re-recording of &quot;Boom Boom&quot; (the title track for his 1992 album) with guitarist Jimmie Vaughan became Hooker&#x27;s highest charting single (number 16) in the UK. &quot;Come See About Me&quot;, a 2004 DVD, includes performances filmed between 1960 and 1994 and interviews with several of the musicians.

Hooker owned five houses in his later life, including ones in the California cities of Los Altos, Redwood City, and Long Beach. On June 21, 2001, Hooker died in his sleep at home in Los Altos.

==Awards and recognition==
Among his many awards, Hooker was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. He was a recipient of a 1983 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government&#x27;s highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. He was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000 and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He is also inducted into the Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame.

Two of his songs, &quot;Boogie Chillen&quot; and &quot;Boom Boom,&quot; are included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s list of the 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. &quot;Boogie Chillen&quot; is also included in the Recording Industry Association of America&#x27;s list of the &quot;Songs of the Century&quot;.

<text>The Satires () are a collection of satirical poems by the Latin author Juvenal written between the end of the first and the early second centuries A.D.
Juvenal is credited with sixteen poems divided among five books; all are in the Roman genre of satire. The genre is defined by a wide-ranging discussion of society and social in dactylic hexameter. The sixth and tenth satires are some of the most renowned works in the collection.

*Book I: Satires 1–5
*Book II: Satire 6
*Book III: Satires 7–9
*Book IV: Satires 10–12
*Book V: Satires 13–16 (Satire 16 is incompletely preserved)

In a tone and manner ranging from irony to rage, Juvenal criticizes the actions and beliefs of many of his contemporaries, providing insight into value systems and questions of morality as opposed to the realities of Roman life. The author makes constant allusion to history and myth as a source of object lessons or exemplars of particular vices and virtues. Coupled with his dense and elliptical Latin, these references indicate that the intended reader of the &quot;Satires&quot; was highly educated. The &quot;Satires&quot; are concerned with perceived threats to the social continuity of the Roman citizens: socially ascendant foreigners, unfaithfulness, and other more extreme excesses of the Roman aristocracy.

Scholarly estimates for the dating of the individual books have varied. It is generally accepted that the fifth book must date to a point after 127, because of a reference to the Roman consul Lucius Aemilius Juncus in Satire 15. A recent scholar has argued that the first book should be dated to 100 or 101. Juvenal&#x27;s works are contemporary with those of Martial, Tacitus and Pliny the Younger.

==Manuscript tradition==
The controversies concerning the surviving texts of the Satires have been extensive and heated. Many manuscripts survive, but only P (the Codex Pithoeanus Montepessulanus), a 9th-century manuscript based on an edition prepared in the 4th century by a pupil of Servius Honoratus, the grammarian, is reasonably reliable. At the same time as the Servian text was produced, however, other and lesser scholars also created their editions of Juvenal: it is these on which most medieval manuscripts of Juvenal are based. It did not help matters that P disappeared sometime during the Renaissance and was only rediscovered around 1840. It is not, however, uncommon for the generally inferior manuscripts to supply a better reading in cases when P is imperfect. In addition, modern scholarly debate has also raged around the authenticity of the text which has survived, as various editors have argued that considerable portions are not, in fact, authentically Juvenalian and represent interpolations from early editors of the text. Jachmann (1943) argued that up to one-third of what survives is non-authentic: Ulrick Knoche (1950) deleted about hundred lines, Clausen about forty, Courtney (1975) a similar number. Willis (1997) italicizes 297 lines as being potentially suspect. On the other hand, Vahlen, Housman, Duff, Griffith, Ferguson and Green believe the surviving text to be largely authentic: indeed Green regards the main problem as being not interpolations but lacunae.

In recent times debate has focused on the authenticity of the &quot;O Passage&quot; of Satire VI, 36 lines (34 of which are continuous) discovered by E. O. Winstedt in an 11th-century manuscript in Oxford&#x27;s Bodleian Library. These lines occur in no other manuscript of Juvenal, and when discovered were considerably corrupted. Ever since Housman translated and emended the &quot;O Passage&quot; there has been considerable controversy over whether the fragment is in fact a forgery: the field is currently split between those (Green, Ferguson, Courtney) who believe it is not, and those (Willis, Anderson), who believe it is.

== Genre ==
Juvenal is credited with sixteen known poems divided among five books; all are in the Roman genre of satire, which, at its most basic in the time of the author, comprised a wide-ranging discussion of society and social mores in dactylic hexameter. In &quot;Satire I&quot;, concerning the scope and content of his work, Juvenal says:

Juvenal claims as his purview, the entire gamut of human experience since the dawn of history. Quintilian—in the context of a discussion of literary genres appropriate for an oratorical education—claimed that, unlike so many literary and artistic forms adopted from Greek models, &quot;satire at least is all ours&quot; (&quot;satura quidem tota nostra est&quot;). At least in the view of Quintillian, earlier Greek satiric verse (e.g. that of Hipponax) or even Latin satiric prose (e.g. that of Petronius) did not constitute &quot;satura&quot;, per se. Roman &quot;Satura&quot; was a formal literary genre rather than being simply clever, humorous critique in no particular format.

*Book I: Satires 1–5
*Book II: Satire 6
*Book III: Satires 7–9
*Book IV: Satires 10–12
*Book V: Satires 13–16 (although Satire 16 is incomplete)

The individual &quot;Satires&quot; (excluding Satire 16) range in length from approximately 130 (Satire 12) to 695 (Satire 6) lines. The poems are not entitled individually, but translators often have added titles for the convenience of readers.

==Synopsis==

===Book I===

&quot;Satire 1&quot; -- The first satire begins with the words, &quot;semper ego auditor tantum...&quot; (lit. &#x27;always, I am only heard&#x27;). Within this satire, Juvenal says his disgust in the spread of moral corruption has driven him to write satire. He says, &quot;difficile est saturam non scribere&quot; (lit. &#x27;it is difficult to not write satire&#x27;), since there is so much to criticize in Rome. He lists eunuchs getting married, elite women performing in a beast hunt, and the dregs of society suddenly becoming wealthy by gross acts of sycophancy, all as examples of widespread degeneracy. Overall, he sets the theme for his satires and emphasizes the power of it to expose wrongdoing-- crediting Lucilius in doing so. 

&quot;Satire 2&quot; -- The second satire opens, stating, &quot;I would fain flee to Sarmatia and the frozen sea when people who ape the Curii and live like Bacchanals dare talk about morals&quot;. This satire largely attacks those who hide their vice beneath fake virtue and it targets homosexuals especially. In it, he also defames the emperor Otho for bringing cosmetics while he was on campaign, states that Gracchus, a noble, married another man, but will remain infertile despite any number of whippings during Lupercalia, and he also says the ghosts of great Romans would feel ill upon seeing such men in the Underworld.

&quot;Satire 3&quot; -- The third satire describes the decision of Umbricius, Juvenal&#x27;s friend, to depart from Rome. Narrated by Umbricius, it states that an honest man cannot survive in Rome and complains about how it is impossible to compete with Greeks and Orientals. Within this Satire, Juvenal calls Rome a, &quot;a chaotic metropolis where life has become dangerous for honest men&quot; 

&quot;Satire 4&quot; -- The fourth satire is a mock heroic epic, describing a council convened by Domitian. Starting off with an invocation to the muse of epic poetry, Calliope, it mocks the absurdity of the situation with a fake sense of importance. Within it, Juvenal is summoned to the council to determine how to cook the gigantic turbot (&quot;rhombus&quot;) given to Domitian as a gift. It also discusses various other events, such as Crispinus buying a singular mullet at the outrageous price of 6,000 sesterces.

&quot;Satire 5&quot; -- The fifth satire describes the shame experienced by a client when his patron, Virro, finally decided to extend to him an invitation to his dinner party. it criticizes the client, stating that, &quot;a poor man’s stomach is easy to please, yet you suffer insults at a dinner party just for a free meal&quot;. It also states that, though they are at the same table, they are being treated completely differently, with the client being given much worse food while Virro eats delicacies. Overall, this satire is a brutal commentary on the social inequality of ancient Rome, where the wealthy give their dependents the bare minimum in exchange for their loyalty.

===Book II===

&quot;Satire 6&quot; -- The sixth satire is Juvenal&#x27;s longest, at 661 lines, and his most famous. Addressing a man, that Juvenal calls delusional enough to think about getting married, he expounds the immorality and &#x27;vices&#x27; of women. In it, he claims that women are unfaithful, and that they relentlessly seek abortions, murder their stepchildren, and use potions to drive their husbands insane. Thus he proposes suicide as a &#x27;painless alternative&#x27; to marriage. Two noteworthy phrases from this satire are &#x27;rara avis&#x27;, (lit. &#x27;rare bird&#x27;), which refers to good women as a black swan, or hard to come by, and another is the line &#x27;quis custodiet ipsos custodes&#x27;, (lit. &#x27;who will guard the guards themselves&#x27;).

===Book III===

&quot;Satire 7&quot; -- The seventh satire laments the decline of intellectual pursuits and the miserable circumstances of contemporary authors, pining for the patronage enjoyed by . Opening with a prayer for better treatment of scholars under a new emperor, possibly Hadrian, the satire criticizes how learned men are underpaid while public entertainers, like the actor Paris, are excessively compensated. This actor, Paris, may have been the man that he was possibly exiled for slandering. 

&quot;Satire 8&quot; -- The eighth satire takes issue with the idea that noble birth defines a person’s worth, stating that true nobility comes from virtue, not their pedigree. Juvenal argues that relying on the achievements of one&#x27;s ancestors is meaningless if the individual is inferior to them. He points out that many nobles do nothing to earn their status, likening it to racehorses valued for their speed rather than their lineage—if they are slow, they are sent to pull carts. Thus, Juvenal implies that if a noble is inferior, he should be regarded as so, as well. Furthermore, he criticizes Nero, stating that he utterly debased himself in spending lavishly on sports.

&quot;Satire 9&quot; -- The ninth satire is a conversation between the narrator and Naevolus, a male prostitute who is upset that his hard work isn’t paying off. Naevolus talks about serving rich, effeminate men who do not want to spend money on his services. Naevolus also talks about how he saved one man’s marriage, but now the man wants someone else. To which, the narrator tells him that rich men have no secrets and that he will always find a patron, and Naevolus worries about growing older and losing his appeal.

===Book IV===

&quot;Satire 10&quot; -- The tenth satire focuses on the foolishness of human desires, showing how things like wealth, power, beauty, long life, and even children, are not truly good in themselves. Juvenal argues that these desires can often lead to harm. For example, wealth can destroy, power is fleeting, and even fame or military glory can bring ruin. Juvenal highlights examples like Sejanus, Hannibal, and Alexander the Great to show how these worldly pursuits end in disappointment, even if they were less of a disappointment than him. The satire ends by suggesting that instead of seeking these things, people should trust the gods to choose what’s best for them. The famous phrase &quot;mens sana in corpore sano&quot; (lit. a healthy mind in a healthy body) is found within this satire, emphasizing the importance of wellbeing.

&quot;Satire 11&quot; -- The eleventh satire focuses on moderation, mainly in food and the Roman cena (formal dinner). Juvenal contrasts the lavish spending habits of gourmands with the simplicity and moderation of a meal made from home-grown foods. In the first section, he criticizes those who refuse to spend less on luxuries, even at the cost of going into debt, and urges the wisdom of Apollo’s advice to “know thyself,” not just in aspirations, but in what one spends on food. The narrator then invites a friend, Persicus, to his house to demonstrate his own moderation, serving only simple foods from his Tiburtine land. He talks about how ancient Romans, like the noble Curius, were content with humble food, while modern wealthy people demand luxuries like ivory tables and professional meat carvers. Instead of a pornographic Spanish dance show, Juvenal says the evening’s entertainment after the dinner will be poetry.

&quot;Satire 12&quot; -- The twelfth satire features a narrator describing to Corvinus the vows he made to the Roman gods-- Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva— along with his Lares (family gods) to ensure the safety of his friend Catullus during a dangerous storm at sea. Despite the threat of the storm, which led Catullus to sacrifice valuable possessions for his life, the narrator says that his sacrifices are not for personal gain-- unlike the legacy hunters who might sacrifice anything, including slaves or children, to secure an inheritance. After the storm, the sailors managed to reach the port at Ostia, and the narrator prepares an altar to make his offerings. The narrator clarifies that since Catullus has heirs, his actions in helping Catullus are motivated by friendship, not by a desire for wealth.

===Book V===

&quot;Satire 13&quot; -- The thirteenth satire is a reflection on the dangers of revenge when one is wronged. The narrator begins by stating that guilt is its own punishment and he suggests that experience can help defend against the whims of Fortuna. He also acknowledges that the world is corrupt and that the Golden Age was vastly superior to the present (a point he brought up in Satire 7 as well). Juvenal also points out that financial loss is often mourned more than death itself and he criticizes people that are surprised by the scale of crime in Rome, likening it to being surprised by a German with blue eyes. He also calls revenge foolish, citing philosophers like Chrysippos, Thales, and Socrates, who would not endorse such actions. He also references a story from Herodotus about a corrupt Spartan consulting the Oracle at Delphi, stating that merely intending to do evil makes one immediately guilty.

&quot;Satire 14&quot; -- The fourteenth satire says that children learn vice from their parents, stressing the injustice of a father punishing a son for imitating his own faults. Juvenal says that people are more concerned with presenting a clean atrium to guests than with maintaining a virtuous household for their children, and gives various examples, such as Caetronius and his son both squandering wealth on extravagant houses, and stating that religious customs, like Judaism, are learned from one&#x27;s parents. Juvenal claims that avaricious individuals risk their lives for these unimportant gains, for example, how Alexander the Great&#x27;s realization that Diogenes, content with little, was happier than he. Ultimately, the satire says that truly being content lies in possessing as much as Epicurus or Socrates found sufficient, or, in Roman terms, a modest fortune within the equestrian order; if such wealth does not satisfy, then Juvenal states that not even the riches of Croesus or Persia will be enough.

&quot;Satire 15&quot; -- The fifteenth satire talks about the importance of compassion in maintaining civilization. Juvenal states that while extreme circumstances have sometimes forced people into desperate actions for survival, even the most savage societies have historically refrained from cannibalism. He recounts a recent incident in Upper Egypt where two rival cities, consumed by hatred, escalated a minor conflict into full-blown violence, leading to the horrific act of eating a fallen enemy raw. In contrast, Juvenal says that the Vascones, besieged by Pompey, resorted to cannibalism only out of necessity, and even the infamous human sacrifices at the altar of Artemis in Taurus did not involve consumption of flesh. At the end, Juvenal says that compassion is what makes humans and animals different, along with our ability to cry, as people are endowed not only with life but also with reason, enabling them to build civilization.

&quot;Satire 16&quot; -- The sixteenth satire discusses the advantnages that soldiers enjoy over ordinary citizens. Juvenal says that soldiers are immune to civilian justice, as any legal action against them must take place within the camp, where a plaintiff stands little chance and may even face violence for their efforts. Unlike civilians, soldiers are not subjected to the delays of the legal system and possess the right to make a will while their father is still alive-- an inversion of the usual family hierarchy that places the son, a soldier, above his own father. This satire, although left incomplete due to only 60 lines being preserved, showed Juvenal&#x27;s expertise in law and adds credit to him possibly working in the legal system prior to writing his &quot;Satires&quot;.

== Modern criticism and historical context ==

While Juvenal&#x27;s mode of satire has been noted from antiquity for its wrathful scorn toward all representatives of social deviance, some politically progressive scholars, such as William S. Anderson and later Susanna M. Braund, have attempted to defend his work as that of a rhetorical &quot;persona&quot; (mask), taken up by the author to critique the very attitudes he appears to be exhibiting in his works.

In any case it would be an error to read the &quot;Satires&quot; as a literal account of normal Roman life and thought in the late first and early second centuries CE, just as it would be an error to give credence to every slander recorded in Suetonius against the members of prior imperial dynasties. Themes similar to those of the &quot;Satires&quot; are present in authors spanning the period of the late Roman Republic and early Roman Empire ranging from Cicero and Catullus to Martial and Tacitus; similarly, the stylistics of Juvenal&#x27;s text fall within the range of post-Augustan literature, as represented by Persius, Statius, and Petronius.

Juvenal&#x27;s &quot;Satires&quot;, giving several accounts of Jewish life in first-century Rome, have been regarded by scholars, such as J. Juster and, more recently, Peter Nahon, as a valuable source about early Judaism.

==Literary and cultural influence==

The &quot;Satires&quot; have inspired many authors, including Samuel Johnson, who modeled his &quot;London&quot; on &quot;Satire III&quot; and his &quot;The Vanity of Human Wishes&quot; on &quot;Satire X&quot;. Alexander Theroux, whose novels are rife with vicious satire, identified Juvenal as his most important influence. Juvenal also provided a source for the name for a forensically important beetle, Histeridae. Juvenal is the source of many well-known maxims, including:
*that the common people—rather than caring about their freedom—are only interested in &quot;bread and circuses&quot; (&quot;panem et circenses&quot; 10.81; i.e. food and entertainment),
*that—rather than for wealth, power, eloquence, or children—one should pray for a &quot;sound mind in a sound body&quot; (&quot;mens sana in corpore sano&quot; 10.356),
*that a perfect wife is a &quot;rare bird&quot; (&quot; in terris nigroque simillima cycno&quot; 6.165; a rare bird in the earth, a modified form of which is the modern phrase &quot;a black swan&quot;, since black swans are rarer than white.)
*that &quot;honesty is praised and left out in the cold&quot; &quot;Probitas laudatur et alget&quot; (I, line 74).
*and the troubling question of who can be trusted with power—&quot;who will watch the watchers?&quot; or &quot;who will guard the guardians themselves?&quot; (&quot;quis custodiet ipsos custodes&quot; 6.347–48).

ASICS, the footwear and sports equipment manufacturing company, is named after the acronym of the Latin phrase &quot;&quot;anima sana in corpore sano&quot;&quot; (a sound mind in a sound body) from &quot;Satire&quot; X by Juvenal (10.356).

In his autobiography, the German writer Heinrich Böll notes that in the high school he attended when growing up under Nazi rule, an anti-Nazi teacher paid special attention to Juvenal: &quot;Mr. Bauer realized how topical Juvenal was, how he dealt at length with such phenomena as arbitrary government, tyranny, corruption, the degradation of public morals, the decline of the Republican ideal and the terrorizing acts of the Praetorian Guards. (...) In a second-hand bookshop I found an 1838 translation of Juvenal with an extensive commentary, twice the length of the translated text itself, written at the height of the Romantic period. Though its price was more than I could really afford, I bought it. I read all of it very intensely, as if it was a detective novel. It was one of the few books to which I persistently held on throughout the war and beyond, even when most of my other books were lost or sold on the black market&quot;.

<doc id="15837" wikidata="Q83158" url="?curid=15837" title="Jean Cocteau">
<text>Jean Maurice Eugène Clément Cocteau ( , ; ; 5 July 1889 11 October 1963) was a French poet, playwright, novelist, designer, film director, visual artist and critic. He was one of the foremost avant-garde artists of the 20th-century and hugely influential on the surrealist and Dadaist movements, among others. The &quot;National Observer&quot; suggested that &quot;of the artistic generation whose daring gave birth to Twentieth Century Art, Cocteau came closest to being a Renaissance man&quot;.

He is best known for his novels (1923), (1928), and (1929); the stage plays (1930), (1934), (1938), (1941), and (1946); and the films &quot;The Blood of a Poet&quot; (1930), (1948), &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1946), &quot;Orpheus&quot; (1950), and &quot;Testament of Orpheus&quot; (1960), which alongside &quot;Blood of a Poet&quot; and &quot;Orpheus&quot; constitute the so-called Orphic Trilogy. He was described as &quot;one of [the] avant-garde&#x27;s most successful and influential filmmakers&quot; by AllMovie. Cocteau, according to Annette Insdorf, &quot;left behind a body of work unequalled for its variety of artistic expression&quot;.

Though his body of work encompassed many different mediums, Cocteau insisted on calling himself a poet, classifying the great variety of his works poems, novels, plays, essays, drawings, films as , , , , and .

==Biography==
===Early life===
Cocteau was born in Maisons-Laffitte, Yvelines, to Georges Cocteau and Eugénie Lecomte, a socially prominent Parisian family. His father, a lawyer and amateur painter, died by suicide when Cocteau was nine. From 1900 to 1904, Cocteau attended the Lycée Condorcet where he met and began a relationship with schoolmate Pierre Dargelos, who reappeared throughout Cocteau&#x27;s work &quot;John Cocteau: Erotic Drawings&quot;. He left home at fifteen. He published his first volume of poems, &quot;Aladdin&#x27;s Lamp&quot;, at nineteen. Cocteau soon became known in Bohemian artistic circles as &quot;The Frivolous Prince&quot;, the title of a volume he published at twenty-two. Edith Wharton described him as a man &quot;to whom every great line of poetry was a sunrise, every sunset the foundation of the Heavenly City...&quot;

===Early career===


In his early twenties, Cocteau became associated with the writers Marcel Proust, André Gide, and Maurice Barrès. In 1912, he collaborated with Léon Bakst on &quot;Le Dieu bleu&quot; for the Ballets Russes; the principal dancers being Tamara Karsavina and Vaslav Nijinsky. During World War I, Cocteau served in the Red Cross as an ambulance driver. This was the period in which he met the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, artists Pablo Picasso and Amedeo Modigliani, and numerous other writers and artists with whom he later collaborated. Russian impresario Sergei Diaghilev persuaded Cocteau to write a scenario for a ballet, which resulted in &quot;Parade&quot; in 1917. It was produced by Diaghilev, with sets by Picasso, the libretto by Apollinaire and the music by Erik Satie. &quot;If it had not been for Apollinaire in uniform,&quot; wrote Cocteau, &quot;with his skull shaved, the scar on his temple and the bandage around his head, women would have gouged our eyes out with hairpins.&quot;

An important exponent of avant-garde art, Cocteau had great influence on the work of others, including a group of composers known as Les Six. In the early twenties, he and other members of Les Six frequented a wildly popular bar named Le Boeuf sur le Toit, a name that Cocteau himself had a hand in picking. The popularity was due in no small measure to the presence of Cocteau and his friends.

===Friendship with Raymond Radiguet===

In 1918 he met the French poet Raymond Radiguet. They collaborated extensively, socialized, and undertook many journeys and vacations together. Cocteau also got Radiguet exempted from military service. Admiring of Radiguet&#x27;s great literary talent, Cocteau promoted his friend&#x27;s works in his artistic circle and arranged for the publication by Grasset of &quot;Le Diable au corps&quot; (a largely autobiographical story of an adulterous relationship between a married woman and a younger man), exerting his influence to have the novel awarded the &quot;Nouveau Monde&quot; literary prize. Some contemporaries and later commentators thought there might have been a romantic component to their friendship. Cocteau himself was aware of this perception, and worked earnestly to dispel the notion that their relationship was sexual in nature.

There is disagreement over Cocteau&#x27;s reaction to Radiguet&#x27;s sudden death in 1923, with some claiming that it left him stunned, despondent and prey to opium addiction. Opponents of that interpretation point out that he did not attend the funeral (he generally did not attend funerals) and immediately left Paris with Diaghilev for a performance of &quot;Les noces&quot; (&quot;The Wedding&quot;) by the Ballets Russes at Monte Carlo. His opium addiction at the time, Cocteau said, was only coincidental, due to a chance meeting with Louis Laloy, the administrator of the Monte Carlo Opera. Cocteau&#x27;s opium use and his efforts to stop profoundly changed his literary style. His most notable book, &quot;Les Enfants Terribles&quot;, was written in a week during a strenuous opium weaning. In &quot;&quot;, he recounts the experience of his recovery from opium addiction in 1929. His account, which includes vivid pen-and-ink illustrations, alternates between his moment-to-moment experiences of drug withdrawal and his current thoughts about people and events in his world. Cocteau was supported throughout his recovery by his friend and correspondent, Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain. Under Maritain&#x27;s influence, Cocteau made a temporary return to the sacraments of the Catholic Church. He again returned to the Church later in life and undertook a number of religious art projects.

===Further works===
On 15 June 1926 Cocteau&#x27;s play &quot;Orphée&quot; was staged in Paris. It was quickly followed by an exhibition of drawings and &quot;constructions&quot; called &quot;Poésie plastique–objets, dessins&quot;. Cocteau wrote the libretto for Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s opera-oratorio &quot;Oedipus rex&quot;, which had its original performance in the Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt in Paris on 30 May 1927. In 1929 one of his most celebrated and well-known works, the novel &quot;Les Enfants terribles&quot; was published.

In 1930 Cocteau made his first film &quot;The Blood of a Poet&quot;, publicly shown in 1932. Though now generally accepted as a surrealist film, the surrealists themselves did not accept it as a truly surrealist work. Although this is one of Cocteau&#x27;s best-known works, his 1930s are notable rather for a number of stage plays, above all &quot;La Voix humaine&quot; and &quot;Les Parents terribles&quot;, which was a popular success. His 1934 play &quot;La Machine infernale&quot; was Cocteau&#x27;s stage version of the Oedipus legend and is considered to be his greatest work for the theatre. During this period Cocteau also published two volumes of journalism, including &quot;Mon Premier Voyage: Tour du Monde en 80 jours&quot;, a neo-Jules Verne around the world travel reportage he made for the newspaper Paris-Soir.

===1940–1944===
Throughout his life, Cocteau tried to maintain a distance from political movements, confessing to a friend that &quot;my politics are non-existent&quot;. According to Claude Arnaud, from the 1920s on, Cocteau&#x27;s only deeply held political convictions were a marked pacifism and antiracism. He praised the French republic for serving as a haven for the persecuted, and applauded Picasso&#x27;s anti-war painting &quot;Guernica&quot; as a cross that &quot;Franco would always carry on his shoulder&quot;. In 1940, Cocteau signed a petition circulated by the Ligue internationale contre l&#x27;antisémitisme (International League Against Antisemitism) which protested the rise of racism and antisemitism in France, and declared himself &quot;ashamed of his white skin&quot; after witnessing the plight of colonized peoples during his travels.

Although in 1938 Cocteau had compared Adolf Hitler to an evil demiurge who wished to perpetrate a Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre against Jews, his friend Arno Breker convinced him that Hitler was a pacifist and patron of the arts with France&#x27;s best interests in mind. During the Nazi occupation of France, he was in a &quot;round-table&quot; of French and German intellectuals who met at the Georges V Hotel in Paris, including Cocteau, the writers Ernst Jünger, Paul Morand and Henry Millon de Montherlant, the publisher Gaston Gallimard and the Nazi legal scholar Carl Schmitt. In his diary, Cocteau accused France of disrespect towards Hitler and speculated on the Führer&#x27;s sexuality. Cocteau effusively praised Breker&#x27;s sculptures in an article entitled published in 1942. This piece caused him to be arraigned on charges of collaboration after the war, though he was cleared of any wrongdoing and had used his contacts for his failed attempt to save friends such as Max Jacob. Later, after growing closer with communists such as Louis Aragon, Cocteau would name Joseph Stalin as &quot;the only great politician of the era&quot;.

In 1940, , Cocteau&#x27;s play written for and starring Édith Piaf (who died the day before Cocteau), was enormously successful.

===Later years===
Cocteau&#x27;s later years are mostly associated with his films. Cocteau&#x27;s films, most of which he both wrote and directed, were particularly important in introducing the avant-garde into French cinema and influenced to a certain degree the upcoming French New Wave genre.

Following &quot;The Blood of a Poet&quot; (1930), his best known films include &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1946), &quot;Les Parents terribles&quot; (1948), and &quot;Orpheus&quot; (1949). His final film, &quot;Le Testament d&#x27;Orphée&quot; (&quot;The Testament of Orpheus&quot;) (1960), featured appearances by Picasso and matador Luis Miguel Dominguín, along with Yul Brynner, who also helped finance the film.

In 1945 Cocteau was one of several designers who created sets for the Théâtre de la Mode. He drew inspiration from filmmaker René Clair while making &quot;Tribute to René Clair: I Married a Witch&quot;. The maquette is described in his &quot;Journal 1942–1945&quot;, in his entry for 12 February 1945: 

In 1956 Cocteau decorated the &quot;Chapelle Saint-Pierre&quot; in Villefranche-sur-Mer with mural paintings. The following year he also decorated the marriage hall at the Hôtel de Ville in Menton.

===Private life===
Jean Cocteau never hid his bisexuality. He was the author of the mildly homoerotic and semi-autobiographical &quot;Le Livre blanc&quot; (translated as &quot;The White Paper&quot; or &quot;The White Book&quot;), published anonymously in 1928. He never repudiated its authorship and a later edition of the novel features his foreword and drawings. The novel begins:

Frequently his work, either literary (&quot;Les enfants terribles&quot;), graphic (erotic drawings, book illustration, paintings) or cinematographic (&quot;The Blood of a Poet&quot;, &quot;Orpheus&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;), is pervaded with homosexual undertones, homoerotic imagery/symbolism or camp. In 1947 Paul Morihien published a clandestine edition of &quot;Querelle de Brest&quot; by Jean Genet, featuring 29 very explicit erotic drawings by Cocteau. In recent years several albums of Cocteau&#x27;s homoerotica have been available to the general public.

In the 1930s, Cocteau is rumoured to have had a very brief affair with Princess Natalie Paley, the daughter of a Romanov Grand Duke and herself a sometime actress, model, and former wife of couturier Lucien Lelong.

Cocteau&#x27;s longest-lasting relationships were with French actors Jean Marais and , whom Cocteau formally adopted. Cocteau cast Marais in &quot;The Eternal Return&quot; (1943), &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1946), &quot;Ruy Blas&quot; (1947), and &quot;Orpheus&quot; (1949).

===Death===
Cocteau died of a heart attack at his château in Milly-la-Forêt, Essonne, France, on 11 October 1963 at the age of 74. His friend, French singer Édith Piaf, died the day before but that was announced on the morning of Cocteau&#x27;s day of death; it has been said, in a story which is almost certainly , that his heart failed upon hearing of Piaf&#x27;s death. Cocteau&#x27;s health had already been in decline for several months, and he had previously had a severe heart attack on 22 April 1963. A more plausible suggestion for the reason behind this decline in health has been proposed by author Roger Peyrefitte, who notes that Cocteau had been devastated by a breach with his longtime friend, socialite and notable patron Francine Weisweiller, as a result of an affair she had been having with a minor writer. Weisweiller and Cocteau did not reconcile until shortly before Cocteau&#x27;s death.

According to his wishes, Cocteau is buried beneath the floor of the Chapelle Saint-Blaise des Simples in Milly-la-Forêt. The epitaph on his gravestone set in the floor of the chapel reads: &quot;I stay with you&quot; ().

==Honours and awards==
In 1955, Cocteau was made a member of the Académie Française and The Royal Academy of Belgium.

During his life, Cocteau was commander of the Legion of Honor, Member of the Mallarmé Academy, German Academy (Berlin), American Academy, Mark Twain (U.S.A) Academy, Honorary President of the Cannes Film Festival, Honorary President of the France-Hungary Association and President of the Jazz Academy and the Academy of the Disc.

<text>John Donne ( ; 1571 or 1572 – 31 March 1631) was an English poet, scholar, soldier and secretary born into a recusant family, who later became a cleric in the Church of England. Under Royal Patronage, he was made Dean of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London (1621–1631). He is considered the preeminent representative of the metaphysical poets. His poetical works are noted for their metaphorical and sensual style and include sonnets, love poems, religious poems, Latin translations, epigrams, elegies, songs and satires. He is also known for his sermons.

Donne&#x27;s style is characterised by abrupt openings and various paradoxes, ironies and dislocations. These features, along with his frequent dramatic or everyday speech rhythms, his tense syntax and his tough eloquence, were both a reaction against the smoothness of conventional Elizabethan poetry and an adaptation into English of European baroque and mannerist techniques. His early career was marked by poetry that bore immense knowledge of English society. Another important theme in Donne&#x27;s poetry is the idea of true religion, something that he spent much time considering and about which he often theorised. He wrote secular poems as well as erotic and love poems. He is particularly famous for his mastery of metaphysical conceits.

Despite his great education and poetic talents, Donne lived in poverty for several years, relying heavily on wealthy friends. He spent much of the money he inherited during and after his education on womanising, literature, pastimes and travel. In 1601, Donne secretly married Anne More, with whom he had twelve children. In 1615 he was ordained Anglican deacon and then priest, although he did not want to take holy orders and only did so because the king ordered it. He served as a member of Parliament in 1601 and in 1614.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Donne was born in London in 1571 or 1572, into a recusant Roman Catholic family when practice of that religion was illegal in England. Donne was the third of six children. His father, also named John Donne, was married to Elizabeth Heywood. He was of Welsh descent and a warden of the Ironmongers Company in the City of London. He avoided unwelcome government attention out of fear of religious persecution.

His father died in 1576, when Donne was four years old, leaving his mother, Elizabeth, with the responsibility of raising the children alone. Heywood was also from a recusant Roman Catholic family, the daughter of John Heywood, the playwright, and sister of the Reverend Jasper Heywood, a Jesuit priest and translator. She was a great-niece of Thomas More. A few months after her husband died, Donne&#x27;s mother married John Syminges, a wealthy widower with three children of his own.

Donne was educated privately. There is no evidence to support the popular claim that he was taught by Jesuits. In 1583, at the age of 11, he began studies at Hart Hall, now Hertford College, Oxford. After three years of studies there, Donne was admitted to the University of Cambridge, where he studied for another three years. Donne could not obtain a degree from either institution because of his Catholicism, since he refused to take the Oath of Supremacy required to graduate. In 1591 he was accepted as a student at the Thavies Inn legal school, one of the Inns of Chancery in London. On 6 May 1592, he was admitted to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, one of the Inns of Court.

In 1593, five years after the defeat of the Spanish Armada and during the intermittent Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604), Queen Elizabeth issued the first English statute against sectarian dissent from the Church of England, titled &quot;An Act for restraining Popish recusants&quot;. It defined &quot;Popish recusants&quot; as those &quot;convicted for not repairing to some Church, Chapel, or usual place of Common Prayer to hear Divine Service there, but forbearing the same contrary to the tenor of the laws and statutes heretofore made and provided in that behalf&quot;. Donne&#x27;s brother Henry was also a university student prior to his arrest in 1593 for harbouring a Catholic priest, William Harrington, and died in Newgate Prison of bubonic plague, leading Donne to begin questioning his Catholic faith.

During and after his education, Donne spent much of his considerable inheritance on women, literature, pastimes and travel. Although no record details precisely where Donne travelled, he crossed Europe. He later fought alongside the Earl of Essex and Sir Walter Raleigh against the Spanish at Cadiz (1596) and the Azores (1597), and witnessed the loss of the Spanish flagship, the &quot;San Felipe&quot;. According to Izaak Walton, his earliest biographer, 
By the age of 25 he was well prepared for the diplomatic career he appeared to be seeking. He was appointed chief secretary to the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, Sir Thomas Egerton, and was established at Egerton&#x27;s London home, York House, Strand, close to the Palace of Whitehall, then the most influential social centre in England.

===Marriage to Anne More===
During the next four years, Donne fell in love with Egerton&#x27;s niece Anne More. They were secretly married just before Christmas in 1601, against the wishes of both Egerton and Anne&#x27;s father George More, who was Lieutenant of the Tower. Upon discovery, this wedding ruined Donne&#x27;s career, getting him dismissed and put in Fleet Prison, along with the Church of England priest Samuel Brooke, who married them, and his brother Christopher, who stood in, in the absence of George More, to give Anne away. Donne was released shortly thereafter when the marriage was proved to be valid, and he soon secured the release of the other two. Walton tells us that when Donne wrote to his wife to tell her about losing his post, he wrote after his name: &quot;John Donne, Anne Donne, Un-done.&quot; It was not until 1609 that Donne was reconciled with his father-in-law and received his wife&#x27;s dowry.

After his release, Donne had to accept a retired country life in a small house in Pyrford, Surrey, owned by Anne&#x27;s cousin, Sir Francis Wooley, where they lived until the end of 1604. In spring 1605 they moved to another small house in Mitcham, Surrey, where he scraped a meagre living as a lawyer, while Anne Donne bore a new baby almost every year. Though he also worked as an assistant pamphleteer to Thomas Morton writing anti-Catholic pamphlets, Donne was in a constant state of financial insecurity.

Anne gave birth to twelve children in sixteen years of marriage, including two stillbirths—their eighth and then, in 1617, their last child. The ten surviving children were Constance, John, George, Francis, Lucy (named after Donne&#x27;s patron Lucy, Countess of Bedford, her godmother), Bridget, Mary, Nicholas, Margaret and Elizabeth. Three, Francis, Nicholas and Mary, died before they were ten. 

In a state of despair that almost drove him to kill himself, Donne noted that the death of a child would mean one mouth fewer to feed, but he could not afford the burial expenses. During this time, Donne wrote but did not publish &quot;Biathanatos&quot;, his defence of suicide. His wife died on 15 August 1617, five days after giving birth to their twelfth child, a still-born baby. Donne mourned her deeply, and wrote of his love and loss in his Holy Sonnet.

===Career and later life===
In 1602, Donne was elected as a member of parliament (MP) for the constituency of Brackley, but the post was not a paid position. Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603, being succeeded by King James VI of Scotland as King James I of England. The fashion for coterie poetry of the period gave Donne a means to seek patronage. Many of his poems were written for wealthy friends or patrons, especially for MP Sir Robert Drury of Hawsted (1575–1615), whom he met in 1610 and who became his chief patron, furnishing him and his family an apartment in his large house in Drury Lane.

In 1610 and 1611, Donne wrote two anti-Catholic polemics: &quot;Pseudo-Martyr&quot; and &quot;Ignatius His Conclave&quot; for Morton. He then wrote two Anniversaries, &quot;&quot; (1611) and &quot;Of the Progress of the Soul&quot; (1612) for Drury.

Donne sat as an MP again, this time for Taunton, in the Addled Parliament of 1614. Though he attracted five appointments within its business he made no recorded speech. Although King James was pleased with Donne&#x27;s work, he refused to reinstate him at court and instead urged him to take holy orders. At length, Donne acceded to the king&#x27;s wishes, and in 1615 was an ordained priest in the Church of England.

In 1615, Donne was awarded an honorary doctorate in divinity from Cambridge University. He became a Royal Chaplain in the same year. He became a reader of divinity at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1616, where he served in the chapel as minister until 1622. In 1618, he became chaplain to Viscount Doncaster, who was an ambassador to the princes of Germany. Donne did not return to England until 1620. In 1621, Donne was made Dean of St Paul&#x27;s, a leading and well-paid position in the Church of England, which he held until his death in 1631.

In 1616 he was granted the living as rector of two parishes, Keyston in Huntingdonshire and Sevenoaks in Kent, and in 1621 of Blunham, in Bedfordshire, all held until his death. Blunham Parish Church has an imposing stained glass window commemorating Donne, designed by Derek Hunt. During Donne&#x27;s period as dean his daughter Lucy died, aged eighteen. In late November and early December 1623 he suffered a nearly fatal illness, thought to be either typhus or a combination of a cold followed by a period of fever.

During his convalescence he wrote a series of meditations and prayers on health, pain and sickness that were published as a book in 1624 under the title of &quot;Devotions upon Emergent Occasions&quot;. One of these meditations, , contains the well-known phrases &quot;No man is an &quot;Iland&quot;&quot; (often modernised as &quot;No man is an island&quot;) and &quot;...for whom the &quot;bell&quot; tolls&quot;. In 1624, he became vicar of St Dunstan-in-the-West, and in 1625 a prolocutor to Charles I. He earned a reputation as an eloquent preacher. 160 of his sermons have survived, including Death&#x27;s Duel, his famous delivered at the Palace of Whitehall before King Charles I in February 1631.

===Death===
Donne died on 31 March 1631. He was buried in old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, where a memorial statue of him by Nicholas Stone was erected with a Latin epigraph probably composed by himself. The memorial was one of the few to survive the Great Fire of London in 1666 and is now in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. The statue was said by Izaac Walton in his biography, to have been modelled from the life by Donne to suggest his appearance at the resurrection. It started a vogue of such monuments during the 17th century. In 2012, a bust of the poet by Nigel Boonham was unveiled outside in the cathedral churchyard.

==Writings==
Donne&#x27;s earliest poems showed a developed knowledge of English society coupled with sharp criticism of its problems. His satires dealt with common Elizabethan topics, such as corruption in the legal system, mediocre poets and pompous courtiers. His images of sickness, vomit, manure and plague reflected his strongly satiric view of a society populated by fools and knaves. His third satire, however, deals with the problem of true religion, a matter of great importance to Donne. He argued that it was better to examine carefully one&#x27;s religious convictions than blindly to follow any established tradition, for none would be saved at the Final Judgment, by claiming &quot;A Harry, or a Martin taught [them] this.&quot;

Donne&#x27;s early career was also notable for his erotic poetry, especially his elegies, in which he employed unconventional metaphors, such as a flea biting two lovers being compared to sex. Donne did not publish these poems, although they circulated widely in manuscript form. One such, a previously unknown manuscript that is believed to be one of the largest contemporary collections of Donne&#x27;s work (among that of others), was found at Melford Hall in November 2018.

Some have speculated that Donne&#x27;s numerous illnesses, financial strain and the deaths of his friends all contributed to the development of a more sombre and pious tone in his later poems. The change can be clearly seen in &quot;&quot; (1611), a poem that Donne wrote in memory of Elizabeth Drury, daughter of his patron, Sir Robert Drury of Hawstead, Suffolk. This poem treats Elizabeth&#x27;s demise with extreme gloominess, using it as a symbol for the fall of man and the destruction of the universe.

The increasing gloominess of Donne&#x27;s tone may also be observed in the religious works that he began writing during the same period. Having converted to the Anglican Church, Donne quickly became noted for his sermons and religious poems. Towards the end of his life Donne wrote works that challenged death, and the fear that it inspired in many, on the grounds of his belief that those who die are sent to Heaven to live eternally. One example of this challenge is his Holy Sonnet X, &quot;Death Be Not Proud&quot;.

Even as he lay dying during Lent in 1631, he rose from his sickbed and delivered the Death&#x27;s Duel sermon, which was later described as his own funeral sermon. Death&#x27;s Duel portrays life as a steady descent to suffering and death; death becomes merely another process of life, in which the &#x27;winding sheet&#x27; of the womb is the same as that of the grave. Hope is seen in salvation and immortality through an embrace of God, Christ and the Resurrection.

==Style==
His work has received much criticism over the years, especially concerning his metaphysical form. Donne is generally considered the most prominent member of the metaphysical poets, a phrase coined in 1781 by Samuel Johnson, following a comment on Donne by John Dryden. Dryden had written of Donne in 1693: &quot;He affects the metaphysics, not only in his satires, but in his amorous verses, where nature only should reign; and perplexes the minds of the fair sex with nice speculations of philosophy, when he should engage their hearts, and entertain them with the softnesses of love.&quot;

In &quot;Life of Cowley&quot; (from Samuel Johnson&#x27;s 1781 work of biography and criticism &quot;Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets&quot;), Johnson refers to the beginning of the 17th century in which there &quot;appeared a race of writers that may be termed the metaphysical poets&quot;. Donne&#x27;s immediate successors in poetry therefore tended to regard his works with ambivalence, with the Neoclassical poets regarding his conceits as abuse of the metaphor. However, he was revived by Romantic poets such as Coleridge and Browning, though his more recent revival in the early 20th century by poets such as T. S. Eliot and critics like F. R. Leavis tended to portray him, with approval, as an anti-Romantic.

Donne is considered a master of the metaphysical conceit, an extended metaphor that combines two vastly different ideas into a single idea, often using imagery. An example of this is his equation of lovers with saints in &quot;The Canonization&quot;. Unlike the conceits found in other Elizabethan poetry, most notably Petrarchan conceits, which formed clichéd comparisons between more closely related objects (such as a rose and love), metaphysical conceits go to a greater depth in comparing two completely unlike objects. One of the most famous of Donne&#x27;s conceits is found in &quot;A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning&quot; where he compares the apartness of two separated lovers to the working of the legs of a compass.

Donne&#x27;s works are also witty, employing paradoxes, puns and subtle yet remarkable analogies. His pieces are often ironic and cynical, especially regarding love and human motives. Common subjects of Donne&#x27;s poems are love (especially in his early life), death (especially after his wife&#x27;s death) and religion.

John Donne&#x27;s poetry represented a shift from classical forms to more personal poetry. Donne is noted for his poetic metre, which was structured with changing and jagged rhythms that closely resemble casual speech (it was for this that the more classical-minded Ben Jonson commented that &quot;Donne, for not keeping of accent, deserved hanging&quot;).

Some scholars believe that Donne&#x27;s literary works reflect the changing trends of his life, with love poetry and satires from his youth and religious sermons during his later years. Other scholars, such as Helen Gardner, question the validity of this dating—most of his poems were published posthumously (1633). The exception to these is his &quot;Anniversaries&quot;, which were published in 1612 and &quot;Devotions upon Emergent Occasions&quot; published in 1624. His sermons are also dated, sometimes specifically by date and year.

==Legacy==

Donne is remembered in the Calendar of Saints of the Church of England, the Episcopal Church liturgical calendar and the Calendar of Saints of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America for his life as both poet and priest. His commemoration is on 31 March.

During his lifetime several likenesses were made of the poet. The earliest was the anonymous portrait of 1594 now in the National Portrait Gallery, London, which was restored in 2012. One of the earliest Elizabethan portraits of an author, the fashionably dressed poet is shown darkly brooding on his love. The portrait was described in Donne&#x27;s will as &quot;that picture of myne wych is taken in the shaddowes&quot;, and bequeathed by him to Robert Kerr, 1st Earl of Ancram. Other paintings include a 1616 head and shoulders after Isaac Oliver, also in the National Portrait Gallery, and a 1622 head and shoulders in the Victoria and Albert Museum. In 1911, the young Stanley Spencer devoted a visionary painting to &quot;John Donne arriving in heaven&quot; (1911) which is now in the Fitzwilliam Museum.

Donne&#x27;s reception until the 20th century was influenced by the publication of his writings in the 17th century. Because Donne avoided publication during his life, the majority of his works were brought to the press by others in the decades after his death. These publications present what Erin McCarthy calls a &quot;teleological narrative of Donne&#x27;s growth&quot; from young rake &quot;Jack Donne&quot; to reverend divine &quot;Dr. Donne&quot;. For example, while the first edition of &quot;Poems, by J. D.&quot; (1633) mingled amorous and pious verse indiscriminately, all editions after 1635 separated poems into &quot;Songs and Sonnets&quot; and &quot;Divine Poems&quot;. This organization &quot;promulgated the tale of Jack Donne&#x27;s transformation into Doctor Donne and made it the dominant way of understanding Donne&#x27;s life and work.&quot;

A similar effort to justify Donne&#x27;s early writings appeared in the publication of his prose. This pattern can be seen in a 1652 volume that combines texts from throughout Donne&#x27;s career, including flippant works like &quot;Ignatius His Conclave&quot; and more pious writings like &quot;Essays in Divinity.&quot; In the preface, Donne&#x27;s son &quot;unifies the otherwise disparate texts around an impression of Donne&#x27;s divinity&quot; by comparing his father&#x27;s varied writing to Jesus&#x27; miracles. Christ &quot;&quot;began his first&quot; Miracle &quot;here&quot;, &quot;by turning&quot; Water &quot;into&quot; Wine, &quot;and made it his last to ascend from&quot; Earth &quot;to&quot; Heaven.&quot;

Donne first wrote &quot;&quot;things conducing to cheerfulness &amp; entertainment of&quot; Mankind,&quot; and later &quot;&quot;change[d] his conversation from&quot; Men &quot;to&quot; Angels.&quot; Another figure who contributed to Donne&#x27;s legacy as a rake-turned-preacher was Donne&#x27;s first biographer Izaak Walton. Walton&#x27;s biography separated Donne&#x27;s life into two stages, comparing Donne&#x27;s life to the transformation of St. Paul. Walton writes, &quot;where [Donne] had been a Saul… in his irregular youth,&quot; he became &quot;a Paul, and preach[ed] salvation to his brethren.&quot;

The idea that Donne&#x27;s writings reflect two distinct stages of his life remains common; however, many scholars have challenged this understanding. In 1948, Evelyn Simpson wrote, &quot;a close study of his works... makes it clear that his was no case of dual personality. He was not a Jekyll-Hyde in Jacobean dress... There is an essential unity underlying the flagrant and manifold contradictions of his temperament.&quot;

===In literature===
After Donne&#x27;s death, a number of poetical tributes were paid to him, of which one of the principal (and most difficult to follow) was his friend Lord Herbert of Cherbury&#x27;s &quot;Elegy for Doctor Donne&quot;. Posthumous editions of Donne&#x27;s poems were accompanied by several &quot;Elegies upon the Author&quot; over the course of the next two centuries. Six of these were written by fellow churchmen, others by such courtly writers as Thomas Carew, Sidney Godolphin and Endymion Porter. In 1963 came Joseph Brodsky&#x27;s &quot;The Great Elegy for John Donne&quot;.

Beginning in the 20th century, several historical novels appeared taking as their subject various episodes in Donne&#x27;s life. His courtship of Anne More is the subject of Elizabeth Gray Vining&#x27;s &quot;Take Heed of Loving Me: A novel about John Donne&quot; (1963) and Maeve Haran&#x27;s &quot;The Lady and the Poet&quot; (2010). Both characters also make interspersed appearances in Mary Novik&#x27;s &quot;Conceit&quot; (2007), where the main focus is on their rebellious daughter Pegge. English treatments include Garry O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s &quot;Death&#x27;s Duel: a novel of John Donne&quot; (2015), which deals with the poet as a young man.

He also plays a significant role in Christie Dickason&#x27;s &quot;The Noble Assassin&quot; (2012), a novel based on the life of Donne&#x27;s patron and (the author claims) his lover, Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford. Finally there is Bryan Crockett&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Alchemy: a John Donne Mystery&quot; (2015), in which the poet, blackmailed into service in Robert Cecil&#x27;s network of spies, attempts to avert political disaster and at the same time outwit Cecil.

===Musical settings===
There were musical settings of Donne&#x27;s lyrics even during his lifetime and in the century following his death. These included Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger&#x27;s (&quot;So, so, leave off this last lamenting kisse&quot; in his 1609 Ayres); John Cooper&#x27;s (&quot;The Message&quot;); Henry Lawes&#x27; (&quot;Break of Day&quot;); John Dowland&#x27;s (&quot;Break of Day&quot; and &quot;To ask for all thy love&quot;); and settings of &quot;A Hymn to God the Father&quot; by John Hilton the younger and Pelham Humfrey (published 1688).

After the 17th century, there were no more until the start of the 20th century with Havergal Brian (&quot;A nocturnal on St Lucy&#x27;s Day&quot;, first performed in 1905), Eleanor Everest Freer (&quot;Break of Day, published in 1905) and Walford Davies (&quot;The Cross&quot;, 1909) among the earliest. In 1916–18, the composer Hubert Parry set Donne&#x27;s &quot;Holy Sonnet 7&quot; (&quot;At the round earth&#x27;s imagined corners&quot;) to music in his choral work, &quot;Songs of Farewell&quot;. Regina Hansen Willman set Donne&#x27;s &quot;First Holy Sonnet&quot; for voice and string trio. In 1945, Benjamin Britten set nine of Donne&#x27;s Holy Sonnets in his song cycle for voice and piano &quot;The Holy Sonnets of John Donne&quot;. in 1968, Williametta Spencer used Donne&#x27;s text for her choral work &quot;At the Round Earth&#x27;s Imagined Corners.&quot; Among them is also the choral setting of &quot;Negative Love&quot; that opens &quot;Harmonium&quot; (1981), as well as the aria setting of &quot;Holy Sonnet XIV&quot; at the end of the 1st act of &quot;Doctor Atomic&quot;, both by John Adams.

There have been settings in popular music as well. One is the version of the song &quot;Go and Catch a Falling Star&quot; on John Renbourn&#x27;s debut album &quot;John Renbourn&quot; (1966), in which the last line is altered to &quot;False, ere I count one, two, three&quot;. On their 1992 album &quot;Duality&quot;, the English Neoclassical dark wave band In the Nursery used a recitation of the entirety of Donne&#x27;s &quot;A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning&quot; for the track &quot;Mecciano&quot; and an augmented version of &quot;A Fever&quot; for the track &quot;Corruption.&quot;
Prose texts by Donne have also been set to music. In 1954, Priaulx Rainier set some in her &quot;Cycle for Declamation&quot; for solo voice. In 2009, the American Jennifer Higdon composed the choral piece &quot;On the Death of the Righteous&quot;, based on Donne&#x27;s sermons. Still more recent is the Russian minimalist Anton Batagov&#x27;s &quot; I Fear No More, selected songs and meditations of John Donne&quot; (2015).

<doc id="15839" wikidata="Q312387" url="?curid=15839" title="Joey Ramone">
<text>Jeffrey Ross Hyman (May 19, 1951 – April 15, 2001), known professionally as Joey Ramone, was an American singer, songwriter, and the lead vocalist and founding member of the punk rock band Ramones, along Johnny Ramone and Dee Dee Ramone. His image, voice, and tenure with the Ramones made him a countercultural icon.

Born to a Jewish family in Queens, New York City, he was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder and schizophrenia at age 18. After playing in the glam punk band Sniper from 1972 to 1974, Joey cofounded the Ramones in 1974. Initially the band&#x27;s drummer, Joey switched to lead vocals shortly after the group&#x27;s formation. Appearing on all the band&#x27;s releases, he, along with guitarist Johnny Ramone, are the only two original members who stayed in the band until it disbanded in 1996.

Following the Ramones&#x27; breakup, he embarked on a solo career before dying of lymphoma in 2001. His debut solo album &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry About Me&quot; was released the following year.

== Early life ==

Jeffrey Ross Hyman was born on May 19, 1951, in Queens, New York City, to a Jewish family. His parents were Charlotte (&quot;née&quot; Mandell) and Noel Hyman. It has been claimed he was born with a parasitic twin growing out of his back, which was incompletely formed and surgically removed. The family resided in Forest Hills, Queens, where Hyman and his future Ramones bandmates attended Forest Hills High School. He grew up with his brother Mickey Leigh. Though generally a happy person, Hyman was something of an outcast, diagnosed at 18 with obsessive–compulsive disorder and schizophrenia. His striking physique has been attributed to Marfan&#x27;s Syndrome and his health was often frail. His mother, Charlotte Lesher, owned an art gallery in Queens: having divorced her first husband, Noel Hyman, she married again but was widowed when her second husband died in a car accident while she was on vacation.

Hyman was a fan of the Beatles, the Who, David Bowie, and the Stooges among other bands, particularly oldies and the Phil Spector-produced girl groups. The Who in particular inspired him when he saw them perform at the age of 16.

== Career ==
=== Sniper ===
In 1972 Hyman joined the glam punk band Sniper. Sniper played at the Mercer Arts Center, Max&#x27;s Kansas City and the Coventry, alongside New York Dolls, Suicide, and Queen Elizabeth III. Hyman played with Sniper under the name Jeff Starship.
Hyman continued playing with Sniper until early 1974, when he was replaced by Alan Turner.

=== Ramones ===

In 1974, Jeffrey Hyman co-founded the punk rock band the Ramones with friends John Cummings and Douglas Colvin. Colvin was already using the pseudonym &quot;Dee Dee Ramone&quot; and the others also adopted stage names using &quot;Ramone&quot; as their surname: Cummings became Johnny Ramone and Hyman became Joey Ramone. The name &quot;Ramone&quot; stems from Paul McCartney: he briefly used the stage name &quot;Paul Ramon&quot; during 1960–61, when the Beatles, still an unknown five-piece band called the Silver Beetles, did a tour of Scotland and all took up pseudonyms; and again on the 1969 Steve Miller album &quot;Brave New World&quot;, where he played the drums on one song using that name.

Ramone initially served as the group&#x27;s drummer while Dee Dee Ramone was the original vocalist. However, when Dee Dee&#x27;s vocal cords proved unable to sustain the demands of constant live performances, Ramone&#x27;s manager Thomas Erdelyi suggested Joey switch to vocals. Mickey Leigh: I was shocked when the band came out. Joey was the lead singer and I couldn&#x27;t believe how good he was. Because he&#x27;d been sitting in my house with my acoustic guitar, writing these songs like &#x27;I Don&#x27;t Care&#x27;, fucking up my guitar, and suddenly he&#x27;s this guy on stage who you can&#x27;t take your eyes off of. After a series of unsuccessful auditions in search of a new drummer, Erdelyi took over on drums, assuming the name Tommy Ramone.

The Ramones were a major influence on the punk rock movement in the United States, though they achieved only minor commercial success. Their only record with enough U.S. sales to be certified gold in Ramone&#x27;s lifetime was the compilation album &quot;Ramones Mania&quot;. Recognition of the band&#x27;s importance built over the years, and they are now represented in many assessments of all-time great rock music, such as the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; lists of the 50 Greatest Artists of All Time and 25 Greatest Live Albums of All Time, VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock, and Mojo&#x27;s 100 Greatest Albums. In 2002, the Ramones were voted the second greatest rock and roll band ever in &quot;Spin&quot;, behind the Beatles.

In 1996, after a tour with the Lollapalooza music festival, the band played its final show and then disbanded.

=== Other projects ===

One of Ramone&#x27;s earliest side projects was with a band called The Seclusions in 1983. Ramone sang vocals alongside his brother Leigh on a cover of the song &quot;Nothing Can Change the Shape of Things to Come&quot; from the album &quot;Isolation For Creation&quot;. Also appearing on the track were Jimmy Destri, Holly Beth Vincent, Jimmy Ripp, Busta Jones, and Jay Dee Daugherty.

In 1985, Ramone joined Steven Van Zandt&#x27;s music industry activist group Artists United Against Apartheid, which campaigned against the Sun City resort in South Africa. Ramone and 49 other recording artists – including Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Keith Richards, Lou Reed and Run DMC – collaborated on the song &quot;Sun City&quot;, in which they pledged they would never perform at the resort.

In 1994, Ramone appeared on the Helen Love album &quot;Love and Glitter, Hot Days and Music&quot;, singing the track &quot;Punk Boy&quot;. Helen Love returned the favor, singing on Ramone&#x27;s song &quot;Mr. Punchy&quot;.

In October 1996, Ramone headlined the &quot;Rock the Reservation&quot; alternative rock festival in Tuba City, Arizona. &quot;Joey Ramone &amp; the Resistance&quot; (Daniel Rey on guitar, John Connor on bass guitar and Roger Murdock on drums) debuted Ramone&#x27;s interpretation of Louis Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;Wonderful World&quot; live, as well as Ramone&#x27;s choice of Ramones classics and some of his other favorite songs, such as The Dave Clark Five&#x27;s &quot;Any Way You Want It&quot;, The Who&#x27;s &quot;The Kids are Alright&quot; and The Stooges&#x27; &quot;No Fun&quot;.

Ramone co-wrote and recorded the song &quot;Meatball Sandwich&quot; with Youth Gone Mad. For a short time before his death, he took the role of manager and producer for the punk rock band the Independents.

His last recording as a vocalist was backup vocals on the CD &quot;One Nation Under&quot; by the Dine Navajo rock group Blackfire. He appeared on two tracks, &quot;What Do You See&quot; and &quot;Lying to Myself&quot;.

Ramone produced the Ronnie Spector EP &quot;She Talks to Rainbows&quot; in 1999. It was critically acclaimed but was not very commercially successful. The title track was previously on the Ramones&#x27; final studio album, &quot;¡Adios Amigos!&quot;

== Vocal style ==
Ramone&#x27;s signature cracks, hiccups, snarls, crooning, and youthful voice made him one of punk rock&#x27;s most recognizable voices. Allmusic.com wrote that &quot;Joey Ramone&#x27;s signature bleat was the voice of punk rock in America.&quot; As his vocals matured and deepened through his career, so did the Ramones&#x27; songwriting, leaving a notable difference from his initial melodic and callow style – two notable tracks serving as examples are &quot;Somebody Put Something in My Drink&quot; and &quot;Mama&#x27;s Boy&quot;. Dee Dee Ramone was quoted as saying, &quot;All the other singers [in New York] were copying David Johansen (of the New York Dolls), who was copying Mick Jagger... But Joey was unique, totally unique.&quot;

== Illness and death ==
In 1995, Ramone was diagnosed with lymphoma. He kept his condition private until it was revealed on March 19, 2001, that he was battling the disease. He died of the illness at New York-Presbyterian Hospital on April 15, 2001, a month before he would have turned 50. He was reportedly listening to the song &quot;In a Little While&quot; by U2 when he died. In an interview in 2014 for Radio 538, U2 lead singer Bono stated that Joey Ramone&#x27;s family had told him this; later, Joey&#x27;s friend Andy Shernoff (of The Dictators) also confirmed it. Joey&#x27;s funeral was attended by former bandmates Tommy, Richie and C. J. Ramone, along with Debbie Harry and Chris Stein of Blondie, and Joan Jett. Joey is interred at New Mount Zion Cemetery in Lyndhurst, New Jersey.

His solo album &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry About Me&quot; was released posthumously in 2002, and features the single &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot;, a cover of the Louis Armstrong standard. MTV News said: &quot;With his trademark rose-colored shades, black leather jacket, shoulder-length hair, ripped jeans and alternately snarling and crooning vocals, Joey was the iconic godfather of punk.&quot;

== Legacy ==
On November 30, 2003, a block of East 2nd Street in New York City was officially renamed Joey Ramone Place. It is the block where Hyman once lived with bandmate Dee Dee Ramone and is near the former site of the music club CBGB, where the Ramones began their career. Hyman&#x27;s birthday is celebrated annually during the &quot;Joey Ramone Birthday Bash&quot;, hosted in New York City by his brother and, until 2007, his mother, Charlotte.

In September 2010, the Associated Press reported that the &quot;Joey Ramone Place,&quot; road sign was New York City&#x27;s most stolen sign. Later, the sign was moved to above ground level. Drummer Marky Ramone thought Joey would appreciate that his sign would be the most stolen, adding &quot;Now you have to be an NBA player to see it.&quot;

The Ramones were named as inductees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of the class of 2002.

In 2002 Tommy, C. J., and Marky Ramone and Daniel Rey recorded Jed Davis&#x27; Joey Ramone tribute album, &quot;The Bowery Electric&quot;. 

After several years in development, Ramone&#x27;s second posthumous album was released on May 22, 2012. Titled &quot;...Ya Know?&quot;, it was preceded on Record Store Day by a 7&quot; single re-release of &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot;/&quot;Havana Affair&quot;.

On April 15, 2021, the 20th anniversary of Ramone&#x27;s death, it was announced that Pete Davidson would portray Ramone in the upcoming Netflix biopic, &quot;I Slept with Joey Ramone&quot; which is based on the memoir of the same name written by Ramone&#x27;s brother Mickey Leigh. Leigh will serve as an executive producer. The film is being made with the full cooperation and support of Ramone&#x27;s estate, with a treatment written by Davidson and director Jason Orley.

In 2022, Brookfield Asset Management acquired a majority stake in the music-publishing rights of Ramone for around US$10 million.
