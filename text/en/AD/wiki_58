<doc id="17423" wikidata="Q48685" url="?curid=17423" title="Kingdom of Judah">
<text>The Kingdom of Judah was an Israelite kingdom of the Southern Levant during the Iron Age. Centered in the highlands to the west of the Dead Sea, the kingdom&#x27;s capital was Jerusalem. It was ruled by the Davidic line for four centuries. Jews are named after Judah, and primarily descend from people who lived in the region.

The Hebrew Bible depicts the Kingdom of Judah as one of the two successor states of the United Kingdom of Israel, a term denoting the united monarchy under biblical kings Saul, David, and Solomon and covering the territory of Judah and Israel. However, during the 1980s, some biblical scholars began to argue that the archaeological evidence for an extensive kingdom before the late 8th century BCE is too weak, and that the methodology used to obtain the evidence is flawed. In the 10th and early 9th centuries BCE, the territory of Judah appears to have been sparsely populated, limited to small rural settlements, most of them unfortified. The Tel Dan Stele, discovered in 1993, shows that the kingdom existed in some form by the middle of the 9th century BCE, but it does not indicate the extent of its power. Recent excavations at Khirbet Qeiyafa, however, support the existence of a centrally organized and urbanized kingdom by the 10th century BCE, according to the excavators.

In the 7th century BCE, the kingdom&#x27;s population increased greatly, prospering under Neo-Assyrian vassalage, despite Hezekiah&#x27;s revolt against the Assyrian king Sennacherib. Josiah took advantage of the political vacuum that resulted from Assyria&#x27;s decline and the emergence of Saite Egyptian rule over the area to enact his religious reforms. The Deuteronomistic history, which recounts the history of the people of Israel from Joshua to Josiah and expresses a worldview based on the legal principles found in the Book of Deuteronomy, is assumed to have been written during this same time period and emphasizes the significance of upholding them.

With the final fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 605 BCE, competition emerged between Saite Egypt and the Neo-Babylonian Empire over control of the Levant, ultimately resulting in Judah&#x27;s rapid decline. The early 6th century BCE saw a wave of Egyptian-backed Judahite rebellions against Babylonian rule being crushed. In 587 BCE, Nebuchadnezzar II engaged in a siege of Jerusalem, ultimately destroying the city and ending the kingdom. A large number of Judeans were exiled to Babylon, and the fallen kingdom was then annexed as a Babylonian province.

After the fall of Babylon to the Achaemenid Empire, the Achaemenid king Cyrus the Great allowed the Jews who had been deported after the conquest of Judah to return. They were allowed autonomous rule under Persian governance. It was not until 400 years later, following the Maccabean Revolt, that Judeans fully regained independence.

== Geography ==
The Kingdom of Judah was located in the Judean Mountains, stretching from Jerusalem to Hebron and into the Negev Desert. The central ridge, ranging from forested and shrubland-covered mountains gently sloping towards the hills of the Shephelah in the west, to the dry and arid landscapes of the Judaean Desert descending into the Jordan Valley to the east, formed the kingdom&#x27;s core.

The northern border of Judah extended east–west from the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea, passing near Jericho to the area of Gezer. To the west, the border ran from Gezer across the Shephelah to Beersheba in the northern Negev. In the east, Judah&#x27;s boundaries followed the Arabah to the western shore of the Dead Sea. In prosperous periods, Judah&#x27;s influence expanded, stretching southward to Beersheba and beyond, including Kadesh Barnea and likely Kuntillet Ajrud. Its influence possibly extended to the Gulf of Eilat in the south, as well as the Coastal Plain in the west in Mesad Hashavyahu fortress.

== Archaeological record ==
The formation of the Kingdom of Judah is a subject of heavy debate among scholars, with a dispute emerging between biblical minimalists and biblical maximalists on this particular topic. Due to geopolitical factors like security issues, isolation, and political changes, the core area of the Kingdom of Judah on the south-central highlands has seen limited archaeological exploration compared to regions west of the Jordan River. Few excavations and surveys have been conducted there, creating a notable knowledge gap compared to the extensively-studied Shephelah to the west, which has undergone systematic surveys and numerous scientific excavations.

While it is generally agreed that the narratives of David and Solomon in the 10th century BCE tell little about the origins of Judah, currently, there is no consensus as to whether Judah developed as a split from a unified kingdom Israel (as the Bible claims) or independently. Some scholars suggested that Jerusalem, the kingdom&#x27;s capital, did not emerge as a significant administrative center until the end of the 8th century BCE. Before then, the archaeological evidence suggests its population was too small to sustain a viable kingdom. Other scholars argue that recent discoveries and radiocarbon tests in the City of David seem to indicate that Jerusalem was already a significant city by the 10th century BCE.

Much of the debate revolves around whether the archaeological discoveries conventionally dated to the 10th century should instead be dated to the 9th century, as proposed by Israel Finkelstein. Recent archaeological discoveries by Eilat Mazar in Jerusalem and Yosef Garfinkel in Khirbet Qeiyafa have been interpreted as supporting the existence of the United Monarchy, but the datings and identifications are not universally accepted.

The Tel Dan stele shows a historical &quot;House of David&quot; ruled a kingdom south of the lands of Samaria in the 9th century BCE, and attestations of several Judean kings from the 8th century BCE have been discovered, but they do little to indicate how developed the state actually was. The Nimrud Tablet K.3751, dated c. 733 BCE, is the earliest known record of the name &quot;Judah&quot; (written in Assyrian cuneiform as Ya&#x27;uda or KUR.ia-ú-da-a-a), while an earlier reference to a Judahite envoy seems to appear in a wine list from Nimrud dated to the 780s BCE.

=== Jerusalem ===

The status of Jerusalem in the 10th century BCE is a major subject of debate. The oldest part of Jerusalem and its original urban core are the City of David, which does show evidence of significant Israelite residential activity around the 10th century. Some unique administrative structures such as the Stepped Stone Structure and the Large Stone Structure, which originally formed one structure, contain material culture dated to Iron I. On account of the alleged lack of settlement activity in the 10th century BCE, Israel Finkelstein argues that Jerusalem was then a small country village in the Judean hills, not a national capital, and Ussishkin argues that the city was entirely uninhabited. Amihai Mazar contends that if the Iron I / Iron II A dating of administrative structures in the City of David are correct, which he believes to be the case, &quot;Jerusalem was a rather small town with a mighty citadel, which could have been a center of a substantial regional polity.&quot; William G. Dever argues that Jerusalem was a small and fortified city, probably inhabited only by the royal court, priests and clerks.

=== Literacy ===
A collection of military orders found in the ruins of a military fortress in the Negev dating to the period of the Kingdom of Judah indicates widespread literacy, based on the inscriptions, the ability to read and write extended throughout the chain of command from commanders to petty officers. According to Professor Eliezer Piasetsky, who participated in analyzing the texts, &quot;Literacy existed at all levels of the administrative, military and priestly systems of Judah. Reading and writing were not limited to a tiny elite.&quot; That indicates the presence of a substantial educational infrastructure in Judah at the time.

Archaeological research near the Gihon Spring in the City of David has revealed many anepigraphical bullae (that is, bullae bearing only iconography, no inscriptions) dated to the 11th/10th-9th centuries BCE which feature &quot;papyrus lines&quot; on their backs. It has been argued that these seals provide evidence that papyrus texts were written and used in Jerusalem already from the 10th (perhaps 11th) century BCE onwards.

=== LMLK seals ===
LMLK seals are archaic Hebrew stamp seals on the handles of large storage jars dating from the reign of King Hezekiah (circa 700 BCE) discovered mostly in and around Jerusalem. Several complete jars were found &quot;in situ&quot; buried under a destruction layer caused by Sennacherib at Tel Lachish. None of the original seals has been found, but some 2,000 impressions made by at least 21 seal types have been published.

LMLK stands for the Hebrew letters &quot;lamedh mem lamedh kaph&quot; (), which can be translated as:
* &quot;[belonging] to the king&quot; [of Judah]
* &quot;[belonging] to King&quot; (name of a person or deity)
* &quot;[belonging] to the government&quot; [of Judah]
* &quot;[to be sent] to the King&quot;

=== Everyday life ===
According to a 2022 study, traces of vanilla found in wine jars in Jerusalem might indicate that the local elite enjoyed wine flavored with vanilla during the 7–6th centuries BCE. Until very recently, vanilla was not at all known to be available to the Old World. Archeologists suggested that this discovery might be related to an international trade route that crossed the Negev during that period, probably under Assyrian and later, Third Intermediate Period Egyptian rule.

=== Cities ===
According to Yosef Garfinkel, the fortified cities of the Kingdom of Judah during the 10th century BCE were located at Khirbet Qeiyafa, Tell en-Nasbeh, Khirbet el-Dawwara (by Halhul), Tel Beit Shemesh, and Tell Lachish.

Tel Be&#x27;er Sheva, believed to be the site of the ancient biblical town of Be&#x27;er-sheba, was the main Judahite center in the Negev in the 9th and 8th centuries BCE.

=== Forts ===
The Judaean Mountains and Shephelah have seen the discovery of several Judahite fortresses and towers. The fortifications had a large central courtyard surrounded by casemate walls with chambers on the outside wall, and they were square or rectangular in shape. Khirbet Abu et-Twein, which is situated on the Judaean Mountains between modern day Bat Ayin and Jab&#x27;a, is one of the most noteworthy fortresses from the period. Great views of the Shepehla, including the Judahite towns of Azekah, Socho, Goded, Lachish, and Maresha, could be seen from this fort.

In the northern Negev, Tel Arad served as a key administrative and military stronghold. It protected the route from the Judaean Mountains to the Arabah and on to Moab and Edom. It underwent numerous renovations and extensions. There are several other Judahite forts in the Negev, including Hurvat Uza, Tel Ira, Aroer, Tel Masos, and Tel Malhata. The main Judahite fortification in the Judaean Desert was found at Vered Yeriho; it protected the road from Jericho to the Dead Sea. A few freestanding, elevated, isolated guard towers of the period were found around Jerusalem; towers of this type were discovered in the French Hill and south to Giloh.

It is clear from the position of Judaean strongholds that one of their primary purposes was to facilitate communications via fire signals across the Kingdom, a method well-documented in the Book of Jeremiah and the Lachish letters.

== Biblical narrative ==

===Jeroboam&#x27;s revolt and the partition of the United Monarchy===

According to the biblical account, the United Kingdom of Israel was founded by Saul during the late-11th century BCE, and reached its peak during the rule of David and Solomon. After the death of Solomon circa 930 BCE, the Israelites gathered in Shechem for the coronation of Solomon&#x27;s son and successor, Rehoboam. Before the coronation took place, the northern tribes, led by Jeroboam, asked the new king to reduce the heavy taxes and labor requirements that his father Solomon had imposed. Rehoboam rejected their petition: “I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, I will chastise you with scorpions&quot; (). As a result, ten of the tribes rebelled against Rehoboam and proclaimed Jeroboam their king, forming the northern Kingdom of Israel. At first, only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the House of David, but the tribe of Benjamin soon joined Judah. Both kingdoms, Judah in the south and Israel in the north, co-existed uneasily after the split until the destruction of the Kingdom of Israel by Assyria in 722/721.

=== Relations with the Kingdom of Israel ===
For the first 60 years, the kings of Judah tried to re-establish their authority over Israel, and there was perpetual war between them. Israel and Judah warred throughout Rehoboam&#x27;s 17-year reign. Rehoboam built elaborate defenses and strongholds, along with fortified cities. In the fifth year of Rehoboam&#x27;s reign, Shishak, who is identified as the pharaoh Shoshenq I of the 22nd Dynasty of Egypt, brought a vast army and took many cities. In the sack of Jerusalem (10th century BCE), Rehoboam gave them all of the treasures out of the temple as a tribute and Judah became a vassal state of Egypt.

Rehoboam&#x27;s son and successor, Abijah of Judah, continued his father&#x27;s efforts to bring Israel under his control. He fought the Battle of Mount Zemaraim against Jeroboam of Israel and was victorious with a heavy loss of life on the Israel side. According to the Books of Chronicles, Abijah and his people defeated them with a great slaughter, so that 500,000 chosen men of Israel fell slain, and Jeroboam posed little threat to Judah for the rest of his reign. The border of the tribe of Benjamin was restored to the original tribal border.

Abijah&#x27;s son and successor, Asa of Judah, maintained peace for the first 35 years of his reign, and he revamped and reinforced the fortresses initially built by his grandfather, Rehoboam. II Chronicles states that at the Battle of Zephath, the Egyptian-backed chieftain Zerah the Ethiopian and his million men and 300 chariots were defeated by Asa&#x27;s 580,000 men in the Valley of Zephath near Maresha. The Bible does not state whether Zerah was a pharaoh or a general of the army. The Ethiopians were pursued to Gerar, in the coastal plain, where they stopped out of sheer exhaustion. The resulting peace kept Judah free from Egyptian incursions until the time of Josiah, some centuries later.
In his 36th year, Asa was confronted by Baasha of Israel, who built a fortress at Ramah on the border, less than ten miles from Jerusalem. The capital came under pressure, and the military situation was precarious. Asa took gold and silver from the Temple and sent them to Ben-Hadad I, the king of Aram-Damascus, in exchange for the Damascene king cancelling his peace treaty with Baasha. Ben-Hadad attacked Ijon, Dan and many important cities of the tribe of Naphtali, and Baasha was forced to withdraw from Ramah. Asa tore down the unfinished fortress and used its raw materials to fortify Geba and Mizpah in Benjamin on his side of the border.

Asa&#x27;s successor, Jehoshaphat, changed the policy towards Israel and instead pursued alliances and cooperation with it. The alliance with Ahab was based on marriage. The alliance led to disaster for the kingdom with the Battle of Ramoth-Gilead according to 1 Kings 22. He then allied with Ahaziah of Israel to carry on maritime commerce with Ophir. However, the fleet equipped at Ezion-Geber was immediately wrecked. A new fleet was fitted out without the cooperation of the king of Israel. Although it was successful, the trade was not prosecuted. He joined Jehoram of Israel in a war against the Moabites, who were under tribute to Israel. This war was successful, and the Moabites were subdued. However, on seeing Mesha&#x27;s act of offering his son in a human sacrifice on the walls of Kir of Moab (now al-Karak) filled Jehoshaphat with horror, he withdrew and returned to his land.

Jehoshaphat&#x27;s successor, Jehoram of Judah, formed an alliance with Israel by marrying Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab. Despite the alliance with the stronger northern kingdom, Jehoram&#x27;s rule of Judah was shaky. Edom revolted, and he was forced to acknowledge its independence. A raid by Philistines and Arabs or perhaps South Arabians looted the king&#x27;s house and carried off all of his family except for his youngest son, Ahaziah of Judah.

=== Clash of empires ===

After Hezekiah became the sole ruler in c. 715 BCE, he formed alliances with Ashkelon and Egypt and made a stand against Assyria by refusing to pay tribute. In response, Sennacherib of Assyria attacked the fortified cities of Judah. Hezekiah paid three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold to Assyria, which required him to empty the temple and royal treasury of silver and strip the gold from the doorposts of Solomon&#x27;s Temple. However, Sennacherib besieged Jerusalem in 701 BCE though the city was never taken.
During the long reign of Manasseh (c. 687/686 – 643/642 BCE), Judah was a vassal of Assyrian rulers: Sennacherib and his successors, Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal after 669 BCE. Manasseh is listed as being required to provide materials for Esarhaddon&#x27;s building projects and as one of a number of vassals who assisted Ashurbanipal&#x27;s campaign against Egypt.

When Josiah became king of Judah in c. 641/640 BCE, the international situation was in flux. To the east, the Neo-Assyrian Empire was beginning to disintegrate, the Neo-Babylonian Empire had not yet risen to replace it and Egypt to the west was still recovering from Assyrian rule. In the power vacuum, Judah could govern itself for the time being without foreign intervention. However, in the spring of 609 BCE, Pharaoh Necho II personally led a sizable army up to the Euphrates to aid the Assyrians. Taking the coastal route into Syria at the head of a large army, Necho passed the low tracts of Philistia and Sharon. However, the passage over the ridge of hills, which shuts in on the south the great Jezreel Valley, was blocked by the Judean army, led by Josiah, who may have considered that the Assyrians and the Egyptians were weakened by the death of Pharaoh Psamtik I only a year earlier (610 BCE). Presumably in an attempt to help the Babylonians, Josiah attempted to block the advance at Megiddo, where a fierce battle was fought and Josiah was killed. Necho then joined forces with the Assyrian Ashur-uballit II, and they crossed the Euphrates and lay siege to Harran. The combined forces failed to hold the city after capturing it temporarily, and Necho retreated back to northern Syria. The event also marked the disintegration of the Assyrian Empire.

On his return march to Egypt in 608 BCE, Necho found that Jehoahaz had been selected to succeed his father, Josiah. Necho deposed Jehoahaz, who had been king for only three months, and replaced him with his older brother, Jehoiakim. Necho imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred talents of silver (about 3 tons or about 3.4 metric tons) and a talent of gold (about ). Necho then took Jehoahaz back to Egypt as his prisoner, never to return.

Jehoiakim ruled originally as a vassal of the Egyptians by paying a heavy tribute. However, when the Egyptians were defeated by the Babylonians at Carchemish in 605 BCE, Jehoiakim changed allegiances to pay tribute to Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon. In 601 BCE, in the fourth year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar attempted to invade Egypt but was repulsed with heavy losses. The failure led to numerous rebellions among the states of the Levant that owed allegiance to Babylon. Jehoiakim also stopped paying tribute to Nebuchadnezzar and took a pro-Egyptian position. Nebuchadnezzar soon dealt with the rebellions. According to the Babylonian Chronicles, after invading &quot;the land of Hatti (Syria/Palestine)&quot; in 599 BCE, he laid siege to Jerusalem. Jehoiakim died in 598 BCE during the siege and was succeeded by his son Jeconiah at an age of either eight or eighteen. The city fell about three months later, on 2 Adar (March 16) 597 BCE. Nebuchadnezzar pillaged both Jerusalem and the Temple and carted all of his spoils to Babylon. Jeconiah and his court and other prominent citizens and craftsmen, along with a sizable portion of the Jewish population of Judah, numbering about 10,000 were deported from the land and dispersed throughout the Babylonian Empire. Among them was Ezekiel. Nebuchadnezzar appointed Zedekiah, Jehoiakim&#x27;s brother, the king of the reduced kingdom, who was made a tributary of Babylon.

=== Destruction and dispersion ===

Despite the strong remonstrances of Jeremiah and others, Zedekiah revolted against Nebuchadnezzar by ceasing to pay tribute to him and entered an alliance with Pharaoh Hophra. In 589 BCE, Nebuchadnezzar II returned to Judah and again besieged Jerusalem. Many Jews fled to surrounding Moab, Ammon, Edom and other countries to seek refuge. The city fell after a siege, which lasted either eighteen or thirty months, and Nebuchadnezzar again pillaged both Jerusalem and the Temple and then destroyed both. After killing all of Zedekiah&#x27;s sons, Nebuchadnezzar took Zedekiah to Babylon and so put an end to the independent Kingdom of Judah. According to the Book of Jeremiah, in addition to those killed during the siege, some 4,600 people were deported after the fall of Judah. By 586 BCE, much of Judah had been devastated, and the former kingdom had suffered a steep decline of both its economy and its population.

==Aftermath==
===Babylonian Yehud===
Jerusalem apparently remained uninhabited for much of the 6th century BCE, and the centre of gravity shifted to Benjamin, the relatively unscathed northern section of the kingdom, where the town of Mizpah became the capital of the new Babylonian province of Yehud for the remnant of the Jewish population in a part of the former kingdom. That was standard Babylonian practice. When the Philistine city of Ashkelon was conquered in 604 BCE, the political, religious and economic elite (but not the bulk of the population) was banished and the administrative centre shifted to a new location.

Gedaliah was appointed governor of the Yehud province, supported by a Babylonian guard. The administrative centre of the province was Mizpah in Benjamin, not Jerusalem. On hearing of the appointment, many of the Judeans who had taken refuge in surrounding countries were persuaded to return to Judah. However, Gedaliah was soon assassinated by a member of the royal house, and the Chaldean soldiers killed. The population that was left in the land and those who had returned fled to Egypt for fear a Babylonian reprisal, under the leadership of Yohanan ben Kareah. They ignored the urging of the prophet Jeremiah against the move. In Egypt, the refugees settled in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Noph and Pathros, and possibly Elephantine, and Jeremiah went with them as a moral guardian.

===Exile to Babylon===

The numbers that were deported to Babylon and that made their way to Egypt and the remnant that remained in the land and in surrounding countries are subject to academic debate. The Book of Jeremiah reports that 4,600 were exiled to Babylonia. The two Books of Kings suggest that it was 10,000 and later 8,000.

===Persian Yehud and Hellenistic period.===

In 539 BCE, the Achaemenid Empire conquered Babylonia and allowed the exiles to return to Yehud Medinata and to rebuild the Temple, which was completed in the sixth year of Darius (515 BCE) under Zerubbabel, the grandson of the second to last king of Judah, Jeconiah. Yehud Medinata was a peaceful part of the Achaemenid Empire until its fall in c. 333 BCE to Alexander the Great. Judean independence was reestablished after the Maccabean revolt, and the establishment of the Hasmonean Kingdom in the 2nd century BCE.

Jews are named after Judah, and primarily descend from people who lived in the former Kingdom.

== Religion ==
The major theme of the Hebrew Bible&#x27;s narrative is the loyalty of Judah, especially its kings, to Yahweh, which it states is the God of Israel. Accordingly, all of the kings of Israel (except to some extent Jehu) and many of the kings of Judah were &quot;bad&quot; in terms of the biblical narrative by failing to enforce monotheism. Of the &quot;good&quot; kings, Hezekiah (727–698 BCE) is noted for his efforts at stamping out idolatry (in his case, the worship of Baal and Asherah, among other traditional Near Eastern divinities), but his successors, Manasseh of Judah (698–642 BCE) and Amon (642–640 BCE), revived idolatry, which drew down on the kingdom the anger of Yahweh. King Josiah (640–609 BCE) returned to the worship of Yahweh alone, but his efforts were too late, and Israel&#x27;s unfaithfulness caused God to permit the kingdom&#x27;s destruction by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in the Siege of Jerusalem (587/586 BCE).

It is now widely agreed among academic scholars that the Books of Kings are not an accurate portrayal of religious attitudes in Judah or Israel of the time. Nevertheless, epigraphic evidence attests to Yahweh&#x27;s prominence within Judahite religion.

Evidence of cannabis residues has been found on two altars in Tel Arad dating to the 8th century BC. Researchers believe that cannabis may have been used for ritualistic psychoactive purposes in Judah.

<text>The Kingdom of Israel ( ), also called the Northern Kingdom or the Kingdom of Samaria, was an Israelite kingdom that existed in the Southern Levant during the Iron Age. Its beginnings date back to the first half of the 10th century BCE. It controlled the areas of Samaria, Galilee and parts of Transjordan; the former two regions underwent a period in which a large number of new settlements were established shortly after the kingdom came into existence. It had four capital cities in succession: Shiloh, Shechem, Tirzah, and the city of Samaria. In the 9th century BCE, it was ruled by the Omride dynasty, whose political centre was the city of Samaria.

According to the Hebrew Bible, the territory of the Twelve Tribes of Israel was once amalgamated under a Kingdom of Israel and Judah, which was ruled by the House of Saul and then by the House of David. However, upon the death of Solomon, who was the son and successor of David, there was discontent over his son and successor Rehoboam, whose reign was only accepted by the Tribe of Judah and the Tribe of Benjamin. The unpopularity of Rehoboam&#x27;s reign among the rest of the Israelites, who sought Jeroboam as their monarch, resulted in Jeroboam&#x27;s Revolt, which led to the establishment of the Kingdom of Israel in the north (Samaria), whereas the loyalists of Judah and Benjamin kept Rehoboam as their monarch and established the Kingdom of Judah in the south (Judea), ending Israelite political unity. While the existence of Israel and Judah as two independent kingdoms is not disputed, some historians and archaeologists reject the historicity of a United Monarchy of Israel and Judah.

Around 720 BCE, Israel was conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire. The records of Assyrian king Sargon II indicate that he deported 27,290 Israelites to Mesopotamia. This deportation resulted in the loss of one-fifth of the kingdom&#x27;s population and is known as the Assyrian captivity, which gave rise to the notion of the Ten Lost Tribes. Some of these Israelites, however, managed to migrate to safety in neighbouring Judah, though the Judahites themselves would be conquered by the Neo-Babylonian Empire nearly two centuries later. Those who stayed behind in Samaria following the Assyrian conquest mainly concentrated themselves around Mount Gerizim and eventually came to be known as the Samaritans. The Assyrians, as part of their historic deportation policy, also settled other conquered foreign populations in the territory of Israel.

==History==
According to Israel Finkelstein, Shoshenq I&#x27;s campaign in the second half of the 10th century BCE collapsed the early polity of Gibeon in central highlands, and made possible the beginning of the Northern Kingdom, with its capital at Shechem, around 931 BCE. Israel consolidated as a kingdom in the first half of 9th century BCE, with its capital at Tirzah first, and next at the city of Samaria since 880 BCE. The existence of this Israelite state in the north is documented in 9th century BCE inscriptions. The earliest mention is from the Kurkh stela of c. 853 BCE, when Shalmaneser III mentions &quot;Ahab the Israelite&quot;, plus the denominative for &quot;land&quot;, and his ten thousand troops. This kingdom would have included parts of the lowlands (the Shephelah), the Jezreel plain, lower Galilee and parts of the Transjordan.

Ahab&#x27;s forces were part of an anti-Assyrian coalition, implying that an urban elite ruled the kingdom, possessed a royal and state cult with large urban temples, and had scribes, mercenaries, and an administrative apparatus. In all this, it was similar to other recently founded kingdoms of the time, such as Ammon and Moab. Samaria is one of the most universally accepted archaeological sites from the biblical period. In around 840 BCE, the Mesha Stele records the victory of Moab (in today&#x27;s Jordan), under King Mesha, over Israel, King Omri and his son Ahab.

Archaeological finds, ancient Near Eastern texts, and the biblical record testify that in the time of the Omrides, Israel ruled in the mountainous Galilee, at Hazor in the upper Jordan Valley, in large parts of Transjordan between the Wadi Mujib and the Yarmuk, and in the coastal Sharon plain.

In Assyrian inscriptions, the Kingdom of Israel is referred to as the &quot;House of ʻOmri&quot;. The Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III mentions Jehu, son of ʻOmri. The Neo-Assyrian emperor Adad-nirari III made an expedition into the Levant around 803 BCE mentioned in the Nimrud slab, which lists the places he went to, sometimes using the apellative for &quot;land&quot;, &quot;mat&quot;: the Hatti and Amurru lands, Tyre, Sidon, the &quot;mat&quot; of &quot;Hu-um-ri&quot; (&quot;mat&quot;&quot;Hu-um-ri&quot;, &quot;land of ʻOmri&quot;), Edom, Philistia, and Aram (not Judah). The Tell al-Rimah stela of the same king introduces a third way of talking about the kingdom, as Samaria, in the phrase &quot;Joash of Samaria&quot;. The use of Omri&#x27;s name to refer to the kingdom still survived, and was used by Sargon II in the phrase &quot;the whole house of Omri&quot; in describing his conquest of the city of Samaria in 722 BCE. It is significant that the Assyrians never mention the Kingdom of Judah until the end of the 8th century, when it was an Assyrian vassal state: possibly they never had contact with it, or possibly they regarded it as a vassal of Israel/Samaria or Aram, or possibly the southern kingdom did not exist during this period.

==In the Hebrew Bible==

One traditional source for the history of the Kingdom of Israel has been the Hebrew Bible, especially the Books of Kings and Chronicles. These books were written by authors in Jerusalem, the capital of the Kingdom of Judah. Being written in a rival kingdom, they were inspired by ideological and theological viewpoints that influence the narrative. Anachronisms, legends and literary forms also affect the story. Some of the recorded events are believed to have occurred long after the destruction of the kingdom of Israel. Biblical archaeology has both confirmed and challenged parts of the biblical account. According to the Hebrew Bible, there existed a United Kingdom of Israel (the United Monarchy), ruled from Jerusalem by David and his son Solomon, after whose death Israel and Judah separated into two kingdoms.

The first mention of the name &quot;Israel&quot; is from an Egyptian inscription, the Merneptah Stele, dating from the Late Bronze Age (c. 1208 BCE); this gives little solid information, but indicates that the name of the later kingdom was borrowed rather than originating with the kingdom itself.

===Relationship with the Kingdom of Judah===
According to the Hebrew Bible, for the first sixty years after the split, the kings of Judah tried to re-establish their authority over the northern kingdom, and there was perpetual war between them. For the following eighty years, there was no open war between them, as, for the most part, Judah had engaged in a military alliance with Aram-Damascus, opening a northern front against Israel. The conflict between Israel and Judah was temporarily settled when Jehoshaphat, King of Judah, allied himself with the reigning house of Israel, Ahab, through marriage. Later, Jehosophat&#x27;s son and successor, Jehoram of Judah, married Ahab&#x27;s daughter Athaliah, cementing the alliance. However, the sons of Ahab were slaughtered by Jehu following his coup d&#x27;état around 840 BCE.

===From Hazael to Jeroboam II===
After being defeated by Hazael, Israel began a period of progressive recovery following the campaigns against Aram-Damascus of the Assyrian Adad-nirari III. This ultimately led to a period of major territorial expansion under Jeroboam II, who extended the kingdom&#x27;s possessions throughout the Northern Transjordan. Following Jeroboam II&#x27;s death, the Kingdom experienced a period of decline as a result of sectional rivalries and struggles for the throne.

=== Conquest by the Neo-Assyrian Empire (732–720 BCE) ===

In c. 732 BCE, King Pekah of Israel, while allied with Rezin, king of Aram, threatened Jerusalem. Ahaz, King of Judah, appealed to Tiglath-Pileser III, the King of Assyria, for help. After Ahaz paid tribute to Tiglath-Pileser, Tiglath-Pileser sacked Damascus and Israel, annexing Aram and the territories of the tribes of Reuben, Gad and Manasseh in Gilead, including the desert outposts of Jetur, Naphish and Nodab. People from these tribes, including the Reubenite leader, were taken captive and resettled in the region of the Khabur River system, in Halah, Habor, Hara and Gozan (). Tiglath-Pilesar also captured the territory of Naphtali and the city of Janoah in Ephraim, and an Assyrian governor was placed over the region of Naphtali. According to and , the population of Aram and the annexed part of Israel was deported to Assyria.
The remainder of the northern kingdom of Israel continued to exist within the reduced territory as an independent kingdom until around 720 BCE, when it was again invaded by Assyria and more of the population was deported. Not all of Israel&#x27;s populace was deported by the Assyrians. During the three-year siege of Samaria in the territory of Ephraim by the Assyrians, Shalmaneser V died and was succeeded by Sargon II, who himself records the capture of that city thus: &quot;Samaria I looked at, I captured; 27,280 men who dwelt in it I carried away&quot; into Assyria. Thus, around 720 BCE, after two centuries, the northern kingdom came to an end. Some of the Israelite captives were resettled in the Khabur region, and the rest in the land of the Medes, thus establishing Hebrew communities in Ecbatana and Rages. The Book of Tobit additionally records that Sargon had taken other captives from the northern kingdom to the Assyrian capital of Nineveh, in particular Tobit from the town of Thisbe in Naphtali.

The Hebrew Bible relates that the population of the Kingdom of Israel was exiled, becoming known as the Ten Lost Tribes. To the south, the Tribe of Judah, the Tribe of Simeon (that was &quot;absorbed&quot; into Judah), the Tribe of Benjamin and the people of the Tribe of Levi, who lived among them of the original Israelite nation, remained in the southern Kingdom of Judah. The Kingdom of Judah continued to exist as an independent state until 586 BCE, when it was conquered by the Neo-Babylonian Empire.

====Samaritan tradition====
The tradition of the Samaritan people states that much of the population of the Kingdom of Israel remained in place after the Assyrian captivity, including the Tribes of Naphtali, Manasseh, Benjamin and Levi – being the progenitors of the modern Samaritans. In their book &quot;The Bible Unearthed&quot;, Israeli authors Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman estimate that only a fifth (about 40,000) of the population of the Kingdom of Israel were actually resettled out of the area during the two deportation periods under Tiglath-Pileser III and Sargon II. Many members of these northern tribes also fled south to the Kingdom of Judah. Jerusalem seems to have expanded in size five-fold during this period, requiring a new wall to be built, and a new source of water Siloam to be provided by King Hezekiah.

====Recorded accounts====

In their book &quot;The Bible Unearthed&quot;, Israeli authors Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman estimate that only a fifth (about 40,000) of the population of the northern Kingdom of Israel were actually resettled out of the area during the two deportation periods under Tiglath-Pileser III and Sargon II. No known non-Biblical record exists of the Assyrians having exiled people from four of the tribes of Israel: Dan, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun. Descriptions of the deportation of people from Reuben, Gad, Manasseh, Ephraim and Naphtali indicate that only a portion of these tribes were deported, and the places to which they were deported are known locations given in the accounts. The deported communities are mentioned as still existing at the time of the composition of the Books of Kings and Chronicles and did not disappear by assimilation. 2 Chronicles 30:1–18 explicitly mentions northern Israelites who had been spared by the Assyrians, in particular people of Ephraim, Manasseh, Asher, Issachar and Zebulun, and how members of the latter three returned to worship at the Temple in Jerusalem during the reign of Hezekiah.

===Religion===
The religious climate of the Kingdom of Israel appears to have followed two major trends. The first was the worship of Yahweh; the religion of ancient Israel is sometimes referred to by modern scholars as Yahwism. The Hebrew Bible, however, states that some of the northern Israelites also adored Baal (see and the Baal cycle discovered at Ugarit). The reference in Hosea 10 to Israel&#x27;s &quot;divided heart&quot; may refer to these two cultic observances, although alternatively it may refer to hesitation between looking to Assyria and Egypt for support.

The Jewish Bible also states that Ahab allowed the cult worship of Baal to become acceptable of the kingdom. His wife Jezebel was the daughter of the Phoenician king of Tyre and a devotee to Baal worship ().

===Dynasties===


According to the Bible, the Northern Kingdom had 19 kings across 9 different dynasties throughout its 208 years of existence.

==Mentions of Israel/Samaria in Assyrian literature and inscriptions==
The table below lists all the historical references to the Kingdom of Israel (Samaria) in Assyrian records. King Omri&#x27;s name takes the Assyrian shape of &quot;Humri&quot;, his kingdom or dynasty that of Bit Humri or alike—the &quot;House of Humri/Omri&quot;.

<text>Calligra Words is a word processor, which is part of Calligra Suite and developed by KDE as free software.

== History ==

When the Calligra Suite was formed, unlike the other Calligra applications Words was not a continuation of the corresponding KOffice application – KWord. The Words was largely written from scratch – in May 2011 a completely new layout engine was announced. The first release was made available on , using the version number 2.4 to match the rest of Calligra Suite.

== Reception ==
Initial reception of Calligra Words shortly after the 2.4 release was mixed. While Linux Pro Magazine Online&#x27;s Bruce Byfield wrote “Calligra needed an impressive first release. Perhaps surprisingly, and to the development team’s credit, it has managed one in 2.4.”, he also noted that “Words in particular is still lacking features”. He concluded that Calligra is “worth keeping an eye on”.

On the other hand, Calligra Words became the default word processor in Kubuntu 12.04 – replacing LibreOffice Writer.

== Formula editor ==
Formulas in Calligra Words are provided by the Formula plugin. It is a formula editor with a WYSIWYG interface.

<text>Kenneth Lee Pike (June 9, 1912 – December 31, 2000) was an American linguist and anthropologist. He was the originator of the theory of tagmemics, the coiner of the terms &quot;emic&quot; and &quot;etic&quot; and the developer of the constructed language Kalaba-X for use in teaching the theory and practice of translation.

In addition, he was the First President of the Bible-translating organization Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), with which he was associated from 1935 until his death.

==Life==
Pike was born in Woodstock, Connecticut, and studied theology at Gordon College, graduating with a B.A. in 1933. He initially wanted to do missionary work in China. When this was denied him, he studied linguistics with the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL). He went to Mexico with SIL, learning Mixtec from native speakers there in 1935.

In 1937 Pike went to the University of Michigan, where he worked for his doctorate in linguistics under Charles C. Fries. His research involved living among the Mixtecs and developing a written system for the Mixtec language with his wife, Evelyn. After receiving his Ph.D. in 1942, Pike became the First President of the Summer Institute in Linguistics. Its main function was to produce translations of the Bible in unwritten languages, and in 1951 Pike published the &quot;Mixtec New Testament&quot;. He was the President of SIL International from 1942 to 1979.

As well as and in parallel with his role at SIL, Pike spent thirty years at the University of Michigan, during which time he served as chairman of its linguistics department, professor of linguistics, and director of its English Language Institute (he did pioneering work in the field of English language learning and teaching)
and was later Professor Emeritus of the university.

==Work==
Pike is best known for his distinction between the &quot;emic&quot; and the &quot;etic&quot;. &quot;Emic&quot; (as in &quot;phonemics&quot;) refers to the role of cultural and linguistic categories as understood from within the cultural or linguistic system that they are a part of, while &quot;etic&quot; (as in &quot;phonetics&quot;) refers to the analytical study of those sounds grounded outside of the system itself. Pike argued that only native speakers are competent judges of emic descriptions, and are thus crucial in providing data for linguistic research, while investigators from outside the linguistic group apply scientific methods in the analysis of language, producing etic descriptions which are verifiable and reproducible. Pike himself carried out studies of indigenous languages in Australia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Ghana, Java, Mexico, Nepal, New Guinea, Nigeria, the Philippines, and Peru.

Pike developed his theory of &quot;tagmemics&quot; to help with the analysis of languages from Central and South America, by identifying (using both semantic and syntactic elements) strings of linguistic elements capable of playing a number of different roles.

Pike&#x27;s approach to the study of language put him outside the circle of the &quot;generative&quot; movement begun by Noam Chomsky, a dominant linguist in the 20th century, since Pike believed that the structure of language should be studied in context, not just as single sentences, as seen in the title of his magnum opus, &quot;Language in Relation to a Unified Theory of the Structure of Human Behavior&quot; (1967).

He became well known for his &quot;monolingual demonstrations.&quot; He would stand before an audience, with a large number of chalkboards. A speaker of a language unknown to him would be brought in to work with Pike. Using gestures and objects, not asking questions in a language that the person might know, Pike would begin to analyze the language before the audience.

==Honors==
Pike was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Linguistic Society of America (LSA), the Linguistic Association of Canada and the United States (LACUS), and the American Anthropological Association. He served as president of LSA and LACUS and later was nominated for the Templeton Prize three years in a row.

When he was named to the Charles Carpenter Fries Professorship of Linguistics at the University of Michigan in 1974, the Dean&#x27;s citation noted that &quot;his lifelong originality and energetic activity verge on the legendary.&quot; Pike was awarded honorary degrees by a number of institutions, including Huntington College, University of Chicago, Georgetown University, L&#x27;Université Réné Descartes (Sorbonne), and Albert-Ludwig Universität. Though the Nobel Prize committee did not publicize nominations, in 1983 US Senator Alan J. Dixon and US Congressman Paul Simon announced that they had nominated Pike for the Nobel Peace Prize. Academic sponsors for his nomination included Charles F. Hockett, Sydney Lamb (Rice University), Gordon J. van Wylen (Hope College), Frank H. T. Rhodes (Cornell University), André Martinet (Sorbonne), David C.C. Li (National Taiwan Normal University), and Ming Liu (Chinese University of Hong Kong).

<text>K-Meleon is a free and open-source, lightweight web browser for Microsoft Windows. It uses the native Windows API to create its user interface. Early versions of K-Meleon rendered web pages with Gecko, Mozilla&#x27;s browser layout engine, which Mozilla&#x27;s browser Firefox and its email client Thunderbird also use. K-Meleon became a popular Windows browser and was available as an optional default browser in Europe via BrowserChoice.eu. K-Meleon continued to use Gecko for several years after Mozilla deprecated embedding it. Current versions of K-Meleon use the Goanna layout engine, a fork of Gecko created for the browser Pale Moon.

K-Meleon began with the goal of being faster and lighter than Mozilla&#x27;s original Internet suite. Until 2011, K-Meleon embedded Gecko in a stripped-down interface. Throughout its lifespan, K-Meleon has required small amounts of random-access memory (RAM). K-Meleon 76 supports discontinued versions of Windows such as Windows XP and Windows Vista. Mozilla no longer supports these platforms after their Firefox Quantum rewrite.

Customization is another primary design goal. Users can change the toolbars, menus, and keyboard shortcuts from text-based configuration files. K-Meleon supports macros, which are small browser extensions that users can examine, write, or edit in a text editor. K-Meleon&#x27;s custom configuration files can trigger macros. Reviews describe the customization features as versatile but intimidating to the average user. Due to its adaptability, K-Meleon was recommended for Internet cafés and libraries in the early 2000s.

== History ==

Christophe Thibault started the K-Meleon project in the 2000s, when many new browsers were launched. To open-source their once-dominant Netscape Communicator Internet suite, Netscape founded the Mozilla project. K-Meleon was one of several browsers to use Mozilla&#x27;s browser engine Gecko. Thibault designed K-Meleon to combine Gecko with native Windows interface elements, an approach that was less resource-intensive and allowed the browser to blend into its environment.

=== Embedding Gecko ===
Christophe Thibault released K-Meleon 0.1 on August 21, 2000. While working at Nullsoft, Thibault said he created the first simple release to attract attention, during a day off. For the 0.2 release, he implemented features like context menus and moved development to SourceForge to welcome contributions from open-source developers.

Thibault handed the project over to new developers, including Brian Harris, Sebastian Spaeth, Jeff Doozan, and Ulf Erikson, who began implementing browser functions through modular Kplugins. The K-Meleon team released new versions with pop-up blocking and cookie management. These releases introduced text-based configuration files called configs that allowed users to customize the browser or hide interface elements, and a macro language to extend the browser. Early reviews described K-Meleon as small, fast, limited, and visually similar to Internet Explorer.

K-Meleon was built with open-source code from Mozilla but its narrower focus offered advantages over the Mozilla Application Suite, which bundled the browser with applications for email, news, chat, and webpage editing. To create a stand-alone browser, the Galeon project embedded Mozilla&#x27;s rendering engine. Galeon was released for Linux using GNOME&#x27;s widget toolkit GTK. K-Meleon brought a similar approach to Windows using the operating system&#x27;s native application programming interface (API) to create a lightweight user interface (UI). The K-Meleon developers released a stand-alone web browser for Windows two years before the Firefox alpha release. Mozilla created user interfaces via their cross-platform XML User Interface Language (XUL) layer. This technology used Gecko to lay out application interfaces. XUL allowed Mozilla to build one application for multiple operating systems but generated graphical controls that did not match the rest of the system. K-Meleon was smaller and more closely integrated into the Windows desktop than Mozilla&#x27;s browser, and could use the native bookmarking system to access Internet Explorer&#x27;s favorites.

K-Meleon 0.7 was released with the Mozilla 1.0 engine in October 2002. Despite AOL disbanding upstream parent company Netscape in 2003, the development of K-Meleon continued. Mozilla continued work on Gecko, and K-Meleon was updated with service packs and version 0.8. In 2005, Ulf Erikson announced version 0.9 would be the final version of K-Meleon he would build. He was the project&#x27;s developer but stated he was no longer using K-Meleon as his primary browser after moving to Linux. In January 2006, Dorian Boissonnade became the lead developer and began working towards a 1.0 release.

K-Meleon 1.0 was released in July 2006 and made the browser fully translatable. It stored localizations in separate library-and-config files within existing K-Meleon installations. Parts of the browser could be translated in a text editor. K-Meleon 1.0 maintained support for its existing system of text-based configuration files and introduced a new graphical interface to change preferences from within the browser.

Version 1.1 expanded the macro system. Earlier versions placed all of the macros into a single config file. Initial releases came with fewer than 50 lines of macro code and instructions for end users to create their own macros. Later versions came with over 1,000 lines of macro code, and the macros users wrote and shared online. In response, K-Meleon developers separated macros into modules. Version 1.5 introduced a true tabbed interface.

In Europe, version 1.5 was an optional default Windows browser through Microsoft&#x27;s browser ballot. Due to accusations of abusing its market position to promote Internet Explorer, Microsoft introduced a browser ballot in the European Economic Area (EEA). By 2010, it offered Windows users a choice of the 12 most popular web browsers, including K-Meleon.

=== 7x releases ===

In 2011, Mozilla ended support for embedding the Gecko layout engine; because K-Meleon had previously relied on this API, the browser&#x27;s future became uncertain. In 2013, after years without an official, stable release, the K-Meleon group began developing version 74. While Mozilla had ended support for embedding of Gecko, it maintained a technology called XULRunner. XULRunner was a stand-alone implementation of the Gecko engine designed to launch applications. K-Meleon 74 used XULRunner instead of Mozilla&#x27;s deprecated embedding software. Outside the new engine, version 74 brought small improvements, including better CPU use and minor bug fixes.

K-Meleon 75 included a spelling checker, form auto-completion, and a new skin system. Boissonnade began work on version 76 but suffered a hard disk drive failure during beta testing.

=== Goanna branch ===
Active development on K-Meleon takes place using Goanna, a fork of Gecko created for the browser Pale Moon. With Firefox Quantum, Mozilla rewrote large parts of its browser engine. In 2017, Roy Tam forked K-Meleon 76 to run on Goanna. The project&#x27;s former lead developer Boissonnade wrote; &quot;Thanks for taking care of that little lizard [after I] left it&quot;. K-Meleon on Goanna remains compatible with deprecated versions of Windows and can run with smaller amounts of RAM than those required by mainstream web browsers. K-Meleon has lower memory requirements than other low-resource browsers.

K-Meleon is updated on a rolling release schedule. By default, the browser is a multi-lingual portable application that can directly run from the host computer or removable media. It is also included in the PortableApps.com repository. By 2023, K-Meleon was not compatible with major web apps and social media sites. As of October 2024, the final planned is release is version 76.5.5.

== Customization ==
Customization of K-Meleon&#x27;s interface is possible using text-format configuration files called configs. The menus, keyboard shortcuts, and more can all be customized via K-Meleon&#x27;s configuration files. These configs can call upon macros, a type of extension that can be opened in a text editor.

A simple &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program could be written in K-Meleon&#x27;s macro language that would pop up a small window with the message &quot;Hello world!&quot;.
HelloWorld{
 alert(&quot;Hello world!&quot;);


To trigger the macro, a keyboard accelerator could be created by adding the code below to the accelerator config, causing the macro to launch if the Ctrl, Alt, and H keys are pressed at the same time.
CTRL ALT H = macros(HelloWorld)
Custom toolbars offer more options, but the syntax is similar. The example below would create a new toolbar with a button to trigger a macro.
NewToolbar{
 !NewButton{
 macros(HelloWorld)
}
This combination of configs and macro modules provides control over much of the browser. It also creates a learning curve for customization that is not present in most browsers. A CNET review criticized K-Meleon because it &quot;requires some knowledge of computer code to get the most out of it&quot;. Popular browsers use systems like WebExtensions, where there is a separation between users and extension developers.

Because of its flexibility, K-Meleon was useful for environments in which the browser needed to be customized for public use, such as libraries and Internet cafés. It allowed administrators to hide some features from patrons. For example, a library could hide interface elements like the address bar or limit the computer&#x27;s access to an online resource like the library catalog.

== Legacy Windows versions ==

K-Meleon supports a range of legacy software and hardware. Version 76 supports Windows XP (2001) and Windows Vista (2006). Windows XP and its Windows Embedded POSReady 2009 variant have been unsupported since 2019. The latest major browser releases to support these operating systems are Microsoft&#x27;s Internet Explorer 8 (2014), Google Chrome 49.0.2623.112 (2016), and Mozilla Firefox 52.9.0 (2018).

Web browsers cannot access secure websites if they do not support Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption. As of 2018, most major web sites use TLS encryption via HTTPS. Early versions of K-Meleon for Windows 2000 and Windows 9X receive occasional updates for TLS certificates. K-Meleon 74 can access secure websites on Windows 2000 using an old version of the Goanna engine combined with up-to-date ciphers. K-Meleon 1.5 can run on Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Me. Occasional TLS updates allow version 1.5 to access secure websites.

== Release history ==

K-Meleon, which was first released in 2000, has been under development for over 20 years and is still maintained. The most-recent version K-Meleon 76 is updated on a rolling release schedule. All versions of K-Meleon are written for Microsoft Windows operating systems.

<text>Klaus Maria Brandauer (; born Klaus Georg Steng; 22 June 1943) is an Austrian actor and director. He is also a professor at the Max Reinhardt Seminar.

Brandauer is known internationally for his roles in &quot;Mephisto&quot; (1981), &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; (1983), &quot;Hanussen&quot; (1988), &quot;Burning Secret&quot; (1988), &quot;The Russia House&quot; (1990), and &quot;White Fang&quot; (1991). 

For his supporting role as Bror von Blixen-Finecke in &quot;Out of Africa&quot; (1985), Brandauer was nominated for an Academy Award and won a Golden Globe Award.

Brandauer has a working knowledge of and has acted in at least five languages including German, Italian, Hungarian, English and French.

== Personal life ==
Brandauer was born as Klaus Georg Steng in Bad Aussee, Austria (then part of the German Reich). He is the son of Maria Brandauer and Georg Steng (or Stenj), a civil servant. He subsequently took his mother&#x27;s name as part of his professional name, Klaus Maria Brandauer.

His first wife was Karin Katharina Müller (14 October 1945 – 13 November 1992), an Austrian film and television director and screenwriter, from 1963 until her death in 1992, aged 47, from cancer. Both were teenagers when they married, in 1963. They had one son, Christian. Brandauer married Natalie Krenn in 2007.

== Career ==

Brandauer began acting on stage in 1962. After working in national theatre and television, he made his film debut in English in 1972, in &quot;The Salzburg Connection&quot;. In 1975 he played in &quot;Derrick&quot; – in Season 2, Episode 8 called &quot;Pfandhaus&quot;. His starring and award-winning role in István Szabó&#x27;s &quot;Mephisto&quot; (1981) playing a self-absorbed actor, launched his international career. (He would later act in Szabó&#x27;s 1985 &quot;Oberst Redl&quot;.)

Following his role in &quot;Mephisto&quot;, Brandauer appeared as Maximillian Largo in &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; (1983), a remake of the 1965 James Bond film &quot;Thunderball&quot;. Roger Ebert said of his performance: &quot;For one thing, there&#x27;s more of a human element in the movie, and it comes from Klaus Maria Brandauer, as Largo. Brandauer is a wonderful actor, and he chooses not to play the villain as a cliché. Instead, he brings a certain poignancy and charm to Largo, and since Connery always has been a particularly human James Bond, the emotional stakes are more convincing this time.&quot;

He starred in &quot;Out of Africa&quot; (1985), opposite Meryl Streep and Robert Redford. Brandauer was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe for the performance. In 1987, he was the Head of the Jury at the 37th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1988 he appeared in &quot;Hanussen&quot; opposite Erland Josephson and Ildikó Bánsági.

Brandauer was originally cast as Marko Ramius in &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;. That role eventually went to Sean Connery, who played James Bond to Brandauer&#x27;s Largo in &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;. He co-starred with Connery again in &quot;The Russia House&quot; (1990).

His other film roles have been in &quot;The Lightship&quot; (1986), &quot;Streets of Gold&quot; (1986), &quot;Burning Secret&quot; (1988), &quot;White Fang&quot; (1991), &quot;Becoming Colette&quot; (1991), &quot;Introducing Dorothy Dandridge&quot; (1999, as director Otto Preminger), and &quot;Everyman&#x27;s Feast&quot; (2002). In 1989 he participated in TF1&#x27;s two-part historical film &quot;La Révolution française&quot;, playing the role of Georges Danton. He has also appeared as King Nebuchadnezzar II in 1998, in Time Life&#x27;s Jeremiah, from The Bible Collection: The Old Testament.

Brandauer has directed two films: &quot;&quot; (1989), in which he starred as attempted Hitler assassin Georg Elser; and &quot;Mario and the Magician&quot; (1994), based on the 1929 novella by Thomas Mann, in which he starred as Cipolla, a magician with hypnotic powers.

In August 2006, Brandauer&#x27;s much-awaited production of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; gained a mixed reception. Brandauer had resisted questions about how his production of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill&#x27;s classic musical comedy about the criminal MacHeath would differ from earlier versions, and his production featured Mack the Knife in a three-piece suit and white gloves, stuck to Brecht&#x27;s text, and avoided any references to contemporary politics or issues.

<doc id="17441" wikidata="Q829092" url="?curid=17441" title="Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker">
<text>The Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker is an American military aerial refueling tanker aircraft that was developed from the Boeing 367-80 prototype, alongside the Boeing 707 airliner. It has a narrower fuselage and is shorter than the 707. Boeing gave the aircraft the internal designation of Model 717 (number later assigned to a different Boeing aircraft). The KC-135 was the United States Air Force (USAF)&#x27;s first jet-powered refueling tanker and replaced the KC-97 Stratofreighter. The KC-135 was initially tasked with refueling strategic bombers, but it was used extensively in the Vietnam War and later conflicts such as Operation Desert Storm to extend the range and endurance of US tactical fighters and bombers.

The KC-135 entered service with the USAF in 1957; it is one of nine military fixed-wing aircraft (six American, three Russian) with over 60 years of continuous service with its original operator. The KC-135 was supplemented by the larger McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extender. Studies have concluded that many of the aircraft could be flown until 2030, although maintenance costs have greatly increased. The KC-135 is to be partially replaced by the Boeing KC-46 Pegasus.

==Development==
===Background===
Starting in 1950 the USAF operated the world&#x27;s first production aerial tanker, the Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter, a gasoline fueled piston-engined Boeing Stratocruiser (USAF designation C-97 Stratofreighter) with a Boeing-developed flying boom and extra kerosene (jet fuel) tanks feeding the boom. The Stratocruiser airliner itself was developed from the Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber after World War II. In the KC-97, the mixed gasoline/kerosene fuel system was clearly not desirable and it was obvious that a jet-powered tanker aircraft would be the next development, having a single type of fuel for both its own engines and for passing to receiver aircraft. The 230 mph (370 km/h) cruise speed of the slower, piston-engined KC-97 was also a serious issue, as using it as an aerial tanker forced the newer jet-powered military aircraft to slow down to mate with the tanker&#x27;s boom.

Like its sibling, the commercial Boeing 707 jet airliner, the KC-135 was derived from the Boeing 367-80 jet transport &quot;proof of concept&quot; demonstrator, which was commonly called the &quot;Dash-80&quot;. The KC-135 is similar in appearance to the 707, but has a narrower fuselage and is shorter than the 707. The KC-135 predates the 707, and is structurally quite different from the civilian airliner. Boeing gave the future KC-135 tanker the initial designation Model 717.
In 1954 USAF&#x27;s Strategic Air Command (SAC) held a competition for a jet-powered aerial refueling tanker. Lockheed Corporation&#x27;s tanker version of the proposed Lockheed L-193 airliner with rear fuselage-mounted engines was declared the winner in 1955. Since Boeing&#x27;s proposal was already flying, the KC-135 could be delivered two years earlier and Air Force Secretary Harold E. Talbott ordered 250 KC-135 tankers until Lockheed&#x27;s design could be manufactured. In the end, orders for the Lockheed tanker were dropped rather than supporting two tanker designs. Lockheed never produced its jet airliner, while Boeing would eventually dominate the market with a family of airliners based on the 707.

In 1954, the USAF placed an initial order for 29 KC-135As, the first of an eventual 820 of all variants of the basic C-135 family. The first aircraft flew in August 1956 and the initial production Stratotanker was delivered to Castle Air Force Base, California, in June 1957. The last KC-135 was delivered to the USAF in 1965.
Developed in the early 1950s, the basic airframe is characterized by 35-degree aft swept wings and tail, four underwing-mounted engine pods, a horizontal stabilizer mounted on the fuselage near the bottom of the vertical stabilizer with positive dihedral on the two horizontal planes and a hi-frequency radio antenna which protrudes forward from the top of the vertical fin or stabilizer. These basic features make it strongly resemble the commercial Boeing 707 and 720 aircraft, although it is a different aircraft.

Reconnaissance and command post variants of the aircraft, including the RC-135 Rivet Joint and EC-135 Looking Glass aircraft were operated by SAC from 1963 through 1992, when they were reassigned to the Air Combat Command (ACC). The USAF EC-135 Looking Glass was subsequently replaced in its role by the U.S. Navy E-6 Mercury aircraft, a new build airframe based on the Boeing 707-320B.

=== Engine retrofits ===
All KC-135s were originally equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney J57-P-59W turbojet engines, which produced of thrust dry, and approximately of thrust wet. Wet thrust is achieved through the use of water injection on takeoff, as opposed to &quot;wet thrust&quot; when used to describe an afterburning engine. of water are injected into the engines over the course of three minutes. The water is injected into the inlet and the diffuser case in front of the combustion case. The water cools the air in the engine to increase its density; it also reduces the turbine gas temperature, which is a primary limitation on many jet engines. This allows the use of more fuel for proper combustion and creates more thrust for short periods of time, similar in concept to &quot;War Emergency Power&quot; in a piston-engined aircraft.
In the 1980s, the first modification program retrofitted 157 Air Force Reserve (AFRES) and Air National Guard (ANG) tankers with the Pratt &amp; Whitney TF33-PW-102 turbofan engines from 707 airliners retired in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The modified tanker, designated the KC-135E, was 14% more fuel-efficient than the KC-135A and could offload 20% more fuel on long-duration flights. Only the KC-135E aircraft were equipped with thrust reversers for aborted takeoffs and shorter landing roll-outs. The KC-135E fleet has since either been retrofitted as the R-model configuration or placed into long-term storage (&quot;XJ&quot;), as Congress has prevented the USAF from formally retiring them. The final KC-135E, tail number &quot;56-3630&quot;, was delivered by the 101st Air Refueling Wing to the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base in September 2009.
The second modification program retrofitted 500 aircraft with new CFM International CFM56 (military designation: F108) high-bypass turbofan engines produced by General Electric and Safran. The CFM56 engine produces approximately of thrust, nearly a 100% increase compared to the original J57 engine. The modified tanker, designated KC-135R (modified KC-135A or E) or KC-135T (modified KC-135Q), can offload up to 50% more fuel (on a long-duration sortie), is 25% more fuel-efficient, and costs 25% less to operate than with the previous engines. It is also significantly quieter than the KC-135A, with noise levels at takeoff reduced from 126 to 99 decibels. This 27 decibel noise reduction results in a sound pressure level of about 5% of the original level.

The KC-135R&#x27;s operational range is 60% greater than the KC-135E for comparable fuel offloads, providing a wider range of basing options.

Upgrading the remaining KC-135Es into KC-135Rs is no longer in consideration; this would have cost approximately US$3 billion, $24 million per aircraft. According to USAF data, the KC-135 fleet had a total operation and support cost in fiscal year 2001 of about $2.2 billion (~$ in ). The older E model aircraft averaged total costs of about $4.6 million per aircraft, while the R models averaged about $3.7 million per aircraft. Those costs include personnel, fuel, maintenance, modifications, and spare parts.

===Avionics upgrades===
In order to expand the KC-135&#x27;s capabilities and improve its reliability, the aircraft has undergone a number of avionics upgrades. Among these was the Pacer-CRAG program (compass, radar and GPS) which ran from 1999 to 2002 and modified all the aircraft in the inventory to eliminate the Navigator position from the flight crew. The fuel management system was also replaced. The program development was done by Rockwell Collins in Iowa and installation was performed by BAE Systems at the Mojave Airport in California. Block 40.6 allows the KC-135 to comply with global air-traffic management. The latest block upgrade to the KC-135, the Block 45 program, is online with the first 45 upgraded aircraft delivered by January 2017. Block 45 adds a new glass cockpit digital display, radio altimeter, digital autopilot, digital flight director and computer updates. The original, no longer procurable, analog instruments, including all engine gauges, were replaced. Rockwell Collins again supplied the major avionic modules, with modification done at Tinker AFB.

===Further upgrades and derivatives===
The KC-135Q variant was modified to carry JP-7 fuel necessary for the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird by separating the JP-7 from the KC-135&#x27;s own fuel supply (the body tanks carrying JP-7, and the wing tanks carrying JP-4 or JP-8). The tanker also had special fuel systems for moving the different fuels between different tanks. When the KC-135Q model received the CFM56 engines, it was redesignated the KC-135T model, which was capable of separating the main body tanks from the wing tanks where the KC-135 draws its engine fuel. The only external difference between a KC-135R and a KC-135T is the presence of a clear window on the underside of the empennage of the KC-135T where a remote controlled searchlight is mounted. It also has two ground refueling ports, located in each rear wheel well so ground crews can fuel both the body tanks and wing tanks separately.
Eight KC-135R aircraft are receiver-capable tankers, commonly referred to as KC-135R(RT). All eight aircraft were with the 22d Air Refueling Wing at McConnell AFB, Kansas, in 1994. They are primarily used for force extension and Special Operations missions, and are crewed by highly qualified receiver capable crews. If not used for the receiver mission, these aircraft can be flown just like any other KC-135R.

The Multi-point Refueling Systems (MPRS) modification adds refueling pods to the KC-135&#x27;s wings. The pods allow refueling of U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and most NATO tactical jet aircraft while keeping the tail-mounted refueling boom. The pods themselves are Flight Refueling Limited MK.32B model pods, and refuel via the probe and drogue method common to Navy/Marine Corps tactical jets, rather than the primary &quot;flying boom&quot; method used by Air Force fixed-wing aircraft. This allows the tanker to refuel two receivers at the same time, which increases throughput compared to the boom drogue adapter.

A number of KC-135A and KC-135B aircraft have been modified to EC-135, RC-135 and OC-135 configurations for use in several different roles (although these could also be considered variants of the C-135 Stratolifter family).

==Design==
The KC-135R has four turbofan engines, mounted under 35-degree swept wings, which power it to takeoffs at gross weights up to . Nearly all internal fuel can be pumped through the tanker&#x27;s flying boom, the KC-135&#x27;s primary fuel transfer method. A boom operator stationed in the rear of the aircraft controls the boom while lying prone, viewing through a window at the bottom of the tail. Both the flying boom and operator&#x27;s station are similar to those of the previous KC-97. A special shuttlecock-shaped drogue, attached to and trailing behind the flying boom, may be used to refuel aircraft fitted with probes. This apparatus is significantly more unforgiving of pilot error in the receiving aircraft than conventional trailing hose arrangements; an aircraft so fitted is also incapable of refueling by the normal flying boom method until the attachment is removed. A cargo deck above the refueling system can hold a mixed load of passengers and cargo. Depending on fuel storage configuration, the KC-135 can carry up to of cargo.

==Operational history==

===Introduction into service===
The KC-135 was initially purchased to support SAC bombers, but by the late 1960s, in the Southeast Asia theater, the KC-135 Stratotanker&#x27;s ability as a force multiplier came to the fore. Midair refueling of F-105 and F-4 fighter-bombers as well as B-52 bombers brought far-flung bombing targets within reach, and allowed fighter missions to spend hours at the front, rather than a few minutes, which was usual due to their limited fuel reserves and high fuel consumption. KC-135 crews refueled both USAF and Navy/ Marine Corps aircraft; though they would have to change to probe and drogue adapters depending upon the mission, the Navy and Marine Corps not having fitted their aircraft with flying boom receptacles since the USAF boom system was impractical for aircraft carrier operations. Crews also helped to bring in damaged aircraft which could sometimes fly while being fed by fuel to a landing site or to ditch over the water (specifically those with punctured fuel tanks). KC-135s continued their tactical support role in later conflicts such as Operation Desert Storm and current aerial strategy.

SAC had the KC-135 Stratotanker in service with Regular Air Force SAC units from 1957 through 1992 and with SAC-gained ANG and AFRES units from 1975 through 1992. Following a major USAF reorganization that resulted in the inactivation of SAC in 1992, most KC-135s were reassigned to the newly created AMC. While AMC gained the preponderance of the aerial refueling mission, a small number of KC-135s were also assigned directly to United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) and the Air Education and Training Command (AETC). All AFRC KC-135s and most of the ANG KC-135 fleet became operationally-gained by AMC, while Alaska Air National Guard and Hawaii Air National Guard KC-135s became operationally-gained by PACAF.

AMC managed 396 Stratotankers, of which the AFRC and ANG flew 243 in support of AMC&#x27;s mission as of May 2018. The KC-135 is one of a few military aircraft types with over 50 years of continuous service with its original operator as of 2009.

Israel was offered KC-135s again in 2013, after turning down the aging aircraft twice due to expense of keeping them flying. The IAF again rejected the offered KC-135Es, but said that it would consider up to a dozen of the newer KC-135Rs.

===Research usage===
Besides its primary role as an inflight aircraft refueler, the KC-135, designated NKC-135, has assisted in several research projects at the NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base, California. One such project occurred between 1979 and 1980 when special wingtip &quot;winglets&quot;, developed by Richard Whitcomb of the Langley Research Center, were tested at Armstrong, using an NKC-135A tanker loaned to NASA by the Air Force. Winglets are small, nearly vertical fins installed on an aircraft&#x27;s wing tips. The results of the research showed that drag was reduced and range could be increased by as much as 7 percent at cruise speeds. Winglets are now being incorporated into most new commercial and military transport/passenger jets, as well as business aviation jets.

NASA also has operated several KC-135 aircraft (without the tanker equipment installed) as their famed Vomit Comet zero-gravity simulator aircraft. The longest-serving (1973 to 1995) version was KC-135A, AF Ser. No. &quot;59-1481&quot;, named &quot;Weightless Wonder IV&quot; and registered as N930NA.

===Replacements===

Between 1993 and 2003, the amount of KC-135 depot maintenance work doubled, and the overhaul cost per aircraft tripled. In 1996, it cost $8,400 per flight hour for the KC-135, and in 2002 this had grown to $11,000. The Air Force&#x27;s 15-year estimates project further significant cost growth through fiscal year 2017. KC-135 fleet operations and support costs were estimated to grow from about $2.2 billion in fiscal year 2003 to $5.1 billion (2003 dollars) in fiscal year 2017, an increase of over 130 percent, which represented an annual operating cost growth rate of about 6.2 percent.

The USAF projected that E and R models have lifetime flying hour limits of 36,000 and 39,000 hours, respectively. According to the Air Force, only a few KC-135s would reach these limits by 2040, when some aircraft would be about 80 years old. A later 2005 Air Force study estimated that KC-135Es upgraded to the R standard could remain in use until 2030.

In 2006, the KC-135E fleet was flying an annual average of 350 hours per aircraft and the KC-135R fleet was flying an annual average of 710 hours per aircraft. The KC-135 fleet is currently flying double its planned yearly flying hour program to meet airborne refueling requirements, and has resulted in higher than forecast usage and sustainment costs. In March 2009, the Air Force indicated that KC-135s would require additional skin replacement to allow their continued use beyond 2018.
The USAF decided to replace the KC-135 fleet. However, the fleet is large and will need to be replaced gradually. Initially the first batch of replacement planes was to be an air tanker version of the Boeing 767, leased from Boeing. In 2003, this was changed to contract where the Air Force would purchase 80 KC-767 aircraft and lease 20 more. In December 2003, the Pentagon froze the contract and in January 2006, the KC-767 contract was canceled. This move followed public revelations of corruption in how the contract was awarded, as well as controversy regarding the original leasing rather than outright purchase agreement. The then Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld stated that that move would in no way impair the Air Force&#x27;s ability to deliver the mission of the KC-767, which would be accomplished by implementing continuing upgrades to the KC-135 and KC-10 Extender fleet.

In January 2007, the U.S. Air Force launched the KC-X program with a request for proposal (RFP). KC-X was the first phase of three acquisition programs meant to replace the KC-135 fleet. On 29 February 2008, the US Defense Department announced that it had selected the EADS/Northrop Grumman &quot;KC-30&quot; (to be designated the KC-45A) over the Boeing KC-767. Boeing protested the award on 11 March 2008, citing irregularities in the competition and bid evaluation. On 18 June 2008, the US Government Accountability Office sustained Boeing&#x27;s protest of the selection of the Northrop Grumman/EADS&#x27;s tanker. In February 2010, the US Air Force restarted the KC-X competition with the release of a revised request for proposal (RFP). After evaluating bids, the USAF selected Boeing&#x27;s 767-based tanker design, with the military designation KC-46, as a replacement in February 2011. The first KC-46A Pegasus was delivered to the U.S. Air Force on 10 January 2019.

Two export users of the KC-135, the French Air and Space Force and the Republic of Singapore Air Force took deliveries of Airbus A330 MRTTs as replacements for their Stratotankers.

==Accidents==
As of 2020, 52 Stratotankers have been lost to accidents during the over sixty years of service, involving 385 fatalities.

;27 June 1958: USAF KC-135A, serial number &quot;56-3599&quot;, stalled and crashed at Westover Air Force Base after the crew failed to extend the flaps on takeoff, killing all 15 on board. The aircraft was attempting a world speed record between New York and London.
;31 March 1959: USAF KC-135A, &quot;58-0002&quot;, entered a thunderstorm near Killeen, Texas. Two engines separated and one of the engines struck the tail, causing loss of control. The aircraft crashed on a hillside, killing all four crew on board. The aircraft had been delivered just six weeks before the accident.
;15 October 1959: USAF KC-135A, &quot;57-1513&quot;, collided in mid-air with B-52F &quot;57-0036&quot; at over Leitchfield, Kentucky, killing all six on board both aircraft.
;3 February 1960: USAF KC-135A, &quot;56-3628&quot;, crashed on takeoff in extremely gusty crosswind conditions at Roswell-Walker AFB, New Mexico. The airplane skidded into two other KC-135 tankers (57-1449 and 57–1457) and a hangar and burst into flames. The aircraft was on a training flight, but the instructor pilot was occupying the jump seat instead of one of the pilot seats as directed by the local commander. The destruction of three aircraft, along with the death of all six in the crew plus an additional two deaths on the ground made this a unique mishap.
;18 November 1960: USAF KC-135A, &quot;56-3605&quot;, crashed on landing at Loring Air Force Base due to an excessive sink rate, killing one of 17 on board.
;9 May 1962: USAF KC-135A, &quot;56-3618&quot;, crashed on takeoff from Loring Air Force Base due to engine failure, killing all six on board.
;8 August 1962: USAF KC-135A, &quot;55-3144&quot;, crashed on approach to Runway 11 at Hanscom Field in Bedford, Massachusetts, killing all three on board. Stock footage of this same aircraft had been used during the opening credits of the film &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;.
;10 September 1962: USAF KC-135A, &quot;60-0352&quot; on a flight from Ellsworth Air Force Base to Fairchild Air Force Base crashed into a mountain just 20 miles (32 km) northeast of Spokane, Washington. The flight hit fog on approach to the air base and hit Mount Kit Carson, a mountain. The crash killed all four crew and 40 passengers on board.
;27 February 1963: USAF KC-135A, &quot;56-3597&quot;, crashed on takeoff at Eielson Air Force Base due to engine separation, killing all seven on board; two on the ground died when debris from the crash struck a guard house and nearby waiting room.
;21 June 1963: USAF KC-135A-BN Stratotanker, &quot;57-1498&quot; out of Westover AFB crashed on approach during a training flight in a wooded area near Belchertown, Massachusetts. One of the four occupants was killed.

;17 January 1966: A fatal collision occurred between a B-52G, &quot;58-0256&quot;, and a KC-135A, &quot;61-0273&quot;, flying out of Moron AB, Spain while flying over Palomares, Spain. The B-52G was on an Operation Chrome Dome mission, which required multiple air refuelings. The mishap caused both aircraft to break up in mid-air and killed all four crew members on the KC-135A and three of the seven on the B-52G, while causing radiological contamination, as nuclear weapons had to be recovered from on land and at sea, nearby.
;19 May 1966: USAF KC-135A, &quot;57-1444&quot;, of 4252nd Strategic Wing, crashed on takeoff from Kadena Air Base, killing all 11 on board as well as a motorist on nearby Highway 16. The aircraft was bound for Yokota Air Base to repair a KC-135 when it lifted off too soon during a heavy-weight takeoff.
;19 January 1967: USAF KC-135A, &quot;56-3613&quot;, crashed into Shadow Mountain, foothill of Mount Spokane (elevation MSL) while descending towards Fairchild Air Force Base, killing all nine on board.
;17 January 1968: USAF KC-135A, &quot;58-0026&quot;, stalled and crashed at Minot Air Force Base after the pilot overrotated the aircraft during takeoff in a snowstorm, killing all 13 on board including the 15th Air Force Vice Commander MGen Charles Eisenhart. This accident was instrumental in the decision to refit the KC-135 fleet with the Collins FD-109(V) integrated flight director system, in place of the earlier &quot;round dial&quot; cockpit layout.
;30 July 1968: USAF KC-135A, &quot;56-3655&quot;, crashed on Mount Lassen after the vertical stabilizer broke off after a sharp turn while practicing an emergency descent, killing all nine on board.
;24 September 1968: USAF KC-135A, &quot;55-3133&quot;, crashed on landing at Wake Island, Micronesia.

There were 11 fatalities out 56 persons on board.
;1 October 1968: USAF KC-135A, &quot;55-3138&quot;, struck concrete and steel light poles on takeoff and crashed at U-Tapao Airport, Thailand after a loss of power in an engine and resultant loss of control, killing all four on board.
;22 October 1968: USAF KC-135A, &quot;61-0301&quot;, flew into a mountain while descending to Ching Chuan Kang Air Base, Taiwan, killing all six on board.
;19 December 1969: USAF KC-135A, &quot;56-3629&quot;, crashed into the sea on climbout from Ching Chuan Kang Air Base due to low-level windshear, killing all four on board.
;3 June 1971: USAF KC-135Q, &quot;58-0039&quot;, exploded in mid-air and crashed at Centenera, Spain, killing all five on board.
;13 March 1972: KC-135A, &quot;58-0048&quot;, crashed while landing at Carswell AFB. Its right wing struck the ground, which led to the airplane exploding and killing all 5 on board.
;8 March 1973: USAF KC-135A, &quot;63-7989&quot;, collided with KC-135 &quot;63-7980&quot; on the ramp at Lockbourne Air Force Base and caught fire, killing two of five on board.
;7 December 1975: USAF KC-135A, &quot;60-0354&quot;, from Plattsburgh AFB, New York, crashed after takeoff at Eielson AFB, Alaska, killing all four crewmembers. Launch was delayed because of problems with the receiver aircraft. The KC-135 was required to sit at the end of the runway in extremely cold weather, without heat, with engines shut down. Repeated requests for a mobile heat source were denied by the command post. Landing gear failed to retract after takeoff. Crewmembers may have suffered from hypothermia.
;6 February 1976: USAF KC-135A, &quot;60-0368&quot;, flew into a mountain while descending to Torrejon Air Base, Spain, killing all seven on board. The aircraft was assigned to the 410th BMW/46th AREFS at K.I. Sawyer AFB, Michigan, but, as is often the case on Tanker Task Force deployed operations, the flight crew was from another SAC unit at Seymour-Johnson AFB, North Carolina. Only two aircraft crew chiefs on board were from K I Sawyer AFB, Michigan.
;26 September 1976: USAF KC-135A, &quot;61-0296&quot;, crashed while on approach to Wurtsmith Air Force Base, Michigan, killing 15 passengers and flight crew on board. The aircraft was flying a &quot;First Team&quot; mission taking 10 passengers to HQ-Strategic Air Command for briefings and orientation. The crew became distracted by a cabin pressurization problem after an intermediate stop and descended into a wooded area about southwest of Alpena, Michigan. There was one survivor, reportedly a crew chief who was in the boom operator aft station (boom pod) at the time of the crash.
;29 April 1977: USAF KC-135A, &quot;58-0101&quot; from Castle AFB hit five or six cows while practicing night takeoffs and landings at Beale AFB. Takeoff was aborted and the plane overran the runway and caught on fire. Of the crew of 7, there were no fatalities. During that time cattle strayed through a broken fence from a nearby field and onto the runway.
;19 September 1979: USAF KC-135A, &quot;58-0127&quot;, from Castle AFB crashed on the runway during a simulated engine failure on a training flight, killing 15 of 20 occupants on board.
;13 March 1982: Arizona ANG KC-135A, &quot;57-1489&quot; collided in mid-air with a civilian Grumman-American AA-1 Yankee near Luke AFB, Arizona. The collision, which occurred as the tanker was descending on an IFR flight plan through an undercast, was struck by the civilian aircraft operating VFR just below the cloud deck, causing the tail of the KC-135 to be severed by the force of the impact. The two civilians on the AA-1 and all four crew on the KC-135 were killed. Included among the dead was the squadron commander of the 197th AREFS, Lt Col James N. Floor.
;19 March 1982: USAF KC-135A, &quot;58-0031&quot;, exploded in mid-air at and crashed at Greenwood, Illinois, due to a possible overheated fuel pump, killing all 27 on board.
;19 March 1985: USAF 8th AF KC-135A &quot;61-0316&quot; caught fire during ground refueling at Cairo International Airport (CAI), Cairo, Egypt. The interior of the airplane was burned out and the aircraft was written off as damaged beyond repair although the wing structure was used in repairing KC-135A &quot;58-0014&quot; (which was later converted to a KC-135E). There were no injuries reported.
;28 August 1985: USAF KC-135A &quot;59-1443&quot; was damaged beyond repair when a student pilot allowed an engine to contact the runway during a landing attempt at Beale Air Force Base near Marysville, California. During the go-around the instructor lost control of the aircraft while performing checklist items for an in-flight fire. All seven (three instructors and four students) aboard the aircraft died in the crash.
;17 June 1986: USAF KC-135A,&quot;63-7983&quot;, crashed while en route to Howard AFB, Panama. It struck a hill south of the nearby Rodman Naval Station, killing all four crew members on board. The tanker and crew were based at Grissom Air Force Base, Indiana.
;13 March 1987: USAF KC-135A, &quot;60-0361&quot;, crashed at Fairchild Air Force Base after encountering wake turbulence from a B-52, while practicing a low-level refueling display. The aircraft rolled 80 degrees to the left, which stalled both left side engines (#1 and #2). The crew was able to recover to wings level, but were too low and impacted the ground in an open area of the base. The accident killed all six on board and one person on the ground.
;11 October 1988: USAF KC-135A, &quot;60-0317&quot;, crashed at Wurtsmith Force Base after a hard landing following a steep approach during crosswinds. The airplane went off the side of the runway and broke up. A fire erupted and killed all six crewmembers on board, while 10 passengers were able to jump to safety. Pilot error was determined as the cause of the accident.
;20 November 1988: USAF KC-135 suffered a failure of a sighting window next to the sextant port in the cockpit during a trans-Atlantic flight. A boom operator died when he was sucked partway through the 10-inch by 8-inch window opening as the cockpit depressurized. None of the 17 others on board were injured.
;31 January 1989: USAF KC-135A, &quot;63-7990&quot;, crashed on takeoff from Dyess AFB, Texas after the water-injection system for the Pratt &amp; Whitney J-57 engines failed and the remaining &quot;dry&quot; thrust was insufficient for flight at the takeoff gross weight. The mission was scheduled as a non-stop flight to Hickam AFB/Honolulu Hawaii with an en route F-16 air refueling mission. 7 crew members and 12 passengers, including military spouses, retired military members and one child, were killed. The aircraft and crew were based at K I Sawyer AFB, Michigan.
;20 September 1989: USAF KC-135E, &quot;57-1481&quot;, exploded on the ground at Eielson Air Force Base due to an overheated fuel pump, killing two of seven on board. The crew was shutting down the engines when the explosion occurred.
;4 October 1989: KC-135A, &quot;56-3592&quot;, from en route from Loring Air Force Base crashed into a hill along the west side of Trans-Canada Highway 2 at Carlingford, New Brunswick due to an overheated fuel pump, killing all four crew members. After five accidents involving fuel pump overheating, crews were to keep of fuel in the tank.
;11 January 1990: KC-135E, &quot;59-1494&quot;, caught fire on the tarmac at Pease Air National Guard Base during maintenance work; there were no injuries, however the aircraft was destroyed.
;6 February 1991: KC-135E, &quot;58-0013&quot;, suffered an accident after entering severe wake turbulence from a passing KC-135. The aircraft lost both engines from under the left wing, but the crew was able to recover and land successfully. The aircraft was repaired and later returned to service. The entire crew received the Distinguished Flying Cross for their actions.
;10 December 1993: a Wisconsin Air National Guard KC-135R, &quot;57-1470&quot;, exploded while undergoing routine ground maintenance at General Mitchell Air National Guard Base due to an overheated fuel pump. Six NCO maintenance personnel were killed.
;13 January 1999: Washington Air National Guard KC-135E, &quot;59-1452&quot;, crashed on approach in Geilenkirchen, Germany due to the horizontal stabilizer being in a 7.5 nose-up trim condition, killing all 4 crew members.
;7 April 1999: Air National Guard KC-135R, &quot;57-1418&quot;, was damaged beyond repair while undergoing a cabin pressurization check while in depot maintenance at the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma. During a previous maintenance event, the pressure relief valves were secured shut and not released afterwards. This created a catastrophic explosion that nearly separated the empennage from the aircraft and destroyed the aft fuselage section. No personnel were injured or killed during the mishap, but the aircraft was a total loss.
;26 September 2006: USAF KC-135R, &quot;63-8886&quot;, was damaged beyond economical repair when it was struck by a Tupolev Tu-154 of Altyn Air, &quot;EX-85718&quot;, while stopped on a taxiway after landing at Manas Air Base. As the Tu-154 took off, its right wing struck the fairing of the KC-135R&#x27;s No. 1 engine. The force of the impact nearly severed the No. 1 engine and destroyed a portion of the left wing. The resulting fire caused extensive damage to the KC-135. The Tu-154 lost about of its right wingtip, but was able to get airborne and return to the airport for an emergency landing. The tanker crew had been directed to use a taxiway which was not usable for night operations and the controller failed to note that they reported &quot;holding short&quot; of that taxiway, rather than &quot;clear of&quot; that point. The crew of the KC-135 evacuated the aircraft without serious injuries.
;3 May 2013: USAF KC-135R, &quot;63-8877&quot;, broke up in flight about eight minutes after taking off from Manas Air base in Kyrgyzstan, killing all three crew members. After investigation, it was determined that a rudder power control unit malfunction led to a Dutch roll oscillatory instability. Not recognizing the Dutch roll, the crew used the rudder to stay on course, which exacerbated the instability, leading to an unrecoverable flight condition. The over-stressed tail section detached and the aircraft broke apart soon after. The aircraft was at cruise altitude about 200 km west of Bishkek before it crashed in a mountainous area near the village of Chorgolu, close to the border between Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.

<doc id="17442" wikidata="Q378710" url="?curid=17442" title="Katsuhiro Otomo">
<text>is a Japanese manga artist, screenwriter, animator, and film director. He first rose to prominence as a pioneer founder of the New Wave in the 1970s. He is best known as the creator of &quot;Akira&quot;, both the original 1982 manga series and the 1988 animated film adaptation. In 2005, Otomo was decorated a &quot;Chevalier&quot; of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, promoted to &quot;Officier&quot; of the order in 2014, and became the fourth manga artist ever inducted into the American Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 2012. Celebrated in Japan, he was also awarded the Purple Medal of Honor from the national government in 2013. 

In addition, Otomo later received the Winsor McCay Award at the 41st Annie Awards in 2014 and the 2015 Grand Prix de la ville d&#x27;Angoulême, the first manga artist to receive the award.

==Early life==
Katsuhiro Otomo was born in Tome, Miyagi Prefecture and grew up in Tome District. He said that living in the very rural Tōhoku region left him with nothing to do as a child, so he read a lot of manga. As the only boy in a family with older and younger sisters, he enjoyed reading and drawing manga on his own and thought about becoming a manga artist. Limited by his parents to buying one manga book a month, Otomo typically chose Kobunsha&#x27;s &quot;Shōnen&quot; magazine, which included &quot;Astro Boy&quot; by Osamu Tezuka and &quot;Tetsujin 28-go&quot; by Mitsuteru Yokoyama, series which he would copy drawing in elementary school. However, he said it was after reading Shotaro Ishinomori&#x27;s &quot;How to Draw Manga&quot; that he understood how to draw manga properly and started doing so more seriously.

In high school, Otomo developed an interest in movies, that led to his ambition to become an illustrator or film director. At this time, one of his friends introduced him to an editor at Futabasha, who, after seeing Otomo&#x27;s manga, told the high school student to contact him if he moved to Tokyo after graduating. Otomo did exactly that, and began his career in Tokyo as a 19-year old professional manga artist.

==Career==
===Manga===
On October 4, 1973, Otomo published his first work, a manga adaptation of Prosper Mérimée&#x27;s short story &quot;Mateo Falcone&quot;, titled &quot;A Gun Report&quot;.

In 1979, after writing multiple short-stories for the magazine &quot;Weekly Manga Action&quot;, Otomo created his first science-fiction work, titled &quot;Fireball&quot;. Although the manga was never completed, it is regarded as a milestone in Otomo&#x27;s career as it contained many of the same themes he would explore in his later, more successful manga such as &quot;&quot;. &quot;Dōmu&quot; began serialization in January 1980 and ran until July 1981. It was not published in book form until 1983, when it won the Nihon SF Taisho Award. It also won the 1984 Seiun Award for Best Comic.

In a collaboration with writer Toshihiko Yahagi, Otomo illustrated &quot;Kibun wa mō Sensō&quot; about a fictional war that erupts in the border between China and the Soviet Union. It was published in &quot;Weekly Manga Action&quot; from 1980 to 1981 and collected into one volume in 1982. It won the 1982 Seiun Award for Best Comic. 38 years later, the two created the one-shot sequel &quot;Kibun wa mō Sensō 3 (Datta Kamo Shirenai)&quot; for the April 16, 2019 issue of the magazine.

Also in 1981, Otomo drew &quot;A Farewell to Weapons&quot; for the November 16 issue of Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Young Magazine&quot;. It was later included in the 1990 short story collection &quot;Kanojo no Omoide...&quot;
In 1982, Otomo began what would become his most acclaimed and famous work: &quot;Akira&quot;. Kodansha had been asking him to write a series for their new &quot;Young Magazine&quot; for some time, but he had been busy with other work. From the first meeting with the publisher, &quot;Akira&quot; was to be only about ten chapters &quot;or something like that,&quot; so Otomo said he was really not expecting it to be a success. It was serialized for eight years and 2000 pages of artwork.

In 1990, Otomo did a brief interview with MTV for a general segment on the Japanese manga scene at the time. Otomo created the one-shot &quot;Hi no Yōjin&quot; about people who put out fires in Japan&#x27;s Edo period for the debut issue of &quot;Comic Cue&quot; in January 1995.

Otomo wrote the 2002 picture book &quot;&quot;, which was illustrated by Shinji Kimura.

Otomo created the full-color work &quot;DJ Teck no Morning Attack&quot; for the April 2012 issue of &quot;Geijutsu Shincho&quot;.

Following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Otomo, a native of the Tōhoku region, designed a relief that features a boy riding a robot goldfish in rough seas, while flanked by Fūjin and Raijin. Intended to capture the region&#x27;s will to overcome the natural disaster, it has been located on the first floor of the terminal building at Sendai Airport since March 2015.

Otomo was initially reported in 2012 to be working on his first long-form manga since &quot;Akira&quot;. Planning to draw the work that is set during Japan&#x27;s Meiji period without assistants, he was initially targeting a younger audience, but said the story had developed more towards an older one. Although planned to begin in fall 2012, Otomo revealed in November of that year that the series had been delayed. By 2018, Otomo said he was doing a full-length work, but the contents were still secrets. In 2022, Kodansha released Otomo&#x27;s entire body of manga since 1971 as part of &quot;The Complete Works Project,&quot; which featured six separate releases of two books each. It was noted that some of his manga were edited when initially compiled into book format, and this new project, personally overseen by Otomo, restored them to how they appeared in their original serialization.

===Film===
At the age of 25, Otomo spent about 5 million yen to make a 16 mm live-action film about an hour long. He said that making this private film showed him roughly how to make and direct movies. In 1982, Otomo made his anime debut, working as character designer for the animated film &quot;Harmagedon: Genma Wars&quot;. It was while working on this film that Otomo began to think he could do it by himself.

In 1987, Otomo directed an animated work for the first time: a segment, which he also wrote the screenplay and drew animation for, in the anthology feature &quot;Neo Tokyo&quot;. He followed this up with two segments in another anthology released that year, &quot;Robot Carnival&quot;. In 1988, he directed the animated film adaptation of his manga &quot;Akira&quot;.

Otomo was executive producer of 1995&#x27;s &quot;Memories&quot;, an anthology film based on three of his stories. Additionally, he wrote the script for &quot;Stink Bomb&quot; and &quot;Cannon Fodder&quot;, the latter of which he also directed.

Otomo has worked extensively with the studio Sunrise. In 1998, he directed the CG short &quot;Gundam: Mission to the Rise&quot; to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise. The studio has animated and produced his 2004 feature film &quot;Steamboy&quot;, 2006&#x27;s &quot;Freedom Project&quot;, and 2007&#x27;s &quot;SOS! Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next&quot;. The last, is based on Otomo&#x27;s 1980 manga &quot;SOS! Tokyo Metro Explorer&quot; and follows the son of its main characters.

The 2001 animated film &quot;Metropolis&quot; features a script written by Otomo that adapts Tezuka&#x27;s manga of the same name.

Otomo directed the 2006 live-action film &quot;Mushishi&quot;, based on Yuki Urushibara&#x27;s manga of the same name.

In 2013, Otomo took part in &quot;Short Peace&quot;, an anthology consisting on 4 short films; he directed &quot;Combustible&quot;, a tragic love story set in the Edo period based on his 1995 manga &quot;Hi no Yōjin&quot;, while Hajime Katoki directed &quot;A Farewell to Weapons&quot;, depicting a battle in a ruined Tokyo based on Otomo&#x27;s 1981 manga of the same name. &quot;Combustible&quot; won the Grand Prize in the Animation category of the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2012, and was even shortlisted for the 2013 Best Animated Short at the 85th Academy Awards.

Otomo directed the music video for Aya Nakano&#x27;s 2016 song &quot;Juku-Hatachi&quot;. He is a fan of the singer and previously drew the cover to her 2014 album &quot;Warui Kuse&quot;.

Reports have suggested that Otomo will be the executive producer of the live-action film adaptation of &quot;Akira&quot;. In 2019, he announced that he is writing and directing an animated film adaptation of his 2001 manga &quot;Orbital Era&quot; with Sunrise and released a trailer that same year.

==Style==
Otomo said that when he started his professional career in the late 1970s, &quot;almost all manga was gekiga like &quot;Golgo 13&quot;. So it was all gekiga or sports manga, nothing to do with science fiction.&quot; Remembering how much he loved science fiction as a child, Otomo wanted to recreate that kind of excitement; &quot;That was in part how something like &quot;Domu&quot; came about. [...] There was no hard science fiction manga [...] so I wanted to change that and do something more realistic and believable.&quot;

Describing his characterization style, Otomo said he first tried to draw and imitate &quot;very traditional manga-like art,&quot; such as &quot;Astro Boy&quot;. But by the time he was in high school, illustration work by people like Tadanori Yokoo and Yoshitaro Isaka was popular, so he wanted to create manga characters with this illustrative art style. When asked about how Japanese critics praise him as the first manga artist to draw realistic Japanese faces, Otomo said he always tries to balance fantasy and realism; &quot;Depicting things too realistically actually damages the social realism of the piece, and if you go too far into the realm of fantasy, that hurts its imaginative ability.&quot; However, he said the realism of his early works probably came from having used friends as character models. French cartoonist Moebius, who is known for realistic character designs, is often cited as one of Otomo&#x27;s biggest influences. Otomo is considered to be one of the artists of the New Wave in manga in the late 1970s and 1980s especially due to his visual innovation.

Otomo includes homages to his favorite childhood manga in his work, and there were three manga authors that he really respected at that time; Osamu Tezuka, Shotaro Ishinomori and Mitsuteru Yokoyama. He named the main computer in &quot;Fireball&quot; ATOM after Tezuka&#x27;s character of the same name, the character nicknamed Ecchan in &quot;Domu&quot; is a reference to Ishinomori&#x27;s &quot;Sarutobi Ecchan&quot;, and the title character of &quot;Akira&quot; is also known as No. 28 in homage to Yokoyama&#x27;s &quot;Tetsujin 28-go&quot; in addition to the two series having the &quot;same overall plot.&quot; Ever since depicting the apartment complex in &quot;Domu&quot;, Otomo has had a large interest in architecture, proclaiming, &quot;I don&#x27;t think there was anyone before me who put this much effort into their depictions of buildings.&quot; He believes this habit of drawing detailed backgrounds was influenced by Shigeru Mizuki&#x27;s manga, which showed him how important backdrops are to a story. Otomo strongly praised the framing done by Tetsuya Chiba, whose work he studied a lot out of admiration at a store in Kichijoji, for making it easy to grasp how tangible the backgrounds and characters are. It was taken from Chiba’s &quot;Notari Matsutaro, &quot; a seinen sports manga that mainly inspired Otomo to develop his &quot;grammar&quot; for making manga, including &quot; Domu.&quot;

When asked about his influences in designing the mecha in &quot;Farewell to Weapons&quot;, Otomo pointed out that Studio Nue&#x27;s work was popular at the time, specifically mentioning the powered suit designs by Kazutaka Miyatake and Naoyuki Kato. He also stated that he is a fan of mecha by Takashi Watabe and Makoto Kobayashi and is fond of those seen in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, but explained that all his influences are jumbled and mixed together; &quot;In short, I digest many different things and ideas tend to pop out from that.&quot;

==Legacy==

It was around the 1979 publication of his &quot;Short Peace&quot; short story collection that Otomo&#x27;s work became influential in Japan. Artists influenced by him and his work include Hisashi Eguchi, Naoki Urasawa, Naoki Yamamoto, Makoto Aida and Hiroya Oku. When talking in 1997 about the future of manga, Urasawa opined that [Osamu] Tezuka created the form that exists today, then caricatures appeared next, and comics changed again when Katsuhiro Otomo came on the scene. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any room left for further changes. 

Masashi Kishimoto cited Otomo as one of his two biggest influences, but liked Otomo&#x27;s art style the best and imitated it while trying to develop his own. The Dragon Ball manga creator Akira Toriyama was interviewed on who was his favorite manga artist, and said that he found his peer Otomo to be “incredible.”

Otomo&#x27;s manga work also notably influenced a number of Japanese video game designers by the mid-1980s, including Enix&#x27;s Yuji Horii (&quot;The Portopia Serial Murder Case&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;), Capcom&#x27;s Noritaka Funamizu (&quot;Gun.Smoke&quot; and &quot;Hyper Dyne Side Arms&quot;), UPL&#x27;s Tsutomu Fujisawa (&quot;Ninja-Kid&quot;), Thinking Rabbit&#x27;s Hiroyuki Imabayashi (&quot;Sokoban&quot;), dB-SOFT&#x27;s Naoto Shinada (&quot;Volguard&quot;), Hot-B&#x27;s Jun Kuriyama (&quot;Psychic City&quot;), and Microcabin&#x27;s Masashi Katou (&quot;Eiyuu Densetsu Saga&quot;).

Director Satoshi Kon, who worked as an assistant to Otomo in both manga and film, cited &quot;Akira&quot; and especially &quot;Domu&quot; as influences. American film director Rian Johnson is a big fan of Otomo and pointed out similarities between how telekinesis is depicted in &quot;Domu&quot; and its depiction in his film &quot;Looper&quot;.

In 2017, the book &quot;Otomo: A Global Tribute to the Mind Behind Akira&quot; was published in Japan, France and the United States, featuring writing and artwork from 80 artists such as Masakazu Katsura, Taiyo Matsumoto, Masamune Shirow, Asaf and Tomer Hanuka, and Stan Sakai. From April 8 to May 8, 2021, comic art collector Phillipe Labaune&#x27;s self-titled art gallery in New York City held &quot;Good For Health, Bad For Education: A Tribute to Otomo&quot; as its first exhibition. Including pieces originally curated by Julien Brugeas for the 2016 Angoulême International Comics Festival, it featured a total of 29 Otomo-inspired works by international artists such as Sara Pichelli, Paul Pope, Boulet, François Boucq, Giannis Milonogiannis and Ian Bertram.

==Personal life==
Otomo is married to Yoko Otomo. Together they have one child, a son named Shohei Otomo, who is also an artist.

<doc id="17443" wikidata="Q636" url="?curid=17443" title="Kate Bush">
<text>Catherine Bush (born 30 July 1958) is an English singer, songwriter, record producer and dancer. Bush began writing songs at age 11. She was signed to EMI Records after David Gilmour of Pink Floyd helped produce a demo tape. In 1978, at the age of 19, she topped the UK singles chart for four weeks with her debut single &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, becoming the first female artist to achieve a UK number one with a fully self-written song. Her debut studio album, &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; (1978), peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart. 

Bush has released 25 UK Top 40 singles, including the Top 10 hits &quot;The Man with the Child in His Eyes&quot; (1978), &quot;Babooshka&quot; (1980), &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; (1985), &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot; (a 1986 duet with Peter Gabriel), and &quot;King of the Mountain&quot; (2005). All nine of her studio albums reached the UK Top 10, with all but one reaching the top five, including the number one albums &quot;Never for Ever&quot; (1980), &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; (1985) and the greatest hits compilation &quot;The Whole Story&quot; (1986). Since &quot;The Dreaming&quot; (1982), she has produced all of her studio albums. She took a hiatus between her seventh and eighth albums, &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (1993) and &quot;Aerial&quot; (2005). In 2011, Bush released the albums &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; and &quot;50 Words for Snow&quot;. She drew attention again in 2014 with her concert residency Before the Dawn, her first shows since the Tour of Life in 1979.

Bush was the first British solo female artist to top the UK Albums Chart and the first female artist to enter it at number one. Her eclectic musical style, unconventional lyrics, performances and literary themes have influenced a diverse range of artists. In 2022, &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; received renewed attention after it appeared in the Netflix series &quot;Stranger Things&quot;, becoming Bush&#x27;s second UK number one and reaching the top of several other charts. It reached number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and its parent album, &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;, became Bush&#x27;s first album to reach the top of a &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart.

Bush has received numerous accolades and honours, including 14 Brit Awards nominations and a win for British Female Solo Artist in 1987, as well as seven nominations for Grammy Awards. In 2002, she received the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. She was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to music. She became a Fellow of the Ivors Academy in the UK in 2020, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2023.

== Life and career ==
===1958–1972: Early life===
Bush was born on 30 July 1958 at a maternity hospital in Bexleyheath, Kent, to an English doctor, general practitioner Robert Bush (1920–2008), and Hannah Patricia (née Daly) (1918–1992), an Irish staff nurse, daughter of a farmer in County Waterford. She grew up with her elder brothers, John and Paddy, in a 350-year-old former farmhouse at East Wickham near Welling, which neighbours Bexleyheath. Bush came from an artistic background: her mother was an amateur traditional Irish dancer, her father was an amateur pianist, Paddy worked as a musical instrument maker, and John was a poet and photographer. Both brothers were involved in the local folk music scene. She was raised as a Roman Catholic.

Bush trained at Goldsmiths College karate club where her brother John was a karate instructor. There she became known as &quot;Ee-ee&quot; because of her squeaky &quot;kiai&quot;.

Her family&#x27;s musical influence inspired Bush to teach herself the piano at the age of 11. She also played the organ in a barn behind her parents&#x27; house and studied the violin. She soon began composing songs, eventually adding her own lyrics.

===1973–1977: Career beginnings===
Bush attended St Joseph&#x27;s Convent Grammar School, a Catholic girls&#x27; school in nearby Abbey Wood. During this time, her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions, which was turned down by record labels. The Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. (The 1973 song &quot;Passing Through Air&quot; was recorded as a demo at Gilmour‘s studio a few weeks after her 15th birthday and would later be the earliest Kate Bush recording to be released officially.) Impressed, Gilmour financed the 16-year-old Bush&#x27;s recording of a more professional demo tape. The tape consisted of three tracks, produced by Gilmour&#x27;s friend Andrew Powell and the sound engineer Geoff Emerick, who had worked with the Beatles. Powell later produced Bush&#x27;s first two albums. The tape was sent to the EMI executive Terry Slater, who signed Bush.
The British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation. Progressive rock was popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, thus record labels looking for the next big thing were considering experimental acts. Bush was put on retainer for two years by Bob Mercer, managing director of EMI&#x27;s group-repertoire division. Mercer believed that Bush&#x27;s material was good enough to release, but he also believed that should the album fail it would be demoralising and if it were successful Bush was too young to handle this. In a 1987 interview, Gilmour disputed this version of events, blaming EMI for initially using the &quot;wrong&quot; producers.

EMI gave Bush a large advance, which she used to enroll in interpretive dance classes taught by Lindsay Kemp, a former teacher of David Bowie, and mime training with Adam Darius. For the first two years of her contract, Bush spent more time on schoolwork than recording. She left school after doing her mock A-Levels and having gained ten GCE O-Level qualifications.

Bush wrote and recorded demos of almost 200 songs, some of which circulated as bootlegs. From March to August 1977, she fronted the KT Bush Band at public houses in London. The band included Del Palmer (bass), Brian Bath (guitar), and Vic King (drums). She began recording her first album in August 1977.

===1978–1979: &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; and &quot;Lionheart&quot;===

For her debut album, &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; (1978), Bush was persuaded to use established session musicians instead of the KT Bush Band. She retained some of these even after she had brought her bandmates back on board. Her brother Paddy played the harmonica and mandolin. Stuart Elliott played some of the drums and became her main drummer on subsequent albums. &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; was released when Bush was 19, with some songs written when she was as young as 13. EMI originally wanted the more rock-oriented track &quot;James and the Cold Gun&quot; to be her debut single, but Bush, who already had a reputation for asserting herself in decisions about her work, insisted that it should be &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. Two music videos with similar choreography were created by Bush to accompany the song. The studio version sees her perform in a dark room with mist while wearing a white dress, suggesting her character is a ghost (as is the case with Cathy in the novel that inspired the song). The outside version sees Bush dancing in a grassy area on Salisbury Plain (inspired by the novel&#x27;s moors) while wearing a red dress.

In the United Kingdom alone, &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; sold over a million copies. &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; topped the UK and Australian charts and became an international hit. Bush became the first British woman to reach number one on the UK charts with a self-written song. &quot;The Man with the Child in His Eyes&quot; made it onto the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 where it reached number 85 in early 1979, and went on to win her an Ivor Novello Award in 1979 for Outstanding British Lyric. According to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, Bush was the first female artist in pop history to have written every track on a million-selling debut album.
Bob Mercer blamed Bush&#x27;s lesser success in the United States on American radio formats, saying there were no outlets for Bush&#x27;s visual presentation. EMI capitalised on Bush&#x27;s appearance by promoting the album with a poster of her in a tight pink top which emphasised her breasts. In an interview with &quot;NME&quot; in 1982, Bush criticised the choice: &quot;People weren&#x27;t even generally aware that I wrote my own songs or played the piano. The media just promoted me as a female body. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;ve had to prove that I&#x27;m an artist in a female body.&quot; In late 1978, EMI persuaded Bush to quickly record a follow-up album, &quot;Lionheart&quot;, to take advantage of the success of &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;. The album was produced by Andrew Powell, assisted by Bush. Although it gained a high number of sales and spawned the hit single &quot;Wow&quot;, it did not achieve the success of &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;, reaching number six in the UK album charts. She went on to express dissatisfaction with &quot;Lionheart&quot;, feeling that it had needed more time.

Bush set up her own publishing company, Kate Bush Music, and her own management company, Novercia, to maintain control of her work. Members of her family, along with Bush herself, composed the board of directors. Following the release of &quot;Lionheart&quot;, she was required by EMI to undertake heavy promotional work and an exhausting tour. The Tour of Life began in April 1979 and lasted six weeks. It was described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;an extraordinary, hydra-headed beast, combining music, dance, poetry, mime, burlesque, magic and theatre&quot;. The show was co-devised and performed on stage with magician Simon Drake. Bush was involved in every aspect of the production, choreography, set design, costume design and hiring. The shows were noted for her dancing, complex lighting and her 17 costume changes per show. Because of her need to dance as she sang, sound engineers used a wire coat hanger and a radio microphone to fashion a headset microphone; it was the first use by a rock performer since the Spotnicks used a rudimentary version in the early 1960s. Bush&#x27;s first experience as a producer was on her live &quot;On Stage&quot; EP, released in August 1979.

===1980–1984: &quot;Never for Ever&quot; and &quot;The Dreaming&quot;===

Released in September 1980, &quot;Never for Ever&quot; was Bush&#x27;s second foray into production, co-producing with Jon Kelly. The first two albums had resulted in a definitive sound evident in every track, with orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound. The range of styles on &quot;Never for Ever&quot; is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker &quot;Violin&quot; to the wistful waltz of hit single &quot;Army Dreamers&quot;.

&quot;Never for Ever&quot; was her first album to feature synthesisers and drum machines, in particular the Fairlight CMI. She was introduced to the technology while providing backing vocals on Peter Gabriel&#x27;s eponymous third album in early 1980. It was her first record to reach the top position in the UK album charts, also making her the first female British artist to achieve that status, and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at No. 1. The top-selling single from the album was &quot;Babooshka&quot;, which reached No. 5 in the UK singles chart. In November 1980, she released the standalone Christmas single &quot;December Will Be Magic Again&quot;, which reached No. 29 in the UK charts.
September 1982 saw the release of &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, the first album Bush produced by herself. With her new-found freedom, she experimented with production techniques, creating an album that features a diverse blend of musical styles and is known for its near-exhaustive use of the Fairlight CMI. &quot;The Dreaming&quot; received a mixed reception in the UK, and critics were baffled by the dense soundscapes Bush had created to become &quot;less accessible&quot;. In a 1993 interview with &quot;Q&quot; magazine, Bush stated: &quot;That was my &#x27;She&#x27;s gone mad&#x27; album.&quot; The album entered the UK album chart at No. 3, but is to date her lowest-selling album, garnering &quot;only&quot; a silver disc. The album became her first to enter the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, albeit only reaching No. 157. 

&quot;Sat in Your Lap&quot; was the first single from the album to be released. It preceded the album by over a year and peaked at No. 11 in the UK. The title track, featuring Rolf Harris and Percy Edwards, stalled at No. 48, while the third single, &quot;There Goes a Tenner&quot;, stalled at No. 93, despite promotion from EMI and Bush. The track &quot;Suspended in Gaffa&quot; was released as a single in Europe, but not in the UK.

Continuing in her storytelling tradition, Bush looked far outside her own personal experience for sources of inspiration. She drew on old crime films for &quot;There Goes a Tenner&quot;, a documentary about the Vietnam War for &quot;Pull Out the Pin&quot;, and the plight of Indigenous Australians for &quot;The Dreaming&quot;. &quot;Houdini&quot; is about the magician&#x27;s death, and &quot;Get Out of My House&quot; was inspired by Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;The Shining&quot;.

===1985–1988: &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; and &quot;The Whole Story&quot;===
&quot;Hounds of Love&quot; was released in 1985. Because of the high cost of hiring studio space for her previous album, she built a private studio near her home, where she could work at her own pace. &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; topped the charts in the UK, knocking Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; from the number-one position.

The album takes advantage of the vinyl and cassette formats with two very different sides. The first side, &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;, contains five &quot;accessible&quot; pop songs, including the four singles &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;, &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;, &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;, and &quot;The Big Sky&quot;. &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; reached No. 3 in the UK charts and re-introduced Bush to American listeners, climbing to No. 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in November 1985. Bush has stated that she initially wanted to name the song &quot;A Deal With God&quot;, but the record company was reluctant because some people might think it was &quot;a sensitive title&quot;, but that &quot;... for me, this is still called A Deal With God&quot;. The second side of the album, &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot;, takes its name from Tennyson&#x27;s poem, &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;, about the legendary King Arthur&#x27;s reign, and is seven interconnecting songs joined in one continuous piece of music.

The album earned Bush nominations for Best Female Solo Artist, Best Album, Best Single, and Best Producer at the 1986 Brit Awards. In the same year, Bush and Peter Gabriel had a UK Top 10 hit with the duet &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot; (Dolly Parton, Gabriel&#x27;s original choice to sing the female vocal, turned his offer down), and EMI released her &quot;greatest hits&quot; album, &quot;The Whole Story&quot;. Bush provided a new lead vocal and refreshed backing track on &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, and recorded a new single, &quot;Experiment IV&quot;, for inclusion on the compilation. Dawn French and Hugh Laurie were among those featured in the video for Experiment IV. At the 1987 Brit Awards, Bush won the award for Best British Female Solo Artist.

===1989–1993: &quot;The Sensual World&quot; and &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;===
Released in 1989, &quot;The Sensual World&quot; was described by Bush herself as &quot;her most honest, personal album&quot;. One of the tracks, &quot;Heads We&#x27;re Dancing&quot;, inspired by her own black humour, is about a woman who dances all night with a charming stranger only to discover in the morning that he is Adolf Hitler. The title track drew its inspiration from James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;. &quot;The Sensual World&quot; went on to become her biggest-selling album in the US, receiving an RIAA Gold certification four years after its release for 500,000 copies sold. In the United Kingdom album charts, it reached the number-two position. Another single from the album, &quot;This Woman&#x27;s Work&quot;, was featured in the John Hughes film &quot;She&#x27;s Having a Baby&quot;, and a slightly remixed version appeared on Bush&#x27;s album &quot;The Sensual World&quot;. The song reached number-eight in 2005 on the UK download chart after featuring in a British television advertisement for the charity NSPCC.

In 1990, the boxed set &quot;This Woman&#x27;s Work&quot; was released; it included all of her albums with their original cover art, as well as two discs featuring the majority of her singles&#x27; B-sides recorded from 1978 to 1990. In 1991, Bush released a cover of Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Rocket Man&quot;, which reached number 12 on the UK singles chart, and reached number two in Australia. In 2007, it was voted the greatest cover ever by readers of &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper. Another John cover, &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot;, was the B-side. In the same year, she starred in the black comedy film &quot;Les Dogs&quot;, produced by &quot;The Comic Strip&quot; for BBC television. Bush plays the bride Angela at a wedding set in a post-apocalyptic Britain.

Bush&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, was released in November 1993. The album gave Bush her highest chart position in the US, reaching number 28, although the only song from the album to make the US singles chart was &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot;, which peaked at number 88 in January 1994. In the UK, the album reached number-two, and the singles &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot;, &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot;, and &quot;And So Is Love&quot; (featuring Eric Clapton on guitar) all reached the top 30. Bush directed and starred in the short film &quot;The Line, the Cross and the Curve&quot;, which featured music from her album &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, itself inspired by the 1948 film of that name. It was released on VHS in the UK in 1994 and also received a small number of cinema screenings around the world.

The initial plan had been to tour with &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; release, but did not reach fruition. Thus, Bush deliberately produced her tracks live, with less studio production that had typified her last three albums and which would have been too difficult to re-create on stage. The result polarised her fan base, who had enjoyed the intricacy of her earlier compositions, with other fans claiming they had found new complexities in the lyrics and the emotions they expressed.

During this period of time, Bush suffered a series of bereavements, including the loss of guitarist Alan Murphy, who had started working with her on The Tour of Life in 1979, and her mother Hannah, to whom she was exceptionally close. The people she lost were honoured in the ballad &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot;, although Bush&#x27;s mother was still alive when &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot; was written and recorded. Bush describes playing the song to her mother, who thought the line where she is quoted by Bush as saying, &quot;Every old sock meets an old shoe&quot;, was hilarious and &quot;couldn&#x27;t stop laughing.&quot;

===1994–2006: Motherhood, hiatus, and &quot;Aerial&quot;===
After the release of &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, Bush dropped out of the public eye. She had originally intended to take one year off, but despite working on material, twelve years passed before her next album release. Her name occasionally cropped up in the media with rumours of a new album release. The press often viewed her as an eccentric recluse, sometimes drawing a comparison with Miss Havisham from Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. In 1998, Bush gave birth to Albert, known as &quot;Bertie&quot;, fathered by guitarist Dan McIntosh, whom she met in 1992. In 2001, Bush was awarded a Q Award as Classic Songwriter. In 2002, she was awarded an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, and performed &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; at David Gilmour&#x27;s concert at the Royal Festival Hall in London.

Bush&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Aerial&quot;, was released on double CD and vinyl in November 2005. The album single &quot;King of the Mountain&quot;, had received its premiere on BBC Radio 2 on 1 September 2005. The single entered the UK Downloads Chart at number six, and would become Bush&#x27;s third-highest-charting single ever in the UK, peaking at number four on the full chart. &quot;Aerial&quot; entered the UK albums chart at number three, and the US chart at number 48.

&quot;Aerial,&quot; like &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; (1985), is divided into two sections, each with its own theme and mood. The first disc, subtitled &quot;A Sea of Honey&quot;, features a set of unrelated themed songs, including &quot;King of the Mountain&quot;; &quot;Bertie&quot;, a Renaissance-style ode to her son; and &quot;Joanni&quot;, based on the story of Joan of Arc. In the song &quot;π&quot;, Bush sings 117 digits of the number pi. The second disc, subtitled &quot;A Sky of Honey&quot;, features one continuous piece of music describing the experience of 24 hours passing by. &quot;Aerial&quot; earned Bush two nominations at the 2006 Brit Awards, for Best British Female Solo Artist and Best British Album.

===2007–2013: Fish People, &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; and &quot;50 Words for Snow&quot;===
In 2007, Bush was asked to write a song for &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; soundtrack which made reference to the lead character, Lyra Belacqua. The song, &quot;Lyra&quot;, was played over the closing credits of the film. The single reached No 187 in the UK singles chart and was nominated for the International Press Academy&#x27;s Satellite Award for original song in a motion picture. According to Del Palmer, Bush was asked to compose the song at short notice; the project was completed in 10 days.

In May 2011, Bush released &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut,&quot; comprising 11 reworked tracks from &quot;The Sensual World&quot; and &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, recorded using analogue rather than digital equipment. All the tracks have new lead vocals, drums, and instrumentation. Some were transposed to a lower key to accommodate her lowering voice. Three of the songs, including &quot;This Woman&#x27;s Work&quot;, have been completely rerecorded, often with lyrics changed in places. Bush described the album as a new project rather than a collection of remixes. It was the first album on her new label, &quot;Fish People&quot;, a division of EMI Records. In addition to &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; in its single CD form, the album was released with a box-set that contains the albums &quot;The Sensual World&quot; and the analogue re-mastered &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;. It debuted at No 2 on the United Kingdom chart.

Bush&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;50 Words for Snow&quot;, was released on 21 November 2011. It features the high-profile appearance of Elton John on the duet &quot;Snowed in at Wheeler Street&quot;. The album contains seven new songs &quot;set against a backdrop of falling snow&quot;, with a total running time of 65 minutes. The album&#x27;s songs are built around Bush&#x27;s quietly jazzy piano and Steve Gadd&#x27;s drums, and use both sung and spoken word vocals in what &quot;Classic Rock&quot; critic Stephen Dalton calls &quot;a ... supple and experimental affair, with a contemporary chamber pop sound grounded in crisp piano, minimal percussion and light-touch electronics ... billowing jazz-rock soundscapes, interwoven with fragmentary narratives delivered in a range of voices from shrill to Laurie Anderson-style cooing&quot;. Bassist Danny Thompson appears on the album, while the sixth track on the album, &quot;50 Words for Snow&quot;, features the voice of Stephen Fry reciting a list of words to describe snow.

&quot;50 Words for Snow&quot; received general acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 88, based on 26 reviews, which indicates &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. At the 2012 Brit Awards she was nominated in the Best Female Artist category, and the album won the 2012 Best Album at the South Bank Arts Awards, and was also nominated for Best Album at the Ivor Novello Awards.

Bush turned down an invitation to perform at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony in London. Instead, a new vocal remix of her 1985 single &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; was played. In 2013, Bush became the only female artist to have top five albums in the UK charts in five successive decades.

===2014–2021: &quot;Before the Dawn&quot; and remastered catalogue===

In March 2014, Bush announced her first live concerts in decades: Before the Dawn, a 22-night residency in London running from 26 August to 1 October 2014 at the Hammersmith Apollo. Tickets sold out in 15 minutes. The concerts received universal acclaim. An album of recordings from the concerts, &quot;Before the Dawn&quot;, was released on 25 November 2016. Bolstered by publicity around &quot;Before the Dawn&quot;, Bush became the first female performer to have eight albums in the UK Top 40 Albums Chart simultaneously, putting her at number three for simultaneous UK Top 40 albums. The only artists ahead of Bush were Elvis Presley, who had 12 entries in the top 40 after his death in 1977 and the Beatles who had 11 in 2009. She had 11 albums in the top 50.

In a statement, Bush said,

On 6 December 2018, Bush published her first book, &quot;How to Be Invisible,&quot; a compilation of lyrics. In November 2018, Bush released two box sets of remasters of her studio albums. Vocals from Rolf Harris, who was convicted of multiple sexual assault charges in 2014, were replaced by versions by Bush&#x27;s son Bertie. A compilation of rare tracks, cover versions and remixes from the boxsets, &quot;The Other Sides&quot;, was released on 8 March 2019. It includes the previously unreleased track &quot;Humming,&quot; recorded in 1975. In September 2019, Bush released &quot; / &quot; on vinyl, in France, as a limited-edition promotional single.

In September 2020, Bush became a Fellow of The Ivors Academy, the UK&#x27;s independent professional association for songwriters, composers and music authors. Following Bush&#x27;s award, another Fellow, Annie Lennox, commented, &quot;She is visionary and iconic and has made her own magical stamp upon the zeitgeist of the British cultural landscape.&quot;

=== 2022–present: &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; resurgence and Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame induction===
Bush&#x27;s 1985 single &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; gained newfound popularity in May 2022 after it was incorporated into the plot of the fourth season of the Netflix series &quot;Stranger Things.&quot; It became the most streamed song on Spotify in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and globally. Winona Ryder, who plays the character Joyce Byers on &quot;Stranger Things,&quot; said she had pushed for the song to be on the show: &quot;I&#x27;ve been obsessed with her since I was a little girl. I&#x27;ve also for the last seven years been dropping hints on set wearing my Kate Bush T-shirts.&quot; According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; has become particularly popular with members of Generation Z, who were not born when the song was first released, and it has appeared in numerous videos on the social media platform TikTok. Bush released a statement praising &quot;Stranger Things&quot; and saying the resurgence was &quot;really exciting&quot;.

On 10 June 2022, &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; reached number two on the UK singles chart, surpassing its peak of number three from 1985. It was the most popular track of the week in the UK, ahead of &quot;As It Was&quot; by Harry Styles, but a pre-existing chart rule penalised older songs that are streamed. The Chart Supervisory Committee responded by giving the record an exemption from the &quot;accelerated chart ratio&quot; rule due to its ongoing sales resurgence. On 17 June, the song reached number one in the UK, making it Bush&#x27;s second UK number one. It broke three UK chart records in the process. With 44 years since her last number one, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; in 1978, Bush surpassed Tom Jones&#x27;s 42-year gap between number ones and replaced Cher as the oldest female solo chart-topping artist at 63 years and 11 months. Bush also achieved the record for a single with the longest period taken to reach number one, beating the previous record, held by &quot;Last Christmas&quot; by Wham!, by a year.

On 11 June 2022, &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; re-entered the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number eight, surpassing its 1985 peak at No 30 and becoming Bush&#x27;s first US top-ten hit. The following week, it climbed to No 4 in the US, before reaching No 3 on 25 July. The parent album, &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;, also reached a new peak in the US, charting at No 12. The song topped the Australian ARIA Charts to become her second No 1 single in the country. In France, &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; beat its original chart peak of 24, placing at No 3. &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; also rose in popularity on various album charts, with it reaching No 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Alternative Albums chart, making it Bush&#x27;s first US chart-topping album. On 10 June, &quot;The Whole Story&quot; rose from No 76 to No 19 on the UK Albums Chart, peaking a week later at No 17. A limited edition CD single was released by Rhino. in September 2022, published in this format for the first time, the 2022 film &quot;A Man Called Otto&quot; featured the song &quot;This Woman&#x27;s Work&quot; from Bush&#x27;s album, &quot;The Sensual World.&quot; In May 2023, it was also featured in the Netflix film &quot;The Mother&quot;, spiking a sales resurgence for the song.

On 1 January 2023, Bush was included at No 60 in the list of &quot;200 Best Singers of All Time&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. On 22 February 2023, Bush announced that her label, Fish People, had moved to the new distribution partner, The state51 Conspiracy. The new company took over distribution of her post-1980 releases (starting from &quot;The Dreaming&quot;) worldwide, and the entire catalogue in the US only. This move has also generated renewed &quot;indie&quot; reissues of her albums. 

Bush was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018, 2021 and 2022, and was inducted in 2023, but did not attend the ceremony. She was inducted by Big Boi of OutKast, a long-time fan of her music. In his induction speech, Big Boi said, &quot;What I love about Kate&#x27;s music is that I never know what sound I&#x27;m gonna hear next. She ignores anything that seems like a formula and instead just does whatever she wants to do, like me. She challenges me as a listener and expands my ears and my mind. No matter how many times I look to albums like &quot;The Dreaming&quot; or &quot;50 Words for Snow&quot;, they sound fresh and surprise me every time. They fill my head with ideas and expand my ambitions for what music can achieve.&quot;

In February 2024, it was announced that Bush was an ambassador for that year&#x27;s Record Store Day on 20 April 2024. Her cancelled 1993-single &quot;Eat the Music&quot; will be released as a 10&quot; vinyl single. In a statement, Bush said,
On 25 October 2024, Bush released a short animated film, entitled &quot;Little Shrew&quot;, in support of War Child. The film is set to a radio edit of &quot;Snowflake&quot;, from &quot;50 Words of Snow&quot;. In an interview with the BBC, to promote &quot;Little Shrew&quot;, Bush revealed that she was &quot;very keen to start working on a new album when I&#x27;ve got [the film] finished. I&#x27;ve got lots of ideas and I&#x27;m really looking forward to getting back into that creative space, it&#x27;s been a long time.&quot; In November 2024, Bush received two nominations at the 67th Grammy Awards for Best Recording Package and Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package for the re-editions of &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;; her first nominations since 1996. Bush was one of more than 1,000 musicians to back an album of silence released on 25 February 2025, &quot;Is This What We Want?&quot;, protesting the use of unlicensed copyrighted work to train AI.

==Artistry==
===Musical style and voice===

Bush&#x27;s musical aesthetic is eclectic, and is known to employ varied influences and meld disparate styles, often within a single song or over the course of an album. Simon Reynolds of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called Bush &quot;the queen of art-pop&quot;, and she has also been described as art rock, baroque pop, avant-pop, progressive pop, and post-progressive. Ben Myers of &quot;Prog&quot; called Bush &quot;prog&#x27;s first pop star and pop&#x27;s first prog star&quot; whose &quot;career history and collaborations are inextricably tied in with prog and her ever-evolving output has much more in common with the genre than the pop world in which she first found herself operating.&quot; She has been grouped with other &quot;&#x27;arty&#x27; 1970s and &#x27;80s British pop rock artists&quot; such as Roxy Music and Peter Gabriel. Even in her earliest works, with piano the primary instrument, she wove together diverse influences, drawing on classical music, glam rock, and a wide range of ethnic and folk sources. This has continued throughout her career. By the time of &quot;Never for Ever&quot;, Bush had begun to make prominent use of the Fairlight CMI synthesiser, which allowed her to sample and manipulate sounds, expanding her sonic palette. 

Bush has a soprano vocal range. Her vocals contain elements of British, Anglo-Irish and most prominently (southern) English accents and, in its use of musical instruments from various periods and cultures, her music has differed from American pop norms. Reviewers have used the term &quot;surreal&quot; to describe her music. Her songs explore melodramatic emotional and musical surrealism that defies easy categorisation. It has been observed that even her more joyous pieces are often tinged with traces of melancholy and vice versa.

===Songwriting and influences===
Elements of Bush&#x27;s lyrics employ historical or literary references. This is embodied in her first single &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, which is based on Emily Brontë&#x27;s novel of the same name. She has described herself as a storyteller who embodies the character singing the song and has dismissed efforts by others to conceive of her work as autobiographical. Bush&#x27;s lyrics have been known to touch on obscure or esoteric subject matter, and &quot;New Musical Express&quot; noted that Bush was not afraid to tackle sensitive and taboo subjects in her work. &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; is based on a traditional English folk song (&quot;The Ballad of Lucy Wan&quot;) about an incestuous pregnancy and a resulting suicide. &quot;Kashka from Baghdad&quot; is a song about a gay couple; She has referenced G. I. Gurdjieff in the song &quot;Them Heavy People&quot;, while &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; was inspired by Peter Reich&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;A Book of Dreams&quot;, about his relationship with his father, Wilhelm Reich. &quot;Breathing&quot; explores the results of nuclear fallout from the perspective of a fœtus.

Other non-musical sources of inspiration for Bush include horror films, which have influenced the gothic nature of her songs, such as &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;, which samples the 1957 horror movie &quot;Night of the Demon&quot;. &quot;The Infant Kiss&quot; is a song about a haunted, unstable woman&#x27;s infatuation with a young boy in her care (inspired by Jack Clayton&#x27;s film &quot;The Innocents&quot; (1961), which had been based on Henry James&#x27;s novella &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;). The title of the song &quot;Hammer Horror&quot; is from Hammer Film Productions&#x27; horror movies, and the song&#x27;s story was inspired by the film &quot;Man of a Thousand Faces&quot; (1957). Her songs have occasionally combined comedy and horror to form dark humour, such as murder by poisoning in &quot;Coffee Homeground&quot;, an alcoholic mother in &quot;Ran Tan Waltz&quot; and the upbeat &quot;The Wedding List&quot;, a song inspired by François Truffaut&#x27;s 1967 film of Cornell Woolrich&#x27;s &quot;The Bride Wore Black&quot; about the murder of a groom and the bride&#x27;s subsequent revenge against the killer. Bush has also cited comedy as a significant influence. She has cited Woody Allen, Monty Python, &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;, and &quot;The Young Ones&quot; as particular favourites.

===Technical innovations===
Bush is regarded as the first artist to have had a headset with a wireless microphone built for use in music. For her Tour of Life in 1979, she had a compact microphone combined with a self-made construction of wire clothes hangers, so that she did not have to use a hand microphone. Having her hands free allowed Bush to dance her rehearsed choreography of expressionist dance on the concert stage and sing with a microphone at the same time. Her idea was later adopted by other artists such as Janet Jackson, Madonna and Peter Gabriel.

==Influence==

According to Alexis Petridis of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Bush&#x27;s &quot;shadow looms so large that whenever a female singer-songwriter emerges who is even remotely out of the ordinary, it&#x27;s only a matter of time before someone, fairly or otherwise, mentions Bush&quot;.

Musicians who have acknowledged Bush&#x27;s influence include Björk, Alanis Morissette, Nigel Godrich, Florence Welch, Fever Ray, Big Boi, Regina Spektor, Fiona Apple, Imogen Heap, Sharon Van Etten, Ellie Goulding, Kyros, Aisles, FKA Twigs, Neil Hannon of the Divine Comedy, Grimes, Solange Knowles, Julia Holter, Angel Olsen, Halsey, Tupac Shakur, Robyn, Caroline Polachek, and Chappell Roan.

In 2015, Adele stated that the release of her third studio album &quot;25&quot; was inspired by Bush&#x27;s 2014 comeback to the stage. Nerina Pallot was inspired to become a songwriter after seeing Bush play &quot;This Woman&#x27;s Work&quot; on &quot;Wogan&quot;. Bush was described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as an &quot;early role model&quot; for Dido. The Australian singer-songwriter Sia described Bush as one of the &quot;weird&quot; artists she &quot;grew up with&quot;, along with Adam Ant, Boy George and Cyndi Lauper. k.d. lang named Bush as one of the artists she was listening to when she was starting to write songs. Jack Antonoff has described Bush as an artist he listens to when he writes songs. Andy Bell described Bush as &quot;a major influence on a lot of Erasure&#x27;s album tracks&quot;. When Little Boots was asked about female producers or songwriters that have inspired her, she highlighted Bush for &quot;how involved she got with the studio side as well as the performance&quot;. Kate Nash described Bush as &quot;really amazing and really inspirational&quot;. Bat for Lashes also called her &quot;a real inspiration&quot;. Tegan and Sara called Bush a &quot;huge influence&quot; on them when they were growing up in the 1980s, and Sky Ferreira named her when asked about her &quot;primary influences&quot; from that decade. Rosalía named Bush as one of the female artists who made success possible for artists like her. Beverley Craven acknowledged that when she was beginning to write songs, she was &quot;trying to sound like Kate Bush&quot;. Tim Bowness of No-Man named Bush as one of his early influences. 

Elton John cited Bush&#x27;s duet with Peter Gabriel, &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot;, for helping him to become sober, particularly Bush&#x27;s lyric, &quot;Rest your head. You worry too much. It&#x27;s going to be all right. When times get rough you can fall back on us. Don&#x27;t give up.&quot; He stated, &quot;she [Bush] played a big part in my rebirth.&quot; After doing a duet with Bush in 2011, John praised her talents as a musician, stating &quot;I&#x27;m so proud to be on a Kate Bush record; she&#x27;s always marched to the beat of her own drum. She was groundbreaking – a bit like a female equivalent of Freddie Mercury. She does come out socially sometimes and she came to my civil partnership occasion with her husband. There were so many stars in the room, but all the musicians there were only interested in saying, &#x27;You&#x27;ve got to introduce me to Kate Bush.&#x27; I remember Boy George saying, &#x27;Oh my God, is that Kate Bush?&#x27; I said, &#x27;Yeah!&#x27;.&quot;

Bush was one of the singers whom Prince thanked in the liner notes of 1991&#x27;s &quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot;. Kirk Hammett of Metallica listed Bush as one of the influences on &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;. According to an unauthorised biography, Courtney Love of Hole listened to Bush among other artists as a teenager. Tricky of Massive Attack wrote an article about &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;, saying: &quot;Her music has always sounded like dreamland to me... I don&#x27;t believe in God, but if I did, her music would be my bible&quot;. John Lydon, better known as Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols, declared her work to be &quot;beauty beyond belief&quot;. Rotten once wrote a song for her, titled &quot;Bird in Hand&quot; (about exploitation of parrots) that Bush rejected. In 1999, VH1 named Bush the 46th-greatest woman in rock and roll.

Marianne Faithfull mentioned Bush&#x27;s four-octave range should be regarded as a &quot;national treasure&quot;. &quot;My favourite instrument in the whole world is the human female voice, and Kate Bush is one of the reasons why. It is, by far, a Stradivarius,&quot; Faithfull says. &quot;Which is why she rarely deals with the press or isn&#x27;t in a rush to record. She&#x27;s one of the few who can be above all that.&quot; Enya praised Bush in a similar manner: &quot;When you think of Kate Bush, you think of the music, not the headlines.&quot; Rufus Wainwright named Bush one of his top ten gay icons. Outside music, Bush has been an inspiration to several fashion designers, including Hussein Chalayan. In 1998 an asteroid was named after Bush.

In 2019, French record producer Pone, who is paralysed from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, released &quot;Kate &amp; Me&quot;, an entire album created from samples of Kate Bush&#x27;s work. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, it&#x27;s the &quot;first album in history to be entirely produced through an eye-tracking device&quot;. Pone declares that Bush is the greatest artist of the past 40 years. Pone reiterated the experience in June 2021 by publishing &quot;Listen And Donate&quot;. An EP composed of four tracks including two originals by Pone, still based on samples of Kate Bush&#x27;s work, and two remixes produced by SCH and Para One. JR signs the visual part of the project. The goal is to raise funds for the Trakadom association, created by Pone and two doctors in collaboration with the intensive care unit of the hospital of Nîmes.

In 2020, &quot;Grazia&quot; magazine conducted an interview with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. When asked about the five most influential women in his life, Johnson placed Kate Bush at the fifth spot after deliberating between nominating Queen Elizabeth II, Margaret Thatcher, and Bush.

In addition to her music, her dancing has been critically acclaimed and proven influential, as well as enduring in the popular consciousness. Critics have noted her &quot;pioneering synthesis of music and movement&quot; and called her work &quot;modern dance at its most powerful&quot;. Prix Benois de la Danse winner Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui credits her dancing as a formative influence. For the recurring The Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever event, thousands of people gather worldwide to recreate her dance routine from the &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; music video—the outside version where Bush is seen dancing &quot;out in the wily, windy moors&quot;, adorned with flowers and a flowy red dress.

==Live performances==
Bush&#x27;s only tour, the Tour of Life, ran for six weeks in April and May 1979, covering Britain and mainland Europe. The BBC suggested that she may have quit touring due to a fear of flying, or because of the death of a lighting engineer, Bill Duffield, who was killed in an accident after a warmup concert. Mercer, who signed Bush to EMI, said touring was &quot;just too hard ... I think [Bush] liked it but the equation didn&#x27;t work ... I could see at the end of the show that she was completely wiped out.&quot; Bush described the tour as &quot;enormously enjoyable&quot; but &quot;absolutely exhausting&quot;.

During the same period as the Tour of Life, Bush performed on television programs including &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in the UK, &quot;Bio&#x27;s Bahnhof&quot; in Germany, and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in the United States (performing &quot;The Man with the Child in His Eyes&quot; with Paul Shaffer on piano, and later in the programme, &quot;Them Heavy People&quot;), which remains her only live performance in the country. On 28 December 1979, BBC TV aired the &quot;Kate Bush Christmas Special&quot;. In July 1982, Bush participated in the first benefit concert in aid of The Prince&#x27;s Trust, singing &quot;The Wedding List&quot; with a backing band composed of Pete Townshend, Phil Collins, Midge Ure, Mick Karn, Gary Brooker, Dave Formula, and Peter Hope Evans. The performance was later released on VHS video, Laserdisc and CED disc. She performed live for British charity event Comic Relief in 1986, singing &quot;Do Bears... ?&quot;, a humorous duet with Rowan Atkinson, and a rendition of &quot;Breathing&quot;. In March 1987, Bush sang &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; at The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Third Ball accompanied by David Gilmour. She appeared with Gilmour again in 2002, singing the Pink Floyd song &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; at the Royal Festival Hall in London.

Bush returned to headline performance with a 22-night residency, Before the Dawn, which ran from 26 August to 1 October 2014 at the London Hammersmith Apollo. The set list encompassed most of &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; featuring the entire Ninth Wave suite, most of &quot;Aerial&quot; featuring the entire An Endless Sky of Honey suite including new song &quot;Tawny Moon&quot;, two songs from &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, and one song from &quot;50 Words for Snow&quot;.

==Collaborations==
Bush provided vocals on two of Peter Gabriel&#x27;s albums, including the hits &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot;, as well as &quot;No Self-Control&quot;. Gabriel appeared on Bush&#x27;s 1979 television special, where they sang a duet of Roy Harper&#x27;s &quot;Another Day&quot;. She has sung on two Roy Harper tracks, &quot;You&quot;, on his 1979 album, &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;; and &quot;Once&quot;, the title track of his 1990 album. She has also sung on the title song of the 1986 Big Country album &quot;The Seer;&quot; the Midge Ure song &quot;Sister and Brother&quot; from his 1988 album &quot;Answers to Nothing&quot;; Go West&#x27;s 1987 single &quot;The King Is Dead&quot;; and two songs with Prince – &quot;Why Should I Love You?&quot;, from her 1993 album &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, and &quot;My Computer&quot; from Prince&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Emancipation&quot;. In 1987, she sang a verse on the Beatles cover charity single &quot;Let It Be&quot; by Ferry Aid.

In 1990, Bush produced a song for another artist, Alan Stivell&#x27;s &quot;Kimiad&quot; for his album &quot;Again&quot;; this is the only time she has done this to date. Stivell had appeared on &quot;The Sensual World&quot;. In 1991, Bush was invited to perform a cover of Elton John&#x27;s 1972 song &quot;Rocket Man&quot; for the tribute album &quot;Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John &amp; Bernie Taupin&quot;. In 2007 Bush&#x27;s cover won &quot;The Observer&quot; readers&#x27; award for Greatest Cover of all time. In 2011, Elton John collaborated with Bush once again in &quot;Snowed in at Wheeler Street&quot; for her most recent album &quot;50 Words for Snow&quot;. In 1994, Bush covered George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;The Man I Love&quot; for the tribute album &quot;The Glory of Gershwin&quot;. In 1996, Bush contributed a version of &quot;Mná na hÉireann&quot; (Irish for &quot;Women of Ireland&quot;) for the Anglo-Irish folk-rock compilation project &quot;Common Ground: The Voices of Modern Irish Music&quot;. Bush had to sing the song in Irish, which she learned to do phonetically.

Artists who have contributed to Bush&#x27;s own albums include Elton John, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, David Gilmour, Roy Harper, Nigel Kennedy, Gary Brooker, Danny Thompson, and Prince. Bush provided backing vocals for a song that was recorded during the 1990s titled &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t Change a Thing&quot; by Lionel Azulay, the drummer with the original band that was later to become the KT Bush Band. The song, which was engineered and produced by Del Palmer, was released on Azulay&#x27;s album &quot;Out of the Ashes&quot;. Bush declined a request by Erasure to produce one of their albums because, according to Vince Clarke, &quot;she didn&#x27;t feel that that was her area&quot;.

Kate has also worked with the ethnic bulgarian group Trio Bulgarka. They provided the backing vocals on the songs: &quot;Deeper Understanding&quot;, &quot;Never Be Mine&quot;, and &quot;Rocket&#x27;s Tail&quot; from Bush&#x27;s album &quot;The Sensual World&quot; in 1989. They also make an appearance in her 1993 album &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; in the songs &quot;You&#x27;re The One&quot;, The Song of Solomon&quot;, and &quot;Why Should I Love You&quot;. Bush revealed that she was introduced to the group 3 years prior to the making of &quot;The Sensual World&quot; by her brother, Paddy, who is interested in cultural music. She also addressed the language barrier by saying that despite the more difficult process, the connection feels more genuine because it&#x27;s an emotional bond rather than intellectual one.

==Personal life==
Bush and guitarist Danny McIntosh have a son, Albert McIntosh, known as Bertie, born in 1998, although whether they are married is unknown. From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, Bush was in a relationship with bassist and sound engineer Del Palmer.

Bush is a former resident of Eltham in southeast London. In the 1990s she moved to a canalside residence in Sulhamstead, Berkshire, and bought a second home in Devon in 2004. Bush is a vegetarian. Bush was raised a Roman Catholic. In 1999, she said:

The length of time between albums has led to rumours concerning Bush&#x27;s health or appearance. In 2011, she told BBC Radio 4 that the amount of time between albums was stressful: &quot;It&#x27;s very frustrating the albums take as long as they do ... I wish there weren&#x27;t such big gaps between them&quot;. In the same interview, she denied that she was a perfectionist, saying: &quot;I think it&#x27;s important that things are flawed ... That&#x27;s what makes a piece of art interesting sometimes – the bit that&#x27;s wrong or the mistake you&#x27;ve made that&#x27;s led onto an idea you wouldn&#x27;t have had otherwise.&quot; She reiterated her prioritisation of her family life.

Bush&#x27;s son Bertie featured in the 2014 concert Before the Dawn. Her nephew Raven Bush was a violinist in the English indie band Syd Arthur.

=== Political views ===
Some of Bush&#x27;s songs contain references to political and social themes, including &quot;Breathing&quot;, which addresses the fear of nuclear warfare and &quot;Army Dreamers&quot;, which examines the grief felt by mothers who lose children serving in the military during war. In a 1985 interview with &quot;The NewMusic,&quot; Bush stated &quot;I&#x27;ve never felt I&#x27;ve written from a political point of view, it&#x27;s always been an emotional point of view that just happens to perhaps be a political situation.&quot;

During the 1979 United Kingdom general election campaign, Bush, who at the time was on a live concert tour of the UK, posed for a photograph alongside the Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan. When asked about her political beliefs in a 1985 interview with &quot;Hot Press&quot;, Bush replied that she preferred not to discuss how she voted and added &quot;I don&#x27;t feel I am a political thinker at all. I don&#x27;t really understand politics.&quot;

In &quot;The Comic Strip Presents...&quot; episode &quot;&quot;, she produced and sang on the theme song &quot;Ken&quot;, a satirical take on how Hollywood glamourises and fictionalises political figures, in this particular case Ken Livingstone, the former leader of the Greater London Council, and the lyrics parodied the theme from &quot;Shaft&quot;.

In 2016, the Canadian news magazine &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; published an interview in which Bush was asked about people being afraid of women holding political power. Bush pointed out that the UK, unlike the US, did have a female leader, Theresa May, who a few months earlier had become the Conservative Prime Minister. The interview quoted Bush as saying: &quot;I actually really like her and think she&#x27;s wonderful. I think it&#x27;s the best thing that&#x27;s happened to us in a long time ... It is great to have a woman in charge of the country. She&#x27;s very sensible and I think that&#x27;s a good thing at this point in time.&quot; In 2019, Bush published a statement on her website saying that she was not a Conservative Party supporter, that she felt May was an improvement over the previous Prime Minister, and that she had intended only to defend women in power.

In April 2021, Bush was one of 156 signatories of an open letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson calling for a change in the wording of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 to make royalty payments for streaming closer to the amounts paid for radio broadcast.

In December 2022, in her annual Christmas message, Bush expressed solidarity with nurses undertaking strike action, stating that NHS nurses should be &quot;appreciated and cherished&quot;.

<doc id="17445" wikidata="Q310848" url="?curid=17445" title="Kittiwake">
<text>The kittiwakes (genus Rissa) are two closely related seabird species in the gull family Laridae, the black-legged kittiwake (&quot;Rissa tridactyla&quot;) and the red-legged kittiwake (&quot;Rissa brevirostris&quot;). The epithets &quot;black-legged&quot; and &quot;red-legged&quot; are used to distinguish the two species in North America, but in Europe, where &quot;Rissa brevirostris&quot; is not found, the black-legged kittiwake is often known simply as kittiwake. The name is derived from its call, a shrill &#x27;kittee-wa-aaake, kitte-wa-aaake&#x27;. The genus name &quot;Rissa&quot; is from the Icelandic name &quot;Rita&quot; for the black-legged kittiwake.

==Description==
The two species are physically very similar. They have a white head and body, grey back, grey wings tipped solid black and a bright yellow bill. Black-legged kittiwake adults are somewhat larger (roughly in length with a wingspan of ) than red-legged kittiwakes ( in length with a wingspan around ). Other differences include a shorter bill, larger eyes, a larger, rounder head and darker grey wings in the red-legged kittiwake. While most black-legged kittiwakes do, indeed, have dark-grey legs, some have pinkish-grey to reddish legs, making colouration a somewhat unreliable identifying marker.

In contrast to the dappled chicks of other gull species, kittiwake chicks are downy and white since they are under relatively little threat of predation, as the nests are on extremely steep cliffs. Unlike other gull chicks which wander around as soon as they can walk, kittiwake chicks instinctively sit still in the nest to avoid falling off. Juveniles take three years to reach maturity. When in winter plumage, both birds have a dark grey smudge behind the eye and a grey hind-neck collar. The sexes are visually indistinguishable.

==Distribution and habitat==
Kittiwakes are coastal breeding birds ranging in the North Pacific, North Atlantic, and Arctic oceans. They form large, dense, noisy colonies during the summer reproductive period, often sharing habitat with murres. They are the only gull species that are exclusively cliff-nesting. A colony of kittiwakes living in Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead in the north east of England has made homes on both the Tyne Bridge and Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art. This colony is notable because it is the furthest inland colony of kittiwakes in the world.

<doc id="17448" wikidata="Q4115156" url="?curid=17448" title="Kuwaiti oil fires">
<text>The Kuwaiti oil fires were caused by the Iraqi military setting fire to a reported 605 to 732 oil wells along with an unspecified number of oil filled low-lying areas, such as oil lakes and fire trenches while retreating from Kuwait in 1991 due to the advances of US-led coalition forces in the Gulf War. The fires were started in January and February 1991, and the first oil well fires were extinguished in early April 1991, with the last well capped on November 6, 1991.

==Motives==

The dispute between Iraq and Kuwait over alleged slant-drilling in the Rumaila oil field was one of the reasons for Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

In addition, Kuwait had been producing oil above treaty limits established by OPEC. By the eve of the Iraqi invasion, Kuwait had set production quotas to almost , which coincided with a sharp drop in the price of oil. By the summer of 1990, Kuwaiti overproduction had become a serious point of contention with Iraq.

Some analysts have speculated that one of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s main motivations in invading Kuwait was to punish the ruling al-Sabah family in Kuwait for not stopping its policy of overproduction, as well as his reasoning behind the destruction of said wells.

It is also hypothesized that Iraq decided to destroy the oil fields to achieve a military advantage, believing the intense smoke plumes serving as smoke screens created by the burning oil wells would inhibit Coalition offensive airstrikes, foil allied precision guided weapons and spy satellites, and could screen Iraq&#x27;s military movements. Furthermore, it is thought that Iraq&#x27;s military leaders may have regarded the heat, smoke, and debris from hundreds of burning oil wells as presenting a formidable area denial obstacle to Coalition forces. The onset of the oil well destruction supports this military dimension to the sabotage of the wells; for example, during the early stage of the Coalition air campaign, the number of oil wells afire was relatively small but the number increased dramatically in late February with the arrival of the ground war.

The Iraqi military combat engineers also released oil into low-lying areas for defensive purposes against infantry and mechanized units along Kuwait&#x27;s southern border, by constructing several &quot;fire trenches&quot; roughly long, and meters wide and deep to impede the advance of Coalition ground forces.

The military use of the land based fires should also be seen in context with the coinciding, deliberate, sea based Gulf War oil spill, the apparent strategic goal of which was to foil a potential amphibious landing by U.S. Marines.

==Extent==

As an international coalition under United States command assembled in anticipation of an invasion of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, the Iraqi regime decided to destroy as much of Kuwait&#x27;s oil reserves and infrastructure as possible before withdrawing from that country. As early as December 1990, Iraqi forces placed explosive charges on Kuwaiti oil wells. The wells were systematically sabotaged beginning on January 16, 1991, when the allies commenced air strikes against Iraqi targets. On February 8, satellite images detected the first smoke from burning oil wells. The number of oil fires peaked between February 22 and 24, when the allied ground offensive began.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s report to Congress, &quot;the retreating Iraqi army set fire to or damaged over 700 oil wells, storage tanks, refineries, and facilities in Kuwait.&quot; Estimates placed the number of oil well fires from 605 to 732. A further thirty-four wells had been destroyed by heavy coalition bombing in January. The Kuwait Petroleum Company&#x27;s estimate as of September 1991 was that there had been 610 fires, out of a total of 749 facilities damaged or on fire along with an unspecified number of oil filled low-lying areas, such as &quot;oil lakes&quot; and &quot;fire trenches&quot;. These fires constituted approximately 50% of the total number of oil well fires in the history of the petroleum industry, and temporarily damaged or destroyed approximately 85% of the wells in every major Kuwaiti oil field.

Concerted efforts to bring the fires and other damage under control began in April 1991. During the uncontrolled burning phase from February to April, various sources estimated that the ignited wellheads burnt through between four and six million barrels of crude oil, and between seventy and one hundred million cubic meters of natural gas per day. Seven months later, 441 facilities had been brought under control, while 308 remained uncontrolled. The last well was capped on November 6, 1991. The total amount of oil burned is generally estimated at one billion barrels or just below one percent of Kuwait&#x27;s entire supply of 104 billion barrels. Daily global oil consumption in 2022 is about 99.4 million barrels; the oil lost to combustion would last 10 days at modern usage rates.

=== Financial losses ===
In March 1991 the accumulated financial losses were estimated to be as much as 10% of 90 billion barrels of Kuwait oil reserves based on a statement made by a Kuwait Oil Company official. At the world prices at the time it would amount to US$ 157.5 billion.

==Military effects==


On March 21, 1991, a Royal Saudi Air Force C-130H crashed in heavy smoke due to the Kuwaiti oil fires on approach to Ras Mishab Airport, Saudi Arabia. 92 Senegalese soldiers and 6 Saudi crew members were killed, the largest accident among Coalition forces.

The smoke screening was also used by Iraqi anti-armor forces to a successful extent in the Battle of Phase Line Bullet, having aided in achieving the element of surprise against advancing Bradley IFVs, along with increasing the general fog of war.

The fires burned out of control because of the dangers of sending in firefighting crews during the war. Land mines had been placed in areas around the oil wells and military demining was necessary before the fires could be put out. Around of oil were lost each day. Eventually, privately contracted crews extinguished the fires, at a total cost of US$1.5 billion to Kuwait. By that time, however, the fires had burned for approximately ten months, causing widespread pollution.

The fires have been linked with what was later deemed Gulf War syndrome, a chronic disorder afflicting military veterans and civilian workers that include fatigue, muscle pain, and cognitive problems; however, studies have indicated that the firemen who capped the wells did not report any of the symptoms that the soldiers experienced. The cause of Gulf War syndrome has since been ascribed to Sarin nerve agent.

From the perspective of ground forces, apart from the occasional &quot;oil rain&quot; experienced by troops very close to spewing wells, one of the more commonly experienced effects of the oil field fires were the ensuing smoke plumes which rose into the atmosphere and then precipitated or fell out of the air via dry deposition and by rain. The pillar-like plumes frequently broadened and joined up with other smoke plumes at higher altitudes, producing a cloudy grey overcast effect, as only about 10% of all the fires corresponding with those that originated from &quot;oil lakes&quot; produced pure black soot filled plumes, 25% of the fires emitted white to grey plumes, while the remainder emitted plumes with colors between grey and black. For example, one Gulf War veteran stated:

A paper published in 2000 analyzed the degree of exposure by troops to particulate matter, including soot. However, the paper focused more-so on silica sand, which can produce silicosis. The paper included troop medical records, and in its conclusion: &quot;A literature review indicated negligible to nonexistent health risk from other inhaled particulate material (other than silica) during the Gulf War&quot;.

==Extinguishing efforts==

The burning wells needed to be extinguished as, without active efforts, Kuwait would lose billions of dollars in oil revenues. It was predicted by experts that the fires would burn for between two and five years before losing pressure and going out on their own.

The companies responsible for extinguishing the fires initially were Bechtel, Red Adair Company (now sold to Global Industries of Louisiana), Boots and Coots, and Wild Well Control. Safety Boss was the fourth company to arrive but ended up extinguishing and capping the most wells of any other company: 180 of the 600. Other companies including Cudd Well/Pressure Control, Neal Adams Firefighters, and Kuwait Wild Well Killers were also contracted.

According to Larry H. Flak, a petroleum engineer for Boots and Coots International Well Control, 90% of all the 1991 fires in Kuwait were put out with nothing but sea water, sprayed from powerful hoses at the base of the fire. The extinguishing water was supplied to the arid desert region by re-purposing the oil pipelines that prior to the arson attack had pumped oil from the wells to the Persian Gulf. The pipeline had been mildly damaged but, once repaired, its flow was reversed to pump Persian gulf seawater to the burning oil wells. The extinguishing rate was approximately 1 every 7–10 days at the start of efforts but then with experience gained and the removal of the mine fields that surrounded the burning wells, the rate increased to 2 or more per day.

For stubborn oil well fires, the use of a gas turbine to blast a large volume of water at high velocity at the fire proved popular with firefighters in Kuwait and was brought to the region by Hungarians equipped with MiG-21 engines mounted originally on a T-34 tank (later replaced with T-55 tank), called &quot;Big wind&quot;. It extinguished 9 fires in 43 days.

In fighting a fire at a directly vertical spewing wellhead, high explosives, such as dynamite were used to create a blast wave that pushes the burning fuel and local atmospheric oxygen away from the well. (This is a similar principle to blowing out a candle.) The flame is removed and the fuel can continue to spill out without igniting. Generally, explosives were placed within 55 gallon drums, the explosives surrounded by fire retardant chemicals, and then the drums are wrapped with insulating material with a horizontal crane being used to bring the drum as close to the burning area as possible.

The firefighting teams titled their occupation as &quot;Operation Desert Hell&quot; after Operation Desert Storm.

==Environmental impact==

===Oil fire smoke===
Immediately following Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait, predictions were made of an environmental disaster stemming from Iraqi threats to blow up captured Kuwaiti oil wells. Speculation ranging from a nuclear winter type scenario, to heavy acid rain and even short term immediate global warming were presented at the World Climate Conference in Geneva that November.

On January 10, 1991, a paper appearing in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; stated Paul Crutzen&#x27;s calculations predicting that the oil well fires would produce a cloud of smoke covering half the Northern Hemisphere, resulting in widespread cooling similar to nuclear winter; temperatures beneath the cloud would be reduced by 5–10 degrees Celsius after 100 days. This was followed by articles printed in the &quot;Wilmington Morning Star&quot; and the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; newspapers in mid to late January 1991, with the popular television scientist personality of the time, Carl Sagan, who was also the co-author of the first few nuclear winter papers along with Richard P. Turco, John W. Birks, Alan Robock and Paul Crutzen together collectively stated that they expected catastrophic nuclear winter-like effects with continental sized impacts of &quot;sub-freezing&quot; temperatures as a result if the Iraqis went through with their threats of igniting 300 to 500 pressurized oil wells and they burned for a few months.

Later when Operation Desert Storm had begun, S. Fred Singer and Carl Sagan discussed the possible environmental impacts of the Kuwaiti petroleum fires on the ABC News program &quot;Nightline&quot;. Sagan again argued that some of the effects of the smoke could be similar to the effects of a nuclear winter, with smoke lofting into the stratosphere, a region of the atmosphere beginning around above sea level at Kuwait, resulting in global effects and that he believed the net effects would be very similar to the explosion of the Indonesian volcano Tambora in 1815, which resulted in the year 1816 being known as the &quot;Year Without a Summer&quot;. He reported on initial modeling estimates that forecast impacts extending to south Asia, and perhaps to the northern hemisphere as well.

Singer, on the other hand, said that calculations showed that the smoke would go to an altitude of about and then be rained out after about three to five days and thus the lifetime of the smoke would be limited. Both height estimates made by Singer and Sagan turned out to be wrong, albeit with Singer&#x27;s narrative being closer to what transpired, with the comparatively minimal atmospheric effects remaining limited to the Arabian Gulf region, with smoke plumes, in general, lofting to about and a few times as high as .

Along with Singer&#x27;s televised critique, Richard D. Small criticized the initial &quot;Nature&quot; paper in a reply on March 7, 1991, arguing along similar lines as Singer.

Sagan later conceded in his book &quot;The Demon-Haunted World&quot; that his prediction did not turn out to be correct: &quot;it &quot;was&quot; pitch black at noon and temperatures dropped 4–6 °C over the Arabian Gulf, but not much smoke reached stratospheric altitudes and Asia was spared.&quot;

At the peak of the fires, the smoke absorbed 75 to 80% of the sun&#x27;s radiation. The particles rose to a maximum of , but were scavenged by cloud condensation nuclei from the atmosphere relatively quickly.

Sagan and his colleagues expected that a &quot;self-lofting&quot; of the sooty smoke would occur when it absorbed the sun&#x27;s heat radiation, with little to no scavenging occurring, whereby the black particles of soot would be heated by the sun and lifted/lofted higher and higher into the air, thereby injecting the soot into the stratosphere where it would take years for the sun blocking effect of this aerosol of soot to fall out of the air, and with that, catastrophic ground level cooling and agricultural impacts in Asia and possibly the Northern Hemisphere as a whole.

In retrospect, it is now known that smoke from the Kuwait oil fires only affected the weather pattern throughout the Arabian Gulf and surrounding region during the periods that the fires were burning in 1991, with lower atmospheric winds blowing the smoke along the eastern half of the Arabian Peninsula, and cities such as Dhahran and Riyadh, and countries such as Bahrain experienced days with smoke filled skies and carbon soot rainout/fallout.

Thus the immediate consequence of the arson sabotage was a dramatic regional decrease in air quality, causing respiratory problems for many Kuwaitis and those in neighboring countries.

According to the 1992 study from Peter Hobbs and Lawrence Radke, daily emissions of sulfur dioxide (which can generate acid rain) from the Kuwaiti oil fires were 57% of that from electric utilities in the United States, the emissions of carbon dioxide were 2% of global emissions and emissions of soot reached 3400 metric tons per day.

In a paper in the DTIC archive, published in 2000, it states that &quot;Calculations based on smoke from Kuwaiti oil fires in May and June 1991 indicate that combustion efficiency was about 96% in producing carbon dioxide. While, with respect to the incomplete combustion fraction, Smoke particulate matter accounted for 2% of the fuel burned, of which 0.4% was soot.&quot; (With the remaining 2% being oil that did not undergo any initial combustion).

===Smoke documentary===
Peter V. Hobbs also narrated a short amateur documentary titled &quot;Kuwait Oil Fires&quot; that followed the University of Washington/UW&#x27;s &quot;Cloud and Aerosol Research Group&quot; as they flew through, around and above the smoke clouds and took samples, measurements, and video of the smoke clouds in their Convair C-131. Aerial laboratory.

==Damage to coastline==

Although scenarios that predicted long-lasting environmental impacts on a global atmospheric level due to the burning oil sources did not transpire, long-lasting ground level oil spill impacts were detrimental to the environment regionally.

Forty-six oil wells are estimated to have gushed, and before efforts to cap them began, they were releasing approximately 300,000–400,000 barrels of oil per day, with the last gusher being capped occurring in the latter days of October 1991.

The Kuwaiti Oil Minister estimated between twenty-five and fifty million barrels of unburned oil from damaged facilities pooled to create approximately 300 oil lakes, that contaminated around 40 million tons of sand and earth. The mixture of desert sand, unignited oil spilled and soot generated by the burning oil wells formed layers of hard &quot;tarcrete&quot;, which covered nearly five percent of Kuwait&#x27;s land mass.

Cleaning efforts were led by the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research and the Arab Oil Co., who tested a number of technologies including the use of petroleum-degrading bacteria on the oil lakes.

Vegetation in most of the contaminated areas adjoining the oil lakes began recovering by 1995, but the dry climate has also partially solidified some of the lakes. Over time the oil has continued to sink into the sand, with potential consequences for Kuwait&#x27;s small groundwater resources.

The land based Kuwaiti oil spill surpassed the Lakeview Gusher, which spilled nine million barrels in 1910, as the largest oil spill in recorded history.

Six to eight million barrels of oil were directly spilled into the Arabian Gulf, which became known as the Gulf War oil spill.

==Documentaries==
The fires were the subject of a 1992 IMAX documentary film, &quot;Fires of Kuwait&quot;, which was nominated for an Academy Award. The film includes footage of the Hungarian team using their jet turbine extinguisher.

&quot;Lessons of Darkness&quot; is a 1992 film by director Werner Herzog that explores the ravaged oil fields of post-Gulf War Kuwait.

Bechtel Corporation produced a short documentary titled &quot;Kuwait: Bringing Back the Sun&quot; that summarizes and focuses upon the fire fighting efforts, which were dubbed the Al-Awda (Arabic for &quot;The Return&quot;) project.

==Comparable incidents==

During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, approximately 40 oil wells were set on fire in the Persian Gulf within Iraq by Iraqi forces, ostensibly to hinder the invasion. The &quot;Kuwait Wild Well Killers&quot;, who successfully extinguished 41 of the Kuwait oil well fires in 1991, used their experience to tackle blazes in the Iraqi Rumaila oilfields in 2003.

<text>Kirsten Caroline Dunst (; born April 30, 1982) is an American actress. She made her acting debut in the anthology film &quot;New York Stories&quot; (1989) and has since starred in several film and television productions. She has received several awards including nominations for an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, and four Golden Globe Awards.

Dunst first gained recognition for her role as child vampire Claudia in the horror film &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; (1994), which earned her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress. She also had roles in her youth in &quot;Little Women&quot; (1994) and &quot;Jumanji&quot; (1995). Dunst transitioned to leading roles in teen films of 1999, the satires &quot;Dick&quot; and &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot; and Sofia Coppola’s drama &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;. After leading the cheerleading film &quot;Bring It On&quot; (2000), she gained wider attention for her role as Mary Jane Watson in Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; trilogy (2002–2007). Her career progressed with a supporting role in &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; (2004), followed by a lead role in Cameron Crowe&#x27;s tragicomedy &quot;Elizabethtown&quot; (2005), and as Marie Antoinette in Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (2006).

In 2011, Dunst starred as a depressed newlywed in Lars von Trier&#x27;s drama &quot;Melancholia&quot;, which earned her the Cannes Film Festival Award For Best Actress. In 2015, she played Peggy Blumquist in the second season of the FX series &quot;Fargo&quot;, earning a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for the role. Dunst had a supporting role in the film &quot;Hidden Figures&quot; (2016), and leading roles in Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Beguiled&quot; (2017) and in the dark comedy series &quot;On Becoming a God in Central Florida&quot; (2019), for which she received a third Golden Globe nomination. Dunst earned her fourth nomination for a Golden Globe and first nomination for an Academy Award for her performance in the psychological drama &quot;The Power of the Dog&quot; (2021). In 2024, she led the dystopian thriller film &quot;Civil War&quot;.

==Early life==
Dunst was born on April 30, 1982, at Point Pleasant Hospital in Point Pleasant, New Jersey. Dunst&#x27;s father worked for Siemens as a medical services executive, and her mother worked for Lufthansa as a flight attendant. She was also an artist and one-time gallery owner. Dunst&#x27;s father is German, originally from Hamburg, and her American mother is of German and Swedish descent; she described herself in a 2001 interview as &quot;Aryan. Like a Swedish milkmaid&quot;. Until the age of eleven, Dunst lived in Brick Township, New Jersey, and attended Ranney School in Tinton Falls.

In 1993, she moved to Los Angeles with her mother and brother, after her parents separated. In her teens, she found it difficult to cope with her rising fame, and for a period she blamed her mother for pushing her into acting as a child. However, she later said that her mother &quot;always had the best intentions&quot;. When asked if she had any regrets about her childhood, Dunst said, &quot;Well, it&#x27;s not a natural way to grow up, but it&#x27;s the way I grew up and I wouldn&#x27;t change it. I have my stuff to work out... I don&#x27;t think anybody can sit around and say, &#x27;My life is more screwed up than yours.&#x27; Everybody has their issues&quot;.

==Acting career==
=== 1988–1993: Early work ===
Dunst began her career at age three as a child fashion model in television commercials. She was signed with Ford Models and Elite Model Management. In 1988, she appeared in &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as the granddaughter of George H. W. Bush. Later that year, she made her feature film debut with a minor role in Woody Allen&#x27;s short film &quot;Oedipus Wrecks&quot;; it was released as one-third of the anthology film &quot;New York Stories&quot; (1989). Soon after, Dunst performed in the comedy-drama &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; (1990), based on Tom Wolfe&#x27;s novel of the same name, in which she played the daughter of Tom Hanks&#x27; character. In 1993, Dunst made a guest appearance in an episode of the science fiction drama &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

=== 1994–2001: Career breakthrough ===
Dunst&#x27;s breakthrough role came in 1994, in the horror drama &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; opposite Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, based on Anne Rice&#x27;s novel of the same name. She played Claudia, the child vampire who is a surrogate daughter to Cruise&#x27;s and Pitt&#x27;s characters. The film included a scene in which Dunst shared her first onscreen kiss with Pitt, who is two decades her senior. She stated that kissing him had made her feel uncomfortable: &quot;I thought it was gross, that Brad had cooties. I mean, I was 10,&quot; she recalled. While the film overall received mixed reviews, many critics singled out Dunst&#x27;s performance for acclaim. Roger Ebert considered her portrayal of Claudia to be one of the &quot;creepier&quot; aspects of the film, and took note of how well she had conveyed the impression of great age inside apparent youth. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; stated that Dunst was &quot;just right&quot; for the family. For her performance, she won the MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance and the Saturn Award for Best Young Actress, in addition to receiving a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.

Later in 1994, Dunst co-starred in the drama film &quot;Little Women&quot; alongside Winona Ryder and Claire Danes. The film was critically acclaimed. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; hailed it as the greatest adaptation of Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s novel of the same name and wrote of Dunst&#x27;s performance:

In 1995, Dunst starred in the fantasy adventure film &quot;Jumanji&quot;, a loose adaptation of Chris Van Allsburg&#x27;s 1981 children&#x27;s book of the same name. The story is about a supernatural and ominous board game in which animals and other jungle hazards appear with each roll of the dice. She was part of an ensemble cast that included Robin Williams, Bonnie Hunt and David Alan Grier. The film was a financial success and grossed worldwide. In that year, and again in 2002, Dunst was named one of &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s 50 Most Beautiful People.
From 1996 to 1997, Dunst had a recurring role in season three of the NBC medical drama &quot;ER&quot;. She played Charlie Chemingo, a child prostitute who was being cared for by the ER pediatrician Dr. Doug Ross (George Clooney). In 1997, she voiced Young Anastasia in the animated musical film &quot;Anastasia&quot;. Also in 1997, Dunst appeared in the black comedy film &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;, opposite Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman. The following year she starred in &quot;Small Soldiers&quot; and voiced the title character in the English Disney/GKIDS dub of Studio Ghibli&#x27;s &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot;. She also starred in Sarah Kernochan&#x27;s period comedy &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot; (1998), playing a student at an all girls&#x27; boarding school in the 1960s, opposite Gaby Hoffmann, Rachael Leigh Cook, and Lynn Redgrave. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, A. O. Scott opined that &quot;the film is surprisingly pleasant, thanks to smart, unstereotyped performances—especially by Hoffmann and Dunst—and the filmmaker&#x27;s evident respect and affection for her characters&quot;.

Dunst starred in &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot;, a 1999 American satirical black comedy mockumentary film about a small town beauty pageant with Ellen Barkin and Allison Janney. She turned down the role of Angela Hayes (played by Mena Suvari) in &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999), because she did not want to appear in the film&#x27;s sexual scenes or kiss the lead character, played by Kevin Spacey. She later explained: &quot;When I read it, I was 15 and I don&#x27;t think I was mature enough to understand the script&#x27;s material.&quot; Dunst co-starred in the comedy film &quot;Dick&quot;, opposite Michelle Williams; it is a parody which retells the events of the Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of former United States president Richard Nixon. Her next film was Sofia Coppola&#x27;s drama &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; (1999), based on Jeffrey Eugenides&#x27; novel of the same name. She played Lux Lisbon, one of the troubled teenage daughters of Ronald Lisbon (James Woods). The film was screened as a special presentation at the 43rd San Francisco International Film Festival in 2000. According to Metacritic, the film received generally favorable reviews. &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; critic Peter Stack noted in his review that Dunst &quot;beautifully balances innocence and wantonness&quot;. Dunst also appeared in Savage Garden&#x27;s music video &quot;I Knew I Loved You&quot;, the first single from their second and final album &quot;Affirmation&quot; (1999).

In 2000, Dunst starred in the comedy &quot;Bring It On&quot; as Torrance Shipman, the captain of a cheerleading squad. The film garnered mostly positive reviews, with many critics reserving praise for her performance. In his review, A. O. Scott called her &quot;a terrific comic actress, largely because of her great expressive range, and the nimbleness with which she can shift from anxiety to aggression to genuine hurt&quot;. Charles Taylor of &quot;Salon&quot; noted that &quot;among contemporary teenage actresses, Dunst has become the sunniest imaginable parodist&quot;, even though he thought the film had failed to provide her with as good a role as she had in either &quot;Dick&quot; or in &quot;The Virgin Suicides.&quot; Jessica Winter of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; praised Dunst, stating that her performance was &quot;as sprightly and knowingly daft as her turn in &quot;Dick&quot;&quot; adding that &quot;[Dunst] provides the only major element of &quot;Bring It On&quot; that plays as tweaking parody rather than slick, strident, body-slam churlishness.&quot; Peter Stack of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, despite giving the film an unfavorable review, commended Dunst for her willingness &quot;to be as silly and cloyingly agreeable as it takes to get through a slapdash film&quot;.

In 2001, Dunst starred in the comedy film &quot;Get Over It&quot;. She later explained that she took the role for the opportunity to showcase her singing. Dunst then co-starred with Jay Hernandez in the coming of age teen romance film &quot;Crazy/Beautiful&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Crazy/Beautiful&quot; […] is an unusually observant film about adolescence,&quot; and &quot;because of the real conviction that Dunst and Hernandez bring to the roles, we care about them as people, not case studies.&quot; She also starred in the historical drama &quot;The Cat&#x27;s Meow&quot;, directed by Peter Bogdanovich, as actress Marion Davies. Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; described the film as &quot;playful and sporty&quot;, deeming this Dunst&#x27;s best performance to date: &quot;Believable as both a spoiled ingenue and a lover to two very different men, Dunst endows a potentially lightweight character with considerable depth and sympathy&quot;. For her performance, she won the Best Actress Silver Ombú award at the 2002 Mar del Plata International Film Festival.

=== 2002–2009: Stardom with &quot;Spider-Man&quot; ===
In 2002, Dunst starred opposite Tobey Maguire in the superhero film &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, the most financially successful film of her career up until this date. She played Mary Jane Watson, the best friend and love interest of Peter Parker (Maguire). The film was directed by Sam Raimi. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; noted Dunst&#x27;s ability to &quot;lend even the smallest line a tickle of flirtatious music&quot;. Writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Kenneth Turan reviewed that Dunst and Maguire made a real connection onscreen, concluding that their relationship &quot;involved audiences to an extent rarely seen in films&quot;. &quot;Spider-Man&quot; was a critical and commercial success. The film grossed during its opening weekend in North America and earned worldwide.

Dunst next co-starred with Billy Bob Thornton, Morgan Freeman and Holly Hunter in the drama &quot;Levity&quot; (2003), a story of a man who is released on parole and returns to his hometown seeking redemption. That same year, she co-starred opposite Julia Roberts, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Julia Stiles in the drama &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot; (2003). The film received mostly negative reviews, with Manohla Dargis of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; describing it as &quot;smug and reductive&quot;. Dunst co-starred as Mary Svevo opposite Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet and Tom Wilkinson in Michel Gondry&#x27;s science fiction romantic comedy-drama &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; (2004). The latter film was critically acclaimed, with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; describing Dunst&#x27;s subplot as &quot;nifty and clever&quot;. The film grossed worldwide.

The success of the first &quot;Spider-Man&quot; led Dunst to reprise her role as Mary Jane Watson in 2004 in &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;. The film was acclaimed by critics and a commercial success, setting a new opening weekend box office record for North America. With box office revenues of worldwide, it was the second highest-grossing film in 2004. Also in 2004, Dunst co-starred opposite Paul Bettany in the romantic comedy &quot;Wimbledon&quot; in which she portrayed a rising tennis player in the Wimbledon Championships, while Bettany portrayed a fading former tennis star. The film received mixed reviews, but many critics enjoyed Dunst&#x27;s performance. Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; observed that the chemistry between Dunst and Bettany was potent, with Dunst doing a &quot;fine job as a sassy and self-assured player&quot;.

In Dunst&#x27;s sole project of 2005, she co-starred opposite Orlando Bloom in Cameron Crowe&#x27;s romantic tragicomedy &quot;Elizabethtown&quot; as flight attendant Claire Colburn. The film premiered at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. Dunst revealed that working with Crowe was enjoyable, but more demanding than she had expected. The film garnered mixed reviews, with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; rating it 1 out of 4 stars and describing Dunst&#x27;s portrayal of a flight attendant as &quot;cloying&quot;. It was also a box office disappointment. After &quot;Elizabethtown&quot;, Dunst collaborated with Sofia Coppola again and starred as Marie Antoinette in the historical drama &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (2006), based on Antonia Fraser&#x27;s book &quot;Marie Antoinette: The Journey&quot;. The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, and was reviewed favorably. The film grossed at the box office from a budget of .

In 2007, Dunst reprised the role of Mary Jane Watson in &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;. In contrast to its predecessors&#x27; rave reviews, &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; received a mixed reaction from critics. Ryan Gilbey of the &quot;New Statesman&quot; was critical of Dunst&#x27;s character, remarking that &quot;the film-makers couldn&#x27;t come up with much for Mary Jane to do other than scream a lot&quot;. Nevertheless, with a worldwide gross of , it stands as the most commercially successful film in the series and Dunst&#x27;s highest-grossing film to the end of 2008. Having initially signed on for three &quot;Spider-Man&quot; films, she said she would consider doing a fourth, but only if Raimi and Maguire returned. In January 2010, it was announced that the fourth film was canceled and that the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film series would be restarted, therefore dropping the trio from the franchise.

Dunst&#x27;s next role was in 2008, in which she co-starred opposite Simon Pegg in the comedy &quot;How to Lose Friends &amp; Alienate People&quot;, based on former &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; contributing editor Toby Young&#x27;s memoir of the same name. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 37%, with the film gaining mostly negative reviews. Robert Wilonsky of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; was critical of Dunst&#x27;s performance, writing she &quot;seems to be speaking in four different accents at once, none of them quite of the English variety&quot;. He added that the film &quot;plays like a made-for-CBS redo of &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;&quot;&quot;.&quot;

=== 2010–2016: Independent films ===
Dunst made her screenwriting and directorial debut with the short film &quot;Bastard&quot;, which she co-wrote with Sasha Sagan. The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2010 and was later featured at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. She co-starred opposite Ryan Gosling in the mystery drama &quot;All Good Things&quot; (2010), based on the true story of New York real estate developer Robert Durst, whose wife disappeared in 1982. The film received fair reviews, but was a commercial failure, earning only worldwide. The critic Roger Ebert praised Dunst for her ability to capture &quot;a woman at a loss to understand who her husband really is, and what the true nature of his family involves&quot;. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; complimented her performance as &quot;the only one worth watching&quot;, despite the film&#x27;s &quot;slow crawl&quot; and lack of suspense. Also in 2010, Dunst co-starred with Brian Geraghty in Carlos Cuarón&#x27;s short film &quot;The Second Bakery Attack&quot;, based on Haruki Murakami&#x27;s short story.

In 2011, Dunst co-starred opposite Charlotte Gainsbourg, Kiefer Sutherland and Charlotte Rampling in Lars von Trier&#x27;s drama film &quot;Melancholia&quot; as a woman suffering depression as the world ends. It premiered at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and received positive reviews, in particular for Dunst&#x27;s performance. Steven Loeb of &quot;Southampton Patch&quot; wrote &quot;This film has brought the best out of von Trier, as well as his star. Dunst is so good in this film, playing a character unlike any other she has ever attempted... Even if the film itself were not the incredible work of art that it is, Dunst&#x27;s performance alone would be incentive enough to recommend it&quot;. Sukhdev Sandhu of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote: &quot;Dunst is exceptional, so utterly convincing in the lead role—trouble, serene, a fierce savant—that it feels like a career breakthrough. Dunst won several awards for her performance, including the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival and the Best Actress Award from the U.S. National Society of Film Critics.

Dunst made a cameo in Beastie Boys&#x27; 2011 music video &quot;Fight For Your Right Revisited&quot; which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. A year later, she starred in Juan Diego Solanas&#x27; science fiction romance &quot;Upside Down&quot; with Jim Sturgess. Described as a &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; story, Peter Howell of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; opined that there was no character development and Dunst &quot;brings competence but no passion to her underwritten roles&quot;. The film&#x27;s consensus on Rotten Tomatoes was also negative, with a 28% approval rating. Next, she had a role in Leslye Headland&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Bachelorette&quot; (2012), starring Isla Fisher, Rebel Wilson and Lizzy Caplan; the film was produced by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay. Dunst plays Regan Crawford, one of three women who reunite for the wedding of a friend who was ridiculed in high school. Dunst appeared in the drama &quot;On the Road&quot; (2012), an adaptation of Jack Kerouac&#x27;s novel of the same name, in which she plays Camille Moriarty. Dunst was first approached for the role by director Walter Salles several years prior. The film premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, and was released in the United States on December 21, 2012. &quot;On the Road&quot; gained mixed reviews and under-performed at the box office. Writing for &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Richard Corliss compared &quot;On the Road&quot; to &quot;a diorama in a Kerouac museum ... [the film] lacks the novel&#x27;s exuberant syncopation&quot;, but praises Dunst&#x27;s performance. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Michael Phillips was more positive, giving the film 3 out of 4 stars, praising the cinematic quality, and actors for their &quot;kind of fluid motion and freedom that periodically makes &quot;On the Road&quot; make sense and makes it feel alive&quot;.

Hossein Amini&#x27;s &quot;The Two Faces of January&quot; (2014) was Dunst&#x27;s next major role, starring alongside Viggo Mortensen and Oscar Isaac. Playing Colette MacFarland, the wife of a con artist, the thriller is based on Patricia Highsmith&#x27;s 1964 novel of the same name. Garnering mostly favorable reviews, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; complimented the 1960s Greek setting and observed Dunst &quot;brings a potent complexity to Colette; every mood shift registers to the bone&quot;. Jake Wilson of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; praised the script for &quot;condensing the book&#x27;s plot while retaining its spirit&quot;, although he thought there was some uneven editing. Of Dunst&#x27;s performance, he called her &quot;typically teasing yet sympathetic&quot;. Finally in 2014, Dunst voiced a character in the eighth episode of &quot;&quot;, and made a guest appearance in an episode of &quot;Portlandia&quot;. Throughout 2015, Dunst focused solely on television work. She was cast as hairdresser Peggy Blumquist in the second season of the critically acclaimed FX crime dark comedy-drama &quot;Fargo&quot;, which earned her nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress and Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie.

In 2016, Dunst co-starred in Jeff Nichols&#x27; science fiction drama &quot;Midnight Special&quot; with Michael Shannon and Joel Edgerton. The story is about a father and his eight-year-old son who go on the run upon discovering that the boy possesses mysterious powers. The film opened to mostly positive reviews; Tim Grierson of &quot;The New Republic&quot; was impressed by &quot;Midnight Special&quot;″s special effects which imitated a late 20th century retro style. However, he questioned the purpose of Dunst&#x27;s character which &quot;simply has nothing to do&quot;. Dunst had a supporting role in the biographical drama &quot;Hidden Figures&quot; (2016), a loose adaptation of the book of the same name, about African-American mathematicians who worked at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) during the Space Race. Dunst&#x27;s portrayal of a white supervisor drew praise from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Elise Nakhnikian, while &quot;The Guardian&quot; thought the film was educational and entertaining despite its underdeveloped supporting cast. The film was a commercial success, grossing worldwide and was nominated for three Academy Awards. The cast also won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. In addition to acting, Dunst served as a member of the main competition jury of the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. In that year, Dunst planned to direct an adaptation of Sylvia Plath&#x27;s novel &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;, starring Dakota Fanning, but stepped down from the project before production.

===2017–present ===
Dunst had two film releases in 2017. She starred alongside Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman and Elle Fanning in the drama &quot;The Beguiled&quot;, which marked her third collaboration with Sofia Coppola, who wrote and directed the film. It is a remake of Don Siegel&#x27;s 1971 film of the same name about a wounded Union soldier who seeks shelter at an all-girls&#x27; school in the Confederate States of America. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 79% approval rating which was &quot;enlivened by strong performances from the cast&quot;. Matthew Norman of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; similarly took note of the &quot;impeccable&quot; acting performances and wrote, &quot;Dunst lends the ideal measure of coiled physical longing to her prim spinster&quot;.

Dunst then starred in the psychological thriller &quot;Woodshock&quot;, written and directed by her friends, Kate and Laura Mulleavy, founders of the Rodarte fashion label. The film is about a woman who falls deeper into paranoia after taking a deadly drug. The Mulleavys&#x27; personally approached Dunst for the lead role, which gave Dunst an &quot;emotional safety net&quot; during filming. She prepared for the role over the course of a year, undertaking dream experiments in order to try to inhabit the character&#x27;s state of mind. Upon release, the film was unpopular with critics. Katie Rife of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; acknowledged the &quot;sophisticated&quot; cinematography but thought &quot;Character development and motivation are practically nonexistent, and the already-thin plot pushes ambiguity to the point of incoherence&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot;″s Guy Lodge shared a similar opinion with the character, writing &quot;Dunst has form in playing irretrievably inverted depression to riveting effect, but the Mulleavys&#x27; script hardly gives her as complex an emotional or intellectual palette to work with&quot;.

In 2019, Dunst starred in the Showtime dark comedy television series &quot;On Becoming a God in Central Florida&quot;, which premiered in August that year. For her role, she was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actress and a Critics Choice Award for Best Actress in a Comedy Series. In September 2019, Showtime renewed the series for a second season, but ultimately canceled it the following year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Dunst co-starred with her partner Jesse Plemons in Jane Campion&#x27;s film &quot;The Power of the Dog&quot; distributed by Netflix, and given a limited theatrical release in the USA on November 17, 2021. She received Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress along with two Critics&#x27; Choice Award nominations (Best Supporting Actress and Best Acting Ensemble).

In 2024, Dunst led the dystopian thriller film &quot;Civil War&quot;, directed by Alex Garland. Her performance was particularly picked up for praise by critics.

==Music career==
In 2001, Dunst made her singing debut in the comedy film &quot;Get Over It&quot;, performing two songs written by Marc Shaiman.

She recorded Henry Creamer and Turner Layton&#x27;s jazz standard &quot;After You&#x27;ve Gone&quot; that was used in the end credits of &quot;The Cat&#x27;s Meow&quot;. In &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;, she sang two songs as Mary Jane Watson, one during a Broadway performance, and one as a singing waitress in a jazz club. Dunst recorded the songs earlier and lip-synced while filming. She appeared in the music videos for Savage Garden&#x27;s &quot;I Knew I Loved You&quot;, Beastie Boys&#x27; &quot;Make Some Noise&quot; and R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;We All Go Back to Where We Belong&quot; and she sang two tracks, &quot;This Old Machine&quot; and &quot;Summer Day&quot;, on Jason Schwartzman&#x27;s 2007 solo album &quot;Nighttiming&quot;. In 2007, Dunst said she had no intention to release albums, saying, &quot;It worked when Barbra Streisand was doing it, but now it&#x27;s a little cheesy, I think. It works better when singers are in movies&quot;.

Dunst starred as the magical princess Majokko in the Takashi Murakami-and-McG-directed short &quot;Akihabara Majokko Princess&quot; singing a cover of The Vapors&#x27; 1980 song &quot;Turning Japanese&quot;. This was shown at the &quot;Pop Life&quot; exhibition in London&#x27;s Tate Modern gallery from October 1, 2009, to January 17, 2010. It shows Dunst dancing around Akihabara, a shopping district in Tokyo, Japan.

==Personal life==
In early 2008, Dunst was treated for depression at the Cirque Lodge treatment center in Utah. In late March 2008, she left the treatment center and began filming &quot;All Good Things&quot;. Two months later, she went public with this information in order to dispel rumors of drug and alcohol abuse, stating, &quot;Now that I&#x27;m feeling stronger, I was prepared to say something. [...] Depression is pretty serious and should not be gossiped about&quot;.

From 2002 to 2004, Dunst was in a relationship with Jake Gyllenhaal. Dunst was in a relationship with her &quot;On the Road&quot; co-star Garrett Hedlund from 2012 to 2016. Dunst and Hedlund were briefly engaged before eventually breaking up. She began a relationship with her &quot;Fargo&quot; co-star Jesse Plemons in 2016 and they became engaged in 2017. Their first son was born in May 2018. In a cover shoot for &quot;W&quot; directed by long-time collaborator Sofia Coppola, she announced that she was pregnant with her second child, and later gave birth to their second son in May 2021. Dunst and Plemons were married in July 2022 at a resort in Ocho Rios, Jamaica.

She now holds dual American and German citizenship.

<text>Kevin Warwick (born 9 February 1954) is an English engineer and Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) at Coventry University. He is known for his studies on direct interfaces between computer systems and the human nervous system, and has also done research concerning robotics.

==Biography==
Kevin Warwick was born in 1954 in Keresley, Coventry, England, and was raised in the nearby village of Ryton-on-Dunsmore, Warwickshire. His family attended a Methodist church but soon he began doubting the existence of God. He attended Lawrence Sheriff School in Rugby, Warwickshire, where he was a contemporary of actor Arthur Bostrom. He left school at the age of 16 to start an apprenticeship with British Telecom. In 1976, he was granted his first degree at Aston University, followed by a PhD degree and a research job at Imperial College London.

He took up positions at Somerville College in Oxford, Newcastle University, the University of Warwick, and the University of Reading, before relocating to Coventry University in 2014.

Warwick is a Chartered Engineer (CEng), a Fellow of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (FIET) and a Fellow of the City and Guilds of London Institute (FCGI). He is Visiting Professor at the Czech Technical University in Prague, the University of Strathclyde, Bournemouth University, and the University of Reading, and in 2004 he was Senior Beckman Fellow at the University of Illinois in the United States. He is also on the Advisory Boards of the Instinctive Computing Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University, and the Centre for Intermedia at the University of Exeter.

By the age of 40, Warwick had been awarded a DSc degree by both Imperial College London and the Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague, for his research output in two entirely unrelated areas. He has received the IET Achievement Medal, the IET Mountbatten Medal, and in 2011 the Ellison-Cliffe Medal from the Royal Society of Medicine. In 2000, Warwick presented the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, entitled &quot;The Rise of Robots&quot;.

==Research==
Warwick performs research in artificial intelligence, biomedical engineering, control systems and robotics. Much of Warwick&#x27;s early research was in the area of discrete time adaptive control. He introduced the first state space based self-tuning controller and unified discrete time state space representations of ARMA models. He has also contributed to mathematics, power engineering and manufacturing production machinery.

===Artificial intelligence===
Warwick directed a research project funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), which investigated the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to suitably stimulate and translate patterns of electrical activity from living cultured neural networks to use the networks for the control of mobile robots. Hence the behaviour process for each robot was effectively provided by a biological brain.

Previously, Warwick helped to develop a genetic algorithm named Gershwyn, which was able to exhibit creativity in producing popular songs, learning what makes a hit record by listening to examples of previous successful songs. Gershwyn appeared on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;, having been successfully used to mix music for Manus, a group consisting of the four younger brothers of Elvis Costello.

Another of Warwick&#x27;s projects involving AI was the robot head, Morgui. The head, which contained five &quot;senses&quot; (vision, sound, infrared, ultrasound and radar), was used to investigate sensor data fusion. It was X-rated by the University of Reading Research and Ethics Committee due to its image storage capabilities—anyone under the age of 18 who wished to interact with the robot had to obtain parental approval.

Warwick has very outspoken opinions about the future, particularly with respect to AI and its effect on the human species. He argues that humanity will need to use technology to enhance itself to avoid being overtaken by machines. He states that many human limitations, such as sensorimotor abilities, can be outperformed by machines, and he has said on record that he wants to gain these abilities: &quot;There is no way I want to stay a mere human.&quot;

===Bioethics===
Warwick directed the University of Reading team in a number of European Community projects such as: FIDIS (Future of Identity in the Information Society), researching the future of identity; and ETHICBOTS and RoboLaw, both of which considered the ethical aspects of robots and cyborgs.

Warwick&#x27;s topics of interest have many ethical implications, some due to his human enhancement experiments. The ethical dilemmas of his research are used by the Institute of Physics as a case study for schoolchildren and science teachers as a part of their formal Advanced level and GCSE studies. His work has also been discussed by the USA President&#x27;s Council on Bioethics and the USA President&#x27;s Panel on Forward Engagements. He is a member of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics Working Party on &quot;Novel Neurotechnologies&quot;.

===Deep brain stimulation===
Along with Tipu Aziz and his team at John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, and John Stein of the University of Oxford, Warwick is helping to design the next generation of deep brain stimulation for Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Instead of stimulating the brain all the time, the goal is for the device to predict when stimulation is needed and to apply the signals prior to any tremors occurring, thereby stopping tremors before they start. Recent results have also shown that it is possible to identify different types of Parkinson&#x27;s Disease.

===Public awareness===
Warwick has directed a number of projects intended to interest schoolchildren in the technology with which he is involved. In 2000, he received the EPSRC Millennium Award for his Schools Robot League. In 2007, 16 school teams were involved in a project to design a humanoid robot to dance and then complete an assault course, with the final competition staged at the Science Museum, London. The project, entitled &#x27;Androids Advance&#x27; was funded by EPSRC and was presented as a news item by Chinese television.

Warwick contributes significantly to the public understanding of science by giving regular public lectures, participating with radio programmes, and through popular writing. He has appeared in numerous television documentary programmes on AI, robotics and the role of science fiction in science, such as &quot;How William Shatner Changed the World&quot;, &quot;Future Fantastic&quot; and &quot;Explorations&quot;. He also appeared in the Ray Kurzweil-inspired movie &quot;Transcendent Man&quot; along with William Shatner, Colin Powell, and Stevie Wonder. He has guested on several television talk shows, including &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, &quot;Først &amp; sist&quot;, &quot;Sunday Brunch&quot; and &quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot;. He has appeared on the cover of a number of magazines, for example the February 2000 edition of &quot;Wired&quot;.

In 2005, Warwick was the subject of an early day motion tabled by members of the UK Parliament, in which he was congratulated for his work in attracting students to science and for teaching &quot;in a way that makes the subject interesting and relevant so that more students will want to develop a career in science.&quot;

In 2009, Warwick was interviewed about his work in cybernetics for two documentary features on the DVD release of the 1985 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;Attack of the Cybermen&quot;. He was also an interview subject for the televised lecture &quot;The Science of Doctor Who&quot; in 2013.

In 2013, Warwick appeared as a guest on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Museum of Curiosity&quot; with Robert Llewellyn and Cleo Rocos. In 2014, he appeared on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Midweek&quot; with Libby Purves, Roger Bannister and Rachael Stirling.

===Robotics===
Warwick&#x27;s claims that robots can program themselves to avoid each other while operating in a group raise the issue of self-organisation. In particular, the works of Francisco Varela and Humberto Maturana, once purely speculative have now become immediately relevant with respect to synthetic intelligence.

Cyborg-type systems, if they are to survive, need to be not only homeostatic (meaning that they are able to preserve stable internal conditions in various environments) but also adaptive. Testing the claims of Varela and Maturana using synthetic devices is the more serious concern in the discussion about Warwick and those involved in similar research. &quot;Pulling the plug&quot; on independent devices cannot be as simple as it appears, because if the device displays sufficient intelligence, and assumes a diagnostic and prognostic stature, we may ultimately one day be forced to decide between what it could be telling us as counterintuitive (but correct) and our impulse to disconnect because of our limited and &quot;intuitive&quot; perceptions.

Warwick&#x27;s robots seemed to exhibit behaviour not anticipated by the research, one such robot &quot;committing suicide&quot; because it could not cope with its environment. In a more complex setting, it may be asked whether a &quot;natural selection&quot; might be possible, neural networks being the major operative.

The 1999 edition of the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; recorded that Warwick performed the first robot learning experiment using the Internet. One robot, with an artificial neural network brain at the University of Reading in the UK, learned how to move around without bumping into things. It then taught, via the Internet, another robot at SUNY Buffalo in New York State to behave in the same way. The robot in the US was therefore not taught or programmed by a human, but rather by another robot based on what it had itself learnt.

Hissing Sid was a robot cat that Warwick took on a British Council lecture tour of Russia, where he presented it in lectures at such places as Moscow State University. The robot was put together as a student project; its name came from the noise made by the pneumatic actuators used to drive its legs when walking. Hissing Sid also appeared on BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Blue Peter&quot; but became more well known when it was refused a ticket by British Airways on the grounds that they did not allow animals in the cabin.

Warwick was also responsible for a robotic &quot;magic chair&quot; (based on the SCARA-form UMI RTX arm) used on BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Jim&#x27;ll Fix It&quot;. The chair provided the show&#x27;s host Jimmy Savile with tea and stored Jim&#x27;ll Fix It badges for him to hand out to guests. Warwick appeared on the programme himself for a Fix-it involving robots.

Warwick was also involved in the development of the &quot;Seven Dwarves&quot; robots, a version of which was sold in kit form as &quot;Cybot&quot; on the cover of &quot;Real Robots&quot; magazine in 2001. The magazine series guided its readers through the stages of building and programming Cybot, an artificially intelligent robot capable of making its own decisions and thinking for itself.

===Project Cyborg===
Probably the most famous research undertaken by Warwick—and the origin of the nickname &quot;Captain Cyborg&quot; given to him by &quot;The Register&quot;—is the set of experiments known as Project Cyborg, in which an array was implanted into his arm, with the goal of him &quot;becoming a cyborg&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1001/archneur.60.10.1369|noedit&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The first stage of Project Cyborg, which began on 24 August 1998, involved a simple RFID transmitter being implanted beneath Warwick&#x27;s skin, which was used to control doors, lights, heaters, and other computer-controlled devices based on his proximity. He explained that the main purpose of this experiment was to test the limits of what the body would accept, and how easy it would be to receive a meaningful signal from the microprocessor.

The second stage of the research involved a more complex neural interface, designed and built especially for the experiment by Dr. Mark Gasson and his team at the University of Reading. This device consisted of a BrainGate sensor, a silicon square about 3mm wide, connected to an external &quot;gauntlet&quot; that housed supporting electronics. It was implanted under local anaesthetic on 14 March 2002 at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford, where it was interfaced directly into Warwick&#x27;s nervous system via the median nerve in his left wrist. The microelectrode array that was inserted contained 100 electrodes, each the width of a human hair, of which 25 could be accessed at any one time, whereas the nerve that was being monitored carries many times that number of signals. The experiment proved successful, and the output signals were detailed enough to enable a robot arm, developed by Warwick&#x27;s colleague Dr. Peter Kyberd, to mimic the actions of Warwick&#x27;s own arm.

By means of the implant, Warwick&#x27;s nervous system was connected to the Internet at Columbia University, New York. From there he was able to control the robot arm at the University of Reading and obtain feedback from sensors in the finger tips. He also successfully connected ultrasonic sensors on a baseball cap and experienced a form of extrasensory input.

In a highly publicised extension to the experiment, a simpler array was implanted into the arm of Warwick&#x27;s wife, with the ultimate aim of one day creating a form of telepathy or empathy using the Internet to communicate the signal over huge distances. This experiment resulted in the first direct and purely electronic communication between the nervous systems of two humans. Finally, the effect of the implant on Warwick&#x27;s hand function was measured using the University of Southampton&#x27;s Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP). There was a fear that directly interfacing with the nervous system might cause some form of damage or interference, but no measurable side effect (nor any sign of rejection) was encountered.

====Implications====
Warwick and his colleagues claim that the Project Cyborg research could result in new medical tools for treating patients with damage to the nervous system, as well as assisting the more ambitious enhancements Warwick advocates. Some transhumanists even speculate that similar technologies could be used for technology-facilitated telepathy.

===Tracking device===
A controversy began in August 2002, shortly after the Soham murders, when Warwick reportedly offered to implant a tracking device into an 11-year-old girl as an anti-abduction measure. The plan produced a mixed reaction, with endorsement from many worried parents but ethical concerns from children&#x27;s societies. As a result, the idea did not go ahead.

Anti-theft RFID chips are common in jewellery or clothing in some Latin American countries due to a high abduction rate, and the company VeriChip announced plans in 2001 to expand its line of available medical information implants, to be GPS trackable when combined with a separate GPS device.

===Turing test===
Warwick participated as a &quot;Turing Interrogator&quot; on two occasions, judging machines in the 2001 and 2006 Loebner Prize competitions, platforms for an &quot;imitation game&quot; as devised by Alan Turing. The 2001 Prize, held at the London Science Museum, featured Turing&#x27;s &quot;jury service&quot; or one-to-one Turing tests and was won by A.L.I.C.E. The 2006 contest staged &quot;parallel-paired&quot; Turing tests at University College London and the winner was Rollo Carpenter. Warwick co-organised the 2008 Loebner Prize at the University of Reading, which also featured parallel-paired Turing tests.

In 2012, he co-organised with Huma Shah a series of Turing tests held at Bletchley Park. According to Warwick, the tests strictly adhered to the statements made by Alan Turing in his papers. Warwick himself participated in the tests as a hidden human. Results of the tests were discussed in a number of academic papers. One paper, entitled &quot;Human Misidentification in Turing Tests&quot;, became one of the top three most-downloaded papers in the &quot;Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence&quot;.

In June 2014, Warwick helped Shah stage a series of Turing tests to mark the 60th anniversary of Alan Turing&#x27;s death. The event was performed at the Royal Society, London. Warwick regarded the winning chatbot, &quot;Eugene Goostman&quot;, as having &quot;passed the Turing test for the first time&quot; by fooling a third of the event&#x27;s judges into making an incorrect identification, and termed this a &quot;milestone&quot;. A paper containing all of the transcripts involving Eugene Goostman entitled &quot;Can Machines Think? A Report on Turing Test Experiments at the Royal Society&quot;, has also become one of the top three most-downloaded papers in the &quot;Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence&quot;.

Warwick was criticised in the context of the 2014 Royal Society event, where he claimed that software program Eugene Goostman had passed the Turing test on the basis of its performance. The software successfully convinced over 30% of the judges who could not identify it as being a machine, on the basis of a five-minute text chat. Critics stated that the software&#x27;s claim of being a young non-native English speaker weakened the spirit of the test, as any grammatical and semantic inconsistencies could be excused as a consequence of limited proficiency in the English language. Some critics also claimed that the software&#x27;s performance had been exceeded by other programs in the past. However, the 2014 tests were entirely unrestricted in terms of discussion topics, whereas the previous tests referenced by the critics had been limited to very specific subject areas. Additionally, Warwick was criticised by editor and entrepreneur Mike Masnick for exaggerating the significance of the Eugene Goostman program to the press.

==Other work==
Warwick was a member of the 2001 Higher Education Funding Council for England (unit 29) Research Assessment Exercise panel on Electrical and Electronic Engineering and was Deputy chairman for the same panel (unit 24) in 2008. In March 2009, he was cited as being the inspiration of National Young Scientist of the Year, Peter Hatfield.

===Royal Institution Christmas Lectures===
Warwick presented the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures in December 2000, entitled &quot;Rise of the Robots&quot;. Although the lectures were well received by some, British computer scientist Simon Colton complained about the choice of Warwick prior to his appearance. He claimed that Warwick &quot;is not a spokesman for our subject&quot; (Artificial Intelligence) and &quot;allowing him influence through the Christmas lectures is a danger to the public perception of science&quot;. In response to Warwick&#x27;s claims that computers could be creative, Colton, who is a Professor of Computational Creativity, also said: &quot;the AI community has done real science to reclaim words such as creativity and emotion which they claim computers will never have&quot;. Subsequent letters were generally positive; Ralph Rayner wrote: &quot;With my youngest son, I attended all of the lectures and found them balanced and thought-provoking. They were not sensationalist. I applaud Warwick for his lectures&quot;.

==Awards and recognition==
Warwick received the Future Health Technology Award in 2000, and was presented with the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) Achievement Medal in 2004. In 2008, he was awarded the Mountbatten Medal. In 2009 he received the Marcellin Champagnat award from Universidad Marista Guadalajara and the Golden Eurydice Award. In 2011 he received the Ellison-Cliffe Medal from the Royal Society of Medicine. In 2014, he was elected to the membership of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts. In 2018 Warwick was inducted into the International Academy for Systems and Cybernetic Sciences and in 2020 he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the Cybernetics Society.

He is the recipient of ten honorary doctorates, these being from Aston University, Coventry University, Robert Gordon University, Bradford University, University of Bedfordshire, Portsmouth University, Kingston University, Ss. Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje, Edinburgh Napier University, and Galgotias University.

==Reception==
Warwick has both his critics and endorsers, some of whom describe him as a &quot;maverick&quot;. Others see his work as &quot;not very scientific&quot; and more like &quot;entertainment&quot;, whereas some regard him as &quot;an extraordinarily creative experimenter&quot;, his presentations as &quot;awesome&quot; and his work as &quot;profound&quot;.

<text>Kansas City, Missouri (KC or KCMO) is the largest city in the U.S. state of Missouri by population and area. The city lies within Jackson, Clay, Platte counties, and a small portion in Cass County. It is the central city of the Kansas City metropolitan area, which straddles the Missouri–Kansas state line and has a population of 2,392,035. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 508,090, making it the 38th most-populous city in the United States, as well as the sixth-most populous city in the Midwest. Kansas City was founded in the 1830s as a port on the Missouri River at its confluence with the Kansas River from the west. On June 1, 1850, the town of Kansas was incorporated; shortly after came the establishment of the Kansas Territory. Confusion between the two ensued, and the name Kansas City was assigned to distinguish them soon after.

Sitting on Missouri&#x27;s western boundary with Kansas, with downtown near the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, the city encompasses about , making it the 25th largest city by total area in the United States. It is one of Jackson County&#x27;s two seats along with the major satellite city of Independence; and its other major Missouri suburbs include Blue Springs, Lee&#x27;s Summit, Raytown, and Liberty. Its major Kansas suburbs include Overland Park, Olathe, Lenexa, and Kansas City, Kansas.

The city is composed of several neighborhoods, including the River Market District, 18th and Vine District, and the Country Club Plaza. Celebrated cultural traditions include Kansas City jazz; theater, as a historical center of the Vaudevillian Orpheum circuit in the 1920s; the nickname City of Fountains; the Chiefs and Royals sports franchises; and cuisine such as Kansas City–style barbecue and strip steak.
==History==
The town of Kansas, Missouri, was incorporated on June 1, 1850, reincorporated and renamed City of Kansas on March 28, 1853, and renamed Kansas City in 1889. The area straddles the border between Missouri and Kansas at the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers, and was considered a good place to settle.

The Antioch Christian Church, Dr. James Compton House, and Woodneath are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Exploration and settlement===

In past centuries, the area&#x27;s tribal inhabitants include the Hopewell tradition, Mississippian culture, Kansa, Osage, Otoe, and Missouri. The first documented European visitor to the eventual site of Kansas City was Étienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont, who was also the first European to explore the lower Missouri River. Criticized for his response to the Native American attack on Fort Détroit, he had deserted his post as fort commander and was avoiding French authorities. Bourgmont lived with a Native American wife in a village about east near Brunswick, Missouri, where he illegally traded furs.

To clear his name, he wrote &quot;Exact Description of Louisiana, of Its Harbors, Lands and Rivers, and Names of the Indian Tribes That Occupy It, and the Commerce and Advantages to Be Derived Therefrom for the Establishment of a Colony&quot; in 1713 and &quot;The Route to Be Taken to Ascend the Missouri River&quot; in 1714. In the documents, he describes the junction of the &quot;Grande Riv[ière] des Cansez&quot; and Missouri River, as the first adoption of those names. French cartographer Guillaume Delisle used the descriptions to make the area&#x27;s first reasonably accurate map.

The Spanish took over the region in the Treaty of Paris in 1763, but were not to play a major role other than taxing and licensing Missouri River ship traffic. The French continued their fur trade under Spanish license. The Chouteau family operated under Spanish license at St. Louis, in the lower Missouri Valley as early as 1765 and in 1821 the Chouteaus reached Kansas City, where François Chouteau established Chouteau&#x27;s Landing.

===After the Louisiana Purchase (1803)===
After the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, Lewis and Clark visited the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers, noting it was a good place to build a fort. In 1831, a group of Mormons from New York state led by Joseph Smith settled in the area. They built the first school within what became Kansas City, but were forced out by mob violence in 1833.

In 1831, Gabriel Prudhomme Sr., a Canadian trapper and partner of François Chouteau, purchased fronting the Missouri River. He established a home for his wife, Josephine, and six children. He operated a ferry on the river.

In 1833, John McCoy, son of Baptist missionary Isaac McCoy and brother-in-law of Johnston Lykins, established West Port along the Santa Fe Trail, south of the river. In 1834, McCoy established Westport Landing on a bend in the Missouri to serve as a landing point for West Port, with Lykins as the first postmaster. He found it more convenient to have his goods offloaded at the Prudhomme landing next to Chouteau&#x27;s landing than in Independence. Several years after Gabriel Prudhomme&#x27;s death, a group of fourteen investors purchased his land at auction on November 14, 1838. By 1839, the investors divided the property and the first lots were sold in 1846 after legal complications were settled. The remaining lots were sold by February 1850.

In 1850, the landing area was incorporated as the town of Kansas, Missouri. By that time, the towns of Kansas, Westport, and nearby Independence, had become critical points in the westward expansion of the United States. Three major trails – the Santa Fe, California, and Oregon – all passed through Jackson County.

On February 22, 1853, Kansas was reincorporated and renamed the City of Kansas with its first elected mayor, William Samuel Gregory. Due to a legal discovery of living outside city boundaries, he was soon succeeded by Johnston Lykins as the second (but first legally elected) mayor. The city had an area of and a population of 2,500. The boundary lines extended from the middle of the Missouri River south to what is now Ninth Street, and from Bluff Street on the west to a point between Holmes Road and Charlotte Street on the east.

===American Civil War===

During the Civil War, the city and its immediate surroundings were the focus of intense military activity. Although the First Battle of Independence in August 1862 resulted in a Confederate States Army victory, the Confederates were unable to leverage their win in any significant fashion, as Kansas City was occupied by Union troops and proved too heavily fortified to assault. The Second Battle of Independence, which occurred on October 21–22, 1864, as part of Sterling Price&#x27;s Missouri expedition of 1864, also resulted in a Confederate triumph. Once again their victory proved hollow, as Price was decisively defeated in the pivotal Battle of Westport the next day, effectively ending Confederate efforts to regain Missouri.

General Thomas Ewing, in response to a successful raid on nearby Lawrence, Kansas, led by William Quantrill, issued General Order No. 11, forcing the eviction of residents in four western Missouri counties – including Jackson – except those living in the city and nearby communities and those whose allegiance to the Union was certified by Ewing.

===After Civil War===

After the Civil War, Kansas City grew rapidly. The selection of the city over Leavenworth, Kansas, for the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad bridge over the Missouri River brought significant growth. The population exploding after 1869, when Hannibal Bridge, designed by Octave Chanute, opened. The boom prompted a name change to Kansas City in 1889, and the city limits to be extended south and east. Westport became part of Kansas City on December 2, 1897. In 1900, Kansas City was the 22nd largest city in the country, with a population of 163,752 residents.

Landscape architect George Kessler shaped Kansas City into a leading example of the City Beautiful movement, with a network of boulevards and parks. New neighborhoods like Southmoreland and the Rockhill District were conceived to accommodate the city&#x27;s largest residencies of palatial proportions.

The obsolescence of Union Depot in West Bottoms in favor of the new Union Station in 1914, and the opening of the Liberty Memorial in 1923, provided two of the city&#x27;s most identifiable landmarks. Robert A. Long, president of the Liberty Memorial Association, was a driving force in the funding for construction. Long was a longtime resident and wealthy businessman. He built the R.A. Long Building for the Long-Bell Lumber Company, his home, Corinthian Hall (now the Kansas City Museum) and Longview Farm.

Further spurring Kansas City&#x27;s growth was the opening of the innovative Country Club Plaza development by J.C. Nichols in 1925, as part of his Country Club District plan.

====20th century streetcar system====
The Kansas City streetcar system once had hundreds of miles of streetcars running through the city and was one of the largest systems in the country. In 1903 the 8th Street Tunnel was built as an underground streetcar system through the city. The last run of the streetcar was on June 23, 1957, but the tunnel still exists.

===Pendergast era===
At the start of the 20th century, political machines gained clout in the city, with the one led by Tom Pendergast dominating the city by 1925. Several important buildings and structures were built during this time, including the Kansas City City Hall and the Jackson County Courthouse. During this time, he aided one of his nephew&#x27;s friends, Harry S. Truman, in a political career. Truman eventually became a senator, then vice president, then president. The machine fell in 1939 when Pendergast, riddled with health problems, pleaded guilty to tax evasion after long federal investigations. His biographers have summed up his uniqueness:

====Troost redlining and white flight====
Troost Avenue was once the eastern edge of Kansas City, Missouri and a residential corridor nicknamed Millionaire Row. It is now widely seen as one of the city&#x27;s most prominent racial and economic dividing lines due to urban decay, which was caused by white flight. During the civil rights era the city blocked people of color from moving to homes west of Troost Avenue, causing the areas east of Troost to have one of the worst murder rates in the country. This led to the dominating economic success of neighboring Johnson County.

In 1950, African Americans represented 12.2% of Kansas City&#x27;s population. The city&#x27;s most populous ethnic group, non-Hispanic whites, declined from 89.5% in 1930 to 54.9% in 2010.

In 1940, the city had about 400,000 residents; by 2000, it had about 440,000. From 1940 to 1960, the city more than doubled its physical size, while increasing its population by only about 75,000. By 1970, the city covered approximately , more than five times its size in 1940. Aggressively annexing the surrounding suburbs and undeveloped land spared Kansas City from the severe population loss suffered by cities like St. Louis and Detroit, similar cities which both lost over 50% of their population in the postwar era. In the most neglected neighborhoods, however, the same pattern of abandonment occurred and left behind massive numbers of vacant lots and abandoned homes, especially in the areas east of Troost.

====Hyatt Regency walkway collapse====
The Hyatt Regency walkway collapse was a major disaster that occurred on July 17, 1981, killing 114 people and injuring more than 200 others during a tea dance in the 45-story Hyatt Regency hotel in Crown Center. It is the deadliest structural collapse in US history other than the September 11 attacks. In 2015 a memorial called the Skywalk Memorial Plaza was built for the families of the victims of the disaster, across the street from the hotel which is now a Sheraton.

===21st century===
====Downtown Kansas City re-development====

In the 21st century, the Kansas City area has undergone extensive redevelopment, with more than $6 billion in improvements to the downtown area on the Missouri side. One of the main goals is to attract convention and tourist dollars, office workers, and residents to downtown KCMO. Among the projects include the redevelopment of the Power &amp; Light District into a retail and entertainment district; and the Sprint Center, an 18,500-seat arena that opened in 2007, funded by a 2004 ballot initiative involving a tax on car rentals and hotels, designed to meet the stadium specifications for a possible future NBA or NHL franchise, and was renamed T-Mobile Center in 2020; Kemper Arena, which was functionally superseded by Sprint Center, fell into disrepair and was sold to private developers. By 2018, the arena was being converted to a sports complex under the name Hy-Vee Arena. The Kauffman Performing Arts Center opened in 2011 providing a new, modern home to the KC Orchestra and Ballet. In 2015, an 800-room Hyatt Convention Center Hotel was announced for a site next to the Performance Arts Center &amp; Bartle Hall. Construction was scheduled to start in early 2018 with Loews as the operator.

From 2007 to 2017, downtown residential population in Kansas City quadrupled and continues to grow. The area has grown from almost 4,000 residents in the early 2000s to nearly 30,000 . Kansas City&#x27;s downtown ranks as the sixth-fastest-growing downtown in America with the population expected to grow by more than 40% by 2022. Conversions of office buildings such as the Power &amp; Light Building and the Commerce Bank Tower into residential and hotel space has helped to fulfill the demand. New apartment complexes like One, Two, and Three Lights, River Market West, and 503 Main have begun to reshape Kansas City&#x27;s skyline. Strong demand has led to occupancy rates in the upper 90%.

The residential population of downtown has boomed, and the office population has dropped significantly from the early 2000s to the mid-2010s. Top employers like AMC moved their operations to modern office buildings in the suburbs. High office vacancy plagued downtown, leading to the neglect of many office buildings. By the mid-2010s, many office buildings were converted to residential uses and the Class A vacancy rate plunged to 12% in 2017. Swiss Re, Virgin Mobile, AutoAlert, and others have begun to move operations to downtown Kansas City from the suburbs and expensive coastal cities.

====Transportation developments====
The area has seen additional development through various transportation projects, including improvements to the Grandview Triangle, which intersects Interstates 435 and 470, and U.S. Route 71.

In July 2005, the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority (KCATA) launched Kansas City&#x27;s first bus rapid transit line, the Metro Area Express (MAX), which links the River Market, downtown, Union Station, Crown Center and the Country Club Plaza. The KCATA continues to expand MAX with additional routes on Prospect Avenue, Troost Avenue, and Independence Avenue.

In 2013, construction began on a two-mile streetcar line in downtown Kansas City (funded by a $102 million ballot initiative that was passed in 2012) that runs between the River Market and Union Station, it began operation in May 2016. In 2017, voters approved the formation of a TDD to expand the streetcar line south 3.5 miles from Union Station to UMKC&#x27;s Volker Campus. Additionally in 2017, the KC Port Authority began engineering studies for a Port Authority funded streetcar expansion north to Berkley Riverfront Park. Citywide, voter support for rail projects continues to grow with numerous light rail projects in the works.

In 2016, Jackson County, Missouri, acquired unused rail lines as part of a long-term commuter rail plan. For the time being, the line is being converted to a trail while county officials negotiate with railroads for access to tracks in downtown Kansas City.

On November 7, 2017, Kansas City voters overwhelmingly approved a new single terminal at Kansas City International Airport by a 75% to 25% margin. The new single terminal replaced the three existing &quot;Clover Leafs&quot; at KCI Airport on February 28, 2023.

==Geography==

The city has an area of , of which, is land and is water. Bluffs overlook the rivers and river bottom areas. Kansas City proper is bowl-shaped and is surrounded to the north and south by glacier-carved limestone and bedrock cliffs.

===Performing arts===
In 1886, Kansas City had only two theaters when David Austin Latchaw, originally from rural Pennsylvania, moved there. Latchaw maintained friendly relations with several actors such as Otis Skinner, Richard Mansfield, Maude Adams, Margaret Anglin, John Drew, Minnie Maddern Fiske, Julia Marlowe, E. H. Sothern, and Robert Mantell.

Theater troupes in the 1870s toured the state, performing in cities or small towns forming along the railroad lines. Rail transport had enhanced the theater troupe tour market, by allowing full costumes, props, and sets. As theater grew in popularity after the mid-1880s, that number increased and by 1912, ten new theaters had been built in Kansas City. By the 1920s, Kansas City was the center of the vaudevillian Orpheum circuit.

Kansas City jazz in the 1930s marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. The 1979 documentary &quot;The Last of the Blue Devils&quot; portrays this era in interviews and performances by local jazz notables. In the 1970s, Kansas City attempted to resurrect the glory of the jazz era in a family-friendly atmosphere.

===Cuisine===

Kansas City is famous for its steak and Kansas City-style barbecue. During the heyday of the Kansas City Stockyards, the city was known for its Kansas City steaks or Kansas City strip steaks. The most famous of its steakhouses is the Golden Ox in the Kansas City Live Stock Exchange in the West Bottoms stockyards. These stockyards were second only to those of Chicago in size, but they never recovered from the Great Flood of 1951 and eventually closed. Jess &amp; Jim&#x27;s Steakhouse was founded in 1938 in the Martin City neighborhood.

The Kansas City Strip cut of steak is similar to the New York Strip cut, and is sometimes referred to just as a strip steak. Along with Texas, Memphis, North Carolina, and South Carolina, Kansas City is lauded as a &quot;world capital of barbecue&quot;. More than 90 barbecue restaurants operate in the metropolitan area. The American Royal each fall hosts what it claims is the world&#x27;s biggest barbecue contest.
Classic Kansas City-style barbecue was an inner-city phenomenon that evolved from the pit of Henry Perry, a migrant from Memphis who is generally credited with opening the city&#x27;s first barbecue stand in 1921, and blossomed in the 18th and Vine neighborhood. Arthur Bryant&#x27;s took over the Perry restaurant and added sugar to his sauce to sweeten the recipe a bit. In 1946 one of Perry&#x27;s cooks, George W. Gates, opened Gates Bar-B-Q, later Gates and Sons Bar-B-Q when his son Ollie joined the family business. Bryant&#x27;s and Gates are the two definitive Kansas City barbecue restaurants; native Kansas Citian and essayist Calvin Trillin famously called Bryant&#x27;s &quot;the single best restaurant in the world&quot; in an essay he wrote for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine in the 1960s. Fiorella&#x27;s Jack Stack Barbecue is also well regarded. In 1977, Rich Davis, a psychiatrist, test-marketed his own concoction called K.C. Soul Style Barbecue Sauce. He renamed it KC Masterpiece, and in 1986, he sold the recipe to the Kingsford division of Clorox. Davis retained rights to operate restaurants using the name and sauce, whose recipe popularized the use of molasses as a sweetener in Kansas City-style barbecue sauces.

Kansas City has several James Beard Award-winning/nominated chefs and restaurants. Winning chefs include Michael Smith, Celina Tio, Colby Garrelts, Debbie Gold, Jonathan Justus and Martin Heuser.

==Law and government==

===City government===

Kansas City is home to the largest municipal government in the state of Missouri. The city has a council/manager form of government. The role of city manager has diminished over the years. The non-elective office of city manager was created following excesses during the Pendergast days.

The mayor is the head of the Kansas City City Council, which has 12 members elected from six districts (one member elected by voters in the district and one at-large member elected by voters citywide). The mayor is the presiding member. By charter, Kansas City has a &quot;weak-mayor&quot; system, in which most of the power is formally vested in the city council. However, in practice, the mayor is very influential in drafting and guiding public policy.

Kansas City holds city elections in every fourth odd-numbered year. The last citywide election was held in April 2023. The officials took office in August 2023 and will hold the position until 2027.

Pendergast was the most prominent leader during the machine politics days. The most nationally prominent Democrat associated with the machine was Harry S Truman, who became a Senator, Vice President and then President of the United States from 1945 to 1953. Kansas City is the seat of the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, one of two federal district courts in Missouri. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri is in St. Louis. It also is the seat of the Western District of the Missouri Court of Appeals, one of three districts of that court (the Eastern District is in St. Louis and the Southern District is in Springfield).

The Mayor, City Council, and City Manager are listed below:

===National political conventions===
Kansas City hosted the 1900 Democratic National Convention, the 1928 Republican National Convention and the 1976 Republican National Convention. The urban core of Kansas City consistently votes Democratic in presidential elections; however, on the state and local level Republicans often find success, especially in the Northland and other suburban areas of Kansas City.

===Federal representation===
Kansas City is represented by three members of the United States House of Representatives:
*Missouri&#x27;s 4th congressional district – the Cass County portion of Kansas City; represented by Mark Alford (Republican)
*Missouri&#x27;s 5th congressional district – all of Kansas City proper in Jackson County, Independence, and portions of Clay County; represented by Emanuel Cleaver (Democrat)
*Missouri&#x27;s 6th congressional district – Portions of Kansas City proper in Clay County and Platte County; represented by Sam Graves (Republican)

===Crime===

Some of the earliest organized violence in Kansas City was during the American Civil War. Shortly after the city&#x27;s incorporation in 1850, so-called Bleeding Kansas erupted, affecting border ruffians and Jayhawkers. During the war, Union troops burned all occupied dwellings in Jackson County south of Brush Creek and east of Blue Creek to Independence in an attempt to halt raids into Kansas. After the war, the &quot;Kansas City Times&quot; turned outlaw Jesse James into a folk hero via its coverage. James was born in the Kansas City metro area at Kearney, Missouri, and notoriously robbed the Kansas City Fairgrounds at 12th Street and Campbell Avenue.

In the early 20th century under Pendergast, Kansas City became the country&#x27;s &quot;most wide open town&quot;. Though this gave rise to Kansas City jazz and to the Kansas City mob (initially under Johnny Lazia), and the arrival of organized crime. In the 1970s, the Kansas City mob was involved in a gang war over control of the River Quay entertainment district, in which three buildings were bombed and several gangsters were killed. Police investigations gained after boss Nick Civella was recorded discussing gambling bets on Super Bowl IV (where the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Minnesota Vikings). The war and investigation led to the end of mob control of the Stardust Casino, which was the basis for the 1995 film &quot;Casino&quot;, though the production minimizes the Kansas City connections.

, Kansas City ranked 18th on the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)&#x27;s annual survey of crime rates for cities with populations over 100,000. Much of the city&#x27;s violent crime occurs on the city&#x27;s lower income East Side. Revitalizing the downtown and midtown areas has been fairly successful and now these areas have below average violent crime compared to other major downtowns. According to a 2007 analysis by &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; and the University of Missouri-Kansas City, downtown experienced the largest drop in crime of any neighborhood in the city during the 2000s.

==Education==
===Colleges and universities===
Many universities, colleges, and seminaries are in the Kansas City metropolitan area, including:

* University of Missouri–Kansas City − one of four schools in the University of Missouri System, serving more than 15,000 students

* Nazarene Theological Seminary − Church of the Nazarene
* Calvary University
* Saint Paul School of Theology − Methodist

===Primary and secondary schools===

The city is not served by one unified school district, but 15 separate districts due to the historical unwillingness of suburban voters to merge their existing school districts with the Kansas City district as the city expanded its limits in the 1950s and 1960s.

School outcomes vary between and even within districts, with a some high schools being nationally ranked, and others having some of the lowest graduation rates. There are also numerous private schools; Catholic schools are governed by the Diocese of Kansas City.

The following public school districts serve Kansas City:

In the Jackson County portion of the city:
* Kansas City Public Schools

==Media==

===Print media===
&quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; is the area&#x27;s primary newspaper. William Rockhill Nelson and his partner, Samuel Morss, first published the evening paper on September 18, 1880. The &quot;Star&quot; competed with the morning &quot;Kansas City Times&quot; before acquiring that publication in 1901. The &quot;Times&quot; name was discontinued in March 1990, when the morning paper was renamed the &quot;Star&quot;.

Weekly newspapers include &quot;The Call&quot; (which is focused toward Kansas City&#x27;s African-American community), the &quot;Kansas City Business Journal&quot;, &quot;The Pitch&quot;, &quot;Ink&quot;, and the bilingual publications &quot;Dos Mundos&quot; and &quot;KC Hispanic News&quot;.

Publications include &quot;Ingram&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and a local society journal, the &quot;Independent&quot;.

The city is served by two major faith-oriented newspapers: The &quot;Kansas City Metro Voice&quot;, serving the Christian community, and the &quot;Kansas City Jewish Chronicle&quot;, serving the Jewish community. It is the headquarters of the &quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot;, an independent Catholic newspaper.

===Broadcast media===
The Kansas City media market (ranked 32nd by Arbitron and 31st by Nielsen) includes 10 television stations, 30 FM and 21 AM radio stations. Kansas City broadcasting jobs have been a stepping stone for national television and radio personalities, notably Walter Cronkite and Mancow Muller.

WDAF radio (now at 106.5 FM; original 610 AM frequency now occupied by KFNZ) signed on in 1927 as an affiliate of the NBC Red Network, under the ownership of &quot;The Star.&quot; In 1949, the &quot;Star&quot; signed on WDAF-TV as an affiliate of the NBC television network. The &quot;Star&quot; sold off the WDAF stations in 1957, following an antitrust investigation by the United States government (reportedly launched at Truman&#x27;s behest, following a long-standing feud with the &quot;Star&quot;) over the newspaper&#x27;s ownership of television and radio stations. KCMO radio (originally at 810 AM, now at 710 AM) signed on KCMO-TV (now KCTV) in 1953. The respective owners of WHB (then at 710 AM, now at 810 AM) and KMBC radio (980 AM, now KMBZ), Cook Paint and Varnish Company and the Midland Broadcasting Company, signed on WHB-TV/KMBC-TV as a time-share arrangement on VHF channel 9 in 1953; KMBC-TV took over channel 9 full-time in June 1954, after Cook Paint and Varnish purchased Midland Broadcasting&#x27;s stations.

The major broadcast television networks have affiliates in the Kansas City market (covering 32 counties in northwestern Missouri, with the exception of counties in the far northwestern part of the state that are within the adjacent Saint Joseph market, and northeastern Kansas); including WDAF-TV 4 (Fox), KCTV 5 (CBS), KMBC-TV 9 (ABC), KCPT 19 (PBS), KCWE 29 (The CW), KSHB-TV 41 (NBC) and KSMO-TV 62 (MyNetworkTV). Other television stations in the market include Saint Joseph-based KTAJ-TV 16 (TBN), Kansas City, Kansas-based TV25.tv (consisting of three locally owned stations throughout northeast Kansas, led by KCKS-LD 25, affiliated with several digital multicast networks), Lawrence, Kansas-based KMCI-TV 38 (independent), Spanish-language station KUKC-LD 20 (Univision), Spanish-language station KGKC-LD 39 (Telemundo), and KPXE-TV 50 (Ion Television). The Kansas City television stations also serve as alternates for the nearby Saint Joseph television market.

===Film community===
Kansas City has been a locale for film and television productions. Between 1931 and 1982 Kansas City was home to the Calvin Company, a large film production company that specialized in promotional shorts for corporations and in educational films for schools and the government. Calvin was an important venue for Kansas City arts, training local filmmakers who went on to Hollywood careers and also employing local actors, most of whom earned their main income in fields such as radio and television announcing. Kansas City native Robert Altman directed movies at the Calvin Company, which led him to shoot his first feature film, &quot;The Delinquents&quot;, in Kansas City using many local players.

The 1983 television movie &quot;The Day After&quot; was filmed in Kansas City and Lawrence, Kansas. The 1995 film &quot;Truman&quot;, starring Gary Sinise, was filmed in the city. Other films shot in or around Kansas City include &quot;Article 99&quot;, &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bridge&quot;, &quot;Kansas City&quot;, &quot;Paper Moon&quot;, &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, &quot;Ninth Street&quot;, and &quot;Sometimes They Come Back&quot; (in and around nearby Liberty, Missouri). More recently, a scene in the controversial film &quot;Brüno&quot; was filmed in downtown Kansas City&#x27;s historic Hotel Phillips.

Today, Kansas City is home to an active independent film community. The Independent Filmmaker&#x27;s Coalition is an organization dedicated to expanding and improving independent filmmaking in Kansas City. The city launched the KC Film Office in October 2014 with the goal of better marketing the city for prospective television shows and movies to be filmed there. The City Council passed several film tax incentives in February 2016 to take effect in May 2016; the KC Film Office is coordinating its efforts with the State of Missouri to reinstate film incentives on a statewide level. Kansas City was named as a top city to live and work in as a movie maker in 2020.

==Transportation==

Originally, Kansas City was the launching point for travelers on the Santa Fe, Oregon, and California trails. Later, with the construction of the Hannibal Bridge across the Missouri River, it became the junction of 11 trunk railroads. More rail tonnage passes through the city than through any other U.S. city. Trans World Airlines (TWA) located its headquarters in the city, and had ambitious plans to turn the city into an air hub.

===Highways===

Missouri and Kansas were the first states to start building interstates with Interstate 70. Interstate 435, which encircles the entire city, is the second longest beltway in the Interstate Highway System. (Interstate 275 around Cincinnati, Ohio is the longest.) The Kansas City metro area has more limited-access highway lane-miles per capita than any other large US metro area, over 27% more than the second-place Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, over 50% more than the average American metropolitan area. From 2013 to 2017 the average commuting time was 21.8 minutes. The Sierra Club blames the extensive freeway network for excessive sprawl and the decline of central Kansas City. However, the relatively uncongested road network contributes significantly to Kansas City&#x27;s position as one of America&#x27;s largest logistics hubs.

====Interstate highways====
Kansas City has a confluence of major U.S. interstate highways: I-29, I-35, I-49, I-70, I-435, I-470, I-635, and I-670.

====US highways====
Kansas City includes these US highways: US 24, US 40, US 50, US 56, US 69, US 71, and US 169.

====Missouri state highways====
State routes are Route 1, Route 9, Route 12, Route 45, Route 78, Route 92, Route 150, Route 152, Route 210, Route 269, Route 283, Route 291, and Route 350. Missouri supplemental routes are Route AA, Route D, Route K, Route V, and Route W.

====Other routes====
Other routes include the Chicago–Kansas City Expressway and the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.

===Airports===

Kansas City International Airport (airport code MCI) was built to TWA&#x27;s specifications to make a world hub. Its original passenger-friendly design placed each of its gates from the street. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, it required a costly overhaul to conform to tighter security protocols from the Transportation Security Administration. In March 2023, a new $1.5 billion terminal opened on the site of the old Terminal A. Designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, it is a single, advanced technology terminal with 39 gates, eventually planned to entirely replace remaining Terminals B and C.

Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport (airport code MKC) was TWA&#x27;s original headquarters and houses the Airline History Museum. It is used for general aviation and airshows.

===Public transportation===
Like most American cities, Kansas City&#x27;s mass transit system was originally rail-based. From 1870 to 1957, Kansas City&#x27;s streetcar system was among the top in the country, with over of track at its peak. The rapid sprawl in the following years led this private system to be shut down.

Amtrak currently operates two routes via Kansas City, the Southwest Chief to Chicago or Los Angeles, and the Missouri River Runner to St. Louis.

====KCATA RideKC====
On December 28, 1965, the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority (KCATA) was formed via a bi-state compact created by the Missouri and Kansas legislatures. The compact gave the KCATA responsibility for planning, construction, owning, and operating passenger transportation systems and facilities within the seven-county area.

====RideKC Bus and MAX====

In July 2005, the KCATA launched Kansas City&#x27;s first bus rapid transit line, the Metro Area Express (MAX). MAX links River Market, Downtown, Union Station, Crown Center, and Country Club Plaza. MAX operates and is marketed more like a rail system than a local bus line. A unique identity was created for MAX, including 13 modern diesel buses and easily identifiable &quot;stations&quot;. MAX features (real-time GPS tracking of buses, available at every station), and stoplights automatically change in their favor if buses are behind schedule. In 2010, a second MAX line was added on Troost Avenue. The city is planning another MAX line down Prospect Avenue.

The Prospect MAX line launched in 2019 and Mayor Quinton Lucas announced the service would be fare-free indefinitely.

====RideKC Streetcar====

On December 12, 2012, a ballot initiative to construct a , , modern KC Streetcar line in downtown Kansas City was approved by local voters. The streetcar route runs along Main Street from River Market to Union Station; it debuted on May 6, 2016. A new non-profit corporation made up of private sector stakeholders and city appointees – the Kansas City Streetcar Authority – operates and maintains the system. Unlike many similar systems around the U.S., no fare is to be charged initially. Residents within the proposed Transportation Development District are determining the fate of the KC Streetcar&#x27;s southern extension through Midtown and the Plaza to UMKC. The Port Authority of Kansas City is also studying running an extension to Berkley Riverfront Park.

====RideKC Bridj====
In 2015, the KCATA, Unified Government Transit, Johnson County Transit, and IndeBus began merging from individual metro services into one coordinated transit service for the metropolitan area, called RideKC. The buses and other transit options are branded as RideKC Bus, RideKC MAX, RideKC Streetcar, and RideKC Bridj. RideKC Bridj is a micro transit service partnership between Ford Bridj and KCATA that began on March 7, 2016, much like a taxicab service and with a mobile app. The merger and full coordination is expected to be complete by 2019.

====Intercity transit====
Intercity bus services to Kansas City are provided by Greyhound Lines and Jefferson Lines at the Kansas City Bus Station. Amtrak also serves the city at Union Station via the Southwest Chief and Missouri River Runner.

===Walkability===
A 2015 study by Walk Score ranked Kansas City as the 42nd most walkable out of the 50 largest U.S. cities. As a whole, the city has a score of 34 out of 100. However, several of the more densely populated neighborhoods have much higher scores: Westport has a score of 91, the Downtown Loop has a score of 85, the Crossroads scored 85, and the Plaza scored 83. Those ratings range from &quot;A Walker&#x27;s Paradise&quot; to &quot;Very Walkable&quot;. In April 2017, voters approved an $800 million general obligation bond, part of which is designated for sidewalk repairs and creating complete-streets.

===Modal characteristics===
According to the American Community Survey, 81.6 percent of working Kansas City residents commuted to work by driving alone, 7.9 percent carpooled, 2.7 percent used public transportation, and 1.7 percent walked to work. About 1.5 percent commuted by other means, including taxi, bicycle, or motorcycle. About 4.6 percent of working Kansas City residents worked at home.

In 2015, 11.4 percent of Kansas City households were without a car, which was virtually unchanged in 2016 (11.3 percent). The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Kansas City averaged 1.58 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8 per household.

==Sister cities==
Kansas City has 15 sister cities:

==Notable people==

Current or former long-time residents include cartoonists Walt Disney, Friz Freleng, and Ub Iwerks; musicians Count Basie and Tech N9ne; actors Don Cheadle and Chris Cooper; politicians Emanuel Cleaver and Tom Pendergast; and reporter Walter Cronkite.

<text>Kocher–Debré–Semelaigne syndrome (KDSS) is hypothyroidism in infancy or childhood characterised by lower extremity or generalized muscular hypertrophy (Herculean appearance), myxoedema, short stature, and cognitive impairment.

The syndrome is named after Emil Theodor Kocher, Robert Debré and Georges Semelaigne. Also known as Debré–Semelaigne syndrome or cretinism-muscular hypertrophy, hypothyroid myopathy, hypothyroidism-large muscle syndrome, hypothyreotic muscular hypertrophy in children, infantile myxoedema-muscular hypertrophy, myopathy-myxoedema syndrome, myxoedema-muscular hypertrophy syndrome, myxoedema-myotonic dystrophy syndrome.

The adult-onset form of this syndrome is Hoffmann syndrome. Some sources claim that two of the differentiating symptoms between KDSS and Hoffmann syndrome is that Hoffmann syndrome lacks painful spasms and pseudomyotonia; however, this claim is in conflict with other sources that list these symptoms as also being present in Hoffmann syndrome.

== Presentation ==
The age at which a child presents with KDSS may vary from new born to as late as 11 years of age. This disease is very rare as only less than 10% of children with hypothyroid myopathy develops this condition. Along with features of hypothyroidism (such as lethargy, slow heart rate, cold intolerance, dry skin, and hoarse voice) the main additional feature is muscle hypertrophy. It can happen in any muscle of the limbs, but commonly affects the calf muscles, giving the typical Herculean appearance.

Other features are pseudomyotonia, myokymia, slow tendon reflex, slowed muscle contractions and relaxations, muscle stiffness, proximal muscle weakness and myopathy. The severity of these symptoms are determined by the period of hypothyroidism and the degree of deficiency of thyroid hormones. It may also include macroglossia.

EMG is either normal or may show myopathic low amplitude and short duration motor unit action potentials (MUAPS). The enzymes creatine kinase is elevated usually.

== Pathophysiology ==
The assumed cause of muscle hypertrophy in KDSS is an abnormal metabolism of carbohydrates leading to increased glycogen accumulation and increased mucopolysaccharide deposits in the muscles. Yet another speculation is an excess intra cellular calcium due to ineffective reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which causes a sustained contraction and thereby hypertrophy.

In hypothyroidism the fast twitch muscle fiber is converted to slow twitch fiber, causing the slower reflex or hung up reflex. This may occur as a result of reduction in muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity and beta-adrenergic receptors, as well as the induction of an insulin-resistant state, due to decrease in thyroid hormones.

The causes for muscle weakness is said to be decrease in muscle carnitine, decreased muscle oxidation, expression of a slower ATPase in myosin chain and decreased transport across the cell membrane.

The rigidity associated with congenital hypothyroidism may be due to abnormal development of basal ganglia.

==Diagnosis==
== Differential diagnoses ==
Diseases known to have a pseudoathletic appearance of the calves (hypertrophy or pseudohypertrophy), including exercise intolerance and/or muscle weakness:

* Hoffmann syndrome (adult-onset hypothyroid myopathy),
* Glycogen storage disease (GSD-V, &amp; late-onset GSD-II),
* Non-dystrophic myotonias and pseudomyotonias (such as Myotonia congenita and Brody disease),
* Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy,
* Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy
* Focal myositis,
* Sarcoid granulomas, and
* Amyloid deposits in muscles

Thyroid metabolism can be disrupted secondary to a primary disease. A common comorbidity of the metabolic myopathy McArdle disease (Glycogen storage disease type V) is hypothyroidism. It is also a comorbidity of late-onset Pompe disease (Glycogen storage disease type II). As both hyper- and hypothyroidism disrupts muscle glycogen metabolism, it is important to keep in mind differential diagnoses and their comorbidities when trying to determine whether signs and symptoms are either primary or secondary disease.

== Treatment ==
The muscle hypertrophy and other symptoms are reversible on treatment with levothyroxine.

<text>, or more specifically , are colored varieties of carp (&quot;Cyprinus&quot; sp.) that are kept for decorative purposes in outdoor koi ponds or water gardens. 

Koi is an informal name for the colored variants of carp kept for ornamental purposes. There are many varieties of ornamental koi, originating from breeding that began in Niigata, Japan in the early 19th century. 

Several varieties are recognized by Japanese breeders and owners, distinguished by coloration, patterning, and scalation. Some of the major colors are white, black, red, orange, yellow, blue, brown and cream, besides metallic shades like gold and silver-white (&#x27;platinum&#x27;) scales. The most popular category of koi is the &quot;Gosanke&quot;, which is made up of the &quot;Kōhaku&quot;, &quot;Taishō Sanshoku&quot; and &quot;Shōwa Sanshoku&quot; varieties.

== History ==
Carp are a large group of fish species originally native to Central Europe and Asia. Various carp species were originally domesticated in China, where they were used primarily for consumption. Carp are coldwater fish, and their ability to survive and adapt to many climates and water conditions allowed the domesticated species to be propagated to many new locations, including Japan.

=== Prehistory ===
In Japan, Miocene fossils of the carp family (&quot;Cyprinidae&quot;) have been excavated from Iki Island, Nagasaki Prefecture. Furthermore, numerous carp pharyngeal teeth have been excavated from Jomon and Yayoi period sites. For example, pharyngeal teeth of the extinct species &quot;Jōmon Koi&quot; (&quot;Cyprinus sp.&quot;) in addition to the modern species of carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot; or &quot;Cyprinus rubrofuscus&quot;) have been excavated from the Akanoi Bay lakebed site () in Lake Biwa at the end of the Early Jomon Period (11,500 – 7,000 years ago). In addition, pharyngeal teeth of all six subfamilies of the Cyprinidae family living in Japan today, including carp (Cyprinus), have been found at the Awazu lakebed site () dating from the Middle Jomon Period (5500 – 4400 years ago).

There are differences in the length distribution of carp excavated from Jomon and Yayoi sites, as estimated from the size of their pharyngeal teeth. Specifically, not only adult carp but also juvenile carp (less than 150 mm in length) have been found at the Yayoi site. This difference is thought to be because the Jomon only collected carp from lakes and rivers, while the Yayoi cultivated primitive carp along with the spread of rice paddies.

It was previously thought that all Japanese carp were introduced from China in prehistoric times. However, recent analysis of mitochondrial DNA revealed a significant evolutionary divergence (phylogenetic split) within common carp Cyprinus carpio between the native wild form found in Lake Biwa and the Eurasian wild form, along with domesticated varieties. This supports the idea of the ancient origin of the native Japanese form (Cyprinus sp.), as well as the East Asian ancient lineage of wild common carp (C. carpio), previously proposed on the basis of fossil data. However, it is unknown when the carp from the continent was introduced to Japan. In addition, a possible multiple origin of koi carp was indicated by the polyphyletic distribution of five mtDNA haplotypes of koi carp within the ‘Eurasian’ clade. Moreover, the oldest record of the introduction of non-native fish in Japan is that of goldfish from China (1502 or 1602), and there is no record of carp (including colored carp) until the introduction of the mirror carp, called &quot;Doitsugoi&quot; (German carp), in 1904.

=== Middle Ages ===
In the Japanese history book &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; (Chronicles of Japan, 720), it is written that Emperor Keikō released carp in a pond for viewing when he visited Mino Province (present Gifu Prefecture) in the fourth year of his reign (74 AD). In Cui Bao&#x27;s &quot;Gǔjīnzhù&quot; (, Annotations on the Ancient and Modern Period) from the Western Jin Dynasty (4th century A.D.) in China, carp of the following colors are described: red horse (), blue horse (), black horse (), white horse (), and yellow pheasant (). In China in those days, carp were called horses because they were believed to be the vehicles of hermits and to run in the sky.

Japan&#x27;s oldest drug dictionary, Fukane Sukehito&#x27;s &quot;Honzō Wamyō&quot; (, 918) mentions red carp (), blue carp (), black carp (), white carp (), and yellow carp () as Japanese names corresponding to the above Chinese names, suggesting that carp of these colors existed in China and Japan in those days. In addition, Hitomi Hitsudai&#x27;s drug dictionary &quot;Honchō Shokkan&quot; (, Japanese Medicine Encyclopedia, 1697) states that red, yellow, and white carp of the three colors were in Japan at that time.

However, it is believed that these single-colored carp were not a variety created by artificial selection, as is the case with today&#x27;s koi, but rather a mutation-induced color change. In ancient times, carp was farmed primarily for food. Mutational color variation in carp is relatively common in nature, but is not suitable for development alongside farming for food in poor rural communities; color inheritance is unstable and selection to maintain color variation is costly. For example, in current-day farming of koi as ornamental fish, the percentage of superior colored fish to the number of spawn is less than 1%.

The Amur carp (&quot;Cyprinus rubrofuscus&quot;) is a member of the cyprinid family species complex native to East Asia. Amur carp were previously identified as a subspecies of the common carp (as &quot;C. c. haematopterus&quot;), but recent authorities treat it as a separate species under the name &quot;C. rubrofuscus&quot;. Amur carp have been aquacultured as a food fish at least as long ago as the fifth century BC in China.

=== Modern period ===

The systematic breeding of ornamental Amur carp began in the 1820s in an area known as &quot;Nijūmuragō&quot; (, ) which spans Ojiya and Yamakoshi in Niigata Prefecture (located on the northeastern coast of Honshu) in Japan. In Niigata Prefecture, Amur carp were farmed for food in Musubu Shinden, Kanbara County (present Akiba Ward, Niigata City) from the end of the Genna era (1615–1624). In the Nijūmuragō area, carp were also farmed in terraced ponds near terraced rice paddies by 1781 at the latest, but the ponds ran dry due to a severe drought that occurred around that time, and the carp escaped the disaster by taking refuge in ponds on the grounds of Senryu Shrine in Higashiyama Village and Juni Shrine in Higashitakezawa Village.

During the Bunka and Bunsei eras (1804 – 1830), people in the Nijūmuragō area bred red and white koi in addition to black koi, and crossed them to produce red and white colored koi. After that, they further crossed them and perfected them.

Around 1875, colored koi became popular and the number of breeders increased, and some expensive koi were produced, but Niigata Prefecture banned the aquaculture of ornamental koi because it was considered a speculative business, and the business suffered a major blow for a time. However, the ban was lifted soon after, thanks to the petition of the villagers. At that time, colored koi included &quot;Kōhaku&quot;, &quot;Asagi&quot;, &quot;Ki Utsuri&quot;, etc. From this original handful of koi varieties, all other Nishikigoi varieties were bred, with the exception of the Ogon variety (single-colored, metallic koi), which was developed relatively recently.

Koi breeding flourished in the Nijūmuragō area for two reasons: 1) the custom of raising koi in fallow fields for emergency food during the winter, and 2) the existence of many &quot;inden&quot; (), or hidden rice fields in the mountains, unknown to the lord, which allowed the farmers to avoid taxes and become relatively wealthy. Breeding of koi was promoted as a hobby of farmers who could afford it, and high-quality individuals came to be bought and sold.

The name &quot;Nishikigoi&quot; (brocaded carp) did not exist until the 1910s. Before that time, &quot;Nishikigoi&quot; were called &quot;Madaragoi&quot; (, ), &quot;Kawarigoi&quot; (, ), &quot;Irogoi&quot; (, ), &quot;Moyōgoi&quot; (, ), and so on.

A geographical book on Suruga Province (present-day Shizuoka Prefecture), Abe Masanobu&#x27;s &quot;Sunkoku Zasshi&quot; (1843), mentions that in addition to Asagi, purple, red, and white carp, there are &quot;spotted carp (also known as Bekko carp).&quot; This probably refers to two- or three-colored carp caused by mutation, and is a valuable record of &quot;Nishikigoi&quot; of the Edo period (1603 – 1868).
In 1900, there was a three-colored carp in Ritsurin Garden in Takamatsu, Kagawa Prefecture, and the price was over 1,000 yen per fish, which was a high price for that time. The three-colored carp had a red belly and &quot;asagi&quot; (light blue) back with black spots, and is thought to have been a mutation similar to today&#x27;s &quot;Asagi&quot; koi.
The magazine &quot;Shonen&quot; (1910) introduced &quot;Nishikigoi&quot; under the name of &quot;Madaragoi&quot; (spotted carp) or &quot;Kawarigoi&quot; (variant carp), and said that even skilled fish breeders did not know how they could produce &quot;Nishikigoi&quot;, but only waited for them to be produced by chance. The price of &quot;Nishikigoi&quot; at a fish show in Fukagawa, Tokyo, was 100 to 150 yen per fish, which was &quot;extremely expensive&quot; at the time. Therefore, even at that time, mutant &quot;Nishikigoi&quot; were known to some fish breeders and hobbyists in Tokyo, but artificial breeds such as Nijūmuragō&#x27;s &quot;Nishikigoi&quot; were still unknown to the general public.

In 1914, when the Tokyo Taishō Exposition was held, the &quot;Koi Exhibit Association&quot; was formed mainly by koi breeders in Higashiyama and Takezawa villages, and koi were exhibited. At the time, they were still called &quot;colored carp&quot; or &quot;patterned carp,&quot; and they were described as &quot;the first of their kind ever seen in the Tokyo area.&quot; And the koi received much attention, winning a silver medal. After the exposition closed, they presented eight koi to the Crown Prince (Emperor Showa). This exhibition triggered an expansion of sales channels, and the market value of koi soared.

In 1917, the &quot;Taishō Sanshoku&quot; (by Eizaburo Hoshino) was fixed as a breed. The name &quot;Nishikigoi&quot; is said to have been given by Kei Abe, who was the chief fisheries officer of the Niigata Prefectural Government in the Taisho era (1912–1926), after he admired the &quot;Taishō Sanshoku&quot; when he first saw it. In 1917, the fixation of &quot;Kōhaku&quot; (by Kunizo Hiroi), which had first been produced in the 1880s, was also assured.

Apart from the koi of Niigata Prefecture&#x27;s Nijūmuragō area, there is a variety called &quot;Shūsui&quot; (), which was created by Tokyo-based goldfish breeder Kichigoro Akiyama in 1906 by crossing a female leather carp imported from Germany with a male Japanese &quot;Asagi&quot; or spotted carp. The leather carp is a low scaled variety bred in 1782 in Austria, and was sent to Japan from Munich, Germany in 1904, along with the mirror carp, which also has few scales. In Japan, these two varieties are called &quot;Doitsugoi&quot; (German carp), and &quot;Shūsui&quot; and its lineage are also called &quot;Doitsu&quot; or &quot;Doitsugoi&quot; in koi.

In 1927, &quot;Shōwa Sanshoku&quot; (by Shigekichi Hoshino) was fixed as a breed, and in 1939, koi were exhibited at the Japanese pavilion at the Golden Gate International Exposition held in San Francisco.

=== Today ===
The hobby of keeping koi eventually spread worldwide. They are sold in many pet aquarium shops, with higher-quality fish available from specialist dealers. Collecting koi has become a social hobby. Passionate hobbyists join clubs, share their knowledge and help each other with their koi. In particular, since the 21st century, some wealthy Chinese have imported large quantities of koi from Niigata in Japan, and the price of high-quality carp has soared. In 2018, one carp was bought by a Chinese collector for about $2 million, the highest price ever. There are also cases in which purchased carp are bred in China and sold to foreign countries, and many breeds are spreading all over the world.

== Etymology ==

The words &quot;koi&quot; and &quot;nishikigoi&quot; come from the Japanese words 鯉 (carp), and 錦鯉 (brocaded carp), respectively. In Japanese, &quot;koi&quot; is a homophone for 恋, another word that means &quot;affection&quot; or &quot;love&quot;, so koi are symbols of love and friendship in Japan.

Colored ornamental carp were originally called &quot;Irokoi&quot; (色鯉) meaning colored carp, &quot;Hanakoi&quot; (花鯉) meaning floral carp, and &quot;Moyōkoi&quot; (模様鯉) meaning patterned carp. There are various theories as to how these words came to be disused, in favor of &quot;Nishikigoi&quot; (錦鯉), which is used today. One theory holds that, during World War II, the words &quot;Irokoi&quot; and &quot;Hanakoi&quot; (which can have sexual meanings) were changed to &quot;Nishikigoi&quot; because they were not suitable for the social situation of war. Another theory is that&quot; Nishikigoi&quot;, which was the original name for the popular Taishō Sanshoku variety, gradually became the term used for all ornamental koi.

== Taxonomy ==
The koi are a group of breeds produced by artificial selection primarily from black carp called &quot;nogoi&quot; (, ) or &quot;magoi&quot; (, ), which inhabit lakes, ponds, and rivers in Japan. The black carp refers to the Eurasian carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot;), which was previously thought to have been introduced to Japan from Eurasia in prehistoric times.

Philipp Franz von Siebold of the Netherlands, who stayed in Japan during the Edo period, reported in &quot;Fauna Japonica&quot; (1833–1850) that there were three species of carp in Japan: &quot;Cyprinus haematopterus&quot;, &quot;Cyprinus melanotus&quot;, and &quot;Cyprinus conirostris&quot;. This classification has not received much attention until recently, and it was thought that only one species of carp existed in Japan. However, recent analysis of mitochondrial DNA has revealed that there are at least two species of carp in Japan: native carp and carp from Eurasia. Currently, the Japanese native carp is assumed to be &quot;Cyprinus melanotus&quot;, and a new scientific name for it is being considered.

&quot;Cyprinus haematopterus&quot; is thought to refer to the Amur carp of Eurasian origin, traditionally called &quot;Yamatogoi&quot; (, ) in Japan. &quot;Yamatogoi&quot; have been famous since the Edo period as farmed carp in Yamato Province (now Nara Prefecture). Other carp of the same type as &quot;Yamatogoi&quot; are known as &quot;Yodogoi&quot; (, Yodo River carp) from Osaka and &quot;Shinshūgoi&quot; (, introduced &quot;Yodogoi&quot;) from Nagano Prefecture. These carp were famous for their delicious taste. Since the Meiji period, &quot;Yamatogoi&quot; have been released into lakes and rivers throughout Japan, causing genetic contamination with native carp and making research on the origin of the Japanese carp difficult. Koi is thought to be primarily of this &quot;Yamatogoi&quot; (Amur carp) lineage, but it also carries some genes of the native Japanese carp.

In the past, koi were commonly believed to have been bred from the common carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot;). Extensive hybridization between different populations, coupled with widespread translocations, has muddled the historical zoogeography of the common carp and its relatives. Traditionally, Amur carp (&quot;C. rubrofuscus&quot;) were considered a subspecies of the common carp, often under the scientific name &quot;C. carpio haematopterus&quot;. However, they differ in meristics from the common carp of Europe and Western Asia, leading recent authorities to recognize them as a separate species, &quot;C. rubrofuscus&quot; (&quot;C. c. haematopterus&quot; being a junior synonym). Although one study of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was unable to find a clear genetic structure matching the geographic populations (possibly because of translocation of carp from separate regions), others based on mtDNA, microsatellite DNA and genomic DNA found a clear separation between the European/West Asian population and the East Asian population, with koi belonging in the latter. Consequently, recent authorities have suggested that the ancestral species of the koi is &quot;C. rubrofuscus&quot; (syn. &quot;C. c. haematopterus&quot;) or at least an East Asian carp species instead of &quot;C. carpio&quot;. Regardless, a taxonomic review of &quot;Cyprinus&quot; carp from eastern and southeastern Asia may be necessary, as the genetic variations do not fully match the currently recognized species pattern, with one study of mtDNA suggesting that koi are close to the Southeast Asian carp, but not necessarily the Chinese.

== Varieties ==
According to &quot;Zen Nippon Airinkai&quot;, a group that leads the breeding and dissemination of koi in Japan, there are more than 100 varieties of koi created through breeding, and each variety is classified into 16 groups. Koi varieties are distinguished by coloration, patterning, and scalation. Some of the major colors are white, black, red, yellow, blue, and cream. Metallic shades of gold and platinum in the scales have also been developed through selective breeding. Although the possible colors are virtually limitless, breeders have identified and named a number of specific categories. The most notable category is , which is made up of the &quot;Kōhaku&quot;, &quot;Taishō Sanshoku&quot;, and &quot;Shōwa Sanshoku&quot; varieties.

New koi varieties are still being actively developed. Ghost koi developed in the 1980s have become very popular in the United Kingdom; they are a hybrid of wild carp and Ogon koi and are distinguished by their metallic scales. Butterfly koi (also known as longfin koi, or dragon carp), also developed in the 1980s, are notable for their long and flowing fins. They are hybrids of koi with Asian carp. Butterfly koi and ghost koi are considered by some to be not true &quot;nishikigoi&quot;.

The major named varieties include:

* is a white-skinned koi, with large red markings on the top. The name means &quot;red and white&quot;; &quot;kōhaku&quot; was one of the first ornamental varieties to be established in Japan (late 19th century).
* is very similar to the &quot;kōhaku&quot;, except for the addition of small black markings called . This variety was first exhibited in 1914 by the koi breeder Gonzo Hiroi, during the reign of the Taishō Emperor. In the United States, the name is often abbreviated to just &quot;Sanke&quot;. The &quot;kanji&quot;, 三色, may be read as either &quot;sanshoku&quot; or as &quot;sanke&quot; (from its earlier name 三毛).
* is a black koi with red (&quot;hi&quot; 緋) and white (&quot;shiroji&quot; 白地) markings. The first &quot;Shōwa Sanke&quot; was exhibited in 1927, during the reign of the Shōwa Emperor. In America, the name is often abbreviated to just &quot;Shōwa&quot;. The amount of &quot;shiroji&quot; on &quot;Shōwa Sanke&quot; has increased in modern times (&quot;Kindai Shōwa&quot; 近代昭和), to the point that it can be difficult to distinguish from &quot;Taishō Sanke&quot;. The &quot;kanji&quot;, 三色, may be read as either &quot;sanshoku&quot; or as &quot;sanke.&quot;
* is a white-, red-, or yellow-skinned koi with black markings . The Japanese name means &quot;tortoise shell&quot;, and is commonly written as 鼈甲. The white, red, and yellow varieties are called , and , respectively. It may be confused with the &quot;Utsuri&quot;.
* is a black koi with white, red, or yellow markings, in a zebra color pattern. The oldest attested form is the yellow form, called in the 19th century, but renamed by Elizaburo Hoshino, an early 20th-century koi breeder. The red and white versions are called and (piebald color morph), respectively. The word &quot;utsuri&quot; means to print (the black markings are reminiscent of ink stains). Genetically, it is the same as &quot;Shōwa&quot;, but lacking either red pigment (&quot;Shiro Utsuri&quot;) or white pigment (&quot;Hi Utsuri&quot;/&quot;Ki Utsuri&quot;).
* koi is light blue above and usually red below, but also occasionally pale yellow or cream, generally below the lateral line and on the cheeks. The Japanese name means pale greenish-blue, spring onion color, or indigo.
* &#x27; means &quot;autumn green&quot;; the &quot;Shūsui&quot; was created in 1910 by Yoshigoro Akiyama（秋山　吉五郎, by crossing Japanese &quot;Asagi&quot; with German mirror carp. The fish has no scales, except for a single line of large mirror scales dorsally, extending from head to tail. The most common type of &quot;Shūsui&quot; has a pale, sky-blue/gray color above the lateral line and red or orange (and very, very rarely bright yellow) below the lateral line and on the cheeks.
* is a white fish with a &quot;Kōhaku&quot;-style pattern with blue or black-edged scales only over the &quot;hi&quot; pattern. This variety first arose in the 1950s as a cross between a &quot;Kōhaku&quot; and an &quot;Asagi&quot;. The most commonly encountered &quot;Koromo&quot; is an , which is colored like a &quot;Kōhaku&quot;, except each of the scales within the red patches has a blue or black edge to it. Less common is the , which has a darker (burgundy) &quot;hi&quot; overlay that gives it the appearance of bunches of grapes. Very rarely seen is the , which is similar to &quot;Budō-Goromo&quot;, but the &quot;hi&quot; pattern is such a dark burgundy that it appears nearly black.
* is a &quot;catch-all&quot; term for koi that cannot be put into one of the other categories. This is a competition category, and many new varieties of koi compete in this one category. It is also known as .
* is a dark koi with red (&quot;Kōhaku&quot; style) &quot;hi&quot; pattern. The Japanese name means &quot;five colors&quot;. It appears similar to an &quot;Asagi&quot;, with little or no &quot;hi&quot; below the lateral line and a &quot;Kōhaku Hi&quot; pattern over reticulated (fishnet pattern) scales. The base color can range from nearly black to very pale, sky blue.
* is a variety of which the whole body is one color and the body is shiny, and it is called differently depending on the color.
* is a koi with colored markings over a metallic base or in two metallic colors.
* is a cross between &quot;utsurimono&quot; series and &quot;Ōgon&quot;.
* is a koi with metallic (glittering, metal-flake-appearing) scales. The name translates into English as &quot;gold and silver scales&quot;; it is often abbreviated to &quot;Ginrin&quot;. &quot;Ginrin&quot; versions of almost all other varieties of koi occur, and they are fashionable. Their sparkling, glittering scales contrast to the smooth, even, metallic skin and scales seen in the &quot;Ogon&quot; varieties. Recently, these characteristics have been combined to create the new &quot;ginrin Ogon&quot; varieties.
* is any koi with a solitary red patch on its head. The fish may be a &quot;Tanchō Shōwa&quot;, &quot;Tanchō Sanke&quot;, or even &quot;Tanchō Goshiki&quot;. It is named for the Japanese red-crowned crane (&quot;Grus japonensis&quot;), which also has a red spot on its head.
* , &quot;tea-colored&quot;, this koi can range in color from pale olive-drab green or brown to copper or bronze and more recently, darker, subdued orange shades. Famous for its docile, friendly personality and large size, it is considered a sign of good luck among koi keepers.
* is a metallic koi of one color only (&quot;hikarimono&quot; 光者). The most commonly encountered colors are gold, platinum, and orange. Cream specimens are very rare. &quot;Ogon&quot; compete in the &quot;Kawarimono&quot; category and the Japanese name means &quot;gold&quot;. The variety was created by Sawata Aoki in 1946 from wild carp he caught in 1921.
* &#x27; （literally &quot;nine tattooed dragons&quot; is a black &quot;doitsu&quot;-scaled fish with curling white markings. The patterns are thought to be reminiscent of Japanese ink paintings of dragons. They famously change color with the seasons. &quot;Kumonryu &quot;compete in the &quot;Kawarimono&quot; category.
* is a light blue/gray koi with copper, bronze, or yellow (&quot;Kohaku&quot;-style) pattern, reminiscent of autumn leaves on water. The Japanese name means &quot;fallen leaves&quot;.
* &quot;Kikokuryū&quot; (輝黒竜, literally &quot;sparkle&quot; or &quot;glitter black dragon&quot;) is a metallic-skinned version of the &quot;Kumonryu&quot;.
* &quot;Kin-Kikokuryū&quot; (金輝黒竜, literally &quot;gold sparkle black dragon&quot; or &quot;gold glitter black dragon&quot;) is a metallic-skinned version of the &quot;Kumonryu&quot; with a &quot;Kōhaku&quot;-style &quot;hi&quot; pattern developed by Mr. Seiki Igarashi of Ojiya City. At least six different genetic subvarieties of this general variety are seen.
* Ghost koi (人面魚、じんめんぎょ), a hybrid of &quot;Ogon&quot; and wild carp with metallic scales, is considered by some to be not &quot;nishikigoi&quot;.
* Butterfly koi (鰭長錦鯉、ひれながにしきごい) is a hybrid of koi and Asian carp with long flowing fins. Various colorations depend on the koi stock used to cross. It also is considered by some to not be &quot;nishikigoi&quot;.
* originated by crossbreeding numerous different established varieties with &quot;scaleless&quot; German carp (generally, fish with only a single line of scales along each side of the dorsal fin). Also written as 独逸鯉, four main types of &quot;Doitsu&quot; scale patterns exist. The most common type (referred to above) has a row of scales beginning at the front of the dorsal fin and ending at the end of the dorsal fin (along both sides of the fin). The second type has a row of scales beginning where the head meets the shoulder and running the entire length of the fish (along both sides). The third type is the same as the second, with the addition of a line of (often quite large) scales running along the lateral line (along the side) of the fish, also referred to as &quot;mirror koi&quot;. The fourth (and rarest) type is referred to as &quot;armor koi&quot; and is completely (or nearly) covered with very large scales that resemble plates of armor. It also is called &quot;Kagami-goi&quot; (鏡鯉、カガミゴイ), or mirror carp (ミラーカープ).

== Differences from goldfish ==
Goldfish (&quot;Carassius auratus&quot;) were developed in China more than a thousand years ago by selectively breeding colored varieties; by the Song dynasty (960–1279), yellow, orange, white, and red-and-white colorations had been developed. Goldfish were introduced to Japan in the 16th century and to Europe in the 17th century. On the other hand, most ornamental koi breeds currently distributed worldwide originate from Amur carp (&quot;Cyprinus rubrofuscus&quot;) bred in Japan in the first half of the 19th century. Koi are domesticated Amur carp that are selected or culled for color; they are not a different species, and will revert to the original coloration within a few generations if allowed to breed freely.

Some goldfish varieties, such as the common goldfish, comet goldfish, and shubunkin, have body shapes and coloration that are similar to koi, and can be difficult to tell apart from koi when immature. Goldfish and koi can interbreed; however, as they were developed from different species of carp, their offspring are sterile.

== Health, maintenance, and longevity ==

The Amur carp is a hardy fish, and koi retain that durability. Koi are coldwater fish, but benefit from being kept in the range, and do not react well to long, cold, winter temperatures; their immune systems are very weak below . Koi ponds usually have a metre or more of depth in areas of the world that become warm during the summer, whereas in areas that have harsher winters, ponds generally have a minimum of . Specific pond construction has been evolved by koi keepers intent on raising show-quality koi.

The bright colors of koi put them at a severe disadvantage against predators; a white-skinned &quot;Kōhaku&quot; is highly noticeable against the dark green of a pond. Herons, kingfishers, otters, raccoons, skunk, mink, cats, foxes, and badgers are all capable of spotting out koi and eating them. A well-designed outdoor pond has areas too deep for herons to stand, overhangs high enough above the water that mammals cannot reach in, and shade trees overhead to block the view of aerial passers-by. It may prove necessary to string nets or wires above the surface. A pond usually includes a pump and a filtration system to keep the water clear.

Koi are an omnivorous fish. They eat a wide variety of foods, including peas, lettuce, and watermelon. Koi food is designed not only to be nutritionally balanced, but also to float so as to encourage them to come to the surface. When they are eating, koi can be checked for parasites and ulcers. Naturally, koi are bottom feeders with a mouth configuration adapted for that. Some koi have a tendency to eat mostly from the bottom, so food producers create a mixed sinking and floating combination food. Koi recognize the persons feeding them and gather around them at feeding times. They can be trained to take food from one&#x27;s hand. In the winter, their digestive systems slow nearly to a halt, and they eat very little, perhaps no more than nibbles of algae from the bottom. Feeding is not recommended when the water temperature drops below . Care should be taken by hobbyists that proper oxygenation, pH stabilization, and off-gassing occur over the winter in small ponds. Their appetites do not come back until the water becomes warm in the spring.

Koi have been reported to achieve ages of 100–200 years. One famous scarlet koi named &quot;Hanako&quot; was owned by several individuals, the last of whom was Komei Koshihara. In July 1974, a study of the growth rings of one of the koi&#x27;s scales reported that Hanako was 226 years old. Some sources give an accepted age for the species at little more than 50 years.

=== Disease ===
Koi are very hardy. With proper care, they resist many of the parasites that affect more sensitive tropical fish species, such as &quot;Trichodina, Epistylis&quot;, and &quot;Ichthyophthirius multifiliis&quot; infections. Water changes help reduce the risk of diseases and keep koi from being stressed. Two of the biggest health concerns among koi breeders are the koi herpes virus (KHV) and rhabdovirus carpio, which causes spring viraemia of carp (SVC). No treatment is known for either disease. Some koi farms in Israel use the KV3 vaccine, developed by M. Kotler from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and produced by Kovax, to immunise fish against KHV. Israel is currently the only country in the world to vaccinate koi against the KHV. The vaccine is injected into the fish when they are under one year old, and is accentuated by using an ultraviolet light. The vaccine has a 90% success rate and when immunized, the fish cannot succumb to a KHV outbreak and neither can the immunised koi pass KHV onto other fish in a pond. Only biosecurity measures such as prompt detection, isolation, and disinfection of tanks and equipment can prevent the spread of the disease and limit the loss of fish stock. In 2002, spring viraemia struck an ornamental koi farm in Kernersville, North Carolina, and required complete depopulation of the ponds and a lengthy quarantine period. For a while after this, some koi farmers in neighboring states stopped importing fish for fear of infecting their own stocks.

== Breeding ==

When koi naturally breed on their own they tend to spawn in the spring and summer seasons. The male will start following the female, swimming right behind her and nudging her. After the female koi releases her eggs they sink to the bottom of the pond and stay there. A sticky outer shell around the egg helps keep it in place so it does not float around. Although the female can produce many spawns, many of the fry do not survive due to being eaten by others.

Like most fish, koi reproduce through spawning in which a female lays a vast number of eggs and one or more males fertilize them. Nurturing the resulting offspring (referred to as &quot;fry&quot;) is a tricky and tedious job, usually done only by professionals. Although a koi breeder may carefully select the parents they wish based on their desired characteristics, the resulting fry nonetheless exhibit a wide range of color and quality.

Koi produce thousands of offspring from a single spawning. However, unlike cattle, purebred dogs, or more relevantly, goldfish, the large majority of these offspring, even from the best champion-grade koi, are not acceptable as &quot;nishikigoi&quot; (they have no interesting colors) or may even be genetically defective. These unacceptable offspring are culled at various stages of development based on the breeder&#x27;s expert eye and closely guarded trade techniques. Culled fry are usually destroyed or used as feeder fish (mostly used for feeding arowana due to the belief that it will enhance its color), while older culls, within their first year between 3 and 6 inches long (also called &quot;tosai&quot;), are often sold as lower-grade, pond-quality koi.

The semi-randomized result of the koi&#x27;s reproductive process has both advantages and disadvantages for the breeder. While it requires diligent oversight to narrow down the favorable result that the breeder wants, it also makes possible the development of new varieties of koi within relatively few generations.

== In the wild ==

Koi have been accidentally or deliberately released into the wild in every continent except Antarctica. They quickly revert to the natural coloration of an Amur carp within a few generations. In many areas, they are considered an invasive species and a pest. In the states of Queensland and New South Wales in Australia, they are considered noxious fish.

In Japan, koi releases are sometimes held as an event for tourism purposes. However, as koi is artificial breed, this causes genetic pollution by breeding with native carps.

Koi greatly increase the turbidity of the water because they are constantly stirring up the substrate. This makes waterways unattractive, reduces the abundance of aquatic plants, and can render the water unsuitable for swimming or drinking, even by livestock. In some countries, koi have caused so much damage to waterways that vast amounts of money and effort have been spent trying to eradicate them, largely unsuccessfully.

In many areas of North America, koi are introduced into the artificial &quot;water hazards&quot; and ponds on golf courses to keep water-borne insect larvae under control through predation.

== In common culture ==
In Japan, the koi is a symbol of luck, prosperity, and good fortune, and also of perseverance in the face of adversity. Ornamental koi are symbolic of Japanese culture and are closely associated with the country&#x27;s national identity. The custom of &quot;koinobori&quot; (carp streamers), which began in the Edo period (1603–1867), is still practiced today and displayed in gardens on Children&#x27;s Day, 5 May.

In Chinese culture, the koi represents fame, family harmony, and wealth. It is a feng shui favorite, symbolizing abundance as well as perseverance and strength, and has a mythical potential to transform into a dragon. Since the late 20th century, the keeping of koi in outdoor water gardens has become popular among the more affluent Chinese. Koi ponds are found in Chinese communities around the world, and the number of people who keep koi imported from Niigata, has been increasing. In addition, there are increasing numbers of Japanese koi bred in China that are sold domestically and exported to foreign countries.

Koi are also popular in many countries in the equatorial region, where outdoor water gardens are popular. In Sri Lanka, interior courtyards most often have one or several fish ponds dedicated to koi.

<text>Knut Hamsun (4 August 1859 – 19 February 1952) was a Norwegian writer who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1920. Hamsun&#x27;s work spans more than 70 years and shows variation with regard to consciousness, subject, perspective and environment. He published more than 23 novels, a collection of poetry, some short stories and plays, a travelogue, works of non-fiction and some essays.

Hamsun is considered to be &quot;one of the most influential and innovative literary stylists of the past hundred years&quot; (&quot;ca.&quot; 1890–1990). He pioneered psychological literature with techniques of stream of consciousness and interior monologue, and influenced authors such as Thomas Mann, Franz Kafka, Maxim Gorky, Stefan Zweig, Henry Miller, Hermann Hesse, John Fante, James Kelman, Charles Bukowski and Ernest Hemingway. Isaac Bashevis Singer called Hamsun &quot;the father of the modern school of literature in his every aspect—his subjectiveness, his fragmentariness, his use of flashbacks, his lyricism. The whole modern school of fiction in the twentieth century stems from Hamsun&quot;. Since 1916, several of Hamsun&#x27;s works have been adapted into motion pictures. On 4 August 2009, the Knut Hamsun Centre was opened in Hamarøy Municipality.

The young Hamsun objected to realism and naturalism. He argued that the main object of modernist literature should be the intricacies of the human mind, that writers should describe the &quot;whisper of blood, and the pleading of bone marrow&quot;. Hamsun is considered the &quot;leader of the Neo-Romantic revolt at the turn of the 20th century&quot;, with works such as &quot;Hunger&quot; (1890), &quot;Mysteries&quot; (1892), &quot;Pan&quot; (1894), and &quot;Victoria&quot; (1898). His later works—in particular his &quot;Nordland novels&quot;—were influenced by the Norwegian new realism, portraying everyday life in rural Norway and often employing local dialect, irony, and humour. Hamsun only published one poetry collection, &quot;The Wild Choir&quot;, which has been set to music by several composers.

Hamsun had strong anti-English views, in part due to the treatment of Norway during World War I, and openly supported Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, travelling to meet Hitler during the German occupation of Norway. Due to his professed support for the occupation of Norway and the Quisling regime, he was charged with treason after the war. He was not convicted, officially due to psychological problems and issues relating to old age, but was issued a heavy fine in 1948. Hamsun&#x27;s last book, &quot;On Overgrown Paths&quot;, authored in semi-imprisonment in Landvik, concerned his treatment and rebuttal of accusations of his mental ineptness.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Knut Hamsun was born as Knud Pedersen in Lom, Norway in the Gudbrandsdal valley. He was the fourth son (of seven children) of Tora Olsdatter and Peder Pedersen. When he was three, the family moved to Hamsund in Hamarøy Municipality in Nordland county. They were poor and an uncle had invited them to farm his land for him.

At nine Knut was separated from his family and lived with his uncle Hans Olsen, who needed help with the post office he ran. Olsen used to beat and starve his nephew, and Hamsun later stated that his chronic nervous difficulties were due to the way his uncle treated him.

In 1874 he finally escaped back to Lom. For the next five years he did any job for money; he was a store clerk, peddler, shoemaker&#x27;s apprentice, sheriff&#x27;s assistant, and an elementary-school teacher.

At 17 he became a ropemaker&#x27;s apprentice; at about the same time he started to write. He asked businessman Erasmus Zahl to give him significant monetary support, and Zahl agreed. Hamsun later used Zahl as a model for the character &quot;Mack&quot; appearing in his novels &quot;Pan&quot; (1894), &quot;Dreamers&quot; (1904), &quot;Benoni&quot; (1908) and &quot;Rosa&quot; (1908).

He spent several years in America, traveling and working at various jobs, and published his impressions under the title &quot;Fra det moderne Amerikas Aandsliv&quot; (1889).

===Early literary career===

Working all those odd jobs paid off, and he published his first book: &quot;Den Gaadefulde: En Kjærlighedshistorie fra Nordland&quot; (&quot;The Enigmatic Man: A Love Story from Northern Norway&quot;, 1877). It was inspired from the experiences and struggles he endured from his jobs.

In his second novel &quot;Bjørger&quot; (1878), he attempted to imitate Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson&#x27;s writing style of the Icelandic saga narrative. The melodramatic story follows a poet, Bjørger, and his love for Laura. This book was published under the pseudonym Knud Pedersen Hamsund. This book later served as the basis for &quot;Victoria: En Kærligheds Historie&quot; (1898; translated as &quot;Victoria: A Love Story&quot;, 1923).

As of 1898 Hamsun was among the contributors of &quot;Ringeren&quot;, a political and cultural magazine established by Sigurd Ibsen.

===Major works===
Hamsun first received wide acclaim with his 1890 novel &quot;Hunger&quot; (&quot;Sult&quot;). The semiautobiographical work described a young writer&#x27;s descent into near madness as a result of hunger and poverty in the Norwegian capital of Kristiania (modern name Oslo). To many, the novel presages the writings of Franz Kafka and other twentieth-century novelists with its internal monologue and bizarre logic.

A theme to which Hamsun often returned is that of the perpetual wanderer, an itinerant stranger (often the narrator) who shows up and insinuates himself into the life of small rural communities. This wanderer theme is central to the novels &quot;Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Pan&quot;, &quot;Under the Autumn Star&quot;, &quot;The Last Joy&quot;, &quot;Vagabonds&quot;, &quot;Rosa&quot;, and others.

Hamsun&#x27;s prose often contains rapturous depictions of the natural world, with intimate reflections on the Norwegian woodlands and coastline. For this reason, he has been linked with the spiritual movement known as pantheism (&quot;No one knows God,&quot; he once wrote, &quot;man knows
only gods.&quot;). Hamsun saw mankind and nature united in a strong, sometimes mystical bond. This connection between the characters and their natural environment is exemplified in the novels &quot;Pan&quot;, &quot;A Wanderer Plays on Muted Strings&quot;, and the epic &quot;Growth of the Soil&quot;, &quot;his monumental work&quot; credited with securing him the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1920.

===World War II, arrest and trial===
During World War II, Hamsun supported the German war effort. He courted and met with high-ranking Nazi officers, including Adolf Hitler. Nazi Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels wrote a long and enthusiastic diary entry concerning a private meeting with Hamsun; according to Goebbels, Hamsun&#x27;s &quot;faith in German victory is unshakable&quot;. In 1940 Hamsun wrote that &quot;the Germans are fighting for us&quot;. After Hitler&#x27;s death, he published a short obituary in which he described him as &quot;a warrior for mankind&quot; and &quot;a preacher of the gospel of justice for all nations&quot;.

After the war, he was detained by police on 14 June 1945, for treason, then committed to a hospital in Grimstad (&quot;Grimstad sykehus&quot;) &quot;due to his advanced age&quot;, according to Einar Kringlen (a professor and medical doctor). In 1947 he was tried in Grimstad and fined. Norway&#x27;s supreme court reduced the fine from 575,000 to 325,000 Norwegian kroner.

After the war, Hamsun&#x27;s views on the Germans during the war were a cause of serious grief for the Norwegians, and they tried to separate their world-famous writer from his Nazi beliefs. At the trial Hamsun had pleaded ignorance. Deeper explanations involve his contradictory personality, his distaste for &quot;hoi polloi&quot;, his inferiority complex, a profound distress at the spread of indiscipline, antipathy toward the interwar democracy, and especially his Anglophobia.

===Death===
Knut Hamsun died on 19 February 1952, aged 92, in Grimstad. His ashes are buried in the garden of his home at Nørholm in Grimstad Municipality.

==Legacy==
Thomas Mann described him as a &quot;descendant of Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Friedrich Nietzsche.&quot; Arthur Koestler was a fan of his love stories. H. G. Wells praised &quot;Markens Grøde&quot; (1917) for which Hamsun was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. Isaac Bashevis Singer was a fan of his modern subjectivism, use of flashbacks, his use of fragmentation, and his lyricism. A character in Charles Bukowski&#x27;s book &quot;Women&quot; referred to him as the greatest writer who has ever lived.

A fifteen-volume edition of Hamsun&#x27;s complete works was published in 1954. In 2009, to mark the 150th anniversary of his birth, a new 27-volume edition of his complete works was published, including short stories, poetry, plays, and articles not included in the 1954 edition. For this new edition, all of Hamsun&#x27;s works underwent slight linguistic modifications in order to make them more accessible to contemporary Norwegian readers. Fresh English translations of two of his major works, &quot;Growth of the Soil&quot; and &quot;Pan&quot;, were published in 1998.

Hamsun&#x27;s works remain popular. In 2009, a Norwegian biographer stated, &quot;We can’t help loving him, though we have hated him all these years ... That’s our Hamsun trauma. He’s a ghost that won’t stay in the grave.&quot;

Three of Hamsun&#x27;s homes (Hamsund gård in Hamarøy Municipality, Hamsunstugu in Garmo in Lom Municipality, and Nørholm in Grimstad Municipality) are open to the public as museums, in addition to the Knut Hamsun Centre in Hamarøy.

The whereabouts of Hamsun&#x27;s Nobel Prize medal remain unknown.

==Writing techniques==
Along with August Strindberg, Henrik Ibsen, and Sigrid Undset, Hamsun formed a quartet of Scandinavian authors who became internationally known for their works. Hamsun pioneered psychological literature with techniques of stream of consciousness and interior monologue, as found in material by, for example, Joyce, Proust, Mansfield and Woolf. His writing also had a major influence on Franz Kafka.

==Personal life==

In 1898, Hamsun married Bergljot Göpfert (née Bech), who bore daughter Victoria, but the marriage ended in 1906. Hamsun then married Marie Andersen (1881–1969) in 1909 and she was his companion until the end of his life. They had four children: sons Tore and Arild and daughters Ellinor and Cecilia.

Marie wrote about her life with Hamsun in two memoirs. She was a promising actress when she met Hamsun but ended her career and traveled with him to Hamarøy. They bought a farm, the idea being &quot;to earn their living as farmers, with his writing providing some additional income&quot;.

After a few years they decided to move south, to Larvik. In 1918 they bought Nørholm, an old, somewhat dilapidated manor house between Lillesand and Grimstad. The main residence was restored and redecorated. Here Hamsun could occupy himself with writing undisturbed, although he often travelled to write in other cities and places (preferably in spartan housing).

==Racism and admiration for Hitler==
From his youth onward, Hamsun espoused anti-egalitarian and racist beliefs. In &quot;The Cultural Life of Modern America&quot; (1889), he expressed his firm opposition to miscegenation: &quot;The Negros are and will remain Negros, a nascent human form from the tropics, rudimentary organs on the body of white society. Instead of founding an intellectual elite, America has established a mulatto studfarm.&quot;

Hamsun wrote several newspaper articles in the course of the Second World War, including his notorious 1940 assertion that &quot;the Germans are fighting for us, and now are crushing England&#x27;s tyranny over us and all neutrals&quot;. In 1943, he sent Germany&#x27;s minister of propaganda Joseph Goebbels his Nobel Prize medal as a gift. His biographer Thorkild Hansen interpreted this as part of the strategy to get an audience with Hitler. Hamsun was eventually invited to meet with Hitler; during the meeting, he complained about the German civilian administrator in Norway, Josef Terboven, and asked that imprisoned Norwegian citizens be released, enraging Hitler. Otto Dietrich describes the meeting in his memoirs as the only time that another person was able to get a word in edgeways with Hitler. He attributes this to Hamsun&#x27;s deafness. Regardless, Dietrich notes that it took Hitler three days to get over his anger. Hamsun also on other occasions helped Norwegians who had been imprisoned for resistance activities and tried to influence German policies in Norway.

Nevertheless, a week after Hitler&#x27;s death, Hamsun wrote a eulogy for him, saying “He was a warrior, a warrior for mankind, and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations.” Following the end of the war, angry crowds burned his books in public in major Norwegian cities and Hamsun was confined for several months in a psychiatric hospital.

Hamsun was forced to undergo a psychiatric examination, which concluded that he had &quot;permanently impaired mental faculties,&quot; and on that basis the charges of treason were dropped. Instead, a civil liability case was raised against him, and in 1948 he had to pay a ruinous sum to the Norwegian government of 325,000 kroner ($65,000 or £16,250 at that time) for his alleged membership in Nasjonal Samling and for the moral support he gave to the Germans, but was cleared of any direct Nazi affiliation. Whether he was a member of Nasjonal Samling or not and whether his mental abilities were impaired is a much debated issue even today. Hamsun stated he was never a member of any political party. He wrote his last book &quot;Paa giengrodde Stier&quot; (&quot;On Overgrown Paths&quot;) in 1949, a book many take as evidence of his functioning mental capabilities. In it, he harshly criticizes the psychiatrists and the judges and, in his own words, proves that he is not mentally ill.

The Danish author Thorkild Hansen investigated the trial and wrote the book &quot;The Hamsun Trial&quot; (1978), which created a storm in Norway. Among other things Hansen stated: &quot;If you want to meet idiots, go to Norway,&quot; as he felt that such treatment of the old Nobel Prize-winning author was outrageous. In 1996, Swedish filmmaker Jan Troell based the movie &quot;Hamsun&quot; on Hansen&#x27;s book. In &quot;Hamsun&quot;, Swedish actor Max von Sydow plays Knut Hamsun; his wife Marie is played by Danish actress Ghita Nørby.

==Studies on Hamsun&#x27;s writings==
Hamsun&#x27;s writings have been the subject of numerous books and journal articles. Some of these writings explore the dialectic between Hamsun&#x27;s literary works and his political and cultural leanings expressed in his non-fiction.

Hamsun produced a voluminous correspondence during his lifetime. Norwegian scholar and Hamsun expert Harald Næss spent four decades tracking these letters down in both the United States and Europe, producing a collection of thousands of letters. He would publish a selection in various volumes between 1994 and 2000.

==Film and TV adaptations==
Prime among all of Hamsun&#x27;s works adapted to film is &quot;Hunger&quot;, a 1966 film starring Per Oscarsson. It is still considered one of the top film adaptations of any Hamsun works. Hamsun&#x27;s works have been the basis of 25 films and television mini-series adaptations, starting in 1916.

The book &quot;Mysteries&quot; was the basis of a 1978 film of the same name (by the Dutch film company Sigma Pictures), directed by Paul de Lussanet, starring Sylvia Kristel, Rutger Hauer, Andrea Ferreol and Rita Tushingham.

&quot;Landstrykere&quot; (&quot;Wayfarers&quot;) is a Norwegian film from 1990 directed by Ola Solum.

&quot;The Telegraphist&quot; is a Norwegian movie from 1993 directed by Erik Gustavson. It is based on the novel &quot;Dreamers&quot; (&quot;Sværmere&quot;, also published in English as &quot;Mothwise&quot;).

&quot;Pan&quot; has been the basis of four films between 1922 and 1995. The latest adaptation, the Danish film of the same name, was directed by Henning Carlsen, who also directed the Danish, Norwegian and Swedish coproduction of the 1966 film &quot;Sult&quot; from Hamsun&#x27;s novel of the same name.

Remodernist filmmaker Jesse Richards has announced he is in preparations to direct an adaptation of Hamsun&#x27;s short story &quot;The Call of Life&quot;.

==Cinematized biography==
A biopic, &quot;Hamsun&quot;, was released in 1996, directed by Jan Troell. It stars Max von Sydow as Hamsun.

<text>Karen Alexandria Kain (born March 28, 1951) is a Canadian former ballet dancer and was the Artistic Director of the National Ballet of Canada from 2005 to 2021.

==Early training and childhood==
Kain&#x27;s mother enrolled her daughter in ballet training because she believed it would improve her postural alignment, poise, and discipline. The family moved from Ancaster to Erindale Woodlands, Toronto Township when Kain was in grade 6 (age 11, 1962) so she could begin training at the National Ballet School of Canada. (The majority of Toronto Township, including Erindale Woodlands, is now Mississauga.) Upon graduating in 1969, she was invited to join the National Ballet of Canada. She also participated in Girl Guides of Canada programs as a member.

==Career==
Kain became a principal dancer in 1971, performing central roles in a wide array of ballets, eventually becoming well known in Canada, with the help of legendary dancer Rudolf Nureyev. She worked as a guest artist with Roland Petit&#x27;s Ballet National de Marseilles, the Bolshoi Ballet, the London Festival Ballet, the Paris Opera Ballet, the Hamburg Ballet, the Vienna State Opera Ballet, and the Eliot Feld Ballet. Kain is a subject of The Portraits of Andy Warhol, 1980.

During her career, she performed in many ballets from classical and modern repertoire including among others &quot;Swan Lake&quot; (Erik Bruhn) &quot;Coppélia&quot;, &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; (Rudolph Nureyev), &quot;Giselle&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (John Cranko), &quot;La fille mal gardée&quot;, &quot;Onegin&quot; (John Cranko), &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; (John Cranko), &quot;Pastorale&quot; (James Kudelka), &quot;Carmen&quot; (Roland Petit), &quot;Concerto Barocco&quot; (Balanchine), &quot;A Month in the Country&quot; (Frederick Ashton) and &quot;Nutcracker&quot; in which she was often paired with dancer Frank Augustyn. The talent of Kain and Augustyn came to the attention of the public and peers as soon as 1973 when they won prizes at the 1973 Moscow International Ballet Competition.

In 1977, Kain stopped dancing, but started again in 1981 with the National Ballet of Canada, where she performed for 15 more years. In 1996, Kain reunited with Frank Augustyn to appear in her husband Ross Petty&#x27;s panto production of &quot;Robin Hood&quot; at Toronto&#x27;s Elgin Theatre. Kain retired as a professional dancer in 1997.

In 1998, she returned to the National Ballet of Canada as part of the senior management team, in the role of artistic associate. She supported artistic director James Kudelka against principal dancer Kimberley Glasco in a wrongful-dismissal suit. In 2005, she succeeded Kudelka as artistic director. She stepped down from that role in 2021.

Kain served as a president of the jury at the Prix de Lausanne ballet competition in 2009.

Kain was the founding board president of Canada&#x27;s Dancer Transition Resource Centre. Kain&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Movement Never Lies&quot;, was published in 1994 by McClelland and Stewart.

==Awards==
In 1973, she won silver in the women&#x27;s competition and the first prize for best pas de deux (with Frank Augustyn) at the second International Ballet Competition in Moscow dancing the Bluebird pas de deux from Sleeping Beauty.

In 1976, she was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada (OC) and was made a Companion of the Order of Canada (CC) in 1991. She was made a member of the Order of Ontario in 1990. She holds honorary degrees from the University of Toronto, York University, McMaster University, Trent University, and the University of British Columbia. In May 1998, the French Government named her an Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters. Among Kain&#x27;s other honours are the National Arts Centre Award, a companion award of the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Awards (1997) and the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement (2002). In 1996, she became the first Canadian to receive the Cartier Lifetime Achievement Award. The choreographer Marguerite Derricks cited Kain as one of her heroes. in 1989 the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation made a documentary about her, &quot;Karen Kain, Prima Ballerina&quot;. In 2002, she received the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal.

Kain had an arts based public middle school in Etobicoke named after her (Karen Kain School of the Arts) in 2008. In 2012, Kain received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal. In 1998, she was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

===Honorary postage stamp===
In April 2021, Kain was recognized by Canada Post as a &quot;legend of ballet&quot; for her lifetime of artistic achievements with a permanent domestic stamp displaying a ballet leap.

==Personal life==
Kain has been married since 1983 to Ross Petty, a stage and film actor, and producer of theatrical pantomime productions in Canada for over 20 years. Kain&#x27;s brother, Kevin Kain, is a noted tropical medicine expert based in Toronto, Ontario; she has three younger siblings and two nephews - Dylan and Taylor Kain.

==Other==
In 1976, Kain appeared in a televised version of the ballet &quot;Giselle&quot; in the highly coveted title role, alongside Nadia Potts, Frank Augustyn, and Anne Ditchburn. The production was first shown in 1986. In 1985, Kain starred in an episode of the popular Canadian TV series &quot;Seeing Things&quot;. Kain was also alluded to in the 2003 movie directed by Denys Arcand, &quot;The Barbarian Invasions&quot;, when Rémy Girard reminisced about his past love affairs. Kain did a TV commercial for The Art Shoppe, a furniture store in Toronto during the 1970s

Kain&#x27;s production of &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, her final project as the artistic director for the National Ballet of Canada before her retirement, is profiled in Chelsea McMullan&#x27;s 2023 documentary film &quot;Swan Song&quot;.

<text>A is a set of companies with interlocking business relationships and shareholdings that dominated the Japanese economy in the second half of the 20th century. In the legal sense, it is a type of business group that is in a loosely organized alliance within Japan&#x27;s business community. It rose up to replace the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; system that was dissolved in the occupation of Japan following the Second World War. Though their influence has shrunk since the late 20th century, they continue to be important forces in Japan&#x27;s economy in the early 21st century.

The members&#x27; companies own small portions of the shares in each other&#x27;s companies, centered on a core bank; this system helps insulate each company from stock market fluctuations and takeover attempts, thus enabling long-term planning in projects.

==Origins==
The prototypical &quot;keiretsu&quot; appeared during the Japanese economic miracle which followed World War II, amid the dissolution of family-controlled vertical monopolies called &quot;zaibatsu&quot;.

The &quot;zaibatsu&quot; had been at the heart of economic and industrial activity within the Empire of Japan since Japanese industrialization accelerated during the Meiji era. They held great influence over Japanese national and foreign policies which only increased following the Japanese victories in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905 and World War I. During the inter-war period the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; aided Japanese militarism and benefited from their conquest of East Asia by receiving lucrative contracts.
After the surrender of Japan the Allied occupation forces partially attempted to dissolve the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; which had worked closely with the militarists during the first half of the 20th century and during the war. However, the United States government later rescinded those orders in an effort to reindustrialize Japan as a bulwark against communism in Asia, so the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; were never completely dissolved.

==Types==
The two types of &quot;keiretsu&quot;, horizontal and vertical, can be further categorized as:
* 

===Horizontal &quot;keiretsu&quot;===
The primary aspect of a horizontal&quot; keiretsu&quot; (also known as financial &quot;keiretsu&quot;) is that it is set up around a Japanese bank through cross-shareholding relationships with other companies. The bank assists these companies with a range of financial services. The leading horizontal Japanese &quot;keiretsu&quot;, also referred to as the &quot;Big Six&quot;, include: Fuyo, Sanwa, Sumitomo, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and DKB Group. Horizontal &quot;keiretsu&quot; may also have vertical relationships, called branches.

Horizontal &quot;keiretsu&quot; peaked around 1988, when over half of the value in the Japanese stock market consisted of cross-shareholdings. Since then, banks have gradually reduced their cross-shareholdings. The Japanese corporate governance code, effective from June 2015, requires listed companies to disclose a rationale for their cross-shareholdings. Partly as a result of this requirement, the four Japanese &quot;megabanks&quot; descended from the six major &quot;keiretsu&quot; banks (namely Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Group and Mizuho Financial Group) have indicated plans to further reduce their balance of cross-shareholding investments.

Membership in horizontal &quot;keiretsu&quot; is often loose and often not something considered in day-to-day decision making by its members.

===Vertical &quot;keiretsu&quot;===
Vertical &quot;keiretsu&quot; (also known as industrial or distribution&quot; keiretsu&quot;) are used to link suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors of one industry. Banks have less influence on vertical &quot;keiretsu&quot;. Examples of this type include Toyota, Toshiba, and Nissan. One or more sub-companies, arranged in tiers of importance, are created to benefit the parent company. Major suppliers form the second tier beneath the parent, and smaller manufacturing companies make up the third and fourth tiers. Those at the highest levels are most profitable, and most insulated from fluctuations in the market.

Some vertical &quot;keiretsu&quot; may belong to one or another horizontal &quot;keiretsu&quot;. Some vertical &quot;keiretsu&quot; are family businesses, such as the Hitotsubashi/Shogakukan, Otowa/Kodansha and APA groups. Studies have found these vertical &quot;keiretsus,&quot; particularly those that belong to the same horizontal &quot;keiretsu&quot;, are more likely to form alliances than the other types or even those companies where one or two have &quot;keiretsu&quot; affiliations. Vertical &quot;keiretsu&quot; is considered an effective and competitive organizational model in the car industry.

== History ==
During the occupation of Japan, under the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, General Douglas MacArthur, a partially successful attempt was made to dissolve the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; in the late 1940s. Sixteen &quot;zaibatsu&quot; were targeted for complete dissolution, and 26 more for reorganization after dissolution. However, the companies formed from the dismantling of the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; were later reintegrated. The dispersed corporations were reinterlinked through share purchases to form horizontally integrated alliances across many industries. Where possible, &quot;keiretsu&quot; companies would also supply one another, making the alliances vertically integrated, as well. In this period, official government policy promoted the creation of robust trade corporations that could withstand heavy pressures from intensified trade competition.

The major &quot;keiretsu&quot; were each centered on one bank, which lent money to the &quot;keiretsu&quot; member companies and held equity positions in the companies. Each bank had great control over the companies in the &quot;keiretsu&quot; and acted as a monitoring and emergency bail-out entity. One effect of this structure was to minimize the presence of hostile takeovers in Japan, because no entities could challenge the power of the banks.
Although the divisions between them have blurred in recent years, there have been eight major postwar &quot;keiretsu&quot;.

Toyota is considered the biggest of the vertically integrated &quot;keiretsu&quot; groups, although the company is rather considered as a &quot;emerged&quot; &quot;keiretsu&quot;, along with Softbank, Seven &amp; I Holdings Co. The banks at the top are not as large as normally required, so it is actually considered to be more horizontally integrated than other &quot;keiretsu&quot;.

The Japanese recession in the 1990s had profound effects on the &quot;keiretsu&quot;. Many of the largest banks were hit hard by bad loan portfolios and forced to merge or go out of business. This had the effect of blurring the lines between the individual &quot;keiretsu&quot;: Sumitomo Bank and Mitsui Bank, for instance, became Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in 2001, while Sanwa Bank (the banker for the Hankyu-Toho Group) became part of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.

Generally, these causes gave rise to a strong notion in the Japanese business community that the old &quot;keiretsu&quot; system was not an effective business model, and led to an overall loosening of &quot;keiretsu&quot; alliances. While they still exist, they are not as centralized or integrated as they were before the 2000s. For instance, many troubled Japanese companies are faced with a new reality in which receiving financial support from their main banks is getting harder and unlikelier than ever before. The companies include Sharp Corporation and Toshiba, both the iconic Japanese corporations that were forced to accept foreign investment in their aftermath of financial difficulties in 2010s.

This changed environment, in turn, has led to a growing corporate acquisition industry in Japan, as companies are no longer able to be easily &quot;bailed out&quot; by their banks, as well as rising derivative litigation by more independent shareholders.

===United States–Japan bilateral relationship===

By April 2015, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman and Japanese Economy Minister Akira Amari, representing the two largest economies of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, were involved in bilateral talks regarding agriculture and auto parts, the &quot;two largest obstacles for Japan.&quot; These bilateral accords would open each other&#x27;s markets for products such as rice, pork and automobiles.

During the two-day ministerial TPP negotiating session held in Singapore in May 2015, veteran US negotiator Wendy Cutler and Oe Hiroshi of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs held bilateral trade talks regarding one of the most contentious trade issues, automobiles. American negotiators wanted the Japanese to open their entire &quot;keiretsu&quot; structure, a cornerstone of the Japanese economy, to American automobiles. They wanted Japanese dealer networks such as Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi, and Mazda to sell American cars. The successful conclusion of these bilateral talks was necessary before the other ten TPP members could complete the trade deal.

===Outside Japan===
The &quot;keiretsu&quot; model is fairly unique to Japan. However, many diversified non-Japanese businesses groups have been described as &quot;keiretsu&quot;, such as the Virgin Group (UK), Tata Group (India), the Colombian Grupo Empresarial Antioqueño and the Venezuelan Grupo Cisneros.

The automotive and banking industries have created broad cross-ownership networks across nations, but the national companies are normally independently managed. Banks cited as being central to &quot;keiretsu&quot;-like systems include Deutsche Bank and some &quot;keiretsu&quot;-like systems, generally referred to as trusts, were created by investment banks in the United States such as JP Morgan and Mellon Financial/Mellon family beginning in the late 19th century (roughly the same period they were created in Japan), but they were largely curtailed through anti-trust legislation championed by Theodore Roosevelt in the early part of the 20th century. A form of &quot;keiretsu&quot; can also be found in the cross-shareholdings of the large media companies throughout most developed nations. These are largely designed to link content producers to particular distribution channels, and larger content projects, such as expensive movies, are often incorporated with ownership spread across a number of larger companies.

==Contrarian view==
Harvard Law School professor J. Mark Ramseyer and University of Tokyo professor Yoshiro Miwa have argued that the postwar &quot;keiretsu&quot; are a &quot;fable&quot; created by Marxist thinkers in the 1960s so as to argue that monopoly capital dominated the Japanese economy. They point to the sparsity and tenuousness of cross-shareholding relationships within the &quot;keiretsu&quot;, the inconsistency in members&#x27; relationships with the &quot;main banks&quot; of each &quot;keiretsu&quot;, and the lack of power and reach of the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; alumni &quot;lunch clubs&quot; which are often argued to form a core of &quot;keiretsu&quot; governance. This contrarian view has been disputed.

<text>Kurt Georg Kiesinger (; 6 April 1904 – 9 March 1988) was a German politician who served as the chancellor of West Germany from 1 December 1966 to 21 October 1969. Before he became Chancellor he served as Minister-President of Baden-Württemberg from 1958 to 1966 and as President of the Federal Council from 1962 to 1963. He was Chairman of the Christian Democratic Union from 1967 to 1971.

Kiesinger gained his certificate as a lawyer in March 1933 and worked as a lawyer in Berlin&#x27;s Kammergericht court from 1935 to 1940. He had joined the Nazi Party in 1933, but remained a largely inactive member. To avoid conscription, in 1940 he was appointed to the broadcast policy department of the Foreign Office by Joachim von Ribbentrop, and became deputy head of the broadcasting and propaganda departments in 1942. In 1946 he became a member of the Christian Democratic Union. He was elected to the Bundestag in 1949, and was a member of the Bundestag until 1958 and again from 1969 to 1980. He left federal politics for eight years (from 1958 to 1966) to serve as Minister-President of Baden-Württemberg, and subsequently became Chancellor by forming a grand coalition with Willy Brandt&#x27;s Social Democratic Party.

Kiesinger was considered an outstanding orator and mediator, and was dubbed &quot;Chief Silver Tongue&quot;. He was an author of poetry and various books, and founded the universities of Konstanz and Ulm as Minister-President of Baden-Württemberg. Kiesinger is also considered controversial, which is mainly due to his affiliation and work with the Nazis. The student movement in particular, but also other sections of the population, saw Kiesinger as a politician who stood for the inadequacy of Germans&#x27; coming to terms with the past.

==Early life and Nazi activities==
Kurt Georg Kiesinger was born in Ebingen, Kingdom of Württemberg (now Albstadt, Baden-Württemberg). His father was a commercial clerk in companies engaged in the local textile industry. Kiesinger was baptized Catholic because his mother was Catholic, though his father was Protestant. His mother died six months after he was born. His maternal grandmother exerted a strong influence on Kiesinger and encouraged him, while his father was indifferent to his advancement. After a year, his father was remarried to a Karoline Victoria Pfaff. They had seven children, of whom Kiesinger&#x27;s half-sister Maria died a year after she was born. Pfaff was also a Catholic. Kiesinger was therefore shaped by both denominations and later referred to himself gladly as a &quot;Protestant Catholic&quot;. Politically, Kiesinger grew up in a liberal, democratically-minded milieu.

Kiesinger studied law in Berlin and worked as a then as lawyer in Berlin from 1935 to 1940. As a student, he joined the (non-&quot;couleur&quot; wearing) Roman Catholic corporations &quot;KStV Alamannia Tübingen&quot; and Askania-Burgundia Berlin. He became a member of the Nazi Party in February 1933, but remained a largely inactive member. In 1940, he was called to arms but avoided mobilization by finding a job in the Foreign Office&#x27;s broadcasting department, rising quickly to become deputy head of the department from 1943 to 1945 and the department&#x27;s liaison with the Propaganda Ministry. He worked under Joachim von Ribbentrop, who would later be condemned to death at Nuremberg. After the war, he was interned by the Americans for his connection to Ribbentrop and spent 18 months in the Ludwigsburg camp before being released as a case of mistaken identity.

Franco-German journalist Beate Klarsfeld demonstrated Kiesinger&#x27;s close connections to Ribbentrop and Joseph Goebbels, the head of Nazi Germany&#x27;s Propaganda Ministry. She also asserted that Kiesinger had been chiefly responsible for the contents of German international broadcasts which included anti-Semitic and war propaganda, and had collaborated closely with SS functionaries and Franz Alfred Six. The latter was responsible for mass murders in Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe and was tried as a war criminal in the &quot;Einsatzgruppen Trial&quot; at Nuremberg. Even after becoming aware of the extermination of the Jews, Kiesinger had continued to produce anti-Semitic propaganda. These allegations were based in part on documents that Albert Norden published about the culprits of war and Nazi crimes.

==Early political career==
Kiesinger joined the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in 1946. From 1946 he gave private lessons to law students, and in 1948 he resumed his practice as a lawyer. In 1947 he also became unpaid secretary-general of the CDU in Württemberg-Hohenzollern.

In the federal election in 1949 he was elected to the Bundestag, in which he went on to sit until 1958 and again from 1969 to 1980. In his first legislative term he represented the constituency of Ravensburg, in which he achieved record results of over 70 percent, from 1969 the constituency of Waldshut. For the 1976 federal election, Kiesinger renounced his own constituency and entered parliament via the Baden-Württemberg state list of his party. In the first two legislative periods (1949–1957) he was chairman of the mediation committee of the Bundestag and Bundesrat. On 19 October 1950, Kiesinger received 55 votes against his party friend Hermann Ehlers (201 votes) in the election for President of the Bundestag, although he had not been proposed. In 1951 he became a member of the CDU executive board. From 17 December 1954 to 29 January 1959, he was chairman of the Bundestag Committee on Foreign Affairs, to which he had been a member since 1949.

During that time, he became known for his rhetorical brilliance, as well as his in-depth knowledge of foreign affairs. However, despite the recognition he enjoyed within the Christian Democrat parliamentary faction, he was passed over during various cabinet reshuffles. Consequently, he decided to switch from federal to state politics.

==Minister-President of Baden-Württemberg==
Kiesinger became Minister-President of the state of Baden-Württemberg on 17 December 1958, an office in which he served until 1 December 1966. At that time Kiesinger was also a member of the Landtag of Baden-Württemberg. As Minister-President he was President of the German Bundesrat from 1 November 1962 to 31 October 1963. During his time in office the state founded two universities, the University of Konstanz and the University of Ulm.

In the early days of the Federal Republic of Germany, oversized coalitions were not uncommon at the state level, and so Kiesinger led a coalition of the CDU, SPD, FDP/DVP and BHE until 1960, but then a CDU/CSU-FDP coalition, coalition from 1960 to 1966. On 15 April 1961, the BHE disbanded.

==Chancellorship==


In 1966, following the collapse of the existing CDU/CSU-FDP coalition in the Bundestag, Kiesinger was elected to replace Ludwig Erhard as Federal Chancellor, heading a new CDU/CSU-SPD alliance with the SPD leader Willy Brandt as Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister. The Kiesinger government remained in power for nearly three years. Kiesinger reduced tensions with the Soviet bloc nations, establishing diplomatic relations with Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia, but he opposed any major conciliatory moves. A number of progressive reforms were also realised during Kiesinger&#x27;s time as Chancellor. Pension coverage was extended in 1967 via the abolition of the income-ceiling for compulsory membership. In education, student grants were introduced, together with a university building programme, while a constitutional reform of 1969 empowered the federal government to be involved with the Länder in educational planning through joint planning commission. Vocational training legislation was also introduced, while a reorganisation of unemployment insurance promoted retraining schemes, counselling and advice services, and job creation places. In addition, under the &quot;Lohnfortzahlunggesetz&quot; of 1969, employers had to pay all employees’ wages for the first six weeks of sickness. In August 1969, the &quot;Landabgaberente&quot; (a higher special pension for farmers willing to cede farms that were unprofitable according to certain criteria) was introduced.

The historian Tony Judt has observed that Kiesinger&#x27;s chancellorship, like the presidency of Heinrich Lübke, showed the &quot;a glaring contradiction in the Bonn Republic&#x27;s self-image&quot; in view of their previous Nazi allegiances. One of his low points as Chancellor was in 1968 when Nazi-hunter Beate Klarsfeld, who campaigned with her husband Serge Klarsfeld against Nazi criminals, publicly slapped him in the face during the 1968 Christian Democrat convention, while calling him a Nazi. She did so in French and, whilst being dragged out of the room by two ushers, repeated her words in German, saying &quot;Kiesinger! Nazi! Abtreten!&quot; (&quot;Kiesinger! Nazi! Step down!&quot;) Kiesinger, holding his left cheek, did not respond. Up to his death he refused to comment on the incident, and in other opportunities he denied explicitly that he had been opportunistic by joining the NSDAP in 1933 (although he admitted to joining the German Foreign Ministry to dodge his 1940 draft by the Wehrmacht). Other prominent critics included the writers Heinrich Böll and Günter Grass. (In 1966, Grass had written an open letter urging Kiesinger not to accept the chancellorship). In 2006, 40 years later, Grass, in an interview with the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;, would confess to a Waffen-SS membership, which became a controversy on its own. 

After the election of 1969, the SPD preferred to form a coalition with the FDP, ending the uninterrupted post-war reign of the CDU chancellors. Kiesinger was succeeded as Chancellor by his former Vice-Chancellor Willy Brandt.

==Later years and death==

Kiesinger continued to head the CDU/CSU in opposition and remained a member of the Bundestag until 1980. In July 1971 Kiesinger was succeeded as Leader of the Christian Democratic Union by Rainer Barzel. In 1972 he held the main speech for justification to the constructive vote of no confidence by the CDU/CSU parliamentary group against Willy Brandt in the Bundestag. The election of then CDU leader Rainer Barzel as chancellor was unsuccessful because of the bribery of Julius Steiner and probably Leo Wagner by GDR&#x27;s Stasi.

In 1980 Kiesinger ended his career as politician and worked on his memoir. Of his planned memoirs, only the first part (&quot;Dark and Bright Years&quot;) was completed, covering the years up to 1958. It was released after his death in 1989. Kiesinger died in Tübingen on 9 March 1988, 28 days short of his 84th birthday. After a requiem mass in Stuttgart&#x27;s St. Eberhard Church, his funeral procession was followed by protesters (mainly students) who wanted his former membership in the Nazi Party remembered.

<text>A lynx ( ; : lynx or lynxes) is any of the four species (the Canada lynx, Iberian lynx, Eurasian lynx and the bobcat) within the medium-sized wild cat genus Lynx. The name originated in Middle English via Latin from the Greek word (), derived from the Indo-European root (, ), in reference to the luminescence of its reflective eyes.

== Appearance ==

Lynx have a short tail, characteristic tufts of black hair on the tips of their ears, large, padded paws for walking on snow and long whiskers on the face. Under their neck, they have a ruff, which has black bars resembling a bow tie, although this is often not visible.

Body colour varies from medium brown to goldish to beige-white, and is occasionally marked with dark brown spots, especially on the limbs. All species of lynx have white fur on their chests, bellies and on the insides of their legs, fur which is an extension of the chest and belly fur. The lynx&#x27;s colouring, fur length and paw size vary according to the climate in their range. In the Southwestern United States, they are short-haired, dark in colour and their paws are smaller and less padded. In colder northern climates lynx have thicker and lighter fur as well as larger and more padded paws that are well-adapted to snow.

The smallest species are the bobcat and the Canada lynx, while the largest is the Eurasian lynx, with considerable variations within species.

== Species ==
All living species of &quot;Lynx&quot; are thought to descend from &quot;Lynx issiodorensis,&quot; which first appeared during the early Pliocene in Africa, around 4 million years ago, shortly afterwards dispersing into Eurasia. The bobcat is thought to have arised from a dispersal across the Bering Land Bridge during the Early Pleistocene, around 2.5-2.4 million years ago, with the Iberian lynx suggested to have speciated around 1 million years ago, at the end of the Early Pleistocene, the Eurasian lynx is thought to have evolved from Asian populations of &quot;Lynx issidorensis&quot;. The Canada lynx is thought to descend from a separate later migration of Eurasian lynx over the Bering Land Bridge around 200,000 years ago.

The Pliocene felid &quot;Felis rexroadensis&quot; from North America has been proposed as an even earlier ancestor; however, this was larger than any living species, and is not currently classified as a true lynx. Another extinct species of &quot;Lynx&quot;, &quot;L. shansius&quot;, inhabited what is now northern China during the Early Pleistocene, though this species is considered by some researchers to be a junior synonym of &quot;L. issiodorensis&quot;.

=== Eurasian lynx ===
Of the four lynx species, the Eurasian lynx (&quot;Lynx lynx&quot;) is the largest in size. It is native to European, Central Asian, and Siberian forests. While its conservation status has been classified as &quot;least concern&quot;, populations of Eurasian lynx have been reduced or extirpated from much of Europe, where it is now being reintroduced.
During the summer, the Eurasian lynx has a relatively short, reddish or brown coat which is replaced by a much thicker silver-grey to greyish-brown coat during winter. The lynx hunts by stalking and jumping on its prey, helped by the rugged, forested country in which it resides. A favorite prey for the lynx in its woodland habitat is roe deer. It will feed however on whatever animal appears easiest, as it is an opportunistic predator much like its cousins.

=== Canada lynx ===

The Canada lynx (&quot;Lynx canadensis&quot;), or Canadian lynx, is a North American felid that ranges in forest and tundra regions across Canada and into Alaska, as well as some parts of the northern United States. Historically, the Canadian lynx ranged from Alaska across Canada and into many of the northern U.S. states. In the eastern states, it resided in the transition zone in which boreal coniferous forests yielded to deciduous forests. By 2010, after an 11-year effort, it had been successfully reintroduced into Colorado, where it had become extirpated in the 1970s. In 2000, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service designated the Canada lynx a threatened species in the lower 48 states.

The Canada lynx is a good climber and swimmer; it constructs rough shelters under fallen trees or rock ledges. It has a thick coat and broad paws, and is twice as effective as the bobcat at supporting its weight on the snow. The Canada lynx feeds almost exclusively on snowshoe hares; its population is highly dependent on the population of this prey animal. It will also hunt medium-sized mammals and birds if hare numbers fall.

=== Iberian lynx ===

The Iberian lynx (&quot;Lynx pardinus&quot;) is a vulnerable species native to the Iberian Peninsula in Southern Europe. It was the most endangered cat species in the world, but conservation efforts have changed its status from critical to endangered to vulnerable. The loss of the species would have been the first feline extinction since the &quot;Smilodon&quot; 10,000 years ago. The species used to be classified as a subspecies of the Eurasian lynx, but is now considered a separate species. Both species occurred together in central Europe in the Pleistocene epoch, being separated by habitat choice. The Iberian lynx is believed to have evolved from &quot;Lynx issiodorensis&quot;.

=== Bobcat ===

The bobcat (&quot;Lynx rufus&quot;) is a North American wild cat. With 13 recognized subspecies, the bobcat is common throughout southern Canada, the continental United States, and northern Mexico. Like the Eurasian lynx, its conservation status is &quot;least concern.&quot; The bobcat is an adaptable predator that inhabits deciduous, coniferous, or mixed woodlands, but unlike other &quot;Lynx&quot;, does not depend exclusively on the deep forest, and ranges from swamps and desert lands to mountainous and agricultural areas, its spotted coat serving as camouflage. The population of the bobcat depends primarily on the population of its prey. Nonetheless, the bobcat is often killed by larger predators such as coyotes.

The bobcat resembles other species of the genus &quot;Lynx&quot;, but is on average the smallest of the four. Its coat is variable, though generally tan to grayish brown, with black streaks on the body and dark bars on the forelegs and tail. The ears are black-tipped and pointed, with short, black tufts. There is generally an off-white color on the lips, chin, and underparts. Bobcats in the desert regions of the southwest have the lightest-colored coats, while those in the northern, forested regions have the darkest.

== Behavior and diet ==
The lynx is usually solitary, although a small group of lynx may travel and hunt together occasionally. Mating takes place in the late winter and once a year the female gives birth to between one and four kittens. The gestation time of the lynx is about 70 days. The young stay with the mother for one more winter, a total of around nine months, before moving out to live on their own as young adults. The lynx creates its den in crevices or under ledges. It feeds on a wide range of animals from white-tailed deer, reindeer, roe deer, small red deer, and chamois, to smaller, more usual prey: snowshoe hares, fish, foxes, sheep, squirrels, mice, turkeys and other birds, and goats. It also eats ptarmigans, voles, and grouse.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The lynx inhabits high altitude forests with dense cover of shrubs, reeds, and tall grass. Although this cat hunts on the ground, it can climb trees and can swim swiftly, catching fish.

=== Europe and Asia ===
The Eurasian lynx ranges from central and northern Europe across Asia up to Northern Pakistan and India. In Iran, they live in Mount Damavand area. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the Eurasian lynx was considered extinct in the wild in Slovenia and Croatia. A resettlement project, begun in 1973, has successfully reintroduced lynx to the Slovenian Alps and the Croatian regions of Gorski Kotar and Velebit, including Croatia&#x27;s Plitvice Lakes National Park and Risnjak National Park. In both countries, the lynx is listed as an endangered species and protected by law. The lynx was distributed throughout Japan during Jōmon period; with no paleontological evidence thereafter suggesting extinction at that time.

Several lynx resettlement projects begun in the 1970s have been successful in various regions of Switzerland. Since the 1990s, there have been numerous efforts to resettle the Eurasian lynx in Germany, and since 2000, a small population can now be found in the Harz mountains near Bad Lauterberg.

The lynx is found in the Białowieża Forest in northeastern Poland, and in the northern and western parts of China, particularly the Tibetan Plateau. In Romania, the numbers exceed 2,000, the largest population in Europe outside of Russia, although most experts consider the official population numbers to be overestimated.

The lynx is more common in northern Europe, especially in Norway, Sweden, Estonia, Finland, and the northern parts of Russia. The Swedish population is estimated to be 1200–1500 individuals, spread all over the country, but more common in middle Sweden and in the mountain range. The lynx population in Finland was 1900–2100 individuals in 2008, and the numbers have been increasing every year since 1992. The lynx population in Finland is estimated currently to be larger than ever before. Lynx in Britain were wiped out in the 17th century, but there have been calls to reintroduce them to curb the numbers of deer.

The endangered Iberian lynx lives in southern Spain and formerly in eastern Portugal. There is an Iberian lynx reproduction center outside Silves in the Algarve in southern Portugal.

=== North America ===

The two &quot;Lynx&quot; species in North America, Canada lynx and bobcats, are both found in the temperate zone. While the bobcat is common throughout southern Canada, the continental United States and northern Mexico, the Canada lynx is present mainly in boreal forests of Canada and Alaska.

<doc id="17503" wikidata="Q180910" url="?curid=17503" title="Leisure">
<text>Leisure (, ) has often been defined as a quality of experience or as free time. Free time is time spent away from business, work, job hunting, domestic chores, and education, as well as necessary activities such as eating and sleeping. Leisure as an experience usually emphasizes dimensions of perceived freedom and choice. It is done for &quot;its own sake&quot;, for the quality of experience and involvement. Other classic definitions include Thorstein Veblen&#x27;s (1899) of &quot;nonproductive consumption of time.&quot; Free time is not easy to define due to the multiplicity of approaches used to determine its essence. Different disciplines have definitions reflecting their common issues: for example, sociology on social forces and contexts and psychology as mental and emotional states and conditions. From a research perspective, these approaches have an advantage of being quantifiable and comparable over time and place.

Leisure studies and sociology of leisure are the academic disciplines concerned with the study and analysis of leisure. Recreation differs from leisure in that it is a purposeful activity that includes the experience of leisure in activity contexts. Economists consider that leisure times are valuable to a person like wages. If it were not, people would have worked instead of taking leisure. However, the distinction between leisure and unavoidable activities is not a rigidly defined one, e.g. people sometimes do work-oriented tasks for pleasure as well as for long-term utility. A related concept is social leisure, which involves leisurely activities in social settings, such as extracurricular activities, e.g. sports, clubs. Another related concept is that of family leisure. Relationships with others is usually a major factor in both satisfaction and choice.

The concept of leisure as a human right was realised in article 24 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

== History ==
Leisure has historically been the privilege of the upper class. Opportunities for leisure came with more money, or organization, and less working time, rising dramatically in the mid-to-late 19th century, starting in Great Britain and spreading to other rich nations in Europe. It spread as well to the United States, although that country had a reputation in Europe for providing much less leisure despite its wealth. Immigrants to the United States discovered they had to work harder than they did in Europe. Economists continue to investigate why Americans work longer hours. In a recent book, Laurent Turcot argues that leisure was not created in the 19th century but is imbricated in the occidental world since the beginning of history.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, leisure in the country is related to the decline in work hours and is shaped by moral values, and the ethnic-religious and gender communities. In a cold country with winter&#x27;s long nights, and summer&#x27;s extended daylight, favorite leisure activities include horse racing, team sports such as hockey, singalongs, roller skating and board games. The churches tried to steer leisure activities, by preaching against drinking and scheduling annual revivals and weekly club activities. By 1930 radio played a major role in uniting Canadians behind their local or regional hockey teams. Play-by-play sports coverage, especially of ice hockey, absorbed fans far more intensely than newspaper accounts the next day. Rural areas were especially influenced by sports coverage.

=== France ===
Leisure by the mid-19th century was no longer an individualistic activity. It was increasingly organized. In the French industrial city of Lille, with a population of 80,000 in 1858, the cabarets or taverns for the working class numbered 1300, or one for every three houses. Lille counted 63 drinking and singing clubs, 37 clubs for card players, 23 for bowling, 13 for skittles, and 18 for archery. The churches likewise have their social organizations. Each club had a long roster of officers, and a busy schedule of banquets, festivals and competitions. At the turn of the century thousands of these clubs had been created.

=== United Kingdom ===

As literacy, wealth, ease of travel, and a broadened sense of community grew in Britain from the mid-19th century onward, there was more time and interest in leisure activities of all sorts, on the part of all classes.

Opportunities for leisure activities increased because real wages continued to grow and hours of work continued to decline. In urban Britain, the nine-hour day was increasingly the norm; the 1874 Factory Act limited the workweek to 56.5 hours. The movement toward an eight-hour day. Furthermore, system of routine annual vacations came into play, starting with white-collar workers and moving into the working-class. Some 200 seaside resorts emerged thanks to cheap hotels and inexpensive railway fares, widespread banking holidays and the fading of many religious prohibitions against secular activities on Sundays.

By the late Victorian era, the leisure industry had emerged in all British cities, and the pattern was copied across Western Europe and North America. It provided scheduled entertainment of suitable length and convenient locales at inexpensive prices. These include sporting events, music halls, and popular theater. By 1880 football was no longer the preserve of the social elite, as it attracted large working-class audiences. Average gate was 5,000 in 1905, rising to 23,000 in 1913. That amounted to 6 million paying customers with a weekly turnover of £400,000. Sports by 1900 generated some three percent of the total gross national product in Britain. Professionalization of sports was the norm, although some new activities reached an upscale amateur audience, such as lawn tennis and golf. Women were now allowed in some sports, such as archery, tennis, badminton and gymnastics.

Leisure was primarily a male activity, with middle-class women allowed in at the margins. There were class differences with upper-class clubs, and working-class and middle-class pubs. Heavy drinking declined; there was more betting on outcomes. Participation in sports and all sorts of leisure activities increased for average English people, and their interest in spectator sports increased dramatically.

By the 1920s the cinema and radio attracted all classes, ages, and genders in very large numbers. Giant palaces were built for the huge audiences that wanted to see Hollywood films. In Liverpool 40 percent of the population attended one of the 69 cinemas once a week; 25 percent went twice. Traditionalists grumbled about the American cultural invasion, but the permanent impact was minor.

The British showed a more profound interest in sports, and in greater variety, that any rival. They gave pride of place to such moral issues as sportsmanship and fair play. Cricket became symbolic of the Imperial spirit throughout the Empire. Soccer proved highly attractive to the urban working classes, which introduced the rowdy spectator to the sports world. In some sports, there was significant controversy in the fight for amateur purity especially in rugby and rowing. New games became popular almost overnight, including golf, lawn tennis, cycling and hockey. Women were much more likely to enter these sports than the old established ones. The aristocracy and landed gentry, with their ironclad control over land rights, dominated hunting, shooting, fishing and horse racing.

Cricket had become well-established among the English upper class in the 18th century, and was a major factor in sports competition among the public schools. Army units around the Empire had time on their hands, and encouraged the locals to learn cricket so they could have some entertaining competition. Most of the Empire embraced cricket, with the exception of Canada. Cricket test matches (international) began by the 1870s; the most famous is that between Australia and Britain for &quot;The Ashes&quot;.

== Types ==
The range of leisure activities extends from the very informal and casual to highly organised and long-lasting activities. A significant subset of leisure activities are hobbies which are undertaken for personal satisfaction, usually on a regular basis, and often result in satisfaction through skill development or recognised achievement, sometimes in the form of a product. The list of hobbies is ever changing as society changes.

Substantial and fulfilling hobbies and pursuits are described by Sociologist Robert Stebbins as &quot;serious leisure&quot;. The &quot;serious leisure perspective&quot; is a way of viewing the wide range of leisure pursuits in three main categories: casual leisure, serious leisure, and project-based leisure.

=== Serious leisure ===

&quot;&quot;Serious leisure&quot; is the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer ... that is highly substantial, interesting, and fulfilling and where ... participants find a [leisure] career...&quot;. For example, collecting stamps or maintaining a public wetland area.

People undertaking serious leisure can be categorised as amateurs, volunteers or hobbyists. Their engagement is distinguished from casual leisure by a high level of perseverance, effort, knowledge and training required and durable benefits and the sense that one can create in effect a leisure career through such activity.

The range of serious leisure activities is growing rapidly in modern times with developed societies having greater leisure time, longevity and prosperity. The Internet is providing increased support for amateurs and hobbyists to communicate, display and share products.

==== Reading ====

As literacy and leisure time expanded after 1900, reading became a popular pastime. New additions to adult fiction doubled during the 1920s, reaching 2800 new books a year by 1935. Libraries tripled their stocks, and saw heavy demand for new fiction. A dramatic innovation was the inexpensive paperback, pioneered by Allen Lane (1902–70) at Penguin Books in 1935. The first titles included novels by Ernest Hemingway and Agatha Christie. They were sold cheap (usually sixpence) in a wide variety of inexpensive stores such as Woolworth&#x27;s. Penguin aimed at an educated middle class &quot;middlebrow&quot; audience. It avoided the downscale image of American paperbacks. The line signaled cultural self-improvement and political education. The more polemical Penguin Specials, typically with a leftist orientation for Labour readers, were widely distributed during World War II. However the war years caused a shortage of staff for publishers and book stores, and a severe shortage of rationed paper, worsened by the air raid on Paternoster Square in 1940 that burned 5 million books in warehouses.

Romantic fiction was especially popular, with Mills and Boon the leading publisher. Romantic encounters were embodied in a principle of sexual purity that demonstrated not only social conservatism, but also how heroines could control their personal autonomy. Adventure magazines became quite popular, especially those published by DC Thomson; the publisher sent observers around the country to talk to boys and learn what they wanted to read about. The story line in magazines and cinema that most appealed to boys was the glamorous heroism of British soldiers fighting wars that were perceived as exciting and just.

=== Casual leisure ===

&quot;&quot;Casual leisure&quot; is immediately, intrinsically rewarding; and it is a relatively short-lived, pleasurable activity requiring little or no special training to enjoy it.&quot; For example, watching TV or going for a swim.

=== Project-based leisure ===

&quot;&quot;Project-based leisure&quot; is a short-term, moderately complicated, either one-shot or occasional, though infrequent, creative undertaking carried out in free time.&quot; For example, working on a single Wikipedia article or building a garden feature.

== Cultural differences ==

Time available for leisure varies from one society to the next, although anthropologists have found that hunter-gatherers tend to have significantly more leisure time than people in more complex societies. As a result, band societies such as the Shoshone of the Great Basin came across as extraordinarily lazy to European colonialists.

Workaholics, less common than the social myths, are those who work compulsively at the expense of other activities. They prefer to work rather than spend time socializing and engaging in other leisure activities.

European and American men statistically have more leisure time than women, due to both household and parenting responsibilities and increasing participation in the paid employment. In Europe and the United States, adult men usually have between one and nine hours more leisure time than women do each week.

== Family leisure ==
Family leisure is defined as time that parents, children and siblings spend together in free time or recreational activities, and it can be expanded to address intergenerational family leisure as time that grandparents, parents, and grandchildren spend together in free time or recreational activities. Leisure can become a central place for the development of emotional closeness and strong family bonds. Contexts such as urban/rural shape the perspectives, meanings, and experiences of family leisure. For example, leisure moments are part of work in rural areas, and the rural idyll is enacted by urban families on weekends, but both urban and rural families somehow romanticize rural contexts as ideal spaces for family making (connection to nature, slower and more intimate space, notion of a caring social fabric, tranquillity, etc.). Also, much &quot;family leisure&quot; requires tasks that are most often assigned to women. Family leisure also includes playing together with family members on the weekend day.

== Aging ==
Leisure is important across the lifespan and can facilitate a sense of control and self-worth. Older adults, specifically, can benefit from physical, social, emotional, cultural, and spiritual aspects of leisure. Leisure engagement and relationships are commonly central to &quot;successful&quot; and satisfying aging. For example, engaging in leisure with grandchildren can enhance feelings of generativity, whereby older adults can achieve well-being by leaving a legacy beyond themselves for future generations.

<text>Leslie Claire Margaret Caron (; born 1 July 1931) is a French and American actress and dancer. She is the recipient of a Golden Globe Award, two BAFTA Awards and a Primetime Emmy Award, in addition to nominations for two Academy Awards.

Caron began her career as a ballerina. She made her film debut in the musical &quot;An American in Paris&quot; (1951), followed by roles in &quot;The Man with a Cloak&quot; (1951), &quot;Glory Alley&quot; (1952) and &quot;The Story of Three Loves&quot; (1953), before her role of an orphan in &quot;Lili&quot; (also 1953), which earned her the BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actress and garnered nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award.

As a leading lady, Caron starred in films such as &quot;The Glass Slipper&quot; (1955), &quot;Daddy Long Legs&quot; (1955), &quot;Gigi&quot; (1958), &quot;Fanny&quot; (1961), both of which earned her Golden Globe nominations, &quot;Guns of Darkness&quot; (1962), &quot;The L-Shaped Room&quot; (1962), &quot;Father Goose&quot; (1964) and &quot;A Very Special Favor&quot; (1965). For her role as a single pregnant woman in &quot;The L-Shaped Room&quot;, Caron, in addition to receiving a second Academy Award nomination, won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama and a second BAFTA Award.

Caron&#x27;s other roles include &quot;Is Paris Burning?&quot; (1966), &quot;The Man Who Loved Women&quot; (1977), &quot;Valentino&quot; (1977), &quot;Damage&quot; (1992), &quot;Funny Bones&quot; (1995), &quot;Chocolat&quot; (2000) and &quot;Le Divorce&quot; (2003). In 2007, she won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for portraying heiress and rape victim, Lorraine Delmas, in &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;.

== Early life and family ==
Caron was born in Boulogne-sur-Seine, Seine (now Boulogne-Billancourt, Hauts-de-Seine), the daughter of Margaret (née Petit), a Franco-American dancer on Broadway, and Claude Caron, a French chemist, pharmacist, perfumer and boutique owner. Claude Caron was the founder of the artisanal perfumier Guermantes. While her older brother, Aimery Caron, became a chemist like their father, Leslie was prepared for a performing career from childhood by her mother. The family lost its wealth during World War II and could not provide a dowry for Caron. &quot;My mother said: &#x27;There&#x27;s only one profession that leads you to marrying money and becoming a princess or duchess, and that&#x27;s ballet.&#x27; ... My grandfather whispered heavily: &#x27;Margaret, you want your daughter to be a whore?&#x27; I heard it. This has always followed me&quot;.
Of the lost fortune, Caron recalled, &quot;My mother died of it&quot;. Her mother, who had grown up in poverty, could not cope with their reduced circumstances. She became depressed and an alcoholic and, at age 67, killed herself.

==Career==
Caron was initially a ballerina. Gene Kelly discovered her in the Roland Petit company &quot;Ballet des Champs Elysées&quot; and cast her to appear opposite him in the musical &quot;An American in Paris&quot; (1951), a role for which a pregnant Cyd Charisse was originally cast. The prosperity, sunshine and abundance of California was a cultural shock to Caron. She had lived in Paris during the German occupation, which left her malnourished and anemic. She later remarked how nice people were in comparison to wartime Paris, in which poverty and deprivation had caused people to be bitter and violent. She had a friendly relationship with Kelly, who nicknamed her &quot;Lester the Pester&quot; and &quot;kid&quot;. Kelly helped the inexperienced Caron—who had never spoken on stage—adjust to filmmaking..

Her role led to a seven-year MGM contract. The films which followed included the musical &quot;The Glass Slipper&quot; (1955) and the drama &quot;The Man with a Cloak&quot; (1951), with Joseph Cotten and Barbara Stanwyck. Still, Caron has said of herself: &quot;Unfortunately, Hollywood considers musical dancers as hoofers. Regrettable expression.&quot; She also starred in the musicals &quot;Lili&quot; (1953, receiving an Academy Award for Best Actress nomination), with Mel Ferrer; &quot;Daddy Long Legs&quot; (1955), with Fred Astaire; and &quot;Gigi&quot; (1958) with Louis Jourdan and Maurice Chevalier.

Dissatisfied with her career despite her success (&quot;I thought musicals were futile and silly&quot;, she said in 2021; &quot;I appreciate them better now&quot;), Caron studied the Stanislavski method. In the 1960s and thereafter, Caron worked in European films as well. For her performance in the British drama &quot;The L-Shaped Room&quot; (1962), she won the BAFTA Award for Best British Actress and the Golden Globe, and was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar. Her other film assignments in this period included &quot;Father Goose&quot; (1964) with Cary Grant; Ken Russell&#x27;s &quot;Valentino&quot; (1977), in the role of silent-screen legend Alla Nazimova; and Louis Malle&#x27;s &quot;Damage&quot; (1992). Sometime in 1970, Caron was one of the many actresses considered for the lead role of Eglantine Price in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot;, losing the role to British actress Angela Lansbury.

In 1967, she was a member of the jury of the 5th Moscow International Film Festival (MIFF). In 1989, she was a member of the jury at the 39th Berlin International Film Festival.

Caron returned to France in the early 1970s, which she later said was a mistake. &quot;They adore someone who&#x27;s really British or really American&quot;, Caron said, &quot;but somebody who&#x27;s French and has made it in Hollywood – and I was the only one who had really made it in a big way – they can&#x27;t forgive&quot;. During the 1980s, she appeared in several episodes of the soap opera &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; as Nicole Sauguet. Caron is one of the few actresses from the classic era of MGM musicals who are still active in film — a group that includes Rita Moreno, Margaret O&#x27;Brien and June Lockhart. Caron&#x27;s later credits include &quot;Funny Bones&quot; (1995) with Jerry Lewis and Oliver Platt; &quot;The Last of the Blonde Bombshells&quot; (2000) with Judi Dench and Cleo Laine; &quot;Chocolat&quot; (2000) and &quot;Le Divorce&quot; (2003), directed by James Ivory, with Kate Hudson and Naomi Watts.

On June 30, 2003, Caron travelled to San Francisco to appear as the special guest star in &quot;The Songs of Alan Jay Lerner: I Remember It Well&quot;, a retrospective concert staged by San Francisco&#x27;s 42nd Street Moon Company. In 2007, her guest appearance on &quot;Law and Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; earned her a Primetime Emmy Award. On April 27, 2009, Caron travelled to New York as an honoured guest at a tribute to Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe at the Paley Center for Media.

For her contributions to the film industry, Caron was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame on December 8, 2009, with a motion pictures star located at 6153 Hollywood Boulevard. In February 2010, she played Madame Armfeldt in &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris, which also featured Greta Scacchi and Lambert Wilson.

In 2016, Caron appeared in the ITV television series &quot;The Durrells&quot; (produced by her son Christopher Hall) as the Countess Mavrodaki.

Veteran documentarian Larry Weinstein&#x27;s &quot;Leslie Caron: The Reluctant Star&quot; premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) on June 28, 2016.

In September 1951, Caron married American George Hormel II, a grandson of George A. Hormel, the founder of the Hormel meat-packing company. They divorced in 1954. During that period, while under contract to MGM, she lived in Laurel Canyon in a Normandie style 1927 mansion near the country store on Laurel Canyon Blvd. One bedroom was all mirrored for her dancing rehearsals. 

Her second husband was British theatre director Peter Hall. They married in 1956 and had two children: Christopher John Hall, a television drama producer, and Jennifer Caron Hall, a writer, painter and actress. Her son-in-law, married to Jennifer, is Glenn Wilhide, a producer and screenwriter. 

Caron had an affair with Warren Beatty in 1961. When she and Hall divorced in 1965, Beatty was named as a co-respondent and was ordered by the London court to pay the costs of the case. In 1969, Caron married Michael Laughlin, the producer of the film &quot;Two-Lane Blacktop;&quot; the couple divorced in 1980. 

Caron was also romantically linked to Dutch television actor Robert Wolders from 1994 to 1995.

From 1981, she rented and lived for a few years in a mill (the &quot;Moulin Neuf&quot;) in the French village of Chaumot, Yonne, which had belonged to Prince Francis Xavier of Saxony in the late 18th century and which depended on his princely castle. From June 1993 until September 2009, Caron owned and operated the hotel and restaurant &quot;Auberge la Lucarne aux Chouettes&quot; (The Owls&#x27; Nest), in Villeneuve-sur-Yonne, about south of Paris. Caron&#x27;s mother had committed suicide in her 60s; suffering from a lifetime of depression, Caron also considered doing so in 1995. She was hospitalized for a month and began attending Alcoholics Anonymous. Unhappy with the lack of acting opportunities in France, she returned to England in 2013.

In her autobiography, &quot;Thank Heaven&quot;, she states that she obtained American citizenship in time to vote for Barack Obama for president.

In October 2021, she was chosen to receive the Oldie of the Year Award by The Oldie magazine. It had been initially offered to Queen Elizabeth II, who had declined it on the grounds that she did not meet the criteria, even though she was five years older than Caron.
